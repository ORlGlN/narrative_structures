- But I was gonna say--
Oh my gosh, there's a ghost!
(screaming)
A ghost!
(screaming)
There's a big ghost on me!
What am I gonna do?
Who am I gonna call?
- Ghostbuster.
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun

♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team,
♫ Chill out among the stars
♫ Take this shield it will be fine
♫ Take this hand and we'll just shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Liver upper
- Good mornin'!
- Good morning!
Good morning (laughs)
It is a beautiful Sunday morning.
Luna is like going crazy right now.
She is enjoying this amazing
Sunday morning with us.
Actually, it is really nice weather.
It's kind of chilly out.
It's not chilly, but
definitely not hot or warm.
Me and the boys are all ready for church,
but unfortunately,
Bryan is just not feeling
good this morning.
The boys have had a little bit of a cough
for the past week.
And it's pretty much gone,
but it looks like Bryan has got it now.
He always tends to get
the leftover sickness.
Even if, like, I never get it,
Bryan always ends up getting it.
He just doesn't have as good
of an immune system, I guess.
But anyways, I think that me and the boys
are still going to head to
church, because we are all ready.
And Bryan was trying to get ready,
and he was like 'I just don't feel good,
'I don't think that I'm going to make it.'
And I was like all right,
well, we're still going to go.
We're going to have a good time, huh?
Who do you guys have?
- Papa!
-  Papa!
They were so excited when they saw Papa.
- I that Mimi here?
-  Is Mimi here?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah, oh my goodness!
- You saw one?
- Yeah!
-  How did you guys do at church?
Did you have fun?
- Good!
-  What did you do?
- I colored and I played at Diego's.
-  Ollie's Church
and Finn's Church?
You guys go to separate churches?
- Yeah!
That's Finn's house.
And that's mine.
- Oh, interesting!
We have now made it to
the furniture store.
I'm with my mom and dad,
and we're looking at a few
different furniture items
for their house,
because their house is definitely lacking
in some furniture right now.
But we're looking specifically,
for the top loft area, a small couch.
Here's a couple of really
cute ones, actually.
Not too big.
- The one with the tape on it.
- Oh yeah.
See, it's big!
It might be too big.
But yeah, we're just looking.
The boys are kinda going
out of their minds.
Like, get me out of here.
- Help me.
- You want out?
Yeah, you need to sit down on your bottom.
So, we are now looking at bunk beds
for the boys' room.
And, Mom, I think I found the perfect one.
Because the truth is that,
that room is the boys',
and Cassie has a downstairs room
that she can stay in
when she comes and stays.
But she kind of wants
to stay upstairs too.
So she wants to just
sleep in the boys' room.
And I found,
I found the solution!
Three bunk beds!
Is this even considered a bunk bed?
Is this a tri-bed?
I don't know.
I say that Cassie has
to sleep on the bottom.
Yeah.
And then there's Finn, then there's Ollie.
Probably opposite, but it's just so funny.
I would be so scared to be this person.
It just looks very
claustrophobic in there.
But I didn't even know
those were a real thing.
It's called a triple decker bunk bed.
- I mean, I wouldn't put
a ceiling fan in the room.
-  Yeah, seriously, ouch.
- We forgot our tape measure,
so the only way we can
measure how big it is,
we know we have six feet,
we have to put Missy on the ground.
- I'm 5'2''.
-  Yeah.
-  You are not 5'2''.
-  So, that's about a 5.5' couch.
- I've measured myself numerous times.
I'm pretty sure I'm 5'2''.
- Unfortunately the kids
are going to dog pile.
We gotta get going.
We've got a lot of couches to measure.
(laughing)
- I am no longer with my parents.
And the boys saw this Halloween store,
I don't know if you guys can see it,
and they were like, can we please stop?
Finn's like 'Halloween, Halloween'!
They're super excited about it.
They're just excited for
Halloween altogether.
We always have so much fun
throughout the whole month of October.
And I was like, I really
want to go there, too.
But I was like, it's so fun
to do these things with Bryan.
We just get to experience
the boys enjoying
Halloween stuff together.
And then, like, we get to
pick out stuff for them.
And it's fun to do with him.
But he's not feeling good today.
So, I was like, all right,
I will take you guys in,
but I'm also a little nervous.
I mean, going into a store
like a Halloween store
with two little boys
can be extremely hectic and very scary.
So I've already given the rules.
We will go in there.
We can look around.
He can ask me for things.
If I say no, then the answer
is no, right? (laughing)
And we're not going to whine
or cry or ask a million times for things.
I've got the rules set,
so I'm going to go ahead and go in there.
But if that happens, we're
leaving immediately, right?
Yeah, so he knows the rules.
We're going to go in.
I might actually buy a few costumes,
because we are super excited
for the month of October,
and we have a few plans for it.
I think we're going to go
ahead and make this attempt
of me going into the Halloween
store alone with two boys.
Here's the skeleton.
All right, boys, boys, don't beat it up.
But that is pretty scary looking, huh?
What is that Ollie?
(Ollie laughing)
They did not like that. (Missy laughing)
Oh goodness.
Come on, come on.
- Those are spiders,
(lowering voice) spiders!
(Missy laughing)
-  Oh my goodness,
all the superheroes!
(Finn cheering)
What else do you see?
- Joker!
-  Joker?
- Yeah!
This!
-  Is that Thor?
Yeah, Thor.
- That's me, Thor!
I'm Thor!
-  Captain America!
Oh my gosh, what is that?
Is that Hulk?
Look at all the baby costumes!
I'm obsessed.
These are so cute!
Who's that?
Yeah, that's Olaf!
(gasping) What is that?
A Captain America shield?
- Look, a Superman gun!
-  Wow!
Get over here, Finn!
(fun music)
- Well, hey guys.
It has been just a very
chill day at the house.
Missy has been out with the boys
doing some October 1st things.
Happy October 1st!
That's exciting!
But yeah, nothing out of the ordinary
has been happening much here today,
but I was going to say that--
Oh my gosh, there's a ghost!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
A ghost!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh, it's attacking me!
Ahhhhhhh, there's a big ghost on me!
What am I gonna do?
I've gotta get rid of this ghost!
Ahhhhhhhh!
Who am I gonna call?
- Ghostbusters!
(exciting music)
(explosions)
(booming explosion)
(crashing explosion)
(cups breaking explosion)
(thundering explosion)
(terrifying ghost monster screaming)
(clacking crashing)
(evil laugh)
(multiple rounds of clacking crashing)
(audience cheering and applauding)
- Oh, Ollie, thank goodness!
I heard you were a Ghostbuster, right?
- Yeah!
- All right, well, I've
got a pretty nasty ghost.
He looks just like that,
and he's terrorizing the whole house.
And I'm sorry to say, Ollie,
but he got to your room.
(ghost spookily shouting)
Do you hear him?
Do you hear that evil ghost?
He tore up your room
and he threw all of your toys everywhere!
And all our shoes, even!
- This ghost has to go!
- But be warned, Ollie:
this ghost is very very very strong.
Do you think you can handle the case?
- Yes.
-  All right, well
you need your little backpack
and your little gun to
suck up the ghost, right?
- Yes!
-  All right, let's get it on.
- All right.
I have it right here!
-  Well, that's convenient!
Let's put it on.
- Ghostbuster!
- Ghostbuster time!
Turn around and I will put your pack on.
This is what stores the ghost, right?
- Mhmm.
- Okay, there we go.
And then your gun is right here
attached to the backpack.
- Okay.
- So that you can suck him up, okay?
Just like that.
Can you do it?
- Let's get this ghost!
(exciting ghostbusting music)
Oh no, the ghost got all the shoes!
-  I know, the ghost
threw all our shoes everywhere,
and look what they did to your pumpkins!
- Oh no!
- What do we do?
If you think that's
bad, Ghostbuster Ollie,
wait 'til you see what
happened in your room.
You're not going to be happy.
- That ghost threw my toys everywhere!
-  He did, huh?
Made a big mess.
Do you see any signs of ghost in the area?
- Well, I do have these signs on.
(audience laughing)
-  Oh, yeah, that
is a sign of a ghost.
All right, let's go outside
and see if you can hunt
this guy down, okay?
All right, let's see if we
can find this ghost outside.
I bet he's here somewhere.
- Ghost!
- Do you see the ghost, Ollie?
I don't see the ghost anywhere.
Ollie, the ghost, he
has made an appearance!
Hurry, get him!
(whooshing)
(whirring)
(whooshing)
You're going to jail, marshmallow ghost!
(whirring)
(ghost pained grunting)
(heart beating)
- Welcome, Ghost!
(monster groaning)
-  Whoa, you got 'em, Ollie!
- I got you, Ghost!
- You got 'em!
Look, he's normal Finn again!
That was so good!
Ghostbuster Ollie saved
the day, and, guess what,
there's marshmallows left over to spare.
Do you want a marshmallow?
Bite into it.
That's your reward for battling the ghost.
Is it yummy?
Marshmallows are always
a really yummy treat.
- I'm sorry.
-  Yeah!
Hey, Finn, did you have fun
pretending to be a ghost?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
He destroyed the whole house, didn't he?
Now that mean old ghost, Ollie,
he's stored in your backpack.
And he'll never bother us again, okay?
He's like 'Say whatever you want, Dad.
'These marshmallows are amazing!'
(laughing)
Say 'I'm a chubby bunny.'
(mumbling)
(laughing)
Finn, say 'I'm a chubby bunny.'
(gurgling)
(laughing)
(Finn exclaiming a really
important discovery)
Oh really?
Finn has so much energy
right now you guys.
I don't even know what we're
going to do with him tonight.
Whoa, kiddo, calm down. (laughing)
He's in full on play mode. (laughing)
I'm so happy that it is October 1st,
because we get to start
all the fun October things.
We get to make yummy fall treats.
The boys get to dress up.
We have so many cool costumes
and fun things planned for this month.
I think you guys are going
to really, really enjoy it.
But it's just so fun to
get to see them dress up
and play pretend,
and like put on little skits.
They love doing that.
(groaning menacingly)
Zombie ghostbuster, ahh!
Don't eat me zombie! (laughing)
(fun music)
So, I thought this was funny.
I ordered these trick-or-treat
bags from Pottery Barn,
and I got them customized
with all the kids' names.
So, we have them for all these cousins
and friends and stuff.
And this one came with Julia.
I do not know Julia, but we
are actually missing Ollie.
So now I have to email them
and see if they can send us a new one
with Ollie's name on it,
and not Julia.
Shout out to Julia.
Sorry we took your trick-or-treat bag.
(fun music)
All right, Ghostbusters, report for duty!
Ten hut soldier.
So, today is October 1.
Do you know what that means?
- What?
- We get to get a candy
out of the calendar.
(Missy cheering)
This is our new Halloween tradition.
- I want to get this one.
- Well, we've got to start with 1.
October 1st.
Grab it, Finn.
Yay, one day down, 30 to go, boys!
Before you know it, it's going
to be Halloween up in here!
And then look at Ollie.
He's like, 'I'm going to climb up.'
- All right, we've got an
orange one and a red one.
- Who wants red and who wants orange?
- I want red, I want red, I want red!
-  Lucky for you,
Finn's favorite is orange.
-  Here, I'll open it for you.
Yay!
You guys ate your dinner!
- You got your little snack!
Fun day, huh boys!
Hey, Ollie, what's your favorite candy?
- Red.
- Red Starbursts? (laughing)
he also really likes Skittles, huh?
- Mhmm.
- Should we ask them what
their favorite candy is?
- What's your favorite candy?
- That's right.
What's your guys' favorite candy?
Let us know down below in the comments.
It's October 1st!
It's almost Halloween, baby, get excited!
This is a fun time for you buys.

But anyway, thanks so much
