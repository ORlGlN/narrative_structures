little star yo oh love that track I love
my new haircut now you guys cuz I
literally I just get it a little wet and
then just throw a little bit of my hair

I look more like a dad when it's longer
for what it's shorter huh what hashtag
dad life

today's word is oiler
I swear whatever my dad gets home that's
what changes it is the weirdest thing
but should I change it to rub I love you
courage you do that one I love you I
love you I'm putting baby Olly in the
car right now and his positive R is
glowing in the dark that's so cool
you're such a cool hipster baby yeah
it's like oh yeah you're still in there
show you guys something I've been
wearing this little bracelet for a few
days and it's actually um a kick counter
bracelet it's got these little feet on
it
and you move it across every time you
feel your baby tip obviously I'm not
very good anymore so haven't using it to
keep track of which boob I lost that off
of working pretty good the only problem
is that I tend to play with it so
sometimes I get ready to feed him I'm
like wait I get I thought I already did
that one did that side because I'm like
switching around when I'm not supposed
to be so that's kind of the bad part I'm
to play with it I don't know I don't
know if it's really working but it's
cool again I know I get to wear a crazy
little bracelet and I'm really bad with
jewelry so I don't wear a lot of jewelry
I remember that necklace I bought her
when I was in San Diego she's not
wearing it yeah much I'm not where is it
don't don't you forget it on huh I am
obsessed with Freebirds you guys this
cannot be healthy but actually it's a
lot healthier than eating fat and
password and what's cool about three
words is that burritos like fill me up I
feel full for like super long look at
this it's like coming out at the seams
you guys oh yeah all you want some
what's on my burrito buddy that was
amazing
do you see that it's just like
disappeared and look at they have these
little sculptures like I showed you the
other day it's a cool like little mining
thing okay
that is octopus what what this you guys
wearing a B is wearing the V you look
stylish buddy all he just let out like a
huge burp and he's in the middle of
meeting it was quite funny Dave look it
I know it's throwback Thursday and I
just put up this picture and it's me and
baby ollie like the first time I held
him look how small he is I guess he has
gone bigger he has gotten a little
bigger
it's just crazy these are like pictures
that I never even really looked at
because we just took them you know I
cannot believe that it's been like
almost six weeks why is her there's a
cart in the nursing room is that in case
we forgot our stroller we could just
like lame in the bottom of the car I
love our little 93 max it's so cool just
like daddy huh you're just like daddy
baby all you likes this song you're
gonna watch it hey Katy Perry's hot no
not a lovey it was just a little spittle
I seem to be obsessed with this store
like every time I I get to go to the
store I get all excited I wish I could
buy like everything so have another wet
bag oh yeah I really I have one wet bag
it really makes it very convenient for
days when I do laundry also wanting to
buy some gripe water um I think I've
told you guys like he does a little bit
of grunting it's not like terrible but
it's just like and wondering if gripe
water wouldn't work I don't know if
that's what it is or you notice gripe
water helps with like gas and upset
tummies and stuff like that so look for
some like water too good all the fluffy
fluffy fluffy fluffy
I thought this color I really like this
color this color actually matches the
theme of like our banner and the colors
that we use for the vlog it's a cool huh
and then we probably have plenty but be
nice to just add some every now and then
you know what I mean are we allowed to
put I never know like can we set things
in his stroller I was like a cart always
afraid things are gonna like
get left behind and then we steal and
then we have bad karma coming our way
and you know when karma is bad and he
runs after you and bites you in the butt
I found it and I also have heard that
bran is actually really good we're gonna
try it and see if that helps with your
clumpiness definitely using our baby as
a shopping cart right now this is a crib
no it wasn't this is a bad babe it can
be a crib or a bed that's pretty dope

our bed I'm gonna test out some
bassinets with this how you like this
