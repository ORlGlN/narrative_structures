this is Cambodia you guys we just left
the cafe and now it's Sunday so we're
actually headed to church it's quite

steady hi say hi

alright nice and warm
coming over all right guys we just had
church service at the water of life
cambodia and i wanted to introduce you
guys to someone this is Randy
so Randy why don't you tell them a
little bit about who you are and if
they're not familiar with water of life
like a little bit about what you guys
are all about what you guys do okay well
we're an organization and we're here to
help disabled young men and young women
grow up in God and the world
educational skills or trade skills that
they wouldn't otherwise have so we
thought if we can help Cambodia which is
really lacking in education less than
like 16 percent of something in the
goes to high school so we thought if we
give them some education opportunities
we would bring them into our homes not
just at the dormitory but helps family
unit study here at the gals house at the
younger kids house have family settings
that help them to be raised up to
receive education so they can themselves
become doctors or lawyers or workers in
their own country and so then they can
go out and they can do the medical
themselves or do the outreaches or or
the thing you saw out here make the
animals or whatever they can do all
those things themselves and then no
longer takes me that I'm kind of over
all this time just the old guy in the
back row I can the Muppets Jersey the
Muppets yeah the two guys that sits up
in the back and oh yeah yeah you look
like what about like I just said oh yeah

so you said they live there and they're
doing construction there that's crazy so
Krisha and i were obviously taking too
much time to check out the people doing

I doubted my
yeah it's really interesting because all
these little kids they're very clingy
and they cling to you and they kiss you
and they tickle you and they play with
you it's just kind of sad because you
know most of these kids home life they
don't have very loving homes and so
they're kind of starving for attention
hey buddy
hi so the school they do a little
outreach here and they play songs and
they play games and they teach them
about Jesus and read them through
stories in the Bible it's really cool
that they do this every Sunday right
after church they come and do this hey
horsey look babe a horse
hi they have a lot of miniature horses

traditional Cambodian home hello
everyone's really friendly and they know
hello and they wave yeah hello yes oh
the house is below is usually for
storage and then the stairs all lead up
upstairs upstairs is where they live and
they basically do that because in the
rain if it floods it can all go straight
upstairs and then their house like isn't
real and it's just a storage area for
shade that one's got like curtains nice
