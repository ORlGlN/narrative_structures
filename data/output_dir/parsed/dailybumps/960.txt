can you come give me a hostage give me a
hug oh oh you tackled me good morning
guys today we are getting lots of stuff
done we have the carpet cleaners here
cleaning carpet cuz we're going to have
some babies here in the next week or two
and we want them to be able to crawl
around on the carpet and not have to
worry about it being dirty right and I
honestly don't think it was done before
we moved in yeah so I'm excited to get
all the carpet nice and clean all he
just got back from a swim lesson didn't
you you did so good buddy
he actually went out into the pool
before the swim instructor got here and
I think that helped yeah
but then when he got here she got here a
little bit later he was showing off for
you all he is right now trying to create
a mess in this room Missi cleaned up
this entire room we cleaned out a ton of
toys just to get ready for his birthday
and now he wants to make it a mess again
we're just talking about the stuffed
animal situation
yeah Missy has an emotional attachment
to every single one of them which I
understand they're cute
and they just item like this one he got
before he was born and this one was for
his has room and this one was for with
room and this was just making a mini on
you kid
give me a guy come on teddy bear that he
did happen yeah Missy is actually the
problem not Olly so we're actually
talking about maybe getting like a
little canopy like mesh thing for his
room dang them so that when his friends
come over they can really make fun of
him
Olly is sleeping no Mimi watches him
they're getting the carpets clean at the
same time and the reason we have to
leave the house is because last week we
we're getting the car worked on and they
had to order a part for something that
needs to be fixed so we're taking it
back down there and we're gonna kill
some time while they work on our car so
we're doing that but I did want to say
I'm in my third trimester officially
today it's officially my master I'm 27
weeks pregnant today and I feel great
for third trimester I feel really good
at I mean I have like days where I'm
more exhausted in others and I have days
where I'm more pain than others lately
the one thing that has been killing me
and this actually happened in the last
pregnancy too and I my mom was like has
your bellybutton be hurting like last
week sounds like no and then all of a
sudden the other day are actually I
think I was like yesterday it kicked in
and now I believe it hurts so bad I'll
show it to you guys
look at it you see all red it is
I have not messed with or anything but
that is my bellybutton piercing and it
is so red and stretched and it hurts so
bad
it's justice the other thing that I
think it is so for anyone wind yet their
belly button pierced don't do it like
this if you plan on getting pregnant
give it birth
all right guys we are out to lunch we
went to the corner bakery and look at
this this is amazing
there's like hardly anything left on
this display one that's amazing babe you
never do that
ooh I don't know I usually get sick away
from Buddha I realized what I wanted and
this was like - it's just pregnancy I'm
addicted to lunch lunch is my favorite
meal of the day
I would love to eat like sandwiches
soups and salads for dinner I would say
what's my favorite image in a salad
yeah we're vlogging afterwards so this
is what you're saying I had a cup of
tortilla soup which was pretty bomb and
the uptown uptown girl it always makes
me think of that
it's like turkey bacon avocado yeah
that's Missy's favorite song Billy Joel
favorite artist right his favorite
artist I really like but if you like he
walked by you you'd ask to make out with
them who what celebrity would you make
out with you think oh my gosh don't even
say it don't say his name
she always it's always Drive Bo
oh my gosh Missy you're killing me let's
appreciate
I would say Jennifer Aniston is that
okay yeah I guess that I think even you
would make out with Jennifer we have
moved to the front of the restaurant
with dessert I got a chocolate chip
cookie this easy in a cinnamon roll
which they heated up for her it does
look really good food is just really
good today that's good baby
I injured myself trimester hair all
sudden everything comes with you that's
funny alright we're finally back in our
car and I took forever for hours it took
yelling for hours oh I was so bad and we
don't even know if it's Vicki I mean
they said it is but we're charging our
phones right now yeah I plugged it
that's all basically what they did if
you look look at they replace the entire
console we listen to tease ways they
replace this entire console yeah like
this way I knew mmm brand-new which this
wasn't really working anymore either
crying this wasn't really working either
like our fingers would touch it and it
would like touch in another area like
replace the whole thing thinking oh this
will fix your charging issue which
honestly is they said they said that was
the issue that I won't charge so I have
it plugged in iPhones at 33% and it
hasn't moved yet
oh it's charging still and it would say
before it would say it's charging but it
would never charge and I'm telling you
like when you have a baby and your
phone's about to die like that's kind of
scary to be on the road with no phone no
way to call people you need it'll charge
