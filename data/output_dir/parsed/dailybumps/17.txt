-  What is that?
-  Rain!
-  Rain? Oh, it's coming down now.
- Ahh!
(laughs)
-  He's like, get me inside!

- Good morning, plant.
-  Good morning, plant.
And good morning, Ollie.
Are you giving him a drink of water?
- Yeah.
-  I think he
needs a little bit more.
- Okay.
-  (chuckles)
This is a money tree in my office here.
Ollie is watering it, huh?
- So that it can grow really big.
- Yeah.
Good morning, guys!
Ollie, look at your bedhead.
It's crazy. (laughs)
You need to do your hair.
So Ollie just did
something super, super cool
in the hallway, and he
really, really wanted
to show you guys.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Okay, show me your trick.
(Finn yelling out)
- (laughs)
Well, good morning, Finn!
(laughs)
Whoa!
That's some pretty good gymnastics, dude!
Whoa!
Crazy Finn, you've got some
energy today, don't you?
- Yeah.
- Good morning, Finn.
I love you.
Ollie was also just telling
me what his favorite, oh!
He's crazy.
Ollie was also telling me
what his favorite picture
in our hallway is.
Do you wanna tell them?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, what's
the favorite picture?
- This one.
-  And I think
that is just so cute.
So, this is a picture of Missy and I
when she met Finn for the first time,
when he was in the NICU.
That's Finny.
That's this crazy boy right here!
(laughs)
- That's hilarious, guys.
- It is, huh!
(Finn yelling out)
Never a dull moment at
our house, you guys.
Especially with two crazy,
wild boys running around.
(chuckles)
(pleasant music)
- What is it?
Oh, paper! You got paper!
- No, I did not just get paper, Ollie.
But I am really excited,
because I actually bid
on something on eBay, and I won!
And it's something I've been
wanting for a while now.
They don't make them anymore.
Check this out.
This is so cool!
It's the iCEO Throwboy doll.
They only did a limited
number of these years ago,
and it looks just like Steve Jobs.
It's just so cool.
So they only made 1,200, you guys.
And I always thought it was just so cool,
and I always thought how cool
it would look in my office,
and I scored.
- Wait, does it move?
-  Huh?
- Does it move?
-  No, he doesn't move. (chuckles)
He looks so good, though!
Oh, you guys, I miss Steve Jobs.
Hey, Siri.
Play the song Let's Catch
Santa by Daily Bumps.
-  Let's Catch Santa
by Daily Bumps now playing.
- All right, so we're
gonna see how Steve Jobs
likes the new Apple HomePod.
♪ Let's catch Santa Clause ♪
He just wants to dance.
Oh hey, did I mention I'm a nerd?
-  You guys, what
is falling from the sky?
-  Rain!
-  Rain?!
Get over here, it's wet!
Luna, get inside before you get all dirty.
It is a very rainy and coldy day.
Look at this.
I mean, the sky is just gray,
and there's this wetness,
dampness on the ground.
(Finn vocalizing and yelping)
What do you think of that? (chuckles)
It's like, barely sprinkling on him.
(Finn screeching)
I don't think Finn knows
what to think about this.
He's like, get me inside! (laughs)
Oh my gosh.
Um, yeah, it's actually a beautiful day.
I love it, it's definitely
nice to have some rain
here in California since
we don't get much of it.
Oh, and she's back out again.
Luna, get inside!
Luna, do you want out?
All right boys, get inside.
♪ It's raining, it's pouring ♪
♪ The old man is snoring ♪
♪ He bumped his head and ♪
I forgot the song, guys!
It doesn't rain enough
here, I don't know the song.
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go!
We actually have a lot to do today,
we gotta get you guys ready.
Your hair is crazy, bud.
Crazy.
Okay, I thought it'd
be fun to show you guys
how I do Ollie's hair in the morning.
All right, you ready?
- Yeah.
- So first, we have to get it all wet.
And this is actually just
a water spray bottle.
(Bryan laughs)
- It has flowers on it.
- (chuckles) It does have flowers.
All right, I do use this
leave-in conditioner
just to make his hair a little bit softer,
and it smells really good, too.
All right, once we got it all damp,
we're just gonna brush.
-  And Ollie only likes
one kind of brush, right?
- Yeah.
-  Which one do you like?
This one, he likes this brush.
He doesn't like my brush,
because it's too spiky, he says.
- Yeah, too spiky, huh?
This one's like a massage.
So now that we got this
in, I'm gonna use this
Kevin Murphy's Smooth Again.
Just a little tiny bit.
- Why is it white?
-  Because that's
the color of it. (chuckles)
And then we're just gonna run it through.
- Oh, it smells like hot dogs.
(Bryan laughs)
- He says that every
single time I do his hair.
- It does not smell
like hot dogs, you guys.
- He says it smells like barbecue,
and I'm like...
No, it doesn't.
-  No, not even close.
(laughs)
- Now we're gonna use our
handy dandy blow dryer
and blow dry it.
Let's do it.
(pleasant upbeat music)
All right, next I'm gonna
use the Kevin Murphy
Night Rider Maximum Control Texture Paste,
which opens like, oh, like.
-  It looks like
a treasure box, Ollie.
- Like this, and then like that.
And we've got his hair, like, blow dried
in the general direction I want it to go,
and I'm gonna use a
super small amount, like.
- Mmm, smells good!
- And then I'm just gonna
rub it all over my hands.
And then I'm just gonna
kind of form his hair
in the general, like,
what I want it to do.
- Ooh.
And also to mention, all of
these are my hair products.
(laughs)
These are all what I use.
You like getting your hair done?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
Oh, that looks so good, dude.
-  All right, now
that I like the way it looks,
we're just gonna hairspray it.
We're gonna glue it.
-  And there you go, dude.
-  Look how fly you look!
Do you like it?
Look in the mirror.
- Yeah!
- Luna, I have stuff to do today,
and I need you out of the car.
I've been telling her to get
out while I buckle them in,
'cause I have some errands to run,
and she refuses to get out!
Luna, come.
Come on. Oh, there she goes.
Luna, come.
You can't go with me.
You stay here, 'kay?
You stay here.
All right, we are all loaded up.
I have a feeling Finn's
gonna fall asleep. (chuckles)
It is right about his nap time.
We're just gonna do a
quick grocery store run,
and I do want to run really
quickly to Home Depot
just to grab something for
the barn, for my horse.
The weather is just pretty wet and muggy,
so it's not really weather
that I would want to ride in,
but I may end up going up there
a little bit later to go visit.
So, funny story, I made
my way all the way to,
actually I ended up going to Lowe's,
or I'm headed into Lowe's,
and both children fell asleep.
And so I went home, and
I put Finn into bed.
I was like, what was I thinking?
Finn just needs to go to
bed, he always needs his nap,
and it's definitely his nap time,
it's not too late for his nap.
And I'm like, I just need
to go put him to bed.
So I ran home and I put him to bed,
and he was out like a light.
Ollie, on the other hand,
doesn't really need a nap.
I'm sure he's getting
a nice little nap in,
which will be nice, but
he doesn't really need
to sleep very long, and
so I'm gonna wake him up,
and then we're gonna
run in, and I'm actually
looking for some flowers,
so gotta wake this dude up
and tell him it's time
to go into the store.
Well, good morning there, sunshine.
How was your sleep?
-  Good.
-  Did you think it's funny that,
when you woke up, Finn was just gone?
- Yeah.
(Missy chuckles)
-  So I was looking for this,
like a hanging plant for in the barn,
and I love this one.
I love the planter it's in, or
like the little pot it's in,
and I love the plants.
It's not something that's
like, the horses are gonna eat.
And then I wanted a small
one for one of my shelves,
and I just think this is
really pretty and simple,
it doesn't need too
much light or water, so.
Do you like them, Ollie?
-  Yeah.
-  Yay!
- These are little bug catchers, guys.
-  Bug catchers?
And what kind of bugs do they catch?
- They catch flies.
-  Flies?
- I just don't want to touch them, guys.
-  Yeah.
- They will bite you.
(Missy chuckles)
- So we are grocery shopping, and we are
in desperate need of a lot of things, huh?
- Yeah.
- So, so far we've got our
bread, we've got some fruit,
I need to get a little
bit more, and some salads,
avocados, which we always need.
And then of course, you
know, we always need
cinnamon rolls, right?
- Yeah.
-  And then
check what Ollie brought
into the store with us.
(chuckles) He brought his venus fly trap.
So yes, we did get one for
him, and he was so excited.
- Because I really wanted one.
- He actually didn't
even ask me, he was like,
"Can I just go see them one more time?"
I was like, let's just get you one,
and he wants to take care of it, huh?
- Yeah.
-  So what do you have
to do to take care of it?
- Um, give it some water and some food.
-  Yeah, what kind
of food do you give it?
- Um, flies.
-  What kind of flies?
- Black flies.
-  Black flies?
- But real flies and black flies.
-  They have to be alive, huh?
- Yeah.
-  So yeah, he's really excited.
And he had to bring it
in, he's been telling it
how much he loves it. (chuckles)
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
And he's been giving it a kiss.
Oh, and he even, like, he
put it here and he was like,
"I want it to be able to look at me."
Huh?
- Yeah.
- I told him it's not alive.
He thinks it's, like, has
eyes and can see him, huh?
All right, we're looking for arugula.
Can we find the arugula?
- No.
- We can't find it anywhere.
We're lost.
So I got home from shopping,
and I've been doing
a little project. (laughs)
- Um, is this like, homework or something?
- It is, you know, I'm
working really hard right now
to win you a vacation home. (chuckles)
- She has been doing this
for over and hour and a half.
- (groans) I get like obsessed
about stuff like this.
Um, okay, so at our store, you can,
it's like a Monopoly game, you get like,
all these pieces when you buy groceries.
- I think they have
Monopoly everywhere, right?
- Yeah, I'm sure, yeah.
Well, I don't know.
But yeah, and so basically
I'm doing really good.
- When you land on Free Parking,
do you get free parking?
Do you get free parking
at the grocery store?
-  I know, right?
Or like a best parking spot.
Um, I don't know, but I'm
about to win the million dollar
cash prize, and the million
dollar vacation home, so.
(laughs)
- Oh my gosh, you're so full of it.
-  I know.
I'm pretty close to the
$5.00 one, though, too.
I've got a $5.00 gift card. (chuckles)
Yeah, I'm actually doing pretty dang good,
and I have quite a few left.
We'll be shopping at this grocery store
for the next few months
until the game is over,
(Bryan laughs) and hopefully
I win a million dollars.
(chuckles)
All right, I finished with
my little project now.
I gotta say, I am so close to
winning that million dollars.
I've got one left!
Anyways, kids just ate dinner
and they're taking a bath.
Actually, they're taking a shower.
And I thought I would talk about something
I've been thinking about a lot lately,
which is something that
also people ask me about
all the time, especially
now that I have a horse,
and my life is, like, a
little bit busier and stuff.
But it is if I'm going
to have another baby.
I have to say, I've kind
of been telling myself,
like, 2018 we're gonna start to try again.
That's kind of been like my plan.
And life is just so busy right now,
I'm just like, I don't
think I can swing it yet.
But my plan was kind of end
of 2018, so I'm still like,
am I gonna be ready by the end?
I'm not really sure.
I have thought about,
like, what I'm going to do,
now that I have two kids,
I've got one in school,
the other one's gonna be
in school pretty soon,
I have a horse, which
is a big responsibility,
I mean, we've got a business,
we've got a couple businesses,
honestly, and we have
a lot, a lot going on.
Can I actually manage another baby?
And I honestly feel like not yet.
I feel like there will be a time.
I definitely have, like,
me and Bryan both have,
like, that feeling in us that's just like,
I think we want one more.
I think we would love
to have just one more,
and it feels like that would
be, like, the finishing piece
to our puzzle, or our family, you know?
And it feels like something's missing.
I mean, we love our little family of four,
and we're just cherishing
every second of it.
But it just, I don't know, to
me, I feel like there's just
like a little something
that might be missing.
And so as far as, like,
managing a horse, gosh, like,
I wouldn't be able to ride
too far into my pregnancy,
probably not very far at all, honestly.
And you know, just the work
of it, I think I'd be able
to manage working with
the horse, but riding,
I wouldn't really be able to do,
so I would probably have to find someone
to help ride and stuff, which
wouldn't be too difficult.
And then yeah, I mean, just
life is busy, you know?
It's not as much napping as
I could've done in my first,
with like, when I was pregnant with Ollie,
which I really didn't do much of anyways.
And just busy, you know?
I'm gonna be going in and
out of taking them to school,
and doing things, and then
you throw a baby in there,
I mean, that's a whole other life to that,
I can't even imagine yet.
But I am hoping that by
the end of, like, 2018,
we can really start, like,
really start getting our life
ready and prepared to throw
another little one into the mix,
and I know that by doing
that, that's at least
three to four years of, like, busy.
I mean, honestly, it's
like the rest of your life
is super busy.
But, you know, when they're
just like itty bitty baby,
they just rely on you so
much, and you can't really
just be like, oh I'm just,
you know, I've got a horse,
I've gotta do that.
Like, I've got a baby,
that's more important.
So, just trying to figure out how to
manage all of that, and
how to fit everything in,
and how we're gonna make it happen.
But I'm excited, the boys
are always talking about
how much they want another baby,
and they want to be momma's baby,
but they need another baby, and it's just
the cutest thing ever.
So maybe soon, I think it'll be fun, too,
to wait 'til they're a
little older as well,
to like really get to be involved
and remember the next
little one being a baby.
That is my cue, though, so
I'm gonna go check in on them.
Bryan's in there, but I'm
gonna go check in on them,
and then get them ready for bed!
Life is so crazy, I gotta go!
