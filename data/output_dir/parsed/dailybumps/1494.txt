that and then you want the boom and then
you're all done with a pen you want more
that's awesome Ali look how do I get him
to look at me I know that's the hardest
part that is the hardest part for me so
I'm like he's not even looking at me hey
Olly Olly Olly Olly Olly Olly Olly pop
what's the point of bass I think he
doesn't even look at me I know it's
really hard
why okay so I'm in the middle doing my
hair I haven't done it yet I've been
working on it for a couple days now
basically it's the most disgusting thing
okay my finger has about a quarter inch
cut so he showed you guys there it is
that is so disgusting okay so it's like
a quarter inch and it hurts really bad
and every time I run my fingers through
my hair it's so disgusting but my hair
gets caught in the cut like it makes me
puke every time it happens so I've
resorted to my sister helping me do my
hair
help me straining because it's like the
worst thing I probably put a bandaid on
but I feel like I'd be afraid that my
straightener would like burn my band-aid
and melted to my finger I'm in the
middle my first step in my hair but um
Bryan's playing GTA and I put him also
in charge of watching Olly and he's
trying to change all of his diaper but
he's also playing a game so he's doing
it in steps so he got the mat out and
he's probably waiting for like the next
step Oliver
that changed my gosh guys and their
babies and their dings alright so Cassie
straightening my hair like a good sister
gonna have a baby so I wanted to talk
about something because I'm really
really bummed about this okay guys like
I might have even shed a few tears but
um basically I'm a fuse remember but if
you didn't go when you're off to
Alcatraz um I was like literally running
from the parking garage to the gate to
go to Alcatraz and I had Oliver in my in
my carrier and I had his diaper bag and
like all this stuff right and also what
I was holding was one of his blankets
and it's a blanket that I've used since
the day he was born
it is like super special to me it's one
of the first gifts we got from one of
our subscribers I think it's even from
England with the monkey money yeah it's
green it's super soft it has monkeys all
over and it's like so so special to me I
dropped it somewhere like literally in
the streets like probably when I was
crossing the street or something I don't
know bummed about it it's gone like it I
don't have it anymore and it's like that
was like his blankie I don't know if you
guys know I've been mentioning it a lot
like how I wanted it to be his blankie
and his special naked and blah blah and
it really sucks but I did gain a blanket
amazing blanket from my best friend
Kelsey she made this for me and I
literally am in love with it
and so yeah I lost my other blanket but
I definitely gained a really really
special one also and the cool thing is
is that I actually um be filmed us
opening it and Brian forgot to put it in
the vlog so I'm gonna have him put it in
right now so we're gonna go a flashback
to Friday when she gave me this present

still in my tummy and she's been waiting
to give it to him and so she just gave
it to us

a blanket and it's got all these cute
little monkey themed okay and then on
the back it's really soft and
comfortable and then this on the end is
