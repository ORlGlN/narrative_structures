good money good mind to you a big
offense you know so far okay look at how
steep these two PS oh we were going to
me what you thought I did
did you really I did some morning get up
yeah good morning everyone so I am in a
baby moot baby mode once again I'm going
through he's got tons of closet space so
I really want to be able to utilize as
much as this as possible like I said he
has a lot of blankets so here's all
receiving blankets here's a bunch of
blankets I've got a couple piles of
blankets here so that's good I know live
you were like don't turn the cloth or
the receiving blankets into cloth wipes
but because you can use them as burp rag
but I have a huge stack of just burp
rags um see if I can shown to you I have
like this entire bucket is just full of
burp rags burp stuff all kinds of stuff
so if I turn a couple of these receiving
blankets into wipes it's not going to be
a big deal so I'm just kind of in the
process of kind of trying to find a way
to really utilize as much as this as
possible so I am making me some lunch
and I'm gonna have a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich oh hi Carmen he walked up
to me he's like me could I get one of
those who can I get one of those I
didn't really follow the whole jelly jam
thing that we had going on a couple
vlogs but I guess people are very
opinionated about jelly versus Jam I
don't know yeah I'm making me a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich and if you
don't know we have a rule in this house
that when you make peanut butter and
jelly sandwich you have to use two
different knives one for the peanut
butter and one for the jelly because we
do not these don't cross you don't cross
these not in this house that ain't
happening
peanut butter and jelly
two star-crossed lovers in this house we
do not we separate them no no no go to
your room Juliet and you definitely get
some more hangers for clothes like I
said I want to put all his sizes up
there so I can have everything just kind
of ready for when as he gets older I can
just kind of pull those clothes down and
put them in his armoire and then put the
yeah his other his size that he doesn't
fade away I am so close I'm so close to
being full term so I'm pretty excited
and just getting really really close
oh and I hung up his jackets again so
that's cute I don't know if he's gonna
get a chance to wear them I think those
are all newborn sizes he's gonna be born
in August so I don't know if he's really
gonna get aware and they're so cute so
maybe maybe he'll still fit in them when
it starts getting colder but we do live
in Southern California where it doesn't
really get very cold look what I found
you guys pulled it out of a box and it's
actually all dusty and stuff because I
haven't played with it in a while
sad day though the charger broke so it's
fully charged now but that's gonna be
like the only charge I get until I get a
new one and I was actually thinking
maybe we should just buy another
helicopter like a cool pink one for
Missy and then we could play would that
be so much fun our room will be fun
placement to fly I know the wing we have
like vaulted ceilings in this whole
house so it's gonna be like super fun to
fly I want to fly I want to fly I want
to fly it oh yeah back to life
so much more on the fly
I haven't chandelier watch out for this
is so much fun miss this so much room
alright I'm going to try and land it on
this edge over here oh crap no no what
do I do to get bad oh we did it I gotta
say that okay yeah this is like you get
one crash the most important light of my
career oh yeah Oh Oh what are you that
as he's doing lunges to get him down to
help him move his body do you think it's
working I no idea I think I felt the
contraction but I don't know that's just
cuz I sometimes feel the directions yeah
lunge isn't baby why is this
embarrassing
Oh stretch push him down my yoga ball I
know we got the yoga ball but we didn't
pack the pump and we have no idea where
it is so it's flat yeah I mean I've been
having it I've had it out like this
whole pregnancy and right when I need it
that's when it's done yeah pretty much
yeah the ultrasound lady didn't really
tell us but she can't really tell you
look really low to me no I don't think
it's like engaged though I don't think
he's like in my pelvis or anything we
are headed to the Asian market a lot of
people really want to at least try one
more through a lot of for the bump date
and a lot of people said do the pumpkin
but really I don't think there is
anywhere that sells a pumpkin which is a
pumpkin in July I don't yeah especially
in this area like we just there's
nowhere that smells a pumpkin not even a
small pumpkin so we are going to try the
Asian market
for a jackfruit that's what's call great
yeah so my hopes are not I don't I don't
know we've been here before it's
actually kind of weird yeah I don't
think what stuff but weird at least take
a shot at it it's really cool out today
but it's actually kind of like muggy
does it feel muggy to you it's like
greyish - it's not very like bright and
sunny Cali yeah there's the vegetables
to choose from what's up that non-flower
no hmm is that that's peanuts a mango
don't see any jackfruit oh wait what are
these oh yeah a lot of interesting stuff
lots of interesting stuff here whoa
there's like geese eggs
look fish babe come on they're just
little fishies it's just like freezing
in there and it smells weird and it's
like cold and dark and scary kind of
scary this lady's got her foot up on her
dashboard and her nail polish matches
her car
oh hello that good we're looking at
trash cans for our diaper setup and we
like this one cuz it's then and it has a
flip thing but look at this the lid is
so big it puts this huge gust of wind in
your face and we're thinking that's
probably not gonna be very good for
Missy she's gonna stop on it and then
throw up into it Missy before you do
yeah just sure that's true some of the
smaller lid
he took a pit stop at Starbucks and it's
a good thing we came with you wait
because now there's a line forming out
the door do you see how busy it is no we
