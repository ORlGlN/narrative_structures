- I'm going to take Ollie
to the doctor with me
so that he can show me
how to be brave, right?
- Yeah.
-  I don't have to be afraid?
- 'Cause I telled him.
- He told me, "you have to be brave daddy"
"and you can do it."

-  Good morning
boys, where are we going?
- To Hawaii!
- We're going to Hawaii?
- Yeah!
-  No.
- It looks like we're going to Hawaii.
- It does look like
you're going to Hawaii.
You wish though.
Actually, ever since Missy and I
went to Hawaii the last
time, Ollie's always like,
"I want to go to Hawaii".
- I want to take him to Hawaii.
-  Aww.
- It would be so fun.
We're gonna do so many
fun trips this summer.
-  You guys excited for fun trips?
- Yeah!
-  All right, but
you're all ready for what?
- Ah, wet tongue!
-  Luna's licking his toes.
Where are you actually going today Ollie?
- Swim class.
-  Swim class!
Your new swim class.
You're gonna do so good
like you did last time?
- Yeah.
(laughs)
- Luna.
- And today Mimi and
papa are gonna take you.
Isn't that fun?
- Cool.
Want to go have some
fun with Mimi and Papa?
- Yeah!
- All right, these boys
are actually really excited
for swim class, it's hilarious.
- I love you guys!
- I love you too buddy.
All right boys are off with Mimi
and Papa to go to swim class.
(dramatic synth rock music)
So today is going to be interesting
because we are actually getting ready
to head to a doctor's
appointment for myself.
For those of you who didn't see,
I'll have it linked above in the eye card.
But I had an accident about a week ago,
where I actually fell, in the morning.
I fainted, actually, I passed out.
I was unconscious.
A couple of different times.
I woke up with paramedics around me,
who basically said I could have fainted,
it could have been something else.
They wanted me to go check for
seizure activity in my brain.
A whole lot was going on at that time.
And so we have now scheduled
a doctor's appointment.
So I'm going to talk to a doctor.
I'm probably gonna tell them the story
and see if, you know, they
have any answers for me
or anything else that we
can do moving forward.
If we have to, get my brain checked.
If we have to get my blood checked,
and my heart checked or something.
So that this doesn't happen again.
Because it was a very scary experience,
and it's not something
I want happening often.
All right so we dropped
Finn off at Mimi and Papa's,
and we've decided I'm going
to take Ollie to the doctor
with me so that he can show
me how to be brave, right?
- Yeah.
-  I don't have to be afraid?
- 'Cause I telled him.
- He told me, "You have
to be brave daddy,"
"and you can do it."
The doctor's is definitely
not my favorite thing.
I don't really like
talking about my health.
Or getting needles poked in me,
or anything like that, do I?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
This is gonna be fun, right?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Okay.
We're going into the doctor.
- Yeah.
- We are actually at the
doctor's office right now
that my cousin Tara-Lynn works.
Which is actually very convenient,
'cause I'm like, hey can we get in?
And then it's like,
she sees us right away.
- Yeah.
- Which actually we didn't say,
but she just got accepted
into a PA school,
so she's now going to school
to be a physician's assistant.
So now she's like our family doctor.
She kind of already is.
We already asked her all the questions.
- I know I'm always like what's this?
- What's wrong with me?
And she's like, "Nothing."
Anyways, so, we're excited.
Ollie got a little nervous, so he's just
gonna watch the iPhone and
not pay attention to anything.
Just zone out baby.
(laughs)
(suspenseful music)
All right, we just finished.
And we're just hanging out with Tara-Lynn
while she was taking all his vitals.
- Yeah.
She was checking my
chart and she was like,
"Oh wait, have you ever
been in here before?"
and I was like, "No, never".
And she was like, "Well
there's a note about you."
And I was like, "What,
there's a note in my chart?"
-  And she's like
"I didn't write it."
It's like she didn't write it.
- It says, "popular YouTube star."
I'm like what?
(laughing)
- So someone saw us and
wrote that in the chart.
Now someone did see us
in the doctor's office.
-  Someone who worked here, yeah.
- Yeah someone in the
doctor's office did see us
and did like say hi or something,
I think that they must
have told the front desk
that we're like on YouTube
and so he puts in the chart
"Popular YouTube star"
(laughs)
Tara's like, "I'm gonna delete that."
I'm like, "thanks."
(laughs)
- Yeah I don't know.
-  We don't need that attention.
So funny though.
- All right, so we just got
out of my doctor's appointment,
and it was pretty uneventful.
They basically just said
that I need to go to see a neurologist.
They don't think that it was orthostatic.
- Yeah the only other, I think
they think it's a vasovagal,
which is what I kind of suspected too.
- Sounds like it is.
So yes, now they made me a recommendation
to go see a neurologist, so
I guess that's what's next
on this journey of finding
out what's wrong with me.
Boo!
(laughs)
Did I scare you Ollie?
I actually did.
- That was scary?
- Sorry.
Another day, another horse store, huh?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for a western curb bit.
- Do you want to see a toy horse?
-  Oh you're looking for a bit.
And you see toys?
- Yeah over there.
- Let me see.
- It's horses.
- Just a quick trip to the
horse store, apparently.
Yeah.
You see some toys?
-  Yeah.
-  Whoa, these are cool.
- Rainbow horsey!
-  Whoa, that's cool.
That is a lot of horse figurines.
(laughs)
Yeah I think that one's a little too big.
Ollie what are those?
- Salt lamps.
Remember I have one of these?
-  Yeah but it's
actually not a lamp Ollie,
it's just a big ol' piece of salt.
- You know how Nacho
likes to lick so much.
He probably would love that.
-  Wait, have you
tried giving him salt?
- I actually haven't, no.
-  You should I
bet he would like it.
- I totally could.
- Yeah.
This is, it literally looks like
the salt lamp you used to have though.
That's so funny.
Okay, I was literally standing
here going what smells?
It's these balls.
This one smells like vanilla.
This one is like, more fruity.
-  That's blueberry.
- Blueberry!
That's what it is.
-  Yellow is banana.
-  Ollie smell this one.
What's is smell like?
- Vanilla, chocolate!
-  Yeah, this is a plain
one, this one has no smell.
(tender piano music)
- Why is the lobster taped up?
-  So they don't pinch you.
Do you know that people eat these?
- No.
-  Is that weird?
- Yeah.
-  That is a lot of lobster huh?
You want to see?
See all those lobsters?
- Yeah.
-  Isn't that crazy?
- My lemonade tastes like lobster.
- It tastes like lobster?
(laughs)
- How does it taste like lobster?
- Because mine taste's like lobster.
- Finn I missed you all day!
- Yeah.
- Did you hang out with
Mimi and Papa today?
- Yeah.
-  How fun!
We are home now and we're
checking out our fishies.
And they're doing so good.
And check out Patrick.
He is still so happy.
What does he do?
All day?
- He climbs.
- He literally climbs all over this tank.
You'll see him somewhere
different all the time, huh?
I actually have footage
of him, he crawled down,
he went up the rock, down the rock,
and then went up the side of the back.
It was crazy, it was the coolest thing.
This guy is so cool.
And he's moving even when
you don't think he's moving.
And so is Dory, look at Dory over there.
She went right into the group perfectly,
and they've accepted her, and she's so,
she just fits right in
with all the others.
We love our little fishies, huh?
- Yeah.
- Climb over!
-  You are so cute.
You're a cute fishie too, okay?
My little Finn.
- Our crabs are doing really good.
-  Oh yeah.
Well we don't have, oh do we have crabs?
No we don't have crabs,
we have little sand crabs.
They are like sand crabs.
And little snails, and we have shrimp,
and we have all the fish,
and all the things, huh?
-  Yeah.
- But anyways it is almost bedtime.
We had such a fun day, huh?
- Yeah.
- And I missed you Finn!
Yeah and my mom and dad
took them to swim today
and they said that they did so good
and that Finn is this close
to floating on his back
all by himself, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  The teacher said
that she was letting go of him
just for a few seconds, and
he was actually floating.
So you're this close to
just doing it on your own.
How exciting.
And you're doing good,
all you have to do is
work on your kicks, huh?
- Yeah.
- Right now Ollie is working
on like, multitasking.
He's like, "It's really
hard to do your hands"
"and kick and do them all properly."
But he's starting to catch on.
And you're teacher's so awesome, huh?
- I missed Finn.
- Did you miss him today?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- They missed each other.
Finn got in the car and he was
like, "Hi Ollie, hi Ollie!"
You're so cute.
But anyways we're gonna end the vlog.
Make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up
if you enjoyed it.
Say thumbs up!
(laughs)
And we will see you guys tomorrow!
What do you say Ollie?
- Bye, boop.
-  Oh Finn's turn, can you do it?
Say bye.
- Bye.
(upbeat instrumental music)
