I want to clarify something ah okay okay
we just want that literally stop the
mill the road missing
hey guys good morning today I am up
early getting ready for breakfast I mean
getting ready for work and I just had
breakfast actually I looked over and saw
that I had my breakfast which is cereal
as usual I'm pretty boring in the
morning when it comes to breakfast food
but yeah then I just did my makeup so I
gotta go get dressed and ready for my
day which is super busy headed to a
doctor's appointment and I get to see my
baby so I'm very excited about that and
I had I get to fill my bump date today
so I get really excited on things like
this karma it so cute sleeping with your
daddy I don't know what people ate all
right it's time to tame this Mane here
we go all right I think that's done i
sat way too long on the couch so now I
am in a hurry and need to leave like in
five minutes well five minutes ago call
me sometimes is like a cat check them
out
why are you sleeping during the day
buddy come on did I wake you up all
right guys so this morning I am at 13
pounds total weight loss so far that is
6% of my original body weight and I am
so stoked all right guys so I'm headed
to the grocery store now and I need to
find a large plum
for Missy's bumpty today we're filming
the baby is actually the size of a large
plum so that's really really cool it's
getting like a lot bigger bigger by the
day so let me see if they got one
so the lady told me they actually threw
all the plums away because I guess it's
not kalam season but then I told her
what we were using it for and she's
going to the back to see if she's got
some because she feels really bad
alright so plums are definitely out of
season I don't know what we're gonna do
cuz we need to get it for the bumps
along the way vlog the lady was so nice
though she went back and like searched
the trash and see if she could find the
ones that they threw away but no cigar
so I'm gonna head over to another store
and see if they have flops
hey I know that they're out of season
but do you guys have any prunes wait oh
I'm sorry it's a plum all right um I
guess I'll just keep looking around
thank you okay hi I know that they're
out of season but I was just wondering
if you guys had any large plums in any
lost you what is it plum yeah well swap
lungs out they're big I'm having the
hardest time just trying to find a
produce department here there they are
well that's the right side so I say
that's about the same size is alive
alright so I went ahead and got the
plums cuz I just don't know where we're
gonna find these in reality the baby's
probably actually a little bit bigger
than these but and then I got myself a
banana cuz I really needed a snack
I've always known Ralph's to be like the
worst grocery store and they seriously
are like forever to check out I had two
things that took forever and there's
like the scuzziest people hanging out
that are out out by the doors like
there's a drug deal going on it it's
probably the only time that I ever go to
a Ralph's let's banana is actually
pretty good though
I'll give them that
headed to our doctor's appointment so
I'm really looking forward to that I'm
gonna
see the baby hopefully and I should be
really exciting get to see like the
growth and ya doing and then later we'll
film our bump date and talk all about it
and right now I am having really bad
stretching pain
so it's kind of painful right now oh and
in the backseat
also because Brian gets very very
carsick and I don't get carsick so I let
him in the front because it's so nice
I watched yesterday's vlog and I want to
just clarify something
okay okay we just saw like that
literally stopped in the road
interesting okay I want to clarify
something Brian said how I hate flowers
and hate cards and I wanted to explain
why yes
I don't hate flowers or cards um I just
feel like they're not there is the word
insensitive in person personable
fashionable personal impersonal not the
word yeah okay
they're impersonal um and I don't really
like flowers
anyways I mean they're pretty but like I
said they do die so that's kind of plain
um but I also don't like cards because
they're just written words that another
company wrote so it's not like I'm like
oh wow you're so sweet you just wrote
like the nicest thing to me I would
rather know a nice note would be super
nice so that's why I don't like cards
and but what if the card is saying
exactly what I wanted to say no it
doesn't count then just say it just
you're just right those were don't know
you just you can't use someone else's
words and say that's exactly what you
want to say it just doesn't work
the center home yeah she was just not
feeling well everyone in their sister
has flu when I heard her puke in the
back oh my god you got to go home go and
she's 62 so I know she's not pregnant
okay because it's in the water you have
a beautiful baby with a beautiful
heartbeat that's flickering along right
there
so that's just fantastic you are doing
awesome mama I'm just going to take a
measurement of this peanuts and now
literally we're talking about a baby
that's basically even bigger than a
peanut you have five point five
centimeters that's bigger than a golf
ball right now that's awesome picture
that then also I love this black stuff
around baby I want to see at least a
pocket of twenty millimeters and that's
double that so babies I said hydrated
you're keeping things that way I will
give you a picture of this peanut and
then look moving Aruban I mean yeah
we're talking about oh my gosh wait
that's that's awesome let me see that
too so again that's that's I have what
we call cautious optimism
you know however now that you're really
almost out of the first trimester more
than just cautious you know we can start
getting excited can I give you a waving
picture too
and then talking about lower so bottom
line is things of no good
literally go and now honestly if
somebody tried to scan Sega she like my
uterus or not it would be very hard to
tell because
Antos can't see em they're cost um is it
possible to get like a really incest not
possible it's mandatory okay right now
soon they have to get one of those but
he wants to do but so we're doing an
in-depth skin on a tiny tiny thing like
it but maybe more like looking at her
uterus I think she wants that good bad I
think it's real good idea too but it's
mandatory that we do that for baby's
sake as we get further along too and so
we will do that but I'll have the girls
such up with a perinatologist
I gotta get the seats but we'll set that
up between now and it's Emily she looks
so cool seeing them move around yeah
waiting at us that's cool
and how do you know him oh I don't know
yeah so we just got home from the
ultrasound appointment um that was
really really cool like the baby was
moving and wiggling and anything like
that but um it's like a long drive like
the doctor's office is like 30 minutes
away and it was full of traffic and
whitey roads and it's so like we were
all like so carsick but we just got home
and now Missy is throwing up in the
bathroom right now I feel so bad and
carmen was like sitting right next to
her as she was throwing up on karma
she's been really good on morning
sickness lately like she hasn't had a
whole lot of it so I don't know how much
of this is from being pregnant or from
the drive okay perfect thank you alright
okay
not the bar the past information on you
homicide right now because we're
scheduling his hair appointment gonna
get in here come on home so we're going
to start filming her bump day but first
I have to get a couple pictures of the
plum which is the size of the baby this
week it's 12 weeks so we have all the
plums set up perfectly and now we're
just going to take some pictures of it
so I'm using the soft boxes perlite and
then I'm also using a flash on the
camera just so I get a really really
good feel light so let's take a couple
pictures
yeah looks cool and they're actually
like kind of black in real life and they
show up a little like they're purpley
color like plums are supposed to be so
all right so we finished everything that
we needed to film for her intro and now
Missy's just getting ready to sit down
and talk you have your phone and
everything you want to say Carmen thinks
this is a ball you think it's a ball I'm
not thinking oh I can hear myself or
this ears so it kind of sounds like I'm
on a microphone - all right so we just
finished filming that bump date for the
bumps along the way which means I have a
lot to do tonight actually it's getting
been getting a lot easier editing my
wife's blogs and stuff on her other
channel so I'm just complaining so I'm
gonna start editing all that so I can
get to bed at a decent time tonight
because I was up way too late yesterday
so we will see you guys tomorrow
