- We got a Jawa in our vicinity.
- Peekaboo.
-  Bet you didn't
know Jawas played peekaboo.
♫ Wherever you are
♫ That's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ "This is home"
♫ Just running around
♫ You never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight
♫ Cuddlin' all I could saying
♫ "I am home"
♫ And forever you're with me
- Good morning.
- Good morning Kyle,
you hanging out with Ben?
He's being a very nice boy
this morning, isn't he?
We got breakfast at the
little snack station up here.
They have, like, cereal and sticky buns,
little egg frittatas.
What are we doing today buddy?
- We're going on more rides.
- We're going on more rides, aren't we?
Missy's rocking her bow ears this morning.
She also got very
creative in the snack bar,
and stuffed a croissant
with ham and swiss,
and then burnt it.
- It's a little burnt.
- And I got this idea from Luke,
it's a ham and swiss bagel sandwich.
Oh hey, it's Carl.
Good morning.
- What's up?
- You ready for another day?
- Dude, I'm so ready.
- Dude, we slept so good.
- I'm exhausted but ready.
- I think we slept, like, over nine hours.
It was absolutely
incredible and much needed
because yesterday was a lot.
You're all rested right?
Hey, who we gonna meet today Ollie?
- I want to meet Captain
Jake and the pirates.
- You want to meet Captain Jake?
Yeah, you can show him
your pirate sword, huh?
(orchestral music)
We are in Hollywood Studios today,
and I am so excited because
the first ride we are
headed to is Midway Mania,
Toy Story arcade shooter, so much fun,
and Dave, our guide,
is going to give me
all the tips and tricks
on how to score big, right?
You're going to share your tips, right?
- Oh, yeah. But not all of them.
- We can hear Beauty and
the Beast over there,
the live show.
We have Carthay Circle theater right here.
- You know, this is a lot
like California Adventure.
- Yeah, well California Adventure
has a Hollywood Studios,
so it's kind of similar.
- Bigger version of that part of it.
- Yeah. Totally.
Hollywood Studios is where
all the movie themed stuff is,
so they have lots of Star Wars stuff here,
there's an Indiana Jones show,
Beauty and the Beast,
stuff like that.
And lots of Palm Trees,
so we're basically back in California now.
- We've got a full sized replica
of the Chinese Theater.
- Oh, wow.
- I just got goosebumps.
We are now headed into
the Pixar Studios section
of Hollywood Studios.
And look at the little monkeys, dude.
The monkeys in a barrel.
- Dude, they are. Right there.
- Barrel of monkeys.
Look how cool this is.
Ollie, we're in Pixar Studios,
so there's going to be a
ton of Toy Story stuff.
Look at that right there!
It's Mr. Spell.
Do you remember that?
- Yeah.
- Isn't that cool?
And then look up there. Monkeys!
How neat is that?
- The rest of the day,
you're going to hear
me talk about the story
as we're going into rides
because some of them are really cool.
So, the idea about this one is all about
how you've been shrunk
down to the size of a toy,
and Buzz and Woody have been inviting you
to play some old-school
carnival games with them, okay?
- We are the size of a toy Luke.
Look at that.
Just finished the Midway Mania ride.
Ollie did so good.
He got 23,000 points.
That was, I think, a record for you Ollie.
I got 159,000.
I'm really excited to
see what our guide got.
He was doing a bit of trash
talking before we got in here.
Was that fun Ollie?
- Yeah. Can you shoot this?
- He's still shooting you guys.
Alright, Dave. What was your score?
- Uh, 232. That wasn't
even my best, come on.
- Oh! I did a modest 159.
He did 23,000.
We got fans. Got to keep cool.
Hey Ollie, look what I got.
Does that feel good?
- Yeah. I want it.
- You want it? Here you go.
Spray a little bit on yourself.
Oh, don't spray Mr. Potato Head.
- Halt!
- Excuse me. Pardon me.
Who did we just find?
- Captain Jake.
- Oh, my gosh.
We're going to go see your show Jake.
- Bye.
- Ollie, that was Jake.
That was so cute.
Alright, we are headed into the
Disney Junior Live on Stage.
- I want to tell my people.
- You want to tell your people?
He wants to tell his friends.
- We'll tell your friends.
- You want to tell them?
- Who did you just run into?
- Captain Jake.
Ah, snow in my eyes.
- Ollie just made it snow.
- Yeah, and it's all in my eyes.
- Look at Finn's hat.
You look so cute!
Yeah, that will help with the sun Buddy.
Ollie keeps complaining about the sun,
that's why he's staying in the store.
-  You want a hat?
- So as you guys know, Ollie
loved meeting Ariel yesterday,
and one thing that they
don't have in California,
is the Ariel live performance.
So we're headed in to
go see the live show.
Alright, we are headed
into Star Wars Launch Bay.
We're going to go meet
someone really cool.
Who could be over here?
He's big, huh?
Ollie was a little
hesitant with Chewbacca,
he's met him before and he liked him.
- Yeah, it's just you never
know how he's gonna respond.
- Yeah.
- Finn, on the other hand,
was like, interested,
but then scared out of his mind.
- Yeah.
Hey Ollie, do you see BB-8?
Do you see him?
Here, whoa! Isn't that cool?
Hey Ollie do you want to go
meet the bad guy from Star Wars?
Yeah?
- Welcome citizens, this way.
- Ollie's hiding already.
Hello Kylo.
He's so spooky looking.
Oh, my gosh. Look at Ollie.
Ollie pull out your blaster.
No?
He's like, I don't know.
- By the way, my name's Luke.
Just so you know.
- Uh-oh.
Go talk to him.
Go talk to him, Luke.
It's okay.
You have to do it. It's your destiny.
It's your destiny.
- His name's Finn.
- Say bye.
Oh, yeah, we got Finn
and a Luke, don't we?
We have a Finn and a Luke.
We got a Jawa in our vicinity.
- Look at this guy.
- Watch out, he'll try to sell our bag.
- No, I know what he wants.
Jawas like shiny things.
- Ooh!
- I know. No, you don't
want that today, alright.
- Oh, peekaboo.
- Bet you didn't know
Jawas played peekaboo.
We are now by the theater,
so Dave, tell me,
what's, is all this real?
- all of these are actually,
yes, legitimate and real.
- Were the stars right here
doing them, or they were bought?
- Yeah, no they were all
right here, done right here.
- That's so cool.
Danny DeVito?
- Yes.
- He has tiny hands.
George Lucas,
C3PO.
There's a lot of really cool ones.
Steve Martin.
Gina Davis.
This is crazy.
It literally feels
like we're in the middle
of Hollywood right now.
Oh, Ollie. Storm Troopers are coming.
Acting all cool.
- We are on our way.
Back to base.
That is affirmative.
- Happy birthday Mickey.
That's cute.
Babe I'm pretty sure
you and I have a picture
next to one of these at
the real one in Hollywood.
Isn't that funny?
So, from Hollywood Studios to Epcot.
We are now in Epcot,
and they have this really
cool thing going on
called the Flowering Garden Festival.
They have a lot of different
topiaries and flowers
decorated like Disney characters,
and I'm going to show you guys right now,
because these are pretty incredible.
So here at Epcot, you can
travel the whole world
just by walking around a manmade lagoon.
We went straight to Italy
because let's face it,
that's my favorite right?
- My favorite.
- Just give us a little taste of Italy,
before we actually travel there ourselves.
It's time for some food, you guys.
We're starving.
- We might be all a little hangry.
- Yeah. It's been awhile.
We are stopping at Italy to get some food.
- When they were building all
of these different countries,
they wanted to showcase
the cultures of the world,
one of the coolest things about this was
they decided that they wanted
to have an African nation,
they decided that Morocco
was going to be represented,
but when they talked to Morocco about it,
they said, well if you want
to create something with
authentic Moroccan feel,
and you want to create a marketplace,
in order to do that,
you need it to be built by Moroccans.
So this pavilion was actually built
by representatives of Morocco,
they brought them across,
had them build it,
so that it was built
in an authentic manner.
As we walk in, you're also going to see
a big opening where it
looks like one big opening,
and then on either side,
it's got a smaller opening,
which is actually the
entranceway to a marketplace
with humans on the side.
It's called a babu jelou.
- Babu jelou.
We are now in France,
so guess who's here Babe.
It's Belle.
She's got quite a line.
Belle is very popular right now,
for obvious reasons.
- Who is that?
- That's Belle.
- That's Belle.
- Alright Dave.
We need an explanation on the golf ball.
- So Spaceship Earth is the largest
geodesic sphere in the world.
But, really, there aren't
that many geodesic spheres,
so it's not a huge
competition to be winning.
There are 11,324 triangles on
the outside of Spaceship Earth
- And inside is what?
- An attraction where you get to explore
the history of the world,
and you get to listen to
the soft, dulcet tones
of Dame Judi Dench.
- There you go.
So we've just been walking around Epcot,
exploring all of the
different places of the world.
We did ride an amazing ride called
Frozen Ever After in Norway.
If you guys want to go check that out,
head on over to Carl and Ginger's channel,
because he filmed a bunch,
but that was incredible dude.
Olaf.
- Carl bought all the
goodies at the Frozen store.
- I filmed Bryan filming the
flowers that you saw already.
- Yes, so be sure to
go check out that vlog,
link down below in the description,
so you can see a different perspective
of this whole trip.
- Thanks man. Appreciate it.
- We are now going on the
seas with Nemo and friends,
with all of our friends.
Hey, Ollie,
how many skittles do you
have in your mouth right now?
Show me. Let me see.
Yeah, he's enjoying himself.
Come on dude, let's go see Nemo.
♫ We're getting in a giant clamshell
This is a nice ride to be
riding after a long, hot day
I feel like.
Just got out of the Finding Nemo ride.
Check this out, Bruce's Sub House, whoa!
Finn, you're going to fit
right in, with your fins.
Look at all these cool sharks.
Yeah, the Finding Nemo ride was very cool,
and we all just climbed
into that giant shark
and got a picture, which I'll put here.
(camera shutters)
what can you see in there?
See what he's doing with his legs?
Hey, Ollie, are you
doing the pee-pee dance?
You're kind of doing the
pee-pee dance, aren't you?
- I see sharks.
- You see sharks? I want to see.
You can kind of see sharks, huh?
That's cool.
Fireworks going crazy!
And that was the end of our
Disney World experience,
well not quite.
We might head back
tomorrow for a little bit,
but just want to say a
huge thank you to the
Walt Disney World VIP tour and Dave
for being such an amazing tour.
That was incredible right?
- So amazing.
- That's how you do Disney guys.
So cool that we are able to offer this,
not just to our kids, but to our friends.
It's been a pretty amazing couple of days.
We're headed back to the hotel now,
we're going to go to bed,
but thank you guys for watching,
be sure to subscribe and
check out more videos,
we'll see you mañana.
Okay, Finn.
Say bye.
