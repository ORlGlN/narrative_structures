- Hey, Olly, Fin, I have
someone who wants to say hi!
- I tell you, it is so hard
to grocery shop with two kids.
(laughs)
- I heard about what
happened at the store, Fin.
You're a crazy boy, you know that?
- Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)
♫ This is our life, this is
our fun, this is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is
our team, shot among the stars,
♫ Take this shield, and we'll be fine,
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine,
♫ (This is our life) Let's
live it, live it forever!
- Good morning guys, say good morning Fin!
- Mor-ih
- Morning! Olly, say morning!
- Good morning.
- Good morning! How's your day been?
- Good.
- Good! It is a beautiful Monday morning,
it's October 16th, and it is
100 degrees today! (laughs)
It is actually so warm
out, these boys are like,
have to be in like, little tiny rompers,
because it is a warm, warm day.
And that's just how it is,
like October and November
can be like, confusing,
because you never know
what kind of a day it's gonna be like.
If it's gonna be a day
to wear like, a sweater,
or a tank top, it could
be literally either.
And today is definitely
a tank top kind of day.
I'm not wearing a tank top,
but it is definitely very, very warm.
But, our day has just
gotten started really late,
so Bryan is now getting
work done in the office,
so I think I'm just
gonna take the boys out
and go have some fun outside of the house.
Probably get some errands
done, like grocery shopping.
- We going to the, the play area we play!
- Yeah, he's really excited,
I think I'm gonna take them
to go play, I think we're
gonna head out now, you ready?
- Yeah.
- 'Kay, let's do it!
Karma good morning, how
are you, how are you?!
By the way, if you guys don't know,
Luna is in heat right now,
she kinda has to be separated,
and we take her on walks a
lot because she's not able
to like, play a lot out here,
because these two are not
allowed to be together
because Karma is a boy,
and he's so naughty with her,
and yes, Karma is neutered.
She's been in heat now for
over a month, over a month,
I'm saying like, six weeks now.
She is away right now,
and hopefully almost done,
so we can let her out
again so she can play.
Huh boy? Let's go.
So we just got loaded up in the car,
and Olly just asked me the cutest thing,
what did you say?
- Can I take a nap Mama? On the way there?
- Yeah, of course you can take a nap!
Are you gonna try to go to sleep now?
- Yeah.
- Okay, good night!
- Ha! Just kidding!
- He was just kidding that
time, but he will take a nap.
He's like, "Can I take a nap?"
and he literally is like...
He like, was trying to fall asleep,
I think he'll totally fall
asleep on the way there, 'kay?
See ya in a few minutes!
So, turns out Olly didn't take a nap,
I thought you were gonna go to sleep!
- I forgot.
- You forgot, oh, he's sad now.
And now, Olly, show them
what you learned how to do!
- I just unbuckle this by when I...
- He really wants to show you guys.
Um, yeah, he learned how
to unbuckle the first
part of his clip, which
he's super good to not
do it until we're parked and
stop, so that's always good.
But, I'm really proud of him! (laughs)
You're excited that you can do that part?
He can't do the second part,
so he's just stuck there.
But you know who did
end up falling asleep?
That one, he's like, back there snoring,
and we're here, and I
thought, maybe we'll just kill
some time and let him sleep
a little bit longer before
we go inside and go play, okay?
And, no, I was not lying,
it is actually 106 degrees!
Oh my gosh! Poor little dude, so tired.
Look who's up and ready to play!
Check this out, we get
to have a little date!
They have food here, and so
they are getting a little
peanut butter and jelly and some fruit,
and they are happy, happy kids, huh?!
I think it's so awesome that
they have food and a play area.
Like, that is so nice, and
they even have food for me,
they're gonna make me like,
some chicken nuggets and stuff, so, yay!
- And they have chocolate milk!
- We're killing two birds with one stone,
eating lunch and playing, huh?!
Alright guys, we had a
blast at the playground,
and now I am at JoAnn's
and JoAnn's is like,
a fabric, craft store.
I am actually attempting to
make Fin's Halloween costume
this year, and I'm
really nervous about it.
I did make Olly's costume,
I believe, when he was two,
for his Halloween, so I'm
basically doing the same thing
for Olly, or for Fin, but
it is a different costume.
So, I'm basically
collecting all these things,
I'm making it completely from scratch,
I do not have anything to go
by, I'm very nervous about it,
I am pretty good when it
comes to things like this,
like, making it up as I go,
hopefully it turns out though.
Hey, why do you got so much styrofoam?
Do you need styrofoam?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? So, one thing's for
sure, when I'm doing projects
like these, I tend to not
know exactly what I'm doing,
but I usually figure it out,
but it takes me a long time.
I have been standing in
front of the buttons,
I swear, for like fifteen
minutes, and I cannot figure out
what button I am supposed to get.
I just want like, a snappy
button, for like, right here,
and I can't find it, I'm
probably staring right at it,
and I just don't know where
to look, which one is it?!
There's so many buttons!
I had no idea there were this
many buttons, like, seriously.
So, I feel so silly, I finally
ended up asking someone,
because I was staring at
those buttons, I was like,
"I don't get it, none of
them seem to like, work,
it's like it's only one
side, and I don't see
the other side that snaps into it!"
Turns out the little button
is snapped on to the paper!
Can you guys see? So that
is the back of the button,
and that's the back of the button,
and they're snapped onto
the paper, I feel so silly.
So anyways, finally figured that out,
and I think we are about
done, so we're headed out now.
Buh bye Fin!
- Bye!
- Have fun! He's like,
totally fine with it, uh oh!
You're about to go on a ride! Bye!
Mama's gonna go bye bye, 'kay?
- 'kay.
- See you later! I always do this to him,
so now he just doesn't even care.
(gasp) I almost left you in there huh!
- Yeah!
- Yeah! 'Kay, I'm going! Buh bye! Buh bye!
- Bye!
- (laughs) He still doesn't care!
You just don't believe Mama anymore huh?!
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you know I'm gonna get you huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)
You're so cute! Okay, c'mon
bud, I can't leave you here.
What, now you just want to stay?
You spent the entire time in the store
demanding to get out of the cart,
and now that it's time to get
out, you don't wanna get out?
- No.
- Alright, grab 'em. Good job!
We are now grocery shopping,
and I gotta tell you,
it is so hard to grocery
shop with two kids.
I was really hoping to get
the cart that has like,
the two seats in it, so I have like,
the cart that I can fill up,
but it was not available.
And so now I have one
running around the store
trying to help me out,
and this one sitting here,
trying to climb out.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to get this shopping done,
is it too cold over in this section?
Alright, I was able to contain them
both in this little cart, one leg out.
That actually helps because
Fin gets very jealous
because Olly's running around,
but he wants to run around.
So hopefully we can just finish
up the last of our shopping
and be done, I think I
got all my groceries done,
I just have to get the other
items that is always like,
a pain! I still have
to grab like, tissues,
cleaning supplies, and all that stuff.
These boys! One minute they're fighting,
the next minute, they're
like, hugging each other,
and kissing each other, I just can't.
In a second this is gonna
turn into a fight. Here we go.
Okay, don't be so rough with him.
Hey, are you guys being loving and nice?
- Mmhmm.
- No!
- No? Oh my goodness! We're so close!
I'm out of room in the cart,
and I still need a few more things.
- No, no, no!
- Oh, I wanna see your mouth.
- Ahhhhhhh.
(Missy laughs)
Car is loaded up, and yes it is dark out.
I have been shopping all day!
I'm so ready to go home, let's go home.
Hey Olly, are you awake?
Hey bud? Are you awake?
Yeah, you're awake? Are you awake?
- Yeaaahhhhhhhhhhhh.
- Yeah? You kinda look
like you're sleeping bud.
Bud? Hey bud, you're not
answering, can you hear me?
- Mmmmmmmm.
- Well hey, Fin! Did you
go shopping with Mama?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? How did it go?
- Good.
- Did it go good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Did you almost
get left at the store?
I heard about what
happened at the store, Fin.
You're a crazy boy, you know that?
- Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)
- I'm glad you're safe though.
Karma definitely sees something
in our garage under here.
He's acting crazy.
Our garage is actually
a mess right now because
we're sorting through Halloween stuff,
decoration, costumes, party stuff.
We have so much Halloween
stuff that we're getting down
for the big Halloween party,
for decorating, all that fun stuff.
So yeah, our garage is a mess right now.
(upbeat music)
What are you doing over here, Olly?
Are you counting your money?
Do you want me to tell you how
much money you've got there?
- They're my pennies Fin.
-  Fin trying to take your pennies?
- Mmhmmmmmmm.
- Okay, let me tell you what you have,
you have two quarters, those are actually,
that's not a quarter,
that is something else.
So, in American money, you have a quarter,
you have a nickel, you have a dime,
and you have three pennies,
but this one over here
is not American money,
you know what that is?
- What?
-  I think that
this is from London.
- London? We go to London last time.
-  We did go to London huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, have
you been keeping that?
- Yeah.
-  It's a part of his
money collection you guys.
- So I can play a game.
- He's got 43 cents, um, so
I don't know if he's gonna
be able to play a game with that,
but this is a lot of money to you, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, that's a
lot of money to some kids,
some kids don't have 43 cents.
- Yeah, so I can play games.
-  Yeah, you can play
games with the money, 'kay?
- Okay.
-  What's going
on with Mr. Grumpy Gills?
- He wants the two percent milk.
-  Really?
- It's whole milk, and I'm like,
"Okay, let me go do it"
and then I like, did it,
and then, you want it?
- Mmm mmm.
-  So he requested
something special
and you faked him out?
- Mmhmmm
-  And he's calling it?
- He saw it.
-  Fin is Mr. Particular.
If he doesn't get the milk
he wants, if he doesn't
get the cup he wants,
it just makes for a very grumpy Fin.
- I was doing this! Glug,
glug, glug, glug, glug!
-  Oh yeah, she's filling it up!
-  I filled it up! That looks good!
- He's saying, no you
didn't. No you didn't!
You guys, look what showed up today!
It's my own personal Porg
from the new Star Wars movie,
which Olly and I are so excited about.
Olly saw him in the trailer,
so I had to get one.
So I'm gonna show the boys
and see what they think
of this little guy, look how cool that is,
it's just a simple little toy.

Oh, Fin does not like him.

-  Oh no, oh no! I just saved him!
Here he comes, here he comes!
