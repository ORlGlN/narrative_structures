he can do all of it on the iPad yeah
look at the setup like this is a sweet
setup yeah he can pretty much okay this
is pretty it's really hard though cuz I
don't normally see myself when I do the
video and now you can see yourself so I
can't help but like look down and like
check myself every once well which is
distracting and you can't do that doing
 yourself down before you wreck
yourself
go get some subway I'm hungry okay yeah
I'm starving too
gotta shut this door I've got my hands
full so I'm gonna use my foot I am
pretty much a mess right now I just kind
of threw some makeup on through my hair
up put some clothes on stuff my pants
inside my coat my sock because my pants
are really long and just went on with my
day and I thought that's pretty good I
should probably put on some clothes
that's up you gonna take the pinky do
you want it just like my dad he's like
no I'm okay right now
look
my ball or wife you guys if you look so
cute
look at what wifey punch it over like
that your mmm getting ready to go do a
couple things
right I got my laptop hooked up to the
big hard drive do you see okay I just
added a 4 terabyte hard drive to this
thing and the top one now is like I'm
full chained to me that's what the
little orange thing me is it diaper
change yeah and then this is like a
capacity so I literally have 9 out of 10
that are full already I think I still
have like seven hundred gigabytes very
tag nerd talk no tax so I edit on the
laptop right and this has a solid-state
drive it's like 500 so it doesn't really
hold a lot of footage well I mean I have
like two months footage in there
actually so every now and then I have to
hook it up to this thing and transfer
all the footage over there so I never
have all the footage all on my laptop so
like I just realized we have 10 days and
I really want to do a year montage video
so I have to like to be able to do that
I have to go through find the moments
that I want download the video from
YouTube and then cut it all together
right now it's basically what I call the
trifecta there are three events that
happen in a row they are so stressful
really hang on
so first there's Christmas then there's
Brian's birthday and then there's
Valentine's Day and they all come within
like weeks of each other which requires
all gifts for Brian I what is a trifecta
in every year since the day we started
dating which we started dating in
November so then there was like
Christmas and I was like crap when I
gonna get him and all sudden it was his
birthday and I was like holy crap I
don't have anything to get and then it
was Valentine's Day and I was like I'm
done
I can't have anything to give you these
three months are like the most stressful
thing for me okay and he always like
don't buy anything I don't need anything
worry about it first of all that doesn't
work because I always feel like crap
what's his birthday comes I'm like I
hadn't get ready baby
I just okay in the intro it is true that
when he wants something he finds a way
to get it I mean no I don't make it
sound like he's like a spoiled brat or
anything but like if you get if you want
something he gets it he finds a way to
buy it this is like what do I get this
kid I mean she has I can also have a
sausage Julie max can you can you just
I'm an adult I'm that kid okay but dang

go
he tends to get a little crazy with it
my goodness chin that's so freakin cute

hand to just good kill two birds with
one stone

Playtex work oh sorry sorry
here it is you guys my raspberry wheat
ale bread not beer bread its tail bread
I'm gonna cut into it and it looks like
yeah it's not ruined look at this
beautiful bread so I do think there is a
very small hint of raspberry in this and
it's kind of tasty I have a straightener
and blow-dryer and its really annoying
cuz I plug it in on the side of my sink
and it's usually just hanging down here
and there's like cords and it's really
annoying and stupid and so I was looking
for something that maybe I could like
attach right here where I can like kind
of hang off of almost like when you go
to like salons I improvise I don't know
if I like it looks how to see whit but
it's like this little suction thing that
normally goes in like the shower and I
just put it in there it looks kind of
annoying and sort of obnoxious I don't
know how long it will last but I'm gonna
ask you guys if you work in a salon or
if you know is it possible to buy
something to put like right here look at
these smiles you guys he's smiling he's
not smiling he's smiling because he's
got a binky his mouth so he smiles with
his eyes at us it's the cutest thing
