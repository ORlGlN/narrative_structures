- Good morning!
We're back home!
What about Fred?
What happened?
Show me, show me Fred!
Show me!
What?
What did he do?
Missy and I just got back from our little
winter getaway.
We had so much fun
and Finn was very excited
about Fred this morning,
weren't you?
So he did a puzzle for you?
Oh you guys had to finish it together huh?
That is so cool.
Look at that cute puzzle he brought that.
(laughs)
Fred is the best isn't he?
(upbeat music)
Looks like our Christmas
cage is doing well.
Nothing was caught last night.
If you guys missed yesterday's video
where we talk about this
and we decorate it and hang it up,
you have to go check it out.
It's in the I code above Ollie
and the boys had so
much fun decorating it.
We're really excited
to see if we can catch
anything in it
and we did catch something in it yesterday
so go check out yesterday's
vlog to see what it was
but I love this.
I think it's just cool too
'cause it kind of just adds to the
Christmas decor everywhere.
It's not too bad.
- Hi Ollie!
- Hi.
- I missed you.
Did you have fun with Mimi and Papa?
- Yeah.
- And you had fun at school?
You just got home?
Papa went and got and picked him up
and he said that he was sleeping
and did not want to wake up huh?
Are you pretty tired?
Well I'm glad you got a god nap.
We have just been having a really nice day
at home.
We've actually been working
on something really cool.
Let me show you.
We have been signing calendars.
Are you gonna sign some calendars with us?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
Yes we have been signing
lots and lots of calendars.
It's just been really fun to finally
get that done.
We want to get these
done as fast as possible
so we can get them out as possible,
especially if they're
like Christmas gifts.
We want to be able to get
them to you as possible
so we've just been signing like crazy,
just trying to get that done
and actually what we've also been doing
is listening to the wind outside.
It is so intense.
Let me show you that.
So the wind advisory for
this area is on extreme high.
It's never been this high before.
What that means is that we
are a very huge potential
of fires.
Look at my flagpole.
It does not look happy.
They're saying that the gusts right now
are reaching about 75
to 80 miles per hour.
It is really intense
and unfortunately a fire just broke out.
Look at that.
You can see it right down there.
It's pretty far away but
we have two fires now in the area.
There's four or five in LA right now
and it's just so scary.
It's so scary.
And as you guys know,
we had a fire a few
months ago near our house
and it was really scary
and with the winds like this,
anything could break out at any moment
and be very, very bad.
It could just get really bad very fast.
Yeah we are just praying that
nothing breaks out nearby
with the winds so close
but the other fires are,
they are close too.
The one that I just showed
you is actually pretty close
to my aunt's house, my Aunt Kristy
which is Jeffrey's mom,
if you guys don't know
so that's really scary.
These winds can just make them just fly.
It's just like, it's so scary.
So anyways, the wind's
just been crazy all day
so we're just listening to it
and luckily we have a pretty sturdy house
but it's still scary.
Like we got trees and
stuff and I've never seen
winds like this ever, like this bad
in this area.
It's pretty crazy.
Just hanging out with
the boys in the playroom.
Finn's playing
and I'm watching the news right now on
the myriad of fire where we live
and it is getting really bad.
It now is at 200 acres and
zero percent contained,
at least actually what it
was like 30 minutes ago
so I hope it's not any
worse but definitely
surrounded by a lot of houses
and it's just like (groans)
it's so sad and so scary
and I know at least one
house has already been
burned so just hoping it
doesn't get any worse.
So sad.
Nine, 10.
Ready or not here I come!
Where are you?
I see you!
Okay we've gotta find your brother!
Let's go find your brother!
Finn's really good at
playing hide and seek.
Wait, I heard something.
(shouts)
Did you find him?
(laughs)
Did you say cockle doodle doo?
- All right boys, guess what today is.
- What?
-  It is national
letter writing day
I was thinking on national
letter writing day
we should write a letter to Santa.
- Oh yeah.
-  Do you want to
write your letter to Santa?
- Okay so I know that
you already told Santa
that you want that Power Ranger toy right?
But now we're going to write
a letter so that you can
write down everything that you want
and he won't forget it.
We're going to send it to him okay?
Does that sound good?
- How are we going to do it?
- Well Mrs. Clause actually
sent me some official papers
that we can use to write
and what we do is we
actually will get to color
a picture and send him it
and we're going to put it
right into his little mailbox
and then Fred is going to
take it to Santa tonight.
-  Isn't that cool?
See I know you guys have been wondering
why we have this special
delivery Santa mailbox
and this thing can actually
send letters to Santa.
All right Ollie, I'm
going to help you write
your letter.
Do you want to say Hi Santa or Dear Santa?
- Dear Santa.
- Okay.
Dear Santa
and now what do you want to say?
Let's ask him how he's doing.
- Okay.
- Should we say how are you?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Dear Santa,
how are you?
I had an idea of a
question to ask him Ollie.
Since on Christmas Eve
night we're going to leave
him cookies, maybe we
should ask what his favorite
cookies are.
What is your favorite cookie?
Finn is getting started
on his Christmas letter
right now.
You just let me know
when you need the green,
okay buddy?
Actually you want to switch me?
Okay I'll take that.
Okay.
So now is the time you
tell him what you want
for Christmas Ollie.
So what do you want for Christmas?
- A new toy box.
-  A new toy box?
Why do you want a new toy box?
- For toys.
So what else do you want
to ask for Christmas buddy?
- The Power Ranger toy.
- Okay.
So I'm going to put on
here the Power Rangers toy.
He probably knows which
one you're talking about
'cause we already told him.
-  Yeah we told him.
- A floatie.
-  A floatie?
(laughs)
Okay.
What kind, do you know?
- I want a red one that
comes with a deep sea tank.
- Oh okay.
All right well we'll ask for that one too.
Anything else you want
to say or do at the end?
You want to say love Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
So I will write love and
then I'll have you sign it.
Hold this Ollie.
I'm going to help you sign your name okay?
So you need an O-l-l-I-e.
Perfect!
All right Finn already
started his Christmas letter
but we'll add a couple more
things on there for you okay?
- Okay ready?
We'll say Dear Santa,
Finn.
Yay that's your name!
-  Yay!
He's so cute.
He's so excited.
- Do you want to do a little
coloring on it really quick?
Not too much so we can still read it.
(upbeat music)
-  All right boys.
Put your letters into
this magical mailbox!
Put them on in there!
That's good.
You can put them in there.
That's the package slot.
You can also use the letter slot.
That's okay, that's okay.
It goes there.
Good job!
Now rub it on the top.
All right now tap it three times.
One, two, three.
Now blow it a kiss.
Okay none of that does nothing.
I was just making you do funny things.
(laughs)
But this is a magical mailbox
and it's going to send
your letter to Santa.
Are you excited?
(cheers)
I don't know if it flies.
- I think Fred's going to take it.
- Fred's going to take it, okay?
- Kay.
- Kay, the boys' letters
are in this magical mailbox.
Letters to Santa.
Do you remember writing letters to Santa?
What did you ask for?
- I never wrote a letter to Santa.
-  Never?
- No.
- Missy was deprived.
- Santa still came to my house
and he still delivered to us.
- Aw I remember writing letters to Santa
and I would like make it look so official
and like nice on the computer like
it was good times, good times.
Pillow fight!
(laughs)
Whoa!
He gets no pillows and you get two?
That doesn't seem fair buddy.
Is there something under this pillow?
Is there something under this pillow?
-  All right showers are done.
We're running to Ollie's room.
Ollie, Finn's going to win!
Finn's going to win!
Oh my goodness!
Finn he won!
Yay!
Say good job to Finn.
Give him a hug.
He never wins.
You are always the winner huh?
Ollie usually always wins
and I think he was like wait a second.
Why is Finn winning right now?
Pretty funny.
I'm going to go get their
advent calendars for them
so they can open them.
All right boys.
18 days 'til Christmas!
And Momma's done no Christmas shopping!
18 days!
You guys, 18 days, well 18 days for us.
That means 17 days for you guys.
Ah!
That's like not a lot of days left.
Finn what you get?
(shouts)
Dory!
You knew that!
That's such a good job!
Let's see.
Hang on.
Oh oh!
So what you just watched
was me trying to show you
the Dory and Finn actually biting me.
Well he was like playing
and he's like really sad about it.
I screamed really loud
'cause it hurt very badly
and I think it scared him.
I know.
He said I sorry Mama.
It's so sad.
You're okay.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
I love you.
All right Ollie, you show
us what you got from yours.
- I got assault guy.
-  Wow!
That is very cool.
I like things like that.
I like the mini figures.
Bed time was a little rough with the boys.
I think they were just a
little overly exhausted
and Finn was just having a rough time.
So anyways, I was going
to have them end it
but it just wasn't working so
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up if you did.
We have some really
fun plans for tomorrow.
Make sure you stay tuned and check us out
and we'll see you guys later.
Bye!
