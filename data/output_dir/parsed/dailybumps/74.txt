-  Roar!
- We should make a
chocolate dinosaur.
-  We should?
- Yeah!
- Ollie always comes up
with the greatest ideas.
Hey dinosaur, do you wanna
be made out of chocolate?
Yeah.
Who doesn't want to be
made out of chocolate?

-  Good morning!
(baby talking)
-  What was that?
- Good morning!
-  Good morning boys!
(bell dinging)
- Ahh!
Morning guys.
It's actually not quite morning.
We have had a very, very busy morning.
I actually took Ollie to school
and totally forgot the camera
and you went to school, huh?
- Yeah.
- I was like, "I thought it
was kind of early for school".
So I went all the way there and
I get to the school and no one's there.
I walk in the classroom,
no kids are there,
no teachers there and finally,
right at time that school starts,
kids started getting there.
The teacher got there, but
it was a sub and I was like,
"Are you guys doing
school?" and they were like,
"Not really, we'll probably
start school next week",
but the school is open.
So I was like, "Oh my gosh".
If I was working a job and
I needed to take him there
for a place to be, I could have done that,
but I'm like, "He doesn't
even have to be here".
So I actually let him stay
and play for a little bit,
while I got some errands done,
and then I picked him up,
pretty early, because they
were just playing, so.
Watch you?
- Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!
- Oh my gosh, you are the silliest.
I don't know if you heard that,
but he goes, "Watch me",
but he says it kind of like
you can barely understand it.
We just figured out what he was saying.
Say watch me.
Say watch me.
He does it all the time.
He's so cute.
Alright, let's go eat
some lunch, okay boys?
- Okay.
- Okay.
-  Hey Geebo, happy New Year.
-  Thanks, you too.
(party horns blowing)
Today is National Science Fiction day,
one of my favorite holidays.
-  Did you know that, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Today is National
Science Fiction day.
- Really?
- I think that means we're gonna be
watching some Star Wars later, right?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah!
Hey guys.
I cannot believe that
it is already January.
What has happened to December, you guys?
What happened to Christmas?
It all was just like I blinked
and then it was all gone.
Is this what happens now as you get older?
Yeah, it's January, New Year's starting,
and we're kind of in this
place where we're like,
"what's gonna be our next thing?
What is our next project?".
As you know, as a family we're
always working on projects.
We're always doing fun
things with the kids
and I think 2018 is gonna
be a fun one, for sure.
We'll see what happens this year.
What do you want to see us do in 2018?
Let us know down below in the comments.
Give us some suggestions
of what you think,
what would be fun for you guys
to see us do on this channel.
Some of you may know,
also, that January means
it's my birthday month, right Geebo?
Hey Geebo, how many
days until January 20th?
-  The answer is 18 days.
- 18 days until my birthday?
18 days until my birthday!
We're gonna plan something
fun for Missy and I.
Uh-oh.
Hello?
Hi!
Hey, what's up kiddos?
Now that the boys room is
right next to my office,
it's so cute, because I
will be working in here,
they can play in there.
They run in and jump all over everything
and bring all their
toys in my office, huh?
- Yeah.
- That's always fun too, kind
of gives me a little break.
-  Oh, bye.
-  (chuckles)
alright Finn, you ready?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, I need you to take
a very important meeting.
- Okay.
-  Okay, with Elon Musk.
Can you do that?
- Yeah.
-  You ready to sit down?
- Yeah.
-  Have a phone meeting?
- Yeah.
-  Talk about the
future of Youtube and Tesla?
Just kidding, we're not having
a meeting with Elon Musk,
but if we did, obviously
I'd bring in Finn,
because he is the master
negotiator, aren't you? (chuckles)
- Mama is.
- Mama's locked out.
- Yeah.
- (chuckles) she's coming back in.
There she is!
-  Hi!
-  And it's fall
finally here in California.
We have our trees so bare.
That one, that one, that
one is quite a fighter.
Yeah, but for those you saying
we don't get fall in
California, we do to an extent.
(slow electronic dance music)
(dinosaur roaring)
-  Wow, look at this
scary dinosaur! (laughing)
how cool?
- Yeah.
-  Did you get this for Christmas?
- Yeah.
-  That's so neat.
- From Aunt Shay-lee.
-  Oh that's cool.
Roar!
- We should make a chocolate dinosaur.
-  We should?
- Yeah!
- Ollie always comes up
with the greatest ideas.
Hey dinosaur, do you want
to be made out of chocolate?
- Yeah.
(dinosaur roaring)
who doesn't want to be
made out of chocolate?
(dinosaur roaring)
Check out this, Ollie, we got
Chocolate Construction T-Rex
so we can actually make
a 3D chocolate T-Rex.
- Really?
-  Should we do it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is so cool.
I found these on Amazon, I believe,
and you basically melt your chocolate,
you put it in the mold, and
then it's all the pieces
to basically build on yourself, like that.
You think ours will look that good, babe?
- I'm really hoping to.
I got this little tool that will help us,
basically, suck up the melted chocolate
and then poor it into
these little tiny pieces
that are probably really hard to get into.
-  Yeah it's true.
It's probably not a
whole love of chocolate.
(playful music)
-  We are melting chocolate and,
oh no the dinosaurs are gonna
eat all our chocolate!
-  Ahh!
-  (laughs) that's funny.
(playful music)
-  Alright, Bryan's
doing the first couple ones.
How is it?
- It's hard.
-  It it hard to do?
- So basically sucking
up chocolate in this,
and then squeezing it
in. I think this needs
a little bit more, and then look at these.
-  These are so thin.
-  It's like,
very intricate pieces.
-  I'll be surprised if
they come out and don't break (laughs).
- I know.
-  I'm really hoping.
- It's definitely gonna be a
cool little challenge to see if it works
-  Yeah.
-  Dada!
-  What do you think of that?
Is that the dinosaur's feet?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
-  Nope, rib cage (laughs).
-  Oh, (laughs) rib cage.
-  Close though.
(playful music)
-  I don't know
how it's possible, babe,
but you have chocolate all over your face.
- All over?
-  Well, it's basically
on the side of your eye.
- You know what
happened is that-
-  Look.
- Aww!
I bet what happened-
-  She got chocolate
tears drops (laughs).
- I was running, I had chocolate
in my hands, Finns up here.
All of a sudden he has chocolate on him,
I'm like, "ahh" like that.
-  Yeah, okay.
We filled in our molds very nicely
and now all we have to do is
wait for the chocolate to harden and then,
we can pop the individual pieces out
and create our dinosaur.
I hope it works.
I'm not sure if this is gonna work,
but it may be funny if it fails also.
Alright, Ollie is blogging,
just so you guys know.
We put all the chocolate in the molds,
(laughs) thanks Ollie.
Now we are gonna put our
molds in the freezer.
We just so happen to
have some freezer space.
-  Yeah!
- So that's nice.
-  That is nice, actually.
Yeah, it said freezer
to keep it extra hard.
- Cool.
-  We'll see.
Yeah that'll work, thanks.
- Cool!
-  Yay!
Alright, we'll be back.
- Alright, while our chocolate
dinosaurs are in the freezer,
we actually are gonna go to the ranch
and go check out the horses.
Ollie really wanted to see the pig.
What was his name?
- Wally!
-  Wally!
-  Wally!
You wanna go meet Wally?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, so the boys
are getting their shoes on
and they're actually getting
some special shoes on today.
Missy's so excited.
- I know, I went and got them,
well I went and actually
bought a few things today,
which I'm really excited
about and I thought,
they have to have some cowboy boots,
because they're gonna be
hanging out down there.
- Whoa!
- Yes your own cowboy boots!
-  Just like woody!
-  You guys can kick
up some dirt and the mud.
These ones are Finn's.
Aren't they cool?
-  Oh, that's awesome,
they have zippers on the sides.
- Yeah.
-  Whoa!
You like 'em Finn?
- Yup.
-  They're pretty neat, huh?
-  Aw, they're so cute.
- I like it when you zip it up.
- Yeah that's pretty neat, huh?
(county guitars strumming)
-  What do you think
of those cowboy boots?
- They light up.
-  Yes, apparently, they light up.
I thought I saw something Missy.
- I didn't do anything.
-  And I was like, wait.
Aw, Finn's don't light up.
- I know, they didn't have the size that
I wanted for Finn, yeah.
-  Same brand, yeah.
That is so cool!
Your cowboy boots light up, Ollie.
- I'm gonna have to order
some for Finn in his size.
I'll just order 'em.
That's so cute.
(country guitars strumming)
-  Aright boys,
say thank you to mama.
- Thank you mama.
- Thank you mama.
- You're welcome.
Muah!
-  That was very
nice of her to get you
nice cowboy boots.
- Look at me guys.
-  Whoa!
- Whoa!
-  Look at me (chuckles).
I love when he poses like that (chuckles).
- I wanna see it.
-  You wanna see it?
- Yeah!
-  You wanna see it?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, let's open it up.
Ohh!
Wait, where's our dinosaur?
Oh, we've got all these dinosaur bones
we can put together now.
- I wanna see 'em.
-  No touching, just see.
- Whoa.
- Wow, it looks done.
I think it's ready.
-  Alright boys we have a problem.
(crying)
don't cry, it's okay,
but there is a problem.
We're kind of failing at taking the
dinosaur bones out of the molds.
It's very difficult.
I was working on getting
these two out, those broke.
All of them broke and I
realized that this one is broken
in three different places and
Missy's having a little
bit more luck than I am.
- I'm gonna melt some chocolate
and try and glue it together.
I think it wouldn't be too hard.
(upbeat music)
- Alright, Missy was able to salvage
enough chocolate bones from her mold,
so we're gonna go ahead
and use hers to build them,
but now that means we get to eat this one.
Who wants to eat the dinosaur head?
- Me!
Ahh!
-  Take a bit, nom!
You want this piece?
Nom!
Chocolate.
Alright we have re-frozen the pieces.
Some had to be repaired with
a little bit of chocolate
glue, but that's okay.
Missy is a chocolate dinosaur doctor.
So now we just have to assemble it.
That's not gonna be too hard, right babe?
As she's digging instruction
out of the trash (laughs).
You go this, babe.
- Okay, so I think-
-  A puzzle of epic
chocolatey proportions.
- Our hands have to be super cold,
because if they're not then we'll-
-  Stick to it.
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
-  Does it work?
- No.
(upbeat music)
-  I had a brilliant
idea to grab a jar
to use under the head of the dinosaur
so we can easily assemble.
It's quite difficult
balancing it at the same time.
I see us like a very intense
paleontologist version of Willy Wonka.
(upbeat music)
-  Okay, our dinosaurs
have seen better days.
- Yeah.
-  This is very difficult.
- It is!
-  I think this is one
of those things you see on TV
that are suppose to work but don't.
It's just kind of a disaster.
- Okay, here are the arms.
-  They go on that rib cage.
- Yeah, they're supposed to go one here.
Oh gosh, please don't break.
Please don't break.
It broke.
-  (laughs)
Finn do you wanna see
a chocolate dinosaur?
- Yeah!
- Alright, let's go look.
It's real chocolate fossils (gasps).
- Whoa.
- Isn't that so cool.
- Yeah.
- Mamas putting it together, look.
- Okay, hang on.
I think it might be-
-  Balanced and everything?
- No, not balance.
-  Oh.
(laughing)
Okay, I see the arm, it's missing-
-  There's no rib cages,
here.
-  Missing a couple
of those.
-  There's that rib cage there.
Oh shoot, oh shoot.
-  It's okay, look at it.
It's amazing!
- Roar!
-  Wahh!
What do you think
of that, Finn?
-  It's amazing!
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna eat its head?
- Yeah.
- Eat his head.
(growling)
-  Oh my gosh.
-  Ahh! (laughs)
- Oh, it crumbled.
-  It was a good effort
to be fair, fossils aren't found mounted
and put together like that.
- Yeah.
-  They're found flat
- kind of like this.
-  Yeah, you find 'em flat.
This is more realistic.
It's basically like
chocolate dinosaur bones.
-  Was that good?
- That's cool that it all goes together,
but obviously it does not work that easy.
- Um, yeah maybe if we tried
something that doesn't melt,
like a jelly
-  Like candy?
Or like hard candy?
- Or if we tried candy!
- Oh yeah we could totally melt,
uh what are they called?
- That would be so cool.
- Jolly Ranchers.
-  Jolly Ranchers, yeah.
That'd be fun.
Let us know down below in the comments
if that's something you wanna see us do.
Hey, do you want to eat the tail?
Take a bit, nom!
How is it?
- Good.
- Good?
Nom!
History and chocolate.
That's a good combination,
I think.
- Alright, all done.
I guess we'll leave all the
dinosaur building up to the scientists,
huh?
- Yeah.
- He's like, "You put the
dinosaur bones over here dad".
You know what, Finn?
You actually ate your dinner so good,
I will let you have this
little dinosaur arm.
(laughs)
- So funny.
-  He is so funny.
-  Good job.
(laughs)
good job, high five.
(clap)
- Ollie actually fell
asleep early for the night
and it is now time for
this kiddo to go to bed.
- Your bedtime.
- Nope.
- Yes it is.
-  Nope.
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
If you did be sure to
give it a big thumbs up.
Thumbs up Finn!
- Thumbs up!
-  He's still pointing.
You can do the thumbs up.
- I know.
Thumbs up, like that.
-  There you go, thumbs up.
Let's see it.
- see?
-  Good job!
Thanks for watching today's video.
Subscribe and we'll see you manana.
What do you say, Finn?
-  Bye! Boop!
-  Bye! Boop!
(upbeat music)
