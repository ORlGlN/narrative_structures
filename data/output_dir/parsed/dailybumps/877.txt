really cool and it's been such a fun
time to share with you guys too and to

it's such a simple concept talking to
this little camera in my hand and you
guys watching it and listening and
interacting with it and being changed by
it
it's just crazy we get so many messages
every single day talking about how we've
changed their life that's such a crazy
thing for me because I'm honestly just

like bruised up I don't know it's just
it's getting I don't think you can be
stretched inning for it I don't know
yeah today we are focused on getting
this baby to drop because if I end up
being induced I need to be him to be as
low as possible so that the induction
can be a success yeah and not fail the
thing is is that if you guys remember
last week he was engaged yeah whoa
and then he came back up he was just
like no I'm just gonna go back up like
brah wrong way he's like never mind I
don't wanna do this can I just remind me
like when I was pregnant with ollie and
all the things that we were doing at the
end too like oh isn't it crazy just how
different those two pregnancies have
been too though no they were I had no
idea like I really think I just expected
it to go like Ollie now it's just like
this is so different oh my gosh
he's really nestled in that it was just
moving way too much by his nap time to
make those appointments
okay I'm gonna try and catch them so if
you can't tell he's like coming out the
side right here
and keeps kicking like crazy oh my gosh
catching some good ones on here mm-hmm

water but we stick it out of the water

like man missing as you know this is
Dave one thousand a thousand what would
you say out of all these thousand videos
is your most memorable probably the one
where Olly was born let's go in and what
did you just say I said this morning I
waited and talked to Jim and said the
baby's coming today
really you just knew I knew oh my god
Brian
oh my gosh oh gosh you guys so they have
a name his name's Oliver oh hi
oh yeah so perfect is he telling the
most amazing day of our life I gotta say
probably if I didn't have to choose that
one I'd probably say my most memorable
video was when we heard him laugh for
the first time remember that for his
first Thanksgiving and he laughed he
liked the pod for the first time and it
was like the coolest thing to like hear
as a parent I think I just do you think
oh you see there is I gotta laugh Oh a
can you laugh now
but you are my good eye i play by the
backseats sing a song I'm singing really
good couple minutes now like I try and
get it so Q I love them we are at the
mall and we're gonna do some walking but
now we're in a photo booth we got
distracted we're taking some photos huh
and now stick your tongue out
all real is kind of scary I was a very
feeling place on delivery queue that is
cute
look he's actually sticking out his
tongue right there - all right we are
back to walking only way to get a little
walk is if he chases mom and Mommy and
tickles go tickle mama you're gonna pee
yourself to 3jo whoa good job buddy
again that's his new favorite thing is
again yeah you can we just let an alley
jump and play and run around this little
area in the ball I mean he loves it I've
been walking around here a bunch yeah I
love watching him just play and I gotta
say one of the coolest things about
doing these videos and the fact that
we've done a thousand videos is being
able to go back and watch Ollie play and
oh and learn I think that's probably one
of the coolest things about the videos
that we're doing is just being able to
get to document his life and and
experience - all this again through
videos the same
to be part of something real
you
we won't stay in town suffer
to steal
he's like really I know what you were so
dumb

of the oven you guys looks so good we
got chicken breasts and then we have
some quartered potatoes and then we put
green beans on top and it's got this
yummy creamy herb butter you want to see
