Karma's getting his swim on I know a lot
of people haven't always been asking
like where's karma where's Karma most of
the time when we have company over karma
goes over to Mimi's house and that's
because he's not very good around like a
lot of kids especially if they're like
screaming and playing and and running
around the house and stuff it's usually
just a whole lot easier just to put
karma in an environment where he does
not do that because it kind of stresses
him out so Mimi and Cassie take really
good care of him and he gets to play
with his good buddy Koda so he just had
a nice little sleepover with Koda didn't
you and now you're out here playing in
the water
