Ah. Ah.

-  Good morning.
- We are basically starting the vlog
exactly where we ended it.
They slept all night in their crib.
It is basically a crib, huh? (laughs)
in their bed, and they were such good boys
we are now getting ready for our day.
We have a big, exciting day today
so I'm just getting them
dressed, getting them ready.
-  Watch this.
Start eating some breakfast.
Did you eat some breakfast?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  Watch this, guys.
- Did you eat breakfast?
Okay, he wants to show us
what we was doing last night.
(Ollie blows his lips)
(Finn laughs)
-  Is it as funny?
-  Yeah.
(Ollie blows his lips)
(Finn laughs)
- (laughs) oh goodness, you boys.
Hours and hours of fun, I tell ya.
- Hey guys.
So Missy and I are headed out of
the house today to do
something really fun.
We're actually already going to
the racetracks with her aunt today.
And then a horse that
Missy's been looking at,
the lady said that she's gonna be
right across the street
from the racetrack,
also doing more racing stuff.
And that she was gonna bring the horse by
in a stable so that we could go see it.
So we're hoping that
everything lines up today
and we're gonna be able to see
Missy's horse that she's looking at.
But otherwise, we have
a really exciting day
because Missy and I are headed to Pasadena
and we're gonna go have some fun up there
and go look at some horses.
(light music)
Alright, we are in the car now.
And I thought I would let Missy explain
a little bit more about
where we're going exactly
and what we're doing exactly.
- Okay, so we are actually
headed to my great aunt Sally.
I don't see her very often and she lives
kind of in the LA area.
And she's a super busy lady,
but we're gonna kind of
just hang out with her.
She's gonna take us to
a couple fun places,
but I'm really excited to go to her home
because as a kid I used to come here often
and she has a beautiful piano.
She loves to play all kinds of instruments
and I used to play the piano over there
on her beautiful piano and
play the harp and stuff.
And what's interesting
is that she has lived
in this home since 1940 and her
dad actually built the home.
And her mom and her are also very small,
sort of like my mom who's four eight,
and they're like the exact same size.
- Just smaller.
- (laughs) Yeah, so she's kind of
on the smaller side as
well and her mom was too.
And when her dad built this home,
he built it to scale for her mom.
So it actually is, like all the counters
are a lot shorter and smaller,
so my mom used to come here as a kid too
and she always loved it.
Because she could reach everything
and it's just like a
really, really fun house
that is custom built.
She's been living in it since
she was a child, like a baby.
She was born and raised in this home.
- And they have peacocks
running around too, I heard.
That's cool.
- Yeah, so we're really excited.
I'm excited to take Bryan,
he's never really been.
And I'm excited to kind
of just hang out with her.
I know her dad has been through a lot.
I think he was in the war and he's done
a lot of really cool stuff.
So it'll be interesting
to hear some of that.
Alright, we are here
now with my aunt Sally.
(laughs) And she's giving
us a tour of her home.
And my aunt Kris is gonna show
me all about the bathroom.
- Yes, okay the bathroom is quite amazing.
So she had it redone in peacock.
-  Oh yes, there's
peacocks everywhere.
- But look at the sink.
So she won't even use this sink.
She had this peacock sink done.
Isn't that amazing?
-  (laughs) It's so cool
and I just love the counters.
They're like so small.
- And pictures from
the Hunnington Library.
These we got up there.
-  I think I had some
of these when I was little.
-  Missy.
-  Yeah?
- The rose lamp is
something I gave my mother.
And then this little thing
and the rose on the spoon,
I mean, I found it.
-  Really?
- Going through family stuff.
-  Oh wow, that's so cool.
- And the napkins, the rose soap.
-  So pretty.
I love it in here.
(piano playing softly)
- That's enough.
(laughter and applause)
-  That was great.
-  That was awesome.
-  So good.
(light music)
So we are now at the riding club, right?
- Missy, 170 horses out here.
- 170.
-  Wow.
- And she has one and she
rides almost every day?
- Every week.
- Every week.
- Every week, I used to ride
twice a week, but not now.
- Yeah, she said she even does jumping.
-  That's amazing.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  Oh, that one's cute.
-  So cute and little.
-  Henry.
-  Hi Henry. (laughs)
(Henry neighs)
(Bryan and Missy laugh)
-  What's he doing?
-  Can you smile?
(banging)
-  Wow.
He's trying to lick you.
Aw, Missy's just, like, making friends.
(light music)
Alright, so we have said goodbye
to aunt Sally and aunt Kristy,
and we are actually going
on an adventure of our own.
Because the horse that
Missy has been looking at,
is actually down here at another stable
that was actually pretty close
to the last one we were at.
So we thought we'd use this opportunity
to go and check it out.
- Yes, so excited.
I really like this horse.
I really like all of its background,
it's supposed to be a
super sweet, nice one.
So I'm interested.
I'm not gonna ride it, no one's riding.
I don't have anyone with
me, either, to ride it.
But I'm just gonna look
at it, see how that goes.
And then we'll come back another time
with a trainer and stuff to check it out.
But, I'm excited.
- Yeah, so we're kind of just doing
a little bit of horse
shopping today, basically.
Which is kind of cool,
never done this before.
- I know, it's so fun.
(bright music)
-  What do you think, babe?
- Cool, I like her.
she's so pretty.
-  So pretty and sweet.
Hi.
Oh hey, little dude.
What's up?
Aw, did you miss me?
(boys shouting)
Did you miss me?
And you missed me?
And you missed me?
(Bryan laughs)
Give me a hug.
Argh.
Wow, this is what
happens when I come home.
(dog panting)
All my dogs and all my humans
(boys shouting)
greet me.
Hi guys.
Okay, Finn, what do you have?
- Prise.
- What?
- A surprise.
- You guys have a surprise for me?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, in the playroom.
- Okay, show me.
Let's go.
-  So under the
couch, I can't show you.
-  Oh jeez, you just put
all your toys under the couch?
-  Yeah.
-  You silly boy.
Look at all those toys.
(boys shouting)
- (laughs) Oh my gosh,
I missed these boys.
(boys screaming and playing)
-  Are you guys playing?
- Yeah.
(boys giggling and playing)
- These kids are playing,
it's almost bedtime.
And they ate all their dinner.
They ate all their dinner so
they get a peanut butter ball.
(boys cheer)
I'm getting low, guys.
I think I need to dip a few more.
I've actually a bunch of peanut balls
that are in the
(boys cheering)
freezer that I need to dip.
Alright, you get one.
And you get one.
Let me know how they are.
Are they good?
Good, then none for you.
Sorry girl.
Alright, we are getting ready for bed now.
I wanted to show you guys.
We have been taking these probiotics
for quite a few months now.
It's the Ultra Flora
Children's daily probiotic
and I swear everybody
around us has gotten sick.
(boys shout and play)
And we're normally grouped into that,
like we usually got that cold and stuff.
And these kids have not
had a cold in quite awhile
and haven't gotten sick.
And I'm like, is it
because of the probiotics?
Or have we just been staying home more?
I don't know what it is exactly,
but I'm pretty proud of us for not getting
the cold that's been passed around.
I haven't seen like the flu.
And we've even had people
over the Christmas season
who've been pretty sick with either
flu type symptoms or bad colds
and we've got nothing yet.
Knock on wood. (laughs)
I need to find wood, knock on wood.
You never know.
We could totally end
up being sick tomorrow,
but so far so good.
And I swear, I'm like
maybe this is working.
I dunno.
They've been taking that,
a few other vitamins.
But I'm pretty excited about the fact
these guys haven't been sick.
Oh, look at that ring.
Alright, let me see that. (laughs)
(laughs) These boys are so cute.
(Finn whoops and plays)
I have missed them all day.
Why are you guys so cute?
Are you a bull, Ollie?
(boys shout and play)
Is that a bull, or like a yak?
Is that what it's called, a yak?
(Finn roars)
Ah.
Oh my goodness, that's a scary bear.
(Finn roars)
careful, careful.
You guys are so cute.
Yeah, I had such a fun day,
but I definitely missed
these boys so much.
(Finn shouts)
Oh my goodness, now you're a kitty cat.
Now you're a kitty cat.
Ah.
(boys laugh)
Dog pile.
(laughter)
Dog pile Mama.
Why are you guys so cute?
- Because.
- I love you.
- I love my pa.
-  These little kitty cats
are now climbing this little
scratching pole. (laughs)
Wow, he literally climbed up you.
-  Okay, thanks for that.
-  And he did it.
Finns like, me next, me next.
(Bryan laughs)
Finn, you gotta climb
onto Ollie's shoulders.
- Look it, he's getting a rock.
-  Oh my gosh. (laughs)
He's gonna do it.
- Come on, okay.
(Finn giggles)
-  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
(boys giggle)
-  Why are you guys so cute?
- Hashtag dad life.
- These aren't kitty
cats, these are monkeys.
(Ollie shouts)
I cannot believe I got
to see a horse today.
That was really, really exciting.
I'm not purchasing it
yet, or I don't even know
if that's officially the one.
(boys shout and play)
It was extremely sweet, very loving,
but I definitely need someone to ride it.
And even I need to ride it before
I make any decision like that.
I'll probably even have a vet take a look,
just to make sure I'm
making the right decision.
But I'm really excited
and maybe it is the one.
I don't really know.
That connection was definitely there,
I loved just looking at her
and she was just so sweet.
She definitely laid her
head on me a couple times
and was just really
loving and affectionate.
And I've never really seen
a horse like that before.
I mean, I've had them come up to me,
but never really like rubbed their face.
So that was kind of fun, it was exciting.
But anyways, I think we're gonna go ahead
and end today's video.
These boys are long past
their bedtime, right?
(Finn shouting)
Oh my gosh, how am I gonna get
these boys to bed? (laughs)
alright, so make sure you give
this video a big thumbs up.
Say thumbs up.
Thumbs up, Ollie.
Yeah, and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Do you wanna do it Finn?
What do you say?
- Bye.
(bright music)
