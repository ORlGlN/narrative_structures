-  Good morning!
♪ This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it for ever ♪
- So today's vlog is very special.
Do you know why boys?
- Why?
- Here, take a seat on Daddy's knee,
and I will tell you why
today's vlog is special.
Because this vlog marks
five years of vlogging on YouTube.
Did you know that?
- Yeah.
- We have been vlogging longer
than you have been alive.
- True story.
We've been vlogging every
day for five years, you guys.
This actually has happened.
This is a thing that has happened,
that has changed our life, and
we couldn't be more grateful.
It's crazy, Ollie, we
have every single day
of your life documented, isn't that cool?
- Yeah.
- So you can go back and
you can see everything,
how amazing is that?
- You can see when you are three days old.
-  And when Finn
is three days old, yeah.
- You can see when you're two.
Do you remember when you were two?
Yeah?
Well, you can go back and remember any day
that you might have forgot.
- If you guys have been
here since the beginning,
I want you to leave a comment down below
and tell us what your favorite
moment of the five years
that we've been on YouTube is.
Because I feel like it'd
be such an amazing thing
to go back and look.
And we're gonna share
some of our favorite moments coming up.
Today's vlog is gonna
be a tiny bit different,
we're gonna be answering some questions
about our experience
in the last five years
of daily vlogging, and
we are also going to have
a pretty big announcement
at the end of this video.
So be sure to stay tuned for that.
Right Ollie?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah, okay, should
we answer some questions?
We have been so incredibly
blessed these last five years
so we wanted to take this
moment to reward you guys.
So if we answer your
question in today's video
we're also going to be
sending you some swag.
- Coloring book and calendar!
-  That's right!
We are gonna be sending
you guys a calendar
and a Daily Bumps coloring book
if we answered your
question in today's vlog.
Huge thanks to everyone
who submitted a question
with the hashtag
#FiveYearsOfDailyBumps on Twitter,
it was seriously so
cool getting to go back
and see all your guys' questions,
all your guys' memories of
your past videos and stuff.
I think that's amazing.
Alright, we are gonna get started
answering questions right now.
All right, so Ghost asked,
"What made you want to start vlogging
"every single day of your life?"
- You know, it was kind of the
thing to do when we started.
You know, it's like, let's daily vlog.
- At the time, Missy
was pregnant with Ollie,
she was, like, just a
couple months along, right?
Missy had her own channel
where she talked about her pregnancies,
and it was all about us starting a family.
And then when we actually
started a family with Ollie,
a lot of people were like,
what are you guys doing?
They were interested in
how we were doing things,
you know, we were like a young family,
we still are a very young family.
And I think it's been pretty incredible
that people have got to see us
grow and evolve from a couple
and two parents who don't
know what they're doing,
to kind of learning everything
in front of you guys
and sharing that experience
with you guys too,
so I always thought
that was super important
to do with the vlog,
and it's something we
still continue to do now.
(upbeat pop music)
Alright, so Kate has asked,
"What has been your biggest accomplishment
"with vlogging, sending
love from Michigan."
Well thank you Kate,
I'm gonna show you one of them right now.
It would probably have to be
this giant gold Play Button!
So this is our gold Play Button.
We got it when we passed
a million subscribers,
it was on New Years Eve I believe,
couple years ago.
So this is our dining
room, we have it displayed
up here with all of our other plaques.
Hundred thousand on my channel,
Missy's channel,
and that was the hundred
thousand award for Daily Bumps.
Hopefully Missy's channel will
be getting one of these soon,
I think she's at about a
half a million subscribers,
and she always wants to start
doing more content on there.
So maybe she'll also get one of these
for her channel as well.
But yes, we have one for Daily Bumps,
I think of this as a huge
accomplishment as a YouTuber.
This is something that's amazing to get,
it's recognition from YouTube saying,
You did awesome, here's something for it.
Like something physical,
I think that's amazing.
I would say another major accomplishment
that we've done on this channel
is our fundraisers for
the missions in Cambodia,
where Missy's cousin Curtis serves,
we've been over there as well,
and we've been able to
raise a ton of money
for the schools and the ministry,
and all the work that they do over there.
So I would have to say that's definitely
a huge accomplishment
of the channel as well.
Alright, so Sarah wants to know,
when we are not vlogging,
what are our favorite things to do?
My favorite things to do
when I'm not vlogging,
and sometimes I'm vlogging it too,
is taking care of all of our plants.
I have definitely acquired a little bit
of a green thumb hobby over the last year,
and I just love getting new plants
and taking care of them.
I also enjoy playing video games,
which is kinda hard to vlog anyway,
and listening to music.
I love just closing all
the shades in my office
and just sitting down and like,
listening to a good song or two.
Usually John Mayer or Khalid, but yeah,
those are my favorite things
to do when we're not vlogging.
And now here's Missy to tell you hers.
- A couple things, I love
to go get my hair done
and just not vlogging
it, and just relaxing
and getting pampered, and
not worrying about a thing.
And then my other favorite thing to do
is actually hang out with some friends
that we don't always vlog with,
and we just kinda like get to chill,
and we just don't
necessarily need to vlog it,
'cause we just like to enjoy
our time with our friends.
(upbeat pop music)
- Alright, so Marvey asked,
"If you could relive any vlogged moment
"from the past five years,
what would it be and why?"
I'm gonna go ahead and answer this one,
and I'm gonna say it's a vlog we put out
called Swimming with Sharks in Hawaii.
Whenever I feel cooped up in the house
I watch that vlog and it's
just such an amazing time.
Not only is Hawaii beautiful,
but we got to do this crazy experience
where we snorkeled down and got to walk
on the bottom of the ocean.
There was a ton of beautiful fish,
it was just one of those moments
that I will never forget,
and sometimes I just want to
jump right into that video
and do it all over again.
(laughs)
I'll have the video up in that corner
if you guys wanna watch it.
(upbeat pop music)
- Alright, Lauren actually asked us,
"How do you keep a
work/relationship/family balance
"and do you think the
boys would want to stop
"being in the vlogs as they get older?"
As far as keeping a balance
with our relationship,
and family, and work, I think
it's all about how you vlog.
So for one thing, we
really, really try hard
not to over-vlog our day,
obviously we've done it in the past,
and I think it's what a lot
of people start out doing,
is they over-vlog,
they vlog everything they're doing,
every little thing throughout the day,
and it really, really will
start to wear you down,
and really feel like that's
all you're doing all day,
is just filming what you're doing.
But by being able to
organize what we're filming
and how we're filming, we're able to keep
a very healthy balance
so that the boys don't feel like
they're being, like, vlogged constantly,
or that we're only hanging out with them
when we're vlogging.
And then do I think that
the boys will stop being...
stop wanting to be in the vlog?
I don't think so, I mean, like I said,
we really try not to make them feel like
they're constantly being vlogged.
I mean, if they ever were like,
I just don't wanna be in the vlog,
that would be totally fine.
But do I think they ever will?
Not necessarily, but I guess we'll see.
(upbeat pop music)
Alright, next question comes from Rosey,
and she asked, "I have always
wondered about Gabriel.
"I know you still think of him every day,
"but how do you keep so positive?
"100% understand that
this is highly personal,
"but I want to hear your
thoughts six years later."
So, as some of you may know,
and some of you may not know,
before we ever started
vlogging or YouTube,
I actually was about 20 weeks pregnant
when we lost our
pregnancy, and it was a boy
and his name was Gabriel.
It's something that we
kind of started on YouTube
talking about a lot, it was obviously
what I was going through at the time.
Six years later, it is obviously something
that still affects me to this day.
When I think about pregnancies,
I get a little nervous and scared,
because of, you know, all the
things that I've been through
before having Oliver and Finn.
And as far as how I feel,
it's still really hard.
Like, I have a very, very
hard time talking about it.
It definitely changed
me, it changed who I am,
and not all for bad, I
mean some of it for good.
Some of it made me just realize
how much every single thing matters.
Every time, every moment that
you spend with each other
matters because you never
know when it's gonna be gone.
I do try and stay positive
because I have such an amazing family,
and I have two amazing kids
that I love with all my heart.
My heart breaks for the other
pregnancies that I've lost,
but I just try really
hard to stay positive,
I really love my children,
and that's what I get
to look at every day,
and I'm so thankful for that.
(upbeat pop music)
- So Mariana said, "How
crazy is it to look back
"and see how many people you've touched
"and how many years you've
been a part of their lives for?
"You really are a huge part of our life
"and you brighten up my days.
"Here's to five more, I
love you guys so much."
Thank you so much, Mariana.
This is a photo that we all took in London
when she saw us there,
which was so much fun.
Hey Ollie, come here, look,
do you remember taking
that photo in London?
-  Yeah.
- Look at your little
face, you look so cute!
-  Look at you
Finn, you're just a baby!
-  That was so fun, huh?
Thank you for sharing this
photo, that's adorable.
It honestly is amazing
when you think about
how many people watch these vlogs,
and how many people subscribe,
and it's really kind of humbling
to have so many people be inspired by you.
- When we think back of like all the lives
that we seem to have somehow
bring some happiness to,
it is, honestly, like it doesn't
really comprehend with us.
And I think that's a good thing.
I mean, we just love what we do
and it amazes us when people come up to us
and say that we somehow
gave them happiness,
or brought them out of a depression, or...
It's just the craziest thing,
and I'm glad that it's
just by just being us,
we don't have to pretend or do
anything crazy or different.
- I think as a YouTuber
it's also really easy
to get wrapped up in
the numbers of things,
and we've gotten to a point where
we don't really check to see
how many new subscribers we got,
we don't check to see how many views
a video got necessarily,
I don't go actively looking for that.
It's kind of just
something we've kept doing,
and it keeps growing, which is amazing.
But yeah, being hyper-focused
on all those numbers
isn't really what we wanna do,
because we wanna make content
regardless of those numbers,
and that's kind of the
mindset we've always had, too.
(upbeat pop music)
Alright, so our next question
comes from Christine,
and I thought it was a
question better suited
for Ollie himself.
Alright Ollie, Christine asked,
"Do the boys want another sibling?"
So, do you want another
brother or a little sister?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
How many more?
Just one more?
Would you rather have a little
brother, or a little sister?
- I want a little sister.
-  What?
A little sister?
Why do you want a little sister?
- Because I want to dress
her like a princess.
- Aw, you can dress her
up like a little princess?
And then you guys can play,
and you could be the big, strong knight.
And Finn can be a big, strong knight, too.
- Yeah.
-  Would that be cool?
- I could be a wizard.
-  You could be a wizard!
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, alright,
so Ollie wants a little sister, right?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, we'll try.
(upbeat pop music)
Alright, Sophie sent us this video.
- Hey Missy, Bryan, Ollie and Finn.
I'm Sophie from Australia,
and I was just wondering,
what's the funniest moment
you've caught on camera
over the past five years?
- The funniest moment
we've caught on camera.
There have been
so many.
-  Come here, get it!
(techno music)
-  Where is my eyeliner?
It's on your face!
-  Holy (bleep), oh my God.
-  I kid you not,
he did this on his own volition you guys.
Work it!
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
All those moments were so funny,
we've been so lucky to
catch things like that
of our kids and of our family on camera.
I think that's definitely a perk
of just always having cameras accessible.
But I would have to
say the funniest moment
we ever caught on camera
was Ollie rescuing Finn
from his crib, and it went crazy viral.
It was on World News, ABC News,
FOX News, all over the Internet.
A bunch of people stole the video
and uploaded it as their own,
it was one of those
first experiences for me
of a video going ultra, crazy viral.
I think it's up to over a hundred
million views on Facebook.
Here's a little clip from that.
(quirky music)
(soft electronic music)
- The boys have been begging
to do this for like weeks.
-  They wanna throw water balloons!
- And it's freezing cold outside,
so we're not throwing
them on each other, right?
-  Yeah.
- Okay.
- We still have a couple
more questions left,
this should keep the boys busy.
Water balloons!
Throw it!
Nice!
Whoa, good throw Finn!
(upbeat electronic music)
So Bridget asked, "How
would you say your style
"of vlogging has changed over the years?"
Well, I will definitely say
it has changed in some areas,
and it hasn't changed in others.
We've always vlogged even
the most mundane life things,
making breakfast, driving in the car,
running errands, stuff like that.
But I will say that
we've gotten pretty good
at making it a lot more interesting.
And that's kind of like what
our life is all about, right?
- Yeah, I love the fact that our vlogs
can be just us, you know us,
but you also know that we're really fun.
You can see both of
that through our vlogs.
- We always try to say,
stay fun and positive.
And I think it's a good
thing for the vlog,
but it's a good thing as a family also.
- I think it's really good as a family
because we get to stay happy,
and like we're having fun.
But you also do see us in our sad moments,
you see us struggling,
you see us having bad days or whatever,
but you know what?
That's what everyone deals with.
But we love being positive, too.
-  Alright, should
we do more water balloons?
-  Yeah!
-  Whoa, there's lots of 'em!
-  Yeah!
- Alright, Kayla asked,
"What do you hope the next
five years will bring you?"
- Phew, next five years, so we
just accomplished five years.
- Yes, I mean, I hope at
least one more kid, maybe?
- I think maybe one more kid,
I think maybe a new business.
I think there's gonna be some
new goals crushed as a family.
Missy and I have definitely been talking
about what the next five
years of our life look like.
We just accomplished a ton in five years,
to even try to match
that would be amazing,
and we're gonna try.
- Obviously we're a young family,
and so our goals were,
you know, we wanna buy a house,
we wanna have kids,
we wanna, you know, do all these things.
I feel like the next five
years will be a lot different.
- I think the next five
years are really important
because I want these
next five years to define
what we are remembered for on YouTube.
- For sure.
- And as a family, as business owners,
I want people to look
at these next five years
we're gonna do and I wanna
look at it and be proud of it.
- Mmhmm, and we are proud of
what we have accomplished.
You know, I mean, as a young family,
to be able to accomplish
this much in five years
is absolutely insane.
But now we want to look
a little bit further,
a little bit deeper, and
we're really excited.
- Alright, last question
comes from Hannah Joan,
she said, "What is the message
you want your subscribers
"to take away from watching your videos?"
I think the message I
want people to take away
is that families are a
place of joy, and comfort,
and acceptance, and love,
and if you are in a family where
you don't get those things,
you can watch us, and you can find it,
and you can know that it is possible.
- Yeah, and know that, I
mean, life isn't always easy.
You know, you've seen our struggles,
you've seen what we've been through.
We try and just show a
lot of the positivity,
and you guys can have that, too.
Even if your life is hard, and struggling,
and you're having difficulties.
- So, seriously, huge
thank you to everyone
who tweeted questions with the hashtag
#FiveYearsOfDailyBumps.
I cannot believe we've been
doing this for five years.
- Yes, and we just want to say thank you
to all of our viewers,
and everyone that has been
watching us and supporting us.
Whether you've watched us in the beginning
and then have taken breaks and come back,
or have just started watching.
We have so much about us
that even you guys still don't know.
- I feel like Olive
Garden took our tagline,
it's when you're here, you're family.
- Yes, and we used to
love Oliver Garden, huh?
- We love our Oliver Garden.
- We do love Oliver Garden.
(upbeat pop music)
-  We're
getting a real vacation!
- Yes, so Missy and I are taking
a very well-deserved break,
we're giving ourselves a week,
be sure you're following us on Instagram
so you know where we're going.
We're not gonna be vlogging or editing
or anything like that.
- But you guys aren't even gonna notice.
- Yes, we've been working really hard
to make sure that we
still have awesome content
laid out for you guys, and
we get a little vacation
of our own, and we are so excited.
I can't imagine a time
in the last five years
where we've got to not
think about the vlog.
- No, I mean, we have always
vlogged every single day,
and if anything, we have
always had to you know, edit,
make thumbnails,
do everything that's
involved with YouTube,
and it's, it can be...
- It's a lot of work.
- A lot.
Especially on vacation,
it can almost be more difficult,
because uploading can be
very difficult through Wi-Fi
and stuff, and we're gonna go somewhere
where we don't even care
if the internet works.
- I know, I was like, that's so amazing.
We can go anywhere.
- We're trying really
hard to make this happen,
and we are so excited, and again,
thank you guys for even
making this possible.
We do not complain that we work everyday.
- No, I love it.
- But we're gonna take a break!
(laughs)
- Yeah, we're gonna take a little break.
So make sure you're following
Missy and I on Instagram
so you can see where we're headed,
we are gonna have a blast.
Hey boys, you wanna end the vlog with us?
Alright, thank you guys
for watching this video,
thanks for five years of Daily Bumps,
give this video a thumbs up,
comment below with your favorite thing
in the last five years,
and we will see you mañana, right Finn?
Say bye!
- Bye!
Boo!
(upbeat pop music)
