- Hey Ollie, I have a question for ya.
- What?
- What is your favorite food of all time
in the history of the world?
- Pancakes.
- Pancakes!
What if we create some
crazy things with pancakes?
That sound fun?
- Hmmm mmm
♫ Wherever you are
♫ That's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a laugh
and that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up inside
♫ This is home
♫ Just running around,
you never looked so cute
♫ How can you tell, I
(mumbles) all I could
♫ Take you
♫ I am home
♫ Home's wherever you're with me
(toddler laughs)
-  Good morning Fin.
Hey buddy.
-  Good morning
- It's a perfect Saturday
morning, you guys.
We are watching Saturday morning cartoons.
We're eating pumpkin spice pancakes.
Missy made us pumpkin spice pancakes
and now she's like you guys go eat those
and I'm gonna run and work
out and be healthy and stuff.
- I will be fine.
I'm gonna go on my first
run outside the gym,
not using a treadmill,
which I'm actually, have
a lot of anxiety over
cause I'm very
- she's just gonna run.
- Like something's chasing her, you guys.
- Yeah, I'm trying to,
I'm really starting to enjoy running.
So I'm excited about that
- Cool.
-  I'm glad.
- Yeah I'm gonna
- and you're using
-  your headphones I got you.
- These, I love.
I found this in my backpack.
It's Kelsey's.
I stole it.
-  That's funny.
You won't need that anymore
once you get your new Apple watch.
- Yeah I know.
-  Just listen
to your music like that.
- And I got like an app on my phone.
Okay cause mainly, I'm addicted
to the treadmill numbers
and I feel like
- The stats
- you can get very addicted to those.
But I still have..
I downloaded a little app so.
-  Oh it tells you it all.
- Yeah.
-  Alright well, have fun.
- Just going on a quick
run and I'll be right back.
I am back from my run
and I gotta say guys,
it was pretty brutal.
I did not run that far.
I ran three quarters of a mile
which is really not far at all
and it was just so hard.
I was like why is this so hard.
I can so good on a treadmill.
Obviously I know why.
I was going uphill almost the entire way
and that is something
I'm not used to at all.
And it was just, I don't know
it was very, very different.
I think the treadmill
even keeps you motivated
cause you can't really stop
because the thing's still going
and I'm just like I'm gonna stop now
because I'm done.
This kind of is uncomfortable.
I don't know, I definitely
wanna keep doing it,
so I can get used to it
because it's something I need to do.
I can't just run on treadmills,
especially if I wanna do 5K's and stuff.
But anyways, it was still fun.
It was good for me to do the first time
and now, I'm just hanging
out with these boys.
We're excited to have a fun day today.
- So I thought I would talk
about my experience yesterday
because I was not allowed
to blog or take pictures.
So I actually took yesterday
to just get to enjoy it.
But yesterday, I had a
really cool opportunity
with the Grammy Association,
which I am now a member of,
which is kind of cool.
I got to go to a private
Harry Styles Q&A and show.
So he got to talk with the producer
about making his album
and then he played a song
and it was seriously so
encouraging and inspiring
because it was just all about the music
which is really, really cool.
Daniel, my producer, who I went with,
we walked away feeling super
encouraged ad inspired.
We have some really big
plans for music for myself
and for the famiLy, which is really neat,
that we've been working on.
So it was just one of those things
where it was like Cool, like
yes, this is what I wanna do.
I love singing.
I love writing music.
I love music, so.
But yeah, it was really, really, cool.
We got to hang out in a
room with Harry Styles
and there was probably
a hundred people there,
maybe less.
It was a super small theater.
It was a really, really
awesome experience.
So I thought I'd vlog
and let you guys know
cause a lot of you were begging
me to me to talk about it.
But yeah, they didn't allow
any pictures or video.
Of course, a ton of people broke the rules
but I didn't want to be disrespectful
to the Grammy Association
and not follow that rule.
Still waiting on this
guy to bloom, by the way.
That one is almost all shriveled up.
Ooh and it's actually
really hard and crispy
and could probably cut it.
This one is, hopefully about to open.
I wanna see it open.
Hey Ollie, I have a question for ya.
- What?
- What is your favorite food of all time
in the history of the world?
- Pancakes.
- Pancakes!
What if we create some
crazy things with pancakes?
That sound fun?
- Hmmm mm
- Yes, as you guys know,
we made a rainbow pancake stack.
I'll have it in the icards,
so you can watch it.
Ollie loves pancakes so much.
Look at him, he's getting ready.
He's like 'I'm ready' huh?
You ready?
So we're gonna see what cool things
we can make out of pancakes today.
(screams)
Alrighty.
I think we are prepared for
some fun pancake art, you guys.
- We have all the colors.
-  Look at all these colors.
We've got purple, brown, green, black,
red, white, yellow, orange.
Isn't that so cool?
- I'm so excited.
I did this a little bit yesterday,
so I feel like I'm really prepared.
-  Yes.
- And I'm excited to
make some really cool art
and I think what we're gonna start with
is just a really simple emoji.
So Ollie, what emoji should we do?
- This one.
(gasps)
- This one?
This is
- Tongue out emoji.
- A good one.
Has some detail but I think we can do it.
(laughs)
-  Hey Ollie, can
you stick your tongue out
like the emoji?
(laughs)
Alright, let's try it.
- Okay let's do it.
(chill music)
- Babe, that is pretty good.
- That's very beautiful color, actually.
- We'll see how it turns out.
(screams excitedly)
- Look at that.
That looks so cool.
-  Beautiful.
- Isn't that cool?
-  That is pretty dang good, babe.
-  Oh yeah.
-  For the first time,
simple emoji pancake art.
Look at that.
- Yaay.
- Is it hot?
- Alright, next up, I'm going
to do a very simple emoji.
I'm going to do the pow emoji,
cause I haven't done any pancake art.
We'll see how this turns out.
(upbeat music)
- Why is all red over?
- Well, I did my white layer
and then I did a yellow
and an orange layer
and I did a red layer on top.
(Missy laughs)
-  How do you think you did?
- It looks pretty good.
It looks like the pancake
is settling a little bit,
so it's spreading more than I want.
What do you think's gonna happen Ollie?
When we flip it?
-  Do you think
it's gonna look cool?
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be like a pow huh?
-  Do you think
it's gonna look like that?
- Let's see.
Three, two, one.
Pow!
Yeah I think I burnt it a little.
-  Oh no.
It looks cool.
I like the edging.
Like it has.
-  Look at the little
red things that came through.
-  It looks good.
- (mumbles) because it's pretty cool.
- Yeah.
- Thanks buddy.
- High five.
- It is pretty cool.
(upbeat music)
- Emojis are cool and all
but I think I need a little
bit more of a challenge babe.
- Let's do it.
- I think I want to make a pancake
that looks like a cheeseburger.
I just wanna stack it.
So I'm gonna make all of
the cheeseburger parts
out of pancake and stack them all together
and see if we can make a
giant pancake cheeseburger.
Almost like a Big Mac.
Like a McDonald's Big Mac.
- I think that's a good idea.
-  Do you think we should do that?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Alright, we're going
to start with the bun.
So I'm using just pancake batter here.
There is no color in this.
It's gonna give us just
a nice solid circle
and it's gonna be like a golden brown.
It's gonna be cool.
I think this is perfect.
Alright, I got some brown,
which is a beautiful color
to make a hamburger patty.
-  Yeah.
- Which is also pretty easy.
It's mostly just a circle.
-  I think this will be fun
cause it's like mostly the texture.
-  Yeah.
And this one we don't
need to be super fluffy.
We can go for this.
(upbeat music)
-  That looks like a
hamburger patty if you ask me.
- I think so.
Should I season it up?
Put a little salt and pepper.
-  Yeah we should put
a little salt and pepper.
(giggles)
- Cheese time.
This should be pretty simple.
It should be just an orange square.
-  Thin square really.
Oh it looks nice.
What do you think Ollie?
Does that look like cheese?
(giggles)
Thumbs up Bryan.
- Lettuce time.
I'm using the green, you wanna see?
- Hmmm mm
- Alright, so excited.
He's like yaay green.
Tomato time.
Ketchup and mustard.
I mean this basically looks like
ketchup and mustard right now.
You know what I mean?
-  Yeah.
- And last but not least, the top bun.
Got this for sesame seeds
and this for the bun.
I'm gonna put our bottom bun right here
so that I have it as a size reference.
So we want to get as close
to that size as possible.
That good?
-  Yeah, looks good to me.
(techno music)
-  Now for the final touches.
- Alright, we are all done
cooking each of the pieces
and now it's time to build the burger.
Are you ready?
- Yeah.
-  And Ollie, you're
gonna do the taste test?
- Yup.
- Alright, first we need our bottom bun.
Okay, now we need the patty.
Do you know what the patty is?
-  What?
-  Meat.
-  It's an all beef Angus patty.
- Yeah
and of course, this is
not just a regular burger,
this is a cheeseburger.
So we gotta put the cheese on that.
-  Oh my god, this
is just looking so cool.
- Okay ready?
Now you gotta add the lettuce.
Do you like lettuce in real life?
No?
-  He's going to like this lettuce.
- Oh look how cool that is.
Alright, next we gotta add the tomatoes,
which I gotta say,
that's like my favorite.
-  Thanks babe.
I did a pretty good job huh?
-  Gonna add those tomatoes.
-  And then you
gotta have your condiments.
You got ketchup and mustard squiggles.
- You like ketchup and mustard?
- No.
- No?
-  You're gonna like this one,
it's made out of pancakes.
- Yaay.
- Alright, ketchup and mustard.
-  And last but not least,
Ollie is going to place the top bun
on top of our pancake burger.
- That is pretty cool huh?
- Yeah.
-  Do you wanna try it?
And it is now taste test time.
Ollie is going to try
the cheeseburger pancake.
You ready dude?
-  Oh my god, all the
condiments are coming out.
How is it?
Yaay.
- Good.
- I want some syrup on it.
-  So this is kinda funny
because Ollie will not eat
cheeseburgers in real life.
- Nope.
- But he's ready to eat it like this.
- I wouldn't eat a cheeseburger
with that much condiments on it either.
- I know.
Woah!
That is some taste test.
He just took taste test
to a whole other level.
What do you think?
And there you have it you guys,
a giant cheeseburger made out of pancakes.
That's pretty cool, huh?
Be sure to check out
the iCard in the corner
so you can watch our
rainbow pancake video.
I'm also going to link Cassie's video
that she just did with Missy
doing pancake art on her channel.
-  Yup.
- Which was really funny.
So go check those out.
This was super fun huh?
-  You guys playing outside?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
You guys all ready to go?
You look so fancy.
- Where are we going?
-  You tell me where we're going?
- I'm going to (mumbles)'s birthday party.
-  Yeah.
(chill music)
(mumbles), good job.
Oh dang
Oh dang
What the heck?
Dang Ollie.
Were you cheating?
(laughs)
(chill music)
- In California, all good birthday parties
end with a good pool party.
- Yup.
- Basically.
