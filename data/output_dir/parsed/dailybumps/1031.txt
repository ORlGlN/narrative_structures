they're up there we go mommy where is he
good morning guys I'm just in my room
cleaning up and getting ready for the
day all he's just waking up from his nap
and he has been acting so weird so I
don't know if you guys can tell that
he's it's right now pointed out the good
to focus right now pointed at the
rocking chair and he's been swinging
that thing so hard back so that it hits
the wall really hard and laughs
hysterically he thinks it's the funniest
thing ever
now he's just laying down Holly are you
ready to get up I can't it's just funny
because whenever you look at a screen
like this you kind of like hope you
don't see like a ghost or something
because it's like night vision and when
I looked at it and I saw the rocking
chair just rocking by itself I kind of
freaked out for a second but then I
realized that it was him and he just was
rocking it himself really hard so
anyways we're gonna go ahead and go get
him right now
what are you doing that was mama talking
to you yeah were you hitting this sword
oh my gosh he was hitting it so hard you
can even see the marks on the wall dude
I'm gonna move your rocking chair
actually I've been wanting to rearrange
his room for a while so I might end up
doing that just because of that lunch is
served guys I've got Ollie a little
kinder and jelly sandwich and I made me
up here I feel like sandwich which is
really weird for me I'm not usually a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich type
girl but I am pregnant I think I crave
more a big glass of milk and actually
more specifically a big tall glass of
ice-cold milk this is what I craved
really but in order to drink this I have
to like drink I have to like eat like a
pin jelly sandwich or something and so
lately I've been wanting pew and jelly
sandwiches and a nice tall glass of cold
milk all are you ready to eat are you
paying with your toys where are you oh
you're in here hi
you wanna eat your lunch or you want to
eat in here
we have its picnic picnic bench in here
would that make eating lunch more fun
swear you just said no fun alright come
on let's go eat go eat lunch see eat oh
don't you that here's a pretty fun
problem to have my shorts
they don't fit anymore in fact these
shorts will literally fall off of my
hips if I'm if I have things in my
pocket and I'm not wearing a belt and I
actually can't find my belt today my
pants are gonna be falling down as I
walk around today which is annoying but
also kind of cool at the same time yeah
I've actually lost 17 pounds total which
is pretty cool and I think I can tell a
lot more in my face I think I think it
affects my face a lot earlier but it's
really cool because I just got the scale
and basically I just get up in the
morning and step on it and then it sends
the information over to my phone and the
health app so I can basically like track
everything that way what you got Olly
you got a ball like Olly look at how
they watch you go kick yeah you go kick
kick it kick it with your legs that was
Holly and I are hanging up here because
Missy is finishing some voiceover work
for her video and we were a little too
loud what are you doing what are you
doing you think something is on here and
then he's like wiping it on me
no no no idea there's nothing on that no
not again
alright I have been cleaning like crazy
and doing a bunch of stuff and I know I
probably just got done talking about
food you want another cracker but I'm
gonna tell you another thing that I've
been doing I find myself constantly
hungry now I think maybe that I've liked
turned 18 weeks I just seem to be always
hungry and I never I don't snack
normally lately I've just been in like
this like I need snack because I'm not
ready for like a meal but I'm hungry and
so I picked up these little like cheese
bites like there it's just like a
Tillamook medium cheddar and it's so
good like I feel like it gives me just
enough like just like one of these and
like a few crackers just gives me enough
like to fill my belly and make me feel
like I had a little protein I might be
like a little craving in mine but it's
really delicious and all I like to share
it with me huh
you got crackers why'd you drop it on
the ground you got them all over now
we're gonna to get Carmen to help clean
them up no crime all I need your help
he spilled his crackers everywhere
people just get those comes for me he's
like oh I was hoping it's more your
silly he's also you eatin his little
applesauce
maybe not near the white couches thank
you so I'm working at my dad's can I
just pick the big zit okay see it oh
that's gross those are like the worst
have actually gone through my emails and
then I'm going through comments and I
saw comment and someone said I feel like
all Brian cares about anymore is his
singing career and he doesn't care about
vlogging anymore and I just want to tell
you guys that is absolutely not true if
I didn't care about vlogging I wouldn't
be doing it and really the two like go
hand-in-hand
because these vlogs are our life you
know Missy's life all of his life my
life our life as a family and what we do
singing is becoming a big part of that
people change families change through
time it's kind of just how we are as
humans so I just want to say that that
yes I care about blogging a lot I think
when you do something for so long so
regularly and it's such a part of your
life now it'd be really be really hard
to stop and honestly as a husband and a
father you know a family man my main
goal is to provide for my family
so pursuing things that I like to do
that can actually do that like singing
are things that I'm gonna be focused on
and like how amazing is that that I can
do something that I love and provide for
my family with it I think that's amazing
that's the American dream these vlogs
this whole daily vlog thing that we've
been doing for almost three years is all
of our lives we're always going to show
you what Oliver's doing we're always
going to show you what Missy's working
on and what she's doing and of course
what I'm doing yeah that's all I had to
say now I'm gonna go into the bathroom
and pick up my zit a little bit more we
are headed to me and Papas right now
because all he hasn't seen pop in a
while he's been asked to see papa
oh I see Papa pay it back yeah Karl
wants to see Khoda and papa huh
I think Karma's in the mood to go run in
place so we're gonna take them over
there and hang out I have a question for
you okay do i annoy you with how much I
talk about music
no no no really no I don't want to annoy
people but like people are like say man
I talk too much about my music I think
that well it's definitely right now
because I'm so very in it right now I
mean obviously we've had people over
over the weekend for all about music
that's what you did all day yeah so I
mean it's not like it will always be
like like it's a part of my life right
now oh yeah oh yeah it would be the same
as saying like I'm so annoyed by Missy
always talking about her pregnant belly
like we get it you're pregnant yeah but
I think there's give me times when he
talks about it more and then there'll be
times when he doesn't talk about as much
and I mean same with me though there's
many times when I don't talk about
stopping can you stop talking about
pregnant belly I think that you talk a
good an amount do you think I'm a good
singer
yes I do do you like the songs that I
wrote so far I really like this there's
one particular that's just really fun
and catchy I feel like if people were
annoyed by me talking about my music
they're really annoyed right now oh yeah
no I think that it's fun I like the walk
I want the vlog the daily vlog to be
about all of us yeah like I think we
make it a point to make to like make
sure that you Oliver and me all have the
same sort of well yeah
air time yeah we don't want it to seem
like it's all about Ollie or that it's
all about Brian or all about me or
anything we want it to be totally
diverse so that everyone gets a little
piece because people are watching for
totally different reasons they could
just be watching them see Ollie but
maybe some people are really interested
in what Brian's doing and maybe some
people are super interested me as a mom
super important to kind of keep it like
everything we try and do that this car
says if I'm moving slow
there's wedding cakes on the go Missy
that car has wedding cake in there
we should overtake it and eat all the
cake Ollie put that on your head
