♫ Happy birthday to you
(cheers)
♫ Wherever you are
♫ That's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ This is home
♫ Just walking around
you never looked so good
♫ Hugging you tight cuddling
all I could, singing
♫ I am home
♫ Home's wherever you're with me
-  How's it going, boys?
- Good morning, boys.
-  Are you guys
having fun together?
Hey Ollie, guess what?
- What?
- You're gonna have lots of presents
because it's your birthday party!
- It's my birthday party!
- And guess what?
We have some prehistoric
friends are gonna be
visiting you, okay?
- It's a dinos.
- Shh. Dinos.
You want dinos at your party?
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm gonna see if
we can have some dinosaurs
at your party, okay?
Hey, how old are you?
- Three.
- Three, show me three.
Good job. You're three!
- I'm three!
- And we're gonna
celebrate in style, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
We've got some craziness
happening outside.
Papa and I have been cleaning up.
We took down the entire pool fence.
Now we're setting up a huge jumper
that's gonna have a slide
going into the pool.
And we got a cotton candy machine,
we're setting up tables.
Starting to look really good out here.
Ellie is working hard, thank you so much.
- Oh, you're welcome.
In fact, you're doing
the labor out there, so.
I don't mind this.
-  Ellie is making sugar cookies
and should I get the boys
to grab like a dinosaur
to do the foot print?
- Yes, yes.
That is exactly what I was going to do.
-  Awesome.
Hey boys I need your help, okay?
Can you find a dinosaur
toy with a really cool foot
that we can put in the cookie?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, find one.
- This dino.
-  That one?
Let me see.
Oh, those feet are much too big.
Can you find something with smaller feet.
- Yeah.
-  That one?
Oh man those feet are even bigger.
Can we find something smaller?
Whoa, lemme see that one.
Oh, I think those feet are just right.
Okay, give it to Ellie.
- Here, Daddy grab Jackson, and we'll have
Jackson make one too.
Push it hard.
-  Whoa!
- Perfect!
-  Hey look, you made
a footprint in the cookie!
- That's cool.
- I wanna eat it.
- Let's cook it and then you can eat it.
- Okay.
- Do you wanna do one more?
- Yeah.
-  Push its foot into the cookie.
-  Push it hard.
-  Rawr.
Alright, he's gonna try
it with the big one.
- Push it really hard.
Perfect.
Whoa look, it got the, there we go,
that will be Jackson's.
-  What is on your
nose? Is that a dino nose?
That's adorable.
And we are testing out
dry ice in the fountain.
Look at that.
That is so cool.
You guys look like a couple of dinosaurs
ready to party.
They both have dino noses on now.
- Check this out we've
got balloons filling up.
Balloons everywhere, I even
have a huge balloon out here.
It's a T-Rex, he's very cool.
And then we've got balloons all in here.
The party is coming
together and I'm so excited.
Everything's looking so good.
We are tearing off the
balloon dino eggs now.
- Getting there, oh there we go.
-  Yep. So we're doing that,
it's such a cold little job.
But here are all the dino eggs and we're.
Yes, my hands are so cold right now.
And we've got dino eggs
thanks to Ellie and Jared.
They made these last night.
Ellie made these today,
she's been the best.
- Well you literally told me how.
I was like, I don't wanna
dip my feet in there.
-  Oh my gosh, yes.
They look so good, they're so cute.
- They're so easy, you
just take the dino and.
- Yeah, and then we're
gonna pick up his cake
and I've got some fruit and
veggies and chips and dip.
And everything's coming together,
and the outside looks awesome.
And I'm so excited.
Finn just woke up, my mom
just went to go get him.
So he'll be out any
minute to join the party.
What are you guys doing?
- Finding dino eggs!
-  You guys are finding dino eggs?
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.
Yes we've got this little station set up
and we've got tons of paintbrushes.
They can come in here and
find the dinosaur fossils.
And they can also find dinosaur eggs.
Yes, just like that.
You can kind of brush
around and find dinosaurs.
Of course, this is for the birthday party,
you guys are starting a little early,
but I'm okay with that.
They've got shovels, and dinosaur eggs.
You guys are gonna have fun, huh?
And the chickens are excited
for the birthday party, too.
You guys are gonna love it.
There's gonna be kids running
around, looking at you,
wanting to play with you.
Gonna be fun.
-  Ollie, are you
eating a dinosaur egg?
- Yeah.
-  And how is it?
- Good.
-  Good, what kind of dinosaur egg
do you think it is?
- It's a iggysaurus.
-  A stegosaurus egg?
- Yeah.
-  So those are
the yummiest eggs, huh?
- A T-Rex egg.
-  Oh yeah, that one
could be a T-rex egg, huh?
- Look at this giant bouncy house.
This is so cool, you guys.
It's a giant bounce castle,
and then you can climb
up there, and you can go down this slide,
and into the pool.
Is that pretty epic?
Are you gonna do it?
Yeah!
- I'm just jumping.
- You're just jumping?
Hi Liv, hi Pay!
Everything is almost quite ready.
The girls are now in the kitchen getting
last minute stuff done, making guacamole,
which is Missy's favorite.
No pressure, girls.
- I wish you were here two seconds ago.
Missy just taught me how to do this.
-  Oh really?
- Wrong wrong! Correct!
-  You're so funny.
We're Californian we just
know. It's in our blood.
And Missy is cutting up watermelon,
attempting a dinosaur watermelon display.
- I don't know what I'm doing, I'm like,
I'm just going for it.
- Yeah, go for it babe.
Alright things are getting
crazy here with Jared.
We have this big, huge winged pteranodon.
And we are hooking it up to the drone.
I got the drone all ready.
We're just gonna put
the strings on the legs
and see if this works.
And then fly over all the
kids and freak them out.
- I have good faith that
it will work just fine.
-  Okay.
- You've got me on your
side, Bryan, come on.
-  And Jared knows
all about attaching things
to drones, if you guys watch his channel.
So he's kinda the pro at this.
- I guess you could say
I am a professional.
This is what I do for a living,
attach things to drones.
It's flying!
It's flying!
- Oh my god he did it!
How does it look?
- Ollie, what's up there dude?
What it is?
- A pteradactyl!
- A pteradactyl up there?
- Look!
I'm gonna catch it now.
- You're gonna catch it?
- Look, it's a pteradactyl!
- What?
There's a pteradactyl up there?
Run!
- Look who showed up! We
got Chris in the house
and he brought all the kiddos,
and they're gonna have so much fun.
- I'm gonna have so much fun.
-  Did you wear
your dinosaur crocs? No?
- I did not.
- Sad.
Just Parker's wearing dinosaur crocs.
It's the cutest thing.
What up guys?
What'd we find?
- It's an egg.
-  And now you're
gonna crack it open?
- I'm gonna try.
-  Gonna try, yeah.
Oh look, you almost got yours.
Got a little dinosaur
coming out of there, huh?
If anything, you're
getting dirty, that's fun.
So, the bouncy house is
in full effect right now.
Cassie and Ollie are climbing up,
and they're gonna go down
the slide, look at this.
I wanna see them come down.
Ooh, it's very wet over here.
Whoa!
Oh!
- That was not the proper way.
That was not the proper
way to enter the water.
-  Bailey are
you having so much fun?
- More cotton.
-  You can have all the
cotton candy you want, okay?
Hey buddy.
Are you having fun, CJ?
- Yes.
-  Is that the coolest thing ever?
- Thank you for getting it!
- You're welcome.
You know a party ain't a
party without the Vale family
up in this hizzy.
I invited you because I was really hoping
that you would play
some pranks on everyone.
- Really?
- That's gonna be happening, right?
- Absolutely.
- Did you bring some pooters?
- I'll--
- Did you get Ollie a pooter? Come on.
- I'm gonna come up with something.
- Okay.
I was like.
- I have a pooter in the car.
- You do?
Yes!
Thanks for coming, guys.
- Thanks for having us.
- Hey buddy, what?
Did you eat pizza?
- Yeah.
-  Awesome.
- Ana eating pizza too.
- Really?
How's the pizza, is it good?
This is a huge hit, you guys.
The kids are loving
this bouncy house slide.
Oh, look who's here,
thanks for coming guys.
Ready to have some fun?
Yeah.
Everyone is having so much fun
and now we are all gathered over here
and we're gonna have
a little reptile show.
We brought real dinosaurs for Ollie.
Do you think Ollie's gonna
put a snake on his shoulders?
- Yeah.
- I hope so.
(upbeat music)
- Hey Jared, that's one shell of a turtle.
This is happening.
- That's a good accessory.
- Oh god, he's going to your neck,
he's to your neck, he's
going to your neck.
- Okay, someone grab
him, someone grab him.
Someone grab him.
My life flashed before my eyes, Jeffrey.
(suspenseful music)
- Okay you guys, everyone
keeps talking about
a dinosaur, I completely missed it,
because I was inside
putting my swim trunks on.
No, I don't know what
you're talking about.
I did not see any dinosaur,
but I heard it was out
here causing a ruckus.
I'm really sorry about
that crazy dinosaur.
I really apologize.
Alright, it's time, it's hot, I'm sweaty.
I'm going down this thing, you coming?
Jared!
Come with me!
Oh yeah!
- Ain't no party like
a bounce house party.
- What up!
Dude, it looks like you were just born.
You just slid right through.
Jeffrey, wait, wait for Jeffrey.
Nine pounds 10 ounces,
it's a little baby boy.
- Let's make him breathe,
oh he's crying now.
- Alright, all three of us.
Ready?
Ready?
(upbeat music)
It is now cotton candy time.
We got a cotton candy machine,
I started making some.
And then a line started to form.
I love it.
Now Missy's on duty, let's go see
the madness that she's
living in right now.
Babe! You're doing such a good job!
Look at that, spinning cotton candy.
It's also kinda going everywhere.
Ollie, let me see, what you eating?
- Cotton candy.

(upbeat music)
It's pinata time!
And Ollie is going first.
