-  Good morning.
- Good morning, boys.
We're all dressed and ready for the day.
- Yeah!
-  Yes, we are.
Ollie is headed to school today, right?
- Yeah.
- And we got a couple
things to do before we go,
so let's go, come on.
Good morning, guys.
I am still holdin' down
the fort over here,
and I'm getting stuff ready
for Ollie to go to school.
I got this handy-dandy note from Missy,
telling me what to pack for Ollie's lunch.
And we basically had everything
except for apple slices,
so you're gonna get a
banana instead, okay?
- Okay.
-  But we've got
his peanut butter and jelly
and graham crackers, banana,
peanut butter to dip his banana in.
I think he's all set.
All right, Ollie, here's
your lunch for school,
okay?
- Okay.
-  And then
today is also Share Day,
and it's the letter M.
So, Ollie, what you're gonna
do when you get to school,
you gotta grab the monkey
that you sleep with during nap time,
and that's gonna be your share toy, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
Climb in, kiddos.
Climb in, Ollie,
walk all the way back.
(Bryan laughs)
Look at them, they just both climb in.
It is early, you guys,
but we are making it work.
I'm gonna try and get
Ollie to school on time.
Almost forgot jackets, you guys,
and it's a cold one today.
Oh, and I do not want to forget my tea.
I'm gonna need this this morning.
(upbeat music)
Not only did we make it
to Ollie's school on time,
we've got two minutes to spare.
That's pretty` good, huh, dude?
- Yeah.
-  Are you proud of Daddy, boys?
- Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)
(upbeat music)
- Can you shut the door?
Come on, try it.
You did it.
It's a heavy door.
(upbeat music)
All right.
Gotta take the picture, right, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  All right, big smile.
Good job.
All right.
I got Ollie dropped off at school
and now I'm going through Starbucks
because I need food so bad.
I drank all my tea, so
I have lots of energy.
But yeah, my belly is, like, feed me.
(laughs)
So I'm gonna get some food.
Hey, Finney, do you want something to eat?
- No.
- No?
Are you sure you don't
want a pumpkin bread?
(baby talk)
You want pumpkin bread?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
Do you want it warmed up?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh my gosh, all that looks so good.
Finn has been my little buddy today
ever since I dropped Ollie off.
We actually even went to the city
because I had to file a bunch of permits
and stuff for, like, business-y things.
And he was so good in the office,
he didn't make any noise.
And he was super cute and
everyone loved him, like usual.
I love hanging with you, dude.
(laughs)
Even though you can be
a little punk sometimes.
Don't try to kick my camera.
Oh, we got some hot and
steamy fresh pumpkin bread.
What do you say, Finn?
- Thank you.
-  You're welcome.
Does that look yummy?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
Here's the rain they've been telling us
we were gonna get forever now, you guys.
It finally just started.
I got a ham and cheese
foldover for breakfast.
This is what Missy always gets
when she goes to Starbucks.
Now I'm missing her a little bit more.
(laughs)
So it's been a really good day,
and it's actually been a
really good couple of days
with the boys, but I wanted
to talk about something
that happened yesterday,
something a little bit more serious
that I haven't really ever
talked about on this channel.
I've been somewhat open with this
on social media and Instagram.
I've gotten a lot of really great feedback
and encouragement and I love that,
but I had an issue yesterday
where I actually had a panic attack.
I try not to think about it,
because sometimes it's...
Even when I talk about it
or I remember the moment,
my body starts mimicking
those same physicalities.
It was tough.
Missy texted me something.
It was completely innocent.
I think it was about work
or taxes or something,
and it instantly just hit me in the chest.
And my heart started beating
really, really fast, uncontrollably.
I was having trouble breathing.
I was really short of breath.
I started shaking,
and I actually had to pull
over on the side of the road
and just calm myself down.
In that moment, I knew that
I was having a panic attack,
and it was so frustrating
because it's like,
I had no control, no control whatsoever
over my physical body, and that it was...
It makes it ten times scarier, I think,
when you don't know why
your body is reacting
a certain way to something.
I feel like the last couple
times this has happened,
it's when we had a fire
really close to our house
and we were packing up our house
and getting things if
we needed to evacuate.
That was when I think I last
felt something like this.
But it was tough and I had to
sit on the side of the road
and I had to calm myself down.
I think a lot of people
look at these videos
and they see us being a happy,
healthy family, and we are.
Trust me, we are.
But we do have issues that
we have to work through.
And I think that's why
it's one of those things
I wanna be open about
because anxiety and panic attacks
is something that a lot
of normal people deal with
on a regular basis,
and it's all about managing it
and knowing what triggers it.
So yeah, I wanted to just sit here
and be real with you guys for a minute
and let you guys really know
what I am going through,
and I just need to work on managing.
But if you are someone who
deals with high anxiety
or suffers from panic attacks,
I'm here to tell you
that you are not alone.
I know what you're going through, and
we can do this together, you know?
What, Finney? What?
You got some knowledge to drop
on me to make my day better?
You're all done eatin'?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, here, let me take it.
Was that yummy?
(baby talk)
Yeah.
All the doggies are
hanging out in my office.
Oh, you giving Karma love?
(Bryan laughs)
Karma needs love, yeah.
Look at this rain, you guys.
It is pouring outside.
Ooh, I just put...
which one did I do...
Citrus Bliss in this diffuser,
and it smells so good.
- Gimee!
-  Is this yours?
- Yeah.
- You can play.
Yeah.
I love his little thank-you,
it's like "raht-raht."
(laughs)
Hey, don't drop it, silly.
Ollie, how was school today?
- Good.
-  Good?
What did you share?
- I shared
my little monkey
that I always sleep with at school.
- You did?
-  Yeah.
- That's awesome!
And what did they think of it?
- Good.
- They thought it was good?
Yeah?
We just got back from playing
over at a friend's house,
and the boys had so much fun.
We kinda just had a chill day.
It rained all day,
and Finn took a three-hour nap.
So it was pretty awesome.
- A firetruck.
-  Whoa, that's
a big firetruck, huh?
Yeah?
I think it's time to put
these kids to bed, though,
what do you think?
-  Good.
- That was a pretty eventful day, huh?
(boys affirmatively respond)
You guys miss Mommy?
(boys affirmatively respond)
But you've been having
fun with Daddy, right?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah?
I love you, guys.
- I love you, too.
- If you want him to make videos,
give a thumbs-up if you enjoy it.
See you (speaks in foreign language).
- Yep.
We will see ya (speaks
in foreign language).
All right, Finnie,
you're gonna do the Bye-boop, okay?
-  Kay.
- See how he does.
All right, you ready?
- Yeah.
- And go.
- Bye!
Bop!
(upbeat music)
