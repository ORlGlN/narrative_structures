- Good morning!
- Good morning!
- You guys, I'm right in the
middle of doing my makeup,
but these boys are like
"We need to find Fred,
"right this second."
Yesterday he had some owies
and he had bandaids on, so we're hoping
he's feeling a little
bit better today, right?
- Yeah
-  Alright, where's Fred?
- Fred!
(Missy laughing)
-  I think they
might've already come out here
and found him.
Where is he?
Let's see.
Ah, there he is!
Why is he holding a pen?
- Uh oh!
-  What?
- Look!
-  Oh my goodness, what did he do?
(Missy laughs)
How did he even do that?
-  I don't know.
- You can fly really good, Fred!
He drew little elf hats on you guys.
On all of us!
That better come off, Fred.
That better come off.
Wow.
What if that doesn't come off?
What if that has to stay
there forever and ever?
- I don't know.
-  (laughs) I don't know.
Oh my gosh, look, Ollie, he
did did it on these, too!
Oh my goodness you guys,
I love this picture.
(Missy giggles)
He never cried, but he
just had that look of like
"Get me away from this man."
Yep.
And this one.
Oh, and this one.
He did Mommy and Daddy too, look!
Here, lets open it.
(Missy laughs)
Isn't that so silly?
- That's momma!
-  Yeah!
And a little hat!
That is so funny.
Did he just prank us?
- Yeah.
- Did he prank us?
Mister Fredrick, all those
little hats better come off!
Oh look what it says here, boys,
it says "ha, ha, ha...
"ha, ha...
"ha, ha, ha...
(Missy laughs)
"Got you! Fred."
He wrote a note that said
"ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
He's such a jokester huh?
But seriously,
I'm like, okay does this come off?
(Missy laughing)
Well anyways, good morning guys!
I'm gonna get these boys
some breakfast, and then I
actually have to finish getting ready,
'cause I am, like, right in
the middle of it right now.
(dramatic Christmas music)
All right.
We are off to school
and I've got to say you guys
it's a little chilly out today.
I just checked and it's like in the 40's
but it's weird 'cause I
checked the temperature
and it said it was gonna
be in the 80's today,
so I'm hoping it's not
going to be super cold.
'Cause we did not bring jackets.
I think he might have a spare
jacket in his classroom.
If it's still cold out he'll have a jacket
but I'm guessing it's going to warm up.
Allright.
One, two, three.
Look how cute he is.
I just love his little face.
Alright.
You ready for school?
Let's do it.
Ollie is off to school and now
it is girl's day or morning.
- Girls Morning.
(laughter) We've got our Starbucks
and we're getting pedicures.
- Yes.
But I actually also
really need my nails done
so I'm doing that actually later.
I'm coming back here later.
- Are you serious? (laughing)
- 'Cause it's really bad guys.
I'm not even going to show you.
Alright.
We're sitting down right now
and we're, like, in our own
private room. (laughing)
We always go to the same place.
This place is amazing,
and so we make appointments to come here
but we normally sit
out in the regular area
and, last time you were here, (laughing)
okay, first of all, Kelsey's
like the quietest person.
Way quieter than me.
And we were talking and they
told Kelsey to be quiet.
- They told me I was
being too loud. (laughing)
- I think she was, like,
really embarrassed. (laughing)
And we came today and they were
like, you get your own room.
I think it's like on your record.
They must be like, "Oh
is it Kelsey coming?"
- Oh, (mumbles).
(Missy laughing)
- She's so loud. (laughing)
Alright, I had to do fake
little flip flops. (laughing)
But I really like it.
- Looks great.
- I think I'm going to wear these all day
'cause they just look so cute.
- So cute.
- Yeah, actually, I usually get gel
so I can just put on my
regular tennis shoes again
but she suggested I just do
regular polish this time.
But it was so nice actually
being able to talk.
- I know!
- That is the one thing.
- We're requesting that
room every time from now on.
- And that's the fun
thing about that place.
We love that place.
Oh my gosh, it's amazing.
- It's the best pedicure but
you have to sit in silence.
- They're like, "Shhh"
- Unless you go to the beach room.
- And we were not talking loud.
I just want to make sure,
like, last time we were there
we were not talking loud.
We were whispering quietly
but she was like, "Shhh." (laughter)
It's like a library!
- Well, howdy hey guys.
I probably look like a shaggy dog.
I am in desperate need of a haircut
and I'm actually taking
both Ollie and Finn
to my haircut place to get
a nice little haircut huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, what are you eating?
- Cheese.
-  Cheese?
-  Yeah.
-  `He's got cheese and apples
and turkey and peanut butter.
- Yum.
Can you take a bite of your turkey?
- No.
(laughing)
- We are whipping up some lunch.
I've got paninis on the panini press.
We're literally just microwaving soup.
I got this Panera Bread
soup from the grocery store,
actually Missy got it for me.
It's like chicken and wild rice.
It looks so good.
And then I made myself
a ham and swiss panini.
Food!
Isn't food amazing?
- Ah.
- Ah.
You know it's not polite to
talk with your mouth full.
Just picked up Ollie from school.
How was your day buddy?
- Good.
-  And what is this?
- This is a present for Jesus.
-  Really?
- Yeah.
-  That's so cool.
Did you decorate this?
- Yeah.
- Nice.
As for right now, I think we're
going to go get some haircuts right?
- Yeah.
- And I think Finn is
going to join us too.
- Yeah.
- Hopefully he does okay.
(laughs) I love you kiddo.
I missed you.
(upbeat music)
Look who just got here!
Finn is going to attempt a second haircut.
With Travis who is the best.
So we'll see what happens.
- Look.
Ollie just got his done.
-  Ollie just got his hair cut.
- It looks so good.
-  We got him in the chair!
Great success. (laughing)
You got this Finn.
He's like, "Oh no."
(upbeat music)
- What?
- I'm impressed.
-  This is like night
and day from the last time.
He's doing so good.
Good job Finn!
- (laughs) He's so like,
not caring (mumbles) but thank you.
- He's doing so good.
- He is doing good.
(upbeat music)
I am so proud of Finn right now.
He's doing such a good
job getting his hair cut.
- Yeah, I'm so happy.
- This is awesome.
We have kids with gay
haircuts now. (laughs)
- At like the cutest
place and they love it.
Ollie loves it here.
I told him this morning
that he was getting a haircut
and he was like (gestures).
It was so hilarious.
(Bryan laughs)
- He loves Travis.
Travis does such a good job.
(upbeat music)
- He looks so cute!
-  Look at you!
Come here.
Ah!
Do you like it?
Yeah?
Say, "Thank you."
- Say, "Thank you."
- (laughs) Alright.
Good job.
So proud of you bud.
-  This is what
happens post haircut.
Kids just terrorize Travis. (laughs)
- It looks like I'm wearing
boots. (Bryan laughs)
-  These are so in style. (laughs)
(Finn squeals)
(upbeat music)
Hey Maddy?
- Yeah?
-  You have some
holes in your jeans.
-  (laughing) I
get that all the time.
- We are with Maddy.
You guys remember Maddy?
- Hi!
- She sang on my EP.
Her mom cuts Missy's hair
so this is our salon.
It's good seeing you.
- You too.
- You're growing up so fast.
- I know! I'm 16.
- Look how big she's getting!
-  She just turned 16
and we're going to go
see you in Annie right?
- Yeah!
-  Next year we
get to see you in Annie.
- Yeah! So exciting
-  Oh no.
Where is Ollie?
Where could he be you guys?
Oh, I see some freshly snipped...
hair right here.
(Ollie laughs)
Finn, I am seriously so proud of you dude.
You did such a good job at your haircut.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
So this is where we normally
go to the Star-lit Bazaar
but, check it out, the VAIL headquarters
is all decorated for Christmas.
Hey are you on stage?
-  Yeah.
-  Well if you're onstage
you gotta sing something.
Do you want to sing your Jingle Bells?
♪ Jingle bells jingle all the way ♪
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
♪ Oh what fun it is to ride
in a horse open sleigh ♪
- Hey!
♪ Jingle bells ♪
♪ Jingle bells jingle all the way ♪
- As you can tell, Ollie's
knowledge of the lyrics
is a little limited. (laughing)
- Hey Fred, I just ate all my dinner.
-  Yes he did.
Of course Fred was up to no
good this morning wasn't he?
- Yeah.
- He colored on all of our
pictures this morning as you saw.
We just got done with dinner
and Ollie did so good.
Ate all his food.
I said, "You better tell Fred."
So he can tell Santa right?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- They're even over
here in these pictures.
Look at this.
(Brian laughs)
Hey Ollie.
You wanna show mama what's in your bag?
- Yeah.
- Did you make this bag?
And you did that with?
Is that with your fingers?
- No.
No, I did it with a paint thing.
- Oh, like a paintbrush?
- Yeah.
-  That's so cool.
-  Okay, show me what's inside.
I'm so excited.
(Bryan and Missy laughing)
-  So is this for
mommy or daddy or you?
- It's for Jesus.
- Oh it's for Jesus
- That's for Jesus.
It's for Jesus babe.
-  I think it might
have dropped out of your--
-  Oh it fell.
Oh, here it is.
Look at that!
What is that Ollie?
- That is Rudolph.
-  Rudolph.
And is that your hands?
- Yeah.
-  Is that your hand?
Like turn it this way.
-  Oh yeah, look at it.
- Oh! I love this.
I love that this is a little ornament.
You know this goes on our tree right?
- Yeah.
- And we're going to have this
forever and ever and ever.
When you're all grown up, we'll
be putting this on the tree.
- And we're going to remember
that you made it at preschool.
That's super cool dude.
- I love this.
I feel like we've been
wanting things like this though.
Things that we get to
have forever and ever.
Like, we have that at
my mom's house you know?
- Yeah.
("O Tannenbaum")
In case you guys are
wondering, no, we have not
caught anything in the
Christmas cage in a while.
If you guys missed the video
where we caught Buddy the Elf
and did a fun Christmas activity,
I'll have it linked above
in the iCards so you can check it out.
This is our Christmas
cage and it's actually
all lit up right now.
All these lights are on a timer.
So around this time all the
lights start lighting up
and it looks really cool.
I don't want to go inside of it
'cause it might actually trap me.
That's for sure.
But yeah, haven't caught
anything here in a while.
Maybe this week, in the
next couple days we'll
catch something cool.
But at least it looks Christmas-y.
Even when it's just
hanging there. (laughs)
I'm so excited you guys!
Our very first family Christmas
album is now available
swipe up to get it and
start listening so you can
start spreading that Christmas joy.
So on the album, I did a
cover of Mary Did You Know?
and this is probably my
all-time favorite Christmas song
just because it embodies the
actual meaning of Christmas.
It was really emotional to sing.
♪ Mary did you know ♪
♪ Mary did you know ♪
♪ Mary did you know ♪
♪ Mary did you know ♪
-  Advent calendar time!
What did you get Ollie?
- This.
-  You got a Stormtrooper?
That is so cool.
Are you excited to see the
new Star Wars on Friday?
- Yep.
- The boys are opening
their Advent calendars
and, because Fred was so crazy today,
you're wearing him on your pjs now huh?
-  Yeah.
-  Who is that?
- Is that Fred?
-  Yeah.
-  Oooh, what did you get?
You got a Minnie Mouse Christmas?
Ooh look at this.
It's like a Minnie Mouse Mrs. Clause.
That's cool.
Here you go buddy.
We also got a Sven Tsum Tsum.
That's cute.
But, of course, they didn't
just open up one thing
out of the Advent calendar,
they had to open up quite a few.
Because, well, Finn got to
them earlier this morning
so I had to hide them up high.
I don't know.
These kind of Advent calendars are hard
because the kids are literally
digging into them at times.
I'm sure we already have like
five future dates opened.
- They're like toys.
So it's like different for (mumbles)
and he just opened one.
He just opened one.
(Brian laughs)
- Tell me if that happens
with you guys with your
Advent calendars.
Do you guys just rip it open
like before the days even come up?
I feel like that's what happens.
But anyway, that is all for today's vlog.
If you guys enjoyed it be sure
to give it a big thumbs up
and be sure that you go
get our Christmas album.
Link down below in the description.
- I love our music.
-  It sounded good huh?
The boys listened to
it in the car all day.
- Oh my gosh yeah.
Finn has been loving it.
Every time he hear himself
sing or say something or laugh
or whatever: "Me!"
(Bryan laughs)
- It is so awesome.
So go check out our Christmas album.
Thanks for watching guys.
Thanks for supporting.
We will see you manana.
Ollie, you want to do Bye Boop?
Or do you want to do it Finn?
- Me.

with Mr. Ollie though.
You want to do Bye Boop?
