from a crib to a full bed
so I'm very, very excited.
It's gonna be a big deal.
So we're gonna get to do that this week.
Yay, we're gonna have
a room tour this week
so you guys can see the new boys' room.
I'm really excited for them
to share and sleep together.

(gasps)
- What? You found him, Ollie!
High five, dude!
-  He has presents!
-  No way.
What is Fred doing?
He's eating a cookie and he's
got Christmas presents, Finn.
- Mm-hmm.
-  Yeah, hi Fred.
Oh, do you want me to read his note?
-  Yeah.
-  It says, "hi Ollie and Finn
Mrs. Clause saw your video of you guys
practicing wrapping presents and thought
it was so cute.
Now, she wants you to
practice unwrapping some.
Have fun!
From, Fred.
How cool is that, you guys?
So these are early Christmas presents?
-  Yeah.
-  What?
- Okay, here. There's one.
Let's grab this one.
I don't wanna mess up Fred.
(laughs) All right, Fred.
I'll leave you to it.
You finish that cookie, okay buddy?
See you later.
All right, you wanna close it?
Say, "bye, Fred!"
-  Bye, Fred.
- I cannot believe Fred brought
two early Christmas presents
for these boys from Mrs. Clause.
- Aaaahhhhh.
- There is excitement
abound in this house.
Let's see what's in here.
So Mrs. Clause watched your video.
Isn't that cool?
-  Yeah.
- Do you think she's a subscriber?
Santa's gotta be a
subscriber by now, right?
All right, boys.
You heard Mrs. Clause.
She wants to see you practice
unwrapping some presents
so, what are you waiting for?
Go ahead and open 'em.
Pretty sure this one's for Ollie
'cause it's got the red
bow which is his favorite.
(gasps)
- What is it?
- Star Wars!
-  What is it?
-  Star Wars!
-  Star Wars?
Whoa, what'd you get, Ollie?
- I got, is it, Kylo
Ren fighting (mumbles)
-  That is so cool.
It's a little Kylo Ren figure.
And what did you get, Finn?
A Storm Trooper?
Nice.
And you guys are even
dressed as Star Wars, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Mrs. Clause probably knew
- That it!
- Yeah! That's so cool!
Thank you, Mrs. Clause.
You guys wanna say thank you?
- Thank you, Mrs. Clause.
- Yes, that was very nice of you.
- Thank you Clause.
-  All right,
you boys wanna open 'em?
(Festive music)
Look at how good they are.
They even pick up all their
trash to throw it away.
That's so cool.
All right, throw it in
the trash can, boys.
Thank you, Finn.
-  Thank you.
-  Got it, Ollie?
Kay.
- You guys, today me and Bryan
are doing something really, really fun
and I don't think we're
gonna vlog a ton of it
so I thought, maybe I'll
insta-story some of it.
I'm not gonna tell you
guys yet what we're doing
but I will let you guys guess for now.
(Fun music)
All right, figured out what
I'm wearing thanks to Michelle
I would go crazy if it
wasn't for Michelle.
I'd be like everything looks terrible.
But I found what I'm wearing
and I'm really excited.
- Oh howdy, babe.
- Oh, hey.
I just got back, oh hi.
-  Aww.
- Did you miss me, too?
He was so excited.
- Like, I'm pretty sure that you walked in
like 10 minutes ago
- Yeah, but I just put the hat on
and when he saw me with the hat,
he was like, "hu hu hi."
He got so excited.
You like my hat?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Did you do some damage, babe?
- I went a little shopping.
Yeah, I went shopping with Michelle
and it was so nice to have
someone there helping me
'cause I hate shopping.
I'm just like really terrible at it
and she definitely was
like, "that looks good."
And I was like, "okay,
if you say it looks good
then I'll get it."
We are actually going to a concert tonight
and we're so excited.
- Should we tell 'em?
- Yeah, let's tell 'em who.
- We are going to see Lady
Gaga and I'm so excited.
We're going with our
friends Crystal and Galen
who are also huge fans.
It's kind of like our generation
who grew up with Lady Gaga
so it should be cool to
see her perform tonight.
- Yeah, it's gonna be so much fun
and we're definitely making
a little event of it.
They're actually picking us up in a limo,
like, they got a limo for us.
- And the thing is, it's
really hard to vlog concerts
so we're not gonna
- Yeah
-  Vlog it, but we're
gonna insta-story it at times
so make sure you're following
both Missy and I on Instagram.
- Yeah, totally, but I still have to
figure out what I'm wearing.
I have like a couple of dresses in here
that I really like and a couple of options
for the concert, but I don't
know exactly what I'm wearing
so I'm gonna go try some stuff on.
We're leaving in the next two hours
so I've got some time to figure it out.
My hair's all done.
Thanks Michelle.
- Hey guys, say hi.
-  Hi.
I'm ending the vlog
with the boys once again
'cause Missy and Bryan are off
having a really fun time
tonight with their friends
so I'm with the boys tonight.
We filmed the video, didn't we, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, was it cool?
- Yeah.
- We had a really fun time.
