- You're next Fin, he's
like, "Oh, I gotta hide!"
Get in, get in, get in!
(whispers) Now Mama can't
find you! RAWR! RAWR! RAWR!
(Fin laughs)
♫ This is our life, this is
our fun, this is who we are.
♫ This is our dream, this is
our team, shot among the stars.
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine,
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ (This is our life) Let's
life it, live it forever!
(cheerful music)
-  Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
He took it from my hand! (laughs)
-  Oh my gosh!
-  Oh my gosh!
He took it from my hand
and now he's outta here!
-  That was so good! You just like,
hand-fed your fish! (laughs)
- I never knew that was
a thing, look at him go!
(Missy laughs)
(cheerful music)
- Good morning, guys!
We are feeding our fish some breakfast.
(Missy laughs)
Literally from my hands, how
amazing is that?! (laughs)
- So cool!
- And today is an exciting day
as well because these fishies
are probably going to get a
new little fishy friend, huh?
We are on the schedule to
have our tank serviced today,
so someone's gonna come
by, the professional,
make sure everything's running smoothly,
I told him, "Bring by a couple extra fish,
and some corals", so we
can add some to this baby.
So, that's exciting, and
that's happening today.
What's all over my face, babe?
- I don't know...
- Did you see this, what's...?
- What's on my face?
- What's all over your face?
- I don't know, that's so weird.
- What did you do?
Hey Olly, what's all over your face?
- Um, I don't know.
-  You got war paint on?
- Yeah.
-  Were you in a battle today?
- Yeah.
-  Really?
- Yeah.
- No, Olly, tell them the real reason
we have some face paint on.
- We shot the Tribe music video!
- That's right! Today has
been such a crazy day!
We have been shooting all day,
we filmed the Tribe music video today,
and as you can see, there's a common theme
because we all have some
really cool war paint on.
But, you're gonna have to wait to find out
when you go watch the music video,
which will be up, #soon.
Alright Fin, show me your war paint!
- Ehhhh ehhhh
- You got war paint on
too? Ooooh, his is cool.
Where's your war paint, where's
your war paint? (laughs)
Fin has been working very hard today.
We ALL have been working
very hard today, huh?
- Mmhmm, tired!
-  It's crazy, our day is over,
and the vlog has just begun!
- Well, this month is just crazy,
we always have crazy months,
but October especially is.
- Yeah, we found ourself with
a lot of projects this month.
So, we're trying to stay
ahead and shoot those,
but sometimes it's like, an
all day thing, and it just gets
a little crazy.
- Yes.
And now we're walking
around with war paint on.
- (laughs) Yeah, just like, "hi".
-  I guess we're
just gonna wear this today.
- (laughs) Yeah, I
actually really like mine,
I'm like so proud of it.
-  You look really cool.
(playful music)
Hey Olly?
- What?
-  What are you doing?
- I'm getting into mac and cheese.
(Bryan laughs)
-  That's quite a genius way
of getting into the pantry.
- I want that for dinner!
- This pantry you guys,
it's not even that big!
It doesn't even hold that
many amazing, good snacks,
yet, the boys are obsessed, right?
- Yeah.
-  The pantry is our lifeline.
- Yeah.
(laughs)
-  And you really want
macaroni and cheese for dinner?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES!
- I think that's a yes.
(faint yell in background)
No, it's okay babe, I don't
need a makeup wipe, I got it!
(laughs)
-  Okay!
- It's not coming off!
Trying to wipe off the war paint,
and it's becoming an issue.
Hey Olly!
- What?
- Do I have anything on my face?
- No!
(laughs)
- It's um...
-  Just everywhere now.
- It's still there.
Look at this eyebrow, it's like,
darker than this one now too,
because all the black just
went into it. (laughs)
- You basically just made it even.
- What is this sorcery, you guys?!
What's in makeup wipes that
makes all this stuff come off?
Is that good for your face even? (laughs)
Okay, I think that's better.
(slow music)
(beep, beep)
Gonna throw some cinnamon
rolls into the oven,
but first, I wanted to
ask you guys a question.
Cinnamon rolls, or cookies?
I want you guys to vote,
and I want you guys to vote
with the little ICard poll in the corner,
so click that ICard in the corner,
and choose your favorite,
cinnamon rolls or cookies.
Excited to see how these
cinnamon rolls turn out.
- AaaaaaaAaaaAaAaaa
-  Is daddy giving you a ride?
- MmmMmmm
- He was a little grumpy.
-  Yeah.
-  So he needs a little ride.
-  It's been just
one of those days. (laughs)
- AaaaAaaaAaaAaaAaa
- Say hi!
- Hi!
-  Hi!
- Hey, do you wanna do helicopter?
- Yeah!
-  (gasp) Let's go do helicopter!
Are you ready for the helicopter?!
-  Oh God, oh God!
(Fin giggles)
- Three, two, one!
(Fin giggles)
-  Ugh, that
makes me really nervous.
-  Fin, wait, wait, wait, Fin!
You got somethin' all over your face!
(laughs)
-  What's on your face?
-  You want me to spin you again?
- Yeah!
(giggling)
-  Woooo!
- As soon as they land, "Again!"
-  Yeah (laughs)
-  'Do that agaiiiiin!"
-  Waaah! Scared me!
-  Me!
- You too? Okay.
-  AaayAaayAaay Yay!
- Ah, careful!
(Missy giggles)
Oh my gosh, okay, making
me really nervous.
(squeals and giggles)
It is really hard to take myself seriously
when I've got this war paint on,
but I wanted to tell you guys I am
breaking out my sewing machine!
That's right, look how dirty
and dusty this thing is.
I actually did use it earlier this year
because I was making
something special for June,
but now I'm making a costume for Fin.
And, what's funny is, because
when I made my costume
for Olly, which was the cutest costume!
If you guys don't know, I made his costume
for his, I believe it
was his second Halloween,
I'll have it in the ICard
up above, he was a munchkin,
and it was the cutest thing.
But, I did not have to sew anything,
I think I might have had to sew, like,
a little piece of his collar,
but for the most part,
it was like, buying the things and like,
cutting them, and just
like, making his hair
and stuff look cute.
This is legit, I have to make his costume,
and I'm really nervous
about it, and I'm just like,
I really hope I can do it!
And I still don't even
know how I'm gonna do it,
I'm just planning to sit
down at my sewing machine
and hope that it all just comes to me.
And of course, YouTube,
YouTube always helps.
You know, just search,
"How do you make this?",
and then it usually will tell you.
But, we'll see how it turns out,
I really hope it looks cute.
Alright boys, it's shower time!
Are you guys ready for shower time?
(giggles)
They're all trying to get a ride.
(laughs and squeals)
- Got 'em, got 'em babe.
-  Okay (laughs)
Karma's like, "I don't think that's safe."
Are you gonna go take a shower?
-  Yeah.
(Missy laughs)
-  Alright, say
goodbye to the war paint.
That was fun, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  There's nothing
that can't be done
with a makeup wipe.
-  (laughs) The faces we make
when they're coming off
though, are like, so funny.
You're next Fin.
(squeals)
He's like, "Oh, I gotta hide!".
Get in, get in, get in,
get in Fin! Get in, get in!
(whispers) There we go,
now Mama can't find you!
RAWR! RAWR! RAWR! (Fin giggles)
- Alright, kids are in bed,
and I am surrounded by
all kinds of fabric,
I'm completely overwhelmed,
I thought I could do this,
but I'm starting to feel like I can't.
But, we're actually
watching The Ring right now,
which I don't think I've watched before.
I don't recognize it, I feel
like I've watched, like,
bits and clips of it, but it's Halloween,
and I feel like I should
probably, you know,
get in those scary movies
that I haven't watched before.
- It's fun to watch
scary movies sometimes.
- Yeah, totally, like,
we've been trying to watch
a little bit more,
we're not normally like,
scary movie people anyway, so.
But, let me know in the comments,
what is your favorite scary movie?
Maybe we'll end up watching it,
and we'll see which one we like.
So, super overwhelmed,
not sure what I'm doing,
I've got this going on, but
I've never actually made,
like, an outfit that you
have to wear. (laughs)
So, I don't know what to do!
And I can't even find like,
any kind of instructions
anywhere, or like,
ideas on how to make it,
anywhere online, which might seem crazy,
but I'm serious, like, I can't find it.
So that's what I'm working on so late.
-  You can do it! I believe in you!
- I'm so tired, I'm so tired!
(upbeat music)
