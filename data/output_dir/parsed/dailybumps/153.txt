-  Hey Ollie, do
you want to see your room?
Alright, come in, what do you think?
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life; Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Good morning
- Good morning, where we at, Ollie?
- I'm at Mimi and Papas.
- Mimi and Papas, and they
are playing in their little
closet.
Look how cute this little closet is.
Finn is having a blast.
And we are really excited that
they have little staircase
closet like this for toys and stuff.
And what is really, really cool is we
brought out a couple of their
toys that used to be in our
playroom and they are actually
like the toys that they love,
but, we were cycling through
them and they got actually put
up into attic and so I just
never got a chance to like
cycle through them.
So, they haven't seen these
toys in probably almost
a year and they are so excited.
Like, Mimi and Papa have the best toys.
There's actually a lot of
toys there that I'm even
attached to because um
their toys they have had
for like when they were
little, little, little, so.
Bryan is workin' on some
stuff, so I thought I would
come over here and help
some, do some unpacking, and
I'm really excited to get
the boys' room all set up.
If you didn't know, by the way,
my parents moved (giggling).
This house now has a
bedroom for the boys, and we
are super excited about it.
So, I think I'm going to
help get that room setup
because she's been doing a
lot of unpacking the past few
days and I have barely had
time to help out with anything.
So, the boys are going to
play in the playroom while
I get your room all set up, okay.
Hey, ollie,
- What?
-  what kind of
theme do you want for your
bedroom at Mimi and Papas?
- A bunk bed.
-  A bunk, oh so
you want a bunk bed here?
- Yeah.
- That would be pretty neat.
How about dinosaurs?
- Oh yes, maybe a toy
dinosaur, like maybe this one.
-  O, Like a dinosaur
theme, that would be so cool.
So, this is the boys' room,
and they have right now,
a full or maybe it might
be a queen bed in here.
We'll eventually switch it
out, I think, for like a
bunk bed, but now that
might actually work.
Finn doesn't really like
sleeping in cribs anymore,
so they can either share
on this bed or when we get
the bunk bed, they'll share in here.
You're like you're going to
put all your dinosaur toys
in here.
- Yeah
-  Yeah
You like that big bed Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  That's pretty cool, huh?
- You gotta jump over these.
-  Okay, jump over them.
(giggling) good job.
(whimsical music)
Watch him do this all by himself.
Wow, good job, bud.
Alright, this is the boys' room right now,
we set up the bed.
He's already got his toys in here.
And I think me and mom are
actually going to run to the
store and get a few more
furniture pieces and some decor
to fill it up a little.
- Good morning you guys, from
southern, sunny California.
(giggling) The dogs are
already getting ahead in their
swimming.
Look at that, it is a beautiful
sunny day and the dogs are
enjoying it.
They love swimming and they
actually haven't done it in
a while, but I was like it's
hot today, they are going
to love it.
So, we're playing in the
pool with the puppies.
Oh, okay.
And when you don't have
anything to throw for them,
they get angry.
Oh, here we go, I got some good stuff.
Oh, you want this?
It's a plush dog toy
made to look like a stick
when I could probably
just go get a stick, huh?
(giggling) Get it Carmen, get it.
Get it boy, get it.
Get it, get it, you got it, there.
Oh my gosh, they just
jumped on each other.
Look, they are fighting for
it in the water (giggling).
Oh, come on.
(Upbeat music)
- Alright, me and my mom
have made it to Target
(giggling) and we are doing
a little bit of some fun
shopping.
We are getting stuff for the
boys' room and I'm so excited.
We've got these cute
little lamps, some bedding.
Ah, shoot, mom saves the day.
A little like bookshelf.
I'm really excited to set it all up, but
I am right now looking for a phone.
I had it in the cart I
thought, it was in my
mom's purse.
It's not there, but I do
have this handy dandy little
watch, so let's swipe up
and see if it's somewhere
close by.
(iphone dinging)
Oh, I hear it.
(iphone dinging)
Okay, it's definitely
not with us (giggling).
-  Oh my gosh
- (laughing) This always happens to me.
We were just down this aisle.
(iphone dinging)
Oh, oopsie, (mumbling) see it?
-  Up there?
- Oh, yup, there it is.
Oh my gosh, this is the worst.
(laughing) Bryan is going to watch this
and be like wow, Missy,
typical though, honestly.
- Literally bought you
that watch so you could
find your phone.
- So I could find my phone.
It worked, Bryan, see (giggling).
I'm such a dork.
Anyways, okay, we got the
phone back now we just have
to finish up a few more
items and then we're going to
go set it all up.
-  Oh my goodness
you guys, look, we have two
petals open.
If you guys saw yesterday's
vlog, I have it linked in the
I card, you saw that we only
had one and now we have two
out and they are getting bigger.
These three petals are going
to be breaking off shortly.
That is so cool.
We are going to have a brand
new little flower there.
I think the coolest thing about
plants and like succulents
and flowers and stuff
like that is just so cool
to get to see them change.
Remember these string of pearls, you guys?
I'm pretty sure these have
grown have like an inch
or two since the last time
I got them and it's just
so cool to know to like
I am the reason that it's
growing still.
Like I am taking care of and
watering it and stuff and
I don't know I think it's
just a simple concept that
a lot of people don't really
appreciate or know about
because they just fill
their house with fake plants
and all power to 'em, like
that's what we used to do,
but now that we have like
live plants, I just feel like
there's so much more energy
in our house, like you can
breathe easier, I don't know.
I might be a little, it might
be a little, it might be
being a little crazy, but yeah.
I love getting to see all my
plants and everything like
change and grow and stuff,
it's really, really cool.
I'll be sure to give you guys an update
on this little guy before
I end this blog today and
we'll see if those other
three open up.
- Alright, so we are back home and we are
going to start getting
everything together now.
We've got all kinds of goodies.
Papa's going to start
putting that together.
And if you can't tell, we
have a special little theme
we've got going on.
Actually had a lot of extra
leftover dinosaur stuff
from like a previous theme
that we had going on.
So yeah, I figured that's a
good theme that like they're
not really going to grow
out of it super soon.
It's not like a specific
theme and it's super cute, so
we're going to get this all ready now.
(upbeat music)
We have made quite a mess (giggling).
Okay, we just threw this room together.
I'm not going to show you yet,
but it is so stinkin' cute
especially compared to what
the before was when I got
here earlier.
We did go shopping, but all
together me and my dad put
this together in less than
an hour, and it is so cute.
I am excited to show the boys.
So, let's go do the big reveal.
Hey, Ollie, do you want to see your room?
- Yeah
-  Are you excited?
Alright, come in.
Wait, what do you think?
- It's good.
-  You like it?
- Yes.
-  Do you want to show them it?
(gasp) There it is.
- Wait, my dinosaur.
-  Isn't this so cute, you guys?
Oh my goodness.
See, so like I said, we are
doing a full dinosaur theme
and a lot of this stuff is
stuff we used in his other room,
and it is just so stinkin' cute.
We got a brachiosaurus
on this side, and which
dinosaur is that, Ollie, on this side?
- A tyrannosaurus.
-  Oh yeah, but
what's this one up here?
- A megasaurus.
-  No, that's a stegosaurus.
- Stegosaurus.
-  Yeah.
-  A megasaurs.
-  A megasaurus,
I've never heard that one.
-  That must be
a really big stegosaurus.
-  And then we have
this super cute just like
plaid bedding which is cute.
It's not like dinosaur
but that's kinda easy.
And then we kind threw
in some green blanket.
We've got lots of different
decor around the room.
We have a little bookshelf,
but we don't have any other
books, so we just grabbed some
of uncle and Papa's books.
And this one is Papa's (giggling).
And then they have a monitor
in here cause I want to be able
to hear them.
They've got diapers and
wipes for the boys, err
for Finn I guess.
Extra dino eggs if they
want to do some hiding,
a little magic trick with
a dinosaur, (giggling)
and then this wall is super cute.
It's just got like a
little dinosaur collection
over here with eggs and some extra decor.
We might end up getting a
few more things from like
Hobby Lobby, but this
is just kind of like the
things I had lying around
the house and then some
extra things we bought.
Oh yeah, and I don't want
to forget we have this sound
machine and it's got a
little projector, huh?
Just for you.
Yeah, so for now the boys are
going to be sharing this bed.
Eventually might get like a
bunk bed in here, but I think
this is perfect.
And it's so cute, Auntie
can still use it but
(gasp) I love it.
- And I'm sure Auntie will love it.
-  Yeah, she's like
um this is kind of like
the room I've always dreamed of.
We are home now, and Finn
is munching on some leftover
pancake.
He saw it and was like I
have to have that right now.
Even though they already had dinner even.
I was like, alright I guess
you can have a whole pancake.
It's what we had this morning, huh?
- Yeah
- But, as you can tell, it is late,
we need to get ready for bed.
And go ni-nights, okay?
- Okay.
- But we have a super fun
day planned tomorrow, eek.
Well hello there.
- Hi.
-  Brian has made
us a delicious meal,
and there's four plates here? (giggling)
- Uh, huh.
One, two, wait, one plus
-  Oh, oh hey!
(mumbling)
-  They came in
like alright mom, dad
what's for dinner?
(giggling)
-  Kids!
Yep, this looks absolutely delicious.
I am so excited to eat.
-  It's outlander night.
- I'll take this plate.
Yes, it is outlander
night and I am so excited.
I did however just watch
Kelse and Corbin's vlog.
It's so bad, you guys, it was a prank
Corbin is not only so mean that
he actually pulled that off,
but it was so hard to watch,
like I felt so bad for
Kelse.
- Corbin is staying in the
guest room so you know.
- I would think so
- He's not coming back with me.
- I had to get her back
for the doughnut, she was--
- Just so you know, Corbin
is like the nicest guy
and I'm still shocked
that he actually did that.
So, if you guys want to
go check it out, it'll be,
clicked up, er here in the i-card.
- Look at this.
Family dinner, you guys.
-  Family dinner night.
Kids are alseep.
The boys were so tired from
playing at Mimi and Papa's
they were like good
night, I'm going to bed.
Bryan made us a delicious
dinner, and now it's time
to eat, yay.
- So all the kids are asleep
and Kelse and Corbin are here
because we are going to
watch some tv tonight, but
I wanted to give you guys an
update on my little cactus.
I want to actually see
if it's opened anymore.
Oh, look, it's so close.
I'm feelin like it's like
really close to getting
(mumbling) those other three, dang.
But, we got two.
That's so neat.
That is really cool.
We'll probably get like one a day maybe.
But anyway that is all for today's video.
Hope you guys enjoyed it.
