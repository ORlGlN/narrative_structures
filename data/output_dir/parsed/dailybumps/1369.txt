it was actually me you ready to wake up
school check out your little Harry
Potter mark it's almost gone
you got the little scabby dere now huh
Hey look at this you guys
that is Ali's old mattress when we
bought him this crib and this dresser
we'd spent so much money and so we
really didn't think about a mattress we
literally got him the cheapest mattress
it was like 70 bucks and it's honestly
not a very good one but we just did
those videos on youtube.com slash baby
league which by the way the last episode
of Lucas vlogging is up on there so go
check it out the last episode of the
season nature Pedic actually sponsored
us on those videos and they got him a
brand new all organic crib mattress it
doesn't have a lot of like the toxins
that are in normal mattresses I don't
even remember what they were over there
was one really important one but
basically he's just sleeping on
something that's all natural a lot
better and since he spends most of his
time there like 13 hours a day I feel a
lot better about it huh yeah mommy feeds
me organic and now I sleep on organic
who's that though it's a little boy just
like you is that his daddy's watch he's
about to throw it in the toilet
you would never throw daddy's watching
the toilet though huh cuz daddy doesn't
have a watch we just have phones oh

are talking about that it's June 1st
that means it's like it's like
basically summer even though someone's

a good day today because we have been
literally just so swamped the past like
week or so that like I don't know we
just kind of haven't really been able to
relax I don't seem like that much like
because you guys don't really see it but
there's a lot of like behind the scenes
things that we don't blog about or we
don't start vlogging until like work
time we feel bad cuz yeah we just we
don't like to like vlog all the stuff
we're doing because obviously we can't
but then we always are talked about like
we're so busy and it's like kind of
getting repetitive we know that he's in
tiny Whitby jet it's hot at the beach
it's actually cooler at the beach that
is here oh yeah well but I don't have an
air-conditioned house at the beach well
that's general I wanted to talk to you

for an organic being that all I can eat
I want to start giving him some pinto
beans we actually been kind of
experimenting with it when we go to free
verse because Brian gets beans in there
and he really likes some so I'm looking
I see now you got some organic pinto
beans look pretty good they're high in
fiber they're fat-free low sodium
they're really good for babies so I'm
going to start introducing that into his
diet and of course I had to pick me up
some applesauce because I love this
stuff and all I still got his peach Java
sauce that he that he really likes so
she's gonna pick up a few necessities
that I've been eating I got me some
