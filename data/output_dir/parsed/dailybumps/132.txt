- The boys are hopping on
the pony rides right now,
and it's so cute.
Ollie is so excited to
ride a mechanical bull.
He saw it, and was like,
I need to jump on there.
It is actually Friday the 13th,
the spookiest day in the
spookiest month of the year,
so we're hoping that we don't
run into anything too crazy
in the pumpkin patch,
but you never know, and
it's Friday the 13th.
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live forever
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
-  Where are we at?
- Music class.
- Yeah!
(guitar strumming)
(percussion joins guitar in melody)
- Good morning, guys!
Today is gonna be a fun day,
because we are taking the
boys to a pumpkin patch,
and there's just something
about pumpkin patches
that just makes you feel super festive.
It's October, it's
getting to be Halloween,
it might a little scary,
we're hoping we don't run
into anything too scary.
But yeah, I'm really excited
to take them to the pumpkin patch.
It's something we do every
single year for them,
and it's a B-E-A-utiful day
here in sunny Southern California.
Blue skies for days, you guys.
And look who's joining us!
We got Carl and Jinger in the house.
You guys must've missed your kids,
so you're like, we'll
come hang out with yours.
- That's exactly what happened.
-  We're gonna run
around a pumpkin patch.
- That sounds so fun.
Let's go do it right now.
-  And look at you,
you're all like festive, and --
- I'm pumpkin patch-y.
-  Yeah, gonna pick out a pumpkin?
(laughing)
Finn's climbing in his car seat.
Ollie, where are we going?
- Pumpkin patch!
-  That's right, we're
going to a pumpkin patch.
The boys are in the back.
This is why I love having an SUV,
because we can all fit in here.
- Well, let's put your buckles on.
(inspirational music)
(upbeat music)
- All right, Ollie,
while we're at the pumpkin patch today,
I thought it would be
a perfect opportunity
to do another #AskDailyBumps.
Do you wanna answer some
questions while we're here?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
REXANDME asked on YouTube,
Ollie, what is your favorite movie?
- Um.
Ninjago.
(upbeat music)
Katie on Twitter asked,
what is your favorite Halloween movie?
And I have to say for me,
hands down, Hocus Pocus.
Hey, Ollie, you know this an outhouse?
- Really?
-  Do you know what an outhouse is?
- What?
-  In the old days,
this is where people went potty.
- Really?
-  And you're
standing right on top of it!
Ew, get out of there.
(upbeat music)
Look at this giant pumpkin, bro.
Whoa!
There's so many big pumpkins here,
and little cute ones,
and we're actually looking
for a white pumpkin like this.
Hopefully a little bit bigger,
so that we can we do a
Jack Skellington pumpkin
later when we get home.
That'd be cool.
Jessica Karr asked on Twitter
What do you love about fall and Halloween?
- I love the baking.
The house just smells amazing.
(upbeat music)
-  All right,
Ollie, what do you think?
First back massage.
- Um, it's tickles.
- It just tickles?
Finn, can you give him a massage?
There we go.
Whoa.
All right, Ollie got the extendable one,
and he's now massaging my back with it.
That feels good, dude.
Thank you.
Ashley on Twitter asked
are you guys planning
another Halloween skit?
I watch your previous skit and
Finn and Ollie are so cute.
Yes, we are planning
another Halloween skit.
We have something really
exciting planned this year.
Ollie is definitely
the one who has decided
what the skit's gonna be about,
so it's gonna be really fun.
And if you guys wanna watch any
of our previous Halloween skits,
I'll have all of them in the i-card,
so you can check 'em out right now, too.
All right, Ollie, Mads on Twitter asked
What are you gonna carve
into your pumpkin this year?
So what do you want to make
your pumpkin into this year
when we carve it?
- Um, Jack Skellington.
-  Really?
All right.
Then we gotta find a white
pumpkin to do it, right?
- Mm-hmm.
-  All right, let's go
find a white pumpkin, buddy.
All right, so Maisie
left a YouTube comment,
and asked why did you call
your channel Daily Bumps?
- So my previous channel was
called Bumps Along the Way,
cause I was going through all
kinds of bumps in the road,
through pregnancy, I had a bump, you know,
in my belly.
-  Yeah.
- And so then when we
started our daily channel,
we wanted it to connect somehow,
so we called it Daily Bumps.
-  Yeah.
- Pretty cute.
- We going on a pony ride!
-  Pony ride time!
You read, Finn?
- I'm ready.
- You're ready?
Finn, I think you're going on a pony
whether you're ready or not.
(upbeat music)
They boys are hopping on
the pony rides right now,
and it's so cute.
Hi, Finn!
He's all shy up on his horse.
He's got Smokey.
And Ollie is on Diamond.
And they're off!
(upbeat music)
Hi, Ollie!
- Hi!
-  Good job, Finn!
(upbeat music)
What did you think, Finn?
- Did you like that?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
Hey, Ollie, how was riding a pony?
- It was good.
-  Good.
Hey, guess who's here?
- What?
-  Kelsey and Corbin and June!
It's baby June!
Come say hi, Finn!
- Hi Finn!
-  What's up, dude?
- What's going on?
We heard there's a pumpkin
patch and pony rides.
-  Yeah.
Hi, baby June.
You ready to ride a pony?
Has she ever ridden a pony, Kelsey?
Oh my gosh.
- I don't know if she can --
-  I think she can, yeah?
- I don't know, actually.
-  All right, Ollie.
What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna ride a bull!
- Ollie is so excited to
ride a mechanical bull.
He saw it and was like,
I need to jump on there.
And I was like, really?
He's like, yeah.
You're brave, huh?
Are you strong enough to do it?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Lemme see your muscles.
Whoa!
Oh my goodness.
Our four year old is riding a bull.
(upbeat music)
This kid has no fear.
He just sees a bull, and he's like,
I wanna jump on top of that and do that.
- Whoa!
-  Uh-oh, uh-oh.
-  Uh-oh, are you falling off?
Hang on!
Next up on the bull is Finn himself.
(upbeat music)
Uh-oh, you slipping?
Oh, and he's off.
Whoo!
Good job, dude!
(upbeat music)
Ooh, these goats are hungry.
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
Ollie, what happened with that one?
- That one scratched at me.
-  Did he?
He's hungry, huh?
(upbeat music)
We are now making our
way to the pumpkin patch.
We're gonna go pick out some pumpkins
that we can carve and take home,
and set around the house and stuff.
But for those of you who don't know,
it is actually Friday the 13th.
That's right, it is the spookiest day
in the spookiest month of the year.
So we're hoping that we don't
run into anything too crazy
in the pumpkin patch,
but we're not really
sure what's out there.
But I bet it's just pumpkins.
But you never know,
and it's Friday the 13th,
so anything can happen, so.
We're gonna head out,
look for some pumpkins.
(upbeat music)
Oh my gosh, you guys,
there is a real vampire and a werewolf
taking over this pumpkin patch.
Are you a nice vampire
or a scary vampire?
- I'm a nice vampire.
-  Okay.
Whoa, where'd he go?
He's invisible, wow!
And there is the cutest little werewolf
that you ever did see
running around these pumpkins.
(wolf howling)
(upbeat music)
(growling)
This werewolf is all talk.
Look at, he's so cute.
How do those pumpkins feel?
- Mm.
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
All right, Ollie.
Vampire Ollie, we gotta
pick out a white pumpkin
for our Jack Skellington design.
Which one looks good?
Ooh, that's a good one.
You think that one?
-  Ooh, that's a cute one.
-  All right, Ollie.
We got quite a lot of pumpkins, didn't we?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Did you have
fun at the pumpkin patch?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Finn, did you have
fun at the pumpkin patch?
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
Kids are obsessed with Halloween.
Yeah, we got a lot of
really cool pumpkins,
and actually, this one's really cool, too.
It's a little fairy tale,
so I'm just gonna do this one also.
Oops, you guys.
I may have bought too many pumpkins.
Is that too many?
(upbeat music)
So they have a rock climbing wall here.
Ollie is getting geared up.
He's got his vampire costume on.
He's gonna rock climb.
Are you gonna make it
all the way to the top?
- Yeah.
-  Yep.
There he goes.
Put your feet on the rocks like steps.
There you go.
And push up.
Whoa, dude.
Keep going!
Pull yourself up,
use your muscles.
You're halfway up there, dude.
Keep going, buddy.
He's got his little cheerleading squad.
(cheering)
Go, Ollie!
Woohoo!
(inspirational music)
Missy, he is really close
to the top right now.
- He's gonna, get that button, Ollie!
- You can do it, buddy!
(upbeat music)
Oh my gosh, Missy.
Look at that.
-  You got it, bud!
-  You did it, dude!
(cheering)
He's not coming down.
There you go.
Did you see your brother
went all the way up there?
- Oh my god, that was amazing!
-  Good job, Ollie!
Four years old and he
just climbed a rock wall
all the way to the top.
- That was great.
I'm gonna take him rock climbing with me.
- Yeah.
You earned yourself a sticker.
You climbed all the way up there.
Do you see that?
That was you.
I am so proud of you.
That was awesome.
You conquered your fear,
and you did it, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
My legs are still shaking.
- They're shaking?
Are you sore?
He's sore.
He's like, I need a massage.
And the pumpkin patch was a success.
Did you guys have fun?
We got pumpkins.
The boys got toys.
Be sure you check out that i-card
and check out both Carl
and Jinger's channel
and Steps to Wander,
go check 'em all out.
They had fun here, too, as well.
So there's gonna be a couple
of fun pumpkin patch videos
hitting your sub box.
