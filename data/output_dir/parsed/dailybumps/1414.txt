guess what ders think I speak for the
bum very nice of you
this is our sign daily

looks like rocky like yeah I'm tough
what about you
cuz he's putting up some shelves oh it's
interesting I mean yes well obviously
but there's that fit on that wall you
think yeah yeah I think so too cuz we'll
probably put move the flag thing over
there to balance it a little yeah yeah
dude
come on few shops hurting yourself
that'd be great so this morning I was
doing my hair and I literally just like
went like swooped it this way but tell
me if you guys do this and I don't know
if you're really supposed to do this but
I had hairs over here that are just too
long and they were sticking out and so I
just I just chopped him I chopped him
probably supposed to do that huh no
actually the while I was getting my hair
cut the last time she was cutting my
hair and she was like huh just weird cuz
this piece is not as long as this piece
and I was like oh yeah sometimes I just
cut my hair to make it look good but it
looks good right my head oh okay what
looks good today right I'll just style
it like this every single day one hair
it's like sticking out because it you
snipped it one time ah it is what it is
do you fall asleep in your toy bucket
Hey oh there he is
hmm we have a boy ladies and gentlemen
and he wants to rough and tumble all
right won't you make a nice friend I
made chicken and mac and cheese mac and
cheese like five-year-old and oli
is
Eitan one of these pouches it's a
pumpkin and banana this morning it
actually makes the avocado into it um a
little bit of the avocado I have over
there and he hated it but he did not
like it this morning with the pumpkin
and banana so I don't know he's just uh
he's just all over the place with the
avocado how about that reason - Wow
Thank You chef chef Brian makes the best
chicken mac just looked everywhere for
one of those like leveler things like
where there's like a little bubble and
the thing and you try and like so I make
sure that these are really straight
before I like put them in there
permanently because right now I just
have like tacks holding up to see like
how they look on the wall and stuff and
Brian just showed me it that we have an
app on our phone it's like built into it
I guess it's the compass that um so
first you have like the compass and then
if you scroll over here this is a level
or it so if it's straight you put it on
it and then it is supposed to say it's
green red and let's try this up and that
means that it's straight I'm gonna see
what this thing says whoa okay hmm not
really sure what that means exactly it's
pretty cool it we have an app built into
our phone wha-wha-wha logging fail I was
just about to film a video for my
channel and I plugged the light in here
so I could have two different lights oh
it's making noise I should probably
unplug it but it fell over and one of
the bulbs shattered these bulbs were
really cheap and honestly I've had these
for like two years and I'm happy that
this thing's on here to sort of collect
all that class because that would have
been very bad so I got all these little
pins in and so now I have to actually
make the commitment and put the I think
these are called like drywall eyeball
anchors and so how to actually put these
in there but I'm really nervous about
egg just gonna have to go for it I got
to make that commitment
are you ready also poor ollie seems to
be sick got a little runny nose on her
nose
show your runny nose Oh God knows the
first time he's actually been like sort
of sick he doesn't he's not acting sick
um he's just like a runny nose and he's
kind of sneezing a little bit but I
think um it might just be him teething
he sees Nina hi Nina
I like cool puppy dog who's poor little
bruised
okay cleaned it up I'm all set up I want
to start filming now but if you guys
want to see all the cool stuff that I
got at Rosen enrolled I kind of haven't
shown you in the daily yet but I picked
up a couple things that I'm really
excited I want to talk about so go check
it out I'll have a video link to below
in the description of all the things
that I got from Wizarding World so I'm
gonna film that now while my lights are
standing and while my camera is standing
my my tripod is not broken let's get
started oh he's easy knowing okay hi
Nina
she's like oh hi I'm gonna go over here
now it's so scary
poor Nina's afraid of Ollie because he's
so so big and fast alright so as you
guys know yesterday Troy done the
locator actually found my dad you're not
caught up on what's going on I advise
you probably watch the last three vlogs
but essentially I've never known my
birth father and he was never in my life
and I just kind of wanted to search for
him and so we found him and we have his
address we have his number and kind of
have to like figure out what the next
move is I was talking to my buddy colon
and I was like he lives close to me and
he's like oh man if it were me I would
have already done like seven drive-bys
and I'm like I in a way I'm almost
tempted to just like drive there and
just like sit outside where he lives and
just watch and I know that sounds really
creepy and weird but I'm just like
there's like a sense of curiosity there
I guess but we'll probably end up
calling him I don't know if I'm gonna be
the one to make the call
just cuz I'm really I'm really calm and
like structured about it but sometimes I
literally have like these weird just
like blasts of emotion that come over me
and I just I get like really shaky and
my voice cracks and I don't know what to
do so it's a really weird situation I'm
probably gonna have either Missy call or
maybe like one of her family members
call and just hear him for the first
time and I don't I don't think we're
gonna do that today just cuz I kind of
want to sit on this information and
choice that don't make a move right away
he's like just give yourself some time
to think but don't wait any longer than
five days and also we don't know if we
want to talk to him like on the weekday
or the weekend cuz he has family and I
don't think his family knows about me
and that's the really scary part is
because I don't want to break apart this
family I just want some answers and I
feel like I'm entitled to them you know
but I we have to go about it tactful so
I just want to thank you guys all again
so much for the support and your stories
and your encouragement it means so much
to me so I've got all I down for a nap
he's actually kind of moving around
right now doing a lot of coffee I'm
really hoping he's not too sick that
would be such a bummer but I'm also
making the bed and Brian's been talking
a lot about getting a new bed he just
really really feels like we need to get
a new bed which we do I mean this bed is
so old and it's just like it's so
rickety and loud and noxious and
uncomfortable and so I totally agree
with him but at the same time it's like
it's like a big deal like that's kind of
a big purchase for us especially cuz I'm
more like I like a soft comfortable and
he wants a firm it's like when you've
got a husband and wife that wants
opposite things as far as mattress and
comfort on the bed gets a little tough
but he's also really wanting to do a
duvet which I've never I wouldn't even
say they're very popular in the US I
think they're more popular like over in
Europe I could be totally wrong there
does sound interesting because then you
just buy like a comforter and then you
just buy like duvet covers I don't know
sounds kind of interesting you guys have
to let me know if you use a duvet
and if they're like more comfortable
like what's the benefit exactly to a
devayne just like regular comforter
whenever we get a gift from the PA box
karma always thinks it's his but today
it was his look at this buddy this is
from Julia and this is an extreme Kong
this is a Kong thing it's lasted pretty
good but this was his last Kong frisbee
right and apparently they have different
levels and this is an extreme Kong boom
okay this thing smells like legit Robert
