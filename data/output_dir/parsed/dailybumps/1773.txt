look at Karma big brother he's like more
more pleased
and hiring a boy who I found it's a
brown egg this is actually from I think
the dairy when we went to the children
when you grabbed a pack of brown eggs so
I'm just gonna make my egg in a basket
or whatever you guys call it was pretty
cool actually when I did that I got so
many comments of what people actually
call it in their house so that was
really cool I'm gonna be making these
and these actually these eggs we used to
only eat these eggs cuz in Idaho
my mom raises chickens and so she gets
brown eggs and she used to just give us
a bunch because she had way too many and
I think they're a lot better I think
they're they have more flavor and you
kind of know where they're coming from
they're not like bleached on the outside
to be like the perfect egg the guys then
put the piece of bread back in the
middle so it's almost like it's now like
an egg in a hole with a rock in front of
it like Jesus it's like I made like a
Jesus cave this is running late again
you only say you're running late though
I'm gonna find on time and I'm not on
schedule and I want to be oh my god
you're huge
seriously so weird like it's almost like
waking up and then there being like a
belly because you I don't know if you
just like you don't notice it drinking
out of a mason jar like a bottler are
those new wait what do you mean you
don't know
oh you look like a goddess
my baby found these in the bottom of our
freezer they seem to have once resembled
a pizza
and so third and what we have it's a new
wave of ananka and I'm gonna see what
happens
know if that really counts as a pizza
dough
also Missy left
do you see did you know you saw cookie
down here mmm and safe for me to because
it's pasteurized that's his special ball
it's the one on the far left give it a
little belly Pete we get a little belly
be used to be like long like actually I
mean it wasn't that long but like he
went down no it's like sticking out
embarrassing as I say do you think that
the beard is getting a little crazy
yeah it is I need one of those things
tell me if they have them it's like um
four beers and you can set them at a
certain level so that I can like shave
all over this and it will look make it
look like day 14 or something like that
you know what I mean like a certain
length so lately I realize that I oh
I've been like really morning
a lot like I just really like
sweethearts and so we started eating
these like a ton and I do have to say
that I'm only like blue so Brian get all
the blue ones so if a pack only has two
blue ones she will eat all the blue ones
and that's all yeah so I only not to
take it to all these I get the nominal
one so it's kind of interesting now I'm
not usually a candy person I did not
like candy oh you actually like hate
when we eat candy because it makes our
breath smell Oh what I don't like candy
I don't like sugar that much I like
chocolate but I don't even like like
very many chocolate candy bars but
lately I've wanted like a chocolate
candy bar and I'm I'm the crime person
like like for instance with the Olive
Garden
I ate it one day and then I want it like
the next day and the next day and the
next day that's called addiction so we
just got our very first package from
England you guys
England what city in England um Shire
more Shire my oh wait time on Newcastle
Oh
Shyam or Newcastle England is that a
city I don't know we're really bad at
this and actually we were um we had our
mailing address on the YouTube videos
but it wasn't formatted and Missy's like
we should probably format it because
people like in the UK don't normally
send packages to the US and they don't
know how to how it's done so it's really
funny because they put like every like
on a new line which is fine because they
figured it out but I never even thought
about that like if I were to send a
package to England I would have no idea
how to format the address and look at
look at you guys Royal Mail it might be
coming from the Queen we don't know or
from Prince Harry he likes a party in
the US know what Missy likes oh my god I
love the color green - good job good job
yeah that's from the Harvey family oh
thank you Harvey family little boy
landing here is all here's a little
something saw and thought of you I hope
you get some use out of it living in
England I forget that some people may
not need think it's as much I have a
little 16 month old girl who loves dogs
and loves to watch karma especially
climbing trees she has a black Labrador
called Milo but he is a lot not naughty

possible yeah he's pretty naughty so
hope you know you now have friends all
around the world who support you thank
you enjoy your pregnancy Missy and take

Harvey family that's seriously so cool

like that's so insane that there's
people around the world who watch us

from Katherine Thank You Katherine for
watching and you know praying for the
baby and hoping everything goes okay
you're awesome thank you for taking the
time out to do that cuz that's seriously
so cool just opening a letter from you
guys I have in front of me a very cool
package so this package karma likes it's
no good boy this package is actually
from a viewer who lives in Idaho and she
approached us like was like a month ago
and she mentioned that she makes baby
names like the letters that hang in
nurseries for the baby names so as soon
as we figured out a name she wanted us
to tell her so that she can actually
make a set for us which was just really
really cool it was like super super nice
of her to offer to do that so as soon as
we found out the name we told her so
there's actually one viewer who knows
good name but she just sent us the
letters and we are gonna look at him
Thank You Corey garland in Idaho for
doing that for us it was just so cool
and I can't wait to hang him up in the
nursery
so we already kind of told her like what
our theme was in the baby's room and
stuff like that so having some trouble
there as usual says Brian and
see and baby wait is anyone there
yeah let me see Oh Brian Missy I hope
you love these letters for your baby boy
it was a real pleasure to paint them for
you all thank you for sharing your
journey with the world I loved and
enjoyed watching your vlogs every day
the dog treats our homemade white
chocolate bones for mr. karma oh so cool
what's next for you PS Brian don't eat
the dog treats I actually think I was
looking at this one it's Carter's okay
anchors on it karma aka Big Brother oh
boy Wow
you guys are just awesome that's so cool
look at Karma big brother he's like more
Marty's every letter is wrapped in like
an individual colored paper is the first
letter yeah that's so cool she just did
such a good job really did a good job
like matching our theme matching our
like colors and stuff like that these
are seriously amazing just amazing to
just get to like see his name like right
here it's just so like real I can't I
like I'm like itching to get these on
the wall but we can't until we announce
it but it's just amazing getting to and
they're just a they're perfect think
they're absolutely perfect this is like
the first decorations for the nursery
mm-hmm and so we now we know like even
what colors we can throw it to like
accent in things so yeah thank you so
much Cory but these are like amazing and
like it's just so cool like I don't does
she have a business or something if she
had a description check it out because
seriously yeah just very much us very
just pretty and simple and perfect and
it's just awesome so I'm totally bummed
because a couple days ago Missy and I
actually like rowed out what we were
going to say for our name reveal video
and it was like really nice it took took
us like a couple hours to do right and I
had it all in my computer and so I just
went on it because we are about to do
the video and it's gone like the whole
thing is gone I'm just so bummed because
like obviously it was like a first draft
but it was like such a really good
outline of what we really wanted to say
is now I'm sitting here redoing it all
and trying to make it perfect because we
are definitely filming it tonight we
just we want to get it done tonight so
we just can't wait to show you guys
karma keeps begging for more treats
he just wants more he loves them no
Brian's a little upset that it said that
that he did not write but she out
of the winky face so I think that means
if you really want to try it
you can't good try the chocolate part
not the non like the bone part
I'm actually quite on it so while we
were getting ready to film the name
Orville Ellen instagrammed a picture of
a belly painted and said to send us a or
send her a creative belly drawing
painting type of thing to win tickets to
the Mother's Day show so we came up with
this little idea because they announced
well they announced finding dory today
which is like huge and Ellen loves it so
right now we're doing finding baby and
I'm just coloring it in making sure
everything's non-toxic of course but
something that will get our attention
yeah I'm really excited okay so here is
the finished product on my vine finding
baby susan 13 and so actually here's the
picture instagramming that right now I'm
so excited I think it looks really good
I think that with such short notice and
like trying to plot something really
quick I'm hoping it will like kind of
grab her attention you know like because
she's obsessed with finding Nemo and
finding Dory obviously just announced
today so it might have just been like
hopefully the right the right thing for
her tit to catch cry but we'll see
all right let's get to it mama I'm no
race one that we haven't had a huge
amount of people who sent it but someone
made a statement because it sounds like
a famous actress and her last name would
sound really weird next oh yeah Dakota
which is a boy's name and a girl's name
but Dakota landing was a lot like Dakota
Fanning so okay it's not Garret five
names oh man this one that I'm about to
erase is actually a pretty popular one
I'm gonna say I wanted it so badly it is
not the album oh yeah I'm laning Liam
Landing Liam Liam lately yeah so in the
end it just wasn't the right name okay
so we actually have you guys come and
try pirate a cop karma doesn't like it
when I talk to you guys that's just it
yeah okay so I have you guys set up on
the tripod right now because we're gonna
do something a little different
it is hump day Wednesday so we wanted to
do something really cool where we can
sort of like interact with you guys a
little more so from now on every
Wednesday that you guys watch us on the
vlogs we're gonna go through some of
your comments and read a few so Maisie
and I have a couple that we're gonna
read out loud and respond and just so
like you guys have an opportunity to
like hear us like I guess I like because
sometimes I like to go through the vlogs
and I like to like respond to a few
comments but I can't obviously I can't
do that like all the time but I think
it's even cooler good for them to feel
like we're interact yeah I like face to
face like we want to interact with you
guys because you're awesome and I think
like I'm saying face to face but really
I mean like face to screen I guess her
face is right there technically every
Wednesday we're gonna do a new thing and
I'm gonna call it a big comment
when way
and if there was like a cool effect on
that then good job right but I'll try
okay so this one actually just happened
and I thought it was a perfect way to
explain something that actually really
bothers me crystal said why have Bryan
Lanning as his name on your phone or on
your phone not hubby or anything okay so
basically she's referring to yesterday's
in the other games vlog I had answered
the phone and it says Bryan Lanning as
his name instead of hubby or lover or
something like that right the reason is
is one we share contacts yeah we share
contact so like whenever I add a contact
in my end of my phone it automatically
Missy's so we're never like scrambling
to see like oh well whose phone is that
in yeah Oh II see it actually does
bother me those I used to have like like
bright guy with a heart and those you
know all this Brian guy did you see
there some bright guys yeah like all
those cute little stuff and then like of
course my mom would be mom and my dad
would be daddy in yeah I have like names
for people know now when I answer my
phone mine for my mom
it's Suzy and Hollister very like formal
I guess it really does bother me but is
he also is very like I'm very OCD about
the information on my phone I basically
want my phone so like always look like
it just came out of an Apple commercial
I have a really really cool comment that
we got on yesterday's daily it's myth
chick 23 love you guys remind me of Shay
and Colette before they got all famous
that is like such a huge compliment like
thank you guys so much or thank you am
ia chick 23 for saying that because I
think that in a way we do sort of have
similar personalities like I am very
outgoing obnoxious annoying and Missy's
more like reserved and like shy and like
tries to I guess like keep me in line or
like balance me a little bit
and then I got another one here actually
you just commented jazmyne den a you
said I love you guys way too much the
first thing I do when I come home is
watch your new videos can you say
obsessed much you guys make my day and I
just thought this was such a cool
comment because not only are you being
like so nice but the truth is like I am
so obsessed with you guys like and you
seriously make my day like when I go on
our video and I'm like seeing comments
about you guys
you know like talking about things were
doing or like giving us suggestions or
stuff like that like I seriously
obsessed with that it's so cool this
little community that we created in just
a short amount of time for our daily
vlogs and I just love it and I think
that's a huge thing that I love about
YouTube is community and like we can
interact with you guys and you can
interact with us and in a way like
you're watching a show every day you
know and it's a lot different than just
watching a scripted TV show every day
because you actually have influence on
the show you guys right now just by
sending us comments are directly
influencing our show and throughout the
day when we read your comments you are
directly influencing it because we're
like we can mention oh hey we just got a
comment about this and now I'm going to
tell you guys about it because you're
inquiring about it so I think that's
like one of the coolest things about
YouTube so this one was by Char Char
beeps 23 and she said haha a poor Missy
I thought she was gonna cry when you
woke her up I seriously thought I was
going to also it's so like sad one of
the week of you early and if you guys go
and watch that blog it's so funny
because her I literally got the first
thing she said she was like her voice is
all like light like and then it like
immediately changes
like you're gonna die oh okay so you
know that thing when you are sleeping
and probably later than you should and
someone calls you and you instantly have
to like act like you've been up for
hours and went for a jog and you clean
the house and you get breakfast and like
you have to like put that in your voice
I'm really good at that throw at it I
will literally wake up open my eyes grab
my phone
hey how's going I'm really good at that
and Missy I panic actually so you so bad
in the morning she can't even hide it
like Oh anyway I hope you guys like this
we're calling it epic comment Wednesday
so you guys leave us epic comics all
throughout the week and then we'll take
some time out on your hump day to
respond to them you can hashtag DB epic
on Twitter or follow me at Brian Landing
