home automation system I'm really stoked
about it
I can like control the lights
door locks the thermostat we have
cameras that we're still setting up and
basically like all basic security stuff
I'm just so stoked because it's like
obviously you know in California you
need security and stuff but like I'm
just like geeking out because I can
literally like lock my front door or
unlock it I just unlocked it I'm pretty
excited to have a nice system for the
house and just to be able to even though
karma is here like even if we leave and
he's a pretty good guard dog it's nice
to be able to even check on him with
like cameras and stuff - what's that
you're hearing the door go on and on
they're freaking you out
let's go fine come on baby did you have
a fun day we have had such a busy day
I've been hanging out with my friends
whole days actually just left but we had
such a fun day whirs hang on the pool
and take some we and talked and talked
and talked cos we're me and her like
that I've known them like my whole life
so we've always been friends and my this
is so tired he took like this long long
nap like a very very long nap being wake
up to like maybe two o'clock which is
crazy for him and then it was just like
that weird point where if you could give
him an ass and he'll sleep way too late
so
now he's just ready for bed it's really
early get it all done how come out then
okay but first you have to brush my
teeth hug you guys I just want to go in
the pool that's all I want to do right
now
but I got this remember when we got this
fish from Walmart it is so stinking cool
I charged with the GoPro and I'm gonna
jump in the pool and show it off to you
guys I was like really surprised it's
little tiny fish can do so let's go
check it out where it is what
everything's better under the sea here
we go
I'm seriously just like so fascinated
with this little thing it like dives and
twirls and hop on the water like that
that's cool cool just tie him into bed
hopefully he sleeps good tonight
sometimes if he misses that second half
then he's overtired and then he usually
will wake up and be grouchy he's in the
pool
um and not sleep is good because usually
he actually sleeps till around 1 o'clock
and then he wakes up to nurse and then
he'll usually sleep until morning so
that's if I'm lucky if I'm not like you
then he'll be up in like a couple hours
and not be too happy oMG I'm freaking
out you guys oh my god

sitting on the concrete
