Labor Day
um Labor Day you get an extra long
weekend because why cuz we're lazy
no I think it's has something to do with
the labor movement like they wanted to
give something to like all the workers
like a long time ago I don't know do you
guys know what he's all about living on
the comment I know is that in Seattle
there's this big huge statue of this guy
who goes like that oh yeah with the
hammer
I mean hammers all the time all the time
24/7 except for one day he gets off
Labor Day that's true when I was in
Seattle the statue in Seattle right now
is not moving that's amazing it's only
day off oh oh oh you never get the day
off never get the day
ah okay so today I was changing his
diaper this morning and it was the worst
diaper in the world you guys I kid you
not it was this really nasty color and
last night he clearly had quinoa and
cottage cheese for dinner because that's
what Mimi and Papa gave him not cool
seriously not cool babe I I like gagged
i gagged three times and I felt vomit
start to come up my throat but I had to
hold it back it was the worst I have had
one of those poops and they were like

thank Remy he's actually really smart
yeah he will not try and go down the
stairs or so because he knows he doesn't
know how goddamn useless he has holds
his arms up like right my picture no
transport yeah so today is Labor Day I
guess you're not supposed to work on
Labor Day so a lot of people have the
day off unfortunately a lot of people
don't have the day off and I think if
you're gonna have a holiday like this it
should be like Thanksgiving and
Christmas you know
like actually I think McDonald's is open
on Christmas
honestly actually some people I never
get a day off Jack in the Box is open on
Christmas which I just think is kind of
ridiculous
I don't wash on Christmas so they stop
being open on Christmas yeah but I'm in
a labor day is an interesting law
because it's supposed to be so that
workers don't to work but like the
cashier they're still working at the
grocery store
yeah people are still definitely working
so we're gonna try and take a little
break though that's why we're gonna ot
it today for you guys well you think
yeah I think we're good have a little
barbecue hang out at the fan and you
know chill chill we're gonna have all
the family come over and basically yeah
just eat and play video games and like
did you guys see our new bill did you
show more new pillows these are like so
every time we go to Target we want to
get new pillows for the couch because we
want them to have like all different
kinds of clothes so we're kind of going
with a color scheme I guess here blue
and yellow love this one first of all I
love just the feel and like it's so
comfy
and this one I like but now I feel like
that one it doesn't
well it's a little bit smaller we didn't
get the right I think it matches got
your own blue you guys know the tall's
what you think
do these match I don't know but normally
pills are so expensive they're like 20
bucks and I'm like I know I'm not paying
$20 but these were on clearance for
$12.50 so we were like yeah and actually
babe they probably just rotate them so
we should always just get the pills that
are on clearance and then we'll have a
couch full of pillows I really want this
pretty yellow like fluffy really one
