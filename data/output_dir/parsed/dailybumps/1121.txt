like my aunt my cousin's wife's mom mom
yeah so it's my cousin's mother-in-law
so the two moms are going and then
actually a lady which I'm sure you'll
hear more about her but she is actually
a dental hygienist and she's going there
to help clean a lot of the people's
teeth and what I don't bet on that
yeah cleaning so anyways it's kind of
nice because I don't have to take him to
LAX which is kind of Olive overcome
