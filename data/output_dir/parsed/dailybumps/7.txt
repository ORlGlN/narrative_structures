- Hey, everyone, and
welcome to today's video.
A big shout out to Mattel
for sponsoring this video
and for helping us create it.
(playful music)
- I'm so bored.
What's that?
It's a map to Hot Wheels City!
Oh, no, the creatures are
taking over Hot Wheels City!
I have to warn Mom.

(relaxing music)
- Snake! Help!
There's a snake in the house.
Help me!
- This is the first creature.
I'll save you, Mom.
- Help me, help me!
Thank you so much, Ollie.
You're so brave.
I don't know where that
creature came from.
I hope there isn't more.
- Don't worry, I know
what to do with them.
(upbeat music)
(whistling)
(screams)
- There's a giant spider!
Spider!
- Oh, no, Daddy.
I'll save you.
- Spider!
- I'll save you, Dad!
- Ollie, get the spider!
Oh, it's so big and scary!
You did it!
Thank you, Ollie.
- No problem.
You will just have to be brave like me.
I'll put this one with the other ones.
(rhythmic music)
- Gotta feed the fish.
Oh, no!
Piranhas in the tank?
Help, Ollie, help!
- What, Mama?
I'll save you, Mama.
Got it.
(upbeat music)
(monkey noises)
- I'll save you, Fin.
I will save you from the evil monkey.
- This is the last piece.
Hot Wheels City needs to have power plant.
I've got my power plant, and
my Hot Wheels City is complete.
Time to fuel up.
This is the bad guy.
We gotta put him in jail.
Oh, no, he escaped!
This place is the tire shop.
-  A big shout out to
Mattel for sponsoring this video,
and for helping us create it.
- He got new wheels.
Chomp, chomp.
(monkey noises)
- The creatures are taking
over Hot Wheels City!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Go! Go!
Get the door! Get the door!
Shut the door.
Shut it!
Shut it!
Shut it!
The creatures...
How are we going to stop them, Ollie?
- I don't know.
(monkey noises)
- These creatures need to be defeated.
- The creatures are going
crazy in Hot Wheels City
right now, huh, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.
I think I hear Mama in there.
- Let me check.
- What is she doing?
What is she doing?
- I'm going to defeat you, monkey.
- Mama's shooting at the creatures.
- No way.
- Yeah.
- Go help her.
It's scary in there.
- The snake is gobbling
up all our cars, Ollie.
You stick this car in here
and then press the button.
Yeah, he got him!
He ate him.
Okay, now we have to defeat him.
So, let's stick him in here,
and get it to go down the slide.
One, two, three...
Get him!
Yeah!
- We got him!
- And he found our car.
- We got you, snake.
(screams)
- All right, let's get rid
of these pesky piranhas.
Drop your car in there and
watch the tank get destroyed.
Do it.
Whoa, we did it!
High five.
- Now the piranhas won't eat our fish.
- Yep.
This spider is eating up all our cars.
Watch this.
Go!
(cries out)
All right, we have to defeat this spider.
We're going to take the car and go...
(car crashes)
Let him go.
Yeah, we did it!
Rumor has it, there's a
nasty gator over here.
I wonder if he'll get us.
We're not doing anything.
(screams)
It's a gator.
Get him!
We've got to close up this shop.
Get the other side.
Hurry!
Get it!
We got him.
High five.
Yeah.
He got you.
(Ollie laughs)
- We had so much fun playing
with the Hot Wheels City
set today, didn't we, Ollie?
- Yeah!
High five.
- What creature is your favorite?
- The snake one.
- The snake one is so cool.
I seriously love seeing
Ollie use his imagination
with Hot Wheels.
I think it's like the coolest thing.
You told some cool
stories today, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- With your Hot Wheels.
That's pretty neat.
And, the Hot Wheels fun
does not stop there, because
Hot Wheels is launching
their own original show, and
they sent me an exclusive
trailer to share with you guys.
- Let's show the clip.
(cars revving)
(fast-paced music)
(tires screeching)
-  New news.
Creatures have been
spotted in Hot Wheels City.
(fire bell clanging)
-  We just got
word of a huge creature
coming our way, boys.
- That's ginormous!
- Partly cloudy with a chance of spiders.
They're headed for the tire shop.
- Let's wedge 'em in there.
(toilet flushes)
- Special thanks again, to Mattel,
for sponsoring this video
and helping us create it.
We had so much fun.
- Yeah.
-  Hey, parents, what
is your favorite creature
that we showed in the Hot
Wheels City set today?
Let us know down below in the comments.
And if you enjoyed this video,
be sure to give it a big thumbs up.
- We'll see you next time.
- See you next time.
Bye.
- Bye, you.
(happy music)
