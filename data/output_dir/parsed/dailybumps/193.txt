What are you doing today?

of a fidget spinner.
Did you know that, so you

He's four years old now

You know that?
He's like, dad, can you stop
getting emotional please?
- Alright, it has been
kind of a crazy morning
but it is now time to
go shopping for dinner.
I really wanted to make
something yummy tonight
because me and Kelsey are so excited
for Outlander tonight.
- I know, I cannot wait.
- If you guys don't know I
am obsessed with Outlander,
I've talked about it for years now,
they're starting their
third season tonight
and I thought it'd be really fun
to make like, a yummy like meal that--
- We're making this an event, okay.
- Yeah, it's an event.
It's not probably like, a
Scottish meal or anything
but I thought it sounded yummy
so we're gonna get the
ingredients for dinner.
Yeah, hopefully I can make
something good to eat.
We'll se how it turns out.
- Hey Ollie.
(laughing)
What are you doing?
- Playing with toys you silly squirrel.
(laughing)
- Alright, we went to the store,
I think we got all of the ingredients.
I've never made this meal before
so I don't know how it's gonna turn out
but now we are definitely
in need for Starbucks.
So we're gonna run in
and get some Starbucks.
Sounds so good.
I actually haven't eaten lunch today,
probably should do that.
But--
- It's too late.
- Starbucks sounds good,
I'll just have dinner later.
- (garbled singing) This is home.
- Filming for a new episode
of our Facebook show today.
We are reacting to a very,
well actually, Ollie is
reacting to a very old,
funny video of himself.
- It's gonna be really cute.
- It's gonna be really cute
and it's gonna be for Episode Two of
The Fantastic Family Time Machine
and we'll let you guys
know when that's up.
But that's what we're working on today.
Ollie, what did you do to your foot?
- Oh my god, blood.
-  You got some blood on it?
Did you hit it on something?
-  On the chair, I falled.
-  Oh, that's when
you fell off the chair?
-  It's not that bad though.
Momma's gotta put on just
a little band aid, okay?
- He's actually, typically a
pretty afraid of band aids.
-  Pretty anti-band aid?
-  I like this one,
I don't like other band aids.
-  Oh yeah, I like when
they have characters on them.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Also I'm like, um, you have a band aid
because I don't want you to get
blood all over my stuff, so.
(laughing)
- There you go buddy.
-  Here, let me put one more
so it can go all the way around your toe.
-  It'll make
you feel better, okay.
Don't be afraid, it's okay.
-  Okay, so we'll
just put this there,
bring it around.
-  There you go.
You gotta put band aids on
when you cut yourself, okay.
Because it'll help.
- All better, okay.
-  Now go play dude.
- He's like (gasping).
(incoherent baby talk)
- You need a bib aid?
Let me see your toe.
-  (mumbles) have an owie.
-  You know he doesn't
but we can just put a
little something on there.
You want it down there?
- Yeah.
- Finn always has to
have whatever Ollie has
so we're in this stage right now
where if we buy Ollie something
you better buy the same
exact thing for Finn.
Do not buy anything different.
- Yeah, he always wants
what Ollie has, huh?
Alright, let's get it on there.
There, all better.
(kissing noise) That better?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, can Momma have a kiss?
-  Wow, Missy.
Such technique and art and
beauty and pie crust making.
-  I'm honestly
impressed with myself, you know.
-  This is
beautiful, look at the way
it flows in the pie pan.
Yeah, your pie crust
looks beautiful, babe.
Looks amazing and homemade.
Put so much work into it.
-  I worked so hard on it.
-  I know.
- Bryan.
- I know.
- So officially I am
making chicken pot pie,
which I have never made but I'm excited.
I think it's gonna be good.
Bryan was like, I really wanna
try to make chicken pot pie
and I was like, I think my
mom's made it a few times
and it was really good.
So I think it's pretty simple.
You basically just mix a bunch
of vegetables with chicken
and cream of chicken, put it into a pie,
pop a pie crust on it and there you go.
Hopefully, I'm gonna
experiment with a couple
different recipes.
I really wanna use
Bisquick as the pie topping
because I think it'll be like
a really yummy, crispy top,
but kind of like, bready
that sounds good to me.
So, gonna cook up some chicken now,
and mix it all together.
(soothing music)
- Spotted these boys
playing in the fountain.
Did you pick Momma flowers?
Alright, I have something
to say about the flowers.
I think it's super cute
that you pick flowers
for girls and stuff, but those
flowers are really gross.
They smell, they have the grossest smell
and they bring them inside the house.
-  Oh yeah.
-  You smell it?
Smell it.
- Yep.
-  They're yucky, huh?
- Uh huh, I'm gonna throw it on top.
-  Okay, you can
throw it, it's okay.
Let's go find some flowers
that don't smell, okay.
Look at this random flower.
Actually that's kind of beautiful.
I didn't know I had a flower there.
Ollie, I think Momma would
really like this one.
I got some scissors,
let's cut this one, okay.
It's a pretty cool looking flower.
And we have a bunch over here too, huh.
Should we pick a couple?
- This one looks good.
-  That one looks good?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Oh my gosh, there's a big bug.
- Whoa, Ollie, do you know
what kind of bug that is?
- What, I don't know.
- That's called a preying mantis.
- Yeah, he get all the, he get
rid of the bugs I don't like.
- Really?
- Yeah.
-  That is so cool.
-  But you can't squish him.
-  He is huge you guys,
Oh my gosh, lookit, he's
looking at us right now.
That is incredible, good find Ollie.
-  He doesn't talk.
-  He blends in with
that flower pretty well, huh?
(soothing music)
- What, are those from our yard?
-  Yeah.
- Did you pick these?
- Yeah.
- These are so pretty.
- And I found a preying mantis-saurus.
- Preying mantis--
-  A preying mantis.
He kind of looks kind of like a dinosaur
so he calls him a preying
mantis-saurus, it's huge.
- That's cute, this is so pretty.
I can't believe you got it from our yard.
-  Yeah, I know.
(soothing music)
- (mumbles) coming.
-  Paris, look at you.
Did you get a cut?
You look so fresh, so clean, don't you?
We actually have a mobile
dog groomer here today
doing all three dogs today
and I guess Paris really needed a cut.
He looks so cute with his floppy ears.
- Alright, the boys told me
about this preying mantis-saurus
and I thought, let's catch it,
that's what I used to do
when I was a little kid
and then we'd just look
at him for a little bit
and let him free.
-  Yeah.
- So let's see if he's still there.
-  Where is he?
Oh I see him, yep.
- He's huge.
-  Nice work Momma.
- Look at him, he's
climbing his little thing.
- I wanna see, I wanna see.
-  Come look, Ollie.
-  He's big.
-  Isn't that neat?
-  Be really careful with him.
Isn't he cute?
- He's real.
- He's so cool looking, huh,
because he's like, all green,
here, let Mommy hold him, all green,
he almost looks like he's
got like leaf textures
on him, huh?
- He does.
- He looks like a leaf.
(gentle music)
Okay, we're gonna set him free.
Say bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
(laughing)
Bye.
- Here boys, let's take a picture.
-  Oh shoot, he jumped, oh my gosh.
Scared the crap out of me.
(laughing)
- Bye.
- Bye.
-  Look at him like looking around,
he's like, did you catch me?
Or did you, did you, or
you, it was you, or you.
(upbeat music)
- So while we're finding some
amazing creatures outside
there's also some amazing things happening
inside the house today
and I wanted to show you guys
this amazing cactus plant that
I got at the farmer's market.
Check out this star flower
that is blooming on it.
I am blown away by this
and I didn't even know this was a thing.
This is like an actual flower,
it's like really furry,
wow, it's actually really
rough too, that's crazy.
It's blooming from these
two cactuses right here
and actually there'll
be two more right here.
Check out these buds right here.
This is so cool.
So I found this at the farmer's market,
I've got it on my desk.
Next on my other little plants
and an SD card, of course.
Yeah, but that is that
little string of pearls too
that we're hoping takes
off, that'll be really cool.
Seriously though, I think
nature is just amazing
and I love being able to like
share it with our kids
and stuff on our property.
It's pretty amazing.

of a scorpion, obviously.
