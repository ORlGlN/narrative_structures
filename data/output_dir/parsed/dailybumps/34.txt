- Good morning, guys.
I've had a really, really crazy morning.
I was actually planning
to go up to my horse,
because he needs a little medicine today,
take Ollie to school, and
I'm actually also headed
all the way an hour and a half
to a doctor's appointment for Finn,
which I'll tell you more
about in a little bit,
but I basically did not
have time for anything
and I forgot my camera,
so I'm using my phone
right now to vlog.
Ugh, I'm so bummed.
So my dad ends up taking Ollie
to school and then he's taking,
he's actually gonna take care of my horse
and give him his medicine,
which I'm super bummed
that I'm not able to do,
but, yes, I am off to a quick
little doctor's appointment.
Well, it's not quick.
It's gonna take me a while,
and I got my mom with me.
I totally forgot my camera.
I forgot my camera, Mom. (laughs)
- Such a nube.
-  I know.
We're driving to San Diego, Finn.
- Yeah!
-  You ready for the drive?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
All right, we have made it
to Rady's Children's Hospital,
which is down in San Diego
because Finn has a little
doctor's appointment, huh?
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna be good for the doctor?
- Yeah.
- So if you guys don't
know, he's had a couple
little issues since he was born.
One is a slightly enlarged kidney,
and he hasn't had an ultrasound for this
in maybe a year?
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe a year.
- He goes for it like once a year now.
- Yeah, really, really interested to see
if it's cleared up yet.
It usually clears up at a young age,
but if it doesn't, he
could end up having surgery
if it gets worse or--
I don't even know, if
it stays where it is,
I don't know if they'll--
- If he's not having
issues, they just watch it.
- Yeah, but it is annoying,
because when they have to watch it,
you have to literally come down here
to get these ultrasounds, and not fun
as they get older.
- Yeah.
- I don't know how you're gonna do today.
And then he also actually a little heart
issue that we have to keep an eye on too.
But today is just about his kidneys,
so we're gonna go see the urologist
and do an ultrasound on his kidney
and see if it's enlarged or anything.
- Yeah.
- I hope it's all better.
- Yeah.
- He hasn't had any issues with it.
He hasn't had any UTIs.
When he was first born,
he had a UTI, right?
-  Early on, like, yeah.
- Like super, super early, he had a UTI.
He hasn't had any issues,
so I hope it's all better.
It is really scary coming
to the hospital, though,
because I feel like
hospital is full of people
with the flu, and I
really don't want anyone
to get the flu, so let's
keep you nice and safe, 'kay?
I got my baby carrier so I can
not let him touch anything.
Finny, are you getting nervous?
- Yeah.
- Don't be nervous.
It's gonna so fine, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)
(upbeat music)
I'm home!
And I have my camera again.
Uh, it's so hard vlogging
with a phone, you guys.
I am home and Ollie's home, oh,
I was gonna show Ollie.
Ollie, hi.
- Hi.
-  How was school?
- Good.
-  Are you watching Coco?
-  Yeah.
-  You had a good
day at school, though?
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.
He's home and Finn is taking a nap.
Bryan has been working all day,
so that's why you guys
haven't really seen him much.
My mom and dad are here and
my sister's coming over,
but I have to go run up
and see my horse.
I need to see how he's doing,
make sure he's okay.
I'm really excited to see Nacho.
I miss him.
I mean, I saw him yesterday, but (laughs)
I do miss him.
You gonna hang out here for a little bit
while I go check on Nacho?
- Yeah.
- Okay, be good.
All right, I've got Nacho out
and I've just been kinda cleaning him up
and looking him over.
I've got him saddled right now
and an English saddle.
I have been riding English
the past couple days.
I think that he prefers English,
but I'm actually just going to lunge him
to see how his foot is.
But I was telling you guys,
he has these hives on him,
and he still has them,
even after my dad gave him medicine.
I can show you.
See those little lumps right there?
Poor bud.
So the vet should be here tomorrow
to take a look, and hopefully
it's nothing too bad, huh?
I'm actually using a
different bridle right now
because I'm gonna lunge him
and my other bridle just doesn't really
give me that option very easily.
And yeah, I'm using a saddle,
I'm just borrowing it right now
to see if I wanna actually
make the investment
into my own English saddle.
'Cause he definitely prefers English,
and I'm just not 100% sure
that his Western saddle
is fitting properly,
so I just don't wanna risk it.
Let's go give you a little exercise
and see how you're doing, 'kay?
(laughs)
All right, so I just lunged him
and he's looking pretty good.
He is still definitely off
when I lunge him like one side,
so, like I said, the vet's coming.
I'm giving him a little ride
just to see how he's doing.
They actually have these jumps out.
He keeps looking at them
like, "I wanna jump that."
(laughs)
He actually has tried a couple times
to line himself up, and I'm just not
there yet to jump him,
but I think he would be
super fun to jump eventually,
but he looks at them
like, "Hmm, I wanna jump
"over that thing," so I do
know he's actually jumped
over, I think, up to three feet.
I think it was like either two foot six
or something, but I think
he's done pretty good,
so he would be really fun,
eventually, to do that.
But first, I gotta get an
actual lesson in English.
I'll show you guys a little bit
of my English riding,
but have not even had
a single lesson in it.
I'm gonna start, hopefully, next week
if he's feeling better.
But I've just gotten tips and tricks
and kinda people saying what to do
and of course reading up on it.
I haven't done any lessons on it,
so I'll show you guys what I can do
in English style.
You guys can critique me
and tell me everything
I'm doing wrong.
Let's give it a try.
(piano music)
Good trotting.
We are still working on it,
still practicing, huh?
All right, bye Nacho!
See ya later!
Goodbye. (laughs)
Oh, hello, ladies.
How are you doin'?
As you can see, Pam has integrated
back into the group pretty dang well.
If you guys don't know, a few vlogs back,
she had a little owie on her head
and we just treated it
and it's actually looking
very good, very healed.
It hasn't gotten infected, so,
we are good to go.
Hoping to just maybe get some hair back
on her poor little head.
Chickens are pretty happy, huh?
You guys wanna come out for a little bit?
Come out and get some fresh air,
fresh grain, fresh grass while you can.
We just gotta watch them around Luna,
'cause Luna can be a little crazy.
Come on, girls.
(gentle music)
- What up, you guys?
Today I wanted to introduce you
to a friend of mine.
This is actually Dallas.
He's a good buddy of mine.
Sometimes we work together.
And today we're going
on a little man date,
so we're going to eat sushi for lunch.
- Man date!
-  Man date in his new ride!
Check this out, you guys.
So what is it, Dallas?
- It's a 1964 convertible Pontiac Tempest.
-  And it's beautiful.
- Gorgeous.
- And we just YouTubed
how to take the top down,
because we had no idea how
to figure it out, yeah.
- Because we're dumb kids.
-  Basically,
all right, so let's take
this top down.
Let's show the kids at
home how this works.
- Yes.
-  In the old days.
A button?
- Original leather interior.
- Look at this, this is so cool.
Yeah, all original.
This is really dope, so we're gonna hop
in the convertible and go get some sushi.
(exciting music)
Bro, you got some
hardware in here. (laughs)
- The old club, dude.
-  Can't have
anyone stealing your ride.
-  No.
-  The key is on the left?
- What is this, Britain?
-  Look at this, kids.
You gotta crank that window down.
You gotta work for it.
- By the end of this, our
forearms are gonna be huge.
- Basically.
Dang, dude, like buttah.
Let's do this.
This is literally an
airplane seatbelt, you guys.
Actually, the seatbelts on the airplane
might be safer, Dallas.
- No doubt they're safer.
That's what I love about this, though.
It says park.
-  Oh.
We haven't even left
the house and it's like,
this is so cool.
- It's so rad!
(exciting music)
-  On a scale of one to ten,
how happy are you right now?
- Eight point five.
-  Yeah, yeah.
- Only point five because
I'm scared it's gonna
die out on us again.
- We had a little bit of trouble.
-  Yeah.
- When we made the turn onto the road,
but we're good.
Now we're crusin' along.
This is seriously really cool.
I don't think I've ever
driven in a car like this.
This is rad, thanks dude.
- I've never driven a car like this.
-  This is yours!
This is your baby now!
-  It's my car now.
(gentle music)
-  Sweet ride, bro.
- I love it.
-  All right,
Missy got long hair today.
- Yeah, what do you think?
-  It's really beautiful.
- And it actually, look at this,
this is a high pony.
You can't see anything.
-  Yeah.
- Like a low pony, it's really good.
I'm gonna take it off and how fast it is
to put it back in.
Okay, so it's like a
little tiny fishing line.
Okay, ready?
-  Mm-hmm.
- I'm gonna get a haircut.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Wow.
- So this is what it looks like.
-  That is so funny.
- Yeah, and so you can see
this little fishing line.
It basically just
sits like this, but underneath my hair.
-  Yeah, yeah.
- Makes it all long and like the color,
which is perfectly.
-  That's awesome.
- I think I should just keep it like this,
'cause then I don't have to do anything.
(Bryan laughs)
-  That's awesome,
babe, I'm happy for you.
That's cool.
Alexa, good night.
-  Nighty-night.
Get some good rest.
(screams)
(laughs)
- Oh, hi, Finn.
Oh, hi, Ollie and Finn.
Hey, did you guys have fun today?
- Yeah.
- Finn, I am so proud of how well you did
at the hospital today.
- 'kay.
- You were such a good boy.
You did everything they needed to, huh?
- Yeah.
- But anyway, I think that
is all for today's video.
If you guys enjoyed it, be sure to give it
a big thumbs-up.
Thumbs-up, thumbs-up!
Thanks for watching, we'll see ya mañana.
Oh, Ollie, do you wanna
ask 'em a question?
- Yeah.
- To leave in the comments below?
Okay, what question do you wanna ask them?
- What did you eat for dinner tonight?
- That's what you wanna ask 'em?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let us know what
you guys ate for dinner
down below in the comments
and anyone who needs dinner
ideas will have a plethora.
So anyway, yeah, thanks
for watching, guys,
we'll see you mañana!
Who wants to do bye boop?
- Bye!
Kook.

It's bye boop, silly.
Bye, boop.
