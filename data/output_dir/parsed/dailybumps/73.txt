- How do you look for Fred?
- Good morning!
These boys are looking for Fred.
Like always.
- Oh Fred.
-  Where is he?
-  I don't know.
-  Is he in there?
- No.
- Not in the bathroom?
Alright, let's keep looking.
Good morning you guys.
It's a beautiful day.
Boys are looking for
their elf on the shelf.
He's up to no good.
- Fred's not in here.
-  Nope, not in here.
- I think he's in my room.
- Okay, go check your room.
I seriously just love
when they work together
and play together.
It's so cute.
And they use their imagination together.
He's not in here?
- Fred!
- Oh, you found him?
- Yeah.
-  What's he doing?
- He's on the Christmas
tree and have notes.
-  There he is.
Oh Ollie, he has your guys' letters
that you wrote last night.
But look it, they're
like miniature versions.
-  Don't touch him.
-  I didn't touch
him, I touched your ornament.
Look.
This is what your Christmas letter wrote.
And Santa wrote something on the back.
You know how you wrote
Santa a letter yesterday?
- Yeah.
-  Well Santa
replied and turned it into
like a little ornament.
Do you want me to read it to you?
- Yeah.
-  It says Ollie, I am well
and chocolate chip is my favorite.
Merry Christmas, Santa.
Whoa that is so cool, huh?
(Finn babbles)
Your is up there too buddy.
And here is Finn's letter.
And look it's all shrunk and cute.
And Santa wrote on yours too Fin.
He said Finn, ho ho ho.
Keep being a good boy.
Merry Christmas, Santa.
That's so cool dudes.
So now we get to keep
these letters forever, huh?
(bright music)
You know what I just realized Ollie.
- What?
- We haven't caught anything
in our Christmas cage in a long time, huh?
- Yeah.
- I wonder Ollie, if we
should set some bait?
- Yeah.
- Do you know
what bait is?
- What?
- So bait is when
you put something underneath it
and then it will attract something
and then we can catch it.
- And then the animals will eat the bait.
-  Yep, alright
Ollie, what do you think
we should put under the
Christmas cage as bait?
- Basghetti and candy!
-  Spaghetti and candy?
- Yeah.
- That'd be so weird.
What are you trying to catch?
Alright, let's go make some bait.
Hey Finn, you wanna make
some Christmas bait with us?
-  Yeah.
- Alright, let's go.
(bright music)
Alright boys, we have our base ingredient,
which is what you requested
Ollie, spaghetti, right?
We're gonna add a little
bit of maple syrup to it?
I'm not sure what we're
gonna catch you guys,
but all I know is
spaghetti and maple syrup,
uh yeah, that sounds amazing.
So I was also thinking, Ollie,
why don't we just throw in
a couple of other things.
So I have some candy there.
I have got some chocolate chips,
some more candy, candy canes, I figured.
So why don't you just take
a little and sprinkle it on?
There you go.
'Cause we're trying to
catch something fun, right?
We wanna catch something
that is really happy and fun
and likes to joke around.
So we're gonna make the bait reflect them.
- Make it once!
- Whoo.
- Oh!
Alrighty Finny, put
some chocolate chips on.
We want our new friend
to like chocolate, right?
Which is why we also have M&Ms.
By the way, these are the
holiday peanut butter ones.
Which I love.
-  Does this
look good to you Ollie?
Would you eat this?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Um.
(bright music)
- Finn's just eating the chocolate chips.
(Missy and Bryan laughing)
-  Are those good?
- Yeah.
- Okay, we almost have
our Christmas bait ready.
I'm just gonna put a couple of candy,
Christmas canes in here.
Because I want our new
friend to really enjoy
the spirit of Christmas.
So now what we're gonna do
is we're gonna place this
underneath the Christmas
cage and hopefully
catch something fun, right guys?
Okay, let's go put it under.
- Yep.
- Alright, we have our bait.
And then we also have our maple syrup.
I figure, you know why not
just include this also?
So you boys stay right here, okay?
-  Okay.
- Daddy's gonna walk
under the Christmas cage,
which looks so festive and fun.
Okay, so this is it.
I'm just gonna set the bait.
- That's the drink.
- Yeah, oh that'll be the drink
and that'll be the food?
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.
So now that we have that all set up
underneath the Christmas cage,
all we have to do is wait.
That's fun, right?
- Yep.
- Okay.
(upbeat music)
- Go Finn, go.
Go Finn, go!
Are you riding?
(laughs)
Ollie's riding his bike.
The boys are being so cute today.
Finn usually rides his little red bike,
but I thought I'd get out the stride one.
He's like I don't get it.
It's really hard to do.
I'm sure he's like I can't even go fast.
Ollie's doing great on his.
It is a beautiful day though today.
Definitely not cold at all.
And that's just how it is
in December in California.
Actually it feels really nice.
But I will say we had a
lot of threats and worries
about fires yesterday.
And it seems like everything
has basically cleared up.
Which I know there's a lot
of fires still in California,
and it is really sad and devastating.
But as far as the ones that
have been threats near our home,
not near us I guess specifically,
but near friends of ours
in the area, that fire seems
to be basically contained.
And then there's another
one about 30 minutes away.
And I think that one is almost one too.
It was just so devastating though,
watching a lot of that
footage on Twitter last night.
And the winds had been crazy.
But today, no wind, totally calm.
So hopefully that'll mean good things
for the fire season right now.
But wow, look guys, it's fall here
because there are leaves
all over our pool. (laughs)
The leaves are finally starting to fall.
Look, that tree is all bare.
Look, all the leaves are gone.
How crazy is that?
It's turning into fall here.
Little late, but that's okay.
(playfully pensive music)
(doorbell rings)
- Oh, that's fun.
Santa!
Santa?
Oh, that's wrong.
There we go.
Fred, how's it going?
We miss ya at the North Pole.
Hear you're doing a great job.
Ooo, no narwhals?
Oh my goodness, it's so festive.
- Uh Buddy, what are we doing here?
- I smell maple syrup.
- (gasps) The Christmas cage.
- Boys, boys did you hear it?
Did you hear the jingle bells?
- Yeah.
- I think we caught something
in the Christmas cage.
- Oh yeah.
- Let's go check.
It's the great Christmas capture time!
What is it?
Go look, go look.
- I'm so sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.
- He didn't mean anything,
he didn't mean anything.
-  Buddy, the elf!
What are you doing here?
-  I'm here to
make Christmas cookies.
-  Do you guys wanna
make Christmas cookies
with Buddy the elf?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Sorry for catching you Buddy.
- Oh that's no problem.
I love making Christmas cookies.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Should we set him free Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
We got Buddy the elf in the house!
He got caught in our Christmas cage.
And Jovie, so what did you bring?
- We have the Christmas
cookie kits, you guys.
We're gonna make gingerbread men.
-  Ooo, you guys wanna design
and decorate giant gingerbread?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yay, okay.
Let's get Buddy the elf
outta the Christmas cage.
Oh lift up.
- Oh, you're strong.
(Bryan laughing)
-  Alright, I'll lift it up.
- Set Buddy free!
- Alright, we're setting Buddy free.
There we go.
-  Yay.
- Thanks Ollie.
-  You're welcome.
-  Finn's got himself
a giant gingerbread man.
- Yeah.
- And he is doing
some decorating with Jovie.
- Do you like to decorate Finn?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's get started.
-  Whoa, look at those.
Aren't those huge?
- Yeah.
-  They're so cool.
- They're ginormous.
-  (laughs) They are
ginormous, aren't they Buddy.
You kneeding your frosting there.
- You have to kneed the frosting.
-  Or kneed or ned?
- Ned.
You ned it.
I'm just con headed nimmy muggin.
- Hey babe, did you ever think
that you'd be making Christmas cookies
with Buddy the elf
- No, I did not.
- I know, we've watched your movie
so many times this year already.
- Yeah.
- Oh me too.
(Bryan laughing)
(bright music)
-  Okay, Buddy
the elf, can I just say
those rosy cheeks are on point!
- Thank you.
- Look at how cute those are.
- Isn't that festive?
(bright music)
-  Alright Finn, show
us your final gingerbread man.
Can you pick it up and show us?
- Whoa, that's so good.
Good job dude.
Say thank you Jovie.
- Thank you Jovie.
(Bryan and Jovie laughing)
-  Alright Ollie, let's see yours.
It is looking so good.
I love the hair and the
gloves and the shoes.
Lots of red, 'cause that's
your favorite color, huh?
Oh you really wanna eat it?
Alright, take a bite.
(laughing)
-  That was a leg.
-  Alright Buddy,
show us your gingerbread man.
- Here's mine.
-  It's perfect.
- I'm a little disappointed.
Papa Elf can do way better.
-  Buddy, come on.
That's beautiful.
Didn't he do a good job?
Yeah?
- Oh Ollie, do you know what
this gingerbread man needs
before we eat it?
- Yeah.
- Maple syrup.
I love maple syrup.
-  (laughs) He's
like, this guy's crazy.
-  Um.
-  That is weird.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Do you want some
maple syrup for yours Ollie?
No?
- I've got plenty.
-  No!
- Okay.
- I just eat 'em plain.
- Ooo good mouth.
(bright music)
-  Alright guys,
it's time to say goodbye
to Buddy and Jovie.
Oh, you wanna show 'em out?
Alright, let's go.
-  Okay, let's go.
(Bryan laughing)
- Buddy, Buddy, Buddy.
-  Thanks for coming by Buddy.
- Thanks for having us.
- Jovie, merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye.
- Have a good one.
- Bye.
-  Bye guys.
- Remember the perfect way
to spread Christmas cheer
is singing loud for all to hear.
-  Did Buddy the elf
just come hang out with us Ollie?
(laughing)
- Yeah.
- Oh well would you
look at this little elf.
Hi baby June.
- Say hi.
Hi.
- What's up?
Where's Mom and Dad?
Are they on their way?
They're gonna hang out with us?
- I've been babysitting.
- Yeah.
That was so fun, wasn't it Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Buddy the elf actually came over
and the boys decorated
Christmas cookies with him.
That is so cool.
But honestly, I think they
really enjoyed themselves.
Oh are you teaching her how to dance Finn?
Dance, dance.
(Bryan laughing)
-  Kuku dance.
(Bryan laughing)
-  Aw, her legs
are getting so strong,
aren't they June?
Let's rock.
- We're rocking,
we're rocking, we're rocking, wee!
Alright, 'tis that time again.
I've already showered and cleaned up
and this kid passed out on the couch.
He asked if he could watch Harry Potter
and cuddle with Daddy.
And so while I took a
shower that's what he did
and he fell asleep.
So cute.
And Finn was actually like
so tired by like 5:30.
So I was like let's just hurry up and eat
and you can go to bed.
And he went right to bed after that.
But we had such a fun day
playing with Buddy and Jovie.
It was just a really fun day.
So anyways, make sure you give this video
a big thumbs up.
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
Boop.
