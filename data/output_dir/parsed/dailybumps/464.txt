hey Olli guess what you and Finn were
such good boys while mama and I were
away and so we have a very special
present for you are you excited to see
it
Mama's bringing a surprise wherever you
are that's whatever wannabe all
big
I am alone
with me
good morning we got up this morning and
we are all dressed for a day and we have
yet to see if the chickens gave said
more eggs should we go look yes I'm
super excited he's really excited aren't
you
check out gussy let's go check out the
chickens that's trying to get my hopes
up because that was their first egg and
if it came from Susan she's known for
not making a lot of eggs
so we'll see I'm really excited to find
out good I'm so glad Papa made this
little like thing for us alright
nope none in there those are the fake
ones
oh all right here we go
nothing just poop no eggs let's go check
and make sure she didn't just drop it
while she was walking around I don't
really know exactly how that work do
they know to go into their little spot
and lay the egg or debt first they just
like awesome pop an egg out so we're
gonna see see if maybe they popped it
out on in here oh my gosh oh baby music
they did I can see an egg okay come on
in baby
I'm Kiki but you can see it huh go get
it oh my gosh
another egg let me see it
Wow it's definitely a little one okay
it's definitely on that little eggle
yeah scared there for a second
definitely have a little egg so I'm
wonder if it came from Susan but brie is
known for giving us the most eggs so I
don't know but it's so cute we don't
know it's gonna show daddy be careful
don't drop it
Kate go Sean
showing God what is that
another little egg yeah who do you think
ate it Ali Oh Susan Layton I think it's
Susan Wow I checked the cameras this
morning and she was laying in that spot
where we found the egg so I think it's
Susan and it's small like it would be
Susan's
and neither of us have had breakfast so
I think we're gonna share a couple eggs
miss wedding oh that's so cool she made
an egg huh he's so excited in that you
hear a chicken yeah oh did you hear that
yeah it's like no there's no chicken in
there it's just an egg yeah just an egg
you want to go eat it yeah a lot of
people would ask first let's go cook it
I'll show you what it looks like let's
go cook it cake a lot of people in
asking actually how we know if it's not
a chicken or not because basically we do
have a rooster with you that if they
decided to become broody and they wanted
to sit on their eggs the eggs would
possibly eventually turn into chicken
but because we go and pick them up every
morning they will not turn into a
chicken we will just eat them so yes you
can eat fertilized eggs you pull wheat
fertilized eggs every single day because
they grab them before they actually fit
on it and turn them into a chicken so
that's my understand into a baby
eventually maybe if that's like one but
it's not because we picked it up and we
are gonna cook it down so it was Susan's
huh all right you wanna make some eggs
yeah let's get cooking all right ready
okay I'm so nervous I'm gonna mess and
I'm so nervous that chickens gonna pop
out of him so nervous gonna look
absolutely disgusting
I don't know if I've ever cook an egg
this tiny you ready this is the first
one I think so
the shells are really brittle actually
it's really strong oh that looks like a
normal lady yeah look at that beautiful
egg chaos the Deseret all but actually
it's really strong a way stronger than
I've cracked that those are two
normal-looking eggs that's awesome Susan
make it an egg I thought for sure burry
would have been first I know she's like
our egg maker and Susan's making us eggs
that's awesome I mean this is actually a
really strong shower
