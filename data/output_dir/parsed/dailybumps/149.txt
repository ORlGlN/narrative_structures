What are you doing hanging out here
in laundry hamper?
- I was hiding whatnot in my room.

Today is gonna be a fun day,
oh you're putting it on me now?
Well that's gonna make my head look weird.
Weird for sure.
Guess what, Ollie?
- What?
- It is a beautiful day outside.
There's so many cool things for us to do,
and we're gonna have so much fun, okay?
- Oh, I love you.
- Oh, I love you too.
So today is a very special day
because we have some
friends from out the town,
did you know that?
Yup, and they film some pretty cool stuff
here on YouTube,
and they're gonna film some epic stuff
for our channel.
You're gonna get to meet them.
Does that sound fun?
Yeah?
And look what Ollie can do now.
(laughter)
He can cross his fingers.
That's pretty good, dude.
This is how Ollie greets our new friends.
Everyone say hey,
we got Legendary Shots in the house.
Whole crew!
- What, you got two of them?
-  Yeah, I do.
- I feel like Iron Man or something.
(Bryan laughs)
- I wonder if they can feel
the bold spots on your leg
from where we waxed them yesterday.
-  I know right. (laughter)
- It's pretty pronounced.
- Legendary Shots does some crazy things
here on YouTube.
I'm gonna have their
channel linked in the iCard.
You should go check it out
'cause we're gonna be
filming a ton of fun stuff
today, right?
- It's gonna be awesome.
- Here's the beast.
-  I know that is so cool, dude.
Hey, should we go experiment
with some chickens? - Yes.
-  See what they do
when we throw them in the air?
(chatter)
Yeah, they were like freaking out.
'Cause they were like,
"We've never done slow mo of a chicken!"
- We haven't, it's weird.
- This may be your only chance.
(exciting music)
How many frames is this, you guys?
- This is 5765.
-  Oh my Gosh!
- You still clear 720 ps.
-  Oh my Gosh, babe.
That's nuts.
What do you think about
seeing your chickens
fly like that?
- They actually look very like majestic,
and very cool.
-  The people get to see, like,
how beautiful they actually are.
- Yeah, like, I had no
idea how they, like, use,
I don't think they know how to use them.
They're like (clucking sound).
(laughter)
-  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
- They cover their entire body
with the entire, like, wings.
- Actually, they have a
pretty broad, like, wing span.
-  It's so cool.
- Their feathers all flare out,
it look pretty cool.
- Alright, the family is here right now.
Actually, I think auntie
is coming over soon.
Uncle should be,

old family get together.
We're having a lot of fun.
Just making videos and
doing some fun stuff.
And my mom and dad are here to help,
and it's gonna be a fun day.
(exciting music)
- Alright, boys, what to
you think of these pumpkins
mama picked up yesterday?
- Good!
-  They're huge, huh?
Well don't go hugging them yet
because we are going
to destroy them today.
- Should we smash them?
(hums approvingly)
-  They're like
getting really attached
to the pumpkins now.
Yeah guys (laughs).
As you guys know, Halloween
is fast approaching,
and we love celebrating early,
so Missy picked up some pumpkins,
and we are going to
smash them in slow motion
with the help of Legendary Shots,
so that you guys can see
what exactly this looks like.
Don't go do this on Halloween, you guys.
Don't go to people's
doors and smash pumpkins.
Did you ever do that?
- They're not gonna like
that. No, I'm not a hooligan.
-  Yeah, we don't do that.
We're good kids.
Just get your own pumpkins
and smash them yourself
at your house (laughs).
- And have at least have
6000 frames per second.
-  6000 frames per second.
- Then put it on YouTube.
- Let's do this!
(exciting music)
- Check out this sledgehammer, you guys.
I am so excited to be
smashing some pumpkins today.
And the boys got the
best seat in the house.
-  They're all ready.
- You're ready to see what happens?
-  Yeah!
- I wanna see if I can make a mess.
-  Yeah!
Say, "Yeah"!
- Yeah!
(exciting music)
- I hope it won't get on us.
-  It won't.
-  Here we go.
(exciting music)
- Look at that hole!
(exciting music)
(screams excitedly)
- 
Wasn't that so cool, dude?
- Yeah, I wanted to see.
-  Seeds are everywhere.
-  Check out the
remnants of the pumpkin, dude.
-  He smashed that
thing to pieces, huh?
- Here's the top.
We have the top right there.
We got some seeds and
goopy stuff coming out.
Isn't that gross?
(Missy screams in disgust)
(exciting music)
-  Nice!
-  Houdini split!
(Bryan screams excitedly)
-  You did it!
There it is! (laughs)
- 
Like, split it in half!
-  Yeah, that looks awesome.
-  What do you think?
- Halloween don't come
around here no more!
(exciting music)
- [Legendary Shots Guy
1] That was awesome!
- [Legendary Shots Guy
2] That was so cool!
- It exploded!
- [Legendary Shots Guy
1] Are you okay, dude?
-  You got seeds all over you.
(laughter)
Look at this.
-  Pumpkin, aw.
You kept her face though.
- This is okay.
- 
Yeah, she's got a face.
- Make up still dead (laughs).
- Eyebrows on fleek, eyebrows on fleek!
(exciting music)
- This is seriously so much fun.
We are now breaking out the tractor.
Just gonna break some stuff.
- This is what guys live of.
-  I know, dude.
This is so cool.
(tractor noise)
-  Oh, that's muddy.
-  Muddy!
Whatever goes under there is
getting demolished, you guys.
(exciting music)
We're doing some soda cans.
Shaking them up first,
see if we can get some cool explosions.
Is that your camera
running hot? Is that a fan?
- Yeah, I mean it's got like a massive fan
just sitting here.
- Dude that's working hard.
How cool is this, Jim (laughs)?
He's loving this.
Smash those babies!
It's gonna get all over us
oh my God back off, back off.
Back off, dude.
(exciting music)
Oh (laughs)!
- Look at this, I got soaked.
-  Dude!
- Oh my God.
-  Hey, at least
there's no sugar in there.
- Yeah, at least it's just like.
-  I know (laughs).
That was so cool.
Ten years ago did you
think you'd be sitting here
on a tractor?
- That I would be smashing cans.
-  And pumpkins (laughs).
This is so cool.
I'm glad we have a tractor,
we can do cool stuff like this (laughs).
This is how you have fun
with the tractor, you guys.
Oh, smells!
(exciting music)
Hey, Fin!
Did you hear that chainsaw?
- Yeah.
- It's loud, huh (laughs)?
What should we do with it?
- Say, "Smash them"!
- Halloween he said.
-  Halloween!
That's like his favorite word
right now, it's Halloween.
So we have broken out the chainsaw,
and now we are going to
destroy a watermelon.
How is this gonna work, you guys?
-  We're
gonna full rev that thing,
and drop a watermelon on it.
-  I'm gonna get covered
in watermelon, you guys!
I'm telling you!
Should I put up a shield or something?
This is gonna be funny.
- Alright, so for the next idea,
they have a chainsaw and a watermelon.
Now the boys think that they
if they put it up full blast
and drop the watermelon on to the blade,
it'll just slice it right at half,
kinda like Fruit Ninja.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
We're gonna find out right now.
(exciting music)
(screams) It worked!
- That was actually awesome!
We did it!
(chatter)
-  You were like
a real life Fruit Ninja.
- Fruit Ninja in real life!
- I really wanna eat it
but it's covered in dirt.
-  Let's just
rinse it up and eat it.
- That's how queen cut
the .
-  Yeah, yeah (laughs)!
I know, I did not think that would happen!
Alright, we're going for it again.
(chainsaw buzzing)
(exciting music)
Oh my God.
-  They got 'em!
They got 'em all, look at that!
- So, the boys are still having a blast
cutting things up, exploding things.
It's been pretty cool to watch.
Fin's actually napping and Ollie went off
to hang out with Mimi,
so I decided I'm gonna head
over to Kelsey and Corbin's
and help them unpack.
I was kinda planning
on doing this anyways,
and the boys were just on a roll
doing all kinds of stuff,
and I was like,
alright I'm heading out
since Fin's taking a nap.
So I'm really excited to go see
how much progress they've made,
all the stuff in their house.
I'm excited to help them,
like, set it all up, yay!
Alright, I'm at Kelsey and Corbin's.
Look! They have a living room!
- Look at that stuff!
-  (laughs) And
boxes and, like, things,
like, you guys don't have nothing.
You have things (laughs).
June's just happy she's got her little,
her little gym (laughs).
She looks so happy (laughs).
We are unpacking.
I've actually just seen June's room,
it looks so cute.
I'm not gonna show it though,
'cause you guys will have
to go to check it out
on their channel.
But now we're gonna work on the kitchen,
and I gotta say they
have a lot of cabinets,
so this should be fun (laughs).
- I know right.
Why don't we put everything?
-  I know!
Yeah, and they get their
dining room table today,
so it's like we're soon
gonna be able to do, like,
family dinners here.
- And we'll actually cook for you guys.
- Yeah! We can put the kids to bed
'cause they'll have like a little room.
It's gonna be so fun!
Alright, we gotta get to work!
You actually have a lot of kitchen things.
- I know, this is still a kitchen.
(laughter)
-  Like, for the small kitchen,
that you guys did have,
you might just fill
everything in here (laughs).
-  I know.
Love you!
- Kiss me back.
-  Saying bye byes.
(laughs)
The boys have been hanging
out here and playing,
and then I came, and me and
Cassie did a few workouts.
Good workout, Cass!
And, as you guys can see,
I achieved my workout goal.
I just haven't finished my move goal.
I definitely need to workout now.
But I'm getting better
at trying to figure out
how to make this thing work.
-  Hey Fin, why are you
walking like that (laughs)?
I think that means something (laughs).
- Let's see!
-  He's so funny.
- I think that it's just pee.
-  That's funny,
he's just being silly.
- Maybe he is .
-  Yeah.
What are you gonna do?
Is that how you walk now?
Oh my Gosh, look at them.
Fin's like copying him (laughs).
Missy and the boys just got back come,
and they're so cute.
Why are you boys so cute?
Every day they just
surprise me with, like,
something new they say or act or.
Ollie can you walk like Fin?
With your legs open like that?
Like you got a poo poo in your diaper?
(laughs) Poo poo diaper
walk, poo poo diaper walk!
(laughs)
Alright, Ollie is gonna vlog me doing
the poopy diaper walk, you ready?
Stay right there, watch!
Poopy diaper walk! Poopy diaper walk!
(Fin screams excitedly)
(laughter)
Ollie, you're a good vlogger!
Now you're showing them Carmen,
ain't that cool?
-  Carmen!
-  We get to start
that on October first,
huh Ollie?
-  Then it's gonna be Halloween!
And we get to eat the candy!
- Anyway, that's all for today's video,
but we had so much fun colabbing with
Legendary Shots today.

their YouTube page,

cute awesome fun photos

classify them as cute,
but I post photos (laughs).
