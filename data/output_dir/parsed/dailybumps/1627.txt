what can we can work out I got you
sunglasses not really I saw my mom's
we're shipping Brian's iPhone five
because he sold it and he actually was
able to buy the iPhone 5s with like not
paying a dime basically I always end up
going just like equals he's always been
able to do this I was there when he
bought his first iPhone like we're in
high school and that was probably the
most expensive purchase he's ever made
and then he's always just sold them
right in time and then sometimes he has
to be without a phone which this time he
luckily didn't have to be and then he
always buys a new phone without without
like buying anything so I'm always like
I can't say no I'm not allowed to how
are you I can't say no if you figured
out a way to do it without paying any
money I'm going to attempt to use the
fingerprint scanning and see if it'll
let you in so try again try again
oh no entrance were you yeah that that's
gonna need to be changed no I I can add
your fingerprint oh good I'll put when
we do it you have to like scan your
finger in oh and you can do up to five
fingers
that's crazy see that's so weird but
that's good I thought it would be weird
that if like we can't open to others
phones and be like really weird okay so
I'm making a little phone call let's
prank Austin man hello Audrey you're so
dreamy

entire wall out of like makeshift thrift
store frames and then using Instagram
prints to fill them so I want to print
out a ton of Instagram permanece oh cool
babe and like every frame was different
had like personality sure if I want to
do that every single different thing
oh really well I think we could do it
there's a lot whoa look at that you guys
do you think we could wrap that in our
room that's so cool
frames were a bust so now Missy is
looking at shoes because she's obsessed
with shoes they normally don't ever look
that good no joke Missy's trying on
stilettos right now have you ever worn

is it hard are they company yeah it's
hard
are they uncomfortable just left the
store and Oliver had a dirty diaper so I
detained him in his car seat are
actually I changed him in the stroller
part of it and Brian put the put the
wipes on top of the little shade thing
and it just slid right off and fell
right on the Oliver's face he smacked
him right in the face I felt so bad but
I took him off and he's literally like
yeah he is known as I was freaking out
like oh my god you do that Massena are
looking at beds at Big Lots huh

in is pretty cool too
it's huge babe it's like way bigger for
you it's way too big for you we both
could sit in it it's like a monster
chair for real miss you look at this

weird but a so Christmas trees up right
now oh my goodness
holy crap you guys I just stepped
outside and it's like cold out here
that's weird come here on your birthday
it's like cold and muggy this is so
weird I don't think it's ever been like
this I know it's crazy
it says it's 72
where's the cold my new iPhone 5s has a
slow-mo feature and I want to test it
out because Missy is obviously really
really good at doing slow-mo i slow-mo
tascioni Missy yeah go
for karma you guys ready for this I'm
gonna throw his frisbee you ready Karma
good job boyo he's like what are you
doing he really wants to stand it I
don't know if he's really like allowed
to no he really just wants to put all
his weight on his legs though and stand
like a little baby toddler just it just
seems like he just wants to like get up
and go it's really cute so if you guys
haven't guessed yet I did get the space
it's called space gray iPhone I was kind
of really on the fence about the gold
one and they made my life really easy
and they said that they were all out of
gold essentially like our store got like
two gold by the time they got to me they
were also out of the white and so I was
like cool I'll have to make a decision
so I did get Space Gray first day using
it I am loving it so far I was gonna add
Missy's thumbprint so she can unlock it
too and it's just show you guys how it
works cuz it's so cool okay so place
your thumb on on it just like that
whoa and now lift it up is that really
nice and now place it back on oh yeah
every time you do it it learns more
about it and it adds much a little
thank-you doing it keep doing it take it
on and off it's learning your
fingerprint miss days so cream it's like
dark magic it make like vibrates a
little bit every time it does it to all
he's like I want to do it I want to do
it in that cool yeah it like knows your
fingerprint now fix it
okay now we're totally gonna add all
these fingerprints see if it works did
he do it this time
oh my god it's working good again rookie
wait
oops you clicked oh that this way if
Missy and I are unavailable our Oliver
can always unlock the phone with his toe
he is going to have an iPhone miss Lee
oh I know I seriously want our kid he's
kind of controversial subject I want him
to have a phone from the very start
Oh in the minute he has to leave the
house so from the minute he it has to
like leave the house on his own he's
gonna have a phone yes yeah it's kind of
like a touchy subject so yeah
to be able to contact us and even as a
really young age four or five years old
they can suit they neva work phones and
see they're at a babysitter I want them
to be able to call me if something is
wrong or if that babysitter is a bad
babysitter for whatever reason there's
too many dangerous people out there and
he needs to be able to contact at any
time yeah what do you guys think about
this let me know in the comments if you
have a kid what age did you let them
have a cell phone and if you don't have
kids what age do you think is
appropriate to have cell phones
you know iPhones are really good cuz you
can limit like a lot of different things
like web access and music and stuff like
that I'm interesting to see what like
the general consensus is about kids my
biggest thing is those phones have
tracking on them so I can track Oliver
wherever he is if that's with a
babysitter out at a restaurant I'll know
exactly worried about you can you guys
imagine him using a phone like if we
just like hello mommy daddy mommy the
baby said I seemed very mean she won't
see me I'm I just open a bunch of
packages and I instagrammed it so you
