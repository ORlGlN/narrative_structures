just start piling stuff into it because
if you don't know we're like in the
garage area and we have six people in
this house and nowhere to put anything
so that storage place right over here
just gets so full of just all of our
stuff I'm actually going to help clean
up some some of the house tubes it's
just kind of like getting not so great
when we have a mom that can't really do
a lot right now which by the way she is
she's okay I mean she's her pains really
bad right now but we're just trying to
get her to Monday so she can talk to her
surgeon and then we can decide what
