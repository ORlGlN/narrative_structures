what's this one oh my and visible after
their doctor what's this one I'm not try
Santa yeah like this is my dad wherever
you are that's what ever wanna be all
around that big blue top inside
his love
just wandering around you never know
here
Oh God coming on to you
with me
good morning morning morning pay morning
live so cool that you're over here
because you're not in school normally
when the Johnsons come over it's just
Payton because lives in school but it's
sort break yeah you're in first grade
now and you look kind of like a
hillbilly because all you're teaching us
is show me your teeth
wait what that one's all out that was
bleeding everywhere alone mom told ya it
was gonna hurt oh that's so cool
so anyways we are having a fun day the
kids are playing spin is done for a nap
and I'm actually getting ready to film
my video so hey we're doing they're so
cute you guys go play in Ali's room but
don't wake up Finn got it
good morning guys I need your honest
opinion what should I do with my office
I just don't know what to do it has
become the room where we put things when
we don't know where to put them anymore
so like I have so much old tech gear and
cameras I don't know I'm just not
feeling it and I want to be able to hang
out in here and like do things we
producted and like video games and stuff
and just don't know how to organize
everything I feel like I just have to
get rid of a ton of things I just have
so many like random batteries and cords
and I feel like I need someone who's
like good with tech stuff to come over
and just help me tell me what you guys
think of this idea I was thinking about
taking down my New York mural wasn't
there for like well over a year now but
what if I took this all down and I did a
Polaroid mural and any Polaroids we take
we just do sticky tack and we just fill
the entire wall with Polaroid but that'd
be cool or do you think that'd be stupid
I don't know I'm kind of at a loss right
now with my office just because I don't
ever hang out in here and want
here and play video games and work and
stuff I can't check out this bright
sunny day we're having though it's so
hot you guys I think that June gloom is
leaving it's becoming summer now so
we're definitely gonna have to get in
the pool oh also I don't know if we ever
showed you guys this but I'm sure this
will be in Missy's backyard tour cuz she
did a house tour but she didn't do any
of the yard so I'm sure she'll do like a
backyard tour but we have like some cool
little seating areas out here but a fire
and then we also have like a little
daybed out here which we literally just
bought pillows for we have some cool
pillows out here
on the daybed now but as you can see
it's right in the Sun so you kind of
have to wait for the Sun to go above the
house or you can actually hang out and
you pull me out it is hot we have to
jump in that pool
okay so we have been swimming in the
pool and tragedy has struck and I feel
so bad I what's wiggling around babe oh
oh I see it haha it's this very first
beast thing looks like it's alright I'm
sorry we're going full bot okay you got
you a stick so to get the beat let's see
the culprit where are you called Brett
please
that thing is free I don't know if I've
ever visited by a buck oh yeah I know
fun you don't fight but you don't really
feel it yeah like my Orangeburg is just
so bad I've been stung a couple of times
but I haven't been recently I don't
think
it was superb a bomb to kill it
sorry babe I have a yucky bug
yeah it's yucky bugs Holly mama so sad
can you give her a hug
she's so sad look at Mama's bee sting
Wow yes true true tragedy Petra oh my
god Abby this is are they coming right
for me that one wanted me yeah bee sting
suck you guys I feel so bad for Missy
she literally tells me all the time how
she's never been done before and I'm
like well you know it's coming right if
you've never been stung before it's
definitely coming oh so so bad I don't
think any of the boys have been stung
but we just know that that day is coming
especially since we spent a lot of time
outside where the bees like to come and
they'll like drink a little water
definitely something we have to be
watchful of which is definitely a bummer
all right guys we are done swimming the
kids are still having a blast so I
decided to make some food poolside so
that's what all this mess is from I
actually bought a panini press and I
made three babies and they look so good
that has mozzarella cheese basil pesto
chicken tomatoes all that yummy stuff so
we're going to eat out here you guys
have to be careful of bees okay they're
everywhere dr. Collins like I told you
though you see a bee you just go under
the water oh I thought you supposed to
splash it no oh I always flush it I hope
it's plastic I slide maybe that's why I
got angry and got you by the way look
what it's been doing it's getting worse
oh yeah it's literally swelling and it's
red
it hurts it hurts look I know I freaked
out a little bit but I think it was
completely valid yeah I do feel bad
about it like for you to get down yeah
oh it's so bad we call I get freaked out
yeah oh my god now you know hey you look
beautiful
thank you how's that I made paninis you
guys and I am so excited to assess it
looks so good I did the copycat one from
harberger oh my gosh is amazing that is
amazing that will cure your bee sting
them
probably not but it'll taste gonna get
broken can you eat it Ben is there
anything better than cold pizza after
swimming
I don't think so huh oh you got an
orange is like ice free look how he eats
oranges you guys eat them like an apple
so funny
you got some lunch how it's women wow
that's a pretty cool robot game Wow we
are actually doing something fun tonight
with the family I am packing and we're
going to be doing something actually put
a little bit more fun tomorrow this is a
little bit of a hint and we are super
excited I'm just getting the boys all
packed up I've got their pajamas and
their clothes and me and it is just for
one night so it's going to be really
easy patching so I ended up jumping in
the pool again today and what what
happens you guys I got hurt
it's like we're going to see godparents
like our matching wound that's all it
was so all right it looks it's like a
burn almost right yes what happened was
I was going on the slide and I kind of
like hopped and then my arm got stuck
forward and then it smashed into the
rocks as I was going down oh do you know
it was gonna be that bad no I definitely
hurt
it's definitely hurt yeah so that it
didn't start really hurting or showing
up like this for a while same arm
rocking I packed the thermometer so that
was pretty fun when we go with the boys
and I checked myself and I do not have a
fever which I knew but then I checked my
arm and it said I have a very bad fever
is that I have a 102 in a flash red and
it would be maybe they're gonna do but
great Oh hurt so bad
hey Olli what you want to see something
really gross okay I got are we on my arm
don't touch it don't touch it it hurts
and that's scary looking I got a little
scrape right there not sad why
definitely gonna be careful okay you
want to see on the camera you gotta show
it there all right so before we take off
for the night I don't show you a little
chicken I'm pretty excited because I let
all the ticks out and pan out the last
two days and they have been getting
along great
I'm so excited I know that I'm sure
there was a little bit of like scuff
just between like Pam and some of the
chickens or some of the chicks but to be
honest it's been great they have all
been just hanging out with each other
and scratching together and they are
just like so cute plus they're now just
like episodes where they can literally
not only run so fast they can basically
fly they will fly like through this coop
right now and they just seem a little
bit more sturdy like if they were to get
into a fight they would just run these
chickens wouldn't even be able to catch
up with them so I feel really good about
them I feel like they're pretty much old
enough now to just do with the other
chickens so we're going to be taking
this apart over the next like day and
they'll be
three into the coop because everyone
getting along thank you guys
where are all of them they still love
hiding in her and they're like literally
I think there might be two Oh for the
cooler one two three four five there's
another one I'm also pretty certain at
this point that I have two roosters at
least which is definitely a bummer I
think this one Moana is a boy which is
definitely a bummer I'm not sure about
these tubes they don't really know the
difference this early on and then one of
my Reds we have Ariel and honor there
two reds and they're both very different
one is definitely smaller ones bigger
one has like a big tail boost out and
the other one just had like a little
curved but so Chris dad if the Roosters
they tend to be mean so I'm have a
feeling that not all of them will be
able to keep but we'll see maybe I will
alright guys we'll see you guys tomorrow
be good nope nope nope you're good you
got lots of food you'll need to leave
