- We have a little
announcement for you boys,
and the people watching this.
Should we tell 'em?
♫ Wherever you are that's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ This is home
♫ Just running around
you've never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight
cuddling all I could saying
♫ I am home
♫ Home's wherever you're with me
-  Good morning.
- What is today?
- School.
- Today is school, but it's not just
a regular day at school.
What kind of day is it?
- It's share day.
- It is share day.
And, it's grandparents day.
Which means, who's coming
with you to school Ollie?
- Mimi and popa's gonna stay with me!
(cheering)
- So I am taking him to school.
But then mimi and popa are gonna come
and they get to experience
school with him.
Which I'm actually really jealous.
I'm like, why isn't there a parents day,
where we can go and do
crafts with him and stuff.
They seriously don't have one.
Today is share day though.
And we never picked out a toy yesterday.
Alright Ollie, so what
is your letter today
for share day?
- H.
- H.
And what does an H sound like?
(exhaling)
Good job!
- A horse.
-  Yes like a horse!
So we have to find
something in your playroom
that starts with the letter H.
Just like this little bag says.
And it has to sound like. (exhaling)
Let's see what we can find, kay?
What's that ones name?
- Dozer.
-  Dozer.
Okay.
Well Dozer starts with a D.
So that's a da, da, dozer, huh.
We've been lookin' through his toys.
Honestly it is so hard to find
these letters because everything just.
I don't know, you're
like nope, that's not it.
And like the other day
I was looking for an A,
and I was like, uh, a car?
(laughing)
A gun.
I think we found the
perfect toy though huh?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, show 'em what it is.
- It's a hamster.
-  It's a hamster!
- Can you say Ollie?
(hamster talking)
-  Oh my goodness.
- Say you are beautiful mama.
(hamster talking)
(laughing)
- I'm sure his teacher
will love that thing.
- No I'm Ollie.
-  I am Ollie.
- No I am Ollie.
- Alright, we are on the way to school.
But today is a little bit different.
Normally I always make Ollie breakfast.
And I've realized, that he
never ever eats his breakfast.
And I've been trying to figure out why.
I've been changing his different foods.
I'm like maybe it's this.
Because he usually loves breakfast.
And I realized that he just
doesn't like eating breakfast
in the morning.
It makes him sick.
Like he goes, ugh I just feel sick.
I can't eat it.
And I was like, okay that makes sense.
A lot of people can't eat
breakfast in the morning.
So I thought instead of
wasting our time in the morning
trying to get him to eat his breakfast,
we'll just go to Starbucks.
And I was like, all for that plan.
So I've got Starbucks, he's got Starbucks.
And I got him a little pumpkin bread.
And this is very nice.
But one other thing that
I think is pretty funny
is that today, Ollie is going to school
and he's got his really cute clothes on.
But let me see your feet.
Where are your shoes?
We don't know where your shoes are, huh?
- They are stinky.
- So I really like to put him socks
and tennis shoes for school.
But I can't find his
tennis shoes anywhere.
And I'm pretty sure
that since the Johnson's
picked him up the other day from school,
that he must have left them in their car.
So I'm going to take him
to school with no shoes,
hoping that they show up
and that I can get his shoes from them.
But worst case scenario,
I can always just put on some sandals
that I have in the backseat.
Alright let's head to school okay?
Gotta get a picture of him.
We do this every time
we drop you off, huh?
- Cheese!
- And look what he's wearing, sandals.
What happened to your tennis shoes?
We lost 'em.
Jeffrey just texted me
and he's like, nope, I don't
see his tennis shoes anywhere.
So I don't know where they are.
So he has to wear his sandals today but,
that's okay huh?
(cheerful music)
Good morning Finney!
Aw, he's kind of in a bad mood.
I just got home and actually
went out with Kelsey
and we got a pedicure.
Which was super fun but now I'm back.
And this one's actually ready for his nap.
And look it, who's here Fin?
- Mimi.
- No.
Who's here?
- Ga-ga.
- Ti-ti.
He says, Ti-ti.
Auntie's here.
- He does it, I swear.
- Yeah he says auntie's here,
and look what we're filming.
Yep, I'm gonna be in one
of her videos this week.
And we're super excited
'cause it is a pancake, art challenge.
We just made all that pancake mix.
- We all know who's gonna win this.
- Me.
- Who's gonna be
better at art stuff?
- Me.
(laughing)
So we've got all those colors.
This guy's going down
for a nap just in time,
'cause now we're gonna film.
So that sounds good huh Fin?
- Kay.
- Kay.
I just put Fin down and got ready to film
and look who's home!
Did you have fun at grandparents day?
- Yeah!
And Mimi and Popa bringed
Mimi in Popas car.
-  Oh and they picked you up?
- Yeah.
-  So how did you
like having Mimi and Popa
at school today?
- Good.
-  Good.
Did you show 'em everything?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah was it so cool?
He's just so excited that auntie's here.
He's like, why didn't you come?
They don't have an auntie day.
- Is there not an auntie and uncle day?
-  There's not
an auntie and uncle day
and there's not a parents day.
Which I think is really messed up too.
And look what you did here!
(laughing)
Alright so this his family, right?
-  There's flowers on it.
-  CJ and Berry.
(laughing)
-  So you have mommy and daddy,
and Oliver and Fin.
And CJ and Berry.
Who's Berry?
(laughing)
-  Did you mean Bailey?
(laughing)
-  Look there's flowers!
-  I love that.
Thank you Jesus for my family.
- There's flowers!
- So cool!
- Flowers.
-  Alright mom, how did it go?
- Okay, so it was really cute.
When we got there they started out with
doing the pledge of allegiances.
They did their share.
So they all brought their H share bags.
-  He shared his hamster?
- And every kid was so excited.
And then I even had all the grandparents
asking me where we bought it.
'Cause they want to buy one too.
-  Aw.
He's sharing your gift
on grandparents day.
- I was like, it's just on Amazon.
I'm not even sure what it's called.
I think it's a repeating hamster.
And then we all got to play together.
And we did some, like,
colored, and had fun.
And the last one, it was so funny.
We're like playing food games.
With pretend food.
And we're all pretending to
make hamburgers and sandwiches.
And then all of a sudden
there was a little bell,
like a ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
And I didn't know what it was.
And all of a sudden Ollie
goes, time to clean up.
He starts scooping things up,
putting it all back in the cupboard.
I'm like, what are you doing?
He's like, it's time to clean up.
And he's just making sure
everything is put away,
and closes it.
I'm like, okay that's pretty cool.
-  I'm gonna need a bell.
- We're gonna need that bell at our home.
Not a word was said, just a bell.
And man that table was spotless.
- That's so crazy.
How cute is that.
So you know what the bell means Ollie?
- What does the bell mean?
- Clean up.
- Time to clean up.
- I ordered one on Amazon.
(laughing)
-  We all need one.
- Be like, ding, ding, ding, ding.
That is so cute though.
I'm so excited that my
mom and dad got to go.
And I'm seriously bummed that
they don't have a parents day.
- Yeah how come?
We made him.
How come we don't get to do that?
- I should be allowed to see what they do.
- Nice new robe dada.
-  Thanks dude, I
just put it in, you like?
- Yeah.
- So Ollie was sent home from school
with a little report.
Out report.
Oliver and a classmate
bumped into each other,
he hit his nose.
What we did.
Iced and TLC'd.
Do you know what TLC is?
- What?
- It means, tender loving care.
Lots of kisses.
What happened at school?
- I broke my nose.
- You broke your nose?
- Yeah.
- Is it okay?
- Yeah.
- Aw.
So apparently he bumped
into one of his classmates
and hurt his nose really bad.
Did you have to put ice on it?
Does it look okay?
- But there's no ice.
- No ice, no one cared.
Wanna show 'em your nose?
Look at that cute little nose.
- Right there.
- Aw.
- But I am actually fine.
- You're fine?
- Yeah.
- You're good?
- Yeah.
- High five.
So you don't need to go to the doctor?
No, you're just gonna be
careful in the classroom
so you don't bump into people?
Okay.
Alright we have been running errands
and we actually just did a little bit
of furniture shopping
with Kelsey and Corbin.
Because they're still
gettin' everything set up.
It's so interesting though,
because I feel like they're just a couple
of years behind us.
- Yeah.
- What we were doing you know.
Renting their first house,
filling it with furniture,
eventually they'll buy
a house and all that.
It's just really cool to like,
be able to have them out here
and do all that stuff with 'em.
- Yeah it's so cool.
- Yeah.
Now we are headed to dinner.
We are seriously so hungry.
Missy did we eat lunch?
- Nope.
I never eat lunch.
- I don't think I ate lunch today.
I forgot to eat lunch.
Look at little June!
-  Watch your
food, she will grab it.
- She's sittin' in a high chair.
Fin, I need you to set
a good example okay?
Sit down.
You ready to eat some dinner?
- Yes.
- Yes.
He came in and he was
like, where's the bread?
I need bread.
Can't function without the bread.
They have the best bread don't they?
That's a yes.
-  I'm so hungry.
-  Hey Ollie.
- What?
-  What are you doin'?
- Eating some dinner.
-  No but what are
you doin' with that straw?
- Putting it like this.
(laughing)
-  Were you doin' a shooter?
Were you puttin' like, the
paper in it to shoot it?
- Yeah, but it wasn't working.
- Oh it wasn't working.
I saw him over here, putting
a spit-ball in his straw.
Ollie, who taught you that?
- Mama did.
- Mama taught you how to do spit-balls?
- No, that was popa.
- I think popa taught you.
- He's always doing the
funniest, weirdest things,
and then I'm always like,
where'd you learn that?
And he says, popa taught me.
So thanks a lot popa.
(laughing)
Family time!
- Family time!
- So we have a little
announcement for you boys,

Should we tell 'em?
