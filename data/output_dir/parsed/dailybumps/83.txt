-  How'd you sleep?
- Good.
- Finn is like, so excited.
Come here.
Okay it is not super early,
but it feels super early,
because we were up so late last night.
These boys were really up
late and I was up late.
We all slept so good.
The boys slept in the room all night long
and didn't come out.
And they're so excited to find Fred.
- Fred's a superhero!
- What?
Let's see.
(gasps) Oh my gosh he's a superhero.
It says Scout Elf Superhero.
Oh my gosh.
And you wanna see what this note says?
The last few weeks have been tons of fun.
You've made my job easy
and I'm sad it is done.
Tonight I go back to give my report,
as Santa's list is ready to sort.
Our time together has come to an end.
Back to the North Pole,
your elf you must send.
Next year will arrive
in the blink of an eye,
just watch for the magic
and reindeer in the sky
He's going home guys.
This is it.
We gotta say bye to Fred
tonight 'cause he's--
-  Bye Fred.
(Missy laughs)
- Finn's like bye, see ya.
This is the last time we're
gonna find him this year.
We'll have to wait 'til
next year to find him again.
Is that kinda sad?
Are you guys gonna miss finding Fred?
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna miss him.
I'm gonna miss you guys coming in my room
and screaming "Let's find
Fred, let's find Fred!"
I think Fred's gonna
give you a good report.
You guys, there's--
- Look!
-  There's presents under the tree.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I didn't put those out either.
(gasps)
Oh my gosh.
- Are they for us?
-  They're for us
and they're from Fred.
He must've wrapped these last night.
It says to Uncle from Fred.
That's to Uncle from Fred.
Don't open it.
We can't open it right now.
Let's see what this one is.
(gasps) To Ollie.
From Fred.
Is that so cool?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, I think that is so fun.
Let's open these tonight, okay?
- Okay.
- I can't believe
Fred wrapped presents and put
them under the tree for us.
These boys are like obsessed
with their new toys.
Alright, let's eat some breakfast.
It's time for a random
Christmas dance party.

- Whoo!
We are just having a blast today.
We're all ready for our day.
We actually are looking a
little fancier today, aren't we?
- Yeah.
- (laughs) It's Christmas
Eve so I like to dress up
a little bit.
Although I also like to
just staying in my pajamas
on Christmas Eve too.
But I kinda was in the mood to like,
get a little bit dressier.
And we've been talking all
morning about how Santa Claus
is coming tonight!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
-  Finn, have you been a good boy?
He's like I don't wanna talk about it.
- Look!
- Oh yeah, they just are really obsessed
with showing you guys Fred.
You know today is such a magical day.
I don't know why I'm like so excited.
I feel like I haven't felt
like this since I was a kid
and I think it's because I have two kids
that are both like so excited.
And I can just see the magic in their eyes
and it like, it makes me
wanna cry every time I see it.
It's just, it's so intense.
And I love it.
I love Christmas and I've got,
I think what's cool is that,
this is the first year
Ollie really, really truly
understands what's going on.
And Finn, in a way understands
better than Ollie ever did
because he has an older
brother to kinda like,
be excited and tell Finn,
like we have to be excited.
And so I have two kids that
are just so, so so excited
for Santa to come, huh?
- Um hmm.
- Alright, we've been
doing a lotta cleaning
and I still have, an
entire kitchen to clean.
So I'm gonna do that now.
- Merry Christmas Eve you guys.
I am catching up on much
needed Christmas wrapping.
And I just gotta say you guys,
I feel like I'm a artsy dude.
I studied art in college,
I feel like I tend to be
a more creative person.
And I really enjoy gift wrapping.
And I don't know, I think
I'm pretty good at it.
What do you guys think?
Am I pretty good?
This one is to Missy, from me.
And I think she's definitely
going to like this one.
I just can't believe it's
already Christmas Eve.
There's so much excitement
in the air, I feel like,
in the house with the boys.
Just because they're so young
and it's so magical for them.
So I'm really excited for
tomorrow, for Christmas.
Today's gonna be a lotta fun too though,
we're having like a little
party with the family.
Oh, but one thing, that's also new,
check out my Star Wars tattoo you guys.
(laughs) What do you think?
I think it's just a good way to remind me
that I'm always a rebel.
I'm a rebel at heart.
Yeah, I've never had
tattoos, so this is my first.
And I like it.
Do you believe in Santa?
-  Of course.
Who else would drive the sleigh?
It's national eggnog day.
Don't hesitate to drink some eggnog.
- Eggnog? Hmm?
I don't, you know I am 27 years old,
I still don't know if I like egg nog.
Do you like egg nog?
Let me know down below in the comment
and in the ICard poll above.
I really wanna see, do
we actually like eggnog
or is it more of a tradition thing.
- Alright, the Hollister
side of the family party
has now started.
We've got the Vallecks
and Shaws and everyone
and we've got delicious food again.
We've got all these little appetizers
Bryan has been buying and they're so good,
so easy to make and just like delicious.
We got tamales from Carlos' mom,
we got cheese and crackers
and all kinds of sweets.
And we are just starting the party.
We're so excited.
Hey, you guys excited?
- Yeah!
-  Santa's almost here!
(screams)
(laughs)
- What?
- And I've got all of the
gingerbread house stuff set up.
It's looking pretty professional now,
after, I gotta figure out how many years
this has been.
- We always have candy.
-  How many years has this been?
- I think it's like four or five.
- No, I think it's like six or seven.
Yeah, and it's getting very professional.
I've got little dishes out,
'cause normally we just like
have bags torn open,
candy spilled everywhere.
This is kinda the adult table.
I even have a kids table.
CJ and Bailey are gonna do theirs here
and we've got these little ones
for like Ollie and Finn and Olivia.
It's gonna be so much fun.

Gingerbread house contest
is almost ready to begin.
We get crazy around here you guys,

Are you excited to design
something cool buddy?

You wanna try one?
- Yeah!
- Try it.
- Can I try one?
- Sure.
- I'm gonna try 'em.
- Um, it tastes like cherry.
- I'm the happiest, they're so good.
-  Really?
Do you think they'll look cool
on the gingerbread houses?
I figure someone can do maybe like a,
what's it called, like
an aquarium, you know?
(bright music)
- Alright it is present time
and we're opening presents
with all the kids.
This is like the 3rd time,
I feel like in this vlog,
you've done that.
(laughing)
- Look this.
-  Oh my goodness.
All the kids are opening their presents
and so excited!
What'd you get?
- It's so cool!
- Bailey's like opening up our present
that Ollie and Finn got that for you.
(laughs)
Finn, what did you just open?
Oh my goodness, your
brother's gonna love that too.
He just opened that and
he literally was like,
"Wow!"
(laughs) It was so cute.
Look at that Ollie, look at that thing.
(bright music)
-  Alright Finn, is this your gift?
- Wow!
-  Go for it, go for it.
Keep going, keep going.
- It's from...
Aunt Linda.
(gasps) What's that?
-  Batman.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  What do you say Finn?
Say thank you Linda.
- Look.
- What's in there?
-  What is it, what is it?
-  Whoa, a big old snake!
-  Whoa!
-  That'll be so
cool in you guys' room, huh?
Finn, say thank you Linda.
- Thank you.
- That's a big snake.
I think snakes are a
common gift this year.
- I know.
- I'm noticing them more.
Ollie, you got Superman?
Oh and another!
A Robotosaurus.
- Thank you Aunt Linda.
-  Thank you Aunt Linda.
(bright music)
We've got sword fights
happening over here.
CJ.

- Makeup!
-  Oo, you got a makeup kit?
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.
Merry Christmas.
(laughs)
(bright music)
Look at this present I just got.
It's got jingle bells on it.
- I know, these are cute.
It's like little ornaments.
- Oh that's so cool.
It is now time for the Christmas
saran wrap ball game again.
And everyone is so into it.
It's so much fun.
If you guys didn't watch us
play this game yesterday,
I'll have that linked in the ICard.
Go watch yesterday's
vlog so you can see it.
Everyone's getting really into it.
It's quite funny.
- Wow.
- You gave up.
(all talking at once)
-  You got it Janet!
(laughing)
(playful music)
Alright, the annual gingerbread
house building competition
has begun.
And the stakes are high.
The icing is firm.
- This is it.
-  And that's a nice clean slate
to start working with.
- Thank you, thank you.
-  What if you did
nothing and just went minimal?
- I still think I'd lose.
-  You never know what
the judges are looking for.
(jazzy music)
You doing okay over there CJ?
- No!
(Bryan laughing)
-  It happens.
-  Take it apart.
-  Oh, oh no!
- Why'd you take it apart?
-  Extreme Home Makeover Carlos.
- I told her, but she didn't listen to me.
- That's not true!
- Like I said, the stakes are high
and tensions are high, here at the annual
gingerbread house building
competition, 2017!
- Alright, me and Ollie are working on
our own gingerbread house.
-  He's doing such a good job.
- I know.
We're making one for Santa, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So cute!
A lot of people are like almost done.
And I'm like just starting.
So I'm excited to see
how they all turn out.
This is the kids table.
Jessica's working on there.
And this is an earthquake,
a California earthquake
before Christmas.
(laughing)
(bright music)
Alright, I hope you guys are having
an awesome Christmas Eve.
If you guys don't know,
every year we do an annual
gingerbread building contest.
We have a ton of really
awesome houses right here.
- And we need your help
to decide who wins this.
Who takes home the--
- So next I'm gonna show
you all of the pictures
of the gingerbread houses that
are actually in the running
with the name of them.
I'll have a poll on it.
Don't vote until you've seen them all.
And then go through and
vote for the one you want.
So it'll say vote for
this one, or no vote.
Make sure you wait for the one you.
It's up to you guys.
We have a really big prize for the winner.
So vote for the one you like.
Wait 'til you see them all
and let's do this.
(bright music)
Alright that is a wrap on the party.
We had so much fun.
We actually were able
to get most of the house
pretty clean, 'cause it was a disaster.
- It's okay.
- It was so bad.
I'm like Christmas morning's tomorrow,
my house can't look like this.
So everyone really helped and pitched in.
And it looks so much better.
And I did wanna say the winner
of the gingerbread contest
after putting it up onto the InstaStory,
so if you're not following on Instagram,
make sure you go see,
so you can see all of the final results.
Mine was terrible, it
was just falling apart.
It did not work at all.
I think I had too much going on
and I couldn't really focus on it.
The winner was Cassie and Carlos!
- It only took me seven
years, seven years to get it.
- She has never even
come close to winning.
Her house usually looks
like, a little crazy.
- If you guys wanna know why, it's Carlos.
- Yes, I think that they're a good team.
So anyways, she won.
It was called The Candyland.
It was actually really, really good.
Anyways yeah.
Now we're actually gonna do
some of our traditional
Christmas Eve things.
And so I'm excited to
get the night started.
Even though it's kinda late.
(bright music)
So these are our presents
from Fred he left today
'cause it's his last day.
Uh Finn, don't open
any yet, we gotta wait.
We're excited to see what he got us.
- He got everyone gifts.
This one's Finn's.
Uncle, this one's yours.
That's Ollie's.
Ooo, I got one too?
Alright everyone open your presents.
I wonder what's in 'em!
I wonder what we all got.
-  Pajamas!
- Thanks Fred!
-  Fred got us some nice pajamas!
-  Look how cute they are.
- I got a Christmas tree one.
-  Finn, what'd you get?
Nice!
- Aren't they so cute?
-  So they're onesies.
- Yeah, and then the back, it says.
-  No peeking!
- No peeking.
-  No peeking at your
Christmas presents early,
okay Ollie?
- Okay.
(Bryan laughing)
- It's so cute.
- Alright, now we all have
to get in our pajamas guys
and take our family pic.
- You gotta get in.
- With the new,
with the new duds.
Alright you guys, I think we're gonna use
some YouTube Christmas magic
so that we can all change
into our pajamas much faster.
Right?
- Yeah!
- Okay, on the count of three.
- Here we go.
- Everyone go ho ho ho.
Those are the magic words.
And we'll all have our pajamas on.
Ready?
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay, one, two, three.
-  Ho ho ho.
(group exclaiming)
- It worked!
Look, we're all in our magic jammies.
(laughing)
- Oh my gosh, I love these.
- What do you guys think of our onesies?
-  Turn around.
-  Everyone's wearing
matching Christmas jammies.
- We look so cute!
- We're all matching.
- I honestly think these are my favorite.
-  They're nice, they're thin.
- I think they're nice.
And there's a lotta fleece online
when you're buying Christmas.
- Both comfortable and they fit.
-  I'm proud of all
you guys for sporting this.
We did good.
- Alright boys, we gotta get
our cookies out for Santa, huh?
Is Santa gonna bring you presents tonight?
- Yes.
- Have you been a good boy though?
- No.
(all laughing)
-  At least he's honest.
- Last night he was a little iffy.
Tonight he's like yes,
I'm just gonna own up to.
- I was kinda bad today.
(happy music)
-  Alright, it's
cookies and milk time.
- Hey Mom is it, does
Santa like this milk?
- Yeah this is organic milk,
so I think he's gonna like it.
- Milk.
-  So let's put some
cookies on the plate for Santa.
Maybe some chocolate chip.
Did you wanna do some
of these pink ones too?
-  Yeah.
-  Maybe just like
one or two, you know.
- I've heard he's a
chocolate chip guy, honestly.
-  Yeah.
And then Santa will
eat your cookies, okay?
- Good job.
Alright.
-  We need milk.
-  I will pour it in.
-  Okay, you pour it in.
How much milk do you think he needs?
-  That's good.
I think he's gonna love that guys.
- That's stinky, stinky.
- Wait. (laughs)
No it's not, it's good, it's good.
- Okay, I was like we
cannot give expired milk
to Santa Claus okay?
That'll get us in trouble.
- That would not be good.
-  Alright, we are gonna put
our cookies and milk for Santa
under the Christmas cage.
- Oh no no, no no no.
(laughs)
We're gonna have to put the dogs away, so.
-  Yeah we are.
Here's our Christmas cage.
Directly underneath it
will be cookies and milk,
so maybe boys, just maybe,
we can actually catch Santa.
- Yeah.
- We have a song called Let's Catch Santa.
We at least should try
to catch him, right?
- I think we should try.
-  Do you wanna catch Santa, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, let's try, okay?
(happy music)
- Night Fred.
-  Goodnight Fred!
It was so fun hanging out
with you this year, bro.
- Bye Fred.
- Bye Fred.
-  Alright we have some corn
and I think we should put it
out for the reindeer, right?
- I think that's a good idea.
-  I don't think we have
anything else to give them,
so maybe they'll eat some.
-  Let's go see if
we can see Santa in the sky.
- Alright, we're gonna
see if we can spot him.
Oh, there's a reindeer. (laughs)
-  That's a fake one.
-  Oh, okay.
- Okay, so where
should we put this?
- How about right here
on the fountain for the reindeers.
- I wanted Santa to see us.
-  You don't want him to see us?
- Santa won't, if Santa sees you awake,
he just will wait until
you're asleep, okay?
- He's so afraid that
Santa's gonna see him awake,
and not come.
- Don't worry.
If we see him, he's
just gonna circle around
until you're in bed, okay?
- Okay.
- Gotta get in bed
or else Santa can't come.
Let's go!
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds
while visions of sugar
plums danced in their heads.
And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap
had just settled down
for a long winter's nap.
Pipe he held tight in his teeth
and the smoke it encircled
his head like a wreath.
Can you not smoke in my house Santa?
Please.
(Missy snickers)
That's inappropriate.
-  That's funny.
- Then if you wake up,
then you need to stay in your bed.
But if you get out
Finn, Santa won't bring,
Santa won't come, then he
won't bring your presents,
right Momma?
-  That's right, huh?
(Ollie babbles)
Alright boys, it's time for night.
-  Circle.
-  Okay, we
gotta go to sleep, okay?
I love you guys.
- Alright, we're opening
the last night of our Advent calendars,
we're getting ready to read
Twas the Night Before Christmas,
which does not have
Jack Skellington in it,
I had to remind Ollie of that.
It's Nightmare Before Christmas.
Oh I think all yours are done,
'cause you ripped 'em
all out early, huh Finn?
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
And I hope you guys had
a very merry Christmas.
So excited for you to see
our Christmas celebrations tomorrow.
So be on the lookout for that.
Thanks for watching guys.
We will see you manana.
- Merry Christmas.
- Who wants to do the bye boo?
Oh say merry Christmas guys.
-  Merry Christmas.
- Mine.
-  (gasps) Is that Santa?
- Yeah.
-  Say Santa!
-  Santa.
- Merry Christmas guys,
we'll see you tomorrow.
Say bye!
-  Bye!
-  Boo.
(upbeat music)
