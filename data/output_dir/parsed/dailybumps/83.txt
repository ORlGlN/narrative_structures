-  We are going to FaceTime Santa.
(phone ringing)
Boys, who's calling?
- Santa.
-  Santa, we'd better answer it.
-  Alright guys, should we answer?

-  Good morning.
- We are just waking up this morning,
and of course is...
- Morning.
- Day two of finding Fred.
And, we haven't found him yet,
but we're about to go find him.
The boys can not wait
(laughs) any longer, huh?
This will be the start
of a very crazy December
of getting up early and taking the boys
to go find Fred.
Are you ready to look for him?
Where are you looking
Ollie, did you see him?
-  He was right there.
-  He was right here.
And he's not on the Christmas tree?
- Lets see.
He's not on top
or over here.
-  Nope.
- Not on the Christmas tree.
-  Hmm
-  Let's see out
of the living room guys.
-  Okay.
Fred, where are you?
- Fred?
- Hey! (babbles)
-  I see something.
-  What do you see?
(gasps) What's that?
-  His reindeer and his puppy.
-  What is this?
Is that a marshmallow?
What is the marshmallow connected to?
(Finley babbling)
-  Fred?
-  It's connected to Fred!
Was he fishing for the reindeer?
(Finley babbling)
He must've brought you some friends!
(laughs)
Did he bring you some
friends and some books?
Ollie, this is Buddy, your friend.
Remember you got him last year?
-  Mhmm.
(Finley babbling)
-  Buddy!
And Finn, you have your
own little friend now.
Isn't that cute?
-  Wow, that
puppy had to have been
(mumbles)
- Yeah!
So if you guys don't know,
Fred usually brings a
little friend for the boys
to get to play with and touch,
and they can rub the
little heart for magic.
We'll have to read the
story and remember exactly
what they're here for.
But basically they're just a friend that,
because they can't touch Fred up here,
they can't touch him
and that's kind of sad,
they can touch their little friends, huh?
-  Mhmm.
-  Is that cute?
- Yeah.
- That's Buddy!
We have to name this one now.
I think Finn should name this one
since you named this one.
How cool!
Isn't that cute?
-  Uh huh.
- So you guys get to keep these
until Christmas, and
then once it's Christmas
he's going to fly away with Santa, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
So cute.
Alright, we have to get ready for school.
My alarm is saying it's
time to go to school.
(Missy laughs)
And look at what the reindeer is wearing.
He's wearing a little outfit, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  And check it
out, Fred matches them.
He's wearing the same
little pajama outfit.
How cute!
- Here, Finn.
- Mama!
-  I wonder if we
can get you guys matching
outfits with your reindeer and Fred.
-  Mama! (babbling)
- Yeah, a bear with a heart!
The heart is magic.
Can you rub the heart?
Good job.
And you get to rub your heart.
How neat.
Alright, let's go get
ready for school, okay?
(upbeat Christmas violin music)
Alright, we are all ready for school,
and the boys have their elf pets.
Finn is like loving it.
Oh and Finn's decorating
the tree right now?
(Finley singing)
And singing Christmas songs?
- Yeah!
- You're so cute!
(laughs)
Alright, are you ready for school?
Oh no, you're not ready for school!
Your hair's a mess!
We've got to do your hair,
And then we've go to go, okay?
-  Okay.
-  Let's go.
Alright, the boys are saying bye.
-  Bye. (sadly)
-  Give kisses and hugs.
-  No!
- (laughs) Finn's a little sad
that you're leaving, huh?
But you're going to have a fun day.
(upbeat guitar music)
Are you excited for school, Ollie?
-  Yeah.
(upbeat guitar music)
- So I just dropped off Ollie at school
and I have a ton of errands to run,
one of them being I have
to get an oil change,
which always takes up so much of my day.
But with Exxon Mobile they
have recently launched
Mobil 1 Annual Protection
Motor Oil changes.
So with Mobile 1 Annual
Protection Motor Oil,
it guarantees one full year of driving,
or 20,000 miles in
between every oil change.
With having to get only
one oil change a year,
this gives me so much more time
to do so many fun things with Ollie.
(upbeat music)
- I love it!
- Do you like that?
- Yeah!
- Mobile 1 Annual
Protection is available at
Wal Mart and select auto parts stores.
This video is sponsored by Exxon Mobile,
and if you would like to get information
on only having to get
one oil change a year,

- Good morning you guys!
♪ It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas ♪
Check out this awesome sleigh
and this Santa was apparently
hand-crafted in Napal.
This is how we do Christmas you guys.
Missy and I are obsessed,
you guys know that.
But I am also really excited because
I got invited to the Grammy's, you guys.
This is a Grammy invitation
that was sent to me.
It's the 60th Annual
Grammy Awards in January,
in New York City.
Look at this, this invitation is crazy.
I am so excited.
Missy and I are going
to try and get tickets
this year, so that we can
have a birthday celebration
for me in January and go to New York
and see the awards show.
I think that would be amazing,
and definitely like a bucket list thing
that we've always wanted to do.
But as for right now,
I am waiting for Finn
to wake up from his nap.
Missy's out running errands with Ollie,
they're having a super fun day.
And it's nice to be back in the house
after our little cabin get away.
I'm enjoying being back
home and being back
in the swing of things.
(upbeat Christmas violin music)
I was just looking out my office window.
Look at these trees!
They're basically brown.
These two trees are going to be bare,
I'm calling it, by the end of the week.
All of those leaves will be on the ground.
We've been getting so many lately.
All of our trees in the pasture over there
have turned brown.
It's getting to be that
time in California.
I know we're a little late.
Everywhere else it's
snowing and dead trees.
We just had a hot week, okay?
I'm feeling great that its, what is it?
Oh here.
Hey Siri, what's the temperature?
71 degrees right now, 71 degrees.
That's not very Christmas-y.
Alright you guys,
Only 26 days until Christmas!
- Yeah!
- Are you so excited, Finn?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
Finn is still rocking his
Elf on the Shelf pajamas because he is
so excited that Elf on the
Shelf is back, aren't you?
Yeah, you got the Elf?
- Yeah.
- Nice. (laughs)
He's just chilling', watching
some Christmas shows,
playing with his toys.
Did you have a good nap?
- Yeah.
- You guys, he slept in Ollie's bed
for nap time, and he did so good.
Was Ollie's bed comfy, Finn?
- Yeah.
- It was?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, so Finn slept
so good in Ollie's room,
which just makes me think
that we should definitely
be getting the room ready for both boys,
because we want both boys to
share that room eventually.
They do night time already in that room.
They read books, and then
they just go to their
separate beds.
So, we may be doing that soon. Hopefully.
I'm still kind of in shock
about our entire house
is decorated for Christmas already.
You guys did not see the
surprise yesterday with Fred,
I'll have it linked above
so you can watch it.
What're you doing?
(Finley babbling)
- (laughs) Oh really?
You doing the splits?
(Bryan laughs)
What is this kid up to?
Oh no, pick up your car!
(Bryan laughs)
He's so funny.
Where are you going?
(upbeat Christmas violin music)
Welcome home Ollie!
Hey, guess what boys.
- What?
- I just got a text message from Santa,
not kidding, he said he wants
to check in on you guys.
Does that sound cool?
I love technology you guys.
We are going to FaceTime Santa.
- Are you excited?
Are you nervous?
- Yeah.
-  What if you've been naughty?
Have you been naughty or nice?
- Nice.
-  Nice, well make
sure you tell Santa that
if he asks you, okay?
-  Okay.
-  Okay, Finn, you say
nice if he asks you, okay?
You guys have been
really good and he knows.
- Nice boys, they have
been really good boys.
-  Yes, they have.
(ringing sound)
Boys, who's calling?
- Santa!
-  Santa! We'd better answer it!
-  Alright guys, should we answer?
-  Yeah.
-  Press the green button.
- Hello there!

you just talk to Santa?
- Ollie, you just talked to Santa!
- And he knew your name!
-  How cool was that, Ollie?
- Yeah!
- Oh my gosh, so cool!
-  Maybe we should
call Santa a couple of times
and just see how things
are going with him, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, before Christmas we'll talk to him
a couple more times, okay?
That was so cute!
The boys just Face Timed Santa!
(Finley babbles)
Yeah, and you told him you want a truck?
You got a little nervous, is that really
what you want for Christmas?
(phone ringing)
Is he calling again?
- He's calling again!
- He butt dialed us.
It's okay, Santa butt dialed us.
(laughs)
Is that really what you
want for Christmas Ollie,
a truck?
- Mhmm.
- Okay.
- Yeah? Alright.
- And you also want like that
Power Ranger dinosaur gun, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I want that one.
(Missy laughs)
-  Finn, next time we talk to him
you have to tell him what
you want for Christmas, okay?
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Maybe Finn wants a new baby bottle
with two (mumbles), it's a baby bottle.
(Missy laughs)
- A baby bottle?
Oh, he wants the Baby Bottle Pop?
The candy?
- Oh yeah. (laughs)
- Finn likes that, he sure does.
That was so special, we
got to talk to Santa!
(Missy awes)
You did really good, dude!
- Yeah.
That Power Ranger was so cool,
I want to call him one more time.
- You want to tell him now what you want?
- Okay, now that Ollie really knows
what he wants for Christmas,
we'll have to call him
another day, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
You've got to smile, smile!
You've got to be happy!
I love that face.
Oh he's hugging you guys.
This is what it's like to hug Ollie.
Alright you guys, I just got another
text message from Santa.
He said he's super
bummed, he didn't see Finn
sitting next to Ollie, so
he's going to call back
one more time so that he
can talk to Finn, okay?
- Okay.
- You wana talk to Santa Finn?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
You can talk to him again.
- He's calling!
- He's calling!
Can you press the green button?
- Hello, there!
Merry Christmas!
Ho ho ho ho!
I know who you are.
You are Finn, aren't you?
- Yeah!
- So, I've been watching you from the
North Pole lately.
- He's been watching you.
- And I found out that you haven't been
going to bed on time.
I'm a bit disappointed,
but I want you to promise me that you will
go to bed on time from now on,
and listen to your parents.
- Say okay.
- Will you promise?
- Say yeah.
- Fantastic!
Now tell me, what do
you want for Christmas?
