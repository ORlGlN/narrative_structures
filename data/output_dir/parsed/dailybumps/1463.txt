there
hey oli raspberries oh you have to get
real cured in a second huh and frisbees

got ourselves a good old-fashioned storm
where these skylights all through the
house and so when it rains we can like
hear it like really really well look at

wet dog there - he's like we were you
guys gonna play with me I'm gonna play
with me you're playing in the rain karma
you're all wet and dirty now we gonna
get you a towel okay this is actually
really cool just to be able to like sit
by the window and watch the storm it's
kind of like an old worldly thing you
know what I mean the funny thing is is
that the rain woke me up but it did not
wake Oliver up who by the way is still
asleep in his crib from last night he's
been sleeping in there all night first
night he's ever done that so that's
pretty pretty stinking crazy look what
else we woke up to today you guys 70,000
subscribers it's actually seven thousand
thirty-four and every time I've clicked
to check it it's been more we have
seventy thousand people who are
subscribed to this channel now what do
you think about that it my crazy oh my
gosh I just want to thank all of you
guys who've been watching us you know
from the beginning and who are just now
joining us like this is it's really
quite insane and when we started daily
vlogging we never thought one that would
be coming up on day 402 that we'd have
over seventy thousand people watching us
and literally it's been like a year in
one year we've gotten 70,000 subscribers
and I think that's huge and kind of
unheard of actually I just want to thank
you guys that means so much to us we
don't take that for granted at all and
we just appreciate everyone's support in
watching these videos this is weather

break it's a big tree I don't know it's

and it did not wake this kid up who's
still sleeping well I think my grown up
little boy is awake
what are you doing you little munchkin
you didn't he slept all night in your
room what do you think about that I
cannot believe that you guys I actually
woke up like really really freaked out
and panicked because he didn't sleep all
night um I had to like come in here and
nurse him a couple times and like rock
him to sleep you remember that
three o'clock the morning I brought him
into my room like I usually do and I
nursed him and then I tried to put him
back to sleep just in our room though
and he just couldn't get comfortable he
was not happy he was just fidgety and
moving like crazy and couldn't get
comfortable and I spent like an hour
trying to get him to go back to sleep
and Brian even woke up tried to get T
back to sleep on and he just wasn't
having I was like I'm just gonna try and
go in his room and rock him to sleep and
put him back to sleep in his crib I
don't know what made me do this but I
just did it and he just went straight to
sleep in his bed it was like he
literally just was like I don't want to
sleep in here I want to sleep in my room
I woke up like looking for him cuz I
couldn't because he wasn't in my room so
I was just like oh my god
where's the baby I like I actually panic
like he fell off the bed or something I
don't know why but like I just I just
got really scared but he was just asleep
in his bed you're asleep in your bed huh

peel like this is just one piece right
here that's Talent but we got our
breakfast which apparently is going to

this great dance which I'm gonna be
honest as a true Californian I do not
think you're supposed to drive in rain
no one apparently is the roads are clear
the roads are clear because everyone's
staying home today I am scared of the
tornado we're talking about the tornado
stuff I don't know if that's gonna
happen or not I hope not
tornadoes it's cool okay I'm gonna tell
you guys something not to try and
convince you all of that what was that
that was my phone giving a flash flood
warning in this area until noon boy on
what areas check local media avoid the
roads
that was crazy it is really nice living
in California because we don't have
tornadoes we don't have hurricanes we do
have earthquakes but really we don't
have earthquakes
alright so Missy totally came prepared
and we have an umbrella
my puppy umbrella it little hit puppies
Monica so she can dream as we're running
into some school huh oh these shoes are
falling apart Missy it's exactly why I
bought shoes last time because it was
pouring rain and they were filling with
water

today and he's playing with Donald Duck
to sort of keep him a little bit more
relaxed
ready to go in here this one

the wall afterwards he's smiling babe is
that fun right look at this you guys set
up a mirror right here so he can
encourage pulling himself out you see
yourself we just had a swim class and it
was so good I actually had Oliver take a
nap before class and so he was really
well rested and he was in a great mood
through the entire class he paid
attention he enjoyed it he was smiling
to the end so I think that helped a ton
so I'm really really happy with how that
went it was good right yeah really
okay so I totally just turned on the
monitor and had a panic moment cuz I was
like uh where's my son
and then I scrolled up oh there he is
oh man Missy is taking a nap all I was
taking that we're watching frozen
