Oh big guy thing for the bum very nice
of you
this is our time dating
do amazing things
also woke up with one of these nasty bad
boys stupid blister from putting these
couches together yesterday catching up
on some community I just started season
four and jumped like halfway through it
I was like yeah I think about I hate
when you like start a show and you don't
know how much of it you watch but I want
to watch it because I hear the new
seasons are really really good
now that the original guy is back and
probably gonna have to rewatch a couple
of so it'll be worth it that's the show
so funny anyone else watch community let
me know okay
I'm also watching this show right here
this shows much cuter sleeping away hey
hey where's the baby
there's the baby hey what are you doing
up I love being through the crowd him
he's so damn cute hey he's sleeping on a
blanket that Kelsey made for you auntie
Kelsey made the blanket for you huh
knit ready hi hi good I'm good he said
AG uh you guys literally inches from my
face you guys no no no don't play it it
come running guys all is up from his nap
way too early I don't even know I think
he's only slept like 30 45 minutes so
frustrating but we're working on it and
we officially have way too many people
in this house because I have a half a
cookie left and it wasn't just me and
Brian you guys you're stuck yeah all
right I'm eating the last half of a
cookie then that's it until someone
sends us more cookies because I think we
have more coming a lot of people said us
messages saying I'm bringing cookies I'm
like yeah you can never have to make a
gift
hey babe I don't think this is safe I
know I don't know if I I just like that
down all right let's go cuz we were
talking here she literally got in the
car and sat down in the front seat with
him I think this will be better
yeah probably much safer so who there's
a
do it it's all smudging okay so we're
grabbing some lunch at and Albertsons
and look at this you guys this is like
the evolution of the spork
it's foldable like they actually
expected us to eat something with that
oh it snaps right in there that's so
funny are you obsessed with sports yeah
this you love sports you guys this is a
very look it's almost like half of it is
for normally it's just like a little tip
oh yeah this is like a hardcore spork
you guys and it's foldable so it's ultra
portable so if you ever been like oh I
really want to take the spork spork with
me but it's just too long you just go
boom fold in half and then slip it in
your pocket slip it in your pocket I'm
gonna keep that there all day I might
need a spork later you never know can we
get you oh good I catch you huh
gimmie gimmie gimmie Georgia are you
excited I'm gonna go put him down for a
nap because we have swimming lessons in
an hour
speak we went in the morning my dad
really wanted to go and see all in the
water
um so oh my goodness car you're so cute
um so we swish it a little bit later in
the day so my dad you just love gosh
come here come here can see the baby
can see the baby
all right look over there I think just
loves him
he loves karma oh I'll get you anyways
it's time for his nap alright so we just
got pillows for our couches and I really
like them they seem uh who do they see
they just add like a little bit more
color um or as you can tell we're trying
to do like this whole blue color kind of
theme I like it looks cool well I tried
really hard
there you ah ha I tried really hard to
get him to nap and he wouldn't I pretty
much sat in his room for like 30 minutes
he went nap so now he's napping in the
car that's good good for you ollie I'm
glad you're taking nap now second
swimming lesson yeah so I and my parents
my my dad like really wanted to go he's
like I said my dad's like the swimmer of
the family he's like I think he's just
really excited about it look at this you
guys he's got a little hard on his back
you're on your butt kiddo you ready
ready go swimming yeah they call them a
guppy Missy how cute is that
I love ducky swimming towards his little
polar bear
ah a little exposure
they actually move his hands and his
feet because muscle memory is really big
for his age group and essentially
repetition is going to teach him later
on his life to blow bubbles like ponies
under water and to move his hands and
feet and illustrate to his back stuff
like that so he may be little but stuff
like this really important for
repetition I put a bear straight to the
mouth
I think they're going to do actually
some merciless I'm smoothies first time
actually going all the way under ring
around the road
oh good
trying go under one more time not just
we have a good night you guys
he went under and so what do you blow in
his nose right individually doesn't
breathe n yeah he breathes in right as
you gloat and there's no sweet and then
he doesn't take the breath I think yeah
do you think Jim how'd he do get really
good underwater guppy we can call him an
ally wad yeah right lollipop gonna be a
frog about this one
he loves the music every time of it the
music on he like actually dances it's so
funny as you guys know I lost my monkey
blanket which I'm totally obsessed with
I've been using it since Oliver was born
and I was really really upset about it
and I even cried and I'm really sad
about it
Brian's surprised me and got me this
monkey blanket but it's not really a
very fun copycat
yeah but it really says that sucks but
at the same time I didn't really mind
yesterday we got two more of the monkey
blanket but there's still like kind of
sort of like the fake ones they
shouldn't be allowed to do that you guys
because they do have like the same logo
and everything it's super weird do you
want to thank Lauren whoever else gave
us these because they're always backs up
backups and it's totally awesome and
thank you so much
but someone named Angela actually got us
so real real it's not fake it's soft
it's so cool it's got like the backing
which is why you tell the design is like
so much clearer lady writer
yeah really oh yeah you so much Angela
that's awesome yeah thank you everyone
even though like this is kind of like
the real one I feel like we have backups
if my dream comes true my dream comes
true and all he actually does you know
love his blankie we got backups
available all right you guys this little
guy is tired so we're gonna put him to
sleep but I hope you guys enjoyed the
vlog we're trying this new thing where
it's a little bit shorter format but
don't worry you guys are still seeing
everything that we do we just wanted to
maybe test this out do something little
different so click thumbs up if you guys
enjoyed the vlog we're gonna put this
little guy to sleep oh I want you guys
leave comments on what age did you learn
to swim it's pretty interesting a lot of
people didn't start as early as Oliver
and when I learn to swim I was I think
older I was probably six and I literally
just fell into the deep end of a pool
and learn how to swim by pretty much
crowning doing it wrong I thought I did
it okay back in the day thank you guys

too much of it and we'll see you
