if we can go see the sunset at angkor
wat look at this we got hot dog buns and
garlic for all the spirits
good looking out I know right oh we just
stepped into our hotel room this is
crazy it's huge all right we got our
passes to go to Angkor Wat and we're
jump back in and headed there hey that's
not a bad photo of me do you guys see
this water next to us this is a moat and
it is the largest and moat ever it's one
of the wonders of the world
that's ginormous people did that by hand
we're not people slaves
holy cow you guys look where I am right
now this isn't crazy
that's the actual stairs and then they
build those ones these stairs weren't
good enough apparently for it this is so
cool this is Angkor Wat right in front
of me this is crazy
that mom cat an iPhone
that's cool he's with it Krisha do you
see that monk had an iPhone and an
iPhone 6 had that that's cool okay we
were walking in here now and this is
kind of crazy
check this guy out he's all decorated
even so we have just entered into the
city at Angkor Wat and this is where all
the town people normal people there'd be
villages would be little stations and
markets and everything here and they
weren't a lack actually allowed in
people pakoda
that was just for the monks oh okay so
that when you've seen over here is the
actual pagoda that's the template yeah
yeah so we're now wearing the town's
clothes and this is all Nagas still yeah
Naga serves is like the the railings
look at that you guys saw the one out
there is way better looking than this
one this one has seen some time Wow so
cursed was telling me that these two
buildings all along the side of the
pagoda are actually libraries or war
libraries back when this was an actual
city this crazy imagine if we built
cities like this nowadays what it would
be like you know so you can see they're
refurbishing this they're putting these
metal rods in here so that this doesn't
crumble but still just look at the
detail of the faces in this sculpture of
Naga now got all hand-carved all pink
that's insane what they just have like
thousands of like professional hand
carvers
so this right here we see it's like
historically religion
this is like their Bible and illustrated
form Wow brother fighting who wants the
power of the kingdom and the fight
against each other they're like evil
that monkey spirits fighting each other
I don't know the exact story yeah
that guy's got a spear it's just so cool
that I can basically stand here and lean
against this ancient stone you to look
at leaning against the ancient stone
this is a lot of what they would have
done the monks in those times they would
have leaned against this stone and they
would have just turned to the city of
Angkor Wat and just watch the sunset and
then they'd go eat the rice
I'm hungry too we have not we have not
eaten anything let alone rice here's
where a healing pool of some sort would
have sat and in here they got incense
and they decorated these this is so cool
oh wow wow that's beautiful so we're out
of place called hub street and it's
really cool they got lots of food we're
gonna find stuff we check something out
the fish can do massage thank you so the
fish they actually eat all the dead skin
off your feet it's really cool and it's
like a little massage
oh my gosh weirdest things that I've
never felt in my life you have to get
over it you have to get it over it you

touching the moment that we kind of
missed the moment as much as like

like capture all those memories

moment and so it was really fun to just
like relax and totally like chill out
