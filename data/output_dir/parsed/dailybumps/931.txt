his head room
good morning time good morning buddy you
playing with Woody and Buzz and Zerg
uh-huh and you got your milk he's eaten
breakfast got some raisin bran crunch
and some oranges yummy huh he woke up
with a little bit of a runny nose we
have a little tissue for him so you can
you can wipe your nose with your tissue
okay yeah keep that clean
we're getting breakfast together and
it's kind of one of those morning's
where we're like everyone's kind of
scrambling to get something checking
milk to make sure it's not expired we
want to make biscuits and gravy but we
have no gravy mix which is kind of funny
because missio is yells at me from
behind too much gravy mix and now we're
actually out of gravy mix say yum good
morning guys all right I'm gonna be
honest the fact that I have whoo there's
some clothes on just a little bit of
makeup on is quite accomplishing to me
um it's accomplishing I don't know if
that's a word I just did not feel like
doing anything today I mean I felt like
doing stuff I didn't want to get ready
and sew up my hair this is what my hair
looks like today that is a impressive
fun if you ask me yeah I've actually
been organizing all these room and I'm
just trying to organize like our room
and stuff like that I just didn't feel
like doing anything but guess what I got
dressed put a little bit makeup on and
I'm feeling pretty much good so as far
as ollie sleeping in his bed I can't
even tell you how incredibly proud and
impressed I am with him last night went
amazing he went right to sleep in his
bed he slept all night I did not I was
totally stressing like I kept going in
there and checking on him making sure he
was good and he slept all night he even
slept in he slept till 9:00 o'clock
until I finally was like I'm he just go
in there and check on him again then I
go in there like 9:00 a.m. and he is
fast asleep so I just like crawled into
bed with him because that's like what I
wanted to I was like if I'm getting him
a new bed I just want to be able to like
crawl into bed now with him because you
can't really do that in the crib even
though I did actually do that in the
crib - I crawled in the bed and he just
like snuggled up right next to me and we
laid in bed for like 30 minutes until he
woke up and he looked up on the wall and
he saw like what looks like a move he
goes no it was so cute like I just he
slept so good in his bed so that's him
right now sleeping away in his bed all
tucked in happy as can be he's such a
good boy I have to say that all he has
always been really good
transitioning from things but I'm gonna
be honest like I do take credit I feel
like we have raised him in a way that
he's just he's very calm child and we're
always working on things with him but
when it comes to like big transitions
like this we usually tend to take him
really calmly and I don't know I feel
like we're doing a really good job cuz
he's so he's such a good boy he
transitions to things really well do not
want to do anything and I am tired and
I'm really not doing anything and I
think all he's waking up from his nap
and I'm kind of just watching him right
now on the monitor cuz I want to see
what he'll do so there is you can see
his little eyes are awake he's just kind
of rolling around right now but he's
totally not getting up like he I sort of
thought that he would just start getting
up and playing with his toys or
something but he's just sitting in his
bed and I crazy all right I'm getting
Ollie and I just want to show you guys
my my area of my hallway right now it is
such a disaster but I will say it's an
organized disaster at the moment we will
have it cleaned by tonight but all right

animals and music check out what I got

hey hey oli yeah I know you got your
tools - hamat you cannot yell like that
buddy I've never had an actual toolbox
you guys I had this really cool tool set
that I got for Christmas a couple years
ago and they're all kind of just like
lost and like thrown and like some of
the little bits and stuff are like
breaking off and it's kind of just a
mask as a cheapo set so I went out and
got a toolbox because I've been doing a
lot of stuff around the house like
putting furniture together and fixing
things and hanging things so I want to
have a nice toolbox where I could keep
everything organized and safe so I got a
toolbox and then I got a lot of
different tools like I got gloves and a
hammer and like ratchets and and this
mallet you know what this is for I also
got a brand new drill which has already
come in handy because I used it a ton
yesterday in all these new room but now
I'm going to organize all of this into
this little box nice and neat
Wow

little swimmer now you can't tell him
what to do Missy
he left it and went to Papa we are
hanging out at the pool it has been very
very hot today I'm actually gonna grill
up some carne asada and some Folio asada
a little bit later but for now we're
enjoying the pool and the heat all the
heats literally just don't give birth in
it okay
look at that belly it's so nice when
you're pregnant it's been because like
all the pressure and pain melts away
when you're in the pool yeah me like I
just I have no pain there's no like
pressure on my back and there's no like
it was nice you feel like the baby
inside of your belly that's just
floating around and then when you lay on
your back do you even have to try me
