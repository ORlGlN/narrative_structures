- Look, look!
-  Look, Payton!
- She's like "yeah"
-  Yeah, who cares.
- Is it Barbie, or like, is it Barbie?
-  So funny.
♪ This is our life, lets live it. ♪
♪ Live it forever. ♪
- Good morning.
- How did you sleep in your new bed?
- Good
- Good? You guys have been
doing it pretty stinking good.
I'm really proud of you.
You seem to stay in your bed
better because Finn is there.
Does he make you feel
like you're not alone?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? That's so good.
We have to find Fred today, but first,
we need to get dressed.
We have a fun day planned.
You guys, it's two days
'till Christmas! Two days!
- (excited exclamation)
- So we have a party tonight,
and a party tomorrow night,
and then, it's Christmas!
- (celebratory noises)
- So, it is basically Christmas Ollie,
because we're getting
Christmas presents today,
and we're gonna party.
It's basically Christmas
for the next three days.
- Yeah.
- Alright, we're gonna
go ahead and get dressed.
(happy festive music)
- Good morning boys.
- (excited responses)
- Alright, it is time to show me
your Christmas Eve, Eve outfits.
Finn you look so cute, you got Snoopy?
-  You got Snoopy dog?
-  And you got Darth
Vader and Stormtroopers?
So cool. You guys are looking good.
-  Little ripped jeans.
- Oh!
-  What?
- (unintelligible response)
-  Fred?
What happened with Fred?
Should we go see?
(gasps)
Oh my goodness.
-  That little stinker.
-  Fred! What?
Let's go look!
Fred loves pranking us,
and apparently he loves
toilet papering our tree.
This is out of hand.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  That naughty Fred.
- How original Fred,
you've done this before.
What do you think of that Finn?
-  Isn't that crazy?
How do you think he did that Ollie?
That's a lot of toilet paper.
-  Yeah.
-  What do you think did that?
-  Look at the star!
-  He got the star too, yep.
-  Oh my goodness.
We are gonna have to clean this
up before our party tonight.
We can not just let-
I can't count on him to clean it up,
he never cleans it up, huh?
- (unintelligible response)
- Oh, you're right they
would think it's funny, huh?
- Silly Fred, he's always up to no good.
And yeah, he's laughing, huh?
-  So, I forgot
that we had this hanging
on our refrigerator.
It's a little present,
and what is it Ollie?
- It's from me and it's for you.
- Did you make it?
-  Yeah.
-  (gasps) This
came from school right?
- Yeah.
-  Alright let's see it.
Oh my goodness!
Wow, it's your hand print,
and it has sparkles on it.
Did you color it and put
the sparkles on this?
-  Yeah.
- Wow! You put your hand in
paint and put it on there?
What did you think of all that
paint all over your hands?
Yeah was that kind of funny?
- Yeah
-  I love it, this is another thing
we're going to have hanging in our house
or on our Christmas tree, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  I love it, thank you.
Go show daddy.
-  That is so cool, dude.
Look at all that cool glitter.
- How about right here?
-  Looks good, yay.
So we are getting ready to start wrapping
some last minute Christmas
presents that we have.
Finn cannot stop talking
about yesterdays adventure.
You just want to go sledding, huh?
This is actually a wall decor piece
and Fred used it yesterday
because he was excited about sledding.
What?
- I want to ride.
-  You wanna ride?
- Yeah
-  Where are you gonna ride it?
- Ride.
-  Ride.
You guys, yesterday was so stinking fun.
Finn was so cute sledding down the hill.
If you guys haven't seen yesterday's Vlog,
it's like a snow miracle.
And make sure you go check it out,
I'll have it linked up here in the icard.
Alright so, momma is
dressed as a present, huh?
- Yeah.
- And we're wrapping presents!
-  Yes.
- I think it's actually nap time now
for you, and for Finn.
So, I'm gonna go put them
down for a nap real quick.
- So it is now time for
quiet time for both the boys.
They are in their room watching
a movie, check this out.
Don't get off the bed Finn,
you gotta watch a movie, okay?
We have this really cool projector
that just projects the
movie right on the wall.
It's quiet time right?
-  Yeah.
-  Okay, I brought a little stool
to put your projector on, so
it's up a little bit higher.
That's a little nicer, huh?
(Slow bass music)
- I feel like a big part of Christmas
is trying to distract your little ones
while you prepare.
We also are having a little
Christmas party tonight
with some family, which
is gonna be super fun.
We have to wrap presents,
we have to do our big plastic ball game.
That was such a huge hit last year.
Everyone's like, "We
need to do that again!".
So, we have to put that together.
We have lots of fun things to
do before the party tonight.
The boys got a great
little nap and a rest,
and now we are going outside
and we're gonna see if our
snow is still out here, huh?
-  Yeah!
- If you guys did not
see yesterday's video,
basically we caught Yeti
and we had a winter
wonderland in our backyard.
Do you think the snow's still there?
-  Yeah.
-  I'm really curious to see
how long it lasts in California.
-  The snow's still here!
-  It is?
Oh my gosh, you guys it's frozen solid.
-  Go! Yey!
-  Wow! That seems
to work a lot better
than it did yesterday even, huh?
They're so stoked they're like, 'Yeah!'.
Here we go!
Finn, you went all the way!
- Yeah.
-  That was so cool.
Ollie's going again he's doing
it by himself like a big boy,
sit on your bottom!
Weee!
Nice, this is so cool, the boys love this.
I am so glad that Yeti was
able to use this magic powers
and give us a sledding hill, huh?
Almost, one more time! There you go, nice!
Alright Ollie, Finn is
sitting on the fireball,
I just need you to give him a little push.
(Slow bass music)
(Fast festive music)
-  Look at this beautiful
Christmas eve, eve sunset.
I love it, it's awesome.
Luna and Karma are enjoying
their very first Christmas present.
It's an outdoor dog bed,
so that they can,
hopefully, stay off these.
You two just love cuddling all the time,
uh-huh, okay, I'm sorry.
I interrupted their cuddle fest. (laughs)
(Fast festive music)
- Alright, so we're preparing
for our first Christmas party tonight.
In preparation for that, we
are baking some fresh cookies.
The boys actually-
- (squeals of delight)
- helped make this yesterday with daddy,
while mommy rolled peanut butter balls.
So, now we're making two dozen of them.
I've got another batch ready to go in,
and these ones are
almost ready to come out.
Are you excited to eat them?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- You guys look at my
ugly Christmas sweater
I'm wearing tonight.
It's got stars and Santa
Claus riding a unicorn.
I have a feeling the
boys are gonna love it,
so I'm gonna go show 'em.
Hey Ollie, look at my sweater!
- Wow!
-  You like it?
- It has Santa Claus,
and Santa Claus riding a unicorn in space.
- In space.
- And that is so cool, it has stars!
- I know, I didn't even realize
that he was actually in space.
Check out Missy's Christmas sweater.
It is also a unicorn.
So, we're kind of matching
with our unicorns.
-  The party has started,
we got the whole Johnson
fam here, and Vinton.
Oh, hi!
This is actually my mom's
side of the family party.
We are having so much
fun, just hanging out.
We're about to do gifts next,
so yay! It's gonna be fun.
-  There are so many
presents around this tree,
and it's not even Christmas yet.
Open 'em guys!
- I got the green basketball player!
- I know his size, like I
know he's gonna be like 6'10.
-  Yeah, yes!
They got a midnight, mini hoop, midnight.
Oh what did Finn get? Oh cool!
(Festive music)
- I got the painting book!
-  That's so cool!
(Festive music)
- I got the Kylo Ren!
-  What!
- Payton, look!
-  Look Payton!
- She's like yeah, what?
-  Yeah, who cares?
- Is it Barbie? Or like is it Barbie?
-  So funny. (laughter)
(fun festive music)
-  So we are doing a
little white elephant game now.
Well not a little, this
is a lot of people.
But, Ollie is showing his
new room to Payton right now,
so (whispering) I'm gonna
go see if I can spy on 'em.
What you guys doing?
Payton what do you think
of the boys' new room?
- Cool.
-  You like it?
- Look at my new bed!
-  Yeah!
Did you see this Payton? Watch.
-  Yeah, I saw that.
-  It's like a real fire.
You share a room with Olivia right?
- Yeah
-  Do you like it?
- Mm-hmm
-  Yeah.
Ollie do you like
sharing a room with Finn?
- Yeah
-  Yeah?
They are so cute
and Payton has been so
sick the last couple days,
so they haven't been
able to see each other.
(Festive music)
- Alright we're starting
the saran wrap ball,
and it's humongous!
They're for rolling doubles,
whatever they get, they win. (laughs)
-  So everyone is
really excited about what?
The $10 Starbucks gift card.
- No, in the middle there
is keys to a brand new car.
-  Oh!
- There's a couple of
packs of gum as well.
-  Actually I've
got the keys to your car,
is that okay?
- No bro, I have sweet tug ropes in there.
-  There's gonna be-
there's something pretty cool.
(Upbeat jazz music)
- Finn help, help me Finn.
-  Help Finn! Help Finn!
-  Yes!
(everyone exclaiming)
- And Finn got the pop rocks.
- Nice dude! High five.
Or not, there we go.
That's not your laugh,
that's not his laugh!
- We got a big one!
- That's not his laugh!
Add to your list, plastic
wrap you're running low.
(Upbeat jazz music)
-  Missy got a nose.
- So cute
(Jazz music)
- Bro I got some nerds!
Holiday edition.
Missy now, Missy your nose
has turned into a pimple.
- Yeah. (laughs)
- She's wearing it on her forehead now.
(upbeat jazz music)
-  Look at this
pretty pop socket I just got.
- I got snacks!
-  Can I have some?
- Yeah, you can have them.
(upbeat jazz music)
-  Panera gift card!
Are you kidding me babe?
The family goes crazy
over this game you guys.
Cassy, mutilates it every single time.
Carlos is a machine.
Bro, I got a rose gold iPhone holder.
- Bro, I'm in the middle of something.
- This is getting, where you can see
the presents now inside.
(everybody yelling)
(upbeat jazz music)
- Oh my gosh, are you kidding me Missy?
Why did you rig this game?
-  Are you- Stop it!
-  Oh!
Bro!
Power station plus, homie.
- Ooh I like this. I got a
loofah and some hydration butter.
(cheers of excitement)
-  (announcer
voice) And Missy wins,
with the JBL wireless speaker!
- Trade you a loofah.
-  Alright you guys
so the party has ended,
but the fun never ends.
The boys are getting ready right now,
with Missy, to go to bed.
But, I thought it would be really funny
if I walked into their
room, dressed in this.
Yeah. (laughs)
How's this look you guys?
So I'm gonna walk in,
I'm gonna be like this.
Like, "Whoa! Santa,
santa, santa slow down.
Santa Santa slow down! Whoa."
- Alright boys we are
getting all ready for bed.
-  You guys I
think we caught Santa!
I caught Santa!
-  (gasps) Oh my gosh!
- Whoa
-  Wait what are you doing!
-  I caught Santa!
(audience gasps)
(festive music)
-  I'm on his
shoulders you guys look!
- What is going on?
Is daddy on top of Santa?
- Yeah.
-  He's running around!
- What is going on? He's
riding on top of Santa!
- Yeah, so I caught Santa
in the Christmas cage,
and then I hopped on his shoulders.
-  Is that so funny?
- Yeah.
-  The boys are so
confused, what is going on.
Do you wanna go give Santa a hug? (laughs)
-  (unintelligible question)
-  Wow, daddy is flexible.
-  How many legs do I have Ollie?
-  One, two and three!
-  And four!.
-  Yeah.
- So these are my real legs,
they look like Santa's legs though.
-  I feel like it
literally took them a minute
to figure out what was going on.
- Does it look like I'm riding on Santa?
-  Yeah.
- See these aren't Daddy's
legs. These are fake.
Santa is so cute.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  Ho Ho Ho!
-  Look at that beard!
- How cool would it be to catch
the real Santa though, huh?
But we should put Santa's
cookies in the Christmas trap.
-  (gasps) What if we caught him?
-  In the Christmas
cage, wouldn't that be cool?
- Yeah
-  Should we catch Santa Claus?
- Santa Claus is gonna come today?
- Not tonight. But tomorrow
night he's supposed to come
and bring us all presents,
you guys especially.
-  have you been naughty? Or nice?
-  Nice.
-  Finn have you been nice?
- (unintelligible noise)
-  Ha, he's like-
-  Yeah, he's like, I guess.
- I guess we'll leave that
up to Santa to decide.
- Who's judging?
-  (laughs)
We had such a fun Christmas party.
I just actually love
hanging out with my family.
That was just the first one.
We got a big one tomorrow again,
so we're excited to all hang out.
-  Whoa.
- Wow, Santa's running around again.
Lets go ahead and end today's
video, so we can go to bed.
It is so, so late.
Give the video a big thumbs
up if you did enjoy it!
-  Thumbs up guys.
Merry Christmas Eve, Eve!
-  (baby gibberish)
-  It's almost here.
Thanks for watching guys.
- Okay, we'll see you guys
tomorrow, bye! (laughs)
(happy upbeat music)
