we got brand-new mattress bigger
mattress we were rocking a cow king now
and we also have this thing it's called
a dry tech it's really cool especially
if you have kids but it's essentially
like kind of like a fitted sheet that
goes over it and we can pour water on
this and it won't touch the mattress at
all nice yeah
so this kid decides to poop pee vomit
spit up anything it's machine washable
so that's really nice
okay so we are at Missy's cousin's house
cuz we're gonna film an episode of look
who's vlogging but I got a phone call
from the woman I talked to yesterday and
she told me that she talked to her the
two brothers and they want to talk to me
like they were sitting right there and
they were like give him our number so
she gave him me their numbers crazy
thing is is they talked to my dad and
they basically told him or he basically
told them I had no idea what was going
on in the conversation I am aware of him
he was like don't worry he knows about
you and he wants to meet you okay so now
I'm calling the oldest brother of my dad
who I guess at this point is confirmed
as my birth father
oh hey yeah it's Brian
Wow really that's so funny because when
I heard about all this I know this then
your dad Wow
you don't know it that you have a huge
family Wow this side you've got cousins
brothers three sisters cousins second
cousins Wow mom still alive yeah she is
okay okay I remember your mom actually
called the talk to your dad last night
afterwards I was just dumbfounded I I
you know I knew nothing about it
I remembered your love like I said we're
filming some shots for a future look
who's blogging episode and we he's two
cuties on a little date huh he's he very
distracted by the dog he's like puppy oh
and I scared the dog oh hi guys hey you
stuck to your very messy as you are got
a little Mozart in the mail I don't know
I got Jeff he's so talented click thumbs
up this town
I know he gets really into the music oh
so I want to talk more about the phone
call because I didn't really get a
chance but basically he said whatever
happens with your dad you are blood and
you are family and it sounds like they
are really really family-oriented which
is really awesome and they do things
together as a family
they want to they want to meet me and
they want to see me and they want to
meet my son and my wife and they want to
be a part of our life and it was like
the most amazing phone call I'm I'm like
freaking out about it so it's like I'm
so excited
honestly I feel like this is kind of
just how God wanted it to work out so
basically I have a huge huge family on
my dad's side cousins aunts uncles
couple brothers and sisters yeah like
and I never really had that on my mom's
side I had a couple aunts and I had my
mom and my sister my grandma I even sent
him a picture of all I had I just took a
picture really fast of all three of us
and send it to him and he said wow you
look so much like your dad and I was
like there's someone out there who looks
like me I don't I mean like I don't look
I mean I don't really like I have
features of like my mom but I don't feel
like I got actually like look like her
you know what I mean so it's totally
like I just think that you actually have
a lot of the features that the brothers
have because we've seen pictures of the
brothers and it's really crazy it's
really cool and he was like naming off
things like he's like you've got like
Cherokee blood like he's like going on
it's like you're related to these people
who are like I don't know like how doing
cool things about me yeah he's like
they're actually putting together like a
family genealogy and he's like you're
gonna be a part of it now it might not
go
exactly perfectly but like you said it's
like it's how it was supposed to be and
you have possibly a whole nother family
and so cool all right guys the real fun
has begun hello it's been a little bit
of crazy day but yeah really really
really read decisions to make
yeah so we're picking here we get 500
500 600 yeah so we're trying to figure
out what kind of sheets we want we like
high thread count sheets once you lay on
the high pick out you're like like never
going put in lotions he's quoting
something um Sam I don't know we're
trying to pick sheet traffic colors
trying to pick comfort we gotta buy it
all night or we got nowhere to sleep
memory foam Lake hello I don't know
there's so much here for your back
yeah we're in Bed Bath & Beyond and oh
my god bad heaven I don't even we're
like in the beyond one I'm beyond I'm
over one yeah there's just so much here
who got little all in here taken in yep
he refused to take a nap at home I was
trying to get undertaken take a nap but
he wouldn't so he slept all the way here
and then just popped right in his
stroller and there you go okay right
we're now in the car we're headed
somewhere else to look at some sheets
and he's still asleep it's the craziest
thing he hasn't slept on the go in
forever like months I feel like like
I've transferred him from his car seat
to the stroller and then from the
stroller back to the car seat he's still
asleep
this kid is obviously just exhausted we
can get things done while he naps that
is perfect member we were like when he
was so much younger like he would
literally sleep every way would just
drive around do everything we need to do
and he would just sleep the entire yeah
especially because it was easier cuz we
have a book you know snap and go car
seat you know he's tired when you can
put him in his car seat and strap him in
and he doesn't wake ya a really big
plate he had so much
paetynn at my cousin's house they are
just he just loves them because he's
like the same age as him and they can
just like crawl around I think that is
important for him to socialize he loves
other babies like playdates at this age
are kind of more for us I'm Allison I
understand but the same time he just
smiles when he sees other babies he's so
happy and I think that it's important
for them to like like learn each other
like how I think they learn from each
other in a way you know like I don't
know if you do playdates let me know
like what the pros of them are exactly
like do they learn from each other oh
thank you actually needed a a good drink
no it's okay you can I got it you can
let go hi I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
drop it
this guy's rude look at this super comfy
pillow you guys mm how's that feel mmm

all right so we're in the process of
this putting together our bed and
everything

very weird for me to say um add me on
Facebook she is my and she is the
daughter of my dad so she's my
half-sister and she found me on Facebook
and we're gonna I found her on Facebook
and now we're going to talk on the phone
hello hi sister Wow is this like crazy
or what and the bed is made and ready

this really wait date oh I think that
this is supposed to go the other way oh
really
yeah I think we put it on wrong okay
would you I didn't I shouldn't have the
buns on my side me oh one second um -
there we go
okay so we switch to comfort around this
is the way it's actually supposed to go
now we're gonna jump into bed go hey
wearing underwear yeah okay ready go oh
I love it
I can't wait to crawl into it I think
the debate is gonna be like so different
I'm excited
well I just got off the phone with my
other sister up until a couple days ago
I only thought I had one sister but um
we talked and we got to talk about my
dad and it was really cool getting to
just hear her and and talk to her in and
she answered a lot of my questions and
um it's funny because I asked if you
know my dad had anything that he was
passionate about or he liked to do or he
was always doing like a hobby boy I'm
gonna say her exact words I said yeah
she said the main thing she remembers
about him as a child was that he always
sang goosebumps right yeah like I'm one
of those people who's like I'm like a
sing-songy person I sing all the time
and I like singing and so hearing that I
was like oh my gosh and even earlier
today I will admit I was like I wonder
if he sings I was like creative at all
you know that was really cool today was
just he has a passion for singing in
that and music yeah today has been very
overwhelming but a really good kind of
overwhelming I'm just really excited for
what the future has you know and I think
Missy now we're talking about this
earlier is like I'm one of those people
who was like if I want something I'm
gonna do it you know what I mean and if
this is something that I wanted to do
and I like finally put my heart into it
and I was like I'm gonna do this and
look what happened you know what I mean
so I just hope that by doing this it
sort of inspired you guys and if anyone
if you're looking for a family member or
or have gone through this before you
know I mean family is really really
important I've never even met my dad but
he's important to me because he's
happened that's all I gotta say
I'm gonna lie down on this very comfy
bed I hope you guys enjoyed today's vlog
