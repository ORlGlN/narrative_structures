I think the point of this game is to
decorate your house the fastest right
because it's pretty much all gonna crash
down within ten minutes well actually
the time it right because if people are
done that there's a fall apart first and
then ours will be done right in time

your use of the frosting as snow
ingenious really
thank you rarely see that done nowadays
in a gingerbread culture my dad's
apparently a Santa's vacation home yep
yes he lived in Florida this is where he
would lay it's a Santa truck but um it's
but it's a superhero home oh so this is
the trap for Santa
so he goes in here and then he's trapped
then you get to keep him all year round
and you can force him to make you toys
basically okay overall winner overall

also but we wanted to hit him the night
before Christmas and we were like crap
we don't have it I know we should have
bought it for my burns number like a
nice book yeah we weren't really
thinking but the iPad saves the day I
found it on the iPad for two dollars so
we're gonna read ollie the night before
Christmas actually never read this me
either
yeah okay twas the night before
Christmas when all through the house not
a creature was stirring not even a mouse
the stockings were hung by the chimney
with care in hopes that st. Nicholas
soon would be there
the children were nestled all snug in
their beds while visions of sugarplums
danced in their heads
mamma in her kerchief and I in my cap
had just settled our brains for a long
winters work when out on the lawn there
arose such a clatter I sprang from the
bed to see what was a matter
away to the window I flew like a flash
tore open the shutters and threw up the
sash the moon on the breast of the
new-fallen snow gave the lustre of
midday to objects below when what to my
wondering eyes should appear but a
miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer
now Dasher now dancer now Prancer and
vixen on comet on Cupid on Donner and
Blitzen to the top of the porch to the
top of the wall now dash away dash away
dash away all and then in a twinkling
that heard on the roof the Prancing and
pawing of each little hoof as I drew in
my head and was turning around down the
chimney st. Nicholas came with a bound
he was dressed all in fur from his head
to his foot and his clothes were all
tarnished with ashes in a bundle of toys
he had flung on his back and he looked
like a peddler just opening his pack his
eyes how they twinkled his
dimples how merry his cheeks were like
roses his nose like a cherry his droll
little mouth was drawn up like a bow and
the beard of his chin was as white as
snow
the stump of a pipe he held tight in his
teeth and the smoke it encircled his
head like a wreath in a broad face and a
little round belly that shook when he
laughed like a bowl full of jelly
oh it was chubby and plump a right jolly
old elf a wink of his eye and a twist of
his head soon gave me to know I had
nothing to dread he spoke not a word but
went straight to work and filled all the
stockings then turned with a jerk and
laying his finger aside of his nose and
giving a nod up the chimney he rose he
sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a
whistle and away they all flew like the
down of a thistle hustle but I heard him
exclaim ere he drove out of sight happy
Christmas to all and to all a good
Santa's dashboard right now he's
actually in Boston and he will be
leaving to New Haven in about 46 minutes
oh my gosh look it has a real-time
number of how many presents he's
delivered six billion so far he's
sleeping away yeah all right guys we're
gonna go but I hope you guys enjoyed the
vlog be sure to give it a thumbs up if
you're excited for Christmas it's
Christmas already for you guys we still
gotta wait then a tree Christmas anyway
thank you guys so much for watching and
we will see you tomorrow
it's our first Christmas with baby Olli
baby's first Christmas it could be like
the first stages of mastitis I'm like
really freaking out
because I probably should have brought
like my pump because I really need to
like train my move so we're just talked
about but you know I'm just really
worried to say like really hard like it
even hurts even hold him on this side of
me because it's like he cleans up
against it and it really hurts
I don't have any other symptoms so
