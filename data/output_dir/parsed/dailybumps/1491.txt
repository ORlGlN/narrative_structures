okay I am so excited you guys because
Brian actually spent a lot of today
fixing my phone playing about the other
day that I didn't have any store and I
couldn't take any pictures and it's
always like when I want to take a photo
after like to lead a bunch of photos so
I could do it I do want a bigger phone
because I want to be able to have all my
pictures on the phone instead of having
to put them on the computer and then
deleting them feeling mean I like to
like I know I just like them on there I
mean I want to be able to look at him
whenever I want Brian found this cool
app is called a box and basically he was
able to put all my photos
box it cleared up almost like seven
gigabytes right Brad so yeah he can make
it so that when I take a photo it just
automatically is there so I can just
delete photos off so they're still on my
phone basically but they're just kind of
like in a separate spot so it's really
cool I'm really excited about it because
I didn't want my photos deleted off my
camera or my phone but I still want to
be able to take photos especially as
we're going on vacation I do not want to
be like stressing about how many photos
especially when you have a baby you
can't just take one photo it takes like
20 photos to get one what are you doing
you silly boy are you supposed to be
down there oh he's legit leap ass look
