-  Oh, hey there Finn!
Good morning.
- Mee-ah!
-  Morning!
What are you doing?
-  I playing.
-  You're playing!
Finn has been playing all morning
and Ollie's actually off to school.
We actually haven't found Fred yet,
so we're hoping that we
find him a little bit later.
But we are getting really excited because
we are picking up Ollie
just a little bit early
after school, but before
nap time and stuff,
and we are going to go meet Santa!
(laughs)
-  Are you excited?
- Yeah, I'm having fun.
- You're like, I'm having
so much fun doing this
I don't want to go anywhere.
Uh, yeah, so this is Finn's outfit.
Ollie's actually wearing his right now.
And we're gonna go pick him up,
and we're gonna go meet Santa.
Are you gonna tell him what you want?
- Yeah!
-  Chocolate face?
- Oh, hey, Finny Foo Foo.
He's racing his bike around
the house like always.
Good morning guys.
Today's a fun day because we
are going to see Santa Claus.
Not just any Santa Claus.
I'm just going to clarify at
the beginning of this video,
this is the real Santa Claus.
Ollie and the boys have been
going to see him for years now.
I don't know why I'm wearing
my sunglasses inside.
I'm in front of a very bright window
in case you were wondering.
And that's how that works.
Okay.
Yes, we're going to see
Santa, and I'm so excited.
Hey Jibo! Do you like Santa?
-  I haven't thought
about that, but I can tell you
I really like dancing.
- Oh, cool.
Now my pet robot is dancing.
You dancing with Jibo?
(Bryan laughs)
You're so cute, dude.
Uh yeah. We are getting
ready to go pick up Ollie
early from school and we
are gonna go see Santa,
and I am so excited.
Also, check out this amazing
succulent wreath I got
for the door of my office.
I got this from Restoration Hardware.
It was on sale for Black Friday.
And I thought it was so
cool because it's like
kind of Christmasy, but
also like, kinda something
I can hang up for a
while until they all die
or it falls apart.
I have a pretty cool succulent wreath,
and then per some of your
guys' suggestion on Twitter,
I added a little red bow to it.
So I made it a little more Christmasy,
but how cool is that?
I love that.
-  Ah Dah!
-  Finn, you're crazy!
Hey, let's go get Ollie, kay?
-  Kay!
-  Let's go get Ollie.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
-  Ollie!
- Hey Finn, are you excited to see Santa?
- Yeah!
- Yeah? What are you gonna ask him for?
- I don't know.
-  Oh, one of those?
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.
(Missy laughs)
- No idea.
-  Hey dad, I look
funny with that face.
-  Yeah you do.
You didn't like the soup?
-  Yeah.
Bye!
-  You saying
"bye" to all your friends?
- Going to see Santa!
- Yes we are!
Just picking up Ollie from school.
How was your day at school?
- Good.
- Good?
So we're getting him out
of school early today.
We're going to go get lunch and
we're going to go see Santa.
That's exciting?
- Yeah.
-  You know what
you're going to ask him?
- A Power Ranger toy!
-  Finn is getting
ready to go see Santa!
-  Hi guys!
-  What do you think?
Does Finn look good?
-  Finn looks real good.
-  Funny.
-  You're looking good, buddy.
(laughs)
We have arrived at Santa Town
and we're gonna go see Santa.
Um, you guys, I'm really proud of myself
because they both look adorable,
but they're not matching.
- Yeah.
Normally we have the boys
matching, like, all the time.
No matter what.
- Okay, I'm just saying, though,
if they did have two of these,
I'd probably put Ollie in it too.
-  Look at that bow tie, dude.
- Yeah!
-  Looking shnazzy.
- We're going to see Santa!
-  Yes we are!
The boys are all ready to go see Santa.
Are you ready to enter Santa Town?
- Yeah!
-  Let's go, boys.
(Christmas music)
-  You writing a note to Santa now?
It says, "Dear Santa,
My name is Oliver.
I am a boy.
I would like the following for Christmas:"
And that says "a Power Ranger, games,"
so a Power Ranger and then games,
and then, do you want to
write a few things you want?
A few more things?
- No.
-  No?
- No.
-  Just a Power
Ranger, and then some games?
- Do you want to draw him anything, Ollie?
You should draw him a chicken.
Would that be funny?
- No.
-  No.
(Christmas music)
-  Finn is asking for
some toy cars and a tool set.
- I just colored a power tool.
- Oh cool!
Good job, buddy.
So when the boys met Santa,
he gave us some very
special signs that say
"Santa stop here."
Ollie, do you know what those are for?
- What?
-  So when you go to
bed on Christmas Eve night,
we can put this in the window
so Santa knows you guys are asleep,
and then he come come to our house, okay?
- And then he'll stop, because it says
"Santa stop here."
Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
-  It's like a Santa stop sign.
- All right, should we go
put these in the mail box
and send them?
-  Go ahead,
buddy, pop your letter in.
Just put it right in there.
There you go.
Sending letters to Santa.
Thanks, Ollie, helping
your little brother.
(Christmas music)
We are now doing some ornament decorating.
Finn is coloring a little bear.
And Ollie's coloring a
little gingerbread man.
- We have glue and glitter if you want.
-  Ooh, cool.
-  If you want glitter,
you got to add the glue first, okay?
(Christmas music)
-  Glitter time!
-  Yeah!
-  Be really careful
when you sprinkle it.
Yes.
And then watch, you just go like this.
-  Whoa, it's got glitter!
-  It stuck to it.
-  Cool, dude.
All right, the kids are now gonna
put their ornaments on the tree.
Go ahead, dude.
Ooh, I like that spot.
Is that one yours, Ollie?
Good job.
You hung yours on the tree?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So if you guys come down
here to Santa Town in
Temecula, you can see the boys' ornaments
on the tree they have here.
Super cute place, the boys had a blast.
That's so cool.
(Christmas music)
- Coming to town.
-  Finn's so
excited cause Santa Claus
is coming to town.
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice.
-  Santa
Claus is coming to town.
- Oh yeah!
He's so excited.
- He like, says "Mama! Ting!"
-  Yeah, he like,
demanded that she sing.
It's so funny.
(upbeat music)
- All right, we just got home,
and the boys are excited to be here.
Ollie's been a little
bummed today, though,
because you haven't been
able to find Fred, huh?
- Yeah.
- What?
Oh, how did you find him that fast?
Was he there this morning?
I'll tell you this:
he was not here this morning,
and he was not here when I left, Ollie.
So he must have showed up.
Okay, you want to see what it says?
- Yeah.
-  It says, "I'm
back and I missed you."
He missed you.
All right, Fred, what have you been up to?
He said, "I hid six candy
canes in the living room.
Can you find them?"
(gasp)
Can you find the candy cane?
Oh, Finn already found one.
What the?
How are you so good at that?
All right.
We got one.
Can you find any more?
Looking on the Christmas tree.
Can you see any?
- No.
-  We actually
don't have candy canes
on the Christmas tree.
All right, we're having trouble.
Ollie's gonna check the fire place.
-  (gasp)
-  Do you see one?
- Yeah!
-  Go get it!
Yay!
All right, that's two.
Right?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
- Now, let's see if we
can make a mustache.
- Ooh.
Watch mama make a mustache.
-  I wanna see!
-  (laughs)
- (giggles)
All right.
We still need four more, guys.
Where are all these candy canes?
I think Fred might have made
it a little too hard to find.
So let's see.
Hmm.
Do you see anything?
-  Ooh!
-  No.
-  No?
Do you see one?
- Mama!
-  Oh look!
I think he found one.
Finn, you did it.
-  I thought that
was one disappeared.
- Oh my gosh, Finn.
You saw that from across
the room, didn't you?
Um, Finn has found two
now, and Ollie's found one.
That is so funny.
Finn, you're getting to be such a big boy.
Okay, we still have three more to find.
-  Hey you guys, Fred's back!
-  Yeah, he hid six candy canes.
- What?
That trickster.
-  We've only been able to find--
-  Ooh, is this one?

Okay, two more.

Okay, the next person wins.
Who's gonna find it?
Ollie or Finn?
- Are they tied?
-  Yeah.
They each found two.
Finn legit found two.
- That's awesome.
- Like, before Ollie.
Are you checking the tree?
Check it again, see if you see anything.
There's a lot of stuff on here.
It could be easily mistaken, or missed.
-  There's a young Fred.
-  Oh, there he is. There's Fred.
- Where's the candy cane, guys?
I'll check on this side, up here.
Ollie, you check on that side.
Look up high.
Is it in there?
Is it inside the middle of the tree?
-  Fa!
-  Here Finn, you wanna look?
-  Hey!
- Oh do you see it?
-  Yeah!
- All right.
-  Finn, do you see it?
-  Yeah.
-  Where is it?

You did it.

- Yay, you found all the candy canes.
- Aw, that was a fun game.
Thanks for playing a game with us, Fred.
That was so cool, huh.
How neat.
Fred is the coolest guy.
Now we get these awesome candy canes.
And candy canes are so good, huh Ollie?
- Yeah, but sometimes, they're mint.

Sometimes they're like,
