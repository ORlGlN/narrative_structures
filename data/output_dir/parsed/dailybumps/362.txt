alright guys I think the cat is out of
the bag in yesterday's blog you guys
noticed something in the background and
I'm here to say whether it's true or not
wherever you are that's where I wanna be
that big
here's why
just funnin around in
coming all right thank you
Mali's good morning I bet she agrees I
just fed the UM the tattle
you said the tackles I don't know what
he did I thought I'm gonna go ahead and
start the vlog and have you come show me
so I started to worry then he fed them
too much we said I said it really good
and let's see so did you already beat
him yeah I mean I think you did pretty
dang good and look at all our tacos are
still alive I don't think any are dead
which is actually pretty surprising well
yeah that is quite a few tadpoles none
are dead that means they're doing good
they're adapting to their little habitat
that we made them the job medium but
maybe next time just wait for mom okay
so I can help you that way we don't see
them too much okay as you can see though
right now the house is buzzing we have a
lot of different projects being worked
on just mostly like internet stuff home
security stuff clothes stuff all kinds
of stuff everywhere I look there's like
another person that I don't know in my
house right now so yeah we have a lot
going on today so I actually have some
ones going on that I kind of was like I
don't know what to do so then I went and
worked on Vegas what do you see Oh
yep that's one of the projects I just
got done we put heaters out here and so
we can sit out here and everything is
getting leveled we're getting ready to
lay our concrete all around the pool
which is exciting because we leave yeah
completely different vacuum yeah luckily
we have Cameron out there so we can kind
of watch it but you guys will not see it
until we get back and I think it can be
a lot different when we get back they
have that structure going up it looks
like it's really coming along and
everything's starting to get leveled and
it's looking cool you excited yeah he's
really cool it's like a birthday party
out there

to keep oli happy but he's being so
silly right now

where what is under the exit hmm the end
of the X in the net
what are you gonna go get cops guys do
it oh so many days may have noticed in
yesterday's vlog we had a couple of
magic bands sitting in the background
and I think that has basically confirmed
where we are going someone you guys have
been wondering we've been talking about
packing and getting ready we had a big
trip plan last week it got cancelled
metric is back on and we are very very
excited all I can say is it's going to
be a very very magical spring break and
we are going to have some really fun
exciting vlogs I'm going to be doing
some stuff for the first time and taking
the boys with us and
going to be a blast and we're going to
be joining some friends as well but I
thought I'd show off these special magic
bands this is a stitch one for ollie
which he loves putting on and he's so
excited then we have a Beauty and the
Beast one for Missy with Lumiere and
Belle on it and then mine I got up so
mine has Carl and the balloons and the
bird on it and these things are
basically going to be our lifeline when
we're in Walt Disney World because this
is our room key it's how we pay for
things is how we get in the park how we
do fast class Plus reservations
everything is done through these so
really excited to get to experience that
at Walt Disney World yeah let me know in
the comments what you guys are doing for
spring break this is going to be
definitely up on one last spring break
we did did niolani in hawaii and that
would be so cool to do again but we kind
of dismissed the nose and you really
have to plan ahead for something like
that we were lucky that we were able to
plan Walt Disney World on our own after
our initial trip fail to go through so
it's going to be a really fun spring
break so today we're packing tomorrow
we're leaving all righty we have tons of
clothes laid out for Finn or a long trip

night though so I don't think I'm in you

also holding one pair of pants for each
