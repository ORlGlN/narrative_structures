- Good morning!
- Good morning.
- Hey guys good morning.
We are headed out of
the house this morning.
The kids are with Mimi and Papa
and we are going to?
- The ranch.
- We're goin' to the ranch.
We're gonna go see some horses.
And actually Missy is going
to be doing a little lesson
to brush her up on all her horse skills.
- I mean I've been in lessons
before and I know how to ride.
And and I know everything but I told her,
I just wanna start like from the beginning
and just really get into it all.
Because I am gonna be
getting a horse very soon.
I think I might have found the one.
And I just wanna be like,
totally like, oh yeah,
I know how to do this
when the horse comes.
- It's gonna be cool for me to see it too
just 'cause like I have
no experience with horses.
I don't even know how
fully comfortable I am
around horses still.
I'm gonna observe and Missy's
gonna do all the work.
- Maybe you can hop on too,
I think that'd be fun.
I'm a little nervous actually because
I've always been horses
and I'm comfortable.
But I hope it all comes back to me.
(gentle music)
-  So this morning,
Missy is gonna hop on Rusty
and we have Felicia here.
And what are you doing?
- Dutch braiding.
- Dutch braiding.
- Isn't that beautiful?
- His tail.
That is crazy.
- I'm upset,
like I have to learn
to do that on my horse.
- I don't mind teaching
you and I can teach
you how to fish tail and french braid.
- I already told Michelle
she's my hairstylist
and she's like, can I fish tail her braid,
on her tail like yeah, go for it.
-  That is so funny.
You ready to hop on here?
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
- Billy is living his best life y'all.
Look at him layin' down with
his legs all spread out,
just eatin' some grub.
What's up dude?
Oh I'm sorry I didn't
mean to make you get up.
He's like okay I'll stretch.
(soft music)
I looked away for one
second and Missy hopped up
on that horse, like a pro.
(gentle upbeat music)
Missy is doing so good.
She is now starting to trot a little bit.
She looks so good up there.
(inspirational music)
Finn!
What are you doin' here buddy?
Are you here to see mama on the horse?
- Yep.
- Yeah.
I like your boots.
Hey big guy and my other
big guy how are you?
You wanna see mama on the horse?
- Yeah.
-  She's been
riding around on the horse.
Isn't that cool?
Can you say horse?
- Horse.
(giggling)
-  Say hi Rusty.
- How you doin' up there?
Feel good huh?
- I'm trying to get him to trot.
- Yeah Rusty's being a little lazy today.
-  That's probably good.
A good started.
Say hi.
-  You wanna watch mama ride?
You guys look like little cowboys.
- That's your mom.
- I know.
-  Plaid.
- I dressed 'em up.
-  All right the boys
are hangin' on the fence
watchin' mama ride the horse huh.
That's pretty cool.
Feelin' like a cowboy?
(soft music)
Lunch on the ranch huh boys?
Look at 'em sittin' up here,
eatin' their peanut butter and jellies.
Make sure the pig doesn't
eat that sandwich okay?
- Kay.
-  You gotta eat your sandwich.
Whoa Ollie, look at you dude.
- Good job.
- You're so brave Ollie.
This is so cute.
The boys have been so
in to like cowboy hats
and cowboy boots lately.
I did not expect Ollie to just
jump up on that horse with Missy.
Even me, I'm a little skeptical.
I'm like, no thanks.
And Ollie's like yeah, sure, cool.
You havin' fun Ollie?
It's really high up huh.
(tranquil upbeat music)
Good job Ollie.
- You wanna give him a pat?
- Thanks Rusty.
- You wanna give him a treat?
-  There you go.
Good job dude.
Say thank you Rusty.
- Thank you Rusty.
-  You're gonna go up too Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
- Are you ready?
Yeah you're ready huh.
-  I think this one's
a little more adventurous.
-  Yeah, Finn is our brave one.
Whoa there you go dude!
- Whoa!
You ready to go?
Kick him.
Say let's go Rusty.
Let's go.
Say go Rusty.
(upbeat music)
- Alrightys.
Good boy Rusty.
- Yay!
Good job Finn.
How was that babe?
- It was fun.
My legs got a little
wobbly when I got off.
-  Yeah she kinda fell off.
- Yeah it was really fun.
I definitely have some muscle to build up.
Hi, did you have fun on him?
Say thank you Rusty.
(upbeat music)
All right I am back from the ranch.
And I had such a blast getting kind
of freshened up on everything.
I feel really good about the lesson.
I feel like I have a good understanding.
And I actually love
that she kinda taught me
some new stuff.
She's actually a English rider.
And I've always done Western.
And I feel like we were doing Western.
But as you can tell I've
kind of like picked up
a few English items.
For instance if you're
a horse person at all.
I was wearing English riding boots,
which I've never done.
Which were really
comfortable and pretty cute.
I was wearing and I still
am wearing these English
riding pants, which are so comfortable.
And I was even doing a lot of posting
while I was trotting,
which I have never done.
I've always just been like bouncing around
as a Western rider.
I've definitely learned some stuff.
And I was like wow this is really cool.
This is really fun.
I'm excited to even
learn more and continue.
I'll probably continue just
doing weekly lessons with her.
But I'll continue riding my
horse throughout that time.
'Cause I feel like I've
got a good handle on it.
It'll just be nice to continue lessons.
But these boys wanna go swimmin'.
Should we go in the hot tub?
-  Yeah.
- And boy do I need it.
I am so, so sore.
I stumbled a little as I got off the horse
and then I put Finn down
for a nap when I got home
and I stumbled off of
the bed and actually fell
and like heard both my ankles snap.
I think I'm still just super weak.
Even after riding hours ago
and I just totally like
rolled both my ankles.
They're not, I don't know
if I rolled them but,
it hurt.
And they still do hurt.
So I'm gonna go get in the hot tub
just to soak a little bit.
'Cause I'm sure I'm gonna be pretty sore
over the next few days.
All right, should we get in the hot tub?
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.
All right we are done swimming
and we had a great time.
We were just kinda sitting
in the hot tub hanging out
and no we are making a
little family dinner.
We are makin' breakfast for dinner.
- Eggs.
- Pancakes.
- Ready.
- Yeah!
- Those ones are ready.
- Those ones are ready.
We're makin' some sausage.
- Can I touch them?
- Sure.
-  How's it feel?
- I say it feels warm.
(giggling)
- All right let's
keep it warm.
- Keep it warm.
- We are actually all sit
down and eat some dinner
which we don't really do a lot.
We're gonna try and get back
into the habit of doing it.
I'm trying to really
fix that little habit.
And then I think me and
Bryan are actually headed to
Kelsey and Corbin's tonight.
We actually have some
leftover Christmas presents
from my parents.
And a birthday present for Corbin that
we never gave him.
So we're gonna go hang out
there and have some fun
and all that.
But these boys are gonna go to bed.
They already got their jammies on.
Hey dude, are you tiered?
- No.
(laughing)
-  Are you tired?
- Nope.
-  Finn loves the
sausage and eggs and pancakes.
Our kids are eatin' so good.
We're having like the best dinner ever.
- It's really good.
- I love pancakes for dinner, honestly.
It's one of my faves.
- Lay down.
-  Uh huh and then what do you do?
- I'm hungry.
I want me some food.
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
-  Is your foot
eating dinner for you?
- Yeah!
(laughing)
-  That is so funny dude.
- Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
- All right you guys
it's that time of night.
We are puttin' the boys to bed.
But I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

give it a big thumbs up.
Subscribe and we will see you manana.
