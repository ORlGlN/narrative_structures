so proud of him he's doing so good last
week he was like really crazy and kind
of disobedient and today he did really
good but now we are head comer I have a
tic-tac and I'm absolutely right to talk
well don't worry I'll spit it out in two
seconds I'm sure yeah I don't like the
end of the tic-tac I only like like the
beginning so everyone to Walmart
I need contacts okay here's the thing
guys she's a water thing um I have had
the same contact since I had my
appointment like I don't know months and
months and months ago they gave me a
prescription for contacts but I ordered
glasses instead so I was like oh I
really have backup glasses
I didn't order my contacts and so cuz I
don't really wear my glasses only wear
them like every once in a while and I
wish you want a little sexier oh thank
you I do not feel sexy I feel very just
it's just really hard for me to wear
glasses so anyways I think been wearing
the same contacts for a long time I'm so
bad I know guys you can lecture me all
you want but I'm just not very
responsible with my eyes with this part
I to away on a handicapped spot Oh check
it out guys I'm a pocket master yes I do
okay here we go
check it out oh so I'm finally going to
get contact so we'll see I try this
before and I failed so we'll see if we
actually get some this time it's
adventure time he loves this little tray
here we can just put snacks here and he
eat some come on we gotta make this a
quick trip quick adventure
man there is a kid screaming really
loudly he's being murdered clearly
something like that
which like oli don't ever do that don't
ever do that k oli
do you guys tell your kids that when you
see like another kid being really bad or
like screaming at a store all the time
really and maybe that's why you were a
polite kid I will never do that let me
know if you guys do that though cuz I
don't that's not bad right you like
iteration yeah slight manipulation
manipulating our kids to be good Holly
all I want for Christmas is you
get it cuz there's an owl right there oh
it's so witty Missy's at the Vision
Center you guys are curious why Missy
gets her contacts of all mites because
they have like optometrist here but
apparently it's gonna take a little bit
longer than expected which is basically
our life so she's got to do that all
he's crazy though so I'm gonna walk him
around he's really ready for his nap so
we gotta go wait comment drop him off at
his appointment and then take him home
for a nap behold we have stumbled upon
the Lego I really want to get a big Lego
set that I can put together I need to
put together that one that viewer sent
me to they still have a lot of lego
movie stuff I'm surprised that's cool
what do you think golly he seems very
observant to all the Lego stuff yeah
that cool it lights up that's cool huh
Holly are you tired
Holly baby are you sleeping yes my god
dirty that near is oh baby you had a
good swim huh
you guys I made out at Walmart would you
make out with that Walmart so she made
out with someone at Walmart you guys
yeah that's great baby out the idea and
how was he I wasn't a room it'll look
alone with him and the door was shut I
am NOT gonna be a part of the
conversation anyways um apparently I
didn't actually finalize my contact um a
point mare like my prescription so I had
to go in for like a really quick short
appointment
and so not only did I get fresh brand
new contacts in my eyeballs for the
appointment
free free he then upped my prescription
just like a little bit he's like I think
we should go a little higher so then he
gave me another free pair and then I
bought my box so I've got like got like
eight months in my hand right now worth
of contacts
I gotta can make this last eight years
oh my god I totally could I totally
would do no I'm not going to do that I'm
going to take them out he made me
promise and I I plan on keeping the
promise I don't know how Olly how good
of a snap all he's gonna get because
we're about to put karma right next yeah
karma get in the car with us
comecomecome like Connor where's your
leash and you ran over to it and grabbed
ha ha hi karma baby and look at all he's
still sleeping
he didn't wake up oli good job all right
karma its haircut time all this fur
chopping it off yeah so I'm headed into
Petco last time I got his haircut
actually did a like mobile one that come
to your house cuz he gets really
traumatized when he goes into these
places and he's there like all day but I
didn't feel like I did a good job so
this time I called Petco knows like hey
I really don't want Tim to be there all
day is there any way I can just you know
drop him off and then pick him up really
soon and she's like oh yeah we have this
zoom groom thing where you just drop him
off and he doesn't go into a kennel or
anything like that and he just gets his
hair cut and that's it so we're doing
today I think it'll be really nice I
mean easy for him and it won't be kind
of traumatizing and him sitting in a
kennel all day all right bye karma yummy
take the leash oh this up to you bye bye
karma mmm like Oh No
he's off because I was like a little
hesitant he like grabbed onto me started
hugging me Oh before I started vlogging
actually started doing I was like okay
karma we'll see how he does sometimes he
gets back and he's just like a mess and
you can tell that he just wasn't happy
there
all right so oli is taking a nap a good
little nap he actually slept for a long
time in the car and I was worried he
wouldn't lay down in his crib first rug
but um but when put on his grave he went
right to sleep slip like yay thank you
he will get a good nap and Missy ran to
Ulta cuz I think she had a really cool
coupon she wanted to take advantage of
and that she's just gonna pick up karma
afterwards but you guys know how I've
been sick and I can just I can't seem to
shake it
I don't know what the heck I'm I'm sick
it's like I'm sick for like three weeks
I really think I need to take more like
echinacea or like vitamin C or something
I'm just like the worst when it comes to
that but I have this really bad cough
and it's been giving me a horrible
headache so I picked up some of these
halls cough drops and they're helping a
lot they see is kind of opposed to like
being near me she actually told me that
I smell like her grandpa so there's that
but at least I'm not coughing up a storm
and getting a huge headache from it I
just killed a bunch of time at Ulta
while I waited for karma I got a few
cool things which I'm really excited
about actually um but Karma's done so
we're gonna go get him and hopefully
he's not nervous right I wasn't Carles
be the happiest boy I think he did so
good you guys and they even gave him
some treat and he's got a new little big
dam and it says Pisco on it where the
pets go huh his shave looks really
really good
very smooth karma you being walked by
olio you ripped it on his hands
give karma a walk okay get my good
walking around the house dharma holy go
come on
ah we just went on a little family walk
and because it's actually so nice
outside and it's about to get dark
but all you must have seen me walk
karma and now he's like imitating it so
funny
so last night I told you that I was
going to change the chalkboard and I
ended up getting the whole thing click
excuse me clean but I didn't actually do
any art until today so I've been working
on this for just like an hour too but
I'm finally done you guys want to see
what it looks like there it is guys so
if you look closely it actually says
thankful we have grown where we were
planted and it kind of has like this
forest rustic II like Thanksgiving feel
with the orange leaf and the pumpkin and
the vines and the Leafs and stuff I
totally just found this design on
Pinterest and like copied it basically
you can find a lot of really cool like
chalk art on Pinterest it was still
pretty tricky but I like how it turned
out and if you guys are curious sort of
like why and like the thought process
behind it basically comes from
Colossians 2:6 through 7 which says as
you therefore have received Christ Jesus
the Lord so walk in him rooted up and
built in him and established in the
faith as you've been taught abounding in
it with Thanksgiving so basically talks
about how we are thankful that we have
grown where we were planted you know in
Christ yeah what do you guys think of my
little chalk art let me know in the
comments below and if you guys want to
read more about Colossians 2 it
basically talks about not philosophy but
Christ it's pretty interesting I'll have
a link below in the description if you
guys want to learn more about that but
yeah pretty sighted kitchen is a must
today we got lots of stuff all scattered
around Missy's gonna shoot a video
tonight which will be up on her channel

my all-time favorite seasoning that I
