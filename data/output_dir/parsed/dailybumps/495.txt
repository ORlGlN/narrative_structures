have a very busy day in Canada today Oh

rehearsal for the much buffer festival
live concert with the whole band and
they're getting loaded up these are not

playing hide-and-seek
I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna tickle
you might tickle your do you pee your
pants good morning guys we are just
getting our day started Kelsey and
Corbin are getting ready to leave which
is so sad but I feel like I've been busy
and so is Brian in the past couple days
and actually passed in the weeks months
I don't know so I'm gonna take the kids
to Disneyland I think pretty sure it's
starting about it we're getting ready to
leave pretty soon here have a fun day
and just hang out so we are all ready
for dick man and Kelsey and Corbin are
all ready to leave um but before they
leave I have yet to actually see the
inside of the van so I first they're
like you can't go into it's dirty so we
never actually clean yeah we still dirty
so now I'm gonna get to see it even if
it's dirty and I'm so excited because
that we're opening the windows right now
that's how you do it okay all right so
I'm getting the full tour and it's
actually which they said is the first
time I went to this it's more roomy that
for me than I thought because I just
expected it to be like yeah looks like I
don't know it's definitely more roomy
plus I mean once you fill out this bed
is you definitely have like a nice bed I
think the hardest part would be this
bathroom I feel like I would get really
claustrophobic and sometimes you just
have to leave it open right you guys
really comfortable with you know someone
that would be the hardest I don't think
me and Brian would do well a little van
like this you could do it I'm sure we
could do it but we there might be a lot
of blood sweat and tears a lot of sweat
for sure and fast lately yeah I guess
hey Olli do you think we should live in
a van yeah should we all four of us with
Finn and Daddy all living here just here
but guess what there's no playroom so
there's no toys
you mean you could maybe bring like one
toy right one toys allowed you one
always only one that's I'm good but then
you have all the rocks and dirt and
sticks to play with so you can just go
play outside huh yeah oh he's like I'm
gonna definitely have to take my shirt
off in here is ha all right well that is
it Kelsey and Corbin and Paris he's
already in the car ready to go are
headed up and I'm gonna miss them so
much but it was such a fun trip and if
