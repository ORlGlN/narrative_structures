I'm gonna try and high-five this big
okay
look at how speaking to Pierre
did did you really they did hola bumpers
I don't know why I said hola so anyway
I'm actually headed to go pick up the
prints that I ordered for Missy's
Mother's Day video you guys sent us so
many awesome pictures and we're gonna do
our best to include everyone I think I
found a way where I can actually include
every single photo that anyone ever sent
to us so that should be really really
awesome
Missy finished what she wanted to say
last night she wrote it all down I
walked out the house this morning and
I'm kind of bummed because it's not that
great looking outside I mean it's not
warm it's it's cool it's kind of windy
but it's a little dark our week is so
jam-packed
it's insane so I'm really hoping that we
can film this today because any other
day it's just gonna be crazy hectic so I
just picked up all the photos and I'm
just so grateful that you guys did this
cuz seriously without you this video
would not be what it's going to be so I
got the photos tell me if you recognize
any of these people
maybe these are you people you know oh
there's somebody and it actually looks
like the Sun is coming out so it's like
getting brighter so that's good
Missy's trying to find an outfit for the
video and look at this even if she pulls
up like that she cannot is so funny babe
dang how's your thing done it's still
red hey guys so I'm getting ready to go
film our Mother's Day video which is
supposed to be super super special I'm
really excited to see how it turns out
but one of my special videos oh my gosh
this morning I've now
with this intense pain right in my left
rib which is where he hangs out he only
kicks on the left side of my ribs -
right only kicks on the left side of my
ribs he like pushes on my ribs and like
it's not that painful but now my ribs
are bruised - like literally bruised
like I can't touch them like to move a
certain way I'm like oh my gosh is he
going I'm only 26 weeks dies like I've
got a long ways to go he could end up
like breaking them or fracturing them
I'm so scared I could not find an outfit
for today I brought a couple just in
case I just can't I just have to put one
on but they just one are not fitting me
right they're not like flattering to me
anymore
probably because I'm pregnant I think
we're gonna go out and try and look for
something it's really really fast
I think excuse to go shopping right yet
too much I've been trying high five
we are in mrs. favorite store haven't
walked in your pork I think so actually
yeah that's cool I think oh that's cool
well I think it ties him up back here
locked out that's cool again this is a
quick part where Misty's trying on
clothes and I don't know what to do with
myself so we were just headed now to the
location Missy's got her outfit all
picked out and oh look I know in front
of us that actually happens a lot in
California it's weird but you see lots
of my data license plates and for a long
time we had a head of the license plates
because we were lazy bringing us full of
skunks okay so I'm gonna show you you
like I'm like chewing on his fur ended
up getting but I'm sitting but I ended
up getting that first shirt that you
guys probably saw me wearing and I just
tried to fit it better so that it like
it's more flattering and everything and
of course my hair goes over so that it's
not too like revealing I guess I got
this accessory for my hair that matches
it's just kind of like a band that goes
around have this bracelet hang on that
says love so that's my outfit and I just
I'm actually just wearing my pants in my
shoes can't believe how difficult it is
to find clothes now that you're pregnant
now that I'm pregnant it's just like
it's so much more difficult that you
feel so like this we are filming now and
we're probably not gonna vlog a whole
lot just because we really need to
concentrate on this and I don't know how
much time we're actually gonna have out
here so I'll see you in a little bit so
we just got done filming our video I
hope it turns out good it's like
freezing it was so in
miserable and starving and right where
are you doing
you'll see hang on but I did my gosh B
plus M equals o oh my gosh cute
what are you doing that with a thumbtack
it really hurts my hand not cool that
yeah I know how long it'll be there for
fun it very long it's not very deep no
see looking everyone else puts their
carvings in the tree so that way EEP
plus cats equals life huh
this person's forever alone oh they're
pointing down to them all because they
love cats so as you can see this is
where we did shoot and it went really
well
I went through my shot list to make sure
I got everything and we're really
excited so now that all that's left for
this video is Missy's gonna record her
narration and then I just need to edit
edit edit edit this is so nice over here
babe
but I mean look at my feet they're
covered in stickers baby snake okay we
did not know what it was it was like
maybe four or five inches long and it
looks like a worm almost like it wasn't
thick and it was like wiggling a lot
like laughing yeah like it kept going
like touching tale to end and it jumped
on Missy and then she kicked it off and
freaked out and you're like in the
middle of filming and I was like that
wasn't the effect we were going for I
wonder what that was though do you think
it could have been a snake we're like a
worm if it's a baby they're usually in
nests and there was no other yeah that's
true do you notice how still it is now
there's like no wind and we were
seriously fighting the wind because we
had to wait oh oh hang on okay this is
how professional photographers do it by
the way they scratch their nose with
their tripod
yeah we were fighting the wind and now
it's literally like still there's not
wind at all there's this huge
grasshopper here I'm not even kidding
you guys it's humongo I've never seen
one that big we're trying to do min so
you can see it Oh
Darius do you see him you guys oh my god
he looks scary looking oh he's about to
jump
oh my gosh look at him whoa there he
goes Dipsy that was like the biggest
grasshopper I've ever seen we always
seem like bunnies and oh we saw a fox
here once and a skunk yeah that was like
toward the end and yeah there's
rattlesnakes there's always the signs
about rattlesnakes I just pulled all
those out of my shoes and it feels so
much better still some in I think we got
an overwhelming response when we asked
for the pictures for the Mother's Day
video I honestly wasn't expecting
something response oh I guess I should
have expected any photos you think the
actual 300 we got over 300 photos so
it's really just impossible to print
that many photos and do what we were
trying to do in the video unfortunately
not every picture was able to be printed
but we are trying to find a way well we
did find a way to incorporate the
pictures into the video so we're hoping
that we were that we are able to grab
every single photo if you're not in
there it might just got kind of lost but
we were I mean we've looked at every
photo we've opened up every email like
all the emails were so cool people like
just sort of telling us their stories
and showing off their kids it was really
really cool to see it go through it was
just like it would be impossible for us
to reply to all them too but yeah we do
want to thank everyone for participating
and emailing us because it was insane it
was so much fun reading yeah
we would want to do that again we really
just hope you love the video look on
guacamole put on here I barely put any I
just covered it Brian made us
chimichangas so what they're called
mm-hmm yeah you're pretty good you guys
don't get to see this dog very often but
it's my my mom's dog actually Leo here
command the gun he did I actually
adopted it right when me and Brian got
married
he's like the kind of dog that attached
himself to someone and he just sended up
sleeping with my mom and then my mom
take care of em blah blah so anyways
he's now my mom's little baby he's been
really sick for the past couple weeks
he's been really like throwing up and
just really really sick and so he's been
at the vet all day today and he now has
a little cast cuz they were doing IVs in
him all day and he'll be going back
tomorrow for more IVs but I think he's
doing better now haul wheel he was
actually short for king leonidas yes we
named him unite very mighty yes he still
is he thinks he's a little thinks he's
the king of the house huh okay so right
now missing tonight we're trying to
record the narration for her Mother's
Day video and I'm telling her I was like
your voice sounds too peppy you need to
make it sound a little deeper like this
is how I talk this is how I talk this is
how I talk like you can make your voice
deeper but if I don't think Missy has
that ability try it you're just like
making it slower I don't know pitch it's
all about pitch miss we're finished yay
it was a little emotional there are you
okay babe yeah okay okay just know that
a lot went into this video

watching it huh yeah so grab a box of
tissues when you guys watch this on
