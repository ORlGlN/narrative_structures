- Good morning guys and
welcome to today's video.
Today we are going on a
little family adventure
and Missy and I have something that we are
very excited to share with you guys,
a very big project that
we've been working on
for almost over a year now.
We're gonna reveal to
you guys in this vlog.
So be sure to click that thumbs up button
if you guys are excited
to learn what that is
but for right now we
are headed to the barn
and Missy's gonna throw me on a horse
and we're gonna trail ride for
just like 20 or 30 minutes.
(Finn babbling)
Good morning Finn.
You excited to go to the barn?
- Yeah.
- Daddy.
-  Good morning dude.
Ollie who's in our car with us?
- Karma.
- That's right.
Karma is headed to the barn with us.
Hi Karma boy.
He's like I don't know what I was doing
but yeah mom put me in the car.
Guess I'm going somewhere.
- You're funny.
-  Wow. (laughs)
(Finn babbling)
Yours don't light up?
Aw, we'll have to get you
some cool light up ones
okay buddy?
(upbeat music)
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Hey babe.
Beautiful day at the barn.
- It's so nice, it has not
been this nice in like a week.
(Bryan laughs)
I'm so excited to ride.
-  Hey babe, why do
you have a bowl of oatmeal?
- Well I needed some food
but also Natcha loves it
when I eat oatmeal 'cause
he gets a bite. (laughs)
And he thinks it's delicious.
-  You're a crazy horse lady.
- I know.
- You know that right?
Alright this is Rusty.
We got him all saddled up.
We got his headstall on.
Is it headstall?
- Yes.
- Headstall.
He's wearing a headstall.
Say hi, say hi to the
internet Rusty. (laughs)
I'm gonna hope on this guy.
- Look at us we're riding, how fun.
I love watching Bryan ride
and I love riding with Bryan.
He's definitely still
trying to get comfortable.
So he's on Rusty who's a very good horse.
He's safe safe safe.
He's probably boring. (laughing)
Like he's not gonna do anything
unless you really really
really want him to.
So he's just kinda getting
used to sitting on a saddle.
We're gonna walk over and see the boys.
Hi Ollie!
- Hi.
- Are you playing?
-  They're trying to
get the tractor beam from me.
-  (laughs) They're
having a fun time over there.
(upbeat music)
- Passed out.
Passed out.
Alright now that the boys are passed out,
we are headed somewhere really really cool
and we have something to tell you guys
and show you guys at the same time.
So get excited.
Like I said this has been something
that we've been working
on for over a year now
trying to make this happen
and it's finally happening.
It's cool, it's kinda like
one of those surreal things.
I think it's like one of those things
you actually have an idea and you work on
for a really long time and
you're like this is never
gonna happen, like you
just keep working at it.
But this something's
actually happening now guys.
- It's moving along.
- It's moving along, (laughs)
I'm very very excited.
Oh hey Finn.
- Hey.
-  You want to see
what we're working on?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, he's
like yeah after I am done
digging in this bread. (chuckles)
Hey Ollie you want to see
what we've been working on?
- Yeah.
- Alright, shut the door.
Let's go.
(uplifting music)
Alright are you guys ready to see (laughs)
this is kind of crazy.
I don't even know if any of
you guys are expecting this
at all but Missy and I bought a building.
Look how giant this place is.
And it's ours babe.
Like this is where dreams are
gonna happen and come true.
- There's some major dreams that need
to come true in this building.
- Yeah. (laughs)
So right now we have kind
of just an empty shell.
There's a little bit of stuff being put up
but it's all being demoed.
This is all actually going down tomorrow
and then we're gonna start demolition.
And Papa was in here
(chuckles) and he just like
had to make a big old pile.
He's like I gotta do something. (laughs)
But this is really
exciting because we have
a building now where we can start doing
a lot more of our projects.
First and foremost, this is
going to be a music studio.
So we are actually starting
construction this month
and we are building a whole other building
inside of this building.
- This is going to be--
- It will never look
like this again. (laughs)
- It's gonna be the coolest thing.
I mean, we're definitely
gonna make a cool studio
but it's also gonna be
just an awesome space
to do a lot of really fun projects
that we have planned for the year.
- Yeah that's right.
I want it to be kind
of like a headquarters.
We're gonna have office here.
We're gonna be able to film videos here.
We're gonna be able to record
podcasts, record music.
I think it's gonna be a
really cool creative space.
- So this is like such a crazy
thing for me and Bryan to do.
Basically we're starting a new business.
Continuing on kind of off
of what Daily Bumps is
but there's so much more
that we want to do with
just ourselves and plans and aspirations
that we want to be able to acquire.
- And there's also like new
things we want to start also
and we're very restricted in our house.
We have an amazing house
and it's great for living
and our family and filming and stuff
but to get to that next level
we need to have something else.
And you know how you always
wanted one more bathroom.
-  (laughs) Yes I
always needed just one more.
No lights. (laughing)
There you go, there's the bathroom.
- So if I ever really needed
a private place to potty.
- (laughing) There you go.
But yeah, I'm just so
excited because like for us
we just really want to be
able to reach out even farther
with what we're doing in our lives
and I'm excited for this building
because I feel like it's
gonna be a great place
for us to come up with ideas, and create
and make music and have
fun and play, huh? (laughs)
This is so exciting.
- Yeah, I mean this is
like a huge dream of mine.
You guys know I love working on music.
I've been writing a bunch of new music.
I want to work with a lot
of different musicians.
This is gonna be a really
cool place to do that.
It's gonna be a place
where other musicians
can come and work too,
which is kinda cool.
- I just wonder how well
you're gonna be able
to make music with this echo. (laughs)
- This is seriously never
ever gonna look like this.
-  Yeah, this is like a nutshell.
- When you walk into what
we are going to build,
it's going to look completely different.
- Oh yeah, we have it already all planned
and what it's gonna look like
and this whole place is just like,
there's gonna be walls, there's
gonna be whole new stuffs.
So it's gonna be cool.
- Let's go look behind now.
-  Okay, everything
is a mess right now too.
- So right now the building is equipped
with like a reception and office area.
And we're gonna keep this in the design
but we're tearing all this out
because we need a new
roof 'cause we're also
gonna do a cool little
loft space up there.
So Papa was here and he decided
to break the ceiling out.
So it's kinda gonna be like this
but it's gonna be different.
-  So this is the reception.
- And then there's an
office that goes in here.
and it's pretty big.
Like every other building
we were looking at
was pretty massive and I
thought I needed something big
but then when I saw like a small building
I'm like this could definitely work.
I could have a lot of cool stuff in here.
- Yeah, it's just nice
because you got this space
for like other things
than just the studio.
Like an office and stuff
like that but it's not huge.
- Yeah, so over here we're
gonna have a spiral staircase
and all that's gonna be loft area,
and then this is gonna be a lounge.
-  This is all lounge.
- And the studio kinda starts here and.
- Moves on.
- It's pretty cool.
The design is really cool.
It's gonna be fun updating you
guys on how it's all going.
It's supposed to happen pretty fast.
- We'll see, they always
say we can get this done
in a couple months and who
knows how long it'll take
but it's just gonna be so fun
to be able to take you along
with us and see the process
of it going from this
to something hopefully really cool.
- I wanna make a new album
and I wanna do more music
with the kids and with you
guys and I wanna do a podcast
with you and I just have so
many different thing in mind.
- And that's the thing,
is there's so many things
that we can do but this is
also gonna be a business.
We're starting a business
so, it's pretty huge.
(upbeat music)
-  So Papa heard we here
and not tearing things down
so he showed up.
We got some tools, we got a sledgehammer.
Think we're gonna create
some destruction Ollie.
-  You think you
can tear down some walls?
- No.
-  Could you even
pick that sledge hammer up?
Try to pick it up.
Oh, wow!
Just watch your feet when you
put it down okay. (laughing)
- That's Aquaman.
- Yeah.
-  Ah, there a hammer
you could pick up huh?
- Yeah.
-  You already did it.
- Be careful.
- You ready to tear down
some walls?
Not the floor baby,
not the floor. (laughs)
-  Keep the floor,
we want to keep the floor.
(Missy laughing)
-  Papa will tell you
what you could hit, okay?
Ollie, you're about to
hit that hammer so hard,
you're gonna put a hole in the wall.
You've never been allowed
to do that before huh?
- No.
(Missy laughs)
-  Are you excited?
- I'm so up for it.
- You want to see?
- Yeah.
- Come over here.
You ready Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Like that.
-  I'm so sacred.
Could you just do it low? (laughs)
Wait, that looks like a 2x4 though.
Oh my gosh.
(Missy shrieks)
Oh wow.
- This is how you get things done people.
(Missy laughs)
-  Aw yeah, check it out.
Made some damage you guys. (chuckles)
-  Tear down the wall.
-  That's so cool.
Alright hit.
There you go. (laughs)
- There you go.
- Alright.
- Right here, ready?
- Nice.
(Missy screams lightly)
- You got it.
- Is it stuck in the wall?
- Yeah.
- What?
-  You can't do
this at home Ollie, okay?
(laughs)
-  We're tearing
this place down aren't we?
(Bryan chuckles)
Oh it's stuck.
-  Woo!
- Woo hoo.
- Whoa.
-  That definitely worked huh?
(Missy screams)
-  I'm coming through!
-  No. (screams)
What do you think of that Finn?
(laughing)
- Daddy's here!
-  My God, that's so scary.
(laughing)
- Oh they have some nails in the wall.
I should really hammer those in more huh?
(Missy screams)
-  Sorry, sorry babe.
Alright there you go.
- Oh you got it. (laughs)
Alright I think the
nail's in, you're good.
- I think the nail's in.
Is the nail in Ollie?
-  No, I think it fell down here.
- Oh did it? (laughs)
- I think it's
on the other side.
(upbeat music)
Go for it babe.
Yeah.
The whole thing is shaking.
Let's go!
- Oh God.
(laughing)
I don't want to be in there.
-  Look at this hole babe.
Isn't that awesome?
Ollie, Finn look at the walls
are full of cotton candy.
Isn't that cool?
Don't touch it, oh don't touch it.
It's not real cotton candy.
It's just insulation.
- Oh.
(upbeat music)
-  Whoa, you guys
something's breaking in!
Something's breaking in!
What do you think it is?
You think it's a dinosaur?
- I think so. (gasps)
Hey look!
-  Ah, they're getting in. (laughs)
Hello.
- Hello.
-  It's just mama.
(hammer thuds)
Whoa!
You getting a workout?
- Yeah, I'm really gonna be sore.
(Bryan laughs)
-  So Papa has been
a huge help on this project.
He's kinda been a second
me when it comes to this
because it's a lot of work.
Construction starts this month.
- That's right, it does yeah.
- Ain't that crazy?
- Very soon we gotta
have all this down by the 13th.
- Yeah. (laughs)
So yes, this our next project
we are very very excited for.
We hope you guys are too and
we're gonna bring you along
for the whole journey because
we've never done this before.
Huh?
- Yeah I've never
done anything like this.
(Bryan laughs)
Ollie's teaching me how to demo.
How do you do it?
- You just do it like that.
-  Oh I see.
-  So it's like.
-  You could actually
rip this whole thing out.
Watch out dude.
Whoa.
-  Just like that?
-  Yeah.
-  Cool.
-  And then you hit it.
Look at all that cotton candy.
- It's not cotton candy.
- I know, don't eat it. (laughs)
(upbeat music)
Don't mind us, just hanging out
in the forest with my boys, huh? (laughs)
Did you guys have a good day today?
(boys whining)
Oh yeah, mama's ready to read you books
