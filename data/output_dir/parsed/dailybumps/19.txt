- Good morning guys!
Today, we are taking the
kids to Uptown Jungle.
It's like this amazing indoor fun park.
We are on a mission to tire them out.
Let's go inside.
This place is huge.
So cool.
There you go dude.
Whoa, you can keep climbing up.
(upbeat music)
Finn was already exhausted
because he did not get a nap today.
So after this, I think he is
definitely gonna be tired, right?
- Oh my god, he's so tired now, he's like.
(Bryan laughs)
-  What do you think of this place?
- I'm gonna go up this side.
- Okay.
I just did a ten minute
massage in one of these things.
It was amazing!
(upbeat music)
- All right boys, we are exploring
the top half of this urban jungle
and I gotta say this is really cool.
Go Finn, go!
Go Finn, go!
Go Finn, go!
Woo!
All right, Finn is on a
wrecking ball right now.
You ready?
-  Yeah!
-  Woo!
Was that fun?
- Yeah.
-  Again?
Woo!
Oh gosh.
It's a rolling log.
It's a rolling log.
Don't roll it Ollie.
Don't roll it Ollie.
Ollie, can you walk on that?
-  Yeah.
-  Do it.
Whoa.
You're doing it.
(upbeat music)
Check this out.
What?
It's a giant obstacle course.
Go, go, go!
You did it in like one second!
-  Awesome.
-  Woo!
Oh, looks like they're racing now.
Go Finnie, go!
Go Finnie, go!
Oh look it, you're winning.
You're winning.
Finn, where are you?
There he is, there he is.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Get in there!
-  Hi there.
-  Hi!
He's so cute.
Woo!
Go, go, go!
Woo!
Yay, you did it!
High five.
(upbeat music)
Ollie is about to try rock climbing.
You think you can get up to the top Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
(upbeat music)
-  You can use the
other side too, 'kay buddy?
(upbeat music)
He's going on this one now.
Whoa.
He definitely loves climbing.
He's gotten lots of practice
with Finn in the backyard.
-  Go Ollie, go!
-  You got it dude!
Woo!
That's an interesting way.
-  Step up, there you go.
-  There you go.
Nice.
He's gotten good at that.
-  That one's a little harder, huh?
-  Oh my gosh, it's crazy.
Look at him go.
-  Good job, bud.
(upbeat music)
-  Ollie, now Finn's gonna do it.
You inspired him 'cause you did so good.
- I wanna do that.
-  Oh, that's cool.
Finn, are you excited?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
You wanna do that one?
Missy, is our two year old
seriously about to do this?
- He's gonna do it.
I bet he can get to the top.
- You can do it Finn!
-  Go Finn, go.
-  Oh, (laughs) he can't reach.
Oh there you go.
Woo!
Wow!
Look at that muscle (laughs).
Woo hoo.
There you go.
Push.
Oh, nice.
That looked like fun, huh?
- Yeah, good job dude.
-  All right, he's
going for this one now.
-  He is so little.
-  I know.
He's like really trying to make it work.
There you go.
Maybe you should start on the
left cause it's the lowest.
(upbeat music)
Go Finn!
Ollie, you know you have the
coolest little brother ever?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
He's so cool, he's
always up for adventure.
Finn look at this giant piano.
That's pretty cool.
(upbeat music)
- I turned it on dad.
-  That's so cool.
You push the button and it goes?
- Dad, you can also spin on the ground.
-  Oh, really, you wanna spin?
- Yeah.
-  All right, sit down.
There you go.
Finn, you want to spin with your brother?
- Yeah!
- Come here, hurry!
Come on in.
This is like the Teacups
ride at Disneyland, huh?
- Yeah.
-  All right, you ready?
And, go!
- Excuse me, okay, that's enough.
-  (laughs) Was that fun boys?
- Yeah.
- Whoa.
-  Oh no, we got a momfalo.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Am I scary?
I'm just kidding.
-  He's like yeah,
that's actually a little scary.
(peppy music)
- That's my cookie.
-  Your what, oh, your cookie?
- Yeah.
-  Is that your cookie?
- Yeah.
-  I think that's
my cookie actually.
- No, my cookie.
-  No, I think it's my cookie.
- No, my cookie.
- Such a stinker.
- I know.
All right, the boys are all ready for bed
and I thought since you guys got so much
physical energy today.
You got all your energy out.
Why don't we get some
energy out in your brains
and do a little matching game?
- Yeah, we love this game.
- So this is Seek a Boo
and Finn has been wanting to
play this for so long, huh?
- That's my cookie.
- And this is your cookie.
- No, mine.
- We're gonna put it right there.
Don't touch it.
- Hey, that looks like my bike.
- What's that?
- That looks like my bike.
- What is that Finn?
- That's my bike.
-  Is it your bike?
I think that's Finn's bike, huh Ollie?
- Okay, we're gonna put
the bike right there, okay?
- Your bike's right there, okay?
- See the drums?
Okay, we're gonna put
the drums right there.
- Finn's a wee bit tired.
- Now Finn, where's the bike?
-  Do you know where the bike is?
-  Wow.
-  Good job.
- Good job Finn.
Okay, it's Ollie's turn.
Ollie, where is the ball?
(cat meows)
- Good job.
So you guys get to hold on to your ball.
Here, I'll hold on to this one
and you can hold on to the bike, okay?
-  Good job guys.
- Finn, where is the teddy bear?
Remember?
Oh, no, that's the drums.
Now let Ollie look, okay?
Sit next to Ollie,
-  Ollie, do you know
where the teddy bear is?
- Yeah.
-  Do you remember?
Oh.
No, no, no Ollie.
- One at a time.
Where is the teddy bear?
Which one is it?
No.
That's Ollie's turn.
-  Ollie.
- Where is the teddy bear, yay!
Okay you get to hold the teddy bear.
Where is the blocks?
-  Oh, do you remember Finn?
Yay!
- Yay!
All right, you each got three.
It's a tie.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
-  Good job boys.
Hey Finn, is your brain gettin sore yet?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
That's quite a brain workout.
- Okay, Ollie.
The orange triangle.
Where's the orange triangle going?
Right there?
The yellow diamond.
Where's the yellow diamond go?
- Yeah.
- There you go (laughs).
They're so cute in
their Star Wars pajamas.
Oh, I actually showed them something
I just got for my office.
Okay, so it's like this
really really comfy blanket
and looks who's on it.
Darth Vader!
Ollie saw it after I
turned it the right way
and he was so excited.
He was like "That's Darth Vader!"
Oh hey, Karma.
Oh hey, Luna.
Aww.
She's like "I missed you.
"You were gone so long."
(Bryan laughs)
Karma's like, "Stop it.
"You're embarrassing
me in front of Bryan."
(upbeat music)
I wonder where it is.
Finn, do you know where it is?
- What is that one?
-  Orange triangle!
- Karma, Luna, go!
All right, we are snuggling into bed
and these boys are just so cute.
Did you have such a fun day today?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
- Daddy's home.
-  Daddy's home?
- Yeah.
- That's good, he loves saying
like everyone who's home.
He's like "Mama, home, me, home."
It's so cute.
We are getting ready for bed
and I just have to give you
guys a quick little update
on their sleeping.
They've been really good from the start,
but there have been days that
it's been a little harder.
And just transitioning from
Finn being able to just leave
the bed anytime he wants.
But just the fact that
they have each other.
As long as you guys have each
other, you guys are good, huh?
- Yeah.
- But mornings have been a little harder
and so I told you guys the other day
that I bought this little owl
and when the light in the eyes are.
- Green.
-  Green, it means
you can get out of bed, huh?
- Yeah.
-  And you, follow
those rules really well, huh?
- Yeah.
- This one, not so much.
He's like "I don't care
what color those eyes are.
"If I'm awake, I'm
getting out of this bed."
But we're practicing and
continuing to enforce the rule.
Like if he does come to the
bed before the eyes are green,
I make him come back into
the room until it's green.
'Cause sometimes, he likes
to come in my room at five am
and that is just not okay.
This has actually been
really, really cool.
Super helpful for like Ollie
knowing when to get up, huh?
- Yeah.
- We were going off the sun and I was like
the sun comes up pretty early.
Maybe we should go with
a different method.
And then something else
my dad actually installed,
just for safety 'cause it has
always worried me a little bit
that Finn is up so high and they roll
all over this bed all night long.
My dad installed this
cool little sliding door.
It's not quite what he
wants as a finished product,
but it just slides over
so he can't fall out.
He wants a little bit higher I think.
I think I want it a little bit higher too,
but it's pretty cool.
It just slides.
It's got a little glide for it
and it just closes and opens, huh?
- Yeah.
- But anyways, we are gonna
go ahead and go to bed
'cause these boys are done, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Done, done?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up.
Big thumbs up!
And let us know in the comments
what is your favorite place
to have tons of fun and
get all your energy out.
Let us know down in the comments
and maybe we'll end up visiting one day.
We'll see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
-  Bye!
-  Boop.
