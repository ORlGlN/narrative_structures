oh okay
notes but no like oh my god karma
Oh
some of those okay this is our son baby
boy he's gonna do amazing things
good morning guys um we're Wow whenever
I say good morning you just like did
like a jumping thankfully that's
actually always drop that don't only
sleep so good morning um we are up and
about I've got lots to do today how come
we gotta do today what are you gonna do
today mr. ollie pants you need to sit
right here and chill out you have a good
day huh you slept in today huh oh you're
gonna learn how to flip out of this
thing now that I have straps on now cuz
he is just getting so big yeah you do
pit oh yeah Carbonite enjoy either back
away from all a toys back away from all
these toys good morning guys today is
actually Friday the 13th and you know
what that means
so here's the thing about Friday the
13th okay first of all there's no
written history or anything the states
that Friday the 13th should be like an
unlucky day essentially the number 13 is
known to be like an unlucky number and
Friday is known to be an unlucky day so
when it occurs together then I guess
everyone likes to freak out and say that
it's an unlucky day but here here's a
little front of the 13th philosophy for
you guys I think that on Friday the 13th
if you are so destined to have a bad day
or if you're so destined to know that
something bad is going to happen to you
because it's Friday the 13th then it's
gonna happen
it's going to happen to you because
you're going to be looking for it
whereas if you have a positive outlook
on Friday the 13th and you're like look
by the 13th it's just a number it's just
a day nothing bad is gonna happen
then nothing bad is probably gonna
happen because you be so focused on that
idea that something good is going to
happen and I think that's a really good
like philosophy of life if you're always
looking for something to happen that's
bad to you then it's going to happen to
you and if you're always looking for
good things or if you you're a positive
person and you think positively good
things are going to happen to you and I
think that's how Missy and I try and
live our lives is always always thinking
positive and stuff oh we're at a red
light so I'm gonna show you Oliver
I took Oliver today to run some errands
with Daddy Hey hey buddy you having fun
with your flower
he literally hasn't even made a peep yet
hey yesterday you my mom were shopping
and we got this little bow and just
loved it it's so cute I got it from
icing and I just think it's so cute I
think I need to definitely get some more
like bows to like clip in my hair
because I I normally just I don't do
anything fancy with my hair I just
straighten it do it and be done with it
if I start getting like little things
like that but I could do some cute
things like even like some little clips
oh no I just never really like to spend
the money on buying stuff like that or
like doing stuff like that cuz just
boring and I don't like straight my hair
go he was being extra fussy in and
crying and stuff so I decided I'm gonna
give him a spin around in the car while
I go and do some errands too and I got
you on my phone thing so I know it's not
like the best angle of me Hey are you
chewing on Winnie the Pooh he really
likes this Winnie the Pooh thing that
vibrates huh you like it
it's perfect for teething and don't tell
him but we actually got some teething
things for him for Christmas you didn't
hear anything what hi hi are you bored
with me you wish mommy was here oh I see
got yourself while we were driving there
just a little bit right laundry is done
and now I gotta head in all of Oliver's
room because he's just got so many
clothes I can't even fit his clean
clothes into its dresser anymore um
because I pretty much haven't just gone
through and got rid of like his zero to
three months clothes now he's
only in three to six and some times even
six I don't know if it's six to nine or
just like six months
um yeah he's just getting so good and I
do not have room for all these clothes
so I need to start putting them away so
that next time we have another little
boy if we do then he can start wearing
all his clothes again paper go through
these so that I have room so this is
essentially what it would be like if I
was a single parent I guess huh oh
it's not very fun
I wish Missy was here actually but we're
just gonna run a few errands and get
some stuff done and give her a little
big little break look at that I've
cleaned a whole lot of his clothes and I
I feel so sad getting rid of these
clothes I like love so much like like
his sock monkey pajamas he just does not
fit knees anymore they're too small and
I put him in there it looks like I'm
trying to stuff a sausage into like a
very small item um but yeah I'm gonna
miss these little baby clothes look at
this captain adorable monkey he's gonna
make me to bid okay okay back off back
up back up back up picking up a couple
things from the grocery store and I knew
if I just walked around a little this
what happened you felt right asleep and
we're gonna make some turkey sandwiches
for lunch so I'm gonna grab some chips
Missy likes these pop chips start coming
on in now I think she likes these ones
they're too perfect this is happening
ooh look at all these sweets oh my gosh
look at this tres leche
good boy Oh he doesn't even care ah
these cakes always look so good but
we've never tried them this he's not a
sheet cake person I'll lead ain't kind
cake not even camera yeah but all these
clothes are just way too small for him
now so I have to move on I have to find
cuter cook Karma you can't just sit on
his clothes I had to find cuter clothes
that he fits in now and stops trying to
stuff amid the little baby clothes that
he doesn't fit in I just want to say mad
props to all use single parents out
there who watch us let me know in the
comments but seriously like I mean he
slept the entire time you know he wasn't
dude come on you're not you're not old
enough to gamble he slept the entire
time but just I added inconvenience of
like having to push the stroller and I'm
making making sure like not to wake him
like while you're doing shopping it's
like you want to think it's a big of a
deal but it it really is I gotta say
it's nice having Missy around because
we're like a little team you know like a
panting team all right I'm gonna get you
in the car put it and voila still asleep
oh yeah successful single Patti time I
don't know if you guys have seen my new
video about all these toes and what
happened to them basically my hair had
got wrapped around his toes and we
didn't notice it luckily it wasn't too
