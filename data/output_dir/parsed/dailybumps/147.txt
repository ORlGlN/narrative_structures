- I love you!
Welcome to the wall!
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life, let's live it
♫ Live it forever
(island music)
- Good morning, guys.
Missy and I are just wakin' up.
We're not too far from the boys.
We're just in Costa Mesa
because we were here
for the Jon Bellion concert,
so if you guys didn't see
all that fun stuff on
our Instagram stories,
definitely be sure to go check
that out as quick as you can.
Right now, we are just
looking out of our window,
and it's right on the bay where
all these huge yachts are.
These people are scrubbing
'em, getting 'em clean.
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.
- It's like, so annoying
washing our car, can you
imagine having to wash a yacht?
- I know, they're all
literally washing their boats.
-  They're washing a small house.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's so cool.
- It's actually kind of cool to see
a different side of life
that these people do.
- Maybe one day we'll be able to rent one,
and go a trip with the whole family
or something.
- That would be crazy.
- That'd be cool, or a
cruise would be cool, too.
But, yeah, it's so beautiful right now.
It's so foggy, isn't that crazy?
Yesterday was beautiful and hot and sunny,
and today it's foggy.
So, we're gonna go grab some breakfast
and then we're meetin' up with the boys.
It's a pretty windy road.
We had to pull over.
Aww, I feel bad.
Usually, I'm the one getting car sick
but because I'm driving,
I feel like I'm not.
And she is, and I feel so bad.
We're so close to being home, too.
Probably 30 more minutes.
(slow guitar music)
You okay, babe?
(coughing)
- Uhh, I'm okay.
I'm just (mumbles).
(sorrowful laughing)
-  Are you car sick
or are you having morning sickness?
Is there something you're
not telling me? (laughs)
- Nope, just car sick. (clears throat)
So gross.
- Awww, usually it's me, babe.
Seriously, usually it's
me getting car sick,
but I think it's 'cause
I'm driving, you know?
(laughing)
- Ugh.
-  I used to get car
sick all the time in Idaho
when we had to drive those mountains.
This isn't that bad, it's just like
a little windy road, but--
- (clears throat) Don't love that.
Sorry, babe.
-  Ahhhh, hi!
-  Hey kiddos!
-  Did you have
fun with Meme and Papa?
-  Hi, Finn!
-  Finn's, like, shy.
- Hi.
- I missed you.
- Can you bring me a snack?
-  Aww, we just got
home and you're already askin'
for snacks?
- Mwah, I missed you.
-  Mom?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  I know, you missed her.
- Mwah.
I missed you, too.
-  He missed your glasses, too.
- Thank you.
(laughing)
- He was just wanderin'
around going, "Where's Mom?"
All morning long.
- His mama. Mama.
Mwah, I love you.
-  What are you doing, Ollie?
- Playing this game.
-  Playing with magnets?
- Yeah.
-  That's so cool.
- We're making a little story.
That's the little boy, and that's--
-  Who's that?
-  We made that the mom.
- Yeah, and this is dad.
- That's the dad?
- Yeah.
- And they have a unicorn pet,
and a rubber duckie.
And the boy is a giant yo-yo enthusiast.
-  The mom needs her prince...
Her little wand.
- Oh, she's a...
- Like a princess.
- Cool.
- We need another toy.
(laughing)
- Okay yeah,
we need more toys.
-  Do you know
why it's sticking, Ollie?
- Why?
-  Because of magnets,
and watch when you push this button.
Boop! They all fall off!
- Ohhh, I don't want them--
- Oh, sorry. (laughs)
Yeah, you can do another story.
Oh, you can change the scenes even.
That is so cool.
The board demagnetizes
when he pushes the button,
so you can start over.
Now, you got like a little park.
- I think the rubber duckie should be
in the little--
(laughing)
(gentle guitar music)
(playful, mischievous music)
- Na na na na na na na na Batman!
- Ba ba ba
- Batman!
(playful, mischievous music)
- Oh, ma ma ma, oh eh.
- Huh, huh, huh.
I love you!
You're beautiful mama!
(playful, mischievous music)
(laughing)
-  What were you kiddos doing?
(laughing)
Were you playing with
the camera in your room?
That was funny.
(laughing)
(children yelling)
- What are you doin'?
-  They were playing
on the camera in his room.
It was so cute.
- You playin', you playin'?
Tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.
- Oh.
- Ohhh.
-  What are you boys doin'?
- We were pickin' fruit.
-  Oh, blueberries! (laughs)
-  Might be your food.
-  Oh, thank you. (laughs)
- Mama, you can't eat them.
- Well, just so you know.
Yes, you cannot eat them,
they are not blueberries.
- I'm hungry, I want some.
(Missy laughing)
- You can't eat them.
(gobbling)
No, no, no!
- I'm just kidding.
(Missy laughing)
Pranked you! (laughs)
- Yeah, the boys are just playin' outside.
It is a beautiful night.
It's so good just to
be back with the boys.
I miss my boys.
They're such boys, all
they do is run around
and climb things. (laughs)
Pick things. (laughs)
Ah, it's so nice, I think
we're actually gonna go out
with the boys--
- Here!
- Oh, what?
Did you get me a flower?
And they always are pickin'
mama flowers, and I love it.
Finn's like, "I'm gonna
get you one, too, mom.
"I'm gonna get you one, too."
Ahhh, wow, look at that rose.
That is a beautiful rose. (laughs)
- Here's another one!
-  Oh, another bush?
- Yeah, another one, another bush!
- Oh, wow, yeah these
bushes have these little
things on them.
I don't think they're poisonous at all,
but they're obviously
not blueberries either.
So, don't eat 'em, okay boys?
Oh, oh, he's like, "Here mom,
I got you a better flower."
Thanks, baby.
I have the sweetest boys.
They literally love picking me flowers.
The thing I can't say to them though
is that these flowers stick.
(child yelling)
They smell so bad.
What? Oh, hug, awww.
I love you. Mwah.
Oh, Finn's gotta give me a hug, too.
(laughs) Finn does everything Ollie does,
and it's so cute.
I do wanna show you guys
somethin' that Bryan got us
from Pottery Barn, and I was
so excited when I saw it,
'cause I didn't know he was getting it.
It' says...
It's a little place mat that
says, "Enter if you dare.
"Lanning."
(laughs) I just thought that was so cute!
It has our name on it.
We are getting all sorts
of festive over here.
It's definitely the fall time,
and definitely starting to
become more like Halloween.
These flowers smell so bad.
- Mama?
- (clears throat) Hi.
- When it's Halloween,
we get to get that candy.
- Yeah, once it's October
1st, we get to start doing
the Halloween calendar.
But yeah, look at the trees.
I don't know if you can tell,
but you can see the top of the
tree is like changing colors
and I think they're
starting to die and fall.
So exciting!
Oh, my gosh, my little tree-huggers.
(laughs) And then, what does Finn do?
Hug the tree. (laughs)
And kiss the tree. (laughs)
He's like, "I'm not kissing it."
- Ahhhh!
- Ahhhh!
Check out that huge yellow
flower all by itself.
I don't even know what it is
and we don't have any
others anywhere else.
What'd you get?
- Special delivery!
- Deliveries?
- Yeah.
-  Woo-hoo!
- Mama.
- Did you pick me a bouquet of flowers?
That is the cutest thing ever.
-  Finn's workin'
on one, too. (laughs)
How's your bouquet coming?
Oh, it's just a stick?
It happens.
I know it, I feel like it's a weed.
Wait, is that the same
flower that's up there
in the courtyard, near the door?
- No, no.
This is not the same.
- Wow.
Wonder where it came from?
It's cool, anything can grow out here.
- The inside of it is
so cool looking.
- Really?
It seriously is so beautiful tonight.
Yeah, definitely different
flowers than these ones.
That's so weird, that random flower.
(upbeat music)
