Before today's vlog starts
please know that we understand
that our comments section
is almost always (ding)
full of love and positivity and happiness,
and we absolutely love
it and we are so thankful
for you guys, but at the
same time our comments is
our house and our house, our rules.
And if you cross Missy,
trust me, she can be brutal.
She will take away your
chocolate milk privileges.
But every one in a while, a
comment comes through that
just has us scratching our
noggin and we're like hm,
what was the motivation?
What was the thought process?
Did they use spell-check
or grammar-check at all?
So, today we are gonna share
those comments with you
and we are going to comment back.
If you guys have not seen
our last mean comments video,
I'll have it up in the
icard so you guys can click
it and watch it.
We like to do something fun with these.
It's about due, I think it's due.
Okay, let's get started.
Finn, is there a chicken in our house?
- Yeah.
-  What, where?
Up there?
- Yeah.
- Say cock-a-doodle-doo.
- There.
- (giggle) There is a chicken
in our house, isn't there?
That's Hay-Hay.
How'd Hay-Hay get up there?
- Papa.
- Papa, of course
Papa did it, huh?
- Yeah.
- Alright, today I'm
gettin' Finn a little snack.
- Ollie.
- Are you gettin' a snack?
- Yeah.
- What d'you want to eat?
(Finn babbling)
Popcorn and chicken?
- Yeah.
- That actually sounds like a pretty good.
- Your kids are horrible.
Nobody likes your channel.
I hope you fail.
Your new name is Poopy Bumps.
LOL.
- Well that just sounds
like a mean comment.
- That is a mean comment.
- That is a very mean comment.
- It's a very mean comment.
- What if we just change
our name to Poopy Bumps?
- I feel like our SEO
wouldn't be as successful.
- Yeah, that probably wouldn't work.
-  I was thinkin'
today babe, we could actually
read some mean comments, you know.
- Yeah.
-  Maybe that will
help keep us humble. (laugh)
- You know that I do think
that reading some negative
with the positives is always a good idea.
-  Okay, should we get started?
- Let's do it.
-  Hey Finn, should
we read some mean comments?
- Uh huh.
- So this person said,
I'm sick of seeing the
hourse already.
- What is a hourse?
- I'm sure if they're sick
of seeing our house or
the horse?
- Maybe both?
- If you're sick you should
really just go take some
medicine and like you should
really nip it in the butt.
If you are so sick of seeing
our hourse, you should totally
get some Airborne, it's really, it's good.
It keep you from getting sicker?
I dunno, just a suggestion, trying here.
Finn, you want some water?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
That was a tough comment to swallow huh?
- Yeah. (click)
- Need a little water to help
that comment go down. (laughing)
- Alright, next mean comment
is uh, Missy seriously
you need to break the
habit of touching your hair
so much when you're talking to the camera.
It's annoying to watch.
And like I seriously don't
even know what you're talking
about 'cause like why, first
of all like why is that
even annoying and I don't
touch my hair that much.
So, I dunno what you're
even talking about.
So, anyways, yeah Ollie's
actually at school right now
and I definitely am really
excited to like to go
pick him up.
He actually was a little
emotional this morning but
I think he's just kinda
getting over a little bit of a
cold.
Hopefully he's starting
to feel better. (laugh)
No, but seriously, I do touch
my hair a lot and it's kinda
a habit and I try not to,
but it's kinda just like what
I do so I don't just look
like I'm standing here doing
nothing.
I'm touching my hair, see?
It's funny.
♪ Go Finn, go Finn ♪
♪ It's your birthday ♪
♪ It's your birthday ♪
- You okay?
- Aw, you made it like a foot.
(groan)
- You're a strong boy. (groan)
- So this person commented,
good less horse and better
then yesterday, wrong then.
I jumped over horses.
She
- She jumps over
- She used to jump over horses.
Why Missy abandon kids and goes
everyday to stay with horse.
That's stupid.
You really shouldn't use
that word, that's not nice.
She has small kids, she should
dedicate to them, not the
horse.
I think at this point Missy
just has to make a decision
and I think she likes the
horse more so she's gonna
abandon the kids to go hang
out with the horse more, right?
- I mean I'm gonna have
to abandon one of them.
-  Apparently
you can't have it all.
- I never know how I could ride my horse.
-  (giggling) Just kidding.
(kiss) Momma loves you.
- Hey, I need time to myself too guys.
-  Look at Luna
and Karma right now.
(rooster crowing) They're
seriously playing tug o' war.
(laugh) Karma.
Luna won and yes that is
our rooster going crazy,
huh Finn?
You like the chickens?
(rooster crowing)
- The time he goes crazy the most?
6 A.M., it's really fun.
- Go Finn, go.
Slide.
(laugh)
Here is another comment.
I didn't think it was mean
at first and then I started
thinking about and it
really got to me you guys.
This is probably one of the worst ones.
OMG Ollie and Finn are so cute.
Happy face, happy face,
happy face, happy face.
- What about me?
- What about me?
- Do you think we're cute?
- What about?
Ollie and Finn are cute, sure,
but hello I've been tryin'.
- What about the dogs?
- I've been tryin'.
Karma and Luna are cute.
- They're adorable.
- Karma and Luna I think you're cute.
- Yeah, that person might not,
- Even if this person doesn't
think you're cute.
- But you are cute.
-  Hey Finn, are you
the only cute one in the house?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
He's like prolly.
You two are so cute, also.
Don't you ever forget it, 'kay Luna?
'Kay Karma?
(rooster crowing)
'Kay, go fetch. (giggling)
That rooster is going crazy.
You know who's not cute?
That rooster for sure.
- Okay, this next person
says Miss, you need to stop
saying it's your house.
It's Brine's house too.
I mean who's Brine?
It's definitely not their house.
Who's Brine?
- Brines
- Do you know Brines?
- No, I don't think Brines bought a house.
- He's definitely not
like on the contract.
- Are they saying, do they
think I own the house?
- Maybe.
- 'Cause I don't own the house.
I don't make any money.
Missy's the money maker.
- Yeah, I mean I am the full
bread-winner here, guys, 'kay.
-  Yeah, she makes all our money.
- It's my house, 'kay, it's my house.
Not Brine's, not Bryan's either.
- Thanks for lettin' me live here babe.
- Of course, you know.
- So this mean comment says
the way that Missy runs.
Laughing emoji.
I'm not sure.
I've never really seen Missy run weird.
I'm not really sure what
the comment could ever be
in reference of.
I'm pretty sure Missy
runs completely normal.
(soothing music)
- It's so nice outside.
-  I know, but it's cold.
Come inside.
- Okay.
(soothing music)
-  What, what is she doing?
She move like that all the time?
That's weird.
Look, Finn's just like what
just happened? (giggle)
Has Mommy always ran like that?
- Um hmm.
- So we know some of the, excuse you Luna.
(both laughing)
She's like I'm just gonna lay up here.
So we know some of those
comments weren't exactly mean
but that's kinda the point of it.
I think that regardless of
whether someone leaves a mean
comment or not, we should
still always reply with love
because that is just what the world needs.
So I also thought we should
end this video by sharing
some very positive,
happy, friendly comments.
- Yes.
- From people in our comments section.
- We read a lot of our comments
and there's so much love
and positivity that comes
through it's hard to even let
those negative comments really
effect us because so many
people love us.
- Yeah.
- And it's so awesome.
- And we appreciate you guys.
Abby and Emmy said we love
you Ollie and Finn, watch you
all the time.
- Thanks, that's so sweet.
Alright, this one says my
wife started watching you
when you had 46,000 subs and
we have met you many times.
She really likes you when
you went to VloggerFair
for the first time and Ellie and Jared.
- That's awesome.
- Oh and prolly met Ellie and Jared.
That was an awesome VloggerFair.
Meeting Ellie and Jared was
- Yeah
- Literally so much fun.
It was prolly one of the
first friends we met in real
life from YouTube.
- So TeeLife Daily Vlogs,
you guys have been watching
since 46,000 subscribers, that's crazy.
- I don't even remember
that time, honestly.
Like, I don't even know when that was.
- I know, that had to be
like when we first started.
- Uh huh, well if it was
VloggerFair, well VloggerFair
was we had just Ollie and he was a baby.
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much for
following for that long.
- Seriously it's awesome.
- We just really
appreciate it.
- Alexia said thank you so
much for vlogging every day
for five years.
We appreciate and love you.
We appreciate and love
all of you guys as well.
I think Missy has one more
nice comment as well, right?
- Yes, I do, hang on.
Alright, I read this one earlier
and I just thought it was
so sweet, but it says Missy
you are just beaming all the
time since you got your horse.
You deserve it.
I've never seen you so happy
as you are with, when you
are with Nacho and by the
way I couldn't comment on the
dentist vlog but you are
a great mom to your boys.
So patient and loving.
Thank you so much.
I am of course to absolutely
thrilled to have a dream
come true with my horse.
I just appreciate seeing
comments where people can notice
that like having time with
my horse is so cool and
really important, but I also
love and love spending time
with my boys and it really
makes me feel good when I see
comments that see both
sides of me as a mom and as
a horse lover. (giggle)
- And we kinda just wanna
wrap today's video up with
the simple idea that spreading
love and positivity is
what this world needs right now.
Yes, there are mean people online.
There are mean people in
real life, but I've always
been a huge believer in love.
That love can stomp out hate.
That's kinda what we wanted
to wrap up this video with.
- And if you're one of
those people that leave nice
comments all the time, and we
didn't read them, just know
that we appreciate you.
We love you and we've been
doing this for five years.
Honestly, our comments
section is really, really fun
to go through.
People are so supportive and loving,
and we thank you guys and
that's why we're still
doin' it after five years.
- Yes.
- We're on our sixth year.
- So go leave some friendly comments.
Go to other people's channels,
leave friendly comments.
- We need it guys.
- And encourage others to do the same.
- Yes, alright.
We're gonna go ahead and end this video.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
We thought it was kinda fun.
- Say bye, Luna.
- Bye Luna.
Oh, Karma wants to say bye too.
Hi Karma (giggle).
We will see you guys tomorrow.
Can you give a thumbs up, Karm?
No?
-  Finn, maybe with your pinky up.
Pointing.
-  Look at that thumbs up.
-  Point up to the sky.
-  He's like it's
naptime mom, I'm done.
(laughing)
- Point up to the sky.
- Whoop, up, he's like yeah.
(giggle) Alright, we will
see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
- Bye boop.
- Bye boop.
