-  Finn, guess what?
(laughter)
It's nap time.
- No.
-  It's nap time.
It's nap time.
Nap time.
♪ It's our lives ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
- Good morning.
Are you ready for school, bud?
- Yeah.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
- Today is share day.
What are you going to be sharing today?
- My Captain Jake and the
Never Land Pirates sword.
- Yes.
That's a lot of words and we are looking
for something that
starts with the letter J.
We could not think of
anything, other than Jessie,
which we have a Jessie from Toy Story,
but it's kind of like a collectable item
and it's kind of put up on the high shelf
that we don't really play with,
so I didn't really want to do that one
and then I found a Jake and
the Never Land Pirates sword.
That starts with the letter J.
I mean, technically it's
like a sword I guess
but Jake and the Never Land Pirates,
so I mean I guess that'll work.
Right?
Cause Jake starts with a...
- Q.
(laughter)
- J.
- J.
Jake, juh, juh.
Jake starts with the letter...
- Q.
- J.
Preschoolers, they're so cute.
We need to work on the letter J.
Alright, Ollie is off to school.
I actually just got my
hair done with Michelle.
Oh my goodness, I just dropped it.
Yeah, just got my hair
done really, really quick.
I love Michelle, she's so nice.
She's like, "Sure, come in.
"I'll do your hair."
And I'm actually headed to
a horseback riding lesson.
And I actually haven't really filmed
any of my horseback riding lessons yet,
so maybe I will film a little bit of this.
The only thing is that
when I'm doing a lesson
I do have to be super
focused and so if I'm filming
it makes it a little
difficult, but we'll see.
Maybe I'll get some fun little footage.
It's lesson time, Nacho.
Are you ready?
Are you going to be good?
You gonna be nice to me?
(upbeat music)
Good lesson, Nacho.
We did so good today, huh?
We practiced a lot of just transitioning
from trotting to cantering.
I would say I did pretty good,
but he did really, really good.
He has a bit of a habit
to throw his head up
and keep his head too
high, and he's definitely
starting to relax his head
as you can see right now.
He's just do, do, do, let's
just relax and have a fun time
and this is how he was
even trotting, too, so.
And it's just been fun
to kind of grow with him,
cause we're both learning a
lot together and he's just
such a fast learner
and a good, good horse.
- Alright you guys, I am
back at the studio space,
which is still just a
giant, empty building,
but check this out.
These closets were all torn out.
The little reception area
that was here is all torn out.
So it's like way bigger.
Still trying to get this carpet up,
and today we're doing
something really cool.
So we got Justin Critz here.
Do you guys remember him?
He helped me out on my album.
He's gonna be doing some
recording for me as we do
a cover video on this cool new
DJI Osmo, which is awesome.
Are you loving it?
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's so cool.
I love that you can control
the direction of the joystick.
The entire place is filling up with smoke,
as you can see, so this
is gonna be really cool.
Also, this may be one of
the only videos we film
in this building before
we get it all built out,
so we're gonna try and
highlight some of the
industrial features of
it before it looks all
nice and pretty and like
a nice new building.
Look at that, that smoke is
just lingering under that light.
I love it.
(techno music)
Alright, so we just finished filming.
Justin, thank you so much.
You're awesome.
- Of course.
No, thank you.
-  So now we're taking
some photos and what is this?
Is this--
- It's a prism.
It's called a prism.
-  It's like something
from The Fifth Element.
- It is.
- Oh, cool.
- I don't think I use it correctly,
but I just use it to add some
light flares around here.
-  It's cool.
- Yeah, a lot of people use it
for reflections, but I don't.
-  No, dude, that's awesome.
He's taking some cool photos.
(techno music)
- Alright, I am home.
Or I'm not home, I'm
at Mimi and Papa's now.
And look, it's Finnie.
Have you been having fun with Mimi?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
(laughter)
He's just been hanging
out here for a little bit.
Wow, you have so much energy.
It's actually nap time so
just get the rest of that out now.
I don't know if you guys know,
but Bryan is just working
on some stuff today
and a little busy, so he got
to hang out with Mimi and Papa.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
Was that fun?
Guess what, guess what?
It's nap time.
(laughter)
Finn.
Guess what?
It's nap time.
- No.
- It's nap time.
It's nap time.
(laughter)
It's nap time.
Alright, after a little convincing,
I think he knows he's going
down for a nap, right?
- Yeah.
- Can you say night night?
And then when you wake up,
we're gonna go play, play, play, okay?
He gets to sleep in his
bedroom at Mimi and Papa's.
I don't know if you guys remember.
We totally did this room.
They actually ended up
switching it back to a twin bed
and then this has a pull-out bed in there.
They can both still sleep here,
but it's a lot roomier
in here when they're not.
We're gonna try and take a nap now.
We'll see how--
Good job.
Turning your sound machine on.
(peaceful music)
(record scratch)
And this is about
as far as we got with nap time.
Not gonna happen, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You're gonna have to sleep in the car.
And of course he fell asleep
the second we hit the car,
actually probably like one minute
into our drive he was fast asleep.
But look who's here now.
- Hi.
-  How was school?
- Good.
-  Did you share your Jake
and the Never Land Pirate stuff?
- Yeah.
-  So cool.
How did it go?
Did everyone like it?
- Yeah.
-  Was there any other
cool share toys that you saw?
- Mm hm.
-  Which ones?
- Peyton's jellyfish.
- A jellyfish from Peyton?
That's so cool.
Yeah, it was so nice, I actually ran into
Jeffrey when I was
running in and I was like,
"can you watch Finn so
that I don't have to
"bring him out of the car seat?"
So Jeffrey watched him while I got Ollie,
so I'm like a little out of breath.
Finn stayed asleep, so yay.
Thank you, Jeffrey.
Alright, we're off to go home.
(laughter)
-  What are you laughing at, boys?
-  No, don't hit it.
-  She's got it, she's got it.
- Ready?
Ah.
Hang on, hang on.
- I knew it.
-  Look at that balance,
that poise, and that grace.
That's amazing.
Get it, babe?
That's a-maze-ing.
- A maze?
- Cause this is Maze-O, and it's a maze
game that the boys are going to play.
- Do you guys want to play this?
Can I open it?
-  Alright, so the boys
are going to be playing
this cool little STEM toy.
It's the mighty maze
maker and what they do
is they draw a card,
which has a shape on it,
and then they have to
build it with their maze.
- So they have lots of cool pictures
that you can make with it.
-  Ooh, look at the pirate ship.
- A pirate ship.
That's just a heart.
Here's a big old whale.
-  So you know
what this means, boys.
We're gonna have to do a little friendly
competition brother against brother.
Who's gonna win?
- I think it's me.
-  You?
What about you, Finn?
Who's gonna win?
- Mama.
-  Mama's gonna win.
- That's probably right.
-  I'm the champion.
(laughter)
-  Are you
going to win, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- Daddy.
-  Daddy's gonna win.
- So what we'll do is
we'll give them a card,
we'll let both of them create it,
and then we'll see who wins.
This is how you make kids grow,
you have to pit them against each other.
Alright, boys, round one.
You guys are going to
be making a puzzle box.
Here is all of the things
you are going to need.
These are puzzle pieces
that you're gonna have to
put together to create this, okay?
Finn is thinking very, very hard
on this one, using
those fine motor skills.
(cheerful music)
- Blue piece, yellow piece,
green piece, and red piece.
-  Yep, so grab all
your pieces first, Ollie,
and then you can put them together.
(cheerful music)
Alright, Ollie is all
finished with his maze.
Let's see it.
That is so cool.
So how does it go, Ollie?
Can you figure out how to do it?
So you start right here or right here.
(cheerful music)
- Good job.
-  Good job.
- I think that's like, really good
for him to put that together.
-  I know.
- I don't know if he really
knows the concept of a maze.
- Yeah.
- So it's
a good thing to learn.
- And this is so fun because this is
like a super easy one,
but it goes up in levels.
-  So Ollie, look,
what makes this a maze
is you have to figure out the way out,
because what if you went this
way and then went over here?
Oh.
You'd be stuck, huh?
- Can't go that way, huh?
-  So you gotta go
all the way back around.
And Finn is building
a pretty amazing maze.
He kind of broke the mold.
He was like, "You know what?
"I don't really need instructions
on how to play this game.
"I'm gonna play it on my own."
And he did very well.
- Yes.
-  Look at what he's making, babe.
- That was awesome, Finnie.
-  That is so awesome.
- Look, if you
go in this way and go that
way, you'll get stuck.
You can't go that way.
Good job.
-  That's cool, Finn.
-  He's so good at it.
Good job, Finn.
Last one?
- Yeah.
- Alright.
Put the last one right there.
There you go, you did it.
(clapping)
He's so proud of himself.
It's adorable.
Alright, can you do the maze now?
Go this way, and this
way, and this way, and oh.
Not over here.
Oh, out there.
- Woo.
- I want to get a car
to go drive the maze.
-  Yeah, that's a good idea, dude.
Go get one.
You go, too, Finnie.
You each can grab a little
car for your maze, okay?
Alright, Missy is now
doing the Maze-O boy,
which is a boy one, and we're gonna see
how the boys do going through the maze.
So you gotta go up the leg
and out the arm, okay boys?
- Okay.
-  Alright, so Mama
finished the boy maze,
and now we're going to
time them and see how long
it takes each of them
to do the maze properly.
- Yeah, so Ollie you're
going to use this car
and you're gonna start here and you have
to get to here without
going over any walls.
You just have to drive through, okay?
- Okay.
- Are you ready?
Okay.
On your marks, get set, go.
-  Go, Ollie, go.
Good job.
Oh, he did it.
- Guess that was really easy.
(laughter)
-  Ollie,
that was like seven seconds.
Good job, bro.
-  Yay.
-  Alright, Finnie, your turn.
How fast can Finnie do it, you ready?
- Ready.
On your marks, get set, go.
-  Go, go, go.
Good job.
- Four seconds, he won.
-  Babe, did you do this one right?
- I think so.
-  You most definitely did, yes.
I don't know why that was so easy.
- Okay, I'm gonna switch around a couple.
Hang on.
-  And look, there's
a Maze-O boy on this side
and Maze-O girl on this side.
- Wait, I wanna see.
-  Yeah.
- Girl on this side, boy on this side.
-  Cool.
-  Okay, so Mama
has now built a girl, see?
She's got red hair, she's
got two little arms,
she's got a cute little
dress on, and some legs.
We're gonna go ahead
and race doing this one.
I'm hoping it's a little bit harder
since the boy was so easy.
So here we go, okay?
You have to get from this leg
all the way to this arm, okay?
- Okay. My turn.
-  On your marks, get set, go.
(upbeat music)
Nope, nope.
Don't go over.
-  There?
-  Uh, oh.
-  Stuck.
-  No, no.
Okay, there you go.
You've gotta back up and then turn.
(upbeat music)
Uh, oh.
Are you stuck?
- I don't know.
-  So, Ollie, get back to here.
(laughter)
Go back to here.
Now turn.
See?
(mumbling)
And...
Oh, I forgot to set the timer.
Um, you did one minute.
Good job.
High five.
That was a hard one, huh?
Okay, it's Finn's turn.
On your marks, get set, and start.
Go.
(mumbling)
Go.
Can you get through?
- All the way to that one.
-  Good job.
Oh, wrong arm.
You gotta go through this way.
Whew, apparently the girl is a lot harder.
Where do you go from there?
-  Ah.
-  Ah.
-  Go through this way, Finn.
-  Oh, he's starting over.
(laughter)
Well, I think
it's safe to say that Finn
doesn't really understand
and this one is definitely a harder one.
Yay.
You did it.
Woohoo, good job, boys.
This is awesome.
Not only is it awesome for
them to be able to build,
which I just built some really hard ones
that they wouldn't be able to do,
but it's just really good for them to put
puzzles together like this, but also good
to actually try and do the maze.
And this is such a cute little car.
Rr, er, ah.
(Finn yelling)
Alright.
It is time for bedtime, huh?
-  Yeah.
- Yep, and we are reading our book.
I'm actually reading "Dragons Love Tacos."
Every night, we read books, right?
- Yeah.
- How many books do we
get to read every night?
-  Three.
-  Three, you're right.
- Three and five.
- Three and five?
Sometimes between three and five.
I try and keep it between three
on a normal night, two
if I'm like, go to bed.
And like five if I'm like,
"Well, it's a little early."
"I guess we can stay up."
So which book is your favorite?
- This book.
-  That's your favorite?
-  And this book.
-  Uh huh, so these
ones are all about Oliver,
but he can actually say every single word
of that book from start to finish.
You have that one memorized.
Finn is definitely a little tired tonight.
As you guys know, he
didn't get much of a nap.
He's not super happy.
I was trying to think of
what his favorite book is.
I would say that his favorite
book is this one right now.
He got this when we went to Hawaii
and whenever we read it he get so excited
cause he has that little monkey.
We've got a lot of books here,
but we've read all these
about 100 times, huh?
So yeah, let us know down below what your
favorite bedtime story is
and we'll read over them
and get some of the ones
that you guys enjoy.
But anyways, for now we're gonna go ahead
and end the video, so make
sure you give this video
a big thumbs up if you enjoyed it, yay,
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
- Bye.
Boop.
(upbeat music)
