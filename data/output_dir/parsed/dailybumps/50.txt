- You guys, welcome to year five!
- Welcome to year five!
(upbeat instrumental music)
- We've been vlogging every
day for five years, you guys.
It honestly is amazing, when you think
about how many people watch these vlogs,
and how many people subscribe, and it's
really kind of humbling
to have so many people
be inspired by you.
(upbeat instrumental music)
We've always vlogged even
the most mundane life things,
but I will say that we've gotten
pretty good at making it
a lot more interesting.
(upbeat electronic music)
And that's kind of like what our life
is all about, right?
- Yeah, I love the fact that our vlogs
can be just us, you know us.
But you also know that we're really fun.
You can see both of
that through our vlogs.
(gentle instrumental music)
- We always try to stay fun and positive.
And I think it's a good
thing for the vlog,
but it's a good thing as a family also.
- I think it's really good as a family
because we get to stay
happy, and we're having fun.
-  Yeah.
(upbeat electronic music)
-  But you also do
see us in our sad moments.
You see us struggling, you
see us having bad days.
But you know what?
That's what everyone deals with.
♪ And I saw some sad ♪
♪ Big blue eyes ♪
♪ But I've been sad ♪
♪ This is home ♪
- I think the message I want people
to take away is that families are
a place of joy, comfort,
and acceptance, and love.
And if you are in a family where you don't
get those things, you can watch us,
and you can find it, and you
can know that it is possible.
(upbeat electronic music)
- Life isn't always easy.
You've seen our struggles, you've seen
what we've been through, we try and just
show a lot of the positivity, and you
guys can have that too, even if your life
is hard, and struggling, and
you're having difficulties.
(upbeat electronic music)
(family cheers)
-  Three million!
- And we just wanna say thank you to
all of our viewers, and every one
that's been watching
us, and supporting us.
-  We couldn't be more grateful.
(upbeat electronic music)
Thanks for five years of daily vlogs!
We will see you manana.
- Bye!
- Bye.
- Bye!
-  Boop.
