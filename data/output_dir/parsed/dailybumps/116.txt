- There is ash falling from the sky.
Oh my gosh, this is really unfortunate
it's Missy's birthday and we wanna
be like having a good day we're preparing
for a huge party and we may
have to leave our house.
(upbeat music)
- We should do the bath challenge.
-  We should?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, you wanna do
the bath challenge Halloween edition?
- Yeah.
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Happy birthday mama.
-  Happy birthday to mama.
- Thank you, big hugs.
-  Luna's getting in there, love.
- This morning Ollie woke up, he said,
happy birthday mama I'm gonna
give you a big special hug.
- Aw, happy birthday babe.
- Thanks.
- We have just been hanging out
and getting ready for our party.
And watching the news about
the fire which is frustrating.
If you guys didn't see
our video yesterday,
I'll have it linked in the
I-card so you can watch it.
There's a very large fire
very close to our house.
Everyone around us is being evacuated
we are now in the evacuation warning zone.
Which means that if they say that.
- Like be ready.
- Yeah we have to, we have to,
like get everything ready to go.
'Cause if they come to our house
and tell us we have to
leave, we have to leave, so.
- Yeah, I'm pretty stressed right now.
I don't feel like were at all
at risk of our house being burned down.
- No I don't think the fire
is, is close enough anymore.
- But we are at risk that like
we'll have road closures, power outages,
things like that which I honestly
feel for everyone who there
house is being threatened.
Which I don't think any structures
are being threatened at the moment.
- No, none are being threatened right now.
They're kind of just clearing way
so that they can get through
the streets and stuff.
- But that could mean that all
this work that I'm putting into
this party that I'm still probably
gonna be doing all day
today, may be for nothing.
Which is really stressful, I just
feel like defeated right now.
- Yeah, okay, yeah we should probably
just like get a basket of all our
our certificates and passports, right.
-  Yeah.
- Should probably start doing something.
I know, I know, alright boys
we may have to leave okay.
-  'Kay.
-  So Ollie pack up
all your favorite toys 'kay.
- I already did.
- Oh you already did, he actually
already did I saw him carrying
a bag with all his toys in it today.
Alright so you're ready
if we have to evacuate?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, Finn, you
got your favorite toys?
- Yeah.
- So normally our cars are in the garage
but because we're putting the maze
they're all parked outside which
means they are basically
all covered in ash,
let me show you, all
of this, is ash, crazy.
-  Yeah it's like all over here.
- And honestly, there's no smell.
Like you can't smell the fire, whatsoever,
there's no like smoke in the air.
We've smelt many fires, you know,
in our time in living in California.
There's always like oh
no is that like a fire.
But there's one like so close
to the house, and I smell nothing.
Obviously that means the wind
is like blowing another direction.
Which is a good thing, I think too,
because obviously then the fire's
not going to come towards us.
If the wind is going the other way.
But it's all just very overwhelming.
-  I have a safe with all
of our, like passports
and birth certificates.
Then I have a big basket with
all our like, important house stuff
and business stuff, all ready to go.
I have a tech bag all ready to go.
With chargers and laptops
and stuff like that.
So now I think the only thing
we would have to do if we had
to leave was throw some clothes
in a suitcase and get the animals.
And then take our cars and go.
Just sucks, this sucks you guys.
This is really unfortunate I,
it's Missy's birthday and we wanna
be like having a good day we're
preparing for a huge party and
we may have to leave our house.
I feel really bad for Missy mostly,
if we have to cancel the party.
Because we've put a lot of time
into it, we've put a lot of money into it.
We're really excited about it.
And it would definitely be a damper
on the whole thing if we
had to cancel the party, so.
I'm just hoping that they get
control of the fire today, if they
get control of the fire we won't have to
leave our house, we won't have to take
all this stuff with us, right.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah we don't wanna
leave, we like our house, huh.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, I love you.
You guys probably can't see it at all.
But I literally just noticed there
is ash falling from the sky, right now.
Oh my gosh, what a great
birthday for my wife.
Okay I just spoke with our neighbor.
It seems like everything is fine.
The people who had mandatory evactions,
deeper near the fire, can't even
see the fire anymore, they're still
at their house and everything is fine.
So I think we're good and they're
actually gonna start letting
people up our street again.
They're moving everything so I think
we're in the safe zone which is good.
I have everything packed still and ready.
But today we can actually
focus on the Halloween
party, we are throwing
a huge Halloween party.
And it's gonna be so much fun.
And I'm so excited for you guys
to see our costumes and
everyone and everything, so.
That's what we're preparing for today.
