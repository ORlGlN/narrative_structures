-  What are all these packages?
- Well, I don't know.
-  When did these get here?
- I don't know how they get here.
- There's a lot of packages
sitting in my foyer, you guys.
I think we're going to open
these and see what's inside.

- Good morning!
It's early again this morning,
but the boys actually slept in,
just a little bit, like maybe 45 minutes,
but it made all the difference.
(Missy laughs)
Yeah, we had a late night last night
decorating the tree, doing family stuff.
-  Wait, we forgot this one!
- Oh, we forgot that
decoration for the tree.
- Yeah!
- But, anyways, we're up and we're now
gonna go look for Fred,
check out our Christmas tree.
I don't know if any of you guys notice,
but the top half of our Christmas
tree, it's just not lit.
I'm so bummed.
We spent hours trying to get--
- There!
- the lights to be perfect.
Nope, he's not with, he's not pretending
to be baby Jesus anymore.
Yeah, and just like, from here to here,
they're just not working.
So, I'm going to have
to find the light bulb
while on the tree.
I don't know if that can be done.
So, so bummed about that.
Anyway, okay, let's find him, okay?
I don't think he's on the Christmas tree.
I love our tree it's so pretty.
Finley, are you checking
out our new Santa?
I think we press him.
Where do we press him?

- And that one!
-  Oh, you want to do this one too?
And then we have a snowman, ready?
- Yes!
♪ The weather outside is frightful ♪
-  Wait leave him there.
Oh my goodness.
(Finley laughs)
Look he turns!
- Um-poppa
-  Did you just
call that Um-poppa, again?
- Yeah.
-  Does that look like papa?
This one's so cute.
Alright, we gotta find Fred, c'mon boys!
- Okay!
-  Still looking for Fred.
I'm looking everywhere, huh?
What do you see?
(Missy gasps)
Oh my gosh, is that Fred?
- Fred!
Oh my gosh, what is going on here?
That is Woody taking a picture of Fred
and he's all dressed
up as a Christmas tree.
(Missy laughs)
Let's take pics today!
Oh my gosh, we're going
to go take pics today.
How does he know?
- I don't know.
-  That is so funny.
Look, he's got a little background set up.
Oh, and look at the picture, they had a
little photo shoot last night.
-  Yeah.
-  Look at all those pictures.
-  Oh!
-  Oh my gosh, it's a
selfie, with Woody and Fred.
So cute, look at them!
I'm impressed, Fred.
(holiday music)
- Alright you guys, we are back
at the tree farm this morning
because we are getting
family pictures taken
for our Christmas card.
And all these kids are
hanging out with us.
What's up, kiddos?
- Hey!
- We're on a pirate ship!
-  Oh you are?
- Yeah!
-  A pirate ship made out of hay?
- No, we're on the
pirate ship that can fly.
-  Oh, okay.
You look cute, Ollie.
- Yeah, we're all dressed up
and back at the Christmas trees,
so that we can start taking some photos.
(holiday music)
-  Brooke's shooting
with some film action going on.
- Look up at mom, okay, look up at mommy.
Where's mommy?
Good job!
(camera snaps)
and then Missy looks down at him.
-  You're doing so good, buddy.
(Bryan chuckles)
Finn is riding his first tire swing!
Look at this kiddo!
They're having so much fun playing
on the ropes and the swings.
(Bryan laughs)
Do you like that Finn?
You want to go to that one?
- Yeah!
- Okay!
Finn is a pro at this one.
Okay, go show me how you do it, okay?
Climb in there buddy!
Do you want to climb in the hole?
Oh, you climbing in that way?
Good job, dude!
Wee!
(Bryan laughs)
Good job, dude!
(holiday music)
- We saw the tepee!
-  Yeah, you did,
look at this amazing tepee
it's decorated in Christmas lights.
Check out this sign, right here, you guys,
it has all these fictional places where
you can go and visit, including heaven.
There's the Shire, Narnia,
Fern Gully, Neverland,
Mrs. Perigrines.
Babe, you are looking so
good for this photoshoot.
Was this bridge here before?
I don't remember this.
- I don't remember this either.
- Oh.
- But it must have been,
it's pretty old.
- Yeah.
So this tree's called The Great Oak.
- And it's over 500 years old.
-  That's crazy!
Look at this tree, you guys!
This is one tree.
- It's so pretty it has lights in it and--
-  Yeah.
This is so crazy, you
guys, oh wow, I, oh wow.
I wish we had something like this
on our property, this is so crazy.
- It would be amazing.
-  And you see,
it's like, created a bush
around it from the limbs falling.
- Yeah this would be amazing
to have on our property.
-  Yeah, look at this, it would
take an investment for sure.
We'd have to plant it
and then the people who'd
live there in 500 years.
- Yeah, totally thanking us.
(bird chirping)
-  Crazy! This is so beautiful.
Oh, there you go!
Nice babe!
(Bryan laughs)
- Go, Chuck, go!
-  Round two!
(loud yelling)
American Ninja Warrior right there!
-  You need a
friend to help move it!
Finn get on this side, buddy!
Alright, you gotta push your
legs up so you can play.
See, it then goes down.
Yay!
And then up and down, yay!
That's called a teeter totter, Finn.
(Bryan laughs)
Finn, what did you just find?
Finn's hugging the tree.
He's a tree hugger.
C'mon kiddos.
(holiday music)
Hey, Ollie what's up?
- What?
-  What are you doing?
- Trying to play super slimy ghost.
-  Oh, really?
- Yeah!
- We have Finn asleep for a nap.
We just done with our photo
shoot which went so good.
Missy's out running errands,
and, Ollie, what are all these packages?
- I don't know.
-  When did these get here?
- I don't know how they get here.
- There' a lot of packages
sitting in my foyer, you guys.
I think we're gonna open
these and see what's inside.
Do you know, Ollie?
- Yeah!
- You know?
- I think it's toys.
-  You think it's toys?
I'm not sure what it is.
Let's open up and see
because I'm not sure I know
what all these giant packages
are and I think Missy is
gonna be really mad at
me if I accidentally
ordered something on Ebay or Amazon
and maybe I ordered, accidentally, like,
too many of it.
Yeah, that's a lot of packages.
- Yeah.
- We should open it.
It's pretty rare that we
get a package at our house
and I don't know what's in it.
So, the fact that I
don't know what this is
is kind of interesting.
Let's see, so it's a box.
Paper! There's paper in it!
Don't you want to play with it?
- No!
(Bryan laughs)
- Just kidding, buddy,
it's not just paper.
Looks like another box in
this box, it's very heavy.
Very, very heavy.
Oh, hey, Finn.
-  Hey.
-  Did you just
wake up from your nap?
Finn, just woke up from his nap.
You're just in time, Finn.
- I want Fred!
-  I know! You see, Fred?
(Bryan laughs)
- Hey, Finn, look at all these boxes!
-  I know it's Woody, huh?
- Woody's taking a picture of Fred.
- That's so cool!
(Bryan laughs)
Boys are always getting
sidetracked, you guys.
Okay, let's open up this
box and see what's inside.
- Paper!
- More paper!
(Bryan gasps)
Look what it is!
It's the calendars!
Yay!
Okay, you guys, it's
official, we're signing these.
We have so many calendars to sign.
Ollie, are you ready to sign?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah, Finn,
are you ready to sign?
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
So, for those of you who ordered
a signed calendar from our merch store,
we're gonna be signing these
in the next couple of days
and then shipping them off to you guys.
We're really, really hoping
to get them to you guys
before Christmas.
So, that's what we're
working on right now.
That's incredible, you guys, that there is
that many calendars.
You guys, are so amazing,
seriously, thank you so much.
It was so fun to do that photo shoot
and to turn it into something like this
that we can look back on forever
and like have you guys involved.
I think it's really, really special,
so, seriously, thank you guys.
Finn, look!
And we have this one too, huh?!
Santa's dancing around.
Look it's spinning!
- Oh yeah!
- I know!
Finn loves these, it's so funny!
Hang your stocking and say your prayers
'cause Santa Claus comes in 21 days.
- Daddy, you can hold him like a baby.
-  You can, huh?
You love him, Finn?
- No, he's fat.
(Bryan laughs)
(heavy bass music)
- Bustin' out the bike!
Ollie said he wanted to try his
other bike today with his pedals.
Whoa, look at you go, dude!
So, this is how you break,
Ollie, if you want to stop
you pull this.
See?
And it breaks, but you
don't need to put it
if you're trying to go.
So, put your feet up on the pedals
and then use your steerin'.
There you go, you're
getting some speed, see?
And then that's how you
stop, good job buddy!
Finn, no, don't go down the hill.
(Bryan laughs)
Turn around silly.
(upbeat music)
Hey, look mama's home!
Hey, babe!
The kids wanted to play outside.
It's so cold, though.
- It's so cold.
- I think they need jackets.
I'm, like, wearing the
same thing Ollie has
and I'm like starting to get cold now.
You want to try the bike, Finn?
- Yes!
-  Alright!
-  Not quite big enough, bud.
-  So you put your feet
on the pedal, right there.
Isn't that cool?
He kind of wants to do it.
(Bryan laughs)
- Alright it is bath time,
which means I am cleaning
out my bathroom.
It's kind of a disaster.
I just have, like, tons
of things that are like
kind of empty or I haven't
used them in forever
and I need to throw them away.
I actually found something really cool.
I didn't want to say that
if you don't know this
the Johnsons just announced
that they are pregnant.
And I'm still literally in shock,
I'm actually like I'm so excited about it.
They've put out an extremely cute video
telling their kids and their family.
They even told me and Bryan,
and I am still in shock.
Like my whole body was
like chilled and like,
"oh my god, I can't
believe this is happening."
Like it was just so exciting
and I'm just so excited
that, like, my boys get
to be involved in like
kind of see someone for the
first time they're going
to really see the process
of someone being pregnant
and they're belly getting
bigger and bigger and bigger
and feeling the baby, like, oh!
I'm so excited about it,
but I was cleaning out stuff
and look what I found.
Look what I found!
I found the pregnancy test
from when I was pregnant,
when I found out I was
pregnant with Ollie.
Like that's so gross, they're
like sitting in these bags
and they're so nasty, but look at that!
(Missy gasps)
(slow guitar music)
And I was just like, oh!
It's so exciting!
It's just really, really cool
that like Natalia's pregnant.
A lot of people have
been asking me, though.
They're like alright
Missy Natalia's pregnant,
Ellie's pregnant, you're next.
And I'm like, no I'm not!
(Missy laughs)
I'm not next, but you
are going to start to see
in the next few months us,
like, kind of preparing
for the next baby or like the
decision to have another baby.
But I will say that I do not
decide on when to get pregnant
just because people
around me are pregnant.
I do not have baby fever
right now I'm loving my life
with my two kids.
I'm excited for another one
when we decide to do it again.
We have, like, a plan and
we have, like, an idea
in mind of what we want, but
just because Natalia's pregnant
doesn't mean I'm getting pregnant.
Anyways, I'm just reminiscing
about the good old days
of finding out your
pregnant and how exciting
and scary and crazy it is.
I can't believe I still have these.
(Missy laughs)
They're just sitting
in, like, weird drawers.
But, anyways, I'm just so
excited about Natalia and Jeffrey
and Olivia and Peyton and
how it's just so exciting
there's going to be a
new little boy or girl
running around here.
If you guys haven't seen
the announcement video
it is super special, I'll
have it linked up here
you guys can go check it out!
Go subscribe to them
'cause now they're starting
a whole new journey, a
whole new thing going on.
I think she even said she
was gonna do some bump dates.
So, if you're a mom you
might get really excited
for something like that.
I'm just excited to kind of
follow along, like, we've always
been in each others lives, but, you know,
it's so different when
someone is living their life
somewhat on Youtube.
We get to actually follow
it along in that way
and I'm so excited and it's
going to be so much fun!
We get to do gender reveals
and all the baby showers all over again.
Alright boys are all clean
there, wash their hair,
wash their faces, brush their
teeth, took their vitamins,
washed their booties!
But, anyways, we are ready for bed.
You've been kind of crazy today, huh?
Alright, we're going to go
'head and end today's video.
Make sure to give a big thumbs up!
(Missy laughs)
And we will see you guys tomorrow.
Make sure you guys go
subscribe to the Johnson's

Bye!
(upbeat music)
Ollie wants to do it, ready?
- Bye!
Poop.
