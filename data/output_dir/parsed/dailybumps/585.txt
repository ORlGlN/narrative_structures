this car this car is nice good morning
guys Missy actually left really early
this morning because Finn was not
feeling well and when she touched his
ear he seemed a little irritable kids
are just going through a hair infections
like crazy so she took him to the doctor
and I think I'm gonna go meet her for
breakfast cuz she was starving and all I
was hungry and we actually have no eggs
which is a bummer so I think I'm gonna
go grocery shopping right afterwards -
we're gonna go meet with mama okay okay
I love you stuck in traffic we've got a
slight change of plans oli yeah Finn is
really sick so instead of meeting mama
at the doctor's office I have to meet
him at the hospital okay so me me and
pop are gonna come take you you wanna
hang out with me me and Papa today okay
and you can play with your toys yeah so
I'm now meeting Missy at the hospital
Finn was having some wheezing and they
gave him oxygen treatment and it didn't
work so we're going to see
they can do at the hospital instead poor
little guys not doing good this morning
all right we are at the hospital now
with a fini
Ali went with Mimi and Papa so we
thought he had an ear infection which
his ears were good he has no ear
infection so that's good they right now
have like a little guy to just check in
make sure that he doesn't have any
kidney infections around the check is
urine what I was sounding office was
wheezing and I had never heard that at
like the house or anything so I didn't
even bring him in for that or anything
but I did hear it in the office and so
we had to give him like this treatment
for ten minutes I was like a breathing
treatment so it didn't really help yeah
afterwards he still had still wheezing
basically she was like you're spending
in the hospital and then they're gonna
do that treatment what it sounds like is
like every couple hours but now that
we're here
he's Mama's much wheezing like it really
doesn't sound this bad yeah they're
saying it could be the air conditioning
- like solution air sure can I help open
up your lungs again yeah the warm air
out here is not really like good when
they have stuff like this
yeah but he's being happy he's got a
little thing on his toe that he's
picking out he's not too happy about
that your toe is glowing if any checking
all his good stuff oxygens at 98 right
now so that's good you gave him a tongue
depressor to keep him occupied Oh
you
you gotta like not gonna count their
child above I can't you are a kid you
are really trying to keep him happy
I know oh yeah he really is ready to
just like get down and call around of
course he can't crawl around on this you
know I've heard some crazy stories about
these floors he just wants to be his
playroom when he wants to crawl around
and play with toys and he can't so he's
a little bummed right now all right we
are now out of the hospital finally and
look at little thin he feels evil he's
finally getting a nap yes he left us in
there way too long and so like almost
nothing like yeah thank you mint they
gave him Tylenol which we waited like
two hours forever yeah
I don't know myself but basically we
know he has bronc bronchiolitis and it
he could have it for a couple weeks and
he if he just got it a couple days ago
it's bound to get really worse before he
gets better so they kind of just told us
to keep an eye on it so we're gonna take
him to get a checkup on Monday yeah
check it out it's also it wasn't for
nothing I mean I did kind of learn what
that wheezing sound sounds like so
figure again I will take him in and
they'll have to listen to it
and we'll just have to keep an eye on it
then I'm having trouble breathing
yeah so now I'm pretty sure Olli is
taking a nap with Mimi and Papa so we
are going grocery shopping and we
basically just devoured the produce
section

tomatoes oh I've never seen them this
