don't go to sleep all these old guys
sleep hey buzz buzz woody how are you
this morning I'm actually headed to a
place that I'm not very fond of you may
not be very fond of it either
it's the DMV that's right the Department
of Motor Vehicles where time stands
still do you guys know DMVs in
California are like 10 times worse than
anywhere else either but I have an
appointment I just have something simple
that I need to change so I'm hoping that
it goes as planned I've spent many many
hours in this DMV before I left Missy at
home this morning
she's hopefully trying to relax she
hasn't been feeling too good having lots
of contractions this morning and I let
her sleep in a little and she got to
take a nice bath
good morning I like you see morning baby
you wanna be a baby all right you get in
there baby good morning guys it's
definitely a late start our morning but
I'm doing it I'm getting ready I gotta
do my makeup and all that but it has
been slightly a rough morning for me I
just was so uncomfortable this morning I
got a lot of aches and pains and and am
still having Braxton Hicks although not
as like close together as they were like
last night
definitely not contractions I mean I
guess you can consider a Braxton Hicks a
contraction but not like real labor
are you okay okay come here okay woody
the reason I would say that they are so
like uncomfortable and slightly painful
is because he's so high and my ribs that
when I'm having a Brexton hIG's it
literally feels like my ribs are gonna
like pop apart so that's kind of keeping
an eye on it know that it's not
dehydration I drink a lot a lot of water
it's actually one of my main cravings I
drink ice water all day long and they
seem to happen more when I'm like laying
down if I'm like sitting and laying down
that's when I really feel them and I
think it's cuz that's because I'm in an
uncomfortable position you have to kind
of keep moving otherwise it's hurts okay
you have Butt Paste in your mouth come
here what are you doing that's yummy oh
my gosh look at this line you guys
seriously that's what the DMV is like I
hopefully didn't have to stand in too
long line cuz I had an appointment but I
got everything done that I needed to
when I first got in there she gave me
the completely wrong paperwork and wrong
number because I had an appointment I
asked someone I was like about how long
on this appointment number and they're
like oh that's like three and a half
hours and I was like what the heck
so I'm back to the window and she's like
oh yeah I gave you the wrong form and oh
yeah I gave you the wrong number so I
was able to do it in about 20 minutes
after that point so I'm so glad I'm out
of that like I can breathe again you
guys well mommy does her makeup
oh he sits in this is he's watching
himself actually you watching Ollie he's
watching yesterday's vlog the only way I
can contain him so funny two years ago
