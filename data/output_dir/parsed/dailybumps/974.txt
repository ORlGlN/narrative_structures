morning guys we got up early and all I
had swim kind of cool because we've been
doing swim twice a week now just to kind
of push things into gear I don't know I
thought it might be a fun little change
he did so good I didn't even have to get
in the water so that was really nice he
did great with his future and now he's
down for his nap and I've been taking it
easy all morning I feel like I tend to
say this a lot but I feel like we're
always running and doing something and
busy and I don't know if it if it seems
like that to you because the things that
we're doing that make us like busy
aren't that big of a deal but it's a
pregnant lady I'm just like I'm so tired
I feel like I need to do nothing but yet
I'm also not very good at doing nothing
I like to like do things today I've just
been kind of relaxing and the Brian is
off to something he's working in the
studio so I'm not to actually go filming
video but I have to do my hair and get
dressed all he's taking a really good
nap so that's good so I should get it
done really sleeping so that means Missy
you need to get to work
hello guys it's been a busy busy day
already I am at a prospective studio
which I may be recording some new stuff
that soon and so I kind of just want to
come in and check it out down here in
Orange County what do you guys think I'm
digging like the block style of shirts
it's cool I dig it all right I'm gonna
go in here
I really gotta pee I just drove like an
hour and I just did my hair and my
makeup and I put on a new shirt and I'm
getting ready to film to talk quietly
when I walk by the door
but actually all he's getting ready to
wake up film so I'm kind of bummed
because it's really hard to film with a
baby and I should have been more
prepared and started this process
earlier when he like went right down for
his nap but I was just in a lazy mood so
my mom's actually headed over to help
watch him which I think I'm I am so
blessed like I was like the best mom
ever
who luckily loves coming over and I love
when she's over and all he loves when
she's over and it's just awesome
and it works out really well because you
know like I am a stay-at-home mom and I
consider my channel a hobby and
something that I enjoy enjoy doing and I
don't really I wouldn't say I consider
it like my job but it is hard to film
when you're the only one home because
obviously if when Bryan's here it's
easier but even if then if he's like
working it's nice when you have help and
it feel I feel bad because sometimes
people I believe people don't understand
why I asked for help if you need help
why I like to ask for help and it's kind
of a bummer when there's people who
don't get that kind of help and they
don't have family that can come over I
feel bad for them but I am someone
that's really key and I actually do have
a mom that totally can and loves coming
over so she's having to watch him and
I'm super out of breath
whoa I this pregnancy is killing me man
I just walked down the stairs and talked
and that's why I'm so out of breath
well I'm stuck in traffic major major
traffic and if I was smart and just got
a fast track like I should have been
doing I could be over there but no I'm
over here with all the slow cars like
everyone on the express lane is zipping
by why don't we have a fast track yet
Missy we need to get one we live in
California and we go this way enough
cheese oh cheese and crackers of cheese
and crackers California traffic this is
just what happens so I had a really
great meeting at the studio I went to
and we're just trying to figure out you
know if I do more music where I would be
doing it at and what kind of space is
available and stuff so but for now my
main focus is getting back home to my
wife and kid also I really have to pee
because I drank this entire bottle of
water it's gone it's in my bladder it's
slowly coming out into my underwear no
it's not I'm holding it all right it
just got done filming and check this out
there is no camera on my iPod right now
and do you want to know why that is
because my camera is just like started
turning off and I had like a full
battery I literally have no idea why
this always happens when Bryan's either
not here or super busy and can't help me
so I had to film with this camera
halfway through so I hope it looks good
hey I hate like switching out like
camera quality in the middle of videos
because it's just I don't know it's
weird I'm going to try and grab myself
I'm like trying to grab my phone and the
sweater there we go and I think all of
us up hopefully actually won't go
because my mom's over and she's probably
like um he didn't even wake up
speaking of he just woke up right as I
got done with my video so that's it
isn't it warm in here no it doesn't feel
minimal it's not reading properly I it
keeps telling me that eighty degrees I'm
like really my boots like I was but it's
not like you how comfy isn't like he's
just so happy you like your bed okay bye
I'm home finally ollie I'm ho gonna give
me a hug
rude when he woke up he came down dad
does it anyway babe can I have a hug
ollie
he's really into the end of home right
now he likes you like home can you say
oh oh he's the alien guy huh I got home
and Missy got something in the mail
check this out you guys
Sly Fox friends actually texted me the
other day in your life which tower what
size shorts as you want yeah these are
swim shorts and they say wow child and
they're like the OLT they're like
old-fashioned looking you know like
old-fashioned cut so cool just like I
don't know just a gift and this one says
I'm the big bro and this is a little bro
yeah that's so cute
you guys are never gonna guess what's
happening right now
Brian and Jarrod are both just
facetiming dinnertime I made these very
yummy friendships with this different
kind of roast beef it was like from the
frozen section but look how thick that
is it's really good it's like thinking
can you see in there yeah oh we're
having dinner with Jared and Ellie
my hair is really messy underneath so
it's probably better for all y'all that
I know right here oh yeah just right at
your night that's very convenient sure
we're having french tips and they're
having Olive Garden on-premise
superjealous
yeah Missy is like give me one of those
breadsticks can you guys just pass it
through the camera
yes breadstick delivery it tastes
different when it goes through the
camera and oh yeah I just never tastes
the same flavor
holy shiz Missy was just looking at the
computer 499,000 we are less than a
thousand away from being from having a
half a million subscribers a million I
don't know how I feel about that half a
million subscribers holy cow
what are you doing kid he's like burying
himself that is insane you guys listen
that was no way I thought it might
actually happen in the middle the night
while we're sleeping so yeah I can't
imagine do you remember when we started
yeah daily vlogging yeah I really wanted
to wait to start vlogging until we were
like kind of past the first-timers oh
yeah I remember that I'm scared and so
we basically wanted to start on January
1st yeah least yet started like January
yeah so and it was crazy it's been like
the changes journey I can't believe that
five hundred thousand like we never
expected to have five hundred thousand
yeah we've always been so happy and
content with the amount of subscribers
that we've had yes like when we had a
thousand we were so excited to have a
thousand and we had ten thousand it was
like we have ten thousand subscribers
yeah and
we've never been like we just had more
subscribers you know we've just been
really happy and content and it's it's
crazy that now it's 500,000 like that's
just number you cannot comprehend really
what is Madison Square Garden 50,000 win
here in Madison Square Garden mr.
because you can't really truly
comprehend it it almost doesn't feel
real
yeah because if you had that yeah now
it's like oh that's another zero yeah
you kind of have to be like that if you
actually were able to comprehend it not
only would you be like wow I got five
thousand people wants to be yeah miss
hot stuff and you would also be like oh
my god I'm fired I thought like people
watching me so you know I mean you can't
pop in it and it's good you can't
comprehend it cuz it yeah and a lot of
people always ask us like what are you
doing or how did it happen and I I don't
know you guys I honestly don't know I
can't I can't I can't I don't have an
answer for that you know it's like
people do it and some some people it
takes off and some people it doesn't you
know and I think the biggest thing is
like just staying true to yourself and
never starting it with intentions of
like like these big dreams or anything
because we never had big dreams about it
we were just like no this is fun and
actually I just used to film everything
all the time
anyway you know and make cool little
montages and and like fun little things
and I was like well why don't we just
start doing that again and put it on
YouTube you know if it's a true passion
