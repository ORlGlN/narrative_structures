haven't talked to you guys in forever
yesterday we did a one-take we get most
of the day off we can actually just like
focus on each other and focus on work
and I really had a lot to catch up on
did a lot of editing good morning guys
um just getting ready for the day Brian
actually is out kind of funny because he
took his camera but he forgot his phone
so it's kind of funny he never leaves
obviously without his phone I mean he's
probably freaking out maybe not maybe he
doesn't even know but I'm like oh my god
what if he doesn't come back what if he
got an accident I'll have no idea like
I'm the one that's pretty good he'll so
hopefully he comes back soon so I know
he's okay because it's really weird we
depend so much on cell phones nowadays
can't just leave without your cell phone
something is bound to happen that's the
one time something bad will happen it
was a good day a good boring day I was
in my sweatpants all day I watched Harry
Potter and the half-blood Prince which
by the way is a really good area Potter
I was thinking I really liked Prisoner
of Azkaban
but half-blood Prince is probably a
close second what's your guys's favorite
Harry Potter movie leave it in the
comments below
Goblet of Fire is kind of cool too but I
cannot wait to go to Wizarding World in
March and I'm just I'm gonna buy

this in gravy for us again today because
I'm pretty much obsessed but a few
people mostly people from overseas is
asking what the heck is this is a gravy

technically like a cookie over there I
had no idea
and then like a muffin to us is like a
sugary like muffin
you know but we call this a bit get it's
not cookies all mashed together with
gravy it's um it's like bread like
weight nothing anything is like a cookie
and then like maybe like brown gravy on
it yeah yeah this gravy uh-huh exactly
yeah but yeah it's really really good

doggies wipe their feet so we're still
decorating um we've got all our box of
Christmas goodies out we were hanging up
presents which looks pretty cool
and I've got lights up and then I wanted
to show you something we started a
tradition years and years ago it started
with every year we would take turns
putting the star on top of the tree so
it's kind of like a tradition between
the kids like me my brother and sister
where every year it would be someone
else's turn but in order to remember it
we have to leave a note in the box to
remind us who did last year and whose
turn it was this year though the note
turned into like like I don't know it's
like a letter from the year before every
year I write a letter and it goes in the
box and we pull it out and this is this
year's letter 2013 I was also really
scared to write this letter because I
had already gone through two losses and
I didn't want to be like I can't believe
next year I'm gonna have a baby because
it and in reality I didn't know if I was
gonna have a baby next year so I know
that this letter has a little bit of
fear in it look at see the panties no
can't even oh no oh yeah I see you've
got your hand in a good position the
role of where are you gonna try you're
gonna try to do it don't hold onto the
blanket I think you did it put his arms

boot in a bit why you guys been asking
me about the horse ranch and I just want
to know that I still totally loved that
place and I do plan to go back and
everything I have just been honestly
kind of dealing with a mental debate
with having to leave my baby like I
honestly as much as I love and enjoy
being at the horse ranch I also hate it
because I just feel so bad because I
have to like leave my baby
obviously Brian's like it's okay go go
do something you really love to do enjoy
yourself but it's like this inner like
fight I have with myself obviously I
still plan to do it but it might not be
as often as I was hoping but we still
have a huge donation that we're gonna be
able to make there because of all the
karma cases that people have purchased
you guys have been going crazy and we've
got a nice little donation that will
definitely be able to give to them
looking at nativity scenes look at this
one it's got baby Chi said you know from

most awesomest Christmas story ever of
karma all our presents out under the
tree I mean like tons of books okay
performing has one present under the
he goes right into the pile starts
sniffing around he grabs his present

unwraps it in the yard and so I was
playing with it yeah it's pretty amazing

like when you hear yourself recorded

to get used to it I've gotten used to
that obviously watching my vlogs and and

lots of random ornaments on it but a lot
of them mean something like this one one
