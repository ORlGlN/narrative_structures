the little Tweety birds he's speaking
about what his future Twitter name is
gonna be
yeah everyone wants us to give him one
but we can't cuz he we want him to tweet
Arthur so he has a hashtag yeah I think
there's a certain age so we're gonna
wait till you can actually send your
first tweet and then you can make a
Twitter okay until then you're just a
hashtag baby here hashtag hashtag baby
this is after I played fifth harmony for
him they put him right to sleep he just
stares at their faces and then falls
asleep and now he's dreaming about
marrying one about my bed which one you
like
there is one that looks like Lea Michele
I think he likes that one right you like
or he like they're bringing down my
present right now and turn into dog and
I've already named her and it's gonna be
peace because we're gonna have karma and
peace and if they've been taking a
really long time you can down here I'm
pretty sure they're trying to get her to
like calm down so that they can give me
the dog so it's so pretty though it's
like sparkly in the side meowing so I'm
pretty sure it's a cat actually that's
okay

Thomas says hi can you oh thank you
thank you
ah this is the last year I'll be able to
use a whole box well next year I'm gonna
have to use two boxes of candles cuz you
only get 24 candles so this is it that's
the true sign that you're getting old
there you know if I can no longer fit my
years in a box of candles then that
means I'm old
apparently I
cannot put the candles on the cake
that's too much control so Cassie's
gonna do for me I guess I just have a
problem I just like to do things myself
