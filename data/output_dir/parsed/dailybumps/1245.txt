I am so excited baby boy he's gonna do
amazing things over James can you say
good morning to everyone we have been
actually finishing up some filming that
we started yesterday
um and so we've been kind of busy crazy
but my mom's here and we're gonna go
look at some houses holy guacamole you
guys you guys you guys you guys you guys
you guys you guys I am so excited mess
see now I've been working on things all
morning for our super-secret special
project thing I'm just gonna set that
down I can't even think because it's so
flustered because it's so excited couple
of weeks ago we hit a hundred thousand
subscribers on this channel you see
concise daily bumps and I was really
excited about this for a couple reasons
number one I mean that's amazing number
two is a while ago YouTube announced
that they were doing silver play buttons
as well as gold buttons they give a gold
play button to all the channels that hit
over a million subscribers and so
they've decided they were going to give
a silver smaller version to everyone who
hits over a hundred thousand subscribers
and when they said that I was like all I
want that I want that button I can do
that I could do that give me a couple
years and we did it in like a couple
months I was really excited I emailed my
partner manager and I said hey how do we
move forward with this and how can we
get a silver play button and then she
informed me that they stopped making
them or stopped giving them I'm not sure
what happened but anyway she said we
were probably not going to get one so I
was very bummed hmm but not a happy note
I logged into my youtube account and I
had a little notification that said
claim your reward and I entered in all
our information and so I think we are
going to be getting
now and I'm really excited because it's
like a physical thing I can hang it on
the wall next to karma or my Keep Calm
and have a beer thing or something I
don't know I can hang it somewhere and
be proud of that accomplishment you know
so my day started off on a good note how
did your start let me know in the
comments let's chat
he's got back um looking at some houses
with my mom it went good I think that
she might make an offer on one of the
houses she's actually made a few offers
on a few houses it's kind of a crazy
market out here people are like
constantly over bidding or I don't know
all kinds of stuff that's been going on
we just got back
Karma's like I want to go outside cuz
you guys are walking and you see that
Bell out there look tagging showed
you've been doing that for like three
hours straight
it's happened the time of its life now
you can get a good look at it outfit
he's got a greasy neck it looks so cute
it look so cute
you got a green bean icon and some cute
little sort like pants jeans pants you
see that booty I feel like I need to put
him in jeans pants more often because he
looks out thinking guilt you look like a
little boy Oh giving karmic kisses look
at that dirty glass I clean this thing
all the time but him and karma both just
put fingers and faces over it and it
just gets dirty all the time and I'm
wearing my little girl show two guys
cute little dress that Bryan loves and I
just don't like think that looks that
great and I'm actually go it's called a
cupcake cover top it's like a little
tank top that just like goes to here and
it's cute we are off to go check the
mailbox you ready you ready dude he's
actually not wearing any pants anymore

them off and now we're going to go check
the mailbox at the keys and you can
start I like this - lets go
thing is not easy to control I'm gonna
get a wagon all this video wagon
you agree we need a wagon cool like I
keep pushing mom like the car other fun
thing that happened today you guys Apple
released that eight point zero point one
update was a small update and I loaded
it as soon as it was released Apple took
the update down because it was giving
people no service and their touch ID
wasn't working on their iPhones anymore
and yeah my phone was completely useless
I had no service I couldn't use touch ID
they took it down so I guess they're
fixing it so if you guys had the option
to up update to eight point zero one
well you're not anymore because they
took it down so I guess the next time
you do see it it should be better but
yeah I had no service on my phone this
morning and that was kind of freaking me
out
uh yeah looks like we got just a bunch
of junk on what is all that okay throw
that in the trash I hate that we always
get junk mail check out Bruce uh what's
his name
hashtag birth you guys this is what he
does all day long he swims and swims
look at him though he's doing really
really good swims in his little cave
he's actually been doing really good
which I'm surprised because he's a fish
and sometimes fishes not really like
went that long oh look at that I didn't
even know it was a little hole there
he likes to hide in his little um leaves
and stuff which i think is really cool
he's doing good he eats his food he's
got some food up there right now and
I've seen an eat so I definitely think
that he prefers the flakes over the
original food that we had got him I
really want to get a GoPro in there
okay comes up I want to get a GoPro in
there and just put it at the bottom and
watch and figure out would that not be
like the coolest thing ever I'll to see

time okay just a little bit dope don't
