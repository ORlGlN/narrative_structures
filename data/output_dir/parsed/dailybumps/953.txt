pool this way I would say he's about 3/4
of the way at this point well it's
really exciting

what a fantastic first day of VidCon
2015 blown away surprised by how many
people we actually met today not crazy
like considering last year I think last
year we had just hit a hundred thousand
subscribers and we met so many people
and now being at almost like a half a
million it's interesting to see the
difference with like how many people we
actually get to talk to in challenge it
was crazy because we were only really
done there for like an hour yeah we were
telling there for yeah we're probably no
more than an hour it's more than just
saying hi and like posing for selfie
I had this one viewer today who blew me
away and she was talking about how the
story about me pursuing to meet my birth
father and how had affected her and how
it inspired her to find and talk with
her birth mother she was able to do that
and then just a couple months later she
found out that her birth mother had
passed away if it wasn't for me having
my experience that I did finding my
birth father she would have never have
been able to like end things on a good
note and I just thought that was so
amazing and it's like that right there
it's like that's why we do it you know I
mean it's like moments like that that
define why we do what we do I'm gonna go
ahead and end today's vlog if you guys
enjoyed it give it a thumbs up tomorrow
we're doing a stage performance at full
screen at 10:30 in the morning so that
should be cool j-money oh no oh no it's
