take some morning's day said something
about num1 do something out
this is home
I am
good morning guys this morning we are
making the kitchen and absolute mess I
am making eggs benedict for cassie cuz
she loves Eggs Benedict and I bought all
the stuff for it and so I'm really
excited I'm so I have ham I got my
hollandaise sauce I'm steaming eggs
instead of poaching apparently I did
that long
oops and Missy's making homemade waffles
and how many eggs of you use babe first
you dropped one on the ground fine no
idea where the egg yolk from the white
that I'll secure white another for the
white and now you're supposed to get
stiff and I don't know how to do that
it's not even ten o'clock and it's a
mess awliyas Mimi feeding you oatmeal is
he eating there we go and now for the
moment we've all been waiting for
this is homemade hollandaise sauce
it's amazing I made it from scratch just
kidding I have no idea how to do that
came from a packet you want more online
okay
Oh paprika on it now perfect perfect
guys he's like it must look like it does
in the picture looks pretty big see all
right there you go Missy are you still
trying to stiffen your eggs yeah
like fluffy yeah Missy your waffles
turned out yeah what do you think is
prettier than this oh yeah yeah turn it
over turn it over before Bluff Oh No
look at all his banana like a monkey
okay mom I'm I just like I might just
like point it at you okay as you guys
know yesterday I went shopping for
playlist live and me and Brian that kind
of did it together
and the problem is shopping with Brian
is that Brian things everything I put on
this cute and I'd have to tell him no
this looks terrible I don't want that I
bought some things and I was like well
I'm going to see what my mom thinks
so I'm now facetiming with her and um I
am trying on clothes with her and being
like is this one look cute there's this
one really bad so I actually have
already nixed one of the dresses that
Brian said looked really cute and I once
I tried it on I was like no that's not
as cute I thought actually also got this
shirt and I didn't even try it on when I
was there but I saw it I was like it I
really like it I really like cut out
like shoulders like I don't know why but
I always love those shirts and so this
one's floral which was kind of like hard
for me to buy but I think I like it all
and then also got these jeans which I
feel like most short girls can totally
relate but they're supposed to be skinny
jeans but then as you get down to my leg
who got all that so it's great like
during the winter because I usually can
just put like a boot on and you can't
even see like the ruffled jean
underneath but I think I'm gonna have to
get these Taylor because I really really
like these jeans but the that just like
totally ruins it especially if I'm gonna
be wearing any kind of like flip-flops
and stuff like that probably do it
myself but I'm not that good at stuff
like that what's he doing this is my lay
there whoa usually when I come in here
you know pops up
he's sleep late they're like what took
you so long
why am I still in here what's up kid
whoa someone is being mr. drama King
used to wake up and smile and greet the
day with a beautiful little laugh are
you so cute
baby I have to ask what is that smell
it's very Seiji hey if the smell is
bliss and and just like yumminess huh
it's very Seiji it smells like an
Italian restaurant in here I'm gonna be
honest it kind of does listen say good
morning day said something about not one
do something I don't know so I have been
spending the morning in my office and
I've been doing something really cool
and I kind of wanted to just talk to you
guys about it so this morning I wrote a
song and it was really weird for me
because it kind of happened how this is
home happened and after I wrote the song
I was like am I ever going to be able to
write another song is that really gonna
happen like am I just gonna be someone
who writes songs and I was like I felt
very uninspired but this morning it kind
of just clicked again and I started
writing things out and thinking things
out and like structure and stuff and I
don't know if any of you watching have
ever written a song but it's kind of
it's different it's not like writing a
story or a novel it's kind of like
writing poetry but at the same time
you're also thinking about how do I want
it to be read or sung and how do I want
the music to listen to what kind of
feelings do I wanted to invoke so it was
definitely an interesting feeling but I
wrote another song you guys and Missy
and I have been sort of talking about
you know where all this is going and I
just have to say like the release of
this is home making that got up to
number 29 on the iTunes pop charts I
never would have imagined I think it was
up there for about two days and I think
it was because people really enjoyed the
song and a lot of people sort of
discovered it for the first time because
it was on the pop charts and I'm just so
immensely proud of where that song is
going and what it's done I don't even
know if I'm allowed to tell this to you
guys but on the day my song was released
I was actually contacted
by two different record companies who
want to meet with me and talk to me and
I can't say who but I've had meetings
with my network and we sort of talked
about where this is going and you know
the pros and cons of signing up for
something like that I don't know I don't
know what's gonna happen I don't know
what I'm gonna do and it's just a very
like surreal moment I remember like
getting those emails and kind of just
what what just happened that's very
weird you know so I think it was a
really good sign that this is something
I definitely want to start pursuing and
it's something I've been wanting to
pursue for a while life just takes you
on an interesting adventure sometimes
that you don't really plan for you know
this is one that I'm really passionate
about and I really love and I'm just
gonna start going with it I'm just gonna
do it and see where it takes me you know
and I love that you guys have supported
this as home so much like thank you guys
so much and I would just I would love
that support and more going into this
next adventure because it could mean you
know more music more videos more
storytelling maybe even somewhere down
the road an EP or an album or a tour or
like these are all options I can't
really believe I'm saying this but
they're all kind of valid options but
yeah I wrote a song this morning and I'm
really excited really cool things are
happening you guys and I don't know I I
just said all that and now I'm
speechless I just I don't know this it's
crazy
all right Brian's in the kitchen again
yeah yeah you're making Katara I'm
making chicken meatballs he's making
chicken meatball those are so easy to
make you just wear all the meat put all
the ingredients and mix it up and then
make little balls yeah when I heard
chicken meatballs I was like that sounds
so good I've never tried anything like
chicken meatballs but then you said he's
gonna douse it in buffalo sauce
well yeah you're supposed to go get in
the slow cooker in buffalo sauce you
really don't know like I'd even do it in
Barbie's I'm not like a big Barbie sauce
fan but I didn't eat it in barbecue
sauce she that wouldn't work okay then
what would what can we put in it to make
it taste good enough buffalo
oh I guess I could just make them like
this can we do that and I'll just get
some and upload all right oh here with
no buffalo sauce okay and then be like
yay you guys convinced him to not do the
buffalo sauce always drinking is green
juice you drinkin almost done with it
good job and I'm making mine and Brian's
right now didn't there all right Missy
chicken meatballs what do you think it'd
look delicious
they smell good too huh try one it might
be a little hot should I come yay yeah I
think you definitely need dipping sauce
I'm gonna dip in buffalo sauce
Missy you should try some maybe just
like a little bit of ranch dressing
Ollie might like these too you know yeah
they're so easy to make so maybe we
could just make some and freeze them and
then heat him up for him you know

they're very good with the buffalo sauce
