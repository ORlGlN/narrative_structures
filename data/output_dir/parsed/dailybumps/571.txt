morning huh yeah just making sound
waffles this morning for the family hey
Olli where we going good morning guys
we're at the dentist today
are you excited he's like I'm not sure
yet I've been really talking about last
HomeAway it was pretty traumatic I'm
hoping this new dentist will be a little
bit better than last time I'm not such
matters
I know yeah oh yeah you totally did he's
like I know her so nice with these done
like
you gotta show your teeth buddy or
chance we gotta make sure they're good
to go and no cavities
well that did not go as planned at all
oli why didn't you want to open your
mouth for the dentist you don't want to
go to the dentist you he not open his
mouth at all I think he was just like
really freaked out really scared they
did want to kind of like hold him down
and just get it done and look inside but
I was like honestly I'm not really
concerned with his teeth he doesn't have
pain we brush every night like I wasn't
like we need to look at his teeth and he
kind of just like asked me some
questions like well we could probably
wait a few months and then try again and
maybe hopefully during those few months
obviously he's older he gets easier to
get at some point also the older he gets
we'll probably just start like really
playing around like maybe I'll even buy
like some tools and we can kind of play
dentist and teach him how to do it he
just was like really freaked out but he
did open them for a couple seconds a
couple times and the doctor was able
just kind of look in and see everything
I mean he said that they looked good
from where he could see but Oliver James

reading some of my comments for my video
today and you know the thing is that I

imagination and even when we're outside
we can be working on our colors and
working on our numbers and stuff like
that but right now he's only three like
once and he needs to play he's have fun
