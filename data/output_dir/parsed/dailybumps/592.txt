that's not like this Kelsey you just

alright the puzzle is coming along but
since then my good friend Michelle came
over and she always does my hair which
is so so nice of her she's so cool but I
also want to introduce you to someone
you don't mind being on the blog right
so my mom's friend is in town and she's
from Indiana and I met her when I was
very very little I think I was we were
moving into a little apartment in
Indiana because my dad was going to
college down there so we've known her
like our whole life but we haven't seen
you guys in 21 years anyone years yes so
they are here visiting and we're really
excited because she's like my one of my
mom's like best friends but they haven't
seen each other in a very very long time
so they're here visiting and we're gonna
spend the day we're gonna barbecue and
have fun day but first I got my hair
done
it's been really bad for a couple days
now so and Finn just woke up he slept so
good
didn't mr. didn t oh and Mimi he's
helping out huh
she just changed your poopy you and see
me I gotta go take a shower
hi hey hi ok ok so me and Tom brought
home at these special pineapples from
Hawaii and yes we've got them on the
plane it was no fun at all it's called a
sugar loaf white pineapple is amazing
and you can eat every bit of it so I
just cut up a lot of it and we're even
eating like the core and everything and
it is so yummy see wait so the core is
in here mm-hmm
oh good it doesn't have as much acidic
so it doesn't like burn your tongue and
your lips all that so probably if you
were like allergic to pineapple you
could probably eat this a little bit
more than like a normal pencil but it's
so so good it just tastes like sugar and
it's so yummy that's why we carried a 38
house back to the airport
so we could get this home and it's so
yummy and we're barbecuing today so
coming hey Ollie I got you a special
present in Hawaii you want to see
alright so I got you and Daddy one and
