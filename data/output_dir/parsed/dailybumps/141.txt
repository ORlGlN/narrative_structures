- Getting a fish!
- We're getting a fish!
Are you so excited?
- Yeah!
- Yay!
We want to pick out a
good fish that's going
to be easy to take care of and we want it
to be super colorful, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- You ready, Finn?
- Yeah!
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
- It is bright out here, huh, Finn?
Good morning, guys.
We are running a little bit late today.
Not too much, just about
four or five minutes late
and it's share day.
What are you sharing today?
- Um, a car.
-  A car?
But it's a car that Papa made.
- Yeah.
-  And what is the letter today?
- D.
- No!
- B.
- C.
- C.
- Yeah, he actually drew a C
for us yesterday at dinner.
And unfortunately, I
forgot shoes for Finn.
(cries)
I was trying so hard to
get everything together
that I forgot Finn's shoes.
Finn is getting ready for music class.
He's very excited.
This is only our third time going and
the last two times he has been very shy.
Kind of just like sat in my lap and like,
kind of glued to me,
just watching everyone.
So I'm hoping that now, by the third one,
he's a little bit more into it and excited
and kind of more comfortable.
He is a little bit of a mess today.
He pretty much just woke
up and I got him dressed.
His hair hasn't been brushed.
(laughs)
He has no shoes on!
Some of the kids don't really
wear shoes in there anyways,
so I'm like, alright, I think
he'll be fine just for class,
but we'll probably have
to just go home after that
so we can get his shoes on.
Are you ready to go in?
- Yeah.
- We're actually listening to
the music class CD right now,
which is always fun, just
makes him a little bit more
comfortable when we hear the song.
He's like, oh yeah!
I listen to these in the car.
So he's excited.
So I just got home with Finn and
we had so much fun at the music class.
But I am actually headed
out again with my mom
because it is her actual
birthday and I thought I'd
take her out and go
spoil her a little bit.
But first, I wanted to show Bryan
some pictures we got of Ollie, and I--
-  Did Ollie--
- Wasn't going to look, but I had to look
'cause they were so cute.
You ready?
- Are they cute?
Oh my God.
-  They're so cute, right?
- Aww.
-  I almost like, literally, cried.
(laughing)
- I'm like tearing up
right now, it's so cute.
-  Let's show 'em, let's show 'em.
Look at his preschool school pictures!
-  He did so good!
-  Like, isn't that crazy?
That's my favorite.
- He did really, really good.
- Like, they're so cute.
He doesn't look like a preschooler.
He looks like a fifth grader.
- Full-on dude.
Who's that?
(mumbles)
Who is that?
- Is that Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- Yeah, he got his picture taken.
- They're so cute!
- Look at his skin tone.
-  I know!
- He's like just so tan all the time.
-  And his outfit is so
cute and his hair is so cute!
-  I know.
(laughs)
-  I love it; I'm obsessed.
We have to pick one.
- What?
-  We can only pick one!
- That's bullcrap.
(Missy laughs)
(techno music)
- I'm alive!
You guys, do I look normal?
Like, I got ready today, I took a shower,
I took care of myself.
I did all those things
that like, normal humans do
when they're not sick out of their minds.
And it feels really good!
What's up, you guys?
I feel like I have been,
like, gone from this vlog for
the past couple days because
my mind has just been focused
on trying to get me better
because I hate being sick.
And it's very difficult being
sick when you have two boys.
It was easy for me because
I have an amazing wife.
Missy did so good, you guys.
And I want you guys to just
leave her a ton of love
in the comments down below
because I'm proud of her because
she took care of me, she
took care of the kids,
and she took care of the
vlog, like, that was,
it was really, really
incredible and I love her and
she's amazing and we
make such a good team and
I'm really grateful for her.
So yeah, leave her lots of love
down below in the comments.
I'm feeling great!
I'm not a hundred percent,
still have a cough.
Cough drops are helping, but
I feel really, really good.
So today I got dressed,
I actually just got Finn down for a nap.
I've been watching him.
We've just been playing.
Missy's out running a
couple errands, and then
we're going to go do a
couple of fun things today,
but the house is like quiet and still,
'cause it's just Finn and I.
So a lot of times, I actually just like to
blast music in my office while I work.
Does anyone else like to do that?
Like, I've been, ever since I've been back
in my office working, I
love just putting on music
and just like, turning
it up, and like, relaxing
and enjoying it and it's been really nice.
And today, I think we are
getting a fish for our fish tank!
Which I am very excited about.
And also, we need water!
The guy who installed our fish tank,
who is awesome by the way.
He thought we would be going
to get fish a little sooner
than we have, so our
water level went down.
And apparently with a tank like this,
you got to have a lot of
water, like, on backup because
it's salt water, but you
don't put salt water in it.
You put regular water in it
and the salt stays in it,
and circulates and stuff.
So, we're going to have
to get a bunch of water,
a couple of tools for the
aquarium, and hopefully,
a little fish that we
can put in this thing.
Look who's home!
- Hey, Ollie!
- Hey.
-  What's up, dude?
How was school?
- Good.
-  Good?
Took a good nap?
- Yep, and he shared Papa's car today.
-  Oh, cool!
The one that he made him?
He carved him?
Yay!
- It went really good, huh?
- You had a good share day?
-  Mama.
- Yeah.
- Finn missed me.
-  What is this?
- A sticker that smells like lemon.
-  It smells like lemon?
Here, Finn, you smell.
(Finn groans)
- Smell it.
- Smell it.
(Ollie sniffs)
- Do you have to scratch it?
- Uh huh.
-  Mm, it does smell like lemons.
(Ollie groans)
- Do you know what that's called?
(Finn groans)
Mm, it's called a scratch and sniff.
Those things have been around
forever, scratch and sniff.
- I know.
- It's so funny.
- Kids love them.
- It's the coolest thing!
Hey, dude!
I missed you!
Look at our family back together!
- Group hug!
Group hug!
- With our two blonde boys.
- I know.
- What, are they adopted or something?
- I know.
- Where you kids coming from?
You haven't even had your
first haircut, have you, Finn?
- Oh my goodness.
(Bryan and Missy laugh)
-  You're so funny.
Hey, Ollie!
- What?
- I saw your school portrait today!
- Good?
-  It's so good!
-  Have you seen it?
- You took such a good picture!
Has he seen it?
Look at that, dude.
- Look how cute you are!
- That's a good picture
of you, huh?
- I'm good.
- That's pretty cool!
His first school picture, babe.
- They're so cute!
- It's a big deal.
- I literally was like, I
shouldn't look at these.
I should wait to like,
look at them with Bryan,
but then I flipped it over and I saw them,
and I'm like oh my gosh, it's so cute!
-  Yeah, that is seriously so cool,
his school pictures.
Look at how cute he is!
Ollie, do the kids at school
like your light-up shoes?
(stomps)
Are they going?
There! That one's going!
Yeah!
Is your other one turned on?
Here, let me turn it on.
Now try.
Yeah!
Do the kids at school like 'em?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
- His teacher today was like,
oo, I like your shoes, Ollie.
-  Aww.
(playful music)
- Getting a fish!
- We're getting a fish!
Are you so excited?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
You and Finn get to pick one out, okay?
- Okay.
We want to pick out a
good fish that going to be
easy to take care of for our
first saltwater fish, okay?
And we want him to be
super colorful, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
You ready, Finn?
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Okay!
- Finn!
You're just like a fish!
-  Hey, Finn!
(playful music)
All right, we are here at
Fish Frenzy with Vince,
and he's going to show me
one of his monster clownfish
that he breeds here in the store.
- Yeah, so this is our
clownfish breeding, back here.
- We're getting a
behind-the-scenes look, you guys.
This is cool.
- These are all our breeders.
This is our more
expensive pair right here.
This is the Picasso Extreme.
-  Aww. Wow!
They look so cool!
Dang.
-  You see all
the different patterns?
-  Yeah! That's so neat.
(playful music)
Look at this one!
So that's the--
-  Gold-banded
maroon, that's a female.
The female's always the biggest.
-  Dude, the guy's
like ten times smaller!
(Vince laughs)
Dang!
That's crazy.
You boys checking out the fish?
(Ollie and Finn exclaim)
- Yeah, look!
-  You like the crabs, huh?
- Yeah, I get that one.
-  Yeah.
Finn?
What do you like?
You like the clownfish?
(Missy laughs)
We already got rock; we
don't need rock anymore.
Look at this fish right here!
I'm falling in love with him.
(laughs)
What kind of fish is that?
- Cow fish.
- A cow fish?
Does it moo?
- Yeah, look it, he's moving right now.
-  No, does he moo?
(laughs)
- Be nice, huh?
- Oh wow.
- Buy something more.
-  But there he goes.
He likes blood worms.
- Wow!
He's gnarly-looking.
- I know, and he's really like, friendly.
Like, every time I go other
there, he, like, comes up, and--
- Yeah, no, real
personable, real personable.
I mean, we have customers that they
actually eat out of their hands.
-  That's so crazy.
Look at these tangs going
crazy on that seaweed!
(laughs)
Isn't that so cool?
- Yeah!
-  They have so much
personality, for a fish.
Whew!
- Whoa!
-  Splashing even!
So excited because we just
picked out our first fish
for our new tank!
(Finn screams)
Finn's very excited too.
Are you excited, Ollie?
- Mm?
- Yeah.
-  Oh.
-  We have all
fishies right down here
and I'm keeping them safe.
And I'm really excited because
we have to do the fish first
and then, in a couple weeks,
we get to start doing anemones,
and coral, and that's when
it really starts to look
like it's own little world.
What, buddy?
- We got a fire crab!
-  No, we got a fire shrimp!
- We got a fire shrimp!
- We got a fire shrimp.
Wait 'til you guys see him!
He's so cool.
- I want to name him Kai!
- Kai?
- Yeah!
-  Like from Ninjago?
- Yeah!
(techno music)
- All right, so we are back home.
We have had our fish acclimating
in the water for about 30 minutes now.
Well, we had to put in
a new heater in there
'cause the one that we
got originally installed
was broken.
- Yes.
-  So, the water's
getting heated and I got the...
I finally got the flow down, I think.
(Ollie coughs)
It's so close to being perfect, you guys,
so I'm just going to
let it sit and see if it
adjusts on its own and
then fix it if I need to.
But, we have all of
our baggies right here.
All the fish are just chilling.
- I like the fire one.
- He's cool, huh?
- Yeah, I do.
- The fire shrimp?
-  We're going to let him go now.
- Yeah!
- So now we're going to use this and
set them in the tank, and
hopefully, it goes okay.
- Yeah.
- No pressure.
- So we cannot let this
water get into here.
-  Yes.
-  Okay, there
goes all the Sebastians.
(laughs)
-  Go on, guys.
-  Aw!
Look at 'em!
(Finn yells)
There they go!
- Welcome to your
new home, crabbies!
Keep it clean!
- All right, we got our crabs in,
and now it's next, the shrimp.
- Kai.
-  So Kai is our fire shrimp
and he's going to keep everything clean.
He's going to clean
the fish and stuff too.
Let's put him in!
There you go, buddy.
There you go!
Look at him swim!
-  Oh my goodness!
-  What do you think, dude?
- Um, good!
-  He's so cool!
- Does he breathe fire?
(Missy laughs)
-  I don't know.
Sure.
You know what?
-  He's going to clean our fish.
- Yeah, so he's a lot
like that little crab
from Finding Nemo.
Remember, who spins the fish
and gets them all clean?
-  Yep.
-  He's going to clean the fish
and everything in there.
- Clean?
- Look how cool he is!
-  It's pretty clean in there now,
so he might be bored for a while.
-  Yeah, he's checking
out his home right now.
- It's so cool, he's exploring for real.
- Picking his room.
- That is so cool.
Yeah, his big brother in real life.
(laughs)
Or fish life.
-  All right, there's our foxface.
I'm going to name him Felix.
He looks cool.
- Look at him!
- He's got like a mohawk.
Play nicely.
- He's checking it out.
He's hiding; he's shy!
All right.
-  That's our
white designer clownfish.
We're going to name it Pearl.
-  That's Pearl.
She's so pretty.
-  And she could
be a boy or a girl.
(Missy laughs)
Because clownfish, all of
our clownfish are unsexed,
so they could either turn
into a male or a female.
- Yeah.
- It's really interesting.
And then these are our two clownfish!
-  Yay!
-  They've got energy!
-  Nemo and Marlin!
(Bryan laughs)
(Missy laughs)
-  They're so cute, and
they'll literally be best friends.
-  Yeah, aww, look at them.
- We have a couple fish in there
now, so we're just going to
let them adapt before
we start adding more.
- Yeah.
- But the thing about
saltwater fish, too, he said,
is they just keep growing.
- Yeah.
- So, these fish are
going to get big.
- Yeah.
- They're going to be fun.
Felix is like, freaking out.
- He's super shy!
- He's, like, so shy.
-  Aww.
(techno music)
-  If you guys have not seen this
epic box fort castle that Corbin did,
go check out their channel,
link in the I-card.
This is impressive, dude.
(Bryan laughs)
It even has a working
drawbridge, look at that.
-  It literally only
took me like five seconds.
(Bryan laughs)
- Sure.
Okay.
Good evening, June, how are you?
Look at that smile she's giving me.
- I know.
- You haven't seen me
in a while, huh, baby?
(laughs)
Decided to come over and
play for a little bit.
What are you putting on?
- They want to be a knight and dragon.
-  Aww.
(Finn roars)
Oh no, we got a dragon on the loose!
-  Oh my gosh!
-  That is so cute!
- Is that a fire-breathing dragon?
-  Rawr!
You like the dragon?
Here, you can hold this, and then
you can control his head, see?
Keeps his head up.
June likes it.
Like, okay, cool.
Ollie?
What are you doing?
(laughs)
- I'm a knight!
-  You're dressing
up like a knight?
That is so cute.
(laughs)
Looking good, dude!
So you're going to protect June, right?
(Kelsey laughs)
Okay.
Oh no!
All right, Ollie.
This is your box fort castle, okay?
You got to keep it safe, right?
- Uh huh.
- For June.
- Yes.
-  Okay, well you better be careful
because I heard there's a dragon!
(Ollie screams)
Get in there!
Get in there, dragon!
-  Close the drawbridge!
-  Yeah, probably
should have shut the door, bro.
(adults laughing)
That was your first fatal mistake.
-  First line of defense failed.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Attack the castle!
(laughs)
(lighthearted music)
So, Kelsey and Corbin
don't have sippy cups
because they just have June.
- We don't have a toddler, okay?
-  Yeah! It's fine!
So Finn really wants some milk, so--
-  He's like the Boss Baby!
You got to tip it back, baby.
-  He's like, whoa!
-  If only you could
have taken that when you were
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 months.
- Twirling the hair.
- Twirling his hair.
That is so cute.
- He's going to go to bed.
He's going to go take a nap.
-  He's going in
the box fort, to relax.
Hi!
Why are you so silly?
(laughs)
You are so silly.
Are you silly too, Finn?
Oh, is this for Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Oh!
He brought your water to you.
That was nice, huh?
I think that's all for the vlog, huh?
Did you have a fun day?
Yeah?
I loved seeing your school
pictures; those were cute.
And we got fish!
We got new fish, Finn!
Thanks for watching
today's video, you guys.
Hope you enjoyed it.
If you did, be sure to
give it a big thumbs-up!
Thumbs-up!
(laughs)
Subscribe, leave a happy
friendly comment below,
and we'll see you manana.
All right, Finn, can you do the bye-boop?
Say bye!
Say bye!
- No no no no.
- No? No?
You can't do it?
- Yeah.
- Okay, Ollie?
Finn doesn't want to do it
tonight, you want to do it?
- Bye...
Boop!
