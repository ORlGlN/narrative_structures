- And we've got a camera here, okay?
-  Yeah.
- It's really cool.
-  Yes!
- We've got tons of fun footage.
(exciting electric guitar music)
-  Aw, he's sad, 'kay?
(Ollie cries)
- Aww.
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ (This is our life) Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
-  Good morning, Daily Bumps fam!
This got a little crazy last night.
Missy designed the most
epic haunted maze ever
for our Halloween party
and it's all torn down now.
We've been tearing up the party!
Good morning, you guys!
We had so much fun.
This is all of the tarp from it.
- A lot of tarp.
-  So much cool stuff, too.
Check this out.
This is that tub of black Orbeez.
- We got this tub for
free from Craigslist.
-  I know, isn't that amazing?
- It is cool.
My dad was like, oh, should we paint it?
I'm like, no, it looks so cool!
And people were so scared
to put their hands in this.
-  I know.
- They didn't know what
it was because it's black.
Like, Orbeez aren't normally
black, so this was really cool.
-  And then we had
a key attached to a string
so people had to grab
the key, unlock the box,
pull out the tape.
- There's was just like a
really cool girl in here
that was totally up to just sit in here.
-  Yeah, I love your
new tattoo, babe, by the way.
- Oh, thank you!
No, if you haven't
watched Kelsey and Corbin,
I got a tattoo, we got matching tattoos.
-  Kelsey and Missy
got matching tattoos.
- So, make sure you guys
go check out their vlog,
We'll have it linked up here
so you can go see it too.
-  Look at this contraption.
- This is like my dad,
my dad's just a genius.
Anything that I'm like,
hey, can you do this?
He's like, yeah!
And then he does it.
So, he made a two-way mirror for us.
-  Yup.
- And he made it himself.
-  We bought a
two-way mirror off of Amazon
and he cut a hole in this whole thing.
We wall-papered it.
- Yeah, we wall-papered it.
-  We set the scene, so we had
The Ring lady brushing her hair.
- The mom, brushing her hair.
- Brushing her hair in the mirror
and then the other person
had to go and do it.
- And then we've got a camera here.
-  Yeah.
- Which I think is really cool.
-  Yes.
- We've got tons of fun footage.
-  We had a camera here so,
we got a lot of people scared last night
once it switched from
mirror to see-through.
- Yeah.
-  And the person
behind scared them,
it was so cool.
- It was really cool
and my dad rigged it so
she just flipped the switch
and like, her light went on.
- Yeah you push one button
and the lights switch.
I was like, that's genius.
- Yeah.
- So, what we're gonna do,
we have so many good scares
from last night at the Halloween party.
I didn't get a chance to
put them in that vlog,
so I'm gonna do all the fun
scare montages right here.
Enjoy, you guys.
(spooky guitar music)
-  She's brushing her hair.
Just stand there and brush your hair,
that's all you have to do.
(screams)
-  Whoa, yes!
(screams and laughs)
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(screams)
(laughs)
-  And then this was
a, like a hallway of bugs.
- So yeah, we, I spent a lot
of time putting these bugs up.
We stapled hair, bugs, and
then we sprayed it in here
with the most--
-  Stinky stuff.
- You could smell.
Like, I smelled like it
all day I'm pretty sure.
-  Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)
And then for the final scene we have
like, a little living room
set up with a guy in a chair.
- This, to me, was the, probably
the best part of the maze.
-  Yeah, we had
Samara come out of the T.V.
And look, it's literally just a T.V.
We built this; Missy's dad built this.
- Yep, my dad built this.
-  And then we picked,
like, the perfect foil.
- You can change the channel.
Change the channel!
-  Yeah, I know, right.
We had strobe lights
going, it was really cool.
- It literally looked like
there was a T.V. and it was on
and then Samara climbed out.
- Samara climbed out of it.
It was really good.
It was like a production, you guys.
It was really fun to be able to do.
- I mean, I wish, vlogged me
and Kelsey going through this
because Kelsey's is
probably, her number one fear
is The Ring, like, for sure.
- It's like one of the scariest
movies from our generation.
- Her face, she almost started crying.
-  Aww.
- She was so scared out of her mind.
I was like, oh, my gosh, calm down!
She's just a record.
(Bryan laughs)
- Yeah, that was definitely a good time.
We had so much fun with
our friends, our family.
Like, Missy, your whole family was here!
- Oh, yeah.
- Like, that was so neat.
- Everyone dressed up
and really got into it.
- Everyone got into it and we have
some amazing photos
from the photobooth too.
(spooky guitar music)
- Okay, you guys.
So, we just got back from a adult spa trip
with all of our friends
and we had so much fun,
and the boys are back home!
- Ha, ha, ha.
-  Hi, Finn, what are you singing?
Think he was singing
"This is Halloween," huh?
Yeah.
It's like kind of late in the evening but
I was craving cereal, so I poured myself
a big bowl of cereal
and I used all the milk.
I'm sorry.
We're all out of milk.
- That's alright, I know.
-  And now Ollie's digging
in the Fruit Loops, right?
(Bryan laughs)
- Hey Ollie, did you have fun last night?
- Mmhmm.
-  Tell them what you did!
- I watched a movie.
And I go to bed all on my own!
-  At Mimi and Papa's, right?
- Yeah with Mimi and Papa.
-  Well, that's so cool.
Finn and Ollie had a little sleepover
last night with Mimi and Papa.
How did they do?
(Missy laughs)
- We need a bigger bed.
(Mimi laughs)
-  Oh, they need a bigger bed.
- We're gonna need a bigger bed.
- It was my dad and Ollie in one bed,
and they have a king bed
and it was too small.
And Finn and my mom in the other bed and
he was up all night, so.
-  Aww, the kids had fun though.
- It was their very first sleepover, so.
-  Yeah.
-  They were not ready.
-  Finn's got a little bit more
time before he can do sleepovers.
Is he hogging all the cereal?
-  Ollie, let him have some.
- Yes!
-  Dig in there!
Get your Fruit Loops!
(Bryan laughs)
Fruit Loops are the best snack ever, huh?
(Bryan laughs)
(calm music)
- Ollie's sad because
Mimi and Papa are leaving.
- Don't cry.
- He just loves them so much.
-  Yeah.
-  We had a fun time.
- Did you have so much fun with Papa?
- And yesterday when I made them dinner,
they ate all their dinner.
-  What!
- And he finished first.
- You ate all your food?
- And then he got dessert.
What did you have for dessert?
(Ollie whines)
- Skeleton and a Halloween pumpkin cookie.
-  Aww.
- And I was like, woo,
you ate all your dinner!
- Good job!
- Yeah, good job buddy.
- Well Mimi's gonna go home and then we're
probably gonna see her tomorrow, you know?
-  Okay?
(Ollie cries)
-  Aww.
Bye, Mimi and Papa!
(chill electronic music)
-  This is probably one of
the cutest things I've every seen.
Luna, chillin' on Ollie's bed.
Mama's reading you guys a bed time story?
- My daddy's so special.
Is daddy special?
-  Aww, thanks, dude.
- I tell him each day.
-  I love your pajamas.
- Just how much I love him in every way.
Do you tell daddy you love him every day?
- Mmhmm.
I love you, da-da.
- I love you buddy.
(kiss sounds)
I love both of my boys.
- Kids are in bed!
I think Finn is actually
still crying a little bit,
but hopefully not for long,
he's very, very tired.
It has been such a long weekend!
My house is still completely torn apart.
Things are, like, still totally a mess.
But, I just have to
say, I had such a blast
at the Halloween party.
I think it turned out so great,
but I also am so happy that it's over.
I'm so tired, I'm just so, like I've been
running like crazy and so stressed
and so it's just nice to
like, ahhh, okay, I'm done!
I don't have anymore, things
I need to work on or do.
We still have Halloween coming up,
so we're excited about
that but it's pretty chill.
I did, however, want to show you guys.
We didn't really vlog much on my birthday
but I had a super special day.
The boys and Bryan just
were so good to me.
I got a couple little gifts.
We went to a really fun family dinner.
But I wanted to show you
this really special gift
that Bryan got me.
So, he got me this
beautiful Tiffany locket
with an M on it, which I love.
And let me open it up.
So this is the locket
and this is the inside.
It's basically, just, it opens up
and there's just two
little spots for pictures.
And I love it.
I think this is something
that is so special.
And something that I can
totally pass down to like,
my daughter, or my daughter-in-law,
if I don't have any daughters.
But, I just think this is so cool,
such a timeless gift that Bryan got me.
And so I'm like, I really love it.
It's super special.
Yeah, I'm just really thankful for that!
The boys did get me a Switch as well
and I have been obsessing over
the new Mario Odyssey game.
So good.
Let me know if you guys are playing that.
But, I did wanna as you guys,
what pictures do you think that
I should put in the locket?
I've been trying to decide.
Should I put like, a family photo?
But it's really tiny.
So I'm like, that might be too many faces.
Should I do like, Bryan and the boys?
Or, the animals?
I don't know.
Give me some ideas down in the comments.
Let me know what I
should put in my locket.
But, yeah, I'm just super excited.
I can even put, like, my grandparents.
Oh, that would be so cute, too.
I don't know what I'm
going to put in there.
But, anyways, it is time to relax.
I get to watch shows and just chill.
Bryan's making me a delicious
dinner, so excited for that.
But anyways, make sure you
give this video a big thumbs up
if you enjoyed it and we'll
see you guys tomorrow!
Bye-eeee!
Boop.
