-  Good morning, merry Christmas!
- It is Christmas morning, and these boys
slept so good last night in their bed.
Hey Ollie, good morning.
- Good morning.
-  I love you.
- I love you too.
- Are you so excited for Christmas?
- Yeah!
-  Okay.
- Merry Christmas.
-  What's going on out here?
- Look!
-  Whoa!
- He disappeared in the cage, look!
-  (whispering) What in the world?
-  What happened, Ollie?
- I don't know.
-  The cage fell last night.
You guys, there's a note from Santa!
-  Really, what did he say?
- Okay, it says, dear Ollie and Finn,
you boys are so silly!
You can't catch Santa!
Nice try though, ho, ho!
Fred has reported that you both
have been very nice this year.
Keep it up!
Merry Christmas, Santa.
P.S. Nice cage, very festive. (laughs)
I think he thought it was really funny
that you guys tried to catch him, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  He obviously
didn't fall for it (laughs).
- We should have known
you can't catch Santa.
- Stop, guys!
-  Whoa!
-  What is that?
- What?
That is quite the barrier.
Ollie, you wanna know what it says?
-  What?
-  It says, "No peeking!"
-  Did you peak?
- Yeah.
(laughter)
- I think they peeked under there.
- Alright, we're gonna open this.
(gasps) Looks like there's gonna be
some fun to be had though
here, this morning, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  One, two, three, go!
-  Merry Christmas!
(soft guitar music with sleigh bells)
-  Look who's all here, guys!
(laughter)
Merry Christmas, guys!
Whoa, what?
-  Finn, what is that?
(relatives talking)
- I did not buy that.
That is so cute!
-  Is that from Santa?
- Yeah.
-  He brought
you a little roadster?
That's so cool.
You can zip around the house.
Look, it steers even, that's cool, huh?
Go say good morning and merry
Christmas to everyone, Finn.
(upbeat music with sleigh bells)
Seems like there's a pile of
presents that we haven't seen.
- I set all of this up, but that is new!
(laughter)
- What happened, Ollie?
- They ate the cookies.
- And most of the milk, huh?
- Ollie, did you check the reindeer food?
- Yeah.
- You should go see what it looks like.
(Ollie laughing)
What!
Dasher and Prancer must have been
eating their corn this morning, huh?
- Yeah.
- It is cold out here!
We may not have a white
Christmas here in California,
but we definitely have a cold one.
(laughing)
It is so funny that
Finn just hops right on
this little roadster car and drives away.
Oh, look at the steering wheel!
It's all decorated.
That looks like Santa's wrapping paper.
(upbeat music)
Alright, we are going through stocking.
What'd you get, Batman?
- Yeah.
-  Ooh, a Pez dispenser, cool.
And what else did you get, Finn?
Oh, a bag of unicorn farts cotton candy?
(Ollie shouts)
What are those?
- These are dinosaurs.
-  Oh that's so cool.
(Finn laughs)
You got a Batman Pez?
- Yeah.
-  Nice.
(upbeat music with sleigh bells)
- My stocking had a little
baby can of WD-40 in it.
That's pretty genius, thanks Santa.
Finn's stocking is basically bottomless
when it comes to him.
What is this?
You got a nose, a silly nose?
-  My goodness!
-  And who is this, Luke Skywalker?
Cool.
Reach in, reach in, oh,
reach in, what'd you find?
Whoa, cool!
(Finn shouts)
BB-8!
Hey Finn, look what else
is in here, you wanna see?
It's Chewbacca!
-  Oh my goodness, cute!
- Chewy.
- Do, do, do, you go (plays kazoo).
Can you do it?
Do, do, do, he's like,
no way, that's weird.
(laughs)
-  Alright, Finn's
got this cool sucker.
I'm gonna show him what he looks like.
Look at the screen!
(laughter)
Is that you?
You got one too?
(laughter)
-  That is so cool.
- Nice smile, dude.
Time to pass out presents!
Oh, that one's for you! (laughs)
(Finn shouts)
We have breakfast in the oven right now.
I am drinking my English
Breakfast tea and biscotti.
Check this out, Missy's
drinking hot apple cider
in her "Aye Sassenach" cup that Teralyn,
which is really cool.
And we are passin' out presents.
(Finn yells)
Alright, the boys are gonna
practice opening these two!
Rip 'em open, rip 'em
open, what'd you get?
- I got something.
-  Whoa, you got a grabber!
- It's a claw!
(Finn shouts)
-  You got one too,
Finn, oh, it's a claw?
- Yeah. I wanted one of
these for three weeks.
-  For three weeks
you've wanted this? (laughs)
- Very specific, three weeks!
-  Whoa, you got a claw! (laughs)
- Wow, that's a big one for me.
-  Yes it is!
Are you so excited?
Well don't open it yet, we gotta wait.
Wait your turn, okay?
Alright, go ahead Finn, you
started unwrapping it already.
(laughs)
- Wow!
-  Wow, who is it?
-  It's Coco!
-  Lemme see, Finn, lemme see!
(laughs) He just looked at me like, what?
- Whoa!
-  Coco.
-  Oh, look at
that, that's so cool!
Merry Christmas, buddy.
Oh, he's opening that one?
Alright, I guess it's starting, guys.
Open it!

-  What?
- Aquaman!
-  Aquaman!

edition though, see?
(murmuring)
-  Oh, it's a Pez dispenser.

-  Alright, the boys really want
Daddy to open this present they got him.
- What did you get me, boys?
What is it?
It's a Cozmo!
-  Oh my goodness,
your own little robot!
- Ooh, collector's edition, liquid metal?
-  You think it
would get along with Geebo?
- It has a thing.
Maybe.
That's so cool, that's from you guys?
- Yeah.
- That's so cool, thank you so much.
Give me hugs.
(Missy laughs)
Thank you, thank you for the robot, Finn.
(laughter)
-  I'm not putting
my toy down! (laughs)
- Daddy loves robots.
Alright, boys, we have two presents here
from Santa that need opening.
You wanna open that one, Ollie?
- Yeah.

You wanna open it?
Alright, rip it open, Finn.
Oh, you wanna help him, Ollie?

- So, I have a gift here from Pam so-
-  Pam, who's Pam?
- Pam's one of my chickens, I'm like-
-  Wait, Pam, or Pan?
- Pam.
- Wait, what do your chickens
get you for Christmas?
- One of my chickens got me a gift.
-  What?
- I'm kinda nervous what's in there.
I'm wondering if it's like,
fertile eggs or something,
'cause I know she really
wants more chickens.
Oh gosh, what if it is an actual chicken?
You can't just put chickens
in boxes, you guys.
- Oh, I don't hear anything, so...
- She's a pretty good decorator.
- I know, she's such a good wrapper.
Oh my gosh, you actually got one?
- She got you that.
-  I didn't do
anything, what'd Pam do?
Oh, that's so cool!
- Do you know how many, like, Tweets
I get a day when I show
me bringing eggs in?
I usually drop at least one, maybe.
-  I know, 'cause you're so clumsy.
- It's like a little apron, with slots
to put my eggs so I don't drop 'em.
-  And it's a nice color.
- I love this!
-  I like that.
- She's really tired of you
wasting all her hard work.
- I know.
I'm gonna need a spot to hang this,
so I can just grab it, put
it on, go get my eggs...
-  Totally.
- Oh my gosh, this is so cute.
-  Finn, this is from Ollie.
He picked this out just for you, okay?
- Wow.
-  Ollie, remember
you picked this out for him?
- Yeah, it's the jungle crew.
-  That is so cool, huh, Finn?
- Open it.
- Wow.
-  Finn, say "Thank you, Ollie."
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.
-  Alright, this is from me,
to my brother, and my dad, and Bryan.
It's from Coach.
-  Oh, dang.
- Ooh, ooh, little bit
different this time.
-  Yeah, little different.
-  Oh, I like this a lot.
-  And it turns,
it's reversible, guys.
So it's a belt, yep, there ya go.
- Nice, thanks, babe.

at all times, no. (laughs)
Alright, this gift is from
Ollie and Finn to Mimi.

Have fun opening that
duct-tape box (laughs).
He's actually using a new
knife that Cassie just got him,
which is coming in very handy.
That's what we're gonna
do, we're just gonna
give you tools and things to put together.
(upbeat music with sleigh bells)
- Ready?
-  Alright, this one is from Finny!
- Oh, it better be Jamie,
it better be Jamie.
-  Finn, Finn knows what it is.
- There's that, thank you!
I love it.
-  Just so you
know, he had to search
a lotta comic book stores for that one.
It's pretty rare, actually. (laughs)
- Oh my gosh, I think it's so cool.
Where's my, oh, he took my Claire.
-  That's so cool,
you have the whole set now.
- Yeah, this is so fun.
-  Hey, babe, you need
help opening this present?
- Yeah, sure.
(knife clicks)
(Missy yells)
So scary!
-  Nice knife
from Papa, thanks, Papa!
- Wow, that cuts really easily.
-  Like butta. (laughs)
- Put that away.
Cashmere gossamer scarf, that's it?
-  It's a cashmere scarf, feel it.
- Wow, this is cool, I love it.
It's perfect for California
'cause it's not too cold.
-  Yeah.
- And it's fashionable.
I love the color.
- The color.
-  I did good with the color?
- Thank you.
-  You're welcome, baby.
Finn's opening a big one!
Nice, Go, Go, Smart Wheels!
What do you say, Finn?
- Thank you, Mimi.

You're getting really good
at opening presents, Ollie.
I am very impressed as to how these boys
are doing on this Christmas morning.
What is it?
(gasps) Whoa, that's really him?
That's so cool!
You got Miguel!
-  Alright, Mimi's turn.
What do you think it is, Finn?
- You got me an Apple watch?
- You got an Apple watch!
- I feel like it was time, you need one!
(laughter)
You kinda mentioned that
you should totally have one.
-  Missy's opening
a package from Jenny M.?
I don't know if she knows a Jenny M.
Do you not know a Jenny M.?
- Oh!
-  Oh, could it be Jamie's sister,
Jenny, who likes to cook?
- Oh my gosh, that's so funny.
(Bryan laughs)
That is so cool.
- Now we can make all the super
yummy things from Outlander.
- I think this'll just be fun to have
in the kitchen, but yeah, this is fun.
-  And there's a
forward by the author, too.
- I don't, I've heard Scottish food is
a little interesting, so
if you're from Scotland,
tell me if your food's good.
-  Yeah, ooh, those look good.
Whoa, you got dragon?
- Yeah!
-  That's so cool.
(paper tearing)
Wow!
Finn, what'd you get?
(boys shout)
Batman!
- What is it?
-  They're Allbirds!
Oh, they're Allbirds?
-  They're the world's
most comfortable shoes.
- Whoa, these look so comfortable.
-  They are the
most comfortable shoe.
-  They're kinda like
slippers with a hard sole,
so they're good for lounging.
- The boys have the same
ones, I have the same ones,
Bryan has the same ones,
we can all be matching.
They are very comfortable.
- Thank you, these are awesome.
-  You're welcome.
- What is it, what is it?
-  It's Crazy Toaster game?
- Yeah.
-  Ollie and Finn got you a-
-  Ollie and Finn
got you a skateboard!
Finn, what'd you get, a super smile set?
- Yeah.
-  For your Batman toothbrush?
We got you a speaker!
-  (cheers) So you
have something to listen to.
-  It's the cool
new green one, too.
Finn, what'd you get?
Lemme see, show me.
Oh, it's another Go Go Smart Wheels?
That's cool.
Say that you, Mimi and Papa.

Wow, you're own dragon.

that matches yours, Ollie.
- Yeah.
- Ollie is a pro at Christmas, look.
He's putting all their toys
in a neat pile over here,
and Finn's like, I just
wanna play! (laughs)
-  Alright, Bryan's
opening one from me.
What do you think it is Ollie?
- I don't know.
(Missy laughs)
- Come on, Ollie, you don't know?
-  Never seen you
do that before. (laughs)
- Paper!
Oh, cool!
Is it a...oh, it's everything

What a good present, Ollie.

Those just came with them, yeah.
- Those are just stock
photos, those model people.
- Do I know these people?
-  Yeah, I shoulda got you the ones
that you know before, but
I just didn't have time.
-  He's pretty cute, though.
I think I'm gonna totally...
-  You should just keep 'em.
- I should just keep 'em.
- I mean, they're cute, I
have some in Finn's room that,
you know, I've basically
claimed as my child.
(laughter)
Why do I keep getting
gifts from random people?
-  What are you talking about?
Who's that one from?
- Uh, this one's from Mario.
-  (laughs) Okay, I dunno.
- Mario, is there
something we should know?
Awkward.
- I know, I'm like, is this like,
a guy named Mario, or is this Mario...
Ooh, two red ones, I like it!
-  Yeah, red switch controllers.
- I was never like a huge
fan of the pink and green,
so yeah, this is fun.
-  Yeah, those ones are cool.
Good job, Mario.
Ollie, what'd you get Aunty?
- A bracelet.
- You got me a bracelet?
-  That's so cool,
and it says "Aunty" on it.
- Aw, it says, "Because
I love you, Aunty."
-  Aw.
- Thank you, buddies.
- You're welcome.
- Alright, Missy is opening her present
from me and the boys,
very carefully. (laughs)
- You're like so, excited.
Oh my goodness.
-  What is it?
- Oh my goodness, what is
this, what does this mean?
-  It's a horse bridle.
- Oh my goodness!
- Why?
- Am I getting a horse?
-  So that you
can get a horse, babe!
- That's the first, that's-
- Oh my God!
- Don't put it, that's
actually not how it works.
We'll put her in lessons.
- I can go like this.
-  Do you like it?
That's pretty though, right?
- Oh my gosh, it is so pretty.
Oh my God, I'm freaking out.
-  Hey Ollie, guess what?
- What?
- We're getting a horse!
-  Really?
- Oh my gosh, oh my goodness.
-  Yeah.
- Okay, give me a minute.
- Missy's been talking
about a horse forever,
so I figure, well, I'm
gonna get her started.
- Oh wow, this is so, this is so great.
- I mean, I feel like that'd be a little
fun journey for us, right?
To be able to go look at horses and...
- This is just so exciting.
This is like, it!
This is happening.
-  Isn't that cool, Finn?
- Yeah.
- You wanna ride on a horsy too?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
I love you.
- I love you.
This is so, I just like-
- I'm excited to pick
out a horse with you.
- I know, I can't believe
I'm like, I'm, like,
picturing my horse is gonna wear this.
This is so pretty.
Oh, it's so cool.
-  I like it, it's
kinda like, Outlander-y.
It's very vintage.
- It's like vintage-y.
Oh, it's so pretty.
-  What'd you get, what
do you think it is, Ollie?
- I don't know.
- I'm really excited for
him to open this one.
This is a really cool one, Ollie.
- Wow!
- His face!
What is it?
(Bryan laughs)
-  Your favorite treat!
- Did Daddy get you Pringles?
- Yeah.
- Is that pretty cool?
-  You like Pringles, right, buddy?
- Yeah.
- Merry Christmas, dude.
- Merry Christmas.
- He's lucky I didn't wrap a banana.
Jimmy is opening a present
from Leo to him and Zuri.
- Oh, it's a cat toy.
Sack? She'll love this.
-  Oh cool.
- If she sees anything she can crawl into,
she'll crawl right in.
-  Wait, really?
That's so cute.
Alright, Ollie, this is from Daddy, kay?
It says, "Do not open until
December 25th, no peeking!"
But, today's December 25th (mumbles).
(murmuring)
-  Oh, that's a cool hat.
- Do you like it, dude?
- Yeah.
-  Wow.
- Smells like leather.
-  That looks cute on you!
- That looks so cool on you, dude.
Look, it's Darth Vader.

- Yeah.
- Oh that's so cool, I love you.
- Love you too.
-  Ollie is all Star Wars-ed up.
He's got all the Star
Wars stuff, don't you?
- Yeah.
-  Bet you didn't
know what that was, Papa!
The man, the myth, the legend!
Finny, what'd you get, a chicken?
(Finn shouts)
(laughter)
-  Especially if Momma got it.
(chicken toy squawking)
-  What'd you just get, babe?
- My mom just got me a Pooch Selfie,
and it clips on my phone and
Karma will totally do this.
-  Oh, so it's a ball.
- Yeah, it's a ball.
-  So you can capture the perfect
selfie with your pet! (laughs)
- So you can selfie...
I'll literally just say
"ball," and he'll be like...
Like, for real.
-  That's genius.
What are you gettin', Finn?
(Finn shouts)
(murmuring)
Yeah!
He's opening his present from me!
-  Alright, what'd you get, Jimmy?
- Okay, it's one of these ones.
- It's one of those
crates that Bryan's been
getting everyone, but
it's a little different.
-  So what'd it come with?
- I got glasses, so
it's probably something-
-  We got glass-wear, ooh.
I feel like you're gonna
need to go outside for this.
-  Smash me.
-  What else did it come, a hammer?
-  A hammer.
-  And what else?
- Something that says, "Smash Me."
-  And then, something in there that
declares that he is great.
You are great.
-  So you basically
have to smash that giant
concrete gift card to get what you want.
- Um, I feel like I
have to do that outside.
(laughter)
-  Yeah, probably outside.
- It's pretty cool though.
The boys are so excited to help
Uncle open up this concrete thing.
- Alright, see how much pressure I need.
(hammer smacking)
-  Oh my gosh.
Oh, he got it!
(hammer smacking)
-  There ya go.
-  What's in it, what's in it?
- Alright, let's see what we got.
-  It's a gift card.
- Alright, it's a gift card...
- Alright, we have finished unwrapping
all the presents from
all the family members.
We have a pile of Santa gifts that still
need to be opened, but there is one
very exciting gift that
we are about to receive.
We are four away from hitting
three million subscribers,
- Oh my goodness.
- On this YouTube channel,
and I'm kinda freaking out.
- How crazy that it ended
up, that it's gonna happen-
- On Christmas Day!
- On Christmas, like, that
is a Christmas present.
My mom's holding it up right now.
It's three, oh, four.
-  Four more,
we only need four more!
-  Three more!
-  That is so cool.
- This is so exciting.
-  What an amazing Christmas gift.
- Ollie, did you know that we're about
to hit three million subscribers?
-  Do you even
know how to fathom that?
- What does that mean to you?
- Um, I don't know.
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Do you remember all those-
- Oh, one!
- Oh, someone else!
There it is!
-  Three million!
(shouting)
- Thank you, guys!
- Merry Christmas!
We just hit three million
subscribers on this channel.
- You guys actually got
us a gift for Christmas!
- That's amazing, seriously,
thank you guys so much.
That's incredible, three
million, babe, wow!
- I think it was like-
-  And on Christmas
morning, like, that's crazy.
- I know, I mean, I think it
was like, what was it, like,
six years ago on, like,
I remember near Christmas
we were talking about
starting daily vlogging.
-  Yeah.
- How long, was it five?
- It was actually five years,
'cause we're about to hit
five years of daily vlogging in January.
- So we started talking
about it in December,
and it was like, I don't
know, I don't know.
- You were just barely
pregnant with Ollie,
and you were so nervous
to start a channel.
- I was so nervous.
I was like afraid to start daily vlogging
when I was pregnant with Ollie,
especially in the early stages,
'cause I just didn't,
I didn't know if I was
ready to share my every
day, of maybe going
through something that
would be really hard.
And, yeah, I was just-
- And five years later, here we are.
- We're still doing it!
- That is seriously so cool.
Thank you guys!
Three million subscribers, Ollie.
-  Thank you.
-  That's crazy,
can you say thank you?
- Thank you.
- These kids are having so much
fun opening all their toys.
Alright, we have some really special
presents from Santa, everyone, so Santa
wants us to open these, okay?
-  We really need
to open up these gifts.
(upbeat music)
-  Alright boys, let's
open some Santa presents, kay?
This one is to both of you.
I'll help you out, 'cause
that's kind of difficult.

Wow, a box, open it, open it, open it!

Those are so cool.
And you got little fox ones?

You wanna put 'em on?
- Yeah.

these little fox things on.
Stand up, I wanna see, I wanna see.
-  Oh my goodness, whoa.
(laughter)
Are they on all the way?
-  Can you walk?
- What does the fox say?
-  Walk around.
(Missy laughs)
-  It's 'cause the
tails are like, tickling him.
That is so cute, Finny, come here!
The elves must have made
them in the workshop, Ollie.
I wonder if they're magic slippers.
There's that one...these look so...
these actually look like Toothless, Ollie,
from How to Train Your Dragon.
Let's see.
-  Look how cute you guys are!
-  What do you think,
can they make you run really fast?

Alright, to Mimi from Santa.

I'm so excited to see.
What did Santa bring me?

- A Star Wars drone that we
can fly around the house?
- Yeah.
-  Oh my goodness,
thank you, Santa!
- Oh, thank you Santa!
- That's just like you're tattoo.
(Missy laughs)
- I know it is just like my tattoo.
-  How cool.
(paper crinkling)
-  What is it?
-  Whoa, another
one, but the speeder bike!
-  Wow.
- We're gonna have wars now.
- (laughs) It's gonna be
Star Wars in our house.
Alright, Ollie, this is
Santa's present to you, okay?
- Okay.
-  You remember what you asked for?
- Yeah.

That's what you asked for, huh?

-  Oh, yours has got
a cool heart, that's cool.
- This is fun.
-  Santa knows what's up.
- This is perfect.
-  Alright, Ollie
and Finn got another here.
You think it's more cool slippers?
- I don't know.

(gasps) What?

Alright, Finny, time for you

Alright, Jimmy's opening

-  Whoa, it's a Star
Wars Tie-Fighter drone.

We're gonna have to fly 'em all
around the house and battle.

-  Oh, you can?
- Yeah, you can like shoot other-
-  Oh, that's cool!
That is so neat.
Alright, we are opening the
Propel Star Wars drones.
This is the speeder bike.
They make you cut this on the side,
so that you can actually get into it.
♪ Star Wars theme ♪
Oh my gosh, it's lighting
up and playing music.
That is so cool.
Open it.
♪ Star Wars theme ♪
Oh that's so cool!
And then close it.
- Now it does the scene one, I think.
(drone sound effects)
-  Hey wait!
-  (laughs) That
is so neat, though.
Alright, I am about to
open my rebel fighter.
Let's see what happens.
♪ Star Wars theme ♪
Yes!
This is awesome!
This is so cool, babe, look at that.
-  That is so neat, so fun.
- I love it, I love Star Wars.
This is so neat.
(upbeat music)
What are we playing, boys?
- Crazy Toaster game!
-  How's it work?
-  Basically,
we're waiting for it to-
(toaster pops)
-  Oh, oh, you gotta catch it!
- You catch it in there.
-  Are you catching any, Ollie?
- Yeah, trying to.
-  Oh cool, keep trying.
I wanna see you do it, buddy.
- Let's go, let's go,
let's go, no, no, no!
(toaster pops)
Oh!
-  Nice, did you get one, Uncle?
- No.
-  No? Oh.
Finn's rewarding everyone.
You get this one.
- Here we go, here we go.
-  Oh!
- So close.
- Sounds like this game is
really hard to play with Finn.
Lookit, there's some nasty
pieces of toast in here.
(toaster pops)
(shouting)
Okay, we figured it out,
we're doing it wrong.
You gotta put ten in each slot.
- Yeah, okay, so let's count ten, okay?
(playful music)
Here we go, we gotta catch 'em.
- Ready Finn?
Hold your pan.
Get it, Finn.
- Oh, alright, no Momma's gonna do it.
- You got one!
- I got one.
- And then we leave the rest
on the ground, that's right.
Okay, leave 'em on the ground, ready?
Okay, so then it goes on your plate.
And then, if it doesn't
match any on your plate,
you get to keep one on the side.
-  Oh, I see, that's cool.
- Yeah, okay, ready?
-  Get your pan.
-  Get ready to catch one!
(toaster pops)
- Oh, missed!
Alright, Ollie, your turn to push it down.
-  Push it down, buddy.
(toaster clicks)
- Catch it, catch it.
(toaster pops)
Oh, missed.
Alright, Finn, you wanna push it down?
-  You were so close.
-  I didn't catch any either!
(playful music)
- It's not necessarily dinner time,
but we have lots of yummy food comin' out.
So I just suvee-ed this filet mignon,
we are snacking on some chips,
and we have baked potatoes in the oven.
We've got rolls up here startin',
and it's that time of the Christmas Day
where you just need some warmth
in your belly with some yummy food.
So that's what we are
doing, making comfort food.
Gravy, dips, chips, yummy good stuff.
- Press it, and say,
"Yeah, I can hear you."
- Yeah I can hear you.
- And then you have to
let go so Mommy can talk.
- Hey, I just wanted-
(feedback ringing)
Hey, I just wanted to
tell you that I love you.
- Hey, I love you, hey.
(Bryan laughs)
- Ollie's still trying to understand
the concept of a walkie talkie.
Alright, you guys, don't judge me, okay?
I'm wearing sunglasses
inside, at night, yes.
So this is a Christmas present from Missy.
They're called Zungal Panther,
and they're sunglasses,
but they're also, like,
built-in headphones.
But it's basically, like, sending
the music vibrations into my skull.
What?
Yeah, it's really weird.
So I can hear everything that's going on
and I can talk normally,
but I can also hear music,
which I think is really cool too.
I think this is gonna be
really fun during the summer,
like around the pool and stuff.
This is what they look like,
and basically, that sits
right above my ear and
just vibrates into it.
It's pretty cool.
Testin' 'em out with some
American Teen by Khalid.
And they sound pretty cool.
Alright, we are doing a Inkbox on Missy,
and we're about to show
you guys and reveal
the whole thing to you right now.
You ready to see it, babe?
-  Yep.
-  This is really cool, watch this.
Alright, let's take it off.
-  Oh wow, ow!
-  You did it!
-  (shouts) Oh, that's pretty cute!
-  So what did you get, babe?
- I got little eyes that are closed.
-  Yeah, so they're
like cute little eyelashes-
-  Aren't those cute?
-  On her wrist,
yeah, that's so cool, babe.
- Do you like it, Ollie?
(boys murmur)
- So apparently when I
was vlogging yesterday
and showing you guys my
rebel scum Star Wars tattoo,
I think I actually cut the part out
of me telling you guys that it was fake,
and it's actually just a
special type of Henna tattoo.
It lasts about two weeks.
And so what we did, is you apply it,
and it's actually really, really light.
And yours is actually a lot
darker than I was thinking.
-  Yeah, and then it darkens up.
-  Yes, when you
wake up in the morning,
it will be much darker, and
it will last about two weeks.
So it's kinda cool to, like, play around
with different tattoos and stuff.
- Yeah, just to test it.
I feel like I've always been
really tired of the tattoo
after two weeks, so yeah,
I think it's really fun
to test it out and see what I think.
-  I have a cool astronaut
that can go on your arm.
- Oh, an astronaut?
-  Yeah, does that sound cool?
-  It wouldn't even fit on her arm.
(laughter)
Alright, we have had the
funnest day ever, huh Finn?
Did you get everything you wanted?
(Finn fusses)
He did not get a nap
today so he is just like,
I need to go to bed!
He cannot even hold his head up.
He's just so tired, huh?
Did you have fun, though?
(Finn fusses)
Yeah, oh yeah, he's got his walkie talkie,
Mama's got her walkie
talkie, and I'm gonna
have it in my room, so they can
talk to me if they need me, okay?
Did you have a good Christmas?
Did you get everything you wanted?
Everything?
Aw, and more probably, huh?
You got things that you are loving,
you didn't even know you wanted, huh?
- Yeah.
- Should we ask them
what their favorite thing
they got this year for Christmas is?
Alright, you guys, let us know,
down in the comments, what
is your favorite thing
that you got this year for Christmas?
I hope you guys had an
awesome Christmas this year.
Remember, Christmas is not just
about the presents, though.
We love just spending
time with our family,
and celebrating Jesus's birthday, huh?
Alright, Ollie, tell me,
though, what was your favorite
toy or gift that you got
for Christmas, today?
- Um, the Power Ranger...
-  The Power Ranger dino thing?
You have been wanting that forever, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yup, and he got it from
Santa, and he is so excited,
and that's the favorite thing you got?
- Yeah.
-  How awesome,
I'm so glad you go that.
I'm glad you guys had a good Christmas.
I had a really, really
good Christmas, too.
Make sure to give this
video a big thumbs up.
I wanted to give you guys
a very big thank you,
once again, for three million subscribers.
This has been the funnest, craziest,
life-changing thing we have ever done,
and we're just so thankful, and so happy.
It's just like, it's really, really cool.
So thank you guys so much,
and we will see you guys tomorrow.
365 days till Christmas!
Ready, say "bye"!
- Bye.
(Finn fusses)
-  Boop.
-  Bye, boop.
