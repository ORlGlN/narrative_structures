himself
that is the question whoa

parent you have to challenge your
children to do things every day so that
they learn right Olly

it's an abstract if you guys haven't got
the memo yet he loves his Shrek um but
I'm actually gonna go ahead and try and
sit down and edit my Mother's Day video
I'm being honest with you guys I was so
nervous about this video because my
Mother's Day videos are usually very
special to me and this one definitely
isn't as extravagant as my other ones
still wanted it to like you know be able
to reach other lots of different moms
and so I hope that I was able to talk
about all different moms in the video
and I was just really nervous about it
and hopefully it turns out I'm gonna
edit it right now I feel a lot better
just by filming it because I've been
kind of stressing about it for the past
few weeks now like I need to film this I
need to start doing it and I definitely
procrastinated it but I've been kind of
like going over in my head for a while
and so I'm just gonna edit it and
hopefully it turns out good we're having
