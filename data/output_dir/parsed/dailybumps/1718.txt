let's say you're out with your friends
and you're hanging out and maybe there's
tension between you and your husband or
you and your boyfriend but you don't
actually usually make that known because
it's it's awkward and no one wants to
see that usually if we are fighting we
can talk about it and then we'll both
kind of like go do our own thing and
relax for a little while also when we do
fight we don't like call each other
meanings and also just too much food
