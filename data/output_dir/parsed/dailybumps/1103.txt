this is real life in case you're
wondering this is not a dream you know
if this was a dream I would have right
now that we are off to my very first
will be appointment to hear this baby's
heartbeat get an ultrasound and see the
baby to be really really fun and
interesting and I am extremely nervous
and very sick this morning and I woke up
very much as a very
like the room is literally spinning out
like how am I supposed to get up right
now I've already thrown up twice on this
car right so that's fun that's it we got
a full car we've got Ollie here hi ollie
you may see your brother or sister yep
we got Brian and we got my mom yeah
that's exciting
yeah I know it'll be really fun it'll be
nice to have my baby with me huh are you
gonna be good though he might just be
like a total disaster really excited
just get this over with
just this is the gestational sac here
okay that round really round thing is
the yolk sac and there is your baby with
a nice strong heartbeat it's okay it's
okay okay okay I can tell you it's over
160 B we are a minute if you look here
this arm buds and leg buds that are
starting to poison see that yeah yeah
that looks better really cute I usually
come in very early on their their visit
but I let myself wait and so this is a
bigger baby than I'm used to so that
first picture I'm getting one point five
seven centimeter which is measuring
eight we could not bloody it's so cool
yeah
can we hear the heartbeat at all you
think so I don't normally turn on the
Doppler oh that's kind of a personal
preference but I do because it does send
energy yeah yeah and that's on our
shadow ball first triangular I just we
can see it reassured that it's normal
and you will have it done if you opt to
do the genetic screen or when you come
back in four weeks we'll listen
is he falling asleep yeah you can barely
hear his eyes open the cutest thing ever
he doesn't love a good kid falling
asleep it's like the cutest thing ever
anyways we're down my appointment went
amazing so we'll have a little gummy
bear yeah little arm but our little
little little this little our littlest
little is hashtag littlest little so
cute
and this little heck so fine it so cute
we all know what to look for
and my mom was like very nice how
nervous I was till I was like she
finally said there yeah oh my gosh I
totally did good like it was just such a
relief I did not I really felt like we
are gonna see her like really really did
that also tell that that was a pretty
big baby in there
oh yeah so I was like there's an actual
baby in there so there's no heartbeat
it's very you know like yeah I was going
to be shocked
it was really really nice a very good
relief and I am still very nauseous and
very sick I feel like I'm going to throw
up mostly because I have no food in my
stomach because I throw up all that
first we're going to almost God
yeah oh you little karma karma hi be
honest do you drink out of the toilet
sometimes maybe one we're not home just
like your little that looks like a face
of guilt we are back from our really
amazing appointment today where we saw
our new baby for the first time it's
pretty pretty cool hey her tired
Missy actually is taking a nap right now
um all these do all I really needed a
nap so they're both taking a nap and
then I think she's taking him to the
doctor's later um we're gonna show her
that clip from a vlog a couple days ago
where it looked like he was having like
an absent Caesar seizure and just get it
checked out see what the doctor thinks
what what I'm actually just sitting in
my office
going over Apple watch news which is
pretty cool been watching some videos
and reading about it and catching up on
that but also I wanted to give you guys
a little music update I know a couple
days ago or maybe a week or two ago I
showed you guys a little clip of a song
that was in production and since then
I've written about six or seven songs
and I think I've finally chosen the song
that's gonna be my next single it's
being produced right now and hopefully
I'm hoping to record it this week or
next week and maybe I can have something
for you guys at the end of the month but
I am gonna be releasing four more songs
this next single is really cool it has
that really nice this is home sound but
it's unique which is really cool and one
of the things is you know you know as I
write songs I'm probably going to write
50 60 songs this year and really only
release a handful of them just because I
want all the songs to sort of have that
sound I want people to listen to my
music in here that's the sound that
Brian Landy has you know that's unique
to him if we're back at your favorite
place Holly
apparently he knows exactly what to do
because when we got called back
straight to the d√°il and to weigh
himself and he just like went there in
stood on it it was so funny I'm on too
much fun for a bit seriously
we like rushed here so I was a tiny bit
late so I didn't get a chance to really
fall but we're his doctor's appointment
now and we're getting his ears checked
make sure it's all better I'm not
supposed to open those can you close it
he's like no mom whatever is it Amir
come here
shut the door shut it good no so close
can you just shut it place offer James
you can shut it sure thank you we are
also here because we are checking with
that little clip where he kind of zoned
on my dog what his doctor thanks yeah
I'm having fun
Brian's making dinner Jamaican I am
making stovetop easy cheesy chicken
baked it's one of those recipes that's
on the back of our stuff the stuffing
box like it actually wasn't on the back
of our stuff oh so I had to limit ah and
super good missing Olli will not like it
but that's okay I have a little baby you
got it I do not like stove top stuffing
sure I like it but I will try it and if
I don't like it I'll just see something
else because honestly probably no matter
what he would make tonight I probably
would have a hard time eating it just
because I'm so haven't really been doing
very good with food so I'm sure the
night time jack-in-the-box rods are
gonna remake it haha let's hope not the
always over here he's watching a little
bit of cartoons we did go to his
appointment and the doctor did not think
he had an oblong seizure but she didn't
really like the way it loved and she
what she was concerned so she did order
and eat reach me out babe it's okay I
she was like if it is what you think it
is or if it is what I think it is or
whatever then it just means that he may
have to go on a medication and that he
will eventually grow out of it we will
we're gonna have a check out we're gonna
get him the EEG which I'm not sure if
you have ever had or if your kids have
ever had an EEG tell me how they did it
because I heard it last an hour and they
can't move so like I feel like I'm just
gonna have to like give all I like
benadryl or something they put them like
help him sleep cuz there's no way that
kid would sit still for an hour I mean
he's not even two that's a little bit
it's a little disturbing and a little
scary to think that something's wrong
but but that we caught it and we saw it
we actually got on camera which is
doesn't happen most parents would just
have to explain what happened
so it's nice that we actually have video
of it alright Missy is putting oli to
bed and I I'm gonna take out my castle
oh it looks up good hmm
do some macro action up on that Oh
doesn't look so good look at that bubble
