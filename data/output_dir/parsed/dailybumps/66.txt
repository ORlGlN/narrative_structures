I'm so bummed that he didn't get to go.
But we're home now, its so nice out!
It feels like chilly, but
not that cold, you know.
The boys are kind of
on a mission right now,
to find BB-8, 'cause Fred told us
to find BB-8, and we
haven't seen him yet, right?
- Yeah.
- We're kind of just looking
around the chicken coop,
check on the chickens, and hopefully
we can find BB-8 soon.
(chirps and clicks)
- Alright, we got one
egg from the chickens,
we played outside for a little bit,
and we had a ton of fun,
its so nice out there.
The weather is nice, and yeah.
Ollie did you hear that noise?
- Yeah.
- What do you think it was?
- I don't know.
- Maybe, it's what we've
been looking for all day.
What?
Come here, come here!
-  He's caught!
- BB-8!!
- Oh my goodness.
- BB-8, what are you doing in there?
Wait, that's not BB-8, Ollie.
That's Santa BB-8, he's
wearing a Christmas hat.
- Aww!
- He does not like being this cage.
Let's take this cage off him huh?

I mean does BB-8 even
know where he's going?
Okay, hang on he's taking

- Oh my goodness.
What is going on here?
Is that Kylo Ren?
And he's got Fred!
- Oh no!
- Fred are you okay?
You know what, I think BB-8 is telling us
what we need to do.
We need to defeat Kylo Ren!
(screams)
- Kylo Ren is still a bad guy huh?
- Yeah!
- Yes, he's a bad guy, who has
not treated Fred very nice.
- We saved you Fred.
You can go home now when you need to.
At least we had BB-8, Santa BB-8 here to
help us find Fred and save him huh?
- Yeah.
- That was crazy.
- Are you okay Fred?
- Are you okay, I think he's okay, bud.
Luckily --
- What about BB-8 Santa?
- We should tell him thank you.
- Say thank you BB-8 guys.
- Thank you BB-8!
(beeps and chirps)
- Awwwww.

- Huge thanks to BB-8 for helping us

North Pole and charge up.
So say goodbye.
- Bye bye!!
- Bye, say bye BB-8.
- Bye BB-8.
(laughs)
- Say bye Finn.
- Bye.
- Bye, thanks for all your help.
(dramatic music)
- I cannot stop thinking about the new
Star Wars movie you guys, the Last Jedi.
It was so good and I gotta say
I am a new Star Wars fan.
I've just been watching for like
the past three years or so.
But it was just such a great movie,
I just loved like the humor,
I loved the emotion, I loved the message.
There was a part in the movie and
I'm not gonna give anything away, but.
There was a part in the movie where
she said: this is how we're gonna win.
Not by destroying what we hate,
but by saving what we love.
And I think that's such a great message
for this day and age.
Because negativity is something that's
really easy to attract.
I feel like to our culture and our people.
And if you really stop and look around,
I think you'll see that
love is really everywhere.
And we just kinda need to save that,
and hold on to that and believe in that.
So that was really cool.
That was a really cool message.
It was just one of those
full circle moments.
Being able to experience the duality.
So, it was really cool.
But, anyway I think that's
all for today's blog.
If you enjoyed it you should
give this video a big thumbs up.
Subscribe, thanks for watching and
we will see you guys minyanta.
Byeeeeeee.
