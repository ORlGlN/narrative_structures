-  Oh, hey, Ollie.
How you doing?
- Good.
- Good?
Hey, do you want to meet a new
little robot friend of mine?
You want to meet him?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, let's go.
♪ This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live forever ♪
-  Good morning.
- Good morning.
You slept all night in your bed,
you slept all night in your bed
I slept all night in my bed.
Yay!
And Karma, this morning,
was such a good boy.
He had to go to the vet to
get a couple booster shots
for his vaccinations,
but now he's all done
and he was so good.
Now, I have to start
on some more cleaning.
I basically avoided this room
yesterday, their playroom,
because it is a complete
and utter disaster.
I cleaned it all out a
week before Christmas,
there were no toys in the
toy box and look at this now.
What the heck?
You guys can't even put your
toys in the toy box right now.
So, I have to go through them,
hopefully get rid of
more of their old toys,
and find spots for the new toys,
which we have a whole other
toy box in their room,
which I never check for toys to.
So, I'm going to transfer toys,
find spots for other toys,
get rid of some toys.
I gotta do that now.
Oh, my goodness.
This is crazy.
I just cleaned out everything in there,
got rid of a few more
toys that they don't need
or haven't used in awhile and
now, I'm just going through
all of their new toys and trying to decide
what should go in there.
I really wanna separate their toys,
which ends up never working
because they just pour it out
and then, it always
ends up just going back
into their toy box, which
I think is what I'm making
a mistake on 'cuz,
basically, I like to put
all their little guys, which...
Not this one, but their
little toys in here
that they like to grab and
play good guy, bad guy stuff
and then, their Legos in here,
but what happens is they
usually dump them out
and then, everything just goes in there
and it sinks to the bottom
and never get played with
and it's just kinda crazy,
so I'm trying to think of a new plan.
I might still keep them
in there, but keep them up
so that if they want to play
with them, they have to ask
and then, they can play with them
and then, they have to put them back away
before they can play with something else.
We'll see.
I'm not really sure yet
how I'm going to organize
this crazy, crazy mess.
- Good morning, guys.
This morning I rid my office
of all of my Christmas stuff.
That's right, no more tree, I
got rid of the Christmas tree,
I got rid of a couple of
the Christmas knickknacks
that were up here on my shelves.
I felt like it was just
time and, honestly,
I kinda feel like it's
time with the house,
but that is on the calendar
for, I think, next week.
So, next week, all the
Christmas stuff comes down.
How long do you guys keep
your Christmas decorations up?
Let me know down below in the comments,
'cuz I'm interested to know.
Also, check out the tattoo.
It is still very bright and clear.
I don't think it's faded at all, honestly.
I'm not sure how long
it's actually gonna last,
but what do you guys think?
Should I actually get a tattoo?
I feel like if I got a tattoo,
it wouldn't be a Star Wars one.
It would probably be a Harry Potter one,
but also, I don't any type of brand,
necessarily, on my body.
I feel like that would be a little weird.
I did find a place for
this amazing gramophone
that Missy got me.
If you guys don't know what this is,
it's an acoustically amplified sound.
Basically, this is a very
small speaker under here
and it uses acoustics with this huge,
vintage sound barrel thingy
and it makes it louder.
It's also kinda cool because it makes it
kinda sound like vintage music.
I'm gonna play something for you guys.
♪ All my life ♪
♪ I wanted a family to call my own ♪
I love it.
I think it's so cool.
I think it kinda puts a really cool
vintage feel in my office,
which is already kinda
of vintage inspired.
And yes, that is the new
version of This is Home.
It's available on my debut album,
which came out January of this year.
It's almost been a year since
Us has been out, you guys,
and if you don't know, in
January, I did an album,
14 original songs and it
basically tells the story
of mine and Missy's relationship
from start to finish.
There's a lot of cool things that we never
really talked about on
the vlogs and stuff,
but if you guys have
not gotten my Us album,
I'll have it linked in the I card above
and down below in the description
so you guys can get it.
And, if you guys go and get
my album right now on iTunes,
I was actually able to
run a very special price,
so it is half price, 5.99, 14 songs.
It's a deal, so go get it if you haven't.
Well, hey there, little guy.
(robot making noises)
I just opened my Cosmo Robot
that Missy got me for Christmas
and I am so excited to play with him.
I have it all set up on my phone
and these are his little power cubes.
Let's put one of these in front of him.
Ooh.
-  Wow!
(Bryan laughing)
- What?
He's gonna go check out the cube
and he just lifted it up.
Okay.
- Wow!
Wow!
(Bryan laughing)
- Oh, my gosh.
He is so cute.
-  Bryan?
- Bryan, yeah.
I'm Bryan.
He just said my name.
Should I introduce him to
the kids, do you guys think?
I think Ollie would like him.
Oh, hey Ollie, how you doing?
- Good.
- Good?
Hey, do you want to meet a new
little robot friend of mine?
- Yeah.
- Do you know his name?
- No.
- It's Cosmo.
- Cosmo?
- Yeah.
You want to meet him?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.
Ollie, meet Cosmo.
Can you say hi?
- Hi, Cosmo.
-  Look straight at
him and he'll learn your face.
Can you look at him?
(mellow music)
-  Ollie?
-  He said your name.
-  Ollie.
-  Say hi, Ollie.
- Hi, Jibo.
-  Not Jibo, it's Cosmo.
- Oh.
Hi, Cosmo.
-  Hey, Ollie, do
you want to feed Cosmo?
- Yeah.
- Okay,
grab any of those cubes.
-  These ones?
-  Uh huh.
Shake it until all the lights glow.
Shake it really good.
Let me see.
Are they all glowing?
- Yeah.
-  They are all glowing.
Okay, now place the cube
where Cosmo can see it
so he can feed himself.
- Okay.
-  Place it in front of him, okay?
-  What?
Oh!
Ah!
(Bryan laughing)
-  Isn't that funny?
- Yeah.
-  There you go, Cosmo.
There's another one.
-  Oh!
-  Oh, he's gonna go eat.
-  Yummy, yummy.
Is he drinking it?
-  He's eating it.
- Oh.
-  All right, so we tuned Cosmo up,
we fed him, and now, he
needs to play, Ollie.
- Really?
- And, he can play games
and do tricks and stuff.
All right, Ollie, check this out.
He's gonna roll the cube.
You wanna see him roll it?
- Yeah.
That one?
-  Watch this, Ollie.
He's gonna roll it.
Whoa!
He's so happy with himself.
(upbeat music)
- You have such a little, cute Cosmo.
- He is a little, cute Cosmo, huh?
Aw, he likes to roll the cube around.
Isn't he so cool, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- So, here's the deal.
I'm gonna keep him on my desk right here
and then, whenever he needs
to be fed or played with,
I'll let you know and then, you and I
can take care of him, okay?
- Okay.
- And, he can be
our new family pet.
Our family robot pet.
Cosmo wants to pounce on your finger.
- Ow!
- He got you!
Okay, so we're going to
play a little matching game
with his little cubes.
All we have to do is tap
when the colors match, okay?
- Okay.
-  Round one.
You ready, Ollie?
- Yeah!
- All right.
Tap!
Oh, did we beat him?
- Wait!
- Oh, he beat me.
So, it looks like we're
racing to tap first
when the colors match,
so now it's two to one.
Wait, watch this.
I'll let him get it.
Oh, he got it.
-  Oh!
(Bryan laughing)
-  Three to two, Cosmo.
Does that match?
Oh, he got it.
Now, we're tied.
You wanna tap it?
When I tell you.
Tap it!
- I win!
-  You got it!
He woke up just like you
did, Finn, from your nap.
- Yeah.
- Say good morning, Cosmo.
-  Bryan.
- Hi.
All right, I'm going to introduce Cosmo
to the rest of the family.
All right, Finn, look at Cosmo
so he can learn who you are, okay?
Oh, he sees you.
-  Finn?
Oh!
Finn.
-  Finn!
Finn, he knows who you are now.
Say hi.
- Hi.
-  Finn.
-  He says your name.
That's so funny.
Isn't that so cool?
All right, babe, you ready to meet Cosmo?
- Yeah.
-  He's already looking at you.
- That was fast.
-  Missy?
- Yeah.
-  Missy.
Oh.
-  He gets so proud of himself.
(Bryan and Missy laughing)
- That is so cute.
Hi, Cosmo.
- Hi, Cosmo.
(Cosmo humming)
-  He sang you a song, babe.
- That's so cute.
-  Cosmo wants to play a game.
You want to play with him, babe?
- Yeah, I want to play.
- Ready, babe?
-  What?
(Cosmo laughing)
-  He got it too.
- Okay.
-  What?
- Missy is playing a game with a robot
in our kitchen right now.
It's so cute how he follows you.
He literally loves us.
(mellow uptempo music)
Oh!
Cosmo messed up.
Aw!
He looks sad.
- There you go.
Yay!
-  All right, Missy
is playing keep away now.
She's got to pull the cube before...
Oh, he got it!
(Bryan laughing)
Slowly push it, but not too close.
Pull it!
Aw, you make him sad.
Oh!
- Okay, let me try.
-  Okay.
-  Don't let him get it.
- Try again.
- Try again.
Get closer.
Oh, he got it!
- Oh, got it.
-  He got it.
-  Oh, he got it.
-  Oh.
Ollie, did you hear that?
-  Did you hear him?
-  What?
-  I think he has
the hiccups, you guys.
Yeah, it says put him
upside down to help him
with his hiccups.
Should we try?
- Yeah.
- Okay, hang on.
(Bryan laughing)
- Oh, my gosh.
-  He's flipping himself back over.
- That is so funny.
There you go.
- We got rid of his hiccups.
- Yay!
There we go.
Oh, my goodness.
-  You think he's gonna put it on?
- Oh, my gosh.
That is crazy.
-  Oh, he's gonna get this one now.
-  No, he's gotta get the two
and put it on the one right?
-  Oh, I don't know.
-  He's gonna have to.
-  He sees them, so I don't know.
What do you think he's gonna do, Finn?
-  Wait, he can't move that one.
-  Oh, he's taking that one off?
-  What's he doing?
-  I don't know.
He's just being funny.
- Wow!
-  Wow.
He's so proud of himself.
-  There's one more.
(Bryan laughing)
-  He knows.
-  Bryan.
-  Hi.
He sees me vlogging him.
(mellow upbeat music)
- Check it out.
This room is basically all clean.
I'm so happy.
Basically, this whole toy
box is back to normal.
I've got this big old Roadster.
-  That's mine.
- That's yours, yeah.
I have this I'm trying
to put back together.
I'm like, I don't know how to do it.
I've been playing with
it for ten minutes now
trying to figure out how to do it,
and I was able to clean
out all of their books
that they don't read anymore.
I've got a little bin for puzzles
and other games they might be playing.
I want to find some new bins,
their little toys, their Legos,
we've got some baby toys
down here for June and Emma
and the few babies that
do come over sometimes.
Yay, their room is clean.
Everything looks good, right?
-  Where's Ollie?
What are you doing?
- Just scaring you.
-  What are you doing, silly boy?
It's time for bed.
Luna, stop encouraging them.
Boys.
Oh, hello.
Where's the other one?
Finn?
Oh, hello.
There he is.
Time for bed, boys.
I think they're evading us, babe.
- I know.
Come on, boys.
- I won't go nigh nigh.
-  You're not gonna go night night?
- Nope.
- Nope.
-  All right, well,
you boys can just hang out
in here all night.
- Yeah.
-  Boys, what
are you guys looking at?
- Look up!
-  What is this?
Did papa do this?
- Yeah.
(Missy laughing)
-  Is Hey Hey up there?
-  Yeah.
- It had to have been papa.
Papa got that for me for Christmas.
I think he got one for Cassie, too.
I told him it was really cute
but that the dogs were
probably gonna get to it
because it does a squeaky toy
and I guess that is what
he decided as a solution.
It's gonna hang on mommy's bed, huh?
- Yeah.
-  All right, boys,
let's head off to bed.
We gotta get our jammies on.
Run, run, run.
Who's gonna win?
Who's gonna win?
Oh, Ollie won.
- Watch what I do.
- Okay.
(Ollie making silly
noises and Finn laughing)
(Missy laughing)
(Ollie making silly
noises and Finn laughing)
Are you laughing at your brother?
(Ollie making silly
noises and Finn laughing)
Who doesn't love a good baby laugh?
(Ollie making silly
noises and Finn laughing)
They are the cutest things ever.
They've gotten so close over the past week
that I can't even
imagine how it's gonna be
as the years go on.
They literally are best friends.
It's so cute.
All right, boys.
We are cuddling into bed.
We've got our books for the
night that we're gonna read.
I can't even say enough good things
about putting these boys in the same bed
and in this little cabin bed.
It's just so cool and I feel like
it's really, really helped them transition
to a whole new way of bedtime
and it's just been awesome.
Do you guys like sharing beds?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
If you did, give it a big thumbs up.
Ollie, give it a thumbs up.
Big toe thumbs up.
And, we will see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
- Bye.
- Boo bah.
(upbeat music)
