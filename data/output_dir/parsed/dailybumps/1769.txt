there Missy you know so far okay look at
how stinky poopy is there you go oh we
were going to me oh my god I did did you
really I did
what up bumpers so funny story last
night I was up so late trying to get the
vlog up Final Cut Pro was just being so
glitchy and had to upload to YouTube
probably bout three times before it
actually went through first time it took
about three hours which is not normal I
was like what's going on because it
usually takes like 30 minutes and then
it ended up actually failing at the end
of it too so I had to do like three
different times finally I got it up
around 7 a.m. I was up until 7 a.m. you
guys and I got maybe two hours of sleep
when I woke up though I saw that our
Drobo actually had a failed Drive so
check it out this is what this means
these three are okay this one is failing
see the red light the other ones are
orange because they're trying to copy
all the data to the other ones because I
can actually take that one out and just
put a brand new one in and I won't lose
anything which is really cool but I'm
totally sad because my capacity is
almost full now I only have two little
blips truck so I actually just got a
comment well we just got a comment from
Bubble Belles
she said killer beard Brian smiley face
keep it tied here first of all I know
it's a go and I just like I'm I'm amazed
by I'm like wow I'm growing facial hair
that's awesome
second of all don't tell me what to do
you ain't my real mom but yeah I should
have kept it tighter and I actually did
just tidy it up a bit but yeah it's
growing him thick it's getting a little
higher and nice and clean so Brian can
you I worked I guess to fly his
helicopter it's fun
just whenever I try and do it I freaked
out and then I make it go really hot and
then it goes really low this doesn't
stop and then it hits everything pretty
scary

grudge come on chicken okay sue fixes

eggs or say figs and he was just like uh

short with us yeah he kind of acted as
if we were the stupid ones and we were
like asking a stupid question so we're
like well no they have to be like
pasteurized to make sure that they're
safe to eat he's like well all you have
to do is cook them I'm like I want to
eat them raw when we were at that market

called virgil's and it's zero real Cola
and it's sweetened with stevia which is
actually like an all and it's an actual
natural sweetener not like Splenda so I

ah-ha karma you're in trouble is it yep
stay don't kiss me don't look at me with
that cute little face you're so cute
I just want to give you right now Devin
found this recipe to make your hair
super soft you use for part or four
tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil
and two eggs and then you put it in your
dry hair you let it sit and then you
wash it out and it's also
supersoft okay okay oh good
oh not on your face no or a little bit
of it give my hand almost okay this is
nothing very soft it's like very
sniffing so did it do anything to your
hair no it kind of just made it more dry
really yeah it still feels like stiff so
it didn't really work no I would not say
I wouldn't do it again that's so weird
that putting oil and egg on your hair
didn't make it soft I'm gonna go ahead
