guys we're at the beach again last day
in Florida so we're just gonna spend as
much time on this beautiful white sand
and this bright green ocean that is like
90 degrees it feels incredible so every
bit yes we are look at this I don't
think you ever get used to something
like that's so beautiful
we've been having as such a good trip
with our friends Colin and Katie and
Ellie and Jared and I feel like it's
just been such a huge blessing to be
able to come out here and do something
like this and have fun and be with good
friends
it's been cool it's been like seriously
the best trip like like a-tryin
and we said we feel like so blessed that
we were able to like do something like
this like it's just crazy it's really
really crazy and you know what oli has
been so stinking good I know I said this
yesterday and even though we're at the
beach he doesn't quite love the sand the
ocean he loves just sitting on the you
know on the beach here yeah and he takes
nap and he just relaxes he's like he's
good he's so good so it's pretty cool
and yesterday was really fun because he
actually got to swim in the ocean but he
wasn't scared because there weren't like
waves and stuff yeah and so that was
like it's so so neat oh my gosh he could
not come talking about the fishy he woke
up this morning and he was like mm is
our boat about left Mishi Mishi Mishi
big fishy I know we mentioned when we
were in Portland that we were like house
hunting we actually looked at a couple
houses and one of the big places that we
might be considering is Florida because
it's somewhere where Missy's parents
have kind of always wanted to go and the
housing market is really nice out here
it's very similar weather to California
I think it yeah we have the beach this
ocean is like insane no

possibility
