- This just proves that
this car is ridiculous.
It says it's 129 degrees.
There's no way.
We made the attempt outside
and I take back everything
I just said, it's definitely
129 degrees out here.
Don't you think?
It's hot, hot, hot, huh?
- Yeah.
- A hundred and twenty-nine
degrees sounds about right.
("This is Home" by Bryan Lanning)
- Good morning, guys.
It is a beautiful day here
in sunny southern California today.
Look at this.
Oh, I love all our new pictures
that we hung yesterday.
And today, I've been working
on hanging some stuff
on this wall while I
let Missy get some rest.
Missy has not been feeling good.
She got a little, I think
like a sinus infection.
So I'm letting her just
relax and lay down in bed
and get better.
So the boys are totally
preoccupying themselves.
And I've been working
on this hallways trying
to get some stuff hung.
So we got this big old piece of teak wood.
We got this at World Market.
And every single one of them were unique,
which is what I liked.
So I picked this one out,
got it up on the wall.
It looks good there.
And then over here, I was
working on a little gallery.
We have Ollie's portrait from Disneyland,
which we have to get one for Fin too.
But then we have some little planters,
which I'm gonna put real air plants in.
And then we have our square photos.
I did already break one of the planters.
It was supposed to go there.
So if you're wondering why the
gallery looks a little off,
it's because I broke that.
(laughs)
Let's go see what the
kids are up to though.
- Happy Friday!
(Fin shouting)
-  Happy Friday, boys!
(blows trumpet)
(Bryan laughs)
Is that the Friday bugle?
- Yup.
-  Yup.
- Good morning!
- Good morning, buddy!
How you doing today?
- Good!
-  You're just
playing with your brother?
- Yeah.
-  No school today?
- No.
- You got lucky, no school!
(laughs)
All right, so I also hung this up here,
which I've been wanting to put
something here for a while.
It's just a little octagon shelf
with a bunch of little knickknacks.
(bell ringing)
Got a bell, got a globe.
And this is kind of cool
too, to like have a timer.
I wonder how long it is.
It's probably about 60 seconds.
There's that too.
And then on this wall I
hung some little frames,
which kind of look good there.
We just need to fill
them up with pictures.
I feel like getting our
big pictures in finally
and hanging them up in the
hallway kind of encouraged us
to start decorating more. (laughs)
We still have a couple places in the house
that need to be decorated.
So that's what we've been working on.
And holy cow, I just put these
flowers in here. (inhales)
And they smell so good, you guys.
Wanna smell them?
Here, smell them, guys.
Smell them, ready?
(inhales) Everyone together now.
(inhales and exhales)
Now doesn't that smell nice?
(upbeat music)
- Good morning, guys.
I have made it to the couch this morning
and I feel so sick!
I'm so bummed.
(Fin shouting)
Yeah, I am not feeling good today.
I woke up with the worst migraine.
I had like a really bad headache
and it felt like a migraine
but I've never had a migraine before.
It was just really, really, really bad.
Yeah, and I am just
all stuffed up in here.
My whole body aches, which
of course could just be
from working out, totally,
but I'm pretty sure that
some of it is more of a ...
It's like deeper down, like
an achiness of being sick.
So I'm like, I just don't
want the kids to get it.
I've been kind of trying to
just keep up on medication
so that I can actually be like alive
and play with the kids.
So I've made it to the couch which is good
because I spent most
of the morning in bed.
And now the kids are playing
and they really wanna
show you guys something,
so I'm gonna let them show you.
All right, Ollie, what
did you want to show them?
- Okay.
-  Whoa, he can do
these awesome summersaults.
Whoa, that was awesome, Ollie.
Oh, and Fin can do it too.
(laughs)
-  Hi-hah, wow, those are so good.
You guys are almost ready
for gymnastics, huh?
- No.
-  No?
- I'm the crazy one and
Fin's the silly one.
-  Oh, you're crazy and he's silly.
Hey Ollie, guess what?
We might have some friends
coming over in a few hours.
Who do you think it is?
- I don't know.
-  You don't know?
Okay, well I guess it's
gonna be a surprise, huh?
(Fin shouting)
Okay Fin, you have a snotty nose.
You need to go get a tissue.
Go get a tissue right now, Finley J.
- No!
- Look at us, we made it
out of the house, huh?
Fin just woke up from
a nap and I went ahead,
I was like, you know what?
I'm just gonna take some DayQuil
and rest for a little bit
and then just slap some makeup
on and get out of the house
because I feel like that's
usually how I get better
is just like go.
Which I know sounds
like the opposite thing
that you're supposed to do.
But anyways, Fin just took
a nap and I've just been
sitting in the car relaxing
while he was sleeping.
Bryan ran into the Home
Depot to grab some plants
and some things that we
needed for around the house.
But I did want to show you guys,
this just proves that this car
is ridiculous and it's lying.
Because it often says that
the temperature outside
is like 114 and I'm like,
it's hot, it is really hot,
but it's not that hot.
And look what it says right now.
It says it's 129 degrees.
There's no way.
So obviously the car is
reading at a much hotter rate,
especially because it's a black car.
So I'm guessing it absorbs more heat
because there's no way
it's actually that hot.
Let's see how hot it actually is out.
I mean, it does say it's 104 out there,
which is very, very hot.
So Fin is now up and I'm
trying to decide if we should
go walk around the garden with
daddy and pick some plants.
Do you wanna go walk around?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.
I know he's got a little cold too.
It's not as bad as me I don't think,
but he's definitely got
that runny nose going on.
Yeah, is that a Minion tissue?
We made the attempt outside
and I take back everything
I just said, it's definitely
129 degrees out here,
don't you think?
It is hot, hot, hot, huh?
- Yeah.
- A hundred and twenty-nine
degrees sounds about right.
- We are now at Hobby Lobby.
As I told you this morning,
I broke one of those planters
in the hallway, so I came to Hobby Lobby
thinking this is where
we got them but it's not.
We got them at Target.
But I found these ones
which look cool too.
Missy actually found them.
- I like those ones a lot.
-  You like these ones better?
- Yeah, I actually do.
-  Okay, we got these then.
What did you find?
(Fin shouting)
Oh, it's a fan?
Make it go.
Whoa!
Come here, come here,
come here, come here!
(grunts) You wanna tell
them who's coming over?
Who's coming over?
- Carl and Jinger are coming over!
- Carl and Jinger, that's right!
Ollie has been begging to
hang out with the boys,
so they are driving down
to come hang out with us
for the weekend, does that sound cool?
- Yeah, and play!
- Yeah, we're gonna play, we're
gonna film some cool videos.
- I guess we can go swimming today.
- We can go swimming too, huh?
- Yup.
- Yes.
You know what you should do, Ollie?
- What?
- You should show them your collection.
- Collection?
- Should we?
- Yeah.
(everyone shouting)
- Look who's here!
Carl and Jinger!
The whole family is in the hiz-ouse.
- Ready to party.
- Click that icon to
check out their channel.
They're gonna come hang out
with us for the weekend.
Why not?
- It's gonna be amazing, right?
We're gonna do crazy stuff.
- Why not?
- We're gonna do some crazy stuff?
- Let's start with making lasagna.
Because when Carl and Jinger come,
that means three boys accompany them.
I used to be a boy, I was a young ...
- Me too!
You too?
- I was a young man once, I
know how much young boys eat
so we're making lasagna.
- Pet mouse.
-  What's his name?
- John!
-  His name is John.
Ollie has a pet mouse named John.
We even have a clear ball we put him in
and we let him run around the house.
(laughing)
- That is so cool.
-  Whoa, you like that sword, dude?
- Wanna see my Emoji Movie collection?
-  Yeah!
-  Ollie's got himself a crowd.
-  That is a lot, look at that.
-  He's got them all!
-  Got all the emojis!
-  We have every single emoji.
- You have an original.
-  Yes, even the original.
All right, which one do you
want to show them first?
-  That's the heart-faced cat.
-  That's the cat emoji.
-  That one's cool, oh
yeah, I really like that one.
- The puppy!
- That one's an awesome one.
-  Fin, you show them.
The frog, that one is really cool.
- High five!
-  That is so cool.
And then this is Jailbreak.
-  Awesome, yeah!
-  What else you got?
- The tongue emoji,
another tongue emoji one.
-  See, I think
this is the original one
and that's The Emoji Movie one,
so that's like the difference.
-  That's cool, and
then there's smiley face one.
-  Oh, he's got two, that's neat.
That's so cool, huh, Ollie?
- We need four of them.
- Oh really?
Yes, Ollie has collected
all of The Emoji Movie
emoji plushes from McDonald's
Happy Meals, you guys.
Isn't that so cool?
And Ollie, tell them
which one's your favorite.
Which one's your favorite?
- The kitty cat.
-  The kitty cat
with the heart eyes?
-  My favorite
one is the puppy one.
-  The puppy one is cool.
-  I like the kitty cat one a lot.
-  Oh, come on,
you gotta give some love
to the monkey! (laughs)
(everyone laughing and talking)
I seriously just love
when Carl and Jinger visit
because all of the kids
have so much fun together.
By the way, if you guys missed
our last emoji vlog we did
where I put on a giant
inflatable poop emoji
and surprised the kids, check
that out in the iCard as well.
But it's gonna be a fun weekend
of the boys just hanging out
and getting to let loose.
(upbeat music)
(slashing noise)
All right, everyone is
watching Captain Underpants.
Here, you want some popcorn?
- Sure.
-  You want popcorn?
There you go, dude.
Oh, and he's also got
some chocolate ice cream.
- I'm done with this.
-  Oh, you are?
I'll take it, buddy.
- There you go.
-  He is in heaven, you guys.
He loves hanging out with older boys
and he loves just
cuddling and eating snacks
and watching a movie.
They're watching Captain
Underpants, by the way.
- I've never seen it!
-  I know, it's so funny, huh?
- (mumbling) Ah, I can't say it again!
- You can't say it?
We're saying goodbye to everyone.
What do you say, Ollie?
Thank you for liking,
subscribing, and commenting below.
- Yeah.
- Guys, I hope you enjoyed
Bryan and Missy's vlog.
Make sure to give this video a thumbs up
and I'll see you manana.
Say bye too, Ollie!
- Bye!
(upbeat music)
