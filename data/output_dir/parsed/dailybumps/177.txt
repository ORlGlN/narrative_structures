You so excited?
(bell dings)
These boys are so
excited for Disneyland, huh?
Yeah, we decided last night.
Well we've been kind of talking
about going for a while.
We have definitely missed it.
So we decided that today
was the best day to go.
But, (giggles) its the best day to go
because it's the least busy,
but it's still busy enough that
Bryan is not coming with us.
Daddy's not coming with us.
But, we're gonna go really soon with him.
We're just gonna enjoy this time
with just these two and mama,
and I think we're gonna have
a really fun time, okay?
And guess who's coming with us?
- Kelsey and Corbin.
- Kelsey and Corbin and baby June.
Are you going to show baby
June all the cool rides?
He's like "Mom, I gotta drink my drink."
Anyways I am all packed up.
I've got all kinds of goodies for the day.
And I am super excited.
So let's go ahead and
get on the road, okay?
-  Ollie, what are we listening to?
- Nightmare for Christmas.
- Yeah, that's like one of Ollie's
like favorite movies right now.
And we just listened to like
(Finn screams)
whole soundtrack on the way here.
Finn is like I'm ready to get
out of this car so let's go.
I just told him that there is
a Nightmare Before Christmas ride.
And we might even get
to meet Jack Skelington.
- Yes we are.
-  Yes we are.
- Ollie's so excited.
I'm actually super sad
that Bryan's not here
cause it's actually kind
of like him and Bryan's
like favorite movie to watch together.
So I'm sure Bryan would have
loved to take him on it.
But I guess this is
just how it's gonna go.
We'll go on it with Daddy next time huh?
- Yes, yes.
- We are super duper excited though.
Our tradition is always
to listen to either
a Disney soundtrack or
Disney Radio on the way here
and it really gets us in the mood.
And I'm just excited that
it is fall time at Disney.
It's like my favorite.
I actually got the little
ears at a little Bazzar
that we went to a few weeks ago.
And I love them their so cute.
(upbeat pop music)
(fingers snapping)
(upbeat pop music)

We've made it to Disneyland
and look who's with us?

Alright Ollie, what ride
are we going on first.
- Astro Blast Off.
- Yeah, this is a really fun ride.
And we're taking June on it.
- June's first time on the Rocket.
- We're all a little bit nervous.
It is a actually pretty scary ride.
- They're pretty high up
there, I'm like nervous.
- Yeah, this is Bryan's
like least favorite ride.
Cause it's actually scary and spins.
- Yeah Kelse's just

- So yeah, we're almost done.
Here we go first ride.
-  Whoo, boys, what do you think?
-  Good.
- Is this a fun one?
That fun?
It's actually pretty scary.
And June is back there.
(laughing)
(gasps)
Ollie, who do you see?
- Captain Hook.
- Are you gonna get a picture with him?
- Yeah.
- Ow wee.
-  You see him?
- But is he nice?
- I mean its Captain Hook, he's
not like the nicest person.
But I don't think he's
gonna like hurt you.
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
Give him a high fives.
(laughing)
-  Finn are you scared?
(upbeat calming music)
(upbeat pop music)
- I see Jack the Christmas.
-  Are you so excited?
-  Look it.
-  Oh my goodness,
that's The Nightmare Before Christmas huh?
- Yeah.
-  Alright let's go ride it.
- The Haunted Mansion gets turned into
The Nightmare Before Christmas
ride during the fall season.
And the boys are so
excited, especially Ollie.
To ride it.
And normally it's a really long wait,
but we actually got fast passes.
-  Christmas
powing, Christmas powing.
- We're also hoping to
meet Jack and Sallie today.
-  Look it.
-  Oh my goodness.
(upbeat calming music)
- This this owing, this is owing.
(Missy gasps)
-  Are you gonna
go? Are you scared?
-  I'm not scared.
-  Okay.
(upbeat music)
-  It's like one
of my favorite movies.
-  He's so excited.
(upbeat music)
-  What do you think so far, Ollie?
Is that scary?
No?
(laughs)
(upbeat relaxing music)
(upbeat spooky pop music)
(upbeat spooky pop music)
We just went on The
Nightmare Before Christmas
and it was so cool.
You were not scared at all, huh?
And we really really wanted to meet Jack
but it is a little bit of a wait.
So I think we might come back
another day to meet Jack.
But he looked pretty cool, a
little bit that we saw huh?
(Missy chuckles)
- Yes, now we are eating some lunch.
Yum, at the French park,
it is like our favorite place to eat.
And then we're off to have some more fun.
So I was thinking that
Disneyland is amazing
but it could be really fun if these guys
actually fit the characters.
Should we do a little
Disneyland magic right now?
Okay, are you ready?
Say one, two, three!
Oh my goodness look at this magic.
Disney magic has turned
you into Mickie Mouse.
(squeaking)
(Missy Gasps)
And you're Donald Duck?
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.
And you are Minnie Mouse?
-  Yeah.
-  You guys are so cute.
I love it.
These kids are so cute.
But we're really freaking
(laughs) dying about this one.
Look at how cute he
is, totally passed out.
-  That is so funny.
(Missy laughs)
-  Are you okay?
It's so cute we're gonna try
and get a picture with them.
But he's like "Um, I'm sleeping."
What are you doing?
-  Donald Duck,
what happened, buddy?
(laughing)
It's so funny.
- I feel like I'm holding
an actual duck right now.
(laughing)
-  Look at his little
tail, it looks so funny.
-  Look at Goofy.
-  Skeleton.
-  What is he?
- The Skeleton.
-  Yeah, that's so cool.
(upbeat pop music)
So we were thinking about
going to California Adventures,
but apparently there's a huge line.
Corbin's telling us the news.
- Costs to get in.
-  What.
- Yeah.
-  I'm not waiting in that line.
- Both the line for
this lane and California
like going like
- Oh.
- So it looks like it's people.
-  I've never seen it like that.
- That was crazy.
- It must be for like the Mickey
Mouse trick or treat thing.
We're definitely not
waiting in that hugs line.
So I think we're actually gonna head home.
But I am going to give
you some cotton candy.
Does that sound good?
(kisses)
You were so good today,
we had such a fun day.
I actually just discovered
that I have some sort of
injury on my right like hip.
I think from running,
I'm gonna blame it on
Kelsey, just kidding.
(laughs)
I like can barely walk.
So I'm like, "Hmm maybe we should go home,
I'm in a lot of pain right now."
So anyways that's where we're headed now.
And Donald Duck is still sleeping in here.
(laughing)
- Well hey guys, would
you look who's here.
-  What's up dudes.
- Good.
- What did you guys do today?
- Go at Disneyland.
-  You did?
-  Yeah.
- That is so cool.
Yeah well, Missy was at Disneyland
I stayed at home and
got so much work done.
It was actually very nice.
Ollie wants to tell you something.
What?
- There was a Nightmare
For Christmas ride.
- There was?
-  Yes.
- We've been watching that move a lot,
did you go on the ride?
- Yes.
- And what did you think?
- I didn't be scared.
- You didn't be scared?
-  No.
- Yeah, cause it's not very scary right?
It's more fun, yeah.
What did you think at the end?
- It was pretty cool.
- Did any ghost come home with you?
- No
-  No. Did any ghosts
come home with you Finn?
(cartoon music)
(laughing)
He's so wiped out.
Both these kids came home
and they are exhausted.
So I made sure to have
pizza here for them,
so that they could just chill and eat.
But sounds like they had so much fun.
And Ollie just like,
loved The Nightmare Before Christmas ride.
Which I think is amazing.
I feel like it means
we're raising him right.
Because we watch
Nightmare Before Christmas
so much in this house.
-  Hey babe, how you feelin?
- I'm okay.
My like leg really hurts.
Like I can't even like bend it out.
It must have like, just
by walking at Disneyland
it must've like made it really inflamed.
-  Yeah, well you
have been working out a ton,
so I'm sure that's what it is.
- Yeah I'm sure, I just
think I have to rest on it.
I read it, I think it's
called the I.T. Band.
-  Oh yeah.
And you wore your watch all day?
- Yup.
- Your new Apple Watch?
How many steps did it say you took?
- I don't know, I don't
understand how to read it.
(laughing)
-  Okay I'll help you.
By the way you can see
mine and Charles (chuckles)
Charles Tripeze activity data.
He did 146 today, I saw he
did a light run earlier.
-  He did that like all day.
Like he did that in the
beginning of the day.
-  Oh that's funny.
So you're on sharing.. let's see.
Oh here it is.
So you did, those are
your stats, 4900 steps.
- That's nothing.
- 2.2 miles.
That's a easy Disneyland day.
- Right.
- And my leg is literally burning.
Like ow, I'm like, we
barley did anything so.
-  Bummer.
- Guys there's a rainbow outside.
- There's a rainbow outside?
- Yeah.
-  Let's go see
it, let's go see it.
Apparently the boys
have spotted a rainbow.
Oh wow what's outside?
Holy. Wow.
-  The sky is like
pink and red. Holy cow.
You guys can't even see it how we can.
This is all like so pink, you guys.
I thinks its from all those fires.
Did you guys see the
fires driving back home?
- Oh yes.
-  Yeah, I think that
probably partially from that.
That is amazing.
I actually wanna go to
the top of the slide
and see if I can get a better shot.
You guys stay here and look
at the sky from there okay?
(wind blowing)
-  Alright the top.
Can see a little better. WoW.
That's crazy. That's
so funny that the boys
are like, "There's a rainbow.",
well it's just red, it's
not actually a rainbow.
(chuckles)
That's nuts you guys.
We get some great sunsets
out here, amazing.
Alright boys, you had a fun day?
-  Mm-hmm.
- Yes, I'm so happy for you guys.
Someone smells like poop.
(chuckles)
Anyway I think that's
all for today's video.
Be sure to click that thumbs up button.
- Yeah!
-  Thumbs up, thumbs up.

to watch more fun Disneyland videos.
