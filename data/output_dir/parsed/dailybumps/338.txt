anything else so funny that kid he could
be so dramatic sometimes about the
littlest things quite hilarious I just
got back some getting my nails done and
actually went with a color I never do
and I was like really nervous about it
but it is red really really red and then
my ring finger is like sparkly and then
I went on my toes black sparkly and it's
a little bit of a hint of what we're
going to be doing this bit yeah I did it
because I was like I just I'm going to
be festive for what we're going to be
doing this but anyways I'm home stands
at that little meanie so throwing things
at me and I'm actually really excited
because something came in the mail that
I've been wanting to do with the kids
for a long time and that is a little
easel and I we also got some art stuff
so it's got like paint brushes and then
some paper this is something I've been
wanting to do for a while especially I'm
just getting warmer outside I won't be
able to set up spot the kids to do it's
a little overwhelming for me to do
because sometimes I think about the
process of what would go into this and
how they're probably only going to enjoy
it for like 15 minutes and then
everything's doing a mess and there's me
paint everywhere so that's like my life
mom
best whenever I think about doing this
but I know it's really important for
them to like do art stuff and kind of
get creative and I just really really
want to help they're like that kind of
part of their development is like
creativity and stuff so I'm going to do
it one thing I should've grabbed was
probably like little smock
so that if they got paint on them it
wouldn't be a big deal but I think I
have a way that I can implement
improvise for that for now but anyways
I'm going to set this up and we're going
to paint you tiny you excited to see
what it takes to put together an easel
big AHA yeah
then we have the paper so this side is a
whiteboard and then this side a
chalkboard but then you can also put
paper on either side yeah that's cool
this side I think the paper can go in
and then you can you smash it so it
looks yeah maybe we'll all I do paint on
this side and Finn dude chalk on this
side by the pointing today he's agree
