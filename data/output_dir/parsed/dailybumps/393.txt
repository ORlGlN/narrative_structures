all the time Oh
poly is about to drive Ashley said he
just hit the high requirements defined
so the first time he's ever been on so
everything is decorated right now for
the Lunar New Year it is a year of the
rooster which makes sense because we got
rid of our rooster because he was
attacking everyone but it's cool because
they have like music and dance going on
and they had all types of different
boots they had like Korean they had
Vietnam and I had some dumplings and
they were amazing and will definitely
tide me over till dinner cool that is he
does that for the lunar year let me know
in the comments if you guys are
celebrating that as well may be
interesting to know everyone went on for
the soaring right so yes in order did
you never watch the parade and then go
on Buzz Lightyear while there wait in
line for soaring because all you can't
right so yeah ha too small maybe next
year ha ok
I think jackets each individual
holy what's coming
that's right
