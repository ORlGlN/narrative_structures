Whoa.

- Hi guys, welcome to
Missy and Bryan's video.
I'm with my buddy, Ollie, here, right?
- Yeah.
- And I thought that we would
vlog for Missy and Bryan
because they're headed back
from Las Vegas right now.
What are you?
- (baby talk)
-  Is he a abominable snowman?
- Yeah.
-  You look so terrifying,
give me your best roar.
- No.
(roaring)
- Watch my roar.
-  Okay. (laughs)
-  Watch my roar.
-  What's your roar?
(roars)
-  Finn?
-  Let's hear your roar.
(roars)
-  (laughs) Good
Job, Boys, Good job.
We're outside right now, it is absolutely
actually freezing, Mom.
It is freezing.
It's freezing.
-  There are
people out in the East Coast
dealing with a snowpocalypse or something.
- All right, fine, it's above average.
-  Snowmageddon, or--
- No, it's like 50 or 60 out.
-  A bomb cyclone,
that's what they called it.
- Bomb cyclone.
We're outside playing with Koda right now
and the other dogs, and
we're just hanging out.
-  Okay, are you gonna
put Auntie on your zip line?
-  Yeah, I don't want her to fall.
-  You don't want her to fall?
Yeah, I don't think she wants to fall.
Whoa.
- Don't touch that wire.
- I won't.
-  All right, all right,
we gotta help her down at the bottom.
We got uncle down there.
- I will not touch the wire.
-  Okay.
- One, two, three.
(screaming)
-  Oh!
-  Oh!
Okay, she kinda hit the bottom.
Kinda hit the bottom.
-  My turn, my turn!
-  Okay, is it your turn?
Here we go! (laughs)
-  (screams)
-  So we put a lower
handle for Finn this time
so he's not reaching so high up.
All right, your turn?
Okay, go for it!
Here he comes!
-  (screams)
-  Yay!
All right, it's Ollie's turn.
Here we go.
Woo hoo!
- All right, ready? Go back!
-  All right
we added the other two dogs to the mix.
We had to wear out Koda a little bit
before we brought the other dogs out.
Otherwise, he just gets all mad at them.
I think we wore him out
pretty good. (laughs)
(dog barking)
-  Poor Karma, though,
he hasn't got the ball once.
He's getting old.
-  Oh, look at that.
-  Oh, a sneak attack.
-  Yay!
-  Hey guys.
-  Karma's like, oh my God.
-  Where'd it go?
-  Please start throwing it.
-  (laughs)
-  Good job.
Karma is like, I'm
never gonna drop it now.
All right, well I had such
a fun day with you guys
you know that?
- Yeah.
- What did we do today?
Can you tell them what we did?
- Yeah.
- We filmed a super,
super fun video together.
It was very interesting.
We tried our best.
If you guys wanna click
the I-card right there
you guys can check out the video
that me, Ollie, and Finn, and
my dad, and everybody filmed
while Missy and Bryan were gone.
You guys can see the mess we made.
But I'm actually gonna
leave, so, I love you.
- Love you too.
- You look like Mimi. (laughs)
All right, bye, buddy.
-  Bye Mimi.
- Bye sweetie, I love you.
-  Bye sweetie.
-  (laughs)
-  (shout) We're home!
-  What's up, boys?
- Give Mommy a hug.
-  Aww, we missed you.
-  How was Mimi
and Papa, was it fun?
- Yeah.
-  Did you hang
out with Auntie today?
- Mm-hmm.
-  (gasps) I was kinda--
-  What'd you do?
- We did a big slide video,
and there was a big green rope above it.
-  Oh, cool.
- There was just a muddy pipe in there.
- Oh my goodness, I think
he's telling secrets
from Auntie's video.
Look, even Karma missed us.
Did you miss Mama, too?
We got the best welcome home, though.
- I'm not old enough
to climb this anymore.
-  Yeah, you gotta
just go up the door, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- So while we were in Vegas
we got the boys some little presents.
- We have goodies for you!
You wanna see?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Oh, my Karma!
-  Sit down and pet him.
-  Look at those dogs, they're like
wait, presents for us?
-  (laughs)
Oh, maybe you got some.
Come here Lena, come.
- I don't know which one
you guys are gonna get
so I'm gonna give you
each one of these, okay?
- I feel it.
-  Okay, open it up.
What is is?
Open it, open it, open it!
- Dragon.
-  What is it?
Awe!
-  Whoa, it's a dragon?
- No, it's a little puppy.
-  Oh, it's a puppy?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Hmm, I think it's a dragon.
- No, it's a puppy.
-  Okay, but
which one is that, Ollie?
-  Let's see, Finn.
What is it Finn?
-  See which one Finn got.
Which one did Finn get?
-  What is it?
-  Whoa.
-  Is that a kitty cat?
-  They're little sculptures.
They're made out of wood, Ollie.
Someone carved it.
- Cool, we can put that
up on your shelf, huh?
-  Let's put it on.
- Okay.
-  (laughs) Good job.
All right, I got one more
present for you boys, okay?
What'd you think is in here?
What'd you think is in this box, Ollie?
- I don't know.
-  You'll never guess.
What about you, Finn?
What'd you think is in it?
- Yah.
-  What's you think is it?
All right, open it up, boys!
Open it up!
- It's a hard one to open, here--
-  They're going to love this.
- There we go, it opens from the top.
-  Yeah, it's kinda upside down.
- Yay!
-  What is that?
-  What is it, guys?
- Whoa.
A scorpion?
-  It's your
very own scorpion, boys.
- Is it real?
-  Yeah.
- It's real inside.
-  Yeah, that's a
real scorpion inside there.
We got it from Vegas.
- Really?
-  Because they
have lots of scorpions.
- But is it real?
-  Yeah.
-  It's real.
- Do they have a spider one?
-  I don't know,
they had a scorpion
and a butterfly, so I
thought, you know what,
my boys, they would
like the scorpion, huh?
- I really like this one.
-  You like it?
- I like black ones and red ones.
-  Awe.
-  Yeah.
So it was a good present?
- Yeah.
-  Yay!
- Wait, do you have one more present?
-  No.
- I have a little present for you guys.
-  Mommy has some presents.
-  One more, okay?
-  Hey, what'd you say to daddy?
-  Thank you, daddy.
-  You're welcome.
- It's really cool because it has pinchers
and that yellow stinging tail.
-  Yeah.
Ollie is obsessed with scorpions
so when I saw it, I was like
"Oh, they're going to love that."
We see them everywhere around here.
- Okay, ready?
Your other prize is...
Chocolate pajamas!
-  Oh yeah, we got you pajamas
from the Hershey store!
Look, they have like little
chocolate guys on them. (laughs)
Pajamas, mom, that's not a present.
-  Say, thank you mama.
- Thank you, mama.
- Aww well, Finn likes them.
(feel-good music)
- I am getting the kids ready for bed
and I have missed putting them to bed
the last couple of nights.
But, they were so good for Mimi and Papa
and so, I'm so proud of them.
Slept in your bed all night.
There was one night where
he got a little nervous
and needed Mimi, huh?
- Yeah.
- But the other night, he did great.
I did get something in the mail
that I ordered a little while ago.
It's this little Okay to Wake owl
and I'm really excited about it
because his little eyes, when you press
turn yellow, and it kinda
plays a little lullaby.
What it also does is
in the morning, when
it's time to wake up--
I set the timer for
them to wake up at 7AM.
They can press it, and if it turns green
it'll say, "Good morning,
it's time to wake up."
And so, they know not to get out of bed
until the eyes are green.
Isn't that pretty cool?
- Yeah.
- So they're excited about it too
because they always are like--
They don't necessarily know
if it's too early to get up.
Other than, I tell them to not
get up until the sun is up.
But, (laughs) you know
I think it can be difficult sometimes
so I was like, "All right, in
the morning you press this."
If it says it's time to wake
up, or if the lights are green
that means go, go, go, huh?
- Go, go, go.
-  Go, go, go see mama.
- Yeah, yeah.
- If they press it just a little too early
it'll say, "Go back to bed."
or, "It's almost time to get up."
but the eyes will still be yellow.
So, I'm excited!
I'm hoping it works.
We'll see how it works, huh?
- Yeah.
-  You're gonna stay
in bed until the lights are--?
- Open.
- Green! (laughs)
All right, kids are in bed.
We have had a long day driving.
It's so nice, though, to be home
and it's so nice just to be with the kids.
Putting them to bed is just
always really cute and fun.
I think we're gonna go
ahead and end the vlog
so we can go to bed (laughs).
We drove for like five hours.
It was a long drive.
I hope you enjoyed today's video.
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up, if you did.
We'll see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
(lively music)
