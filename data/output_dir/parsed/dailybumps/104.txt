- She can do it, huh Finn?
- Mhmm.
- Say, "Go auntie, go!"
- Go Aunt t-t!
- Say, "Go auntie, go!"
- Go Aunt t-t!
- Go Aunt t-t!
♫ This is our life

-  Good morning!
- Say, "Good morning!"
- We at Mimi's house!
- We're at Mimi's house,
huh? And who's here?
Who's here?
- Ahhh! Muah!
-  Auntie!
(all laughing)
-  He's so excited.
He's actually pretty excited
because last time he was here,
he filmed a really fun video
with auntie, and I think
he's like, "Are we gonna do that again?"
- So, what are we doing now?
- So, if you haven't seen that
video, I'll have it linked
up here because they swam in slime,
and she actually convinced Finn to do it.
- And he was ...
- He was actually pretty into it!
- So, if you guys wanna
see that hilarious video,
make sure you go check it out.
But we're actually filming
another fun video with Papa!
Papa's always the best in the videos.
And I actually helped out
with this one, so I'm excited.
I'm gonna try and finish filming it.
Oh, look! My dad did
this not too long ago,
and he's building a little
chest that's gonna be
built in here.
I think it's gonna look really cool.
So I just got done filming
that video of Cassey and my dad
and, just so you know,
these are some of the items
that they used, and it
was pretty hilarious.
I'll have to let you know
when that video is out.
But now, Cassey is being
so nice and she's gonna go
pick up Ollie from school.
And so, I'm just hanging out
at my mom's having some lunch,
playing some video games.
Fin's over there eatin' over there.
Just so you know, guys,
I am completely obsessed with
my Switch and with Mario.
Particularly Mario.
And I just beat the whole game,
but apparently, when you
beat it, you don't beat it.
There's just tons and tons more to do.
And it's, like, actually
a little overwhelming.
But I'm loving this game, so
if you guys don't have it,
you're crazy, 'cause it's the best.
It's so much fun.
It's so much fun when
there's just down time.
I'm like, "I'm gonna play
my game for a little bit."
And I already beat it. I'm
like way ahead of Bryan, so.
I'm such a gamer guys.
So Finn is trying to take a nap at Mimi's
and so, I set him up with
a little show to watch
and hopefully to fall asleep
that I thought I'd show.
(light piano music)
Shhhh. Hi, my baby.
He looks so tiny in that big ol' bed,
but I'm hoping he falls asleep.
Hopefully that didn't just
disturb him and he'll be like,
"What are you doing?"
Hey dude! You're back!
How excited were you when you
saw Auntie come pick you up?
- Yeah.
-  Were you so happy?
- He was so excited. He was so happy.
-  Was he?
- Yeah.
-  Was he playing?
- No, he was eating his lunch.
-  Eating his lunch,
and he probably got so excited.
- He was so excited. Muah!
-  Did you tell
everyone that's your Auntie
and she's the bestest?
- Um, yeah.
- She is the best. Muah. Am I right?
- Yep, now we're all just
hangin' out at Mimi and Papa's
and playin' and they're just
so happy to have Auntie here.
- Rawr!
(Auntie laughs)
-  Did you take your nap, bud?
- No!
-  No!
-  You never ...
- Never. Oh, losing his hand.
- We are now at our
house and Auntie is over
and Finn is playing with her
and he's so happy right now.
Let me show ya.
And they're on the Boosted Board!
(Auntie making noises)
-  We're gonna see if we can turn.
See if we can turn
without hitting the car.
-  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
- Woo! We're good.
Should we go down the hill?
-  Uh-huh!
- Alright, he said yeah so ...
-  He's a daredevil.
Oh my gosh.
(Missy screaming)
(Missy laughing)
-  Auntie doesn't
know how to work it.
-  Okay, ready? Go!
- Auntie's scared.
(Missy laughing)
-  You can't even see Finn's face
'cause he's got Spiderman.
(upbeat music)
-  Oh my gosh you're going so fast!
(upbeat music)
-  Ah! There are the dare devils!
-  Oh my god!
-  That was actually really fast.
It doesn't look fast,
but it's way too fast.
(Missy laughing)
-  Backin' it up,
backin' it up, backin' it up.
-  You havin' fun?
-  He loves it.
Here they come, here they come!
(Auntie screaming)
Alright, Auntie's gonna
experiment on our ...
-  I'm really scared!
-  You can do it!
- I'm literally just holding the break.
(Missy laughing)
-  Alright, go faster!
-  No! I don't wanna fall!
-  You can do it!
She can do it, huh, Finn?
-  Mhmm.
-  Say, "Go Auntie, go!"
-  Go Aunt t-t.
- Say, "Go Auntie, go!"
- Go Aunt t-t!
- Go Aunt t-t! Go t-t go!
- Go Aunt t-t!
- It's so cute, he calls
her t-t. You're so cute.
Oh, here she comes. Back up.
Oh, that's pretty good.
Now you're makin' me wanna go.
Finn was like, "Kay, I'm going again."
- Let's go. Say, "Bye guys!"
-  Bye!
-  Alright, we
found an even better ride!
(Ollie screaming)
Here goes the boys!
-  I don't think Ollie likes it.
-  Ollie is not
as adventurous as Finn.
-  I think it's
'cause we traumatized him
with the hill.
-  I think so.
Ready? Woo!
(Ollie screaming)
Ollie does not, he's not a fan.
You wanna go with Auntie?
- Yeah.
-  Finn's like,
"Uh, I'm having a blast."
-  Ollie, would you
look at that? What do you see?
Look up in the sky.
What do you see up there?
- Um, cotton candy clouds!
-  Yeah, dude, look!
The pink clouds are back!
Cotton candy clouds are in the air.
What's up, babe?
- It's so pretty out here.
- Hey guys. I have not
been on the vlog today.
- He's been workin'!
- Livin' and workin'.
- We should fly up there and eat those!
-  Really? Oh, we
should fly up in the sky
and eat that cotton candy.
- Look at that side. That is so pretty.
-  Oh, wow.
This is right in the view
of our courtyard here.
Look at that sky, that's incredible!
- That's crazy. It's amazing.
- It's so beautiful.
Yeah, hey guys. Missy's
been vlogging all day,
but I've been at the house filming
for something really special.
We have a special video
going up in a couple days.
And it's been super fun, but I'm done!
So, now I get to hang out with the fam!
I feel like sometimes, being a YouTuber,
people say, like, "Oh, you just
sit at home and do nothing."
That is not the truth.
So, yeah, I put in a lot of work today.
And it feels really good.
But yeah, sometimes even being a YouTuber,
you're still dealing with work. Work.
- I know, and it's not
just, like, filming videos.
-  It's fun work, though.
- It's a lot. It's more than that, though.
- Yeah, there is a lot
more that goes into it.
And maybe we can talk about that,
or even share, like, what works for us,
business wise and stuff.
- We are running a business.
-  Yeah. Yes we
are. Aren't we, Ollie?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah.
- We work hard, huh?
- Sometimes, Ollie
like, "Can we just play?
And, like, can you guys
come hang out with me?"
And I'm like, "I'm sorry, dude!
I've really gotta finish this!" Huh?
- Yeah.
- But now I'm here. Can I have a big hug?
Arg. Hi, dude!
Did you have a good day at school?
- Yeah.
- What did you do?
- I learned the, Mama, what letter?
- S!
- S!
- S, he learned the letter
S. And what starts with s?
- Um, scorpion.
- Scorpion.
Snake.
- Snake.
- That's a pretty good s one, huh?
- From Ninjago.
(Bryan laughing)
- Oh, only a Ninjago
snake starts with an s.
That's so cool, dude!
- Yeah!
(techno music)
- It is such a good night.
I the kids dinner nice and
early, and I am working on
me and Bryan's dinner
and I'm making something
that I've made a couple
times this fall season,
which is chicken pot pie.
And I usually, I never
remember early enough
to put the chicken in the Crock-Pot.
So it's nice and shredded.
And I also read that you can
always get Rotisserie chicken
and shred that, but I
haven't done that either.
I just had a bunch of chicken in there,
so I cooked it up.
Then, what I decided
to do, 'cause I've been
wanting to do this
forever is I shredded it.
And it actually shredded pretty nicely for
chicken I just cooked up on the stove.
It kind of just, like, shredded apart.
It was, like, super juicy.
So, I'm pretty much impressed
with myself right now,
'cause I am not a cook.
And I've got all my veggies.
We're just doing corn,
green beans, and carrots.
Those are the ones I can handle.
There's not a lot of
vegetables that I'm like,
super excited about, but
these ones, I can handle.
And I probably will
pick around the carrots.
I know, I am so bad.
I'm really excited about
my chicken, though.
I feel like it looks pretty dang good.
It looks like it's starting to dry out,
so I'm gonna get this in here,
so I can start making my pot pie.
Alright, my pie shell is made.
I've got all my goodie
goodness inside of it.
I've gotta top it off.
And I'm FaceTiming my mom right now.
(laughing)
And, uh, yeah. It looks delicious!
I'm hungry now.
