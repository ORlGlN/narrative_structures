is just staring at you like hey I'm here
alright so missing I had a business call
in here and we tried to put all the in
front of frozen so that he would watch
and maybe be still and let us finish the
conversation as you can tell from this
right here right
deep loudest toy oh yeah I did his
little pump I popper yeah like take it
and I put it up there and he just
started screaming like a go
what happened buddy I thought you liked
frozen he just wanted to be with mom
line
dad dad hi buddy dad good morning
hey morning good morning someone's got a
case of the Mondays yeah he only just
got done dancing - frozen honestly
all morning - he's been asking to watch
frozen and I have been blatantly
ignoring him just pretending that I
don't know what it means or what he's
trying to say
just cuz I'm like I think I've had
enough I think we've had enough it's
pretty but Ollie has not had enough we
really need to take a break buddy I love
that he loves it and I'm going to watch
it because he loves it but oh man
everytime when so much of it
mm-hmm coming over thing quartzite it is
a ve a beautiful day here in sunny
Southern California you guys look at
that it's bright but it's actually kind
of chilly it's kind of chilly calm are
you sure I don't think you want to go in
that pool right now I don't think you
want to oh crap look what happened this
happens sometimes our hot tub has
completely drained itself ro I think I
always switch the like two parts on the
wrong way and so there's nothing holding
the water in and so it drains into the
pool and so then it empties like that
after have
Poole for almost a year now I still have
not completely figured out how to run
this thing we lunch as a family coz
Missy had to go to San Diego for her
doctor's appointment and so we just
ain't here at Panera we had a good lunch
on buddy yeah I know he's quite upset
right now and then
Missy's going to San Diego and I'm
staying here with oli because I have
some stuff I got to do around town and
so Missy's mom came by and picked Missy
up so they could go to San Diego
together Missy had to grab the other
camera from the car and she locked it
and I told her babe I have no key don't
lock it but she locked it and now we're
stranded Allie are we stranded and he's
a stranded can you say thanks mama yeah
this is happening so Missy was about 15
minutes away and so now we're just
waiting for her to get back so we can
unlock the car and resume our day right
you threw your diaper stuff down there
huh oh hi say hi Oh careful say hi I say
come on mama hurry up come on mama hurry
up we're stranded at least it's really
nice out here and it's not too bad and
we're back in the car Thank You Missy
she just drove by and unlocked the car
for us
now I day can resume yay hi mom now we
are headed to my doctor's appointment I
went to lunch with
missed him but he had to get some stuff
done either I go to bake and do some
taxes and all that stuff this point is
going to be super boring I think it's
just going to be going there and
listening to the heartbeat and I think
it is exciting so I was like well if
you're going to stay here then let's
listen to the heartbeat in the morning
and we just like you know that would
basically be the appointment so me and
all am prizes the sporting signs of bed
and we just like listen to the heartbeat
for a second with the Doppler so that
was really reassuring I definitely don't
like to go talk to doctors appointments
without hearing the heartbeat beforehand
just as I get really anxious that there
is no doctor's appointments so I just
want to be like oh yeah it's not going
to be a problem they're going to hear it
right away so it was pretty easy to find
the heartbeat and so it's really nice
like I don't have to worry when I go
into my doctor's appointment that way
otherwise I'd literally have like panic
attacks have scared like sheep camp
right now just to be like you're Doppler
stupid you're just enough to give me an
old weeks down and then I'll be really
excited I won't be like nervous at all
but we are running late because I had to
get the camera out of the car and then I
had the keys because we went to lunch
and so I was like alright bye I left him
at lunch and then I went to the car and
I got my camera and then I locked the
car and I thought that I unlocked it
immediately so that Brian and all I
could get in the car to leave and I
didn't or it didn't work or something so
we had to drive all the way back and so
now we are running 20 minutes late
oh not a breath now I just talked for
way too long
alright guys as you can see from this
over here I am in my doctor's
appointment and I was just like thinking
about the fact that I've been in this
room so many times at these pictures on
the wall still completely creeped me out
like this one is so weird like the head
is weird and the way there's like four
heads that are all I connected in some
weird way is just weird like they're so
creepy
I hate um they've been here for so long
I feel like they just need to like
rotate some better pictures oh this
one's just weird this is the one I have
to stare at
the head is so cone-shaped too weird
it's just staring at you like hey I'm
here alright Ali I think that suckers
gone you're just chewing on the stick
now I had to run to the bank um to do
like a bunch of stuff and he was being
such a goober and he climbed up on the
bankers desk grabbed a sucker unwrapped
it and then you handed him the trash
didn't you while you're signing out that
you did you really wanted that sucker
and then you just start eating and look
at he ate the whole thing

all gone say all done I've done I've
been having to do so much and he's been
such a good boy while Missy's at our
