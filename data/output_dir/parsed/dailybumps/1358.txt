Missy got me this hat um I don't
remember you guys probably remember more
stuff than I do
to be honest I'm just gonna say it but
yeah it is a bit a hat kind of week and
actually I was just thinking about I was
like this is like one of the busiest
weeks of our life this is like the
living room of a true parent am i right
can I get an amen
I know you guys can agree with me on
this but oh look at this even daddy DAPA
think Missy just changed dolly this is
like my our life now apparently actually
you guys saw in yesterday's vlog that we
were doing some house hunting boo boo um
and I'm actually really excited with
that just because we live like we are in
our own house in this room obviously
like Olly normally probably wouldn't
play in a living room we'd probably have
like a separate place you know actually
we're looking at places that have like
nice little loft areas so I cannot have
my office in there and all I can like
play and stuff but you know what we're
working with what you got and that's
what life is about sometimes just
working with what you got now I need to
make it appear like a normal living room
and clean all this up so oh you know we
aren't done in a while you guys YouTube
magic check this out brah voila clean
living room and I think I yeah I spit on
the camera time for the night
boom these players are I know yeah Brian
Ashley just body he said they were like
$0.99 are they good Hayes good as the
other one
now give the other one what they'll do
they'll do let's give you a good one he
likes to feed himself
hmm do you think okay oh yeah you guys
should check out his little bump it has
gone down tremendously it's actually now
just like a little cut there's no
swelling or anything so it seems to have
healed very well so I'm happy about that
what do you think tweets and lunch
here's a nice okay it's not one you
wanted it do you want the sour one
there's a sharing blueberries how cute
Oh Oh car was like I'll take some I
totally forgot that I actually got this
in the peel box
I'm like a week ago shout out whoever
left me if there was no name but it's
huh it's a Lego figurine of Hagrid from
Harry Potter I just add it to my little
collection here I wonder if they have a
hairy one this is kind of like my little
area of geekness that I'm allowed to
have I have a whole lot more things but
if I had them on top of the TV Missy
would probably divorce me Ollie are
these your blueberries hey don't touch
my blueberries the cool thing is only 99
cents at Albertson's alright that one
wasn't hey let me try another one that
one wasn't let me try another one that
one was right
you got a sour one yeah you're choosing
the wrong ones do you guys see little
Harry Potter mark he's got humpbacks I
started to he totally looks like Harry
Potter doesn't he
okay guys this is happening okay for all
your Harry Potter fans out here we're
gonna recreate a little something wait I
need you you're the most pivotal part
okay stand in front of him okay and then
you have to protect him
that's how I gets so go about a Kadabra
and then you fall cuz you're dead I
killed you this is really happening and
then we have the Boy Who Lived I'm not
able to kill you cuz you're just too
cute maybe that's why Voldemort couldn't
kill Harry cuz he's just too cute are
you still pretending to be day
you're so cute buddy
yay he's been wanting to come outside
all day hon dude he's swingin he's
swinging and we're gonna play some ball
with Karma hey you playing frisbee with
with what I was gonna call you auntie
but you're not auntie to him I feel like
I know I was like wait that's so weird
it's so funny because a lot of people
are asking if Karma's gonna go with us
to the new house and of course I mean
he's aren't my dog of course he's having
with us but I feel like this girl's
gonna miss him a lot
he's my buddy I know he's both of our
buddies because he was my dog and I
obviously moved in with them and then he
looked she's like really gotten attached
to him but she'll be over all the time
of course we were excited I'm we're
pretty certain we are moving and it's
just going to be us just because it's
kind of getting to that time at the same
time I don't know I'm I I talked about a
little bit yesterday that I have like
such mixed emotions about it so just I
love living here we all do and I
actually I love the fact that Ollie
has such an amazing relationship with
his Mimi and Papa like they are
literally best friends like he just
loves them to death I hope that one day
I'm sure they're actually one day we
will definitely all be together again
and hopefully something with like two
houses on a property or something like
that that would be like ideal that would
be perfect property with Mimi and pop in
one house us in another maybe a house
for aunty yeah we could build our own
little ranch and that would be awesome
guess what guys Cassie just ended her
last day of school and she's officially
a senior here and guess what she ended
her junior year with a 4.0 4.0 I
definitely didn't have a 4.0 and I was
at school like dang girl you like you
literally are doing I know how Napa I
know it did happen we are
we head to another house to go see and
we're also starving as usual so we're
going to grab some food all is back
there playing with his toys actually
normally I have a few guys I think we've
showed it to you bass before but usually
I have tons of toys and the some little
kid came in here and stole them all that
you actually don't know where all those
toys where I think I might have I might
have grabbed them to take them to the
park on Memorial Day and then I probably
just took them into the house instead of
it oh I think there's a bag of toilet
toys in the house yeah he's so funny cuz
he's got car toys he's got in our room
toys he's got his toys in his room he's
at toys for the downstairs and he's got
bath toys he literally has all different
types of toys for each area that he
plays a nut interesting
he's so spoiled alright so a contrary
popular belief and express actually does
not serve pandas that's mean they're
endangered they do serve very fast
Chinese food though and we are crunching
on time
I'm buddy how you doing buddy you
hanging in there you thinking in there
buddy
mm-hmm so we just saw um the first house
on our list and what you think it's a
little small backyard didn't have like
any grass it was like all Tom Cruise
small yeah okay some we're looking for
like seriously if you don't have grass
in the backyard then it's not we need
grass for car yeah we need for karma and
for ollie cuz we home to run around huh
he's such a trooper doh
all right Jack I'm just getting gas
getting gas in the Prius Missy I do this
like once a month I don't think I've got
any gas it forever because he usually
does it without me yeah I don't even do
remember when we like a hat we literally
had to get gas every week once a week 50
bucks yeah 50 bucks a week on gas yeah
we literally we found my videos a month
we less than that even yeah definitely
and like I don't remember the last time
I got gas yeah you always do it for me
so yeah I think that - we're gonna have
to get a big with like the bigger Prius
when we have it the other baby
once you go Prius I don't think you can
go back I know you can't imagine I don't
pay for gas again he just left a couple
of houses and we didn't really get a
chance to vlog it but everyone was
interesting there was you know some
things I didn't quite like about it it
was definitely really nice it was really
big which I really just want more space
like more room always done as you can
get can you guys see we care me right
now I feel like we also have times we
don't have to like rush into something
if we don't love it you know so I liked
the area I liked a lot of things out of
it's kind of hard to really picture us
living there getting ready for bed
homebody where you going hey hey huh
who's that
is that mr. peep it's mr. peep
he's just getting ready to lay down oh
sit down there you go play with mr. Pete

hardwood floors throughout the whole
thing yeah well especially with Olly
