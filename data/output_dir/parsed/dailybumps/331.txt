relax today in the Sun right I got some
fine hey hold your brother's hand Keiko

there actually are alligators in there
that's what that sign says right there
just casually standing next to water
that dinosaurs live in so there's that
been wrong cool you don't want to swim
with the alligators
this is probably the coolest pool setup
I've seen that's not at a water park
they have a lazy river three different
pools two slides and even a splash area
for the kids so we're going to go
explore and see what they want to fight
it look at this dude
look at that it's like ancient ruins
watch out there might be alligators in
there just kidding there's no alligators
look at how cool this is though
by
you

so it's all about the full flash area if
none of the water is deep enough or thin
cannot reach so you have to watch them
still but it's just nice having no
nowhere to keep water and all we can
even run anything flash anywhere and if
so many amazing cool little like things
like this it's all around this is almost
like the Fountain of Youth
