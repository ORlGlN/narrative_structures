what do you think golly what do you
think of the little critter we found it
cute this is the weirdest thing I've
ever seen in my life
my husband is not only watching
basketball no and so is my son I just
heard on the TV is the first that was on
and it I don't know he was like loving
it they're both watching basketball but
we don't watch bad guy just got hit and
his arm was like bleeding all over the
court now they have to like clean the
court uh is interesting anyways good
morning guys say good morning good
morning say morning okay
not a good morning you ready you're
gonna swim it it is another beautiful
Thursday morning and we're headed to
swim hopefully does good
okay so we just walked outside and
there's something in our pool and it
moved a little bit and it kind of looks
like a little baby but you stay here
buddy it's a little bunny rabbit oh he
obviously can't get out are you sure
it's a rabbit
it is a bunny okay hold it tight hold it
tight he's obviously hurt oh it is very
cute baby but they are wild out here you
know no it's very cute it is very cold
Holly wants to see it's gonna clean you
up it's so close to Easter my gosh busy
that's crazy that was in our pool do you
think it probably hopped in and then
swam over there and then yeah I think I
feel like it fell in you know how long
could it have been in there
she's definitely calling swear this
happens to me though so so much way too
often
yeah the squirrel the butterfly the dog
yeah remember somehow this is somehow
this always happens
is it a he or she I don't know I think
you follow balls I can't really tell
little noses moving so I have sent dried
off the rabbit I put in a little box and
I've set it outside to warm up because
it definitely seemed cold nervous scared
so it's in here hey little guy
Brian put a little lettuce in here did
it eat any of it no definitely dry how
you doing hey guy happy it's nice and
cute and fluffy now but now that I my
main thing was like if the rabbit is
healthy and can eat and drink and like
move around and not hurt at all we
should probably let it go because it is
where I'll grab it it may go live in the
wild yeah I just want to make sure that
it can eat and drink and it is healthy
and stuff maybe we'll find a really nice
place for it to go to cuz this is not a
very good area for rabbits like dogs and
there's dogs in every single yard yeah
but it seems much happier and jumpy and
now you make me want to have a rabbit
now for all the Pharaoh Pharaoh we just
got our blue apron box and Missy is
putting away some of the fresh
ingredients scallions parsley all kinds
of crazy cilantro vegan cookies later
fresh chopped chicken so the two recipes
that we have are the adobo style chicken
with wild rice and pan-roasted salmon
with roasted cauliflower oh those look

could take care of it but the thing is
that humans really can't take care of
rabbits like this he was able to dry off
eat a little bit and now we're gonna set
them in a place where there's not tons
of dogs or animals it's really nice babe

field we saw a little creek there's
protections it it's a good place what do
