- I thought let's just add
some cookies in there to
so everyone can snack on cookies.
Ali's helping me?
You being such a good helper?
Alright let's do this.
(happy music)
♫ Wherever you are
♫ That's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ This is home
♫ Just running around
you've never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight
♫ Cuddlin' all I could saying
♫ I am home
♫ Home forever you're with me
- Good morning and Happy Labor Day!
Missy what are you doing girl?
- I'm going to the gym.
-  She's got her gym clothes on.
- And I've got these brand
new little like headphones
and I'm so excited about them.
-  Yes I bought her these new,
they're called Powerbeats,
and they're made for working
out and they're wireless.
- I feel so fancy with them on.
I'm like look at me
I'm like a real gymmer.
- Anyway Finn is having
so much fun jumping around in my office,
the boys are going crazy,
and mamma's leaving forever.
-  The kids club is closed today.
-  He's seriously
like a mini daredevil.
Are you a mini Ali?
Are you a mini Ali?
Can you say good morning?
What's he doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
(laughter)
He is so cute this morning alright,
Missy's going to the gym.
She's leaving me here with the boys.
It's Labor Day.
We're gonna have family over
and have a really fun day.
Good morning Ali what do you get to do?
- Get to put two balls in.
-  You get to put one and
two balls in your jar!
What happens when you fill this up?
- I get a toy!
-  That's so cool.
Ali's been following all his rules.
- And we've been keeping up on this again;
kind of stop doing it.
And he was so good
yesterday he didn't have to
flip any cards.
So you get two right?
But on a special special occasion
I'm gonna let you put one more in because
you went to bed wait listen,
you went to bed all by yourself.
-  That was so good Ali.
Finn really wants to
put a ball in to.
-  I am so proud of you
so you get one extra
for going to bed all by yourself.
I was so so proud of you.
- Yeah but already put one in.
-  You did good.
- Yes so all we told Ali
yesterday was it's time for bed
and you gotta go to bed huh?
And you went right to your bed,
and you were a little sad,
but you fell asleep huh?
And that's what we're
gonna keep doing okay?
You gotta book?
You wanna read Boss Baby to Finn?
- I already read it.
- Oh you already did read the whole book?
Wow this kid is so smart you guys.
He's in preschool and he
just read a full book!
Good job kiddo!
(happy music)
So I actually had some succulent plants
that I haven't done anything with.
So today I threw them together
in this little planter.
Check that out its got some
moss and its got some rocks and
couple different succulents.
And then this one I
forgot to put in that one.
So I put it in its own
and actually it's good.
You don't want to put too
much in here 'cause these
we want to get nice and big.
But I'm so proud 'cause all of our new
little plants and stuff
are doing so good you guys.
Normally we kill everything.
We kill all the plants
but they've been all really good
especially this one is nice and strong.
I like it.
- Alright so I just got
back from the gym and
I have to be honest with you guys I'm
really proud of myself because I ran
three and a quarter miles today.
I don't think that's ever happened
in the history of my entire life,
like ever ever ever ever.
Like a half a mile maybe.
(laughter)
-  How far did they
make you run in high school?
That's how far you've ran.
- And then me I've done like a 5K
and I've like walked it a
lot you know what I mean?
But like ran?
Like almost the entire way?
Yeah I'm pretty proud of myself.
So anyways I'm proud of myself
so I'm making myself cookies!
(laughter)
We are making regular cookies
but we're just kinda
making them for the family
'cause today we have a
big barbecue going on,
we got tons of food,
tons of snacks;
I thought let's just add
some cookies in there to
so everyone can snack on cookies.
So Ali's helping me.
You being such a good helper?
Alright let's do this.
(happy music)
- The perks of having a grill.
Someone always brings
food over and grills.
It's kind of always nice.
Look at these big ol' steaks we're doing
Labor Day weekend and we even have corn.
We're getting ready for
a yummy feast tonight.
What are you doing?
You shooting aliens?
With Buzz Lightyear?
That's so cool.
Oh it broke?
- Maybe I can get a new one from
(mumbles)
-  Alright food is
served and it looks delicious.
Everything looks so delicious.
We got steak and potatoes
and corn and green beans looks good.
Some of us just got out of the pool.
We've been swimming and having fun.
It's just been a really fun relaxing day
with the whole family;
a bunch of family.
Not everyone I guess but
a bunch of family and
now it's time to eat!
- So I may have just
taught our son something
every kid should know how to do.
How to climb a pole!
-  Oh my goodness.
-  Can you do it?
- I feel like as a kid I
used to climb this pole even.
-  I know it's
just coming full circle.
So jump up!
Oh you can do it
Look at that
-  Look at that!
- Here hold it with your feet remember?
Feet and then push off
-  Wow you are a monkey!
- There you go.
-  Oh my gosh!
(laughter)
Oh my gosh okay?
This is so scary.
(laughter)
- He's stuck on the flag pole.
He's stuck on the flag pole!
You got it Ali you got it.
-  Good job bud!
Daddy will get you.
-  You're tired and
you're willing to fall.
- Did you do it?
-  That was kinda scary.
Okay Finn your turn!
-  Was that fun Ali?
-  You wanna try?
-  Here we go.
-  He's gonna do it actually.
Oh my gosh!
(laughter)
They're both on it.
It's very good!
-  Climb higher Finn higher!
-  Climb go up high!
-  He's like why I'm comfy.
(laughter)
-  I bet if you put
him right here he can hold on.
-  Do it go go go!
-  Okay hold on.
-  Oh my gosh look at him!
(laughter)
You did so good Finn!
Alright Ali you want to try again?
Hop on show me how you climb.
Alright let's go let's go!
You can do it!
- I can't can you help me?
-  You need some help?
Alright Ali you ready?
- Move your feet there you go.
-  And then push off.
Whoa dude you're doing it!
How's that feel?
- You are so strong!
You got it?
- I need the string.
-  He wants to
go all the way up there.
- There you are you got it!
-  Now I just have to hold on.
- I feel like that is
a skill that all kids should know.
He's gotta climb things.
What if he had to climb
to like escape something.
- I used to have a pole
like this right next to our house
so I climbed it and then
got on top of our house.
-  That's pretty
good climbing dude good job!
- We have had such a fun day huh?
My poor little thing has not
been feeling his greatest.
He got a runny nose longer
than like all of us.
He always takes the longest to kinda
get through it and
sometimes he even gets worse
before he gets better.
I wouldn't say he's worse or anything
but he definitely is;
he might be teething
actually also 'cause he's
drooly and sad and just
all around irritable.
So anyways it is bed time for this guy.
We gotta clean you up
and get you to bed okay?
Alright first thing's first.
What do we do first?
We gotta turn on our sound machine!
Well this is like our music machine.
Now what do we do?
He knows everything what to do.
What do we do now?
Did you get it?
And then the light.
Finn we gotta get your jammies on first.
But yes he does have a sound
machine and a music machine
to help keep him asleep and it works.
What is that face you're making?
Can you say goodnight to the baby?
He's like acting shocked it's so cute!
What do you see?
You excited for bedtime?
You got Batman?
Yeah you're Batman!
Say goodnight everyone!
(happy music)
