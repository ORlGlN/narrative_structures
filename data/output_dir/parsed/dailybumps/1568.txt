I had on Friday a lot of you were
extremely concerned about my doctor and
kind of mad at him and so I kind of
explained the situation because I think
people are a little bit confused I don't
actually hate my doctor
I actually really like episode go watch
it all right relax relax
um I don't know what is wrong with you
ah eating yeah I get the problem look at
baby Ollie you're back in their little
cloth diapers huh this one's got
yeah how you feel about it check this
out you guys want one mwah
Missy's camera is in rice yeah she I
don't know it was I think it was up on
the counter and water had gotten on the
counter and so it like completely
covered her camera and when she turned
it on the screen was like all messed up
and warped and so we're hoping it's not
completely ruined so she's gonna have
her cameras it in rice overnight well I
want to shake up the battery out see no
she didn't
there we go yeah so let's see what
happens
hopefully it's fine we shall see in the
mod in the morning but anyway I hope you

subscribe it's in the description below
be sure to give today's vlog a big fat
thumbs up and as always we will see you
guys tomorrow please care I'll put you
in the right cameras so it's not only
way Tammy I think what happened is that
there is a buildup of detergent and so
they're becoming really crisp and not
absorbent that's why I'm hoping that
boiling them and like and then like
taking him out and employing them in
like warfare and rinsing rinsing rinsing
tons of that will hopefully get all the
detergent that's built up in these out
it looks really yellow but they're
actually really white no I don't know
why it looked like that yeah so that's
gonna be my job did it glow I just put
it over there so daddy did something
stupid huh Oliver I'm sorry boy I'll
show you guys right now we're using the
honest diapers because Missy's stripping
hers but it was a little big so I folded
it and now he's complete back
I know he's standing up so his complete
backside covered in pee I'm sorry boy so
yeah they're a tad bit big because we
bought the bigger size
