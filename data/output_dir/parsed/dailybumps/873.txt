a lot of pain you think we're gonna have
it I'm so afraid that it's not a just
such a pain point to the baby you having
a contraction
nope and there's a lot of pain I'm just
gonna go to a hotel and try and get rest
let me know what a pain resting seem to
have slowed things down a little bit and
then I feel like everything's eased up
and I'm a little discouraged and sad
we're just playing this very vicious
waiting game
they have so you get contraction so
degree just relax
is the pain in your lower back yeah
just breathe baby breathe and relax
breathe and relax
all right we got a heating pad here on
Missy's back she's having some pretty
intense back labor and contractions are
pretty irregular but back labor is just
killing her right now so she's been
doing a lot of different things to sort
of relieve it does that help when I push
the pad on you babe
all right I went downstairs and got some
breakfast so that we could fuel up just
don't know what our days gonna look like
hi babe you ended up doing so good since
1:00 a.m.
geez you okay
tired so you woke up at 1 a.m. and what
were you feeling
I couldn't okay I went to bed with back
pain thinking home see what happens and
then I woke up at 1:00 a.m. with it
we're so bad it couldn't sleep anymore
and I couldn't do it anymore so I got up
found something balm just been changing
positions like crazy contractions have
been coming strong not strong kind of
your regular I don't know what to think
of this way oh there's the Midwife
last night at like 1:00 a.m. I woke up
with just severe back pain and again
contractions and I'm just wondering if I
can come in to be checked to see if I'm
progressing and if I'm not I will kind
of just think I should go home have you
always always you always always have the
right to come in and be seen
have you been trying things like
Michelle on the table over to be woke up
with the pain yeah I tried shower/tub I
have a birth ball I've been trying tons
of position counter pressure I also have
been very nauseous and I've also been
throwing up do you think have you been
able to keep food yeah I've been
drinking a lot of water there probably
about 4 to 6 minutes apart somewhat
irregular go and the pain is kind of all
over the place some are really painful
and some are not as painful and I you
know that is really characteristic of
early labor so hopefully you are in
early labor and come to labor and
delivery
whenever you're ready and we'll check
out well figure out what to do
and Missy is hooked up to the monitor
they are monitoring baby's heartbeat and
contractions and we're just going to see
what happened after about 20 minutes and
then they're going to check her check
her cervix and to see where we go from
there
and comfortable still having bad back
labor
they're facing up we can like see their
crystal gift looking right out more turn
to the side so if that is head and this
is bat look at all that fluid you see
all that that is a boatload of fluid all
right we are headed home it has been a
rough weekend that he spoke to the
Midwife she did check me and there
basically was no change she basically
said I'm officially and having like
heard Romel labor which means that I'm
having all the same like labor symptoms
but no cervical changes happening which
can go on for a long time and can be
really emotionally and physically
exhausting she also said that he is
definitely posterior we did a little
ultrasound to check which is definitely
a reason why I'm having back labor and
why my contractions and stuff are
stalling and possibly even why I'm not
having cervical change she also checked
the fluid and there is a lot of fluid in
my belly there's a lot in there which
means that he's probably having a hard
time getting his head down to my cervix
to help make changes kind of a lot right
now
sort of working against it but I'm also
early enough that we need to just get my
body more time we need to go home rest I
definitely need some sleep find other
ways to maybe relieve the pain and
pressure from my bag hopefully turn this
baby in a natural way
good by doing like spending babies and
stuff like that I'm just excited to see
all and miss him and honestly I am very
like emotionally attached to him and I
think I'm just seeing like Olly will
kind of help heal some of my exhaustion
and she even said you know just having
breast can actually help your body
progress as well in a way I kind of know
what I'm looking for I know even more
now Wow you know went to head to the
hospital because baby is doing awesome
like he is great in there during
contractions he does exactly what he's
supposed to do and so I'm not as worried
about him as long as we keep track of
his movement I think that he's great at
to say Brian this job is much easier
going home
going there I wanted to add and mention
that it's interesting because if I had a
different Hospital and different doctors
this process would probably be going a
lot differently because I have such an
amazing hospital and amazing midwives
that tend to choose the more natural
route rather than most likely what most
doctors would have done in my situation
they would probably normally step in and
add pitocin or do something to help me
but I am denying that I don't want that
I know it's kind of funny because we
watch and listen to so many different
people who are like so that's most most
of the time what you do is you go in the
hospital when you have contractions and
they might have to further along or you
might do it naturally that's fine too
but a lot of the times you know doctors
do intervene to kind of especially for
the mom help things go because they're
usually an excruciating pain they're
like get this very out of me
much as I want to do that I want to be
like get this baby out of me I really do
want to try and get my body more time so
that's what I do but I can't reason and
the reason we do that is because once
you have pitocin it's a 50% chance that
you're going to have a c-section and
it's actually a lot too safer to let
your body do it naturally
have major surgery a second time
definitely not to you what it's made to
do is what we want to do yeah it's
definitely like our preferred choice
did you miss mom oh yeah
say yes yeah I went down to like give
him a hug I was like out out out out and
he was sorry like no not you
yeah I am sorry I didn't bring him up
brother you were hoping for a brother
huh

that you bring him home duh

good boy for auntie while we were gone
