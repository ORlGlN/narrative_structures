are you kidding me right now ollie good
morning you guys I am cleaning up this
kitchen and Missy is still not feeling
good she sacked out on the couch or this
is just part of her whole elaborate plan
to feel sick so that I clean up the
house is that is that what's going on
right now I think that's so funny I
don't know she actually just got done
throwing up I just have been wanting to
clean up a little and I cleaned the
stove oh look at that
and I clean the counters I did the
dishes I got the grocery order in we
sent the order last night online and
they delivered it right to us this
morning so it was really cool
now I'm gonna sweep and mop and Missy
you can be my little audience it's
really it is it's hard I clean very good
don't I well I'm behind sweaty I need
the fans on I'm a big guy cleaning your
house it's just I hate watching people
clean my house because it just feels
like my job and it just it's just like
it's like stop doing my job
I told Missy I was like why don't we get
a maid you're pregnant
it's hard for you to keep up I don't
want you to sauce like let's just get a
maid they'll come once a week and
they'll sweep and vacuum and stuff the
conversation went a little bit
differently okay guys if you want usage
if you want to suggest getting a maid to
your wife plan that conversation out
because I probably didn't say it as
smoothly as I was supposed to and now
look what I'm doing I'm stuck cleaning
the house all on my own look at all that
dog hair that's like a whole other Karma
this is the only
I would recommend using the devil's help
okay otherwise stay away from him he's a
bad guy but this thing actually works
really good
now I'm steamed up and steamed up and oh
yeah this thing is really hot very very
warm it's really nice though really
Missy this mop is your favorite thing in
the whole world really this mop right
here is your favorite thing starting to
sound like your mom just sounds like the
future well hey guys I finally have some
makeup on my face I have my hair done
I'm still not dressed but I'm getting
there good thing about my whole
pregnancy is that I have some really
really sick times and sometimes around
just like I can't get up but I seem to
be able to get dressed and get my hair
done and makeup done every single day
and I even can usually leave the house
that I'm really really thankful for all
he's still not being being such a good
boy he's so good at sleeping actually
funny story I I actually signed up
before I knew I was pregnant for a
bachelorette party over the weekend like
this weekend I would leave tonight and
be gone till Sunday but I ended up
having to opt out of it so I just really
didn't want to go to a bachelorette
party
and feel so sick and not be able to go
to bed and not be able to find anything
like that I want to eat or can't eat
without throwing up I'm working through
this I'm I am excited to be back to
myself it is really really hard for me
to be sick I do not like not being able
to do things coz on normal days like I
clean my house I take care of all of her
morning tonight basically and you know
I'm busy like I'm a mom yeah I am a
stay-at-home mom and stay home moms are
busy it is really hard for me to not be
that person and I'm really trying not to
like get down about it I mean I am lucky
I have a husband who is here with me as
well who can help out a lot and so I'm
really thankful for that but it is hard
it is really definitely hard to not like
be able to take care of like simple
things around the house this is
really the fourth time I've been
pregnant which I know can be sometimes
hard to to say because it kind of has a
sad part to it this is my fourth time
going through the first trimester and it
is just as hard as the first time and I
definitely know how my body is and it's
funny but when we first started dating
blogging we had the conversation to
daily vlog I'm going on a three minute
clip we had the conversation the daily
vlog in December and we wanted to start
in G on January 1st but I told Bryan no
because I really didn't want to vlog
like the first thing that we're vlogging
would be like my first trimester with
Oliver and I just really didn't want
people to see me and how like I am in my
first time at your trimester which is
like pukey and sick and exhausted and
just I look terrible and I act terrible
and it's hard and so this is the first
time I've actually filmed my first
trimester and I hate it I hate seeing
myself how I am and I hate people seeing
me in a way where I just I'm sick I'm
sick for like weeks it's not even just
like a couple days sick it's like I'm
sick for a few weeks long story short I
hope this passes soon because I'm ready
to be back to my old self are you
