I am home
very
good morning buddy

nutritional breakfast my little Superman
Z in a rat aren't you aren't you uncle
enjoyed our dog good morning guys I'm
just hanging out in the playroom with
the boys this morning I shouldn't make I
didn't hear he says he's Superman easy
hear that Missy is actually filming a
video this morning so I'm taking care of
the boys I got them all ready for the
day of course I'm still wearing my
pajamas hashtag dad life sometimes
that's just how it is my hair is kind of
crazy right now
phew it's just huge why is it so big
what happens at night it's like the hair
fairy comes at night and she just like
teases my hair so it's ginormous
today we are preparing to go to play
this live we leave tomorrow actually
which is nice because we're going to be
there for two full days and so we have
to get prepared and pack and all that
non fun stuff but how are you guys doing
it's Friday so you're probably doing
pretty good
happy Friday y'all what are you doing
Ollie you shooting me you riding around
with mom holding it with my alright he
just jumped on there like no fear at all
yeah that's what he'd I got you I got my
boys and he wasn't like lean Daniel's
only lay down yeah like hold him on his
this may end disastrously
alright I've been working all morning on
some videos actually just filmed my
birth story which is kind of funny
because Finn's now 10 months old but I
just could not seem to do a birth story
right after he was born
but I really still feel like it's really
important for me to actually like
document it and talk about it and get it
done so I went ahead and film that today
and I think it turned out really good so
I'm excited to actually push that out
that won't be out for a couple weeks but
today a video just went up on my channel
of me and my sister we didn't ask Miss
Cass so that was really cute and then
there's a video on her channel that's
even funnier we like painted our faces
with in emojis and stuff so that one's
really cute so you guys make sure you go
check that out and the link
below so something else that we're
working on today is I am going through
instagram shops and i'm ordering some
cool clothes for the kids i am planning
to do an instagram haul video so we're
looking for like super cute clothes from
instagram and to tell you i'm looking
through all kinds of instagram shops we
want to do like a whole video and sort
of show the kids and cute clothes and
i'm really excited about it so actually
if you guys know of any cute instagram
shops that you love or if you are an
instagram shop or an etsy shop or
anything contact me on my instagram and
we will try to get in touch with you
guys because i really want to do some
cute shops and showcase a lot of
different types of clothes other
accessories or shoes or or night clothes
or blanket stuff like that it would be
really cool so i'm in my office right
now which i swear was clean it is now
completely torn up again but Missy had
to record something because she's doing
a really special video on her channel
and we were looking at for old pictures
and we couldn't find anything I was like
starting to freak out I'm like where are
all these old photos I couldn't find the
photos of when Missy was pregnant with
Ollie I couldn't find the photos of
Ollie when he was like 5 days old I was
freaking out you guys and having like a
little mini panic attack I went through
every file on my computer didn't have
them went through my laptop the iMac
Missy's MacBook and then I remembered we
have this Drobo so we got this Drobo out
of storage which by the way this last
drive failed but it's I think
everything's ok because that's kind of
how the Drobo works if one of the drives
fail you can just replace it you don't
lose anything so I plugged it into the
computer and the first thing I found was
two folders one had all the maternity
photos and one had all the newborn
photos at times like yes at least we
have those and there is a lot of
different photo libraries like iPhoto
library aperture library photo library
so I'm trying to copy everything over to
see if we can find some really cool
photos because there had to be photos
before all he was born of us and I know
we weren't the best at like keeping them
so I'm currently sipping tea out of my
YouTube mug hooks with a Drobo up to the
computer and I am working on trying to
get all that off of the hard drive
but it's going so slow I found some old
movies of when karma was just a little
puppy I found old movies of when Missy
and I took our trip to New York City
which I wrote a song about on the new
album I found some old photos I found
videos where I actually remember hacking
my very first iPhone to take videos
because that wasn't a thing you couldn't
take video on the first iPhone not for a
while so I actually had like a jailbreak
hack to take video so I found like
little clips that I took with that too
really interesting stuff you guys so I'm
kind of like going through a wormhole of
memories right now and hoping that we
can access them all put them all on the
computer have everything back up to the
cloud like we do all our photos and
stuff like that it'd be nice to have all
right we've been working it so hard all
day I've actually got a ten-ton but
tomorrow me and Brian leave for playlist
live in DC which were very excited about
but Ollie is not coming with us you
gonna stay with me me and Papa yeah this
was actually a hard trip for us like
we've really debated not going because
we didn't want to like leave Ollie but
taking Ollie to these trips is very hard
like he just see it's very comfortable
it is we're very busy when we're at
playlist live or any kind of convention
like this and it's really just difficult
like he just he gets he just wants to go
and play and I don't like to have to
make him sit or do things when he could
just be at home playing where he's more
comfortable so
he's gonna stay back with my Mimi and
Papa which he'll be super happy with and
we're only going to be gone like two
days yeah exactly we're literally going
two days we are taking thin and hope
people get so crazy when I take thin but
Finn is still very young and HASC and he
breastfeeds
so he stays with me he has to stay with
me until he's at least a year it would
actually be probably a little bit easier
for us to leave Finn but he has to stay
with me so he has to come we're gonna
miss Olly a lot we really are kind of
dreading that part but that's why we're
going to take into a movie and hang out
with them and do some fun stuff with
them before we have to leave it's just
for a couple days so we're gonna eat
popcorn and eat candy and we're gonna
see a movie yeah I'm so excited to hang
out with you yeah I miss you all the
time yeah hey Olli we're gonna go see
the movie Kubo and the two strings you
want to kiss me okay kiss me
oh whoa they have a trolls display on so
we need Ollie to be a troll oh yeah oh
yeah he's carrying cups for live and pay
who are coming to join us we've got so
many goodies we got candy and popcorn
and we're ready to say yeah movie best
part about seeing movies of popcorn hey
buddy I got to say I was a little
disappointed about the options for kid
movies right now it's not a whole lot
out right now
so hopefully he likes Kubo it's not
exactly a cartoon but do we know where
we're going we're lost
all right we just got out of the movie
and the movie is actually really good
super cute but but it was really scary
and so we ended up leaving early it was
really cute actually
okay now we're going to ice cream we're
gonna take the kids ice cream we
actually met up with the Johnson fam and
they actually had a kid with them that's
not theirs and that girl was scared and
so we ended up leaving early but I think
all I could have handled it but it was a
little bit scary so anyway Rennell ice
cream that's a dog bowl means I get Kate
drink out of it
I'm just getting here yeah you don't do
that okay
okay go really fast ready go go go go go
go go go go go go okay come here
all right Ali you get to fill it up with
your own ice cream kay
oh my god here is Ali's creation at
munchies right now he's so excited to go
eat he's gonna pay for it though I think
he doesn't understand he's like why
can't I just eat it city I need your
money
oh you need my money okay always after
my money
we just hold on to go pay for a water
bottle
all right Ollie should we use this one
for the bath tonight
what color is it PG pretty green yes it
is all you're so excited you really will
see about tonight you normally take
showers but I was like all right you can
take it back and I'm hoping this is a
bubble bar from lush and not a bath bomb
cause it kind of looks somewhere so
we're gonna make him a bubble bath all
right water running time to see what
this does
whoa it's so cool it's like turning the
water green and creating bubbles
I know he how's that water feel and what
color is it it is green huh let me see
the bubbles are there any bubbles ooh
there's bubbles hmm all right is that
time of the night Finn is going to bed I
actually haven't even packed at all and
we have to leave early in the morning so
probably have to sneak in here and pack
all his clothes while he's sleeping
because it is his bedtime
it is his bedtime so I'm actually pretty
worried about the flight with him he's
at that age where he's not easily like
distracted he doesn't really enjoy a lot
of things other than like food and maybe
playing with a couple toys and on an
airplane it's really hard to do like
playing and stuff so it's gonna be a
little bit of a rough flight I think but
hopefully we will get through it and
hopefully he'll be a good boy
we'll have Geoffrey Natalya with us so
hopefully we can all just kind of trade
off and switch arms and keep each other
company and busy and stuff so anyways we
are getting ready for bed
Finn is gonna go to bed say nein nein
you're gonna play with your wipes okay
say night-night
all right I hope you guys enjoyed
