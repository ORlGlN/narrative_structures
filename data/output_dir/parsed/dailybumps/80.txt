-  Ooh, cool.
- When I was a little
kid I used to read this.
- Notice how he lowered his voice?
(deep voice) "When I
was a little kid I used
"to read the potty book." (laughs)

- Good morning.
-  Good morning.
- We are off to do something
very exciting today.
If you guys don't know,
on Christmas morning
Bryan, as one of my presents,
got me a horse bridle,
and that was kinda his way of saying
let's start that adventure.
We've been talking about
it for a long time.
- We've been talking about getting horses
for, before we were talking
about gettin' kids, obviously.
- I know, I've always wanted a horse,
and honestly, my parents,
or my mom always had a horse
when she was growing up.
My dad always had horses
when he was growing up,
and I even had horses
when I was growing up.
- She tells me these amazing stories
of riding bareback on horses when she was
just a little girl, and
I'm like, "That's amazing!"
- And I've just been kind of waiting
for that time when I finally can.
I know for one thing,
horses are expensive,
and they have a lot of costs that goes
along with them, and
growing up, we always didn't
have a ton of money and
I know that was always
a lot of stress on my mom and dad.
Well, owning horses is
like, they have vet bills,
and it's fees and it's this and that,
and so I just always
was like, "I don't know.
"Maybe one day I will."
Plus time, I mean, you need a lot of time
for horses, which I kind
of always am lacking on.
- But we're getting more
of, especially with the boys
sleeping together,
they're starting to become
more independent.
- Yeah, they're starting to get to a point
where I could totally see
myself going out there
and riding for a couple
hours or even taking them.
They're at the age now
where they can learn
and kind of grow up
with the horses as well
and kind of have responsibility
with the horses, too,
so I feel like we're ready.
I feel excited to take the adventure.
Obviously, there's a part
of me that's always nervous,
which I think it'd be
crazy to not be nervous
about taking on such a huge decision
or responsibility that's
like, it's intense,
but I'm really excited about the decision
that we're doing right
now, because we found
a boarding place that's really close.
So what I want to do is
I want to get a horse
and really kind of grow a relationship
with this boarding place
so they can teach me,
because obviously I'm out of practice.
I really want to know a lot of stuff
before I have a horse on my property,
and so I want them to really teach me,
retrain me how to ride,
how to care for it,
and everything, and then once I'm ready
I do want to bring the
horse onto our property.
So I don't know how long that'll be.
I don't know if that be a few years
or if it'll be closer than that,
but I'm really, really excited about this
because I feel like this
is the best decision for us
and a way to kind of
like really get me ready
to own a horse on our property.
So right now we're gonna go
look at the boarding place
and maybe she'll have
horses that we can look at.
And I've just been doing a lot of research
about horses and what
kind of horse we want
and I've got friends that know everything
about horses too, and
I'm like, "You have to be
"with me if I get a horse!"
And so I'm just so excited.
This is so crazy.
I've always dreamt of this day.
It's gonna be a long process, and I don't
want to make any rash decisions,
and I don't wanna do anything too quickly,
so I'm excited to kind of take our time.
- We're getting closer.
- I see horses!
Horses everywhere.
Yay!
(soft electronic music)
All right, I am home with
my boys and my puppy dogs.
They're like soaking wet 'cause they were
playing in the (laughs) sprinkler.
I'm gonna go check on my chickens,
but I absolutely loved this boarding place
that we just went to.
Really cute and clean.
Some really nice trail rides.
And I just really liked the lady there.
I feel like she has a lot
that she can teach me.
Sometimes I feel like it can be difficult
when you, when there's
someone who knows everything
and you're kinda like, "I just wanna know,
"like teach me," and they can sometimes
be like, oh, you're never gonna learn,
you're never gonna be
able to figure it out,
'cause this is something
you gotta, like, just know.
It's gotta come natural.
And so I really felt like I
didn't get that vibe from her.
She was just like, "Yeah,
if you need help picking
"out a horse, I'll come with you."
She's totally like, I'll
teach you everything
and you know, hopefully one day you could
move your horse to your own property.
So I feel like she was
a great, great lady.
She could be someone I really get to know
and a great property.
Lots of pasture area, arena,
an indoor boarding area,
outdoor boarding area,
it's really really cool.
So I'm excited.
Now I'm just on the
lookout for a good horse.
Which I don't wanna go too fast at.
I wanna find a good
horse that is a good fit
for me and my family.
Because I do have kids
that I know are gonna
wanna ride too. (laughs)
I'm excited to kind of get on that journey
and look for the right one,
but for now I'm gonna check on my hors --
On my horses.
On my chickens.
How ya guys doin'?
Which one of you keeps cock-a-doodle doing
in the mornin', huh?
(laughs) Which one keeps doin' it?
One is cock-a-doodle
doing and they all look
like hens to me, I guess
except for Ursula back there.
I guess she could be a rooster, but to me
she looks like a hen.
You must be a rooster, huh?
And he was, or she was, picked on a lot
when it was a baby.
So maybe now that I got rid
of those other roosters,
it's like, "I'm a freak chicken!
"I'm a rooster!
"I'm a king of the pen!"
I don't know, so.
All right, I gotta grab all my eggs.
I got them scattered;
I think one of them's
playing with the eggs.
All right, I just saw Ursula try and pin
down my chickens, so you're
officially a rooster, huh?
Yeah, totally just tried to pin 'em down.
Thank you.
Look at this!
I get to use my, my little
apron that Bryan got me.
Yay!
Check this out.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Look at that!
This is so cute.
Look at that.
I've got seven eggs in here.
I was like, "There's no
way I could hold these."
I'm like, "I almost forgot my apron!"
So exciting, look, mommy
can hold all the eggs
without breaking them!
- I wanna see.
-  See, look how
many eggs we got in there.
There's even one up here.
Isn't that handy?
Pretty cool, huh?
- Let's go check out the snow.
- Yeah, we're gonna go check
out the snow right now.
You guys don't know, we
caught the abominable
snowman the other day and he brought snow
to our yard here in
Southern California, huh?
- Yeah.
- And we went sledding and we
played and played and played
and it was actually kind
of a warm day today,
so I was kinda hoping that
there'd still be a little
bit of snow left.
(Finley yelling)
What is that?
And I see a snowman, huh?
- Look!
- Let's go check out that snowman.
Who built this snowman?
What a second, did you
make that snowman, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
So you made this?
-  No.
-  Wait.
What is going on here?
- Hi!
-  Wait a second.
Is that daddy?
- Yeah!
-  There's a snowman down here.
- I'm a snowman and I've come to play.
-  (laughs) Is that so cool?
- Will you guys look at this block of ice?
-  Yeah, it's
basically just ice now.
Woo!
Very slippery.
- So you know how in Frosty the Snowman,
they build a snowman and
it comes to life, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm basically a
snowman brought to life.
I thought we could play with some
RC cars!
-  Do you wanna play with RC cars?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, that sounds so fun.
Does that sound fun, Finn?
He's even got his RC dino.
He's like, "Let's go."
(rock music)
- All right, we are takin'
our Traxxas X-Maxx out
on our huge chunk of ice.
A couple days ago this
was a huge sledding hill,
and now it is basically
frozen just like my heart.
(Missy laughs)
In this snowman costume.
-  Yes, are you cold in there?
- I thought it might actually be cool
to ride around on the
snow, see how it does.
You guys wanna see how it does?
- Yeah!
-  Woo!
-  We're gonna tear it up.
(rock music)
It is slick, it is flying on that ice.
-  That's cool.
And check out this, the snow has made
all this clean, it's like all this color
and then you've got like the pink rock,
and you can see all the white rock,
so interesting.
Woo!
Go, Finn, go! (laughs)
All right, we're gonna how
high this thing can jump.
- Ready?
-  Let's do it.
Woo!
Perfect!
Yep, perfect.
(rock music)
-  We're tryin'
to pull Finn in the sled.
- Not working, Finn, you're gonna have
to lose some weight.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Oh!
Yeah.
- I half-hearted it.
-  Well, you
probably shouldn't do that.
- Nah, nah.
-  All right, Missy's
testin' out the sled.
(Missy screams)
(Bryan laughs)
All right, Ollie's hoppin' in the sled.
Hang onto the reins!
- One, two, three!
-  Woo!
Nice.
(Bryan laughs)
(soft instrumental music)
All right, I think this
snowman is melting, guys.
It's gettin' really hot out here.
I don't think this snow has,
has much longer to go, honestly.
I think it's gonna be done in probably
like a week. (laughs)
This is also very interesting to wear.
What?
You wanna sit on the truck?
All righty, it is now
time for a birthday party!
You so excited, boys?
(Missy laughs)
Birthday party?
Anyone?
- I guess we should go home.
- We're at a birthday party,
and both the boys fell
asleep on the way here
and it's kinda cute.
They kinda needed a nap.
- Especially Finn, he was like, "Aaaah!"
- Oh yeah, he's been two days without one.
-  They're gonna have a fun time.
-  They are gonna have a fun time.
-  But they needed a little nap.
- We'll go play in the
bouncy house without 'em.
No, we'll take 'em, I guess.
Look how cute they are in
their matching Mickey shirts.
You boys.
- We're home now.
And are you a sleepy bug?
- No.
- Yeah, you are.
Fell asleep for just a
minute in the car, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we are home and I
gotta go get my chickens
in; they've been out all day.
And the dogs have been in the side yard.
Since Luna is still a little bit crazy
and I can't totally trust
her with the chickens
if I'm not around, so
when the chickens got out,
and I did not have the
time to put them back in
before I left, it's dark out.
Are you gonna help me get the chickens in?
-  Yeah.
- Oh wait, are the chickens already in?
Let me see.
Oh, looks like the chickens
actually made it all
into their house and
then a wind must've come
and just blown this shut.
Because it was just kinda stuck like that.
So good, I'm glad y'all are good.
(laughs)
Everyone's safe and sound,
and this little one's
turnin' into a rooster over here,
so he'll be cock-a-doodle
doing bright and early,
won't ya?
6:30. (laughs)
All right, let's close this up
so nothing gets to them,
and we gotta go get
our doggies next, 'kay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
All right, boys, let's
go get our puppy dogs.
I think they're over there.
We gotta go get our puppy dogs.
Here.
We gotta get our doggies.
They're over here jumpin'.
They're like, "Come get us!
"Come get us!" (laughs)
Oh my goodness, Luna, you are so crazy.
(laughs)
Gotcha!
Woo!
(dog barks)
Finn, good thinkin'.
All right, let's go, let's go.
(dog barks)
Get in the house, let's get in the house!
Hey, puppy dogs, missed you.
They've only been in
there for a few hours.
They act like they've
been in there all day.
(screams)
(soft instrumental music)
- Where are you goin', Finn?
- Hidin'.
- Oh, you're hidin'?
They're hiding in their tent. (laughs)
Where are they?
(Finley screams)
There they are!
- Got some new books to read!
-  Ooh!
Some new books?
That's cool.
- The Potty Book, we
read this one with Ollie.
Bigfoot.
-  Ooh, cool.
- When I was a little
kid I used to read this.
- Notice how he lowered his voice?
(deep voice) "When I
was a little kid I used
"to read the potty book." (laughs)
So funny.
I don't know if I've ever really
vlogged while coming up here,
but I wanted to show
you guys what happens.
My shoulders are too large
to fit through the door.
I have to angle myself.
(groans)
Hey, guys.
-  Hi.
-  Is it story time?
-  Yeah.
-  We get to read
books and go to bed?
Did you guys have fun
at the birthday party?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah, that was so cool seeing
that doggie do tricks, huh?
- Yeah.
- These boys have been
doing so good in their bed
it is now officially
bedtime, so we're gonna read
some stories, so we're gonna say goodbye.
Thanks for watching.
-  Bye!
-  Give this video a thumbs-up.
Thumbs-ups!
And we will see you mañana.
Boys, what do you say?
-  Bye!
(rock music)
