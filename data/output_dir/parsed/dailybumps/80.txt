(sigh)
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- These boys are up early
all the time, it seems.
Just wanna find Fred, huh?
- Yeah.
- Where do you think Fred is this morning?
- Um, I don't know.
- Do you know, Finn?
- No.
- No.
- Shh.
- Okay, we gotta be quiet, okay?
Alright, let's go find Fred.
Who's gonna be the first to find him?
This is like the funnest time ever
because the boys have no idea where he is.
And so they have to like
walk around the whole
house and look for him.
Fred, where are you buddy?
Do you see him, Finn?
- No.
-  Did you guys check over here?
- Is he outside?
-  I don't think he'd be outside.
It's too cold.
Are you losing hope already?
- No.
(giggling)
Fred is here in the playroom?
-  Is he?
I don't see him.
- (gasp) Fred!
-  Oh we found him!
What's he doing?
- He's eating marshmallows
and gummy worms.
-  Yeah, gummy bears?
Oh, Fred, what have you
been up to last night?
You know what it looks
like he's doing, Ollie?
- What?
- I think he was sledding
on the marshmallows.
Look, he built his sled out of paper.
And then was sledding on the marshmallows.
Oh look at at all this candy,
he must have put all this
out here for you guys.
You guys wanna piece of candy?
You're already eatin' gummy bears.
Finn, you want some gummy bears?
- Yeah.
-  There you go, buddy.
- Good morning Fred.
-  Good morning Fred.
Alright, he's ready.
He's watching you boys all day today
to make sure you're good, okay?
(giggling) Marshmallows for
breakfast, you silly boy.
(playful Christmas music)
- Good morning, guys,
it is December first.
December first means there's
24 days til Christmas or 25?
I feel like it's always so confusing.
We have some advent calendars.
Some are for some friends of ours.
But we do have a couple
that we are excited about.
But I do get really
confused, because I think
you're supposed to start
these on December first.
And this one has 24 surprises inside.
But this one has 25 surprises inside.
So does that mean I was supposed to start
that one like yesterday?
It's very confusing.
-  Mama.
- And then this is our advent calendar
where we have like little good deeds
that we're gonna do throughout the month.
We'll pull out a little
note, and that one's 25.
So I'm like, was I supposed to start
that one also yesterday?
I don't know, it's so confusing.
They're very excited
about the Star Wars one.
24, so I think for sure
we start this one today,
and then we open the last
one on Christmas Eve.
Right, is that right?
Let me know in the
comments if that's right.
(Finn crying)
We're very excited that
it's December first.
It's Christmas, it's Christmas.
I feel like we've been pretending that
it's Christmas for all these last few
days, but it is officially Christmas time.
But yeah, I gotta get cleanin'.
The house is kind of a disaster right now.
I'm in the middle of
doing dishes, the boys'
playroom is a mess, and
we have a fun day planned.
We actually have people coming over and
we're gonna be working
on a really cool project.
And so I feel like this
house needs to get cleaned.
Now I'll admit, Finley,
Ollie can be a little
messy when he plays in the playroom.
That's for sure, I mean, it's a playroom,
it gets messy.
But I don't think this was him.
(giggling) Finn, did you
make this mess down there?
- Nuh-uh.
- Yes, you did.
- No.
- Yes you did.
Let me ask you another question.
You both really do like to color and
draw on stuff, but I don't think Ollie
made this mess.
Did you make that mess?
- No.
- Yes you did!
You're telling me that Ollie
drew all over the table?
No, was it you?
Did you do that?
- No.
- He's like, hm what's the right answer.
You guys are cute.
I love you even though you're destructive.
- Apparently today is
ride your bike inside day
'cause both the boys are loving it.
You are so fast, Finn, it's crazy.
- Yeah!
(laughing)
-  Whoa, you're
getting better too Ollie.
- Hi G-BO!
-  (giggle) Hey
G-BO, tell me a joke.
-  Why did the orange cry?
-  I don't know.
-  Someone hurt his feelings.
-  Aw (giggle).
The orange cried 'cause
someone hurt his feelings.
(playful music)
Hey Ollie, what are you doing?
- Play.
-  Are you singing Christmas music?
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪
♪ Jingle all the way ♪
(Christmas music)
Whoa, that was so good, dude!
You're just like Daddy aren't you?
Recording music?
-  One, two, three, go.
-  Jingle bells
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪
- Awesome.
- Wooo.
-  One more, we
got plenty to work with.
- My producer Daniel
is here because we are
working on a top secret Daily
Bump's Christmas project
that I actually announced on
accident yesterday on Twitter.
We're doing a Christmas EP!
And I'm so excited because
it's a family thing.
We're gonna have Finn involved,
we're gonna see if he
can yell into the mic.
(Finn yelling) (laughing)
Is he playing with the microphone?
- I'm getting all sorts of noises.
(laughing)
-  What are you
doing in here Ollie?
(baby talk)
- I can hear you mama!
- You can hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear your voice.
- The microphone is on,
so he can hear his voice
in the headphones,
- I can hear my voice, mama.
- and it's a really disorienting
sound if you've never
experienced it and you've
been in a studio doing it.
So it's funny when you
do it for the first time.
- Sing it nice and loud in--
- I can hear it again.
- That's so cool.
(giggling)
Alright, we have been having
so much fun working on the
Christmas album, huh?
- Uh huh.
- (Missy) And now we are
taking a little break
and we are going to open up
one of our advent calendars.
Which one is this one?
- This is the Lego Star Wars.
-  (gasp) Can
you say Lego Star Wars?
(babbling)
Star Wars (giggle).
They already accidentally
opened this one, but
there's 24 days left til
Christmas so that means we get
to open up the 24 which is
this one right here, okay?
-  Okay.
-  (gasp) There ya go.
(pop)
(gasp) You did it.
What's in there?
(gasp) Who is that?
- BB-8.
-  Yeah, oh my gosh, I
think it's a Christmas BB-8.
How cool.
So this is a Lego advent
calendar which I think I am
really excited about
because it's not candy which
is always a hard thing when
they are opening it up,
especially sometimes because
they open it at night
and then they get candy at
night and that's just can be
kind of frustrating.
So anyways.
- I can't open it.
- These are little legos.
Yeah, I'm going to put it together for you
in just a minute.
Alright, so every day we get
to open one and we get to put
together the whole collection.
I think you got that one.
(gasp)
- Yes!
-  (gasp) That's so exciting.
And Finn has a different calendar.
I'm going to get you yours, okay?
And then this one is Finn's.
Is this yours?
- Yeah.
-  These are little
Tsum Tsum calendars.
(gasp) Look at all the cool characters.
Mickey Mouse and Minnie
Mouse, and who's that?
- Um, Stitch.
-  Stitch, you're right.
Oh, and I think that's Olaf.
So, let's see what's in here, okay?
We gotta find the 24.
Ready?
-  Wow.
-  What's in there?
(gasp) Oh, it's Dumbo.
It's so cool.
So this is Dumbo and then
he's got a little reindeer.
(babbling)
(giggling) Do you love it, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  That's so cool.
He is so happy.
Is that so fun?
- Yeah.
-  Okay every day
you get to open up one.
Nope, just one okay?
- 'Kay.
-  Tomorrow you get another one.
Ugh, I love little tiny Legos, yes I do.
(playful music)
There he is.
How cute.
What a fun little advent
calendar, you guys get little
toys every day, huh?
(playful music)
- Today went so good, you guys.
Oliver was so good on the microphone.
He did so good with Daniel, my producer.
It was insane.
Like I was feeding him
lines of music to sing and
like singing it to him and
he was singing it back.
He was following and mimicking the melody.
It was so cool and it was
just so amazing to see
as you know a dad and as
you know someone who loves
making music and singing and songwriting.
It's so cool to see your
kids really like that kind of
stuff.
So, I'm like totally like that's so neat.
We got everything finished
that we needed to.
So, now we just have a couple of days.
If you guys have not guessed
or went on my Twitter and
looked, we are releasing a
Christmas EP as a family.
And I have no idea when it's coming out.
Hopefully very soon.
So, just keep your eyes
peeled, but it's going
to be the cutest and coolest
and funnest thing ever.
So, yay for that.
Now, as you can tell with my
beanie and my warm clothes,
we are headed out because
the city is actually having a
really cool Santa's electrical parade.
So, we are headed out to go do that.
Karma, you and Luna be good, okay?
- Waiting for the parade.
- Oh is it startin'?
(jazz music)
We are bundled up and sitting
on the side of the road
waitin' for the parade to come down.
Ollie are you excited for the parade?
You excited to see santa?
(jazz music)
- Oh my gosh, it's the Grinch.
- Ollie, it's the Grinch.
Ollie is standing up for that one.
Do you see him?
We gotta be careful of the
Grinch you guys, he's got a
reputation in our house.
Hi Grinch.
-  Don't come
to our house this year.
(crowd cheering)
(jazz music)
- You guys, we have a
Chik-fil-A float in our parade.
Look at this.
Are those cows?
Look at them, dude.
(jazz music)
Ollie, here comes the Grinch again.
(jazz music)
We sat at that parade for
about an hour and 40 minutes
and Santa did not show up.
(giggling)
Where is Santa?
- A lot of businesses.
- Yeah, it was like, yeah I felt good,
I was like we're supporting
the local community.
There's the Boy Scouts, the
Girl Scouts, all these clubs,
and then it was like a ton
of businesses, and then we
look down and it's like not gonna stop.
So, we in it, and it was
getting so cold, it's like
-  So cold.
- I think it's below 50 and
with kids that's a little rough.
So, we kind of ditched the parade.
- Everyone was though, like
everyone was like why is it--
- Yeah everyone was like--
- Still going?
- And where's Santa?
(giggling) I don't see Santa.
- And when we, we were like
walking towards the beginning
of the parade and we never
saw the ending, like there
was just miles of more people coming.
- Yeah, so.
- More than ads.
- (laughing) Yeah, I
basically told the boys.
I was like you know what, I
have Santa's phone number.
He texts me, he facetimes
me, I'll facetime with him.
- Let's facetime him tonight
and we'll get a better
look at him (giggling).
- Yeah.
Alright, we have made it
to IHOP because we need
some pancakes in our life
right now (giggling).
Ollie is so excited for
pancakes (giggling).
-  Open the door.
- Finn looks at all the
Christmas decorations and
always says Halloween.
- Yeah, we had a long
talk about it in Target.
Halloween, Halloween,
I'm like no, Christmas.
- Alright guys, time to cheers.
This is our new thing when
we go out as a family.
We all cheers.
Say cheers!
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Look at this giant hot chocolate.
Oh, that is so good.
You should try it, yeah.
Gingerbread hot chocolate.
Mmm.
Holy pancakes, Ollie.
Are you so excited to eat those?
- Yeah.
- Is that still your favorite food?
Yeah?
He's going on like a year strong.
His favorite food is pancakes.
Finn's like in heaven, too.
We were so hungry.
(babbling)
Finn, that is some good singing, dude.
He is so cute.
I just hear him singing back there,
and Ollie's like you're
singing beautifully, Finn.
- Yeah, he's like that's
a cute song, Finn.
- It is a cute song, huh Ollie?
- Kids are finally in bed.
It was a late night.
Me and Bryan are exhausted.
So we're actually headed to bed soon.
So, make sure you give
this video a big thumbs up.
We do have a really special
video planned for tomorrow
so make sure you don't miss it.
And we'll see you guys later.
Bye.
Boop.
(upbeat music)
