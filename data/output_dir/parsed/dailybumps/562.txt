good morning guys
playlistlive day two is in full effect
and we are taking advantage of all the
free food they give you which is pretty
nice because we slept into like 11 and
it was glorious
what does sleeping in when you went to
bed it looks yeah I know right yeah it
spent not eating bananas he does not
want to eat
he doesn't like bananas anymore for some
reason and when he or to either weekend
he's giving it to me I don't want it
buddy good morning you look so cute yeah
I was really nice we got to sleep in
this morning but now we were back at
playlist live Missy has a panel about
being a woman on YouTube I'm actually
really nervous felling you don't know
you know all about being a woman
kids husbands putting up with me and all
my crazy ideas there's a lot to talk
about
I think she'd be great at it yeah so
we're just getting ready and I'm just
gonna hop on stage and do a thing
hey guys how's it going good job up
there buddy I saw you dancing you didn't
really get Miranda impression good luck
man there's a huge community for it and
sometimes it doesn't matter you just go
out there and you make the content that
you are passionate about and if you want
to be the best mom and there's a lot of
mom shaving out there you know you
always think you got the better way or
something so I think for me it's a
constant struggle of showing that I'm
not the best mom I'm just doing the best
that I can and even though I really just
want to constantly put out content as I
look like did today it what I've learned
it trying to show people like look how
good of a mom I am it's important to
show like well I messed up today you
know we just we do the best we can and
that's the best that you can do and so
sometimes I think as a woman and I think
maman on YouTube it can be difficult
because you have to show the true you
not try and show this like imaginary you
that
shooting me walking in Washington DC oh
oh oh this part didn't need any bricks
that's okay yeah they had to save they
had a budget cut another baa-eautiful
day here in Washington DC and we need to
get food but we are basically all done
with our commitments at playlist live
and we had such a blast got to meet so
many of you now today we are going to go
see some statues and monuments and
really cool old stuff we are walking
toward this really cool park beautiful
so green we do not have green like this
in California because we're in a drought
but this is a beautiful park I don't
know what it's called but we're walking
to go check out this statue
Samuel coppers I'm alive I am
that's the thing as we didn't really
brush up on a lot of our history so we
don't know a lot of this is what we're
going to learn today
hashtag dad live this guy's obviously
reading a Harry Potter and the cursed
child do you even lift bra
what do you think about that statue
buddy
you
Missy and I are just walking around our
hotel we haven't really shown you this
part the front side of our hotel is just
insane they have this really cool statue
right here
Clark Mills that's cool is he's worried
about the horses
it is a very white house so this is the
white house this is where our president
lives with his family I'm pretty cool
hey Vinny guess what behind this is the
White House
it's where the president lives McCool
Oh
so Whitehouse is down there this is the
Treasury Department so cool
it feels really cool just being around
all these old awesome majestic buildings
I mean this we're all our money is so
there's like negative billion dollars in
there
this building is incredible right here
and it reminds me a lot of wizards or
Weasleys Wizard wheezies from Harry
Potter does that look like it crazy
it is so simple that we were in
Washington DC right now it's so cool
dude like around so much history and you
were kidding in front of like statues
and kind of like things that have been
here and milk from too long and it has
so much history involved with them so
many cool people that I found in this
country and not amazing things and it's
not that we don't know everything about
it
super cool like it's just so cool I love
it I just love history
so the last time I was here in
Washington DC I was actually here with
my grandma and we took a trip to DC with
a group and we got to see all the sights
so it's really interesting to see it
like from my perspective now it's fun
perspective then I think I was like 13
years old and we actually were able to
go right up to the White House like
right up to that fence and now they have
it like pushed a ways back so you can't
get that close anymore we're just kind
of sad but it is what it is things
change there's just a feeling in this
place that it's like a big feeling of
importance and just seeing all the
beauty all around it's really really
neat
I honestly just think that's incredible
that we can do things like that

banner cost
