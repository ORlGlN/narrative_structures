Hey guys, so, we have
something to tell you.
I messed up.
♪ This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
-  Good morning Ollie.
Good morning.
-  Are you ready for school?
Yeah.
Yeah, good morning, we are so tired, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, we are headed to school.
I'm hoping it goes good.
All right, gotta take your picture, huh?
Look here and smile, say cheese!
Cheese.
Good job, all right you ready for school?
I'm so excited.
(calm music)
All right drop off
actually went pretty good.
Better than it has the past
like, I'd say like three weeks.
He didn't cry so that's good.
It sounded like he was actually
having like a lot of fun
when I like peeked through the window
I saw him playing, so yay, success!
And then I did show
you guys some pictures.
His teacher said that they were
trying pumpkin pie ice cream
and all the kids were trying it.
And she said that he did try
it, and he did not like it
at all but he was
willing to take a picture
and he told her that "I don't like it
"but here's my happy
face smile" and he's like
(laughing) it looked kinda funny.
I'm gonna go home, and get ready
for my day a little bit more.
I haven't actually done my hair today.
Yeah, and go hang out with my other boys.
What's up guys, I am just
hanging out in my office today
because I have a ton of work
to do, but before I do that,
I actually get to do something very fun.
Special thanks to HP for
sponsoring this video.
As you guys know I got this
new wall console cabinet
for my office but that's
not all that's new.
Check out my brand new
HP Envy photo printer.
I actually picked up this
printer a couple weeks ago,
and it is hands down the best printer
that I have ever owned.
It is one of the most high
quality printers on the market.
This thing is perfect
for crafts, documents,
and printing full color
photos from my phone
of moments that really matter.
As you guys know, Finn
just turned two years old.
Ollie is four now, and
to me that is just crazy.
These boys are growing up so fast.
We need more pictures of them,
and the HP Envy photo printer
helps us do just that.
The colors look amazing
and the photos just pop.
Plus it's awesome being able
to do it all from your phone
with the HP Smart Remote app.
And as you guys know we
live a pretty busy life.
And with HP Instant Ink we
never have to worry about
running out of ink when
we go to print a photo.
Which is really cool, too.
I have to say one of the worst
things about owning a printer
is going to print some thing
and have it be out of ink.
Right, I think everyone has been there.
With HP Instant Ink,
you never have to worry
about running out of ink again.
This is seriously so cool, you guys.
The printer lets HP know
when it's low on ink
and it orders it before
I'm about to run out so
I always have ink available
when this runs out.
It's like my own personal
ink buying assistant.
It's amazing.
Check out these photos of our boys from
our Oregon trip back in August.
With the new HP Envy photo
printer we can display these
in our home and look back and
remember all the fun we had.
(upbeat music)
I love this photo so much
of Missy carrying Finn
while we were hiking in
Oregon, it's so cool.
But honestly if you guys are
in the market for a printer
be sure to check out the
HP Envy photo printer
and a huge thanks to HP again
for sponsoring this video.
This little boy is being carried
into his doctors
appointment, he's so tired.
It's so early still, why is he asleep?
Well, he woke up at like 6 a.m.
Oh that's true, he did
wake up super early today.
Good morning guys, yes, we are headed
into Finn's doctors appointment.
Oh, good morning, Finn.
Hey dude, are you going to the doctors?
Yeah.
He's actually at the age
where he's still excited
about the doctors.
He might not be excited about
the doctor when we leave.
(upbeat music)
-  Finn you're
being such a good boy.
Yeah, he is.
-  I don't think
even think Ollie would want
to stand on that scale.
Finn's being so good.
(upbeat music)
Say grapes.
Gapes.
Say apple.
Bapoo.
-  Say banana.
Nana.
-  Poor baby.
Finn, how did your appointment go?
Say good.
Are you a little sad, he's
a little sad right now.
He got one shot, but you did so good.
Yeah you did.
Yeah he did better than
your brother. (laughing)
I actually think I really
need to do a two year update
on him because I haven't done that yet.
And I haven't done a video
on my channel in so long.
So I think I might try
and do that really soon.
Let me know in the comments
if you guys want to see
a two year update on my
channel and maybe I'll start
up my channel again, let me know.
Finn and Bryan are in the car right now.
Actually gonna go pick up Ollie.
He, I would say it's not super
early but I think he'll be
really excited to see me.
But yeah, then we have some
more shopping to get done.
We have a few fun things
happening this week, so.
Yeah we gotta get stuff done.
Hi, Ollie.
Hi.
-  How was school?
Good.
-  Were you so excited to see Mama?
Yeah.
-  And did you
learn about the number 13?
Yeah but here's where I'm
going to plant my flowers.
-  Oh this is such
a cool little garden, huh?
Yeah.
-  Hey dude how was school?
Good.
-  It was good?
Yeah.
-  You know Finn
went to the doctors while
you were at school.
Really?
-  And he had to get a shot, yeah.
Did he cry at anything?
-  He cried a little
bit you'll have to give him
a big hug, okay?
Whoa, Ollie there's aliens
in the back of your car!
Better speed away, go go go go go!
(laughing)
The boys are getting
some time in the arcade.
Sounds like Ghostbusters, huh?
Yeah!
Oh no there's aliens!
Boogie Patrol, Alien Boogie
Patrol is what they call it.
I guess it's because they look
like, are they alien boogers?
Yeah.
-  Ohh, that's so funny, huh?
They're alien boogers.
-  Yeah.
(calm music)
We're at Christmas Tree Lane.
-  That's right we are
here at Christmas Tree Lane.
Look at all these amazing Christmas trees.
Look, candy.
Oh that's so cool, that one's decorated
in all candy, huh?
So we are at the Christmas
Tree Lane and what that is
is basically people decorate
a bunch of different trees.
We have twenty trees all decorated.
You donate, and you get
tickets and then you.
Yeah, we're donating
to a really cool cause.
Because they help build homes
for people who don't have
anywhere to live.
-  Got a bunch of tickets.
We have all of our tickets,
and we're gonna stick them
in all the trees that we like,
and we might win one I guess.
-  Yeah, we might
actually win one of these trees.
(cheerful music)
Look at that one it's
Beauty and the Beast.
And it's got Beast hanging on it even.
That one's so cute, yeah, Cogsworth.
Should we put some in here?
-  Yeah we gotta
donate to this one.
So, this one right here?
Yep.
-  I can feel it, this
is gonna be our lucky one.
-  This one is
going in your room, Ollie.
-  If we win it,
it's going in Ollie's room?
There's a Star Wars one.
-  There is?
Look it!
-  Whoa!
I would go with that one.
-  That one is really cool, huh?
-  Should we put a few in here?
-  Definitely.
Here you go.
(cheerful music)
-  Look at this Star
Wars tree, that is so cool.
And very like simple, and
impressive, I like it.
Look at the mask is all lit up too.
I like the space ship.
(yelling)
(cheerful music)
All right Ollie, we put
all of our tickets in, huh?
Yeah, I hope we won.
I hope we win one too, that
would be so cool huh Finn?
-  You wanna win one, Finn?
Yeah.
All right, I am living it
up with the boys in style.
Missy and I hunted for this
double cart, oh, it's turning.
-  Oh, shoot.
Okay, Missy has completely
lost control of the cart now.
We're just gonna go like this now.
I was like "oh is this
a seat for me, too?"
No, Daddy can't sit there.
No.
-  He's silly huh?
Yeah.
Last stop of the day and I am exhausted.
I'm seriously about to fall
asleep, but we need things.
Me too, and Ollie, he's like
"Mama, I'm just so tired."
-  Join the club bro.
(upbeat music)
How's the chocolate milk boys?
Good.
You drink it.
-  You want me to try?
-  It looks really good.
I will happily try your chocolate milk.
No.
Mmm it's so yummy, I got
a peppermint hot chocolate, cheers!
-  Cheers.
Cheers.
-  Cheers Finn.
Cheers, too slow.
Hey guys, so we have something
to tell you, I messed up.
We messed up.
Yeah.
We just got back from a
very busy crazy fun day.
We had a really a really
cool day, and we had to
go shopping at Target cause
we had to get a ton of things
for a little dinner party
we're throwing tomorrow night.
I got home, asked where
the camera was, and.
And I was like "Where is the camera?"
Yeah, so if you guys don't
know, I'm vlogging on an old
camera right now that I had in my office.
All the footage that
we shot today is gone.
It's gone and I'm, I don't,
I don't have hopes that
we're gonna get it back.
Um, that's kind of just who I am.
I know the world we live in today.
Well, and I'm always.
I thought I would just let
Missy explain what happened.
I'm gonna let you explain.
Okay, well, we went shopping,
and like I, I think I had
even talked about, we
used that double cart like
stroller thing.
The camera was just like
sitting right there, and when
we left, the kids were
being kind of crazy.
So I was like "Hey Bryan,
I'm just gonna take the kids
"and go put them in the car".
-  While I was checking out.
While he was checking out, yeah.
So I was like bagging groceries
and checking out, putting
them in the cart.
Yeah, so I put the kids
in the car and I was just
waiting in the car while
Bryan got to the car.
He finally got to the
car, unloaded the cart,
and then put the cart away
and then um, got in the car
and we drove home, so.
-  The camera is still in the cart.
The camera's gotta be
still in the cart unless.
Or someone saw it and grabbed
it and and picked it up.
Someone took it, but the
problem is that I've called.
-  Yeah so we called
Target and what did they say?
Well I've waited like on the phone forever
like tossing us back and forth
and they're like "it
hasn't been turned in yet."
I was like "I know it's in a
cart, could you just go look?"
And they went and looked, and basically
they were like "it's not there."
And so now I'm starting to feel
like maybe someone did take it.
-  Yeah.
Like if they checked and it's
not there I don't know what
else to do but luckily my
dad is in the area right now
so he's gonna go look for us.
So there's still a little
tiny bit of hope that maybe.
-  Yeah.
They're gonna find it but
I don't know for sure.
-  'Cause you lost it!
I didn't lose.
(Bryan laughing)
I took the kids, you
unloaded the cart, I mean.
Why didn't you tell me you that
you had the camera hidden the cart?
I didn't know it was there.
It wasn't hidden in the
cart, it was right where your
hands go, it was right there.
Come on, it was totally your fault babe.
Just own up to this one.
Is that, okay I.
Do you remember the last time we left a.
It is always my fault.
Do you remember the last
time we left a camera in the
cart, who's fault was that?
Um, that was mine, but this
one, you should have looked.
It was in there and you're
just always in charge of
the camera you just gotta make sure.
Okay but I will say this, we
have vlogged for five years.
Five years, now.
Almost five years now and we've
never lost a camera like officially.
Yeah.
I don't know if this is going
to be the official time but
like I can't believe how good we have.
It hasn't happened yet.
There was the worst time, was
when I left it at the beach.
And you had to head back.
Yeah, and I had to drive like an hour
and a half to go get it.
You had to drive an hour and
a half to go back and get it.
And that was my fault too.
Okay, after hearing that
who's fault do you guys think
it is, let us know in
the comments down below.
And we'll have a fun little
fight about that later.
I will say I should have told
you where it was in the cart.
He didn't know where it was.
Yes, and I should have told you to.
Make sure I had the camera?
Make sure you had the camera.
(upbeat music)
Hey, is that Missy's camera?
Missy, is this your camera,
I don't wanna take somebody
else's camera that they left
here in a shopping cart.
I'm pretty sure it's yours.
Okay, I'm just gonna
assume it's yours, okay?
Sorry little buddy, I know you wanna
live here at Target but you can't.
-  Dad!
-  Hey nice camera you got there.
Yeah, just got it.
-  Did you steal our camera?
They had a sale at Target,
a big parking lot sale.
Wow, I got my own camera.
-  It was there?
Yeah.
-  It was in the cart?
It was just sitting there.
Right where we, right where you left it!
-  Oh my gosh, you left it there!
I'd have done the same thing.
We all know you would have
done the same thing because
you and this young lady
are the same person.
We put 100 percent into
each thing we're doing.
-  Yes!
Like we're putting the
kids in the car, I'd have.
-  That's what I'm doing.
Oh my gosh, I'm honestly
surprised no one took it.
There is a two minute clip
of my big toe in there, so.
I don't know if you wanna
put that on the vlog.
-  Why is your big toe?
A close up shot of my big toe.
I'll make it the title and thumbnail.
And since I found the camera
I would like that to be on
the vlog, it's a good looking big toe.
I'm actually a little upset
that Target said they looked for it.
It was right there when you walked by.
-  It was right there?
'Cause the other carts can't push
into it so it kinda sits there by itself.
I don't get why they
said like they looked.
We found it, okay we still
are on a good streak.
Still haven't lost any cameras officially.
I can't believe we haven't.
That could have been the whole
vlog this last two minutes.
-  I know.
Ollie, guess what?
What?
Papa found the camera!
Wow.
-  Did you know it was lost?
Yeah.
Did you know that Mommy and
Daddy were stressed out of
their minds for like an hour and a half?
Say thank you Papa.
Thank you Papa.
-  Thanks Dad.
Thumbs up for getting
our camera back you guys.
I'm so relieved that we did not lose
this footage because it is so cute.
All right, let's just show
you what we were up to today.
-  Good morning Ollie.
Morning.
-  Are you ready for school?
Yeah.
(upbeat music)
And then we're back at the start.
How cool is that you guys?
Um, today was a crazy day.
It was a fun day but honestly all
our days are crazy and
fun I absolutely love it.
If you guys do be sure to
subscribe to our channel
because we put out
videos every single day.
Give this video a big thumbs up
and we'll see you guys minyana, bye. Boop.
