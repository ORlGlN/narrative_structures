Lou Kona iced tropical show sexually
sounds so good can we share one babe
alright so this is how they do it you
guys they gave us two cups of ice and we
get to choose our own flavor how cool is
this Carrie ninja cherry I know they
probably do this because you use less
flavor you got to get in there now
Nina what flavor are you gonna do Ollie
you're gonna do cherry - why not a pink
lemonade here you can have this cherry
and we'll do a pink lemonade okay yes
the boys are wearing white pants as am I

delicious oh my god
that's what the doctor ordered right

you boys are still cute sharing a little
ice yummy check out this pool of Orbeez
they've got guys we know these things
huh I don't know
not fun all right we have headed home
but before we head home Bryan had to
stop at Michael's to grab um some pots
for some of the new succulents so we got
is we're going to go home and try and
start organizing our new plants and put
them out so we're pretty excited about
that but now we're just waiting in the
car it's hot out and my guest out of the
station just leaks but he's not actually
right there Ollie are you playing yeah
they were playing yesterday so I think
Finn is not in the mood today because he
probably is pretty tired so we're going
to tend them hopefully Finn
yeah and over today and we're going to
say
the work cited to me a fun Sunday
afternoon all right Ethan what you doing
looking for the fishies so we just got
back from church it's been a couple days
but I don't know if the kids noticed
then just push this chair over to the
fish tank and he's like hey where'd my
Cisco where's the fish go Finn he did
not last too long here you know those
two new glow fish we got you guys they
died like the next day it was really
kind of ridiculous honestly we did a
little bit of more research about the
Blowfish yeah I don't think they're
partying essentially did sort of a sense
I guess friends sisters happy event and
they just they are genetically modified
to glow so I'm assuming that had a lot
to do with it also they were very
stressed when they were getting them I
was like oh these fish are not going to
love I mean it's awkward like betta fish
is really Hardy fish yeah the end but so
we have an empty take there is there a
frog in there in the process see the
froggy oh I see em he's alive it is
another filter we know that we haven't
changed it up yet we don't think that
this tank is a very big yeah yeah and
that's kind of to why I was showing you
guys about the other aquarium that we've
been wanting to put in forever because
we want like big beautiful tropical fish
that like the kids will know forever you
know they'll be able to move their
little stole over there look inside and
know their fishies and those fish are
going to last five to ten years longer
like these another just little dinky
fish that I mean because this melted
they couldn't live if I didn't then I
don't know if work we want to continue
doing like little fish yeah they were
sorry this artwork so basal filaments
are working something maybe little more
fun yep so that's our disappointing news
today more disappointing news
it's about art you can really make a big
deal of it that I sense they were
winning for such a short time
alright we are starting our fun little
tieing project we've been is going to be
my little buddy right here multiple
times it's a cactus I'm putting into the
head of an owl pot Wow I get that in
quite a seat my fingers are yeah yeah
but yeah so we've got aunt Christie over
and the girls over and uncle Jes over
there they didn't know that they were
coming over for I guess apparent our
potting day oh well I invited for tea
with something because the girls are
always been really wanting to play with
you yes as a parent I became - yep we
we're on vacation
you were on vacation but you're back now
all right so now that we have a lot of
our plant is haunted we can go around
and replace the fake ones so check this
one out
this is I call it the dream beam it's
like our string beans fake plant going
to replace it with serial version get it
back so this little bit reasonable lie
there but it's gonna grow again yeah
it's actually bigger but the little
strings are a little bit smaller as you
all know yeah like away colder less
space versus real yep
and here is my pride of joy my very
first cactus I really hope that I don't
kill it because it is a good looking
cactus you guys there's just something
about cactuses they're like cool looking
but they're also like dangerous and can
cause a lot of harm I don't know I think
it's cool I love them I don't know what
to do with this one just going to be
like moving it around the house I guess
till it finds a little home look it's
got a little butt
do you see the little bud right there I
don't know what that is
