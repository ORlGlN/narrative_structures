ball thing and pray you tell him - no he
just picked it up and started running
toward to you on st. Patrick's Day is it
uh three leaf or four leaf clover
otherwise we'd be super lucky yeah cuz
look here's a nice on a three leaf
clover yeah of course
wait what we're looking for Florida four
leaf clovers the three leaf ones are
cool - it's not a four leaf but it's a
three leaf okay being to find a four
leaf what would you do you make a wish
if you front of poorly it's just good
luck I believe huh
I guess our Irish friends can
yeah if you're from Ireland let us know
about the four-leaf clover thing I'm
really interested actually and can you
actually find a four-leaf clover are
they just a myth
there's gotta be pony colors yeah is
very rare also is it unlucky to pick the
clovers cuz we just picked a bunch just
came to join us hi puppy oh you didn't
like that one this one's fine just not
the other one
wonder if it's kind of nice to it I
don't know he got jealous
come here I just realized - actually
that I swapped out my black case for my
green case this morning and I literally
wasn't even thinking that it was st.
Patrick's Day I just was like oh it's
the green one because I found it
shuffling to the drawer and I put my
food in it but it actually happens to me
see look at all this green we got going
on and we're sitting on green yeah I'd
love a clever
ah come on drop me I won't drop you uh I
didn't drop you come on come he has even
carrying this ball in his mouth the
whole time we were sitting there come on
Carmen
we're leaving let's go what up bump bars
miss she's running into the house right
now to put caramel away and then she's
grabbing some pants but we're running
late for church like always and then I
think we're gonna do something cool for
st. Patrick's Day we there's a couple
parties going on in town and I just want
to get out of the house and enjoy
ourselves a little bit Oh also this is a
good opportunity a lot of you guys asked
us what vlogging camera we use and this
is what we use it's the Canon ELPH 110
HS I think but that's the vlogging
camera we use do you guys check out the
beard it's getting somewhere actually
and see if it's better this way
yeah you see little something going on
face is trying to grow something at
least so that's cool it's not the full
like Irish beard that I was kind of
going for but still doing something
uh-huh here ships all right we are off
we're probably gonna be late still Oh
Missy has put clothes on so I'm gonna
stop watch busy got her hair got in her
sunglasses
like doing a puzzle without looking at
how people are posting on my Instagram
that I need to shape well I'm not
shaving this is an experiment and I'm
gonna see what happens just guys to deal
with it it's just for a couple weeks
where look at you guys I designed this
video this way
one fish Earhart's just kind of you know
what's on our minds for the journey so
we just got out of church now and we are
headed to go find somewhere to go out
for st. Patrick's Day
grab some food planning to go to this
place called the Tilted Kilt which is
like this huge Irish pub but it sounded
pretty crazy when I call him on the
phone so we might even be able to get in
there so we tried go into the Irish pub
but it was like crazy packed and so now
we're just ending up going up to our
stable place which is bdub if you don't
know a beat up is it's Buffalo Wild
Wings and it's really yummy it's a
really bad place to go if you only have
a thousand calories left in the budget
there's a child underneath our feet
hello under there I'm the last person
she's right under me
this is awkward like I don't want to ask
its Missy's favorite song playing right
now these are potato wedges and they
actually are like sour cream and onion
flavored and they're so green beer
you think it's gone bad but
yeah this cool trivia thing to look at
I'm setting it up my name is Brian
nizzle what uh throw on the screen Brian
and miss miss you are going down
apparently we waltz uh cuz we both just
got the first question
I've never seen other guys I don't know

it might be terminator actually you got
hit Terminator number four hit it
it was it was terminator
I got it wrong I suck at this game this
is my score right now big fat zero

you get 63 from that one question that's
not fair
