on having them here too because I'm like
when you're at the end of your pregnancy
like every day just drags on you feel
like it's never gonna get to your due
day and it's gonna take forever and I
feel like they made like two weeks like
flyby yeah and Elly also did dishes a
couple days it was pretty awesome good
she's here yes he's here someone else's
can eyes I heard the door chime go get
him he wants to clean your face bend
down let him clean your face and look
who's at the back door it's karma is
like a magical disappearing dog huh
did you have fun with coda overwhelmed
by people so hi karma boy you just want
to go outside he's like yeah I miss you
too I'm gonna go take a bite so my dad
grabs some baby bananas also apparently
my mom has no toilet paper yeah he grabs
some baby bananas which we've never
tried before and the reason he grabs me
cuz he thought all he would look so cute
with little baby banana in his hand what
do you think
whoa it's a baby banana watch out for
the peel take a big bite it's an Ollie
sized banana is it yummy say num show me
your banana hold it out show me your
banana are you like it you need to wipe
your nose go to mama
little mama and blow your nose so today
we're gonna test out Ollie in the pool
and we're gonna open up the gate and see
what happens if he jumps in if he swims
to the side if he waits for one of us to
go to get in the pool we don't know he's
pretty safe when he jumps in he can go
to the side and hang on but we just
don't know for sure so we're gonna test
that and then papa is on call and if we
need him he's gonna jump in the pool and
grab him really fast like that oh wow
that was a huge butterfly look at this
butterfly right here holy cow
it's huge
that's insane but yeah it's really hot
it's nice out the pool looks good
Karma's playing in at Karma you having
fun you need to watch oli okay alright
let's watch him
it's kind of looking don't think that
he'll get in without us because I think
he knows that he can't swim all the way
yeah get in the water very deep to ripen
and easy yeah look at him sitting there
oh there he goes that's what he does he
is being like extra cautious I think
yeah I think think he is being cautious
he's not jumping in the tea bag good job
buddy say look at look at that he's
going to pop Brian come here and get
another angle of this Wow it's not
comfortable either and just say that
okay are you like out of breath he goes
into like my ribs and kicks yeah I said
you know he's feeling tearing it up he's
moving right now up here's oh really
falling up
we just got done with dinner and we ate
food and we're feeling good and
somebody's not fun too well
Missy's counting contractions right now
do you think you're having breakfast and
Hicks yeah a few breakfast but oh are
they usually not that common Braxton
Hicks aren't supposed to be like that
consistent you're not supposed to have
more than for an hour
oh really and but like they're not
painful they're uncomfortable and they
do I don't wanna say they hurt they
don't hurt I'm gonna do they just it
hurts cuz it's tough tightening my skin
so hard and like he's in my ribs so he
like instantly is like yeah so just
keeping an eye on them you don't think I
think you know worried about yet how
many of you had so far seven okay wait
you said six or seven
but they're not very consistent like
summer four minutes two minutes almost
30 seconds yeah they're kind of random
but yet they're there's a lot of them
it's only a contraction technically if
it's changing your service right yes but
there's no way for us to know that
unless you go into the hospital and get
checked I really feel like they're just
practicing unless they get like more
painful then I would be like okay so
this is what's happening and they've
become more painful we're not together
all these toothbrushes way cooler than
mine
Ninja Turtles is that what it is yeah
that's cool we got all y'all tucked in
are you ready to go night-night Nick
he's got woody and Jessie oh no covers
on tonight oh no no we're laying down
okay we'll really woody woody okay
hey Mary woody do I read this you okay
all right guys they're gonna be woody
and they're gonna we're gonna put all
the beds uh I don't want anyone to worry
I'm not having like serious contractions
or anything just keeping an eye on why
the Braxton Hicks that I am having and
probably go in the hot tub like I'm not
too hot relax my body a little because
it might just be that I'm a little bit
that's awesome like doing too many
things and that's what's causing it so
I'm just gonna like kind of relax my
body some more anyways I hope you guys

few days and we'll see you tomorrow say
