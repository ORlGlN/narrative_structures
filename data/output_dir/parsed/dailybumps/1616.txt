I think I'm gonna change that I want to
be under 200 pounds so I want to weigh a
hundred and 99 pounds so I wanna I need
to lose fourteen and a half pounds in 30
days I think that's totally more than
doable you guys so I'm going to be doing

it's okay
look at that holding it shake it around
take it room oh it's okay you dropped it
I'm doing it you guys I'm headed to the
gym
this is my first time and I'm pretty
pumped I am kind of bummed you guys I
woke up and I had like this total like
sore back because I slept wrong
obviously but I'm excited we're gonna go
to the gym I'm gonna meet with a
personal trainer I'm there and they're
gonna walk me through sort of what I
need to do
I totally this is really bad you guys
before you go to the gym put on
deodorant okay
cuz you don't want to be smelly and I
totally forgot to put on deodorant and
to bring deodorant so I ran to Walmart
and grabbed some deodorant real fast but
I also was able to pick up one of these
cool iPhone sport bands there's like 20
bucks I think it's Duncan so I doubt
I'll be using it much today because I
think I'm gonna pretty much be face to
face with the trainer so I'm not gonna
be doing a lot of listening to music but
I thrive on music so if I'm running on
the treadmill this thing is gonna save
my life because it's gonna keep you
motivated
wish me luck you guys I'm kind of
nervous I don't really know what to
expect like I said I don't work out I'm
not working out kind of guy should be
interesting
hey dude we just read axon we are trying
to relax Oh Brian's at the gym so I'm
thinking this could be a perfect time
for a little nap I've been trying to get
all things like cleaned up and I kinda
like when the seasons change you always
want to like like ah like almost like
spring cleaning but fall cleaning I
guess so I got all my fault clothes and
organized and cleaned up and things have
just been like so much I just feel like
everything keeps falling apart because I
just feel always so busy like I'm just
always taking care of a baby doing stuff
yeah it's ridiculous but I will say that
I thought that my my nesting phase was
just gonna go away once I had him but I
still and like constantly wanting to
like clean up and get things organized
and fixed so I have to like wait for the
perfect time to actually be able to do
that because it's just so crazy we have
a baby toupees baby my goodness halftime
holy moly you guys that felt so good I
just got out of the gym today I did
cardio and biceps triceps the trainer
seriously like worked me like that was
it was fun though it was fun like I I
like I said I'm not like a person who
works out so it's fun feeling all that
like the I don't know it's just you kind
of get like a rush from it you know and
now I'm starving and I didn't eat before
I should have ate lunch before but I
didn't because I'm still bad yeah I
learned a little bit about strength
training and my buddy is actually gonna
I convinced him and he's gonna join too
and he knows all about that kind of
stuff so I don't really have to pay a
personal trainer which is hella
expensive I'm taking a nap with my boy

myself some food
I give karma all the yucky purple at us

attention to that mattress but maybe she
did some fall cleaning and so it's like
you can actually see the carpet in here
it's not gonna stay babe you doing tape
it so it stays how do you store
something like that so obnoxious and you
don't know like put in the hook arm in
the middle of it climb a burrito from a
burrito extra guac Oliver is not amused
Oh baby spinning up help me help me help
me we're standing here Missy's getting
dressed to do her video and what's wrong
what the heck guy you forgot about me um
this is like I put your Harry Potter
books up there they're on order no
they're not they're way out of order you
need to read those okay I'm pretty sure
this one goes last because I remember
this one taking up all my girlfriend
boyfriend time when it came out so we
just got done filming a video and I
always find it really funny when we have
a camera like right in front of our bed
it looks so weird and like sometimes
like our friends will come over and I'll
be like oh and here's our room and I
know that looks really weird but it's
you know we're youtubers so sometimes
that just happens always really awkward
when I give people tours and there's a
camera in front of our bed hovers
downstairs so I've really got to go get
him but I really don't want to so I
think instead of walking down there I'll
just do YouTube magic so all right
abracadabra
