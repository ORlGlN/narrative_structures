pretty exciting

little railway place where we actually
took photos for the album artwork and so

video although I'm gonna have to find it
outfit for some other performance shots
but I'm headed there now and I'm really
excited just to start working on this
thing I'm really excited just to like
tell the story of this song I guess in
video form because it's different I
think it's going to help you guys

better too but I'm basically driving out
to the middle of nowhere you guys look

not to
what sweaty pits the cousins are over

just one thinks he can do anything and
everything he thinks he can do what CJ's

done with some performance shots using
this old fashioned vinyl which I was
lining up our next shot I'm gonna do a
reverse here of you kind of see what
you're looking at
oh right into the background yeah and
basically it is very hot today it's not
as cool as it was when we did photos so
I'm using this space in between the
train to cool down because the wind
travels pretty fast here so it's kind of
nice oh and look at this area we opened
up this area too we liked these seats
but they just seemed a little bit more
like modern not really kind of what
we're going for I love the color like
this teal color of these seats up here
we're having a ton of fun in the
backyard swimming maybe the conference
play more fun ma that's the spirit
there was some fighting beforehand and
everyone put a smile on your face and
everyone's being so happy now that's
good
look at this train out here though I've
been seeing too this train for like the
past three takes I guess you could say
this train and I are getting pretty
close right now my despair
oh we will take us everywhere we go
now we're getting some fun shots for the
lyric video so I got a cool little
Polaroid of all three of us and Joe is
under this check it's the only way you
can shoot right out here and it's
probably like 100 degrees in there yeah
just like a song it's relaxations yeah
spotty at the train we had so much fun
with the baby mom you we want dead da
that is busy right now we had so much
fun and we kind of wore ourselves out
that now we're relaxing on the couch and
we're watching of course frozen yes
listen to Olaf seeing the summer song
which i think is one of my favorite
songs so this is so cute and bunny sick
mom I'm training much protein actually
have to leave any minute to go grocery
shopping and so my sister is actually
picking me up cuz we like one car and
Brian had to take it all right that is a
wrap on day one of shooting for the who
new music video if you're wondering who
that is behind me that is sage say hi
sage that is Joe's girlfriend who's been
assisting us with like playback and
stuff like that so it's been really nice
I feel like it was a productive shooting

Brian's a rock star over here thanks bro

really good not been able to stomach
tacos Oh Mexican food whatsoever which
is not cool because we live in
California so that's like our main food
meet lots of Mexican food down here in
Cali
oh are you eating your rice finally oh
you got like two little pieces of right
you eat things so weird Ollie there you
go good bite did you have a fun day
Ollie okay
des des then you watched frozen huh we
washed frozen today we watched half of
it earlier and we watched have it with
Daddy huh
oh he doesn't want to go to bed though
did you pull oh he pooped
oh that's a really bad one by the way I
just got him new cups because I tend to
sometimes throw out his cups if like
milk goes bad on them if I like find
them and there's like milk I just don't
even I just throw it away
I'm sorry I just bought on these cups
and I bought them before and I'm gonna
I'm gonna be honest guys I really feel
like these are the ones that do not
spill I've never had a leak out of them
so I'm gonna tell you there's a nuke
yeah hey I'm Luke there's like a little
thing on top and as long as the thing is
and they're like I've never had a leak
from the sides from the top like I I
feel like through them but I know in the
beginning when I was giving him sippy
cups he likes the chewy like the soft
one so if your kid doesn't do the soft
ones then I haven't found one that
doesn't leak because when they're soft
then they tend to just like if you bite
them or like squish them then they will
start leaking
all right you smell like poop I have to
change you all right we're clean and we
got our jammies on and we're ready for
