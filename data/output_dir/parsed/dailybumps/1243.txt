it's long-sleeve and it's got this cute
little guy on it with a mustache and a
bowtie what are you doing oh you learned
how to step on the pedal I guess you got
moms up to as you know I am painting and
I'm super confused by this paint so I
just did a coat and then I did a second
coat but then when I started going back
over the second coat just to like get
some touch-ups as I was going over it
would like remove paint and go back to
the red yeah you need to let it dry all
right maybe I did it too soon
so that that is technically like a first
and second coat but I didn't do the
edges because even when I was going over
with like the edges it was taking it off
so Brian touched it yeah Did you touch
the paint just a little bit goodness new
experiences are okay and look at how
adorable your shirt is it's like oh this
is my steak this was it really he really

clothes that's sitting in here I'm gonna
have to like move this but
they're olly olly
feed karma he dropped that one come on
Karma's eating his breakfast let's go
life hack time if you have a spot in
your house where the tile meets the
carpet sweep onto the carpet and then
just vacuum it all up when you vacuum
your carpet I'm sure that's probably a
very old trick and me just now learning
it is kind of pathetic right boom I'm
basically done with the first coat
everywhere except for some of the trim
and so this is what it looks like right
now that's one coat this is two coats
and up there I just um kind of repainted
it a little bit but I really like the
second coat I think it looks great
well I'm really happy like I swear this
room just looks like a totally different
room I really like the color I might
actually end up doing this color in this
room as well he looks really good I'm
going to actually take a break which
it's really hard to like stop painting
when you're in the middle of painting
because you've got like all your brushes
