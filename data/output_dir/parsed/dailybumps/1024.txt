energetic toddler here and he wants to
play so we decided to go to the park
Brian's taking a little nap are you

love watching him play on this thing
he's literally just about figured out
how to do everything and he used to just
kind of go and not really and like
trying to be scared and now he just
plays he loves it and actually couple
times when we leave the park he'll just
be like no like he doesn't want to leave
good job he doesn't no problem he's not
scared at all he's got a stick and he
saw a bunny rabbit it probably hopped
away oh if you see a bunny
come here tell me about him the baby
bunny it was so cute well looks like I
caught up on all my sleep that I missed
in Portland I did a bunch of work in my
office responded to a ton of emails my
inbox was like filling up the pie
waiting bed and woke up hours later it
does suck I feel like whenever we're on
vacation
oh hi Karma hi when did you get here
hi boy I feel like whenever we're on
vacation I'm always like just push
myself too far I was up to like one or
two like always finishing the vlog or
making sure the vlog was up and I would
love to like it like maybe like an
editor like only when we're on vacation
but every time we travel that's like
always when I make the videos like extra
cool and stuff so I feel like they
probably want to be as cool if I did
that but at least I have home so I can
catch up on my sleep although I hastily
bring this much in the meal of the day
yeah I was a big gun okay I'm getting up
all by himself and he does a new trick
that he absolutely loves to do kay do it
Oh
drops oh my goodness that was new you
are crazy it's just like a little monkey
how are you so strong like that takes a
lot of upper arm strength this kid is
very talented and strong
you always grab the side so funny
oh he's gonna try and go one more okay
now you're scaring mama I came by the
park to pick up Missy and Ollie okay
well his running away oh it had so much
fun at the park apparently I just love
how he like climbs all the way up
himself goes down the slide himself hey
buddy hey you still want to play no he
did most of the time here he's played in
the grass he found a little like like
ball that's something that fell from
here you know that's so funny
all right after a very fun day at the
park we are now at the mall that I am
just determined to get only a little
woody doll and a Buzz Lightyear you can
get on like a real one that has like the
removable haha the one I was looking at
online has a removable hat which I
wasn't a super fan of cuz I was like
he's gonna lose that immediately and
have the string oh that's so cool I was
like oh man this is so good you want to
see woody
what about was
that is so filthy oh my gosh I feel like
they're over he like had so much fun but

buzz it's a plush version it's kind of
squishy I would like the plastic does he
have wings oh he doesn't have wings
this one's cooler ha buddy I know we'll
take him out so you can play with him
okay we also found lot so remember him
from today they make him look dirty
yeah they make him look dirty like
strong to smell him
can you smell it Molly he's like that's
the bad guy he's so plushy though they
say the smell lasts a long time to us
it's like little beads inside of it
thank yous that ollie
is that Sheriff Woody if you want to
play let me so excited I think there's a
snake in my boot there you go
what do you think of that buddy a hook
you see you pull the string
and he wants to put the hat on him
that's so awesome they've
oh it says Andy on it we just ate dinner
and all he played with woody the entire
time he's so fascinated with him it's
hilarious I've never seen him play with
a toy I know you're the new Andy Andy
like he I was like I'm not sure if I'm
the like the whole happening which I
still I guess
what'd he say oli is in bed which is a
success and let me tell you he did not
want to put down his Woody doll he was
pretty much addicted to it all the way
to the end but I was just doing some
dishes I've been catching up on a little
bit of housework
you know I tend to leave the house clean
when I leave it just ends up getting
really messy as soon as we walk in the
door so there's always like tons of
stuff for me to clean especially
unpacking which I have not done yet I've
so much done tagged but luckily we were
staying in the house so I did a lot of
laundry so I don't think I have any
laundry to do so that is always a plus
I'm pretty much addicted to going on
vacation to places that have washer and
dryers because it is a huge help so that
when you come home you don't have three
loads of laundry to do but yeah actually
I am super bone though we do not we're
supposed to go grocery shopping today
and I'm out of a lot of like essentials
that I usually need for like for me to
live for me to live a karma it is so
good to have you home I missed you so
much

fluffy I need to give you a haircut you
