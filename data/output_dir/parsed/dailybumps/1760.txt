yeah I'm converting everyone I'm glad
that we are spreading the good news of
chicken morning guys
so today look who's gone that is not
here um I usually am the one that wakes
up early and I go to work but this
morning Brian had a little videography
gig that he had to get to really early
and so he left super early and now I
have to get ready and leave for work but
I didn't want to say I get a lot of
comments people saying wow you eat a lot
and you gain anything and it is true I
do eat basically I've had the luxury
like not worrying about what I eat
forever because I wasn't gaining a thing
and I was like well if I'm not gaining
anything I need to eat more obviously
and now that I'm not that I was eating
more I was just not caring what I eat
past couple days actually I've started
to see those pounds starting to go up a
little bit faster than I'm hope that I'm
happy with
I actually just weighed myself and I
have 133 in the beginning of my
pregnancy I was 123 and about I think
around nineteen weeks I was probably
about 129 eight I don't know I just in
the last couple days I swear it's gone
up about three pounds way too fast so
I'm gonna have to start really being
more careful about what I eat because I
don't want to gain it fast I'm okay with
gaining weight I want to see the pounds
going up it makes me think healthy
healthy baby you know stuff like that
but I don't want to gain it too fast and
I don't want to be unhealthy because I
don't want to like not pass my
gestational diabetes test and all that
so oh I got to be careful now hi
so I met Missy's work now John and I
actually did a really cool commercial
for his moving business this morning and
it turned out really awesome and missing
need some help moving things in the
office so we are helping her out over
here moving it we put her desk from
there to there we moved that desk over
here and so we're having a good old time
over here at Missy's office boom boom
boom boom look at this
this is John soda this is my soda still
dig your mind real quick so we just cut
out a Best Buy um we rearranged Missy's
computer and we gave her like a new
monitor in her office
so we had to get her a new adapter but I
found the case that I want for my phone
and it's actually really funny because
we're big modern family fans and every
time I see Phil the dad's iPhone case
I'm always like that's so cool I want
that iPhone case so I actually found it
at Best Buy and I put it on my phone and
it feels amazing and I love it and so I
bought it on YouTube for half the price
YouTube I mean I bought it on eBay for
half the price and Missy thought that I
was being stupid because I wonder I
wanted to buy it here and then buy it on
eBay and then wear the case from here
while I'm waiting for the eBay one to
get here then when the eBay come one
gets here return the case back to Best
Buy so that I pay the price I want and I
get it right away but she just thought
that that was just too too much well you
it's like a week you just wait a week
who cares like because I can have it
right now for the same exact price hey
the $30 think of it as a deposit No
well that's just ridiculous what how is
it ridiculous I do that all the time
I've literally done that four different
times like Best Buy specifically oh my
gosh no you're not doing that
time I hate this case look at this lady
go not only is she power walking
but she's lifting weights while waiting
for the green but light to be gained she
is just like yeah she's so committed she
has not taken any breaks

you look so strange without a beard now
yeah I know I went back looking for
something I was wondering like um when
did we do this and I looked back and I
was like whoa there's me with like no

weird this week is you lost weight and
revered all the same time so your your
picture is the extra different yeah you

really fast though it's weird okay our
next run is from super Tom's mum it says
my three-year-old son Thomas and I love
watching your vlogs every day every
morning he brings the iPad into my bed
and says Brian today mommy I try I can't

- and you cuddle up and watch your vlog
in bed before the baby gets up we like
when we read that we were like oh yeah
this is a little here's the thing just
wants to watch it Brian be fine
awesome so hi Thomas okay so this next
youtube comment is from a mommy 2011 she
said I wonder if the Green Knight always
being booed has any a negative effects
on his mental state I know it's just a
job but constantly the constantly booed
at work every day by a large an audience
must be rough yeah I feel pretty bad for
him and he did just look like a jerk
yeah long hair and he was like and you
know it's fine because the green section
was kind of small - oh you're totally
right okay this next one is from MS teen
mom 2011 starts and local post but where
did you get the name Karma interesting
question um when I got karma I was
feeling kind of like hippie-ish
I guess you have to go and do like a
little hippie phase so I wanted like a
cute name and I for some reason I wanted
to start with a K so I texted cha cha if
you know what that is it's like this
texting thing that you can text them on
any question and you can get an answer
and so I was like what is a cool name
that or a hippie name that starts with K
and they send me Karma I was like okay
that works and I thought I came up with
it alright so now we're gonna go to
comments from Facebook Jessica Wilson
says next time you're starting season
one of friends and plan on going through
to season 10 let us know I bet I can
beat you I watch the seasons with a
couple weeks it'll be a friend's race
with your fans also season 8 is the best
what's your favorite season um probably
I think seven is seven and that's how
you're going I have to go and watch I
don't know
one off the top of my head this season
where rachel has like super long hair
and is dating first Bruce Willis
I like that oh that's funny um we will
totally let you guys know when we're
restarting we are on season and we just
started maybe like two weeks ago
so we fly through them and a lot of
people have been asking how we actually
watch friends because obviously it's off
the air and I actually have every single
episode in my iTunes and so we use our
Apple TVs because we're obsessed with
Apple so we use our Apple TVs to
actually watch them from my iTunes thing
I know I have seasons 1 through 10 every
single episode but we love friends and
as soon as we're done with us for
probably most friends ok yeah ok so now
we're going to go to some Twitter
comments um Felicia Strickland says she
thinks it'd be awesome if Missy landing
and Brian landing told us happy
anniversary in tomorrow's vlog ah happy
anniversary ok so this is from Jamie a
cow Amira
and she is Jamie daily on Twitter and
she actually also has a YouTube channel
called Jamie Bailey where she vlogs but
she said tried Olive Garden's chicken ok
soup for the first time today I'm a fan
yeah I'm converting everyone I'm glad
that we are spreading the good news of
chicken no keys okay Missy actually
called them the other day when we found
out we can get it by the Gowan like 25
bugs but it's a gallon of chicken I can
see of like I know long that lasts
I bet that's the cheaper way to go with
you know um Meghan McConnell at says is
it weird
whenever I hear JT suit-and-tie think of
Bryan Lanning and daily mums talk I
don't think that's weird at all Bryan it
listens to knowing life time that's
awesome yeah I don't think it's weird
though okay so now we're gonna go to
comments from Instagram all right mrs.
numbers Oh 9 says I vote karma next
mayor of Idaho that's a good idea
except he we don't live around a while
we love to we'd love to like how to
cabinets yeah that'd be awesome yeah the
thing it works so well in Idlewild
because they're all hippies and in this
town that we live in in most towns and I
can put up with a dollar the mayor
because Karma's not as fast so okay so
actually jessica says you make me my
Olive Garden and I've never had it
before Australia should definitely get
an Olive Garden yeah like we were
actually just talking we were at all God
we were like I wonder if Italy has an
Olive Garden or Mexico has a Taco Bell
or if Australia has an Outback
Steakhouse and I think Australia has an
Outback Steakhouse but none of the other
ones you can let us know in the comments
if that's true or not because they're
American like probably Italians think oh
yeah I don't know I mean it's not that
hard to mess up pasta okay so next
comment is from Sammy we're 93 she
tagged us on a super cute picture of
this kid shoving his face into a camera
and said future baby all of you and
that's so true because he's gonna have
so many pictures of him I mean it's
gonna be ridiculous I'm gonna fill up my
18 terabyte drove oh yeah we pissed yeah
