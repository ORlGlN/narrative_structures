lever wanna be inside
coming all just again
Wow
good morning it is the afternoon now I
have been cleaning up the household that
making sure that kids are clean and
ready for the day and looking good right
actually well he left this morning funny
so he is at a meeting right now and I
think he'll be home pretty soon knowing
he might even be bringing in someone
yeah it's just been a really nice
morning it's been hanging out with my
kid today looking out Alanna mallanna
came out and we have already lost it
like two times huh
yeah that's like any other game it's
like today we are pretty excited about
Moana Finn was it all I love that I love
it pretty awesome huh yeah we sing all
the songs and we danced since about the
time under the table so yeah if you do a
pretty great day cuz Moana da well then
guess what time it is
Oh like Chinese it it is nap time for
mr. Finch i'ma come now a quick oh I'm
good
you guys oughta karma is walking us to
nap came to help him sleep
come on
hello you guys the time has finally come
hasn't it what did we do we open up all
the Disney minute bags are you cited so
Olli has been opening all these and
putting them together and he did such a
good job dude
that's fine do you want to tell me who
all these people are okay who's that
and who's that stitch
who's this Alice in Wonderland is that
is that is that Daisy is that Maleficent
yeah is this Minnie Mouse could this
talk who's this but what you're the
coolest whatever huh
yeah who's this huh
and is it Nick meet mr. kitty cat
Chester cat yeah you can play with all
of it
Oh stinking cool and I got to say when
ollie is not looking we probably should
hide them all at the Disney Castle
because they'll all get lost and
destroyed so one thing I've learned
about Legos and toddlers is it's really
fun to put them together but then when
you let them play with them they
basically just take them apart and then
you don't have the instructions anymore
and you can't put it back together you
can have a pile of Lego but don't even
go at each other stop it's probably for
the best
so just having fun with that now

dad are over and we are playing
something's about to go down so we're
having a little play time that's worth
Douglas this is such like I usually play
in the backyard with karma but alright
watchman listen again so great having
these stairs it wears them out so much
faster
I thought karma can go all day if we go
in the backyard but when he goes up and
down these stairs he's like done at a
certain point and he'll actually be like
can done I really can't play anymore and
it's just layers while he didn't jump
