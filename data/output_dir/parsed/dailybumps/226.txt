we did it it is so much better I got rid
of two huge bags of just a lot of things
actually a lot of it was even booked we
tend to like rotate because they breed
the ones that are in the room and as
long as ages are clearly see anyway I
got rid of a ton of stuff and I put
Legos up here and like if you want to
play Legos you can let me know and I'll
get them down stay with all your little
figurines he's got so my figurines and
he plays with these all the time but I'm
just like you just get them everywhere
so just telling you want to play with
them and they got books blankets
actually clean out everything that was
under here he did have a ton of costumes
a lot of them he didn't even fit into
and so I got rid of some and then I put
the rest up and away so he can tell me
if he wants to uh change into a costume
I did leave a few like masks and things
up here for him to play with but very
minimal things and we got rid of a ton
of toys
he just got his favorites in here and a
few things and I actually thought would
have a ton of beans that were in his
being bad because one of them was like
super full and they couldn't they could
only use one so now they look good so
