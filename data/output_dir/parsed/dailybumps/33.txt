-  Finn, you got
to take your boots off.
(laughs)

- Good morning, guys, so I want to share
with you guys something
a little bit exciting.
It's a little bit exciting so today,
I am wearing a size large shirt.
I haven't worn a large shirt since I was
in high school probably,
this is a Ravenclaw shirt.
Someone actually gave me this as a gift
which I completely understand,
they don't know my size
if I'm a large or an XL.
I've been an XL for probably three years
and I'm probably a lot more
comfortable in them now
but today I saw this large shirt
and I was like, I'm gonna put this on
and look it actually fits,
you guys, that's pretty cool.
You know how you always keep
those clothes in your closet
that are just a little bit too
small and you're like, well,
maybe if I lose some weight,
I'll be able to fit in them.
I don't really have a whole
lot of clothes like that.
I never did that (laughs)
so this is probably
the only thing, size large
shirt that I will wear
at this point in time but anyway,
it's a beautiful day and Missy
is getting the boys ready for swim class.
- Is the new Jurassic World out?
- No, it's not, Ollie (laughs)
Every morning Ollie asks me if
the new Jurassic World is out
because he saw the movie
trailer during the Superbowl.
It's so funny, you're
more excited about that
than Solo, huh?
- Yeah.
- 'Kay but I'm excited for Solo
so you've got to go see
the Han Solo with me
and I will go see the Jurassic
World movie with you, okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Hey, are you going to swim class today?
- Yes!
-  Are you so excited?
- Yes!
-  You gonna be a
good boy for the teacher?
- Yeah.
-  And show him all
your cool new swim moves?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
(yells)
-  Good morning, Finn,
you getting your socks on?
(babbles)
-  I love how all the dogs
are just all over the place all the time.
- I know, they're always with us.
-  Boys, your guys'
room is a mess today.
Are you gonna clean it
or hide in the tent?
- Hide in the tent.
(laughs)
Yeah!
-  This is how
Finn leaves the house.
He's just hanging onto Missy.
- He just grabs onto me if I sit down.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
-  Hang on, use your feet! (laughs)
First class service, look at that, whoa!
You almost ran into me, dude.
Alright, Ollie's taking
his own car to swim class.
(laughs)
Finn's like wait, I want to
drive with the man. (laughs)
Have fun at swim class!
- Bye, I'm going to swim class.
(rattles)
Yeah! (laughs)
- Who's ready for swim class?
- Me!
(screams)
- They are so excited,
it has been a little bit
of a while since we have done swim class
and we took a bit of a break,
can't remember exactly why.
I felt like Ollie was
just a little stagnant.
He wasn't really going anywhere
and that Finn was in a guppy class
and I think I was just over
getting in and out for him.
So anyways, they are both
going into private classes
which is the first time for both of them.
Ollie did semi-private with Peyton.
That was really fun and
really really good for him.
Finn has always done guppy classes
which is with other kids
so I'm super excited.
I think Ollie's going to do amazing
'cause now that he's in preschool,
he knows all about teachers
and how you gotta listen, huh?
Yeah, so I think he's
gonna do really good.
I'm really excited just
to get him progressing
with his strokes and I'm
hoping that, you know,
with a little bit of lessons and stuff,
maybe he can eventually
go into a swim team
or competition type stuff
since you guys know.
He is literally the most amazing swimmer,
a four year-old swimmer I've ever seen.
You amaze me all the time and then Finn,
we definitely want to get
him safe in the water.
He's not quite there so
I think he'll do good.
He might need me 'cause
I don't know if he's ever
been away from me or
done a class without me.
So it will be interesting to see
but he'll have his brother
there to show him the ropes
and so I'm really excited
to see how they do.
Let's head to swim class, 'kay?
- Yeah!
- We are almost there, guys,
I'm so excited to go in!
-  To go in the pool?
- Yeah!
-  Are you excited to learn?
- Yeah!
(yells)
- We are here, guys!
-  Wahoo!
(babbles)
-  Are you excited?
Finn, are you excited?
Okay, we've got Mimi and Papa.
Are you excited? (laughs)
- Finn, you excited?
- Yeah!
-  Finn, you got
to take your boots off.
(laughs)
You look so cute, are you ready?
- Yeah.
Ollie, your brother got right in.
Are you proud of him, how cool, huh?
(upbeat music)
So they actually have two separate
private classes right now
and they're at the same time
which is really nice
because we're not trying
to keep one under control,
the other one's running around
or the other one's
swimming and vice versa.
So it's really convenient and
I think that they kind of,
Finn definitely sees
that Ollie's doing stuff
so he wants to do that too
so I'm so proud of them.
They're both doing really good.
(upbeat music)
Boys, you did so good
in swim class, I'm so proud of you!
Ollie listened so well and I know that
within no time, you're
gonna be like Aquaman,
swimming so fast, huh, do you want to go
into a swim team one
day and do competitions?
- Yes!
- Yeah? (laughs)
- How about we can do a swim race?
- A swim race, totally.
And Finn was even listening so well.
She said, "put your feet in the water."
He did it and I think that within no time,
he's gonna be floating on
his back and super safe.
Now we are headed into
a little grocery store.
We gonna go grocery shopping?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, with Mimi and Papa?
- Yeah.
- So this morning, when Ollie ran
into our bed, he told me
something really funny.
He told me that he had a dream
and I was like no way, what was it about?
And he was so excited, he told me,
he told Missy, he's told
everyone that he's seen today.
It's the funniest thing but I'm
gonna let him tell you guys.
Okay, so what happened, you had a dream?
- Mmhm.
-  And what happened in the dream?
- It was about Momma giving
me a fire scorpion tattoo.
-  She gave you
a fire scorpion tattoo?
- Yeah.
-  And where was it?
- One was right here, one was right here,
and one was right here.
-  So Momma gave you
three fire scorpion tattoos?
- Yeah.
-  Whoa, what color were they?
- They was red.
- Red?
- Yeah.
-  That is nuts.
- And then Momma gave me
a black one right here.
-  Oh really,
so Momma was giving you
tattoos in your dream?
- Actually the black one was right here.
-  Oh, okay, then you got a tattoo
from swim today huh, that's cool.
Ollie, have you had other dreams?
- Um, no, just one.
-  That's the only
dream you've had so far?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, was it fun?
- Mmhm.
- It wasn't scary, huh?
I think that, technically,
was Ollie's first dream
that he's ever had.
- I have one more thing.
- What?
- That was a lie!
- Okay (laughs)
- That's never happened
before, that was so funny.
I think that was Ollie's
first dream, you guys.
I think he had a dream that Missy
was giving him a tattoo, that's so funny.
(coos)
- It's a heart?
- Yeah!
- Aw.
-  So the boys
have Valentine's Day cards
and they're going to exchange them, right?
Oh, wait, you already
did exchange them, right?
So this is to Ollie from Finn
and this one is to Finn, love Ollie, huh.
- Yeah!
- Finn is very excited, okay,
you basically just found a way
to get a lollipop out of this, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah (laughs)
-  By the way, Finn
is wearing his Disney jacket
when we went and did a
bunch of Star Wars stuff
so that's why he says that,
he looks so cute in it though.
Alright, you can open
up the lollipop, boys.
Oh, can Karma get a lick?
- No.
-  No, come on, give him one lick.
- No!
(yells)
-  Do you want me to open it?
Got it, there you go, buddy.
- Can you put this somewhere?
-  Sure, I will put
this in your memory box, okay?
- Okay.
(laughs)
This tastes like cherries.
- Yeah.
-  Is it yummy?
- Try it!
-  Try it, guys, try it, try it!
(upbeat music)
