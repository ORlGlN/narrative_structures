- This is the perfect time to do something
with Ollie that I've been
wanting to do for a while.
And we're gonna do a little, father-son
Halloween costume DIY, let's get started.
♫ This is our life.
♫ This is our fun.
♫ This is who we are.
♫ This is our dream
♫ this is our team
♫ shot among the stars.
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine.
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine.
♫ This is our life.
♫ Let's live it.
♫ Live it forever.
- Morning.
-  Good mornin' Finn.
Did you have fun yesterday?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, who came
to your party, Batman?
- Yeah.
- And what did Batman give you?
- (mumbles)
- He gave you this.
-  A very special medal.
-  Birthday hero.
-  Look at it, he loves it.
He's like oh my gosh I am
wearing a real superhero medal.
This is the medal that Batman gave him
yesterday, it says birthday hero.
Is that your favorite thing ever now?
- (mumbles)
- So Finn's real birthday is tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- And I think we just got
out of giving him a present.
Because Batman gave him a superhero medal,
so I don't think it gets
any better than that.
- (mumbles)
- Yeah, (laughing), if
you guys have not seen
yesterday's vlog I'll have
it linked in the I-card.
We had an amazing
superhero birthday party,
for this special little boy who is
gonna be two years old tomorrow
and I just love him to
pieces, I love you so much.
And I love you, because you gave
birth to him, we should be
celebrating you as well.
- Well we made him, so we
should celebrate you too,
- Oh cool let's all just party.
Finn's like wait you guys
that was my birthday party.
Hey Finn, cool thing about
medals you don't have
to hold it 'cause it just hangs
on your neck, there you go.
-  Say, thank you.
- Thank you.
-  And he's all sad.
(upbeat music)
Hey Ollie, do you see what's over there?
- Spider, black spider.
-  That is a giant spider isn't it.
- Look at that giant spider.
-  There's giant
spiders everywhere?
Ooh that one's fluffy.
- There's lots of spider web on it.
- Yeah it's covered in spider webs, huh.
They have the restaurant
all decked out for Halloween
and Ollie is like, in love with all of it.
(soft music)
Hey, Finn, how's your
breakfast, is it good?
Just make sure Batman
doesn't eat any of it okay?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
Check out these chicken and waffles
we got you guys, this is definitely
the kind of food you need after
a long hard party like
yesterday (laughing).
Comfort food, I'm probably gonna
eat like an eighth of this but,
it looks so good, so I had to get it.
- Alright now that we're
done with breakfast
we are going grocery shopping huh.
- Yeah we gonna make
get milk and chocolate.
- Yeah we're out of milk (laughing).
Grocery shopping with two kids
can be really hard and so I was like
mom do you have to go grocery shopping?
So we're both going grocery shopping
and we're both gonna take care of kids.
I've got Oliie, and my mom has got Finn
and she's like off doing her own shopping
and she's like super organized
when she shops, she's like I'm going here,
I'm going here, I'm going
here and then I'll be done.
I'm like, I'm gonna walk all the aisles
and til I feel like I have everything
and I'm probably forgetting something.
So let me know in the comments
what kind of shopping you do.
Do you, super planned out for your
shopping trips, or do you just walk
in and go alright what do I need.
Finn just turned two, well
he's turning two tomorrow.
And he's all of a sudden demanding
that he wants like little sippy cups,
like baby sippy cups,
almost even like a bottle.
So I'm buying him like a baby
bottle type of sippy
cup, it's not a bottle
so we're not going like that far backwards
but he doesn't like the ones that
we have now, he always cries,
he goes, baby bottle,
baby bottle, baby bottle.
I'm like you've never had
a bottle in your life.
But he really wants them so, I went ahead
and got him some little baby
ones, hopefully he likes them.
- Alright you guys, so Missy and the boys
just got back from doing
some grocery shopping.
And I think that this is the perfect
time to do something with Oliie
that I've been wanting to do for a while.
Hey Ollie, what movie you watching?
- Big Hero Six.
(upbeat music)
- He came home, he really wanted
to watch Big Hero Six, it's one of
the movies that he's been into lately.
Finn not so much but
Ollie really likes it.
We are going to dress
up as the characters.
I picked up all the individual things
I would need for his costume,
and I got my costume.
And we're gonna do a little father-son
Halloween costume DIY, let's get started.
So I googled this on my phone
and this is what I came up
for Hiro from Big Hero Six.
This is what is our end goal for Ollie.
And this is what we're gonna try
and pull off for me,
hoping this costume works.
Hey, Ollie, you wanna dress up today?
I was thinking of a really cool costume.
I figured you could be Hiro,
and I could be Baymax from Big Hero Six.
Does that sound like fun buddy?
Should we do it? Okay.
- Does Hiro wear this?
- So Hiro doesn't really wear this
he already has this, this is his hair.
So we have Ollie partially dressed up
but to complete the costume,
we need to use a wig.
And I do not think that Ollie
has ever worn a wig before, so
I'm gonna put this on
him and see if it works.
You ready, are you excited?
It's a lot like wearing a hat, kay.
- Okay.
- See it's like a little hat.
Gonna put it on, it's a lot like
wearing a hat but it might
be a little itchy okay.
See, now you have Hiro hair.
Alright, we gotta try
with the wig cap first.
What do you think, how's that feel?
- Good.
-  See it doesn't
feel all itchy, right?
It's really soft, so now we have
to put the wig on top of it, kay.
Try this again okay, kay,
gonna put it on right,
on there, and it's going this way now.
That looks cool, what do you think?
Do you like it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's your new hair bro.
You guys Ollie is wearing a wig
and he looks just like Hiro (laughing).
What do you think dude, can
you see your reflection?
-  Yeah.
-  What do you think?
- Good.
-  It looks cool, yeah,
look at this long, black
rocker hair he's wearing.
It's so cute, alright daddy's
gonna get in his costume now, kay?
- Okay.
-  Battery charging,
battery charging, battery 50% full.
(Missy laughing)
-  It's filling up.
-  How are you doing in there?
-  I'm doing
great, but I'm Baymax now.
-  Oh yeah,
Baymax is coming to life.
Is Baymax coming to life right now?
Oh my goodness, what do
you think of that Finn?
(Missy laughing)
Oh my gosh that is so cool looking.
You are huge, huge (laughing).
-  Well hello.
-  What do you think of that?
- Good.
-  I'm Baymax, how
are you feeling today?
-  Happy, kinda happy, okay,
kinda sad, I don't know, sadder, sadder,
really sad, or mad which one are you.
-  I am sensing
that you are very happy.
- Happy.
-  So touch that one.
-  Beep.
(Missy laughing)
-  Oh my gosh that looks so cool.
Alright we're gonna go walk
around with Baymax now.
-  You look like you are well.
C'mere Finn, I'm gonna hug you.
I'm gonna hug you, I'm gonna hug you.
(Finn happy screaming)
-  What do you think of that Finn?
- Dada.
-  Is that cute?
- Yeah.
-  Hug, oh Hiro,
you're my bestest friend.
(upbeat music)
- Okay first of all, I
love him in dark hair.
-  I know isn't it cute.
- Oh sorry I didn't see you over there.
(Missy laughing)
-  Isn't he so cool, that is
like the coolest costume right.
- That's cool.
-  I am Baymax your personal
health assistant, what is your mood?
-  Right now it's, it's this one.
(Missy laughing)
-  Beep, you are happy, I can tell
'cause of your smile and
the redness in your cheeks.
- Oh my gosh.
-  Alright dad
you have to, (laughing).
-  But, it makes his eyes,
look at his blue eyes,
dark hair blue eyes.
-  That don't look like
Ollie, you sure that's Ollie?
-  I know it doesn't
look like Ollie at all.
-  Hiro, high five.
Jim, what is your current mood.
Beep, you could be happier, try taking
some time to breathe and relax today.
(girls laughing)
-  Yeah, I don't do that.
-  Well I don't
suppose you'd be able to.
-  What do you think of that?
-  Think he'd be able
to trick-or-treat in that.
-  Yeah I know, this is
what you should be for Halloween.
-  You're my best friend Hiro.
-  Aww.
-  Hold my hand and
guide me through your house.
I need to lose a couple
pounds, slow down Hiro.
-  You gotta slow
down, he can't walk that fast.
You gonna show him your room?
-  What, this is your room?
-  Yeah.
-  This room's amazing.
(Missy laughing)
-  Say, take a nap Hiro.
-  Take a nap Hiro.
-  You want me to take a nap?
-  Yeah.
-  Okay, I'm not really sure
how beds work 'cause I'm a
robot, but I'll give it a shot.
-  Oh my gosh (laughing)
There we go, wow, he's relaxing.
-  That was great.
-  That was so good.
-  Hey Hiro, can
you show me the kitchen?
- Yeah.
-  Go show him the kitchen.
-  I wanna make sure that
you have nothing but healthy foods.
-  Alright we're gonna
go show him our kitchen.
Maybe he could do our dishes.
- Yeah.
-  'Cause he's a robot, so.
-  Baymax does not
do dishes, unfortunately.
-  Why not?
-  Maybe in version two.
-  Alright we need to
upgrade to Baymax number two.
Ollie how is that wig?
- Good.
-  He's kinda been like
the wig is a little uncomfortable.
Ahhh where'd your hair go?
-  Hey.
-  There's Ollie.
-  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
Battery low, powering down.
(Missy laughing)
-  Still powering down.
Whoa, whoa.
-  Whoa.
- I got swallowed by a big robot.
-  Look, Ollie's
back and daddy's back.
- Hey, what's up dude, was that fun, yeah.
Just bringing a little Baymax IRL.
-  Yeah, I think
Finn liked that to.
Finn, did you like that?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  Papa's got some hair.
- Yeah look at that, this would be you
if you were like a rocker dude.
- I mean this is about like
1982 I'd say (mumbles).
- I feel like this is the hair
you had when it was brown.
- I had a tail.
-  Oh my god, I got lucky I found
a kid size wig too, it
fits his head really well.
(everyone laughing)
Let's try it on Finn, see what he thinks.
- Oh look at that, that you are adorable.
- Look at you.
- Oh my gosh that actually looks so cute.
-  Look at these layers.
-  And it's Hiro,
why do you look so cute.
- He's like and I'm done.
- We got like ten seconds.
-  (mumbles) Goldilocks back.
-  I'm surprised we got
that long out of Ollie honestly.
So wanted to give you guys a little update

It can be any like phrase that we say,
it can be a picture of
something from the vlogs.
It just has to be about Daily Bumps.
So what do you guys think that
we should put on our new pop sockets
let us know down in the comments below.
And of course check out the description
for the link to our merch store.
Dailybumpsmerch.com
Seriously look at all this awesome swag.
These Tribe shirts are so cool.
And we only have a limited
amount so if you wanna
get yourself one go nab
it before it's gone.
- Alright you guys we
are hanging out outside,
my mom and dad are over and Karma
is doing a bit of swimming,
it is hot, hot, hot out.
Honestly it is prob, it is
actually 100 degrees today.
Very, very warm day, but
the pool is really cold
the heater hasn't been working so
it's probably like 60 degrees
and so we're not really
feeling like going in it.
But, I've got the dogs out and Luna
is getting so good at
being with the chickens.
The chickens are out too, getting
some fresh grass and fresh bugs.
We've got a big old rooster
here if you can't tell.
Alright, my mom just discovered
that we have one more rooster
but we don't know which one it is.
I think it's one of the silkies
one of these white ones,
but I can't figure out which one it is.
Either way though it's definitely
not like a big rooster he's not
like the king of the,
the what is it called
king of the hill, yeah like this one's
in charge man, they follow him everywhere.
But I don't know which one,
which other one's the rooster.
But we could hear two
cockle-doodle-dooing.
He can only cockle-doodle-doo once.
- One very quiet, and one's really loud.
-  Yeah, so we'll see what happens.
You guys, check out my fruit trees.
This one just burst, but
yeah these are oranges.
We got lots of oranges on here.
Got lemons, we gotta pick these.
-  We gotta pick
them, perfect, feel that.
- Look at our fresh lemon, smells so good.
- Oh my god, oh it smells good.
(upbeat music)
Alright that concludes
our nighttime reading.
It has been so nice because the boys
can now like cuddle together in bed.
And we can read books and it makes
bedtime a little more, a little easier.
Although right now they
are both very tired.
I'm excited for the day
that they can share.
They can't quite share a room yet.
Finn's just a little to young still.
But it is cool that we can merge
some of their bedtime together.
And that way when we go to let them
like share rooms, it
won't be to much different
then their already, like, bedtime routine.
We're getting ready for bed, we're
gonna go ahead and end this video.
So make sure you give
the vlog a big thumbs up
if you enjoyed it, we had a super fun day.
Ollie's still giving a thumbs up
even though he's having a hard night.
You have such a fun little life, huh.
Daddy dressing up like
Baymax, how cool is that?
And look your little buddy's
here to cuddle with you.
Or sit on you while you're sleeping.
Anyways I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video.
We'll see you guys tomorrow,
what do you say Ollie.
- Bye, boop.
