me and Cassie and Ollie and Finn and
these guys and Cassie's actually waiting
in a line for the Dole Whip it's like a
big thing here we found Jesse Soren go
meet her okay okay all right
I left missing and everyone at
Disneyland and I am actually headed to
the studio because it's very close by
Disneyland and I had a couple of things
that I had to rerecord today so I'm
going in finishing up one last song and
then I'm all done all done recording
it's all we got to do is wait now for it
to be mixed and mastered and yeah
pre-order for the EP starts next month
that's crazy I've been working on this
for
are like six months now and it's just
consumed everything so it's cool to see
it finally start to come to fruition
because it was a bite
tell me Oh Cassie is back with the Dole
Whip is it good it's amazing my first
time having it it is your victory oh
that was good but I guess you want thank
you there are some nice well just take a
picture okay smile
I'll use my arm
that your brother see that's my brother
Casey by
people kick
okay goodbye
kind of a bummer right now you guys I am
at the studio but apparently it's not
the correct location I thought it was
this one and it was like super
convenient cuz it's like 15 minutes away
from Disneyland which is where we were
today um but it's not it's actually
about one that's over an hour away now
he said I could go but we wouldn't have
much time because I it would basically
cut into my session and Missy and the
kids are at Disneyland they'd get stuck
there for much longer than they were
anticipating so I'm gonna bump today
because I really wanted to get this song
done and get it finished and I wasn't
able to and it's frustrating because I'm
coming up to some pretty big deadlines
as far as music goes and I want to do
everything right I was having such a
good day to hang it out at Disney with
my family and then this this has to
happen that was somewhat successful
meeting Jesse he was a little freaked
out and so I had to help him and then I
feel so bad I was checking the pictures
and Vince head was like walk to the side
and now I don't even feel like I can
ever use those pictures I'm kind of
bummed and we tried to do it a second
time but that time all I was like not
having it but that was super fun I'm
glad we got to meet Jesse will have to
meet woody sometimes we have yet to meet
woody ever at Disneyland hell doesn't
call for an adventure yeah a bit woody I
don't think we've met
even woody and at Calvary adventures we
walked past him but we haven't met him
we're going that buzz so that was fun at
least getting to meet Jess because I
didn't even know she was a character
here so I was kind of cool Holly let's
just see what they look like on you
it's not happening I'm not gonna happen
dang it I seriously went to get him for
him but I don't think he's gonna do it
so not gonna wait on money throw for
