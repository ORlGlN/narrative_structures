buzzie new way to tell people you're
having a baby it's being called womb
Tube filming that exciting moment when
you discover you're pregnant then
sharing it with the world don't ask on
social media ABC's Sarah hi Haines has
been following this latest print for us
good morning there Sarah good morning
Robin we have the engagement videos and
then we have the wedding dances but now
people are posting their pregnancy test
results for all to see sure it's among
the most highly anticipated moments in a
woman's life am i pregnant or not and
now women are inviting the world into
their special moments and posting
pregnancy result videos online it's a
really special moment and recording it
and just sharing that with the world is
as authentic as you can possibly get
they're called womb tubers capturing the
moment they find out they're pregnant
and posting it on YouTube we're pregnant
I think having that moment captured is
huge for us Brian and Missy Lanning had
been trying to get pregnant for two
years when I started my pregnancy
journey I decided I wanted to get on
YouTube and like find other women who
are doing the same thing so when Missy
thought she was pregnant she turned on
her camera being on YouTube we sort of
have two families we have like our
family who like our mom and dad and
aunts and uncles and stuff and then we
also have like our YouTube family and so
it was kind of like a thing where we
filmed it for them so they can watch it
and over a hundred and fifty thousand
did but is this a private moment or one
to be shared would you guys ever
consider taking a video and posting it
posting it to YouTube of finding out you
guys are pregnant
why not
I think that's a private thing when
you're a kid growing up you like it to
see the moment that your parents found
out you were in existence I think that's
pretty cool I think it would be cool to
watch your husband's reaction I think
sharing your emotions and feelings with
the world is amazing you know I don't
think that you can go wrong
actually you pregnant are you talking
about when you find out you're crazy
it's such a raw moment it's such a
moment where you're just like oh my gosh
I'm pregnant and to get to actually
capture that moment it's just amazing is
it cold
doing you a favor for me this is all son
baby
boy he's gonna do amazing things
he wants to giggle so bad you guys quick
he weighs like 300 pounds my fuzzy goal
we ended up not having no to my aunt's
house for to watch The Good Morning
America segment because we found it
online so we woke up like super early
this is where always wins I know
we woke up super Elyse morning and
washed it and then we seriously went
back to bed to take a little nap because
we were all just super super tired but
so many tweets from people saying
they're watching us and they were like
as soon as you're on and I watch them
going back to bed and I was like us too
I was like really frustrated that
everyone was gonna get to see before we
do cuz we're the last people that get to
see it everyone in like New York and
like east coast or Eastern Standard Time
they get to watch it like four hours
ahead of us and so we're I was like what
the heck this is so stupid
and so it's three o'clock in the morning
I like go on my tweet roll I was feeding
all over anyways and then I go on
Twitter and like in the morning yeah and
I was like and everyone was treating me
like pictures and like sending us stuff
I was like this is so awesome I can like

good good no I mean that's supposed to
be kind of Lizbeth yeah you're happy
she's like yeah I'm gonna break out like
really soon we had an awesome day it was
really really cool getting to see us on
Good Morning America and I have to say
it's just so cool because but it's all
about like spreading that message it's a
message that means no matter how
insignificant something in your life is
when you record it and you look back on
it years later it's instantly priceless
these little moments that we record with
you know Missy and I and with all of her
and like doing things around town and
stuff it may not be like the most
exciting thing ever in the world you
know but when we look back on it like a
year from now two years from now where
it's gonna be like it's literally gonna
be priceless and I think that's
something really cool I think it's just
a cool reminder to go out there and make
memories with your family because that's
what matters that's what life is about
it's about making memories with the
people you love and having fun and I
think that's something we try to do with
our vlogs every single day that's
something that's super important to us
all so I just wanted to tell you guys
that and thank you for all the awesome
tweets and stuff I wish I could like out
reply and retweet and favorite all of
your heads tweets cuz I got so many you
guys are just really really awesome
obviously Good Morning America had to
make the segment sort of light-hearted
so they didn't really get to share off
our whole story
cuz the interview was much longer
obviously and I will add they did take
things out of context and that's fine I
sort of understand how that works like
you know Good Morning America doesn't
really have a good rap when it comes to
YouTube they kind of don't take it
seriously and that's something that us
as YouTube vloggers need to something we
need to make happen anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed the vlog thumbs up if you
did and as always we will see you guys
tomorrow oh let me know in the comments
if you came from the Good Morning
America if you saw some Good Morning
America and you came to our channel and
subscribe I'm pretty interested to see
how many people did that so we'll see
you guys tomorrow bye sir this is not
what I ordered they're all really cool a
lot Oh too bad
thank you bad
