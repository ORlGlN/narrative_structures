- Uh-huh!
- I don't think he missed me.
Did you miss me?
- No.
- No.

Good morning!
How are you guys this morning?
-  Good.
- Yeah? It was a little bit
of a sad morning this morning
because we had to say
goodbye to our friends, huh?
Ollie's a little still upset about it.
We really like our friends, huh?
We had such a good time, it's so sad.
But it's okay, they're just gonna go home
and we're gonna see
them really soon, okay?
-  Okay.
- And we have some fun stuff planned
this summer with them, okay?
-  Okay.
- Finn, how are you doing?
Finn's coming with me to
take Ollie to school today,
and I do have some errands to run,
and since Bryan is
actually still on his trip,
he gets back today, he's gonna
be tagging along with me.
Which is exciting, huh?
He has not been feeling his very best.
As you can hear, I don't have
a sore throat or anything,
but my voice just keeps, like, cracking,
and I keep losing my voice.
I think it might just
be, like, the weather.
I'm not really sure, but he
seems to be doing better today,
he's happy, so that is always good.
But we are off to school.
We gotta get there because
we are kinda running
a little bit late, just a little bit.
Not as much as, like, the other day.
But just a little bit, so we gotta go.
You guys, I had to pull
over to show Ollie and Finn
this amazing, amazing rainbow.
Do you guys see that?
(gasps)
Wow, that looks so pretty!
Ollie, do you see it?
- Yeah.
-  Finn, do you see it?
How cool, huh?
(Finn vocalizes)
Do you think there's a pot
of gold at the end of it?
- Yeah.
-  (chuckles)
(relaxing music)
Look at these handsome boys!
Finn, you never take us to school, huh?
Oh, he's like, "Mama, I
just need you to hold me."
Finn, normally, when we
take Ollie to school,
you're still in bed.
- Ah! Jump the water!
-  Jump over the river!
Wah! (chuckles)
-  That was funny!
- Normally, Finn is just in bed.
He's like, "I'm too tired for this, Mom.
"Why are we up so early?" Huh?
All right, let's get
Ollie to school, 'kay?
-  Okay.
-  All right, say bye!
- Bye.
-  Bye.
- Say, "See ya after school!"
Maybe one day, you'll be
playing at this playground, huh?
- Yeah.
- He's like, "I wanna play."
I'm like, "It's really
wet out there." (chuckles)
You're gonna be soaking
wet if you play out there.
But maybe next year or the year after,
he'll be at this preschool, and he can
play in the playground, 'kay?
- Yeah.
- I am definitely going to need this
if I'm going to get through today.
Yeah, I dropped off Ollie, and
Finn has been, whoo, on fire.
So he actually has a cake pop.
(chuckles)
It is 9:00 in the morning
and he has a cake pop.
Whatever keeps him happy.
But yeah, I mentioned
earlier that I am working
on a project, and I have
some errands to run today,
and I am so excited
about this little project
that I'm doing.
I'm actually picking up my friend, Brooke,
who's going to help me.
And I can't tell you right
now what the project is,
although I'm gonna take you
along, you guys can maybe,
like, guess and figure it out.
But it is a surprise for someone,
and so I can't share it
to you yet, but really,
really soon, hopefully
within the next week
I can share with you what I'm working on.
And I cannot tell you how excited I am,
this is gonna be so much fun.
And I hate being someone that, like,
doesn't give out all the details.
I like to give details.
But, can't really do that right now.
So, yeah, I'm picking up my friend Brooke,
and we're gonna go shopping, and go out,
and do some stuff, and
we've got Finn with us,
and I'm like, "Oh, I hope
you're a happy boy today."
I hope you, you got
chocolate all over your face.
Whoo! I mean, if that
doesn't make you happy,
I don't know what will.
Hopefully today goes good,
and hopefully my voice
doesn't start, like, going away,
or I have to, like, whisper.
Ack!
All right, I've got my friend, Brooke!
And we actually just ran
into our first store,
and we're, like I said,
we're working on a project,
and we have to keep it kind of a secret,
but we've got some fun stuff back there.
I can't show you everything, but yeah,
we're really excited.
Finn has just been so
sad all day. (whimpers)
He's watching a little show right now,
but we're headed into
a couple more stores,
and then hopefully we can start
really buckling down on this whole thing.
- So exciting!
- It's so fun!
All right, I am back home after doing
some fun little shopping with Brooke,
and guess who's here?
Ollie!
- Yeah!
- Did you have fun at school?
- Yeah.
- How did your share go?
- Good.
- Today he shared his
dragon and dinosaur, huh?
- Yeah.
- And guess who else is home!
-  Daddy!
- Me!
-  Yay!
Go give Daddy hugs!
- Did you miss me?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? I missed you, too.
- Daddy's home.
Ahh, it's so nice to have him home,
and have, my voice is like so messed up.
-  Aww.
- Just to have the whole
family back together.
We definitely missed him, huh?
Did you miss Daddy?
- Yeah.
- I don't know if Finn missed me.
Finn!
-  Finn, where are you?
Finn, come here!
There he is!
(Finn giggles)
Did you miss Daddy?
- Uh-huh!
- I don't think he missed me.
Did you miss me?
- No.
-  No.
-  Oh my gosh.
-  I don't think he missed me,
I don't think he missed me.
-  That is not
even true. (Finn giggles)
Did you miss Daddy?
- No.
-  You tell the truth right now!
I think he wants you to do
that thing where you cry.
-  No, no!
-  And go (imitates cry).
-  Finn, did you miss me?
Did you miss me, Finn?
- No!
(Bryan imitates cry)
- I missed you!
-  Oh, thanks.
-  Aww.
You missed Daddy.
But now that Daddy is
home, and we are home,
we thought it'd be fun
to do a little project,
a painting project.
This has been sitting in
my game closet forever,
and every time they see it,
they're like, "Can we paint?"
I'm like, "That seems
really messy." (chuckles)
But I'm gonna go ahead and
set them up so they can paint
while I make dinner.
- You're gonna paint?
Do you wanna do, like, monster trucks?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
-  That's cool.
-  Okay, I think we're gonna
have to share this one, okay?
'Cause I think Finn already
broke into it. (chuckles)
Sound good?
-  Yeah.
-  All right, the
boys have their pictures
they're gonna color.
This is the one that
Finn's doing, and Ollie,
what are you doing?
- I'm doing this one.
-  Who is that?
-  That's Ryder, right?
-  Ryder!
-  Yeah.
- All right, we've got all our colors.
You guys are gonna
share it, and you've got
three paintbrushes.
-  So you can't move it, okay?
Let it sit right here.
And then these are your paintbrushes.
You guys know how it works?
-  Mm-hmm.
-  Yeah.
-  'Kay.
-  Ollie, you
gotta get your brush wet,
dip it in some water, and now
dip it in the color you want.
There you go.
-  Here, Finn, you can do that one.
-  Yeah, see the yellow come out?
You're gonna need a little bit more.
-  If you get a little more water,
you can get more paint.
-  All right, Finn,
you gotta get your brush wet.
So you put it in the
water, and then you put it
in the color that you want, perfect.
-  This is light blue.
-  And now start painting blue!
Ooh, yeah.
- I'm making a rainbow Ryder.
Look, now he has a broken eye.
-  Ah!
-  Finn, you got
pink on you, what happened?
- I paint him.
-  His big brother
happened, that's what.
- I just paint Finn.
-  (chuckles)
- I love you, Finn.
(Finn vocalizes)
-  That is so good, Finn.
You are doing great!
Lots of pretty colors on there, huh?
- We're making dinner together, yay!
And we're making spaghetti.
It's a house favorite.
We need a good pasta dish
that is just very homey.
Yum, and Bryan's always
so good at seasoning.
I stink at seasoning.
Sometimes I make spaghetti, and I'm like,
how did I mess this up?
It has like, zero flavor.
- Babe, no.
-  Yes, yes.
We'll see, you like spaghetti, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  I like noodles!
-  You like the
noodles from the spaghetti?
- Spaghetti is noodles.
-  Yeah, exactly.
And I cheat, and I use
this Prego meat sauce.
This is what I've been
using since I was a kid.
Well, I guess what my mom has
been using since I was a kid.
And I like it, I wish I
was a little more talented
to make my own spaghetti sauce.
I don't even think it's that hard,
but I don't even know if
I would actually like it.
-  I mean, that takes all day.
-  I know!
- It takes way too long.
- Okay, see, it is hard, so. (chuckles)
- There's some food that
just takes too long to make,
and you just don't deal with it.
-  Yeah, so this
is yummy, and it's easy,
and you just dump it in, and
you're good to go. (laughs)
And I usually always have some in there,
because this is just a nice go-to dinner.
Yay, family dinner!
-  Family dinner.
And Finn, what are you sitting in?
Are you sitting in a big boy chair?
- Yeah.
- We have regressed a
little bit, because--
- (laughs) Is that our life with kids,
is just not liking food anymore.
-  Yeah, Finn
just doesn't sit anymore,
and I'm like, you just need
to sit and eat your food, so.
I'm like, we're gonna try this out.
-  And look, we
can still cheers, Finn.
-  See? Cheers!
-  Cheers, Finn!
-  All right, fine,
we'll cheers. (laughs)
-  Okay.
-  But yeah, we are
eating delicious spaghetti
that we made together, yay!
-  So good.
All right, Ollie is
going to try the noodles,
and they are covered in
cheese, and they're supposed
to be really yummy, right?
- Yeah.
-  Look at them,
they're like worms.
Here, hold one up, let's see it.
Whoa, they're like eating worms, Ollie!
- Yeah.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  But they're yummy worms.
- Oh yeah.
-  Yummy, nutritious worms.
-  Those are the best worms.
- 'Kay, guys, I'm gonna try a worm.
-  You're gonna do it?
- Yeah.
-  All right, let's see you do it.
You're so brave.
- Trying to get this one.
-  Good job, dude!
What's it taste like?
It's not, it's not really a worm.
I was just kidding.
- I don't like it!
-  It's yummy,
though, it's spaghetti.
You did so good, you
just tried something new!
-  Yay!
Good job.
Dinner was somewhat
successful, I don't know.
It was delicious, but
the kids were just crazy.
Finn is just really off today.
Has been the past few days, and you know,
Ollie's just Ollie.
What are you doing, Finn?
-  Jump in pool!
-  You're gonna jump in the pool?
- Yeah!
-  (gasps) 'Kay, do it!
He's like, "I mean the hot tub."
-  Jump in, Finn!
-  Go, Finn, go!
One, two, three, jump!
Go, Finley.
Woo! Good job!
- It's swimming time!
-  Woo! Are you having fun?
- Yeah.
-  You beg to do
this every single day, huh?
- Yeah.
-  You actually
went swimming yesterday.
- Yeah!
-  Woo-hoo!
Swimming time.
- Oh, Karma and Luna.
Did you two miss me while I was gone, hi.
We just got out of the hot tub,
and it is so cold, you guys.
I think even the dogs are like, let us in!
Let us in!
We got a fire going.
It's chilly.
The boys burned off a ton of their energy,
so we're getting them ready for bed now.
Oh hey, you two cool kids.
Show me what you got, show
me what you're wearing.
-  Show 'em your jammies.
-  Star Wars jammies!
Do you like them, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Are they comfy?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Yeah.
I got them Star Wars jammies
so I could surprise them,
since Daddy had to be gone
for a couple of days, huh?
I love them, though.
They look good!
- Yeah.
-  Are they comfy?
- Yeah.
-  You can't stop
touching them, huh? (chuckles)
-  They're so soft.
-  What are you doing, Finn?
- He's like, "I need to cuddle with you."
-  Aww, sometimes Finn just
still needs to be the baby.
- He is still the baby.
-  Yep.
- Yeah, if I ever don't
act like he's the baby,
he goes, "Mama's baby."
-  Watch this, guys.
- And Luna comes in to say.
Luna, come here.
Luna, come here.
All right, show us, Ollie.
What do you want to show us?
Whoa, you can crawl
all the way under that?
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.
Can you come out through here?
-  I can come out through here.
-  She's so funny.
She's like, "Hello, hello."
- I know, she like, I can't do anything,
I'm not allowed to have a separate life.
- She missed you so much.
-  Oh, I bet.
-  She was like, "Where is my Dad?"
- Aw, Luna's like my baby girl, huh?
(laughing)
- She's like, can't even.
She's like, "I'm just so
happy we're all together!"
-  I know. (laughs)
- She literally acts like their sister,
like, she's just like,
annoying, but like, adorable.
-  Yeah. You guys are so cute.
I feel like you're in like a
little nest of love right here.
- I know, they're so cute.
Finn, yeah, Finn has like
this weird habit of, like,
if he doesn't think I'm
treating him like my baby,
he'll literally grab my tummy,
he'll go, "Mommy's baby."
(Bryan laughs)
Because he wants me to know that
he came out of my belly, so he's my baby.
And he's got a point.
-  Yeah, he's funny.
- You're my baby, too.
- Yeah, you can be the baby, too.
-  Check out what
else I showed the boys.
Carl got my that. (chuckles)
It's cool.
Goodnight, Ollie.
-  Goodnight.
-  Goodnight, Finn.
- Night.
-  Love you, dude.
(upbeat music)
