- Good morning, guys.
I am headed up to Nacho right now.
I'm actually in the truck,
and I'm headed up there
because I'm dealing with
a little bit of an issue
with him right now,
(bell dings)
and I'm hoping it doesn't
turn into a bigger issue.
I'll give you guys more
information once I get up there,
but yeah, I'm just a little worried,
a little bummed, and I'm hoping
it's nothing too big of a deal.
Let's go check on him,
and see how he's doing.
All right, here's my boy.
He's out in the pasture.
Hi, you giving me some kisses?
Oh my gosh, he looks so handsome.
Actually, I don't know
if I showed you guys,
but I shaved his nose, and I love it.
He looks like a little man.
Freshly shaved, huh?
Not even a little man, he kind
of looks like an older man.
Hi, Funs, how are you?
This is his friend Funs,
and they actually get along really well.
They love to play.
Basically, like I said, I'm dealing with
a little issue with him,
but the other night,
I actually was riding him,
and he just felt a little bit off.
It wasn't anything too visible,
but I could tell something was
a little off in his front leg.
I trotted him around while
my trainer watched him,
and she said that his front left foot
was definitely a little, like,
something was going on with it.
Oh my goodness.
Are you biting each other?
Knock it off.
So not nice.
Oh my gosh, he's licking him.
Oh my gosh.
That's cute.
This leg, something
seems to be a little off.
There's no gashes, he's not
necessarily hurt at this point.
I did take him on a
pretty long trail ride,
so he could've been just a little sore.
Could be that he chipped something.
Could be that he has a little abscess.
Could be nothing that big of a deal.
Could be something that's
a bigger deal than that,
so we gave him a little butane.
and some Epsom salt, and
been letting him rest,
but I'm gonna go ahead
and lunge him right now
for the first time.
I've never lunged a horse at all,
and I've never lunged him.
I hear it's a really,
really great thing to do
for bonding and stuff, so we're gonna see
how he does, and if he's good to go,
then I'll give him a ride.
If not, we'll see,
maybe I'll call the vet,
and make sure nothing too bad.
You want to go?
You're so pretty.
All right, let's go, bud.
I gotta say, guys, I'm
pretty proud of myself
for being able to notice
that he had an injury
'cause it was definitely not something
that you would've known unless
you rode him frequently and
know how smooth he is and stuff.
You wouldn't have even really seen it
unless you knew what you were looking for
when I was trotting him and stuff,
so I'm really proud of myself.
I definitely feel like I'm
learning a lot from him,
and it's been a really
cool experience so far.
Now I gotta figure out how
to get out of the pasture.
It's looking good.
Doesn't look like it's
gotten worse or anything,
so that's nice.
Go this way.
I know, vlogging and walking
a horse is a little difficult.
All right, I've got him all saddled up,
and we're gonna lunge you.
Should be fun.
Hopefully, everything's all better, right?
Maria gave me a quick
little lesson on lunging,
and I gotta say, he's
pretty dang good at it.
I would say he's more
responsive to lunging
than me riding him.
Yeah, I think this'll be great to do
just 'cause he'll learn my voice,
and what I want, and how he does.
He actually does really good.
I had the little whip to move him,
but he didn't even need it.
He says, "Great."
(upbeat guitar music)
But I will say that,
after trotting him for a little bit,
he definitely still has a sore leg,
so I'm gonna soak it with some Epsom salt,
and do a whole little thing.
I'll show you guys in a
minute what I'm gonna do.
Hopefully, it gets better.
Basically, I can't really ride him.
I can maybe walk him a little bit,
but I probably won't even do that.
I'll do this for a minute just 'cause
I've got him hooked up and saddled up,
but really, I can't ride him
until whatever's wrong is fixed.
She's thinking probably
an abscess in his hoof.
Until that emerges and is done,
I really can't ride him,
and that could take
anywhere from, you know,
a few days, a few weeks, to a few months.
She had a horse that took two months,
just depending on how deep it is in there.
I really hope it doesn't
take months to help.
Hopefully, it's not.
Hopefully, we can get it out of there.
We're gonna use everything we can
to get it out of there, 'kay?
Poor guy, he's definitely uncomfortable,
so let's see if I can show
you some lunging really quick.
All right, we just went one way,
and I gave you a little trot just to see
if maybe any horse people want
to tell me what they think.
He wasn't doing too bad.
I'm gonna switch him to the other side,
and I'll trot him for just a minute,
and I'll let you guys check it out
'cause I know there's some
horse people out there
who might be interested
to see what he has,
and honestly, I'm
interested in your opinions
if you think it's anything too bad.
I don't think it's anything too major.
I really think it's just an abscess,
but I'm gonna try the
other way really quick,
and you guys can take a look.
All right, that is all I'm gonna do today.
I was actually gonna
walk him a little bit.
I gave you guys more trot and more canter,
and as you could see, he was definitely
throwing his head up, and that is him,
because he's a little uncomfortable.
His foot definitely is hurting,
so I don't want to walk him anymore,
and I don't want to trot
him or canter him anymore.
I just wanted to give you guys an idea.
I will say, first time lunging,
I know I'm not a pro,
but I actually feel like
it was pretty dang good and pretty easy
for my first time, so I'm excited.
He's obviously really awesome at doing it,
so that helps a lot.
If I had a horse that
didn't want to do it,
that'd be a little more difficult,
but he's awesome.
I honestly have learned so much from him.
It's been so great.
I'm gonna go ahead and
de-saddle him, or unsaddle him,
give him a little break,
and kind of fix up his
leg, put some stuff on it.
Hey, say hi.
He's like, "Guys, my foot hurts.
"My foot hurts."
All right, I am heading out.
Kind of gave you a little bit of b-roll
of us wrapping up.
She's actually showing me how to do it,
and all the stuff I need to buy.
It looks really awesome,
the way she does it.
I'm hoping it works.
I'm hoping that it can show itself sooner
rather than later 'cause
basically, it's like,
an abscess inside there,
it needs to come out.
We're putting stuff on it to hope that
it pulls it out, and I'm just so sad
that he's got an owie.
Yeah, I gotta go buy everything.
I just gotta say, I love
this place that I'm at.
I totally am a beginner,
but I've learned so
much from these people,
and they're just the sweetest, nicest,
most loving, it's just like,
they're willing to give me
so much time and attention,
and teach me so much, and it's just been
such an amazing
experience, and I feel like
I'm totally a part of this barn.
It's just been a really,
really cool experience.
For all you horse people, I don't know,
I'm loving it, I'm loving it,
and I know I've got a
lot of people watching me
who do a lot of horse stuff,
and I hope you guys know that
I am totally enjoying myself.
I know a lot of people
were a little worried
about me getting a horse as a beginner,
but I know it was the
best decision for me.
I'm really excited about it.
Anyways, as I was touching
my hair the whole time
'cause that's what I do, I'm
gonna go ahead and head home,
go see Bryan, and then I gotta head off
to get Ollie soon.
I am headed in to grab Ollie.
I am so hungry right now.
I have not eaten anything, so I'm gonna
grab him, get some lunch.
How was school, bud?
- Good.
-  Good?
Are you ready to go into
the horse store with me?
He was asking, he was like,
"Why are there horse tracks here?"
It looks cool, right?
- Yeah.
-  Ollie found the horse
at the front of the store.
Are you excited?
Hang on, hang on, watch,
you gotta put your foot here.
No, no, your other foot.
Now, put this foot here.
Yeah, there you go.
Then use that so you can push yourself up.
Oh my god, you just got
on a horse by yourself.
I'm so proud of you.
Look at that.
He's all saddled and ready.
You want me to give you some money?
- Yeah.
- I actually had a feeling
he'd want to go on it,
and I really wanted him to go on it too
'cause it's so cute.
I always see it when I come in here,
and he's never been on it, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Attention, parents,
please do not leave your child unattended
while riding the ride.
-  Okay, hold on.
Hold on to the reins.
(laughs)
What do you think?
(Ollie laughs)
What are you getting Nacho, Ollie?
Getting him some treats?
- These are gingerbread treats.
- Oh, those look delicious, actually.
They're like little muffins.
They got all kinds of yummy stuff in them,
so we are gonna get him that.
We got him a new curry comb.
I do not like the one I got.
Then a different one, some
shampoo and conditioner,
one of those, some more of these treats.
These are a little bit more basic.
We just got a few more things to go.
-  Missy just got done making
the most delicious looking dinner.
Thanks, babe.
- You're welcome.
- You're the best.
Sorry about your horse, by the way.
She's really bummed.
(laughs)
If she hasn't showed it,
she is really bummed.
- Actually, when I was at the store,
I spent most of the time
talking to this lady
who had had a lot of horses
(Finley shouts)
that are prone to abscess.
-  Oh, yeah?
- I'm so stressed.
Please, if you have any advice,
leave it down in the comments,
and you know how to draw this thing out
without splitting its hoof, apparently.
-  What?
- Yes.
- This poor horse.
- All right, dinner is done,
and we all ate so good, huh?
Now we're playing.
- He's in love with this porg.
-  I know.
- I'm in love with Zurg.
- With Zurg?
That's so cool, huh?
- He loves his Zurg.
Fin loves his porg.
I didn't know we were such Star
Wars people, but apparently,
we really are.
- We, apparently,
are very big Star Wars people.
- I mean, that's not Star Wars, but.
Anyways, I'm really hoping my
horse gets better really soon.
I'm so nervous about it.
Hopefully, it all is all good.
I got a bunch of really cool stuff,
so hopefully, it gets better.
- That's such a bummer
you can't even ride him.
- I know.
Can't ride him, really
can't even be lunging him.
- Aw.
- Can't really walk him.
He can play in the pasture.
- And you can give him treats.
Be a good time for him to fatten up.
- Yeah, if anything, I can
bond with him in other ways,
like just hanging out with him,
and brushing him, and stuff,
but I think it'll be okay, hopefully.
Crossing my fingers.
I'll probably gonna ferry
out there really soon.
Anyways, we're gonna go
ahead and end today's video.
It is almost time for bed.
(electronic music)
- All right, boys,
let's end today's video.
-  Can you say,
"Give this video a thumbs up"?
- Thumbs up, thumbs up.
-  Luna, Karma,
you guys can do thumbs up.
Thumbs up, yeah?
Okay, cool.
- Hey, you there, paw up.
-  Oh my goodness.
- Paw up.
- Paw up, give us a paw up.
Whoop, there you go.
All right, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say, Ollie?
- Bye.
