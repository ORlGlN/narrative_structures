oh my gosh look at him walking look at
him walking oh you know how to walk
already oh my gosh Finn holy cow dude
good morning guys I am up and getting
ready I am trying to do my hair but I'm
having a terrible hair day although it's
my own fault baby shower and I just like
it all like and now I'm trying to curl
over it and so I'm using my new me one
that I always use and I took it to
Florida I've never used it and
apparently it's completely broken does
not work I'm using my old new me one
which is this one I think even done a
video about it but my hair just because
of like the way it is it's just not
working not it just is gonna look like
spirals it looks so stupid I'm just
testing it right now and see if I can
brush it out and make it a little see
sit I just don't want to put my hair in
a bun agains I'm wearing my hand up in
the past like weeks but yet I didn't
really prepare yourself but also I
really don't want to the back I might
just put it like it until like this Oh
too bad right alright so this is what I
did I kind of like curled the each side
and then I pointed out it looks like
it's curled but then underneath it's
just like busy and then these hairs they
always stick out it's so embarrassing
but they're just like my baby hairs
right now and so I was able to curl them
a little bit so that they look a little
bit like I meant to do that
so actually they're just getting long
enough where I can curl them so I think
that looks pretty cute
and pretty easy to do although I'm still
really bummed that my other new me broke
I don't know what's wrong with it maybe
maybe it just needs to rush I use that
thing all the time so I'm gonna have to
get another one oh my gosh you guys it

Missy's dad when you need him right now
what isn't there there's a lot of
something in there Missy yeah we're
gonna see okay looks like a bunch of
lizards actually a bunch of lizards I

them out and set them free there they
are
think they're just lizards we'll see oh
it's just three lizards
yeah just some cute little lizards in
here but they're actually alive so we
just have to get some Pam and take them
out of this thing toriana take this back
up to the house we just got all three of
the lizards off we're trying to let them
know that it's okay huh here okay is
what you say okay you're okay lizard
hanging on them free yep we set all the
other ones over here's another one
you'll probably run pretty fast yeah
that's our other one see it's okay buddy
here you go be free with your other
friend oh wow
jumped he's like I'm out here yeah yeah
that's the one I was just holding hmm we
should probably let him go and let him
be free he was so cute with that he's
yeah like while I was trying to get them
off the sticky sounds like it's okay
buddy it's okay I'm sorry
lizard so cute set them all free they
look good and it look hurt too bad
that's always a good thing so for dinner
tonight all he has requested baby
pancakes and normally when he says baby
pancakes he means these little mini
pancakes I said I'm gonna make something
kind of the same thing but my own girl
of little recipes that I found on
Pinterest so it is basically ganache the
banana some flour cinnamon and some
blueberries I'm gonna stir it all up fry
in a little frying pan and then they
both will be able to eat little baby
pancakes will be like blueberry pancakes
put made-up banana send these requesting
breakfast for dinner I thought I would
go ahead and do some scrambled eggs with
some peas and carrots mixed in I don't
know if that's weird but I'm sure gonna
love it I don't know if I love it but
okay you get snack on that while I make
these okay but that's it all right we've
got scrambled eggs and my little
pancakes hopefully you like a Molly you
did you like them yeah I'm actually
wondering if these pancakes are gonna
turn out okay because it said to put a
little coconut oil down and basically
frying and so I sprayed a little coconut
oil down and I'm like pan frying them
but I'm wondering if they were supposed
to more like bubble in it cuz like the
outside Brown but the inside still looks
pretty gooey not that it matters it
doesn't have anything wrong in it but I
guess we'll see how they like it
alright Ollie has his dinner what do you
think golly good really good you haven't
taken one bite how about you take one
bite real quick no we're not you can
have this once you take a bite oh yeah
that's what I thought he's not a fan
guys but fin he's the real critic he
knows what food is huh Flay these are
swarm yeah these look good
and I think he's gonna really like this
what do you think of that like mom it's
warmed up banana what the heck you like
that you guys I think he's a fan he is
loving it good job boy
you know some of that now you were such
a good eater yeah Finn is probably gonna
eat that all gone which is pretty cool I
don't know what all he's gonna do but
that's just the life of a toddler I
think you don't cry okay so I'm super
happy with this high chair it moves
around really easily which I really like
it's nice and big so none of the food
okay falls on the floor mostly just
falls in there and over here so yeah I'm
super happy with it I will have to worry
