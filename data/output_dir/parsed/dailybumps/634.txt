share it and kind of look good as well
so that's why I found YouTube and that's
how they started
brightness is same for you when we when
we made the decision to start the dating
channel she already had a pretty good
following on her on her mommy channel
and people just wanted to see more and
more so we have watched maybe one or two
other daily vloggers we weren't really
sure what we were getting ourselves into
when we were studying that but I think
we were in the mentality of hey we can
do that hey that sounds fun and you know
she's pregnant so we also be document
that journey and now we have thirteen
hundred videos of all of us inside of
life pretty credible all right you guys
were here with Family Fun Pack just got

are now walking over to our interview
we're gonna be on this stage we that
stage is cool look at it yeah we're
doing a stage interview and we actually
have an announcement which I'm really
excited about - thanks guys
thanks for being here honor it's been
staged yeah I think that I started my
channel he's looking for that thing
I've been in search for and I found
blew up so we decided to create another
channel but you guys host daily bus and
all that that reflect the main channel
everyone wanted to see what we were
doing so and how does it change your
life I was an office manager and a
little tiny office I waited tables seven
years
and now we go to the mall and people
stop us and they watch our videos they
tell us their stories and it's really
cool because we can see not only online
the impacts we have analyzed but we need
them in person they tell us their
stories and how we change their lives or
how we help them through something
that's always the best part so I have a
little announcement regarding music a
lot of you guys know that I'm working on
an album right now or actually in
production right now and I want to use
the spot to tell you guys the title of
the album is actually called us so the
album is a concept album and it's going
to be really cool because it's going to
start with Missy and I before we were
even together and it's going to go
through a lot of different stories that
you guys never heard before regarding
our relationship so it's going to you
know start with us being kids in Idaho
and you know in the middle it's going to
talk about you know a lot of crazy stuff
that happened with our life that we
don't really openly talk about and then
at the end kind of where we
so there are things that you haven't
totally shared with your cranky a for
sure and how do you feel about the album
be excited you know I to be honest at
first I was really nervous about it it
kind of just like we've been through a
lot on the couple a lot of you may even
know this if you've kind of been
watching you'll know that we have gone
through some major as for normal people
yeah I'm sure and you know there's been
a part of our marriage where
you know things were not as great as
they are now and he's kind of stares
about that and so at first I was like oh
my gosh this is this is really bleep
like it they're going to really show
them a window into our relationship but
after you know really getting to hear a
lot of this song I think it's going to
be really really special and I see every
emotional story I think people are going
to really hopefully relate to it because
no relationship is perfect and sometimes
I think we come off as perfect cuz we
don't share all the little things in our
life and so
you guys may be like wow there have a
real relationship you know that's just
one of the things I want to really want
to portray is you know we we people say
we're perfect on camera but I mean do
you know our story we went through
struggles just like everyone does and we
want people to be able to relate to that
right when's that coming
so us will be released either later this
year or very early next year
what'd it say do your funny impression
of one another
me
I don't want to go there
dancer bread they're getting all the
tribes
