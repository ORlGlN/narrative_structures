obsessed with cereal mostly Lucky Charms
huh yeah look at that bite I was a big
bite we want to do that and see you in
class
what hey you ain't that you want to put
cereal in the bathtub that'd be so silly
I guess that would be kind of fun so I
get to swim and nothing but cereal but
you know it'd be really cool is it
instead of just the cereal you could
swim in marshmallows wouldn't that be so
fun so I know you guys remember I think
it was like a week ago I vlog that I
bought a ton of lucky tie material
because I was trying to win this box of
Lucky Charms all marshmallow cereal
which would have been amazing but of
course I failed I bought like three
bucks Lucky Charms none of them were
winners and I was really bummed though
maybe if I won the whole marshmallow
cereal we could have swam it in the
bathtub huh yeah it would have been so
cool to win that blocks of all
marshmallows huh yeah but unfortunately
you don't always win
sometimes you don't only get a
leprechaun just we're gonna go scary all
whoa is this real
Vinny what is this oh my goodness you

I think we have created enough mess for
one day what say you baby oh yeah you
want some in the trash can yeah I think
we got a cleanup
oh it is nice to be clean Holly you know
that we get to eat a lot of yummy food
huh but it's important to know that some
kids don't actually have that much food
they don't actually get to eat cereal
sometimes and that's that I actually was
just reading something that said over 13
million families in just America
struggle to provide food for their
family and that's just so sad like kids
who just don't get as much food and we
are lucky enough to be very blessed and
very fortunate and even in my worst of
times I don't think I've ever really
struggled for food but it's always been
something that's really important to me
and to all of us to which is to give
back to our community so we're actually
about to go shopping and we're going to
go buy a bunch of food for all kinds of
families who don't have food in their
homes that sound good yeah my toy foot
for don't you yeah we should definitely
buy toys for them ok all right so we are
shopping for non-perishable food items
that we can donate to the local food
bank so this is things that aren't going
to go bad like canned food stuff that's
not going to go back and then I think
we're actually going to donate some
money so that the food bank can pick up
like fresh milk and cheese and meat and
eggs stuff like that - all right build
these carts up boys you ready
I'm being are yes you are huh
I'm going to get them some good cereal
lucky charm and cinnamon toast crunch
cocoa puffs
grab some good cereal Ollie you like
honeycomb I bet they like honeycomb - ha
hey Ali you know how you love dinosaur
egg oatmeal let me have some right there
you want to get some for the kids that's
a food bank got some I bet they'll love
that huh but I think I love most about
this is that the boys like have a
passion for giving when you give them
the opportunity of it you want to get
cars for them see they're excited to
give things that day themselves like so
he likes dinosaur eggs oat milk he wants
to get them dinosaur egg oh no he likes
cars who wants to buy them cars huh you
want to get all the boys and girls cars
okay
all right you guys I think we have maxed
out our cards and quite possibly the car
we tried to grab a lot of really great
good food that was non-perishable I'm
really excited to drop all this off okay
it is a little later in the day now so
it's actually closed but what's really
cool about our church that we go to
every Sunday if they have a big donation
box out front so we'll get to pull up
into church drop a bunch of food off in
the donation box
three carts you guys now empty I got to
tell you my back is killing me from
loading up this car we got full trunk oh
yeah hey ollie the boys are holding onto
the card yes we got the cars for the
kids you can play with them now remember
we're donating donating them okay okay
check this out you guys I actually works
in a grocery store for like three years
I've never seen this before in my life
this is our receipt I could actually
want it let her ring in any more items
so it maxed out total number of items
sold 329 oh my god is the max amount of
items I came out so random I know they
came up to 800 three bucks so I actually
headed to another order for like 60
bucks
almost God of all I want to see but is
it we did it this is something that
we're really passionate eyes she likes
to do stuff like this all wide and
pretty often but you don't always a blog
about it that's not I feel like if we
blog too much about it and come off the
wrong way to some people I think also
like a big part of us giving back is
that it it's actually kind of between
like us and like our hearts it's
something that we want to do without
like asking for attention so in this
video you're gonna see a lot of like
here's like we're kind of showing you
what we're doing but we don't have to
show you guys because don't like
something that we want to be like hey
look what we did today
as parents we just want to teach our
kids that they are very blessed
and they live a life that not a lot of
other people live so we always want to
instill in them that like whenever they
get something new they have to give in
return so and that's something that we
make always do with this toy especially
like around Christmas time and hopefully
they grow up with giving harps and we're
excited as the kids get learned to kind
of like give back in other ways to not
just with money and things giving people
but also like our time we're excited to
do something like that
the I just mention that it's something
that we always blog about it is has
something that we like to keep private
between us we like to feel good about it
but not like like other people need to
like they all yours awesome and also
it's kind of making out thank God like
does the only percent really needs to
know what we're doing and stuff so we
kind of feel good about we're home and
we're checking out the new grass look
how nice it is we're technically not
supposed to be on it but I figured we'd
run on it like a couple times and then
we have to be off it for like at least a
a week or two
I love cereal you guys it's just it's
one of those things that you can eat any
time throughout the day you can eat it
in the morning you can eat it if you
have a light lunch or if you can eat it
for a midnight snack but the truth is
not everyone has access to cereal or
regular food for that matter which is
why I want to urge each and every one of
you watching to make a food or monetary
donation to your local food bank a place
that provides meals and food for those
who need it or if you're someone who
would benefit from that kind of
organization do some research and find a
local food bank near you that can help
as a kid there were times that I
struggled and our local food bank was a
place that we were lied on for breakfast
and milk and meat and cheese and I feel
so blessed that I had an organization
like that to help us and now that I'm
older I know the kind of value that a
place like that offers the community so
please make a donation to your local
food bank and if you do tag us in the
picture of you doing it on either
Twitter or Instagram so that we can
personally thank you thanks for watching
you guys I hope you'll have a great
night and PS know this video is not
sponsored we just really like lucky
charms and now to ollie for the by poop
you
