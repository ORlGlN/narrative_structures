up number two a stated taste another six
months Holly and Papa are making some
pancakes which is probably one of my
favorite things to do when I was a kid I
was always hoping number one because I
was the oldest and you mean his help
number two but he rarely helped yeah we
just usually sit up here and hang out in
the morning and make pancakes usually
make pancakes for my mom because we
always wanted to do something special
for her we eat our pancakes and their
best thing ever and now Papa's doing it
with you huh yeah you love making
pancakes huh yeah are you helping number

shower so I think I should be second
best for MoMA Ken would you like some
pancakes
we have Hannah and Natalia here and I'm
super excited because they're helping me
put some stuff up we got this really big
chalkboard which actually turns it to be
weight because it I thought is going to
be and so we're going to hang it in the
playroom and which I think will be super
cool unfortunately though my dad took
the screwdriver on I are not the the
drill on accident and so Hannah just
like totally improvised you like screwed
into the wall put the little hanger
there and yeah so we're gonna hang this
I mean
good morning you guys we are at the
Birmingham Airport and Jeffrey and I are
headed home today which is amazing
because I missed my house sometime it's
my wife but I miss my kids you got such
a crazy couple of weeks from moving
playlistlive performing on stage and now
doing the music video here in Birmingham
and my throat is just shot up so I'm
hoping that I can get home and get
rested up and relax a little bit but we
right now are at Jim and Nick's which we
went to in Alabama and I saw it in the
airport I was like yeah we're doing this
yeah at least one last time I mean this
is happening
okay right now we are stopped in Atlanta
and we're getting ready to board our
flight but I stopped to get ollie a
couple of toys so I got him a shark
popper this is like the Zerg thingy as
you put the balls in and you squeeze it
and it fires them and then I also got a
little tiny Delta airplane that pulls
back in flies I figured fin might like
to play with that too you guys I have
started a humongous project that I'm
hoping I can actually finish pantry is
nice I mean I love that I have a pantry
friendly because before I was just using
covers but it's also not like the
largest pantry it's not a walk-in pantry
whatsoever it's basically just shelves
and a closet with shelves oh I'm trying
to find the best way to stop this thing
make it easily accessible fit as much
stuff in it as I can because as you can
see I have a lot of food I've been kind
of separating it as like snacks and
breakfast foods dinner foods dessert
foods are kind of getting rid of some
food that's been in there for a long
time that we haven't eaten I'm going to
go through right now and I'm gonna go
ahead and set the camera if you guys can
see what I do and I'll show you my
thought process afterwards
think I'm done I feel like if I was
better organizing I could really utilize
this space a little bit better all right
so this is what it looks like when I
open the door didn't want the food that
Olly loves the most maybe like candies
like that to be like at eye level
something that when he opens the door I
open the door he looks at and just sees
and wants and grabs it so this way I
wanted kind of the food that he likes a
lot to be up high and the other foods to
be down low I actually ended up taking a
lot of stuff out of here and putting it
in this jar so we could just go in and
grab something got like our spices our
lunch and dinner like pastas we love our
pasta by the way if you can't tell and
then just like peanut butter bread I
feel like figure this is just like lunch
and dinner found the Dino sword huh red
Dino side alley guess he's gonna be home
today who should we draw daddy a picture
on our brand-new chalkboard yeah all
right ha ha ha ooh that looks like a
circle that circle like a ball Wow you
gonna draw a doggy mmm wow that looks so
good I love it
you guys I really love chalk I debated
between chalk and like a whiteboard or
something but chalk is less messy and if
you like where to draw on the walls I
could wipe it up and it's just like a
little bit of dust and it's not so much
pen so I'm pretty happy about this
choice and he's really just starting to
get into like coloring and stuff but
look at that daddy's gonna love that
have some ingredients here for dinner
and I'm gonna be making some dinner I
really wanted to make something for
Brian so even he comes home he has like
a fresh dinner
I've been all around the world every
city every place always been arrested
girl
but now there's a window change I've
never ever felt this way Oh
hi-oh show you something
did you miss me yeah I miss you bye

hold it and I'll open it
