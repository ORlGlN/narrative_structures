little morning a game session oh hi good

baby
my new amazing things we're playing
Mario Kart right now and it's about the
start don't know ah no hey nothing Oh
lately I have gone 12th place every
single time I'm terrible this game but I
think I'm trying to get better am i
doing better you doing walk there I
think you because we're splitting four
screens uh maybe really hard yeah when
you have a bigger screen and it's easier
to like play hey guys guess what I'm in
LA oh look traffic I think you guys know
that I try to limit my trips to LA as
much as possible it's so hard to get
around down here maybe it'd be different
if I if we lived here but yeah I do not
like driving down here but I actually
have a pretty important meeting that I'm
going to today had to leave the wife and
kid at home they're gonna go have fun
and I'm gonna do boring business things
and I'm checking my map at the same time
make sure I'm on the right Road because
honestly you can follow the road and end
up on a different Road it's just crazy
little alley is a way looking he said
mom come get me I'm awake they see my
Ani pants hi baby
did you have a nice nap zip so good you
ready go swimming we're gonna go
swimming
Hey yay oh hell yeah Wow yay they're off
we're headed to it we're actually it's
not like a swimming pool it's mostly
like a splash though so you can walk
around and like play in the water and
stuff so it should be nice but Bryan's
actually on his way to LA for a meeting
and so I'm hanging out with my girls my
mom and Cassie and then of course the
boy just Oliver I touched the lens OOP
we are actually going with my cousin
Jessica and her kids DJ Bailey
and he's super excited you guys look at
this gas station it looks like a
freaking spaceship that's an arco gas
station you guys what la is weird now to
bind up our Commission is on your right
gonna hold his hand look at it crazy is
like water coming out of everywhere find
all of my goodies I want go ahead go on
get you to the Mun all right I'll go
with you is it Wow you're soaked away
you barely walked out there this fun
yeah
I can't even walk out there cuz its
water falling out of everywhere wait you
think it's nice cuz this is actually a
really soft ground so it's not like
concrete
take them out there hold it hand
oh hey they take Visa okay these things
are legit all you do is swipe your card
see how much time you want that's genius
I mean who carries around coins anymore
you know so yes hi I'm in LA now I need
to find where the heck this meeting is
and I have to pee like no other because
I just drove almost two hours and I
drank a large soda let's take him to the
waters uh-huh what do you think is it
fun fresh like a real baby Dan Fiat
loves this is so funny oh man that Park
totally wara Oliver he has passed out
on the back check this out look at that
baby but it's actually a pretty cool
little part like it's really nice
because they can't obviously like hurt
themselves like drown or anything like
it's just splashing water and he can run
around and play he's really really
enjoyed it so that was fun although it's
actually quite a driving it's not like
an easy place to get to but I don't know
it was definitely fun I'd love to find
something like that a little bit closer
to our house oh I think Brian is still
in LA be there forever now he's gonna
get stuck in the traffic which is just
kind of ridiculous it'll take him hours
to get home if he doesn't leave soon so
hopefully he's doing oh yeah my arty too
late 34 o'clock so he might just be
stuck in traffic
ooh big buildings and traffic yeah I uh
I'm supposed to be over there supposed
to be over there on that Lane but I'm
right here in this Lane
so that's funny huh anyone else anyone
else chuckling uh yeah so I've got a
long drive ahead of me but hey meeting
went really really well
okay I'm gonna get over sorry hey that's
a Dodge Caliber you should drive one of
those meeting went really well I think
it's safe to say that there's going to
be some really cool things going on for
us in the next year and it's just so
cool because we're gonna be like
documenting all this I'm not I can't
really like say that's I I know it's
like annoying okay I will it's just
exciting and yeah so it's a really great
thing okay I am getting on there okay
East oh let's up here sorry I gotta go

long 20 minute 20 minutes and it will go
at Sun everything she's really mad um so
mean cast you're out we're going
shopping it's actually um fathers days

Brian's at I thought I should take this
chance and buy him something that I've
been wanting to get him for a while but
right over here um but I'm actually
we're going to be in Idaho actually
traveling on Father's Day so I'm
thinking I'm going to probably celebrate
Father's Day a little bit earlier kind
of how he did Mother's Day this year I'm
kind of excited I'm planning like a fun
little thing for her Father's Day and
I'm really bad with surprises so I'm
really hoping I can keep it a secret so
