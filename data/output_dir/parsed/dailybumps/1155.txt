pulled this shirt out says all you need

okay Jay good brush your hair
Oh most I almost did it huh we're
actually filming on a new camera today
which I'm really excited about and all
he can see himself now because there's a
little screen so he kind of enjoys this
he's like I can look at myself good way
I'm in my vanity area and I'm doing it
my makeup and we're using my new camera
or this new camera and it's really hard
not to look up there
oh I'd still need to do that so we're
using this new camera and I'm actually
pretty impressed with it it's kind of
fun to vlog and like know where you are
in the camera but like I said it's
really easy to not look at the lens and
look at the kit but the monitor
they say breakfast is the most important
meal of the day well I might have got a
little crazy this morning I made Ollie
and I a big breakfast this morning
because he has not been eating all of
his dinner lately
fact he's getting really picky about
like what he eats for lunch and what he
eats for dinner and so he didn't really
eat much last night so I made him a nice
hearty breakfast like oatmeal eggs
bananas and stuff and he ate most of it
so hopefully he's good for the day
what is he walking like that
but now I have to clean this kitchen up
because pretty much a mess captain ollie
hey there kiddo we're on your little mmm
what are you doing what are you doing
go ahead steer some more mm you're the
captain of this ship huh yeah give off a
hug
say good morning Olaf go Ollie go Ollie
go ollie is your birthday so much
anticipation huh today we are getting
rid of the tree so it's gonna open up
this room a lot more and she's gonna
organize it how she wants it so that all
he has lots of space to play on his new
toys
hugs - Olaf again
you give her hugs or you want to put him
down the slide here look at this you can
put him down the side whoo
oh he's not as graceful as you though
cuz I'm now going to use my plush that
Ellie got me it's by frat boy and I've
never even heard of the brand before
because I know nothing about makeup I'm
obsessed with it because I used to would
use like this other blush by um icing
it's the wars like I love taking it out
and trying to like put it on it is
really bad this stuff's cool good I just
dab in it a little blush to my face
because it's so white but as you guys
know I don't know much about makeup so I
just slap on some makeup hope it looks
okay and then I try not to look at it at
all throughout the day because I just
don't want to see Olly is napping right
now so this is always a great time for
me to get ready for the day and Carly
always likes to hang out in here good
morning good morning good morning I'm
doing vegan you can't just kiss me all
over you guys have to let me know if you
like seeing you do my makeup
cuz it's not something that I ever show
because I wouldn't fit I'm
self-conscious about it but I just don't
like to show me doing my makeup I don't
know just feels personal to me just for
me though I like watching people do
their makeup I also need to do my hair
holy-moly have you guys checked out this
bun that is a bun right there and voila
that's as good as it's gonna get my
bangs are just gonna sit here and swap
around and then slowly throughout the
day you'll see you know this kind of
fall it's just part of part of it just
you know how I do it anyways I'm pretty
much already and I can check my rig up
in this thing
it is really weird to get used to you
guys I'm gonna try and get not be as
awkward with it but like I honestly
because I can see myself it's like more
awkward like I feel like I'm like oh god
I shouldn't be foggy right now I do not
look good you know whereas normally you
can't see yourself you're just like
whatever it doesn't matter I can't see
myself but now you see myself so so
they're awkward and weird
I'm sorry I'm anyways I just got done
