about to ensue
all right so the whole crew and family
is outside enjoying the pool it is
extremely hot outside looks like they're
having fun
yeah like this huge group of umbrellas
they have out here keeping them shade
and as for me I'm just not feeling a
hundred percent lately so I'm trying to
take it easy
I actually am going into the studio
tomorrow so I'm trying to rest my voice
and not be too crazy I just made some
tea throat coati I know a lot you can
hide for a pretty astounded to how I
made tea yesterday I'm quite sorry I'm
very American I'm not really good at
making tea so yeah I decided to stay in
and not go hang out in the pool I'm
actually reading Harry Potter and the
cursed child the new Harry Potter book
and I am already this far just started
today so I actually might finish it
tonight and I gotta say it's really cool
all those like same emotions coming back
to me like I just remember sitting in my
bed as a kid reading Harry Potter for
the first time and starting at like 5:00
at night and then finishing the book at
like 5:00 in the morning it was the
third book I read it in one sitting
overnight and my mom was so mad at me
because she left for work she worked at
graveyard shift so she left for work at
10 o'clock at night and she told me do
not stay up reading that book all night
and I was like okay okay I won't and
then she got home it's 6 o'clock in the
morning and of course I have school that
morning and there I was reading Harry
Potter but it was just worth it there's
just it's really crazy there's a lot of
feelings and emotions that come out when
you read something like this I'm a huge
Harry Potter fan always have been so I
definitely love this it's cool getting
to relive it all and it's actually
really nice too because this is the
script for the play that Missy and I are
actually gonna go see in December so
it's cool getting to like read it and
kind of get an idea I figure I'll
probably forget a lot of stuff before
December if I finish it now so it'll
still be kind of like a surprise - yeah
cuddling up this is actually my favorite
blanket reading Harry Potter so this is
a pretty good Sunday for me well would
you look at this little cutie

pool he's about to hop in the shower
