out found a way to wear shorts today and
you can't see my little bag in that cool
Marines yes I don't want to see you back
sometimes you can see I don't know a lot
I just don't want to look at your flight
back hey he loves me but he's slightly
repulsed by me so what I did it I took
the bag and I strapped it to the side
like this so you can kind of see like
that end right there yeah but if you
lift it up it just looks like this
bloody bag slugger going to show you
guys
hashtag bruise Norbit you guys are
always asking about him and we moved him
over here just cuz I really just needed
more space over here for food and stuff
and so he's over here we feed him we
talk to him all the time but I don't
always vlog him so say hi
wish I think you should go in all his
room I don't want him in all his room
because I feel like I feel like you
should say goodnight to him at night it
he cute he's such a good little fish
you're a happy little good fishy huh
guys all
fun inside of there and he'll like dance
around yeah I know he's pretty cool fish
look who's all dressed and ready for the
day daddy's little sidekick in your car
all right door and here we go you ready
got the steering will grab the stand
well he doesn't understand driving it
Missy that's okay we opened up the
bottom so you can put his feet out but I
don't think he realizes that he can't
walk
you got the doorman out better fun right
still a so much energy all right looks
good your drink let's go bye bye yay
well guys funny story we did have a list
of things that we need to do today and
we all just piled into the car getting
ready to go but apparently the Prius is
dead she's dead rest in peace Prius no
actually the battery's just dead I'm
pretty sure the battery's ex that won't
start three nights because I do have
roadside assistance and Missy's mom is
like busy so we can't really I mean we
have like no one to help us so they're
on their way and they're gonna they're
gonna fire good old Nessie up here so we
can get some stuff done
all right guys battery car people will
be here in 25 minutes
I'll he's like you thought you guys were
doing stuff today huh nah
25 minutes oh that ain't bad is this
worth the 15 bucks I pay every month for
roadside assistance I guess so I don't
know you want some snacks
Missy he wants some snacks how do you
say no to that face
just don't okay how about a little
graham cracker that work so fasci day go
take it yeah that's the box I got it out
of take a good bite
no you have why eat that one first this
is the cycle the cycle we give him a
little snack and then he's like please
so that actually didn't take any time at
all I but he told me because it's a
Prius that he told me that we should
probably Drive it for about 30 minutes
because when you stop driving the Prius
like this like it's just sitting it's
actually not using the engine the engine
turns off so it's not charging the
battery anymore so we have to drive for
like 30 minutes not just drive like use
gas use gas we do use the engine for 30
minutes so it can charge the battery
yeah that's how we priestess priests pre
Isis are is it pre ISIS species pre sees
press that's funny
it's prolly brizzy's Jake put him on
your lap we're hanging out with CJ and
Bailey and Jessica and we're gonna let
CJ go down with oli
there you go hold on your choice that's
fine
good job yeah you have fun a thing that
makes my hair old like shock everything
they're a lot of fun when you haven't
seen them in a while actually
Bailey scissor monkey climbing up always
like I can do this just uh let me kind
of this come on dude you can't climb
this all he really wants to go I can't
do a lot cuz obviously I I just had
surgery so I'm just kind of watching him
well okay okay well Olli in Brian play
all right we're gonna do a three person
slide for all the Bailey you sit on his
lap and then Bailey you hold on to ollie
Kay
what happened he's okay he's okay babe
yeah that was a little crazy
good job Missy that was your idea well
this happened nothing is happening okay
so the guy told me as long as I Drive
for like a half hour it should be enough
time to charge the battery so we drove
for maybe 30 40 minutes and we stopped
for an hour we hung out at the park with
Missy's cousins and the car will not
start so I don't know what to do anymore
ah um Missy's calling Toyota so I think
we're gonna have to just bring the car
in there and see what they can do
fortunately this roadside assistance
thing is really paying off cuz they're
gonna come and jump us again we are now
here yeah look at this tree they got the
tree up babe yeah they got the tree up
for Christmas um so we actually dropped
the car off at Toyota so they're gonna
work on that it's gonna take a couple
hours cuz we don't have an appointment
so they drop us off at the mall we're
gonna look at all the cool lights look
at this tree Buddy Holly you know how
steering wheels work now you steer the
steering wheel turn a minimun oh yeah
he's so happy just sitting in this car
all
he loves going under that bridge now
it's so cute hi
had to get some pretzels at the mall and
Ollie is quite enjoying them aren't you
buddy
he's so fatty he's also been like
looking up these giant ornaments up here
it's crazy that they're already already
decorated for Christmas huh I like it
too a huge controversy on decorating for
Christmas is early and I am for it
yeah also my phone was completely dead
and so they have this cool little
charging station huh look at that we see
Jenna Caray she liked my photo Jed what
hmm
hopefully I can get some juice so that
the car place can call me and tell us
that our car is fine
hopefully and finally we make it home so
Toyota basically charged up our battery
they said it was really weak he said
it's also very difficult once that
little battery in the Prius that starts
the car dies to get it charged up just
because it's the sort of how Priuses are
we're finally home after a very long day
I don't think we got everything done
that we wanted to do today did we man
this little kids taking a bath he had a
long day finchy buddy here's a dinner
