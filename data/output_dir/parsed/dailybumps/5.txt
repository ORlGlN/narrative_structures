-  Look at that face.
I think he's up to something.
Finn, what happened here?
(Finn babbles)
Really?
- Yeah.
-  So then you weren't coloring
all over the white board, and then you
dragged it all the way down to the tile?
That didn't happen?

-  Good morning.
What are you doing, Ollie?
Are you thirsty?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah? (laughs)
I walked in the kitchen, and
Ollie was drinking apple juice
out of the carton in
front of the open fridge.
You gotta ask, buddy. (laughs)
You just couldn't wait
any longer, could you?
(Ollie laughs)
Are you thirsty?
- Yeah.
Good morning.
(Finn shouting)
-  Good morning, boys.
How we doing this morning?
- Good.
- Here, Ollie, put the apple
juice back and shut the fridge,
cause you're letting
all the ping pong balls
out of the fridge, okay?
(Ollie laughs)
Do you know what that means?
- What?
- When I was little,
my mom used to tell me
that the fridge and
the freezer were filled
with invisible ping pong balls,
and when you opened the
doors, they all came out
and that's basically all the
cold coming out of the fridge.
If you leave the fridge open for too long,
all the cold will come out.
- Oh.
- So now there's invisible ping pong balls
everywhere all over this
kitchen, isn't there?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, and I think
we may have spilled a couple times.
(bottle clatters on the tile)
Are you okay?
- No.
- You woke up with so much energy
and a big ol' smile on
your face, didn't you?
(Finn screams)
(upbeat music plays)
I can barely keep up with this kid.
(upbeat music)
This kid thinks he can run from me?
You think you can run from me?
Tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.
(Finn laughs)
(Bryan laughs)
Hi, Finn. Hey, do you miss Mommy?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're gonna see
her really soon, okay?
We've been doing so good.
Yesterday, I put the boys
down for naps and they did it.
They've been sleeping
all night in their bed.
Right, Ollie?
- We've been really good boys.
- Yes, you have been.
I'm really proud of you guys.
(laughs) Oh my gosh.
They seriously have so
much energy, you guys.
I don't even know what
to do with them today.
(groans) But yes, we've
been doing really well--
(Ollie shouting drowns Bryan out)
Since Missy's been gone.
I think she's gonna be home super soon,
so that's gonna be nice
because I miss her so much.
We haven't been apart for this long
in quite a while, it's been a while.
Probably the last time, she
went to Hawaii without me.
Honestly, baby somebody needs to change.
But the boys and I have been
having so much fun, huh?
Have you been having
good quality dad time?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but you miss mommy?
- Mmm-hmm.
- How much do you miss mommy?
- A lot.
- A lot?
(Bryan blows a raspberry)
(both laughing)
Yesterday, poppa took
the boys for the day,
and he found Scoop-A-Bug sorting kit.
Look at this, we've got
jars with bugs in it.
Oh, they're getting everywhere, oh no!
(mock screaming) You boys gotta sort them.
Can you sort the bugs for me?
Put them in that cup.
So we need ants in this one,
we need ladybugs in this one,
and we need grasshoppers in this one.
Where's the other one,
where's the bee one?
Ollie, did the bees get escaped?
(upbeat music)
-  Good morning,
fishies, here's breakfast.
(Finn shouts)
They're getting some goods.
Also gotta do the shrimp.
Love that stuff.
(upbeat music)
Finn, you haven't taken care
of your kitty lately, have you?
Can you pet her?
(Finn shouts)
Aww, you're so cute with your kitty.
Give her nice pets.
Finn, be gentle, okay?
There you go.
Hi, kitty.
(meowing)
Kitties are doing really good, huh?
(upbeat music)
-  Look at that face.
I think he's up to something.
Finn, what happened here?
(Finn babbles)
Really?
- Yeah.
-  So then you weren't coloring
all over the white board,
and then you dragged it
all the way down to the tile?
That didn't happen?
-  And then it was over here.
-  Oh, and over there.
Thanks for pointing that
out, Ollie. (laughs)
Finn was drawing pictures here,
and apparently his vision was
just too big for the canvas.
Um, thumbs-up this video if you think
we should put that fridge on a shirt.
(bell dings)
Okay, Finn, this is getting out of hand.
I'm officially going to take
the marker away from you.
(Ollie mumbles)
(Bryan gasps)
Oh, no.
(Finn laughs)
Excuse me a moment.
Nothing a good old scrubbing can't fix.
I think we're good.
Ollie and Finn are all dressed for bed.
You guys ready to chill out?
- Yeah.
- Um, do you guys hear that?
- Yeah.
- What is that, what's that noise?
Is someone knocking on our door?
- Yeah!
-  Should you go
answer the door, Finn?
Go, go, go, go, go!
Who is it, who is it?
(door creaks)
- Momma!
-  It's momma!
Give momma a hug, boys.
Look at him, he's like, "Are you sure?
"Is this really mommy?" (laughs)
Hi, babe.
- Hi.
-  The boys are so
excited to see mommy again, huh?
- Yeah.
- Hi, babe.
- You did so good, I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks, babe, I love you.
All right, Ollie, grab mommy's luggage.
Roll it in the house.
Roll it in.
You're gonna drop it, what are you doing?
-  There's special gifts in there.
-  Ooh, mommy's got gifts for you.
- I'm so excited!
- Yay, did you miss me?
- Yeah.
- Did you have fun with daddy, though?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Did you get to do all kinds
of fun, crazy boy stuff?
-  Mmm-hmm.
(Missy chuckles)
- Did you miss your mama?
-  Aw, he, like,
jumped into your arms.
That's so cute.
- You were such a good boy for daddy, huh?
(Finn babbling)
You want gifts?
He's like, "What's in here, momma?
"What do you got for me?"
- A baby kitten gift?
(Missy laughs)
- Um, I might have some gifts for you.
I might pull something out of here, okay?
- Okay.
(both laugh)
- All right, boys, momma brought presents
for you guys from Hawaii.
You wanna see what it is?
- Yeah!
-  Okay.
- All right, are you ready?
-  Yeah.
- Okay, here it is.
-  Ukeleles!
-  I got you the blue one, Finn.
(ukuleles strumming)
Do you know what those are?
- What?
- They're like little guitars!
- Oh.
- So now you can play like Coco, Ollie.
You wanna play "Un Poco Loco"?
(Finn babbles)
Oh, really?
Aww.
- That's "Un Poco Loco."
-  Let me see you play, Finn.
Let me see you play, Ollie.
(ukuleles strumming)
-  Can you guys dance?
-  Nice, Ollie.
- Play a song!
(laughing)
- Oh my gosh, that's
amazing, Ollie. (laughs)
-  Ooh!
-  Good job, Finn.
(Finn babbles)
- You guys, I've got
one more special gift,
and I got it at a really
cute horsie store.
Do you wanna see?
- Yeah.
- I got you guys matching cowboy belts!
-  Yay!
-  Whoa.
-  Isn't that cool?
-  What do you say, boys?
- Thank you, mommy!
- You're welcome!
This one's Finn's, this one's Ollie's.
-  Ooh, can you put
it around yourself, Finn?
(laughs)
- He's like, "Is this
how it goes?" (laughs)
Now you can be real cowboys--
-  With cowboy
belts and your boots.
- Big old cowboy belt, okay?
- Okay.
-  Isn't that cute?
- And then we can have little ropes?
(Finn babbles)
- Yeah, we have the ropes on so you can
do your lassos with the cows?
- Mmm-hmm.
- We are so happy that
mommy is back, aren't we?
- I missed them so much.
Like, I had so much fun in Hawaii,
but I missed my boys, all of them.
- We missed you, babe, but we survived.
We did it, Finn, we did it, didn't we?
- You guys did so good.
Like, I was a little
nervous because, you know,
it's hard without mom around.
Like, mom does a lot of stuff, and--
(Finn babbling drowns out Missy)
Honestly, it went way
better than I even thought.
- She had no confidence in me, you guys.
(Missy laughs)
- That's not true, not true, but yeah.
- Anyway, I hope you guys
enjoyed all the fun that I had
with Ollie and Finn while momma is gone.
What are you doing, Finn?
-  Ew.
- You're silly.
(Missy groans)
Thanks for watching this video.
If you enjoyed it, be sure
and give it a big thumbs-up.
- Thumbs-up!
- Subscribe, and we'll see you manana.
Ollie, you ready to do bye (mumbles)?
(Finn shouts)
-  Okay, go!
- Bye!
(Finn shouting)
(upbeat music)
