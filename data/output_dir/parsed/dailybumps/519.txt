then Chloe's into something innocent why
they're guys like Brian said earlier I
have been working on a few things and
I'm actually also working on planning on
Finn's birthday party his first birthday
is coming up you're gonna be one KC one
when when he's eaten some lunch right
now but yeah his birthday's coming up
and so I've been trying to plan it it's
gonna be totally different than Ollie's
because always it birthday always lands
like in summer and we usually have a
pool and so it's really easy to just do
like a pool party or whatever but it's a
little chilly outside now and I don't
think we're gonna do a pool party for
Finn so I've been trying to figure out
like what's a good birthday party and I
think I came up with a really really
good idea and I'm very excited about it
so I've been like on Etsy and Pinterest
and you know all the things planning
that party and then I'm also planning
another really special party I'm not
gonna tell you guys what it is yet but
it's like the same weekend as Finn's and
so I'm kind of trying to do two parties
at the same time but I'm so excited
about that party as well so it's been
really fun I've been doing a lot of you
know just like looking online and trying
to find exactly what I want to do but at
the same time I've been doing some fun
stuff at home
this morning I made a fun little
potpourri like a fall potpourri and I
actually got this from watching Rachel
Talbots video it's like a fall decor and
she made this yummy potpourri thing on
her stove and her the whole video is
actually really cute because it had lots
of really fun ideas that I actually
really want to do but this seems really
easy because it just included some
cloves cinnamon orange peels and apple
peels and it has literally made my
entire house just smells so YUM
all day long so I really enjoyed it it's
just been on simmer and making the house
smell really good but I've also got my
ingredients over here for later because
I'm going to be making a chicken
dumpling type of soup I'm gonna start
that here pretty soon so I'm starting to
feel like this vlog is like the one
where we never left the kitchen because
I'm back in the kitchen Brian's been
working all morning and all afternoon
actually now it's like afternoon with
his album and things like that and he's
in his office but I've just been trying
to like clean up I finally just hid the
dishes which has been a pretty much
staring at me for like three days now I
think that happens to me honestly like
dishes was something I was always a
really good at at our old house because
I had a small sink and so it constantly
had to be cleaned but now that I have
this ginormous sink I swear I find
myself like skipping nights where I
don't do dishes and then I get stinky
I'm like oh my god why did I not do
dishes
anyways I'm about to start dinner so I'm
kind of excited about it because it's a
new recipe and I like when I make new
recipes so I usually show you guys when
I make a new recipe and I found this one
on Pinterest like I usually do so I
thought maybe I try and take you along
with me I might try and get Brian to
help me do some stuff cutting veggies
and stuff so let's get started and see
how this dinner turns out I've been
you've been such a cute little happy boy
today haven't you yeah what's in your

swear this kid is in a stage I just
remember it so clearly with oli where
everything just goes in the mouth and I
also remember the stage with all because

button face he's walking around he's
being adventurous he's smiling like he's
actually picking up the food on the

playing in the playroom together which
is amazing and I gotta say the house
smells so good because Missy's been in
here doing some down-home cooking we're
making chicken and dumpling soup look at
we got at boiling on the stove with all
the veggies in the chicken what buddy
oh you got ribs you supposed to be
snacking on those before dinnertime okay
chicken and dumplings is one of those
foods that's just like such an amazing
fall dinner and it has so many good
fresh vegetables and it's like comfort
food and I've been craving it for a
while now and Missy's making it cuz
she's the best lovin and now she's
getting ready to do the dumpling
Pro right here
so I've been cooking a ton and brian has
bent in his office and he had Finn and
apparently he was blaring you that it
was really loud singing along and
dancing and working and I just looked
down good look on his face right here
this face because he real is this real
and then do another night I'll just play
music
if you just finished dinner and it
smells amazing and it looks amazing and
now she's getting all the extra stuff we
didn't use all the extra celery and
carrots and you're gonna chop it up for
two chickens yeah I won't be using this
before it goes bad so kids can eat it
chickens will love that and I will love
this look at that chicken and dumplings
I alley you want chicken and dumpling
more for me all right I've mixed all
these yummy greens we've got carrots and
celery and parsley and these are just
things that we probably won't be eating
very quickly the kids would probably eat
the carrots but I have other carrots
that are a little bit easier to prepare
for them so I'm just going to go ahead
and scatter this around for them well
sorry Dickens cause I'm the worst I'm
sorry guys
