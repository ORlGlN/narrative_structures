good morning
that was my smooth spory cereal intro
thingy son baby this is a boy he's gonna
do amazing things
good morning Oliver what are you doing
running around like a boss so happy oh
you see the picture of yourself that's
you Missy has the weirdest song stuck in
her head this morning what are you
singing right now hey where my baby
where my face at hey weirdo I got lots
of basement now you can get one too
friends do
it's Miranda sings Missy loves Miranda
sings so this is gonna be a problem huh
am I gonna have to put Karma's water
somewhere else
oh oh oh Oliver you can't do that ruin
it I know he was like putting his feet
in it like oh this is so nice this is a
little swimming pool in the house for me
I'd want to make this as much of a baby
friendly area as possible obviously it's
not completely possible um
because no matter what there's just
stuff everywhere you know okay so this
is going to be an official problem look
you guys are all decked out with a both
of July I got the red miss he's got the
blue and the white yeah we just met on
Nicholas thanks no we need to get all
his little outfit it's all packed away
so I gotta go impacted this is this
first fourth of July
his last words why he was in your belly
and actually on the fourth of July last
year do you remember you just got out of
the hospital oh yeah I was like I really
want to go for the toilet
yeah about that no last year yeah if you
go watch last year's vlog which is
always on the end slate or in the
description below and you go back like
one or two before that we were like in
the hospital because like he was going
crazy yeah sure if totally forgot about
that so tonight we're going to go watch
fireworks that's what we do every single
year and obviously always pretty little
oh yeah so I'm hoping he has a scare I
think I think about that is he gonna be
like he's gonna think they're like
explosion but we print the fireworks at
Disneyland and he loved it like he looks
true he was totally mesmerized but
here's some fun facts about the fourth
of July you guys it has the most drunk
driving accidents of any holiday really
yeah my crazy and last year 11,000
firework injuries were reported thousand
feet boy no I know like yeah I mean yeah
I know they don't do huge shows like
they do in California so we just buy our
own fireworks when I do I know that was
like the coolest thing because we were
never allowed to touch firework yeah and
so died ago and my dad was buying like
all the fireworks and we've light them
all off and now I'm totally over that
yeah like going to a nice big park and
having them do it for me but also I
remember one year in Idaho we had a
firework and we put it on top of a
ladder and it was shooting up and then
it fell down and then it schwoz shooting
at us and spinning in circles because
the momentum of the rockets were like
going everywhere and my sister got
blasted in the chest and it was crazy
yeah so we are starting to actually
decorate which I've been really wanting
to do um I feel like I've actually got
almost everything unpacked
except for decorations and like this is
all all of our stuff so I need to unpack
all those clothes and stuff like that
not just clean laundry I need to fold
and these are your boxes that need to go
really weird like how little stuff we
have it really is I know like especially
in our room we had a lot of decorations
but when you get it out here you're like
oh
I don't have that much decoration we
will be able to slowly like make it our
home kind of thing but yeah everything
is coming along really well I feel like
because I'm like a youtuber we invite
you guys in every single day so it's
like every single day I have thousands
of people in my house and so it pushes
you harder to actually get things
unpacked and get things you know how
they're supposed to look because I feel
like if I did it like have thousands of
people looking at my home every day I
would just let boxes sit here forever
and I probably would be a little bit
more relaxed about it I'd be like oh
just pack a box on box a day you know as
a youtuber I'm like all right so we need
get this house looking good
he did it home is wherever I'm with you
but yes we got this mirror we've got
some cute little pictures coming up here
and then we've got this thing right here
and then we actually decorated this
guest bathroom all those are probably
never going to use it unless we have
guests over but we used our shower
curtain from the other house we put this
in here and we put that in here so I
don't know I have like a lot of
different kinds of like bird items that
I'm definitely going to just kind of
incorporate in here which i think is
really cute china Ollie is actually Oh
mr. Oliver good morning leaving for
karmis take on bad karma
alright it is lunchtime so I'm going to
make some chicken salad sandwiches what
I did is I actually cooked chicken last
night and I had a bunch of big pieces in
that big ol bag so I fried up some after
I was cooking dinner and chopped it all
up so we have fresh chicken so I'm just
gonna mix that up with mayonnaise
somewhere ha ha and then I got these
really nice Sara Lee sourdough rolls
which are good and ship I'm going to
officially start getting all over his
room setup I could it's so hard because
I have like a such a small window when
he's awake that I could actually do his
room so I'm just gonna leave him in
