-  All right, kiddos.
What are we doing here?
- Finn, what are you gonna make?
- Duh-uh?
- Pizza?
- Duh uh?
Look at him go!
Ooh, he is taking over.
- Good job!
- He's like let me do this, Mom.
- Ready?
-  Awe.

(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)
- You ready for school Ollie?
- Yeah!
-  All right.
Taking Ollie to school this morning.
And Ollie, say Good morning!
- Good morning!
-  You ready for school buddy?
- Yeah!
- He's got his lunchbox,
he's got his share.
Today he's sharing fake snake for s.
Right? You excited?
- Yeah, I really tricked
you with that snake.
-  I remember, yeah. (laughs)
- All right buddy, you're gonna be big
and brave and not cry, right?
- Yeah.
- And you're gonna have
a good day at Preschool?
- Yeah.
- Kay. I love you.
- Love you too.
- See you soon?
- Yeah.
- Kay.
All righty. Got Ollie to school.
The parking lot was packed, but yay!
I got Ollie to school this morning.
I don't normally take Ollie to school,
which probably explains why
he's like 20 minutes late.
But, it's Preschool.
It doesn't really matter.
And there was a ton of traffic.
Like, where are all these people going?
But yes.
I got Ollie to school successfully.
He did cry and hang onto me and did not
want me to leave which was very hard
because he's been doing so good
for the entire school year.
Like halfway through the year now,
all of a sudden he's afraid
and scared and stuff.
His teacher was like,
"It's completely normal
"about this time they start doing this."
So, hopefully he has a good day.
She says he calms down
pretty fast usually.
I just dropped him off and now
I'm headed back to the house.
(fun music)
- Good morning Finny!
Are you playing with all your toys?
- Yeah.
- Are you ready to get
ready for the day, bud?
- Yeah.
- (laughs) Finn has so
much fun on the days that
Ollie ends up going to
school 'cause he just
plays by himself, happy as can be.
He has fun with his brother, but I know
he also loves the alone time.
I'm all ready for the day.
Finn's got to get ready.
And then I gotta get some chores done.
I gotta go clean out my
chicken coop, and I'm gonna
do a little bit of cooking today.
We've got friends coming
over tonight so I'm gonna
make some yummy dessert.
(child fussing)
-  Uh-oh! Did you ...
Oh, it all fell?
That's okay, you can pick it back up.
I gotta get some stuff done, and then
we're gonna have a fun day!
You gonna have a fun day today, Finn?
- No.
-  He's like no, the thing fell!
I'll help you pick it up, kay?
- Kay.
- It is time to get to
work on my chicken coop.
It is definitely a mess
in there and a little
I wouldn't say it's overdue
for a little mucking out,
'cause we do a method of where
I don't have to clean it every week.
I think I'm supposed to clean
it like every six months
to a year, but it's getting
pretty gross in there.
So I was like, I think
I'm gonna clean it out!
My Dad is coming to help
me out, and the chickens
are gonna get some play time outside.
And hopefully Luna
doesn't eat you. (laughs)
I'll keep an eye on you guys, okay?
Look at Luna.
She's just like "Oh my God." (laughs)
Those look so much fun. (laughs)
Karma doesn't care about them at all.
It's Luna who's like Mmm!
You can just see it in her eyes.
She's just like "They look like something
I wanna play with."
No Luna! Luna!
Luna do not!
That's a no! No!
Again, I would never let her
out without me watching them.
And she might- No Luna!
Luna!
She's just like "I'm so
happy right now." (laughs)
We have filled up about what is it?
Four or five of those?
And the coop is looking pretty dang good.
There's definitely like some spots,
but looks pretty clean to me.
And now, we are filling up
a much bigger trash can.
I've got a lot more chickens now,
and so they go through a lot
more food than they used to.
So I need a lot more.
But I am so happy!
It looks so clean in here!
Finn, have you been helping?
Helping or hindering, you tell me.
- Hey?
-  You watching
out for the chickens?
(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)
Look how clean it's getting!
The outside is all rinsed off.
These were like literally caked in dirt.
Now we've gotta pour-
- Dirt?
-  (laughs) Dirt?
- I think yeah, it was chicken poop.
-  Oh yeah.
A lot of it was chicken poop.
Now we gotta pour this all in there.
(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)
Ta-dah!
Look at this comfy bedding for them.
And it's so clean.
And it smells like pine.
And the chickens are
like "can we come in?"
"Are you done cleaning?"
That's our rooster.
That actually was Anna,
now I would say we'll name him Kristoff.
-  Oh, okay.
-  We'll name
him Kristoff. (laughs)
- Oh hey, boys! (laughs)
- Hey!
- I just picked up Ollie from school
and we had such a busy time, didn't we?
- Yeah!
- We're just now getting home!
We picked up these Rocket
League Mystery Balls
that have little cars in them,
but the kids don't know
which kinds they have.
- How do you open it?
-  Squeeze it.
Oh! Just like that!
Boop! What's in it?
Ooh!
Open it up! Open it up!
All right, I tore it open.
You guys pull out your cars!
- (gasps) I did!
-  Whoa!
It's green, and it's like a big truck!
That's so cool!
- Yeah!
-  Finn, what did you get?
- This!
-  Whoa! That's your car?
That is so cool.
And check this out boys.
Vroom! Can you make it go?
Whoa! Isn't that cool?
There you go! Whoa!
Now it's going fast.
(lighthearted music)
Go get it Finn! Go get it!
(screams playfully)
Can you do it?
Oh, there it goes! Yay!
- So, for today's story time
we are using the moonlite
which turns story time
into a magical experience.
It basically makes the
story book come to life.
I love the fact that
moonlite was created by a mom
for parents everywhere who
love reading to their children.
The moonlite has full HD
projection, sound effects
and more all powered by your phone.
This helps make story time
engaging, playful, and memorable.
There's always time for story time,
no matter how busy our lives get,
we always make time to
read to our children.
(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)
All right Ollie, are you ready
to make a book come to life?
- Yeah!
All right.
We've just gotta turn out the light, okay?
(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)
So learn more about the
moonlite and to get yours,
you can click the link
down in the description
and thank you so much to Spin Master
for sponsoring this video.
All right bud, it's time for nap time.
- Okay.
- I love you.
- I love you.
-  Pizza night!
- We're having a pizza night
with some of our friends.
Brooke brought over these
amazing little crusts
for the kids, most likely us because
we're like putting this
all together and the kids
are just running around crazy. (laughs)
We have all these amazing ingredients.
We've got bacon, canadian
bacon, cilantro, peppers,
chicken, tons of cheese, and sauces.
And we are going to make
personalized pizzas tonight.
Hey! What's up kiddos!
- Are you vlogging us,
are you vlogging us?
-  I'm vlogging you! (laughs)
- Yay!
-  What are you guys doing?
Are you playing Hot Wheels?
-  Yeah!
-  You playing with cars Ollie?
(Ollie screams playfully)
-  Ollie is so excited to have
some friends over to play.
This is Joelle and Jude.
You guys okay to play with
Ollie and Finn tonight?
-  Yep.
-  I have a pile of them!
-  Can you keep them company?
-  Yep.
-  You know what
you guys should do?
- Huh?
-  You should teach
them a choreographed dance.
You up for the challenge? (laughs)
- I do not know what you're talking about.
-  Oh, okay. (laughs)
Are you guys gonna design pizzas?
-  Yes.
-  You excited
to design a pizza, dude?
- Yeah!
- Are we allowed to say how old we are?
-  Sure, how old are you?
- Six.
-  And how old are you, dude?
- Seven.
-  Six and seven!
Have fun guys!
Okay, so we are doing
a pizza art challenge.
Kay, I am going to attempt to make
a Christmas tree on the pizza.
A lot of people do the
pancake art challenge,
but I'm gonna try it pizza style, okay?
-  Yeah!
- So first you need some red sauce.
That's a lot.
-  (laughs) That was
a lot of sauce. (laughs)
- That was a lot of red sauce.
Apologies.
(lighthearted music)
Next, I'm going for
cheese, and you know what?
The cheese I'm not going to
incorporate into the design,
I'm just gonna have it all over.
-  That sounds like a good idea.
- A nice base of cheese.
-  Yep. Yum!
- I'm going to use orange bell pepper
for the stump of my Christmas tree.
-  Mmm! There you go!
- Kay? And then I have cilantro
which is quite possibly
the best pizza ingredient in the world!
Let me know down below
in the comments also
what is your favorite pizza ingredient?
-  This is looking pretty good!
- I'm gonna shape that kind
of in a Christmas tree.
But I have lots of other greens.
-  Oh yeah.
- So we've got arugula, which is also
really good on pizza.
Shout out to Brooke for
bringing the arugula.
(Missy laughs)
You can't have a pizza
without some decor, so
we've got little red pieces of bell pepper
just kind of scattered throughout.
And now you've got like, ornaments!
What do you think, you guys?
Christmas tree pizza.
- That is so cute!
I love it!
- And I'm gonna have a nice
yellow glowing star on top.
What do you think Ollie,
is that cool? (laughs)
-  He's like "It looks
cool, but I wouldn't eat it."
Huh, would you ever eat that Ollie?
What do you think Jude?
-  Okay Jude, what do you think?
- It's yummy, but my
least favorite ingredient.
-  Yeah. Like it looks cool,
but you don't want to eat it.
- Yeah, but it looks really cool.
- It's the coolest thing I've
ever seen in my whole life.

You guys, I am a pizza artist master.

It's really cool.
The coolest pizza I've ever seen.

I honestly didn't plan that.
- Edible leaves.
-  All right.
Kids table is hoppin'
with some pizza making.
What are you making?

happy face bacon pizza.
Like the eyes would be pepperoni,
the nose would be pepperoni,
and the happy face would be bacon.

How about you?
What are you making?
