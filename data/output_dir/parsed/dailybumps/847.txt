Kharma oh did you just make a noise
what'd he do what do you think of that
little kid over there he's like yeah
he's alright so this morning I am on a
mission I am on a mission to find all of
all these guns and get rid of them
there's a gun this is probably a gun he
definitely uses this as a gun and it's
broken so another gun and there you have
it guys all these gun collection going
bye-bye just to clarify this is not us
taking any kind of stance on gun control
or anything it's just that we don't let
only watch anything violent see anything
violent the guns that he has are things
he turns into guns or like water guns
when it was summertime cuz it was hot
out and it was fun to play with but
they've kind of just been becoming a
problem or we see that they're gonna
become a problem he points them at
people he makes noises and it's probably
partially our fault because we do like
to play with him we just want our kid to
be violent or like if he's playing at
someone else's house point a gun at
their kid and go bang bang you know what
I mean and I know he's gonna see it
somewhere sooner or later but yeah this
morning Missy and I were just like okay
we're kind of over the whole gun thing
now so we're gonna get rid of the guns
all right
they're put away in the garage I didn't
throw them away I just put them away
Missy actually is hiding Olly up in the
room too because he's been asking for
his gun gun gun so I searched his room
like I said - this is just like a
preventative thing we don't want it to
become a problem I'm sure - once they're
all gone and he completely forgets about
it he won't even mention it or even know
so
it's not like he really cares that much
hit the Kate what's going on in here hi
ollie are you wearing a playlist light
bracelet yes you're stealing all my
things he goes through her vanity and
like takes makeup brushes and jewelry
and stuff What's Up kiddo good morning
big guy how's it going you're gonna meet
your baby cousin today that should be
fun huh
I actually took a shower today with him
in this rock and play and he was right
outside the shower and he was so good
the entire time and then when I got out
of the shower and turned it off he
started fussy um so I turned the water
back on and it totally calmed him down I
think that white noise from the shower
really helps this is funny it's like the
things you do to keep your newborn happy
I open that door Karma's locked in there
open it let him out there you go hi
Karma were you locked in the nursery all
right we are off to sin these two week
appointment
oh he's he'll be too eat smart Oh but
and I'm really excited because I won't
really want to know what he weighs I
feel like he's gained a lot I don't know
10 pounds I would say I'm so scary he's
just he's doing sold and we have like
the best kid you guys look at this I've
got sleeping baby here and our other
sleeping baby here like how easy is that
we've taken two kids to the doctors and
they're gonna both sleep through it all
right we are getting Finley ready to go
weigh him Ali is still asleep in the
stroller so that's pretty good
eleven and a half ounces 12 you're
getting so big buddy hmm he's just a
handful ounces shy 10 pounds my gosh oh
yeah we just like skipped the whole
seven pounds and eight pounds like yeah
like we watched him gain those pounds

overachiever but if you go ahead and get
rid of that yeah that'd be great
