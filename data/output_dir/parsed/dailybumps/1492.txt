you peed all over us last night he's
like uh yeah and it was awesome
yep those are our sheets and like Brian
said Oliver peed everywhere last night
somehow got out of his diaper and I was
feeding it was like four o'clock in the
morning I was feeding him and he just
oh he's mean the things that we like
you're telling on me all said I just
felt a stream just like going down my
side I was like are you kidding me
and I jump out of bed and it was pee all
over me all over our bed and I'm like
Brian get up get up like huh I'm like
right get up Oliver just peed I need
your help
I need to change his diaper and he
changes outfit and you change the sheets
and you take everything he would not get
up
I was so pissed so then he is rolled
over and he rolled like on top of pee
whatever he's showering right it is such
a nice day out you guys got the screen
door open and the door open so we can
let in some of that
amazing air in here hey what's wrong
are you dr. Becky you dropped your binky
kid I got do everything for this kid you
know just can't do anything himself so
this morning I'm gonna have some oatmeal
apples and cinnamon oatmeal
I don't eat oatmeal a lot but it's good
in the morning because it sort of fills
up your belly and go with it
chocolate I know it's really exciting
huh it's really exciting I'm doing
Oliver it's okay kid you may be closer
daddy dry eyes Rico ha hey I know I'm
only downstairs but I wanted to see you
it's difficult when we're apart if the
same floor at all times
it really is you look really cute what
are you doing this angles working for
you
it's like down low it's like the worst
angle ever anyways I was actually
wanting to tell you
did you see Austin's new video oh yeah
the internet shock quiz yeah yeah if you
guys don't know there's this video of
Austin and he was on this little YouTube
game show called the Internet shock quiz
and they asked you questions and if you
get it wrong they shocked you well you
guys might see me in a future episode
cuz the guy emailed me I tell him an
email back saying I'm down by the way
you talk so loud that I can hear you on
here and I can hear you downstairs
I'm obnoxious is a beautiful day today
and so I actually get to hang my diapers
and yes that does mean I started my
diapers yesterday I didn't finish
laundry is just not my friend basically
the reason I can do this because I have
disposables and so when they're in there
like it's like this temptation like oh
you can just use a disposable and I'll
just finish laundry tomorrow gonna
actually hang them with the hair among
them in quite a while this is just been
kind of like chilly outside it hasn't
been the kind of weather that I want to
go hang my clothes outside but today
it's like 85 degrees so heck yeah so
hopefully the stain will be gone because
we're gonna put them outside I am
getting ready to run around and do some
errands with my mom and Brian's putting
baby I could bag
he's really Terry's gonna take a nap
feeding him right now this little guy is
sleeping and Missy is out shopping with
her mom but I am just sitting on our
back end for like all our vlogs and
stuff right I'm like really kind of like
upset it's kind of so it's kind of
stupid but I'm just like I'm mad at
myself I guess I counted probably four
times and I was like no it's right it's
on the day 356
stay 356 like I have it right and
somewhere I messed up we're off by day
it's one day so day 356 which was
yesterday is actually day 355 which
actually gives me an extra day to do our
one-year video so that's kind of cool
but I'm just so like haha I was I just
it's one of those moments where you sort
of just have to like be like okay I was
wrong take a step back you know what I
mean and that's definitely what I'm
doing some people were telling us we
were like way off like we had already
passed our year mark and I was like no
that's I know we haven't done that for
sure but now I have to go through and
change in the titles the day number on
every single one and it's like way too
much work and I'm just so overwhelmed
and like ah you know what I mean like I
know it's not that big of a deal Missy's
like things that I get mad at are not
things that are fixable and this is
something that's fixable so it looks
like our last day of year one will be
the second day of our trip he's moving
around moving around should I slip him
should I flip him I always messed up
when I do this I did it you guys I did
it and I didn't wake him up
proof he always sleeps so much better
like that so hopefully that will give
some longevity to his nap so me my mom
are out we're at Hobby Lobby we're
looking for little things like decorate
like that looks pretty cool but I do not
have the baby which is a little bit
weird for me but Brian was putting in
asleep and he just sent me a picture of
him sleeping so the store is like hey
fish
this store is like the worst store ever
basically everything in the store is so
cute and like you just want to start
decorating your entire house and they
just make it so easy you know like they
make stuff that looks super unique even
though it's not eating because you're
buying it in a store but it's just crazy
like we basically just want to decorate
everything this is so cute you guys oh
my god I like I almost started crying I
saw it all because two people fell in
love which is a song right mom

have no idea the country song I think by
Tim McGraw

hard to choose because she's like I
don't like a lot of things she doesn't
like right I every single meal is a
struggle for me guys hey food I hate
food I hate food periods
I don't I'm not a foodie and if there's
any way that someone can hypnotize me to
like much tools is that a thing is it
possible can I do it they hate times
people - not smoking yeah if they can
hypnotize people to stop smoking and not
like smoking and why can't they
hypnotize me - like vegetables and we
know you're hypnotizable because one
time at the fair that person hypnotized
you yeah and you like squawk like a
chicken
remember so leave in the comments below
if I can get hypnotized to like
vegetables and if you ever you've ever
been hypnotized yes and if you've ever
been hypnotized Network and what funny
thing I am skeptical about hypnotism I
guess but yeah but yeah what funny
things did you do when you were
hypnotized grabbing some lunch I got a
burrito from the Freebirds Missy had to
get a burger from five guys she went to
a different place and met me at free
words that's how bad her food is and you
literally just asked me what it beans
taste like so she just took a bite of it
and you said you would actually get this
without the means though feel like
you're getting better

like I'm so hungry yeah I know it is why
he's wearing long sleeve and it's warm
he's always jealous cuz he doesn't get
to eat like amazing food he just needs
some breast milk and so he's probably
really bored with that too
