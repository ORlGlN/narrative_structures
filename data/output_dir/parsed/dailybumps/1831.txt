Oh
having a boy named good morning guys I'm
trying to run out of the house this

space where I put them they're usually
right here next to my socks are my
slippers but they're not so now I'm free
okay they're loads of self do not put
your shoes in the clothes hamper because
you will spider forever looking for them
through my eyes you guys actually woke
up and there was like little um scabs of
like blood underneath do you see that
red spot those red spots under my eyes
that's where it was like bleeding and
now it's like all red and bumpy think I
- yep there's a little little bit right
there - they still hurt so bad whoo I
hope you guys enjoyed that
did you guys hear that was my Azmi
static my stomach just went oh so I'm
not even kidding this happens at least
like a dozen times a day but I'm
watching friends on the Apple TV and the
remote always slips in between the couch
okay
karma okay I need to move this wheel of
the Apple TV but the remote is literally
like so thin and so it's so easy to lose
what else is down our boy any goodies
goodies what are you looking at there's
nothing telling her calm all right go
ahead
karma get you head up come on get up I'm
sorry boy naked you so I just filmed a
little update for my other channel Bryan
Lanning TV cuz a lot of people have been
asking and tweeting me about when
they're gonna see a new video and the
truth is I've just been really busy but
I put a new video up just sort of
explaining that and explaining what's in
the works I'm really hoping we can do a
new video soon because they're so funny
I have like a lot of ideas and Missy's
calling me hang on hello what's up okay
cool come home
hurry no I'm just I'm vlogging and okay
I'm just gonna tell them I have to go
hang on okay guys I have to go missing
ones talk to me
come on where's your harness demolition
harness yeah I guess I came home and I
had planned to just run in the house and
grab something so I left my car on and
then I started cooking myself lunch and
I was talking to my mom and it was on
for like over half hour get used to it
you're wearing it come here you're
wearing the harness okay I can maybe I
can pick him up fur he's like no don't
do that please
guess whoever died guess where we're
going with this we're going oh yeah oh
yeah freak out oh oh there's another
door there's no there we go go so
excited tada down boy oh down
closing its closing careful careful
careful in karma are real
we're all headed kids dogs that's
including Brian I'm hearing wellness
friends here we are all headed to die
Park but I did want to rather just go
with you in Carmel
you'll rather me not go that'd be great
there's an accident everyone wants to
know what car kind of dog karma is and
it's a hard question to answer when I
first got him he was a someone thing
they gave it to me as a Australian
Shepherd / Blue Heeler but I kind of got
rid of the blue heeler for some reason
and just now I just he has so many
tendencies of the border collie and he
actually looks a lot more like a border
collie than an Australian Shepherd so I
actually really do believe that he is
half australian efford and half Border
Collie he is both all the
characteristics of both of those
obviously that means mud but he's much
better than a mud
he's like the smartest dog I think he
but technically he's a month no he's not
okay so he's his own breed okay he's
very smart like the border collies are
like um he knows names and words and he
can memorize like all the names of his
toys they all have names and we tell him
to go get his snowman or his crocodile
or whatever he like noses so he has
those characteristics and obviously he
likes to herd dogs at dog parks
he likes to crouch down so that's
another one so anyways he's not showing
a shepherd / border collie he's a mutt
got a comma bull rat the park and we got
a surprise for karma some ba ll o.o lol
lol o ll o o and blue oh we got some
balloons for it some friends who are
gonna meet us down here to hike Emma

we used hers and I got I grabbed a new
one because I'm like super stoked to see
this movie and we got free movie tickets
and it was like way cheaper we get to
see it in 3d it was really only 11:15 it
was 11:50 for a 3d movie which even
California is like 16 dollars wait
that's the total alone oh no baby was
$23 guess what today is guys it's
Tuesday but in California that
translates to Taco Tuesday and you can
normally find like super super cheap
tacos there's this place here that they
do 99-cent tacos and they're a movie so
I'm gonna go in and grab some I feel so
stupid
who knows it's not Tuesday it's
Wednesday I was so excited about Taco
Tuesday and it's Wednesday hey Missy was
today do you know what today is
oh yeah oh yeah it's not really Tuesday
that's so funny you didn't know I wasn't
even thinking this is the funniest thing
ever
I'm like I had my heart set on 99-cent
tacos I cannot fathom paying a dollar
seventy-five so I'm cooking some chicken
I'm actually doing like a Mediterranean
wrap with some hummus
and some whole-wheat tortillas that'll
be really good but someone yesterday
told me they were I told him I was
cooking an olive oil and they're like oh
just so you know olive oil is 120
calories for one tablespoon because I
said it zero cow actually I don't cook
with like pure olive oil I wouldn't do
that
I actually just cook with the cooking
spray olive oil so it's like olive oil
flavor cooking spray which is zero
calorie so I basically just put like a
little bit of this looking at in a
little bit of Italian dressing and then
i season the chicken up real good too
boom boom boom this is what it looks
like
put a little hummus on there romaine
chicken that was cooked in Italian
dressing on a whole-wheat wrap oh it
looks so good mmm it's really calm and
the cool thing is it's only 322 calories
per serving that's everything that's put
in it so we are filming Missy's bump day
but I just I had to show you this you
guys our baby is the size of a sweet
potato look at this like that is inside
you right now we're like this or like
this or something it's so weird like a
sweet potato so huge it's probably guys
he's probably not as heavy as the sweet
potato right this is pretty heck yeah
that's probably like a pound yeah how
many ounces makes a pound 16 okay I can
I think the babies technically I think
it says like six ounces really yes he's
almost a half a pound Wow cut done
filming ah my bump date and karma what
are you doing he's acting like super
weird right now I don't know what his
problem is he got a bath he did first
Leeson whatever he oh it's okay give you
another one don't worry
he got a bath with vinegar and
everything cuz he stunk so bad for some
reason the park we go to makes him stink
and he comes home and he doesn't do
anything other than run run around he
just Hey his hair was like all like
tousled oh yeah it's just drying weird
cuz they probably didn't like blow it's
not weird anymore though yeah you think
he smelled good okay anyways if you
haven't watched my bump date then this
doesn't apply to you but if you did
you're thinking what the heck did she
want to tell you I still haven't figured
out but I I really don't know I think it
had something to do with I don't know I
really don't know I've been sitting here
trying to figure it out for like ever
it's really really bothering me moving
on now we are ready to do our dare and
again today was a hard one to pick it's
from Cristina Seville Oh kid there does
to open a banana without using our hands
so I guess we'll have to use like our
mouths or no yeah I don't know we're
gonna I guess we'll get creative just be
like a fun one like not like a torturous
one that I did yesterday yeah and the
one that I did the day before that with
trying to eat the nasty foods but not
that bad you're just a baby I have no
idea how to even hey yeah I'm in the
middle of a dare not a good time I'm
trying to do a dare from YouTube it's
not that big of a deal Missy mr. banana
wants to talk to you
she's busy I'm sorry we have lives we
can't hang out with you anymore do you
remember that show bananas in pyjamas
yeah yes I did it was like a bunch of
bananas
Wi-Fi on pajamas I was like the coolest
person who wins does the person who eats
the last part of the good news like it's
been tired now what person eats the
entire banana first wins
wait so we have to UM peel it and eat it
yes it's a lot of Amanda though like I
can't oh yeah those are the calories no
like I mean that's very filling like I
had to start out up and state dinner I
mean I think that's I think that's the
rules we your might have a disadvantage
is minds like fatter I don't know don't
worry about okay so you can't use that
later as an excuse as to why you didn't
win cuz I'm gonna win I definitely what
you said an excuse 33000 you can't help
me ah it's really not hey honey
