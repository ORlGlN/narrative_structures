together and it's like a really big
tradition that we do so last year when I
rewrote a letter for this year I was
very diligent in making sure that I
didn't lose it it says 2015 Christmas

back it says don't lose this it's up to

Merry Christmas 2015 hi my favorite time
of the year once again I just love being
together I can't even predict what this
year is going to look like all I know is
that us being together means more than
anything that we even don't do or see at
the end of the day the only thing that
really matters is family you guys
sometimes our days and years can get so
bottled together with so many other
things but the fact that we all get to
spend so much time together is really
good
what is priceless I wouldn't have it any
other way even crazier to think there
may be another one there or on the way
our family is growing and so is our love
yeah hey Holly I'm reading our Christmas
letter

like all the others how could it not be
