there and kind of moves or something
makes color you know okay there's one
right there I know he's pooping he's
pooping like it's like drips down the
fence and then it gathers onto the
ground it's pretty gross so Brian did so
good it looks so good out there and I'm
literally in my babies you ain't as
strong and that's what I've chosen to
wear today because I just want to hang
out by the pool just wanna be in the Sun
I feel like Florida made me want now I
just want to go back to Florida because
that's where I seem to be in the Sun but
I have a pool in my backyard so I'm

bought yesterday for ollie was a pirate
castle look at this thing it I know yeah
I know so it's got a slide swords shield

squirting water everywhere we've got
three swords

water so you don't pop it he's like I
need in this castle and you get in Oh

literally just blew up the little
inflatable toy and then it was nap time
and he was like what but he I should've
been done really easily he crawled right
into his bed got under his covers and
cuddled up and he is out so he'll
probably be out for a little probably
like an hour and a half or so which is
nice isn't I can go like go outside and
swim and relax without him for a little
bit and then when he comes I can play
with him and it'll just help with a
really relaxing day but I am actually
gonna clean up his his playroom right
now cuz it's kind of a disaster and I
gotta clean it every once well so that
he can tear it apart again
