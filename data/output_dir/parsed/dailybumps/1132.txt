we taught them something bad we are a we
are leaving Paris
goodbye Perry goodbye it when leaving
Paris and we're starting year three
welcome to year three you guys I cannot
believe we're starting everybody
together here I cannot I didn't even
think we would get to the first year but
now it's just part of our lives it's
just like well why would you be soft you
know the car is hot it is packed even
more than it was on the way back I feel
like when you're on the way here because
whenever you're headed home just like
throw it in just leave on the way here
it was like everything is all neatly
packed and nicely and stuff so we're
actually starving so we're headed to
breakfast so we're gonna do one that one
last look around Vegas which is pretty
awesome that's one place we get to
explore Caesar's Palace
yeah yep maybe when we come you and I
will stay there yeah for sure I
definitely think that me and Brian are
gonna make a couple more trips out here
without all just so much to do like
indoor skydiving and then the zipline
and I would love there's this thing
called voodoo zipline you literally
zipline between buildings and that is
something I would love to
we taught him something bad silly face
silly face
what's why we do it what to do it
we are a hash house and go go get some
breakfast I'm really excited
places featured on man versus food
a lot of people are like taking pictures
got a nice little week plan for the
table and Ollie is making funny faces
while watching Mickey I literally had to
lift up my camera so that you guys could
see this painting
this is a brown sugar banana pancake got
ham and eggs
biscuits and gravy Ollie got french
toast yeah that's good yeah now let's
get two men french toast
probably the biggest pancake I've ever
seen in my life
this is my hand for comparison alright
so we just had a delicious breakfast at
Hash House a Go Go and I'm gonna be
honest I definitely am going to suggest
it if you go to Vegas you have to go
there especially for the breakfast it
was so so so good but it also took about
two hours of our time so it's like a
long wait and then waiting for a food
and all that so we're a little off
schedule I kind of want to be home like
around three or four and it's two
o'clock but that's okay it's pretty
quick drive not too bad and I'm really
happy because Ollie is fast asleep see
if I can show you look at him he's
snoring back there he is
so
so that'll be nice he'll probably sleep
the whole Drive which is really really
cool but now we are in literally dead of
of Nevada we're no longer in Vegas
it is just all desert no buildings
nothing nice Brian also I'm not wearing
any pants I have I took my pants off and
I'm wearing um Brian's jacket as my
pants because always spilled my drink
all over me at the restaurant and I was
like really upset about it it was kind
of a disaster as we were leaving uh
Paulie had a blowout and we had no
outfit and I forgot to bring wipes and
it was really he fell and Mike his lips
will bleeding okay it was great it was a
little bit like I was like should we be
getting in a car right now to drive home
because I feel like we have bad luck
like following us right now but um it's
good

cool

like Brian's voice comes on and they're
like hey what's this song and they turns
out the many forms of music they learn
the words and then they like can't wait

to call my own and you come singing my
favorite song or you take my head
