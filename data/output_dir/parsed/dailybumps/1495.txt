karma hi Ali is just helping me respond
to some comments what do you think we
should say to this one glad that Oliver
is finally able to sleep better by silly
mando 2008 what do you want to say me
too
there you go silly man of 2008 that
answer came from Oliver ISO warm and
soft knee just smells so good I just
don't want to give them up hmm stop
hugging me and today we are going to
practice our new schedule huh we
actually um kind of got a good little
schedule going for the past couple days
um with his nap time and stuff and I'm
feeling really good about it so it's
actually almost time for his nap
it looks really tired I do if you look
at I mean like I'm so tired guys I need
to take a nap okay he's not grouchy yet
which is good I don't like it when he
gets like overly tired and gets like
grouchy but he definitely get in there
as he tried to get me to peel an orange
for her but I do not know how to tell an
orange well I'm not very good at it at
least I guess it's not that hard or I
normally peel them for you yeah so I
guess I got to peel my own orange but I
love doing it cuz then it makes your
hands small orangie and yummy having
don't let go cuz something they're like
super tart oh it's like misting orange
juice all over here I know
smells good though yeah so my hands look
oh look you guys I'm any cereal this
never happened
seriously never happened usually because
I just don't get up early enough for
cereal and I was just craving cereal
this morning this is raisin bran brunch
so it's like I eat cereal that old many
but it's crunch so it's new and hip and
fun right that makes me cool alright
time to give your bed time I am so happy
that I figured out his nap time schedule
it was just like really stressful there
for a little bit and I think that it's
interesting because I think a lot of
moms it's not almost every mom I have
struggle with you know the nap time and
the
um sleep time and I'm just glad that we
were able to find something I know that
it's music because we do actually have
the sound um he listens to like her but
that's not enough he has had music on
also all the things I wish I caught on
camera yeah I missed a little bit there
Brian just uh just a smidge let's try
again okay what is wrong with me I can't
do anything pick on me put this milk up
for me thank you appreciate it
old nappy that's good thank you
you got the most of it neat coming out
most of it he's such a good little mop
oh that was funny so the thing about
cereal is which I actually forgot if you
don't eat it fast enough it gets so
soggy and maybe that's just what Raisin
Bran but I hate soggy cereal it is not
fun
karma loves me right now except food Oh
Southern California you are so beautiful
it is so nice oh god I love our state I
feel so bad cuz so many people all of
the world are like in a blizzard right
now like snowed in like my aunt
Wisconsin it was literally like negative
20 degrees there the other day and I was
like oh I'm so sorry it's like 70 here
you know I'm actually wearing shorts
today it's probably a little colder than
it is when I should be wearing shorts I
mean when I was in Idaho and it was like
40 degrees I'd be wearing shorts leaving
shorts so I'd be pretending like it was
summer weather you know what I mean I'm
sleepy he's getting so good at it it's
just awesome it's getting easier and
easier to put him down hey oh hey zombie
I heard you're back ahead one year Danny
Vox yeah I know 365 days isn't that
awesome people are only watching for me
you know that right so pretty much you
wouldn't be able to do without me now
come on I don't think they're watching
just for you
the accent beautiful I don't think
people are watching just for zombie in
fact some people get very mad about
something
some people hate zombie and they let me
know every single time he's in one of
the videos in the comments and I'm just
like I can't just stop showing him he's
my friend he talks to me so I'm gonna
talk to him back you know what I mean
like you wouldn't would you turn your
back on one of your friends because one
of your other friends doesn't like them

it on today I don't know if it's gonna
fit him it might fit him in my but I
might fit me better but I'm still having
a hard time coping with him sleeping in
