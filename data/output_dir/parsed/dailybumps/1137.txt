care
mango look at my hair right now what is
going on what is this what is this right
here so yeah I was watching The Today
Show this morning and it was interesting
because they showed a clip from Fifty
Shades of Grey the movie and I'm
actually really excited to see the movie
comes out on Valentine's Day and I
actually did listen to like the first
five hours of the audiobook and I have
to say the book is so cheesy I don't
understand it's like it's really nothing
special to me in the book I do kind of
like the storyline I think it's pretty
much so movie should be a lot of fun
Missy's really excited to Valentine's
Day is right before anything for
Cambodia so I'm gonna get to see it with
her before I leave all right how much
Amazon it's really annoying
ha that Kel is different I'm really used
to spinach well we have to mix it up and
the carrot is actually very refreshing
