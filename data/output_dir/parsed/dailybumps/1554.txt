thinking just a staple Ben Jenna I
didn't go banana smoothie
spinach sounds good hey hey you drew it
on your hands are you - of in your hands
you feelin monkey so I'm headed out
early this morning and I'm goin writing
I am so excited and I'm here already
which means that it sucks when I go out
myself cuz I gotta get on the car I got
to open the gate and then I gotta drive
in and I got to get out of my car and
then I have to close the gate enough to
drive the rest van so it's really
annoying all right so I got my
ingredients for this smoothing what
what's up good why what's up
be happy all right so I got my three
very simple ingredients I'm gonna throw
them in my nutribullet and see what's up
dude chill Dutchess is doing a bit of
runnin
are you ready and there you have it guys
boom mango banana smoothie with spinach
of course you always got to add a little
bit of splash of orange juice and lemon
juice just to sort of mask the spinach
but there's a whole lot of it there's
like four cups of spinach in here you
guys that's a good breakfast if you ask
me this little guy did not like smoothie
time so now he's enjoying some time it
looks like it's going really fast but
that's the setting that he loves you
know he's out that did this almost all
saddled up huh almost ready huh she's
been so good so far I just gave her a
treat so this one wants a trick too huh
I do Wyatt you want to treat - you got a
treat you're a really good girl all
right guys I'm back on done on the horse
I did it come on come on let's go
Duchess
come on hang on we're off so we're just
like in a little arena and we're just
kind of practicing I definitely it's
been a while since I've been on a horse
so we're still trying to figure it out
and it's going good I'm really enjoying
it
we're just trying to get to know each
other hon Dutchess she's talking to
Roxie over there Roxy and her keep
talkin they miss each other you missed
in Roxie girl well I hope you guys are
okay because I kind of just dropped you
but I think you're okay
okay yep looks good all right we're
gonna get back on the horse all right
I'm going to see if I can set you up
somewhere so we can show you a little
bit of writing hopefully you don't fall
you see that
okay
yeah I'm gonna grab you I gotcha
fuzzy and see and still trying to get
the hang of it get getting the rains
down it's this is definitely I think a
different way that I've used the rain so
I'm kind of have to practice and
remember how to do it again but I'm
getting there and with a little bit of
practice maybe I'll be better soon
I'm Duchess I'm the problem huh look
there's my shadow
hey yo Brian D yes use now listen I just
wanna thank you for putting me up on
this here counter okay
you see I spent so long in the middle of
a clogging you know what that's like
odd animals everywhere in my face on my
legs even had a stuffed crag that
conveniently placed on my Cottontail you
can understand how that can't be too
comfy so yeah thank you
well you're you're welcome swag PS dig
in the name yo do we move to a different
arena a bigger one see if we can pick up
some speed
the only problem is there's no way for
me to hang you guys up on here and I
really can't get speed up if I and like
vlog at the same time I'm not that good
yet so I'm trying to think of somewhere
I can actually put you guys I'm coming
so much fun I couldn't not hang you guys
up there
so you're just gonna have to do this but
yeah this is a lot of she's still
talking to Roxy she really like Roxy and
her keep like communicating and it's
really funny but it's also kind of sad
they're just buddies and they don't like
to be separated but Dutchess is a really
really good horse
she's very very obedient and definitely
just trying to figure each other out and
figure out how she's changing how I'm
trained and all that and fun saddled her
and we had a good time riding huh yep I
think I'm all done
headed back took her away I was awful no
I enjoyed myself a lot definitely
getting back into the groove of things
check it out you guys baby Ollie was
being quite sad so I had to feed him
which I really hate doing but mommy is
filthy from riding and she's not quite
home yet so it's probably gonna be a
while so I'm feeding him a bottle and I
positioned the blanket i wattle it up
under there so now I have a free hand to
vlog and do other things are you happier
now that you got a bottle reunited and
it feels so good right they've been
talking to her all day gave her a nice
good bath and now I'm gonna put her back
in her stall I just want to go to soon
she's probably gonna roll around the
dirt cuz she's still a little wet so
kind of giving her a little bit of time
and she did it I just came back and she
rolled in dirt thanks Duchess car you're
filthy
you're filthy I'm absolutely starving so
I'm getting
wings and things I really did work up a
really good up appetite and playing my
little baby cakes
I miss the baby with me when he saw me
he gave me a big ol smile so you think
you miss me come on dude
this may look like a regular burrito but
it's not it's not babe it's a case
Cerrito okay interesting
well actually it's like on the secret
menu but they when you first do it they
put in all your stuff and then they
grill it so the outside gets like super
crunchy see that it's really good so
it's not good to babe yeah when you're
not Brad we haven't had that bread in a
long time least we obsessive that huh
oh look about you guys Oh
so all I officially does not want to be
in that thing he wants to be looking at
us so I stuck him in here wrapped him in
it they're a little loose I think if we
tighten them he probably won't be so
wobbly and he looks so tiny but he's
happy that's what that's what matters
I don't think we can like push him
around it hmm I don't know I mean if it
was tighter if he was if it was tighter
I think it would be okay just little
stroller like I don't want to send a
card anymore what are you doing hey the
weights like
