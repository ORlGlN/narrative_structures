- Good morning guys and happy Friday!
- Morning happy Friday!
- Morning
- Good Morning Finn.
Hello guys, I am making
waffles this morning.
Look how beautiful they look.
(Finn whining)
Yup I have your breakfast
all ready, you wanna eat?
- Yeah!
- Alright, we got waffles and syrup with
some apples and strawberries.
- Dad do you remember you's
was a beautiful unicorn?
That was silly.
(laughs)
- I was a beautiful unicorn?
When?
- It was Halloween.
- Ollie may be giving away secrets
right now and I apologize for that.
Spoiler alert.
Silly boy.
Hi, good morning, I love you.
I got you breakfast, okay?
I also have bacon in the oven,
Finn you want some bacon?
Finn likes bacon, huh,
Finn likes everything.
- Dada.
-  You're welcome.
You're welcome. You're welcome.
- Wait, where's the syrup?
-  The syrup is hiding
but it's in there, see?
- Oh.
-  All your little
waffle pieces are pre-dipped,
that's pretty nice of me.
- Yeah.
-  You like it Finn?
- Yeah.
- I like it.
-  Good.
(upbeat music)
- Good morning guys.
Say good morning.
- Good morning!
- Bryan was so nice to make
us breakfast this morning and
I was able to get ready and
now me and Finn are going
somewhere really special.
What are we doing?
(baby mumbles)
- Say we're going to music class.
Kelsi and Corbin have been
doing music class with June
for a long time, almost since
she was like very very little.
And so they found one
here and they invited us
to come too and see how Finn likes it.
So me and Finn get to do a little
mommy and me class together.
So we're gonna go see how he
enjoys it and go have some fun.
That sound good?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Finn what do you think
of music class so far?
Is it fun?
-  Make sure your
Mommy and Daddy get one too.
Are you teaching Finn
how to do music class?
- She's like, "Oh yeah, I'm a pro".
(laughs)
-  Are you gonna go get one?
Aww.
There you go, good job.
(soft music)
Finn did you like the class?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- What did you think of that Finn?
Did you like that?
Do you wanna do that again?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- That was actually very cool.
I really wasn't sure how
Finn was going to respond or
if it was something that we
would want to continue doing,
but I really really loved
just like the atmosphere,
I loved that...
It took him like a few songs to understand
what was going on, but he was really
starting to get it and he loved...
I just loved watching him
interact with the other kids
and learning how to participate
and I think this is a
really cool thing to do
before he's going into school.
So I'm really really excited about it.
I think we're gonna actually go for it
and do this with Kelsey and Corbin,
which is kinda fun
because he gets to do it
with June cause he adores June.
I will say, I was thinking
about taking Ollie,
but I definitely don't
think Ollie would enjoy it.
He seems a little bit
too old for this class.
Although he's still in the
age range, I just think that
he would think this is like a baby class.
Cause there was a lot of little kids and
it's just a lot of more baby type songs
so I don't think he
would've enjoyed it as much.
So I'm glad that I didn't
take him, but I think Finn's
gonna love it and he did love it today,
but I think as he gets more
comfortable and understands
what's going on I think he's
going to start to really love it.
So that was really fun,
I'm really excited that
Kelsey and Corbin invited us to it.
So yeah now I'm gonna go
see what Bryan's up to.
- It's new iPhone day.
I've been waiting by my
office window all day
where I can see the gate and
I can see the UPS man come in
and he came and he was like,
"Are you excited for the new iPhone?"
And I was like, "Yes, please."
So we got our new iPhones,
Missy got an Apple watch,
which I'm very excited about
because she's been working
out a lot and she can use it
to find her phone, which she loses a lot.
So this is the old iPhone,
this is the new one.
You're not really gonna see a
difference, but look at this,
it has wireless charging
which is super cool.
I'm gonna be putting a bunch
of these things all around the
house so people that have
the new iPhone they can
just set it there and
charge their phones up.
I think that's pretty cool.
And as always, make sure that
you guys are following me
on Instagram because I
did a story of unboxing
the whole iPhone, so you can
go check it out right now.
Well hey there mister
Finnigan, how was music class?
(baby mumbles)
- You went with Mama?
Nice.
Now he's having a little snack, cereal,
and I am whipping up a BLT.
We had some bacon left over
from this morning's breakfast
and Missy just went and
got me lettuce and tomatoes
so that I can have a BLT, so thanks babe.
- You're welcome.
- You boys are so cute, you know that?
- Yeah, Mama is.
-  Really?
- You is beautiful.
- Thank you guys.
- Aww, Mama is beautiful, huh?
- Yeah.
Look at our boys,
they're cuddling watching
"Beauty and the Beast".
- I was just cuddling with them.
- They're so cute. (chuckles)
The thing is, is Ollie just
wants to cuddle with Finn and
Finn just wants to like
hit him and like....
(laughs)
- I know Finns in a...
- Take everything from him.
- Finn's in a fun stage right now.
- Yeah.
Finn is coming up on
terrible twos you guys.
And I remember when this
happened with Ollie,
because it was like on his
birthday something switched
in his head and he changed and I was like,
"What happened?"
It's terrible twos, they're a real thing.
-  Mama, mama.
- We got through it pretty
easily with Ollie, but I think
Finn's gonna be different because
he's got an older brother.
-  Totally.
(Finn whimpering)
-  It's okay Finn.
This is probably the cutest time out ever.
Put your nose in the
corner, you're in trouble.
(Finn whimpering)
Finn, put your nose in the corner.
Finn has been doing really
good to take time outs
when he's being a little
much or not listening,
you tell him to put his nose in a corner
and he just relaxes, huh?
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Can I have a hug?
It's okay.
You need to share with Ollie, okay?
It's so funny because at this point,
Ollie is not the trouble
maker, he's just trying to
play and have fun and
Finn is just at that stage
where he wants everything Ollie has.
(Ollie screaming at Finn)
Just run from him, make him chase you.
Get it Finn, get it.
It's okay Finn, come here.
Life is so hard, isn't it?
Yes, life is so hard.
(Finn whimpering)
I know, it's okay.
You antagonize him, don't
antagonize him Ollie.
You have to love your brother,
can you give him a hug?
Hey Ollie how about you give him hug
and a toy to play with, okay?
- Okay.
-  Go find a toy for him
to play with, okay? (laughs)
Finn's like, "I don't want
a toy, I want your toy."
You guys might be wondering
why we have a bucket
on a plate with some chips in it.
Well, I have everything
ready to make something
super awesome and cheesy
tonight cause I'm having
a guy's poker night with
a couple of buddies.
I'm gonna show you guys later,
I'm really excited about this
but right now Missy is making
one of my all time favorite
treats and that is Pumpkin
pasties from Harry Potter.
They're basically little pumpkin hand pies
- Yeah.
-  And it's so cool.
We make these every year, we
always use Rosanna Pansino's
recipe because it's the best, basically.
- Yeah it's so fun...
- Guys, I love you.
-  Aw, you love them?
- Mm-hm.
-  Well that's so nice of you.
(upbeat music)
-  Finn's helping
out, that seemed to...
It's helped his mood a little.
Mix it up dude.
There you go.
Finn wants to use that, he's like,
"This works way better."
Oh geez, oh he turned it on, okay.
(laughs)
- Let's let Finn try it for a sec.
-  Go ahead, mix it up dude.
- Use the mixer.
-  Look at you
dude, you're doing it.
You really think this is gonna end well?
- Probably not.
Good job.
-  He prefers the
old fashion way of mixing.
- He got it, I'll get, I'll get it, no.
-  Ahh.
- I'll get it.
- Making messes.
Smells so good, I am so excited
for pumpkin pasties babe.
It looks just like Rose too.
You trying to eat it?
- You wanna try it and see if it's good?
Is it good?
Alright, my pumpkin pie mixture's all done
and now I've gotta
transfer em over to these
pie dough disks, which
will fold over and make
them into little pies.
I'm excited, I think
they're gonna turn out good.
(upbeat music)
-  Pumpkin pasties are in the oven.
So excited, thank you babe.
- You're welcome.
- And we are definitely
having some iPhone 8
activation drama at this point.
I have my phone all set up, it's right now
running an update for my Apple watch.
Missy's I just can't seem to get working.
It keeps saying that I
have to approve the phone
but I already approved the
phone from her old phone.
I think what's happening
is a lot of people are
accessing all the servers
at the same time because
everyone just got their
new iPhones in the mail
so it's kind of like
congesting everything.
It did take awhile for Missy's phone
to activate with AT&T.
I must have done mine early
enough that I beat the rush.
Bro do you even know
what's about to happen.
- These ingredients look
amazing and I'm really
excited for what's about to happen.
-  We're just gonna
put it all in a bucket,
and then we're gonna put it in the oven,
and then we're gonna
flip it upside down and
make a nacho cheese cake.
- What?
-  Are you ready dude?
- I don't believe you.
-  It's gonna happen.
-  Alright, here we go.
- We're gonna do a layer of
chips, I got carne asada.
-  Okay.
- Then we're gonna take some beans,
black beans that I just whipped up.
I feel like I'm preparing a
meal for like a farm animal.
-  Yeah.
- So then you do a layer of
black beans, then your cheeses.
-  I feel like
you're Guy Fieri right now,
you need like the blonde hair.
- Cheese.
-  Cheese, queso.
- Queso what?
- Queso, I'm in the
middle of filming a video.
(laughs)
(upbeat music)
- Boom.
Okay so I just did like
five layers of this and I'm
freaking out because I don't
know if it's gonna work.
-  That is a
full bucket of nachos.
- It's full of nachos,
beans, cheese, meat.
-  Oh my gosh.
- We put it in the over for 15 minutes.
-  Boom, that just happened.
- Bro.
-  Hopefully it comes out.
- Alright I just pulled
out the bucket of nachos
and all the guys are
here because we're doing
guys poker night on Sunday.
-  Yay!
- And we're gonna flip this now and see...
-  Flip it.
- See if it works dude.
Someone gonna spot me?
- Where are you flipping
it at, right here?
- I feel like on the balance beam...
- Three, two, one.
-  You're good.
-  He did it.
- You ready?
-  Okay.
Oh no.
Oh wait, is it center, should I center it?
Is it all coming out?
Is it all coming out?
-  It's spilling out the edges.
- Hang on, hang on.
-  Good job man.
- It's a Pinterest, Instagram fail.
-  I feel like it's not even melted.
- It didn't melt all the way.
-  It's medium rare,
it's just medium rare.
- Let's put it back in.
- Put it back in the bucket.
-  Put it back in
the bucket, redo, cut.
- I present the nacho cake bucket.
-  Wow.
- Ladies and gentlemen.
-  I'm impressed.
- Gentleman actually.
-  The presentation
man, that's crazy.
-  That's some excellent garnishing.
- Look at that.
-  Who's gonna
take the first bite?
- This is gonna be good.
-  I think you should.
How is it?
- It's really good.
-  Yeah?
- It's baked too.
-  Nice.
- I'll get some plates.
-  Dig in.
