we're going to the pantry finding stuff
for dinner tonight and there's a mobster
growing a hot pantry whoever you are the
flavor wanna be inside
just one around University
turn your dog coming all just again
I love the way you to say good morning
it's so cute good morning buddy how are
you planning your paw patrol pajamas yep
it is a beautiful day out here Sun is
creeping up from the heat as well so we
have this little water table that the
kids are playing and dabbling in I'm
going to show you guys - I'm not sure if
you can completely see but this summer
we have been having a bee problem
multiple stinging they've been swarming
around the pool it's been kind of crazy
I was eating breakfast this morning and
I looked out and there's this tree
that's being swarmed by bees I'm pretty
sure they all live it now this is the
tree I don't know if you guys will be
able to see the bees yeah oh maybe yeah
there's definitely a hive in there I'm
going to find it yeah look you can see
them flying everywhere in front of this
other tree crazy so I have called a
professional and hopefully he will be
able to take care of it what are you
doing tell me rock it back and forth
hang on that's fun I don't know if
that's necessarily supposed to be
swinging that much but all right Missy
is convinced that they're not beasts oh
no I think do you see them are they
better safe oh I thought there were bees
they're like swarming like bees they are
swarming like bees there's one so fast
yeah yeah it definitely looks like
something like a little butterfly I
guess we would huh okay that one yeah I
see it okay they're not be so tired of
all the bees okay I'm just trying to
find them so that we can get rid of them
properly
there you go
i won there you go Wow a cookie and a
popsicle lucky boys it is a very warm
day today and so we are sitting out
we're going to probably have some snacks
yep
mama got a special double one and go in
the pool
we actually have their private swim
lessons today again and yeah luck for
the pool enjoy the weather
got some fresh flowers in today these
are going to be bright gold lilies and
they all came clothes like that and
check this out you guys they're already
starting to open up check that out
they've been in the water for maybe an
hour studied how is the pool it's so
good you're checking out my lilies
they're going to be so cool and colorful
I love you buddy
so I called in a professional B guy and
we had find any hives you guys I'm so
bummed they've been such a menace all
summer and then one time I have a
professional here can't even find any we
went all down there looking all the way
around here we didn't see anywhere so
we're thinking that the bees may be on a
different property and coming over at
our everything is blooming though huh
what do you see well oh there's a snail
chillin on the side hey you want to give
a pretty flower for mama this looks nice
Polly wants to cut some flowers from

our property kind of thing good we're
going to the pantry finding stuff for
dinner tonight and there's a mobster
growing our pantry and I did not know
what I was touching at first it was like
all over what does the pink really
growing like a plant in our house Wow
maybe you should put this in one of your
like bouquets or something hidden is
down for a nap and I still have not put
any makeup on so I'm thinking maybe I'll
just go for a no makeup day we'll see
I'm trying to be a little quiet room
next door I am going through all these
books right now he's got quite a few
books books in here they she actually
just doesn't really read as much and we
got a ton of books for Ali's birthday
this is just a few of them that I
thought would be fun for bedtime because
we have a ton that are actually in his
playroom that we can read but I thought
I would just kind of like switch them
out get rid of some that he doesn't read
anymore
and put in some new ones all right so I
made a little pile that I want to put it
in syndrome first of all this is in
Ali's room and this is the little boy
who lost his name and it's Finley's name
so that's cozy and since one is a really
cute one I think Finlay I think gonna
like this one and this one always got
double of how I was born in here and one
for Finn's room piece is not really into
the dinosaur book this is a Christmas
book that I don't feel like we need in
here right now this book we never liked
then I didn't want to show you oh wait
how to catch Santa we can definitely put
that little way too there is one
Christmas book however that I can never
get rid of and that is how the Grinch
Stole Christmas trust me I would rather
not read this book all year round but
Ollie loves this book and wants to read
it every single night and I love the
story love it don't get me wrong but
like I hate it so long so long so what I
end up doing is I like to grab multiple
pages at a time so I don't have to read
the whole story every single night
because he doesn't want to just read a
couple pages
I'm like listen sweetie call pages and
then tomorrow night we'll read a couple
more no he went through the whole thing
so I try and skip as much as possible
but we cannot put that one away because
he loves it and I actually do love that
he loves it too and here's a couple
books that I have not read but I've
heard that they are amazing and books
that we definitely need to have so
someone got these for us for Ali's
birthday and I am very excited to read
them something to put them in here as
well all right here is his new dinosaur
or his new toy so lots of dinosaur books
but his new bookshelf and I'm really
happy with some of these books I'm very
excited to read them we have not read
many of them that are on here so this
will make it a lot more fun at bedtime
for me especially so I can finally read
some book that I haven't read before or
at least read a thousand times I also
have some books I'm going to put
probably by his nightstand over there
that are a little more like chapter
books and a little bit longer to read
and so we'll probably do like a little
bit of this super even yeah a little bit
of these every like night that way we
can get used to just reading like a
chapter at a time before bed so put
these next to your bed okay
