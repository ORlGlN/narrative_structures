bringing the death we in the bath baby
LS into death take a bath I get a lot of
questions how I get his fat so bubbly
which sometimes it's more bubbly than it
is right now and so I thought I'd show
you guys I honestly just use his current
shampoo my body wash that I use on him
which is honest shampoo
I used to use um Shea Moisture which I
think this does actually give more
bubbles than this does but I promise
just I don't really buy like a special
bubble bath or anything like that I just
get in his using a shampoo and stuff we
had dinner and he did not eat one drop
of it so we're in the bath and we're
actually shoveling oatmeal into his face
how about oh haha I really just wanted
to eat something before bed and he
didn't really eat a lot of us lunch me

he's so strange right it helps us period
like one day he'll be like great in the
next day I swear he's like he doesn't
need food it's very weird you guys want
to see what this is
look at that you know how he when he was
at the park he was running and I saw his
head he fell and I saw his face hit like
the curb it was like concrete and I saw
I was like oh no and he literally just
got up and the strike started running I
was like oh must not have actually hit
