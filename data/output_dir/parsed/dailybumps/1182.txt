fine I made a decision today we need to
have another kid
that Arthur
good morning guys today is the big day
I'm heading to San Diego with my mom and
we are going to be getting my ultrasound
basically we're going to figure out if
everything is a-okay and it may be a
couple months will maybe be getting
pregnant or some of them are around so
yeah I think they just doing a special
type of ultrasound that puts like fluid
into my uterus and kind of like blows it
up almost to look like a small pregnancy
he just looks at it all to see that it's
like there's no septum there's no like
scar tissue or anything else that's in
there and it should just look like a
very pretty beautiful uterus that has no
issues so we're hoping for that and as
long as that happens we'll be good if
for any reason he's like you know what I
see more septum there is a possibility
that he could be like all right you were
going to need another another surgery no
that's very unlikely because after the
surgery he was like I got it all I feel
very good we'll double check in a few
weeks so I think your biggest
is going to be a scar tissue yeah that's
true that's probably the only thing that
he might need to go in and our tissue
out that he's going to see something no
I predict sure yeah I think so too
yeah so if there is scar tissue that
would kind of suck I've been taking all
the these different medications for over
a month to kind of basically prevent
that but yeah we're headed to San Diego
which is a pretty long drive for us but
it's worth it because I just love these
doctors in this hospital baby it's cold
outside
I is it cold outside Olli oh what's that
here you want your milk there you go
this puppy always turns on come over
here vlog with Daddy oh it is cold
outside you guys it's been like stormy
rainy and cold all day so Olli and I
have just been hanging out bundled on
the couch he's been playing with his
toys but I thought that was like the
most perfect shirt because it actually
is cold outside it's a very rainy day in
San Diego we had actually a lot of rain
head in but we are on time which is good
we're not late we are starving I've had
no food I don't know how long I'm going
to make it but you don't have a choice
stuff here we go that is everything that
will be used for my procedure and I am
NOT looking forward to it
it all looks really scary mom that
little like um cup it's got all that so
I can show you it okay there's my finger
that cup right there that's not all the
same thing that's going to be put in my
uterus and then that little brown cup
that's like the dye was a hormone the
stuff that clean
oh I annoyed as the iodine it's not fun
this parts not gonna be pretty
poor karma is all in casing here oh no
here come here come on you wanna get in
your crate you want to get in your crate
it's okay there you go
Karma's been loving his crate you guys
Karma's even got a nice big old bone in
there - Oh Olly won't bother you in here
okay
no Olly we don't bother karma in there
okay this is like an all-day battle you
guys with karma and Olly because all he
just wants to run around and karma gets
all but her and starts crying and
doesn't want to be he doesn't want you
chasing him kid I'm sorry
we need to have another baby and fast so
that all they can play with someone huh
Oh Olly no Emma's in there trying to
relax okay
mmm mmm what's outside look outside it's
a wet yeah I even had to wear slippers
you guys like we're getting cold I dug
these out from like behind the closet I
haven't worn these in forever
well since probably last year okay there
you go we're done we did it I'm gonna
show you the pictures when I get in the
car here's the big news so here's kind
of what happened I went to my
appointment and right before the doctor
came in I started to remember the last
time I had this ultrasound done and it
was extremely painful and so I started
like panicking because you said I want
to leave I want to leave go anyone do
this anymore
I remember so what they do is they have
to actually sort of dilate your surface
just a tiny bit so they can get this
little tube up there and they have to
pump saline into your uterus and then
they perform the ultrasound part where
they have to like stick it through your
cervix not fun not pretty not cool
really really not not nice so anyways
doctor came in and
he's kind of a rough doctor I don't have
to deal with him anymore but he's not a
very like compassionate doctor I guess
you could say he just says I know
business yeah he just wants to get this
done be done and be done you know like
whatever but I just needed someone to
like slow down tell me what the heck
they're doing where they doing down
there what you doing down there get it
all in there I was squeezing my mom's
hand I was not happy and then it all
falls out so he has to do it all over
again not fun no matter what this older
sham is for I always like right before
he talks like I'm having panic well I
was literally like darting my eyes
between his eyes in the screen and
trying to figure out if he had bad news
or good news or what like do you do you
think I guess yeah yeah I do too because
he's like not saying any bad I'm just
like trying to read it I'm trying to
read and I'm trying to stare at the
screen and I'm like what is that what's
that yeah and all of a sudden this like
dog for me what if it's all messed up
what if he totally messed it up what if
I can't have any more children anymore
so that is what my ears looks like right
now there is no septum I used to have
good culture this used to have a septum
that went all the way down to this
cervix so it was straight down now I do
not have that says I have a completely
normal uterus everyone has like a little
bit of like a SEP dump but it's like
less than a centimeter that's what's
left and that's how close you can get
before you start to like mess with the
actual uterus there's no problems with
day I shouldn't have any problems having
children at
this hmm
you never know when the tickle attack is
gonna happen yeah like a big thing that
pretty cool you like it when I eat
tickles you do you think the burger
burger burger pickle season
I would say his stomach is his most
ticklish area and I just take a little
squeeze and shake it and go I think a
little bit of a go he laughs and he
loves it all and I've just been hanging

important appointment done today so it
