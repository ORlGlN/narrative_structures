(upbeat music)
- Good morning.
-  Good morning,
how you boys doin'?
- We're at Disney World.
-  We're at Disney World?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
♫ Wherever you are
♫ That's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a life
and that soft sunshine
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and sighed
♫ This is home
♫ Just runnin' around,
you never looked so cute
♫ Huggin' you tight
givin' all I could to you
♫ I am home
♫ Home's right there, you're with me
-  Look at your shirt, who's on it?
- That's Mickey Mouse.
- Mickey Mouse, you got
Mickey Mouse too, huh?
Good morning guys.
We're up bright and early this morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
We're gonna go meet our
friends for breakfast
and then we are gonna head
into the park all day!
You ready?
- Yeah, and I gonna
dress up like a captain.
-  Like a captain?
- Yeah.
- Yes, Ollie may be
dressing up like a pirate.
We'll see what happens.
- Ow.
- Ow, you slept so good.
(chuckles)
(upbeat music)
And we have made it
into Walt Disney World,
and I swear walking in I had goosebumps,
and they're pretty excited too.
Look at that castle you guys!
-  Isn't that great?
- I just wanna go up in it.
- There we go, we can go up n it.
Look at this, it's incredible.
I feel like I should know where everything
is because I've been to
Disney Land so many times,
but I have no idea where I am.
It's completely different.
Bro, you see that castle?
(upbeat music)
-  Watch out
for the camel they spit.
- The camel's actually spitting. (laughs)
Ollie, we're gonna ride a magic carpet!
Fin has the biggest smile
on his face right now.
- Does he really?
- Yeah.
- Awe.
(upbeat music)
-  Hey Ollie.
- What?
-  Watch out for that camel.
It spits. (laughing)
Is he ready?
- Hey, say hi daddy.
- What, we're flying Ollie!
Let's get this thing higher.
Whoa! (chuckles)
This is a great ride to start with
because we can see the
whole Adventure Land.
- What do you think of that, Fin?
- Let's go down!
Whoa!
- Now up.
- Now up. (laughing)
(upbeat music)
Whoa, what's it doin'?
- I don't know.
- Are we okay?
- Yeah.
- He's like kind of
freaked out. (chuckles)
Are you excited?
- All right we're goin'
down for the landin'.
(suspenseful music)
All right, we just got out
of Pirates Of The Caribbean,
and Ollie is all dressed
up like a little pirate!
Look at you.
Show me your best pirate move.
(chuckles) He's a dancing
pirate apparently.
Arrg matey! (laughing)
- I'm gonna get all your treasure!
- I'm gonna take your treasure! (chuckles)
He plays the role quite well.
All right, you wanna go ride more rides?
It was really cool seeing
Pirates Of The Caribbean here
and how different it, it's
just cool seeing all the rides
that they do have in California
and how they're different
and then of course being on all
the new rides is really fun.
We're having a blast.
(upbeat fiddle music)
All right, we are about to ride--
- We are getting wet.
- Splash Mountain.
I told Carl I'm a little
worried about my hair,
he said, "Me too."
- I'm worried about my shoes.
-  His shoes. (chuckles)
- I've got the tri-colors on.
This is nerve-racking.
- I rarely get to ride Splash Mountain.
Missy didn't want to 'cause
she didn't even wanna get wet.
I was like, no, I don't mind gettin' wet.
It's hot out here in Florida.
(upbeat banjo music)
And the journey begins.
Woo, oh, I literally thought
we were gonna go under water for a second.
(upbeat banjo music)
That's gonna be us in like 15 seconds!
(upbeat banjo music)
All right, we are getting
closer and closer.
It's a short one, it's a short one.
This is a tester.
This is a tester!
(screaming)
(laughter)
- Oh!
I'm wet.
(upbeat banjo music)
No fishin', and then he
says, hey, no fishing!
 No fishin', no fishin'!
(upbeat banjo music)
- We're entering the big one now.
(upbeat banjo music)
It's really goin' up.
It's really goin' up there.
(screaming)
Oh my gosh!
(screaming)
(water splashing)
Oh my gosh! (laughing)
(camera shutter snapping)
They said you were gonna get a little wet!
- We went under the water!
- These got a little bit wet!
- Sorry Bryan.
- Oh my gosh.
(laughing)
My hair is definitely messed up--
- That was exciting.
- For the rest of the day.
(cheering)
So we are leaving Frontier Land
and entering Liberty Square.
And this is a part that we
don't have in California.
We have New Orleans Square,
they have Liberty Square,
and if you look over here,
this is actually really cool.
They have Hall Of Presidents over there,
13 flags surrounding this
replica of The Liberty Bell.
Check that out.
That's cool.
13 lanterns hang from that
tree across from there,
and in the Hall Of Presidents,
they have an actual, official
seal for the president.
They only have three places in the world
where they have that, two in D.C.
and one in Walt Disney World.
How cool is that?
(upbeat music)
Ollie, guess what?
- What?
-  We're goin'
on the Haunted Mansion.
You're not afraid of that, are you?
- Yeah, I am.
-  No you're not.
- Yeah, I am!
- I don't know why he's saying that.
He is not afraid to go on Haunted Mansion.
This Small World is a
lot different from ours.
- Yeah.
- We have a huge clock
where the Small World ride is in.
This one's right in
Fantasy Land, right here.
I'm sure it is just as annoying, though.
- Is this (gibberish)?
-  Nope, this
is It's A Small World.
Look at, we're inside the clock.
The clock is inside.
That's cool.
(upbeat music)
- He chooses Gage over everyone.
-  Ollie, what's down there?
- Treasure and stinks.
-  Treasure and stinks. (chuckles)
(upbeat music)
(upbeat music)
- It says, goodbye
Finley, Missy, and Bryan.
Ollie's not wearing his Magic Band.
(laughing)
It's funny 'cause a lot of the rides
use the Magic Band,
and they will grab it and know you're in--
- We don't even scan it.
It just scans it itself.
- Like when we were in Haunted Mansion
it said, and with the ghost
who was in our carriage said--
- Back to California.
- Back to California, and we were like,
that's a weird coincidence,
and then theirs said, back to Utah.
I was like, what?
- To which, I was like, oh okay.
- And then our guide said
they scan our Magic Band
and get all our information
while we're on the ride
to like customize it like that.
It's really cool.
(upbeat music)
Ollie, we're getting on a pirate ship.
- Yeah.
-  And we're
gonna go see Peter Pan!
- Yeah, and I'm Captain Hook.
-  You're gonna be Captain Hook?
- Yes. (background
noise drowns out speech)
-  Yeah, Fin is
enjoying Disney World a lot.
This is a much-needed nap
right now though. (chuckles)
(mellow music)
Hi Wendy.
-  And off we go!
-  Ollie, look at,
there's Tinker Bell and Nana.
(upbeat music)
- Ah, ah!
(upbeat music)
-  We are in line for
the Seven Dwarf's Mine Train.
- I'm tall enough!
-  What Ollie?
- I'm tall enough!
-  You can ride the train?
- Yeah!
-  This is so, it's
a roller coaster, you ready?
- Yeah!
-  All right, let's go do it.
(upbeat music) (screaming)
- Oh my goodness.
Are you excited?
Are you scared?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)
(upbeat music)
(screaming)
(upbeat music)
(camera shutter snapping)
(camera shutter snapping)
(upbeat music)
(camera shutter snapping)
(camera shutter snapping)
- Oh my gosh!
(upbeat music)
(screaming)
(upbeat music)
(screaming)
How was that?
- Pretty good.
- It was pretty good?
- Yeah.
- Were you scared?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (chuckles)
Do you wanna do it again?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
(upbeat music)
- Okay Seven Dwarf's
Mine Train was so good
that we are now riding it again.
Ollie, we're gonna ride
it a second time, okay?
You hear somethin'?
(bird calling)
(laughing)
Whoa, did that scare you?
(upbeat music)
(camera shutter snapping)
(upbeat music)
(camera shutter snapping)
So being in Fantasy Land, there are lots
of princesses around here.
Come over here, bud.
How are you?
(background noise drowns out speech)
- Ollie came in and immediately, hi Ariel.
Awe, look at her tail.
(soft music)
So I think Ollie has a crush on Ariel.
- What?
(laughing)
-  He loved that.
- He ran in, and he was like, hi Ariel.
-  Just casually
hanging out with a mermaid.
- You loved her, huh?
- Yeah, that was pretty cool.
When I found out they had Ariel here
as a mermaid, I was like,
we need to meet her.
That needs to happen.
Hey, Ollie, see that tower up there?
- Yeah.
-  That is Rapunzel's tower.
- Yeah.
- From Tangled.
- Yeah.
-  Isn't that cool?
- Yeah.
- She's up there waitin' for her prince.
Look at that, that's
Rapunzel's castle right there,
and I just realized too
we're surrounded by lanterns.
(royal music)
We have found ourselves in a castle.
(royal music)
Glass slipper, it's amazing! (chuckles)
Come on Fin!
Ollie, who is that?
It's Rapunzel?
You gonna give her a big hug?
I'm gonna go with you.
He's embarrassed. (chuckles)
Hi Rapunzel.
(royal music)
It's Tiana!
Ollie literally just watched
this movie the other day.
(royal music)
Ollie, you got really shy, didn't you?
It's just a princess,
you don't have to be shy.
All right, we are now
riding Winnie The Pooh,
which is Fin's favorite Disney movie.
He loves watching Winnie The Pooh.
And look at all the honey.
Look at all the honey on his mailbox.
Isn't that cool?
(upbeat music)
Fin, what did you think of
the Winnie The Pooh ride?
He was looking all over the place.
He absolutely loved it.
Oh, it has a blanket inside?
-  I don't know.
-  Somethin'.
That's a big Winnie The Pooh though, huh?
- Yeah, it's so big.
-  Ew, you got a sucker?
- Yeah, can I have one these?
- We'll have one during the parade, okay?
(upbeat music)
So our guide has instructed us, Ollie,
that we are now about to meet the boss.
Mickey himself.
Are you ready for this?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go do it.
(upbeat music)
- Hi there, come on in.
- Hi Mickey.
Give him a big hug?
- Awe.
- He had a question for you.
Ollie, you wanna ask him?
- (gibberish)
- He was wondering if you
could do a magic trick.
(laughter)
- Well, I tried to do one last night,
and well, we found out the
sprinklers work. (laughing)
I think I gotta practice a lot more.
But you know what, this morning,
I got to ride on a great big train!
- Whoa!
- Hey, how about we pretend
that we're choo choo trains?
Follow me.
- Follow Mickey.
- Chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-chug-a, choo choo!
Chug-a-chug-ah-chug-a-chug-a, choo choo!
Chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-chug-a, choo choo!
-  Here we go, buddy.
- Chug-a-chug-a, choo choo!
(laughing) That was fun.
You all made great choo choo trains.
(upbeat music)
- You gonna give kisses?
- Good bye now.
- Muuwhaa. (giggles)
- Awe, I love you too.
(upbeat music)
- That was crazy.
I was not expecting Mickey
to actually be talking
and interacting with them.
Like that was, that was
such a priceless moment.
That was so cool.
Okay, Ollie has to pick out
a new sucker for the parade
because Fin stole his.
Whoa, that's a lot of suckers.
Let's just get one, k?
- Okay.
(upbeat inspirational music)
- Here comes Peter Pan!
(upbeat inspirational music)
They're on hover boards under there guys.
(upbeat inspirational music)
I'm freaking out about this
dragon right now, you guys.
It's breathing fire!
- Move that dragon!
-  You gotta be
careful about that dragon.
Look at that.
That is so cool.
- Fire!
(upbeat inspirational music)
- What just happened, what
came out of his mouth?
- Fire.
- Fire?
- Yeah!
- You should of saw his face.
He's was like, it breathes fire?
(upbeat inspirational music)
-  How cool is that, Ollie?
- Strange.
- I think that's definitely
one of the coolest
parades we've seen, huh?
All right you guys, we
just had an eight-hour day
at Disney, and we did it
all thanks to this guy.
- Just the Magic Kingdom,
just the Magic Kingdom.
- We did the whole Magic Kingdom--
- They enjoyed it.
- Thanks to our amazing guide, Dave.
We had an absolute blast,
and we have a couple
of cool days coming up.
Tomorrow we're doin' Epcot and Hollywood.
I can't wait for Ollie
to be able to see it all,
so that's all for today's vlog.
Holy cow, we did so much, Missy.
- I'm exhausted.
- (chuckles) She's exhausted,
we're all exhausted.
- If I'm exhausted, my kids are like done.
- We're gonna go back to
the hotel and hit the bed
or the water or something.
But thank you guys for watching.
Hope you enjoyed today's video.
Give it a thumbs up,
and we will see you manana.
I'll have Ollie do the bye boop.
Hey Ollie, say bye boop.
- Bye boop.
(upbeat music)
