but I need to wash all his clothes I
have to pick out his official going home
outfit cuz you don't know we could be
leaving any day now to have this baby I
mean I really hope it's not any now but
you just you never know it could happen
I want to start getting my hospital bag
and just everything in order so I don't
have to stress about those things okay
look at how these two PS oh you're going
to me what you want I did did you really
I did hello everyone so today is the
first day of the official first day of
my maternity leave and so it's time to
get busy I've just got some regular
chores I got to do first though making
the bed of course laundry which is
always like my life good morning guys
you are never gonna believe what
happened this morning you're gonna freak
out oh my gosh I'm so excited I cannot
believe it you guys are gonna freak
there was actually a cinnamon roll left
for me to have for breakfast very nice
Carmen's eaten breakfast homeboy if you
guys are wondering why we use this weird
shaped bowl it's because karma eats his
food super fast so we put his food in
there
eat slower because it's harder to eat
out of put your Judah burger home my
sister and her friends last night made
s'mores and me and Brandon Gidney so
we're gonna make some right now I can't
possibly eat this oh I don't want to
hear it it was really good really
sticking my money
I was just like missing the other day I
hate what I talk with food in my mouth
on camera guys are wondering why I'm
sitting at the table at my computer
because I have to work from home today
well normally I do work from home on
Monday but I have to put in like a full
full office hours today because fourth
of July is coming up and
she's super excited for that so we want
the day off but we have baby today and
this is actually kind of a sad day
because this is the last day that we'll
be babysitting CJ and Bailey
since Jessica's schedule has kind of
changed and stuff now they hat are able
to actually watch the kids themselves
yeah kind of worked it out so that we
didn't have to watch them so it's kind
of sad though because we love having
Bailey and CJ over huh visiting a Brian
haha okay let's get our drink on yeah
huh that good bottle she's already
zoning out it's not so hot today but
it's like super feels good and look at
another one of our little branches died
on the palm tree no you yeah it'll be
like Oliver's first palm tree swing
it'll be so cool I still want to know
what all those little ball things are on
the palm tree what are they are they
cast oh yeah they're dates dates like
the ball things is the official name but
I guess they're called dates like dates
and pistachios that right all right
we're gonna get into Nessie up in look
at we just washed her and Josh she has
all these speck did it rain they look
like raindrops babe I'm so bummed I just
look
and my ring is completely bent look at
this it was actually stuck on my finger
I had to like literally get it off it
just totally bent and normally like I
don't know if you guys have seen my
wedding rings before but I have this is
like my engagement ring um and then this
is like my band and it fits in with the
engagement rings and makes it look like
this like so confused at the how this
happened because I did not
I was not like aware of this like I
wasn't doing anything or like something
smashed my finger like nothing is just I
look down and all of a sudden it was
stuck on my finger and I couldn't get it
off doing some good old-fashioned
thrifting look at me see do you need a
decorative box
are you sure look at this actually you
do need a box for your rings and my
broken brick yeah yeah we're very
minimalistic people we would like this
though this uh yeah yeah it's just you
know people probably sort drugs in these
that's what these little boxes are for
okay so we're at Starbucks missing you
really need some water and a bathroom as
always but I'm kind of new what is it
Valencia orange refresher and it's
really good and as you guys
well they actually spelled my name right
about funny that's really impressive
and pretty much he'll just Rose froze
over did you ever think that no one
spells your name right that maybe you
spell it wrong
Oh still won't found our chalk box so
we're getting a new one right on it with
most pens and markers and it erases that
it will have to get babe you don't work
in an office at a desk anymore someone
is like I'll get it to my boss so yeah
we need to buy more chuck it was funny
is the eraser cost more than the chalk
Missy did not want to walk to the car
and rightfully so so I'm pulling Messi
up to her hey is that better yeah it's
really getting that walk because she's
having contractions she doesn't want to
tell me I'm having contractions I'm
actually fine we totally forgot that we
have an appointment at 6:30 to Skype
with someone super cool who do you think
it is because we're super excited except
that now early hopefully we make it to
the house and touch no makeup closers
you don't know hey guys so we told you
we were gonna be collaborating with
someone really cool and a lot of you
have actually guessed you correctly in
the comments and we are skyping with
them right now and we're having so much
fun who you guys think it is what do you
think it is it's mama natural and daddy
natural so excited she's fun top secret
though yeah secret don't you say
anything
yeah so we're super excited we've just
been going over some video ideas and
expect some really awesome things from
us in them so boom yeah thank you
we were on that call for like an hour
and a half and Missy's belly is like
open are you okay Ewan Lavery I didn't
even realize that you are uncomfortable
you're sitting on the yoga ball the
whole time good with me that is right I
am doing a collaboration video with Mama
natural I'm actually doing one other
that I'm really excited about too but
that'll be a little bit later so you
guys can keep guessing on that one but
just a little too long on that ball but
other than that it was so interesting so
much fun and we've got some good videos
coming out so you guys definitely be on
lookout for that I don't know exactly
when it will be out hopefully within
two to three weeks just depending on our
schedules and this baby to because you
know you just never know with him I
can't believe I'm doing a copy video
with Mama natural honestly she was
probably one of the first inspirations
for me when I started I just loved her
content I loved that she had so much
information out there and it was just I
just really inspired to be a have a
channel that was somewhat like hers when
I became pregnant with my second I
actually emailed her because I just like
mama natural I just wanted to know that
I'm pregnant and you I just love
watching your channel and she actually
brought me back and I was like oh I was
like so excited I almost started crying
I swear I was like mom and dad
Children's wrote me it was really fun so
we were on that Skype call for so long
so we were just having so much fun we
totally forgot to eat and Missy is like
pissed she's like I'm I'm not pissed but
yeah I'm kind of Scratchy
and she's like I have to have Chinese so
we just got done skyping with mom and
natural and we are going out to eat at a
Chinese food place she would not approve
if you're watching this Genevieve I'm
sorry it's I'm blaming it on the
pregnant wife
look at her Valley Valley it's like been
crazy she's like feeling bad yeah she's
feeling the same thing as she was
yesterday no I'm not feeling that make
sure that's not true yeah I'm just very
uncomfortable like more than ever like
this has probably been the worst of my
day seriously yeah I'm actually too
miserable right now it's like oh and
look he was moving so much on the way
here yeah and like this is becoming
really painful this side waist my
prediction is he's gonna be here sooner
rather than later so you're wrong
mothers in sticky notes I don't I babe
look at your packing taking that nice I
don't think I can get any bigger it can
scare mmm pick-up sticks there's like an
air of Awesome coming out of the side
not even kidding if you guys don't have
pick-up sticks I feel so bad for you but
it's like amazing to you okay okay
sounds good thank you well she says like
she thinks that you should go too I
think what you're saying was if you
think you're in labor or if there's
possibility that you're gonna have a
baby they're just gonna send you out
because there's no NICU well I just want
to know if I wasn't feeling it's
actually anything at all yeah if I'm
just a little baby but they said um you
just they don't like a signal you don't
send the mercy run they just send you
they register you but then they send you
up to labor and delivery that on-call
doctor there will basically assess you
and tell you what's going on now I'm
just kind of freaked out I feel like I
should not be so like I don't know it's
probably nothing like I said no you need
to be honest about whether you're
feeling ya know and kind of freaked down
now because I feel like I'm
okay KITT almost like it hurts so bad
right now we're just going to wait about
30 minutes and see if any patterns are
starting to form but we're starting to
just try to prepare ourselves right now
I have a bicornuate so the risk of
preterm is there so it's part of why
maybe I'm me being more cautious than if
I was just a regular pregnancy but you
know the pain I'm feeling is pretty
painful and Missy has a really high pain
tolerance too so I'm trying to kind of
just breeze through it and cope but
every time I breathe through I'm like do
you have a contraction you're supposed
to be able to breathe through it and
like that's what that contraction means
is you're breathing through and trying
to like yeah and that doesn't seem that
seems like something to worry about that
I'm the kind of person that doesn't like
to worry I need to not be so careless
and I need to be more cautious so right
now I abilities getting hard okay but
there's the we didn't even wait five
minutes it's okay it's okay babe okay so
I'm literally I'm pacing you guys cuz I
don't know what to do um we're gonna
take her down to the hospital and we're
just gonna have her assessed and I just
like I don't know what to do I don't
know if I should pack clothes or I mean
everything is dead Missy's phone is dead
my phone is dead my laptop is dead um I
don't know what to do I mean this can't
be yet right I'm just like there's a lot
of emotions overtaking me and I didn't
know what to do so I just I turned on
the camera I'm kind of just concerned
and worried and she's just trying to
relax and I don't know what to do I
don't know if I should be packing
I just really hope
thing it's okay just praying that
everything is okay okay so we are
walking up to the hospital
yeah maybe you've seen a wheelchair it
makes me feel scared don't be scared
walk
what are you blocking it gonna be okay
okay don't be scared
so this is his heartbeat I'm guessing
these are your contractions patterns got
a nice strong heartbeat so he's doing
good basically she's saying you are
having contractions but she'd call them
what like irritable irritability
basically your uterus is kind of pissed
right now right yeah
kept saying like he does not have room
he's not gonna be in there much longer
but they don't want to see irritability
also so let's see what happens they're
just gonna keep her hooked up in assess
and see if we have to
he said there's like a shot you can take
he'll be okay
look at you you came in we have no birth
plan you're strapped to the bed there
there twice here is a weekend I know we
even brought her down yeah so you're
having it now yeah uh yeah that was a
big one yeah poor baby
so that's when she had maybe five
minutes ago and this is the one she just
said now she said that one pretty much
hurt huh yeah but I can take it mmm
sorry
with all this rash
really it's just pain time yeah and it's
way better than having a baby in the
NICU uh you're amazing oh it's burning
it's just one little tiny spot after all
thought if the beautiful the uterus
still is there possibility that it could
still be irritable and yeah if you were
to nod if you if it were to keep going
then I would probably have to recheck
your cervix didn't even know if she
really felt like I was being ridiculous
she thought she was just panicking so I
was like look like let's just go get
checked and I don't really have
right now either earlier on but her
desire is to is to deliver with a
midwife and so that's what she's wanting
but really we just needed to know
whether or not this is really what she's
thinking and everyone tells her they're
just braxton-hicks relax yeah thank you
for the think you feel thank you okay
guys so um they gave her a shot of black
beauty to butylene basically they're
just trying to slow down or stop the
contractions they did check her cervix
and she's dilated one centimeter is that
right yes they know the right word
they're gonna give her a shot every 20
minutes
just stop contractions to stop her from
dilating but it's midnight now um and so
I gotta end the vlog you guys I'm really
sorry but she's here she's fine she's
happy she's healthy drinking her water
right drinking water bed water she gets
a total of three shots yeah I'm gonna
have this every 20 minutes for the next
hour as long as everything my uterus
calms down then we'll be early and it
already has right I think her actions
have already calmed down a little going
crazy in there he's like I can't wait to
meet you a couple more weeks baby I
started this thing and you've got your
computer and I'm probably computer
thumbs-up for Brian
thinking thinking ahead yeah and that
way we can get a vlog actually up at
10:00 a.m. they don't even see at least
what's going on baby and what about me
all right thank you guys for watching
Mike this is not feeling too well
like Howie
are you having round ligament pain you
did around ligament
even having a lot of those it's really
hard right now when you feel it yeah but
