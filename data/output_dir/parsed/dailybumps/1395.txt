good morning guys so I woke up this
morning and I put on my pants and then I
grabbed my phone and I was like I'm just
going to go for my phone in my pockets
oh where are my pockets oh they're back
there how long you been wearing them
backward for at least an hour this is
our son baby boy he's gonna do amazing
things putting some biscuits in the oven
and actually we're making some biscuits
and gravy I got gravy cooking I'm
cooking some sausage those are kind of
burned hey good morning guys were making
some breakfast
oli has been trying to escape his little
car thing now it seems like he wants to
walk in it more what do you who's that
is that karma chameleon - karma can wait
dude yeah yeah kabaah dog can you say
dog dog so smart you guys okay so all he
has learned how to climb out of that
little Walker that he loves before he
can even walk so now he's in the playpen
we find out of it lay on the floor it's
quite genius and all I'm thinking is are
you gonna do that in your crib now you
get to watch mommy do dishes that's your
punishment cake oh yeah
oh yeah
this isn't gravy in the hizzle and boom
there's breakfast you guys so Missy she
likes her biscuit opened with gravy on
top
as well and I'm eating my biscuit
unopened things getting really exciting
over here you guys all right you guys
consensus on the new camera I have been
using it all morning to vlog and playing
around with it and stuff and I think
I've made my decision and I'm taking it
back yeah it's way it's way too big you
guys okay I know probably a lot of you
are really liking updated quality and
stuff but honestly I can't take this
thing everywhere like I am dreading
going out in public and having to carry
that in my pocket because it's just
really big this is um our elf 3:30
this is what we normally use and it's
very small it's still kind of big you
know it's like bigger than my phone but
I have to carry this thing everywhere
and I mean if I was shooting with this I
might as well just care about my DSLR
and just vlog like this that's not weird
yeah okay guys yeah my arm would break
going on go no no Oliver are you
controlling this thing are you
controlling it he's loving this but
he's not very good at controlling the
deal and it is very difficult to control
not sure he can't quite smell a silly
mama Wow I'm gonna take this back but
the thing is is that you see a lot of
ghosts and like nasty stuff when we use
these cameras just because the lens is
dirty and the lenses are scratched and
stuff so I cleaned them off hopefully
they'll get better but I did order two
new cameras too because basically when
the lens is scratched there's like
nothing you can do and I don't know if
you guys can like really tell yeah there
you go you can see like the scratch on
the lens that's basically what's making
this thing look like crap so yeah I
ordered two new ones of these so they
should be coming from ac-9 kind of
bummed because they don't sell these
anymore so they're hard to find then
also the pink one somebody's gonna have
normal black one but hers was even in
water like it's really messed up hers is
the quality of the videos is going to
get better because I'm gonna be getting
new cameras I can't justify using this
one
especially because I can get two new of
these ones for the same price as this
one really hoping that it was kind of
gonna be like just as portable but it
just isn't by the way I know my voice
sounds funny the other day when I had
food poisoning I was throwing up I
really messed up my voice but it wasn't
like this yesterday and then I woke up
and now I'm talking like this I don't
know why cuz he gave me some vitamin C
things should probably take these Oh my
battery is flashing on this too and I
barely used it so I think that's
probably an indication to that the
battery life is horrible so taking this
thing back because it's too big and the
battery life sucks so our friend Heidi
from while they're not being sent us a
gift and is like the most adorable thing
ever look at this it's a little hat is
done perfectly
it does fit in perfectly on that bag and
so you can flip it around here let's try
it okay do you like it it's so good yeah
she also got him a little v-neck which
is perfect to some get job ID thank you
yeah he said it was for his birthday
which is really really early because his
birthdays in like two months
yeah she just couldn't help herself so
cool thank you
he's so much so singing Duggan music
Nick a little yeah boy actually actually
amazing that actually it fits him really
well yeah and it all obviously funny is
I haven't even been able to see I
haven't seen baby snapbacks anywhere I
didn't know they made up I know so cool
alright this baby's got a lot of swag
now huh we're going on adventure I got
you your your monkey your guitar your
bananas you got your swag cap on okay
ready
alright well we decided to take our
little adventure which isn't really an
adventure I'm just running errands
around the time that kids got a school
so it's not so much running an adventure
but more of sitting in traffic with my
son huh what are you doing you are
comparing yourself okay I love every
time I like you you say something to him
now he's like my my
man ba duh so funny but I was just
thinking like I see all there's like so
many parks around here like really cool
stuff and I can only take him like now
like I take I like taking him and like
letting miss you get a break but I can't
like him now because he's not really
walking yet but when he's walking I
think we'll be going to like a lot of
parks and letting him run around and
stuff you know he's so cute red light
mr. buckets uh promised a kidnap he said
so good yes human yes you did I love to
play with his little cheeks
yup he's woke up from a second nap and
he just so good hit that if you do come
on you're such a donkey
baby huh who do I get a duh look it is
ready little pony pretty pony kitty crap
really watching one-handed okay we were
telling you guys earlier how Oliver can
climb out of his Walker now and I
thought I'd show you how he does it cuz
it's crazy
basically he could no longer be in this
unless we are literally right next to
him the entire time let's see he'll do
it he's like a mom I know how to get out
of this thing do what are you doing make
just like scooches itself out you go
headfirst huh Ollie what are you doing
Ollie and there he goes there's the legs
you don't even he doesn't even give it
like a mini like he doesn't even sit in
it and pretend like he's gonna sit it
he's like oh no I'm out here I'm just
gonna climb out there he goes ah you did
it good job this was a good one that we
could kind of put them in for like a few
minutes but now he can't even be in it
for a few minutes like he just climbs
out hey this is what I do when it's bath
time for all and I used to love to do
this when I was a kid as I get a world
whirlpool going ah he said whoa can you
just splash water there we go look at
that whirlpool she's literally about to
float away with the current yeah cool

them tell me she's not being
overdramatic yeah it's uh we just got
done filming um the Mother's Day video
