good morning guys and happy Monday today
is going to be a little bit different
you wanna watch toy toy today's a little
bit different for me and Brian I am
actually working on a secret project a
surprise for Brian and so I actually
sent Brian to Disneyland with my cousin
I'm gonna work on my project and
hopefully if I get done soon enough then
I actually may end up going to
Disneyland with this little guy and meet
Brian there what are you talking about
you've been talking like the entire time
I was talking and I have no idea what
you were saying what were you saying
Oh woody if we go to Disneyland we might
actually see woody be really exciting if
we get to go to Disneyland hold it later
but I gotta work on my project and I
basically kick prying out of the house
so I can do that so that's what I'm
doing
all right mama is all done with her
little project we've been working all
day Holly and now he's watching Toy
Story
I've got his woody and we are all packed
up for Disneyland Brian is planning on
staying there for quite a while so we're
getting there a little bit late but I
think it's gonna be fun
to go a little bit later and instead of
going in the morning and then leaving
early we're basically gonna go at night
or let go later and then stay later so
are you excited for Disney he's just
excited to watch Toy Story that's like
his life right now so yeah we're headed
Disneyland this is why we did not drive
him home from Disneyland at the wrong
time of day that is insane this has been
going on for miles and miles
all right Holly where we at say
Disneyland we're at Disneyland and I
brought Ike let him bring woody without
his hat and I told him that I know in
the movies that when woody gets lost he
always finds his way home but if food he
gets lost is could be lost so we can't
lose woody okay can't lose woody now on
a mission to go find daddy
mom we miss you daddy he's actually in
dissonant right now so we're gonna head

at the pier that emulates San Francisco
and the California Adventure and I never
