I'm sorry but that's really cool oh my
god it's the mirror era said
I was like no lights really really cool
do you imagine having to wait all this
oh look at the greenhouses
friend just went on the foghorns ride
and I decided to look at 30-minute way
so I decided to take all the way over to
dr. Seuss things is so cute it's always
very colorful and pretty um and I just
found a ride that I'm pretty sure we can
go on whoo there's tons of rollers out
here the 5-minute weight and I feel like
don't stop bargain you want to go in dr.
Seuss yeah you're not gonna remember
this but I will and that's what matters
okay let's grab you we're going to go on
this dr. Seuss oh look at the cute
little Mandrake's they're sleeping now
you know where Mandrake is it's a little
baby and you pull it up from at em and
then they come out make cry but if you
hear them cry it'll make you faint I've
seen that yeah see what I'm working with
here you guys
sorry got a cold chariot ready
there's Dumbledore's office in that cool
right I'm not sure if always gonna be
able to do this one we're gonna check it
out though and it looks really cool
we're going in and dr. Seuss
man that one didn't work because he can
sit up but since he can't us like sit
there without trying to crawl away
because he just wants to like go do
something they're like it he probably
won't like sit still and ride the ride
so thank you spread that one but that's
okay it was just just a tester huh
David told anyone yet
holy cow Cassie how is that that was
amazing that was so crazy you guys oh my
gosh I feel sick
flying and then there was like Dementors
and it's like it was so great yeah
there's a tip for if you guys ever got a
Wizarding World they have these red
carts where you can actually buy
butterbeer from but the line is insane
so if you guys go into like the hogshead
or the Three Broomsticks
you can actually get it way faster
there's the Mandrake's you can hear
squealing in there
