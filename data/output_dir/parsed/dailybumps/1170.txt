again you guys I've been taking this
every day
the airborne gummy to build my immune
system before I go to Cambodia and it is
not a fun thing to do it's just not a
good gummy it's
thick and the flavor is weird it just
tastes like medicine but I do want to
build my immune system before I go to
Cambodia because I really don't want to
get sick while I go which by the way you
guys I was just looking into it
I have 18 hours of flying to do that's a
15 hour flight from LAX to Taiwan and
then a 3-hour flight from Taiwan to
Cambodia so I'm gonna be in an airplane
for 18 hours that's almost a whole day I
don't know what to do with myself
gonna be traveling for 18 hours in a
plane and then when I land I'm 15 hours
ahead of Missy so it's gonna be really
really weird especially when I go to
send footage for like the day you know
like my day of footage of her day
footage it's gonna be really kind of
mentally taxing to actually think of
Karma it's freaking out he thinks we're
going somewhere really fun unfortunately
we're not we're going to the vet and you
think God but he is going because he is
due for some vaccines and that means I
get some shots however things your head
to the park or not okay puppy okay now
we have new friends
adzuki Rojas now it's starting to get
more nerve-racking so we made it over to
my mom's house because karma really
wants to play so we're here with Kota
and karma and they're gonna play some
ball
guys like a bunny rabbit me just like a
little spot for the dogs to go potty and
it's actually this turf it's not um
actual grass and just looks like grass
yeah it's fake grass so it's just a
little spot for them too in the spring
we're gonna make we're gonna landscape
yeah I'm gonna do it now this is just
temporary to keep them so they don't get
muddy feet yeah I call like fenced off
so they basically just got here go potty
I just threw his toy into that box
Holly's gonna help them they're being
very brother me right now yeah so it's
not home and I ran the target and if you
guys don't know target all Christmas
stuff at Target is 50% off and we always
like to pick up like a couple ornaments

on sale and then I got this thing

ornaments a bitch is adorable look at
