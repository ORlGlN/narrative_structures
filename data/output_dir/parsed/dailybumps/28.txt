your energy on the crayon?

-  Focus, focus, focus!
Whoa!
(gasps) You did that
with your magic powers.
- That was you.
-  Okay.

-  Good morning!
- Good morning, boys, how are you?
(ding)
(Finley vocalizing)
I know!
So this morning, the boys
and I are kinda matching.
We're wearing these
short-sleeve sweater thingies.
You guys look so cute all
the time, you know that?
- We have pockets, you don't have pockets.
- Oh, I don't have pockets,
you do have pockets, that's so cool.
Yours has pockets too.
All right, boys, I was thinking,
we should go to breakfast.
- Yeah.
-  All right, boys,
where should we go to breakfast?
- Richie's!
- You really wanna go to Richie's?
Okay, we'll check out Richie's. (laughs)
Yes, good morning guys, I am going to take
these two boys to breakfast,
but what is out here?
(yells)
What is it, Ollie?
- Bat.
-  Go get it, go catch it.
There's a vampire bat
hanging out in our courtyard.
Did you find this, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Where'd you find it?
- We found it from there yesterday.
-  That's so funny, it was there
from the Halloween party, remember?
- Yeah.
- It's, like, the most beautiful,
blue, clear skies today, you guys.
Oh, I see a little bit of clouds.
Something in there. (laughs)
(both vocalizing)
Yay!
Taking the boys to breakfast
in the truck this morning
because of the handy dandy DVD player.
They love taking the truck,
they beg to take the truck.
I think they're watching
"Lego Batman" right now,
and they could not be happier. (laughs)
Makes driving a little bit nicer.
(Finley vocalizing)
What, buddy?
(Finley vocalizing)
Oh really?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
(Finley vocalizing)
(Bryan laughs)
We're also at the longest red light ever.
- Go, it's green!
(upbeat music)
- Boys, guess what?
-  What?
-  We made it!
Let's go!
Let's go, let's go eat
some pancakes, right?
-  Yeah.
-  Favorite food ever?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.
These boys are so good.
Look at them, holding
hands, walking together.
Are you guys best friends?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah. (laughs)
Hey Finn, what are you gonna order?
(vocalizes)
(upbeat music)
- Pancakes are this way, guys. (laughs)
(upbeat music)
What're you doing, Ollie?
- This is what June used to do.
-  Oh really?
- Yeah.
-  Are you focusing
your energy on the crayon?
- Yeah.
-  Trying to make it fall?
- It's fallin'!
-  Focus, focus, focus!
Whoa!
(gasps) You did that
with your magic powers.
- That was you.
-  Okay.
(upbeat music)
Hey Ollie, what're you doing?
- I'm giving him a tattoo.
-  You're giving
your brother a tattoo?
- Yeah.
-  On his forehead?
- Yeah.
-  Finn, how do you
feel about this? (laughs)
Oh, that's a beautiful tattoo, Finn.
-  Yeah.
-  Do you like it?
- Is it cool?
- Yeah, it's really cool.
Their imagination is just adorable.
- Look at my ear.
-  Whoa!
You have your crayon behind it.
- Is that honey?
- Yeah that's honey. (laughs)
They also are nonstop when I take them out
without their mother. (laughs)
-  Ama!
-  Amo!
(Bryan laughs)
(both vocalizing)
(upbeat music)
- So, we just got our breakfast,
and Ollie has learned
how to do something new,
and he's really excited to tell you.
- I just tore my pancakes all by myself.
-  Yes he did, he tore up
all his pancakes by himself.
I still had to cut up Finn's,
'cause he's still learning,
but that is so awesome, Ollie,
I'm so proud of you. (laughs)
(upbeat music)
(both vocalizing)
I think it's dance time.
(Bryan laughs)
The boys are so excited
because they had jelly beans.
- Yes! (vocalizing)
- Yeah, so Finn got Wonder Woman,
you got gummy bears, and I actually saw
Coldstone jelly beans and
Krispy Kreme jelly beans,
so I grabbed them so that
we can snack on them,
'cause that sounded good, and
anytime you get jelly beans,
it's a good time to dance, right?
Show me your dance move, boys.
Show me your dance moves!
(both vocalizing)
There we go.
All right, crazy kids,
let's go home, okay?
- Okay.
- All right, so we are now at the barn,
and Ollie is taking me to go see Cosmo,
the little horse they have.
- Right there, with the white and black.
-  Oh, that's him over there?
- Yeah.
-  Let's go say hi.
- He's staring out at us.
- Okay.
Ollie really wanted to hop on Nacho today,
and he was so sad he didn't get to do it
the last time they were here, so I think
he's gonna hop on Nacho, right, buddy?
Comfortable Ollie is
with this place already.
He loves all the animals and
horses and people. (laughs)
It's really cool.
What'd you find?
- Rocks.
-  Hey, Cosmo.
- Is that Cosmo right there, and that one?
They are, like, the same color.
-  (laughs) They're
the same color, huh?
You don't know which one is which, do you?
- That one is.
-  That's Cosmo?
- Yeah.
-  Okay. (laughs)
(mellow music)
Here we go.
Ollie's hopping up on Nacho.
- Yeah, let's go, Nacho.
He's like, "You want pictures, or what?"
(Bryan laughs)
-  Nacho's like,
"Wait, am I a pony now?"
- Yeah. (laughs)
-  "Do I give pony rides?"
(mellow music)
- It is so cold today, I
had to put on a jacket.
Ollie got to put on a jacket, huh?
- Yeah.
- It is chilly.
I wanna give a quick little
update on Nacho and his foot.
How're you doing, bud?
Huh? (laughs)
So, I just gave him a little
ride to see how he's doing,
just a really, really brief one,
and he's actually doing really good.
He's doing better.
I'm really hoping he's
back to 100% really soon,
because I really wanna go on trail rides,
and I've got friends who wanna go.
Hopefully soon he's feeling better.
That foot's just gotta get better, Nacho.
We're just letting Nacho
do a little grazing
outside the barn.
Hey Nacho, I see a good
piece of grass over there.
C'mon, come over here.
What is that?
So, we just put Nacho away,
and he was doing really good.
It's weird just looking down here,
and we've got Cosmo down here,
and then that's Bigsby,
and Ollie loves Cosmo, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Now, tell me,
why do like Cosmo so much?
- 'Cause he's a baby horse.
-  (laughs) Yes, Cosmo is a pony.
I keep telling him, he's older
than you, Ollie, he's 11.
(laughs) But he's small, huh?
- Yeah.
- So he's like a kid's horse.
Ollie's been talking a lot lately
about learning how to ride and
getting his own horsy, huh?
Wouldn't that be so fun?
- Yeah.
-  Are you gonna
get your own horse one day?
- Yeah.
-  And how 'bout,
like, a little pony?
- Mm-hmm, I like little ponies.
-  You like little ponies?
What color pony do you want?
- White and black.
-  White and black,
kinda like him, right?
Like Cosmo?
- Yeah, I want one like him.
- So, it sounds like you want a Paint?
That's pretty interesting, huh?
I think that would be so cute.
One day we will totally have
the horses on our property,
and we will totally get the boys a pony,
and you can learn to ride.
You could have your own pony,
wouldn't that be so cute?
- Yeah.
(Missy laughs)
- But, for now, we just get
to look at them, huh? (laughs)
And we got Nacho to keep
us busy for now, huh?
And you can ride Nacho,
he's not super big.
- Yeah.
-  He's not as big as Funs, huh?
- Yeah.
- Funs over there, and Dutchess, phew.
They are big horses.
(gasps) Are you Spider Man?
(both yell)
Spider Man's kinda crazy.
- Captain America.
-  Oh, and it's Captain America.
It's chocolate Captain America,
you got your Hershey's pajamas on.
- Yeah.
(Missy laughs)
- Wait, I don't have a shield!
- Oh yeah, all right guys,
lay down, it's time for bed.
We gotta read a couple books,
and then it's time for bed, okay?
-  Okay.
(kisses)
- Are you guys ready to go to bed?
Did you have a fun day?
-  Yeah.
- You're being crazy.
(vocalizes)
Did you have a fun day, Finn?
Oh my goodness.
Ollie, did you have fun riding Nacho?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yes, we had a super fun day,
especially up at the barn,
but we are gonna go ahead and go to bed,
'cause we're exhausted, huh?
We got tired?
Are we tired?
(Finley vocalizing)
Oh yeah, that is a tired face right there.
(Finley vocalizing)
Oh yeah, we're gonna read this book?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Anyways, hope you guys
enjoyed today's video.
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up if you did.
Woo!
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.
-  Bye. (blows raspberry)
Bloop.
(upbeat music)
