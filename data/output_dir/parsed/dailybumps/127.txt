- We have something to tell you.
Ollie.
- We have an a-ouncement.
- We do have an announcement!
- An ouncement!
- It's also so adorable, the
way he says announcement.
Say it again, Ollie.
- A-ouncement!
- We've never done this before.
- Nope.
- It's been something that people
have requested for so long now.
- Yeah.
- We are doing--
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
(Missy laughs)
- We are up this morning and out
Where are we going boys?
- Class!
- To music class!
- Music class!
We've actually missed
the last couple weeks,
Ollie's only been one
time, and he loved it.
So I thought, "I'm just
gonna bring him again,"
and I think he'll like it again.
- I think it helps Finn get
- I will!
(Missy laughs)
I think it helps Finn get
a little more into it.
But yeah, we're really
excited for music class,
and I think we're gonna
have a super fun day!
Okay boys?
- Kay!
-  Okay, let's go!
- Are you guys ready for music class?
- Yay!
- Are you excited?
He's always so shy.
You go play the drums?
- Yeah.
They got a little drum.
Oh my goodness!
That was like big boy moves, huh?
(slow instrumental music)
- Good class.
Turn it upside down, upside down.
-  Are you at Mimi's house
and you already got jelly beans?
You have the best Mimi ever, huh?
Yep we're done with music class,
and we're now at Mimi's.
And the boys are hanging
out, having a blast.
We're checking out the new upstairs.
- So we're getting rid
of the kitty-cat tree
'cause they just kinda ...
-  Yeah.
- Starting to fall apart.
-  Yeah.
- And we decided that we're gonna make
a cat shelving.
So it's gonna be
-  That's so cute!
- like a stair stepping.
So she'll go from here to here,
and then one here,
and then we have
corner pieces
-  Oh like a corner?
- Gonna go up at the very top,
-  That's so cute!
- Cause she likes to be super high.
So yeah, we're working
on the little shelves.
- Zuri is basically a
spoiled little brat here.
(Missy laughs)
She gets to do anything she wants,
and now she gets to
climb up to the ceilings.
- Yeah.
-  That kitty
cat is so spoiled, huh?
- Yeah.
- He's like, "I'm eating jelly beans."
Anyways, I'm actually headed off
to go get my hair done.
Boys are gonna hang out with Mimi.
(Missy laughs)
-  Okay, bye Mommy!
-  Say bye-bye!
(Finn mumbles)
-  Momma!
All done!
We just got our hair done!
June, your hair look is,
is looking so good
- So fun!
- You got a fresh cut,
fresh color.
Just kidding.
(laughs)
But yeah, we just got done,
and I really like,
I would like it a little bit darker.
- I think it looks really good.
- Yeah.
- I love when you go dark.
And then the ends are so pretty.
- It's like fall,
so it's time to go dark.
- Totally.
- And she always just does the tone.
- Yeah, I'm trying to
not dye my hair anymore,
(Missy laughs)
okay, I decided I'm way too
low maintenance for that
(Missy laughs)
I can't handle it.
- Yeah.
So anyways, now we gotta go
meet up with all our boys.
Here we go.
Alright, I just got back to my parents'
and apparently Finn has been
doing errands with my dad,
but he has slept the entire time,
and my dad has carried him,
you carried him all
around the hardware store?
- Ace Hardware.
- In the car, taking him in and out,
and he is zonked.
- Brought him in here.
- He's so tired!
He's been so bad at taking naps,
so I'm guessing he probably was just like
"Mom, I really need a nap, and
this is how I'm gonna do it.
"I'm gonna sleep on Papa."
That's so cute!
I thought for sure he'd wake up when you--
Just sleeping.
Check out the project they
finished while I was gone too.
They got their little stuff up,
and looks like Zuri's loving it!
You have your own little space now?
Oh she's,
(laughs)
she's like "I'm gonna kill you!"
She's so mean!
Can I pet you?
No, just stay! Oh gosh.
Yeah, she's gonna love this.
This is like her room now.
- Oh hey, there's my cute family!
- We're all together!
- I missed you guys!
Did you have a fun day with Papa?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, how 'bout you
Ollie, what'd you do today?
- I hung out with Mimi.
- Oh cool!
That's awesome!
What's up you guys?
So we have something to tell you.
Ollie.
- We have an a-ouncement.
- We do have an announcement!
- An ouncement!
- It's also so adorable the
way he says announcement.
Say it again Ollie.
- A-ouncement!
- A-ouncement!
Hey Finn, can you say "an announcement"?
(Finn mumbles)
We have a big family announcement,
we've never done this before.
- Nope.
- It's been something
that people have requested
for so long now.
- Yep.
- We are doing a 2018 family calendar!
(cheering)
- Remember when we did that?
- We took so many cool photos you guys,
for this calendar,
it was like a 10-hour shoot day.
It was so fun.
- So much fun.
- So much fun.
Do you guys remember when
the fire truck got called?
That was the day--
Or the fire engine got
called to our house,
that was the day we were shooting.
So you'll have to get
it so that you can see
what picture we were shooting,
but yeah, we put together a
really cool 2018 calendar.
We wanted to do something special
and not just use old family photos,
so we took new family photos
for every single month,
and they're themed and
they're hilarious and so cute!
- So cute.
-  These boys
were so cute that day,
it was like one of the best days ever,
shooting.
- Yes.
They were so good, they put up with a lot.
-  Yeah
- And it was really good,
doing it.
- So the Daily Bump's
first ever 2018 calendar
is available right now
for order on our website,
dailybumpsmerch.com,
also linked down below in the description,
so go get yourself one!
And we are signing a
limited number of them!
Finn, do you want to sign a calendar?
- Yeah.

- Yay.

there's gonna be an unsigned option,
and there's also gonna be a signed one,

amount of the signed ones,
so be sure to grab those while you can.
We're so excited!
- This is gonna be so fun.
- I'm excited to hang it in our house,
cause it's gonna look so good!
- Something that's really
cool 'bout the calendar,
is we just added all kinds of
fun stuff to look forward to
throughout the calendar.
-  Yeah.

I can't believe we're doing a calendar!
- I know!
- We've never done that before.
- I know, we've never done it!
- Five years on YouTube,
and we have never done a calendar!
It's a lot of work though,
so I kind of understand.
- Yeah, it was a lot of work.
- And I think last year
we wanted to do it,
and it was like November,
I was like "Oh."
So we planned ahead.
- Yes.
- We made it happen.
-  Riding his bike,
too cool for school.
Wow!
(dog barking)
- This morning he woke up,
got out of bed,
ran straight to his bike,
grabbed it, took it outside,
and went --
-  Oh.
- Early this morning in his
pajamas, just riding his bike.
-  He is obsessed with
this thing all of a sudden.
He likes it.
- I know, he actually is
obsessed with any kind of bike,
but like, if he's, during the
day and he's playing with it,
and he has to come inside,
he brings it with him
and he puts it on the table next to him,
puts it on the couch next to him.
-  Alright boys,
this is the finish line.
And this is the starting line.
You guys ready to race?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
-  Alright, not yet!
On your mark, get set, go!
And Ollie's in the lead,
but Finn's a close second,
peddling and peddling
his way with his feet,
and Ollie crosses the finish line!
Go Finn, you're almost there!
Whoo! Good job dude.
Ollie just kept going.
Whoa!
Wheelie! Whoa!
You're so cool dude.
(slow instrumental music)
-  Oh hi Mo!
This is Moana.
-  Moana.
-  My baby girl.
- You guys remember when she was born,
held her like, minutes after
she hatched out of her egg.
- Uh oh, I don't --
-  Where do you want this?
- There.
(Bryan laughs)
-  He has to have it up there, aww.
- But now look at her,
she's still like a little baby.
-  She is, she's
one of our few hens
that we got from that.
- We got only two hens.
-  Oh two!
- Two!
-  Oh geeze.
- From that whole batch.
-  Yeah. Hi Moana
- This one and the other
one is like a scaredy cat,
she's kinda like the bottom
of the pecking order, so.
- She's so soft.
- I know, she's so sweet.
-  Ollie, you're so brave!
(Ollie screaming)
- Are you scared?
They've never done anything to him!
-  Aww.
- Hey guys.
-  What?
- I got a Lego Batman set.
-  Oh yeah, you
want to put it together?
- Yeah!
(upbeat music)
-  Is that man
going down the slide Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Let's see!
-  Whee!
-  Hey Finn, can
you sing the Batman song?
- Yeah.
-  Na-na na-na na-na na-na Batman!
- Batman!
- I did it!
-  Good job dude!
- It goes right there!
-  Ollie built that
ladder all by himself you guys,
by following the instructions.
Good job Ollie, I'm so proud of you dude!
You like putting together stuff?
- Does this go here?
-  Yeah, it does.
Good job.
(upbeat music)
Ms. Luna-Loo, she just got
cleaned up and trimmed.
Not really trimmed.
We have a dog groomer
here doing both the dogs.
I told her she needs, like a little trim,
and it is so short.
Look how short this is,
she looks like a puppy.
Oh, I'm so bummed,
I'm sorry.
The dog groomer said they did it right,
so she didn't necessarily
shave her undercoat,
which is good 'cause
you're not supposed to
shave a dog's undercoat.
That's actually the
mistake we made with Karma,
a long time ago,
which is why we have
to keep his fur short,
because it's not very soft anymore.
So we're hoping that it's all good,
and her coat will be soft still.
So she just got a little trim.
But yeah, we both saw her and we were like
"Oh no. Oh no, that's way too short!"
She looks like a puppy!
She's still our little puppy,
our little Luna puppy.
Our Luna Christmas puppy,
we've almost had her for a whole year.
And she has turned out
to be such a great dog,
and we love her,
and she is a part of the family,
and it's just really cool
when pets become a part of the family.
Scrabble and wine night!

in their matching onesies.

- 20.

And we are playing Scrabble
on our new Scrabble board,

Who's turn is it, Kelsey?
- Is it my turn?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah.

(Bryan laughs)
