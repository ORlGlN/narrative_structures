- I thought, as a
family, we would sit down
with all our pumpkin
spice-flavored things,
and we would do a little
pumpkin spice challenge.
- What is this?
- That tastes like-
- Cardboard again?
- Paper? (Missy laughs)
Not good.
- Like, maybe-
- You can't pumpkin spice
everything, you guys.
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it, live it forever
- Good Morning!
- Morning!
-  Is it morning time, boys?
- Yeah!
- No, it's lunch time! (laughs)
Me and the boys are on
a little lunch date.
Daddy's still not feeling good today,
so I am taking the boys out.
We have to go do a little
bit of grocery shopping,
but other than that, we
might go somewhere fun.
- We are going to the bouncy park today!
- He really wants to
go to the bouncy park.
I think he's trying to solidify it by
putting it in the vlog because he thinks
if we say it, then it's
definitely happening,
but that's not necessarily true.
We'll see, we might go to the park, okay?
- Aghh!
- Aghh!
As planned, it worked.
These boys, they're so cute.
- We're at the fun playground!
-  Whoo, have you
ever been here before?
- No.
- No, are you excited?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and what's Fin doing?
- Hm, Fin's just looking at me.
- He's awake! (laughs)
And guess who's with us?
Uncle!
Since Brian is sick today, I thought
let's go have some fun at the playground,
and I thought I'd drag
along my brother. (laughs)
Fun little time to hang out, and the
extra help is always nice, 'cause places
like this, your kids just
tend to go in opposite
directions, and you're only one person.
We're just gonna run out, run around
for a little bit, and then, we gotta
actually get home pretty soon.
So, let's go have some fun, 'kay?
So yeah, this brand new place opened up,
and this is the first time we're going in.
I don't think it's been open very long.
So, we're excited to check it out, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
(upbeat pop music)
Oh my goodness, this is the coolest thing.
We've never had anything like this
where we live in our area.
This is so neat!
(upbeat pop music)
Oh my goodness, they're so cute!
Oh my gosh, you're so strong, Ollie!
- Yeah!
-  Whoo! (laughs)
And he's off.
Whoo!
-  You're really going fast.
-  Oh my gosh! (laughs)
Ah!
(upbeat pop music)
And they're off again.
Whoo!
Whoo hoo hoo!
Are you having fun?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Whoa, whoa!
This place is so cool, but I cannot even
keep up with Ollie, I can
only keep up with Fin,
and there he goes again,
and it is warm up here.
I can't even see Ollie,
I better go find him.
Oh my gosh, that place
was so fun, huh, Ollie?
- Yeah!
- Yeah, um, I feel like
we barely scratched the surface.
There was so much to do, we just, like,
were there for, like, maybe 30 minutes.
- 45.
- 40, maybe 40 minutes.
But it was really fun, I'm actually
really excited to go
there, like, more often.
I think the kids are
gonna love playing there.
So much fun activities,
like learning things,
like, oh, I just loved it.
So, we're off now, though.
We'll definitely hang out
there more often though.
'Kay, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Well, hello, guys.
I have been a little MIA for a while.
Definitely feeling just under the weather,
which definitely sucks,
but I wanted to show you
guys that our fish tank
is all clear, finally!
Check that out, it did a really good job.
He'd said it would take a
couple of days, possibly.
So, got all our live rock
in there, our live sand.
So far, everything is
running really smooth.
So, the tank is basically, like,
acclimating itself right now.
And then, in a couple
days, we'll be able to add
our first fish, and
then, in a couple weeks,
we'll be able to, like, start adding
our own coral and anemone and stuff,
which is gonna be really, really cool.
And possibly, like, we'll post things
on Twitter, like, with pictures as we're
shopping, like, which ones you guys
think we should have in the tank.
'Cause there's a lot of different, like,
colors and variations
you can play around with,
but I'm really excited that we finally
got a fish tank, a real fish tank set up.
I've been wanting one of these forever.
So, it's just really cool that we
get to do this as a family now.
And for those of you who don't
follow me on Instagram,
this is the kind of
magic that you're missing out on.
Using emojis, little mermaid music.
I like to post on my Instagram
how things are going, kind of like
behind the scenes and stuff.
So, make sure you guys
follow me on Instagram
so you don't miss out on all the fun.
(folksy music)
- All right, kiddos.
(drum rolls with hands)
Over the past couple of days,
we have acquired a very large amount
of pumpkin spice items.
- Ooh!
- There's lots and lots of crazy
pumpkin-y treasures this time of year.
Look at that! (Missy laughs)
I thought-
- That looks good!
- As a family, we would sit down
with all our pumpkin
spice-flavored things,
and we would do a little
pumpkin spice challenge.
What do you boys say,
does that sound good?
- Yeah!
- Halloween!
- Halloween!
- I put my Pumpkin Spice
Everything shirt on-
- Oh yeah!
- For this video.
- Nice!
By the end of this video,
we'll probably all be
like little round, orange
pumpkins bopping along.
Okay, let's see what we
got in our bag of tricks.
So, the first thing we're gonna start
is actually one for Fin.
This is Happy Baby Organics, and it's
apples, pumpkin, and carrots, and it's
a baby food, obviously,
we're starting easy.
- He picked it out first, so let's
see what he thinks.
- Yeah!
Ooh.
Take a bite.
- How is it?
- Buh.
- Buh! (Missy laughs)
Buh, that is his reaction.
- Does buh mean good?
I think he liked it.
- We'll put a little on here.
It's very orange, it's
all very orange, you guys.
- Yummy?
- Yeah, it's a little weird.
Definitely a little weird.
- What's the next one?
- For the next one, how
about pumpkin spice Cheerios?
- These actually sound pretty good.
- I know, I love Cheerios, it's
such a good, classic breakfast.
The whole pumpkin spice thing
might be screwing it up.
Ooh, it's very ...
- Is it very?
- It's like super spicy,
smell it, you guys.
(Cheerios rattle) Smell
it, you smell that?
Smell it.
- I'll smell it.
-  I wanna smell, I wanna smell.
Ooh, that actually smells really good.
- Smells yummy, 'kay, try it.
Here, try some, boys, mmm.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
- I like it!
- Fin likes it, too!
- Mmm!
- Do you like it, Ollie?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, Ollie likes it, too!
Fin likes it.
- That was a good one.
Okay, pumpkin pie, that's what
you eat in the morning,
ladies and gentlemen.
(Fin babbles) What's next, you say?
Well, how about some pumpkin
spice-flavored ice cream?
That's right, nothing is safe
this holiday season, you guys.
They are going to pumpkin
spice everything, and
you kind of just have to
accept it at this point.
So, let's open this up,
see what it looks like.
Yeah, it's actually pumpkin
pie-flavored ice cream,
and it's not as, like, dark orange.
It's actually, like, a little white.
- It's got whipped cream,
like, swirls in it, I believe.
- All right, you want to try it, boys?
Take a bite, Fin, mmm.
- How is it, Fin?
It's like vanilla ice cream.
- It does taste like pumpkin pie.
You can actually taste the whipped cream.
- Mmm!
- It's not bad, huh?
- It's actually pretty
good. (Bryan laughs)
- Pumpkin spice ice cream, you guys-
- It doesn't have as-
- That's crazy.
- Much of a spicy flavor, I feel like.
- What's next?
- What's next, you ask?
How about pumpkin cookies?
- Yum!
- Who wants to try a pumpkin cookie?
It's pumpkin chocolate chip cookies.
- You want a chocolate chip cookie?
- Yes.
- All right.
There's one for you, there's one for you.
There's one for you.
Pumpkin cookie, this actually kind of
makes sense 'cause pumpkin and
chocolate chip is, like, really good.
That is not good.
- Ew!
Why does it taste like cardboard?
- It is not good. (Missy laughs)
I like pumpkin cookies, but those are-
- No, you eat it, do you like it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but
you don't want to eat it?
- Do you like it, Ollie?
- Mm-hmm.
- Ollie likes it.
- Ollie likes it. (laughs)
- Okay, so the pumpkin
cookies were a bust.
I was actually kind of betting on those.
Um, but up next, I think something that's
gonna be really delicious, donuts!
These are old-fashioned glazed donuts,
pumpkin spice-flavored.
- I think these are gonna be good!
- Are they just regular donuts?
- Yes, they are regular donuts.
All right, have a regular donut!
They're like a really
cool shade of orange, too.
Here you go, Fin.
- Me and Fin can share.
- Look at how
orange they are. (laughs)
- I'm not a huge donut fan.
- I like them!
- Oh my goodness!
You like it?
- Mm-hmm. (Fin babbles)
- That is really good, you guys.
- These are really good.
- Yeah!
- I don't really taste much
of the pumpkin, do you?
- Yeah, it's a little spicy, not too much.
- Yeah, it's really good.
- Those are a win.
- We got a good one!
- Yay!
- All right, Fin,
next up, I have another one for you.
Like I said, no food is
safe, even baby food.
They're gonna pumpkin
spice all the baby food.
They're gonna pumpkin spice the milk.
They're gonna pumpkin spice the eggs.
They're just gonna put pumpkin
spice in everything, huh?
- There is pumpkin spice
milk, I did see that.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I didn't buy
it, 'cause I was like-
- Oh my gosh.
- Ewww.
- All right, these are Mighty Snack Bars,
and they're actually pumpkin banana.
What do you think, Fin?
- Gah!
- Good?
- Good?
- Gah!
- Yay!
- Yay!
- Awesome, so the plum pumpkin
snack bars, that's a win.
All right, next up, I have pumpkin butter-
- Ooh!
- Which I'm actually
really excited about this.
My mom used to make this every fall,
and she would jar it all up, and we'd
eat it for, like, the whole season.
And it's basically,
like, a pumpkin spread.
You put it on, like,
bagels or, like, toast
with butter and pumpkin butter.
So, it really looks quite appetizing,
as you can tell. (laughs)
It's interesting.
Ooh.
- Spicy?
- It's really spicy, does it have-
- I feel like I can-
- The apples in it?
- Smell it from here.
- Doesn't have apple.
- Is it like a
weird texture, too?
- Yeah, it's a really weird texture.
That's a weird one, for sure.
- Smell, it kind of-
- It might be good on,
uh, like, toast.
- It kind of has a baby food texture.
- Yeah, it really does.
- I'm sure there's better
pumpkin butters out there.
- Yeah, the kind my mom used to
make is a lot better than that.
All right, next up, we have belVita
pumpkin spice crackers.
- I'm interested.
- Are these sweet, are they spicy?
I'm so confused, so let's
open these up and try them.
Oh, look at that, they
look like harvest crackers.
That's interesting.
Fin's our little taste-tester.
Ollie, you wanna try a cracker, no?
- They're like a graham cracker.
- He's still eating that nasty cookie.
- What is this?
- That tastes like-
- Cardboard again?
- Paper? (Missy laughs)
- Not good.
- You can't pumpkin spice-
- Like, maybe-
- Everything, you guys. (Oliver coughs)
- Maybe if you were, like, drinking,
like, a pumpkin spice
coffee. (Oliver coughs)
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like, this would be good.
- Which leaves us pumpkin
spice biscotti, which,
um, I bet is actually
really good in coffee.
I like biscotti in my coffee-
- But you can have it.
- But I might try this
one just plain on its own.
It looks like a normal
biscotti, but it has,
like, a pumpkin glaze on it.
Mm, that's really good.
That's, like, a better pumpkin cookie
than the actual pumpkin cookie.
- Yeah, the top stuff is good.
- Yeah.
All right, Missy is going to try
the Reese's pumpkin peanut butter candy.
- I originally thought this was
peanut butter pumpkin
flavor, but it's not.
- Oh, it's not?
- I don't know.
- Just try it, let's see.
- At first, I thought
it was, but let's see.
It's white?
This isn't a Reese's!
So, it's a pumpkin.
- Oh, it's pumpkin-shaped,
that's cheating.
(Missy laughs) Okay, take a bite.
Is it even orange inside?
Well, I guess it's
peanut butter-y. (laughs)
- It's definitely not pumpkin flavor,
but the white is not as good as the dark.
- Yeah, of Reese's?
- Yeah.
- So that was our, uh, pumpkin
spice taste test challenge.
We did pretty good, there
was some cool products on it.
- I know, the ice cream-
- Some weird ones.
- Was pretty good.
- Yeah, some
other weird ones, too, though. (laughs)
Let us down below, though, the craziest
thing that you have ever seen
with a pumpkin spice flavor, or what
pumpkin spice thing you
think we should try next.
Good job, boys!
- Yeah, that was fun, huh?
Did you like trying all the pumpkin stuff?
- Yeah, I do like the donuts.
-  You do like the donuts?
(laughs) He's sneaking donuts.
Oh my gosh, you guys, look at
my cute little package-getter.
Thanks, buddy!
- You're welcome.
- You're such a good
boy, I love you. (laughs)
It's actually quite convenient
that a lot of my equipment, when it comes,
they drop it off right
here, near my office door,
but the boys are always so excited
to bring in packages and stuff.
It's been really cute.
It's seriously such a
beautiful day, you guys.
Oh my gosh.
(peaceful acoustic guitar music)
(record scratch)
(epic orchestral music)
We got a couple of Batmans.
-  Fin, say, "I'm Batman!"
- No, I'm Batman!
- I think you're both Batman. (laughs)
Cool pajamas, bro.
It's calendar time.
We gotta grab some candy from
our local skeleton.
- Me, me, me, me!
- Gotta get it from the number two.
You know where the number two is?
- Is this one right?
- Nope, it's up at the top.
- That is a two, but that's 12.
There you go!
- Good job!
- Now you guys get yo candy.
- Ooh ah!
- Happy Halloween, boys!
Almost.
- Ooh, oh, we got double red.
- Double red!
That's good luck, that's good luck.
- Yeah.
(peaceful acoustic music)
(electropop music)
