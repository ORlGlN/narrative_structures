-  Oh! You guys
played so well together
Oh, they might be going down.
- How come you and I
don't ever hug like that?
- (Missy) Oliver, Finley.
(upbeat music)
(laughter)
(playful melody)
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I want to be
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ This is home
♫ Just running around
you've never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight,
cuddling all I could saying
♫ I am home
♫ Home's wherever you're with me
- Good morning!
What? That was not good
morning, you've got shoes on?
Guys my hair is like super curly today
But good morning, we are up this morning
the boys are dressed, and
where we going out Finny?
- Billy Beez with Jackson!
That's for later!
They're so excited, we are doing,
going to see someone special later today
We're gonna have a lot of fun though
but first, the gym
- Yes
- K, Mama's gotta go work out (laughs)
I'm gonna go run on the treadmill
I've been feeling pretty good guys
I've been going to the gym
almost every single day
I went to the gym yesterday
and I had a personal trainer
and it was rough, and my
arms are definitely killing
and there's parts of me that I'm like
I'm in so much pain, but I'm
definitely gonna go today
I'm just gonna go do a
couple miles on the treadmill
and what's cool is the
boys are coming with me.
They're being a little naughty right now
(laughs) taking apart the couch
but they're coming with me
because they have a really fun
little play center at the gym,
which is why I chose this gym
because being a mom it is
really hard to go to the gym
especially when you have kids
that are with you all day long
and so I was like, if I can
just take them somewhere
where they can play while I work out,
all my worries and troubles
will be not really a thing
because that's the biggest thing is like
leaving the kids here, like
Bryan is always working
like right now he is in
his office, he's working
and he can not really just watch the kids
I get to take them with me
By the way Ollie, you're
getting really close
to filling up your jar
of cotton balls huh!
So as you guys know, we are
doing, we brought this back
if you don't know what it
is, basically he has all his
rules of things that we do
and things that we don't do.
He's got cards so that
if he does get in trouble
he goes to like a warning
if he does something wrong
again there's a time out
and it goes all the way up to
like taking privileges away
bedtime early, stuff like that.
As long he doesn't have
to flip any cards in a day
he gets to put two balls at the
end of the day into his jar.
Yesterday, he was a very very good boy
so he gets to put two balls in his jar
Yay, and look how many he has left,
just three, three balls!
It is basically full, but
we basically have to move
all these into here, and
then once it's all full
he gets to pick out a very special toy
and he has been saving up, saving up
and every once in a while
he gets an extra cotton ball
if he did something really really good.
So every once in a while when
he does really really good,
we give him one extra little ball,
so right now he has three balls left,
so if he does something really good today,
he might get three balls
in his jar tomorrow
and then he can go pick out a toy.
So he's super duper excited.
Alright boys, we got to go
though, Mama's gotta go!
- (over the phone) What are you doing?
- (Missy) Who you talking to Ollie?
- (Ollie) Auntie
- (Missy) Auntie? Say Hi!
- Hi guys!
Hey little dude, you look
so handsome, you both do.
- (Missy) Auntie's gonna show
them something real quick
- (Auntie) Ew papa has to eat that, ew.
- Is that funny?
Auntie is doing a little editing right now
of a hilarious video
that she did with my dad
and whenever my dad's in
her videos, he is hysterical
and this one in particular
is very funny and disgusting
so she was just showing
them a piece of it,
but if you guys want to see it,
it's up on her channel right now,
make sure you go check that iCard
and go subscribe while you're there
and it's supposed to
be a super funny video
ight Cassie? Ollie show me Auntie
- (Cassie ) Yes
It's been so hard to edit
for not even 30 minutes long
- (Missy) Because dad's just so funny
- Finn, don't cry this time, okay Finn?
- (Missy) K Finny? No crying
this time let's go, bye!
(upbeat music)
Alright I ran a mile and a half
and I ended up accidentally
erasing what I had done but
it was a mile and a half
and I'm gonna go pick up the boys.
They actually close early
that's why I had to stop though
Just in time. Ollie! Finn!
Hi boys, did you have fun?
- Yeah!
- (Missy) Well I'm back let's go.
Say bye! Thank you.
Alright that was a pretty
quick but fun workout
I had no idea that the kids
area closed early today
but I got like 30 minutes in,
which is better than nothing
I kind of have to go pretty soon anyways
cause were heading out of
town to go meet up with
some people, yeah Jackson.
It was a fun but quick one.
Ran a mile and a half which
it's okay, it's pretty good
I mean I could have done
better, but whatever
I was also trying to vlog it for you guys
so that was like really distracting,
I was like trying to find
places to put the camera
so you guys could see it all.
Now we have to run to
the store really quick
grab a few little groceries that we need
and head home, then head out of town.
Are you excited?
- Yeah!
- And you guys did so
good at the playground
I'm so happy, thank you. Oh
he's meditating, hang on.
So cute, alright let's go to the store, k.
- Hey dude
- Hey
- Did you just take the best
nap ever on the way here?
Yeah, so where are we?
- Billy Beez!
- We're at Billy Beez! And
who are we going to see here?
- Jackson
- Jackson and Calvin
- Yeah!
- And I get to see my buddy
Jared. Are you so excited?
- Yeah!
- What are you going
to do when you see him?
- I'm gonna give him big hugs
- Big hug, anything else?
- Big kiss
- You're going to give
him a kiss too? (laughs)
Aw I'm so excited, Jared
and Ellie just randomly
were going to be down here for something.
We decided to meet and have a
place where the kids can play
and we're probably gonna get
some food and have fun, huh.
- You're the beautiful Mama
- Thank you I love you
- (Bryan) He's so cute, he's
always calling you beautiful
You're the beautiful too Finn, k?
Finn's the beautiful, right?
- Where is Billy Beez?
- Where is Billy Beez, let's find out.
(playful music)
So we're currently looking
for Ellie and Jared
and I think they may have left their mark
on this community chalkboard.
- It's a clue!
- It's a clue!
We're tracking them, huh?
- Yeah!
- Do you know what this is Ollie?
- What?
- It's an E for Ellie and a J for Jared
So they did E plus J, they've
been here they just did that
We have found Billy Beez, yay!
(exciting music)
Excuse me sir, I don't
think you're supposed to be
climbing the slide, what's up Calvin!
How's it going dude?
Oh! Say hi Calvin!
- Hi Calvin
- Oh hey!
- Hey! How are you?
- What's up dude?
- How's it going?
- Good
- Ellie what's up!
Aw, and kisses even you guys are so sweet
Yeah, go play kiddos. These
two are already up to something
What are we doing guys?
- We're going on a mission
- A mission? Finn are you
gonna go on the mission too?
Yeah, look at him crossing that.
(exciting music)
- I'm staying back to hang out with Finn,
because he's a little slower
and I've seen to have
lost all of the boys.
So I'm assuming they're this way
Do you want to go down
the slide with daddy?
- Yeah
- We are going on a
mission to find the dragon
- Okay, Finn we're gonna
go find dragons, okay?
Let's go find dragons. Giant slide!
Oh hey (laughs), that was fun.
Come on Finn, on his belly (laughs)
Well that's one way to do it
Can't fit through them
like we used to Jared
- They don't make them fun anymore!
I want to have fun, but
it's a really hard time
- Nothing like going
to a indoor playground
to show you how out of shape you are.
Can we all just appreciate
Jared's massive camera right now
We've got a three way angle
on this slide you guy's ready?
- 1, 2, 3! (cheers)
- (Bryan) Why are we so cool you guys?
Literally traversing this right now,
through a ropes course,
here we go, I made it.
Trying to find Ollie,
Ollie! He's down there now.
I just climbed all the way
up here, he's down there.
Okay, this is how it is, whoa.
Chasing the kids the whole time.
Who's gonna win? 3, 2, 1, go!
Whoa, you both won, yay!
- That is fast!
- That is really fast.
I got some air, whoa dude.
(playful music)
If you guys can remember we came here once
when Finn was really really little,
and he was terrified going down the slide,
I'll have that video in the iCard
so you guys can check it out
and up there will also be
Ellie and Jared's channel so
you can check out all the fun
from their perspective today
so be sure to go check out that
But yeah, this is super cool,
the kids are having a blast
Oh Ollie, what are you doing kiddo?
- I shooted some balls
- That's so cool so this is
like a whole other level up here
where you can use the
air to shoot the balls
into this cool little gun thing
(laughs) It's a little hard to control.
Alright you aimed and I'll
give you bullets, you ready?
Go go go go go go!
Ellie and Jared are vlogging down there
and I've got this aimed at them.
Sorry, am I getting in your way?
(playful music)
Nice !
Going to attempt the
hamster wheel you guys, whoa
- (ELlie) Jared's going
to still have to push it
- I think I locked myself in, oh my god!
- (Missy) Oh my god!
- Okay Jared you're good
- My turn!
- Watch this
- (Missy) Jackson get back, oh my gosh
- I feel like I'm on the Price is Right
(laughs)
- (Bryan) What's the secret word?
Finn's turn!
Say go mama go go go.
We did it good!
Ollie what are you
dressed up as right now?
Can you check my heartbeat?
Yeah put those in your ears.
There you go, and then check my heartbeat
with your stethoscope,
right here okay? And listen.
(heartbeat)
Do you hear it? Do I have
a heart? It's still there.
- Yeah
- Thank you Dr. Ollie
- (Missy) What is that? Oh, that's so cute
- (Bryan) He's always picking
flowers for the ladies
- Look I saw your picture right here !
- (Bryan) Did you guys
do that? Ellie and Jared
You did the E and J huh?
Kiddos, that's how you
fall into the fountain
Ollie remember when you
fell in that fountain
Oh, it's that one over there
actually that Ollie fell in
Do you remember that?
- Yeah
- If you guys haven't
seen that video of Ollie
falling in the fountain,
I'll have it in the iCard
it's super funny.
(upbeat music)
So we all just had an amazing
dinner at P.F Chang's.
Hey Ollie, did you have so much
fun hanging out with Jackson
- Yeah
- Be sure to give him a big hug
Good to see you dude, aw you
guys played so well together
Oh, they might be going down
- Oh yay!
- That was a cool hang out
bro, I was just saying,
how come you and I don't
ever hug like that.
You know where we just
like wrestle each other
to the ground and
- Snap each other's neck
- Or hurt each other
(playful music)
(laughter)
- We're home, and are you Buzz Lightyear?
We are exhausted, with a super
fun day with Ellie and Jared

and go to bed, so make
sure you give this video

Thumb's up! And we'll
