it's fun and Friday gotta get down on
Friday everybody's looking for cheesy
Dewey again I'm missing a song in a long
time no and Shh always sleeping
sorry I just wanted people to know a day
the week away
this is our son baby boy he's gonna do
amazing things
hey guys so how's it going we're having
a wonderful Friday morning ha it is
starting to get pretty toes yet 83 it
actually feels a lot harder and I think
it's just at the enjoy 0.93 thing is
going to be finally summer I think it's
finally hit us I don't know if we're
going to have very many cool days
anymore else we're moving I think you
staying I think we're not moving I've
got a summer yeah I don't really mind in
the summer out here it's not that bad
but there's like three months out of the
year when we live here I'm just like
Armand la yeah the rest it's not
freezing it's just nice out but how's
the matter where you are is it starting
to get warm out I think people are still
getting like snow
people are getting tornadoes right yeah
I know so bad you guys they said I
couldn't do that I guess we do have the
whole earthquake thing but we already
talked buildings around I've never been
afraid of the earthquakes I don't know
why I have felt one earthquake in my
entire life
it was it scary no very small and it's
kind of fun kind of freak no I want to
take one anyways do you hear I'm hungry
all right
all he is asleep see and we planned it
while he's asleep we can transfer into
the stroller and then maybe we could eat
lunch like normal people would that be
amazing lay this flat you pull this
laying flat it's a little warm so lethal
and that ladies and gentlemen is how
it's done by the way you guys see how
hot my wife is looking today look at
this she's got an American flag on her
shirt you're so patriotic yet it's black
and white cuz she's ironic I was a
little worried about the shirt
oh yeah illegal yeah you're definitely
going to show it's not that right no I
don't think so good there's that forever
21 Robert I don't think they tell us
shirt that was illegal not it wait what
do you mean illegally I don't know
yeah I guess so look guys my burrito is
white I'm not racist Holy One yeah but
miss yours gets flour and Spanish rice
and so I'll try that there's literally a
trillion different combinations you can
do in free words two embryos and I'm
like I should probably start trying a
trillion and it's probably not a
trillion you could probably
mathematically deduce is that a word
deduce is deduce a word deduce the duck
get
I'm looking for a word here you can
probably decide mathematically how many
burrito options there are I do something
a little different and I gotta say it's
really good yeah you do good babe you
make a good burrito just really nice
we're sitting outside eating on and
Ollie is asleep like I saw someone
walking with a little baby carrier you
know if a baby and I was like oh you
think it's easy now
just wait you know I was like oh gosh
I'm becoming that kind of parent but
he's asleep he's doing a little lip
study word up thank you dreams about
breastfeeding gonna sleep it's a perfect
day to set up a little pool and swim out
here although I wish there was something
that like I could sit on but look at
this karma right now is having a little
bonding experience with oli he keeps
giving only his ball to throw it's quite
gross but I kind of don't mind because
it's just so cute watching karma like
ask Olly to throw the ball good boy no
it's like you know I don't want that but
it's out you they're bonding I think
they're bonding huh so anyways yeah it's
really hot so at least if he can go
swimming then that'd be nice you want to
swim all right ooh the flowers I got
Missy like maybe a week ago are dead
kinda sucky but it's funny because like
the last like three days they've smelled
so good and they're like wilting right
but um
you smell really good I don't know is
there like I mean we put the plant food
in there and the water is there
something we're not doing because the
flowers like lost like a week I'm gonna
play some PS Quantrill started
Assassin's Creed started call duty I'm
probably like halfway through call of
duty I'm at a quarter way through
infamous but I really like Assassin's
Creed it's cool getting to like be a
pirate in and like be on a ship and
stuff too so I've definitely been
enjoying Assassin's Creed but if you
have a ps4 let me know what games you

amazing games coming out like watchdogs

dragon one Dragon Age something like
that I've never played those games but
they look awesome alright what do you
think of the pool what do you think
they'd kind of chilly mom

pools that aren't 98 degrees which is
the one it is swim class hey hey where
are you going
ah got his puzzle all right I don't
think this thing works very well see
that's how it supposed to work so cool
and maybe your dog he'll go swimming too
no I think if I was able to get in it
with him he'd be much happier but I
can't said nothing can you guys pick
this up today and you can't really enjoy
it got it's like a four in one type toy
you can just like sit on it or you can
put make it so there's wheels and you
can push him and then soon you can take
little little foot things off and then
he can push himself and I really like it
cuz it's got these handles here so he
can't like fall off you know and you can
just like go on walks with it love it
she they made me push me because it I've
been playing around with Logic Pro X for
about an hour or two and I recorded some
really cool vocals and I'm pretty happy
with how they turned out but I can't
find make any other plugins or the
effects like I know I'm pretty good with
this program but I couldn't find
anything and then I realized that I
never downloaded all the additional
content um so I'm doing that now and
it's 50 gigabytes and it's gonna take
like seven hours I'm gonna go downstairs
