(giggle)
- You're welcome boys.
We always like to bring the
boys goodies after we've
been gone for a while.
Just 'cause I know they did
miss us, it's always fun
to have new goodies.
- So fun.
- Did you get these surprises?
-  We got them from Hawaii.
- Really?
-  Yeah Mommy and
Daddy went to Hawaii all by
ourselves.
- But where did you get them?
- At a store.
- Store?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
(laughing)
-  What did you just do, Ollie?
(laughing)
-  You made a silly dinosaur?
-  That looks so funny.
-  He's got green and orange legs.
(laughing)
(Bryan giggling)
- You think it's so funny huh?
- Yeah.
-  Rawr, the boys are
gonna have so much fun mixing
and matching all these
dinosaurs they have.
(upbeat music)
-  So, Ollie and
Finn did you guys miss us?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, but you we're actually.
(laughing)
- Well you need a head.
- He is so into that.
The boys were not actually home alone.
I thought that I should probably clarify.
Mimi and Papa watched them all week.
And did you guys have
fun with Mimi and Papa?
- We went to Aunties house
and go to Disneyland.
- That's right.
Ollie went to Auntie's house
and went to Disneyland.
If you wanna see her vlog
from that, I'll have it linked
in the icard above, but
that was super cute.
What else did you do Ollie?
(laughing)
-  Oh it's lookin' so silly.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  Whoa, that looks
like a good lookin t-rex, huh?
- Yeah.
-  What else did
you do with Papa, Ollie?
- Um, I just went to
the movie Paddington 2.
-  You saw the new Paddington?
- And then we saw Aquaman.
-  Yeah, Papa took
him to go see Paddington 2,
which he loved and also took
him to see Justice League?
Who approved that? (giggle)
He didn't watch the whole
thing, but he did like Aquaman.
Oh a seashell, nice.
(upbeat music)
Alright, Ollie what
kinda dinosaur is that?
Do you know?
- Stegosaurus.
- Yeah.
-  I think that's
pretty close, huh?
- I want it.
-  What Finn?
- A monster.
- It's a monster?
- Yeah.
- (laugh) A gummy fell outta his mouth.
Look (laugh) he's like
yeah don't worry, I'll take
care of that.
(giggle)
So, yes, we just got back
from out Hawaii trip.
We were actually, we were over
here on the Hawaiian islands.
The boys were over here.
- They boys did amazing the entire trip.
They were so well behaves
and they had a blast with
Mimi and Papa and Missy and I had one of
the best trips ever.
I think it was officially
the best trip ever.
I brought a Go Pro and I
never once picked it up.
I had plans maybe I'd film
some things and we just never
got to it and we just
didn't really want to.
We wanted that time to be
the time that we had together
and alone, not on camera, but
we did Instagram story a lot.
So, if you guys followed us
on Instagram you saw all the
fun that we had.
It was a blast
and very much needed.
But now I feel so much more
refreshed and ready to go.
Ready to tackle some really
big projects we have coming up.
First thing on the to-do
is changing our calendar.
(laugh) Look at all of us
eating breakfast in bed.
I love this picture.
It is no longer January folks.
So, if you've got a Daily
Bumps calender at home, be sure
you flip it to February, ya'll.
By the way, I have a couple
of these in stock still in
the store and we just put up
Valentine's day merch as well.
And we have Valentine's cards
and like a sticker sheet.
It's super cool.
If you guys wanted to get
that before Valentine's Day
make sure you order by February 8th.
The link for the store will
be in the description so you
can check it out,
but yeah, I thought that was so cool.
It is now February and I love
these pictures of the boys
and all of us and Missy, she
looks so beautiful there.
So, let's hang this bad boy.
There.
There we go.
(smooth music)
- Alright boys as you know,
every time Mommy and Daddy leave
Papa takes HayHay and
puts him somewhere new.
So, one time he was above our bed.
- Yes, and then another
time he was up here in this
nook.
- Yeah, up there.
- For probably weeks.
- He was actually up
there for a long time.
You guys might have even
seen him in the vlog.
- So, boys where's the chicken?
- Right there.
- What?
-  What?
-  There's no chicken up there.
- Look!
-  Where would it even?
- Oh my god.
- (yell) What in the world?
(laughing)
- How'd he get up there?
How did that happen, Ollie?
-  How?
- Papa just put him up there.
- Papa?
-  How does Papa do that?
- C'mon, look it, it's zip-tied.
-  (laugh) Yeah.
-  He zip-tied it.
- I mean that was a lot of work.
He had to have got a ladder.
- Yeah.
- Zip-ties.
- Did he just hold you up there to do it?
- No.
- There, can you reach him?
(Missy giggle)
- No.
-  Get 'em.
(Ollie babbling)
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Way too far up there, huh?
- Yeah, HayHay's gonna be up
there until we leave again.
- Yeah.
-  (laughing) Well that's fun, huh?
- Me.
-  You wanna try and get 'em?
- Yeah.
-  (groan) Can you get 'em?
- Alright Finn, reach up.
Reach up, reach.
-  Get 'em.
- Right there.
- I will do that.
-  You already tried.
- Look how attached he is to his monkey.
-  I know, I just.
- Do you love your monkey?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna give him a name?
- Yeah.
- What d'ya wanna name him?
- Wait, name him Cutie.
(Missy laugh)
- Wanna name him Cutie?
- Yeah.
(Missy giggle)
- Cutie the monkey.
- (giggle) We just read the
book that goes along with it.
It's so cute.
They literally talk about
how he's best friends.
-  But, that's not
all who's excited to see us.
Puppies!
- Hi Karma, hi baby.
Oh my.
-  Hi Luna.
- Did you guys take good
care of Karma and Luna?
-  Yeah.
-  They are so excited.
Hi Luna, Hi Karma.
(laugh)
Nothin' like a good ol'
homecomin' from your puppies, huh?
(laugh)
- Aw, stinky breath, stinky dog breath.
-  Hi Luna, aw
look at her she's like
-  Did you miss us?
- Soakin' it in (laugh).
(dog panting)
Hi Luna.
Hi Karma boy.
Did you do okay without us?
(laugh)
- So I actually did come
home to a little bit of a
problem.
One of our chickens which you
guys probably know if you've
been following us.
But, Pam the mom that hatched
like six chickens this
summer has been beat up
really badly by the rooster
Ursula, one of the chicks
turned into a rooster
and it beat up his mom.
So, we're really bummed.
So, Ollie what are we doin'?
- We are gonna clean the chickens.
- Yep, so we're gonna clean her all up.
We've got peroxide, some
cotton balls, we've got some
warm water and the boys are
all gonna help me, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Let's go get her all clean.
So there's Pam and I don't
know if you can tell but her
head has some pretty big owies on it.
I think she's okay, but we
definitely don't want any
infections setting in so we're
gonna get it all cleaned up.
I'm just so bummed she is
just like such a sweet chicken
and for this to happen to her,
it's just like the saddest
thing.
I think she'll be okay.
I think with just like a little
bit of attention and just
you know, she's in a separate
area right now that's clean.
She's got her own food an
water away from the rooster.
He's not picking on any
of the others so I dunno
if he just doesn't like
Pam for some reason.
If we can just get it all
cleaned up and it looking
better before we.
I'll probably end up having
to actually get rid of
the rooster.
So, they probably won't see
each other again until she's
all better and then he'll
be gone by then, so.
(sigh) My poor Pam.
She's such a sweetheart.
You guys wanna give her
some love and comfort?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- 'Kay come give her a,
tell her it's gonna be okay.
- It's gonna be okay Pre-
- Pam. (giggle)
- This.
- Okay so first we're gonna
need some cotton balls and
then can you dip it into
the water for me so we
can get it all clean?
And get it all wet.
Good job.
(soothing music)
(Finn cough)
- Go ahead and spray this
cotton ball with that yeah.
(soothing music)
- It's uh, xray a little bit.
- You wanna xray it?
- Yeah.
- 'Kay
- Looks good.
- 'Kay, let's go and put her back away.
- It's gonna be okay, breath.
-  He's not hung up.
- I mean ham.
-  (laughing) Pam.
Alright boys, how d'ya think she's doin'?
You think she's gonna
make a full recovery?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
I think she's lookin' okay.
It definitely needed a
lot of cleanin' up which
we did.
We got it all cleaned
up with like some water,
some peroxide.
I left some peroxide on that.
I'm gonna put a little bit of
some other stuff that I used
on the horse that my
trainer had told me about.
Sounds like it'd be really
good for something like this.
Like a wound like that.
I'll prolly run up to the barn
either tonight or tomorrow
morning to up that on it.
And they already did get
it cleaned up a bit and put
some stuff on it too.
So, I just kinda wanted to
get it a little bit more on
there, and I'm gonna try
something else in the morning.
Hopefully, she can be
healed up pretty soon.
(soothing music) (kisses)
(kisses) (kids laughing)
(kisses) (kids laughing)
(kisses) (kids laughing)
-  Tickle, tickle tickle
(laughing)
(laughing)
- Alright boys are all ready for bed.
What does that mean?
- No.
- It means go to bed.
- It means go to bed, like right now.
-  Finn, show 'em
how it lights up, buddy.
- How does it light up?
Hit harder.
Oo, that's so neat, huh?
-  Mine's green, guys.
-  Oh yep and
look, and his lights up.
How neato.
- Mine is green and Finn's is orange.
-  Yep.
- Give this video a big
thumbs up if you join it.
-  (giggle) Finn!
-  See ya manana.
-  (laugh) Alright,
Ollie what d'ya say?
- Bye.
(upbeat music)
