-  Good morning!
-  Happy Saint Patrick's Day, Finn!
- Yeah.
(laughter)
- Happy Saint Patrick's Day!
- Yes, we have Auntie over
today.
- Hey!
- Are you guys excited
to do a fun challenge?
- Yeah!
- Yay!
♪ Just shine ♪
♪ This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
-  Alright, we
are going to make some
delicious pancakes.
And look what we have here!
- Woo!
-  We've got
some little leprechauns!
I guess you guys are like
viking leprechauns? (laughs)
- Leprechaun vikings?
- Yeah I don't know,
but you guys look so cute!
Hey look, and I've got a little
leprechaun over here, too!
And I'm wearing a little
green bow and a necklace
that says lucky 'cause
I'm so lucky to be a mama
of these cute little boys, huh?
- Yeah.
(Missy laughs)
(upbeat music)
- Alright, if you haven't guessed yet,
the challenge that we are
doing is a Saint Patrick's Day
pancake art challenge!
- Woo!
(cheering)
- Woo!
- We've done a few of these, actually.
We've done a Halloween one, I
think we did a Christmas one,
we've done other random ones.
So I'll have a link up
here that you can click on
to go check them all out.
Auntie is going to help us.
Are you guys gonna make some fun art too?
- Yeah!
-  We gotta make all
the Saint Patrick's Day stuff.
- Yeah!
(Finn babbling)
-  And so we've got
red and yellow and orange.
We've got a couple different greens here.
We have brown.
The only color that we're
missing that I think we need is
- Black.
Black.
- Obviously!
- So, we actually don't have
any black food coloring,
so we're going to attempt ourselves
to make black. (laughs)
- We're just going to mix all
the colors together and
hope it makes a black.
- So we are gonna ahead
and mix a few drops of red.
One, two, three, four.
-  We're gonna try to
make it as even as possible.
- And then four drops of blue.
Two, three, four.
Four drops of green.
-  How do you guys
think it's gonna turn out?
Do you think it's going to be black?
- Yeah!
- I think it's gonna be
yellow.
(Auntie laughs)
-  Oo, and this is what color?
-  Green.
Two, three, four.
(Finn babbling)
-  Alright,
let's hope for the best.
-  See what we got.
-  Can I have this please?
- No.
- Wow!
(Auntie laughs)
- Oh God.
- Wow, it's...
(Finn babbling)
Wait for it!
- It looks like cotton candy.
-  Ew, it looks... (laughs)
- Well, that's gray.
- Gray is close, okay?
- That's like a gray.
We get the hint, right?
- Maybe if we just add a few
more drops of everything,
we'll get black.
Alright, we are all set up
and we've got all our colors.
We basically made a gray?
This is black.
- It's like a dust. (laughs)
- Does this look like black to you?
- No, it looks like dirt.
- Dirt, okay.
We're gonna work with that, what we have.
We've got all our colors now
and so we're gonna go ahead
and do a challenge.
It's going to be Missy
versus Auntie and Ollie.
- Woohoo!
- Are you going to help out?
- Yeah!
- Finn went ahead and checked out,
(laughter)
which was fine with me.
He was like, "I don't want to do this."
So we've got our grill
all ready to go.
- Hot!
- We are going to make some
fun Saint Patrick's art,
right now!
You ready?
- Yeah!
- Woo!
- Yay!
What should be the first
thing that we make?
- A Patrick's Day spider.
- No, that's Halloween!
(laughter)
How about for the first
thing we're going to make is
a pot of gold?
- Yeah!
- You wanna make--
- Yeah,
that sounds good.
- A pot of gold?
Okay, so we're gonna go
ahead and make a pot of gold.
Are you guys ready?
- Yeah.
- Get set, go!
(traditional Irish music)
- No, I want to do it on you!
- No, no!
My team player is not working with me.
- Alright, I'm done with mine,
We just gotta flip it.
(Auntie groans)
What is happening here? (laughs)
- I don't know!
Leave me alone.
- Alright, are you ready?
- Yep.
- Ready for this masterpiece?
-  Flip!
Woohoo!
- All good?
- Yeah.
- Okay, woo!
Yeah, I flipped it.
I feel like Cassie just realized why
she hates doing this game with me.
- This is why I don't like this game.
I remember now.
I think I'm just at a
disadvantage sometimes.
- How are you at a disadvantage?
- I think we were raised differently.
- I mean, we've got a rainbow and what's
at the end of a pot of
gold or of a rainbow?
A pot of gold.
- Well, mine is, kind of looks like a boat
from this direction.
What do you say?
- It looks good?
- Yeah.
- Who do you think's
better, Mommy's or mine?
- Mommy and yours.
- Aww! Alright, guys, leave down below.
Who do you think did better on this round?
Round one, pot of gold.
- Don't choose Missy, choose Ollie.
Not me,
(laughs)
you're not voting for me,
you're voting against Ollie.
- Round two, what should we make?
- A four leaf clover.
- A four leaf clover?
- Yeah.
- Okay, if I make a four leaf
clover, you have to eat it,
kay?
- No!
(laughing)
- It's going to be hot!
- We'll let it cool down, okay?
On your mark,
get set,
go!
- That's a three leaf clover!
Shoot!
 -Missy's got an eight leaf clover,
so we're good.
- Hold on, this is one.
- This is not working for me.
This is not working for me!
- You know, I had a better
intentions, I'm not going to lie,
but, you know it is
what it is.
- Four leaf clovers are
really, really hard to do.
- Is it just hard because you
didn't nail it the first time?
- I don't even think that I know how to
draw a four leaf clover at all.
- I even looked it up beforehand
and I still didn't do what I was hoping.
- I just keep making mine bigger. (laughs)
Go big or go home.
What is that?
- What is that? (laughs)
- It just looks like 'splat!'
-  It's Nickelodeon Splat.
- Leave me alone!
- She's just creating pancake slime.
- Yeah.
- Son of gun, no, no!
- No!
- Thank you for dramatic effect.
It broke.
- Now we can, oh!
It still fell apart.
- It fell apart.
- Oh it fell apart!
- Shoot.
Okay, you know what?
That was just an extra anyways, okay?
- In a way, yours might
be a little bit better.
(laughter)
Just by a little bit though,
alright?
- Okay, we'll just take
the stem off, you know, no
one needed the stem.
It was just extra, it
was just extra points.
- Yeah, whatever.
Okay, here we go.
- Okay, who's four leaf clover is better?
I mean, these both really suck, so
you really don't have
a lot to choose from.
- No, Missy's won.
- Alright, round two.
Let us know down in the comments,
who do you think did a better job?
I mean, if all the comments say Missy,
then I won't be upset.
No.
Alright guys, it is time for round three
and I'm just going to
give Ollie the chance,
do you want to stay on
Auntie's team at this point?
Or would you like to come to Mommy's team?
- Your team!
- Oh! (laughs)
Do you want to switch teams
because you know she's
gonna lose? (laughs)
- Go, I don't want you
on my team anyways now.
- Woohoo, alright, you can
stand between us actually.
That sound good?
- Yeah.
Your team and your team, Mama.
- Alright, you can be on both our teams.
Muah!
For round three, we are
going to make a hat.
A leprechaun hat.
You guys know what that looks like?
- That was my cheat sheet.
- Wow, she's cheating already.
- Don't give away my cheat sheet.
Who's team are you on?
- He's like, this is what it looks like.
Okay, on your marks,
get set,
go!
- I got a good bace.
- Just put a flower on
it, cause that's a thing,
you need to put a flower on it.
And a belt.
(laughs)
- No, you have to do a belt on
it, just like what Auntie is.
- Wow, changing your color up, huh?
- Yeah, are you jealous?
- Aw, thank you.
- Thanks, buddy, you're so sweet.
- What if?
- Okay, that looks like nothing. (laughs)
- I mean, when you flip it,
it's definitely going to come apart.
- Cassie! (laughs)
- I'm just gonna go
- No my gosh.
through with it.
- Oh, That looks good!
- Thank you.
- It fell apart.
- It's a little off.
- It fell apart,
but that's okay.
- Whoo!
That was awesome!
- Yay!
- What do you think, bud?
- Good.
- Alright guys, here
is our leprechaun hat.
This one's mine and this one's Auntie's.
Let us know down below,
who do you think won?
This was a good one.
This was good.
- This was not that bad, okay.
- Honestly, the color on
Cassie's is pretty good.
Shape on mine is better.
- Yeah, but...
- I mean, whatever.
- You know what? I couldn't
really control the color,
though, whereas I could
have controlled the shape if
I had known how to do it,
so.
- Yes.
Alright, guys, it is the
last and final round.
Round four!
Do you know what the next
one we're going to do is?
- Yeah.
- What is it?
- A horseshoe.
- A horse shoot?
(laughs)
We're going to do a horseshoe, okay?
- Now, is this a shoe
that goes on a horse?
- Yeah.
- Okay, just making sure.
- Alright, on your marks, get set, go!
- Is that red?
It looks a little bit red.
- That's a lot of yellow.
- And the red looks like barbecue mustard.
- Like ketchup, kind of?
- Ketchup, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Cassie, is your hand cramping?
- Yup.
I'm just pushing through it, though.
- We're going for it.
- Woo!
- Woo!
- Ready, oh!
Whoo!
(clapping)
Oh, wow!
- Oh yeah, okay.
- Don't touch it, hot!
- It's okay, it's not.
- That is pretty dang good.
- I think they both did really good.
This is going to be another tough one.
- I know, you guys, this
might be like our tiebreaker?
This might actually be a tie.
Alright, here's round four, horseshoe.
This is mine and this is Auntie's.
Let us know down below, round four.
Who won?
And let us know, overall,
who did the best job?
These look really, really good.
Do you think these look good?
- Yeah.
- Okay,
if you had to pick someone,
who do you think did better?
- You and you.
- No, you have to actually
choose, which one?
Which one is your
favorite of all of these?
- The rainbow one.
- Awww, that's me, yay!
- Aww!
- And yours! (laughs)
- Thank you!
- See, he doesn't want to
hurt anyone's feelings.
- Look who decided to join us!
Do you want to pick your
favorite pancake, Finley?
(whines)
Which one's
your favorite of all of them?
Which one's your favorite?
You've got pot of gold,

Which one,

- That one.

- That one?
You like Auntie's?
Woohoo!
- But, do you like Mama's, too?
- No.
(laughter)

Finn's point.
Alright, I think Finn wants
to start making his own
pancake art, huh?
(mumbles)
