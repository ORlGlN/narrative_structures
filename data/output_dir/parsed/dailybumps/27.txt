you want to go meet her?
- Yeah.
- Let's go see.

- Ahh, good morning Ollie.
(laughs)
You're really playing up that
whole sleeping thing, huh?
Oh good morning guys, we
are so tired this morning.
I went to bed, like, super
late, and then Finn decided
to wake me and Ollie up super early,
and would not let us go back to bed, huh?
Ollie has never, like, been
so tired going to school.
He usually is, like, up and awake,
and the whole time he's
sitting there like,
"Mama, I'm so tired."
And it is freezing.
I'm wearing a beanie today
because it is literally freezing.
It has been in the 20s at night.
Like, so cold that if it
were to rain it would snow.
Which is a very, it
won't, because it doesn't
really rain here, but the
fact that it's cold enough
that if it did rain it would snow
is absolutely insane for California.
And so it is actually in
the high 30s right now.
Like, I don't even have the clothing
to support that kind of weather.
(laughs)
Ollie's got a couple
layers of clothes too.
Plus you've got a nice,
warm classroom, huh?
Anyways, yeah we have a fun day planned.
I forgot my camera again,
I keep forgetting it.
I am just the worst vlogger right now,
but I am vlogging on my phone.
And I am going to make
sure that all the footage
that I shoot on my phone gets uploaded,
because the other day when
I was vlogging on my phone
there was so much footage that I uploaded
using my phone to Dropbox so
Bryan could edit it and all
and I thought it all went
through, and he edited the vlog
and I watched it after
it went up, and I'm like,
"Where's all that footage?"
And none of it made it
through, and I'm so sad.
I went back and saw that all the footage
that I was uploading to
Dropbox for him wasn't there
because it just stopped working
it was just so much footage.
So you guys actually missed out on a ton
of really cute footage the other day
because I vlogged on my phone.
So I'm not gonna let that happen today.
I'm gonna make sure all
of this footage gets sent.
We are off for a fun, fun day.
Look, today's the letter Q, huh?
- Yeah.
-  You getting
out of your seatbelt?
Q for?
- P.
- Queen!
- Queen.
- Queen.
Okay Ollie, you got your shared toy?
What are you sharing today?
- A puzzle of magnets.
- It's magnets that start with a Q, right?
- Yeah.
- So, he's sharing, like, a queen,
the letter Q, and a couple
other cute little magnets.
And hey Ollie, what do you think of this
freezing cold weather?
- Not good.
- Not good, he's a Cali boy, guys.
I was telling him this morning,
Mommy and Daddy are from Idaho.
Did you know in Idaho we had
to go to school in the snow?
- Yeah.
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah.
- We used to have to drive
to school in the snow.
I got my camera!
I ran home to get my camera
and I'm actually headed
to the barn to go get some
horseback riding lessons.
So I'm going to do English
horseback riding lessons.
And I'm really super excited.
I feel like, it's because it's my horse
I have like a lot more
confidence about it all.
(sighs) I've got a very
busy day ahead of me.
I just got done with my horse riding
lesson which went so good.
I was so cold and, like, my head was just
dripping sweat and I have
a beanie and helmet on
and my nose was, like, dripping.
But it was so, so fun.
Honestly, I've learned so much
just from that one lesson.
And I feel like I finally have
the horse, my horse, back.
Cause, like, he's not limping anymore,
he doesn't have any, like, feet problems.
His hives, that were never really
bothering him are finally gone.
His back issues are fine.
He got a massage, so he's feeling great.
Ah, It's just so nice and
he was doing so, so good.
And I was doing good, so it was so fun.
But now I'm actually--
Ah, I forgot my hair.
Shoot! (laughs)
I'm actually getting my
hair done really quick.
And she's going to put
my little hair piece in.
Which is something that
I've vlogged about, like,
a few days ago and I think you saw, like,
the second part of it,
of me putting it in.
But you didn't see me
doing it the other day.
So, I gotta go get it, I forgot it, shoot!
Alright, got my hair,
we're good to go. (laughs)
Oh hey Ollie.
- Hi.
- How was school?
- Good.
- I'm done with my hair,
look, now it's long!
And I picked this guy up.
Look how cute you're looking.
He's got a little rhinosaur
jacket, from Target.
- Yeah!
- Looks so cool.
And I'm actually meeting
my dad at Home Depot.
He's got Finn and he's
looking for some stuff
to build for me for my horse.
So I'm going to go meet up with him
and see if he's found anything cool.
Alright, keep your eyes out, okay?
We've got to find Papa.
Where is he?
Hmmm, is he down here?
Nope.
Is he down here?
Nope.
Ollie I think I see him, do you see him?
Say Papa Marco!
- Papa Marco!
(upbeat music)
- Yay, we found you!
Have you been having fun with Papa?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
I actually have some really cute footage
of them hanging out, so I'm
gonna put it in right now.
(upbeat music)
-  What are you
thinking about, Mom?
- Yeah.
-  They're pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
- There's momma.
-  No, that's not mom over there.
That's McDonald's, but close,
they're both pretty cool.
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- That kid is out.
I'm going to let him sleep
for just a few minutes
with the door open so I can hear him,
but he was so tired, which I'm tired too
because I had to get up at 5 a.m.,
because he woke up at 5 a.m.
Ollie's been up since 5
a.m. because he wouldn't
let either of us fall back to sleep, huh?
So he's going to sleep for a few minutes
and Ollie is going to try and put together
(gasps) this Lego set.
Do you think you can do it by yourself?
- No, I don't know.
- It actually says it's for
kids from four to seven.
And you're four, so you might
be able to do a lot of it,
but momma will help you, okay?
- Okay.
- Ollie, you are doing such a good job
of putting this all together.
He just built this all by himself.
I did tell him what to
find, but he found it
and then he followed the instructions
on exactly what to do and
now you're putting on that?
Is that where it says to go?
Oh, yes it is, you're so smart!
(laughs) You've gotten so smart.
I'm so proud of you.
- Oh hey guy.
Currently Ollie is
slaying this Lego build.
It's for the mountain
police chase helicopter.
This is so cool that he's
able to do these ones now.
- I know, he definitely
needs a little direction,
but not much, he's literally
just looking at the picture
and he's like, "This is where it goes."
-  That's awesome dude.
(exclaims happily)
- Alright Ollie, you got
the base all figured out.
What is the next step?
- Um, this.
-  Yeah, what are
you going to do with it?
- I'm gonna put it on.
- Snap it on there, good job.
That's awesome dude, is it fun?
(upbeat music)
You did it Ollie, show me your helicopter.
That is so cool, I'm
so proud of you buddy.
And it's got a cool chain?
- Yeah.
- Right on.
Alright so today is very
exciting because we have
something very cool to show you guys.
Ollie, what are we going
to show them today?
- We got a new pet fishy!
- That's right we did!
And it is probably one
of the coolest things
we have in our aquarium right now.
And here he is, it's a starfish!
He is a pink little starfish.
He's about yea big, and he
has so much personality.
Right babe?
- Yes!
- It's crazy.
- Like, he crawls all over this tank.
A minute ago he was
doing a little backbend.
- Yeah, he's like trying
to escape. (laughs)
- He hasn't, but he's got--
-  I want to feel it.
- You can pet him.
-  Do you want to pet him Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, pet the new starfish.
Alright Ollie, you want to
tell them what we named him?
- We named him Patrick.
-  That's right, Patrick Star.
- We actually have had
another starfish in here.
-  We've had two.
- Two starfish in here
that we never named,
and I feel like because
we didn't name them
they did not last very long.
-  Yeah. (laughs)
- So this time I got this
guy in here and I was like,
"We need to name him right away,"
and we chose the most cliche
starfish name you could.
You gotta be very careful.
-  I know and you're petting him.
That's so cool, huh Ollie?
(upbeat music)
But otherwise all of our fishy
friends have been doing so good.
All of our fish are getting huge.
And all of our little plants and corals
and stuff are doing so good.
And I think it's getting time
to add a bunch more stuff.
So I think he's actually going to be here
in a couple of days and he's going to add
some more cool stuff to the aquarium.
What do you got Finnie?
- Mom!
- That's so cool, is that like an ATV?
- Yeah.
- Zoom.
So far we are in the
stage where Ollie loves
putting Legos together and
Finn loves destroying them.
Right Finn?
(Missy laughs)
- Yeah.
- So I have been doing a little
cleaning in the boy's room.
And I must say, a lot of overdue cleaning.
Their closet has been crazy for months,
and I just went through it,
and check out the aftermath.
Aah, that is so much clothes!
Ollie said, "Mama, why are you getting rid
"of all my clothes, I'm not
gonna have anything to wear."
But I left you plenty of clothes, okay?
So I've got some of
Ollie's clothes that are
too big for him or sorry,
too little for him,
but too big for Finn, so
I'll have to put those away.
And then I'll put all of
Finn's little clothes away
for maybe another baby boy.
Cause Ollie was like, "What are you going
"to do with these?"
I was like, "Well, we might
have another boy," huh?
And then he's gonna wear all
of yours and Finn's clothes.
- Or a baby girl.
- Yeah, or a baby girl, you never know.
So what's interesting is that if we have
another baby boy eventually,
he'll get Finn's clothes as he gets older.
And then when he gets
even older he'll end up
getting Ollie's clothes,
which look exactly the same.
So he'll have probably
double of all the clothes
because they wear the same clothes.
And so he'll be like
wearing this one shirt at 2T
and then when he gets to 3T
he'll be wearing the same shirt.
So, it's kind of funny if
it does work like that.
But who knows?
Maybe we'll have a girl and actually
some of these clothes may
end up going to her too
because not all of them is
just, like, boy clothes.
But their closet looks
so much more organized.
We've got their short-sleeved shirts,
the long-sleeved shirts,
pajamas, sweaters,
and their pants are all organized.
And it feels really good
to have it all cleaned up.
Now I just gotta do my closet,
which is like, a whole other thing.
- So the boys are getting ready for bed,
and I completely spaced,
but we were having our fish
tank maintenanced today
and they dropped off the new fish,
and I am so excited to tell the new boys.
- Hey Daddy.
-  Hey dude, guess what?
- What?
-  We got a new fish.
Do you want to go meet her?
- Yeah.
-  Let's go see.
Go go go go go go go go go go go!
They are rocking their Mickey
and the Roadster Racers
pajamas and they're
matching and it's so cute.
Come on, come on, let's go see Finn.
Do you know what it is Ollie?
- Oh, there's it is.
-  There it is!
That's our other new fishy friend.
My lights are on, like, full blast,
so you can't really tell the color,
but we got a blue tang.
It's our own little version of Dory.
-  Dory!
-  Yay.
She's so cute, huh boys?
Alright you guys, what should
we name our new blue tang?
- Uh, dah.
- Dory, aww.
- I want to name it, uh, SpongeBob.
-  SpongeBob?!
- Yeah.
- But Ollie, guess what?
I was actually just
asking our fish tank guy
if we can get an actual sponge,
and he said yes, we can.
- So then we could name
the sponge SpongeBob.
- Yeah.
I think we should just have our Dory, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- We've been wanting a blue
tang since we had our tank
and they are very hard to come by,
so we have waited a very long time.
- I know.
-  And we finally
have one of our own.
- Now we just need an actual Nemo.
-  I know. (laughs)
- I know and I think that,
what was the star's name in--
-  Pearl.
- Oh.
-  Pearl in Finding Nemo, yeah.
But we already have our Pearl.
-  Yeah, Pearl's down there.
- Patrick, Dory, Dude.
We got a good little fish family going on.
Alright boys, say goodnight to Dory.
- Goodnight Dory.
- Goodnight Dory.
- Goodnight SpongeBob. (laughs)
- You are so funny.
(ambient music)
- Hi guys, it's me Patrick.
I'm gonna end today's vlog.
If you enjoyed it, be sure
to give it a big fin up
and subscribe for new videos all the time.
Remember, anything is possible
if you don't trout yourself.
Hahaha, these fish puns
are cracking me up, bye!
