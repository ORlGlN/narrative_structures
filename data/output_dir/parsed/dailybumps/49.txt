- Not the best way to start the new year,
you guys, with a fire in your backyard.

-  Good morning.
- Finn was on the other side of the table
and he was like, Mom, wait.
He wanted to come over here and say
good morning, huh?
- Yeah.
- The boys today saw
our leftover gingerbread
house kits and all the
stuff that we had for it
and they just wanted to
make gingerbread houses
so badly that I went
ahead and broke it out.
And I was actually kind of excited
because I didn't really get to participate
in the gingerbread
house contest this year.
There was just a lot going on.
Oh no, mine's falling apart!
And I just could not get mine standing,
and I'm like determined
that I will get it standing this time.
Hang on.
All right, so Ollie has been working
on his house.
Tell me everything about your house.
- So this is Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus.
-  Okay.
- And all of
these are the elves
and these are the tree thingies.
-  Okay.
- And then the star.
-  Okay.
- And a puppy dog that got lost.
-  Oh my goodness, puppy dog.
- And then these are all the balls.
-  Oh, okay, wow.
(screams)
Ah, he's falling over!
(Missy laughs)
And I have to show you Finn's masterpiece.
He's really proud of it.
Oh no, his little house is falling off.
You know, he just has big
blobs of icing, right?
- Yeah.
-  And he's fish and a couple
little gummy worms and
it looks super cute.
I love these 'cause they're just so tiny.
They're perfect for the kids to decorate,
not too overwhelming,
and mainly all I was doing was trying
to tell Finn not to eat the candy
and to use it decorate. (laughs)
But mine's actually holding up, yay!
I can't wait to see it all done.
- Good morning, you guys.
So Mimi and Papa just drove up the house
and they told us to come outside
and look.
It's kind of a little scary.
I don't know if you guys can see,
but basically that lot of land
just across the street from us in on fire,
and it was right next to the road, right?
- Oh yeah, all next to the road.
We literally, my window was hot
just trying to drive past it.
-  Driving up here.
- I could have reached out
and touched the flames,
that's how close it was to the road.
- And there's not very
many road up to the house,
so we're really kind of --
-  That's our main road.
- That's our main road.
- I don't think you're gonna be able
to go that way as of right now.
-  Yeah.
-  I'm surprised we even got here.
-  Yeah, I mean, this
fire truck's just got there.
-  There was one
truck when we pulled up.
-  Oh yeah, look, you can see
the fire trucks from here.
-  That house right there,
they have fire on their land.
-  I'm texting her right now.
-  Here comes a helicopter.
-  Hey, hey, hey!
-  We've never had
a helicopter that close
to us. have we, Ollie?
- Yeah.
Wish I could get in that.
-  Missy, do you think
we're gonna get evacuated?
- Um, we could get evacuated.
I don't think it's gonna get on our --
I don't think our house
is gonna burn down.
-  There's very little wind.
-  Yeah.
-  But I think --
-  White smoke is good, right?
-  Yeah, white smoke is good.
-  They're putting it out?
-  I see the black up there.
(dramatic music)
(neighbors all talking indistinctly)
- Okay, that helicopter
literally just landed
in our neighbor's property.
Do you think that was Life Flight?
- That looked like Life Flight.
Like maybe there's an injury.
-  Oh my gosh.
This is really, really
close to us, you guys.
This is probably one of the closest fires
we've had to us all year, and of course
it had to happen on the
last day of the year.
So we're gonna see if we can try
to get an update and
see what we have to do.
What, Finn?
- Our snow's still here.
-  Oh, our snow's still here?
- Yeah.
-  We do have some snow left, huh?
- Yeah.
- He filled up with the
pool, he's got a hose
sticking out, he's filled up and he's --
-  Oh my gosh.
- Are you guys ready to give up some water
out of your pool?
- Yes, heck yes. (laughs)
I think as long as the wind's died down,
we're probably okay, right?
-  Yeah, I think.
- It seems to be going that way.
It's really close to us, though.
- It's in a neighborhood,
there's houses here.
-  Well, do you
think they'll only evacuate
us if it gets out of hand?
- Yeah.
-  So if they can take care of it,
we'll be good, but --
- I don't know what the rules are
for an evacuation; it could be just that
it's better to leave now because you won't
be able to leave.
-  Yeah.
(sighs deeply)
(jet engine roaring)
There is a huge plane
about to fly over this fire.
I can't believe this is happening
right in front of us, Missy.
- I know, this is like --
-  See that plane up there, Ollie?
That's circling around?
It's coming lower because it's gonna
fly over the fire and it's gonna drop
water all over it.
- Really?
-  Should we have Marshall help?
Maybe we should let Marshall loose.
Maybe Marshall could help.
Look how low this plane is right now.
-  Yeah.
-  Oh my gosh,
it's seriously flying
right over us, oh my gosh.
-  There we go, there we go.
Oh my gosh.
-  Wow.
-  Right on the road there.
- This is really intense.
- Yeah, this fire is just
a little too close to home for us,
so it's kind of
trying to stay positive
and I honestly think we're fine
'cause of the winds.
It's just crazy that this is happening
in California right now everywhere.
There's like three little fires
if I look across the street.
There's like three little
fires, separate areas.
- Hi.
- Hi, Finn, how are you, buddy?
You okay?
- Baby.
-  Look at this plane, you guys.
This is a commercial plane right now.
Literally right over our house.
Wow.
No big deal, just a commercial airplane
flying over our property to drop --
oh my gosh, is this real?
(gasps) Oh my gosh.
Oh yeah, it just dropped it right there.
Oh my gosh, Jim, have you ever seen
that before in your life?
- Not at this distance, I mean, wow.
That was a full-size airplane.
- That was like a plane
that, like, people were in.
-  Yeah, that's
a commercial airliner.
(gentle piano music)
(jet engine roaring)
Look dude, look at that plane!
Do you see it?
- I don't see it.
Whoa!
-  It's like right there. (laughs)
(jet engine roaring)
See this huge plane over here, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- It's going to fly right in front of us.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Is that crazy, Finn?
- Yeah.
- Not the best way to start
the new year, you guys.
With a fire in your backyard. (sighs)
Happy new year.
- All right, it looks like the fire
is pretty much out.
I think I read that I think they have it
pretty much contained
at seven or eight acres,
so that's nice to know.
My parents are actually headed up so that
we could all go swimming,
and on the way up,
that's what happened, so
we had to put a little
pause on the swimming,
but now we're headed out.
We're gonna get some pool time in,
'cause it's a nice day and we've got
a Jacuzzi, so let's get in.
Are you guys goin' swimming too?
We just got you groomed
and now you just jumped right in, huh?
All right, Papa is headed
into the freezing-cold pool.
- Here, here.
-  Save my sword.
- Get your sword.
Get the sword.
-  He's splashing.
How cold is it, Dad?
- It's cold!
It's beyond cold.
-  Oh my god!
Oh my god.
Why are you doing that?
No, Finn!
All right, hopefully you can still hear me
'cause Finn just jumped in
and almost broke the camera.
How cold do you think that is, Dad?
Ollie, don't go in
there, it's too cold now.
- I did.
-  Don't go in there.
- That jump was really (mumbles).
No!
-  Oh my goodness.
Finn, do not get in there.
No no no no.
Oh my goodness.
All right, how was your swim?
- Good.
- Good.
That was a really nice swim.
The water felt nice.
It's not like freezing
as you're getting out.
Sometimes when you go
it's not fun sometimes
to go in the hot tub when it's winter
because you're getting
out into freezing-cold
weather, but it's pretty nice.
- It's not windy, which is pretty good
for the fire.
- It worked in our advantage twice today,
so that's good.
What is the temperature, like 70?
- It's like 70, I think 70.
- It's pretty nice.
Oh wait, come here, I want --
I don't want you guys to get wet.
Or get dirty, stay down.
-  Come here, guys. (whistles)
-  Come on.
Go dry off. (laughs)
You guys stay here until you're all dry
and then you can come in, 'kay?
-  It looks like all the threat
of the fire is gone and I am just like
looking at this scene
outside my house now,
this is beautiful.
That's the moon, you guys.
It's like, oh, hey, did you guys
have a fire down there?
(cheerful music)
Did you boys have a fun time swimming?
- Yeah.
- So it looks like the
threat of the wildfire
has disappeared, so we don't gotta worry
about the fire, okay?
- Okay.
- But it has left this amazing scene
in our courtyard.
Look at this.
-  Whoa.
-  Look at this sky.
And that is the moon, huge and bright.
Crazy.
What do you think of that, Finn?
-  Hey guys.
-  See that sky?
- Hey guys, I think when it's out,
maybe it just takes a piece
and maybe it just comes back
and just see a truck and wait 'til moon.
-  Oh, really?
- Yeah.
(laughs)
Because the moon looks
different every night, huh?
- Yeah.
- All right, guys, I am gettin' all ready
for the night and the boys just finished
their dinner, and they
ate their vitamins, huh?
- Yeah.
-  And guys what, guys?
- What?
- 2017 is almost over.
It's almost 2018.
In 2018, you're gonna turn five.
- Five?
-  In 2018 you're gonna turn three.
In 2018, maybe Mama is gonna get pregnant?
(laughs) Not have a baby.
But maybe I'll get pregnant, I don't know.
So many possibilities in 2018.
We actually were just
watching the last vlog
of 2013, the year Ollie was born
and it was so cute, I just love watching
back and seeing our last
moments of that year,
and it was just, it was
really fun to kinda watch.
I did wanna give a really quick update
on the fire.
It is out, no structures, no one was hurt,
nothing was hurt at all.
It was obviously a fire, which is scary
and does do damage to the --
it did damage to certain property
and to trees and bushes
and things like that.
But all in all, pretty low-key fire.
Thank God.
And we just have, honestly,
the best firefighters
here in California.
They were on it (snaps fingers) like that.
Dropping the retardant and water on it,
and it was just really awesome to see
right from our yard how hard-working
our firefighters are, so thank you
to our California
firefighters for just saving
the day, but actually
the road is still closed
coming to my house, so we
have some fun plans tonight.
We're hoping to go out, but if my parents
can't come up here to watch the kids,
then we'll just be staying in tonight.
I guess we'll have to see how that goes.
All right, I'm getting
my last-minute hangouts
in to 2017 with my little boys.
Finn, did you know that
you're two years old,
and you're the cutest little two-year-old
I ever did see?
And you are four and you're
the cutest thing ever.
- Yeah.
(Missy laughs)
- I just love these boys.
I'm just gettin' some last-minute cuddles
before it's bedtime.
Almost bedtime, huh?
- Yeah.
- He actually did not
sleep well last night,
so hopefully tonight is better, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Anyways, I think we're
gonna go ahead and end
at today's video.
Thank you guys so much for watching
and thank you for
watching in the year 2017,
and I hope you guys enjoy a new, amazing,
awesome year in 2018 with tons of plans,
and things that could happen.
It's like really, really exciting.
So thank you guys so much for watching.
Thank you guys for your support.
Thank you guys for thinking of us
and praying for us during the fire
and we'll see you guys next year.
Ollie, can you say bye?
- Bye, poop!
- Oh, what do you say?
- Bye, poop.
(upbeat music)
