- Good morning, guys.
It is just us this morning, huh?
Daddy's in San Francisco
at a YouTube meeting
and he will be back, actually tonight,
but really, really late.
So you guys probably won't see him today.
I'm not quite sure what we're planning
to do today.
I'm actually planning
to go get my hair done
really quick, so Papa's headed up
to watch the boys, but
then we'll come back
and then I don't know.
We should probably do something fun, huh?
- Yeah.
-  What do you
think we should do today?
- Maybe go swimmin'?
- Swimmin' would actually be really fun.
It is probably really
cold, but the hot tub
would be cool, huh?
What do you wanna do today?
- Um, daddy.
- Daddy?
- Yeah.
- You wanna see Daddy?
- Yeah.
- Well, we can't see Daddy,
that's the one thing we can't do.
- I wanna go rock climbin'.
- Rock climbing would be really cool.
- Yeah.
- That sounds really fun.
So yeah, we gotta figure out
our plan today.
I think it's gonna be a fun day, huh?
Just me and the boys, let's go.
All right, I am headed into
my hair appointment now
and man, guys, it is so chilly.
It has been like so warm this whole winter
and I've talked about it a lot.
And when it has been, like, cold
it's been, like, yeah, it's chilly
but, like, the air is
just so much crisper now.
Like it feels like that
wintery, crispy air.
I'm sure almost everyone
knows what I'm talking
about right now because it's probably cold
where you are and you know
exactly what I'm talking
about, but yeah, I'm,
like, wearing a jacket
'cause it's cold, it's crispy cold.
All right, I am headed
home now, hair is done.
I don't know if you can tell,
but I definitely needed
a good little hair-doin'.
(mumbles) does such a good job.
Like, she does it and
it's, like, not frizzy
or thick or crazy.
It's so nice, it just
feels like a whole new
head of hair when we does my hair.
While I was at the hair salon,
I came up with a great idea
of what I wanna do with the boys today.
Actually, I shouldn't take all the credit.
My mom helped me come
with a really awesome idea
and I think they're
gonna be really excited
and super surprised.
I don't think they would think
that I would take them to do this.
So I'm gonna go home and get them all,
including Papa and Mimi,
and we're gonna head
to a little fun surprise.
(mellow music)
All right, we just made
it to our secret spot.
You wanna tell them where we're going?
We're going --
- At the, at the fish (mumbles).
- We're going fishing.
And Finn just ran over here to show you.
Are we gonna catch one of those, Finn?
- Yes!
-  A fishy?
Oh my goodness, Finn, this
is like your first time
fishin', huh?
Actually my mom and dad
took Ollie here once
a long time ago, or quite a while ago.
Maybe like a year ago?
Two years ago?
And so I'll have that
video linked down below,
up here because it was so cute.
Ollie, like, dropped his pole
and, like, it went into the pond
and it was just like a
super-cute little vlog.
So you guys all check it out.
But now we're going fishing
and it is a pretty small pond.
We don't have a lot of
them here in California.
(laughs)
Fishing is a big deal
when you're in California,
'cause you gotta find a pond
and you gotta see if there's fish
and you gotta see if
you're allowed to fish.
-  Don't wake the duck up.
-  Shh, there's a duck.
No one wake the duck.
Shh.
Wow, it's such a well-behaved --
- Get right up to it and pet it.
-  Oh my gosh, she
just touched the duck.
Did you see that, Finn?
-  Is he real?
-  Oh my goodness.
-  Guys, he's not real.
- So yeah, we're gonna go fishin'
and see if we can catch anything.
You think you'll catch anything, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  You're a little older now.
You gonna let go of that pole?
Don't let go of the pole, okay?
(mellow music)
- We've gotta get the
fish, who live out there,
we need 'em to come in here with us, okay?
We're gonna talk 'em into it.
We're gonna tell 'em,
"Come here, fishies," okay?
- Okay.
- So have you guys been
practicing your fish call?
-  Do you know
how to do your fish call?
- Oh my gosh!
- Oh my gosh!
- I just hear a fishy.
-  A fish just jumped.
- Pretty cool.
-  He says "I wanna
go home with you guys."
-  Yeah.
(mellow music)
(record scratch)
-  He's putting some
extra security on there.
-  Yeah.
-  That's not going nowhere.
-  From experience.
-  (laughing) From experience,
because we know that Ollie just lets go.
- We're just gonna relax.
Hold the pole up in the air.
-  (laughing) Hold the pole.
- Okay.
-  (laughing)
Yay, this is how we fish.
- This is how we fish with Ollie.
-  What'd you catch, Ollie?
- I caught this.
I got Finley J.
-  You got a Finn.
Ollie, do you think
we're gonna catch a fish?
- Yeah, and I'm gonna put it
in this net.
-  Okay.
What are you guys doin'?
- We're picking some worms
that I like.
-  You like these worms?
-  Here.
-  They are so cute.
Do you like 'em?
- Yeah.
-  He said, "This
is my very first time
"holding a pet worm."
Are you gonna keep it forever?
-  Yeah.
-  Did you know
that we're feeding them
to the fish?
- Yeah.
Oh.
-  Oh no.
Don't go down there.
Look at that one.
-  That one can climb on.
-  Oh my goodness,
he's crawling up your shirt.
-  Oh no.
Cool.
-  Cool.
Oh, did he get away?
Oh, he finally got a bite
and he took your worm, even.
You were so close, Dad.
This is what it's like
when you go fishing.
You just sit here, sit here, sit here,
and maybe you'll get a bite
and then it goes away.
So we have been out
here for quite a while.
Finn is actually napping on my back.
He's getting a really good nap.
And we still haven't caught anything.
My camera's gonna die.
Huh?
Oh yeah, we get tons of little nibbles
and bites, but no fish, huh, Ollie?
- No.
-  Aww, what a bummer.
Oh my god, oh my god, I think Dad got one.
Oh my gosh, this is crazy.
Mom, you said it's time to go.
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,
it's huge, it's huge.
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh, Mom, you better not.
Oh my gosh, this is crazy.
Oh my gosh.
What?
Oh my gosh!
(laughing)
We have been here three hours
and my mom says, "It's
time to go, let's go."
And that second --
Finn, did you see that?
- Yeah.
- Did you see that huge fish?
- Yeah.
- I had to pull out my phone
because my camera just died. (laughs)
Oh my gosh.
This is crazy.
- You wanna hold him?
-  No.
-  That thing is huge, Dad.
- Here.
-  Oh my gosh.
Ollie, you don't wanna hold the fish?
- No.
-  I can, I mean,
we waited a long time
for that.
- Yeah, I didn't think
it was gonna happen.
-  That is huge.
Did you catch one that big
when you came with Ollie?
- No, it was not that big, it was probably
half that size.
I wonder what that one's gonna weigh.
-  That is crazy.
I need to take some
pictures of you, Ollie,
with your fish.
Okay, hold it up.
There you go.
Pick him up higher, higher.
That thing's too heavy, huh?
There you go.
Wow, good job.
All right, we are finally back home.
I was able to change the battery
on the camera, and that was so funny
that my phone died as
soon as we caught a fish
and my camera died as
soon as we caught a fish.
So basically, she, the biggest fish
she's ever sold was six pounds.
This one was nine pounds.
It was huge.
You shoulda heard her.
She was like, "Oh lord, that is huge!"
She was freakin' out, it was so cute.
Yeah, and actually, it's not
a catch and release place.
She wants, she, like, makes you pay for it
and then she makes you take it home.
We ended up taking it
home and we are measuring
right now and check this out.
It is 25 inches.
(laughs)
Oh my gosh, that is insane.
Biggest fish she's ever sold,
and actually the biggest fish I've ever --
- This is the biggest
fish I've ever caught.
-  Caught period?
- Pulled in, yeah.
-  Out of a pond?
- On a pond, definitely.
Mom got a --
-  Swordfish?
- Yellowtail.
-  Oh, yellowtail?
- It was pretty big.
-  That thing is huge.
And we are definitely
eating it for dinner.
(laughs)
Not sure how much Ollie
will understand that, but --
Yep, that is pretty neat, huh?
Were you pretty excited about that?
- Yucky.
-  All right,
boys, you are all clean
and they smell good again.
They were smellin' like
fishes for a while, huh?
- Yeah, 'cause fish bait, if
you get it all over
yourself, you'll get dirty.
- Yeah, fish bait is gross
and fishes are gross.
So we are gonna make a little hot cocoa
because we were so cold today, huh?
- Yeah.
-  We just want a
little somethin' to sip on.
We were going to take this all up
to Nacho and have some
hot chocolate with him,
but it just got a little too late
and these boys got a
little too crazy, right?
- Yeah.
- So we're gonna have a little hot cocoa
before our dinner, okay?
- Yeah.
-  Let's make some hot cocoa.
(relaxing music)
All right, we had to improvise.
We had no mini marshmallows,
so the boys tore up big marshmallows
and put them right into
their hot chocolate
and I went ahead and
skipped on the marshmallows,
but I think that we are just about ready
to drink some.
Does that sound good?
- Yeah.
-  All right.
And of course, Mama got teacup.
What did you get, Finn?
Is that Santa?
- Yeah.
-  Papa!
-  Papa.
-  He usually calls that Papa.
And you got yourself.
That says Ollie on it, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  Be careful, be careful!
(laughs)
Check to see it's not too hot, 'kay?
How does it feel?
- Hot.
-  Hot?
(laughs)
-  Yeah, hot.
- Okay.
All right, boys got a little crazy
and I went ahead and put them to bed,
but they had a super fun day
and they had their dinner
and they were just super overtired.
But my parents are over again tonight
and they're cookin' up some trout.
Hopefully none of you are too squeamish,
but yes, we are not letting that fish
go to waste.
We are gonna have that for dinner tonight.
I know that might seem a little weird
for some of you, but we aren't vegetarians
and most of the food we eat was alive
at some point. (laughs)
It is really weird to see it alive
and then eat it, but --
- And actually, the place that we went to
is not a catch and release.
You're not allowed to catch a fish
and put it back.
You have to take it out.
That's just the way it is.
- Yeah, but anyways
I'm just gonna go ahead
and end the video so
you guys don't have to
see me eat it, you know?
(laughs)
Anyways, I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video.
Make sure you give it a big thumbs-up.
How awesome was that that we were able
to catch such a huge fish?
We had such a fun day
and we will see you guys tomorrow
and Bryan will be back.
He gets home really, really late tonight.
I'm so excited to see him.
So we'll see you tomorrow, bye!
(upbeat music)
