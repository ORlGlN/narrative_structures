you are that's whatever wanna be that
big
I am
holder ever

good morning guys so we are still in
Washington DC but today we are flying
home to go back to California and we're
gonna see ollie which I'm very excited
about hopefully he's not too mad at us
for leaving him cuz I know he's
definitely been dealing with that and he
definitely misses us and I'm sure he
misses his little brother Finn huh oh
yeah you might see Ollie today we're
good we'll see your big brother so yeah
we're just in the hotel room we're
getting the final things packed I lost
my ID on this trip so hopefully we can
end up flying home I know the process
just takes a little bit longer with TSA
so crossing our fingers that I can fly
home even lose it like in a certain
place you realize you and Dad realize
you need to go holy yeah we had part of
our team staying at the Marriott and
they had received a phone call because
it was all the rooms under my name they
were saying that they have something of
mine so I'm pretty sure someone found it
and I'm not gonna get it back so that's
kind of a bummer
I'm just hoping for the best as we fly
home today all right moment of truth you
guys we got through the front desk and
now we are walking to our to security
and it's a deal no ID I said they're
going to put them in a dark room
handcuffed them and ask them very
serious important question
so yeah so not looking forward to that
the girls were just like where's the
star bags oh my god is there one over
there
no I know we should hang on to that one
is literally what they're asking they
wanted to get Starbucks before we check
and I'm like I have to go it's gonna
take longer like no there's only one in
there cuz they'll make me drink it no
they can throw it away before you go to
TSA Gary I'm worried about getting home
and they're like really want my chai and
we're clear everything up we are clear
for takeoff
well I'll have you know he was very kind
and very gentle it's good okay not like
how they were a long time not like how
they were a Jefferies detect no oh yeah
that was kind of annoying because it
took a long time but I'm glad it's over
better that we're going back well you
girls can go to Starbucks now and stand
in that line for 30 minutes - really -
not go Starbucks because of your mistake
so I picked up this amazing chocolate
muffin in the airport and Finn is
gunning for it
