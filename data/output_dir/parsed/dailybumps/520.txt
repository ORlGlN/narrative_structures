so good at stuff like this so she's with
me now or at Hobby Lobby we're just
basically doing a woodland creature type
theme which is kind of what I did with
ollie when he turned one but it's gonna
be a lot different like color scheme
it'll be more like real bear like this
will probably be something that's in his
room rather than like a cartoon bear so

different things in here and of course
always like um dinosaurs we need a
dinosaur in the woodland creature room
