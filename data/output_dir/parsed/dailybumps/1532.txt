I'm digging in a sword I'm I'm in a
store
I think some of those K this is all son
baby
boy do amazing things take a morning go
on sit go on say good morning what do
you do with your feet say I just had an
amazing morning bath you felt so good
yeah I'm oh I'm not clean and cozy and
warm please for the love of all that is
holy do not poop right now good morning
guys um so we are just getting ready for
our day and Oliver was taking a little
nap let's see my yeah so he's taking a
nice little nap he's been asleep for a
while I gotta tell you guys last night
was probably the worst night that we've
had since I had him and I'm not even
like exaggerating here I've had nights
of course where he wakes up a lot and
it's never been that big a deal though
because I I saw a big deal when he wakes
up I just usually feed him and he goes
back to bed and if he doesn't go back to
bed then I sit with him for a few
minutes and we rock him or whatever you
know it's not usually too big of a deal
and sometimes he'll get out three four
times a night but I really care last
night it was like it was scary
every time he woke up he would just
scream be like screaming bloody murder
um and I was like freaking howling I
just couldn't figure out what was the
problem
I don't know I can think of was that
well in the beginning he was overly
tired I put him to bed like an hour
later than I should have just because of
all the Christmas decorating and all
that going on and so I don't know if
that had been the problem but then he
kept waking up and every time he'd wake
up he would be like screaming there's
not a lot that can wake up Brian and
even Brian woke up and was like what is
going on he was trying to like rock him
and help him and like Oliver was not
having it like nothing was working
walking around with him rocking him
feeding him it was like horrible it was
like the worst night ever and so me and
Brian are both like exhausted of course
Oliver is exhausted but he seems much
up here today he's sleeping really good
right now he's been asleep for a while
so maybe he'll catch up and then
hopefully fingers crossed tonight would
be a little bit better cuz that was no
fun
look how Christmasy it is you guys
Christmas dad is here I got a boy hi
look at this big Christmas tree yes

the time yeah yeah yeah ha we'll make

not too stressed about it but
oh I just love coming down here it's so
Christmassy look at it so Christmassy I
think Brian our I showed you how
Christmas it is but it's just so much
fun coming down here I had so much fun
yesterday like yesterday was just like
it are like one of my biggest favorite
traditions is decorating the tree and
then my water is like a really big deal
for our family it's always something
that we always sit down together and
read and this year I knew was me hard
but last year was really hard because
three years ago I found I was pregnant
the first time and I had no fear like I
was like I'm gonna have a baby next year
I can't believe it and so when we read
the letter last year it was really hard
because it was just all full of joy and
like I'm gonna have a baby I can't
believe that next year I'm going to be
holding a child in our arms are gonna
have a new baby I'm just so excited so
then of course writing the next year's
letter I remember just being like I
can't it's just gonna be too hard like I
don't want to just predict like that I'm
gonna have a baby when I don't know if
I'm gonna have a baby yeah I'm pregnant
but that doesn't always mean you're
gonna have a baby it definitely was an
emotional letter we were crying when I
read it with my family so it was really
cool but decorating the tree is one of
my favorite things and now I have a
little boy who gets to be involved and
next year he'll be putting the star on
the tree which is so cool gonna wake up
his eyes to a nice three and a half hour
nap hi I missed you I genuinely wanted
him to wake up cuz I missed him busy
stretch I'm awake world and I'm ready
for you so dear good morning thank you
