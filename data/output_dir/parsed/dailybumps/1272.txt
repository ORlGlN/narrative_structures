hello there everyone see crafter I am
making some lunch and Brian actually
made some chicken last night he grilled
up on the stove and he just just so that
we can have some chicken salad sandwich
for today and so I'm going to make some
of this and it sounds absolutely
delicious because I am starving and
lately we just haven't been doing a good
job making lunch at home because we just
didn't do a good job shopping fizzy
we're out of town so when we got into
town we were so tired that we just did
like a really quick shopping at Target
we just haven't had like a lot of food
and we're going to chop it up and put it
in the Ninja and make some chicken salad
sandwich what do you want for lunch
though which we need for you oh yeah
sound good this is yeah your phone self
I just made me a chicken salad sandwich
with some lettuce and cilantro because I
just love cilantro and I think it's
really weird to put cilantro on a
chicken salad sandwich but I did it and
I think it's delicious and always just
having some bread and Turkey and oh nice
one you're not supposed to do that yeah
he's basically just having like a turkey
sandwich but it allows to be separated
doesn't like it all together take your
juiced high karma all right I'm gonna
let you end this is our life all day in

my spot any guesses as to why this is my
spot air conditioning it's pointed right
here so I just did my hair I use this
stuff go 24/7 and I put it all on my
hands and I stand right here in my spot
and I look in the mirror and I styled my
hair just how I do it I don't know
also if you're wondering what this is
this is my handy dandy little speaker so
sometimes I like to listen to music and
all I have to do is hit play and it will
like play song as I'm getting ready for
the day
I am kind of bummed because my side of
the sink always gets plugged up Macy's
is perfect mine always gets plugged up
and it to happen since we moved in so I
think I'm actually and I like make a
maintenance request and have them unplug
it cause it's really annoying I can't
even brush my teeth in that sink because
it just overflows with water to tick us
and that's cool thing about renting is
they take care of everything in the
house just cleaned up the bed what is
this
there's a bottle why is it a bottle hey
mess how come there's a bottle next to
your bed what happened how did you try

him so I kept having dreams and he was
like falling and getting hurt

cooped up in the house I do feel like
since I work from home that there are
times where I just need to like get out
of the house for a little bit there's a
couple things I need to grab so I'm
gonna run to the store grab some staff I
do love being at home all day I love
being with my family and my wife and my
kid and I think I've got it pretty easy
as far as that's concerned cuz man I did
the whole like you know wake up early go
to the office you know and then come
home late eat dinner and it sucked
and I don't want to do that I would much
rather work at home than in a tiny cold
office how did you go swimming I'm kind
of bummed today I love you guys hey I
guess geez I don't know if you guys have
ever experienced this but sometimes when
you take a nap because you're really
tired then your day gets started late
and then everything is just like I don't
know it's so much it makes your day so
much more stressful but that you needed
that sleep at the same time
so anyways obviously I just finished a
video that I was already bummed about
because I did it wrong yesterday and so
I had to recall it today and I was super
super bummed about it but then I ended
up not getting that done to like just
now and now Oliver who's taking his nap
even though I really wanted to take him
swimming and it's kind of a late nap
anyways because bedtimes in a few hours
all I couldn't it it's just been like
one of those days where just it's
slipping away so fast but you have
things you have to do and at the same
time I want to enjoy my day oh I'm
pretty much gonna enjoy this amazing
pool it's really nice it's like 98
almost 100 degrees and the water feels
amazing sometimes the water feels a
little bit cold because we have to fill
it up quite often feels really really
really nice Karma's enjoying it look at
him he's like I don't know swimming I
really can't imagine not ever having a
pool again because he loves swimming and
now he he like learns the word swimming
you know how he knows words like the
park or leash yourself now when he heard
the word swimming he can't wait to go
swimming that's pretty funny

Harry Potter and I think that was like
over $100 but I really love all the lego
