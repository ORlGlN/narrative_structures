-  Hey, Ollie.
- What?
-  You've been drinking my soda?
- No, what?
-  Yes, you have.
- No.
-  Where'd it all go then?
- You drinked it!
-  No, I didn't!
- Just drinked it!
-  I saw you over here drinking it.
(Bryan laughs)
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it, live it forever
(gentle music)
-  Good morning, boys!
(Finn laughing)
- Don't bite me!
-  I think he's
trying to give you kisses.
- No, I think he's trying to bite me.
- Oh, yeah?
Finley, you two are just a bunch of boys.
Good morning!
- Good morning!
-  These boys are giving me loves.
- These boys are crazy!
(Bryan yells)
(Missy laughs)
What's up, dude?
What's up my little dinosaurs?
-  Look at the cute outfits!
Here Ollie, lets show off your outfit.
- Look at their super cute new Rags.
-  I love them!
- These are from Rags to Raches,
they just did a dino drop.
-  I love it.
- I wasn't able to get the
same design for both of them
but I was like, "I'll just
get it different then."
-  I actually love the fact
that they're wearing
basically the same thing
but they're not exactly matching.
- We dress them as if they're twins
almost every single day.
- Yeah, it is.
If you don't know I have a
little bit of an obsession
when it comes to them matching.
I get really stressed out.
- I think she just wanted twins.
- I know, I get stressed out
when they're not matching,
but actually this is super
cute cause they're like,
matching but not identical.
- Look at those dino-booties!
- I literally love Rags to Ratches.
They're just the cutest outfits,
and they're easy, and they're fun,
and the boys love them
'cause they're comfortable.
- Three, two,
one, go!
(Ollie and Finn giggling)
- I win!
(Missy laughs)
(playful music)
- It is another beautiful day, huh?
We're wearing our long sleeves!
I mean, it's not freezing,
but it feels nice out, huh?
Okay, crazy boys, why are you guys
just daredevils all the time?
Life with boys is (sighs) so much!
I have to go get some chicken food today
and I have to figure out
what I'm gonna do with these roosters.
I have three roosters
that cock-a-doodle-doo
all morning long, all day
long, and it's just a lot.
But I actually have a lady,
the lady who gave me the egg.
She said if any of them
end up being roosters
that she would actually take them
because she is constantly
breeding and stuff.
And so she loves, especially
her rooster Silkies,
so she can continue making more Silkies.
I think I may end up
calling her eventually,
maybe not right away, but
maybe just come pick them up
because they're gonna have a great home.
They have a great farm and I love her,
she just seems like such
a good chicken owner.
They'll be a lot happier in a place
where I'm not going,
"shut up," all the time.
Whoa, what happened to your hulk hand?
(rooster crows)
Oh, there goes one right now.
Those Silkies, plus they're
fertilizing my eggs.
Does that make sense, they're fert--
They're making them fertile.
(rooster crows)
And that's so hard, every
time I crack open an egg
I'm so scared that a
chicken's gonna pop out,
because maybe I left
it out there too long,
maybe I thought I got all the eggs
and it sat out there for longer
and I'm gonna be honest,
it's happened before.
So, it's always now my fear
because I have roosters.
- All right, I have my two best boys
loaded up in the car and
we're gonna go eat some lunch.
(boys cheer)
You ready?
Doing a little lunch
date with the boys today
while Missy has a doctor's appointment.
Oh, look there she is!
What are you doing?
- I forgot my purse!
-  Oh, my gosh (laughs).
You drove all the way
where we were going to
lunch to get your purse?
- Well, it's on the way.
-  Oh, that's so funny.
Say bye to mama.
- Bye!
- Bye!
- I love you!
-  Love you, babe (laughs).
That was so funny, that was
not even planned at all.
(laughs) All right, let's go eat!
- Whoa!
-  What?
- That place has got
Christmas stuff in it.
-  Really?
- Look!
-  We're going to
Mexican food for lunch
and they're all decorated for Christmas.
Yes, they are, huh?
- Yes!
-  Are you excited
for Christmas, boys?
-  Yes!
- See these boys are just like us,
once Halloween's done,
they're ready for Christmas.
- Cheers, too slow!
-  Aw.
Cheers, too slow!
Cheers, too slow!
Cheers (laughs).
We always have to cheers our chips.
Cheers!
Hey, Ollie.
- What?
-  You've been drinking my soda?
- No.
-  Yes, you have.
- No.
-  Where'd it all go then?
- You drinked it!
-  No, I didn't!
- Just drink it!
-  I saw you over here drinking it.
(laughs) You drank all my
soda, Ollie, didn't you?
Ollie, tell the truth,
did you drink all my soda?
Are you sure?
- Just drink it!
-  (laughs) Who
drank all my soda, then?
Was it Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Finn, did you drink all my soda?
- No.
- I think Finn drank all my soda.
- You guys, it is slowly turning into
Christmas!
- Christmas!
We have a Christmas bed, our bed.
- I don't think we've
ever actually done this.
- Yeah, I think we have.
-  Really, like a Christmas bed?
- I feel like we really
needed something red.
But look at this, this
is velvet, you guys.
-  I love it.
- All we had to do was
change our shams and quilt.
- It was so easy!
So, we have a big white duvet under it
with white sheets and white pillowcases.
So literally, this is just like a quilt.
I love it.
- It literally feels
like you're sleeping with Santa.
- Yeah, it is so soft!
I love it!
Look, we still have fall in here too.
We are slowly doing Christmas
throughout this month.
- Look at these pillows.
- And for those of you who are like,
"whoa, whoa, whoa, you
can't skip Thanksgiving."
We're not, right?
- Yeah, I'm not gonna get
a comforter that has a--
- Turkey on it?
- Turkey on it.
- We're not skipping Thanksgiving,
we love Thanksgiving.
We can't wait to celebrate Thanksgiving.
But I like to do it with
Christmas decor around, too.
All right, boys, where we at?
- Jumping play place!
- Yay, they're so excited I'm
gonna take them in to play.
Who are we gonna hang out with?
- CJ and Bailey!
- Yeah, so we're gonna go
hang out with CJ and Bailey
for a little bit and let em
play and run off some energy.
And then, we'll head home.
Daddy's at home getting some work done,
so we'll see you in a little bit, okay?
- Okay.
- Let's go.
Look what I've acquired,
a little baby girl!
Say hi, Emma.
This is Roses' baby.
She is almost 6 months
old and she's so sweet.
Yeah, we're here with my
Aunt Linda and CJ and Bailey.
I don't know where they all are.
Olivia's back there,
the kids are so happy.
I can't even get a picture of them
'cause they're just running like crazy.
(upbeat music)
- What's up dude, how was playing?
- I'm good.
-  Good, are we
feeding the fish now?
- Yup.
-  Yep, and I thought it would be
a good opportunity for you
to show people our new fish.
- Yeah.
-  I don't think we've
shown him on YouTube yet.
- Yeah.
-  Which one is it?
- The yellow one is named OJ.
-  Yeah, because he
looks like orange juice.
You know your initials are OJ too?
- Really?
- Yeah, OJL, yeah (laughs).
Papa and the boys actually picked up
a yellow tang a week ago
and it's kinda starting to
come out into the front.
You can see it right there.
He's getting a little shy
'cause we're getting ready to feed it
but it's a cool little tang, huh?
Of course, Dude's still doing alright.
You all right, dude?
Yes.
(crying)
Finn's like, "Why aren't
we feeding them yet?"
(gentle music)
All right, Finn's feeding the fishies.
So for those of you who are
wondering how we feed our fish,
we feed them three times a day.
Mostly all at the same time
but it's three different things a day.
So we feed these pellets.
And then we also feed
them the blood worms.
And then, we also do seaweed.
Certain fish need certain things
so putting all of these
in there just makes sure
that everyone gets what
they need to thrive.
Look at them eating the pellets though.
They do love to eat (laughs).
-  This one especially.
He gets so excited for dinner.
- Kai's coming out!
-  Whoa he is, huh?
He's peeking in and out of
his little hole (laughs).
Even now, just trying
to vlog him is so hard.
Look, there he is, there he is!
-  He's trying
to get away from that.
-  Say hi, Kai!
- Hi, Kai!
Now it's time to give them blood worms.
-  That's right!
You're gonna do it?
-  You gotta mix it up really good.
All right, just give it a little squeeze.
-  Squeeze just
a tiny bit (chuckles).
There you go!
-  Good job!
Look at little Lloyd.
(gentle music)
Hey Ollie, I know you like
to fall in fountains but lets be careful
and not have you fall
in the fish tank, okay?
(laughs) Wouldn't that be funny though?
Can you imagine falling
into this fish tank, Ollie?
You could probably swim
in it, you're big enough.
(Missy laughs)
He's like, "I do not wanna do that."
- There's fish in there,
they will sting you.
-  Yeah.
And now, it is time for seaweed.
Which we put on these little clips
and then we move them down into the tank.
-  We have like
the little magnetic--
- Yeah, all right, guys,
it is now time to do the
Soggy Doggy bath challenge.
We are gonna play Soggy Doggy.
And Ollie is so excited,
his finger dancing.
(Missy and Bryan laugh)
Are you so excited, Finn?
- Yeah!
-  Do you see this cute puppy dog?
- Oh, it's so cute.
Look at his treat.
-  Aw, it's his treat?
- Yeah.
-  All right, so
we have the board game.
We have all the pieces.
And Missy is putting this together now.
Wait until you see this
cute, little doggy.
Look at this cute, little
doggy sitting in a bath tub
'cause he's ready for his bath.
Oh, is he kind of bouncy?
That's cool, huh?
And then, it has like little levers here.
And apparently it shakes when he's wet
and he gets you guys all wet, huh?
Are you guys excited to play?
- Yeah!
- All right.
We cannot play the Soggy Doggy game
until you name this puppy.
'Cause this like our
new little puppy, right?
Oops, broke it.
What should we name it?
- I want to name it Charlie.
- Charlie?
- That is such a cute, normal name.
How come you never come up
with cute names like
that for our real pets?
(Missy laughs)
(laughs) I love it.
Let's call him Charlie, okay?
You guys ready to play Soggy Doggy?
- Yeah!
-  All right, boys,
pick which character you wanna be.
-  I wanna be the soap.
-  I'm gonna be the ducky.
-  And I will be the paw print.
- So, the youngest
player gets to go first.
That's you, Finn.
-  Are you sure that's not Ollie?
(Missy laughs)
Just kidding.
-  All right, Finn,
you get to roll your dice.
Can you throw it?
Oh, gosh (laughs).
-  Careful, brace yourself!
(Bryan laughs)
- Just throw it onto the
thing, like this, baby.
-  Can you do that, Finn?
-  Yep, do you want me to show you?
- Okay, you can show him.
Good job.
-  Perfect, can you do it, Finn?
Roll the dice.
-  Roll the
dice, put it right here.
(Missy laughs)
-  No, oh, there you go.
He rolled a blue!
- Press down the faucet
with the bone one time.
-  All right,
we're turning it once.
(Missy gasps)
Nothing.
-  Made it, okay.
-  What did you roll?
- Yellow!
- Yellow.
All right, so take your little guy.
And you get to all the way to the yellow.
And that means you can turn
the little bone faucet two times.
One, two.
Yeah, so I get to go
right where you're at.
I'm gonna turn the faucet twice.
Do you wanna turn it for
me since I did it for you?
-  Turn it twice, buddy.
Good job, one more time.
-  Yay, all
right, it's Daddy's turn.
(lighthearted music)
Okay, what are you doing?
- I gotta push this twice.
(Missy gasps)
Sprayed the water on the puppy dog.
- That's so cute!
Okay, can you turn it?
-  Oh!
- Oh, my goodness.
-  He's shaking off.
(laughs)
That's so cute.
He's really wet.
Guess that's what happens when
you try to wash a dog, huh?
(Missy laughs)
(toy whirs)
He's getting everything so wet.
-  Good job, good job.
(lighthearted music)
- Are you ready?
- Yep.
(toy whirs)
(Bryan yells)
- He's getting us all wet (laughs).
- Down boy.
- Down boy.
-  He doesn't
stop 'til you turn it.
(laughs) Wow!
-  Getting me all wet.
-  What a fun game.
Do you like this game, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- It's pretty fun.
(Bryan yells)
(Missy yells)
(lighthearted music)
- All right, is it
storytime and then bedtime?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
They just finished their shower.
And they brushed their teeth.
And now, it is story time.
We just read, "The Best Pirate".
Then, we're gonna read,
"How to Catch a Monster".
That's a good one, huh?
And then, we just got this
brand new book called,
"The Rabbit Who Wants To Fall Asleep."
And this one is a really, really cool book
that Mommy is especially excited about.
Yeah, if you haven't heard of this book,
definitely look it up.
It's called, "A new way of
getting children to sleep."
And I think it uses a
little bit of hypnotism
and you have to read it a very special way
in order to help them fall asleep.
My kids don't have too hard
of a time going to bed.
They're pretty much exhausted (laughs).
But I'm excited to read this
book and see if it works.
But anyways, I do wanna tell you guys.
Hey, Ollie.
-  What?
-  Have you seen our
new music video, "Tribe"?
- Yeah.
-  Yes, and did you love it?
Is your favorite part seeing
Auntie dress up as a witch?
- Yeah.
- And Papa as a dinosaur?
- Yeah.
- Anyways,
I just wanted to let you guys know
that we have a new music video up.
If you haven't seen it,
it'll be linked up here in the iCard.
And we are just so excited about it.
We absolutely love it.
It turned out really super cute.
It was very like family
oriented and really fun.
So make sure you guys go check it out.
And I also wanted to let you guys know
that we actually have merch available.
I'll have it linked
down in the description.
You can buy merch for our music
video or the song "Tribe".
And obviously, just all of
our regular Daily Bumps merch.
So if you guys wanna check that out,
I'll have it linked down below.
But for now, it's time for
me to put these kids to bed.
Can you say, "Give the video a thumbs up?"
Thumbs up, oh, look at him.
He's still participating.
Say, "We'll see you tomorrow."
-  See you tomorrow.
-  All right, what do you say?
(Finn babbles)
(upbeat theme music)
