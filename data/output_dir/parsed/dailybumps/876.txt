actually is kind of awkward and feels
weird to me and I don't know where to
look I think I supposed to look here
but anyways I'm up and about I actually
did my hair today kind of I just
basically straightened it I wish I would
have added some curl or something just
so it didn't look so like that but um
it's just been driving me nuts I'm so
bad at doing my hair I hate doing it and
so I've just been doing buns for the
past like week and I think I find I was
like I got to do my hair like this is
just getting ridiculous anyways I got I
lay down for his nap and I'm getting
ready to film a bump date Brian is a
finishing a chiropractor appointment and
so whew super bright in here so I've got
my camera set up and I'm gonna film a
quick little update for you guys and my
sister to you again helping me out
otherwise I'm up and down the stairs all
day long and I get really exhausted and
but she's just a nice little help she
just likes hanging out with me anyways

his nap and I'm gonna feel really quick
and being productive woohoo 39 weeks
today what I'm so excited alright so I
just finished my bump day not a lot
about our plans this week as far as kind
of naturally inducing labor so if you
guys want to hear some of them know old
wives tales that we want to try and
definitely watch my video but now I'm
gonna eat someone and then I'm actually
headed to a massage but it's actually an
acupressure type of massage where they
kind of help press like the triggers to
help induce labor my midwife gave like
the official go ahead you should you
gave it last week but I thought I'm just
gonna wait until 39 weeks before I start
you know doing anything too crazy
there's like these pressure points on
like your feet and your legs and there's
actually a couple more I think there's
one on your hand and your back but yes
she's gonna kind of help press all those
buttons and
possibly induced labor it did work for
my cousin once I don't know it might be
kind of fun I'm definitely excited to
try it out alright some may see just got
that sometimes when you get a massage
like you really can tell with your
therapist is like really into it or if
they're just like kind of counting down
the minutes till they're done she I
could tell it's just like very like
really really really into this it I just
kind of got like this intense like like
over it's something that like came over
me I don't know it's okay hey like me we
can I'm telling it's weird a little
intense
she's like giving me a massage and she's
like you're such a calm person I can't
imagine you ever like raising your voice
or yelling and stuff like that what I
would consider is true right yeah no I
was like okay later she says has someone
recently in your life passed away and
I'm like oh not really

excited for him to be born is your
massage therapist it's okay I'm feeling
