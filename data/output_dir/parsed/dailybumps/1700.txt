CJ you're not using any floaties like a
big boy we tricked him and Missy was
gonna take air out of one side because
we're trying to get him out of the

boom hey Mel just kind of like a dad
thing it is so it's like a Father's Day
present right there yeah yeah got me a
beard trimmer boo-yeah boo-yeah
you know that you're gonna be dead when
you get excited about something like
that but I've never had one and the one
I've been using has been shucking but
this one's all just for all facial hair
so I'm gonna see if I can clean this up
a little bit because you see and I are
going out tonight taking me out I'm
going to attempt to try and make coconut
oil but of course I need my dad to
actually cut it open so first off
there's like stuff in here so are you
gonna cut it open with the stuff in it
to just take the top up okay because
there's like a little seam right here
you could probably cut it on singles
cooking top well I have to get all the
meat out he doesn't use any kind of sea
yeah that looks gross but cool what do
you guys think trimmed it down a lot
cleaned it up a little bit actually
it kind of turned it down to like a
couple weeks worth of growth which is
really cool cuz I never really had that
much control with the other trimmer but
this thing works pretty dang good so I'm
pretty happy with that
take a look pretty flat pretty flower
pretty flat for a white guy they they're
like just yours a paring knife I'm like
okay yeah that was good right
dang I wonder how this tastes can I try
a little bit of that is this gonna be
worth those I'm gonna give you no
coconut to really do it oh that oh yeah
but did me this was just that yeah I'm
sure there's like a way easier way to
like get all this out but I couldn't
figure it out I'm sure everyone's gonna
give me advice and that was yesterday
you guys are here right now it kind of
sucks that seems pretty well shredded I
am attempting to put all this into
coffee grinders which you can either use
cheesecloth or coffee binders it says
and then you're supposed to close it up
and squeeze it and oils supposed to come
out of it or something spokesmodel
good Harry this really good maybe that
drop could be the coffee filters are a
problem like they're not because they're
not really they're breaking open yeah
for my need cheesecloth some this is
nothing I can't do anything with this ah
find it think that it's my coconut
because when I watch when I look at the
pictures of how they showed oh do it
it's like oh you just scrape out the
coconut and then you cut slice it like
that um this stuff was not easy to just
slice out it was like really really
difficult so we're hanging out at Jay
Carter's Tavern in grill when Jessica
and Randy check out check this out I'm
the spongy Asst dad in the whole wide
world that means my kids think I'm fat
Bunji so in your spongy are you more
like spongebob I think it's just because
I'm so cuddly and lovable happy Bobby's
back that's night out right here look
like beer your gauge on father's but it
looks weird when the waitress said that
they serve bread Missy like freaked out
she was like new favorite place it does
look interesting Oh sir back oh man that
looks crazy yeah that no that's you know
that's not that's not rings that's okay
so what is a space that's squid so is
this like tentacles or what I'm going in
here you're eating the flat the flat
part of the the big part of the squid

think one time we had the tentacle
tentacle I don't like him as much yeah

it doesn't really have a case it's good
but it's not overly fishy while she's
not freaking out and that's pretty
amazing love you yeah
I ordered the mahi-mahi and I love
mahi-mahi and as far the best mahi-mahi
that I ever have the trick is they have
to cook it so it's not tough in the
middle and this is perfect

know cuz she's sticking to a girl that's
all she ever does we also had to go for
round two of the calamari because it was
