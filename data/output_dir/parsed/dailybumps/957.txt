doing some Sunday chores look at all
this rain that's all is it rained that's
the long rain that's a lot of rain
that's like what is that like 5 or 5
inches yeah that's pretty good
good job California for making it rain
and look it it's um it's very warm today
but it's cloudy and muggy and humid
we've been doing a lot of Tours we're
getting ready to have company over this
weekend so just been doing laundry and
getting stuff ready and a few weeks ago
me and Brian picked up this turkey it's
a Archer farms cooking bag homestyle
turkey we've never cooked a turkey in a
bag we love making turkey especially for
Thanksgiving and stuff I've never had
like I already prepared turkey so I'm a
little bit like if you own a I doubt
it's gonna be very good but we picked it
up like a couple weeks ago we forgot
about it and so we thought well let's
make it today we're going to make that
for the family while we're getting some
chores done and cleaning up and I'm
excited this week is gonna be so much
fun crazy and I just can't wait it
rained so much last night
our yesterday and I'm really worried
about my birdie can he survive that much
rain so I'm gonna go check on him right
now look at that he is all perched and
ready to fly away he's just like what
are you doing I've been visiting you
since you were born
oh he's gonna fly away any day so much
laundry to hold and I am so exhausted
I've been just cleaning up and doing a
bunch of stuff and Ollie is just top up
from his nap so I'm gonna go get him
you looking at the lights I don't have
fishies up right now I actually have the
monkeys up yeah and when he wakes up he
wakes up so peacefully and he wakes up
he just looks at the lights and I
sometimes never know that he's awake I
like to actually look at the monitor and
be like oh look I see his little eyes
are open
uh-huh cuz you're such a good super
really go hi booboo where's ollie
where is he are you right you may get up
you know food and so it begins again you
guys I was just down there cleaning
everything out putting things away and
the rain has started once more dang I
actually was literally getting ready to
go to the pool store because we need a
like a scrubber for the pool so that I
could clean it cuz maybe we'll go
swimming today but I don't think that's
gonna happen anymore yeah I would say
that's not gonna happen anymore
alright the turkey is in see if I can
look at it OOP it is cooking away I have
a corn to shuck and we're going to peel
potatoes we still have three hours on
the timer so it'll be a while oli really
wants this because probably just brought
it in side from the car but I can't give
this to you look at water everywhere

and a half or hour about two hours left
on the turkey so we are getting in the
hot tub and Brian had Brian set up he's
