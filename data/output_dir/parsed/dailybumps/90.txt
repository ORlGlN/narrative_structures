-  Wait, you
didn't see any dinosaurs?
Well, guess what, daddy
knows the secret spot
where we can actually see
dinosaur tracks, real ones.
- (gasps) Real ones?
-  Yeah, do you wanna go see them?

(peppy music)
- Look at these, Dad, cool mountains!
- Good morning, guys, Ollie, where are we?
- Um, we are at the hill.
- We have driven up to Warner Valley
we're gonna do a little bit of riding.
Are you excited, babe?
- Yeah, it should be really fun.
-  This is beautiful.
- We look like professionals.
-  I know. (laughs)
Carl and Jinger loaded
up all of their bikes.
Look at these motorcycles, dude.
We've got ATVs.
- Yeah, it's gonna be awesome, guys.
-  This is cool.
They just loaded up this big old trailer
with all this fun stuff
and now we get to go play.
- Yay.
-  This is like
a playground right here.
Playground of beauty.
(upbeat music)
If it wasn't too long of a drive up here,
but it was just long enough
that Finn fell asleep.
I'm actually gonna let him
get a little bit of a nap,
and we have the windows cracked
so we can hear him when he wakes up.
- We need training wheels for this thing.
-  I know, right?
- He could drive it if
we had training wheels.
-  Totally. (laughs)
That would be so cute,
seeing him on a motorcycle.
(peppy music)
Good morning, buddy.
- Yep, he's like, "Where are we?"
-  You wanna go racing?
- Yeah.
- So, we are getting
ready to hop on some ATVs
and do some riding out here.
Carl and Jinger are doing
a ATV versus RC car,
so definitely go check
that out on their channel.
I'll have it linked above in the i card.
And then, actually, we have a little bit
of a prehistoric surprise
for Ollie and Finn,
so don't miss that coming up.
- Motorcycles are cool!
-  Vroom, vroom!
These boys are ready to
go riding, aren't you?
Alright, Gage, what are you riding here?
- I am riding a Honda 125.
-  A Honda 125,
this is Gage's bike.
And then Luke, yours is so
cool, dude, it's like green.
- This is a Honda 110--
- That's not a Honda, that's a Kawasaki!
-  (laughing) You guys are funny.
What are you riding, dude?
This looks so cool, this little 50.
- Yamaha TTR 50.
-  Yeah, this thing is awesome.
How long have you been riding, dude?
- Um, about four months.
-  Right on, that's awesome.
I can't wait 'til we can get Ollie
on one of these, you know?
- Dude, I just really
was wanting to get some
training wheels on this one.
-  I know. (laughs)
- It would just be so cute!
-  Yeah, it really would be.
Alright, you guys gonna show us around?
- Yeah
-  Okay.
(engine revving)
- Let's go!
(upbeat music)
I see pterodactyls.
-  Ollie, what'd you find?
- A dinosaur egg.
-  Wow, what kind of
dinosaur you think's in there?
- I can't really open it, too hard.
-  Aww man.
- Alright, before I hop on the ATV,
Finn's gotta warm it up for me.
- We made it.
-  What do you think,
that's pretty cool, huh?
Oh, he's like, "Oh,
that was a little much."
- Wanna keep going, go
fast, no, no thanks.
-  There you go, dude.
- Hang on right here, there you go, ready?
(engine revving)
-  Hang on, both hands!
- We'll just go slow and be careful.
-  Okay.
(peppy music)
Missy's getting ready to hop on her bike.
And here comes the Ollie.
Oh, watch out for the RC car.
Was that cool?
- Yes.
-  Pretty awesome, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Woo, he's
like, "That was bumpy."
- Kind of a bumpy ride.
-  Say, "Thank you, Carl."
- Thank you, Carl,
- You're welcome, buddy.
- All the way down is first.
-  All the way down is first
and then you've got second, third, fourth,
all the way up, yeah.
- Yeah.
-  So you're gonna
go, there's five gears.
Be really careful, dude, here goes -- oh!
Everybody does that
their first time, dude.
It's totally normal. (laughing)
Here he goes!
Yeah, awesome!
Here goes Missy on her
first dirt bike ride.
Yeah, good job!
And off she goes.
- Hold the shift, just
pull there and pull off.
-  So far, so good.
How's it feel, Bryan?
Oh, off he goes again,
he doesn't even care,
he's going for it.
You're doing awesome, Missy!
What are you guys doing, kyle's out here
with Finley right now, oh,
they're racing RC cars!
That looks fun, this is your red one?
- Yup.
-  It's going so
fast it looks awesome.
Here it comes on a jump!
Whoa, peeling out!
Whoa, there it goes,
that's fast, huh Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, it's
going really fast, huh?
- Yeah.
(energetic music)
-  How's it feel, bro?
- That's so cool.
-  It's really fun, huh?
- Those little tracks are so neat.
-  Yeah, they're awesome.
It's just like a motocross track out here
everywhere you look, it's so cool.
Woo.
- I'm here to pick you up.
-  What?
- I've come to pick you up.
-  Are you really?
Let's go for a ride, dude!
(playful music)
- The camera is filthy, you guys.
Carl rode up to the
middle of that mountain
and was getting some
good footage of me going
through all the cool,
like motocross sports,
and everything is so dirty.
I'm very, very dusty, this red dirt,
is like, so interesting, too,
never seen anything like that.
Not in Idaho, not in California.
So it's very interesting being out here,
riding on the red dirt. (laughs)
But yeah, the kids are having a blast,
Missy's having a blast,
and we're just finishing
up some riding so we can take the boys
to our special surprise.
Finn, you love wearing the helmet?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
It's like, actually too heavy for him.
And he has trouble walking but he does not
want to take it off. (laughs)
You're so cute, dude.
- Hi, man.
-  Hey.
- Ask us why we just went
to the dinosaur section.
-  Wait, you
didn't see any dinosaurs?
- Yeah, but we just went
to the dinosaur section.
-  Oh, you did?
- Yeah.
-  Well, guess what?
- What?
-  Daddy knows the secret spot
where we can actually see
dinosaur tracks, real ones.
- (gasps) Real ones?
-  Yeah, do you wanna go see them?
- Yeah, I see a pterodactyl!
-  That is actually a bird.
Did you know that. (laughs)
It's funner when they're
pterodactyls, huh?
(dramatic music)
- We are now taking the
drive to the dinosaur tracks,
and we are so excited.
Everyone else took ATVs and motorcycles,
but there aren't quite enough for everyone
so we thought we'll just take the truck
and it does feel like we
are off-roading a little.
- Pretty bumpy,
- Yeah.
-  You excited to see dinosaurs?
-  Yeah!
- Well, we're not gonna see dinosaurs,
cause they're all dead.
But we're gonna see their
tracks, it's so cool, Ollie.
There used to be dinosaurs
living in this area.
Isn't that nuts?
- Were they just nice dinosaurs?
- I think they were
probably mean dinosaurs,
but they're gone now, you
don't have to worry about that.
- You don't have to worry about it.
-  But they're gonna
be, big, huge dinosaur feet.
Wouldn't that be cool,
and they're real ones.
- Well, are you gonna come with me?
-  Yep, I'm coming with you.
I'll be with you the whole time, kay?
And look how beautiful this drive is.
This whole area is just
so crazy magnificent.
(dramatic music)
-  He's so excited
to see dino tracks.
- Attacks, on.
-  We no longer have
a black truck, by the way.
It is now red, that is
the color of our truck.
We've accepted it.
(ominous music)
- I did not see tracks, come on you guys.
- They're up this way, let's go.
These are real dinosaur
tracks, guys, not fake.
The real thing.
-  Woo, ollie is so excited.
(dramatic music)
- Hey guys, I see them, walk
down the trails, let's go!
- They're right here, guys.
I can see the tracks on
the ground right here.
Look at this.
-  Oh my gosh.
- That's a real track.
Look, you can see right
where it ran through.
-  Wow, look at this one.
Wow!
- So the first ones, come way back here,
and then you can see where it ran.
Like right, left,
right, left,
and then this piece you
know, going the other way.
Isn't that crazy,
-  Crazy.
- See, they go all the
way up through here.
-  Look at that, Missy.
Ollie, do you see this, look at this.
See this outline right here?
-  Yeah.
-  That is a dinosaur track.
That's crazy.
- Crazy that it's still there.
- You wanna check out the raptor ones?
We are literally walking with dinosaurs
right now, you guys,
they walked in this spot.
That's just crazy, oh, so
they have some information
about the dinosaurs
that were in this area.
So this was a Megapnosaurus.
Big, dead lizard.
About six to eight feet long.
- And this is the bigger one.
-  That's a Dilophosaurus, yep.
- Dilophosaurus lives in
this area, that's so cool!
-  I know, these were
the dinosaurs in this area.
So cool, so there's more over here?
- Yeah there's little
ones, like the small one
that was six feet, you can see its tracks.
It looks like a little
chicken ran through.
- Wow, ollie, come look!
How is this all so preserved?
- So this used to be like, a huge,
ancient lake bed millions of years ago,
and then all of a sudden it
just dried up really fast,
and all the mud and clay
just petrified into sandstone
so it preserved the last
footprints of the last dinosaurs
that ran through here.
-  Wow.
- See this little three-toed one?
-  Oh, wow, yeah.
-  Here, and then here's
the next step right there.
-  That is so cool.
-  And then you can see
all the way up towards Missy.
-  Oh yeah, that's incredible.
- That's so crazy.
-  Wow.
(inspirational music)
You are touching history, Ollie.
Finn, put your hand in
there, look at that, dude!
You are crawling where
dinosaurs once roamed.
Isn't that amazing, Finn?
- Yeah!
(upbeat music)
(dinosaur roaring)
-  More over here?
Whoa, look at these tracks right here.
Ollie, can you imagine a
dinosaur running through this?
How cool would that be, you see these?
(gasping)
Put your hand in there,
Ollie, these are almost
as big as your hand,
yeah, isn't that neat?
-  Look at that
one right there, Ollie.
-  These ones are
way smaller than those
other big dinosaur tracks
that were over there.
It's a little dinosaur, huh?
- Let's go over here.
-  What do you think's over here?
- Scary dinosaurs.
(playful music)
Look at that snake.
-  Whoa I gotta pick up this, oh,
that's not a snake, that's
juat a stick. (laughs)
Oh, wow, you guys, ollie
just found a dig site.
-  What is that, Ollie?
- It's a fossil!
-  It is a fossil, huh?
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
-  Do you see it, Ollie?
Clean it up, what do you see?
- I don't know.
-  Is it a head?
- I see a head.
-  It definitely looks
like a dinosaur head, huh?
- Wait, what's that, that thing?
I think I got the nose of the dinosaur.
-  Really?
- Keep digging, keep digging.
-  Keep doing it, Kyle.
I wanna see an actual dinosaur head.
-  These are his eyes.
-  That's where his eyes were?
(upbeat music)
There we go, now we got some good tools.
(upbeat music)
(dinosaur roaring)
-  We are having an
after-riding dance club.
As if these boys didn't
burn off enough energy.
- Oh, we had so much fun today.
-  I know, was that so
cool, riding around, Ollie?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah, look at
him in his Christmas PJs.
He's so excited, (laughs) woo!
Ollie's a good dancer, a lot
of times he's just on his head.
But that's, oh there he goes, woo!
We had so much fun riding quads
and motorcycles today, didn't we?
Isn't that so cool, all that red sand?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we got dirty.
- We saw dinosaur tracks.
- I know, that's so neat, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well guess what
guys, we have more fun
coming tomorrow, so be sure
you don't miss tomorrow's vlog.
You wanna give this video a big thumbs up?
Thumbs up, subscribe, well see you manana.
Ollie, what do you say?
- Bye!
