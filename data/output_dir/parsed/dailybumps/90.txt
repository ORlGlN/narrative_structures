-  Good morning.
♪ This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
- It's actually kind of a chilly morning
I've got the fire on
and it looks like our
heater is not working.
It says something like it's been trying to
like heat up the house for two
hours and nothing's changed
and I'm like aah, it's
so cold all of a sudden.
I am really proud of Ollie because
he slept in his bed all night.
- Da, da.
- So we are super excited
because we are looking for Fred
like we do every single morning.
But wait, you guys still
haven't seen him anywhere?
- Yeah.
- They've been kinda
running around the house
while mama woke up and they
haven't found him anywhere.
-  Have you guys checked
your very messy playroom?
Have you seen him anywhere in here?
-  Nope.
-  No? Sometimes
we miss him on the tree
'cause there's a lot of stuff on the tree.
I don't see him anywhere.
-  There!
-  What? (laughs)
You think you see him?
-  Ya.
-  Where?
-  (Mumbles)
-  Oh, that right there?
That's just like an ornament Fred,
it's not the real Fred. You're so silly.
He really thought he just found him.
I don't know where he is right now.
I think we should just
get some breakfast going
and maybe we'll find him
in a little while, okay?
Today I think we're gonna make
real pancakes for breakfast.
While they're waiting for
me to make the pancakes,
I'm gonna get them some chocolate milk.
Can someone get the milk, please?
-  I can get the milk for it.
- Thanks.
-  (Mumbles)
-  Fred? Where are
you, Fred? Where are you?
Yeah.
 All right, what else do we need?
-  (gasps) Aaah!
-  What?
-  There!
-  How did you not see him?
-  (Laughs) I thought
he was in the refrigerator
but he wasn't.
-  First of all, you
guys went in the fridge twice
and you never saw him, so
did he just magically appear
when I opened it? Or was
he there the whole time?
- You opened it, and I didn't
I open it, and I thought I saw,
then I grabbed the milk,
then I didn't saw Fred,
then you open it, and I saw Fred.
-  Oh my goodness.
That is so crazy.
All right, what is he doing in here?
So he's hanging in our fridge right now,
but look what's under him.
Look at this green stuff.
It says Elf Milk. That's his milk.
Like you have chocolate milk,
he has Elf Milk, and it's green.
Isn't that funny?
I wonder
- That's disgusting.
-  (laughs)
I wonder if it has magic powers in it.
He's like, I'm not drinking it, mom. Huh.
Don't worry, I wouldn't drink it either.
I don't know what's in that stuff.
He's like, no.
Finn, would you drink the Elf Milk?
-  No.
-  No?
- (Mumbles)
-  Looks kinda weird?
Oh my goodness, I cannot believe
he is hanging out in our fridge.
If you're gonna hang out in that fridge,
can you grab me the milk, Fred?
-  No.
-  (laughs) All right,
boys. Let's leave him be.
Hopefully, he doesn't get too chilly.
I mean, he is used to
the North Pole, right?
So he won't get too cold.
- Yeah.
- We are getting ready for the day now.
We ended up actually skipping church.
I spent a lot of the time yesterday
running around and getting
Christmas gifts and stuff.
I was like, we just
need to clean the house
and hang out and I am just so
proud of this guy right now
'cause you are being such a good boy.
- Yeah.
-  Did you just dry
mommy's dishes for her?
- Yeah.
- So what I normally do,
is I wash all the dishes
and then I stack them wet
over here and then I dry them.
But this guy offered to dry them for me
and he's doing such a good job.
He dries them all, and
then he puts 'em away
and I'm like wow. I'm
starting to get a kid
who does chores and it's just so exciting.
And he already does like
cleaning up his playroom
and stuff like this,
but this is a big deal.
Like picking up these heavy
pans and drying them off for me?
That looks great! I am so proud of you.
I just think that's really exciting.
So let's set that here and
then I'll get another one.
I got a lot more to do. (laughs)
Can you help me with these?
No? You're done?
- Yeah.
- That's all I got? That's it?
You are such a good helper. Thank you.
Plus, you slept in your bed all night.
It's like you literally
are just a big boy now.
Anyway, my hair is crazy.
I just took a shower and it's air drying.
I'm gonna finish doing these dishes.
- Oh the places I find Luna sleeping.
She's so cute you guys.
Today has been kind of a busy day.
I'm getting lots of little things done
that I've been needing to
finish like Christmas shopping.
Are you guys done with Christmas shopping?
It's getting closer to Christmas you guys.
I also just talked to a muralist
because I'm trying to
get something really cool
designed Ollie and Finn's new shared room
that we're gonna be showing
to you guys next week.
I've been looking for
a muralist for a while,
haven't been able to get anyone.
Got someone super last minute,
and it sounds like it's gonna work
so I'm hoping that it does and the boys
can have something really
cool designed in their room.
Speaking of design,
check this out you guys.
Papa brought this to me today.
It's like a little bowl he made.
And I was like oh, that
actually would work perfect
for an air plant.
Check that out. That's pretty cool.
(Festive music)
Friendly reminder for those
of you with Christmas trees
to check and see how
the water is down below.
Ours is pretty full.
Usually, we're not very
good at keeping it watered
but it's actually super
soft and luscious still.
Super surprised.
Last year our Christmas
tree around this time
was already starting to turn brown.
All right you two, what time is it?
- Peanut butter ball time.
- Peanut butter ball time.
Rolling peanut butter balls.
- Yep. Just started our first rolling.
-  The holiday pastime of
smelling like peanut
butter until New Years.
- Mama, look at that
one. That one's spicy.
-  It's gonna seep into your skin.
-  Yeah.
(Festive music)
-  From peanut butter
balls to sugar cookie dough
and we got our own little sweet
thing over here visiting us.
Kelsey and June are here,
they just rolled a bunch
of peanut butter balls.
Now we're moving onto the
next Christmas classic.
- I know, we're just baking
all day today. Love it.
- Sugar cookies are so fun
because you can just make 'em all
and then the boys can just
decorate them however they want.
Ollie's like really enjoying
this kitchen time I feel like.
He's liking being a part
of these house duties, huh.
- Yeah, today he dried my dishes.
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah?
- You know what that means,
pretty soon he's gonna
be taking out the trash.
That's all I'm waiting for.
Are you rolling out cookie dough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  You're doing so good.
Hey Finn, I think we're
good on flour, dude.
(Festive music)
-  Look at all these
Christmasy cookie cut-outs.
What do you guys have?
Which one do you have,
Ollie? Ooh, the bow.
And Finn, you have the stocking.
And we also have a glove,
and which one's that one?
- Snowflake.
-  Ooh.
- So that's the sharp side.
You just gotta find a spot and then
push it down really hard.
Good job, Finn.
-  Right in the
middle. Good job, Ollie.
- Usually, there's like a
plan, but that's fine. So then
-  Good job, Finn.
There you go. That one works.
-  So then you can make more.
-  I'm gonna do the
-  But you don't
wanna mess up any others.
-  The gingerbread man right here.
-  Right there. Good, Finn.
You wanna do another one, Ollie?
-  Ooh, do a
snowflake right here, Ollie.
There ya go.
(Festive music)
-  Now you gotta peel
out all your cookie shapes
and put 'em on the pan,
and put them in the oven to cook them.
How they comin' out, babe?
- Pretty good. I've never done this kind.
-  Kelsey makes her
sugar cookies from scratch.
- I do, but this is a lot easier.
-  Yeah.
-  Especially with kids.
-  Yeah. Those are lookin' good.
-  If they do,
we can just fix it, kay?
-  You can just
fix it a little bit.
(Festive music)
- Ho, ho, ho.
-  Ho, ho, ho.
- Ho, ho, ho.
-  Finn is so good
at doing the ho, ho, ho
ever since he did it for the song.
- I know. Also, if you guys have noticed
whenever Finn sees Santa
Clause, he calls him Papa.
The reason why is because Papa
dressed up as Santa Clause
in The Nightmare Before
Christmas skit that we did.
-  Yes, yeah,
so now every time he sees
- We just put that together
-  (laughs)
- He's like um, Papa is Santa Clause.
I was like oh, yes.
- If you guys wanna hear
Finn sing ho, ho, ho
all cute and stuff, too, you can get
our Christmas album on iTunes right now
for only $3.99 for a limited time.
I'll have it in the iCard and
in the link down below in the description.
(Festive music)
-  I wanna try it.
-  You wanna try it? Here you go.
What do you think?
-  I try it.
-  You wanna try it, too?
-  I wanna try it.
-  Oh.
-  No. Karma gets to try it.
-  Karma got to
try it before Missy.
There are amazing. (Oven timer)
-  Done now?
- Mmm.
- But one thing is they did
not keep their shape very well.
This is how they went in the oven,
and this is how they're coming out.
-  This is how they're coming out,
and then they're even shrinking from that.
These are really poofy.
-  Yeah, that's true.
Look at all these pretty
colors and decorations.
- Yeah, we made icing, homemade icing,
-  Yes.
- and then we colored them.
We've got light blue, red,
green, and then white.
-  Yeah. (laughs)
-  So I'm excited
to see how it turns out.
-  You guys ready to decorate?
-  Yeah.
- So I'm gonna decorate
this little one right here.
I'm just gonna cover it
in a little bit of this,
and then I'm gonna use my
knife to spread it around okay?
-  Okay, but I wanna do red.
-  Okay. You can do red.
-  Is your
favorite color red, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  I think mama's
favorite color's blue.
Hey Finn, what color's your favorite?
-  Green.
- Green.
-  I think it is green.
He does always point to green.
-  (Mumbles)
(Festive music)
-  All right,
now Missy is outlining
the snowflake with her little
piping bag.
- It probably
-  Looks so ridiculous.
- Mommy, you're doing really great.
-  Thank you.
-  She's doing a good job, huh?
There you go, you got a green candy cane.
And then, Ollie, you should
do red stripes on it.
That'd be cool. There ya go.
Oh, Ollie's adding some sprinkles.
That looks good, dude.
-  No, Finn.
-  There ya go, buddy.
That looks good, Ollie.
All right, Finn is adding some
Christmas tree candies to his cookie.
Looking really good.
Hey, guess what, Finn?
We actually did a name reveal
for your brother, Finn.
Did you know this, Ollie?
We did a name reveal with sugar cookies.
- Yep. I don't now how he did so good.
- We decorated so many sugar cookies
and they looked so good,
and they were like amazing,
and they came out perfect,
and we filmed a really cool video.
That's actually a very old video.
I'll have it linked in the
iCard so you guys can watch it.
But it was when we revealed Finn's name
and we had this idea to
do it with sugar cookies.
- Yeah.
It's funny.
- I don't know why.
-  That looks
very, very good, Finn.
You did a good job.
-  Mama.
-  Yeah?
-  How's it taste, Ollie?
Is your creation good? Yep?
(Festive music)
-  Check out my gingerbread man.
He's not a gingerbread man, though.
He's a sugarbread man.
He's got a green shirt
and he's got blue jeans
and lots of sprinkles,
and he's happy, obviously.
If I was a cookie, I probably
would have a permanent
smile on my face all the time, too.
How about you, buddy?
- No, I could be a star
with some sprinkles.
-  (laughs)
(Festive music)
-  All right,
boys are ready for bed.
- Chewbacca.
-  We got Chewbacca,
and who are you, Ollie?
- Darth Vader.
-  That's right.
- What does Darth Vader
do? (making sound effects)
Luke, I am your father.
-  And what does Chewbacca do?
(making sound effects)
- Finn is actually wearing
a 4t outfit right now
'cause he really wanted
to wear Star Wars as well.
Bryan actually picked out
a really cute Santa pajama,
but he was like, no. If
Ollie's wearing Darth Vader,
then I'm wearing something Star Wars.
Do you know how many days?
- Uh, nine.
-  Eight.
- Eight?
-  Eight days 'till Christmas.
-  Oh my gosh.
- Seven for you guys. One week away.
-  Are you serious?
-  Yep. Kay. We gotta
get these down. Do, do, do.
-  Grab it. Ooh,
that's a small one.
-  A tiny one.
-  It's Belle.
You got this one? Ooh, that's cool.
It's like a storage, a tool box.
Boom. A box for your tools.
And it came with a blaster, too.
Hey Finn, look. Is that you?
- Yeah.
- That's Chewie. This is the
new book Chewie and the Porgs.
-  Should we read that one?
- Ya.
-  Should we add
that to the ever growing
stack of books? (laughs)
-  Oh.
-  Oh.
- Wow. It was a tie. Good job. High five.
-  Night, guys.
- Kids are asleep and we are enjoying
our beautiful Christmas home.
We love turning off the
lights and just relaxing
especially after the kids go to bed.
But yeah, we spent the whole day doing
traditions and just fun.
I love making my peanut butter balls
as hard work as they are.
- It's cool having, I
hate to say it, but ugly
-  Yeah (laughs)
- Christmas cookies.
-  Yeah, they're so funny.
- It's like no one's going to eat these.
-  No.
- These are gonna be
thrown away on December 26.
- We've just been having
such a fun Christmas season.
It's been so nice.
It's actually been pretty relaxing too.
Sometimes our Christmas season can be like
go, go, go and crazy, but
it's been really, really nice
and I've really enjoyed it.
And this whole week, we have even more
traditions that we're doing and
I'm just getting so excited.
We have like one week until
Christmas. It's so crazy.
Let me know down in the comments
what is your guys' favorite
Christmas tradition
that you guys do in your family?
I love making more tradition.
I feel like as the years go,
we're gonna start creating more.
And we don't even realize
that they're a tradition
until we're like, oh yeah,
we've been decorating
Christmas cookies every year
for the past three years.
I guess that's a tradition now.
I hope you guys are
having a good Christmas
but yeah, Bryan's making me some dinner.
- Yeah, just making some steak and pasta.
- You know, I gotta be honest, guys.
I've been doing a lot
more cooking, lately,
so it's pretty nice, actually
Bryan's making some dinner tonight.
- It's been really nice, just like
kind of getting taken care of for a while.
- Yeah, he's been working
really, really hard
so we've definitely been picking
up slack where it needs to.
But yeah, tonight steak
dinner sounds amazing.
I hope you guys enjoy today's video.
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up if you did
and again, let us know in the comments
what your favorite tradition is
and we will see you guys tomorrow.
-  Bye. Boop.
