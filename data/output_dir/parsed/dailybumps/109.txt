-  Finn's hair is a little wild.
Do you think it's time
for a little haircut bud?
-  Mm-hmm.
-  Yeah, I think so too.
You just twirl this thing into knots.
And I think it's time to relieve
those knots with a haircut.

He only has school twice a week but,
I like starting the vlog with you.

Ouce-ment!
- We do have an announcement?
- Yeah.
- That's right,
we do have an announcement.
Today is gonna be a really cool day
on Youtube.com/dailybumps,
'cause we are putting up
our music video today.
So when it is up I will
have it in the iCard
and link down below in the Description.
We're so excited though
'cause we had so much fun.
- Vote it video!
- Yeah, we had so much fun.
Do you remember that?
- We fought monsters!
- Ooh, get ready!
It's fun huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, we're
just hangin' in my office
with Miss Luna Lovegood.
Do you like Luna, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, can you give her a hug?
She needs some puppy love.
She needs some puppy love.
No, give her a real hug. (Ollie laughs)
Pet her.
She needs love. (laughs)
Aww, they're gettin' to
be best friends, huh?
- Yeah.
-  What is this
thing she's chewin' on.
Is that your toy?
- No, that's Finn's toy.
- Uh-oh Luna,
you're supposed to be chewing on that?
She's goin' be in trouble. (laughs)
Good morning guys.
It is a B-E-A-Utiful day here
in sunny Southern California.
- Lovegood scared me like a bam-pire.
-  She's scaring
you like a vampire?
- Yeah.
Dogs can be scary sometimes like vampires.
Today is a really fun day
because it's a big day for Finn.
Finally!
And also it's iPhone 10 release day.
So my iPhone 10 is on the
way and I'm really excited.
And of course I'll show it to you guys
and we can have some fun with it.
Hey what do you want to do today kiddo?
It's Friday.
- Friday?
- Dude, it's Friday!
What do you want to do?
- I want do is go
to Billy Beez.
- He always wants to go to Billy Beez
and play at the indoor playground.
Maybe, okay?
- Okay.
(upbeat music sting)
- Ready? (Ollie laughs)
Kisses, kisses, not me, him, Karma!
Kisses, kisses,
eww, eww!
Oh not me! (Missy laughs)
-  Did he kiss you on the mouth?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Eww!
Ollie, you are lookin' so
handsome today. (laughs)
Ollie is gettin' in the
car and Finn is in the car,
and Finn's hair is a little wild.
Do you think it's time
for a little haircut bud?
- Mm-hmm
- Yeah, I think so too.
You just twirl this thing into knots.
And I think it's time to relieve
those knots with a haircut.
Me and my mom are headed
out, and as you guys can see,
Finny is forward-facing, aren't you baby?
You get to see mama?
(kids yelling)
And so is Ollie.
It's pretty cool that I can see them both.
But I will say, this is not
necessarily my preference.
I think I've did rear-facing with Ollie
'til he was two and a half.
-  Yeah.
- I did it as far as I could
pretty much take it. (laughs)
But Finn, it has been has
been kind of torturous
and I've just wanted to
make sure I make it to two.
But as you guys know, every
time we leave the house,
Finn screams, he cries,
he gets super car sick.
He often throws up, which is really hard.
And I kinda just held it
out as long as I could
and once he reached two I was like,
"I think I'm just gonna turn him around."
'Gain, it's not my preference.
I'd prefer him to be rear-facing
'cause I know it is actually a lot safer.
And if you don't know
about that, rear-facing,
extended rear-facing is a lot
safer than forward-facing,
and it does give me a
little anxiety with him,
forward-facing,
but think it was just
kind of the right decision
for our family at this time.
But it is pretty cute.
I love being able to just turn around
and see your face, huh?
- Ya.
- Yeah, ha ha!
And he has been a lot happier in the car
'cause he can see me and talk to me
and he knows that I'm listening to him.
Are you ready to go?
- I wanna talk.
- Yeah, say stop talkin' mama.
And now when we take the truck,
they can both watch the movie, huh?
Finn, where we headed?
- What we gonna do?
- D'er!
-  Are we gonna cut your hair?
- Ya.
-  Yeah!
Are you excited to watch your
brother get his hair cut?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, you love haircuts, huh?
- Yeah.
- I am a little nervous
because Ollie's first few haircuts
were not his favorite.
He would cry, he would move a lot,
and it was a little stressful.
But now Ollie loves getting his haircut.
And I'm hoping that maybe Finn
will, since Ollie loves it.
- And I'm hoping that the curls stays.
- Yes, we are hoping that--
- Pretty sure that he has curly hair.
-  I think his curly hair.
I feel like this is a little too long,
and just the fact that he
can twirl it into a knot,
I don't like either.
But hopefully you still
got your curly hair after.
(upbeat, playful music)
-  Gonna fly!
-  Yay.
He was totally fine and then
he freaked out. (laughs)
Poor baby.
We're gonna try sittin' with Mimi.
- Yup, no problem.
-  What's that?
Finn, you're doin' so good, high five.
High five.
Yeah, knuckles.
Good job dude.
- Put your arm up here
please. (razor buzzing)
-  You're doin' so good.
I'm so proud of you bud.
You getting your first haircut?
(gasps) You got a haircut!
It's so short.
I miss it already.
But it definitely still has it's curl.
You've got curly hair.
Check it out guys.
What do you think of your hair?
Do you like it?
He's like, "I don't know mom,
"I gotta go play."
(upbeat, playful music)
And they also sent me home
with this cute little thing
that says my first haircut
and it's got his cute
little curly hairs in it.
So cute.
I was actually really surprised,
'cause he was just sittin'
in that chair, totally cool.
And then last second he
totally freaked out. (laughs)
- Crocodile tears.
- I know, he was like,
"Get me out of here.
"I'm not doing this."
So he sat with Mimi.
- Now walk, walk.
- He sat with Mimi, and he
did a really good job, so yay!
(upbeat music sting)
- I may have embarrassed
Corbin a little bit
because I was running after the UPS man.
- He literally heard the
breaks squeaking (Bryan laughs)
and ran out that door.
- Yeah and I chased him down.
iPhone 10 is here!
- Yeah!
- I'm so excited to try out
this new Apple iPhone 10.
- Yes.
- It just came.
It's early too, it's noon,
so I'm really excited.
Corbin's gonna vlog me unboxing it.
♫ Doo-dah-doo-doo
Whoa, look at that dude.
-  Oh shoot, that is so cool.
- All Screen iPhone.
-  Dang, it's all glass too huh?
That is so cool.
-  The front and back.
- It's all glass too.
And you know what, it's so
much smaller than the Plus.
-  Oh really?
- I might love it.
-  That's cool.
- I might love being
on a smaller phone now.
-  Yeah something the
big phones are just too big.
That's cool
- Take this off.
Oh it's turning on.
This is so weird.
It doesn't feel like an iPhone.
-  No?
- It feels like--
-  It looks way small.
- Dude look at that.
-  That is so cool.
- Oh, oh my goodness.
-  The screen's all white.
- Yeah, this is gonna be
perfect, look at that.
-  Whoa, it looks
so crazy. (Bryan laughs)
Oh my God.
-  Isn't that cool?
-  Quick start,
that is really cool.
- Okay I finally have my iPhone activated
and now I'm going to set up Face ID.
Okay I'm really excited about this.
Okay, position your head
in the camera frame,
move your head in a circle.
Move your head slowly
to complete the circle.
-  This is so weird.
It's the future, dude!
-  Done, first face
ID scan complete, cool.
(phone beeping)
Okay, I'm gonna try and use
Anemoji on the new iPhone 10.
Tap to start.
Okay, I definitely wanna be poop?
-  Poop,
rabbit,
unicorn?
-  Look I can be
one of Missy's chickens.
-  That is so cool.
- Oh hey! (chuckles)
-  That's awesome.
- Hey babe, what would you
do if one of your chickens
just came into the house
and started talking to you like this?
Would you freak out?
Or would you be like?
Sending Missy an Anemoji
now for the first time.
She's gonna be so jealous
that she can't do this on
her phone. (Corbin laughs)
Hey babe, what would you
do if one of your chickens
just came into the house
and started talking to you like this?
Would you freak out?
Or would you be like?
(upbeat, lively music)
Alright so I have met up
with Finn and the boys,
and Kelsey and Corbin too.
- Aah!
- We just ate a ton of
pho, which was so good.
I love Finn's new haircut.
He looks so different.
- He looks like a grown up.
He looks like a man.
- He's a little boy.
He's a little boy. (smooching)
He's like, "I know."
(Missy and Bryan laugh)
Oh he doesn't like the blue? (laughs)
He's like, "Give me somethin' better."
- Alright, we are back home.
We actually did a little bit of shoppin',
some fun stuff with
Kelsey and Corbin today.
But now the kids just
finished eating their dinner
and I've got cookies in the oven, mm-mm!
They were so good today,
and we had promised them all day
that we were gonna go to a
playground and do something fun,
and then our whole day just
ended up getting swept away.
And so these boys ate their
dinner like a good boy.
Did you eat all your dinner?
- Yeah.
-  I'm so proud of you.
Finn?
Did you eat all your dinner?
- Aah!
-  You're so cute
with your little haircut,
you know that?
- Aah! (Missy laughs)
Yeah I know.
- Yeah, you look like a little man.
And since they ate all their dinner
they are gonna get a cookie.
So I'm pretty excited about that.
And I though I would break
out one if Finn's toys
that he got for his birthday,
that we kind of put away
for a day when we're like,
"Ooh, let's play with something fun."
And so I'm gonna break out
the Marvel Mr. Potato Head.
It's Spiderman versus Iron Man.
It's got two Mr. Potato heads
and then all kinds of fun
little do-dads that go with it.
So I'm pretty excited.
I think the boys are
gonna be super excited.
I don't remember who this is from.
I feel really bad.
But I know they are gonna
be so excited, ready?
(gasps)
(box bangs)
What do you think of that?
(growling)
That look fun?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Which one is the bad guy?
-  I don't even
think there is a bad guy.
I think this just a bunch
of fun stuff to play with
and they're both good guys.
So lets open it up 'kay?
Da da da!
Spiderman.
What's Spiderman's theme song?
♫ Spiderman, Spiderman, does
whatever a spiderman can
I don't know. (laughs)
I think that's it.
And then Iron Man, I don't
know Iron Man's song.
- Iron Man doesn't have a song.
-  Oh, okay.
Well you would know.
-  His gear kit comes off.
-  Wow,
alright let's open all the
little special toys, 'kay?
Cookies are done.
Oop.
(alarm beeping)
Ooh yeah, those look delicious.
Don't worry, we've packed your angry eyes.
Look at these things. (laughs)
The boys are having a blast right now.
Putting them all together.
Look at that guy, he looks scary.
Oh you're gonna put his
eyeballs in his ear slot?
-  Yeah.
- That just looks weird. (laughs)
(bouncy, playful music)
Alright, and guess what boys?
- What?
- Cookies are done.
Tell me how they are? (Finn whines)
Careful, careful, they're gooey and hot.
There you go.
Whoa, look at that, all over me.
How is it?
- Good. (Missy laughs)
I mean--
-  Does mama make
the best cookies ever?
- Mm-hmm.
- That's right.
And I would say that these
cookies turned out amazing.
Because as you can tell, I
went a little bit crispier.
I am more of a crispy,
crunchy, cookie girl.
Bryan is more of a
chewy, gooey, cookie guy.
So let me know down in the Comments,
do you like your cookies chewy and soft,
or do you like 'em a little crunchy?
Let me know.
- Oh, look at my little elf.
Look at my little elf.
He's so cute, wearin' his
Christmas jammies. (Finn laughs)
Finn did you like your
first haircut today?
- Ya.
- You did?
- Ya.
- His hair looks so good,
doesn't it you guys?
- On-gia-on-da-y-e, gia.
- Oh really?
- Oh.
- Oh! (laughs)
(Finn gurgles)
- He is so cute now with his new haircut.
I just love it.
But anyway that's all for today's video.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
If you did be sure to give it a Thumbs Up.
Yay, Thumbs Up if you
enjoyed today's video.
We'll see you manana.
Finn, you wanna do bye, boo?
Say bye.
-  Boo!
-  Poop!
(upbeat, energetic music)
