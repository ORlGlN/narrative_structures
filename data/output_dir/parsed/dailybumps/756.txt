I
because Brian we used with the car
sometimes I then do not have a car and
so my sister came over to pick us up and
we're going over to my mom's so that if
I need to go somewhere which I do I have
a car which is seriously having a
problem so I think I officially made it
next week I have to get a car because
it's just getting to the point where
Brian is going places and taking the car
and then I'm either stuck with no car
and I have to go places it's getting
really confusing Kathy's here picking me
up and the boys we're gonna head over to

me me my buzz oh okay so I just got out
of the Dennis I am so numb oh my gosh my
ear right here my ear is numb
is that normal I I feel really weird um
I feel like there's still like a ton of
stuff in my mouth
but there is it um that was not fun uh
whoever says that's fun they're lying
why am I even vlogging right now okay
I think I think I need to like chill a
little bit before I leave cuz I feel
really weird my lip feels like ten times
bigger than it is also is that normal I
keep asking questions but you're not
answering okay deep breath okay I'm
hungry I can't eat like three hours
okay
brush your teeth kids brush um thank you
ollie for putting a bb-8 on his head
don't squish it be honest with me okay
am i a lazy mom for only putting Finn in
sleepers I can't stand putting him in
like shirts and pants and like outfits
because it's kind of cold out and I just
wanted to be comfortable warm and I want
it to be easy to change his diaper
whereas with Ollie I always put him in
like outfits every single day no matter
what but I think I did it because it was
hot out it was the middle of summer and
so I wanted to be able to like take
layers off if I wanted you know I could
take his pants off and he could just
wear a onesie and this child
I swear has never worn a onesie ever
because I just put him in sleepers all
the time I just think they're cute I
think they're warm I think they're
comfortable and easy so I don't know I
just I think it's kind of weird though
cuz every day like I'll get him dressed
out of his you know night clothes or his
pajamas and then I put him in like more
pajamas let me know what did you guys do
when you had newborns and how did you
dress them and what was easier for you
what's easiest you like your little
webinar doggy so cute alright so I have
been running around doing some errands
but I just met up with Brian he just got
those of the dentist and he is not a
happy guy it hurts hah I just sucks they
had to numb me a lot he says his whole
head was like numb yeah my ears my hat
my forehead like up here was not
that sucks I'm glad it's over yeah he
got it over with he's all done him any
more cavities to do it so now we're just
heading into Starbucks we got Geoffrey
here by the way it just means a lot
we're gonna mount ops Roger ERT alley
say top secret yeah molly is trying on
his very first cake pop what do you
think ollie
good good good bite you know what to
lick it like a normal sucker you take a
bite yeah there you go
got a little bit you saw in the window
and he was like sucker sucker my god
it's not a sucker really hi cried the
whole way
everywhere we go he cries the whole way
the entire way alright guys it's been a
busy day for us we just finished our
meeting at Starbucks which went really
well really cool stuff we're working on
just you guys know it's like more
personal family stuff versus like
YouTube business stuff yeah so but it's
still pretty cool we've been working on
things for a long time now I'm trying to
get things moving but we've done with
that and we just drove to all garden
we're actually having dinner with
Michelle and Maddy Maddy faith who's the
one who performed at the EP party and
was on my EP you guys know Maddie yeah
but this kid seriously screams the
entire way you know what I really do
want to because a lot of people
suggesting us do like a bigger party
like all these parties oh yeah
five pounds to like 40 or something the
one all is it yeah so he could be enough
him in it oh geez I might like the hey
the truth is it's not I always think
it's the party I'm totally willing to
try and we show does we have to of
always Percy we can totally try it out
yeah the problem is is that I don't
think has anything to do with what he's
sitting in it has to do with the fact
that he's just not in my arms yeah he
doesn't like the chorus wants to be very
needy baby and I was always thinking
like holy wasn't that needy but honestly
when we had Ollie we were with Missy's
parents and everyone was holding the
baby so he was probably fine being
helpful
like we if we could didn't couldn't hold
him and girls wanted to hold him anyways
so I mean it's really an option to try
out the other thing it's not like he
like falls asleep in his car see and
then we won't be able to pick it up and
go into the store like every time we
stop the car I gotta get him out of the
car seat so although the one thing with
ollie is that he loved music and so if
we put R or Gary music what does the Fox
say yeah if we like put it on he would
be like hence I love it and you just
yeah not fun no thing does not care
about what does the Fox say at all I
think he gets more mad like just give me
the bird all right all he's hanging on
right okay keep hanging on don't let go
do you like that is that fun
no I gotcha
ah how's that okay hey Ollie guess where
we're going no we're going to Oliver
