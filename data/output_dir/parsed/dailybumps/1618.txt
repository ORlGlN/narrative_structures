boy Oliver has been busting for like
past 30 minutes I've tried like rocking
him and like seeing him lullabies but
nothing works except if I stand up and
dance with him and seeing Miley Cyrus as
soon as I started seeing like a song
that's like cool it that's the only
thing that works I can't see I'm tringle
to gold star and I can't trick him by
singing twinkle twinkle little star in
like a hip-hop version doesn't work here
has to be a Miley Cyrus song and I have
to dance and that's why we came up with
the saying they only didn't come with
the saying but when I say dance monkey
dance it's because the only way is if we
just dance with Harry it's like he tells
us
dance monkey
ah this is what we just ate for dinner

crawled up a long hair is a good thing
so tonight was the end of Breaking Bad
it's done it's over what do you think I
don't know is it was hard it's over it's
over I don't know what you guys think of
the finale let me know in the comments
now well if they haven't watched by now
here's my rule you guys if there's
something big going on you do not go on
youtube who do not go on Facebook you do
not go on Twitter until you've read the
last chapter watch the last episode or I
don't know what else what else is there
and you are known for always giving away
the ending if he knows something he will
not keep it in it is going to be out
there within seconds so - I have a
problem ok I'm sorry
so Missy totally inspired me yesterday
have you seen yesterday's vlog it's
crazy she basically did the mud run and
she took the GoPro and it was insane
watching her do it all but I was like
totally like inspired and like super
proud of her because she finished a 5k
two months after having that little
thing over there that the thing that's
sleeping Carmen are you gonna keep him
company but anyway I was like you know
what I really I would love to say that
I've done something like that and I
didn't feel like I would be prepared all
to do the mud run with her but there's a
couple things coming up next month that
I could totally take part in and I mean
October is gonna be Shay Tober for Shay
Carl's doing the shayloss thing about
like getting in shape and went on stuff
and I was like maybe I'll do that maybe
I will it's been a while since I've done
that you guys have followed me last time
I did that I have a couple options okay
next month there is gonna be there's the
Color Run which is going to be in San
Diego or there's the Oktoberfest beer
run where they give you beer and
sausages afterward
it's and it's like this big Oktoberfest
celebration and so I'm not sure which
one to choose which one do you guys
think I should do I hear the color runs
really cool it is in San Diego so it's a
little bit farther but yeah and let me
know too if you guys would be interested
in organizing like a team if Missy and I
set up like a bumper team and then you
guys can be a part of it and we could do
like maybe a little like meetup thing
and just like run together and take a
ton of pictures and like I just think
that'd be like the coolest thing ever so
let me know in the comments if that's
something that you guys would be willing
to do and let me know which one I should
do I kind of leaning toward the
Oktoberfest beer run because it sounds
fun and it's close so but I totally want
to do it and I think that I'm gonna just
take sort of this opportunity to work
and try and get in shape again I think
that would be I think that this would be
a good month for me to do it what do you
think karma like yeah your fatty get on
the treadmill fatty okay I would tell
you that he would have loved that Mud
Run
oh my gosh karma would have killed it
out there weren't you so badly it was I
am funny look at him he just like climbs
up on my chair he's like hi I love you
don't forget about me don't forget about
me all puppy love anyway I'm gonna let
you guys go well that's kind of what my
mom says when she calls me on the phone
but I hope you guys enjoyed the vlog oh
oh I didn't I don't think I showed the
chalkboard up there
do you like the chalkboard yeah coolness
alright we'll see you guys tomorrow
this little guy won't look at him he is
like is he he's like smiling but he's
got the binky hanging out of his mouth
