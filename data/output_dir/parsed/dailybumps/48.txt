- Hey guys.
- So we thought we should
throw up a little quick
update video to you guys
on our YouTube channel.
Missy and I are actually
headed on a vacation.
- Yay.
- It's gonna be the first
vacation that we've never vlogged
or had to upload videos
or anything like that.
- Yeah. Like we've done a lot of trips
and we've gone on a lot of vacations,
but we are not vlogging on this vacation
and I am so excited to have
quality time with my husband
and not worry about at thing.
- We'll take
lots of pictures and if you
guys want to follow along
with us make sure you're
following both of us on Instagram
at Bryan Lanning, at Missy Lanning.
We might be Instagram story-ing a time.
We might be posting.
- I think I'm sure we will be.
- Yeah. So check us out on Instagram.
- You guys can find out where we're going.
- Yeah. We're gonna
have a blast this week.
It's gonna be really, really cool.
The next thing you're gonna wanna do guys
is make sure that you're not
only subscribed to this channel
but you also have your
notifications on for this channel.
And I'm gonna tell you
why for a couple reasons.
But first, if you are not subscribed
to this channel, pay attention to this.
If you are subscribed, just, it's okay.
Just like listen and maybe like
send a text message you've
been waiting for or something.
Send a tweet.
Okay. So Missy's going to now demonstrate
what to do if you are not
subscribed to our channel.
And I actually have it up
here on the monitor, too.
What you're gonna want to do is
find this big, red button on the side.
It says subscribe.
And it actually says 3.1 million people,
so three million people have
already done it so why not you?
So click that button.
And then you're also gonna want to click
that little bell next to that button.
So click that. Boom.
And that is gonna basically tell you
when we upload a new video, or it should.
It should notify you on your device
or whatever you watch on.
And you're gonna want this on
because our upload schedule
is going to be changing slightly.
Like we said in our five year Q&A,
we want to do some really big things
these next five years and
we honestly just need to
open up our schedule to
be able to have that time.
I feel like daily has been
super fun on this channel.
It's how we started.
But I feel like daily blogging
isn't so much a thing anymore
because it's kind of becoming
more of a harder thing to do,
especially in creating content,
quality content for YouTube.
So that being said, we have a lot
of really big things we
want to do this year.
We want to involve you guys and
we have some really cool plans.
So make sure you're subscribed.
Make sure you're notified
so you know what's going on.
You're gonna have to be notified
cause you guys aren't gonna
know when we upload a new video.
You're gonna want to see it.
But yeah, we do have some cool
videos coming out this week
and this weekend is gonna be a blast.
- And I just want you guys to know that
we have loved daily vlogging and trust me,
there is still going
to be plenty of content
going out and our content's not changing.
You're still gonna see all
of us doing our fun stuff
in daily life.
-  Growing, adapting,
and learning and all that fun stuff.
- Yeah. And I will say that we
have mastered daily vlogging.
We've found a way to vlog.
- I was gonna say that, too.
I really feel like we have
found a really great way
to put a video out every
day and to make it work.
And it's hard and it took us
like four years to figure it out.
I feel like this last year I've been like
we've basically mastered this.
But in order for us to do anything else,
we kind of just need a little
more leeway in the schedule.
- Yeah.
We've found a way to do it so it really
does not interfere in our life.
You know, our kids barely
notice the camera and all that,
but we just, we want to do
more things, bigger things.
That's why we're gonna try
and change it up a little bit.
It's still gonna be exciting for you guys.
You guys probably won't notice a lot.
- But we just want to
keep you guys in the loop
because you guys are
awesome and we love you and
your support and we couldn't
be doing this without you.
And we're going to need your
help these next five years.
Cause we want to do
some really big things.
I want to make an impact
and I want to make change
and so we want to take you
guys along for it, too.
- But anyways, make sure you guys
give this video a big thumbs up.
- If you've made it this far in the video,
click the thumbs up button
so we know, you guys.
- Yeah.
- We don't really do this a
whole lot, but it'd be cool
to see how many of you
click the thumbs up button.
- Yes, of course.
And we just want you guys to know how much
we appreciate you guys
and we love this channel.
It is our passion and we are so excited.
- We're gonna do some
crazy things with it.
- So, yeah.
- As Missy gets tongue tied.
- Yeah. We are so excited to see
what the future of
Daily Bumps has to hold.
So make sure you guys are subscribed
and got the notifications on.
Make sure you're following
us on all our social media
cause you're gonna see
a lot of cool stuff.
- Okay babe.
We gotta go.
We gotta get on the airplane.
- Let's go.
Alright. See you guys later.
Bye.
