-  What is it?
- It knows me!
-  It knows you?
How does it know you?
- Say Ollie.
(toy noise)
-  It talks to you?
(toy noise)
Say farted.
(toy noise)
-  It said farted?
- Yeah.
♫ Wherever you are
♫ That's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a life
♫ And that soft sun side
♫ Big blue eyes looked up inside
♫ This is home
♫ Just running' around
♫ You never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight
♫ Cuddling all I could to you
♫ I am home
♫ Home's wherever you're with me
- Good morning, guys.
It is bright and early
and we are gettin' up for the day
'cause you have school.
He's eatin' his breakfast.
Are you excited for your day?
- Yes.
- Every morning I try
and perfect the morning
so that he has more time to eat breakfast
less being late.
Which we've never been late,
but I'm just kind of like a-
I get a lot of, like, stress
when I feel like we're gonna be late
or if we're getting close to being late.
I am still trying, actually.
I set my clock this
morning 15 minutes earlier
than I usually do
and I figured out my problem.
It's 'cause I don't like to wake up.
(laughs)
Once I'm up, I'm great
but I hate that waking up part.
We need to get ready and go.
And you're all ready, huh?
Momma got you all dressed
as soon as you woke up.
What are you doin'?
Go take another bite.
Got his lunch all packed,
and we've got some water,
some apples and carrots,
an Uncrustable,
Goldfish,
Ane even some little Scooby Snacks
if he makes it all the way to that point.
Alright, Ollie, do you want to show me
what's in your back pack this morning?
- Yeah
-  Alright, go ahead
and unzip it right here.
He's like, "Hello, good morning"
What is the first thing in there?
Mr. Monkey!
So he's coming back to school
to cuddle during nap time,
right?
Yay.
He's very excited about that.
Alright, what's the next thing in there?
A new blankie.
He has a blanket there,
but this one matches now
his crib sheet, so that's kinda cool.
And it's a very comfy, soft one.
What else is in there?
An ... What is it?
- A alligator game!
-  The alligator game.
(playful music)
- Tomorrow, at preschool, is share day.
So share day is where
you get to bring one toy,
and you get to share
with all your friends.
Does that sound fun?
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, but for this week, the letter is A
which means you have to
bring a toy to school
that starts with the letter A.
We've got three options
here to choose from.
We've got Spiderman.
Spiderman would be really
fun to bring to school, huh?
- Cool.
- Yeah.
We've got car
Ooh
And we've got the aligator game.
So which one of these toys
starts with the letter A?
How did you know that?
How did you know that?
-  Ollie, what is this?
- Aligator game.
-  The aligator starts with a ...?
- A, A, apple!
- A
You're so right!
That was so smart of him,
I'm so proud of him!
So you're gonna bring the aligator game,
does that sound good, Ollie?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
- You're gonna show all
your friends how to play it.
Do you know how to play?
-  Ahh!
- So you're gonna share
this with all your friends
and show them how to play, okay?
Yeah, so excited!
- I hope Kate can be there.
- Yeah, I think she's gonna be there.
-  That is the aligator
game that you get to do
for Share Day, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Are you excited to share it?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, should be fun.
(happy music)
- Hey guys
So I am headed to pick
up Ollie from preschool
and I am so excited because
I really wanna hear how his
very first show-and-tell went.
I remember as a kid
I used to love show-and-tell.
And we did it all the way up until-
I believe it was second
grade or third grade.
Yeah, it was third-
I remember doing show-and-tell
in third grade, you guys.
And I always loved picking
out an object to bring
and show everyone, and it was a big thing
when you were a kid.
So.
I'm excited to see how Ollie's
first "Share Day" went,
that's what they call it, although,
it should really be
called, "show-and-tell."
Come on.
We are gonna have a fun afternoon,
so Ollie and I are gonna
get to go to lunch.
I'm gonna go to lunch,
and he's gonna bring his lunch
that we packed him this morning.
And then we're going to
get our hair cuts, also.
I'm excited to see how it all went.
And it is a beautiful day.
You guys see these blue skies?
It's gorgeous today.
Another B-E-A-utiful day here
in sunny Southern California.
Look who it is, you guys!
- Hi.
-  How was school?
- Good.
- Good. And how did show-and-tell go?
- Good.
- Good?
What did people say about your aligator?
- There's four alligators.
- Someone brought three other alligators?
- Yes!
- There was four alligators
in show-and-tell today, apparently, huh?
- Yeah.
- That is so funny.
And you had your alligator game.
Did you play it with anyone?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Did you and Peyton play?
- Mm-hmm.
- And who won?
- Me!
- You did?
- Yes.
- Alright, you ready to get some lunch?
He already started eating his lunch.
He was doing so good.
So he's gonna finish his lunch with me.
- Where alligators live?
-  Alligators live in the water.
- Water?
-  Yeah.
And on land.
They can go in both.
You need to tie your shoe.
- Let's do this.
(happy music)
-  Alright, Ollie,
what are we doing now?
- Getting our haircuts!
-  Yeah.
- I opened my door by myself!
- Good job!
Let's go, dude.
Just finished up lunch,
and now we are going to visit Travis,
and he is gonna cut our hairs.
Right?
- Yep.
- Yep.
I love this little area
where the haircut place is.
This is where that starlight bazar was at.
(wild west music)
- Hey, Ollie, you wanna try on some hats?
- No.
-  No? (laughs)
He's not a fan of hats.
Dude, look, they have one in your size.
What do you think? (laughs)
-  Ollie is in such a mood today.
He's being so sassy with everyone.
Ollie, are you picking fights with Travis?
Alright, time for haircuts.
( wild west music)
- Get suckers for a haircut.
-  You're welcome buddy.
-  Lookin' good, dude.
Here. You wanna facetime
Mama and show her?
Alright, you guys, we got our haircut.
What do you think?
Do you like Daddy's haircut?
Yeah?
It looks good?
What do you wanna do now?
- I wanna get ice cream at here!
- We should get ice cream?
Okay.
There is a little ice
cream place down here.
This is becoming a ritual for Ollie now.
- I wanna get vanilla ice cream.
-  That's all?
Vanilla?
- Yeah.
- It's like a fancy ice cream place,
so sometimes they have weird flavors.
- Want one vanilla.
- Okay.
One vanilla?
- Okay.
Just got my haircut.
Feels so good.
I know you love strawberry ice cream, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- The bigger ice cream is the best.
-  It's pretty good.
This place is so old fashioned,
country western.
I love it.
You don't really see a lot
of places like this in California,
so it's actually really fun.
(adventurous music)
-  All these flavors,
and he chooses vanilla!
Right?
- Yes.
-  Is that your favorite? (laughs)
- I'm hugging you, dad.
- Ollie, look.
Isn't that cool?
There you go, dude.
What do you say?
- Thank you.
(wild west music)
-  Alright, we have found
a great place to sit outside, huh?
How is that very plain vanilla ice cream?
Is it good? (laughs)
He likes it.
I didn't realize how many
cool places there are
in this little area.
There's, like, artisanal
food products, pizzeria,
Oak Creek Farm and Nursery,
that's cool, they probably have
lots of cool plants in there.
Temecula Clay, Juice Bar ...
There's always lots to do here
which is really cool.
-  Run, run run!
These boys have been playing
since Ollie got home.
Fin missed him so badly.
I wanted to show you
guys what I've been doing
in Fin's room.
I finally cleaned out his closet.
There have been stacks of clothes in here
that have probably been in here for, like,
I'm not even kidding,
like two years. (laughs)
Now ... like, his whole room,
I haven't really gone through his clothes
in like, two years, obviously.
He's almost two years old
which means that in his
drawers, there were, like,
three month clothes, still.
I'm like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so bad."
So I was actually able to
donate three huge black bags
of tons of things.
But I was able to also
keep some of ... like ...
Memorabilia stuff.
And then I got a bunch of really
cute stuff to give to June,
which I'm excited about.
And then I got a ton of
new clothes for Ollie.
Or, actually, for Fin, that were Ollie's.
These are all Ollie's old clothes,
so I'm excited to see Fin in them.
A you can see, there are
a lot of Christmas stuff,
so he might not be wearing
them right away, but ...
Yay, do you guys remember this?
He used to wear this.
It was so cute.
This was Ollie's, so
it'll be fun to see Fin
in all of Ollie's old clothes.
My parents just brought over
this little rodent thing.
Come here, Fin, show me.
What is it?
- It knows me!
-  It knows you?
How does it know you?
- Say Ollie!
(toy noise)
-  It talks to you?
(toy noise)
- Say farted!
(toy noise)
- It said farted?
- Yeah. (laughs)
Are you stinky?
(toy noise)
Are you stinky?
(toy noise)
-  I love you.
(toy noise)
- Meh.
-  Is that your rodent?
Aw. It looks like a hamster. (laughs)
It mimics you a lot.
- Say tree house!
(toy repeats)
-  Alright, we're
hangin' out outside
and my parents are over because ...
Look at me!
I've transformed!
I'm going out tonight with Bryan
and I think we're actually
gonna bring the camera.
We don't normally bring the
camera when we go on a date,
but we thought maybe we
might do that tonight.
So the boys are gonna stay
here with Mimi and Papa
and hopefully go to sleep.
- Hi.
- We're out on out date.
It's loud in here.
- We are playing Harry Potter
Trivia at a local British pub.
And I am stoked!
I just ordered a butter
beer, and a Slitherin shot.
- I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.
We've never done anything like this.
- It's very loud.
Alright, our team name is the
Whomping Weaselby Winners,
and we are seated next to ...
Say "Hey!"
- Hey.
-  What's your guys' team name?
- The Real Housegirls of Diagon Alley.
-  Genius!
Iconic.
Good luck.
Funny story, I went to them
to figure out how to sign up
instead of the guy that I was
looking to go to to sign up
and I talked to them for
a good ten minutes before
they informed me they were not
the place where you sign up
to do the trivia.
So ...
- Luckily, though, we've done it before.
- Yeah.
(Victorian royal music)
-  Second year, Vealroy Lockheart
Third year, Remus Lupin
Fourth, Madeye Moody (inaudible)
-  (cheers) You got it!
30 points.
- Final question.
-  (laughs) Everyone got it right.
- There's a lot of Harry Potter fans here.
-  What vault did Hagrid remove the
Sorcerer's Stone from
in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?
-  Oh, man.
- What vault was it?
Okay, hang on, hang on.
- Leave it in the comments
down below if you know.
He's been so into this you guys.
We're not winning, but he
only got one question wrong.
- I'm in 12th place.
- Yeah.
But everyone here is so smart.
Usually, it's like a betting order,
so we're in 12th place,
he only got one question wrong, but ...
- I think it's called 397
- Ooh.
- It's not- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I think it's vault 397.
-  713
-  Aw!
- That was wrong.
-  Aw, 713 ...
I got the seven and three right.
- The team names are the best.
-  The Who You Horcrux
- (laughs) Who You Horcrux.
-  Who You Horcrux,
You can come on up and
get your $10 certificate.
-  Whoo!
- Alright, we are home
and we had such a fun night.
It was really awesome,
and even though I didn't really play a lot
it was still fun to watch Bryan play,
'Cause he had a blast.
Kids are asleep.
It's not super late, but
definitely time for bed.
So make sure you give
this video a big thumbs up
if you enjoyed it.
Let us know what you thought
of that Harry Potter game
and if you knew some of the answers.
I think we only showed
you guys one question.
- Let us know what your
favorite Harry Potter book is
in the comments.
- Okay.
Leave that in the comments,
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Do you wanna say "Bye boo"?
Boy's like, "I'm playing
with a lego, Mom."
Ready?
Bye.
