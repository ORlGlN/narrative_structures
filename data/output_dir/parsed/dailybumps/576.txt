we just hopped on the plane me and Sid
and these lovely ladies and we are in
Hawaii we did a last-minute trip and I'm
super excited to tell you guys all about
it
that's right weird Hawaii and basically
here's the story originally this was at
my aunt Christy and Tara Lintz trip and
they're actually gonna be here for a
while but she was like you guys should
come me and Natalia and I was like I
don't know like she literally told us
about it like two days ago and I was
like I don't know it sounds crazy and
then we talked about it for a little bit
and I was like that actually sounds so
much fun and thanks to our amazing
husbands who were like go for it
do it it'd be fun here we are in Hawaii
and I brought Finn
trust me if he was old enough I'd
probably be leaving him home too but not
and I'll enjoy him and I'll miss Olly
Animus Brian I wish they could come but
it's also kind of a girls trip and plus
Finn but I'm really excited we're
actually gonna be staying at my aunt
Christie's friend's house and we're just
going to enjoy them more probably like a
more local type of Hawaii experience
versus like a touristy experience so I
think it's gonna be really cool and I
think they've got some fun stuff planned
for us so we're just here for a couple
days kind of a quick little trip to have
fun and I'm exciting it is gonna be so
much fun
