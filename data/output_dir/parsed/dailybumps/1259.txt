smells out there and it smells in here
you guys
sweat 30 people here son baby that boy
is gonna do amazing things and how you
doing this morning someone here nope
just looking at everything going on out
there good morning guys how's it going
um we've just been having are doing our
morning routine watching some Mickey he
loves it and I love it because it's
Disney karma trying to come in come on
in did you go potty
what was that whining for just random
he's been doing a lot better day
yesterday he was just like off or
something and I was actually the yeah me
I was gone a lot of the day so I'm
wondering if maybe he just was a little
bit emotional and um cuz I normally
spend a lot of time apart so maybe it
was just that I don't know um but it
also could have very well been his teeth
because I know they've been hurting but
he slept great last night all night
didn't wake up one huh didn't wake up
one time monitor is still broken and I
definitely a SAP if you guys have like
any temporary solutions for something
that I can do so I can hear him easily
while he's in his car I don't need to
actually see him I just need to be able
to hear him if you were to cry or
something is even though it's like just
on the other side of the wall I can't
seem to hear him very well so I was
thinking maybe I'll just do a FaceTime
call for my iPad but I could only do
that maybe at night and that seems kind
of kind of a lot to put it on FaceTime
all night long
dude you know you're not supposed to do
this this doesn't no no
mmm-hmm no no good morning guys guess
what new view next work every time I get
a new v-neck I always think of gotta

don't know if it looks like if my hair
is just driving me insane tonight today
it's like so big and curly Bryan doesn't
look as cool as it feels it looks as
below it looks very little just oh make
sure you get over to the left
watch all very very fluffy and so I'm
trying to keep it tame I finished my
Outlander book so I have to get the next
one obviously and it's funny cuz I
thought I had it and I started reading
the next book that I thought I had and I
was like what what what is going on and
then it ended up being the fourth book
and I was like digging it so I'd go get
the second book I'm just saying that a
Harry Potter fan probably wouldn't make
them that is probably true I don't know
why I don't know the names of all the
books they're very confusing I honestly
can't even describe you how excited I am
to walk into this store alright Noble I
was looking on online all this Morni
about like all the different books that
are here that I have my English
companion I don't think so
but they have a ton of like side books
that I've never read that I would love
to wait to so I'm really excited it's
Jamie it doesn't matter where you came
from your EML look at all these
Outlander books holy cannoli I really
really want this one let me find it Lord
John and the Brotherhood cool I have to
say you guys I've always had this weird
like dream or like goal to like walk
into Barnes and Nobles and be like oh
yeah this is my book you know what I
mean I've always had in the back of my
mind that I've always wanted to be like
a published author be so cool coming to
Barnes & Nobles and seeing my books
these are not my books obviously
dragonfly and amber that's one you want
right is this the second one yeah that
sounds romantic oh my gosh you guys
Captain Underpants I used to read that
all the time when I was in school babe
did you ever read Captain Underpants no
no it's so much fun hey dogs cool that's
cool these are all books that he would
want to read no cuz he hates books
alright so I sent out a tweet and
everyone said just start reading
divergent I really liked the movie so
I'm gonna start the book divergent cuz I
want to dive into one and then also I'm
totally fascinated by this graphic novel
thing so I picked up the Hobbit cuz it
was a cool one that I saw over there and
it's basically like a graphic novel
they had a cool one for Outlander but
Missy did not like it
wanted to read it you were you it's a
it's like less words and more pictures
to awesome what word left I wish they
would do a graphic novel for Harry
Potter how freakin cool would that be
this is enough he could boo oh that's
cute
he's not at me is this gonna hate books
huh
have you ever plug this close to the
elevator
look at that parking spot babe I think
no one is at the mall all the kids are
in school and so it's like everything is
like clear you know anything smells out
there and it smells in here you guys
what 30 people here so I'm on a mission
I want to go to Verizon store I want to
hold a five and a half inch phone to see
how it goes in my hand because that's
the size that the iPhone 6 plus is and I
have no idea what these sizes are so
we're gonna check it out Missy Missy
thinks the 4.7 is perfect for her
but yeah put your hand up to mine you
have such little hands I have big hands
I think that the iPhone
is perfect but then it could be a little
bigger I mean you a little bigger go any
bigger than she's too big can you really
go too big though Missy what so I think
this is the four seven and this is the
five and a half and it feels really good
it's not as big as I thought I probably
do it you guys I'm gonna see that we
just went into t-mobile and we felt more
phones
I found a 5 and 1/2 inch demo that I
could hold and it felt really good you
guys I might actually get the plus two
big well you don't even care because
size doesn't matter to you the phone the
size of the phone I think that it's
perfect I feel like it's just a little
bit bigger than a current one and it's
perfect
I know no you keep saying things like
that I'm like yeah that's all I need but
now I'm like I just I don't know what to
do don't know what hey see you and Katie
both trying to tell us guys what to do :
really wants a 5.5 - it's all about the
plus baby I think you just need an
almost
you shouldn't let people's opinions
control your life
that's what : say huge phone but yeah by
days I don't even care anymore it's
Apple so it really doesn't matter
anymore
that's a silly thing to say but it's
kind of true I was just telling him
because Apple always just tells you what
you want and now keep there making us
decide I don't want to decide so it's
like you believe that's called socialism

him fall asleep he's so cute
