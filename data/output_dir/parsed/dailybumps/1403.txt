on the camera hey dougie Doug uh I was
pretty good I think I don't got all the
ingredients for the chicken gnocchi soup

to do is put these in in the order that
it wants me to do if you guys are
curious I'll actually have my gnocchi
recipe and the soup recipe both linked
below in the description so you guys can
check it out we doubled the soup recipe
and did just what the new yorky recipe
said so we'll see actually how that
turns out check out this giant yogi nom
look at that look at all this no key we
got you guys I have no idea if that's
enough or not
I know sure that's enough I mean you're
making it for six people that's a lot
it's probably too much no key
yeah and you have another one we started
the soup and we got the gnocchi they are
boiling in a chicken broth well it
stopped boiling but they're cooking at
least I'm really excited with this we
got chicken all shredded up um nom nom
here is the finished product it pretty
much looks exactly like chicken gnocchi
soup I don't know if it kind of tastes
like it it's a little tiny the time is
very overpowering but the nokey turned
out perfect this is what the nokey looks
like nobody turned out perfect and we
got bread sticks and alfredo sauce and
the alfredo sauce is pretty much perfect
too but I can't take credit for that
because we bought it already made so
missing you like it Ollie was trying to
have a conversation here cranky baby
thank you baby
but what do you think Missy you like it
yeah
only she loves it in that awesome
it's bedtime for these awesome toys we
got Oliver today at Target they are like
for it to increase like your hand-eye
coordination right yeah so he lifts them
up and then they so like fills with
water and it's got all these holes on
the bottom and so he can lift it up and
like empty the whole thing and I like
that because it feels like it really
gets empty you know yeah I guess doesn't
have water sitting in it like we just
replaced his rubber duckie with this one
that has no hole and it's but does it
fill with water yeah I hate that it
fills with water and then it gets all
moldy and gross though
working it cool bro huh cool okay we
have the 50/50 see I love him he just
like crawls around the tub now so much
easier they'll have this old tub hanging
in there and we just need to get rid of
it anymore much baby stuff that I need
to like figure out what to do it yeah

like me his storage unit cuz like yeah
