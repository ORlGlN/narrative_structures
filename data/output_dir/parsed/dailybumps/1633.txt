sounds like a steal sometimes sometimes
an adulterer or a dolphin yeah hey do it
again seriously as a dolphin sound like
you belong at SeaWorld boy baby boy
he's awesome baby
do amazing things
good morning guys I just made myself
more my favorite breakfast
french toast I'm super excited about it
but I just realized there's no syrup so
that really sucks not really going to be
a great morning for me anymore looking
everywhere for the syrup and I don't
think we have any bad day so I just got
done cooking all those French toast you
look sad look face ya know you're a
happy baby today aren't yet he's
actually been so cute today I swear he's
about to smile can you smile for the
camera he has been making some super
cute faces and I swear we're looking at
a smile hopefully next week huh Geils
we are headed out of the house to drop
the car off with brian how to take him
to work today we just had there she
should've switcheroos with the cars for
Oliver isn't so fussy today is all be
put down and now I got to put him in a
car seat and he's already not huh
and I got a drive which means he had us
it has to fit in the back by so
hopefully you can go to sleep okay yes
we're at Souplantation eating lunch and
Jolene came up to say hi say hey this is
her buddy
Damien oh wow wow oh just Oliver there's
not happy hey buddy you okay it's
turning red like a tomato I'm Izzy pick
you up for lunch so we're at soup
plantation eating some grub
Souplantation is really cool because you
can get soup and you can get salad and
you can get pizza which is really kind
of random Missy's learning how to eat
with her left hand now apparently and
you don't mind
oh there you go
why didn't I think that I didn't realize
this but I guess I'm like totally
addicted to clam chowder now and they
have really really good chowder at the
soup plantation which is probably weird
they're probably not the kind of people
you think could make really good powder
but I'm not gonna lie this is my third
bowl and it's really good well thanks
for taking me to lunch Oliver I
appreciate it
he smiled for me yes he did he smiled
for me he don't smile for you
mmm we are back home and and Oliver is
taking a little nap I just realized that
I am officially a mom only because um I
just went out of the house and didn't
realize it but I have absolutely no
makeup behind and I have spit up and a
little bit of milk all over me I think
that makes me an official mom and I'm
probably take a little nap because I'm
exhausted really really hot sighs it's
probably over a hundred degrees outside
but my mom likes to turn the air on and
a fan on and I get really cold really
easily but that's how I always have been
even like najin was the end of my
pregnancy but probably like even through
my pregnancy I was always I just I get
cold really easily
oh no you guys I'm out of gas that's
what that blinky light means and it's
basically saying that I can go 15 more
miles that's not gonna cut it
I'm here come meet with me and Oliver
you want to give him a kiss Oh careful
God be slow what we just need Oliver I
kiss on his cheek it was so cute
seriously sitting on his bottom now that
we have the Prius is actually pretty
rare that we run out of gas this thing
does amazing you're like 400 450 miles
to the tank it's pretty pretty awesome
also did you guys hear that rad backup
noise got a little backup beep all this
truck decides it's gonna
me off that's okay no go ahead yeah go
ahead you're good you're good
sometimes you just got a smile and say
go ahead oh now he's turning right
toward me oh he is going completely the
wrong way that is okay it was all right
buddy you know we have those days some
days so I had to run to the store to go
have a couple things and of course I
forget the baby where so I gotta put him
in his car seat I'm just a mess today I
still haven't done my makeup I still
haven't done anything I'm just I'm
exhausted

throwing up kind of mood right how many

flexibility back where I can like do my
bend over and balance and all that like
a normal person I can do this now yeah
you actually hug me and not feel like
bend over
okay you guys so it's eight o'clock at
night and we have a really big decision
to make right now do we make chicken or
do we make steak we just don't know cuz
we have both and we both don't know what
we want and Missy can't decide it's
pretty much up to us what do we make you
guys uh
what do we make leave in the comments
should we make steak or should we make
chicken what do we end up making for
dinner
can you just tell us now tell us right
now you guys weren't really hungry it's
8 o'clock at night all right so we've
decided we are making steak well we are
not I am making steak
Missy's over there watching TV what are
you watching
Shaytards and yeah so I'm making steak
and one little tidbit is I like to dust
the top and bottom of the steak and a
little bit of flour because it makes it
a little more crunchy because we like
our steaks super crunchy on the outside
and like nice and red in the middle
that's how we you guys don't weed or
stick like Carter's murder you know what
I mean so I'm editing the vlog right now
well I'm editing one of Missy's videos
what you guys should go watch it's in
the description below look I got a
little editing buddy
Haggar man what's up you hanging out oh
hi he's like I can help you vlog Jimmy
hope you edit the vlog where is having
his nightly contemplation oh he does he
does this every night yeah he like looks
I it's like he's like what well my night
be like shall I peel on yeah never the
same thing hmm
Kimmel said hi babe he like opened his
mouth like he's going to because I was
biggle eyes on him hey Oliver Oh someone
did ask like how's the eye color going
and I mean it's still blue there's still
blue eye we've got going new eyes he's
got big old baby blue eyes yep they
still do honey obviously they can change
but yeah I don't know what do you think
they are I think they're boobs
look at his face is like can you please
not do that randomly handling ah he's
yawning you know what that means guys
it's getting ready for bed and I know a
lot of people actually even saying in
the comments are like I hate when he
says it's bedtime cuz that means of
vlogs gonna end but it has to end
sometimes you guys it has to unless
does it he likes this when I tap his
bottom I think it's cuz when Missy uh
was pregnant she was big in her belly
and she used to like tap his butt
maybe that helps I don't know what do
you see how much she's supporting his
head it's awesome
he was a big boy he's getting really big
