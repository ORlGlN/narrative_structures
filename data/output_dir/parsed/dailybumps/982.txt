backyard I think I got it pretty nicely
done
I got Misty's grill cover that she got
me over my grill and there is a ton of
bird poo vacuum you guys it's driving me
crazy I don't know where they are
anytime we like want to hang out here I
had to basically scrub the concrete
clean birds are taking over my yard he
finally went ahead and got a little
storage thing out here for all the pool
things so that fits nicely right there
plus the Chairs match looks good
got the pool nice and clean look how
blue it is react today's gonna be a fun
day in the pool hey morning hey mine in
there you go morning guys we have had a
very productive day so far we've been
cleaning and Brian sand cleaning the
back car which is really nice but we've
got how to keep birds from pooping on
your back right no right they just like
to sit on that fence and just poop down
it's pinwheels oh that's a good idea
that we pretty Ori Niners people
anything really that just sits on there
and kind of moves or something makes
color you know okay there's one right
there
I know I just claimed he's pooping he's
freaking pooping on my is is pooping
like it's like drips down the fence and
then it gathers onto the ground it's
pretty gross to brinded so good it looks
so good out there and I'm literally in
my babies you ain't a strong and that's
what I chosen to wear today because I
just want to hang out by the pool want
to be in the Sun I feel like Florida
made me want now I just want to go back
to Florida because that's where I seem
to be in the Sun but I have a pool in my
backyard so I'm gonna take advantage of
it do you want to take advantage of it
today no good landing
that's something really cool that we
bought yesterday um for ollie was a
pirate castle look at this thing it I
know you want this

the water so we don't pop it he's like I
needed in this castle how do you get in
it oh he's been through it what do you

literally just blew up the little
inflatable toy and then it was nap time
and he was like what but he has lemon
down really easily he crawled right into
his bed got under his covers and cuddled
up and he is out so he'll probably out
for a little probably like an hour and a
half or so which is nice isn't I can go
outside and swim and relax without him
for a little bit and then when he comes
I can play with him and it'll just help
with a really relaxing day but I am
actually going to clean up his his
playroom right now because it's kind of
a disaster and I got to clean it every
once well so that he can tear it apart
