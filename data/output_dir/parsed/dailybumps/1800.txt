3d I'm gonna get
having a boyfriend
good morning guys
she's reinfect Oh got her early this
morning and she's not sleeping all
morning she's one thing I've learned
though is we do need a bigger pad I do
need at least a king hi I'm Jeff really
grumpy this morning so we turned on my
little pony
at first she was still screaming through
it but then I just turned up the volume
a little and it worked I mean a banana
for breakfast and she kept like grabbing
it and look at she totally likes banana
oh is it yummy I wonder if she's been
eating bananas before look at her hey
Bailey that's my banana just trying to
steal my banana now Bailey that's my
butt
here we gonna add this to the list of
places that cover likes to hide in the
closet night we kind of had a little
scare Missy she felt some some nausea
all of a sudden really fast and then her
belly started getting very tight and
sort of like contracting I guess when
you pair those two things together the
nausea and the contracting it's a sign
of like a contraction she thinks they
might be Braxton Hicks and she's texting
me she says she's already felt three of
them and each of them are ten minutes
apart so I don't really know that's a
good thing or not necessarily a bad
thing or if it's normal that she's
calling her doctor to see basically
what's going on and what we can do and
and all that I hope everything's okay so
I just got done editing Missy's bump
date that we filmed last night so it is
uploading but Missy is finally home and
so she just wanted to sort of give you
guys a little update about it and we'll
probably do a little video for her
channel just to let everyone know but I
wanted to let you guys hear it from her
firsthand what's going on
so last night I did um feel I think it
was like a Braxton Hicks I was laying in
bed and I got an extreme wave of nausea
and at the exact same moment that I
really thought I was going to puke I had
a Braxton Hicks sir really those are
like preterm labor contractions or what
kind of things are they there and
they're really common for most women
they can have them throughout their
entire pregnancy but because I have a
possibility of going into preterm labor
I am a little bit more nervous about it
so Braxton Hicks is literally just a
tightening of your uterus it's not a
it's not a contraction it's not painful
at all and it can lead I believe to
contractions but yeah so I just I felt a
contraction and at the same moment I got
no I got nauseous which I thought was
weird but I checked the heartbeat right
away and everything was fine so this
morning though I was at work and I had
basically three Braxton Hicks
contractions and they were ten minutes
apart so that definitely worried me I
didn't like that they had like a bit of
a pattern there so I immediately called
my doctor he basically just advised me
to just take it easy be really careful
well he want me to drink lukewarm water
I'm thinking maybe to like calm the baby
down maybe the big like don't drink cold
water here maybe the cold water makes
the baby hyper and that's what's
irritating my uterus I don't know he
just said take it easy and elevate my
Fifi in da job I'm not really nervous
I'm not scared like I am I am an overly
cautious person but I really do feel
like everything's okay I don't know if
it was just simply that my my bladder
was filling and it just felt tight or if
I have to go potty I have no idea so I
don't feel confident in the fact that it
was even a boxing hit so yeah I'm
probably just be super careful super
calm in this bad you are be laying here
well you wanna make it
I'll make some I watched everything like
you told me thank you okay so but you've
been feeling okay since you got home
yeah I'm feeling fine I haven't I had a
little something Braxton Hicks I don't
know just a person a but I don't know I
just don't know but I'm not I've been
fine so we'll go to the movie and see
how you feel and then yeah next two days
you just take it easy
yep it is such a poopy day out today
this is literally the first time I
walked outside and it's like all gray
and blegh and just been like a lazy day
here just been trying to relax because
Missy needs to take it easy so I'm
guessing it rain where are all the
snails I bet I can find a snail oh look
at there's a snail that ladies and
gentlemen is a snail and it crawled all
the way up there and it's been up there
for like weeks I don't know if it's
still in there if it's alive or what but
I feel really bad normally this place is
like overwritten with snails after it
rains they all come out here and then
when you run around in the dark
crunch um and it's so sad so we are out
now running around well I'm not running
around I am sitting in the car I
actually had my feet up but I put them
down for a minute and so I've been just
kind of
seeing and Brian checking the P lock so
that I don't have to like get out of the
car or anything but we're gonna grab
some dinner and then probably go to a
movie again I'm just going to sit down
at the movie theater and yeah so I think
that it's me fine but and I've been
feeling fine all day I honestly think
that I like I said I don't know if it
was a box indict I think that maybe my
belly was just getting tight because my
bladder was filling I don't know I still
want a water bottle like that Missy yeah
it's so cool actually okay but today
took a drink and I was sitting at my
desk and all over please like my god
your water break your water break no but
this thing's broken
oh my god wait did you just like slept
like your tongue slip as you went down
because it's a big opening it's just so
easy to like accidentally go up and yeah
so you just finished dinner
young ink and trying to forget his
chicken-fried steak so and I am now
relaxing so nice thank you wanted to get
friends been champing they were in the
drawer movie you guys look I just
crushed the snail I was literally just
telling them about the snails outside
our house how I always crush them when
it's raining bad for your snail okay
John just dropped us off at the theater
haha
and so now we're just waiting outside
because they don't want me walking too
far so we're getting ready to go see
odds and pawpaws oh and then called the
Great and Powerful oz
I didn't make the movie so we're gonna
see that and we were gonna go see the
play the way the pause which sounded fun
but this sounded better I guess
free big
why did your Essex
just got out of class
I love Monsters Inc 3d these are
actually really cool they're super
excited okay so we just got home the
movie was really really cool it was just
cool getting to see it like before it's
even out in theatres so that was sweet
Missy liked it too she because she likes
the Wizard of Oz so but yeah we really
want to do a dare for you guys but it's
just it's super late right now and we
spent most of the day just like worrying
about Missy and her belly situation and
so but she did kind of realize something
in the theater what were you saying in
the theater I I don't know though the
Backson expert when you have said this
many times but I'm kind of wondering if
maybe it was more like the baby like
could just be baby growing in my belly
stretching or maybe the baby was just
stretching I don't know I like the baby
moving possibly maybe I'm always
mistaking it as a tightening but it was
just a move I don't know that I haven't
quite figured it out yet but I'm not
really worried about it I I feel pretty
confident at everything finally
obviously I checked the heartbeat and
you know everything seems to be good so
we'll keep watching you closely because
I don't want anything to happen so just
take it easy tomorrow you know but
tomorrow I guess we'll have to make up
for not having a dare I'm really sorry
you guys
we suck I think we've been doing pretty
good though like this is like two weeks
of dares that's crazy somewhat actually
even commented and they were like can
you do dares all the time like it would
be fun too but it's it's a lot of work
but we probably will bring bring the
dares back for maybe like a week um you
know throughout the year and stuff like
that but we still have like five more
days of dares left until voting ends so
we will do a double dare tomorrow how
about that okay so we'll do a double
dare tomorrow it'll probably all be on
me everyone can so they're us to do
stuff double dog dare tomorrow be on it
you guys get a scar
so yeah double dog dare that's like the
worst dare you can't even say no to it
double dog dare dang
alright we'll give us some double dares
in the comments for tomorrow you guys we
are exhausted and we're kind of bummed
because all our bed stuff isn't clean so
now we have to wait for that to be clean
anyway thank you guys for watching and
we will see you tomorrow bye e I've been
out all over me Missy I have that
