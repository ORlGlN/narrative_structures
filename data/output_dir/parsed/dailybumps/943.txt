with a doula and I loved her and so I
actually went ahead and basically
committed to her so I have a doula now

doula is we are actually going to do a
video together which I'm excited about

rehearsing for the vloggerfair set so if
you guys don't know I'm actually
performing two songs and an exclusive
track that no one's ever heard
exclusively at vlogger fair on Saturday
this weekend it's coming up so fast
today was actually really cool because I
walked into Jersey Mike's with just my
coin this is like a new thing that I've
been waiting for two years now i
pre-ordered this on Kickstarter and what
it is is it's a card that stores all of
my all of my cards I just use this
little button on the front to cycle
through which one I want to use and then
I can use it and it's got this e ink
display it's covered up by my thumb
because it has the last four and
expiration on my car but it has a ink
display which cycles through the cards
for me to show me what card I'm using
and I used it and it worked and I was
like this is amazing all my cards in one
little card pretty stinking cool so yeah
now I'm headed over to Jeffrey's and
we're going

much while he was sleeping
I was planning on it but I was also
planning on like taking a nap and like
just like relaxing and like I don't know

I'm pregnant and I think I should take a
nap everyone smile but that just didn't
happen I got kind of busy I was on the

and I'm super excited we're gonna use a
3d ultrasound I haven't seen him in 3d
