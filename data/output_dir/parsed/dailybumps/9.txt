-  Good morning!
♪ This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it, live it forever ♪
- How are you guys this morning?
-  Good.
-  Good?
It is such a nice day
today, and we are so excited
because Ollie got his little STEM toy
in the mail today, and so we are gonna
be opening this a little bit later.
Does that sound fun?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I'm so excited
to see what they build.
I think it's gonna be really cool,
and I love just really fun,
educational games, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- So we're gonna do
that a little bit later.
But first, I actually
have a few errands to run,
one of them being, did you
guys hear that Nacho's hurt?
- Yeah.
- Oh, did you know Nacho got hurt?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Nacho has a couple
owies, so I'm headed up
to go check on him and see how he's doing.
So I'm actually off to the barn right now,
but if you guys don't know
what happened with Nacho,
I give a lot more information
in a previous vlog,
so go check it out right here,
then you kinda can get
some more information.
Poor guy, let's go check on him.
So I am back at the barn today.
And I am just checking on Mr.
Nacho, how you doin', bud?
And I really wanna take
a look at his foot,
it is all bandaged up.
So I'm really looking forward
to checking on his foot,
seeing if the abscess
has come through yet,
it actually has been a couple days.
I'm hoping that everything
will be looking good now,
or at least starting to look
different, I guess I can say.
I thought the other day it
had kind of come through,
it looked like it was
a little pusy, but he,
I've lunged him and he was
definitely a little still off,
but I'm gonna show you his nose,
he's got a little owie on his nose.
There's his owie.
He must've scratched it on a fence post
or some kind of exposed wire of some sort,
so I gotta take a look at that
and hopefully it's not a big deal either.
Having a horse is hard, guys! (chuckles)
Um no, it's honestly awesome to like,
kind of come in and just know,
oh something's wrong, or
how can I fix him up today,
or make sure it doesn't get worse?
When do you need to call a vet,
when can you take care of it yourself?
But other than that,
he's doing really good.
You're a happy horse, huh?
So I've got this little
doctor kit that my dad,
my dad made this, and I love it.
It literally fits all my
stuff, and I've got my wraps,
I've got like some of my
medicines, gauze, gloves,
and a couple extras, scissors,
we're gonna get that cleaned
up and get that fixed up, 'kay?
So I'm actually just gonna
use some Nu-Stock topical,
which is something that
we use a lot in this farm,
it seems to really
promote like hair growth
and it kind of like helps with lacerations
and bleeding, and all that, so we're gonna
go ahead and put this on.
All right, looks pretty good.
So next, we got to unbandage this,
and take it apart and see how it's doing.
All right, so I finally got
the bandage off of his foot
which was on there pretty dang good,
which I think is a good thing, I mean,
it means I did a really
good job of wrapping it up.
Took it off, and it
basically looks the same.
The stuff that I put on it tends to look
very gooey and ooky, and
it can even kind of look
like blood, but it's not
blood, it's just really dark.
But there's really been
no change since yesterday.
So kind of a bummer, we
definitely want to see change,
we definitely want to start seeing
like something come through.
(sighs) And it's still not happening,
so I'm just gonna clean it up,
and then wrap it back up.
We're gonna get you all better, 'kay?
Nothing in his foot is even tender still.
(sighs) 'Cause when it's
tender, you know it's
like starting to, like, come through.
He really can't be ridden until
the abscess comes through.
I'm gonna go ahead and
bandage it up again,
and then put him back in his stall.
All right, so what I do
now is I'm basically going
to put on a poultice, and
this is supposed to help
kind of draw it out, and
then what I've been doing
is a salve that is I guess
supposed to draw it out,
this is what the lady told me,
but she also said she hadn't tried this,
and that it might work really good,
it's got like antiseptic
in it, antifungal,
'cause he does have a little thrush on it,
and a few other things, so I
kinda think I want to try this
and then maybe like these two together.
I guess we'll see.
(slow relaxed music)
And now I'm going to duct tape
it so that it is waterproof
and it doesn't fall off.
All right, so it's got,
it's all the medicine on it,
it's wrapped up in the
wrap, and then it's got
the duct tape on it to help it stay.
I will say, the lady that
usually is helping me,
she actually wraps it in
a diaper and the diaper
will also help it be waterproof.
I think I might actually
start doing that again,
just to kind of hopefully help
it stay a little bit clean.
But hopefully that'll
stay on just for today.
He's actually gonna go out to pasture
and so I'm hoping it won't fall,
I don't think it'll fall
off, but I might come back
later to kind of fix it up.
Sound good?
And all of it goes back in
and I just love this thing!
It's like my little doctor kit.
Let's get back in here.
There, he's like I know you got a treat,
mom, hand it over.
I got these little muffins for him.
I'm sorry you're not feeling good.
So hopefully his nose
is looking good soon,
and hopefully that is looking good soon.
I wish I had time to give
him a full, like, grooming,
I usually come down here
and do that, and brush him,
and clean him, and just
kind of make him feel
pampered a little, but I am
actually running super late now.
Actually, I'm supposed to pick up Kelsey
and be at a hair
appointment in 35 minutes.
I don't think that's enough time.
But I'll probably come back
down a little bit later
after he goes out to pasture.
He's looking good, his personality
is different right now,
like, he's just a little
more agitated, nervous.
If I'm not seeing change
within the next day or so,
I'll probably end up
calling either his farrier
or his vet to kind of look him over
and make sure it's nothing
that could be any more serious.
But I've got a few different eyes on him,
it's not just me. (chuckles)
He has no temperature,
his hoof is just warm,
so that's why we're pretty
sure it's an abscess,
and he's limping on
that foot, so it's like,
it's pretty self-explanatory,
but if it doesn't
look better pretty soon,
I'll probably, you know,
start to get a better look at him
and make sure it's nothing else, too.
(upbeat music)
All right, I am home!
And I'm hanging out with the boys now,
and they are so excited about
something special we got.
This is a subscription box for kids,
I think it's like
Ollie's age for like STEM
educational toys, and so
this came, and now of course
Finn is so excited, which is awesome,
'cause it's educational, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  It's all these little gears
that you can build
together and they all can,
like, run by itself, isn't that neat?
-  Yeah.
-  All right,
let's go ahead and see
if we can make it work, 'kay?
- Okay.
-  All right,
so I think you actually
just twist this open.
Or you can turn this
little gear to open it.
There you go, see if you can lift it up.
See if you can (gasps) you did it!
(Finn vocalizes)
-  Wow!
-  (chuckles) Is that cool?!
Look at all these, so many gears.
Oh, and we got the instructions.
(energetic beat music)
'Kay, Finn, your turn, go ahead.
Whoa, look what you're doing there.
(energetic beat music)
Woo-hoo! Good job, guys!
You did so good.
We actually did it, it's so cool!
How cool is that, all
those gears go together
and then they make
something really fun, huh?
- Yeah.
-  That's so neat.
Yeah, oh goodness gracious.
- So I just heard the
boys having so much fun
in the living room.
What?! Did you really build that?!
-  Yeah.
(Missy chuckles)
-  Ollie, wait, did
you seriously build this?
- Yeah.
-  That's incredible! What is this?
- It's a city with gears.
-  Yeah!
-  A city of gears?
That is so cool!
Can you show Dada how it works?
That's crazy! (Missy chuckles)
So the whole thing spins together?
- Yeah.
-  That's awesome dude.
That is seriously amazing,
I love all these new
little STEM toys we get for Ollie.
We need to start getting
them for Finn's age I think.
-  Yeah.
- But Finn also really enjoys these ones.
- He's honestly, I love the fact
that he loves the older kids STEM toys,
but I'm sure his age is really fun, too.
-  By the way, you wanna see
what's happening below the camera--
-  Yeah, you don't even. (laughs)
-  (laughs) It's
all Luna, all the time.
She's like, oh hey, you're
sitting on the floor,
you can pet me, you can pet me.
(Ollie and Bryan laugh)
Good job, boys, on the gear city.
Did you do that too, Finn?
Or is Finn like the monster destroying it?
- You know, he actually did a lot,
but now he's kind of like bah!
- Yeah!
(suspenseful music)
-  Wow! Finn's being a monster!
- No!
-  (chuckles) Well,
Missy, I think we spoke too soon.
(laughs)
We literally spoke too soon.
- Now we're gonna have to
rebuild it, right, Ollie?
- Yeah!
- That is crazy.
Um, he did miss his nap, so. (chuckles)
-  Yeah, this is what happens when,
when little kids miss their nap.
Finn, say I'm sorry, Ollie.
- Sorry, Ollie.
- It's okay, Finn.
(upbeat music)
- I am actually headed out now
to go check on my chickens.
So if you guys don't know, I ended up
having another rooster.
I talked about it one of my vlogs,
I'm gonna go ahead and link it up here,
if you can watch it,
you'll get a little bit
more information, but I actually had
six chicks hatch back in May.
Four ended up being
roosters, so I gave them
back to the person who
gave me the fertile eggs
and she, like, takes care
of them it's really cool.
I had two hens and then
one turned into a rooster.
And I was like, is this for real?
Yeah, he was legit a
rooster, and then he ended up
attacking his mom, honestly.
I ended up giving him back also,
'cause I just can't have roosters, like,
beating up my hens, not to mention,
they're gonna end up
beating up me or my kids,
so we ended up giving him back,
and so now they're all together,
and they're all hens, all the ladies.
And you're making me eggs, oh, we might've
already grabbed the eggs today.
Did the kids already come down
here and get eggs from ya?
And there's Pam right there,
and she's looking so good.
Her head definitely healed
up nicely, and it is still
healing, but it's looking
good, no bleeding.
And yeah, she got back
into the group pretty well,
so I'm glad about that.
At first, all the girls
actually started beating her up,
and I think they wanted
to put her to the bottom
of the pecking order, but
she was having none of that,
and she put herself back up
on top of the pecking order.
But that's just how Pam
is, 'cause she's a mom,
and she knows how to get things done.
All right, boys, it's almost bedtime!
You guys ready for bed? (chuckles)
I am ready for bed, I am so tired!
(Finn singing)
Are you singing me happy birthday?
- Yeah.
-  Did you make me a cake?
- Yeah.
-  Wow!
♪ Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday dear Jesus ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
(Missy chuckles)
- You're so cute.
Anyways, we have had a long, fun day.
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.
I'm excited to check on Nacho and see
how he's doing tomorrow,
and hoping that things
start to progress and look better,
and he starts to feel better soon.
But anyways, we're gonna go
ahead and end this video,
'cause it's bedtime, so give this video
a big thumb's up, huh?
Thumb's up! And we'll
see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
- Bye!
-  Boop.
(upbeat music)
