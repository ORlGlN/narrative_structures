- Hey guys, look!
Luna's been a stuck in here!
-  Luna!
Finn!
Oh, Finn's got the
biggest smile on his face.
He's totally the culprit.

Good morning!
Good morning, Finn.
How you doing this morning?
(excited baby cooing)
So something amazing happened
when Finn woke up this morning,
he was actually in a good mood.
I feel like that rarely
ever happens anymore.
He is definitely entrenched in
the terrible twos phase of life.
I feel like he has been crying and whining
for like the past two weeks
straight, every single day.
But not this morning!
This morning he woke up with
a big old smile on your face.
Let me see that smile!
There it is!
(laughing)
The boys had so much fun at the circus,
if you guys haven't seen the vlog,
I'll have it linked
above, but they passed out
and they slept so good.
- I loved it.
-  Oh, really?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, what
was your favorite part?
- That one.
-  That one?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
(laughs) he's so cute.
It's lunchtime!
So we're eating some lunch, right?
- Yeah!
Daddy made you a peanut butter and jelly!
Can you try it?
- No.
-  Please?
- No.
-  Please?
- Yeah!
-  Alright, take a bite.
(chuckles) Quit monkeying
around, my monkey.
My little Finn monkey.
Is it yummy?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Good morning fishies!
Fishies are doing so good.
Our blue tang.
I don't know if we
officially named her yet.
I think we're calling her Dory.
- Good morning, guys!
I am actually now with Finn,
who I guess Bryan was just
vlogging about how happy he is.
Are you happy?
- No.
- Oh. (laughs)
Honestly I don't know
if you guys have noticed
over the past few vlogs,
he has just been like
not feeling his best and
for a while it was like,
is it that he doesn't feel good?
Or is he like literally just
kicked into like terrible twos?
And is like blah!
Like that.
He's being so good!
So, obviously he's feeling
better and he's not
just like terrible two-ing me, huh?
But he actually was just
saying our groundskeeper's name
and he like loves that he can say it.
(excited cooing)
Hey, what's his name up there?
Who's that?
- Bobby.
- Yeah!
Good job!
Did you hear him say that?
Bobby.
He changed my name just like
maybe three days ago to mommy.
Ollie's never called me mommy,
which I love mommy or momma.
I don't like mom.
I don't think that,
I'm like you're too young to call me mom.
What's my name?
- Mommy.
-  Mommy.
Say momma!
- Mommy.
(Missy laughs)
- Is that so cute?
Ollie calls me momma and
he's like calling me mommy,
like all the time.
He even like at night, if he
needs me, he's like mommy.
Anyways I've actually
been at the barn all day,
just working and just
like writing and stuff.
So, I am like so tired.
My brain is tired more than anything.
It's just like, I don't know what it is.
It's just like a lot of
movement and a lot of thinking.
But I am definitely ready
to go get my baby boy.
- We gotta go get Ollie okay?
- Yeah.
- Let's go get him, we can come home
and relax and have a good day as a fam.
Alright we are headed in and
I decided to take my hat off
'cause like I just don't want to look
like such a cowboy right now.
It's windy today huh?
- Yeah.
- You excited to see your brother?
- Yeah.
- Say Ollie.
- Ollie.
- Say, Ollie, where are you?
(excited cooing)
(laughs) What?
Let's go!
Finn has such a hard
time walking through here
'cause he just wants to play, huh?
You can play!
Let's get Ollie and you can
play for a minute, okay?
- Okay.
- Come on!
- I just wanna play.
- I just wanna play.
Okay, you go play!
I never let him play, I
think he's gonna be so cute
when he does get into preschool
'cause I think he's gonna love it.
Ollie!
Finn's here, he wants to play with you!
Ollie's gonna show him
the basketball hoop.
Are you guys so excited to play?
- I'm gonna put it in
this really high one.
-  Okay, ready?
- Let's see if I can do it.
- Okay.
Oh, you did it!
Good job!
Woo!
You did it!
Yay!
(upbeat music)
(laughs) Aw.
He want's to get on one too.
Go Ollie!
Go, go Ollie, go!
You're so good at that.
Alright we've got Ollie
and look what he's wearing!
Did you make that, Ollie?
- M-hm.
-  Do you have a
sticker on your mouth?
- M-hm.
- Oh yeah he says, look
momma I'm a praying mantis!
(Finn laughs)
Aw, Finn thinks that's so funny.
But yeah, so the boys just
played a ton in the playground.
It was so cute and I actually learned
that Finn can actually come next year.
So, I may start him 'cause
he just loves being there
and then they can be at
the same school together
and it might be really fun.
So we'll see though, we'll
talk and see how it goes.
You guys ready to go see daddy?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
- Hey guys, look!
Luna's been a stuck in here!
-  They're stuck in the pantry?
- Yeah!
-  Well how did
they get stuck in there?
- (giggles) Luna!
-  Luna!
Finn!
Oh, Finn's got the
biggest smile on his face,
he's totally the culprit.
Are you finding all the candy?
- No.
-  No, how did you get in there.
- No.
-  No, you're not gonna tell me?
-  No.
- Okay I think it's time we
let them out of the pantry.
Have freedom, my children!
Finn, you!
What are you doing?
Okay.
We have this handy dandy child proof lock
on our pantry and it
makes it so that the kids
can basically barricade
themselves in the pantry.
Of course the kids have found a way
to use child locks against us.
-  They found the bread!
-  Finn, get out of the pantry!
Alright Finn, Mommy and I
have a little test for you.
Are you ready?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
I'm just gonna give you the phone.
I'm just gonna see what happens.
(Finn laughs)
- Do it, get it.
- Go ahead.
-  No Finn, here!
-  Well we didn't
expect these results.
- No.
-  Round two.
Round three.
(phone crashing)
(Ollie excitedly exclaiming)
And it's shattered.
-  Oh my gosh.
-  I'm sorry babe.
- I'm leaving.
-  Oh, well, to be fair,
that was just the result of that test.
- Okay well, at least show us what you do.
-  Show us what you do, Finn!
-  How do you get to it?
Oh, there you go.
- He found it!
(upbeat music)
-  Oh my gosh!
That's how you do it?
-  So he swipes over to the search
and he sees the logo there.
- Yeah, I had no idea
how he was doing that.
I thought he was like
finding, I was like what?
- Finn may be a genius, but also like
he broke Missy's phone today.
- He broke it and I'm going
on a trip and it's broken now.
- Aw.
It's okay.
I'm sure you can get it fixed.
(Missy sighs)
I think we're used to this,
our kids breaking our things.
- Yeah.
- Remember when Ollie
threw my Apple watch?
- Yeah, but Ollie was being really naughty
and I don't feel like Finn
did it in a malicious way.
He was trying to be
funny and so it's like--
- Yeah.
- He doesn't deserve to be in trouble.
-  Yeah.
(laughs) Now look, he's
like watching Ryan.
Shout out to Ryan
ToysReviews, my kids love you.
(laughs)
-  Alright, boys,
lets go play outside.
-  Time to play outside, okay boys?
- Come on.
- This day is so beautiful, you guys.
Look at these blue skies,
green grass, big smiles.
Show me your big smile (laughs).
Finn's going on an
adventure already over here.
Look at our little monkey, you guys.
What are you doing, silly?
(uplifting music)
And it's time!
Missy's gonna go get some eggs.
- I think I've got a
quite a few down there,
so I'm definitely gonna need this.
I'm actually scared of how
many are down there right now.
It's been a few days.
(Bryan laughs)
(joyful upbeat music)
-  We've got eggs!
-  How many eggs is that, Ollie?
(Finn exclaims)
- One.
Two.
Three.
- Three!
- There's three.
- Alright we gotta check the rest.
-  Ooh, there's a chicken.
-  It's Moana!
Hi Moana, are you broody?
-  Uh-oh, really?
- She's totally sitting here
like a little protective
of her eggs.
- Is she warm?
- This is actually around the
time Pam got broody, remember?
They were born in, like, May.
-  Yeah, that's right.
- There was like 21 days,
so it's about the time.
Let's just see if she's
got any eggs under here.
Yup.
- Oh wow, she does.
Oh she's sittin' on a
lot of eggs right now.
-  Oh my God, well these
aren't fertile, dude, girl,
whatever you are.
-  These aren't gonna do anything.
-  Aw, I feel bad taking them.
-  (laughs) That's crazy.
So, we have another broody chicken?
- They're like really
hot, I'm actually worried.
It's possible.
- Oh, wow.
- It's definitely possible,
she's like the only one
I thought might actually get broody.
-  Yeah?
-  Look at her!
She's like you're taking my eggs.
-  Aw.
- You're cute.
-  If you take them
will she stop being broody?
- I don't think so.
I have to keep an eye on her
because if she's like
this, she'll go crazy.
She just, she'll do it
forever, because she's waiting
for her baby to be hatched.
So I might have to look up
ways to make her not broody,
but maybe she's not,
maybe she's just resting.
- Yeah.
If you guys haven't seen on this channel,
we actually had another hen go broody
and we hatched eggs.
We had little baby chicks and
it was the cutest thing ever.
- Moana was the first one born!
- Yeah, Moana was the
first born from that.
I'll have that playlist up in the iCard
if you guys wanna watch.
That was super fun for the boys to see.
And now were actually getting
a little sprinkle of rain!
- Yeah, it's actually a little.
-  Which I think
your plant needs it, babe.
-  Ha, I got that so long ago.
-  Can you catch the raindrops
with your tongue, Ollie?
Try to catch with your
orange tongue! (laughs)
And we even have eggs over
here in the corner, you guys.
- Moana, do you want some?
She's totally broody, look at her,
she's not even getting down.
- Yeah.
- Aw, I have to check the camera
to see how long she's been sitting there.
Hopefully it hasn't been that long.
- Hey Ollie, so Moana, she's broody,
which means that she wants
to sit on chicken eggs
and hatch them into little babies.
- Really?
-  Remember when we did that?
- M-hm.
- Should we do that again?
- Yeah!
-  That'd be cute?
- I should see if Maria wants some babies.
-  Oh yeah.
- Look at how many chickens,
I'm down so many chickens.
- Yeah.
- I'm down to like five.
-  We really do need some.
- Yeah and I think one of
them also is eating the eggs
'cause I was actually supposed
to have more than this.
-  Oh, really?
-  Yeah and I keep seeing egg yolks
so I think they're eating it.
- Aw.
- One of them.
-  Finn are you feeding 'em?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Aw.
He's throwing out food.
And, Luna, you're being so good!
You're not chasin' 'em or
trying to get in. (laughs)
Let us know down below in the comments
if you think we should hatch more chickens
and how many we should do this time.
I'll also have a little
poll in the card above
so you can cast your vote
if you think we should
or not also.
(upbeat techno music)
Alright, give me the goods.
(laughs) she's runnin'
around with the boys
so I'm protecting the precious cargo.
(upbeat techno music)
- It's time for bed.
Aw.
Are we reading stories?
- Yeah.
- Where'd he go?
Finley Jay!
Come back here.
We are sitting in our little cabin,
we're getting ready to read some stories.
We've got Oliver, Who
Was Small and Mighty.
We've got Yeti Turn Out The Light,
and God Bless You and Goodnight.
These are like all some
of our classics huh?
- Yeah.
- Some of our favorites.
I think Ollie knows all
the words to this one
and this one, huh?
- Yeah.
(Missy laughs)
- It is definitely time for bed.
It is getting late.
But I gotta get some
last minute cuddles in
'cause momma's goin'
on a little trip, huh?
You're gonna have so much
fun with daddy though, huh?
- M-hm.
- Yeah.
Alright, I got my little Finny back, huh?
Are you gonna miss momma while I'm gone?
- No.
- No?
Are you gonna have fun with daddy?
- Yeah.
(Missy scoffs and laughs)
- Alright well anyways,
we're gonna end the vlog
and you guys are gonna have so
much fun while I'm gone okay?
- Okay.
-  I love you guys.
- Okay.
- So give this video a big thumbs up
if you enjoyed our fun day!
Oh!
It's a toe thumb up.
Toe thumb up!
(Missy and Finn joyfully exclaim)
We will see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
- Bye.
- Bye.
-  Bye!
(laughing)
(upbeat techno music)
