I've never seen it like that before see
all the colors lights on lights on
lights on lights you guys we have to
choose some pendant lights or the
outdoor kitchen which these are not kind
of like can we just do a bunch of these
I know
so here's all the pendant lights which
one you want I like okay square one that

this is going to be fun
uh-huh yeah yeah okay cool so I'll let
you decide we are home now and we're now
doing a little home improvement project
we've been stressed out on this wall for
like an hour
the system is you got a fuse our Sun and
then you gotta find the screw and if
there was behind it and in Cannes anchor
yeah
so basically we're hanging these really
cute succulents up on the wall and I'm
really excited about it we tried to be
as like mathematically perfect but I
feel like math math is like math and
it's perfect but when you're dealing
with like hanging things it just seems
to always fail you I feel like but yeah
we've been a little bit like stressed
out we worked really well as a team
but yeah I just didn't always did it go
with planned but now I'm going to go get
Stan useful gum is nap maker actually I
had the leg a little bit toasty all Ian
and I'm sorry and sorry
come here you want the dragon no we
never know what you want right you wake
up in such a sad boiling waist up hey
Mari all used to wake up happy until is
I didn't we did we did really good babe
so we did all the measurements turns out
like a whole side of the screws were in
the wrong spot so kind of hard to wing
it on the other side it works out way
better when you just make it yeah I know
it does math never works for me so those
are like our only real plants in the
house you guys so we have to like spray
them or else they will die it took a
year and a half but we have killed
succulents before the cool thing is
though if we do kill us we can just take
them out and we can plant like herbs and
spices and stuff right in our kitchen
