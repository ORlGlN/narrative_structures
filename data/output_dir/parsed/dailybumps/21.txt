-  Good morning.
Ollie, what are you wearing today?
- Dr. Seuss.
- Dr. Seuss,
a Cat in the Hat outfit?
- Yeah.
-  And he's got his
favorite Dr. Seuss book,
and this is the Have You Seen My Dinosaur,
this is actually my favorite one as well,
we love reading
that one.
- But the dinosaur one
is my favorite.
- That is your favorite.
Today is Dr. Seuss' birthday I think,
it's either today or tomorrow,
or one of those days,
and so it is Dr. Seuss day,
which means he gets to dress
up in his Dr. Seuss outfit,
bring his favorite book, and
then you're off to school, huh?
(light, peaceful music)
Now that Ollie is dropped off at school
I'm headed in to get my hair fixed up,
I've got all my hair
extensions and some Starbucks.
I am so behind today, I
was so late to school,
so late to everything,
and I was up super early
'cause Finn woke up at 5:30.
But I've just been a little off,
not feeling my best today.
Hopefully I can get a
little pick up right now.
Alright, hair is done.
It must be so weird when I'm like,
alright, I'm going in to get my hair done,
and then the next clip is my hair is done.
Oh, I feel so much better.
I am still feeling a little off today,
I'm just so tired, and I
just don't feel very good.
You guys, I just got home,
and I've just been doing a
little cleaning and organizing.
P.S. here's the update on
my closet, oh, it's so bad.
A lot of this is actually Bryan's as well,
but this is all donation.
But I have to tell you guys
some crazy, crazy news.
Finn, tell us your crazy
news, what did you do?
- Pee pee.
(Missy gasping)
-  What did you do?
- Pee pee.
- Pee pee on what?
(Finn babbling)
On the potty?
- Yeah.
(Missy gasping)
-  Good job, did
you do the potty dance?
He's like, come see.
Yes, he actually said
he had to go poo poo,
and so I put him on the potty,
and he went pee pee,
yay, I'm so proud of you.
And he got a little candy and
we did the pee pee dance, huh?
(Finn babbling)
Yep, and we had to go tell Daddy.
It's so exciting, this is
actually the second time
he's done it, and I'm
just so proud of him.
I know we're not in
full-blown potty mode yet,
but we are very, very close.
It's exciting to do stuff like this
just to get him excited to
potty train, and make it fun
and not scary or anything.
Yay, I'm so proud of you,
you know who's gonna be so excited?
Ollie, Ollie is gonna be so excited, huh?
Honestly, Ollie is more excited
about him being potty trained than I am,
he gets so excited when
Finn wants to go potty,
or he actually does.
Ollie is more excited than
even Finn or any of us,
he's like oh my gosh, it's so cute.
He's a good little
cheerleader for his brother.
Anyways, I gotta get back to this mess.
I am back at the school to pick up Ollie.
It was so cold this morning,
I had a big old sweater
and a jacket, and it ended
up being a beautiful day,
I wish I could go riding, it's 78.
So I put a short-sleeved shirt,
just this light throw over it,
and it's so beautiful,
I just wanna be outside.
The fresh air feels so nice,
it's been a little too
chilly for California
these past couple days.
But it's finally time
to see my oldest boy,
I'm so excited, I missed him today.
I think I'm actually gonna take him out
for some lunch, I think
he already had lunch,
but maybe he'll get a
little dessert or something,
and we're gonna hang out for a little bit
before we head home.
(light, peaceful music)
This kid did not wanna wake up,
and he kinda still doesn't.
Are you just sleepin' so good?
- Yeah.
- Aww, I missed you.
- I missed you.
- So me and Ollie have gone
on a couple little dates,
we went to lunch, where'd we go?
- To Free Birds.
- Free Birds,
and we had lunch, and then actually
really getting my nail
fixed because I broke it,
and so he sat there while
I got my nails done,
huh?
- And I watched
something too.
- Yeah,
and he watched something on my phone.
He was so good, and I was so thankful.
So now we're gonna head home,
meet up with Daddy and Finn,
and I think we need to play outside,
we don't have much time left,
but we need to play outside today, huh?
It's such a nice day, so
let's see what we can do.
We're home, hey Finn,
do you wanna tell Ollie
the big news?
- Yeah.
-  What did you do today?
- Potty.
-  Finn went pee pee in the potty.
(Ollie gasping)
- That was so good.
- Isn't that so good?
- In the little one
or the big one?
- The little one.
Isn't that so cool?
- Yeah!
-  Yay!
(Missy laughing)
Tell him you're so proud of him.
- I'm so proud of you Finn.
- We have made it to the park,
and Mimi and Papa are here.
The boys are so excited,
we just have a little
bit of sunlight left.
Bryan stayed home,
he had a little bit more work to get done,
so hopefully we'll see
him once we get home,
but for now we're just
gonna play, are you so happy
to be at the park?
- Yeah,
and I'm talking to Papa.
-  And it's so nice outside, huh?
- Hello, hi.
- Papa?
-  Shhh.
(playful, upbeat guitar music)
- Does anybody want some ice cream?
- I'll take some ice cream.
Mmm,
mmm, oh, it was so cold,
I'm so cold!
- I'll get you
some warm candy.
- Warm candy,
can this be hot cocoa?
- Yeah.
- Okay, mmm.
Mmm, now I'm so warm.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get an ice cream.
-  Oh, another ice cream?
I'm so cold!
Oh, hot cocoa, oh, ooo, what is this?
- It's a special candy ball.
-  Ooo yum, thank you boys.
Woo, Mom you're a daredevil!
- It's so scary.
- Is that what I need to
get you, is a scooter now?
We'll go for a walk,
(speaking drowned out by laughing)
-  Oh geeze.
This is just a random
scooter we found here,
it's been here forever.
Finn, I think you're just too small, bud.
-  Get on there and
Papa will scoot you around.
-  Is that fun?
- Yeah.
-  Alright Ollie, your turn.
You're actually a good size,
can you do it by yourself?
So you gotta push, oh my gosh, oh my gosh,
you just did that really good.
Oh my gosh.
You scared me, are you good at that?
Have you done that before?
- No.
-  Oh, can you
do both feet on there
after you get it going?
Get ready, push,
and then, oh my gosh, you
did it, that's pretty good.
You're gonna need one
of those for Christmas.
Alright bud, let's go.
- Hey boys, I've got a challenge for you.
-  A challenge?
- Their faces lit up
when I said challenge.
I think that we should all try
to fit in this little
camping A-frame tent,
you think we could all fit
in there?
- Yeah.
- You think all of us, even Luna?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
-  We should try, k?
Alright, I'm gonna set the camera down,
I'm gonna grab this piece of wood,
I'm gonna set the camera down right here.
Okay, I'm gonna go in first,
ready?
- He's going in first.
You're next Ollie.
- It's so big
and spacious in here.
- Alright, my turn.
- Come on in Finn.
- Come on Finn.
- Come on in Luna.
- Come on Luna.
- Come on Luna.
- We need Karma.
-  Come on in Luna, all the way.
All the way.
- We all fit!
(Ollie laughing)
-  Now we're all stuck in here.
Hey Finn, Finn, go get the camera.
-  You're not my baby,
my baby.
- Good job, Finn.
That is right, we all, including Luna,
fit in this little tiny A-frame tent
in the boys' room.
- I think we could fit
Karma in here too.
- Oh, we could totally
fit Karma in here.
But anyway, I think that's
all for today's video,
did you have a good day buddy?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You had a good day too?
- Yeah.
- Yeah,
Finn hung out with Daddy most of the day,
we just had a lot of fun, huh?
- But you did do a big thing today.
- Yeah, we're so proud of you.
- Woo!
He's like, I'm tired.
- Anyway, thanks for watching guys,
hope you enjoyed today's video,
if you did be sure to
give it a big thumbs up.
Thumbs up, subscribe, we'll see ya manana,
Ollie, what do you say?
-  Bye, boop.
(bouncy, upbeat music)
