good morning guys I'm getting ollie
ready for the day today we're gonna have
a fun day okay we're gonna go see
pumpkins can you say pumpkin yeah that
was pretty good actually
last night Missy had a lot of
contractions but they're pretty
irregular their on and off some are
strong some aren't so I thought it'd be
a good idea to distract her today and
just go do something fun with Ollie so
I'm getting only dressed now pull the
tag off the shirt he hasn't worn this
shirt I got it from
Baby Gap it was on sale which on sale at
Baby Gap
ten bucks I'm used to buying your shirts
for like five bucks
but I loved I just loved it I thought it
was cool what happened
how's that good okay all right let's get
your hair all good okay close your eyes
good job
good people good keep them close stay
right there I gotta get my brush oh hey
you do move gonna brush it I always
forget which side his hair goes it goes
this way
there's my stylish little two-year-old
can you give me a thumbs up thumbs up
key show your eyes smile big smile
morning guys I'm just getting ready to
do my hair which probably means like a
nice little cute little bun good I not
have
strength or energy to be doing anything
too fancy I have been talking like
midwives because we kind of wanted to go
down and get checked doing NST because
they kind of suggested it but I think in
the end they want me to just kind of
hang get through the day and you know I
just try and relax and have a fun day
instead of like taking the time to kind
of go get iced tea and Yaman world came
out today we you oh that's true you live
Union snack
yeah contractions stainless steel it's a
little mentally exhausting and
definitely whoo trying to just get
through them it's crazy how long you can
deal with contractions I mean I've been
dealing with them now for over for a
week now least they're painful but yet
though they just will not pick up and
it's just like I have had a lot of
breakdowns a lot of complete tears and
crying and that's just how it is I guess
a bit your pregnancy especially if
you're contracting this much like you're
like you just think like hey I'm gonna
have a baby soon and then you don't have
a baby soon I know I'm gonna have a baby
soon but it hurts it so physically
exhausting and mentally exhausting and
and definitely Minds like let's just get
out of the house and pan get your mind
off of it and then if I'm to the point
where I can't get my mind off of it
because I'm in that much pain then that
might mean I'm in labor
costume any fingers that hopefully this
weekend we get to meet little baby Finn
I just want to meet him so badly it's
like who made it out of the house and
look what I'm wearing I'm wearing a fall
sweater and to be honest I'm wearing it
because it's the only thing that fits me
I don't have any like oh my gosh my
maternity clothes don't fit so it's like
a large like big sweater that's supposed
to be like oh you got your shoes on yeah
um it's supposed to be like a large
front of course it like barely fits me
so but they say it's supposed to be
cooler today although I'm sure it's
still pretty warm but look we've got
cloudy skies and you would think that
means cooler weather right yeah I can
