Oliver has been kind of crazy today I
think he's kind of just been like
throwing tantrums okay he tried to give
him a nap we tried to feed him he's just
been really cranky today sunday is also
kind of like our cleaning day
so Maisie and I have been going through
the house vacuuming and mopping and
grabbed her sunglasses catching up on a
lot of housework that we've been needing
to do but now everyone's loaded into the
car and I think we're gonna go outside
and have some fun maybe that's what all
he needs he just needs to go outside and
relax and soak up some vitamin D excuse
me that's really gross we have been
actually just cleaning a lot today but
we are actually celebrating my brother's
birthday because it is this week but
it's sort of land in the middle of the
week and so we just want to make today a
really really good birthday on a Tuesday

can starting 23 why are you crying now

we're gonna go to the park and we're
gonna use some squirt guns we're gonna
play and we're also hoping to fly a kite
my dad's been dying to fly a kind of bug
yeah he had two kites okay and he really
wants to fly with all he just thinks all
I would love to like hold on to the
string and watch a kite fly up this kid
just needs to run around outside yes he
will go pretty grouchy I think mostly
boredom

what I'm talking about so I'm at the
Dollar Tree looking for squirt guns I
see these little guys oh here's some
roomie at the parks we won't really have
access to like too much water but these
look kind of fun that or these little
ones which one I went with three of
these big guys oh I just bought one
package are these four little guys know
that 7 squirt guns and I just couldn't
resist these little tiny David goggles
are so cute they say 6 plus but I really
feel like that was the same not the
six-year-old I know that's why I think I
doubt he'll wear them but I had to get
it it's a dollar store so stuff there

the ball oh look you got to are you

the day

when I get guys is to just play with
this little boy while you do backbeat

Ollie how to use the squirt gun and he
knows how to do it now Jasper do read
this big empty baseball field so he can
run around wherever he wants and he
won't like run out into the street or
anything and it actually is pretty windy
