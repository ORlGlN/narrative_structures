he's like really digging into his
position
oh my favorite position and he just
killed my mom
uh-huh cookie the biggest I've seen it
so far hopefully okay
look at how stinking cute he is you
don't get closer there you go
it's a legal oh I mean I did we were
going to name him Oliver did you feel it
oh my god I did did you really I did it
Missy has snapped what is she doing what
are you doing it's a mess back here to
make it not be a mess I'll be right out
okay cuz he's trying to blow up the pool
with a leaf blower
no way actually load up ready to work
the work you guys
that's crazy Missy it actually works
alright I seriously can't believe I did
that
I like blew up a pool yay now we gotta
fill it up
karma stinks sake this is going to be
for him I think so enough to make rules
he doesn't get in it look at him he's so
cute
I sided let a minute because I thought
he would have fun I think he's having a
lot of fun actually I just I just have
to make sure that he doesn't come in
here like too much cuz then I mean if
he's coming in here and getting wet and
then coming in the house that's not good
he walks he like lives - all his legs up
he's like oh but like he loves swimming
and like legs in the ocean some like
that but he's not really like a fan of
like baths but maybe he's actually
scared afterward yeah okay QT is I'm
going to attempt to get onto this floaty
tube without getting super wet
yesterday we got a package from Jessica
all the way from the land down on
Australia and she sent us a ton of cool
clothes Thank You Jessica that was
awesome but I am so excited because she
sent us Australia goodies baked shake
chips chicken flavored chips cherry ripe
Caramella koala
uh crunchy crunchy bar and then another
baked not fried shapes cheese and bacon
seems pretty interesting so I'm gonna be
trying all this obviously not all today
but I am I kind of do have a sweet tooth
and so I think I'm gonna try this
crunchy bar golden hokey-pokey honeycomb
covered in Cadbury milk chocolate it
kind of looks like a giant Twix kinda
let's see what it tastes like it's
definitely not a Twix looks like actual
like honeycomb well it's kind of like
flaky like um Butterfinger that's so
weird
like you bite into it expecting one
thing you know and then you get that mom
is making me a smoothie and she put
orange juice
strawberries eleven and avocado oh and
of course spinach I'm really really
nervous about this avocado thing though
just finished my smoothie and I can
definitely say I'm out of practice I'm
not very good at drinking these anymore
it is not as appetizing as they used to
be but I'm gonna try and drink this
because it's good for me
Brian's going to attempt to light this
thing I always get really sick dad I
don't know
haha thank you guys we got longer
matches this time so it'll be easier I
think okay
oh good job
yes you did it totes kewl let's try no
explosion uh still got my facial hair
what this train is grilling up some
hamburgers and I'm going to attempt to
make guacamole this is my first time so
we will see I'm just going to try and
mimic what Prime it does but she just
pours a bunch of spices in it I put my
see on guac control not sure how that's
going I'm in the back and I am flipping
burgers because it's just it's such like
a nice day
and so we're grilling grilling in the
afternoon
grilling in the afternoon not very good
at this whole burger thing but see we'll
see
it's just weird cuz like that one's
super cooked this one's super raw that
one's super rod this one's super cook
it's like the grill is never even so I
put salt pepper chili powder garlic
powder and onion powder and I'm going to
mix it up I really hope this turns out
to my very first time I better put this
can't mix it we're going to give some to
Brian see if he likes it I don't know if
it has enough flavor so yes he'll be the
judge
and every time i grill burgers like this
whole thing goes it's like a huge
inferno so I got my spray bottle ready
but he flames want to attack me like
Frank Frank what guacamole it's pretty
good okay heparin just do them more a
little everything this is how the fire
start right here whoa whoa
ah flames going everywhere
flames going everywhere got my cheese on
some of those and all Lord Jesus is a
fire
ain't nobody got time for that
burgers are off the grill and now I'm
making myself I chuckle up but nah ma
shumou dude I totally made my burger
upside-down and I like I piled
everything on and then I put them and I
was like oh that's not a top bun and
apparently mister did the same thing so
great minds think alike so excited good
