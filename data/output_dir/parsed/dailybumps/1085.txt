have anything to drink I have an
aversion to like everything I do have
water here but I usually like something
like actually his drink juicy and yeah
and nothing sounds good I'm different i
iced tea for a long time I was loved
being to ice tea like it looks so good
and it's also just looks like refreshing
but I don't like it
tastes like dirty water to me and I just
tried it again and I still don't like it
be honest trying to find something to
drink that is like refreshing and yummy
and nothing ever sounds good

was only because we were watching her
here tonight yeah yeah it's nice to see
him though and I was like smiling yeah
yeah it's interesting because I feel
like : and his family like they kind of
deal with loss sort of the same way I
feel like my family does it's sad it is
like way too intense for us to almost
like process that you kind of have to
like lose a little bit of your welcome
um he's a little bit of laughter to kind
of numb the pain in a way but um yeah
you guys don't know : lost his dad to
cancer us last night yeah I've heard so
it just sucks cuz : such a great guy
just to see him like upset you know yeah
it was really exciting yesterday I was
just kind of like glued to my phone so I
knew something was going on and we were
just kind of waiting for the update and
when I saw it I just was like oh it
really actually hit me harder than I
thought it would and it like literally
affected me like all night I could not
sleep and when I did sleep I just had
like I just I dreamt of literally : in
his family and whatever he was going
through and it was really really tough
so I feel I feel really that I just
can't
Jenny what that feels like and I don't
want to but I think that's probably part
of the reason why you get really upset
it's just cuz yeah about it yeah you you
know I don't like it I have a yeah let's
not talk be not talked about anymore but
definitely just go show them some love
