to be going to playlist live DC coming
up it's this weekend and so I've got the
band together and we're working on some
supper actually be doing an album
preview on stage there they have us on
the main stage so I'm pretty excited to
show off some new music start performing
again I haven't performed in maybe a
couple of months so probably gonna be a
little rusty
and my producer Daniel and his wife will
also be joining us at playlist live DC
yes so Daniel and Stephanie are coming
we're actually capturing a ton of behind
the deonda it's gonna sound better than

get to experience the craziness that is
playlist live
you
all right it is hair and makeup time and
got my friend Michelle she's over and
today we are putting extensions in again
but this time we are not doing tape in
which I've been doing the tape in and
they're really cool because they're
they're more permanent and they last
like four weeks and maybe even months
sometimes but I'm just like it's
summertime I like to swim I don't like I
don't really like the feeling of them so
we decided to switch to clip in so she
is putting clippings in so I basically
got long hair again so there's I've got
my long hair but they just clip in so
it's really nice I can just take them
out at the end of the day and put them
in when I need them and I think that'll
be a lot more convenient especially
during the summertime when I can't just
like be doing my hair every single night
and blow drying it and all that but this
is gonna be a fun shoot Michelle's gonna
transform me and do all my makeup and
stuff so I'll be nice pin you brushing
