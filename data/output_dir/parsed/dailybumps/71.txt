-  Now it's time to read this,
you wrote this a year ago.
- Ugh, I'm gonna get emotional,
I hate it. (laughs)
- Very few things that make Missy cry.
- (laughs) Apparently I make me cry.
(upbeat bouncy music)
-  Good morning!
- We are up this morning,
and the kids have had a really fun night.
You were up at 5 a.m., mister.
With older kids in the house,
they basically woke up,
ran out into the living room,
and already found Fred.
Where was he?
So, they found him over here.
Hanging upside down with their ornaments--
-  He, he wrote a note.
-  And he wrote a note.
And he says,
"Hi, CJ and Bailey."
Here, do you want to read it?
- Hi, CJ and Bailey.
It's so nice to meet you.
Zippy has told me so much about you guys.
He asked me to bring these back to you,
and that Santa says he hopes
you have a Merry Christmas.
-  He says, Zippy has
told me so much about you guys.
How funny.
- I hope that's good.
-  I know!
And then he says,
Ollie and Finn,
You have been such good boys,
I wanted to share some candy with you,
and your cousins.
Yum.
Fred.
- I didn't eat any of it.
- You didn't eat any?
- Bailey took it.
-  (gasps) So, you guys
already ate all of the candy?
- CJ let me have it.
-  Oh, so you guys
ate all the candy already?
-  Yeah.
- Even left some candy and little notes!
That's so cool.
The kids have been pretty
excited about the Holiday.
They've just been playing, having fun,
and now I think I'm gonna go ahead,
and make some pancakes,
'cause pancakes sound good.
Alright, we all got up
so early this morning,
and now we're off to church.
- Yay!
-  Everyone's
dressed and looking cute.
- This is what it would be
like if we had four kids.
- It's actually pretty
nice having CJ around,
'cause he's so much older.
So, I'm like, you know what,
if you know we end up
having three or four kids,
Ollie's gonna be at an age where,
he can just be extremely
helpful like CJ is.
- Are we having four kids now?
- (laughs) We may just have four kids now.
- Finn is so out.
I don't even know if he can hear me.
- It's so windy.
Yeah, he's asleep.
- Like I said he was up at 5 a.m.,
so he was like, I think
I'm gonna sleep at church.
That might just happen.
- Alright, kiddos, how was church?
- Good!
- What did you do?
That is so cool.
- And we danced!
- You danced?
Look it, you made baby
Jesus in the manger.
Was it cool, CJ?
Did you like it?
Finn did so good, too.
- Wow, you gotta look right up there.
(laughing)
(Ollie mumbling)
- It's not a sword, Ollie, it's a cross.
- Yes it is, it's a sword.
-  How do we
explain this one? (laughs)
To be honest, it does
kind of look like a sword.
Alright, guys, where are we gonna lunch?
-  McDonald's!
- They're really excited about it.
- They are so confused,
but all the kids are so
excited to eat at McDonalds.
- We just, like, were looking for food,
and we like driving past--
- We kinda suckered ourselves into it.
We're gonna McDonald's.
But, honestly, this place has
like a pretty epic play place.
I wish we had play places
like this when I was a kid.
They'll have a blast.
Is our car a little small
for having four kids?
- We're gonna need a bigger car.
-  Do you think
when we have a third baby,
we'll have to get a bigger car?
- I think so, 'cause like even
Ollie's kind of back there,
and that's hard, huh?
-  Yeah.
McDonald's stepping
their game up you guys.
Look at this giant touch screen.
You want to order your food?
Babe, this is like in London, remember?
- Wow.
-  You just order
it on the touch screen.
-  Do you want pickle?
-  This is like a
McDonald's of the future.
You're literally like
selecting every single thing
they don't want on it.
-  Oh, yeah.
-  Wow!
Look at this you guys,
you can even select which toy
you want for the kids meal.
We're gonna go with a holiday toy.
That's cool.
Alrighty, he's climbing up.
We're taking our shoes off.
You can keep your socks on.
Look at this playground, you guys.
This is crazy.
- I'm gonna go up there.
- Alright, have fun.
Bailey has actually made
it all the way to the top.
She's in the control pod. (laughs)
(playful music)
They have a giant touch-screen computer?
That is crazy.
The things they're putting
in McDonald's, guys.
Alright, so we are back
at CJ and Bailey's house.
What happened, Bailey?
- Our Elf is upstairs!
-  What the...
Your Elf?
- Yes!
- I don't know if you guys
have met Zippy before,
but apparently he and
Fred are friends, right?
- Look!
- (gasps) Oh, there he is.
-  That's why it took so long.
-  Hi, Zippy!
- Zippy, did you tell the Elf about us?
-  He must have, huh?
- Yeah!
- That's so cool, you guys,
Fred and Zippy are friends.
- Yeah!
-  Awe.
I like your hat, Zippy.
- Alright, we are home and
I'm already in my pajamas.
Today has just been on of
those days where I was like,
get me home, so I can get into my pajamas.
But, we're really excited,
because we are doing what
we do every single year,
which is go to my parent's,
and decorate the tree,
and it's a big tradition,
and one of my favorites.
I feel like I always say that
every time we do a tradition,
'cause I love all my Christmas traditions.
The kids are actually sleeping in the car,
while we change and
get our stuff together.
And I've got to come into my
very messy closet, right now,
and grab my Christmas letter.
If you guys don't know
about my Christmas letter,
I do it every year,
but I gotta find it.
Not there.
Look in here...
And there it is!
Ah ha!
Says Merry Christmas, 2017.
Do not open until Christmas 2017!
And then I guess I couldn't
find anything to wrap it in,
so I wrapped it in this necklace,
which means I was unable
to wear this necklace
for an entire year, basically.
Anyways, we got the letter,
I got my pajamas,
and I am ready to go celebrate
Christmas at my parent's,
decorate the tree,
do our little traditions.
It's gonna be an exciting night.
(mellow holiday music)
- We are over at Mimi and Papa's house,
and we are decorating the
family Christmas tree over here,
and it's always a fun time.
Are you guys agreeing on anything,
or is Missy just running the whole show?
- I am the older sister,
so I run everything!
- We're getting yelled at a lot.
- Missy has very strong feelings about,
where things go on a Christmas tree.
- (laughs) I just want
it to look good, okay?
It's gotta look good.
- Finn, you'll get in trouble.
-  Hey Finn, look at these lights.
Whoa!
Aren't Christmas lights cool?
(mellow holiday music)
-  Ollie, are you putting
all the ornaments on now?
- Yeah!
- Yeah, you're so happy.
(laughs) He's so happy.
Wow!
We're putting up all the ornaments now,
from, like, our childhood.
We're like going through them.
I feel like we're missing a ton, though.
Because even I know that
there's a few on here that we--
- I think we definitely
lost some important ones.
- Maybe some of them got lost in the move.
-  Yeah.
- We still got some fun ones on here, so.
We still have my mom's goose egg,
because when we lived in Idaho,
she actually had geese,
and yes that is illegal.
- I found abandoned eggs and hatched them,
and they imprinted me,
I can't help that.
- Yeah, she can help it when she says,
(imitating her mom) "Come here, babies!"
- Yeah, I would call them
and they would fly from,
I don't know where, and land at my feet.
-  Yeah.
- I think we have a video of that.
- No, she actually has video of it,
so I bought her a little
egg that had geese on it,
so that it would remind
her always of her geese,
when we lived in Idaho.
Anyway, I got this when I
was, like, a little kid.
I have all kinds of memories on this tree,
which always makes Christmas fun.
I hope that through the years
my kids start remembering,
"Oh, this one is from
when I was in school!"
- Me!
-  Oh look at that!
- That's me!
-  Oh that's yours?
Awe.
This one's Ollie's, and
you say this one's yours?
This one can be yours, for sure.
Oh, wait.
2015, yep that one's yours.
- Hey, Finn, you know who this is?
- Who's that?
- Me!
- (laughs) Me.
- That's you.
- Is that you?
Are you so cute?
He's like, I want it where I can see it.
Alright, the tree is all decorated.
You guys, I still remember
the day my dad got this.
It's so old.
That must have been on the tree
since you've been in the family, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
-  Since I was a little kid.
- I would like to point
out that there is nothing,
-  That's true.
- The decorations end
about the height of you.
- Yeah, we just couldn't reach.(laughs)
The tree looks so good but
we're missing the star.
Hey, boys.
- What?
-  Do you guys
want to put the star on?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
-  Alright, Finn, grab the star.
-  Put it on.
- Push.
(everyone cheers)
-  Good job.
Ollie, do you want to
put the star on, too?
No?
- I guess it's Finn's year.
-  I guess.
- Next year will be Ollie's.
(upbeat holiday music)
- Three!
- Two!
- One!
(cheers)
- How do the lights look?
Oh my gosh, it's lit, it's lit so good.
-  It's lit, man!
It's Merry Litmas!
-  It's so lit.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
(holiday music)
-  Alright, Missy's,
grabbing the Christmas note,
The great Christmas note.
- I always get so nervous,
because I never remember what I wrote,
and, like, what if I was
feeling really emotional,
or if I was feeling like silly,
I made like a weird joke,
and no one gets it.
Like, I don't know what's in this letter.
-  Alright, it's time
to read the Christmas letter.
Do you want to just explain
the Christmas letter?
- Okay.
So, every year, when Christmas is over,
I write a Christmas
letter for the next year.
We started it when I was a kid,
because it was always a fight of,
who gets to put the star on the tree,
and so I'd have to write:
Missy did it this year,
so that means it's Jimmy's turn,
Jimmy did it this year,
that mean's it's Cassie's turn.
So we would do it for that reason.
Then I started to write like,
oh, I wonder, like, what
the next year's gonna bring,
and I'm gonna be 10!
Or you know, so, whatever.
And we have just been reading
it for a long time, and...
-  Now it's time to read this.
You wrote this a year ago.
- Yeah, now it's a huge responsibility,
'cause I've got like kids,
and it's just a thing now,
so, here we go.
-  This is our tradition.
- Merry Christmas!
Another year over.
I'm not exactly sure how many
of these letters I've written,
but it's a lot.
Every year changes so much
and to think back to when
I first started writing these letters.
Wow, we were just talking
about that. (laughs)
It's crazy, we've grown
three new family members,
gone through more
animals than I can count,
and have moved more times
than I can remember,
but one thing that stays the same:
our love for each other.
In fact, our love has
grown just as we have.
I can't wait to see this
family grow even bigger
as the years go on.
We have been so insanely
blessed over the years,
in more ways than one,
and I hope we never take
any of it for granted.
Aw, I'm gonna be emotional.
I hate it. (laughs)
- Very few things make Missy cry.
- (laughs) Apparently I make me cry.
To my boys, it is so crazy...
Hey, I'm writing to you, Ollie.
It is so crazy watching you
guys grow and change each year.
You both are still so little.
Finn, isn't even talking,
and Ollie is just successfully
going potty on the potty,
everyday.
-  Whoo!
- I love watching you boys grow so big.
I can't wait to see your bond strengthen.
I hope you always know how
much Mommy and Daddy love you.
To Bryan, I love you so much,
and hope you always know how much
I appreciate what you have done for me,
our boys, and this family.
You are loved by every single one of us,
and we are so proud to call you ours,
just as I am proud to call you mine.
To my brother and sister.
This year Jimmy graduates from college,
and I'm insanely proud of you.
You have worked so hard for this,
and you deserve every
ounce of happiness in life.
I hope that you take every
opportunity that comes your way,
and don't let anything hold you back.
We love you so much,
and I am so proud to
call you my boy's uncle!
Cassie!
This was you're first year of college,
and you have moved out.
So much has changed for you,
just over the last six months,
I can't imagine what else
you are doing by next year.
We are so proud of you.
You have grown in so many ways.
You may be my younger sister
but you are wiser and stronger
than I ever was at your age.
You are the sweetest auntie to my boys
and hope you will always
have the same bond with them.
Whoo!
Here we go.
Mom and Dad.
You two are the most
amazing people in mine,
and all of our lives.
You have no idea how much we love you,
not just because of
everything you do for us,
but because of what you have taught us.
Your examples of love,
and positive attitudes have
made each of us who we are.
Thank you for falling in love,
and thank you for showing us real love.
You are literally the
greatest mom and papa,
and I'm so happy to know that you have
such a big part in raising our boys.
Merry Christmas!
Don't forget to love on each
other a little more every year,
and to never take for
granted our amazing family.
Love your, Mommy, Wife,
Sister, and Daughter.
P.S.
- (laughs) Oh, no.
- Never forget the true
meaning of Christmas.
It's a time to give back to
those who are less fortunate,
and those that do not have
as much love in their lives.
Let's show others that love exists,
even if it's just with a smile,
or a dollar, or (mumbles).
Happy Birthday, Jesus.
(Bryan laughs)
He is the real reason
we have our family.
-  Merry Christmas,
ladies and gentlemen.
-  Good job!
(cheers)
That was, that was a lot.
-  Missy was a
little emotional last year.
Boys, do you want to do
your advent calenders?
-  They're so excited!
Get in there.
-  What's in there?
-  Ooh!
-  Ooh, presents!
-  What's in there?
-  Yeah.
- I got an alien.
-  An alien!
-  Oh cool!
From Toy Story!
The Star Wars one is so cool.
- Okay, let's see what we did.
-  Oh!
-  What is it?
Just another weird spaceship.
(Bryan laughs)
- Thank you.
Open that one.
What's in there?
You gotta pull it this way, baby.
Oh!
-  What d'you get?
Whoo!
- Another spaceship they can put together.
Yay!
We had such a fun day today.
Huh, boys?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah?
Finn, did you put the star
on Mimi and Papa's tree?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, was that cool?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
And next year you're gonna do it, right?
As a kid, we always took turns.
It was always just one of us,
but I was like, it's so hard,
I just want pictures of doing them both.
When Ollie was like, no I don't want to,
I was like alright, alright,
next year, Ollie will do it.
But, anyways,
I just love really fun
Christmas days with the family.
I just love my little family,
and my big family.
(laughs) You guys are so cute.
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this video.
We're gonna go ahead and end it,
but we'll see you guys tomorrow.
So make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up.
And what do you say, Ollie?
Ready, Ollie?
- Bye!
- Guess they both have to do it now.
(upbeat bouncy music)
