Halloween stuff over there?
(gasping)
(laughing)
You guys are so excited for Halloween.
♫ This is our life, this is our fight
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team
♫ Child among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it.
♫ Live it forever
Good Morning.
Good morning Fin.
We are having a good morning.
We actually switched around
some furniture in the playroom.
We decided we wanted to get a
little bit of a comfier couch.
With the new couch we
thought it would be fun
to kind of switch things up
and see if maybe the couch
looks better here with the table there
and then toy box there,
but I guess we'll see
once we get the thing in.
Oh my goodness there's
like all kinds of fun stuff
going on here; hey how about
you get down, 'kay Ollie?
But anyways we had such
a fun day at Disneyland.
The boys have a little bit of
a cough that they woke up to.
It's not too bad, but I went
ahead and kept Ollie home
from school 'cause I
didn't want him coughing
on all the kids at school, so.
They seem fine; they seem
happy, but we're just gonna
have him rest so he's not making
all the other kids at school sick.
Are you bummed that you
missed school today?
Yeah.
Well hopefully you'll be all
better by Thursday, 'kay?
Fin did you find the
toys at Mimi and Papa's?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
He's having so much fun
playing with the toys.
And I have a quick
appointment I have to do
and then I'm gonna be back so the boys
are gonna hang out with Mimi real quick.
While Bryan has some meetings
as well and then we're off.
Have fun with them.
- Okay.
- Have fun with them Leo.
He's so scared of them.
So I'm out trying to get some errands done
while Bryan's doing
stuff and Ollie and Fin
are with my mom and I just
realized I literally drove
like probably 30 minutes out of my way
and I do not have my wallet.
I actually put all my cards
into like a little easy to carry
like thing when I went to Disneyland
and I stuck it in the backpack
and the backpack's at home.
So I'm so bummed.
I can't do anything; in
fact, I'm driving around
without even a license so.
Ugh, I'm so bummed.
I always forget everything.
It's kinda just part of who I am.
I'm pretty much use to it at this point,
but it's still annoying.
If you didn't know, the other
day I even, I lost my phone
at Target and yeah, don't have my wallet.
So, now I've gotta go home.
Hey I'm back.
Have you guys been having fun at Mimi's?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Getting along?
Alright boys, Momma's got her wallet.
This is what I carry it in
when I go to Disneyland.
So I got it now; now
I just need to use it.
I have to go grocery shopping.
Are you ready to go grocery shopping?
Alright I'm kinda hoping Fin falls asleep.
He's been having a really
hard time taking naps
because he does not sleep
well in his crib anymore.
Which I gotta show you his new set up,
but bedtime's good because
he's usually ready for bed,
but nap time doesn't go so well.
So I'm like, okay let's sleep in the car
before we go shopping; that might be good.
Off we go shopping, 'kay boys?
Alright we are getting
some grocery shopping done.
I've got all kinds of goodies in here.
- Halloween!
-  He's trying to say Halloween.
Say it again.
- Halloween.
- Halloween.
(baby talking)
- They are obsessed; when
they see the Halloween stuff,
they like start singing
songs and get so excited.
Alright, we'll go look
at the Halloween stuff.
Wow that's so cool.
Look at all that Halloween stuff.
- It's so creepy.
-  Do you see the
Halloween stuff over there?
(gasping)
(laughing)
You guys are so excited for Halloween.
- I'm excited to go trick-or-treating.
-  Yeah.
Halloween.
- How about we get
Skittles for Halloween?
-  Oo, yum.
We are in the Halloween aisle
and Ollie just put this on.
Show you're brother.
- Ah!
-  He's like,
get that away from me.
You're scaring him.
Here you can hold, you can wear it.
He doesn't like that at all.
Look at all this like pumpkin spice stuff.
It's actually pretty funny.
- That's Halloween candy popsicles.
- Oh my gosh, there's
Halloween candy everything.
Yeah they've got like Halloween Oreos,
Pumpkin Spice Rolls.
They've got pumpkin muffins
and everything is in
Halloween decor.
-  Come here.
-  We have this toy
at home and Fin still is
obsessed with it, even at the store.
Yeah.
They like looking at all
the cool toys right now.
- Dada.
- Hi Fin!
How was you're day?
Okay bye.
(laughing)
Hey guys.
So Missy and the boys just got
home to a very messy camera,
I see; gonna give that a good wiping.
Missy just got home with
the boys and Fin jumped out
of the car and had to jump on
his Wild Thing, didn't you?
Go!
Whoa!
You gonna try and run over me?
Whoa!
Oh these boys are so cute.
They had such a fun day
hanging out with Mama, huh?
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
So funny 'cause this one like
has so much energy and
Ollie is passed out.
Passed out; oh look we have pumpkins.
That's for our top secret project.
How many people is this little car for?
- I don't know if it's gonna move, ready?
Here we go.
-  Good morning Ollie!
Ollie just woke up so he
needs a little bit of rousing.
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)
Whoa!
Hey Ollie, how was your nap?
- Good.
- Good, is that a
fun way to wake up?
- Yeah.
-  Fin you're driving Momma, 'kay?
- Ready go!
Ah! You gotta turn.
-  Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh.
Whoa!
- Ah!
- That is so cute.
We got a crazy driver on our
hands ladies and gentlemen.
You ride with your brother, 'kay?
Fin's like come on let's go.
And go!
Whoa!
He did some drifting there huh?
(laughing)
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)
Running over Mommy in the power wheels.
You guys gotta be careful.
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)
They could actually cause
some damage in that thing.
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)
You guys okay?
You went over the curb.
- Got into your first accident.
Ah!
Ah!
(laughing)
- Whoa.
Excuse me sir, I'd like to
see your driver's license
and registration please, oh!
Oh Geez!
(laughing)
Saved you.
Are you okay?
- Ollie.
You're brother was falling
out, you gotta be careful.
-  Are you okay Fin?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Say you're sorry to Fin.
- Sorry Fin.
- Say it's okay.
- Okay.
- You can get out.
-  That's some
reckless power wheels driving
right there you guys.
Alright.
Bye.
They're leaving.
Oh wow.
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)
Should we take his
driver's license away Fin?
- Say yeah!
- Yeah.
-  Whoa!
You're crazy.
Stop! Oh!
He was looking behind the whole time.
Ollie you ran into our trees.
Geez.
Be careful next time okay?
I think Fin is actually liking this more.
- Ah!
That actually scared me for a minute.
-  Well yeah, he's crazy.
-  What are you doing?
- Alright we are stocking
up the Halloween calendar.
-  Yeah! So I grabbed
these little Starburst.
Each Starburst has two
pieces of candy in it
so each kid gets a little
candy every day in October.
- Yeah if you guys don't know
about our new little
tradition, I'll have that video
linked in the I card.
But we gotta get ready
'cause October first
starts in four days.
-  Yeah.
- You guys this is the
best Halloween ever.
- Oh yeah.
- Is it gonna be
the best Halloween ever?
- Yeah.
-  It's gonna be pretty fun.
You guys are gonna be so cute.
- This is an awkward
placement for the candy.
-  Oh my gosh.
- What?
-  We're putting candy in there
'cause everyday you get to go
in and get one piece of candy.
- Oh!
- Is that cool?
We gotta put all the candies in.
(upbeat music)
You gotta take a bite; hurry, hurry.
Oh is it all gone?
Not yet? Almost?
Okay, oh you gotta take a bite first.
-  Missy's playing games with them
to get them to eat all their food.
- Oh it's a winner.
-  Ollie wins.
Sorry Fin.
- Okay let's each take a bite of carrots
and see who eats the fastest ready?
One, two, three, take a bite.
- Take a bite.
Who's gonna eat it first?
Chew it all up, chew it all up!
If you guys watched our picky
eater's challenge this week
you know that we have very picky eaters
and sometimes it's hard
to get 'em just to eat
what they actually like.
Missy has devised a little
game that she plays with them
and it's kind of like
makes it competitive.
- Ollie's like, I'm the fire boy.
-  You're fire boy?
And what's Fin?
- Fin's the water boy.
-  Fin's water boy, okay.
- And then they usually run around
and try and eat their food the fastest
and show me their mouth.
- That's so cute.
(laughing)
You're such a good mom.
That's seriously so fun
and it actually works.
Most of the time, usually.
So I am making dinner.
I got all the boys to bed.
I'm making some Tortellini and Missy is
running around our house right now.
- I'm just going, catch
up with everyone else.
Everyone's beating me.
- As you guys know,
Missy got an Apple Watch
the other day after refusing
to have one for so long.
She's like okay I'm gonna
do it because I like
to stay active and I'm
working out and stuff.
And so she got an Apple
Watch and now she shares
her activity with a handful of friends
and she is very lacking
according to those friends
so she--
- I worked out today.
I went to the gym, I ran,
but I didn't bring my watch.
So it's like it didn't count.
- Yeah, so now she's doing
laps around our house.
Because all of our friends
are doing very well
on the activity app, so good for you guys.
(laughing)
And Missy forgot her
Appple Watch this morning
when she went to the
gym which is super sad.
You can do it!
- We got 15 minutes.
- I believe in you babe.
Should I have a water bottle?
Should I be like spraying
water on you or something?
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
- Alright, kids are in bed.
We got all our shopping done today.
It was actually a super
productive day, but now
we are tired and it's time for bed.
But I did wanna let you
guys know that there is
a brand new fantastic
family time machine up
