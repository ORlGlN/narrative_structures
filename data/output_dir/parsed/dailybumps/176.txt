(laughs)
There's Moana.
All of the chickens are doing so good.
We are a little low on
eggs for some reason.
- Yeah.
- Do you think it's like the hot weather?
- Could be like maybe
- Too hot?

Could be that actually their
on like chick starter food.
So their not able, their not
getting as much nutrients
as they normally do.
- Oh yeah.
- So their not able to produce as well.
-  Yeah.
Once these little ones start laying eggs,
we're gonna have so many eggs you guys.
It's gonna be ridiculous.
-  Hey get out
of our black berries.
Missy, they're eating
our black berry bushes.
Alright you guys, so all of the boys
are out in the swimming
pool and they're swimming.
(shushes)
And we have a little bit of a secret.
We're gonna play a prank on them.
If you guys didn't know,
around Christmas time,
Elf On The Shelf filled this
playroom 25,000 ball pit balls.
We are going to fill this playroom
with some Wubble Bubble
Balls, and prank the kids.
- Yeah
- It's gonna be awesome
Let's do it.
- They're gonna be shocked.
- Let's do this.
-  Alright we are
getting the air compressor
trailing through the house right now.
This is gonna be perfect.
(chuckles)
- It reaches the whole way in.
-  Yeah.
Bring it right to the playroom.
Check out all of these
Wubble Bubble Balls.
We have pink ones and we have blue ones.
It's kinda like we're
doing a gender reveal.
But not really, we're
just filling up a playroom
with a ton of Wubble Bubble Balls.
I love the feeling of these though.
-  Ginger's getting her vacuum on.
- Hell yeah.
-  Just so the kids
don't step in anything gross
when they claw through here.
- I've been trying to
pick up all the popcorn
that all these boys spilled last night.
-  Oh yeah.
(upbeat relaxing music)
(air hisses)
Here we go.

Our entire house is full of his-
I'm not really sure what we're gonna do
at this present time with all
of these Wubble Bubble Balls.
But all I know is we're basically
trapped with all of them now.
They live among us.
