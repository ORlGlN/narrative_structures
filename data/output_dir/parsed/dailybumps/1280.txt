today is our last day in Seattle we are
getting ready to fly home when you mean
call it a day of calling the last hour
yeah it's like the last hour that we're
gonna be in Seattle but we had so much
fun and now we basically have to say
goodbye this is our son baby this is our
boy is gonna do amazing things this is
the fake goodbye the real goodbyes after
the camera shuts off Holly doesn't have
fun nobody's time for real hi my ID my
voice is also basically completely gone
I'm hurting again I know mines getting
worse okay
it's cuz we also I know we go home just
make it out she are just like group like
crazy it's so much fun with you guys
we are definitely had a blast talk we're
like wow we're so good don't worry we'll
all be getting together very soon right
we're gonna come use your hot tub like
yeah no joke everyday cuz there was not
a pool here and we're still mad oh yeah
hi everyone say goodbye to Ellie and
Jared in Jackson nice meeting you all
it was nice meeting you guys
just made it to airport we actually took
an uber which was so nice we had like a
big SUV so we're able to like easily
stuff everything in their.all we totally
passed out on the way I already checked
in we actually did it right on the curb
which I've never done before he did
everything for us and now I just have my
luggage we got Olly he's passed out so
no I I was lifting up his eyelids
I'm not kidding like I was like Livesey
was I was like moving his face around
nothing he's exhausted from this trip I
I hope he sleeps on the plane but I'm
worried that could be sleeping now we're
gonna have a rowdy baby when we get it
up in the plane give me a little crazy
that music is a great place to stay
official we're letting Olly run around
Oh we'll take him there he goes there he
goes we thought alike yeah we're getting
ready just uh oh sorry
waiting for our flight and it's funny we
actually just ran into Charles Trippy
I'm psyched he's right over there which
it's pretty cool we saw on my vlog
repairing we kind of talked but this is
nice that way I got to actually just
chousen for a second yeah hey you got a
picture
yo seen Olly was dancing in Charles to
respond so that's pretty neat I really
want only turn around the whole room but
it's really hard cuz he just go through
people's way go go go be free before
hopefully he sleeps on this like your
last one he was pretty upset with
we're on the plane on the fly and it
always works out
we never get seats next to each other
but everyone is always so nice there's
no sense better so even though I was
sitting up there I'd have like 5 feet on
the ground
last time had like two seats next to me
yeah I would have been able to check it
out hi I would rather sit with Missy and
this guy hey buddy are you gonna be good
on this blood he was not good on my last
night's ping that elbow when I went to
me Charles
he said his computer on on the seat next
to him and it literally was falling and
I grabbed it saved it and it was like oh
thank you
and then his camera fell and smashed
onto the ground he's like and whatever
he's literally gone through like I can't
even count probably on there so you
behind bad because I'm always buying the
cameras imagine his camera but there
yeah good because it
I'll need some room to
it was quite quite Daisy
they hammer
like little babies for
by Jake
ah
for the ice melted
it was like shaking it and
see let's go there next Kadri Oh Missy
wait stop
move over to the left Oh
we're in Paris haha it totally looked
like it else buddy except I was a black
man we just landed all we decide to
sleep for the last 20 minutes of the
flight which was great that's not great
but we're in LA and you're shy bad Oh
Tokyo
this extensive urban railway network in
the whole world I just learned to that
hike place is the oldest continually
operating farmers market in the United
States
yeah on our very long drive home and
could end up being longer than our
flight because look at this traffic
we're actually wearing car pool so we're
moving but as you can see if we're over
there when you move it as fast so far so
good always passed out which is always
good news because it could be a lot
worse sitting in traffic because if
you're staying in traffic with a
screaming baby it's just no fun no fun
at all I don't believe how tired I am
because I feel like I don't know I just
feel like I think we're more tired too
because we've literally we like walked
everywhere yeah we did we run in that
car but we never hardly drove I know we
totally should've rented a car because
we basically had public transportation
everywhere and everything was close
enough to walk but like our whole bodies
are like a king we probably walked like
miles my calves and like the front of my
legs right here oh my gosh they are like
on fire yeah it's so much fun in Seattle
like I've been enjoyed it and I
definitely feel like we could have done
a lot more if we had more time we
probably only really swiped like the
surface so skier maybe we'll plan more
time or just you know do things that we
didn't get to do
6a and we'll definitely good next year
right yeah totally I just can't wait to
hang out with Jared and Ellie again when
we both don't have something to do yeah
I like vlogger fair like yeah I just
come and we just have like a couple days
to do whatever we want
yeah I know I were really excited were
planning their trip big time so
hopefully we'll be soon you hear Brian's
voice too it's so bad it's really bad it
got will work or they just gone no it's

I've ever experienced of my voice going
away with if it didn't have like a sore
throat or at being people I actually
have a do a little bit of a sore throat

we're out of the car touch it touch the
ground doesn't it feel good you can walk

two-and-a-half hours that it took to get
home it was so nice but now it's like so
late it's bedtime and you're not gonna
sleep yeah also we have absolutely no
food at home because we did not Gro
grocery shopping and we need a good a
hearty meal so we're running into PJ's
