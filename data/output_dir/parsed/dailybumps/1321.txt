radio so which one's the Beast

turned on some Disney radio Beauty and
the Beast would come on eventually and
she'd wake up and enjoy the day with us
hmm guess what guys I'm trying today I
put on a little makeup I actually did my
hair I put on real clothes and I'm
trying today yesterday I was like I'm
not going to try not gonna do my makeup

just need like a day off and like the
whole makeup and hair and stuff like
that to feel pretty so that is basically
what I'm doing today and we're gonna do
some laundry this monkey has been in our
closet for a while and he just went in

dressed let's go what should you wear
today let's throw some of these sausages
on the grill
they're simply balanced all-natural
spinach and garlic chicken sausages they
sound really good they have no
artificial ingredients that minimally
processed 80 percent less fat than pork
sausage so we never had sausage like
it's like a spinach and garlic and stuff
so we'll see how that turns out got my
grill all heated this is what they look
like out of the package and these are
just like heat and serve I guess I
already fully cooked I don't know I
don't ever cook sausages it is bright
out here you guys this whole area was
flooded with like three inches of water
so I try to sweep most of it over to
that one it looks like it's finally
draining but I guess that sprinkler
right there in the corner was completely
broken it just like popped off I think
I'm supposed to be here today to fix it
but it was literally like just a gushing
of water the trees actually soaking wet

it it's just a good excuse
well guys what's for dinner what do you
guys want for dinner what do you feel
like what about Chinese how do you guys
feel about Chinese y'all like Chinese
right and it was fun it was just kind of
like a family day really we just got to
like be around each other and enjoy each
other's company I think that's just
awesome and I think it's always
something I want to push these vlogs you
guys it's just family family family and
actually we have you guys know the intro
song at the beginning of our vlogs as
miracle in the making it's the song you
know just really about anticipating
Oliver and you know his arrival into our
life and what it's done for us and and
how amazing it is but really you know
after his birthday we're just going to
be going into a new chapter of life it's
going to be like a new chapter for our
family and so that song needs to depict
that and so actually I have my buddy
Jared and Rochelle in Idaho when we met
up with them last we started talking
about you know what that would sound
like through a couple things out there
and they're working on it and so it's
actually going to be done this week
which I'm really really excited because
I just want to hear it so bad and it
will probably be like a special video
just like we did for miracle in the
making and then you know will like mold
it to our intro and all but I really
liked having like five different intros
that I could like swap between people
have been getting a little annoyed with
the intro just because it's like the
only one and
the same thing every time but I think
different intros are better what do you
feel do you think do you like the same
intro every single time or do you want
like different ones that like it cycles
through essentially I don't I like the
cycle through thing just because it like
there's a little more variety you know
it's a little harder for me because I
have to come up with five and honestly I
should just do seven just one for every
day of the week are you making this is
all these new song download link for
iTunes is in the description we just
opened up all this candy
