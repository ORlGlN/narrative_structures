sure yeah she had to take them to a
doctor for a little checked out he
didn't get a band-aid yeah no he did get
some medicine because there was
something wrong with him but she will
explain that later yeah she's on her way
home we had a really good Valentine's
morning didn't we I love you yeah that's
what Valentine's Day is all about just
sharing things with the ones you love
and letting them know that you love them
right we're okay good morning guys and
happy Valentine's Day I had to leave
early this morning for a doctor's
appointment
but I finally just got home before I
tell you about how my Ducks appointment
was I wanted to show you these really
pretty roses look how pretty and look
over here more flowers a little gift and
I did get the boys some some little
Valentine's treats which they haven't
seen yet well maybe if it has but he
hasn't noticed but anyways and now I am
if you come fancies strawberries for
Brian I made some the other day but I
wanted to make them this time a little
bit nicer I maybe put some white
chocolate on top of them maybe sprinkle
them with like some red and white
sprinkles maybe just do something a
little fun with them some I worked on
that right now but I want to tell you
about big appointment so today he went
to his a physical which was basically
just lets be like his 15 months like
checkup kind of thing he has had a cost
for the past couple days so I wanted to
ask her about it and she did listening
to him and she noticed I had a little
bit of wheezing and so we had to do a
little breathing treatment on him and
the wheezing went away after the
breathing treatment then I had to go get
his prescription it looks like he will
have to do this PLT use a nebulizer
every like few hours or so depending on
how his his breathing is if I can make
out meaning he's like totally fine he
does that he probably just has a regular
cloth but for him it tends to get down
into his like mommy pastors and so it's
so hopefully he'll hopefully grow out of
it soon so that he won't need nebulizers
but it may just be that whenever he gets
a cold he needs like a nebulizer which
kind of is a bummer we got all this
prescription we got in his nebulizer and
we're just going to keep it over your
hair max left I was on time today I mean
I got a happy Valentine's Day my two
