oh hi Carmen wants to say I say hi say
hi or so today was quite possibly the
worst travel day we've ever had we
actually have a vlog on YouTube called I
think like worst travel day ever and
this definitely Trump's it Finn was so
needy on the flight he wouldn't let
anyone but Missy hold him which was
frustrating because I couldn't do
anything to help
it was just like constant it was like 9
hours straight of like constantly being
on him then we got in a car and he got
so upset that he threw up all over
himself three times and there was
literally nothing we could do so we
literally just got home as fast as we
could and threw him in the shower and
clean them up and stuff it was very
difficult it was a very difficult travel
day
I told me I feel like we both just did
the best that we could sometimes you
just have to roll a die and you have a
good day or you have a bad one so yeah
definitely was pretty rough travel days
just good I'm good room
