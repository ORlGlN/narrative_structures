around over here though yeah we got the
little baby in bed taking a nice sum of
that before we um head to our photo
shoot and I've been spending most of the
day actually trying to plan our outfits
for the photo shoot and I'm not like
awesome at this but our friend Emily who
is actually taking our photos is really
awesome at this so we've been like
chatting back and forth all day so we
got Brian that's cool
like wouldn't Lionel see you look like
Brian do look like Connor Franta ha ha I
guess he does where that's all right
he's the one who did the American Eagle

is basically always outfit he's wearing
a cream with this really really cute
sweater and things black pants and of
course it's boots and then I don't have

warmers this might be too much and then

just want to look really really nice
karma chameleon how are you today
you know what a lot of people are
worried about you let's talk about you
real quick let's talk about karma
chameleon okay guys I haven't getting a
lot of concerns about Karma I just want
everyone know Karma's a very good dog
he's very well loved he's very well
taken care of you know a lot of people
are like concerned about certain things
so I'm just gonna lay it out there right
now okay he sleeps in our bed every
night every night he sleeps on her bed
he is like that naughty he is allowed on
the couches when he's cuddling but he's
not allowed to like jump on them and
like when he's playing cuz his nails
will scratch the couch and it could tear
it so we don't let him like jump off and
not in the couch but we do cuddle on the
couch at night yes is great so that he
can sit in there and relax and hang out
he goes over to my mom's to play often
we do take him on walks but we can't
vlog that because we don't vlog like
around our neighborhood or anything um
the one thing I think he is missing is
like socialization he doesn't quite get
to like hang out with a lot of dogs but
he's a very you know well taken care of
dog that gets to play and go on walks
and we love karma and he is naughty at
times and he does get in trouble at
times just like most dogs but for the
most part he is a very very good dog you
know I think he does need some more
socialization so I think we might
actually be figuring out some way to do
that and we have derived ladies and
gentlemen so we are at this really cool
Christmas tree farm we actually did not
know about this but you can come here
you can cut down your own Christmas tree
load it up like good old-fashioned way
