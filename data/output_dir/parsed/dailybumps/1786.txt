today I was sitting in the car and I was
getting gas awesome I literally felt
like a bulge like I felt like they were
trying to wait were you getting gas or
having gas okay so much
oh yeah
having a boy is good morning guys
it is about 9:00 something I'm headed
over to get the arm water that Missy
actually found and now we found this on
what well whatever friends found the
armoire and it's not like a real big one
it looks like a baby on water but our
friend actually offered up to like
refurbish the whole thing like to sand
it paint it to sort of meet like the the
theme that we're going for for baby boy
landings nursery I am headed over there
to get that and all Polly it's a nice
condition because they live on thirty
five bucks for it
and I'm a firm believer that if it
sounds too good to be true then it
probably is but we'll see it looked
pretty nice in the pictures but you know
people sell some crazy things on
Craigslist
this is like a really sketchy part of
town but look at its got any look happy
to be out here normally they like have
so much energy this guy like looks like
he just ate ten donuts or something
funny story
um this person's texting uh funny story
Missy actually used to do that for like
a day when she really needed a job okay
so I actually just got here to where I
need to go for to get the armoire and
I'm really afraid to get out I should
not have gone alone I should not have
gone alone I really just I don't want to
get stabbed
um that would be nice if I got through
today without getting stabbed you know I
still like it so here's the armoire it's
got nice drawers on the last Victor on
the bottom nice and that could be a good
spot if you want you know but yeah yeah
I would be more in today's you know with
a little with a little back Ron yeah
exactly I don't know about the width oh
that's the trouble is church yeah yeah
so we'll probably try to find a way to
take these out and make it a nice little
it would work hanging attached yeah
that's true and that's what's nice you
don't get door handles like this anymore
they're just one and he pull off yeah so
that's what's nice and uh very cool okay
so that wasn't so bad but at like I we
finally got it loaded in and he's like
oh let me go show you this bed we're
thinking about selling and I was like oh
well Missy actually wants a new bed and
he's like well let me go show it to you
because I'm think I'm about to sell it
it's a California king and I'm like okay
I just like you guys if you go out
you're gonna make a purchase on
Craigslist
go with someone like that it just
freaked me out like I should not have
gone in their house but I did it was
just a really nice old guy and he kept
telling me about how he liked when he
moved in there was no other houses and
he put all the lawn and he showed me all
the trees and telling me all the types
of trees and ah you guys go go with a
partner
I am glad though I got I got it in here
so help me see likes it this is cleaning
out work and she's making Jimmy and I do
it too
I was just listening to her and then I
noticed that we're wearing the same
shirt DC yeah
why do you copy me do you have any exit
Sulphurs no you helping me I put this on
I bet you put that on first Hey look at
bizzy's wallpapers go mohan you had that
on there he looks so cute map picture he
looks like a puppy yeah but he's not
that was only like a month ago
oh really yeah
look what we just found a Missy's work
phonograph whoa
what is the phonograph that's really
cool thanks gran gran Pennsylvania dirty
scratch in allele Italy oh I see huh
we saw the message listen good
Oh what did we just find something worth
a lot of money we need to like I feel
like this is like a message from the
past like maybe we need to send a
message to the future so is that like
reading that so is that kind of like the
same sort of thing that like record
player does on a record all right guys
here you go first meal of the day and
it's almost three o'clock I just made
myself a cheeseburger and I actually
overcooked it a little usually I like a
little pink almost red in the middle but
I'm starving so I'm gonna scarf this
down so I just got off but yesterday I
started complaining about that back pain
and today I came and believe how bad it
is I really do need to go see I can't I
can't figure out if it is I need a
massage or if I need a chiropractor
right now it's feeling like muscles so I
believe a massage then but normally um I
just also feel like I need a bad car key
out and it's coming in like spasms like
I'll have it like really really bad like
a little tensed up really really hard
and then it will release but it's still
there but kind of just miserable but I
really want to go get this paint and
everything so I can give it to my friend
I'm gonna have actually my friend is
gonna totally refurbish and redo the
armoire that we bought yesterday or
about today did you show them it yeah
yeah I thought I just I'm so in love
with it I think it's exactly what I
seriously have wanted because I didn't
want it to be too big get it the right
color and change out the knobs and
everything I'm seriously in love with it
oh and I'm seeing the top comment right
now for our chalkboard is that you want
to list a ton of names and then everyday
will cross off one which i think is a
really good idea so if that one ends up
winning I think that's gonna be what
we're gonna do yeah we'll basically call
it tonight the only problem is that we
have to think of a
more being boy names and it was hard
enough already why I know we do have one
yeah
we have one in that it's not that we
like I mean that's the one that works we
try we did choose one but it was hard
enough figuring ones that we even
slightly liked yeah
so we're gonna have to like think of
like 30
this baby's doing flips in here she I
was sitting in the car and I was getting
gas awesome I literally felt like a
bulge like I felt like they were trying
oh wait were you getting gas are having
gas I was laying down here's like you're
squishing me okay I imagine him sounding
very bratty when he talks I don't know
why I would he's gonna be like you're
squishing you're so wishing me good mom
oh hey covers like remember me yeah
remember when we used to play involved
please Brian just bought in my new
dresser and I thinking love it yeah it
to Sadie's oh yeah we're gonna take
these out and make it um like a hanging
for clothes have it look it looks like
it's inside of it yeah so I don't know
okay this is where the baby can sleep oh
yeah
so we have like a cribben I'm on the
machine and I are about to go out and
get some paint so that we can get
everything we need to refurbish that
really cool armoire we found for the
baby and since then we've been talking
about cribs and we've been looking for
cribs and we kind of just wanted to get
that done because we wanted it to match
the armoire um and so we want to know
exactly what we were getting and we
found a really really great deal online
and I'm about to buy it and she's
freaking out well I just wanna be a
hundred percent sure okay obviously we
all know that she was she even said she
was a hundred percent sure probably
about 15 minutes ago and then I said
okay I'm gonna place the order and then
she started freaking out
okay I just want to make sure that it's
the best what is it bang for our buck
but the thing is we're buying a lot of
things used and I think if we're not
buying one thing used and it might as
well just be the crib especially because
of the deal we found I'm gonna
understand that and the mattress comes
with it which is nice and it's new I
like that I literally am about to place
the order it'll be at our house in a
week
okay next week there's a swing and
highchair crib for $5.00 Missy okay
that's great okay you ready yeah gonna
buy it do it are you ready let's do it
together okay wait wait wait
three two one can't do it together wait
is the thing is spinning oh it is did we
push it
I think cuz you can't do it at the
sander oh it's working it's working we
just bought a crib but our baby crib I'm
super stoked to see it I can't wait for
you I can't wait to see you put it
together yeah that's gonna be fun
it's not crazy how like in the 21st
century we are sitting in our car in a
parking lot and we just bought a crib
son that's awesome so now we need to go
get some paint
yep that's a white paint that matches I
had to settle with white so the dresser
will be white unless we want do it
different no we're leaving when we get
in the car Bryan always likes to plug
his phone in because it's charging but
we do a little game because whoever's
phone is the least amount charged gets
to have it so Ryan's right now is 29% if
you couldn't see it 26% a 6% mine's at
8% so I win sometimes I wanted to go
somewhere just like in charge my phone
even though I have one in my room I
don't like to sit now always don't like
let's go somewhere and then I know I get
to Trek oh that's really weird I was
thinking it earlier and I was like we
should go somewhere that I can charge my
phone somebody spit their gum out a bug
flew in my mouth and so I had to like
spit everything out of my mouth and then
now Missy is proceeding to cover it up
so that people don't step in it
you're weird
picking out swatches so dumb swatches I
think that's what they're called in
Photoshop or in color right here yeah
but these are kind of the colors we're
going I really like this one it's called
Bermuda Bay very ocean II and Missy
likes the more blue one okay well look
did we do the baby's room like this
color then we could do our room like
this color blue like a little darker
yeah yeah look at the names on here guys
you probably can't read them but like I
just wanna know if you has the job of
naming different shades of paint so we
have like like seven shades of blue here
and we have deep transatlantic blue blue
cup Kree grotto vacation seaside blue a
bird's-eye view rising tide water what's
why magical elation nature's cool water
pond
I see peppermint vinca he's weird like
all these like every single shade has to
have a unique name I wonder how much
these people get paid just sit there and
think of paint names this really makes
me sad we're in Walmart and there's fish
on the shelves like to buy they're like
little betas hey buddy
but look at they all look so sad and
their things aren't clean and what if
they forget to feed them then they die
it probably have to take to make sure
they're all live I don't know
and these they just they all look dead
and miserable and it's just weird to me
this tightness will only last a few
seconds I mean if the pressure is too
much you can stop this test by pressing
the stop button at any time we are
releasing your blood pressure's high
please sit as still as possible when
this test is in progress don't eat it as
soon as the test is completed you will
be instructed to remove your arms please
continue to sit as still as possible
situation knows I'm being really moved
just a few more seconds and the blood
pressure track will be complete place it
was possible my god does she know I'm
moving
the test is almost ticklish she fails me
move exam is the test every time as he
moves the lady yells at her your arm 89
over 56 that's good that's great a blood
pressure to 90 when I didn't take it
mine took like way longer nice thing is
because I was like talking and moving
like please get along minute 121 that's
fair that's not as good as mine
your moderate risk for developing
hypertension we contribute our artery
disease artery damage or kidney failure
what it's not really bad you guys it
says it's fair come on
and in this okay for mine it was like it
was like all the way down here and I'm
like all the way up here oh my gosh I
cannot believe how bad my back has been
hurting today is like excruciating so
and I know I need to go eat either a
massage or chiropractor and I really do
want to get a chiropractic thing but but
now I remembered watching um a video on
actually the mama natural channel if you
haven't seen her she's kind of like
she's awesome
like I like obsessed with her she
basically gives you a do-it-yourself
idea to help with any kind of back pain
it even helps I guess during back labor
so I'm gonna make it right now basically
consists of nylons these things
tennis balls they smell like yeah like
so you cut it up here what just my
favorite man but there's work sorry Oh
looks like why are you doing it then
they had a Terran um yeah
wait are you supposed to cut that one
yeah sure hey cut out both sides
you go about six inches up I believe and
your tie will not and then you put a
ball back down here okay and then you
tie it really tight so that it doesn't
really move around okay then she said go
up about two inches and tie another knot
and then do another ball and then tie
another knot she said it was not there
is a very ugly contraption yeah
definitely yes weird no all I know is I
supposed to do this part okay so now I
guess I just I rub these all over her
roll them like this yeah are you sure it
just doesn't feel like a tennis ball
shoved into a stocking being rolled all
over your back no it doesn't feel it
it's not enough pressure it's definitely
gonna need a second okay I need my other
hand side to stop vlogging but that's
really weird weird pregnancy trick now
that he has to and that actually feels
really good
a to expression
honestly Brian's not very good at
massaging so I knew he needed a tool in
order to do so so I think I figured out
the key I think that when I was laying
on the bed it wasn't really working
because my position was making it really
difficult and he was hitting bones so
when I get down like on my knees and
like stick like almost it might pop my
back up No
and then he can take it and just roll it
right up my back yeah works better and
it works perfectly and it's seriously
felt amazing the only thing is that it
feels amazing while you're doing it and
then afterwards it's like okay now my
back hurts again you can't sit there for
three hours and do it time I like say
huh okay ready oh okay and missing I've
been talking about the whole chalkboard
thing okay so I promised you guys last
night that whatever suggested
that you guys put in the comments
whatever had the top amount of votes
that we would choose so how many votes
is that one half Ashley Derek four had
an awesome suggestion it right now has
almost a hundred up votes she says I
think you should write a ton of boy
names on the board one of them being the
name and then everyday cross off a name
until you get down to the name you
chosen for the baby boy and so that's
what we're gonna do Maci and I compiled
a list how many names were on it I think
we're close to 30 now so we're close to
30 and now the name reveal video Missy
was mentioning how she wants it to be
pretty soon yeah I don't actually not
like a whole month so we might even
cross off like two names a night till we
get to there but we're gonna have the
name reveal video because we we do have
a name and yes we are going to do a
video and we're gonna do something
really cool almost like we did for the
gender reveal something that's like
completely different like a reveal video
for the name yeah and we're gonna have
that premiere and then the next day
we'll cross off the last name obviously
on the chalkboard and you guys will see
that it's been there the whole time and
so I think this is really cool idea so
we've compiled a list and now we are
going to design the chalkboard alright
again ready to a race are cute board
isn't for a long time and that took me a
long time I know I'm really sad hey ray
okay so start with the just service to
you erased it all I'm gonna start with
the word okay guys so I have written
down all of the names on the chalkboard
I'm gonna show them to you but just to
clarify everyday we're going to starting
with tomorrow okay so every day we're
going to scratch out a name that is
obviously not the name and this is sort
of going to serve as a countdown to the
name reveal video what you think the
name that we've chosen is let us know in
the comments out of all these the
chalkboard looks kind of cluttered here
I'll show you how it looks like boom
there's a lot of names on this baby if
you want to pause and read them all
right now is a good time to do it and
then I will also go through all of them
Sam Bruce Gavin Clayton Jeremy Phillip
Oliver Garret Jackson Ethan Hudson
trip Alex Kyle Dakota Cedric Travis DJ
Liam Mason Oscar Caleb
Ryan James William Utley walcker Noah
Zach Paul Peter Silas and Matthew so
that's all the names we have just let us
know what you guys think in the comments
and we will see you tomorrow yes mark
okay but that's literally like you know
like a school yeah it could be any
obviously that's not a big deal but I'm
saying could it turn into
