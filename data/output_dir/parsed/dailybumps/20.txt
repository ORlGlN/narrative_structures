Good morning!
Good morning, Finn.
- Meh!
(laughing)
- So we are headed off to a
doctor's appointment today.
We've been looking
forward to this doctor's
appointment for a little while now.
And I'm definitely hoping
for some good news.
Now I don't think we're gonna get
any like bad news necessarily.
But I'm just hoping for like good news.
I'm headed in right now, and I'll give you
more information on what we're doin'.
But we're almost late,
actually, so I gotta head in.
Really quick, I was kind
of rushing this morning
and I grabbed these shoes
and I figured they probably
were a little small, but
they're so small that we can't
even close this.
(laughing)
You've got little, chubby feet, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So, if you guys watched a few weeks ago,
we went to the hospital and
had his kidneys checked,
and we actually don't have
the results for that yet.
But now we are checking his heart.
And if you guys don't know,
it's the same kind of scenario.
He has an enlarged aortic valve.
It's just like slightly dilated.
It's not really like a big deal,
but we've just been keeping an eye on it.
We checked me and Bryan,
and we don't have any issues.
So we're just making sure that this one
doesn't have any issues.
(laughing)
Actually Ollie had it
when he was in my belly.
It ended up fixing itself before,
yeah, by the time he was born.
Finn just still has it,
and we need to make sure it's all better.
(upbeat music)
-  Look, look.
-  Look!
Smile.
- Picture time.
- Say cheese.
- Say cheese.
- Say, daddy, look how big I am.
-  Yeah.
-  It is givin' your arm a hug?
(laughing)
- Yeah it says, I love you.
(gentle music)
Finn, you did so good, huh?
Was that easy?
Yeah, you did so good.
He's literally a pro, guys.
He got a little impatient there
'cause it definitely took longer
than like when we did
the kidney ultrasound.
But overall, he did very, very good.
He mostly just like watched
a show, they got a movie on.
He watched YouTube and he did great.
He got comfy.
He took all his shoes and socks off even.
You're like let's get comfy, huh?
All right, we are out
and it went really good.
Normally his aortic valve, on a scale,
it was like considered like moderate.
But there hasn't been much of a change.
So because of the scale
changes with like his age
and all that, it's actually
now considered mild,
which is awesome.
So if his aortic valve just kind of like
stays the same and doesn't
really keep growing
at a faster rate than like that,
then we'll be fine.
But we're basically just watching that
it's not growing faster than he's growing
and getting too large.
Everything looks really, really awesome.
Yay!
So that is just really,
really good news to hear,
but I will say that, I
don't know about you guys,
but I have extreme anxiety
when it comes to ultrasounds.
Whenever I walk into a room
with an ultrasound machine,
I instantly, like I didn't
even feel it before I went
in there, but as soon as
I walk into that room,
my anxiety level just went whoosh.
And my heart starts
beating like really hard,
and obviously it's because of just like
past like situations that I've been in,
usually always involving a ultrasound.
It just kind of all comes back to like
my losses and any bad news has always come
from an ultrasound for me.
So I don't like ultrasounds.
But the really frustrating
part is that I already have
this like anxiety, but as soon as he put
the wand on his heart--
- Mm hmm.
- And he could see it, he
literally said, hmm that's weird.
(laughing)
- It's like, what the heck?
- And like did you--
- Yeah, I immediately, was just like
staring at the machine--
- What?
What's weird?
- Like the screen.
- I like, I mean
at this point, like I literally got hot.
Like literally, like I
felt like I was on fire.
My heart was beating.
I felt like I was gonna cry.
They're not allowed to say anything,
like as far as like if
something looks bad,
or good, or anything.
I don't know what he was saying was weird,
whether like his computer
screen was weird,
or his little wand was weird,
or something was actually
weird on the screen.
But like it just stressed me out
for the rest of the time.
I was totally freaking out.
Obviously it was nothing.
- There was nothing.
- It was literally nothing.
- It was like his wand
was being weird.
- Something was weird.
Something was weird, but not his heart.
Ultrasound techs need
to be extremely careful,
because even if you don't have my past,
I'm sure most parents
go into a room like that
scared of what they're gonna find out.
I just think they need to be so, so, so,
so, so, so careful.
Everything's fine though, so that's good.
(upbeat music)
- All right.
So we have been running around
all day, getting stuff done,
and now it's time to
do a little unplugging,
and play a card game.
So we got Mimi and Papa here,
and we are gonna have a
little family game day.
- Thank you so much Mattel
for sponsoring this video.
Today we are playing DOS by UNO.
- UNO is probably one of
our favorite card games,
so when we learnt they were launching DOS,
we had to try it out,
and I think it's gonna
be a regular on our game nights now.
- I know!
It's so fun!
- DOS is so easy to learn,
but Missy is pretty much the
game master in this family,
so I'm going to leave
it up to her to explain.
- So, like UNO, you must
match numbers and colors,
but doubles the fun with two cards
in the center instead of just one.
Players also match numbers first,
with an added bonus if
there's a match for color.
- And don't forget to yell DOS,
when you only have two
cards left in your head.
- DOS!
- Which I just forgot to do,
so now I have to pick up DOS cards.
- My favorite way to
unplug is playing games,
and we had so much fun playing DOS.
- DOS by UNO is available
at Target right now,
and we're also gonna
have a link down below
in the description for
you to check out more.
Oh, hey, guys!
- Hi.
- Say, hi, boys.
-  Hi!
- Finn did so good at his
appointment, I just heard.
Didn't you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
They are now snacking on some Pop-Tarts,
and I am taking both
the boys to swim class,
because it's time to
get our swim on, right?
-  Yeah.
- It's been one of those mornings
where I'm like rushing, rushing,
can't get anything done.
I didn't even eat breakfast today,
so I actually made myself a shake
in like my little blender bottle.
It's like a green one, and it's ...
Tastes interesting, but it will definitely
at least fill me up for breakfast.
'Cause you got to have breakfast.
Okay, come on!
(upbeat music)
(upbeat cheerful music)
Finn, you did so good!
Oh, you got a tattoo of a cow!
What does a cow sound make?
- Moo!
-  Good job!
You did so good, too, Ollie!
I'm so proud of you boys and your school,
your swim school.
- Yeah.
- Doing good.
Ollie actually begged to go
swimming in our pool today
this morning when he woke up,
and I was like, Well, you're in luck,
'cause you're going to swim school.
It's also still like 60 degrees out,
so it's probably not swimming time.
Not yet, but it's almost summer, right?
-  Yeah!
-  Finn, are
you excited for summer?
Yeah.
- I'm excited for summer.
-  Yeah, 'cause it's
gonna be your birthday!
Do you know how old you're going to be?
- Yeah, five!
-  Oh, one more,
there you go, five!
That's crazy!
- I'm gonna have a Harry Potter birthday!
-  You are?
- Yeah.
- He does want a Harry
Potter birthday right now.
We'll see if it changes
in a couple months or so,
but yeah, it's so crazy
that Ollie's gonna be five.
He has been in swim school
since he was six months old, you guys.
We are huge advocates for swim safety.
This is California.
It's hot.
Everyone's got a pool.
We have to teach our kids
to be safe around the pool,
so that's what we're doing.
That's what we're still doing.
Finn's still getting there.
He's uh, he's doin'
pretty good for his age.
I feel like Ollie was a
little bit more advanced,
but we'll see.
He almost floated on his back,
on his own the whole time.
A couple of times he got
a little water in his nose
and he got like upset,
but he tried it again.
He actually tried laying
on his back again,
so I was super proud of him.
These boys, I love my boys.
You guys are awesome.
Okay, you guys wanna go eat?
-  Yeah!
- All right, we are back,
and it is now lunchtime.
What are we eatin' Ollie?
- Mexican food!
- Yeah, the boys really
wanted quesadillas,
so I stopped at Del Taco
and got 'em quesadillas.
And check out what I'm eating!
This is actually a steamed pork bao bun.
I've never had one of these,
and I've always wanted them,
and I also got some sushi
'cause I've been craving sushi.
I have no idea how to eat this,
so please don't murder me in the comments
(laughing)
if I'm doing this wrong.
I'm just going to take
a bite like a sandwich.
(upbeat music)
Oh my gosh, it's so good!
It's like so fluffy.
- Wait, I want to
see what's in it.
- And it's got
roasted pork in it.
- Why is it smoke coming out of it?
- Smoke's comin' out because it's probably
just a little bit warm.
These are so good, you guys.
Nothing like eating a little sushi
in front of our fish.
(laughing)
Sorry, guys, I'm hungry.
I promise I will never eat
you guys, though, okay?
- You are funny dada.
-  Well, thanks!
- Hey, dada, what about
a marmalade quesadilla?
-  A marmalade quesadilla?
- Yeah.
- That's not one of the
craziest things I've ever heard.
I mean, would you still have the cheese?
- No.
-  No, so you
would take the cheese out?
- Yeah.
-  I think that
could be yummy, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Do you wanna try it?
- No.
- Maybe we should make one.
It's just tortillas and marmalade.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- I'm so excited!
- He's so funny.
These boys seriously love marmalade,
ever since they started
watching Paddington.
- Quesadillas!
-  So yeah, grab some tortillas.
We're gonna need those.
Here grab these ones, there we go.
And now we need the marmalade.
All right, let's see if
the marmalade is in here.
Marmalade, there it is!
-  There it is!
-  Strawberry marmalade?
- Yeah.
-  All right, so
we have our tortilla,
and we have our marmalade,
but one thing about quesadillas, Ollie,
is they're warm.
So maybe we should heat up
the tortilla a little bit,
and then put the cold
marmalade in the middle.
Would that be yummy?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
- This is going to be so cool!
- I know he is so excited,
and I'm like, yeah, sure,
I'll let you guys create
your own lunch masterpiece.
So we're just going to toss the tortilla
in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds.
How does that feel, Finn?
Is it hot?
- Hot.
-  Okay, all right, Ollie,
so now go ahead and scoop some marmalade
and put it right in the
middle of the tortilla.
- No.
- Finn's like, no, he's
eating a real quesadilla.
He's like, this, I'm not so sure about.
I think it's gonna be yummy.
- Yeah.
- Okay, put that in the middle.
There we go, and that
should honestly be plenty.
We'll just spread it around on this half
of the tortilla, okay?
-  Yeah.
-  Okay.
- This is going to be mine
because I really want to taste it.
(upbeat music)
- All right, we have our marmalade
on half of the quesadilla now.
I'm just going to flip that over,
and sandwich it together just like that.
Ollie's gettin' so excited!
(laughing)
Yeah, all right, I think we're gonna
try it in the microwave just a little bit.
- It's going to be so fun, guys!
(laughing)
- I don't think
I've ever let Ollie really do this,
create like his own lunch before,
so this should be pretty interesting.
- I never tried marmalade before.
- Well, you've tried marmalade
but you've definitely never
had a marmalade quesadilla, have you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and honestly, I
don't know if we should
really be calling it a quesadilla,
'cause there's no cheese.
Um, okay, things are still gettin' crazy!
Finn is about to dip his quesadilla
into the marmalade.
Go ahead, you can try it!
(upbeat music)
How is it?
- Good.
-  Do you like it?
- Yeah.
-  All right, let's cut up this
little marmalade
quesadilla for you, Ollie.
So it's easy to eat.
(gentle music)
All right, we have two quesadillas here.
We're got your traditional
one with cheese,
that Ollie's been eating.
And we have our marmalade quesadilla,
that he just invented all on his own, huh?
- Yeah.
- That's your first invention, dude!
Okay, let's give it a try.
Let's do the taste test.
(upbeat music)
-  Oh, there's
marmalade everywhere!
(laughing)
What do you think?
- Good.
-  You like it?
Oh, goodness, he's dripping
marmalade everywhere.
It's okay, Ollie.
We'll change your pants.
(laughing)
Here Finnie, you try
one, a bite, too, kay?
What do you think?
- Yay!
-  Is it good?
- Yay!
-  I'm not sure if it's good,
but it's very messy!
Do you like it?
- Mm hmm.
-  You definitely
like marmalade on tortillas?
That's awesome!
And you are now eating your own quesadilla
dipped in marmalade, yeah?
- So we're outside having
some fun family time,
and you have to see it's so cute.
Take him for a ride.
(laughing)
(peaceful music)
You guys are so cute!
Ollie, pull, pull!
We're just playing with the kids,
and they're being so cute.
Here, let's pull him this way,
and see if you can get him to turn.
What do you think of that Finn?
- Yeah.
- Good?
They are just so cute.
We're just havin' a fun time out here,
hanging out as a fam.
Hanging out with the
doggies and the chickens.
Oh, my gosh, you have a new.
He's trying to pull him on the bike.
I see.
(laughing)
That was just silly, huh?
And, go!
Go, Ollie, go!
(laughing)
I know, it's too hard.
You've got to push it with your hands.
Oh, already coming up
with crazy stunts, huh?
(gentle guitar music)
-  Look, you guys, we have fruit
in our fruit trees in our backyard!
That's so cool!
(upbeat music)
