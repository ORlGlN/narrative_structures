- Oli is sleepin' on the couch.
It's so cute.
(whispers) Sleepin' on the couch.
Finn brought 'em a car.
(happy instrumental music)
♫ Wherever you are
♫ That's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ This is home
♫ Just running around
you've never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight,
cuddlin' all I could saying
♫ I am home
♫ Home's wherever you're with me
- Good morning guys.
I just wanted to say a very
huge thank you to everyone
who has bought our brand new song, Tribe.
If you do not have it, link
down below in the description,
to go pick it up.
We've been having such a
blast dancing and singing
along to it.
We wanna see videos of
your guys' family dancing
and singing along to it too.
So, if you have any
videos, be sure to send 'em
to us on Twitter or Instagram.
I'm gonna try and do
something really cool with it.
I'm actually gonna be
in Hollywood all day.
My producer got tickets to
a private Harry Styles show,
and unfortunately, they do
not allow you to take pictures
or any videos.
I'm a little bummed that
I'm not gonna be able
to document it, but it's gonna
be a really fun experience,
and it's the first thing that I've done
with the Grammy Association,
so it'll be interesting
to sort of see what that all entails.
So I'm getting ready now, and
Missy has a very busy day,
with the boys, ahead of her.
- Alright guys, I can finally show you
one of my new obsessions.
I've been playing a ton on my iPad.
Of course Karma's obsessed with it too.
(giggles)
It is the Family Zoo app
which is a fun and exciting
match three game that you
can get on both your Android
and your iPhone.
So, big thank you to Family
Zoo for partnering with us
for this video.
So this is the first game
of it's kind, where you can
actually interact with exotic zoo pets.
Oh look at my tiger
playing with it's ball.
That's so cute!
It's so fun.
You actually get to collect
all different kinds of animals,
you get to decorate the zoo,
and they also have, like,
little mini-games that you can
play, which is so much fun.
So right now, I'm going
to actually be adding
a brand new lion to my zoo.
And by doing that, I'll
attract visitors, and in turn,
I will earn lots of tickets and coins.
That way, I can buy lots
of really cool stuff
to make my zoo look really
neat and really fun.
And I can even take a
photo of my zoo and share
my progress with all my Facebook friends.
So, if you guys wanna
download the Family Zoo game,
make sure you click the
link down in the description
and get a bonus of 300 coins.
Good morning boys.
- Yay!
- Where are we goin'?
- To CJ and Bailey's house!
- Yeah!
Today has been kind of a crazy morning.
We've already been out of the
house and I forgot the camera.
But actually, because I'm a
little behind schedule now,
I am actually going to take
the boys with me and Kelsey
to the gym, and then I'm gonna take Oli
to CJ and Bailey's, which
he's very, very excited about.
Good morning guys.
We have a fun day planned.
You're excited.
Finn's excited to hang out with Mama.
Let's do this.
Alright boys, go play.
See you in a little bit, okay?
Alright (laughs).
Me and Kelsey had a really good workout,
and now the boys are so excited
because they're at CJ and Bailey's.
Finn was literally hysterical in the car
because he just wanted out
so that he could see them.
And I parked and I had
to move parking spots,
and he about had a cow.
So, he's so excited that he's here.
Alright, I've officially
dropped off the boys
and they are so excited.
They are planning on going to
lunch and going to the park
and doing all kinds of fun stuff.
And they have four kids with them now.
It's CJ and Bailey and Oli and Finn.
So I let them borrow my car
so they can do all those
errands and stuff.
And me and Kelsey are now hangin' out.
But I am so bummed right now, you guys.
I'm vlogging on my
phone, if you can't tell.
And this is our camera, which,
I mean, admit it guys, these
things can be really expensive.
And (laughs) as you can
tell, if you can't tell,
I, basically, I broke it.
It is completely broken.
It will not turn on, it will not turn--
And I drop these a lot, and it's so bad.
I'm just really clumsy
and I tend to be the one
that always drops them.
But I've never dropped it
and it broke like this.
But when I dropped it, I knew.
I was like, "That dropped hard."
Like it hit hard (giggles).
- You could hear it
from the other side.
- Yeah, I was like, "Oh shoot, that's no."
- You had to do it that way.
(giggles)
- And I'm tryin' to turn
it on and it's just like,
doing that.
I'm so bummed.
Bryan's gonna be so bummed.
I can't even turn it off.
Like, that's all it does.
I can't even get it to close.
So, it's a super bummer.
You guys, I'm home and I
am back on a normal camera.
I was able to find this one.
It's one of our older ones.
We've kind of retired it,
but it's basically all I have
at this point.
It is really hard to vlog on a cell phone.
Like super duper hard.
So for those of you vloggers
who do vlog on a cell phone,
whew!
One day, life's gonna
get really sweet when you
can use a camera.
It's just so much easier to
like flip around and it's wider,
so you can hold it out and I don't know.
Just looks a lot nicer.
Anyways, we are home now.
Oli is sleepin' on the couch.
It's so cute.
(whispers) Sleepin' on the couch.
Finn brought 'em a car.
Shh!
Can you say shh?
- Shh.
(laughs)
- I put the shades down and
I'm like, "Ha, I'm exhausted."
It has been a very busy day, honestly.
My day is basically over now, I would say.
It's not over, but it just feels like huh,
it's been a long day.
But it's not over yet, actually.
Kelsey and Corbin are
headed over soon to hang out
and go swimming.
Bryan is out tonight.
He's going to LA to have a
ton of fun, I'm super jealous,
and happy for him that
he gets to go out and do
some fun stuff.
Finn brought him a little
blankie and a bear,
and a car right by his face.
Me and the boys have been
just hanging out, relaxin'.
Pretty exhausted from all the
running around we did today.
And now, Kelsey and Corbin are over.
We're goin' swimmin'!
The boys are so excited.
June's excited.
How's the water Oli?
- It's warm.
-  Okay, jump in!
- Now it's cold.
-  What?
(laughing)
Are you scared?
- Yeah.
-  So it turns out
it's kind of a cold day.
So Oli's gettin' in the hot tub.
How's that feel?
Is it good?
And it's low, you can stand up, huh?
I might need to fill that up.
Finley Jay, what are you doin'?
You want a boat for you?
- Yeah.
- Just like Junie?
Alright, let's go see.
So June is in the hot
tub in her little boat,
and Finn literally jumped
out, ran to the little box,
grabbed this, and I'm pretty
sure he wants to sit in it
next to June.
It's pretty cute.
He's like, "I'm comin' in."
Alright, we are back
in, and now we are going
to start making dinner.
Me and Kelsey have big plans tonight.
Bryan's not here, so it's all
up to us to figure it out.
- I don't know if we can do this.
-  I know (laughs).
- We do not cook in the kitchen that much.
(Missy laughing)
- So we're gonna go ahead
and make a delicious
homemade meal.
Let's do it.
(happy instrumental music)
-  How's it going?
- Uh good.
It's a little burnt, you know.
-  Oh that looks beautiful.
- Right?
(laughing)
(happy instrumental music)
Alright, dinner is ready and
we like, did this all together.
I think it's good.
Okay?
We've got green beans.
(laughing)
-  Oops, a little brown.
-  A little over cooked pasta,
(laughing)
and chicken.
Hopefully it's seasoned correctly.
Bryan always thinks I season
it like really boring.
So, we'll see.
- It's gonna be great.
- We're excited, we're ready to eat.
We're starving.
But we made dinner.
Yay!
Alright, dinner's done.
It looks good.
How is it?
- It's so good.
- Yay!
- Woo!
-  The seasoning's good?
- Oh yeah.
-  Okay, test out the green beans.
- Green beans?
- I tasted them.
They're like meh.
(laughing)
- They're okay.
(laughing)
Now I'll taste the pasta.
Pasta's good.
- Yay!
We did good.
We're like professionals now.
- Oh yeah.
- Chefs.
- Alright, the boys are all ready for bed.
They ate their dinner,
they brushed their teeth,
they're clean.
Huh?
And we're ready for bed, huh bud?
Actually, my battery's
about to die, so I did want
to let you guys know that
if you wanna see me cook
something else really fun and crazy,
make sure you go check
out my sister channel.
I'll have it linked up above.
We made awesome emoji stuff.
I gotta say, at the beginning,
it was a little rough,
but towards the end, I become
a genius at pancake art.
And I'm really proud of myself.
So please go check out
our channel, go subscribe,
and go laugh, because it's
pretty fun and hilarious.
But for now, I'm gonna go
ahead and put these kiddos
to bed.
We are missing Bryan a lot tonight.
Are you missing daddy?
Yeah.
It kinda made him sad just now.
But we're gonna see him in the
morning, and we're excited.
Anyways, for now, give
this video a big thumbs up.
Hey Oli, thumbs up!
Oh, Finn, a thumb's up!
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Alright Oli, say,
- Bye!
- Bye!
-  Good job.
- Bye poohba.
(happy instrumental music)
