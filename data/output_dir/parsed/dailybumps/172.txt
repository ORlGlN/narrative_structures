(spooky music)
- Boo!
- Boo!
All right boys, it is pumpkin
decorating time, you ready?
(happy screams)
(laughing)
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

♫ Take this shooter, we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

- Good morning guys, and
welcome to today's vlog.
Today is an exciting day, because
we are finally getting out new fish tank.
You guys excited to get a new tank?
-  Yeah!
-  It'll be so cool, huh.
Where should we put it, Ollie?
-  Um, we should
put it right there.
- Yeah, I think that's
what we were thinking, too.
And, it's perfect for a fish tank,
and it is central to our house.
- Yeah, I--
- Might be a good idea.
- The only rea--
We wanted it where we're gonna enjoy it,
and so obviously, living
room, kitchen, would be ideal,
and if we do have it there--
-  Mm hm.
- It's kind of noisy and
kind of bright all the time.
- Yeah, this fish tank
that we're getting is
kind of loud, 'cause it
has to move a lot of water,
like every hour, and it's really bright
because we're gonna be
growing an actual reef in it.
You guys, it's gonna be so cool.
So, we're thinking this
is a good location.
We cleared out this spot a little,
moved that table over there.
- It's not like we watch TV.
-  Yeah.
- But we get to still enjoy
it, we're always in this area.
-  Totally.
- There's a lot of natural
light for the fish, it's cool.
It is a beautiful Saturday morning guys.
Actually woke up not feeling the best,
but I'm feeling a lot better
now that I got some medicine.
And so we are playing
outside. (kid grunting)
Huh, Finny?
Whoo!
Are you playing soccer?
Kick that ball, you kick it, whoo!
- Ah!
(laughing)
- And the puppy dogs are out,
and they're ready to play.
Come here Karma, hi boy.
Hi, Lenna Lou. (dog barking)
Hi Lenna Lou.
We don't know, Luna is
actually in heat right nowm
which, kind of a bummer
'cause we meant to get her
spayed before that, but now
we're just waiting for her
to be done being in heat, and I swear
it feels like she's been
in heat for two weeks now.
So, as soon as she's done being in heat,
we're gonna get her fixed.
That way, no dogs come
smelling around here
to try and get her pregnant.
We don't need any more puppy dogs.
Oh my goodness, this got left open.
Wonder how that's open.
Hello, how are my chickens,
I haven't shown you guys in a while.
Come on out, here they
are, how are my chickens?
Oh, I've got eggs, even.
That makes me a happy chicken momma.
Everyone's good though,
everyone's a happy chicken?
Happy chicken, happy mom. (laughing)
You guys, I have so many
chickens. (laughing)
We are having a little bit of
grass issues right over here,
so we've got all kinds of torn up dirt
and a little temporary
fence so that the dogs don't
go over there, and super bummer,
because we just got all
this new grass put in,
but the system that we put in and use
just did not end up working.
So, now they had rip that all out
and out in new sprinklers system,
and that's been kind
of annoying. (laughing)
Let's go put out eggs inside, kay?
- Yeah.
- Mm, kay.
-  Check it out, your guys,
we got coral in the house.
And this is my buddy from
Fish Frenzy, hooking it up
with the red sea reefer, you guys.
What are you doing in here?
- Right now, we're
putting in the live sand
and the live rock so we can
get the whole system going.
Sand's outta Fiji.
-  So, this sand is actually alive?
- Yeah, it's actually alive,
it's got all the bacteria
to support--
-  Oh my gosh.
-  All the fish and organisms
that are gonna live in here.
-  That is so cool.
- It's live rock.
-  So, you're
just placing that rock
on top of each other and seeing
how it balances and stuff?
- Yeah, want a lot of
good spots for the fish
to swim around and have really
interesting places to hide.
-  That's super
cool, that's super cool.
And, you were just telling me
you have on your Instagram,
you show off all your stuff right?
- Yep, right.
-  So, let people
know where they can find you.
- Bansplace is my Instagram.
-  OK, cool.
- All my fish and corals and tanks and...
- Dude, right on.
This is starting to
come together, you guys.
(upbeat music)
So, we got the professional
set up the fish tank right now
and we decided to put
it in the kitchen area
because we actually had them move it
in the foyer and it was so crammed.
I did not realize how big it is.
- Yeah, it didn't look good,
and he did confirm that
it's very, very, silent.
-  Yeah.
- You can't really hear
anything, and even the light
won't be reflecting off anything.
- Yeah, the light is like,
it's like smart lighting,
so it's on a schedule, too.
It turns on at night when
they need it and stuff.
All the coral's in, now just
filling it you with water.
Check this out, they boys
have been so good today,
They have been, seriously,
on their best behavior.
Ollie is eating lunch
and watching a movie.
You watching Boss Baby?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, Finn's asleep.
You're being a good
brother letting him sleep.
- Yeah, and can you put
Super Hero Girls on?
-  Sure.
Mm, so precious, oh.
He needed a nap today, he looks co comfy.
(laughing)
(gentle music)
Here it comes.
-  Start it up, man.
(water splashing)
-  Whoa! (laughing)
There we go, guys.
It has begun.
(upbeat music)
- Fish tank.
- Fish tank!
It's all set up, what do you think, Ollie?
- Um, good.
- You think it's really cool?
It's really cool, so we
have the rock in there,
the sand in there, it is
cleaning it all out right now,
so it's gonna be a little
bot hard to see anything.
Hopefully by tonight or tomorrow morning
it'll all be nice and
clear and you can see.
You can kinda see, it's
kinda peeking through.
It's still a little dirty,
it's doing its work.
We also hung two of those plants up here,
and I'm thinking these might
actually grow really well
because of these UV lights.
So, it might be interesting
to see how those plants do
right above it.
Now that we have the
fish tank all hooked up,
we can actually pick up
fish in a couple of days.
So, we'll probably, middle
of next week just gonna
pick up one or two fish and
acclimate them to the tank
and just make sure that everything
is running smoothly with that.
We get to pick out some
fish in a couple days, OK?
- Yeah.
-  You excited?
- Yeah, I work out.
-  You do work out?
- Yeah.
-  Show me, show
me your work out regimen
right here, you ready, babe?
-  One.
Two. (laughing)
Three.
Five.
-  Kinda missed four.
- Four.
-  (laughing)
There's four, he did four.
- Three.
-  (laughing)
He's going backwards now.
- Five.
-  (laughing) Oh.
-  Six.
-  Bro, you are
working those arm muscles,
aren't you?
- Yeah.
-  Should we get you
an Apple watch like Momma?
You can track your fitness.
-  Keep track of all your pushups.
(laughing)
-  It's almost October,
should we go get some pumpkins?
- Yeah.
(spooky music)
- Boo!
- Boo!
All right boys, it is
pumpkin decorating time,
you ready?
(happy yells)
(laughing)
- So, since it is the first
of October for you guys,
we thought we would do a little
early pumpkin decorating.
We're not gonna be doing any carving.
That's probably a little closer
towards the end of the month,
but we are gonna decorate these pumpkins.
- Watch this, guys. (growls)
-  Oh are you eating the pumpkin?
Oh, you're eating the
pumpkin, too? (laughing)
- We picked up these super
easy decorating kits,
which are perfect for
boys, especially our age.
We are really excited, we've got BB-8.
-  Yes!
-  Nice.
- Who is this?
-  Chase.
-  Chase from Paw Patrol.
- Yeah, and who's this?
-  Marshall.
-  Marshall, he puts out the fires.
- There's no cutting involved,
they just have little sticks.
-  Totally.
- Yeah, we're gonna
transform our pumpkins.
- Yes, and no, we are not sponsored.
These are just really cool
ways to decorate your pumpkin.
They've been doing these for like--
-  They're the best!
-  For like six or seven years now.
- Which one do you want to do?
- Um.
- BB-8?
-  You want to do BB-8, nice dude.
- And Finn, which one do you want to do?
-  I know how to open it.
- Chase or Marshall?
- Yeah.
-  Al right, Momma's doing Chase.
-  Yeah.
-  Rip it open, rip 'em open.
All right Ollie, here
are BB-8's shield plates.
All you gotta do is put
those on the side of
your pumpkin.
(growling)
-  Push it in hard.
(grunting)
-  Nice.
See, so they have a little pegs on it,
and they just stick
right into the pumpkin.
That's so cool, huh?
- Yeah.
-  All right, put
other shield plate on, Ollie.
- Push it in, baby.
-  Push it in.
(grunting)
-  Use those strong muscles.
-  That was awesome.
-  Good job, and
now he needs his head.
Where's his head at?
Oh, I found it, found
BB-8's head. (laughing)
Let's put his head, how about right there?
Is that cool?
- Yeah.
-  All right, push
it in, there it goes.
Push it on all the way, dude.
Nice.
- Good job.
-  Dude, look at your BB-8 pumpkin.
Isn't that so cool?
(laughing)
-  That's pretty cool.
-  Oh, Finn is Marshall. (laughing)
He's ready to decorate.
- I got that stinky.
-  Yeah, so with Marshall, we have
front paws, and we have back paws,
and then we have his head.
You want to put it together, Finn?
-  Can you out his head right here?
- Oh, I'm a baby, eh?
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
-  Marshall's gotta have his legs
so he can run super fast to the fire.
(upbeat music)
- Boo!
-  Whoa!
You scared me. (laughing)
These boys are getting in
the Halloween spirit already.
Uh uh, where's Finn?
- Boo!
-  Whoa.
- So cute.
-  There's Chase.
(laughing)
Now that they're all
decorated, you can swap out
body parts.
- Ooh.
-  Wouldn't that be funny?
So Chase can have Chase's legs, oh,
and can have BB-8's head.
- Oh my goodness.
-  Isn't that funny?
-  Yes.
-  You want to swap some more?
- Put this one on.
-  It's a BB Chase.
-  A BB Chase, that's so weird.
What else can we swap?
Look what Momma did, Ollie,
she swapped their legs.
- (laughing) Isn't that silly?
(laughing)
-  Here, let's replace
one of Chase's Marshall
plates, there we go.
Oh yeah, and then we can out
BB-8's plate right there.
Things are all getting mixed
up right here you guys.
I don't know if any of
these pumpkins are right.
-  Hey Ollie, do you
know how to fix all these?
-  Can you fix
these pumpkins, Ollie?
- Hmm.
-  Hmm, can you?
All right, out 'em all back to normal.
(grunting)
Oh! (laughing)
- Ollie, it's OK.
-  So where does the B-8 head go?
That one, yeah, we'll
take Chase's head off.
(grunting)
And then out BB-8's
head back on, good job.
That doesn't go there?
What goes there?
(grunting)
There you go, yeah,
you're getting it, dude.
- It's like a puzzle, it's so cute.
-  I know, Ollie, you did BB-8.
God job, buddy.
So, that one's Marshall.
So, you gotta grab Marshall's legs
off this pumpkin, put 'em on there.
There you go. (laughing)
- That's so cute.
-  I know, we
turned it into a fun little
mix up activity, there you go, dude.
Now you gotta put Marshall back--
Or put Chase back together
so that Chase can go on the case, huh?
- Yup, Chase is on the case!
-  Yeah, now put his head on.
There we go, now we got out
pumpkins all back to normal.
Thanks, Ollie.
(grunting)
(beeping and booping)
Chase is on the case.
What does Marshall say?
Marshall, let's get fired up, right?
Good job boys.
That was some good pumpkin decorating.
(spooky music)
- All right, we're out
for a little family walk.
Finn's on my back, and
Ollie's running around here.
I wanted to show you
something super, super cute.
-  It's really cool.
- You guys are gonna die.
Look who's coming with us. (laughing)
Jimmy wanted to bring her
but she's kinda skittish
around the kids and all of us.
She is so cute.
-  Once she
starts hearing the kids,
she's like--
-  She's like, I'm
just gonna go hide over here.
-  Can I just go the opposite way?
-  Dang it.
-  Imma bring my kitty cat.
-  OK, that's a good idea.
-  Kitty, kitty, kitty.
-  He's just like a kitty cat, too.
(laughing)
Hi, so what do you think
about going on a walk?
- Uh, think he says, not today.
-  Nah, no thank you.
-  He's finally just
walking around the house.
- Yeah, yeah.
They're still working and
practicing their walks.
Maybe next time, Zuri.
Yeah, we really wanted
her to come with us,
it was part of the plan, but she ended up
no loving the walk
'cause of all the people.
(upbeat music)
-  Dude, I didn't
know you could do that.
- I know it, it was a magic trick.
-  That's pretty good.
(upbeat music)
Look at this dinosaur sculpture
in this person's backyard you guys.
I'm gonna see if Ollie can see it.
Looks so cool. (laughing)
- What is that?
-  What is it, right there?
-  Do you see it?
-  With the light on it.
- A, a, a dinosaur?
-  Yeah, what
kind of dinosaur is that,
you know.
- I think it's a Ranna-saurus.
-  No.
- It's a Tri-ranna-saurus.
-  No, it's a Spine-a-saurus.
-  Spine-a-saurus.
Isn't that so cool?
Think it's time we get a
dinosaur sculpture, you guys.
(upbeat music)
The boys are doing their
evening workout with Momma.
(laughing)
So, cute, get fired up, get fired up.
Burn all that energy before bed.
-  They like the high kicks.
-  They like the
high kicks. (laughing)
Look at you babe.
(grunting) (laughing)
- Trying to finish out my circle.
Almost done.
-  And you two, you
guys are trying to finish
your activity circles?
(laughing)
- Thanks for watching.
(grunting)
Give this video a thumb's up.
Ascribing you new, see you later.
- I did it.
- Bye.
- Momma did it, be sure to
leave a comment down below
with what you guys are gonna
decorate your pumpkin as
this Halloween, and
