- So, today we decided we would do
a really fun project with the boys.
Look at that!
-  Ollie, what does that look like?
- Um, a bath bomb.
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said,
♫ "This is home"
♫ Just running around,
you've never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight,
cuddling all I could, saying
♫ "I am home"
♫ Home's wherever you're with me
- Mo mo.
- Morning.
-  Good morning, Finn.
-  We go to Starbucks.
(laughter)
-  Oh, you're so funny.
- Here you go, Finn.
-  Ah, you got
a chocolate milk, too.
- Thank you, Ollie.
- I got one of them, too, Finn.
- Good morning, guys,
and welcome today's vlog.
This morning none of us wanted to cook
and we didn't want to go out.
We just wanted to go to Starbucks.
So we got drinks and
snacks from Starbucks.
Hey, Finn, don't push the button.
Don't push it, don't push it!
Oh, you pushed it!
- I push my button.
- Don't push your button.
Oh, no, he pushed his button, too.
(bright electronic music)
PSL, thank you!
You guys, first pumpkin
spice latte of the season.
- Alright, boys, we've dropped off Daddy.
I actually took him home
to get some work done.
He really, really needs to get stuff done.
We're just going to go ahead
and do our errands without him today.
Does that sound good,
hanging out with Mama?
- Yeah!
- Today, we thought it would be really fun
to make Ollie homemade bath bombs.
- Yay!
- Does that sound fun?
Ollie loves bath bombs so I found a recipe
that's exactly what Lush uses
and so we thought that would be super fun
because the boys both love bath bombs,
me and Bryan love bath bombs,
and we're actually out of
all of our Lush bath bombs,
so let's make some of our own, okay?
-  Yeah.
- So let's go shopping.
Some people get overwhelmed
in different stores,
whether it's like guys for Home Depot.
Some girls get overwhelmed
with makeup stores.
I get overwhelmed at Joann's
or any kind of craft store
because I just want to do everything.
Like, I want to make
crafts, I want to sew,
I want to knit, I want to do everything.
And when I do it, when
I go into these places,
I'm like, "Let's buy it all!"
So I have to be really careful.
- It's Halloween stuff!
- Let's buy it all.
Oh my gosh, I'm dying.
I just tried to FaceTime Bryan
because everything is so cute
and I want him to see it all.
Look at this!
Look at this, that's a
little raccoon wreath.
And an owl, are you kidding me?
Ollie really wants the scorpion skeleton.
And Finn's like, "Let me
go look at everything."
Why are you guys so stinking cute?
- Scorpion!
- Yeah.
Ollie got a little scorpion at Joann's
and they actually didn't have anything
for bath bombs there, but I did get a few,
just a couple little fall decorations.
We still have to go to Michael's now,
or somewhere else to get
stuff for bath bombs.
So, I was able to find a few things
at the local organic store we have.
We still need the mold,
so I'll still go by Michael's
to get the rest of the stuff.
We just got out of Michael's,
and I was seriously thinking that
they would have everything
to make bath bombs
and they had almost nothing.
I luckily found a few molds
that I'm excited to use with the boys.
They really didn't have much.
I'm glad I stopped at the organic store
and grabbed those little ingredients.
These boys are ready to
go home, Finn is done.
Alright, let's go.
- So, today we decided we would do
a really fun project with the boys.
- Yep, they're super excited.
- We got all our stuff laid out
and we are going to make DIY bath bombs.
- Yay, I got tons of molds.
- How cool is that?
- Which I'm really excited about.
-  Yeah, we have molds
and we have all the different
ingredients you need,
like Epsom salt and citric acid and--
-  Baking soda.
-  Baking soda and
lots of colors and stuff.
(light music)
-  Alright, Ollie,
tell me what you think about this smell.
- Eww!
- You don't like it?
-  It smells like oranges.
Does it smell like oranges?
Yeah!
Okay, let's try this one next.
-  Oh, he'd love this one.
Tell me what smell this one is, Ollie.
- Lavender.
- Yeah.
- Alright, Finn, smell this.
Tell me what you think.
What do you think?
Does it smell good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Alright, we are attempting
the color pink for this one.
-  Okay, here we go.
-  Let's see if it works.
And then we start whisking.
-  Ah, that's pretty.
-  It made a pretty pink.
Look at that, it worked, babe.
-  Yay!
It smells very lavender-y.
Alright, what's this one?
- We are doing blue next.
-  Oh wow.
-  I don't know.
-  We'll see, we'll see.
- Wow, it's fizzy.
- It bubbles.
-  I like that blue,
I think it looks good!
-  Yeah, that's a good blue.
-  It's definitely
a brilliant blue.
Ooh, now we've got some yellow!
That looks awesome, I like that a lot.
- Alright, this next color
we're doing is brown,
and I'm not sure if it's gonna turn out
but we'll see, but we
actually wanted to do one
that actually looks like a poop emoji.
(laughter)
-  So let's try it.
-  Oh my gosh, if that
works that'll be so weird.
Ew, it actually is working!
-  Look at that!
-  Ollie, what does that look like?
- Um, a bath bomb.
-  Alright, now
that we have all of our
beautiful colors, and our brown,
we're gonna start filling this mold.
Our bath bombs are gonna
be more like bath poops.
(laughter)
But that's okay!
Yeah, this is so cool.
We're using Rosanna
Pansino's poop emoji mold.
- I'm waiting for bath bombs!
(playful music)
- Alright, so I am doing a brown one
that's actually gonna
look like a poop emoji.
But then, when the kids
put it in the bath,
it'll have a burst of color.
-  It'll be interesting
what the water ends up looking like, too,
with the brown and all the colors.
-  It might look gross.
-  It's gonna look black!
Blue, pink, it's actually really fun.
We should make a business out of this.
- I know, right?
Designing bath bombs.
This is actually gonna be really cool
because it's gonna make, like, green.
The blue and yellow are gonna make green
when they get squished together.
And then you have the purple, look at that
little burst of color
that they're gonna make.
-  Yeah, that's cool.
-  Alright, we are all done
making you boys bath bombs,
but before we use them
we gotta let them dry, okay?
So what are we gonna do now?
- Pick an animal to sleep.
-  An animal to
sleep with at preschool?
- Yeah!
-  Alright.
- Alright, I've gone around the room
and he brought home his
monkey the other day
because he wanted to
snuggle with it at home,
but I really want one to stay there.
So I'm going to give him
a bunch to choose from;
he can choose one for at home
and choose one for school.
So here we go.
-  You ready, Ollie?
- Yes.
- So this is for at preschool, okay?
We've got the very huggable bear.
(clapping)
We've got the always friendly Mr. Fox,
he's been around since
the day you were born.
Alright, we've got the
adorable Mrs. Bambi,
I mean, she is soft,
snuggly, and adorable.
-  Ooh, that is a good one!
- We've got the very cute
and scary shark, Mr. Shark.
We've got the always reliable Mr. Monkey.
-  Give it up for Mr. Monkey!
- And the very cute Mrs. Fox,
similar to this one, but pretty cute.
(family clapping)
-  That is a hard choice, Ollie.
Drum roll, please.
- Which one do you want
to snuggle with at school?
- Um, the monkey!
- The monkey wins, yay!
Alright, so we're gonna keep
Mr. Monkey at school, okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay, now you get to choose one...
-  Which one do you
want to snuggle with right now?
-  ...to snuggle
with at home when you sleep.
- The yellow one!
- Which one? Show me.
- The yellow one.
- He thinks he's yellow,
this is orange remember?
It's kind of like this one.
(Finn squealing)
-  Finn did not
think that one should win.
- What do you want to call him?
- Bunga.
- Bunga? Okay, Binga Bunga.
-  Alright Finn, take a break
from eating your macaroni and cheese.
You've gotta choose one too.
He's like, "Let me show
you, let me show you".
Which one do you choose, buddy?
-  This one?
-  That one's the
best, look at that smile.
-  He's like, "I like all of them".
-  Ooh, wait a minute.
-  Can you give him a hug?
He's like, "I have to
hug them all to see".
-  Yeah, gotta
test out each hug score.
-  Aw, he's scary but he--
- The hug score was
considered for this decision.
- Oh, he didn't test this one out; hug it!
-  How's it feel? Nah.
- Mr. Bambi wins, that is so cute.
-  That is so cute.
Alright, boys, now that you've
chosen your stuffed
animals, eat your dinner
because bath time is
gonna be super special;
we're gonna use our new bath bombs.
You ready?
- Yeah!
- Finn, could I hug that?
- Aww!
- Aww!
-  That one's a
pretty cool one, huh?
(fun electronic music)
- Bath bomb time!
- Bath bomb time, that is right!
The boys are taking a bath tonight
and our bath bombs are finally dry
so we are going to pop them out,
see what they look like;
hopefully they turned out
because we worked really hard on them.
They smell really, really good.
I'm really excited to see
what they all look like.
Alright, we are popping
out our bath bomb molds.
-  I am so scared.
-  I know, I hope they turned out.
- Oh, one came out!
Oh my gosh, they look amazing!
-  What!
We did it, you guys, oh my goodness!
You guys, these ones
seriously look like poop.
Those ones look like poop.
- They look nasty, actually.
-  I know, that is so cool!
I cannot believe these turned out.
- This one looks so cool,
too, like the way it swirls.
- Yeah, and we used Rosanna Pansino's
new baking line for her poop emoji molds
to make them, and I
think that's the reason
they turned out so
good, so thank you Rose.
And you guys should all
send this video to her
to let her know how our
bath bombs turned out.
- Yeah, you better believe I'm making
some delicious poop cupcakes next.
-  Alright boys, we are gonna
put in the very first one.
This is a unicorn poop bath bomb.
-  Okay, does it
smell like unicorn poop?
-  Wow, let it go Finn.
Let's let it fizzle, look at it go!
We made a bath bomb,
you boys, and it worked!
What does it smell like, Ollie?
- It smells like...
-  Oranges?
- Oranges, yeah!
- It smells like all the
smells mixed together!
- And it actually didn't make the water
as dark as I feel like the Lush ones do.
Next one coming in.
Wow, the bath bomb is going!
-  That looks awesome.
-  That is so cool, too, whoa!
Alright, it is now time for the poop one.
You guys remember I was a poop
emoji a couple of blogs ago,
I'll have it in the iCard above.
So now I've made a poop emoji bath bomb,
and I think these boys are in for
a little surprise of what's inside.
This one's just a brown poop,
you wanna see what the
brown poop turns into?
Wow, it's brown!
Ew!
What!?
That looks so gross, that
looks so gross, you guys.
-  Get out of the
tub, there's poop in it!
-  Where'd all the cool color go
that was inside of it?
The brown just overtaked everything.
Alright, let's grab another one!
Oh my god, why does it look so gross?
That is the grossest bath bomb.
- Oh, there's all the color!
-  There's some color.
Alright, let's do this one.
Missy made some other bath
bombs things, oh, there it is.
Look at that pumpkin, that's so cute!
Maybe that will turn the
color a little better.
(upbeat music)
They're gonna be very oily.
That water, though,
doesn't look the greatest.
-  Alright boys, you're bathed,
teeth are brushed, you're jammies are on,
you're matching, and you look so cute.
Are you ready for school tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Alright, and Karma's like,
"Hey, can you see me?
"Do you see me right here?"
Give the video a big thumbs
up if you enjoyed it.
And we'll see you guys
tomorrow, what do you say?
- Bye!
(cheerful music)
