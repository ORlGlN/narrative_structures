I remember just feeling how much heat
there was I want to end it forever I
didn't know how I was gonna do that yet
but I knew that I was gonna come up with
some way creating a following for her
positive message to young girl where do
you get your bows they are awesome
my mother makes them oh how do you made
it to the quarters we made a show this
is high - lets you famous go to shop but
something that is really really cool
about my giveaways that's different from
a lot of people is that my giveaways are
huge prizes like as big as this whole
store this stores in the beginning of
the story when I told you guys how much
hate there wasn't how I wanted to stop
it finally figured out how c18 errs if
you see where to go strong you powerful
if there's a bully or a hair in your
life you are going to build an imaginary
wall and say I can't hear you
I don't want to hear you it doesn't
matter I'm gonna go hang out with my
friends over here that like me he's out
haters Barnes and Noble on Saturday
signing copies of a new book
a candy store now for the final part my
mom owned a dance studio when I wasn't
born she's owned it for a long time it
feel like this would be a really good
time to tell you guys happy going out to
dinner with Miranda sings
I look like the bottom of the earth
right now and if you're wondering why
it's because it's late change over to
jail
apartment you are uncertain my mom
little desk slash office area I mean
everybody gets that way
