getting our stuff and it's like about
11:05 so we might be a couple minutes
late for rehearsal perhaps thank you all
so I made the chance you're going to try
to okay I have found a stick around me
to admit it like I can't get it off to
describing it absolutely okay is what
you got ten of all
okay so we've been in the car I got all
the two dinners in the biggest day was
getting the bags organized so like I
have them all down there and I got one
down there now I got to fill everything
so I got to put everything in every bag
my biggest fear right now is that I'm
going to miss a bag and then they're
going to have one left in the external
look back to Everett and plus my cell
phone I'm sorry I'm a shit but I'm gonna
get a little bag with that and that's
just subscribe gonna happen so that's
the beginning but I got one bag
cardboard back back there
paper bag because that has stuff in it
but I shouldn't have move up here what I
was doing this but I got all the two
leaders in so that's progress
but I just finished which is good Oh mom
don't let me forget over lunch I have to
edit not at it upload yesterday's vlog
this is good and then because I just
finished and it looks really good like
really full which is good there's a lot
of good stuff the hair and some very
intense because we got our shopping
portal block not like an actual shopping
cart like a shopping cart type thing and
it's in the back so then we didn't even
know that we had that but we ended up
getting the two leaders I don't know if
we saw them but they're deducted
excusing because
we had the shopping cart so we could
take the two meters once we figure out
we in the shopping cart
it was literally a free-for-all yeah
then I didn't realize me 15 minutes late
for practice but we come bearing tips we
become vain yet but I think it's gonna
be perfect yeah if you're late just
bring something and you'll be fine
well we're back in the car again bah

look at the place spin
I look at the way of thinking what else

little bit of good news in the world

in hiding muscles also too I'm a very
good news
or in there like big bottle six eight
twelve I like to be fine alright so
everybody is among three my mom did a
cake now we celebrate that we made
another month I want you to come look at
my cake and tell me what you think of it
it's torn hands are the only good on the
hand what flavor of cake did you get
white okay boom that good yeah did you
Dora Jitsu to George George George or
Dora the Explorer ah yeah now my cake
got well I'll know what every four
together oh my gosh this is just so much
reduction well she's pretty good my
groceries right now but I just can't
look at my slide for the fun of it and
what is this look at that that is crazy
make
boy it smells really good I'm going to
mix it together like I left this thing
in it it's like really cool I don't know
how to think about this I got mix it
together that'll be that I mix it
together and like not really much change
I mean it's like fluffy as you can see
and it's like garden it's like
stretchies but like not a lot change
like it's still not the best fun I've
ever made so I'm not to make a slime
factory though because I just got a
whole bunch of stuff and I'll show you
it and three - all right fine factory
made I got my bowl my spatula my find
that I just made the a low video I'm
bagging spoil assignment air dried clay
to make butter song I've never made it
before so I wanted to try it got pate
I got shaving cream and I got twenty
things of glue twenty things of seven
ounce glue so that is and it's like 725
so that's about that would be 70s
there'll be 140 then do about plus
another says then be a lot of ounces
like that's a lot so not to make some
slimes gonna make the first batch I'll
try just take normal fluffy so I'm a
little borax thank you um don't rise
make it focus on that first because we
can't go wrong fluffy show you know I
both not rather go try it I gotta clean
this thing off mmm okay so I basically
just finish this slime and it's actually
like one of my favorite signs that I've
ever made it's like the perfect amount
of stickiness like it's not too sticky
but it's also really like fluffy and
good to like look at this it like it
only focuses
there we go it like that it's like
SuperDuper stretchy I like doesn't
really like stick as I say that as it
sticks but like it's like really good
like I'm very proud of it and you can't
see the color it's literally this color
like it's really cool it's just the
colors like you can't see it at all but
it's okay it looks so good though I
don't know who I want to ruin this by
bring this in it cuz I don't know this
is very stuff but I'm just gonna do it
for the fun of it turn it about this why
did this do it try and fix it what just
happen okay well that was an epic
failure I'm going to try again Ashley
and I'm going to do the same thing I
just I think I'm going to add more borax
make sure to the thing so it'll be like
stronger I think the issue other wasn't
strong enough line so windows it q and
we're gonna do this so since I made this
pink slime and I was going to add the
clay to it but then it ended up really
good like look at this it's like it's
like really it's fine so I'm gonna make
another one and I'm going to make it not
so good and then I'm going to add two K
to that one like look at this like
literally it's like perfect it like
doesn't stick at all it's crazy I can't
even go again try to do the same thing
but epically failed I don't know why
it's so bad like I had I couldn't film
it right away because I literally had to
wash my hands before I could even touch
the camera I look at this it just makes
hot mess like how do you even like

satisfying knocking a lot okay you got
