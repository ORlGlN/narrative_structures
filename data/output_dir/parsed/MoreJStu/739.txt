are doing an Arabic treats sort of
challenge now you're wondering where I
got this my dad he travels a lot for his
job and recently he just got back from
the country
Jordan and he brought this little box
full of treats because he knows we like
doing challenges varitek
odd wait my wall and there's
numbers one two so yeah basically we
don't know what this is I don't even
know what to expect never try it air
babies you I don't think I have oh this
looks weird
oh look at this it looks like a bird's
nest or something yeah
why don't you try and say okay although
we we Julie you guys although are they
eyelash a my clothes don't I don't know
do what what is your guest does that
mean waiting them
it means try these they're very good I
think it says before warm we probably
don't like me that's what the Fox says
huh here this might be the girl I don't
I don't know okay sort of trying and
trying something get any better
this looks like there's like walk in
here I don't know what these are
definitely walk
huh
it's just like a weird pizza me doesn't
it bad this is the bird's nest of you I
don't want to try it
look look at best
it's like really rock the spaghetti
right not rocking just like cats yeah
it's not out for a couple days ketchup
lose that say something in Arabic go
well you never know it might be a word
oh I know that's not a word
so I'm Monica that's Mike who said ah oh
yeah what does that mean it means may
peace be with you just be with you
what's in here butter that's it just
pure butter
it tastes like a crust
really this is baklava eat oh they all
taste like it's gonna same thing oh
really why don't you be honest
ah that is so disrespectful the basic
gist of all these snacks are pistachios
cashew flour sugar starch butter and
pine so if you can imagine what that
tastes like
that's what it tastes like mainly the
pine like bees yeah I wouldn't really
want to be snacking on this at any point
of any day but the question is would you
rather have this or Japanese start in
treats okay oh this over Japanese
anything I'm Japanese snacks I don't
know what's up with what is going on
with those books but all right we're
back and to spice things up instead of
just having some but anyways of that
snacks there's some bugs one of you guys
one of you guys sent this to us in the
fan mail we are kind of disturbed but
now we're hungry so we have three
flavors of crickets what's yours
salt and vinegar sour cream and onion
and bacon and cheese
and then it's for some reason some
popsicle something I thought was a great
idea to put a bunch of hands in the
sucker Jeremy ah just greatest nice
crickets
well if insects and then insects can
cricket smell like animals and such like
it view for communities right tastes
like sunflower seeds this isn't taste
like anything said the worst part is the
crunch it will cook these cricket chef
Jim go gather all the crickets out in
the fan we're gonna cook them I don't
like bugs wanna ain't sucker to top
things off yeah hurry give me that I got
crickets in my mouth the impossible
oh just so you know there's a 142.2
calories in this point - yeah really
pretty much done with this sucker it's
kind of pointless yeah not gonna eat
this whole thing
plus the hand side you probably can't
see but he's coming out the top all
right well hello weird
crickets and Arabian snacks what we hope
you guys liked it and kept me
entertained
whatever we should do next it will be a
lot better than this I'm pretty sure
we're going to do the fire chili
challenge see you tomorrow bye
