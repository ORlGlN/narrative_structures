had flavors like I'm tasty
I don't even know how to describe this
you like it it's so interesting
next nillas came looking pretty fancy
yeah epic desert hasn't ever been so fun
and it is let's check the time 12 and it
was more like a three hour long dinner
but yeah I was just talking to the
others about this um I don't understand
some time I don't understand why some
like fine-dining restaurants price their
food so high because almost like a lot
of the fine-dining foods I've had aren't
really that good honestly they just make
the plates look like really nice and
they have exotic food names but I've had
a lot better food so it's just like kind
of confusing to me I don't know if you
guys I've had too much find out in food
but yeah if you try it someday you'll
probably understand what I mean but
otherwise the experience was super fun
we had a lot of good chats it was just a
good atmosphere overall it was a great
night for sure so I'm glad we
experienced that but we do fly out
tomorrow so we're gonna get some sleep
but we don't fly out until the evening I
hope to see you guys back here tomorrow
and stay happy cuz you can good bye
I've come to the conclusion that the
battery is dead leave the handyman has
figured that out so thanks for that
update yeah
