20 good friends having friends is so
important and it's also just extremely
important to surround yourself with good
friends that's the key guys good people

help make you better

also stick around when the hard times
come

yourself with good influences because
I'm telling you it is a key and it is so
important if you want to live a good
life are you ask yourself that and with
that I guess I'll end the vlog hope to
