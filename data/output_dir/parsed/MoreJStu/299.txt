what's up guys with my dev vlog welcome
today's gonna be super fun brought a
trampoline park and yeah whatever we're
at Springs trampoline park guys um we've
come here several times before they're
probably aren't definitely our favorite
trampoline place in town but wanna know
why we're here today
oh yeah well guess what they installed
something new a giant ninja course yes
so we can I trace on it Jeff we can set
times and compete oh man I don't know
Rick but I'm so ready
let's go worried I don't know if you

here's our user names but anyway you
might have seen that we did a 24-hour
video which it turned out awesome but
we're gonna upload that on Christmas Eve
the 24th see so 2420 bed yeah and it's
gonna be the finale to fort miss so it's
just gonna be perfect
other door oh I can already see it you
can look so thick where what it's like
American Ninja Warrior
they're like okay you guys remember
there used to be a dunk thing right here
oh yeah this is so fun
hurry it's go time
alright so before we do the obstacle
course right here we're gonna jump
around first
we got to get we got to get loose
stretch it out get ready for the course
what's that yes
we got to prepare for this obstacle
course got a deal maybe some slides and
flips these over here yeah like that
good practice Andrew go yeah he thinking
in trouble dad for some dunking and they
moved it over here
they added lights so cool girl go
ah you idiot
I gotta get a Dunkin
yes you still made it
yeah yes they still have bounce boards
but check out what I just saw backstage
oh wow wow it's like the snowboard the
heck it may be but look they added a
rope to so many new things
poink what
okay we got to kind of figure out how
this thing works so this is a start
bounce back and forth jump over wall
okay balance on the snake okay climb
over Mount Doom okay your detail yeah
but look on the other side as the Rings
that's ISO grips so you can choose
whichever one you want challenging side
yeah anyways whoa these pillars
climate off Oh
and then run up the wall and you win he
did it the one on the right is 12 feet
right yeah holy cow
dang oh man just explain the rule play
a bunch of helmet what exactly the rules
are there are so many rules but the gist
is yet to touch I can be obstacle so if
you get like halfway up the bars you can
swing
and if you can see up there all your
focus on the left side there's blue
there's yellow in the middle yellow is
easy blue is medium and red on the other
side is hard for the whole course whoa
we start off on yellow easy mode yeah
hopefully you just go through that
are you scared Marv are you great
I'm ready to compete on American Ninja
Warrior okay higher this man
ah
now swing swing
there we go is it Andrews go now let's
see it boss
well oh my goodness he just fell right
off I know yeah make sure your grips all
good he's warming up he's taking a swing
he studied eight in high school so he
may complete this course if he uses his
agility skills he's swinging is he gonna
make the jump I don't know what he's
doing holy crap back flop there is how
is he gonna do this folks let's watch as
Andrew performs his agility quest uh-oh
he's swinging whoa whoa we did it he has
done it oh my goodness folks he is in
amazing are the audience's he's moving
over to the last part of the course
grabbing the bounce swinging over oh he
almost dropped it he almost thought ah
and come on lad you can swing he did it
again
he touched come on swing you maniac I
think he kind of made it for the last
portion he just runs up jumps cuts it
and rings the bell
good job we're practicing the
challenging parts to see if we can even
do them way too hard
Andrews going to practice on the medium
style
yeah that's such a tricky one
Oh
