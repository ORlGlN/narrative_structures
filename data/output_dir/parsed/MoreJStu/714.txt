good morning everyone how's gallon check
it not a cloud in sight oh good the
screen all right
no no stay away from the edge all right
yeah
day one with the puppy or night one
what's the puppy how do you think it
went brick well there's a lot of coffee
yeah probably got up three four times
and had to let her out I was reading
stuff online saying you know dogs little
puppies will need to go to the bathroom
like every three hours or something
which is means little sleep so we're
pretty tired but it's worth it I think
it's just cool to be able to train her
and then once she's grown up we did that
I feel like we constantly have to watch
her because she's just well she's just
very curious right now like she thinks
that she can fit in there and she knows
that the Foods in here which I'm
thinking maybe we should hide the food
somewhere else but no no yeah very cute
yard yet yeah anyways me and Andrew are
gonna be doing a prank we're gonna
probably do the helium and the
drive-thru since our last helium video
helium prank we asked for 13,000 likes
in it we said we'd do it again if it got
that so that's what we have to do we're
doing the characters and all that's why
without here because I have a box of
costumes
oh my god that scared me Wow
I gotta show Andrew that
made it to Andrews Oh check out what's
in the box this is a party coming no
scared yeah that scared me when I opened
in I was just like that
yeah bit that I guess I did this creepy
mask no looking through the box to see
our different options here and I'm
trying to figure out the best look for
the smoking granny does this work sweet
hat what are you aah
Paul that's saying he looks like Amish
with that hat it's kind of like Benton
what nuts sprained my neck this morning
was still very painful if you can't go
how in bed just Oh how's Deena doing one
of these like a quickly turned the other
way and it just oh yeah I've had to
happen oh you need a hot Jacuzzi I think
we're all set up we have a bunch of
characters that we're gonna do I just
wrote down a list of them and this box
has so many but first we're gonna go to
the dollar store get some fake mustaches
and helium balloons definitely gonna
need that Dollar Tree damn looks like
it's storming out hopefully it doesn't
thunderstorm and rain over here though
what is this Wow item of the week

funny this one yeah this was a good cuz
I think that you tad they are $2.75 this
one these are a dollar yes become are we

guys yeah if you weren't go back and
watch the vlog now when we bought these
I was head of this wig in this hat when
we were there been quite well uh the
clouds outside right now it's just very
fighter like might be kind of hard to
see a camera but well not really
it's just like this sunset but it looks
like a fire that's really cool give
alright so we're holding off pranking
doing the drive helium prank till
tomorrow because right now it's
nighttime and we all be able to see
anything in the drive thru and that's
the point of this video we have all the
outfits and I start raining as well
which kind of dick book yeah but by the
way I'm wearing a wig
and what I want to say is we're at the
mall right now we both have outfits on
just because for no reason
sometimes just got a goof around just
for no reason I suppose just release
just look at this guy
hey guys we're here at our favorite shop
it's your move in the mouth we're
looking since we're not pranking we're
looking to do some fun science
experiments let's ask them science
experiments here here we are weird wacky
contraption lab now we need the OE GUI
using labs like I just turned around and
saw Andrew holding I thought it was a
real dog you should do that to somebody
it's okay yeah
hi my name is Frank
I'm Paul oh oh hi hi Casey yeah what are
we doing I don't know
put these dolls back okay but yeah I've
been really angry but what what why are
you sorry
you guys are so how's the day going guys
so great let's go on anybody doing good
yeah very good
come here I don't know I'm stuck in here
well see ya okay we're all out of dry
ice here it sucks we're King Soopers now
but what are we gonna do now or make a
volcano I guess so baking soda vinegar
now which makes a chemical reaction it's
science
we're doing two experiments this evening
the next experiment calls for oil Justin
has to drink this whole thing in under a
minute
Yeah right I would never do that
Boca Seltzer but this one's cheaper so
are you looking for gas axe no get this
one these are the same thing yes okay
it's half the price
all right we are home now time to begin
these experiments clear some room here
our first experiment is lava lamps
homemade lava box we got these bottles
because they're just really good for
like looking through and ethically yeah
step 1 fill the bottle with a little
over half of vegetable oil careful bill
I'm trying am i doing good so far
uh yeah just say stop when you say when
I say stop that's about right yeah yeah
now we got to put the rest with water
there we go all right we have our food
ice sound yeah ten drops good job very
difficult god you can see them little
represent no problem just watch them go
down to the end date
what the they fell through anyways next
step the alka-seltzer take one of the
pieces out and break it into four little
sections so half in half and you want to
drop them in one at a time because if
you drop them in all
it'll make it all cloudy all right we're
gonna turn the lights off for this is
strong cool or no yeah we'll try regular
first then strobe okay all right here we
go let's see how this does oh this is
what's changing colors what how I don't
know it's purple look at it go it's a
lava lamp I'm stuck at the bottom though
that's okay we're gonna roll it off
lights ah
denne denne denne denne denne denne whoa
it's a tornado of doom
she's a big color toy yeah that's sick
oh yeah that's creepy boys scream we're
doing all the bottles now ready fired
Wow this is science rules
whoa lava lamps this is scary mode whoa
this is like a lamp uh-huh
that's what it is highlight this would
be cool in your room at night
Oh now kryptonite whoa that seems like
Cynthia was trying to little blonde whoa
whoa whoa like I'm sorry so sweet
it's real-life science guys the way we
have all three of them lit your thing
gonna be sick to put this like around
the round anywhere I'm using a house you
would be the part yeah this is actually
a good party idea if you have a party
just set them around all right what's
the next experiment that's what I got
this I think it is probably done this
but
or but it's still in classic I can't
remember the correct proportions so
we're just going to test it out we're
going to use the red dye in vinegar to
make it look like the appearance over
never know what's the best way how much
so we're just trying that okay hopefully
this doesn't make the biggest mess ready
Oh interesting
let's try alka-seltzer in there man that
was nuts
Wow see bud Wow
round two of volcanoes we're taking it a
step bigger here we are and we got two
bottles blue and green fire
whoa oh my goodness that reacts
immediately yeah it does now we're doing
it the other way around
vinegar and first then baking powder
a very similar reaction almost identical
I'd say he wants to use this one outside
here we are outside we've got the
vinegar bottle or just gonna dump it in
there are we ready we are ready five
four three two one
yeah
that was epic the worst reaction
oh that's too high at least we tried
right yeah we are still learning things
give us more experiments in the comments
below what we should try because we
don't know any but we are experts so
yeah it's getting pretty late it's 10
p.m. now we hope you liked those
experiments I guess I'll see you
tomorrow
yep
