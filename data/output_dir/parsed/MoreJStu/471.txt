and I'm covering this up because this as
my information on it but I just got my
first check as an actor which means and
Andrew posted this earlier where me and
him are both professional actors now
since we got paid such a cool feeling
just thought I'd say I'm really happy
right what's going on oh nothing you
cooking yeah what's on the menu tonight
I love our SEP that's going
I put some stuff together I microwaved
you sweet potato and we have some oh yo
broccoli and sausage and then I am
sauteing some B Tech College is a
healthy meal what does Daisy get these
got a walk today you went into work
judo alive und oh yeah I need to retweet
that elzar funny tweet oh yeah
taking Daisy on a walk since it's so
nice out I just can't get over this
weather these trees ah
so during my walk I thought I would find
a geocache that's on the trail that I'm
walking on and apparently there is one
and it's right over there so I'm going
to try and find it I have the app out
see see I'm pretty close it's just right
up here so let's go find this supposedly
it's in here but I literally can't find
it
that's the thing about these yeah if you
don't you got to spin that's the thing
about geocaches you have to spend time
looking for them and it's confusing
sometimes this is cool looks like some
kids made a Ford but it got destroyed by
the Colorado winner
they got rope and entrance mat flooring
roof good job whoever built this well no
luck there I just gave up but there is
one right down the street that I think
it says it's easy so I'm just gonna see
if it's there just when I was about to
give up again I finally spotted the
geocache see it right there that blends
in so perfectly let's go grab it
come on guys
ah check this guy out
oh sweet very nice hide fellas gotta
open this hold on I like the way that
they camouflage this it's very smart I
don't have a piece of paper pen to write
my name but that was a good hide they
did wow this goes back a long time ago
I'm surprised that some of these even
stay like together because Colorado as
you guys know there's like there's like
lots of snowstorms and stuff so there's
also this little blanket thing I don't
know what this is but well there you go
folks well after a nice chill walk with
Daisy time to relax by the pool
