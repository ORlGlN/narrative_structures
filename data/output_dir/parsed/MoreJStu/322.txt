like you're about to fall over adults
can have fun pew right no oh
see if you can go back Oh Oh guys Ethan
is filming the YouTube vid over here
actually I don't know his channel I
think his name's Rashad I think I heard
him say that hey what's up YouTube names
Rashad nope so we have some kind of
exciting potential news as you know our
short film trailer has been released and
we shot a short film we're going to be
releasing it next month and if you guys
have been following us for a while
we like to do premieres of our short
film so we just found out that this
place has like a theater and a whole
area for anybody's like this look at
this this is a giant theater area anyone
can sit there's a screen right there
not sure where the projector would go
but inside they have screens so what
we're thinking about doing is premiering
our short film here as well as in
Colorado so if any of you guys are in
California stay up-to-date with us here
on this channel and on Twitter or
wherever and we'll probably hopefully
have a showing at the YouTube space here
so you guys can come hang out with us
watch the film should be a fun time do
you like that idea yeah
okay you don't make me laugh
no on that trailer a lot of you who like
is this real yeah guys it is real guys
it's not a full movie it's a short film
it's like 20 it's gonna be like 20
minutes long so if you can't find this
headquarters just look for the giant
YouTube sign that is so cool guys we
have a good idea since we're here at the
YouTube headquarters space we should
sneak around and see what we can find
you guys down let's do
this
where are we going we gotta find her way
in or below the sign
oh they took up the stairs
the second train the heck
whoa that would be so fun what are you
doing up there
get down from there
it might be nice back shade
there's so many plugs
no one knows I'm back here that's the
funny thing
fine but we could pull prank on them let
me do you like this check out what we
just found where did that go
I don't know anybody in here
it's kinda hard doing this with what
need
because I can't climb ladder with one
Ian
Oh
I wish there was like a door appears um
like a secret lair that would be fun to
explore if we were staying overnight
here which we will do soon what the tree
looks like it which gained our way that
is free come on come on who's dead
someone's in here filming and I are
talking about how nice this area is like
a lot of parts of California are kind of
dirty and not really well maintained
this is great
and they have a lot of new buildings
going up I'm just really digging the
vibes over here did you figure out
something strange and really weird
this light is this fake grass like yeah
like why they have like sprinklers here
this is legit this is fake yeah fake
grass what the heck do they water their
fake grass here
food has arrived watch this
Wow well that's in the vlog thanks for

comments and likes on our last board
video we will be doing the PlayStation
in the Fort axle at the store this can
be so much fun
