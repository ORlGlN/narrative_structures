we're doing a little bit of a prick
today have you guys heard of Frank's not
sure if you've heard of pranks before
while we're back at it so we're at
Costco we're gonna Gluck we're at Costco
we're gonna grab some specific supplies
for this specific prank for this
specific person so let's go inside show
you what's happening thank you but can
you do this alright we are in the
business aisle they should have sticky
notes here haha
I found the sticky notes guys whoa where
is they right here and then we got the
multicolored flavors yes plus a bonus
holder oh yes should we get styrofoam to
plastic we haven't even told you guys
what we're doing maybe scotch tape you
want to explain to him what we're doing
then so you know our friend Nick yeah
well he deserves a good frame so we're
gonna go to where he works and do
something to his car so that's what the
sticky notes are before just completely
cover it I like that idea
so I'm just thinking if we need any
other supplies we better get him wait
are these our single color white yeah
this is the Costco speed cycle
run yep
yes this should do the trick
Nick we're coming for you no all right
guys we're here
Perkins is right up there as you guys
know or maybe if you didn't know Nick
sells cars so he's busy which gives us
the perfect opportunity to sticky-note
his whole car the whole thing okay guys
were in that elevator we had to sneak
around to get to the elevator because
they Nick could see us from the inside
well let's see if this cars out here
all right somewhere up here and Nick's
in there
where is next car we found next car guys
yeah this is perfect it's like hidden
behind all these big cars okay what's
the plan
so we should do the windows like colored
because we have mainly yellow on yellow
sticky notes so we can put yellow along
a lot of the blue you can say he kept
his car locked we could sticking out his
inside his car
I'm gonna start with pink on his yes sir
pink right here it's ordered think on
the windows yeah
we are adding some of our own custom
design to this sticky note paint job we
have written written his name in the
blue like sometimes you're parked in the
parking garage you can't make remember
where you parked this one he knows for
sure this is his car
exactly we have our first visitors do
you know whose car this is photos
yeah yes you got extra help we're
getting creative with this now got multi
colors did a dorky heart got a flower

sides done so turn out this side oh I
