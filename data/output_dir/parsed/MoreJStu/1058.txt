Soopers because we wanted to play some
dry ice and show you guys our skills
with dries because we know some tricks
and you don't so we have a big block and
some ice cubes that we are going to be
showing you some secrets not really
secrets but things that you could try at
home now kids when you dry ice you're
gonna have to buy it with parents okay
because this is very cold out so you
don't touch with hands that's why we
have gloves right Andrew right and we
have a hammer here because we you know
chocolate you can like you take a bigger
piece you say wow this should I should
be smaller piece and boom smaller pieces

show them um there's a bug on this unit
sander Oh get it do it though no don't
cut me tongue you just drive it on the
river you idiot - smash it yeah

best episode of it for me so okay so for
this one we are trying we have never
done this before a bunch of water in the
bathtub with the big block of dry ice we
don't know how this is going to turn out
but
let's all we'll see what happens this
should be epic well that'll work
what whoa take the hammer on the hair of
it a quick tip for you by the way when
you put in dry eyes you always put it in
warm water if you're put in cold water
it won't be as a effective so don't slip
on that super effective okay
