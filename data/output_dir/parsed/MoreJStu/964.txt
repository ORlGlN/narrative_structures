pissed

amount how pretty it is it's all snowy
and Wow I can zoom in really good really
Wow before I can zoom in
that's insane so now let's see the whole
mouth
Oh long drive now back home back at the
apartment guys I just want to point this
out you I don't know if I've shown this
in other vlogs but this guy's car will
literally be clean no matter what type
of weather literally just snowed last
night so that means this guy must have
got up and cleaned his car like I've
never seen it dirty once and so I don't
know if you ever buy a car you probably
want to buy a car from this guy cuz he
sure knows how to take care of his cars
but I guess I'll end the vlog here also
before I go I want to let you know I
want to let you guys know that I created
a new Twitter so we have our j stu
studios twitter now but then i have my
own personal twitter and then andrew has

description as well so yeah come say
hello to us and we'll see you guys
tomorrow hope you guys have a great day
bye it just piecing this together while
you're begging for attention accusing me
of
up when that was never my intention but
I guess you'll never understand cause
you always think you've got the upper
hand
and before you go up you know you're
turning into the person that you made
the mouse so tell me
I'm to blame cuz he you brought up the
worst in me why did it take so long to
see that I'm just fine
