skate shop because I had this radical
idea which I'll show you guys throughout
the fall so let's go take a look right

in a minute and the other side meri what
we're doing is we're cutting out the js2
logo to put it on the blank board here
so let's see the front yes it's
basically cut out ready to go right okay
very careful this may take a while Oh
nuts and then on the bottom of the board
I put the paper like stenciled like that
so we can spray paint it and with if you
have a bunch of different colors let me
show you we got this metallic gold this
awesome looking blue and then we have a
I think a few other colors in a garage
but I think this red griptape on this
white boards gonna look really cool
since we gotta all cut out here
we haven't attached it yet but that's
what it looks like it's pretty cool and
then we're gonna spray-paint them bottom
huh he kept I spray paint the bottom
