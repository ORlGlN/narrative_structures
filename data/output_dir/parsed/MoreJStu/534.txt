don't know if it's a food or if it's
just and hell are g it's my I like Solan
I don't know what's happening yeah I
hope it got goes down Rolly otherwise

weird yeah but happy Valentine's Day my
love guys we've had like how many
Valentine's days together huh I honestly
don't probably like eight No eight total
I'm just so blessed to have been able to
spend the Valentine's Day only with you
hey guys we're going to get some
breakfast and it's just spend the day
together so let's go there are some
seriously idiotic people our apartment
our apartment complex specifically told
people not to bring in 18-wheelers and
they went over the curb and into the
grass and concrete area and now got
stuck like why would you bring this here
and now they're gonna get in trouble and
get fined but I just thought I'd film
this like some people just love using
their brain they're trying to get it out
let's see what happens
oh my gosh
ouch hopefully they can get it out soon
cuz it's kind of blocking the road here
but yeah
well they're doing it though
good job squad all right you guys
guessed it for breakfast we're a modern
market hey this place is good
unashamed hopefully you don't look that
I but you are I don't know what happened
to your eye
think I see our waffle
right there ladies I'm gonna right there
she's taking our waffle you got a
spinach and bacon scrambler with
cinnamon waffle it smell so good okay
guys so we figured out something
insanely awesome epic Oh
what'd you tell him about it we have
another Jeep there's like a movie player
and so we're gonna do for like our
little date I guess it's like watch a
movie in the car I know we all just
wanted to show you this you can't
obviously be driving and do this but
yeah it's actually like pretty high
quality and you have surround sound you
could turn them loud
like so epic so of snacks and can I go I
to movie like right by the mountain so
you know find a good spot I can't get
over how cool is this
I want this Jeep now Brett can I have it
it's horse it is yeah what the heck were
you doing
look at that quality maybe with the
drinks were in the slide yeah
well we are back home that was super
chill and I wanted to show you guys
something I bought the other day but I'm
so excited I finally did it
Maze Runner Scorch Trials this is
probably one of my favorite movies
honestly I this is the second in the
series of Maze Runner series I don't
know if you guys saw the first one but I
love this movie and I finally bought it
was only 10 bucks at Best Buy so we'll
be watching this soon anyways we are
going to the gym because we haven't gone
in a while honestly so we want to get
back into it I got my non-gmo shirt on
she's got a new workout shirt on
don't fill me well my hair is crazy
Daisy is just being Daisy you want some
potatoes Daisy me and Brittany also just
posted probably our favorite picture as
a couple on our instagrams if you guys
saw this one just posted it we literally
just took this after we while we were
watching the movie like let's take some
pics and then if you go to her page she
posted it as well my dad got us this for
Christmas or birthday a while ago and it
is so good they at the gym they just
used radio and it's kind of lame so I'm
gonna play my music this time
yes
quick viga after the workout this flavor
is super good tropical it tastes just
like a tropical smoothie and I only use
water to so it's got 20 grams of protein
fantastic
so me and Brett have been watching some
Amazing Race and this guy just came up
some of you who followed me on snapchat
may have seen this but when your mom
accidentally shrinks your shirt in the
washer and you have to go to school well
like what is that hey everybody
meri and I are on our way to do
something really fun right now
I'm vlogging right now because we're
running late so if I'll be much what
we're doing is Mary's parents got us
this Groupon for Christmas and I don't
really know how to explain this
it's this place and they put you in a
room and there's like clues and
mysteries and riddles
and you had to solve them and get out so
I think that's about it but they said
you can't film inside the room which is
annoying but I know if we give away all
the prizes so I'm gonna film as much as
we can
yeah it should be fun found a parking
spot or downtown Manitou Springs 30-odd
being down here at night mary says she
doesn't like it there's a few creepy
stores down here right over here I
thought enter the room I believe this is
it guys
whoa that was so fun
no it's like trying to figure out how
much time you have left oh yeah the
waiting room five was kind of weird but
then once you got into the maze flower
days but yeah but it was like really
cool you had to figure out like clues
and they go on to unlock this box unlock
that box new clues so you only get 60
minutes to figure out the puzzle and we
solved it in 59 minutes call four of us
there was like people look at this Wow
but the guy said they're moving to a
larger location this summer downtown not
Manitou and they're also thinking about
they're trying to do escape the
apartment where you get an entire
apartment room need to figure out how to
get out whoa so awesome
maybe they want to make us a unique room
with one where we can vlog it that way
we don't give away the puzzle but that'd
be cool
time for dinner now and Chipotle is
given my free burritos so we're gonna
get a free burrito for dinner
