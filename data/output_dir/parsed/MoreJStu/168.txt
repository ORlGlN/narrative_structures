how this is work how we're doing this
right now how it works well I'm going to
be a character and Justin twelve oval my
world was like spinning Justin's going
to or I'm going to be a character and
then Justin is going to be character but
he's going to do the scene with me this
doesn't make any sense so we can't be in
the scene together so he's recording his
character well I'm like doing like he's
just standing here right now Sean is
