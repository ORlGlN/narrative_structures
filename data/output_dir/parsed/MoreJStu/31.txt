clean as a whistle the thing is sweet
you already tested it in the snow so man
it's powerful here's my bike but looks
like what's going on here like is this a
flat tire how did this happen doesn't
need to get some gas at the gas station
and maybe some air for this what someday

curious if they would serve us in the
drive-through on these things I also you
know we have to do that guys for the
vlog gear up let's go
sound like they go fast
we're here at the Arby's drive-through

off because obviously these bikes are
pretty loud all right Andy you're up

buy one of these and drive to drive to
school seriously but they're still fun
if you guys are in high school man just
please do that simple snacks got some
Otzi sticks fries curly fries YUM
here we are Black Forest Park for some
adventures backpack think about our
bikes too we realized this on the bike
it says they're meant for offroad not
like streets they're meant for off roads
that means we're gonna go off-roading we
also brought the GoPro guys to get some
cool shots over here in this lush
mountain
this is a pretty big Hill for us
a lot of dead trees out here because
there's actually a forest fire here in
Colorado are you going to face the big
hill all right I'm filming going to go
on hills when things go pretty fast
almost to our location we'll all get out
the snacks in the lap it's quite the
journey though these things don't got
enough power to make it up hills like
this three horsepower come on oh wow
this is quite the view I know thanks
Harry Hoover now snacks here open up
your Bay did the same thing mine blew up
everywhere we got him
one of the big reasons I love just
coming out to nature is just hearing how
peaceful and quiet it is just listen to
this guy's really so I was just thinking
our RV is gonna be a lot like these
little dirt bikes
anytime we encounter a really big hill
someone's going to push on the gas and
the other people have to jump out and
push it up yeah almost encountered that
going up a hill in our city also who's
ready for a quick
Elmo clip Wow
with chicken yummy Elmo
so we're finding some jumps on our way
back to the car as you just saw I did
one now we have one right in front of us
the Andrews gonna try doesn't look like
much but oh it'll be good
ready go
round two
Oh got air on that one check out this
donut one thing we definitely need to
bring ya my hands on I call I guess you
can't wait oh you can kind of tell ya
like gripping that and it like shaking
ain't like a lot of friction and going
down those hills that's scary so I was
like oh no back home and very hungry

chicken rice keeping it simple got some
leftover fajitas with a couple Girl
Scout cookies you know what I mean
