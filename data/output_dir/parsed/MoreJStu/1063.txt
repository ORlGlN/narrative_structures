minutes and 30 seconds worth of bad
prank ideas so yeah that's gonna be a
lot it's gonna be red oh my and right
now I add in a final cut 10 but I've
been editing in Final Cut 7 longer than
10 so it's kind of hard to switch over
to 10 but I took a class on how to edit
in Final Cut 10 so I don't know I still
like Final Cut 7 a lot but Final Cut 10
has a lot of more features that are that
are really nice so I mean I don't you
guys make videos and what what do you

is there Sony Vegas
premiere or iMovie or something like
that
