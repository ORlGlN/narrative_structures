wave back home guys and Chris actually
has been telling us about this random
product that he found it's called the
miracle berry and once you eat it and
try like for example a fruit or a pepper
or something
it makes the flavor like completely
different so we went to the store got
like some lemons limes strawberries and
we're going to try and see if it
actually tastes difference we have
everything pickles
pineapples oranges strawberries
blueberries limes and lemons so you have
to try all the trip first then take the
meat of whatever what suppose miracle
berry tell me then take that and then
supposedly all this take changes the
flavor so we're just trying everything
first real quick we're trying the lemon
now your lips will be south
if you lie to me Chris Wow that's yummy
loving hmm just before there I was like
freaking out because they were so sour I
need to try the line now sprite what the
heck not sour folks strawberry
strawberry tastes normal really yeah
