box number one we have this is curry
chicken with some plantains
he said this is pretty authentic so I'm
taking report this box we have some
official jamaican jerk chicken with
Jamaican rice and beans

have some jerk seasoning this is from
Jamaica and also this Hellfire sauce
which is from Jamaica I want a piece
