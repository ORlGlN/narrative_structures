well good morning guys and welcome back
to more Jase - it's another new day here
another vlog and andrew is excited to
tell you about what's going to happen
alright cut okay let me just tell you
guys so the weather here in Colorado is
extremely hot out today's probably 90
degrees and if you guys watched our
previous blog where we tinfoil Aaron's
car we're like we came up with the idea
of can we cook on this Tim flow because
the car was insanely hot so we're going
to try that today a lot of you guys like
that idea also side note here is the
other plaque we have number we are
showing you at Andrew's house mine
almost fall off the wall it's coming off
the sticky part here
luckily cuz it was hanging up here next
to the other one so I just put on the
ground now
oh good morning Daisy how is you today
see she's panting because it's hot and
we don't have an AC in here it's okay
currently andrew is working on his
newest Instagram post if you guys follow
us hoping to all those are missing out
go give it a like we just got done with
a live stream too so those funds but
let's get the day started and head to
the store and get some supplies and food
let's see if we can grill out what
little Whole Foods to get some
groceries with a grill helmet for our
cookout see you there
of course we need some eggs on sale yeah
we got like a breakfast item now we need
like a meat item we got to try the whole
different variety let's go some shrimp
on the Bobby yeah man
and then we need some dessert yo what do
you got so good in here
oh yes YUM grab it now wanna leave this
money please
now what are the last supplies we need
any tin foil yes nonstick yes it's
perfect
and an egg holder okay check this out
just a pan for this job what this
literally is that for an egg yes it's
like a single egg put some convenience
misto some foil yeah we just pulled up
to Aaron's work and we found his car
uh-huh
which is it Oh check out their mama stat
it's 90 degrees boys ow
yeah it's not a songs Arizona but what I
can do it's gonna be a lot hotter when
we put this on there yeah let's go make
an oven Wow okay just doing a test did
it hot yeah it was pretty warm out oh
not this tin foil again Oh a little
windy but the Sun no clouds we're going
to need some tape I can pick that help
it's about to fall
what are you making here for the oven Oh
like a reflector Sheila's and boys it's
going to get steamy on this oven okay
guys we're going to start with the cajun
shrimp we found this is seriously if you
just keep your hand on here for a bit
ouch yeah all right I'm going to be so
cool soon I will keep an eye on these
okay let them sit for a bit all right
next up what do we got eggs all right
got an egg pan here show you some all
the make sure the doesn't stick this is
pretty hot standing right here
fresh meat now we let that boy sit for a
good few hours maybe soon actually well
I'm hoping sooner we have an idea so we
got Aaron's car open it's unlocked so we
have the food out here cooking but will
it cook faster if we put it on the dash
same concept let's try it is very hot
here Wow well if we take tinfoil here
too like yeah and guys do you think we
should leave some food for Aaron when he
gets off work maybe some cookies we
could leave some on the hood and in the
car yeah I kind of like that idea I'm
getting the cookies outlaw and Andrew is
installing a reflector fire shield
but yes good the reflector oven we're
going to go back to the house maybe get
some supplies that might speed up the
process yeah because it's gonna take a
while I'd be like feel like it shouldn't
cause it's so hot
that's like I'm getting cooked what are
people going to save and say when they
walk by and just see a bunch of cookies
and shrimp but I still know what they're
snapjet
yeah and your fountain and has one
mirror this will do though that'll cover
the whole circumference of the food I
know yes guys is this is this super
weird or what what's happening you can
see both of us in one shot what even you
could see yourself if you look at it
if you see that that who is that okay
let's stop goofing around sorry I'm so
explain about how long 45 minutes you've
taken a little bit goober yeah well
they're not too long what was your math
on the cookies explain to them what is
the instruction say actually if you saw
the box yeah so it says to cook these at
350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes
so what we're assuming that inside the
car is about a hundred yeah so that's
just like three times the amount of time
like so that'd be eight sixteen
twenty-four like over a little half an
hour like 30 minutes and they're done
that's what this box says right that's
not how that's your method is it work
though it's probably not I know math
people out there how long would it take
the cookies to cook in the car if it's
about a hundred degrees would it be sir
I don't know let's just look okay grab
the mirror boy oh I'll get it okay
ah what in the world is happening the
egg oh it looks like jell-o what is it
crispy it was kind of crispy what okay
mirror mode now mirror mode like the
direct layer I don't know what this
especially oh wow
now tilt it up so it's like a line of
Sun oh you're blasting me in the face my
fault
let's see really windy though this
shrimp are like crispy this one is too
as well I don't know if you can tell but
you're supposed to be try a bite let us
know
we're going to go inside and see if we
can get Aaron to come outside and maybe
try a bite of a cookie that he made look
great
yeah we're in now where's Aaron
I think he's outside a secret mission
Oh
whoo oh man it would be so nice to jump
in the pool right now
Oh where's that man Aaron
yeah
there he is
Aaron Aaron what your hands even get in
here
we just said we knew a man named Aaron
works here how'd you guys get in here I
just told you you're wondering to go on
to take a break that's impressive
my car yeah they've been baking for a
couple hours okay outside just like five
minutes yes I can't wait to try these
cookies I'm so hungry
I thought Aaron can take like a
five-minute break
that's some fresh cookies this is the
best five minute break you've ever had a
thing are you saying the AP in there
broke our a/c broken 90 degrees back ah
does break it right Wow this is epic
good no wow man and the wind is kind of
like destroying the temperature out here
but inside those cookies were really
warm so we can try them and the shrimp
is somewhat like it's kind of crispy
oh I know you really want to try this
egg
why not was recovered collecting raw
eggs looks so good it kind of did I um
Rose oh I know
retrieve the cookies y'all addict it is
very warm in here the POW do at the
bottom yeah those are definitely a lot
more all right oh yeah it feels like so
good the chocolate even melting Oh try a
bite and your carpet here we go yeah
look is so warm and cozy and gooey
I won't wear this creamy blue that I'm
not good looking oh my goodness
Aaron this is what you do every time to
come to work just throw some cookies on
the dash and when you're done you'll
have a whole stack like a natural air
freshener it smells like a baker's oven
