it's time to jump in today's special
guest on the blog is check out this
wait this giant fluffy thing
oh that's are you sure yeah it's like a
little mustache with a camera
yeah sure have you ever been to a
trampoline parking lot yes okay I was
gonna say I might get where we live I
might show you up oh okay we got the pit
here like event I didn't know if I
mentioned but this template park is huge
much bigger than the ones in Colorado we
live weren't you so right now
so there's so much to show you guys
let's get it the first jump in the of
the day
oh you're liking the folks what in the
world is this
it's the cliff of Douma bottom jumping
off the cliff of doom
so cool look a height is I don't know I
mean it doesn't look that high from here
whoa I'm ruining my white shirt in here
I got a bunch of the foam blobs here hey
I love when trampolines have this kind
of area these are fun to do little
tricks on I'll do something right
so Stuart's been practicing some like
tricks this looks scary
bouncing off this wall back flip
Wow
yeah we thought this was it but over
here there's a whole new zone - this is
so cool this is like the parkour zone
cuz then I got like a rock wall they got
the obstacle course over there they even
have the level up there this is suppose
we got a slide first time in the park or
first let's see how good idea
what is it pain banana instead of banana
No
Oh
he's so high out
Oh
cumberly cool and this one's like an
acrobat when you have to swing and then
land on the back who thinks I can do it
Oh
oh you're almost there Jake time to go
up the big slide whoa hello this is
pretty hi guys here we go
no I love this giant slide jump off
cliff I've been making some snapchats I
think you guys would like this one
we just filmed it in Reverse
then we did one for him too I found the
ultimate obstacle course this is huge
and yep like there's so much to this
that goes from all the way up there to
all over there
that was really hard here's what it
looks like from up here
Wow
come on yeah you did it like I said
seriously this is the coolest trampoline
park I just really want to do a 24-hour
video here so maybe we can make it
happen
good grief we're just about to leave and
it just got packed here check it out got
all the kids right there it's a madhouse
over here we've got to be careful on the
weekend everybody likes the trampoline
park our time is up for the trampoline
park what did you think Stuart when we
first walked in I was like oh Jace do
you pick this one but we walked in I was
like oh this one's tiny and like this is
the biggest one we've ever been to and I
was like and the other parks you've been
to it must have just been like a single
trampoline because so yeah this was
actually my favorite one that I've been
actually yeah one of my favorite ones
I'd have to agree what could make
trampoline parks better though you've
been to a lot what does it every single
one lacking that's a really good
question I don't know I feel like they
could continue to innovate like the
obstacle course is really cool yeah I
don't know maybe that's a comment you
guys leave a comment what do you guys
think yeah should trampoline parks add I
was thinking that some day in the future
they're going to invent
some sort of stone and that's a lot
better than they have because the blocks
are like when you give it you're just
like can't get stock and it's like yeah
that's the thing about trampoline parks
it's the hardest is when you fall into
the stuff but okay what does that get
him to be we don't know we're here to
see your guys comments make sure you
leave a like if you guys want to see us
do more trampoline parks Andrew I'm
sorry you couldn't come to this one this
was the best but maybe the next one so
maybe and obviously check out Stuart's
channel and all that stuff you haven't
seen his vids links in the description
thanks Stuart edge you know simple as
that
I'll see you guys later goodbye
