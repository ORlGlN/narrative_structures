more time about to shoot a challenge
with Jack that involves this this and
this can you guess what it is
no but you can't are you ready for
what's about to happen jack yep there
you have it folks before we go guys we
want to show you some thing cool so if
you saw our squeaky shoes at the dog
park prank People magazine shared it so
that was really cool
also ABC News did an article about it
and just posted a like they had it on
their show so I wanted to show you this
because it's kind of funny they
mispronounce things so onto this one
because I love telling stories about
crazy dudes now this is this is this
goes in the category of when you have so
much time on your hands you can just do
stuff like this these guys and their
names are Justin steward and Andrew
situs of astu studios they put over -
squeaky stuff in their shoes and they
ran around and look at how the dogs go
around them check this out oh we love it
by the way this was also the guest
appearance from comedian Jack Vale the
famous student pulls pranks everywhere
check out these dogs
look at that it's like you and they're
digging after his feet like I said a lot
yeah there's a few things wrong with
that misspelled or mispronouncing
Andrews last name and sites it's getting
our channel name wrong it's not jst you
j stu studios but ah thanks guys that's
not sarcastic oh yeah so I wait just let
me show you that and we have a hint for
you guys a youtube trick tip want to
show them it yeah so sometimes people
they've been saying this for a while
like YouTube's broken because I can't
see like our uploads in your sub box or
whatever but there's actually a fix of
that so here we are new channel art by
the way so if you're on your computer
and you hover over here and here oh I'm
subscribed and you're not getting
updates it's because there's a gearbox
here and you got you if this isn't
clicked you want to click this and you
always want to get updates safe so for
both our channels you need this so
sometimes if you come in here this see
look I'm not even getting updates
alright send updates and sometimes this
option isn't available so what you can
do is you can just unsubscribe real
quick or we subscribe here it up and
usually it'll be there you want to
always double always always and don't
click this box because then you won't
find stuff you like and stuff safe so
make sure you guys all do that right now
so you see everything and do that to all
your favorite youtubers and YouTube also
added the support button we're not quite
sure how it works but this there's a lot
of the channels that have it two likes
because of this thing and you can just
whatever you feel like which is pretty
cool that they added that option for
anybody feels supportive I guess and
we're not we're not saying you guys need
to donate us money we're just letting
you know that YouTube released these
features and say you like some channel a
lot and you just feel the urge to send
them a dollar then it's Jack van
whoever it is most channels have it so
that's there for you guys of anything
else there oh just
oh there's Cody and Jake he made the new
he made the new a banner and logo so
thanks Cody you're all but I was gonna
say if you guys sometimes aren't seeing
our videos like our vlogs YouTube let us
know that you they like to show videos
to people are very interactive with
channels so if you're commenting on our
vlogs all the time and leaving likes
YouTube will recognize that and it's
just more likely to show our videos in
your sub box all the time because they
see you're really interactive with this
channel so here's more videos from them
since you like them so so that's how you
do it if you want to see because more
often do the gear box leave a like in
the comment simply even if it's just
like a random comment sandwich so you
can try it out maybe leave some comments
alcoholic Wow finally we got to talk
about a comment of the day our challenge
