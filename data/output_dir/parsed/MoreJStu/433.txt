here's the TV remote and it was really
dark last night and I was trying to turn
off the TV and usually the power buttons
are like in the corners so I like went
up here and I was like because I was
like tired and it was dark my hit menu
and then I was like oh that didn't turn
off the TV so I tried this corner order
like it was basically almost ordering a
movie I was just trying to turn off the
TV but the worst part is is this has
happened to me before in California I
think it was like I don't know maybe a
year and a half ago or two years ago
Justin I had to fly out to California
for something and I accidentally ordered
a movie by trying to turn off the
television in the dark so this is just
I'm not good with remotes in the dark
why are the power button so hard to find
anyways that's my story has this
happened to anybody else before you're
trying to turn off the TV Ramon you
ordered Star Wars on accident no I don't
