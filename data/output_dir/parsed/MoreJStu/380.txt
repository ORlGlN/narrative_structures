Hey welcome back to vlogs everybody it's
raining outside but we're going inside
and Nicolas car with a big we're
building another four so we're going to
try the water bottle for today because
last time you tried it didn't really
work so I'm going to try and make it
very powerful for today we'll find out a
few minutes there water bottle section
is up to par for for building they've
never been to their water bottle area
before this is what we did a double
decker Ford here but out yeah so let's
go check it out
because you just whip them up yeah I
always get nervous community stores
because so many people have been
building forts lately it's like catching
on they're hungry sir they'll get food
like the water bottle for its because
you kind of get a workout because these
are how heavy are these I don't know how
many pounds these are but they're heavy
so lots of half knows about Matt pounds
what official snack nut of USA Swimming
how can we get a product that says
official snack of more gates to YouTube
vloggers we have a little bit above
expenses I don't know that'd be funny
though if you guys saw like a sticker
said official snack for taste or just
YouTube vloggers in general we've made a
little progress here guys here's a
little entrance that they have so many
of these go this way and I made this
kind of like a wall so it's pretty
powerful we can do it since they have so
many we just stack them all up and this
area will be like a mini back
and then we open it up
Andrews back there right now adjusting
the walls it's kind of hard because so
many people want water bottles so we
keep having to take breaks it's clear
right now but yeah right back here Liz
looking good I'm just going to move a
pole up these water bottles forward Nick
and Aaron are spying Aaron was down
there I don't know where he went there
in the told head rile they're making
sure that no employees are coming yeah I
found the one I wanted oh you did yeah
you sure that's the right one No
but I not receive
we moved over to this section
glad we finally made it in and we just
have to open it up more so that they can
come into we're just got to keep
stacking these what put some here
there's no more back here what oh wait
there's these okay that's a stranger so
since we ran out of water bottles we
have used a different brand to stack on
top of these ones it's working very well
so far but we have some gaps and we want
to expand over here but there's so many
of these yes the cardboard we put here
to block the wall that is a good
invention let's see if you can make it
through the bar
you're sly here
you made it
here's the outside it's pretty good we
took some of these extra pieces of
cardboard and I put it right here so you
can't see him oh there goes Nick
hush
Wow I'm the only one out here now what
about you

Andy can you hand us back the chicken
tenders yo yo how much five each Wow
I'm glad we're actually making it work

Mars here it goes the roof installation
what
we've never had a fort with a roof
before wow this is a cool for me meeting
this is very fun just a little crammed
it's all Gary why is it blurry there we

Justin's going pee ah so much worse is
definitely a three-man 4
what's happening Wow
whose eggs making all that noise yeah we
need to make this little bit bigger
let's him the Camerata cheston's
well there and there I'm trying to
establish a plan of what to do so we
have built all in that area but we have
all of this to expand but how so this is
the entrance so we're going to have to
close off this entrance and like build
up put these over here because we can
make a path to go all the way over there
but then it like opens up here's another
entrance we made right here which is a
little open but we just need to keep
opening up so we can actually move
around back there
build you move those up here so your
prey tonight yes Andrews using 55% grain
power right now
Oh people coming
duck and cover a little kid just came
into the fort Judy's just look at Andros
like Oh little bro very entrance wow
dude happy how fast I did yeah
but it was funny cuz that little boy was
I telling his mom is a I could build a
fort here just look up of these then he
came in it was just looking at me as a
Hello wish who stick I don't know how
we're gonna make this into here oh my
goodness very
I'm pretty dumpy to be honest if someone
comes in but us
who's eaten eggs in here random eggshell
you have to stay like that forever and
house stuck in a water bottle fourth
we were trying to move this piece but
it's holding up this whole wall and I
started collapsing so that would have
been bad we had to stop I just can't do
anything this
yeah I'm pretty stuck as well I don't
even know how to get out of here pretty
dark nice over here
I guess a fort is supposed to be parking
no one's in here
hey guys they just take the ladder in
100 where is he going
I can see the reflection
they think they know we're in here but
they don't care well I think that's the
best we can do for the water-bottle
aisle and this Walmart yeah
but you guys it's pretty cramped it's
pretty nice come
this section is pretty cool but this
section is and then the section behind
us is a now we have to get out of here
without being spotted
don't let the ladder hey she just she
took one Wow
dude did she look
huh make our way out of here
where they're sleeping over all right
one more
Oh
it's a good thing we got out because
people started taking apart our walls
like someone took that piece that piece
I guess we'll put him back where he goes
and the brand back
goodbye fort you were a good fort
strange fort makes a bit dusty there is
some dust on them
