product that involves paint and shooting
paint at each other we got to find that
and that will tell you more about this
idea well check out these neon balls I'm
trying to it's slipping oh is this it
yeah here it is
look you got the gun right here you feel
this gun up with the paint and you
should to paint at each other and they
all watch paintballs throwable
paintballs
watch all the colors so what we could do
is we can get all white shirts me and
you and we have that battle in the woods
you choose your gun
choose your paint flavor and battle Wow
give me a gun I want green gimme gimme
green so you got to get the color that
goes with your gun so I got green so I
get green paint okay
makes sense I'll get big
white shirt for us is that kids Wow this
is small most t-shirt well
oh here's adults ah give me that now I
have other white things like yeah you

white shoes oh yeah keeping it fresh

blast battle yeah we're almost ready for
the battle to commence but guys I don't
know if you can tell the sky is kind of
cloudy it's actually starting to rain so
that won't stop us you take a position
on one side and I'll take this over the
other okay let the attacks begin
there's a bunch of trees over here so
I'm gonna hide
I found a hiding spot under this tree a
little bit so I'm gonna scout out the
area
we're sneaking into Sector 7 I'll see
any size of blue paint boy really blush
oh I see somebody carried a cover by
this shrub I'm lining up we'll see how
far I can shoot
Lyceum party no I don't know if I should
be in defense mode or attack mode attack
mode let's do this chart
oh no I charge my gun retreat
I got a job
I realized with this gun and start
shooting when you pump it
they're taking a break from the battle
to look at the wounds some serious spray
itch and this stuff is sticky yeah I
don't know how these guns work once you
start shooting he can't stop no we got
shot Tucanae jazz well oh we have a good
age Justin put his gun up here now
there's paint all over the tree I'm
gonna try out the grenades how do these
grenades work you can reach in there and
grab those whoa
dodged Oh Neil come on come on yeah here
comes a glob grenade attack I'm trying
to throw the left-handed not only do the
paintballs hurt the other pain is
extremely sticky and because guns don't
stop shooting I'm ready for a photo
shoot dude you look cool though
you're the guy any guy getting a fun toy
or what fun but very messy and annoying
if you got this toy for your kids if
you're one of those activities that once
you're done you immediately just chuck
them in the bathtub yeah but you can't
really have a battle because it just
wouldn't shoot but either way just easy
to stand this far away from each other
it was a fun little vlog for us either
way if it didn't work out as we thought
make sure I baron with us today I know
Justin doesn't feel well
I don't feel well so it's probably some
of you out there don't feel well but
