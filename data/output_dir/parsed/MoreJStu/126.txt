yeah hi and welcome back to mortgage do
everybody okay first I'd the vlog can
any of you guess where I am right now
I'm here threatening I don't know what
this is but pretty creative stuff right
here we are here in Utah because if you
guys remember Brittany and I were on the
TV show relative race and if you don't
know what that is here's a quick little
snippet of what that was about
I'm Brittany Stewart and I'm just a
story
and we're Tina green from Colorado
Springs Colorado so just look for a
lantern drive new did we pass it via
turn around right here for 40
so that show was on BYU TV and that
Network has a ton of different types of
shows and they actually have this new TV
show coming out called extinct I watched
the trailer and it looks really cool and
anyways they invited us out here to come
to the premiere of the very first
episode of the show so that's tomorrow
but today we're doing an escape room
later and we're just going to be
spending some time out here in Utah you
know exploring for the next few days and
Romero would have came but they're
actually celebrating their anniversary
so they won't be joining us on this trip
we are invest by now and I just had to
film this real quick I wasn't gonna film
in here because I just bought a new
memory cards but I had to film this
before we leave it is the weirdest most
insane thing I've ever seen so a lot of
you ladies may have hair dryers or a
blow dryer
well Dyson apparently has this new
hairdryer who wants to guess how much
this is it's not fifty dollars it's four
hundred dollars Brit do you want to buy
a new hairdryer for four hundred ollars
you Mike if you blow dry your hair here
come over here let's see how like is
this really good product
it's nice and is it worth for $400 I
just I don't know guys I just thought
that was insane a $400 hair dryer if
Dyson wants to send it all accepted but
I am NOT pendant and spending $4 per
hair are you serious oh we didn't show
you a rental car either
it's a snazzy whatever this is I think
it's awesome because they hooked up a
rental car for us and the hotel so we
really appreciated that but whenever we
go to like a new city or town because me
and burn an opinion before we love
exploring like local places to eat and
this is just organic juice they got a
bunch of juices only here and that's
what we need so we just got these 50%
off don't know why they were just I
don't know I accept though spinach
remained parsley killed green and apple
or no green apple sweet Cheers
very celery yeah
there's no celery but some good
nutrients which is all the matters so
we're gonna back in the room real quick
just had to grab something but I want to
show you where we're staying not bad
check out the view
oh yeah okay so we got a head out now
because it's about a 30 minute drive to
get to the escape rooms here we're going
back
oh no don't wait for the rest of the
group to arrive I just had a plate of
fruit
and I don't know what to expect I'm not
even sure what kind of room this is
because we've done the escape rooms
before on our watch Channel if you guys
have seen them and me and Brittany are
not the best at this kind of stuff so
thankfully the basic premise is you're
going to be locked inside these rooms
and how to figure out the clues and the
puzzles which are extinct themes and
work your way through the story to
figure out how to get out oh wow this is
a small room to start at least all right
brain activity normal can we somehow
made it into the other room we literally
don't know how the door just is to never
be all the way I didn't do anything we
were just plugging stuff in the door
open below yay
and now we have this bigger room with a
bunch of words on the walls and we're
trying to figure out what's next so
we're competing against Brenton's
so we can't do any of the red things
what does this mean they're trying to
confuse us and it's working five is red
but then why does it say black we're
having some serious technical
difficulties panel activated again we
don't know how that happened this is the
one push up on the errors great the red
team's got in our room now
great you taking good care of the
veggies I'm hungry high-five him he did
the main these guys did a good job that
was probably one of the funnest escape
rooms I've ever done and I think I
mentioned earlier by Bernie and I are
not good at escape rooms and that one
had a good time at it actually
but we are super hung it's like 9 p.m.
guys and we have it at dinner yet so we
found this place called zest here looks
so good
they're open till 10:00 - oh gosh I
completely forgot to film dinner I don't
know how I forgot
so barely talked
I'm so tired I barely talked to me and
he was like shoving his face he like
didn't even like a look up from his
plate so it was so good
that's all I gotta say please just don't
unsubscribe because I didn't film the
food but anyways remember the bed now
it's like 10 and retired as all get-out
tomorrow's the premiere party
we are here at fight the new drug got a
meeting with them I'm gonna chat with
them about a few things and I'm just so
excited because I love this company
look how cold our offices it's so open
and sweet all done with that so cool
guys you'll be seeing more of them soon
on our channel fight the new drug great
company can't wait to work with them
granny not time for bed
it's uh 5:00 p.m. now and the premiere
party starts in an hour
and we're gonna get a light dinner
because I think they're gonna have
snacks they're not fully sure but I
think Britney wants to take a nap maybe
I mean I guess I haven't really shown
you guys downtown Salt Lake City it's
really cool a lot of big buildings
we have found the premiere location this
is a library this is the best library I
wish we had this in color we could do
the best pranks here it's so big
the crew Wow look at these guys they
said to touch this sometimes a talk
sometimes it doesn't
depending on your Chewie okay
hey I don't know if you're chosen let's
that's it way it's not talking
the Chumash extinct in September
oh what the heck you're always telling
me I didn't say me wait let me try it
again
Oh baby oh wait it was a little delayed
one this way down the stairs when they
have free food guys we just had dinner
before I came here but they have free
food and I can't resist
here we go guys the premiere doesn't it
