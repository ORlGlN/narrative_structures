he's so excited to show you guys
everything this is called
I never had this before no I it looks
good it is good it's just of what it
what is it it's like basically having a
root beer float but there's no ice cream

yeah my 269 that's good
we found a delicious snack I'm not gonna

clothes item that we need for it they
don't have what we're looking for but
they do have new shades Andrew those
looks styling
heck yeah plus it comes with this cool
device what is that man it's like a
scented candle
so I always smell ultra and ech you got
one to review this is like a blocking
out the way out the way did this we
arrived at home and the snack that we
both saw that we just immediately fell
in love with is bacon habanero chips and
they have the non-gmo verified logo
which even made us fall more in love
with this so we got two bags because
there's two four four so we're gonna try
these now and see like how good they're
you ready Andrew yeah yeah Andrew just
poured the root beer find you whoa so
what should we try first the root beer
milk or whatever or try this first then
you wash up yeah all right what you go
ahead wanna see see you try the chip mmm
oh that's good that's a great first
reaction wow that's a solid chip Harry
that's a non-gmo chip mm-hmm how is that
possible but it tastes like summer and
camping and barbecuing I know where our
non-gmo chips are the ball must have
more look it's a commercial
now that you've had a chip I bet you're
really thirsty yeah to try I've never
tried this before so Cheers
bottoms up look that's my every reaction
with something I haven't tried her it's
gross so I don't know if it's bad or
good by that reaction it's good it
tastes like root beer what you blogging
yeah
me too me and Brett are bored so we're
going up to the park which has that
awesome swing cuz we're going on a date
tonight and we're not fully hungry yet
so we got a chill guys every time we
come to this dadgum park usually there's
kids on it and the swing is always taken
up I just want this week to myself
without gate but whoa
okay sky today looks like it's gonna
rain or storm or something
but it is pretty nice day let's just
kind of chill is it cold
you're wearing my jack I am rain your
jacket
huh it's so funny it's like I acted like
that it's like adults acted like that in
real life I don't know can i that's them
all no you can yell puppies wow it's a
miracle and Bilbo was following us this
is the best week are you having fun
heck yeah is the best now I'm gonna push
you okay gettin off what yay
this is fun I don't think this chair can
fall cuz you can go really give it no
rude
so fun guys are missing out you don't
have swings like this to refine this
we're going down the slide for the first
time have fun sweetie
be careful Brett I found a secret
formula see come look it's a fort they
don't know where yeah alright back home
now and Erin and I are gonna go hit up
the gym so you guys want to come with
okay and then when we get back it's
destiny
got the destiny set up we got the chair
get the TV that's all you need maybe
some snacks after protein snacks after
gym protein snacks so time to get ready
it is pitch dark in here so you can't
see me one blink but this is our pump up
music four workouts usually
don't kill
here we are at the gym Aaron are you
excited Aaron's gonna bench about 280
today
max max I'll do that ten reps Oh
all right we're doing some basketball
for our cardio warm up for weights
Aaron's got a friend here as well so Wow
easy bud all right so I'm just working
out here and this bro came up to me he's
like yo man can't get paid because I'm
sure put your name Dallas Dallas is
watching her biz man yeah awesome
it's a real-life parasites from bro
science he's redoing some incline press
for us go come on man come on there much
noise awesome go wow I was impressive
apparently I'll get very angry
I was just finished cute
I started point out Jim near so I could
always make you look bigger than you
really are
why do they do that
parents sides Wow they just make you
look like that then when you get home
and see how you really are and if I do I
get back to the gym I'm losing muscle
quick or just go back home it's time you
some protein we enjoy eating this vegan
protein because it's very good for you
won't know why because there's no soy
and there's no mono nucleus osseous --is
which is very bad for you no but
seriously there's not like the bad stuff
so a lot of proteins like if they taste
really good is because I have like extra
like sugar glue stuff that's not really
that good for you so the worst it tastes
the better honestly but I just want to
say I think it's funny like seems like
there's so many little bros on internet
and everywhere anytime they see anybody
else working out they're instant
reactions ask dude how much do you how
much do you benchpress oh I can bench
about 550 and I think it's just really
funny because it's not just about like
how much you can lift weights it's about
like your goals man like what if you can
only bench five pounds and it goes the
bench 50 pounds at the end of the year
and you do it like rock on here we have
the two styles of viga there's some
straight-up water let's take a step not
that bad then we have Aaron's formula
here which is a shake with a banana and
some milk and mer oh no not that bad
so yeah I'm gonna say Aaron you love
watching bro science mm-hmm Aaron's
addicted to watching bro science huh no
if you guys watch that channel if you
don't like really lifting weights and
stuff you probably would hate it but I
know the guy is kind of funny but Aaron
and all his minion high school friends
love them my minions anyways thanks for
watching today's vlog with you guys
tomorrow thanks for joining us for a fun
day and adventures okay
crap
hmm
