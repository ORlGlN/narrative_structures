I remember Sony some of you guys in the
comments were saying it's not a
hoverboard Andrew would have to say
about that that's just what people call
them it's okay we know it's not a
hoverboard of course it's not a literal
hoverboard but that's a term for because
it's off the ground
there's no way could ever there could
ever be a hoverboard yeah technically
your feet aren't touching the ground so
this is an easier term than calling it a
hands-free Segway you know
oh just prank calling dealerships just
being being awkward for some reason
thank you for calling for quality of
service this call may be recorded
