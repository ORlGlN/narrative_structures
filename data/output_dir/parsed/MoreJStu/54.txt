really fun today because well first of
all we live in America and we don't
really have many authentic Asian food
item places like have you found any
Asian places you've been to Tokyo Joe's
and see that's more American yeah so I
thought it'd be funny and fun to bring
all these peeps to this place here in
town called Asian Pacific Market Andrew
and I've been here once and Wow let me
tell you they have the craziest food
items I ever seen I think you wanted to
bring me here when I was in my first
trimester yeah I was like there's no way
I can't even breathe so I brought my
scarf just in case do you guys like
Asian food I do
Oh Abbi think so you're about to find
out let's go inside
here we are this place is huge - and by
the way guys these two Abby and Nick are
dating apparently a lot of you in the
comments thought they were married not

I know y'all think all sorts of things
but me and Brett are married BAM dating
okay last time we came here the smells
were strong right when we came in guys
just try it out and we'll see what
happens Oh fishy
I told you do you okay bread because
they have so many fish things here
alright let's just start off right here
who wants some
delicious whatever that is
quail eggs

pregnancy it kind of makes your senses
heightened make your smells old
do real touch that
oh this is like a it's a powerful
grenade if you I think it's a fruit
durian so do I pull this and it doesn't
explode
no really good question what
here could just all right in here
that's the trooper right somebody has a
sneeze what I just leave a comment we
haven't even barely explored the store
is this FDA manger and I tried these in
the other video if you guys have been
watching for a while a bitter melon wow
this was interesting was it bitter
yes it tasted very interesting strange
yeah Nick pick that up
Jesse Oh jet fruit oh I was like a meat
supplement or a supplement no it's just
like it can have the flavor and texture
of meat if you're okay right
do not put that again okay before we
tell you what this is what do you think
it is guys
it is but tongue dude that is so we have
some fish swimming right here and these
guys I think are taking a nap
guys fret fresh fish this is very fishy
guys

bad oh this is my favorite part guys
find your favorite ice cream flavor
what is it cheese ice cream yes okay so
cheap you should bring that I bring that
to a party yeah Brett we're looking at
the strange ice creams purple yam and
red beans ice cream we have the ubi
queso if I'd no means are we trying to
be offensive to any of the Asian food
here as you guys know fish is a very
strong smell and it is strong here so we
ain't lyin when we're we're like
about you know I need this I need to go
fast why just go fast
yep okay I gotta go fast
oh this is rice I do not know if I could
try some of the stuff
like this salted shrimp sauce it is
literally just a pile of like shrimp
like baby shirt
hi I don't think I could have one of
those these are preserved duck eggs
let's get a close-up shot of that who
wants this black yolk
what is that preserved how old is that
like so it looks like years old
is it like I don't know does it get
better with time or something I never
tried it but it sure doesn't look tasty
yeah most of the stuff in here is in a
different language - so we're trying to
figure out like what exactly all this
stuff is dried Pollack I think that's
probably like a fish but still yeah yeah
see oh yeah like folded up in in the can
will fishy
Digga ladies this is Jeffrey
welcome back to blogs
Oh
what is dried punch in the sea it's like
coral
oh it's like a shell okay

single night by yourself watching
Netflix try bringing home the cuttlefish
it will accompany you during your
favorite Netflix movies walking out
those heinous I've never seen sunglasses
like these look at the little girl in
here not with the Hansen glasses blocked
up you're only a buck two
namaste fly cor just what I needed I was
out of my own walk run hog
that's insane this I've never seen this
type of bathroom before
not one thing I think the Asian culture
does the best is to you they're really
good at almost all their teas are so
good I think they have a tea section
here too dear ladies not a fruit latte
bubble milk little bubbles right Oh
bubble milk tea yeah whoa
have you had pokey this stuff's actually
pretty good a lot of fans have sent us
sent us this stuff like I've tried you
Swan strawberry read this dry and beans
and tomato sauce this is straight to the
point exactly what it is giant beans aha
we found the chips and candy guys we
should find a strange candy chip we
should all try it in the car I agree
this may be one of the things we try
guys fish ball crackers
oh okay we found something else guys I'm
coming scared we're gonna try this sunny
thing it's huge
gosh what is this this is interesting
it's got some beans some fruit there's a
banana in there some more beans and
syrup in syrup huh might be good
we found some drinks too so we're gonna
head to the checkout and we're gonna try
these things I don't know if I should be
nervous or excited or what but I'm both
we have to find a dumpster nearby what
if I have to throw up what do I do
yeah what are we gonna try first I just
say we go for the fish ball can you
pronounce that Keira puck okay
sure what kind of fish is it though um
sigh BM sigh BM fish we haven't had
lunch yet either guys so this might be
bad empties number you okay doesn't
smell that bad
anyone what does it taste like
it's so bad let's write that out of ten
oh gosh wait zero out of ten our rating
scale is based on would we bring this
into the movie theater watch a movie
well first of all you bite into it
you're going to disrupt the whole movie
yeah walk through like I'm not even
asking how they made those so we're just
guessing this is a low water because
there's a low grass plant on here that's
good yeah drink that tastes like your
typical a low mm-hmm I guess I'd bring
that into the movie theater mm-hmm it's
not like insane seven out of ten for me
yes what is this this is gonna smell the
whole no son we got cuttlefish threadfin
bream fish we got seasonings and
whatever else is in here okay it's
seasoned squid guys so you ready but it
smells like fish bait yeah but it smells
like garlic - it's weird it's confusing
well it's the point wait it's got like
why does it make this form
I don't okay you do don't pull it all
off look careful put that in the bag I
do not want none of this on me
oh this is so confusing
seriously I something that disturbs me I
get the goosebumps
oh oh I'm confused because I taste like
garlic and stuff but this is fish I
really don't want to like this I give
that a zero they're trying to make the
fish taste good by putting this like
seasoning on it and it's not no it does
not help very bad what doesn't look
appealing at all let's show you guys
black soy drink I don't know what that
means yeah I have no idea either I don't
this is like a juice box like when I was
a kid yeah when you have your first kid
throw that in their lunchbox yeah did
you know this trick no I didn't this is
like you hold this by this and kids
don't spill it because remember if you
hold it like this it squirts out oh wow
it looks like creamy your turn it's like
cardboard like wet cardboard I'm glad
they had they put on here
