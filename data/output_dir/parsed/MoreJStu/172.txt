look back and more jace new guys hope
you're doing well we're here with our
friend Matt it's gonna help us out with
today's fort which if you watched last
fort friday you'll know what we're doing
today I really I didn't watch last
Friday
oh my you we told you guys if we got
20,000 lights in the last part Friday
that we would do a toilet paper for
restaurant and you guys give us this
many likes so let's let's do it we
already have the menu printed off we'll
do a comprehensive review in the fourth
yeah so let's get going so is this your
first fort my first board you guys
remember remember the hints we've given
you so if you get in the floor quickly
so you're not standing around the island
you could build from the inside out
that's the best tip right so you can
build the walls I love em bur your tree
yeah this is not that good it's so open
maybe over there we're gonna check down
here just to make sure
by the way it's a harder with my hand
guys can leave them in uh-huh but this
is gonna be the entrance to the
restaurant okay good
I'm the first one in the fort I'm gonna
try and clear up some space so we can
all get in here so we can start building
and bail up the walls because we need
two layers hey Andrew
if you guys come in from over there we
can clear out the space okay
hopefully the employee doesn't think
we're being suspicious we got to get
this restaurant open for bids
man just got in safely
now interests to get into danger is
helping fill in the cracks so if people
look in here they can't see us
I'm just trying to clear out this area
which I think you've done a pretty good
job
I bet she's been moving some boxes over
there what's Justin up to he's tall
the next section here show them here's
where I've been building up these walls
and then under here is where the Kleenex
is so if I build a tunnel all the way
over there cuz this is like a big
blockade of a toll paper but I think it
opens up over there so the only way to
get over there is to through the
Underground's
so you don't forget like these kind of
next the tunnel
whoa Tunnel
he's trying to break our walls
who is doing that
I don't see anybody but someone was
there like oh I definitely wasn't you
we're moving down the fort
we're over in the section that I'm in so
the tunnels complete
I created a bed zone right here if we
can get a blanket and pillow this is
like perfect it's like a smaller area
but this area is a little open
unfortunately but it's still cool
you go into the bed majors just making
man how do you like the tongue
it's so fun yeah it's a whole new zone
over here with with a bed almost triple
booked
guys I think it's time to get some
supplies to make the restaurant I'm
ready you make furniture and food chairs
who is it
it was a little version of mr. bean TC
you know I can't get caught the
restaurants not even open yet
don't worry I'm going back through the
tunnel
what was that
I'm through employee yes so this is
gonna be like the main restaurant area
yeah but we're trying to make a little
bit bigger yeah because they have so
it's an overflow huh it's very dark in
here so we're gonna have to light up the
restaurant or our guests aren't gonna be
pleased right they might not be able to
see their food justin's being very
daring i was a customer wrong there I
was taking apart our fault
okay so we are looking for decorations
for the restaurant we found like a table
well that's what we're looking for a
table and this kind of resembles a table
so I'm sure all the tables here are not
small so we got to be innovative right
finding anything that's a good little
table it supports up to 300 pounds of
food yeah we found the service server
plate yes big big restaurant decorations
yeah we wanna only be respectful and
don't get me wrong I think it's
hilarious but
so we can totally clean it up for you
guys entrance come on I know well
straighten it up don't we sure
appreciate you guys offering them you
sure we can do whatever you want
I am positive appreciate you guys
honestly I appreciate you guys
cooperation yeah well bummer
we had a suspicion that they were onto
us like the whole store knew yeah they'd
seen the bits but that like they're
really kind about it and stuff yeah cool
so we're just putting on a stuff back
and oh no the restaurant will just have
to wait till next port Friday yeah you
just got back to the car man I wish we
were pretty close like this close well
we can't always be successful when you
make toilet paper fourths yeah but at
least we tried all the employees
recognized us immediately that's the
problem guys these put toilet paper
videos are very popular amongst the
employees you guys gotta be so famous
man that's still we still can make a
restaurant that means maybe make it even
better next time yes and we found some
new spots for 24-hour events so we came
out with this well some good right
future ideas so even though we didn't
complete it oh we're even more excited
right now for what's to go yeah and a
lot of you are always wanting us to do
24-hour vids but don't worry some more
coming soon okay hope you guys aren't
get appointed that we didn't get to do
this it's okay it's still fun yeah but I
think that's all for the fort Friday
