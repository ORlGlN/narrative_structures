it's about 7 o'clock because in the
morning we have to get up about 3 a.m.
to go to the airport in Denver so I
don't know probably gonna be pretty
tired so I don't know how much I'm gonna
vlog in the morning but as you saw him
yesterday's vlog got a new GoPro the
session I wanted to get this one because
the microphone on it it's all like one
piece so you don't have to take the
GoPro out of its casing to like vlog
with it I have a GoPro 2 which is still
a pretty good GoPro but like I said the
microphone this will be better for vlogs
and stuff so let's go ahead and open it
up here it is the session I remember the
first GoPro I got the GoPro 2 I was so
confused on how to get this off the lid
because I thought there might be like
screws under there I was like huh
how do you do this it's stuck on here
they push the things on the back and
slide it off here's the pole here's the
case got the job ah the charger ready to
go and it comes with these mounts
probably not gonna use these this trip
