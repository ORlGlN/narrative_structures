underneath it but they said I should
wear the gown because they're gonna do
more tests IV stuff but they said I
couldn't leave room say I have to stay
in here but I can walk around the room
so this is fun but the room is pretty
nice
it has bathroom lights shower which is a
very good and sink think I'm going to be
staying a night here at least I don't
know what's going to be happening
I think I'm staying a night no so they
made it seem like I just got to figure
out what's going on because we still
don't have any idea we have an idea of
some things that I may have but yeah
they got to keep doing tests thanks for
all the nice comments though guys a lot
of you have been tweeting and commenting
on my Instagram and means a lot that you
guys care so much so thanks
I do feel better though today than
yesterday's vlog that's for sure
yesterday was just terrible but I think
it's because I've had the ibuprofen and
this other strong pain medicine on top
of the ibuprofen that's why I'm feeling
better like I don't have a headache or
anything but the doctor said my white
blood cells were going down which is not
good so that's why I had to get admitted
here hey guys so I'm pulling at Charles
Trippy and Justin asked me to film a
little bit and so I'm I'm doing this
because he wanted me to or not because I
just love filming myself and him sick
how you doing any I'm feeling a lot
better like I said earlier they are they
did what I was trying to say they did at
IV they tried to put an IV in my arm but
no none of my veins were coming up so
they they gave me like they tried three
different times with thick needles and
they all failed so it hurt
he's running really bad and so we just
don't know this is like what we think it
is so we're not entirely sure which is
not very doesn't make us feel better
because you know I kind of wish it was
just like the flu cuz I know it's gonna
be I know what that is but that's do it
it looks like he threw out to rob a bank
laughing oh oh well guys it's now 1:00
a.m. they gave me five different or five
shots in my arms to try and get the IV
in me but they couldn't find the veins
so it's pretty painful honestly five
different shots like I think a couple in
this arm so they've been trying but
we've been waiting for awhile and they
say they my tap they're having somebody
who is really good at it
but they're gonna have to probably wake
us up so we're gonna get some rest but I
