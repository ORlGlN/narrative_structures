good morning guys guess what we're doing
today alright right now yeah we're
eating it's 1:30 and we've been thinking
so a lot of you have probably been to
Chipotle and if you're like me you're
confused why they do not have queso so
what we did is we just stop buying Qdoba
and got a little bowl of queso and right
now we're driving over to Chipotle and
getting food and putting the case out in
the burrito and seeing how perfect it is
I feel like if Chipotle would just get
casing kotoba would be out of business
if we're being honest the reason why
we're not just eating at Qdoba is
because Chipotle is like a thousand
times better for being honest
here we are folks I got the burrito got
the queso here Brittany got a bowl
whoa okay we just happen to pull a hand
together I just gotta say that was so
delicious if you guys got the spare time
to try that out you won't be let down
let me tell you that much I'm so full
though now are we gonna do the rest of
the day Brit well I really after that
kind of meal I really wanted to just
like go on a walk or take easy and toss
her in the lake look want a bike ride
