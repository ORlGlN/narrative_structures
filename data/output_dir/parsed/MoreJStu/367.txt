what's up everybody welcome back to
another Bubble Ball video who's that I
was thinking the other day what Bubble
Ball video could we make that we haven't
done before that's going to be pretty
funny and then I thought paintball-gun
we're not sure if the paintball gun is
just going to shoot right through the
bubble ball it probably will so I don't
recommend doing this at home but we
figured if we're far enough away then it
might be funny my friend Alec let us
borrow his paintball gun so here's the
gun
whoa pretty solid and there's some balls
and a hopper but there's no co2 tank so
we're going to go to the store and get
that real quick
all right bubble ball are you ready
let's get in the car
Aaron brought some spare clothes good
idea yeah so are you going in the bubble
ball first no we bought a pump for this
thing but I cannot find it anywhere I
put it in the same spot all the time in
my garage and for some reason it's just
not there so I don't know what happened
to it so I'm going to blow this up with
my mouth and Aaron can't help blow it up
unless I'm desperate for mono which I
think I'll pass
I say so yeah
haha heads just hard these bubble balls
have been through a lot
they went sliding down half pipes uh
hover hover boards trying to be filled
up with helium sand dunes dry ice boat
yeah the pool
if this survives the paintball adventure
this thing you know might as well just
use this body armor for whatever you
want almost there Oh bubble ball is
fully inflated do you ever like inflate
something for a long time and then your
face just feels so numb yeah I can't
even like really talk as my lips like
yeah let's go get our spot
so at this camera we're gonna try and do
some slo-moes GoPro this head I think
we're just gonna shoot for fun that's
target practice yeah
target practice but I think the goal for
this video
I bought green paintballs because I
think there's already some blue ones in
there I just think it'd be cool if this
was like different colors and I guess
we'll see if it survives getting shot
with a paintball and then we can run
around and be protected this is the spot
we're going to play with the paintball
gun because this ravine has like a good
wall just in case some paintballs go
astray I'm not going to do anything
how does this come forth with show me my
moves
that thing's huge should you test shot
okay safety on okay
ah it makes up Green in blue balls yes
now for some balloons
alright we should probably put our masks
on all right I'm going to set up this
slow-mo camera right over there and I'm
gonna stand over there Erin's gonna
shoot from here right huh yeah all right
let's do this camera set up and we just
learned that those blue ones are
actually orange nice so we have green
and orange orange goes at the ball
all right but first we gotta do a test
shot with a Steph here you got them all
right safety on
I think you hit him right in the ear
we're doing one more test you got him oh
yeah you got him you got him right in
the mouth all right
thanks Miguel all right that blast has
to get into the ball I'm gonna blast him
okay
all right first person Gani huh now
Aaron's gonna get in the bubble bowl
it's such a weird sound Plus Aaron was
saying like half the time the balls
don't even like splat on it it just
bounced off are you so funny if you saw
like a whole like squad of people
playing paintball with bubble balls ah
all right Aaron here we go
so funny gonna run across the river
getting shot at all right stay back your
beast whoa look at it
that's pretty cool-looking though orange
ones aren't splatting on it it's weird
it's only the green ones all right I'm
gonna put this on it what's going on
over there
hello just not working right that's a
brand new tank that shouldn't be dead
already
all right I fixed the gun I'm gonna put
this over here
there's actually a hole now yes I heard
it like hit did I came the whole thing's
like sounds like wall hate to find the
hole where is it part of the paintballs
inside the ball what let me show you
look you can see part of the paintball
shells in the ball
we're soul no word uh I don't know where
it is quick it's dying fast
it's not gonna be protection anymore
where the hole is though I don't see the
hole my house and I was just in there
and I heard it go - well we found bubble
balls limits yeah that might have been
too close for the bubble ball
we were like experimenting we were
farther away when getting a little bit
closer but it's dead now
oh sorry ball we're gonna let William
here float down the river
getting shot at goodbye old friend there
he goes he's going where he's getting
away
oh that went right through the bags man
really ouch buddy he got shot in the
neck oh we should rename him to Wilson
well son no no come here oh gee he's got
a bullet still in his brain
do you have a headache dude where's
those bad guys ah he's in the river
Wow he's got some problems there's one
unexploded just lodged in his trachea
unexploded right in throat like that one
that one exploded I think that your shot
on the other side is pretty funny listen
