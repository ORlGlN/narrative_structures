well good afternoon everybody and
welcome back to more gays to everyone
having a good day I am I am well today
we have a fun random goofy idea for you
guys
Andrew you came up to this video let's
hear the explanation for so um girls out
there are always telling boys that need
to understand what it's like to wear
high heels and hélio so we're going to
do a challenge today we're going to are
some high heels and do an obstacle
course I mean high yields don't look
that challenging but obviously I've
never tried them on before yeah me
either so I thought this would be a
funny challenge so let's go inside get
something else the biggest ones I got
this is going to be awkward okay this is
the sure you know how do you figure out
what size is is where oh gosh I don't
think my size of those I don't know it
doesn't even say you should I try okay
yes I'll try I think my foots going to
do this lexis impossible but that would
be something sorry
it's all really either interview thank
you did you find something different a
hand with your sock on oh my gosh little
awkward you had to try wash the things
we do for you to check out this pair Oh
either one that one's just interesting
break my ankle those are huge oh ah why
would you why it's always like how long
is this one I don't know because this is
the pair I picked off up that was pretty
big but no yeah people walked by it
give us some strange works
okay guys so we just got to the park and
for the first challenge we want to do a
park obstacle course we think that would
be hilarious those things right behind
you - oh yeah but there's like a rock
wall over here we can climb up it's just
going to be insane I think it's gonna be
really funny I saw some other youtubers
have done this challenge some other guys
and it was actually pretty funny but boy
oh boy is it awkward but we just have no
problem doing this because you know
we're awkward guys in general with our
pranks ain't that right
okay so who's gonna start me or you
I'll start okay get the shoes also I
know you're supposed to take your socks
off but these are from Goodwill and I
don't want my feet touching no nasty
stuff agreed so it's just going on like
that okay okay I want to see you just do
some walking before you begin this
challenge because this is here this is
because there's people over there
they're going to make fun of us dude
yeah we're doing like an obstacle course
you want to join oh that's okay leave it
to us this hurts I know okay like where
do you put your weight like on your toes
dude I have zero answers for you okay so
let's start the off the ground it's so
squishy
here's we're going to start the obstacle
all right swear well it depends on how
long we want to make this course do
should we do it kind of short yeah okay
maybe we can do a quick walk over here
climb over this like this is going to
wreck okay maybe not do that we don't
want to get injured guys we can start on
this thing you have to run up it run up
this cross the bridge and go down big
slide
rockwall yeah okay alright that's what
we're going to do we'll have a timer on
the screen and we'll see who can do it
fast from your Andrew don't get Andrew

you ready yeah wait sir yes Scott all
right let's get the timer up all right
bro give a countdown you one go speed is
an essence there drew come on almost
done right at the rock wall I'm going to
get both heels at the top of your time
stops time impressive not bad
I mean I was kind of scared on those
that's why I started a little slow yeah
get my footing right but okay let me get
it go you up next how they feeling bud
annoying
the heels are like sitting in the new
stop yeah
alright honey alright countdown 1 hurry
hurry go boy come on up the wall my
shoes before oh come on Michael
this might be hard with one hand but can
he do it go go go jump to the next piece
jump with your other arm there you go
yeah okay oh I get extra credit for
doing it with one hand basically we'll
give you a five-second handicap yeah oh
gosh yeah it probably would have been a
good idea
I just love this kind of thing because
you got a really not really kid you have
to have no cares what other people think
about you oh this is really weird on
solid surface now huh okay you guys are
like kind of impressed or not really oh
