hey guys you already know what day it is
it's for Friday
welcome back hope you're doing superb
cuz we are oh yeah so today we're gonna
build a fort a classic fort I don't know
what's gonna happen but it's gonna be a
fort let's go inside and see what we can
do where do we go where do we go
come to this way so we're looking around
to just scope out the options that's
what we always do because there's so
many good spots in stores but right here
that could work right back there it's
very open
there's boxes we can use but I got so
many Christmas stuff already up I know
what we're not gonna settle for this
we're gonna try and find the best area
okay we're in another classic area the
baby diaper forts this is great cuz
these are like little building blocks
yeah that's why these are easy these
sports he's eating his foot yeah this
one's two stories easy pretty big okay
she was behind us guys the ultra classic
you think it funny don't you bro sorry
anyways this was pretty cool well this
is pretty cool because there's a wall in
the back so you only had to worry about
the front of the fort being destroyed by
employees yeah so this might work it's a
huge row as well
looks like somebody has built the floor
right there beautiful wall
Tibbits pretty full yeah but you can
look see there's more upstairs that's
where you can put it one thing about
this section two is look the walls
literally go up to the top it's and it
doesn't look suspicious this is just how
it is
I fell off the walls this one's right by
the main aisle so yeah get in here bro
this is perfect Oh - here hold this I
love this for dude this huh this wall
just makes it better I love it cuz we
only have to worry about this now not
this side and we wanted to get into the
floor as fast as possible because when
you're in the aisles it gets way too
suspicious fast yeah so
because I was Gary so this is cool kiz'
look over here we got the Kleenex
section I want to make a tunnel to the
other side now we have an opening where
we can make a tunnel it's gonna be kind
of difficult but oh well Andrew just
gave you guys great advice whenever you
face difficulty the answer is oh well oh
well I just do it yeah yeah
so it'd be an epic tunnel hopefully just
fixed one side note this is the only bad
thing about this fort is we only got one
layer of wall so if somebody comes by
and takes the toilet paper we're gonna
have to duck quick yeah we duck but then
we've got extra supply so we can
reinforce after yeah so we're gonna get
this tone going so we expanding we need
a rug to put on this this is very hard
to army crawl and herseif him in the
tunnel
we've got villains out here
many villains huh as part of the tunnel
to get these out the way and then
they're talking about our videos no way
yeah what do you say he said yes I
sometimes people build forts in the
toilet paper section you like they get
pretty creative
oh yes this is like a battlefield it's
painful
they'll see us under here
I gonna have to get out maybe get some
rugs but fix the toilet paper over there
so we can actually make this tall work
or out safely view first and foremost we
got some rugs comfort level has been
upgraded what you got there this is a
dog bed why hurt Oh for comfort good not
for dogs for us okay we're making the
adjustments to this side yes gosh
answers already in the four I can't get
in the four days people should come down
this aisle nervous
the doors right where they are
okay
check you guys we got a runway now and
are getting the beds the comfy cushions
into the new room and expand
this rug literally makes all the
difference if we did a 24-hour bed right
here would be the perfect place to sleep
I don't think they'd do tons of Kleenex
for stock restocking but just check out
and look since she just took that one we
can easily move stuff forward so they
can't still can't see us
I mean the toilet paper section there's
not much room in here though we're gonna
have to escalate a lot of stuff
it's puffin spycam what you do
I pushed a little too hard and it flying
out the other end show it I was pushing
here is trying to get this to fit you
heard a sound I don't know what it looks
like
coffee no four rolls cover up the whole
aisle
jeromy's
I accidentally pushed it over again what
would that woman say she said that
usually happens to me it just all falls
down how's it looking down there
yes we've connected the tunnels now it's
time to move in now this is the life
guys I am so happy that we didn't get
caught yet especially since Andrew
knocked over all the toilet paper yeah
man and I'm gonna be honest one of the
hardest parts we haven't got done yet
because I want right there sorry anyways
we need to get a thumbnail for this
video you guys usually don't see that
but if we don't get a good thumbnail
then you guys wouldn't watch this
and pull you right there stocking
Halloween candy there's two of them I'm
in the tunnel we were trying to make a
double-decker but you gave up hurts just
do it for the vlog dude just please I
can't even move ah everybody wants to
see it really yeah I can just go up here
yeah that's not the point
stuck level-1 level-2
remember if it's difficult oh well just
don't step on me
if this doesn't move it's good see this
is a good clip guys that's a thumbnail
leave a like for this clip it took 45
minutes it's hard to get down from here
it's hard to tell if this clip is like
upside down right side up like what's
going on in this clip no it was for the
because he's so mad that you guys made
him do that
be kind of funny if someone parked that
cart right here and then when they're
not looking you can put a Kleenex in
their cart without them noticing it
would be the best if we could complete
that challenge let's just wait a second
see if someone comes and we can try
you're perfect
we have to make it it's the challenge
you have to get it into the cart perhaps
we're good
oh yes
yeah no wait
darn it you almost made it it's right
there
what
go ahead
what's happening
we're making a full escape there in the
fort oh yeah
great
he's moving stuff over here he's
blocking man transfer there's one thing
Kirk cannot stand it is an incompetent
bumbling sloppy fast-food employee so
you start stacking it right here
come on I don't think they know we're in
here don't
how are they not honest should we just
go hello we haven't got caught yet this
is the most insane I don't know where
stop should we started anything that's
like over there you like what you say
he keeps peeking out he was literally
about to come in here
oh don't leave me no way yes you need to
get a cart I'll stay here insane guys I
could have swore they were gonna catch
us now our final mission is to put put
back the stuff we got in here and then
this is gonna be the craziest to look at
before episode oh yes
what these are the employees that were
in the fort and they just came back with
a huge stocks of pot now we got to
return it safely
he's restocking they brought all those
boxes we'd be stuck in there for days
and look their kids all buy it now - I
don't know how we don't get caught that
was the best guys leave a like if it
weren't for that tunnel and then
blocking off the entrance of the tunnel
so they couldn't see us
oh man they would have found us what the
Great Escape
leave a like yep and we'll see you back
