good morning everybody welcome back to
the last day on the cruise ship
something happened to me yesterday I'm
not sure what happened but my heel it
hurts so bad right here
say swollen - I can't really walk on it
thank out so we're going to go down to
the medical place and see if they have
some ibuprofen or something because it
hurts we've got some ibuprofen lots of
pills let's do it
donut yes last day for breakfast with
this view it's time to play some
ping-pong so I want one game Harry won a
game but the captain just said he saw
something in the water so he's turning
the boat around to go see what it was
so it might be a piece of wood I'm not
sure so he's going to take a look
you can see our path we're slowly making
a right turn here I can kind of see it
it's that white dot over there we're
investigating what is it
instead a raft Mary looks like it well
captain said that it was a raft but the
Coast Guard is going to get in the water
and examine it and we're going to keep
going on our vacation so mystery is
still unsolved but it's a little closer
to being solved I was just thinking how
nuts it would be if someone was like on
the raft like Oh like I wouldn't
actually want that to happen cuz I'd be
sad but I do that'd be cool we found
someone we rescued them but it didn't
look like there's anybody on it you guys
should leave a comment down below of how
you think this raft got in the middle of
the ocean can be funny serious but I
want to see some school stories and how
this man or woman or whatever you guys
decide how did it get here
