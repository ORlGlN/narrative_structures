good morning Marge a stool fan BAM
how's it going well we are going to
chick-fil-a right now but we had to park
way over here and chick-fil-a is right
there because that's how busy this
chick-fil-a is chick-fil-a's are always
like insane busy but makes sense really
good we're going here because this is
grilled chicken sandwich with bacon
yes spicy that's good this is where the
drive-thru line starts go away around Z
Beauty got a table dad yeah I might
really far away from the table so it
kind of sucks but this is the weirdest
oh oh
bacon yes
you know okay so one of the employees
just came and took our food and I just
asked him he's like is there anything
else he does boy I was like are there
free food refills and then he paused for
a second said I don't know let me go
check so he's going to check right now
if he brings us back free food he's at
the mixer just going back with there's
free food I'll be so happy oh well
doesn't happen a lot but I understand
well if you always want to meet me so
Wow guys oh my god I'm just telling
Andrew I have literally asked that two
employees like four years probably like
when they say anything else are there
free food free throws and finally
something's happening so you want to
split it yeah hey guys
you see this is what separates
chick-fil-a from the rest of all these
other food joints they're just so kind
and just give out free sandwiches and
look their lines are so packed it's just
that thing is that Universal property
there if you're willing to give food to
get more business you know and a point I
thought
guys ask and you shall receive you don't
ask for something in life how do you
expect to get it sometimes you might not
get it but finally I ask we get a free
sandwich maybe ask guys yeah I just have
a free sandwich we fill in there by
shooter what did you just inform me on
the Best Buy if you are an elite member
or premium elite member they have deals
now they're like pre Black Friday deals
so you don't have to like if you want a
TV it often wait until Black Friday to
get that TV exactly so we're seeing if
they're in store because I only look at
it on the internet yeah yeah we're both
elite members so yeah we're trying out
the new guitar era I think it sucks
I just tried for like two seconds but
this is I play Lefty
this is weird though look at the new
Guitar Hero's it doesn't have the long
one anymore it's like the
hey I'd be better if it was on let me
know how you do lefty it's too hard man
cuz you wanna know a secret
why I broke my finger when I was in high
school and I was too desperate that I
had learned to play lefty mode
what now can't play right really yeah oh
I was like you're right-handed so I know
but I learned how to play left-handed
oh crap guys he's coming back from
sector five everybody head to quarter
two taking my mouse is glitching a 49
inch 4k for 500 bucks
normally 900 that's a pretty good deal
right now folks then they also have a 55
inch 4k for $1600 off whoa Oh what is
that I have one of these PlayStation
things yes
quick question guys so this TV we just
showed you 49 inches 4k for 500 then you
walk right over here and this one's 50
inches but not 4k it's 1080p for 430 so
why would anyone get this when you can
pay what it's $60 more for a 4k TV and
that's LG vs. sharp child music
good as for don't not get sharp we're
home who wants to guess what Aaron's
doing I read I win ah how did you know
Aaron all right it's like the Batcave in
here
I can't see anything it's time for nerf
zones or we're doing nerf challenges
featuring the real-life
Aaron bug guys we found a new nerf gun
that aaron has never opened yet so stay
tuned for an unboxing sister segment
with one of the intros you guys made
we've gotten like we've got like six
different intros that you guys have sent
us so I'll use them all eventually but
this one will start it off yeah we're
getting ready to go try out the nerf all
these nerf guns and compare them to the
rival and do some challenges so let's go
ahh it's time to discover it's time to
play
so let's get started Wow we are nerfed
out yeah this is a gun we haven't shown
you yet this isn't even nerf so one
great thing about the mech Tommy 20 is
the bullets will fall out if you don't
put it the right way great yes we have
made it to the rampart High School nerf
turf sorry turf field with our nurse
nerf turf field and we're going to be
doing some epic tests I think it's what
is Erin doing by the way nice we're
gonna try and do some like cool trick
shots through the tires but let's start
off with a quick unboxing sisters cue
the intro this is the nerf maverick and
for some reason if you look closely
there is dust and stuff all over this
except the spiderwebs for some reason
Erin never open this present from mom
cheese how long have you had this you
know he's a nerf havoc so yeah I mean
 yesterday this was maybe an
emergency nerf gun like all else fails
yes so we got the straps undone and
pulling it out of the box
what wow this is like crazy this is like
a real tell you load it now you push
this button and it flip flips out
all right this is like olden days like
Westerner style light-bot yep basically
and we will load it up right what
where's the bullet there he is
all right who's ready to fire
let's do a quick first a firefighter
webs all over me
the first test shoot that sounds so like
the spring is so even moving okay no
keep going keep going but does it listen
to nerf attic ah just take a couple
truck that was nerf roulette but this is
the nerf maverick flip out magazine okay
when you can spin it walk it in
you don't know who when it's gonna shoot
surprise your friends see I give this a
2 out of 10 yeah I gave this a 1 out of
10 thank you guys for watching today's
episode of the unboxing sisters and we
love it now back to the Regular Show
Oh Clifford wants to run on the top of
this maybe I can maybe I can no my vote
is you can't and this will be a funny
vlog oh you think you could doubt me I
am doubting you
oh really yep
it's a stand up hold on it needs to slow
down you need to stand up or this is not
good
but it didn't it didn't it didn't it
Lily to Daniel yeah I could do it don't
doubt me what are we doing first
the first test is the distance test put
one foot on this life-extension white
we're gonna see out of all the guns we
have which gun shoots farthest and which
guns suck which most of them probably
will suck we're ready to fire and I'll
go put this gun next to the pool oh
that's a good idea
next the Raider cs35 very powerful a
little further also we forgot a very
crucial rule our earmuffs and safety
goggle
we don't want to have any accidents
I got barely here with youth on I know
me too
this is the MEC Tommy 20 the dark broke
ok redo all right retry oh not bad
alright Aaron's trying what is this gun
this is the half water gun half nerf gun
hey it beat beat it and beat it alright
but the heads down came shorter though
that's because it ran out of power
towards the end you ready
yeah oh yeah
jeez Andrew come on hello oh okay not
bad okay for the final gun alright
my did want you guys to keep in mind
that none of these got guns are modded
these are basic starter okay are you
lost and loaded yeah don't do that guys
ready ready go
thing okay so for review we have this
first set of gun which goes no more than
10 yards
it's the suckiest of all guns we have
their next group of guns which are all
in the 15-yard range now 5:30 about 33
about 33 yards how much better this gun
has the numbers in case those Duke guns
are way back there so now that we have
the distance tests with move armed with
a challenge or something hit object off
head here's the first test we're
shooting a cup off your head I just hold
it you there's gotta be a way to get to
stay he got the cup off oh I am shooting
Andrew a new object it's really wink we
decided to move up a few yards to make
it a little bit easier you get to cover
your mouth this time just in case it
hurts bad
all right go oh that's a good shot Aaron
Justin's turn right enough since it's so
hard to aim with this thing I looked
like I was pointing right at the cup for
the can but I hate you right there look
at her just for a second oh this is a
really good idea so we're just going to
see how powerful this nerf gun is up
close point-blank so we're doing
point-blank nipple shots one
he's gonna shoot it up in the air we're
gonna try and catch
Oh Kobe Oh almost come on
ah see it's hard you get it nice can
pretty much fit in there dude hey give
them the push forward it hurt
the does odd so you can't go forward one
turn yo just keep going till he says
stop
man why is shooting nerf guns so fun no
we're definitely gonna do more though so
if you guys send us a tweet or commented
a challenge you want to see us do we
didn't do it we own these guns so we can
do the challenges whenever we want so
just stay tuned with the wifey now are
you excited to get some blood drawn once
so as you guys know I recently had
dengue fever from our Hawaii trip which
was not fun and so basically the
Hawaiian Department of Health wants
Brittney to get her blood drawn to see
if she had been gay fever as well and
they said that you can actually have
dengue fever not having any symptoms
thank you
which I don't really get how can you
have that and I have any symptoms find
out we're in the laboratory how do you
feel
but Brittney it will be fast don't be
afraid Sesame Street come on that
that is awesome Missa squishy things
every time we bring you here baby we
pretended it has crime no doubt the shot
goes oh I remember I don't know if I
talked too much about what my experience
was like when I was in the hospital
recently with dengue I got like 12
different shots or 12 songs and they
hurt they were like the bigger needles
to take my blood and then the worst part
that was more painful than the shots was
they used like super glue tape to keep
the IV in my arm and they'd be like rip
it off my arm and it hurts so bad
I was so confused why they put like that
tape
like I yeah
so I just got to say hospitals need to
figure out something that's not super
glue tape so you just rip off every cell
particle on your arm why hello mr. bunny
oh what the Pooh is that mr. Bunny's

cooking salmon potatoes asparagus you
