we have a break for ha ha
perfect timing the parade is over and
now we are going to two speakeasy what's
in speakeasy speak you see in the 1920s
Rin little history lesson the 1920s
there's something called the Prohibition
where alcohol is illegal so they meet
these little bars some of them still
exist today they're becoming a new trend
so there's a bunch of hidden bars called
speakeasies I'm on a log we're basically
going to check it out because it's like
it's so cool because it's like they
don't they think it's a tailor shop
yeah we'll show you we're almost there
but it's not like advertised online
there's no sign that says hey we're a
speakeasy we're a bar come come in I'll
show you right over there
okay so you're walking down here and you
come across this you come right here
open the door it looks like a tailor
shop but it's not
please ring bell for service
I feel like I'm in Kings me or something
so here it is dirty epic nice outfit
swag
okay so we're checking out another one
pretty cool stuff
and even so where is this one located
below the blue light what yeah dude
that's so cool it's like a secret
hideout oh it's quiet here right here
well folks we are back home was a pretty
chill night for sure breads are always
fun but I'm thinking next year it would
be so funny if we could just randomly be
in a parade I don't know we'll see what
happens but yeah I think we are gonna go
to bed it's almost 10:00 kind of early
night we're all sleepy and we're gonna
get up and watch a sermon I don't know
if I don't know if I've told you guys
yet but I think I think I've told you
before but usually on Sundays me and
Brittany watch out online sermon of
elevation Church with Steven Furtick
that's like our favorite Church to watch
so if any of you are wanting to get into
watching sermons or looking for someone
new to watch I would definitely
recommend Elevation Church and you can
check out their lives that are live
streams on their website I think its
elevation network comm they do their
live streams it's worked for us and it's
really helped me out honestly in life
his teachings so if that's something
you're looking for that's what I
recommend forgot to film an ending as
usual so I just wanted to end the vlog

way if you guys didn't know bald
