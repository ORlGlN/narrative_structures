more vibrant with lights and fun things
to tell the camera about Mickey Mouse
know when we were driving up there was a
guy in a Mickey Mouse costume and he
lifted up his mask and started smoking
you cannot wait until the jaw until
after this I guess I gotta take a
quick break
just give me a minute inside the Mirage
Hotel right now
this is just the inside mister Gigantor
fish tank
ouch sir
I wish it had stuff like this in every
state
the hotel like this in Colorado it would
be awesome this lounge here has AI seats
inside the letters
so cool
Wow
was this thing called whoa the beetles
gear out the wazoo
that thing it is kind of sad though
walking around there's people like
giving out weird things
yeah the city needs lots of prayer
precious all it is
oh you've got that right but I just
think it was always I was kind of
sketchy coming here at first just cuz it
was called Sin City I think why would a
city wanna be called something like that
just makes me sad
