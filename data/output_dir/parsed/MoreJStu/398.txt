what's up guys welcome back to vlogs hey
guys
we're back at Walmart and this time we
got Aaron with us master fort builder
and we're going to do something really
fun we're at a different Walmart so
hopefully we can get some good stuff for
you guys so I want to say thank you guys
for leaving all of these comments you
guys obviously want to want it to see us
do a water bottle for it so yeah we are
doing it we gave you a little test in
the last 40 but we're gonna try and make
this at the ultimate water bottle fort
great guys how on earth are you going to
build the foot this we can either really
try it hard or stroller for it I pretty
sure we don't have enough room it's so
full stroller for it okay let's go see
where are we are in diapers section oh
goodness
this is kind of a cool fort if we can
make it work diapers so we have to build
up the walls and then back here we can
do for it the walls are looking great so
far guys
what's great about the diaper aisle is
you've got diapers on this side in this
side so we can make double fort Erin and
I are work on this side well James is in
there playing with the diapers I am in
the fort guys
it smells like diapers in here I guess I
gotta expand a little more though see
right here it's just this is the only
area so far and there they are Andrew
and Aaron are building the other side so
we can have you know a little community
of diaper forts Oh what are you guys
doing over there expansion is going this
way
because we got a wall over here which is
perfect the only problem about these
forces we can't double wall them so if
somebody takes this I will be exposed
and scene welcome to the diaper fort
rearing coming what was that
just please back here huh turn that damn
light off why there's people sorry
if she pulled out from here
so intense if you were to kill a be
scary oh and then if she saw it she
freaked out
yeah but believe she took home but
didn't see a screw long way down
oh yeah look at Epic how does the other
side look it looks good if you haven't
gone in yet though should we do that
another we often hear yeah we have to
expand the city some lady just took this
piece okay your job Dave she was just
literally right here came and took this
I guess you can't really see but my head
was like right there yeah hold this
though mm-hmm I guess you wouldn't see
unless you really are looking yeah yeah
this is way more intensive feeling other
times
yeah but it's really fun but we have
this high we need to explore so andrew
is expanding as you see it in the new
other side so I'm gonna go look for like
