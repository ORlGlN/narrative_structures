howdy everybody welcome back to vlogs
it's still snowing over here in Colorado
so today we want to try something we've
been wanting to try for a while
explain yourself um we want to take
their bounce castle blow it up and go
down a hill sledding
style but snow starting to melt we got
to go quick yeah you can still see the
snow out here but blue skies now will
work find out today but we have taken
the bounce castle on a lake because
they're like trying to think of what
else could we do with this thing go
sledding Oh Buford do you like this no
all right so we have two of these bounce
houses one of them is the one we broke
the other one is the one we took in the
lake think it's almost got the tape on
it so this might be the one we used on
the lake this yeah that's where we were
trying to fill up the pre-made holes
yeah this is out of here oh sure
what are you doing Oh
 Oh No get it okay yeah okay we just
got to a sliding hill and oops like some
people are already having fun I don't
know what kind of car that is but yeah
the heck I do buggy there's a bunch of
bros over here they beat us to it
turn it relate to the party but I'm
gonna be holy cow it's cool they're
gonna be super jealous of our bounced
house yeah maybe they'll let us attach
it to the car
holy cow that'd be funny and fun yeah
well we have a problem guys
one hole and two hole ah why you have
holes everyone art is already here
sliding as well
oh man if you don't fix these holes do
never gonna have fun yeah
lighting in that yeah yeah fast but we
have two holes in it though bro oh I
know what you guys can try what let's
try
we've been being pulled in like the
Miata over there there we added some
tape gonna blow it up again and see if
it works otherwise no just stop back at
their house and we put the other
bouncing this one if you remember the
bottom just doesn't inflate which is
fine and what do you got here a donut
Hey
so that we can put underneath that let's
go back it's working we got the walls up
now it's gotta blow up the inside it's
just
it's not good that we ripped the bottom
of this part like the main interior so
it's just like slowly deflate so we'll
just have to blow it up like as we go to
keep deflating but it's better than the
other ones finished ah yes so first we
can try it on the hill to see how it
moves in this okay sounds good
it looks slippery I think they're gonna
give us a boost yeah you guys are gonna
give us a boost you guys are going far I
just know that okay I'm getting out
ah that was fun though yeah that was
good for the first time yeah thought of
a fun idea so we got it up to the more
steep part but the only downside about
this Hill is there's a fence at the end
so andr is gonna run and dive in here
and give himself like a push go
Oh Mykel homie he's gonna ride me to the
fence you okay dude that looked like it
hurt
is it broken can't find it
oh there it is there's a little guy hole
not bad yeah okay we got an opening over
here so I'm going to jump now
oh it's the best
sled ever barely missed the pole that
was a good maneuver feel like a captain
on a ship going down that hill yeah
iceberg charge draw your swords attack
so the bros with the car with the tow
rope left before we can play with them
so we have to do it ourselves
here's the tow rope and there's the
bounce house oh you're gonna be taking
the maiden voyage eh yeah off to the
seven seas of the goulash excellent I
hope I can hold this tight enough with
one hand okay
Oh ah this is so hard to hold okay we
got tied up
yeah hope this works
I'm sliding
wait
ah
whoa crap that is awesome
there's a car behind you
get all situated here all right we're
winding up
oh boy no that was so fun
oh how was it looks like they're a new
bounce house more snow and more friends
yeah we had a bunch of people in here
that'd be sweet yeah I'd like to fill
this out of people I'll be so funny he's
fun yeah whoa back home from the
sledding adventure that was awesome that
bounce house sure comes in handy we're
gonna have to get like a giant one or
another one cuz these holes in the
bounce house are really annoying and
