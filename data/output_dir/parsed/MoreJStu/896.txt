degrees outside but I'm gonna make one
point but Justin broke the law and
perked in two spots I don't care

law matter they're all gonna unsubscribe
as you're a law breaker I was just I was
just wondering if you could make me
laugh no you can't no oh why not okay
we're going back to the old roots of JC
sujes and it involves toilet paper
what do you do right in the gonads I'm
sorry I shouldn't have thrown it at me
then jeez ah this always happens in
other news we're gonna make it toilet
paper for it and you're coming with us
so let's begin where should we start
okay so the first step to building a
massive toilet paper for is to guard all
the walls will pull the paper so anybody
walking by cannot see inside - what the
you are doing as you can see we have
done a pretty good job here okay we're
in the fort but you gotta be quiet
because people may see us
so we're making good progress Andrew
went outside and he felt the tops with
toilet paper some people can't see
it's getting pretty big
Shh
Andrew idiot and you just blew a hole in
our cover
looks like we've made some good progress
here yeah that back wall is finally
fortified I can't see him yes this is
the lounge room
what is this room this is like that we
have a platform here that will be the
kitchen tables this is like mainly the
table has it now we have a nice Sun roof
here
all right this is the last bedroom area
because if he rolls in there up against
a wall so you can lean on them there's a
separator you're in a separator so this
is my bed that's his bed and right now
we're giving snapchat tours if you
follow us on snapchat you you get
previews before the block deck the
snapchat is like instant vlog status
basically see you at it be all somebody
just took a piece of our fort

beat right freakin here they just took
it so that's about it guys let us know
in the comments if you want to see us to
do another toilet paper for it make it
bigger
or just yeah it's like a whole Isleworth
of this stuff so you should try it
yourself it's pretty fun yeah do have a
signing here attention
Associated Press rise do not climb on or
in the stupid racks

you relieve me now to make sure the
coast is clear
