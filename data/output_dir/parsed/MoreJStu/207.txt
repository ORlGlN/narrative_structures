yeah what is it April
yeah no it's May me there we got snow
and me here's some caves down there
probably it
hey did you find anything down there Oh
pitiful opening all right
so this we're trying to find new caves
that haven't been explored yet because
that one we just went to he's been to
before button there's endless
possibilities here with the cave systems
obviously that one
there's ropes in there so probably
wouldn't do that if there weren't those
ropes in it go with somebody who knows
what they're doing has been cave you
know exploring before walking dig what
this little hole it opens up but I'm not
gonna be able to squeeze through that
thing oh yeah then maybe not every tiny
okay so I think these guys found a new
cave then try and explore it yeah he's
ready down there he is yeah well I don't
how you monkeys get around the sign
that's become act like hey what what
that a good thing oh are you stuck boy
you come up to the room
in here alright nevermind but just put
on your headgear like this and that's
how you begin to explore out okay so the
cool thing when we're exploring or if
you find an area like this say we got
lost
it's really hot out and like when we're
walking through these rocks they're like
blast of cold air because the river is
so cold down here but you can just tell
like that there are openings because
everybody walk it's like you can feel
this breathe even right here so it's
pretty cool but we haven't had any luck
yet haven't found a new case we're still
looking
you found the source this is where it
out pours nut OMG what
Wow what'd you say it's all fish in here
no way Wow make sure the iPhones in
there like an iceberg yes there's a lot
of dead trees and stuff so we decided to
make a fire
be perfect right next to the yeah I
think it's out of control we go

what ya smoking me
going to have dinner just in case we're
stuck out here got water fire fish what
