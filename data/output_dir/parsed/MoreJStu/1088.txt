don't look at the camera look over here
me Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a
very shiny nose
all right look over here scowl and he's
really cool because he takes presents to
all of the wha-what Oh Christmas
Christmas is really when you go for the
door no Andrew that's Halloween answer
the question
Christmas is
jingle bells jingle bells Batman smells
Robin laid every day sing one line I've
seen them one time dad came down and ate
all the cookies he left down you see
Santa has like a list for nice nice kids
and that the bad ones
and if you're on his good list he comes
in a sleigh and oh crap okay merry
Christmas to all you know what if I
wasn't here you better step that's why I
made up this out okay
in the claws mom got me a video game one
time for Christmas it was the best
always says I'm on the naughty list
but I still get weirder for Christmas
time friend it's when I get a meet the
real-life Darth Vader for Christmas
