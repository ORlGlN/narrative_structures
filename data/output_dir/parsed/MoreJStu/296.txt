was a boy scout once they learn the many
ways of building fires this is one of
the best ways to do it with Christmas
paper when Christmas paper and you see
how like the flames turn different
colors because of the paper so it
becomes a magical Christmas fire can you
see that it's good yeah this is fun it
has to be toxic look at that probably is
but usually don't put your face in front
of the fire so it's like it's okay
yeah

wrapped it so um I bought myself that's
why I says to aunty from Andy oh it's

next few minutes
next up is a little skit we filmed a
couple days ago it's we did a skit like
this by two years ago where we each took
turns writing a line of the script so I
would write like three sentences and
then give the script to Justin and then
he would write three sentences and then
he give it back to me and so on until we
had a full page of a script and then we
just act it out and the first one was
just so random and goofy we wanted to do
another one so here's the little skit
and we'll put the script in the
description so you can just read along
if you want but hope you enjoy it
Wow

many bananas

to many many bananas and was visited by
three ghosts of Christmas past but was
so nervous my dad says I can eat as many
cookies as I want look out feeling
guilty and there's at least 45 cookies

mean it's Christmas for rats sake oh I
think I may have internal damage to my
brain molecules great Christmas present

tree growing in my basement

me I believe in Santa for pete's sake
Merry Christmas brother and a Happy New
Year

Merry Christmas and my opinion this was
