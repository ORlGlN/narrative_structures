Wow good morning Florida the lenses
major fogged up the launch platform edit
Ariella mobile on July 4th orientation
consideration to that thing goes all the
way up miles per hour
holy tell that's materias months with
that 30 page television in the vast
majority of television
the humanity there kids
being ever that monocular
everyone s launched this podcast right
on the left-hand side
dragon international I didn't realize
the first thing we're doing this morning
was going to look at the rocket
so insane I don't know if you could hear
on the bus but this is launch pad 39a
this is where they sent all the people
that have been to the moon have launched
from this pad
Wow I'm also a little upset I didn't
bring my zoom lens for my camera I just
brought this one which is not helping
there's the SpaceX building Abuk I wish
Elon was coming to watch the launch with
us I don't think he's coming though
getting some good shots on the 360 cam
we'll see we're kind of far away if
you're more than like 10 or 20 feet it's
really hard to see down right over 3-d
bubble yeah so I'm just hoping maybe if
you ask really nicely you can put it up
there for the launch just like really
close we would sacrifice so excited to
keep it
I have a question sure are we able to
test out the g-force spinning machine
unfortunately not just Philip and oh it
will be fun criticism your vein from
blood loss these locations your top five
or ten minutes and then you have a
question
take photos things like that yeah as you
can see when you get in here this is a
work that's under progress and just
starting off Fanshawe both in
microgravity space flight as well as
long-duration service systems similar
across similar numbers and they're going
to have students go in and manually rid
of those props see what it takes
determine water etcetera for learning
about space farming we're going around
the different connections of the
building super science and plant effect
engineer developing it
red light red light blue look at Metro
see the red light broke so we got about
a three-hour break until we have to be
back so I think what I'm going to do is
go back to the hotel room grab the drone
yeah grab the drone and see if I can go
back to that spot I found I was raining
it looked like a cool spot it is so hot
in here
thank you
what was nice about this cars just got
cooling seats wait ah yes
actor eight trying to decide if I want
to sit in the car go out there either
way it's very hot
all right have some shade perfect this
guy's got one of those like wind boat
things he was testing it over there and
shooting water all over the trees
well I think I got some cool drone shots
but I am like dripping in sweat
I don't know how hot it is out there
Sonny's barbecue I think this is the
barbecue place that Mary and I went to
on our honeymoon adventure I need to
grab like a water bottle or something
hydration is key out here that's my
water bottle back in the hotel room you
got some water and come this coffee
never seen this before so I'm gonna give
it a try let's try out this coffee Wow
Wow
there's arrows on there why would they
make this not a twist-off
Wow please just open aha
maybe this right here
yeah
I mean it's pretty good I wouldn't say
it's really anything special though I
was getting so confused I'm sitting here
drinking my coffee and it sounds like
there's someone on the roof of my car
when the world is that sound who's
leaking up CB is starting to rain
no keep hearing it and also this junk
bird just jumped off the roof and landed
down here he's over there walking around
what they have about three hours until
the scheduled launch right now we're
going to I don't know have a meeting
just a little discussion with the head
of NASA himself every time I feel
someone okay I've had an imagination
dream and think about what we can do
probably 2033 what are going tomorrow
how are you good what's your name for
the past hour ish we've been stuck
inside for what's called a phase two
because there's lightning in the area
and they just lifted that so we can go
outside this is like just under 30
minutes until the launch we can see it
right there is the launch pad we're a
lot closer earlier but that was just for
like pictures and stuff can't be that
close when it actually goes off
that's dangerous Oh
big lightning strike it on the plus
they just hope the launch
for lunch thus we only had such a short
window today unfortunately - outside I'm
pretty bummed obviously didn't get to
see the launch
I even wore check this out I even wore
my space socks you can't argue with the
weather it was just too dangerous to
watch a rocket up into the clouds that
has lightning so I'll have to come back
sometime to see a launch in person
hopefully another NASA social that'd be
fun
maybe next time Mary can join me because
she is an aerospace engineer they are
rescheduling the launch for Saturday but
I won't be able to go to that because we
are taking our flight to Rwanda tomorrow
morning someone gave me a great idea
that I should ask some of the other
people that are going to be there
Saturday if they're going to film it and
if I can use their footage to put in a
video so hopefully I'll be able to get
some footage to put in the vlog so you
guys can still see it and hopefully
won't miss out but I won't be able to
see it in person so I'll have to come
back we'll make another vlog just for
that
a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall
the length of this football field made
of new metal alloys some of which have
not yet been invented capable of
planning heat and stresses several times
more than an element experienced why
choose this is our goal and they may
we'll ask why climb the highest hump not
because they are easy but because they
are hard because that goal will serve to
organize and measure the best of our
energies and skills because that
challenge is one that we're willing to
accept one we are unwilling to postpone
and one we intend to win and do all them
and do all this and do it right and do
it first before this decade is out then
we must be bold
well at least their smoothies I got
another one it's a new flavor green
green thing with spinach check out this
a big building
it's really fun to explore
