hey guys welcome back to Fort mess yes
take it away today's four is going to be
so fun so so fun one of our favorite
four places ever we've only done one
video here before why because it's in
Denver but we're here at IKEA yes yeah
this is just the rafters of rafters the
ultimate rafter so we're gonna try and
build an even better one than last time
hopefully they have some plugs then we
can get some Christmas lights but either
way it's gonna be a fun day so yeah
alright guys here's the plan these are
all the rafters this is where we built
our first board we went behind there and
built that area but what we want to do
is go up into the rafters over here or
over here so we're going to make our way
through the main area through this way
not looking suspiciously picking up a
few supplies around here and then we're
gonna head right here Oh before we
forget guys you should go check out a
painting outpost link in the description
they are sponsoring today's episode of
Fort mess so thank you guys
yes and it basically it's just a fun
website where you give your opinions on
things you like and you get paid for it
yeah so it's a win-win the companies get
you guys's opinions you get some money
check it out and they they support us we
support them go ahead now let's build
for it that way
so as always we got to explore around
see which area would be the best for for
billing so right now we're just in the
first section of the rafters and my
goodness
this goes on for ages but yeah I injured
made a good point that these aren't
there so we can't really go up there
yeah this would not be fun and we want
to be safe not good we love finding
walls like this because behind the walls
lies open for tone
besides that with opening but if we can
get up behind that though oh yes anyway
see these has pores it's very good
must be sneaky we found him an entrance
it looks so cool was it a secret spy
agile what yes
mythical oh man this is gonna be so fun
out of the way guys oh geez
okay Oh BRR do you get up here
there's already walls everywhere so we
no one can see us
look at this yes but we have to be
careful on this wood because yes
we found this area but we can't get in
here it looks pretty cool though darn it
we're going up up higher
this is the third storey up here
basically at the very top there's one
more level well this is the ceiling
actually this is the ceiling
I like our high I know I can't even see
down like I don't know if anyone can see
us because we're so high up
Wow I feel like an adventurer right now
seriously this is awesome
but guys please be safe don't let them
end doing this
I can't believe here all the way up
there so this is where the old IKEA fort
was at but you can't make one now look
what they've done
who put all these boxes here look what
we found
free fort walls that's what this has
fort walls this is perfect
what do we need for we are now in the
main shopping center of Ikea getting
some ingredients for the fort Andrew
what do we got so far we got a big more
Dias carpet Christmas red and some mutt
cushions you got some poinsettia plants
and every like Christmas tree but
instantly we're on the lookout for many
Christmas things that we could decorate
this for with that have packages - hey
oh we're looking for battery-powered
Christmas lights check these out Oh what
yeah
they've also got like a carnival in a
little house if you can get one of those
in the fort that'd be so insane so here
is where we're building the rafters fort
this is so perfect and there's an outlet
right there so we can bring in our
Christmas lights yes
I'm up here and Andrews handing me the
decorations Christmas tree the most
important part
haha hey guys oh my god you guys it's me
well darn it guys unfortunately employee
found us and we can't do that yeah it
was just pretty awkward as well she was
like I'm just gonna stand here
so you guys are done and we just kept
pulling more and more things out of the
shelves and she was like I should like
Alan when you guys are up there like I
we were actually up there that long we
were just getting to like being able to
chill in there stuff darn it but she was
just saying it's a safety hazard which
is understandable so man
look where we're at now minions we're
back

different if you guys saw the other one
at this same it wasn't this location
this is like the giant headquarter so
