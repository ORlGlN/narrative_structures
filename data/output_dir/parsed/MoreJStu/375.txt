good afternoon everybody welcome back to
blogs hope you have a blessed day so far
we sure are what's up everybody welcome
back to vlogs today is going to be a bad
today is going to be a fun day
meri and I are driving up to the
mountains today to go to my friend's
wedding so it's going to be super fun
and we're going to stay the night up
there too cause it's like a couple hour
drive so yeah might as well just stay up
there have some fun but we're getting
ready to leave right now getting gas
right now because in this car it's Tyler
Becca
Brittany Becca Tyler hey we're all going
up to the Royal Gorge today Andrew and
Mary are up at a wedding they'd probably
be with us but they're busy but we're
going up there Brittany's never been a
lot of you guys probably know what that
is so let's go exploring
we never been back here hey we either
this is nuts
this drive is just beautiful for some
reason I still have this hey Buford
you're on my shirt I solved this Bubble
Ball in my cars we got to get it out of
here
look at how pretty you are today you
better thank you
yeah Buford did just get a bath recently
did you show him everybody miss me
uh-huh yes Hank Buford are you so happy
he's going yeah
we're taking him to a doggy daycare
we'll be back tomorrow Buford don't
worry best ways to view the gorge we are
here it's really windy here we made it
she's got a bomb pain so we got here an
admission is $25 a person and then if to
do the ride we wanted to do that one
rider is 30 bucks so just to get in and
stand on a bridge is $25 and we don't
want to spend 50 bucks to get yer solar
gorge I don't know why you charge so
much it's like a lame
but we tried at least so we're gonna
have to figure out what else it's funny
because there's absolutely no way that
we could ever complain about driving to
the mountains for a wedding because we
made everybody drive to our wedding up
in the mountains it's like weddings are
better in the mouth yeah I think so
don't know why you wouldn't close you
feel like a cool drive up in the
mountains yeah it's gonna be fun
well it's kind of unfortunate right now
we left an hour earlier than we should
have so we could get there an hour
before the wedding started maybe get
lunch check into our hotel but there was
a giant wreck on the highway and now
we're going to be late sir always if if
we left yesterday we would still be late
I don't know how does this happen
yeah so we're trying to find side roads
that go there and we've cut our time
down to where we're only like who's
honking guys we're gonna be like five
minutes late ten minutes ten minutes
late we it was like 30 to 40 minutes
late so that's good
quick update I think we're gonna be
early now all had sideways driving on
the knob highway paid off we're going to
pick up my friend Zack and Luke at their
hotel and they're gonna ride with us to
the venue what do you think about
admission prices Tyler I don't know 50
bucks to stand on a bridge just saying
if you kill a man Francisco instead and
have fun yeah I'm the Grand Canyon's
Creed so so we're just walking over here
to see if we can see it which looks like
a lot of people are doing whoa guys have
you seen the movie vacation no we're
Clark in Somali Catan
we saw it let's go Grand Canyon I know
that's what it is really you go walk
across the bridge but like ah what's up
guys hey you ready for the wedding oh

get dressed

continuing on with the adventure today
we're at the State Correctional Facility
like this is like maximum-security
prison right here look at the this is
just the wall here and then they got
three layers of barbed wire it's kind of
hard to see cuz it's bright but we're
going to the tour they have a prison
tour never done this before this is
really a cell these two cells were
salvaged from a cell house in an old
facility are you serious
that's what it used to look like this is
what you're staying Brett come in here
this is nuts so here be good people guys
are lined up in this chunk prison museum
oh yeah I don't know it's almost time
for food they're having lasagna maybe
something else

met for a while
but here's the cool tables cool
chandelier dance floor and here comes a
cop and he hit the cop their creator
dollar named Patrick Congrats on being
married Patrick oh thank you yeah
high-five it's like what is that so fun

women's prison in the 60s ethnic so she
said something something like that but
here's what the shower look like very
good thank you shot just the actual
bathroom or what huh ah okay wrong one

it looks like this with toys this is the
cell of Edna Venice dog hello hi is this
her all these people
what did there are bad people oh they
even have their things here that's cool
but forgery she messed up on her English
paper so she smelled a little morphine
you know no grand larceny my goodness
this isn't kind of creepy actual murder
weapons are marked with stickers what
that is disturbing really just for me
what in the world who got a gun in here
they must had terrible security Wow they
made it quite the mess Hey ladies so
crazy
she's got some fine hair just for being
in prison she's got some toothpaste
Cynthia's repeat sessions

guys what could be down here downstairs
and there's creepy dolls like they just
had to give him that face
oh it's freaking creepy can you imagine
I go yeah I imagine this boy's ha ha
muslin this place at night the great
prison escape way to the kitchen no
one's in here please do not open okay
guys here's the blueprint we came up
with the escape plan here easy once you
get out of the cell house you jump out
of the building come out of here the
exit and jump on the train tracks and
escape not very smart to build this
right next to a train track next time
you're on a horse ride adventure this
will be your saddle tailor come on guys
we all got to try a prison it
great looking forward I don't know what
we're doing
it's just kind of weird that this wall
just separates us between very evil
people right over this wall do you feel
weird yeah it feels really weird well
it's about 11:45 and we are checking
into our hotel room now I'm opening the
door there's no there's no fun would be
easy all the pools Hey oh nice

be more fun to attend weddings and it is
to actually get married yeah

down and get breakfast with Zach and
Luke here in a few minutes because we're
hungry it's pretty cool view from our
hotel window I don't know if you guys
can see that but there's some sort of
like BMX track down there yeah we can
barely see it Goody's Creperie this
place looks busy you have places like an
hour wait for breakfast so we're going
to try and find somewhere else but first
check this out I got a slack line that
goes across the whole little pond here
