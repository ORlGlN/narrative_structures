to push here it's no it's a dull push no
I've had to come rescue you okay
well how do we get back I don't know
just come put your shoes back on put
your shoes back on and maintain sure
figured out that it
the teleporter works if we sing
Christmas carols so that's the only way
then we're gonna get back and you
haven't sent a Christmas carol this
whole time
no okay hey ready see yes whatever comes
to first to your mind we wish you a
Merry Christmas we wish you a Merry crap
where are we we're back in my car
okay smell I'm sorry I haven't showered
in three days have you eaten anything no
oh no we should get you some food then
please all right let's go
since Nick hasn't eaten in a while we're
here at smash burger will that do
yes anything what kind of burger do you
want I don't know good just something
yes okay food just arrived oh great
take a bite
as you guys know smash burger is one of
our favorite places to eat and Nick said
he's only had it once before in his life
and that was a long time ago
is it living up to the expectations yeah
I never had the chicken I've been to
beat
did it okay lunch and food it's all done
that was the perfect meal to start the
day and for Nick as well but if you guys
remember if you've been watching the
vlog for a bit there is this ride here
in Colorado Springs the craziest
scariest funnest ride I've ever been on
and I've been on it three or how many
times I've been on it three times now
and every time it is so scary but Nick
has never been on this ride before what
kind of like are you done
roller coasters are you afraid of
amusement type rides I'm afraid of
heights how afraid like really afraid
okay so I have a challenge we are going
to blindfold Nick because he's never
seen this ride before in person so we're
gonna blindfold him all the way up until
he's strapped in to the ride and then
once she's strapped in there's no
getting off we'll take the blindfold off
get this reaction and it's gonna be
crazy so guys leave a comment now if you
think Nick is gonna be able to do it or
if he's gonna want to bail and get off
the ride if I poop my pants let us know
what is gonna happen but we are here the
weather is very nice out it's also
freezing today what does it say 22
degrees out guys so this is gonna be
cold ride you ready oh yeah all right
let's do this so here are guys this
place called Cave of the winds the
entrance is right here Nick just has
developed the waiver first because you
need a waiver that's how scary this
right is time has come like we mention
guys you've gotta put the blindfold on
I got the black hold on all right come
this way young man this way
okay oh so keep in mind as we're walking
we're coming upon a cliff edge that is
over a thousand feet above the air that
you're gonna be standing see the rides
right up here is anyone else in line
really yep zero railing yes don't fall
off we're going very slow of the nerves
kicking in yet Nick a lot of it we're
going up the big stairs to the platform
that's a railing right now the platform
has no railings by the way guys it's 22
degrees out
that's very cold I'm like literally
freezing right now you got it
kind of cold oh yeah oh great you're
buying me hot chocolate after this
vine we're getting onto the wooden
platform now Nick the reason why I
folded yeah all right why you
blindfolded Nick there's no more steps
keep coming
you're on my ground now blindfold look
is he maybe so how high up are we when
we once we get up here does that make
you feel safe oh gosh careful don't fall
off careful
let's take a peek over the edge folks
this is not the full edge though all
right this part of the platform as you
can see is Wiggly because this part
opens up gosh I don't want to stand here
alright there's your seat do I have
space in front of me yes maybe here's
the edge you guys and what we're
standing on actually opens up he's first
time any final words before you get on
this ride I love you mom okay Nick take
off your blindfold the moment of truth
oh yeah oh my god okay I gotta get
strapped in now and then we could get
this go
are you okay okay survives barely I can
even see your breath right now
okay here's our stuff as promised a hot
chocolate we're here at the Mont a
factor it's a cool little place so
so work that
this is warm we got like a vanilla hot
chocolate
well everybody we are back home warm out
of the freezing air how you feeling
after that I feel better feel better
that you're on solid ground feel great
bit I'm not sitting in the woods alone
that's true
but two things to leave you before we go
one keep Andrew and Mary in your prayers
as they take this next step and wait for
baby to arrive for a safe healthy
delivery and we want to leave you with
one Bible verse Psalm 37 7 be still in
the presence of the Lord and wait
patiently for him to act patience is key
guys some of you guys may be out there
waiting for God to show up in your life
be patient he's there he loves you I
will see you guys back here tomorrow
good bye
