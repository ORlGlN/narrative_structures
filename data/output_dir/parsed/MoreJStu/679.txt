good morning onions Wow today has
already been basically a nuthouse it's
almost one o'clock we're all getting
ready to go up to the wedding because
we're gonna stay the night up there
and everyone's already gone so I'm the
only one left at the house and I just
been packing getting everything ready oh
it's just so much to do hey Lucy my mind
so I've got like two anse and uncles and
cousins staying at our house and we
don't really have enough room so what we
did is you can kind of see but there's a
trailer set up we have two trailers set
up in the backyard everyone's in
everyone's room there's the living room
fold-out couch here a lot of people here
and then Mary's got all her family in
her house
Wow before I leave I wanted to tell you
guys something don't really like
starting off vlogs with sad news but
might as well just talk about it now
last night my dog's spirit she passed
away she was really old and yeah we just
you know found her outside she couldn't
get up so we brought her in the house
and she was right down there and we were
thinking about taking her to the vet or
like what to do see if she'll be okay in
the morning but then she just kind of
kind of gave up and passed away so I was
kind of sad and we buried her this
morning so I didn't leave logged that
because it's kind of sad didn't want you
guys to see that but yeah I wanted to
tell you about that and so if you ever
see any previous vlogs with spirit I
went like I think the last time I filmed
her it was just her just yeah yeah no
it's putting on camera but she was old
so body spirit was a good having yeah I
think I'm more worried about Buford
because spirit was like his best friend
on the whole planet and now she's just
gone and we're all leaving for a couple
days and he's just here all by himself
like poor Buford
he just doesn't like I don't know how
animals do they like to understand that
she's not here anymore
like I feel bad for Buford because he
doesn't like comprehend that I don't
think but yeah anyways enough with the
sad news we got some fun stuff coming up
and I got the car all packed up and I
got to go buy some things last-minute
things for the wedding so let's go here
