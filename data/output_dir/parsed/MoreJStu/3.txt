well why go back to for Friday everybody
guys we're just gonna go into the store
we're gonna build something yep
let's go in the store now now it's time
to find a spot where we can hide
make this one small because last time at
Thomas way too fast
I don't hear well and your luck
capri-sun for it yes this will be doing
is there's not too much yeah we both
might be able to fit in here maybe not I
don't know you can't please try it
submission
got a nice wall now what is that we just
gotta wait till the coast is clear
dangers gonna go on first and see if
there's enough room for both of us
how's it looking
oh there's somebody right there
I'm actually kind of comfy for being
honest a little bit how okay we can add
read over here that's the new challenge
guys trying to get both of us in the
smallest force possible do we really do
like big forts but see here's what it
looks like from out here you actually
got it pretty hidden so that's good
because he without these little gaps you
can totally see it if you're walking by
we're sliding all that over cuz there's
one more row I'm trying to move the
extra Kool Aid that way
I almost knocked the Cooling's down no
we have to push the glades this way all
right let's see if I can thick okay hi
guys this is a very tight fort I think
if I'm bunched up like this there might
say I can't go anymore because my knees
are hitting just try Harry okay
hello guys bye
there is no way you'll have to try
coming in
what go something to go for 2:30
hello
I know if I film that very good but
police you guys could hear it
you're in
guys we did it this is the smallest
two-person forever
what's that sound guys hi guys it's time
to break out
if someone walks by this is gonna be so
awkward
oh boy imagine you walk in the hiya you
see that Wow good mission success that
was exactly the smallest to person for
it now let's find some more all right
guys
time for a storage container fort do
they have lids yes they do
oh look at all these - we're gonna try
and put both of them next to each other
so we can be in a box by each other
we're waiting for people to pass by
like get cheese in here
I feel like laid down well yeah it's
hard because I hit two shilling you want
me to pick you up and put you on the
shelf gee it's so small in here
I can't fit here is no way you're gonna
fit here
oh good grief this one if we weren't so
tall would probably work next fort um
guys who thinks we should buy the
blobster favorite toy name ever or
whatever this is double lobster lobster
oh my gosh was that the blobster so we
could call you guys
it's hard to move yes oh so you can't
move your arms
you can't move anything hey y'all I'm
stuck in here cuz I literally I'll
probably get a cramp soon for not being
able to move Wow dad we're just kind of
goofing around well we got three forts
done yeah I saw we didn't get kicked out
that security guard was so nice I wish
every security guard yeah feels like I'm
not mad you just can't do that it's like
okay you think you want me to take your
picture we could have got a picture but
you don't need that we already got the
thumbnail yeah but that was fun

roomy back there good grief you're about
to knock all those over geez and you're

there's less room in here than the
kool-aid actually oh that's surprising
yeah it does look pretty roomy but my

head there when so it looks by height
all right some people are coming down
this aisle think they're behind excuse
