oh yeah hi and welcome back to more days
dude whatup yes we're doing something
that we never done before today never
ever ever so let's go out and get into
it
okay we're on the outside of where we're
going and it is gated it's got these
painful ouchies if you try and climb
well you guys party know where we're at
maybe by the Tumtum now I'm not sure I'm
just so excited
tada
it's those four miles okay so like
Andrew said earlier we both have never
been to a junkyard slash scrapyard
before tell them why this is so cool
slash epic slash exciting because look
they have so many cars and you just come
here and you can just pull parts off of
them yeah hiyo many tools oh I know we
want to kind of come and look and see
cuz maybe we can find some cool parts so
mica mods for the toy car some mods for
our actual cars just look at what's
going on here jeepers dude it can maybe
build a fort in one of these oh so yeah
these are all cars that I think I've
gotten in wrecks got totaled something
happened and it's not good
ooh we should play hide and seek here
what does that mean oh cool okay I know
we just started the vlog but leave a
like if you guys want us to play hide
and seek here
seriously look we can hide in cars and
stuff what yeah Oh looks like people
have already been rabbiting in here boys
gosh darn it ah does the horn still work
nope
darn I was trying to hide from you what
okay so maybe let's do some exploring
maybe we can find some really cool parts
or things that people haven't found yet
good luck why just because maybe
interesting I just thought they'd have
people left a lot of change behind so if
we look enough we can find enough change
to buy a snack there's already a few
snacks in here
we got to find something rare that's the
challenge okay yeah
something something very rare guys I
found some Legos much rare is it the
first find now we need to upgrade whoo
let's make it a challenge between me and
you I have to find something cooler than
that now okay whatever I find you find
something cool yeah so this is a three
stack of Legos good luck in the van
because usually vans have two kids
oh do this the whole seat was like
moving what is this
I'm finding lots of change oh so I have
three is this cooler than Legos it's
probably worth more one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
cents okay I guess you're in the lead
so we just found the biography of
probably the previous owner of this
vehicle why don't you go ahead and read
it
choices I've always had a general idea
of what I wanted to do after
was going to be something artistic and
fun in class we had a couple of
different tests such as a personality
profile we found out our hole in the
code there was no surprise to me that it
told me I was artistic and social I
already knew that but what was cool was
that it gave me a whole bunch of
different jobs that I could get involved
in so anything I won't read it all oh
wow this is a hit relic
I've been trying to look in the glove
boxes because sometimes people store
weird things in there yeah I found out
one of those half hospital admittance
wristbands oh so somebody he was 6 to 4
years old I found some other presents
what toy colored oh what does that go to
in a pencil man keep searching I just
found this cool Fork wow this one is
quite the contraption someone house
slash movable thing up
if you want to clean it we have a
Oh No okay we're just gonna play a quick
game of hide-and-seek to see what it's
like here I'm gonna count Andrew can
only hide in this row somewhere in any
of these cars how long do I get to hide
you get 30 seconds okay so I'm going to
count and you find a good spot ready go
you can see me though whoops
oh okay plug your ears oh oh it's all
muddy in here
oh this seat moves oh never mind I was
gonna get in that way No
this is kind of nasty folks
that way darn it what were you doing I
was just laying down lady yes Oh
and you couldn't see me because I was
down here did you know I was coming back
no move I was kind of like turning cuz I
thought I'd heard you and then you saw
me darn it I was gonna get in that car
there but I stepped in a pile of sludge
this one got some mashed that's it going
in have you ever been in a car engine
before no one ever
it's a whole new perspective of cars
sure that I'm gonna it looks like in
there yeah come on in guys
so a bit grand but here's what the
inside of the car is so not sure what
goes anywhere but yeah yeah this is
probably the worst car I've seen this
bar in a wreck via the roof did it a
good job holding up the car but still
it's the door even open how'd they get
out of here through the window I think a
drew may have one check up this what is
that I've never heard of not with it's
the neon golden edition with three bonus
songs so whatever that means you can
bring it home and try it out I don't
think it's gonna work
okay I thought these were credit cards
when I saw them but it's just a safe
ways Club card and a shell fuel rewards
so man what'd you get
so you know how you found that cool Lego
piece yeah what a full face a full brick
we found tape as well and a necklace for
you I bought this for you wow thanks
sure all right guys we got an engine mod
going in we're converting this vehicle
to a v6 let's get going
well
okay not bad so that
ah yeah next time on mod what's the show
okay mechanic so what we're doing here
is this wheel adjustement you got our
crowbar
huh oh we're gonna take a tire off let's
do it
is that how you take off a tire Wow
mechanic thank you I wish I could do it
though
yeah I can't yeah we keep finding tools
but none of them work
Wow okay let's go one kind of cool find
if it works yeah some subs it's got
glass on it and stuff but how did the
cords look don't see him
it's fine not a good sign that are the
bad guys
no but can't see here too long hey get
the truck over hurry
Oh No
I've been expecting you
now where is the key
okay give it to me whatever you do do
not let them see you at the key fact
shut the blinds quick
the mission was only half complete we
have to escape or we'll be fired
let's go
oh that was something yeah yep yeah yep
never done that before yeah we only
discovered like half the cars here I
can't wait to come back I know I think
there's other junk guards around town -
there's your playing tools so we can
take stuff apart oh yeah you guys want
to see mods you're back home no guys and
yeah like we said before I give this
video like if you enjoyed the junkyard
and if we should go back and do some
more funny ideas comment below
some mod ideas from real life cards that
cars that we could potentially do
because I'm not much of a car person I
don't know anything about it yeah but
some of you probably do
