hey guys as you can tell by the title
and thumbnail we are doing something
very exciting for today's vlog we've
already told you about this in the past
right now in the car with Brittany
Andrew and Mary we're going up to castle
rock to this 1,000 foot waterslide it's
for this event called slide the city and
it's gonna be a blast
Andrew brought his way out to ride oh
sorry Shamu but we for the slide the
city we got these super passes which
means we can go five times down the
slide then we get our own tubes so we'll
see how this is when we get up there
oh we're almost there
please a block in the road
hi we're walking up can't wait to see
what it looks like they just block off
like a toll road just for this giant
slide yeah got our passes here GoPro
just got a check in now this is the end
of it we got to figure out a check out
this but check it out
goes way over there she's doing a spin
move
you watch the pass
yes so we got some cool goodie bags here
with free tube our own brand new inner
tube with a mouth guard yeah I hope this
doesn't get violent I don't know why we
have a mouth guard oh yeah and we got
hats this one and this one swag
yeah this mouth guards are really big
yeah what's the point
since this is a water event and there
will be water I don't want to get this
camera wet so we're gonna switch over
into GoPro okay
all right walking up to the on walk we
have a brother Beaufort or gonna go
realist back down the slide
hey guys be racing leave my brother
cotton yeah see we're gonna be like that
you guys are going fast slow down
yeah
sure
well we're all done with slide the city
what did everyone think about it it was
pretty fun I'd say it would have been
fun or that it was a little steeper cuz
we kept stopping like sometimes and the
one in Manitou was better yeah what was
it
7% grade so it's like the steepest one
they have in their little tour here so I
should went to that one but yeah that
was very fun to stay inside the city
we're here at Whole Foods now we know
we're trying to eat better but me
Brittany's been kind of craving like
some sort of pizzas so we're going to
try to create our own healthy pizza we
know the word pizza and Jen was just not
really healthy but
we just wanted we're gonna try and make
it healthy so we roll hoops
yes here are the ingredients for our
pizza alright so I got some chicken
going or making a chicken alfredo pizza
with sauteed mushrooms green onions some
sun-dried tomatoes this and this cheese
I don't know what it is but I'm saying
that totally wrong I can't see that one
are they okay yeah whatever that is
here's the before about to put it in the
oven
yeah well the pizzas gone just in case
you're wondering it was delicious
but before I end the vlog I want to let
you know I think we have figured out
when we are going to release the short
films to you guys what we are thinking
is releasing the thriller on the 5th of
October which is a Monday and then the
comedy the 12th which is a Monday as
well so a week separation and what we're
going to do with the short films is like
I said before we're gonna find a theater
to play men and anybody in Colorado or
anywhere is invited to come watch it and
we're probably gonna do it honestly on
the fifth which is a Monday and if you
come to the screening will will show the
comedy as well so if you come to the
screening you get to see the comedy
before releases are on YouTube so
that'll be fun
Rasmus just told me that he is all he's
finished with the teaser trailer for the
thriller and we're gonna upload it to
this channel and I wanted to know if you
guys would want to see that leave a like
if you guys want us to upload the teaser
this week so you guys can see it it's
just something short it's not like a
long trailer I hope you guys kept
entertained for today's vlog tomorrow's
