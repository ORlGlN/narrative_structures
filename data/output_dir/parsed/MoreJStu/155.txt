what's up guys welcome back to more JS
to back with another vlog I hope you're
doing well we got a fun one today for
you what is that I don't know anything
about this stuff but we're doing another
car mod you just took out these on it we
want to do some sort of paint job to it
and there's this thing out there called
Plasti Dip which is pretty much this
paint you can spray on and if you don't
like it you can just peel right off
it's one really cool and I think we can
do that too the toy car okay
like inter said I haven't tried this
either Dennis either I don't know how it
works but we're going to try it out and
do some cool stuff so first we're going
to get some supplies
let's go site by the way who's having a
good day today they're always good
they are the Home Depot doesn't need
paint department or where great panic
spray paint yeah take it away you want
the different fresh that's great older
doctor so anyway I got black or white
that's all I haven't sprayed for plastic
okay red white and the car's blue so we
can do some fun yes let's go
do we need any other supplies for this
project or just that do you have hangers
teeth
I don't know got the tape
but we can't leave the store without
looking around for a potential fort
maybe for court Friday to try out a
couple new things so let's go find I'm
always on the lookout for new force
opening it comes there it's so open over
there also no go that one doesn't know
so no what about me huh no get in your
bra yeah oh man dude this is like a
gaming video like a hardwood floors
yeah hardwood floors
they've got shelves for snacks for did
you get through here so yeah this could
be a gaming studio if we want it but
we're now kind of clogged come where is
their pulse
oh I think I see one but it's like two
shelves up uh-huh yeah
take a look closer see it does it have
outlets on it I'm zooming in I can't
tell
you're going to have to climb with the
verdict huh no but even if there's not a
plug super nearby we're at the store
where you can just buy an extension cord
so no big deal
we're cooking of clash Royale yes we've
got a good idea so as you guys know we
have a gaming channel group squad gaming
danger just said we should make a gaming
clash video in a fort in a store yeah I
don't think anyone's ever done that
before so just like that idea if so we
will do it oh yeah
you have your deck ready bro yes burst
me oh no oh oh no oh you can maybe
spread in my face
no Ernie fire let me do it should see
who's a winner oh that's me boys so
that's basically what the gaming video
would be like kind of we're gonna better
hey we got to get back to the vlog come
on time to go paint the car
we're good next ah and here's our
supplies back home now we got to get
this thing out of the room and into the
girge yeah as you all remember we were
having a dance party it still works
being pimping baby Bink
I know well we can take that out okay
you guys make sure the car is clean
before applying wait whatever surface
you're putting on clean it up boys
okay so just spray all over cool dee I
just thought of would be if we Plasti
Dip just in the lines here - then let
these two a blue it's like red right
here or something oh yeah yeah and
throughout the car and do some more of
that but first we're going to clean up
real quick oh wow now if you want to do
some secret mods that's easy to
accomplish now so the first step once
you figure out what area and what color
you want to paint it you get the
painters tape and you mask off which
areas so we're going to do the inside
we'll put something to cover up this
side and spray it's just that simple but
it's all taped up nice enough the
chemicals yeah mix it up we could have
brought this to the paint shop now it
cost a couple hundred dollars which is
$6 can I don't know though a pro job
like some real lessons that could be
cool yeah but this is just step one
maybe later
first you want to do a light coat where
you can still see the color okay
sit for 15 so the paint bonds to the
grip of the paint or plastic and then
again another slight coat for 15 minutes
all right try out okay and breathe in
the toxins folks okay hmm
run get out of here
15-minute wait we'll be right back we're
trying to figure out what we want to do
for this side with the red
like what kind of design wiggles
squiggles and
I share is it a second coat inbound
do a good job please this side is ready
for paint this would be a cooling room
you do the same or this is these are the
same okay we got the both sides on time
to bring it out your spray paint what ah
wait I was gonna back it out Oh more
clever this is going to look so clutch
dude I know I can't wait to see the
final product that can probably put on
another layer over here man
oh yeah where should I put this
you got it out away from valuables okay
let's get a nice fresh coat on the
vehicle
wow wow this one seems a bit different
than the other one I don't know why just
keep trying
melzack action rolling - okay we're
going to compare sides this is this one
this is Andrews first try first try and
then the second try that's looking much
cleaner oops I was going like this it
now this is about done so Wow now I'm
looking very good blackness is smooth
Wow you got to be careful with this
stuff Oh No where did this guy come from
tell Garrett to get off our car go boy
get a new home is that a jumpy spider
I don't really gonna jump hey nobody's
get out of here I'm trying to work bud
go ready oh wow that's a flying spider
get it got the hood
all off it looks super cool obviously
like we said first time so there's going
to be a little flaw meaningful this is
the most perfect edge right here I mean
that's professional status but man this
is going to look good on the car though
wall the moment you've all been waiting
for
I am so excited to see what this looks
like I think it's going to look like ten
times cooler now the custom paint job
yeah I'm just a little sad at the first
side with the red is a little subpar the
second side much better this is but the
really cool thing about Plasti Dip paint
is you can say you get like a little
like uneven lines or you get some spray
on the car unlike spray paint you can
take off and rub off the paint yeah
that's what we did with the hood here
got a little spray on this side but just
took some spray and a cloth wiped it off
and now it's clear so easy fix
yeah you just take it off I love this
look though look some that yeah like
that
crisp line oh man Wow all right there
but we can clean that off we can forget
that I'm looking at this car and I'm
wondering why we didn't do this sooner
beats me I don't know but it's so cool
who's ready for a reveal
oh wait oh you guys this
check out the new license plate yeah by
the way one of you guys sent us that in
