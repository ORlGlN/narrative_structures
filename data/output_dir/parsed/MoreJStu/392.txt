the glacier thanks for the tour
no problem that was an experience that
was so fun I can't even like we were
walking on the glacier and then climbing
on a glacier like there's not even that
many spots in the world that just have
glaciers so it's like wow so such an
experience also I cut my fingers on
something not sure what maybe the ice
pick or maybe on the ice when I like I
don't know maybe hit it I'm being like
maybe you like maybe picked the ice it
fell off time for another banana snack
we asked her a guide what he does during
the winter time when they can't do ice
climbing and he said
helicopter ski tourers
I think that would be such a fun thing
to do that would miss it make an awesome
video as well but just all flying a
helicopter get dropped off at four town
