hey guys day 2 here in South Carolina
and we're heading to rent some bikes cuz
I think we're gonna bike around the
island as a family so we got to find
that and we're taking a walk because
it's beautiful outside it's like almost
80 degrees and everything around this
little island is like so close by each
other so we don't really have to drive
we haven't ate yet so we got to find
some food hey found some bikes
I think we're driving to go get some
pizza now yes can't pass up pizza here
we are New York City pizza
pizzas all gone though
I'll just get too excited I'm
fulfillment this I'm prone to realize
that these like game machine machines
they have in like our caves and just
pizza restaurants are so dumb because
like the prizes are like so stupid it's
like they're the dorkiest cheapest head
speakers some random mp3 player that
probably only holds one song like this
is a prize you win come on
hey nobody want to play to win this
stuff and then in here they've just all
these stuffed animals there
I think meant for two like newborns
literally twinkle like look at that doll
maybe the football on the teddy bear oh
only reasonable things I brought to that
pizza I definitely think I need to ride
the bike for a little bit got to work it
off you know what I'm saying
yeah we're gonna probably go bike around
by the
Beach so probably right now it's
probably not that fun to film because
there's just trees and stuff but once we
get it by the beach I'll get the camera
back out and I want to film some sort of
jungle movie in here only Andres here we
could film a jungle skit oh wow
I don't know if you could see that guy
sure but I said I would cuddle you so
hard I tweeted about that I know if you
guys saw that man wow it's windy too but
thank goodness the water is warm
okay I feel like I have to do some
pranks out here there's so many people
we could prank people all day
okay you want a piece of me that's a
technique if a bad guys coming toward
you that's all people know him as just
making that sound
yeah all right now we're gonna do
something I don't know what be a copy

this
wildwing cafe
