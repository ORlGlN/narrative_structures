well anyways the challenge we're doing
today is spicy mustard challenge oh yes
okay we got red raspberry wasabi mustard
now that mustard didn't sound too bad
honestly after that one we got some
habanero mustard ouch
and then finally we have the good old
crazy Jerry's mustard gas may cause nose
hairs to combust it's supposed to be
very bad it's that online that it has a
125,000 skully so that's pretty
ouch I don't even know what to expect
I've never had that spicy of mister oh
we also have some pretzels here because
pretzels go really well with mustard huh
so one of these last two all right
so we're gonna start with the red
raspberry wasabi mustard because we
don't think it's gonna be that bad we're
just hoping already hurts just smells
like mustard really yep like mustard

Kobe well that's big food that's a peck

hi home wasabi that spicy actually like
the immature flavor and got to be a
little bit but yeah okay there boss yeah
that's quite flavorful really yeah I
don't really know where the raspberry is
but I can get arrested I'm wondering
where the wasabi is I'm gonna try with a
a pencil great idea precipice not that

challenge when you're Jeff how was the
smell it just not like mustard mustard
