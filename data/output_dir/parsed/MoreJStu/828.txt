and everything this was fun how would
you guys rate this trampoline zone
compared to like sky zone and the other
place we went like it's on par skies
until it exact yeah I honestly had a
blast it's so similar but I think I
might like this one better because of
the wall like you can actually run up
the wall they have cliffs so I'd rate
this sky zone's and nine this is a nine

really give you free sky me of your
