what is up everybody welcome back to
more J's - and I just want to say
today's vlog idea should be pretty
stellar okay so here we have the toy car
I'm charging the battery because I'm
definitely going to need it but it's
another kind of a mod it's a temporary
mod that I want to do
it's his fourth of July is coming up
you've already guess what is going to be
modified on the car and EVs the live
movies I mean you're going to stay here
okay
or do you want now you can come we have
to go for a little bit of the drive
because our city doesn't sell fireworks
so we got to go to the outskirts we out
in the beyond you ready there we go pyro
fireworks interesting there's one there
and there's also another one over there
this tent smaller this tents bigger
let's go to the bigger one yes so many
options what do I do
I have 20 gold ones okay I'm Emily some
basic sparklers
good now I can get a fork you heard we
got the fireworks yes we did I think
that should be enough
what do you think bud so I'm trying to
think on how am I going to attach all
these fireworks on to the car hmm
I think I'm going to need some help so
we'll wait till Erin gets off work and
then we can get to assembling this thing
to firework lot mode guys it's Erin
all right I'm so excited for fireworks
mods
who's ready you heard I got both of
these fully charged now so
Wow - imagine if we took if it was able
to if this was possible to take the ATV
engine and put it in this thing way too
overpowering way to buy well there's no
such thing as way too fast
we're going to load up the toy car we're
going over to my parents house for a 4th
of July barbecue they're having their
tonight and then we can give them a
fireworks show they've never seen before
ok this thing's heavy now sub double
battery turret mad super happy how much
you think this thing weighs like sixty
pounds man
that's more than the weight limit sure
but first mom mates and kebabs kebabs a
kebabs are perfect
got a fire going kind of set up some
coloring hole we have ourselves a
tournament
how far away are these supposed to be
okay I have found the secret crystal of
ghibli's castle what so I found this old
fence post I don't know if this will
work or not but if it does oh man it's
just a little wide that have been so
prime just there's just tape it like
that tape it right there yeah then we
can put like some fountains line up on
this and then with some sparklers
sticking off the sides who's driving
this do you want to drive it please work
nope man puts battery container yet -
Aaron has two of these thought maybe one
of them would work some people left
commenting we're putting the battery
pack in upside down or something
doesn't slide in that way I'm just
trying to read comments okay we may have
a breakthrough folks this battery pack
had a bunch of battery corrosion on it
which may be a factor not sure please
work it just be so amazing
take a look at the in Titus you can't
see that wonder I'm trying I mean you
can kind of tell it the right ones
normal the left ones really messed up
please please please please please
please oh what's the problem now I don't
know let's just get to work on the
fireworks
we're going to do two different rounds
one's going to be sparklers and
extravaganza but the first one I got
these three different color smoke bombs
so I'm attached those on and then
Aaron's going to drive around so what is
it easier if you take your shoes off
makes sense
seven that's we get to go up four feet
we can't all Channing out the front
looks flying then let's talk about talk
about lightness and watch the golf the
falling car
it'll go one smoke bomb - smoke bomb
three smoke bomb
who's ready here we go
I don't put the world away for a minute
Wow
that was pretty cool the colors well
done well done son
now back to base
that had a good idea if you lay another
board going this way
and then drill holes you can put like
terms of sparklers in there so mom's
doing that is how you like yes
yay already got some setup just
outfitting the rest the color okay
pretty solid I guess I'm testing them
out looks good here's would you uh bring
up a good point though which I said that
if we have the big guy right here just
shooting like showers up I'm going to be
driving right under it as its showers
are just like falling back down on me
so what's the plan we got to put that
back here somewhere okay otherwise I'm
gonna ignite it by Erin and now we got
to put it on an extension otherwise it's
like a foot away from me like night
there - there we are
what about any purse yeah I gotta
protect the whole head all right so I
got this in the back installed pretty
secure ah it's starting to rain yeah
there's like barely any clouds Oh a
little bit
yeah after this little storm the pass
hopefully doesn't take too long man
they're all ready to go
American flag mountain dew close right I
can't see the lela lela wait
yeah didn't know couples look it fits
perfectly to may different hands
it's so funny
Wow yeah okay here you go say we will
wait okay
hey go go go
drive boy
yeah it's so funny that was hilarious
he's going off the edge fire
it worked actually I drove off this way
I know okay so did you catch on fire
no I could feel a thing just like
sparkles all over my arms and legs old
home and so living at a helmet I'll see
your hair didn't catch on fire crew all
thanks don't have any holes and shirt
it's kind of dark I don't see any
success yeah there made a good point
just our neighbors looking out the
window seeing that probably so confused
big song song from a little toy car like
what is going on Aaron shoot off a
bottle rocket Wow so far so good but so
dope last fourth of July you're sure not
fireworks and somebody led a bottle
rocket and went flying into the house
because the front door was open
yay huh hey didn't realize this but some
of the fireworks kind of melted the car
a little bit
let's encrypt I just do battle wounds
cosmetic things we can just get a job
I'll just buff right out
well that's it for the vlog ya guys hope
I was an entertaining one for you yeah
