howdy guys whoa welcome back to vlogs
you know exactly what's about to happen
we're here at Target forts forts forts
Fort forts you've never done afford a
target before yeah so we want to try it
you we tried it the other day it kind of
failed but we're determined to succeed
and create a fort that is memorable but
we've heard that targets has pretty on
top security Oh we'll just see what
happens we're going into this with
positivity so either way it's going to
be a good day so let's go
so we're trying to find the baby
stroller section cuz that's where we did
before last time but this is a different
target so it might be not the same as
the other one
that's where over for spurning toys
games over here we also see that the
nerf gun wanted oh yeah we had to stop
at the nerf section real quick and of
course they don't have the rival the
newest rival extra all's lives in the
past we don't want those okay yes they
have it guys they have the epic stroller
for section now where do we start guys
start somewhere in here okay Andrew
we're gonna start here
all right you're free to go
this is pretty open right here it's also
kind of noisy
we need to stack these better it's not
really that much better but kind of see
this section over here isn't really it's
really open so it's kind of hard to
build on this side maybe right here but
it's right by the entrance hey Andrew do
you need help okay it's funny cuz you
didn't know I was gonna push the need
help target button employee help oh I
don't want that help okay what do you
want trying to get in but there's people
over there they're gonna see me so I
have to pretend like I'm looking at baby
stuff this is a pretty good board so far
it's just kind of on holes yeah this
isn't a lot of holes equals very bad
some say if you can go this way in the
big boxes it would probably be better
but yeah let's think hey what did you
figure out I can't push this box cuz
like one of these is blocking it so
Justin's have you gotta fold it down and
maybe see also right here someone Mason
me but is it working
oh great
what I'm keeping an eye okay now you do
something with that box done don't
intend tintin tintin to do this is gonna
be a good part of the fort because
there's a lot of big boxes over here but
it's got to push these out the way
how did you get this up he's coming
what goodbye you still see me Oh must
fix screaming now we got a lot if you
want to expand more we push these boxes
further you're exposed dude I can't push
this box it's caught on something
so what Justin has to go out there it's
clear geez this box he moved it got
these turned I can turn this one so now
so this is way better now you turn these
sideways in fits like a globe
it's way better in here now now that I
made adjustments yes Wow like I made
this room wow it's so dark wait for it
aha that's like this room's a little
bigger now what is that the bunker yeah
this Aaron or Nick off school we can
invite him alone oh yeah yeah we can
call them from inside the fort rubber
band FM oh and I will all send to you
right now oh my god hmm I really have to
go to the bathroom again so I gotta get
there quick I don't know what I have I
had sometimes make my inside say ouch so
I need to find some pepto-bismol or
something well this is all I can find
it'll have to do
Tim Tim Tim Tim tomes never mind I found
some pepto yes Justin sent me a snapchat
of someone taking a stroller off one of
the fort walls so we go see what the
damage is Dave well
I took a piece off this side are you
doing now I think all Jared
see if he wants to join if we don't get
caught
we saw the security guard I don't know
if he knows that we're in here he's
worth yummy by the way did you film that
I filmed getting him but I did get two
tablets and said no go okay hello Aaron
who tired all the lot come to target yes
we are
how long you gonna stay in there um
probably at least another hour unless we
get caught okay
they're in we're trying to expand now
that way this is really hard
won't fit
it's wide open over there did you do it
oh that's called the crib all space
that's how you get in here my crawlspace
yeah you have to crawl
Andrews over there exploring the
crawlspace it's in no-man's land
cuz there's walls there's someone out
there
you're just married here this is why
it's no man's land
you can you see out into Timbuktu it's
wide open so you don't want to hang out
here very long so let's go back I think
this is the biggest for like length
lives that we have ever built so
entrance right there it goes all the way
to who knows where that boxes don't but
this is epic we're just waiting for
Aaron to show up he should be here
momentarily this way there's a good
there's Aaron the entrance is right
there or making an improv entrance Aaron
that's so nice in here you told you it's
gonna be huge
you guys wanna go get snacks why I hit
my head on this earlier - that hurt why
you did that
well when you stand up it's hard to see
obviously there's someone right there
don't make any sudden movements what
that's how you do the fast way he lay in
her back and push with your feet
Justin's all right down there but yes
it's not that spot so funny it's so far
away and you look at the yes
bless you hey can you stop it yes now go
yes we made it all the way to the very
end this is epic
what do you rate this for at a tenner
this one's solid it's like seven or an
eight yeah yeah we got a nice booth big
boxes for very good you know
blockage walls I love this company too
