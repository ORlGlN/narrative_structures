hey guys welcome back to vlogs yo hey
you guys have been bombarding us with
messages to do another toilet paper fort
the last one we did was about a month
ago so you know let's do another one
because if you guys have watched our
other toilet paper for videos last time
we got caught during the process and we
actually got pretty far last time we
were here they were restocking that's
how they caught us but doesn't look like
they're anymore okay so we're not
actually going to Costco we switch
places because we couldn't make it
happen we're at a different place now
but we think we're going to be able to
make it happen
and you guys already know as always
build up the walls outside first before
any inside building happens because if
you know of a wall everyone will see you
all the employees of a guy what are you
doing but once you built the wall you
can go back there and you're safe do you
think this is too tall
I don't know it doesn't look too
suspicious
it is very tall but
put another one right up here so we can
close off this wall yes just careful you
always have to be care this area you got
to be careful in too because there's a
lot of people walking by there's an
employee right there I'm trying here
take this oh okay yeah I know he went he
went in there see she just took
something I'm the only one outside of
the walls currently trying to keep guard
cuz people keep coming you got a pretty
big for it already
you got mine in here I'm just trying to
clear out this toilet paper and put it
that way
and that way once we get all the rolls
right here all the way across will be
completely enclosed in here trying to
build an entrance over here cuz justin
is out there how big the walls are now
Andrew aaron and nick are all back there
so i'm just trying to find like a way in
which i can't currently there's right
here or over here
okay the coast is clear
we're making a go for it someone's over
there
now that we have an entrance we have to
clear out all of this right yeah we want
to connect our rooms like a big area and
look it's really tall perfect
dangers going out to look to see if
there's any smaller ones so we can fit
into the cracks I came outside and
trying to find some smaller roles that
we can fill in some holes but look at
our fort you can even tell right back
there I'm so good I got to find some
smaller roles oh geez and this part we
can stand up it no one from all
directions
let's take a quick peek outside
was there somebody there yeah everything
he part of the wall off
Oh
sneak secret entrance
hey guys
so right now you have to figure out how
to work as a team because we're exposing
the four but we have to expand so this
is a good team with you goodbye Joe say
this is a good team building exercise
you can do with your youth group Boy
Scouts
there's so many people it's ridiculous
it's right next to the loading zone - so
all the employees are to the back sour
not even do it
just looking at some products
Aaron
just took a wall piece off
what's going on I think we've gone as
far as we can pretty much go met the
edge here there's openings right here
this is good because this is blocking
this is like employee section so I can't
really expand over there it will see us
but here's a quick tour of it cut
through here through here
she has brought in like a nice bed
that's so nice
over here to the open zone which is
where we would egg fit are you guys
doing matching bids a sports center yeah
top ten unexpected that's funny
so here's what it looks like from the
outside it's all the way from here all
the way over there do that I'm pretty
sure we're done expanding though I think
I'm going to ask him if they want to see
our fort it'll be funny you guys see the
fort we built what for
it's a pretty cool floor so we
we're gonna take the top layer off so
doesn't fall and then employee was fine
with it hey I have a stool not bad
what happened Nick
you do back here we're being good for
builders and putting back it the way we
put it so we're making it like normal
height so they don't get mad at us okay
and before that thing did a pretty good
job in here to buy toilet paper for it I
was a really good one we made well I'd
say that was a pretty successful fort
with you yeah we have big long aisle
that was fun
try we definitely want to try the
sleeping over at a fort we just got to
figure out all the logistics we also
want to do triple-decker toward paper
floors so we're always trying to think
of new ideas to expand the fort Empire
we're building so yeah that's it for
today's fork building session guys hope
you enjoyed it we'll leave links in the
description for the five other toilet
paper fourths we've built we've done a
double-decker a suite our first ever
built toilet paper for it so you have it
if you haven't seen those there's a
playlist in the description you can
check out what else do you have in mind
I just wanted to say that this is our
first successful one at Costco or Sam's
Club those seem to be a little bit
harder than Walmart
yeah I'm not proud of ourselves me too I
do want to build more sorts of forts
whether that be out of toilet paper or
just in general so maybe we'll do more
of that if you guys want seems like you
guys do so leave us a comment
maybe alike and we'll see you guys
tomorrow good bye
we got some decorations
