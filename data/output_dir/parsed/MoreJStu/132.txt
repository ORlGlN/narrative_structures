yeah hi welcome back to vlogs it's more
just you and we're back with more
adventures for you guys do you guys
remember when we did the blow-up house
on the raft wait wait huh
just you gotta get in some way somehow
we're getting closer to land holy okay
that was fun we said we wanted to do
part three and we have taken forever to
do part three it's so weird cuz it's
like summer is basically over now we
haven't done it yet what are you
thinking no no but we need to do it
today
yeah and four days one um we have a
really cool idea that involves pirates a
pool I'll only flour your ideas rafting
like always let's go in the store and
get a new ship for this adventure
whoa look we found pirate costumes now
hurrah
whoa get yours all right laughs are you
serious yes we found it it's a new ship
guys we need this now we got a deck this
out and make it epic okay now that we
got the boat we need to get a few other
supplies and then we can head out to sea
and start the mission yeah wha know what
we need
what okay last time I don't read both
times now we've had one or I don't know
why we didn't get two to begin with but
you need to to make a successful boat
journey with one or we just kept
spinning in circles and it was very bad
when enemy boats come we have no defense
we can't go anywhere we have to get the
oar or else if you find them Oh folks
perfect nature just came across this for
a future boat what do you guys think of
this here's what it looks like it's not
that price though but it has this roof
it's this one oh yeah
so we can build onto it there's also fun
what should we do this guy someday like
if so this pirate adventure is going to
be so much fun and I'm so glad we still
have this to blow up these inflatable
pools this would be impossible to blow
up with our mouths so we got this we're
gonna inflate it right here
and head to the lake
check out how big this is dude yes this
is so much bigger than I anticipated
Oh can't wait to know Rafi and we have
to be careful because this is called the
sinkhole you're going this and water
those we have made it to the lake the
boat is blown up it's on top of the car
oh I need clothes that yeah but what's
happening now it's time to transform
into pirates ready three two one Wow are
you serious I just can't believe this
Halloween costume didn't come with pants
you just go take a look at what seas
were gonna be working with today
the waters look a bit calm as well we
got the boat to the shoreline
yes and there's a lot of people fishing
here as well so it's just kind of
strange that these two pilots with the
pool just came out of nowhere but we're
on the mission to get to the other side
over there that's got to be treasure
never been over there before then for
that mystery island yeah over there we
lost our other boat yeah that was make
you rest in peace
so first we have our oars we have two
oars here mine and inners and I also
brought the leaf blower we used last
time so we think we should be good with
this for now
much we don't know how difficult this is
gonna be floating that's important
all right let me whoa it's like cold
yeah feels good
our first dip ship cannot sink get in
buddy
whoa stop your weight which side should
I go on you go right back okay
yes we were not kidding about this being
a waterbed hit seriously all the water
the lake is below us
if this seam rips and we just i hope not
that seems to be good quality so hope so
but you can even see I don't know if you
can see it on camera the water but it's
a beautiful day out you know just
another day out and see that's not
pirate's life you know what I mean

Australian pirate yeah arrr okay luckily
we brought my food as well we got some
Chipotle for the adventure if we want to
let now no get back to Oran we've been
at sea for days or starving out here
we're trying to ration our food as best
as we can but as you can see we're in
the middle no duh printing out the
Chipotle I got it oh but I need a fork
no we didn't bring any liquids oh man we
did bring one liquid help don't worry
you will I brought the moonshine it's a
pirate's life since we're pirates we
made the moon strange yes this is all we
need to be honest
who needs burritos yeah but that doesn't
have any alcohol in it if you're
wondering this is hot sauce
but yeah moonshine
land ho what I see Lud where we got a
pedal before the storm gets here right
there yeah hurry buddy come on all right
we're about to land

and I haven't eaten yet so we're gonna
take some time to eat and refuel before
we explore and claim some land for our
own pirates pirates no no no it's time
to eat yeah
don't shine for you laddie some of this
we've got quite the view as well of the
open seas yes how is it smells like
shine so I just try a swig sure
and my pirate voice has kind of been
losing its steam ever since we got off
the seas now we're on dry land no
unknown territory I don't know if you
can see this guys but it looks like we
have some invaders off in the distance

will be prepared to fight all done with
a quick meal and there's time to explore
