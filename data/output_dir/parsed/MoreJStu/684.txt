good morning melons how's it going guess
what we are doing today if you're if you
watched yesterday's vlog you party you
probably already know what we're doing
but if you don't they Andrew and I are
going to go try and explore some
abandoned Factory we found that's like
it's like an hour away from us so we're
gonna go see if we can you know explore
rounds so you would see what it looks
like I've actually never been like I
don't know what the war is called urban
exploring so this would be like a first
time doing it but I was looking up some
other locations here in Colorado and
there's an abandoned missile silo so I
don't know if we'll explore that one too
but it looks insane I was looking at
some pictures and videos andrew has been
getting some accessories for the trip
what do you what do you got here your
bag actually did fun some masks just
dusty piss on good handkerchiefs thanks
we got some gloves
you got some eye protection a flashlight
in case it gets dark which it might
you okay know that we're here
it's nowhere they demolished it why it
was ugly
come on I am so sorry
yes well now let's find some other
placement but this is it it's not here
it's for auction 27 acres we found a
building that this is abandoned but the
doors probably knocked you want me to
check I don't even see a handle anywhere
oh it's bars
it's definitely abandoned now I mean my
goodness
whoa what the heck is that a little dog
the little dog Myrtle is a cat but look
behind this fence there's a little cat
out there yeah world that's not probably
good
there's grasshoppers everywhere in here
we craps yeah is your typical graffiti
on abandoned buildings that's how you
know it's abandoned if there's a
graffiti all over it what's over here
yes this where some some people like to
hang out you know yeah yeah it's just
kind of average at best whoa
some people are really good at graffito
zing here's what it looks like inside
pretty spacious
that let us in were you born in well
look how much stuffs in there
I wish we could get in so we could
explore it looks so fun we're still
trying to find more things to explore we
just drove past this train thing looks
like a rocket
never seen a train like that before what
is it I'll know but I want to ride it
just driving by more trains I think this
is like a train museum here but this
train made me laugh because of this sign
here
do not hump I've no idea what that even
means in regards to a train
yeah they got so many just cool old
trains it's awesome Pueblo human Union
d-pod President Roosevelt Oh
oh this is pretty
this is must be where they have weddings
we got a bar kyoool
there must be an old sign yeah they
definitely have really old signs from
back then back in the olden days 19 or
1889 well guys we've come to the
realization that there is literally
nothing to do in Pueblo I have no idea
why my family used to live here but in
the meantime we're trying to clear our
senses and get something our minds own
self home we need chick-fil-a as home so
I have an immediate sense of happiness
walking through this door we're back
home
time to practice some spikeball cuz the
tournament's in two days
yes
huh for the days over
you're the crew Erin and Andy at the
frolf course whoa oh it's this beautiful
aisle this is like the perfect time to
frolf hey guys do you guys remember when
we did rafting in a swamp it was right
here and now all the waters gone dude
Wow
I already missed the swamp to you
Rabbie's not bad can you make it
Aaron makes it and robe if set
we'll come back
this is just so beautiful guys look at
the sun rays coming in all the bugs
frolicking throughout the fields just
stunning and yet again another beautiful
sunset here so I got a love winter or
that's all you got a love summer you get
stuff like this and call Enderman hold
when I throw it fast stained sunsets
yeah all right guys
it is later in the evening now and me
and Andrew are going to see a movie
right now can you guess which one it is
it just came out tonight right now right
now
let's just show you the theater wait
what we have to get something first we
do like a beverage oh yes so let's go
you can't go to the movies without a
beverage unless you want to spend a
fortune buying their drinks
no thanks what did you find
this can you guess what it is
ah black licorice actually it's just
water
well that isn't it's black yeah and it's
a dollar ninety-nine I'm really curious
as to like if this tastes any different
than normal water why it's black
probably explains on here but goofy
non-gmo come on it's water well the
ingredients are water with fulvic trace
mineral complex so whatever that means
if anybody's making GMO water get you to
stop I know no reason but non GMO on a
water bottle
target has finally stepped up their game
they have just got self-checkout before
they used to only have all these
checkout lines and no self checkout for
some weird reason I'm so glad they
printed off this piece of paper it says
thanks it just makes me feel so good oh
my gosh
usually they're coupons but this is way
better yeah even it gets a note from a
second grader I like math because it
teaches me how to add what does mine say
my favorite subject is art because I
love to draw no way yes
so here's what we're seeing guys the
visit oh you've probably already seen
the trailer for the creepy granny but
for some reason this is
as a comedy horror I was Jack I thought
it was like a horror thriller but on
IMDB insanity yeah
commie
so confused this is this is in the
biggest detour to Oh work it girl yeah
yeah shake those kneecaps yeah
ah
pack theater this is one of the biggest
ones here military we're thinking about
doing a movie theater
prank or movie theater pranks for main
channel what do you guys think about
that you have a few ideas probably like
a montage video like a few different
ideas because like the camera we have it
shoots in night vision so they were
probably working here as our camera
before didn't do that so we could let us
know who wants to do that movies about
to start guys so yeah yeah
I'm sorry man I mean to kick your seat
is watch it
that was missing again yeah uh-oh
we're all done with the film what do you
think I was not expecting that I know
when you're not explain it we can't
explain anything because they give it
away
yeah a lot of you might not see that
movie anyway but wall was intense
actually yeah probably recommend it yeah
pretty good just creepy had a lot of
funny parts surprisingly yeah but
definitely creepy oh oh I just I don't
know what to think right now
just watch out for Grandma all the guys
I guess it's time for bed
since it's midnight here pretty
fun-filled day I'd say Britney comes
home to morrow which I'm very excited
about she's been gone for right about
five days so it'll be nice to have her
