Superbowl

I'm so happy can't even explain it

out who we're gonna be playing in the
Super Bowl is it gonna be Arizona or
Carolina oh man oh man honestly I think

gone
but okay hey that's my name okay I'll
get a medium cherry limeade and order a
french toast sticks a route 44
strawberry limeade that'll do it
swag got a share with eBay you know
I was gonna say you're gonna drink all
that yourself route 44 is loosely I
think is like the biggest drink you can
get anywhere almost it's like as big as
the super big gulp no no I'm sharing
with Mary well you know the Broncos are
winning the Super Bowl
yeah yeah I'm so excited yes I can't
wait
yes dun-dun-dun time
yeah you definitely need a friend to
share route 44 or your psycho here's the
difference between a medium and a route
44 what see that's crazy all right
I'm gonna go home now all right all
right well sorted water it's a new day
it's morning now and I've been editing
the bean boozled challenge but for some
reason the internet in our house isn't
working I don't know why before did you
chew on a cord outside I don't know
what's going on so I'm gonna take my
computer over to my parents house and
finish editing and hopefully upload it
as snow on your nose Buford dream is
alive what is this dump that's what so
I'm just editing here and I'm trying to
find some bean boozled graphics on the
internet but I also found this it's a
new addition I don't know if it's out
yet or not but spoiled milk and dead
fish oh you got rid of skunk spray so
that's good but both of those just sound
terrible I might go to the store and see
if they got this new these new flavors
out because I I want to try them but I
really don't want to try them
I've just finished editing I was a beast
of an edit I got a lot of layers on this
guy hopefully you guys enjoyed it spent
a little extra time on the edit and now
I got to get lunch but gotta upload this
quick because Mary and I are doing
something really fun tonight
so gotta get this up
how do you guys like the new hairstyle
uh-huh
she's trying to look like a ninja
before I go bald it's not really that
long to do that so
Buford likes to attack the vacuum he
thinks it's an intruder is some sort of
critter that needs to be destroyed
here's another new style called the
super mohawk
but the poom I just need to put a hat on
this is just not acceptable
well it's time to go do what we're gonna
do tonight as you can tell by my sweater
maybe this is a hint can you see my
sweater we're going to the Nuggets game
the Nuggets game no there's the Pepsi
Center
I think it's cool they have a blue and
orange lights going across go Broncos
nugs nugs nugs nugs nugs also it's
snowing right now not too hard but you
know just a little drizzle little flurry
a drizzle of snow can't even really see
you
oh there you you can see it now lost
like an hour early to the game so we're
just kind of looking at the shop here so
we're at his word never early the south
always late and so a whole hour wow
you've got a sweater on and he's fuzzy
75% off that is big yeah I have the
Broncos like version of this interesting
jerseys see you could just get a Jersey
where does a dress to be so awkward so

store yo what's up what's your names I
meet you I'm Justin here Justin - thanks
for watching man all the crew oh sorry
about that
alright yeah go know guys have fun at
the game popcorn that was pretty good
yeah so many flavors donuts spuds
feel like the Pepsi Center has better
food than the Bronco Stadium and it's
inside they've got a silent auction
can reminds me of that office episode if
you guys watch them office where they're
doing the silent auction into a thick
and white things you have to like get
the closest to the actual price or
whatever guess the price and you win it
so he's like bidding the highest he can
is that this is how much it costs and
that the NDL is like $30,000
ah you lost thanks guys
Xbox you fouled me
why did you found me alright ready here
we go
Hey you can do it oh come on I don't
even know the controls so row 6
what is this bring this gone seats have
a sales table yes
what in the world yeah you should just
on random seats
so the golden seat if you get one of
those tickets you can take it over and
get in the drawing to win a free
basketball or Jersey pretty close read
yeah let's do it
Skippy first point come on over here
turn a hoverboard what
what
I kind of hope he falls
it's halftime time to get some snacks
not a very good score

a mask well that's all for today's blog
thanks for watching
Nuggets game was fun I wish they would
have won though but it's alright you
can't win them all maybe we'll go back

are pretty cheap you can get like upper
row ones for eight to ten bucks so it's
a pretty good deal tomorrow Aaron and I
