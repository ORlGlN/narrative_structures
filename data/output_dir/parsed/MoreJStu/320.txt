what's up guys welcome back to vlogs
hope you're doing well we're at Best Buy
right now because we need some supplies
for today's Ford adventure yeah first of
all well you guys left this many likes
and comments it was insane you guys
wanted us to do the new four and bring
in the PlayStation TV we don't have a
small TV so we got to go see what they
have at the Best Buy yes it's it has
HDMI right yeah okay that's good
so you're good well the first thing we
need is this tiny TV because we're gonna
bring it into Lowe's obviously and
connect our PlayStation
we found some spots if you guys watch
the previous four videos so this one is
a 19-inch alright there's only one left
it's like there's meant to be I know
but guys only 720p alright put it back
how are we gonna fully maximize this
PlayStation gaming session oh yeah we
packed up the PlayStation and didn't
bring any games so that was a
Mississippi but they have some sail
games that would be funny to play also
this just came out which I really want a
ps4 / oh you're the Xbox I did just come
home I just realized that I forgot
controllers as well so we're definitely
gonna have to go back to the house
that's okay though we could get to being
on a point yeah the cheapest game that
halves like $9.99
there was a lego movie we have just
opened in the box
now the TV is fragile why will this fit
the only backpack I have is minions oh
it's gonna be close Fitz but oh it looks
like maybe a laptop here is Andrews
video game headquarters so we're trying
to see which one are two player games we
can bring there's FIFA Madden
battlefield would be fun but it's only
one player as well as battlefront
it will bring soccer that'd be fun can
we please bring this what is it oh okay
we're here we're gonna put this stuff in
the shopping cart so we like half normal
you're some fun careful careful oh yeah
that's it police station that's a place
that I'm careful here we go
the hardest part is over that's the
hardest part
we were scoping out the areas we were
already here before so we already know
what the good spots are there's one
right here it's got the plugs see them
and there's one really good spot down
there which we are fully blocked off
from the Hun tire store so for the head
Cheers
I don't know oh they have maybe a bucket
for this oh yeah but you need chairs
buckets nice seats blue this is it guys
this is the entrance I'll show you
oh man when people see us Ike through
there so here's the plane an trees gonna
go in first then I'm gonna hand him the
PlayStation in the TV and he's gonna set
it up while I keep watch out here
put the door up let's see how it looks
from out here so you're not spotted
someone's coming
see it's just there's a lot of little
holes that we can fix but it it needs to
be fixed hi sir huh
and that's how open it is there and then
also right there very open so what if we
crawled down this corridor to that next
section it's a little bit bigger that
might work there looks like there might
be something up there that could work as
a fort but the only way to get there is
to crawl through this and then get up in
that there's so many people in the isle
this is like Mission Impossible and hell
up there maybe
that that lady might have seen me
they quit cardboard delivery oh my gosh
this scariest thing just happened I was
crawling through the hallway here and
this guy this employee perked one of the
ladders here cuz who's gonna start
stocking the shelf above me so he was
like moving these things he was standing
right here and he was moving these out
the way I was laying right here check
this out
he's got the cardboard for the entrance
this for this wall and hidden this for
this wall pretty solid in here now I
have just handed Andrew with the
PlayStation a TV so now I think we're
gonna start getting set up best almost
there the door
all right come on in
I have the door
ah fantastic do you like her wall over
here are we getting out the TV now I'm
so glad we made it end I wish I was I
could have seen or were you filming when
he was no I wanted to I started filming
but I was like I can't explode without
been so good to see that I was like but
now it's time
and moment of truth what often does that
means turning on
oh yeah
all right so we also have a light the
Manfrotto this is the epic one that they
sent us check it out is that much
brighter here you had a custom link it's
perfect now it's time to set up the
PlayStation
perfect
more power
oh wait let's turn this now that's a
good idea
there's what they have Leifheit here
maybe we can play online there we can
try just imagine if someone they saw
what we were doing in here Goodin peek
in
let's try us out we need some cheese
those kids were making fruit in there
yeah I saw a my climbing in the rafters
in there
where's the volume no you drop the
remote downstair here you go
mom's very angry at him though she said
oh she's climbing yes bro
our first game ever
is a fort in the store yeah
she saw someone right behind you yes
I hope it's fast
damnit connection is gonna be I'm I got
on the Wi-Fi my phone yes bro yes I
can't believe we're doing this right now
how do you feel

they stalking right
we got game upstairs upstairs you can't
get up there no room
there's an outlet right appear oh yeah
there's an outlet always one of
ourselves dude okay five in the viewers
an aspirin
dad be sure just go oh I'm just trying
to see if I can make this work you can
take some of the cardboard maybe this
would be three three story gaming for it
we had to move some cardboard up there
to block it
I have made it safely to the third
storey ladies in you wanna check it out
this is and they have a plug right there
you have a nice view this is like a
penthouse view luxury we just moved in
so we still have a few boxes but other
than that it's it's quite beautiful if
you just hang it up right here that'd be
perfect
there we go
just a quick game of FIFA 15 if I don't
say so myself how's the weather down
there dude yes I'm down here I could
play it because I can just look up and
see the screen or I can stand and play
give it back
I really want to turn up the volume
really loud but I can't reach it
wow he tricked me anybody out here
so they giving the whip
can you reach the remote No
why'd you drop it down there no say we
had an employee emergency they knew
someone was back here like this ever see
