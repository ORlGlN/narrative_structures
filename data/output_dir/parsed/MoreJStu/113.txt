well good morning everybody and welcome
back to more J stew today
what are we doing Britt we're going on a
submarine to work I didn't even know
that was actually a thing you literally
go like I think over a hundred feet
below the water in an actual submarine
and they show you like sunken ships and
stuff so I think today's vlog is gonna
be super fun and we're gonna take you
guys along and show you what it's like
so let's go
land sunrise
postcard felt close Garth will bring
that back stamp and mail at anyone the
Welcome three guys got cool cats as well
as Captain Jack's other than that the
only thing for you to remember is at ten
minutes till one young slipping the 18
there thank you
underwater
there is no of course not that's just a
boat that takes you to the submarine
thank you
yeah I can't tell you how excited I am
for this I never would have thought that
I could go on a submarine or and go
under in a submarine
times with him pray here with man 100%
white hands no
this is the captain aboard the Roxy at
this time your captain is let me know
that he has visual contact with his
submarine and if see that light blue
spun in the water just off your
starboard beam does a submersible at 40
now pay attention as I clear the
submarine to surface
right book so what we're going to do now
is captain Matt's gonna maneuver the
vessel over to the submarine
here we go guys about to go under
we're gonna watch it on the star
we can remain seated them
everyone is the left side
skip McGee Eastern Obama is leading
service and up here's in the back of the
submarine he will be your naturalist and
narrator for today's dive and we
certainly hope that you enjoy your torso
you have to do is to begin depth there
then dive run euro payments well
cigarettes here like movies
we're going down
now you're gonna do this was hardly any
fish for starboard side he's got a
beautifully trevally going down that's
our number one predator that he's had to
race all the time now he's looking her
fish along our submarine called himself
they're known to be quite aggressive
hunters well that could have been from
him running into the reason hitting it
and that scar on his body is what he's
locked onto that fish he locks under
that thing and then he dashed his damage
sometimes hits the reef that could
really show you how sharp the reef is
now you see that large group of fish
kind of yellowish with the blue lines on
those are called blue light snapper and
they are introduced to our reach so if
you look at your sushi menu and went sea
or an eye next to it to e stands for
endemic you know trying to find summary
or fish a lot of people I think they're
very friendly and very it's the point
that they're blind that they don't see
you and they don't run from you and if
they think they're so friendly that if
you did eat fish tacos for lunch and
you're down here diving after that the
smell on your fingers is enough to make
them come out and grab your fingers all
right so make sure you wash your hands
after you die or they start eel
we're coming up you see a lot of the
trevally hanging out here the rudder
there's a bit you are the aquarium right
now folks as a real-life whitetip reef
shark now he's just like a nurse shark
for some bull sharks to leave bow that
 look all the way up to see that
line that goes all the way to the
surface
deck out the beautiful white tip reef
shark holding that is we call hook if
you look on his right side you'll see a
hook sticking in his mouth from Germany
in the 1970s
five companies come down with up to 13
people and like to enjoy our reef and we
don't mind as long as they respect and
don't touch anything just to get
flounder down here so see if they take
right out for my peoples uh very bored
every now and then we see one it's kinda
like a halibut with their minds and
their mouths all on one side of their
body
1:28 there we go it's a 129 130 people
the deepest kiss we've ever happened
pretty rare it the unicorn fish here's
that beautiful I spent Joyce shows lot
of colors sleeping
