good afternoon everybody hey what are we
doing what are we doing we're playing
frisbee goals these of peeps have never
played before yes and it's a beautiful
day out now taking advantage of this
warm weather it's super nice so here we
go
Josh we're trying to figure out where it
is we think it's here it's got the
sticker here so that means it over there
right and it's down there right okay
fire it will not bad oh here comes
rasmus's first fall first throw all
right yes oh yeah it was good
proceeds whole four yeah this might be
the longest hole I think if it's in the
east spots 480 feet low hole eight folks
how's the golfing going tell us I think
we're all fairly close I'm losing things
but not but not yeah how much pain is
keeping score but how many more holes me
up and ten more holes me oh yeah you can
throw a really rec throw that's it
perfect yeah but the thing is I'm warmed
up now so now I can start making a
hole-in-one
that's what that is us though what we're
warmed up yeah like I'm scared of you
guys okay so remember when we were just
vlogging right there Andrew was thinking
he is going to win what are you doing
over here
and drew he threw it from right here to
there and the whole way over there okay
I want to watch oh not bad whoo that's
really good oh please hold number two or
shot number two straight ahead
I'll throw at the camera oh we're
sisters Andrew just got here yeah very
nice
notice can't wait for this area to bloom
again every summer fall or whatever
spring the best we have like three I
think first be golf courses in our city
we like coming to this one a lot play
the best one but yeah it's like randomly
windy which makes it very hard to throw
Rasmus threw his and went flying
shrewdest up in the air went backwards
if Rasmus can hit just in the head he
may score
you try okay okay here's the disk ready
right this is a fun hole you got to go
straight down the trees and there she is
right uh yeah I see you oh yeah oh yeah
oh yeah oh wow that was a perfect
straight one oh yeah I got unfilmed -
Wow how many holes are we tied up now in
a row we've all tied up I like six yeah
yeah it's been like four in a row so
keep it up
oh no I want to win I was doing the I
wanna no I wouldn't
Oh Hannah 100 through a boulder at me
Rasmus he throws giant bricks he threw
IQ Wow here we are hole 18 and is going
to add up the scores so we know who's
the place for the final hole coming up
soon I know in a fact if anybody gets a
hole-in-one in this they win if anybody
gets a hole-in-one on this hole I will
give them a hundred bucks
we do love them the win as well yep
100 bucks for a hole in one not joking
okay sure you make a hole one I'll give
you hundred bucks
all right all right so Andrew half 72
okay yes
in at 69 huh 400 by George oh no that's
a good one uh but not a whole one
Oh hundred bucks away gone let's observe
his insane Foreman ah ah it went left
the final throw basically Oh anyway

ice still in it yep all right here we go
so fun I can't believe how much you love
science I love cooking eggs like this
maybe we just invented something that's
world-renowned dry ice eggs try now
we're trying out the dry ice eggs what's
it going to taste like
it looks fluffy they have a different
flavor really mm-hmm he's got a good
flavor or there's no restaurant going
out of business before we start
well me and Andrew are just discussing
it Clea dry ice is edible so and he said
it's on a periodic periodic table so it
should be fine yeah maybe maybe don't
use that logic all the time but what do
you think does it take different than
normal eggs or no that's true there are
no there's no salt or pepper on these
eggs so that would increase the flavor
but yeah there is like a hint of
something odd like when I finish eating
my mouth just feels different
yeah the dry ice restaurant dry ice and
print you want to take these home
