don't show anybody your car oh sorry a
big secret okay so we are continuing the
vlog on
right now it's a different day as you
can tell we have a really fun idea
Andrew tell you guys have probably seen
those videos where they heat up the 9000
degrees in the sliced up open so we're
here at the store looking at their
selection of torches which are right
here but guys are so baby it's like a
lighter and I'd like these torches have
a couple other ones but like an Y get
the little ones when you can get the
inferno Inferno torch guys this hooks up
to a giant propane tank it's got the
extendo burn melt remove heat this thing
is huge I don't propane torch how hot
will this thing get dude because the
other channels that were doing this
they're just using these small ones
which are little flames this is gonna be
huge I don't know man I think we're
gonna have some fun today so let's get
this and
back at the house so we just got to go
inside attach the propane tank to it
it's time to open up the infernal ah
yeah yeah it might be a good idea to
check out these instructions is it got
to be hotter than a thousand degrees
yeah how do we we don't know how to
figure this out Gus has 500 thousand
BTUs ooh maybe we should look that up
calling this company to see how hot the
flame gets because I can't figure it out
oh never mind they just hung up I don't
think they're open because today it's
like a holiday ish during it I found
something guys that flame temperatures
can vary as they are affected by several
factors most oxygen flames however
measure close to five thousand four
hundred degrees Fahrenheit at the end of
the inner cone what that's hot Oh before
we play with this thing guys we got to
take safety precautions we have a mask
ready gonna use this isn't a toy we got
to read about all the parts so it seems
like when you plug it in turn on the
valve okay okay
and then this creates the flame and
you're done go in turn the valve off yes
glad you wore read the instructions they
got me too here is the propane take No
you tell me that is just like this yes
put your mask on yeah nice to start
because this is what it's actually used
for do the honors
we great yeah what have you done its I
opened it in the car and I was like see
here to put it the other way you do an
open says that way
