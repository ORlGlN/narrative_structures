hipster had it buddy and welcome back to
for Friday's yes
check it say geez we're going to play
with these in the fort today it'll be
really fun everyone has been asking us
to do for Friday's so we're starting the
tradition force every Friday come back
see I keep leaving your comments leave a
like if you liked the idea and it's
going to be happening let's go outside
and get this going
hey guys we're at the dog through fort
section we're thinking this might be a
good location for the fort so what do
you think almost look you can use this
is a cardboard I put over that crack you
really oh yeah for comfort
we've got a bigger section here multiple
levels it's a tour paper Kingdom look at
it whoa this is cool
serious no we definitely want to make
the toilet paper castles and it's going
to happen I'm serious we just take to us
we just took a look at the classic
toilet paper section and blow is nice
here
but look it's triple layers and lots of
wood rolls for building I you making
some arrangements it's a little better
now yeah by the way if there's any
toilet paper companies out there who
want to sponsor us we'll make an epic
toilet paper castle just heads up it
could be Scott look at northern
whoever's watching this you know to be
honest here's some quick advice for you
guys when you're building they had
toilet paper before or any for that
matter try and get inside the floor as
quick as you can because people and
employees tend to notice if you're
hanging around like an aisle long and
then they can get suspicious so you want
to like get in there and then bill from
the inside Sid Jesus it's clear no it's
not I do me
yes yeah I'm in we need to get any or
two okay we got a lot of work to do
though look at this like a mess back
here so while we're in here it's easy to
clean out
hold on let me move and then you come in
make it bigger so I cleared a little
space so I think Andrew can come in now
so he doesn't look suspicious in the
aisle that's one tip we didn't give you
guys before who's there
employee alert or Stockton yeah how's
the weather out there you know
took that piece as well and was all
lightly here crisis averted
we should connect previous more
investment yeah so we're going to try
and build the biggest old paper for put
all from inside the fort and then we
have our first obstacle over here
actually so this section right there it
doesn't have much toilet paper but that
does but there's a big gap right there
so we got to fill that open that up so
we can go to the very end and see that's
this side but the entrance doesn't have
much totally therefore if you passed it
solo did it
I'm keeping watch down this aisle well
Elmo built up the walls there's somebody
coming two villains inbound
hurry hurry keep going
I hope you guys you guys remember the
advice we've given like every time we
move to a bit before it's important to
build double layer walls like this for
example is not a double layered wall so
someone comes by and takes this will be
right here and say hello but if you have
two layers like this it'll take that one
and then see this one behind it you're
safe it's going to be one of our most
fortified walls how many moles we have
very good who likes this idea guys
we're going to make a tunnel right here
this right here this yeah you're like
there's a cardboard piece back on the
dock for our area so we'll open it up
and put the cardboard piece on top and
then you go is
and there's a section over there we're
going to go up this is the best took a
quick break from the floor to grab this
the big cardboard yeah that works okay
check it out guys we got it installed
our first toe there were tunnel as well
that's cool this is already a pretty
long fort informated to here thank Allah
all the way down there right there we're
going to go through the tunnel now
nobody could ever see you in here nice
literally on the other end of the wall
I'm just making some final touch-ups
like right here and this is looking
sweet I think this is my new favorite
part of the fort yeah this is a good
room meaning because you have to go
through the tunnel to get here yeah we
got seats right here and then if we want
to get some snacks showing this yeah so
we're sitting here and you just got a
lunch bench and I always say there's no
way no one's going to come over here
mess is downstairs and you want to play
that out for something yeah cool Maps
who's there if you get the whole thing
as one giant for Matt and I we could get
some snacks and chill and watch a movie
guys yeah don't assume your invention
see him show them I wanna show you guys
my invention okay there's a good spot
for the movie let's play a vlog
so you can put this wherever we want
okay here's where we both can see it
kind of flat-screen TV right oh yeah
mobile there we go
always be prepared for if somebody knows
that you're building a toilet to perform
or somebody thinks you're building plug
report have like a secret hatch room
step this romance a secret so if there's
an employee down here so quickly turn
these side way this way like a door yeah
bro beep you got your own little
language spend the employee over there's
reorganizing toilet paper he's building
up the walls for us I think that's why
we need high misting because if he
reorganized any of this we're doomed
if you come on I don't know
boy just took this piece my back
pretty
didn't that was good but we have to get
to the other end now he's leaving go go
go boy he's getting closer guys put your
head down you freaky clothes I don't
know is it report back

way back to this Rhino
