excited because we love doing pranks at
colleges just because we like pranking
college kids it's kind of hard going to
like Walmart and just stores pranking
adults we've had trouble with that
recently but we're stoked because every
place is going and guess what
Aaron you tell he's a freshman
we're at UCCS so this has been his first
week of school and yeah if you've been
watching our videos for a while we go to
UCCS to prank all the time so it'll be
funny if we're pranking and we see Aaron

hopefully go see him say hi today we've
just arrived what I got this bag here
this is what has a supplies in it
blankets first day of school so excited
ah James look how many kiddos that are
here to prank
I'm so happy and there's tons of new
kids that's the best thing about college
yes new freshmen after summer is the
best looking at the freshmen yes
library people we're like just insane
it's like Christmas morning
we need something from the bookstore
tape or clothes pins
we need this to keep the perk what yeah
so if we don't have something to connect
it to the chairs or tables it's just
gonna kind of fall apart when you taper
yeah you should read the title we're
building a library for it but yeah look
at all these people that did get books
freshmen yeah they all have to get their
books
here's office supplies um yeah what tape
these batteries are rechargeable guys
we've never used any different batteries
for the years you save lots of money
because of that Watson rechargeable
batteries its rear end so I can't like
he goes here how was your first day at
school this is not my first day oh oh
piece T this selfies here at the school
Sienna it's also nice for for supplies
what are you building wherever we can
fighters take them that's her I'm gonna
be a whore on her know what next buyer
this is the aftermath how was that fort
bro it was okay we got it
Bellamy yeah it looks like you did good
with this one three layers yeah
you even made her move this is so funny
guys so far so the next victim are
getting is over there Andrews gonna put
blankets in the shelves I'll be really
funny now it's time to build the real
life fort in my library we know you've
been waiting for it now let's begin we
gotta figure out where we want to do
this someplace good maybe okay okay this
may be the spot for me
trailers it's table closer the only
problem is we have to be quiet
up here is it the quiet zone that's okay
once we're in the fort we can be sent my
louder than this do like these desks to
look they have under fitness oh yeah
that's true
like there's an entrance you can go
under there
Wow be quiet so this is the roof
you know how normal houses have rooms
yeah this is the roof okay we're gonna
push this table who's over there
sorry so I feel like right here would be
a good entrance like there's blankets
over there's a librarian oh no she comes
over here and sees this we put the tape
on all this so it's looking good so far
we got this to stay that's looking good
now we gotta add on some other elements
yeah
I'm just telling Andrew why does every
time we want to build a fort they're
restocking something they're restocking
the shelves in Walmart
she's restocking books first time going
in the fourth let's check it out
Oh what is it nice oh this is so cool
you can sit up right here and then for
night studies come under here
go on the darksome do you want to take a
nap I should come coffee so we need to
make it better a lot of point gets oh no
we can't invite friends in though yeah
we can go around and and see if the
students want to study in here
look what are you reading in here I am
studying if I was a random student and I
walked over here and saw this this I'd
be so good what what are you doing huh
he built the water here if you want to
check it out
sure it's really cool
he brought a friend well I should go in
there I shouldn't yeah they were just
forced by it
something else we need to make this a
real for what bill a sweet blanket for
over here if you wanna come check it out
sweet I got a recruit well go on in
sister I'm gonna come apart oh oh yeah
thanks
Oh that'd be a good idea we thought
snacks there was the librarian right
there but she didn't care that we were
building that's Excel you building yeah
Graham had a good idea he said every
four tasks to have a secret handshake to
get in which is true so you got what
you're gonna show me the secret there
everybody else done there's the secret
handshake I guess he you can now enter
someone has to let me in right now enter
yes Oh world as I don't bed jihad
headquarters you can fit four people
here sleeping bunk bed style this would
not be comfy though he's got snacks he
said yay

be our welcome mat oh hey you guys want
to check out our blanket for it we made
we have snacks I know kind of cool can
you use like a couple min yeah it's
either no remember what is it it's right
over there just a couple miles down so
we'll be right over it isn't that
sketches itself actually installed I

max yes Graham had to go by Graham
that's not Graham stick to Kim outside
bye-bye Graham where do you go guys you
can come in if you want you may want to
eat it but it's uh also something that's
not not allowed in the oh go ahead area
then we'll take it down
sigh dude this is a no conversation no
cell phones quiet study area I'm certain
that for Forks and for him you do yeah
we're just hanging we'll take it down
though sir
all right thanks yeah thanks for coming
guys
anyways goodbye for it
and table back to normal
Nick he missed the fort he was too late
we left the sign right there for her
well it kind of stinks that we got
kicked out basically yeah but I think
that the major problem was that we were
in the quiet area we were talking so
maybe if we try again in the non quiet
area what do you guys think
or even try and find a library that's
open for 24/7 or a different library
maybe 24-hour library bigger fort if you
liked it give it a like yeah give it a
like and I was going to say we can go to
like more college libraries because this
was only one there's so many different
libraries we can explore and build
Swardson yes yeah thanks also it did
just get very cold outside
ah your hawaiian skin is getting mad I
know I was literally just an opposite
whether like it was so hot I didn't want
to go outside and now I want to go
inside
bye guys
Buford what are you doing uh player get
off the couch I'm going to dinner this
evening with Britney's family to
celebrate Britney's dad's birthday
I'm currently eating some Chipotle
because my stomach was hungry

you enjoyed the fort video and we'll try
and make some more in the library which
I think will be really fun and DeMarcus
