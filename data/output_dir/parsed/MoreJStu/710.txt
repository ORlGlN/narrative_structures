tell you all about it and show you
what's going on it's this sort of
festival thing that apparently the
spinner it started yesterday it was
going today and it goes tomorrow

10,000 people going not all at once but
like throughout the each of the days and
over all the people from every state in
the United States were going to be here
and out of country so they're making it
like the big deal it's the first of its
kind so hang a little Caro Springs yep

together and they're drive-ins and got a
little Daisy I know there I don't think

Daisy so we just got her a bath
yesterday because she got dirty from
camping
we are here at the event and this event
is being held behind the Bass Pro Shops
here in Colorado Springs it's over there
by the haunted mines Andrew and they're
on the phone right now

house Jamboree this is the very first
one they have ever done like a festival
