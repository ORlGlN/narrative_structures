good morning everyone we have a special
announcement for you guys handed over to
Andrew ah alright so this is a bit of an
unexpected journey by going downtown
because we have an interview with a news
station
what Wow I don't really don't know how
Justin said he sent me a message but he
really didn't so I've heard about it
yesterday we don't even know what's
happening so let's go oh there we go
Fox 21 news story for Fox weiners and
Keller Springs I've seen a lot of your
prank videos online I'd be interested in
doing a story with you guys
yes all right we are in the studio now
and we are here with thanks for having
us out yeah well why do you have us here
funny and you know see who's actually
behind all the camera work and who that
obviously it's how it is you guys
this'll be fun thanks for having us here
what's your name
Tyler behind the camera rockin it
getting miked up here bear the studio is
so cool there's the news part the
green-screen
is that the weather screen over there
yep ha we can do at tonight's sports
broadcast tell me where you guys first
got your start what was the first prank
you were like okay I want to do this
long term well are we first started
making skip videos on our channel and we
didn't start doing pranks a little while
yeah we were we have launched a bunch of
different YouTube pranksters and then we
I think our first like I guess
caging we just went in we found a dog
cage and just went public and sat in it
so I guess so I don't even do a lot of
pranks at the library can you kind of
tell me about those and we're like why
you chose that lazy you're supposed to
be quiet in the library so anytime you
think of a idea that kind of disrupts
the peace I guess and like we like going
to college libraries too because college
kids tend to be more easy to prank I'm
sitting in the real life and newscasters
chair how do you feel remind you of our
new skit oh yeah hoi a news yeah this is
this is fantastic what the that's for me
I guess
you stay in there when they film look at
these legs though that's pretty crazy
what kind of camera is this Panasonic go
stand in front of the green screen
danger Wow so that's where newscasters
look take a look
Wow Mauro it's gonna be very cloudy as
the winter broadcast is storming in from
the East Coast so stay inside folks it's
gonna be a breezy one okay guys let's do
some dancing once the garden is about
yay big the clouds will dissipate so you
can see there's clouds this is where
people track so where they voice all
their packages ah yeah and this is the
control room so where you can see like
all the different stations you can see

jetlag isn't too bad on this trip but
we'll try and sleep on the plane before
in the vlog 1 2 just read some comments
Tim said what if oxygen is poisonous and
it just takes 75 to 100 years to kill us
whoa dad I've never really thought about
that honestly but if that were true then
how come back in the olden days like
Jesus times people live to be like a
couple hundred years old that's sudden
think about
Lewis said Andrew subdued should now do
comments of the day and now that Justin
is headed to Africa I think Andrew
should do comments of the day as well
but I'm sure he'll do some comments
