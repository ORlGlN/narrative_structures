hey guys we have a fun blog for you
today fort oh we haven't made one in a
while which Wow yeah we haven't sorry
about that I hope you guys are okay with
that anyways we have a fun idea for
today if it works so let's go see if it
will first so like Andrew mentioned we
haven't built for it a while but I'm
going to guess eighty five point seven
percent of you guys have been asking us
to do forts non-stop it just doesn't end
right well that's okay we like them but
we can't always do them that's what we
are not constantly at making forts yeah
so what exactly is an idea so we've been
wanting to make a fort out of toilets
like this but I think in the Box is
obviously not very fluid but there's
like plena toilets here we saw some
areas over here that might be for
potential
by the way these things are very heavy
yeah but there's room back there that
can maybe climb up keep it down
oh no this is as far as I can go and
then there's an opening like that we
have to make it okay okay I did keep
pushing
my turn my phone
cause it's kind of cool yeah space under
here no one will see us but if we can
move these boxes right here that'd be
perfect
only problem with this area as you can
see monkeys
just how much room up there really
here's what it looks like of your guys
you have these bleep walls
and I don't get over there where people
can see me so are you going to be able
to fit in there Elmo
I'm stuck in here it's small we're
trying to find more four areas because
that one is very dusty hard to maneuver
this might be good
okay I think we have found a cool
entrance is it clear you're clear check
this out Wow
I'm gonna go up and see what it looks
like
nice
it's very dusty up here but lots of room
for exploring it's pretty good
I just can't I don't think I don't think
we can hang out here that long because
this is so open there's more area yes
you're coming up this is a hook tender
care what do you see like an underground
fort which we can make a show I want
black today does very easily to see on
the walls I got black pants on to look
at the secret spy holes through the sink
again
where could Andrew be guys do you guys
see him what are you doing
goodbye looks so awesome it's like a
little secret door Kenard Nia because
literally if you got a ladder you can
climb up and just open the door and
there's that space in there I love that
okay
tell them your idea guys okay turn the
camera ran out in here okay who's the
good in here there's a 40
follow my finger okay we come in through
this hole I made Wow okay climb up here
then kind of here we can move those to
build a wall out of the way I also have
an idea
let me grab something yes see you guys
we need these sanitizing wipes PC it's
so dusty it this will help clean the
food
these to clean the duck yeah they have
complimentary of them thank you looks
like we have a clear goal going in all
right is the personal name mission go
captain clean up in here folks this
dusky
yeah your hand I told you Oh what are
you doing
time to go hit up there I got a splinter
time there's a big hole in the wall over
there
we solved the wall problem so now you
can't really see in perfect
all
the see it's kinda like are these these
boxes when there's this level which
could be a bed
so see it's pretty chill
somebody's right behind it what have you
done my selfies can I get better
can you just making it bad in a bubble
wrap
and in the bed nothing
some pretty comfy as well yeah
there's somebody over there please stop
just need some pushing Oh trying to
think of ideas on how to expand this
fort
we've got so far
over here there's a ton of space we just
got to move this box okay you're making
those sounds over there when I come in
now I clear a little work
that one I don't know this is probably
the best we're going to be able to do
for this fort but we got a whole store
guys there are four locations everywhere
so we're going to keep looking and see
if we can find even better spots
hurry
would you let those back latter one
thing close it got dust all over
themselves I don't look at my shoes all
right moving on to the next part of the
store a rich can port we're in the
garden center now looking to see if has
some sort of soil fortress bricks
garbage cans on what else is out here
dance nice work oh wow it smells like
fresh air yeah I love it
here's the garbage cans these aren't
that heavy so you think you can move
them right oh yeah
if if we need to get something off the
top shelf you know I found something
curious this I don't know if you can get
up that way
maybe in there maybe maybe you worth
checking out yes I told your tapes are
here oh this is called the topsy-turvy
Fork it's fun it's punky
let's game here try oh well that's
specially if I go like this oh there's
no comfy like fall
ah yeah what's interesting about this
thing is oh oh that employee at me she
saw me great
yes I know it's personal we're just
testing the car they're not looking out
here

carpet but we're still here we were
gonna title this blog back attack for
because for here what
hey this could you I want to come in
okay close the door guys my fingers oh

everybody yeah it's more of a one-person
bed
