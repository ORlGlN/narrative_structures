hey guys welcome back to mortgage do we
have a fun block for y'all today yes
you know we're into dirt guns and like
modding um showing through as an urban
here for a very particular reason and it
was cool about these rival guns that
have the tactical rail up here so we're
at this gun store Magnum a real-life gun
store and we're going to see if we can
attach a supersonic scope on here
real-life come on you may have done a
habit of course if you could battle that
would make no sense if there's not as
long as the guns that's a really cool
scope though yeah you know they just
look so cool
he's a commis oh man and oh that's cool
I thought that this should be perfect
right yeah look at this one has red and
women rather go so cool well we can get
ultra tactical on going holy mother
this one's $3,400 ah drew we should go
to dart Wars with that yeah we should
get that taste on test adverse the nerf
gun okay that might break my wrist again
by trying to shoot that worth it
broken wrist from his boss hey we're
just looking for a scope of sorts and
see if any of them will fit on here
I hope this works guys I don't know
oh yes will it stay just well the to
shore on there to none
it fits this way by pleasure spinning
around
they're away we can make glue or put one
of the real railrunner
sure you guys have been yes this is a
mod video sounds pretty cool Scott ran
free on the front but yeah this one
picks up one morning with oh you read it
fits interpreted will fit on your area
office yeah guys cuz I got an ER watch
out but you just look ahead oh I'm
looking and this has the way you said it
doesn't have batteries in it okay I have
the red dot is that what I learned those
oh man
take a look through this so look at that
now take a look look at your feet with
it well that infrared hood Oh thermal
scope look wait let me see Nick Nick
looks like through the thermal if you
look like an ancient grizzly man
kind of like Santa Claus a little bit oh
that's so cool I'm going about one yeah
heavy recoil nah
Oh
while Cobalt let's pretend like dude
that on they have to seek an exfoliant
oh yeah calibers this X 5 5 6 also shoot
223 thank you
we got the red dot sight and the rail
for the gun but now we're going to take
a look at some switch blades because map
does why not now they're actually legal
they used to be illegal but now legal
how cool that I've never actually all
the switchblade on me either
let me do all one oh I just pulled down
how's this work done trying to use
remember they're whoa okay face me I got
to see this crack off well this one's
500 another switchblade anyway this what
so cool put the colors you lead over
1955 legal tonight allow against your
freedom restored
yeah oh yeah this is a natural thing
hatchet was which players what does that
looks like a 10 well it is but also a
weapon you want this in case emergency
don't got a knife gun oh yeah
I was just on somebody action should
demonstrate no yeah all right yeah the
new scope red dot and we have some new
bullets
do you like glue or whatever
we are now at this different store I
found it yeah we need glue for this
plastic like a very specific rule
yeah the new rail on top of the old rail
where we got tons of different flavors
nobody seen James move oh yeah actually
perfect whoa break it dude that is sick
absolutely stunning
I can't wait to test this the red dot is
working guys yeah this is a dial to like
how much strength you want it all right
so here's the new tack rail which we're
going to glue under this one like that
so do you want it we put on this Oh
Great Scott it came out fast money
thinking a mess don't worry I'm very
smart like a paint brush you use what
you got and you don't even never install
fifteen minutes oh yeah is that good man
sure yes and then we can attach the
scope fifteen minutes in a day Lou is
dry right yeah we have to attach the
scope now I'm drawing that way okay just
Oh
check out this beauty guys holy cow turn
this up to max red dot oh my goodness
folks do I wanna see down the scope
fire oh it's open up some bullets yeah
test this aim out load it up kill like
this loader
oh yeah just sounds epic oh yeah just
like that it's full and ready to fire
who wants to be shot Nick don't hit my
hand oh yeah I had to get stitches last
night copes where you want me to put the
red dots I add on you Nick
so much s alright like on this right
nipple I'm pointing directly at them
right now okay we'll see where it hits
so you got to aim a little higher do you
gotta aim higher so wherever you're
aiming is higher oh you can adjust the
scope but it is water ball so I'm going
to aim higher than anticipated okay
you're a little left I have a for
this gun if you're on there arena
what so let me just okay you hold the
trigger down yeah and all you need to do
is it's like a machine gun you don't
mean to push it every time load shoot
hold it down check it out let's go fella
you broke it did it I can't believe you
did you like that shot oh yeah that hurt
I've got well mommy
yeah can I do a point blank to your I
suppose and you could point blank Meyer
oh right try this out and see what the
pain level is you can see some well it's
already but not Point Blank
Oh oh yeah right there right there right
there that's also cool upon that nerf
guns would leave that sort of damage not
me what we need to do is make sure we
get this glue this thing really stuck on
there yeah because that was cool until
it broke and then we can bring it to
like the nerf gun arena in town yes on
nerf gun nights because we definitely
need to do that we haven't been back
since the rivals have just been out in
general so we'll be going there soon
doors ok agers going to try kamikaze
mode you're going to meet all the
bullets on me and Nick and we have to
try and dodge them good luck three two
one
she wants to eat the nerf Olympics
trigger I shot one his Nick ricocheted
hit me in the forehead uh-huh that was
funny
Oh Alan did I get you guys babies pause
with a bullet like double attack yes I
asked Justin if I could shoot him in the
forehead but he said yes only if he can
shoot me in the forehead so like fine
safety first I would only say doing this
with a nerf gun is allowed anything else
no I think it did close I like super
close oh my gosh I think I want fire
oh my gosh we've got a big old man
suffer where's my car here you are my
head is I like her definitely but it's
not like nothing unbearable or no unsafe
you know what I mean even in handy yes
my turn to shoot you
all right try and keep your eyes open
during this it was so hard
really ready I wasn't that close
were you in here yeah one would not
nurse good visual Connie really directly
in the middle here yeah because you all
right yeah all darting to form no I
remember when we did a nerf gun
challenges you guys may have saw that
video where we had Aaron do point blank
nipple shot oh yeah that was funny well
I was in the video
yes I don't know Roger is so fun even if
it's so simple as a scope so we're gonna
get this scope like permanently attached
and then you say about a sick job yeah
paint job take it to nerf wars the arena
and they're gonna get scared so yeah
guys watching we appreciate you beats
out bye
