Brad King Soopers right now because DJ's
going to do something really fun today

good idea this like not actually doing
it watching you do it it's gonna be fun
yeah it will be fun for me but but am i
it's gonna be fun for us to watch if you
guys remember we did the habanero pepper
in the library and then we challenged TJ
and Dawes and Andrew Hales to do it but
DJ never got around to doing it so now
we're making him do it pretty much he's
gonna do four at once kind of just make
sure they're gonna fit here
my name is the bag big enough you might
need a double value yeah it's so hot
them I melt out the bottom that's what
I'm thinking to be honest I'll just wrap
it up a bug yeah that works yeah okay
need something to you know wash it down
with that should be a great calm butter
wait a habanero and a monster I'm
basically just like trying to kill me
it's okay I'm just gonna like I said
it's gonna be fun miserable by the end
of it which one do you think I should
get out of these two these are the same
now cuz I grab that this one from leg
over there like this one maybe this one
it's colder are you sure it's fresher

liquid

water but I want to make it worth
meaning to have milk and I have not died
