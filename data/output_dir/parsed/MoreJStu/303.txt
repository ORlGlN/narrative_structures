this an amusement park
I don't know so it's a fun zone here on
Pikes Peak is called Santa's workshop
it's like the North Pole so that's what
is called the North Pole literally hole
it's been around for 60 years
Santa's actually here we're going to try
and do some stuff here and maybe build
some sort of fort
inside hopefully find some cool area so
let's go 60 years of fun the North Pole
here we come Santa okay
oh wow I came here to meet a manager
used to come here when we were kids so
this is weird being back here because
this is been really 14 years so it's
just us here with a bunch of little
babies what in the name of Christmas
past

Frant flash disposable cameras man how
many pictures this has to be very old
maybe none look at the guy he looks like

this is literally the North Pole all
right this is like real ice thought this
was stone but yeah he's not kidding it's
imagine if the Bears were this big the V

pretty much parents in kiddies and then
there's Andrew before we continue the 4x
cabbage adventure we're trying to ride

bad vlogs pickles for Santa yes I just
picked up some pickles here habanero
chunk there's one habanero so as you can
tell we weren't able to build a fort at
Santa's workshop at the North Pole so
but that doesn't stop us we're gonna
build a fort today whether you like it
or not we're gonna still make it happen
so right here at Walmart and we're going
to uh you know explore a little bit
because Walmart is very before friendly
hey so let's go outside you see on a
normal day we might have just given up
that we wouldn't be able to build a fort
but not on fort mess of course we'll
continue if happen so behind me is the
diaper box arena now we have a kind of a
fun idea this area has the wall here and
it has many layers so how does this
sound Andrew one double decker diaper
fort
guys I am now in the fort in the
building has begun got to build up all
the walls first of course as always and
then maybe we can make it up to the
second floor but I just love that this
is against the wall makes everything so
much more easier to work around what
have you been doing I've been working on
the upstairs cuz this is gonna be the
double decker diaper dungeon yeah
there's a lot of space up there
so this is the upstairs I can probably
get in
and you're from India
he did it
I was an employee that just didn't you
know what oh my gosh that was epic who
kind of tied up here on the second level
I mean I can't really crawl over there
cuz it's bars in the way I'm acting
kinda go under it but oh I can see a lot
of people up here though pretty fun
how's the weather up there oh I still
can't believe that employed in cs:go
Creek there's another fort we saw over
there by the water bottles and all the
drinks that we have never done before so

was filming I don't know if the story
made sense but when when we were hiding
this lady couldn't reach our product on
the top shelf and the employee couldn't
reach it either so she's like let me go
get someone else to help and when they
all left I kind of pushed everything
forward and they came back and I like
what I thought this was too far to reach
someone back there and they looked and
