if you find that good spots where it's
like I would never look there but I am
Oh what the I do it hey guys welcome
back to war Jase - the guys are doing
super duper today whoa it's for Friday -
I am so happy
are you excited as always because why
why are you excited because they were
doing a new style for Friday we're doing
for hide-and-seek find me challenge oh
man explain how that works okay here's
what's going to happen we're going to go
inside build a fort and then one of our
friends is going to come to the store
and try and find us so we got to be
pretty sneaky and maybe in a spot that
this person is not expecting we'd be in
oh absolutely
maybe a small spot right I think we
should build some decoy forts as well
okay let's go inside and build so you
guys all know where we usually like to
build forts in the toilet paper section
12 bood we can't hide in the most
obvious spots we can go check them out
to see what they look like yeah but what
should we do
we gotta look around but as we're going
to other spots we can build up a decoy
board yeah let's go to Larry for real
quick
cheese ball fort injured home
yes see total paper section is looking
pretty good open as well second-story
also looking good but
well great what does happen we were
building the decoy port in someone
caught us now we I wasn't filming it but
she came up to Andrew all he was
building up a wall to play
I just reorganized this like okay I can
help you put it away take me out take
daddy here so I guess some people have
been making forts here before because
that was random cut we're still
searching come on going it was found a
cool fort spot we got caught again yeah
we thought the strollers are up against
the wall it's perfect but yeah well
there boy came up to us and was really
nice
so I'd strength to in this store so I
think we should we have a different
location he was really nice about it and
we want to be respectful so let's try
this again a difference for guys are you
ready I'm ready
by the way guys nick is going to be the
one finding us today in the fort good
things we'll be able to find us yes oh
really oh yeah okay oh we're gonna go in
the store and you come find this in like
15 minutes
oh yeah okay okay good luck peace out
we have some good ford ideas by the way
you got to go kind of quick we got 15
minutes yells - whoa
is there room behind the bubble back
potentially how much time we just got in
here yep I like 13 accounting because
mitch has watched our videos so he knows
where we usually go
so where are we not going yes the bubble
wrap would be perfectly I feel like
there's a there's a lot in here we could
get in so this is what's on the other
side of the bubble wrap kind of full bow
ah okay we need to move some of theirs
there's too much supplies so we're
moving them upstairs
okay you're clear go go
all right get in here you can grab it
great roof on here besides pretty open
but oh no I like the color in here hey
what what's up exponent does that jump
off the high dive and relocate the
Melvin usually pretty much seats well I
guess if you don't sit too hard they met
me some poppy but they don't a pop them
because I'm here to buy it but okay very
less coal Nick guys what are you doing
under we organize yeah we can see the
paint counter it's kind of open right
there so move some of this stuff open
this area up those are heavy right
please don't take a piece of our form no
problem above all
cool
calm up
so no one walks by no hey bro we're
hiding come find us you okay
you do good luck bye dude this is so fun
yeah I love this any ivory all right got
the phone call they're hiding so let's
go find them we working on some
camouflage ideas check this out
it's a really good sneaky idea imma take
you'll the look in it see another roll
and dangers hiding underneath that's
perfect
yes my work yes but then I don't have
anything
Oh
he's going - I shoulda held up here I
could have seen his face I thought he
was filming while he was walking yeah
well cut to that clip I think they
usually hide like the toilet section so
I'm gonna start there okay we called a
nigga bout five minutes ago
we're going to give him about ten
minutes and then we're gonna based on so
he might be able to get some clues from
the face slam but I don't know see long
as we don't film this green stuff yeah
he like that is you come waiting this
way he won't yeah for like this way like
this
but we can we can see where he is
bacon alright you're really far away I
don't know there are a lot of really
good places to hide here oh this looks
like a good nope so this is not as easy
as I thought it was gonna be because he
literally could be anywhere it could be
a first second I don't know I was just
in any Andrew where would I be
Justin and I were texting and he said
he'd seen me already so I've been a lot
of places though but he just text you
well I said five ten minutes we'll call
you he's like okay I send them that says
have you seen me yet I say maybe I think
so the real answer is yes Nick we're in
the bubble wrap jeez it's not that hard
what okay in ten minutes tradition is
poor connection oh we can see you at
least I know but the point is
immediately you so have you seen me at
honestly yes we have
we saw you pretty quick okay well that
means I need to get out of it are you
near carpet no I'm in the plumbing
section well that's a good hint for you
carpets are near you draw near then
we're going to come up with a cool rhyme
you
and it goes
I found you ah come to the entrance
hello welcome
yeah do we you walk by the first time it
was awesome yeah I spent like the
longest time in like the back section
places back and forth like yeah you went
down the aisle like immediately even the
first came in
oh really yeah and then you left yeah
because I figured yeah you usually
hidden over here I know we wanted to
find a different spot where we haven't
before
run oh hey guys okay we're going to do
we're going to do this again except
Justin and Nick are going to hide but
this is going to be at this speed round
so I'm gonna try and find them in like
30 seconds they got 30 seconds to find
the Ford and hide yeah this last round
Nick counted for about 15 minutes
good job of things a new style so
alright who's ready for rapid fire me me
alright so I'm at the bathrooms I'm
going to count to 30 y'all are going to
run in hi
ah what do we just say a new rule you
can't go past the kitchen section down
there a good bit creating balance oh
okay
Oh once you're down the matter okay I'll
go in the bathroom okay are you ready
yes okay I'm going in by twenty one
twenty two twenty four thirty Oh
thirty thinks I'm a psycho okay so I
think his time's up to spend 30 seconds
I saw him come out of the bathroom we're
still searching yeah due back here
dude this is perfect
they don't think they're in the lumber
section there's not really any places to
hide
looking at doors now I don't think so
literally we didn't even have to do much
building it's like this was already
built
we just crawled from over there and now
you can see this is like a bathroom
Hardware area
picnic I always tell cool spots and he's
looking for us and they he could go hey
let's go here immediately
here's where our feet are you can see
there next I'll bet because he
now we just beat
just so much harder than you think I
can't find a good spot to where it's
like I would never look there but I am
no one
harder than you
oh what the
I do it ah you just saw my camera
barrage yeah yeah dude I literally was
just right here and I was like fella
come in here were you filming when I
said that yeah what I just guess for the
port yeah dude that's why I was like so
many spots are just perfect
ah I should get my phone down yeah you
do aha
I feel like this is it's so good if you
could evilly mental if you don't really
search yeah if I just saved up and
didn't have my call yeah okay man I just
had a feeling I looked right here I was
like this was like an entrance there's
like a spaz spot over that way
that's why I yelled hey fellow demon
because I was filming I didn't thousands
oh okay okay I thought you guys going to
go in the insulation ah some good spots
over there
see ya take the plane yeah we're back at
Alex Hey oh yay guys okay we need you
