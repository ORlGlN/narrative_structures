no to that question
stop right now and tell yourself you're
gonna have a good day yeah and boom it's
just that easy guys and you're watching
a fort Friday video so yeah it only goes
up from he only gets better
and today's for it's gonna be super
special because I've never been to this
store before to build a fort I know we
were in here recently and we did look
around and we found some cool spots so
let's go inside let's go they got a lot
of cool toys I bet you have to have
build yourself though I want to build a
bounce house on the lake huge one is
there anything behind this no what what
yeah but if you could shine some light
back here be great
let me shine some light guys well is it
focus no yay do it if we get back there
my goodness hole okay where should we
now it's just immediate like best fort
ever dude okay first you guys try out
this fort over here yeah like this
you know what this reminds me of home
alone Marc Torres has tons of these
cardboard like what are these just take
a look buying there dude
is it big the bad thing about this area
is like we're kinda in the middle of the
whole aisle guys yes it's cool in here
folks
I mean it's about it's about
shoulder-width but I can stand up and
there's room for seats maybe like it's
not too dark in here to be honest
what's that post like there's handles so
you can like movies I promise when you
like walk it makes you sounds can you
hear that
what oh this is the storage room
what are you doing out there we can have
separate forts throughout the store
that's true I don't know because I put a
chair there and you like sit down easily
you could buy a board game and play oh
yeah true fort number two there's an
opening here's where we are guys so if
you want to sleep and just not be able
to move this works is this one gonna
work no fine
get out before something someone sees
you okay we're doing another final look
through to see if we missed any like
epic spots only we can get in here can
you see in there with the camera no
there's just like a big box in there
with no products behind it but it's a
big wall we don't know how to get past
it
it's behind this let us in room
I guess it's impossible yeah it's the
best fort okay so we know the front the
fort we found first only came in will
work so we found some soft chairs and I
mean soft we're gonna bring the chairs
and see if we can go on the part we've
made room there's the opening now
hideaway for an employee to stop looking
over here just look conspicuous
ow just bend over and clocked my face on
this
so yeah it's kind of ribbing here it's
just as you can see I'm like completely
sideways but we got a long haul back
there this is the entrance I've got the
two chairs in now I just gotta scooch
over
Wow
okay me you can come in guys close the
door you don't it's hot in here yes but
if you lay down thick on the metal is
kind of cool this is nice yeah I gotta
hit my setup hang on this is nice
and now here's what dark it is don't get
scared I'm going on a secret mission
don't look outside open the door
there's someone
ouch sir
the jet stopped I was looking everywhere
ouch sir
and dark yeah are you sleepy right now
I just watch their air conditioning what
should we do now
you should find a game okay then get go
back to the other floor so we can get
better chairs and play like a game okay
the tough part is seeing if the aisle is
clear since you can't see through the
cardboard I've taken a quick peek make a
sound nope they're distracted
Oh someone's coming
Derek saw me by the way Derek he wasn't
an employee he was just like looked over
here and I looked at him he's like look
where'd he go he went shopping how are
you out of here this is terrible by the
entrance so it's like a five out of ten
yeah plus I'm starting to sweat
come now
did you like our fort yeah not bad
that's pretty country we had nice chairs
in there so yes the whole length of the
wall there kinda
oh you saw him apparently it is kind of
noisy in there and we're looking for a
game we can bring in to the fort yeah
or forget that just by all the figis
yeah we can do it toy unboxing yeah
here's an interesting game you can try
me huh which board game company is
running out of ideas
also GUI Louie if you're interested pick
a winner huh by Jenga and play it in 40
yes who can win Jing is pretty fun by
the way class yay for snacks which one
this is the biggest box of bean boozled
ever I'm not paying $30 to barf
all right got the chairs got the snacks
the game probably so these are the new
chairs they fit well them up now
this never gets old putting in forts and
eating food and being sneaky every time
we build forts I just think of how
awkward it would be if somebody found us
in here the here snacking open it up
it's two grown men playing Jenga eating
Walker though it just sounds like the
strangest sentence yep
yes did you play Jenga what me hmm every
night with my wife
really no leave hashtag Justin or
hashtag Andrew in the comments to who
you thinks gonna win Jenga the winner
will be announced soon who gets that
reference to a youtuber okay bye set it
down but this is why this game is fun in
here cuz it's loud and whoever loses
cousins is a ruckus okay
oh yes I see somebody who is it hello
yes you can only do one hand though
right
no there's one Hey yes
what dude oh no you guys it almost fell
but I can still get it Wow come out
