good morning everybody hope you're doing
well welcome back to vlogs for those of
you who have been watching our channel
for a while now you probably know that I
have a giant crack in my windshield can
you see that it goes literally across
the whole windshield and I haven't had
it fixed for the longest time today that
changes look at that big crack here at
stay flight to get it replaced I hope a
lot of you are happy because I've seen a
few not more than a few comments telling
me to get it replaced
I've just been slacking so today is a
day while now we're leaving to go get
your car now right although they didn't
fix my windshield because they said it
was going to be seven hundred dollars
three hundred and eighty dollars more
because this windshield has a rain
sensor on it so I'm not getting a new
windshield yet I'm not paying them and
the wait continues for the huge crack to
be fixed there it is
that man's on the hoverboard we are at
the Citadel mall now we're never in this
part of town so I figured we'd stop in
and yeah this mall was kind of like I
don't know it's kind of like a bacon mod
there's barely anybody ever hear this
we're on the lookout for something as
you guys know we have that fog machine
and we thought it'd be really fun if we
made another fog adventure but we put a
bunch of strobe lights and disco lights
glow sticks of the sorts probably they
have a party store here because we want
to find those yeah I don't even know
where to look I've been hearing forever
this store looks promising but ten
minutes yeah kind of do this strange but
like the rage store I guess that's kind
of what we're in the market for I guess
we'll get over there do that what going
whoa yeah definitely what we need and
they got hoverboards oh you need some
instant cash I mean all right so that's
really give me for this guy
five bucks we're just trying to figure
out how much you're gonna so far there
any views zero dollars
absolutely not this man is up to no good
are you trying to hack in my phone sir
he's doing hacks please trust Shu City
guys we're wondering if any of these
doors have Easy's we just want to see
what they look like in person know where
they are though oh yes baby Jordans man
it's been about 10 minutes or going back
to the store to see if it's open
yes good we got a bunch of random stuff
in this mask that glow yeah those are
pretty intense that'd be kind of cool
but they're 60 bucks and they got these
kind of LED stuff so but Oh
glow shirts over here let's take a look
like stripper or dark
elsif space with 125 you interested I
mean if it was cheaper than maybe yes
but sorry space were kind of cool in the
fog but yeah well sorry yeah I didn't
have anything we were going to get I
mean we're gonna go to a real party
store or maybe Walmart
alright Walmart what sort of supplies
you got today don't let us down
Walmart we're getting tons of ideas
fluorescent makeup mystic crayons yes
that'll be fun and then also you guys
want us to die out here you'll find I
guess we will spray on shampoo out
three colors guys alright these weren't
even any of the things that came in to
get these the light bulbs we gotta get
we gotta get a black light yes light
bulb so many options these are finger
lights huh that glow spider no way these
are going to be fun in the dark okay I
think we need some glow necklaces okay
let's get out of here now this is a
party who's coming
I got this gigantic spider on my garage
door get out of your bud we are back
home now got all the stuff out not sure
what we want to do first dye our hair
put a fog I did plug in the fog machine
because it needs the warm up but these
devices this one's going to be really
cool in the fog
it's got like a few different colors and
then all colors we are in the garage now
it's a bit fog in here we've been using
the fog machine but now we're trading
out light bulbs for backlight test test
okay test number one oh wow
this is a real-life haunted house now
trying to make the garage as dark as
possible so what we're going to do is
tape some cardboard to the outside this
is the garage window
you got some cardboard this should black
it out next up for the crazy fog party
it's hair dye so these are the fun
compatible flavors I guess you're going
first I guess so I had this idea of
putting a bag over so you don't spray my
shirt or your skin if you want to like
put it up to your hairline yeah or there
