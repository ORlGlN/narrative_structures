moving on me and Brittany are here it's
early in the morning we're dropping
Daisy off at Camp Bow Wow because today
we're flying to Hawaii so yeah we can't
leave Daisy at home so we're leaving her
here to hang out with other puppies and
chill for the time being ready to go
yeah alright we have to actually our
flights at 11:40 and it's always good to
be an hour early to the airport so we
got to go because it's almost it's like
9:30 we've made it to the Colorado
Springs Airport we're flying out of
colors range has obviously
but it's unfortunate we have
tulay overs so our flight leaves here at
11:20 and we get to Hawaii at 8:20

day of flights folks oh thank you

with the house we are literally at the
back of

we just landed but I'm still in shock
about this incredible

the earth
while we have made it to Dallas Texas
Fort Worth Airport but it's time for
lunch since we have had breakfast where
are we at right kiddo yes
I wish they'd Chipotle but you know but
we'll have to do we don't really annoys
me about airports they overcharge
everything and if you guys didn't know
normal Q Thomas don't charge extra for
guacamole your case no but this one does
for some ways
really annoying while we're waiting to
get on our flight I was just testing the
Wi-Fi here and I wanted to show you guys

Lotus 53 for anybody who doesn't really
know that's just insanely fast and so
