the vlog I'm going to be heading to the
camera store because got this camera
here the Canon 70d this isn't working
it's having like some problems with like
the lens communication thing so I think
I'm going to send it in I want to see if
they also have a lens that I can get so
if I can get this camera fixed and get
this lens I think it'd be awesome to
take you know whenever we travel and
just to get cool shots with so let's
head to the camera store and see how
much this is going to cost to fix and
just check out some of the lenses lenses
they have okay we are here
Mike's camera our local camera shop this
place is so awesome
alright so let's see what they can do so
many lenses I'm going to give you a fast
one
- all right so I'm getting it sent up to
the store up in Denver they said they
can take a look at it and see what the
problem is how much it'll cost to fix so
if it's not too much may just do that or
just get a completely different camera

looking at I really want to get so we
shall see folks quick stop my best buy
check out their cameras all right

buy anything but I got a ton of awesome
information on cameras and just got
really educated in them I don't know I'm
excited to just think you know learn
more about photography and it was
awesome we searched high and low for a
coffee shop that had coconut milk
because Mary doesn't drink dairy the
only option laughs those that come home

coconut milk but we're trying the new
methods you don't have one of these at
our house but it's a French press and

smells like chocolate heaven inherently
want to hear from there like they
probably have that such a cool theater
this should be a fun musical because
there's kids in it obviously it seems
full of rock
okay someone's ten that girls ten years
old
Annabelle but she's like an adult with
all these other people this is what it
looks like to be on Broadway
seven o'clock show time is imminent are
not careless
it's the intermission right now pretty
awesome enough hearted bracket kids
actually play their instruments so well
school rock musical was epic like you're
saying is basically like going to a
concert but I was thinking like before
we saw it like school rock of all the
movies to choose making music on
we'll rock but it was a good idea so
Mason you wanna like wish I did more

do like maybe cool stuff but there's
like ten year old few years old they're
rocking it out on stage oh so cool I
don't know how they do that for like
every show and I guess we could go see

central park
