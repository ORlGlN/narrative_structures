yo guys welcome back to blogs we're
building another fort today but first
we're doing a giveaway we're gonna give
one of you guys who clicks the link to
that in the description I think there's
two to follow us and I've got me $500
it'll be on Monday the 28th we're doing
a livestream giving away 500 bucks so
follow us online without me it'll be fun
but anyways let's get to the fort making
we are currently at the mall here we
haven't ever looked reports in the mall
we want to find tons of different force
yeah this gonna be fun so we're at the
sporting goods store currently we are
going to be fort scavengers today we're
making our way into the main part of the
mall we didn't see too much in there so
here we go we were hoping there won't be
any kids in the play area because then
we can make it for it in there but there
are kids and that would just be the most
awkward thing ever
I found our first mini farm okay there
we're in here wow this is good if we had
chairs we could come in here like chill
plus we can see outside we see any
intruders yeah they can't see us but we
can see them I'm searching oh I see a
man no you can do it I can't on it
Grill for Tizen uh-huh
what is time to go into a freezer
yeah we got to make sure it's spacious
enough for food because we have a lot of
clothes yeah we can easily stay 24 hours
in one of these and then like when they
close you just get out of it but that
would be illegal
yes i dro
an employee was walking by supposed to
happen
oh that's why your tech boy I thought
you were knocking thing he was like
please stop talking
yep it has enough room for food oh good
to know
mall security is having a meeting in
there it's almost time for Santa I want
to meet Santa so bad all right we're in
the furniture section of Macy's now what
will they have oh no now I can see in
the dogs man we need that for exploring
and for building and all sorts of see
when it's dark you can't see me because
the lights so bright
this hat is aw funny the mall basically
had no forts so we're going to Lowe's
now which is basically like Home Depot
but maybe it'll be different a lot of
you guys like their Home Depot fort so
when do again but check this out it's
snowing first day of snow here for
Colorado yeah
my gosh no blows it's crazy that two
days ago we were wearing shorts and
tanks and we're rafting on the lake and
now today it's freezing and snowing
outside this is almost a fort as I think
carpet dungeons yeah you try
oh this is thinking but it leads to this
underground lair we've been made before
really yeah
okay okay we're blocking that part so we
can go in there ah nice this right here
okay
and we can stack these up a little bit
right there yeah I'm just gonna go in
and test out before are you ready let's
take it go it's clear
guys I'm in the fort and we have to get
to that side though so I'm under here
okay
made it through ow my head
oh my gosh dude the static electricity
just set my head on fire I'm gonna go
and hit it underground bunker yes we can
do two levels basically otherwise uh-oh
carpets was a good idea carpet for it
yeah I'm gonna do this sooner
I feel like take a nap in here
see I told you guys we could do a double
level but this I'm not satisfied we need
bigger and better for it yeah this one's
comfy though but let's keep exploring
yeah this will be the main headquarters
for let's go find something else if way
to come to this is how to exit
bachelor booth is needed from the board
cutting area faculty hey it's a little
different than Home Depot here I mean
it's got the same vibes but like the
shelves are a fake a little better
alright so we examined all the areas
this seems to be the best one so we're
going to start here
and then this is so perfect eyes I can't
believe this
so check it out walls on every single
side so you I'm literally standing up
right now what there's that boy I think
yeah here's a quick tour we can pretty
much make it to the very top
if there's it's too small but good help
I'll be right around corner for sure we
have so much room to explore guys how's
it looking out there huh how's it
looking employees I know I heard him
wanna come in no well you can't why
just kidding we got to make sure that
it's safe because I hear employees
behind us too if they move aboard the
place yes see right there man an
employee yeah 25 cents for this
with me
yes and roommate now we got to clear
some space for activities how do you
find a good spot to hide yeah I just
like this so we can stand up like all
the floors we make we usually can plus
we got lights up here if it gets dark
we're exploring down the hallway there's
a problem right there there's a big hole
so easily see in this is nice
now I'm we're on ground level folks if
I'm pull you on spy very very seen
employee right outside the door how's
the weather up there what
we're trying to get out of here but we
can't see if there's anybody
give me the part you act like you found
yes sure hard part is done guys you see
that bird down there guys
what the what the huh
do they have a fort down there I know it
we have to go check out me get what
we're charging them huh what you're not
you're you're only safe up there
temporarily you freaks uh hi
dang it yeah just have anyone this is
very minion toilets here I am pull it
work hurry make a distraction
Ethan oh ah this is comfy a good comfy
toilet fort yeah see and this one got
outlet - it does right behind you yeah
ah yes of course so we can totes you
know bring our phone chargers I wish we
could get up with later okay so we just
thought of a fun idea and you guys have
to let us know if you wants to do this
since they have outlets we can bring in
our own TV and our PlayStation and play
video games maybe watch a movie or
something yes we have to do this like if
you guys want part two of this we're
outside now I don't know why because
it's freezing out here but we have to
keep looking for forts before how does a
24-hour igloo challenge
what was that we survived in an igloo
all night oh this is freezing out here
but we could easily climb up these
because nobody is out here if it was
warmer outside we could build something
out these bricks yeah
but forget that today I think this may
be that one of the last Forks in the
store
check this it's a cool entrance huh are
you kidding me
so this is
welcome yeah what do you think of this
one again more walls built for us we
didn't even need to do the work another
escape what quiet you maniac so small in
here huh so this section has a lot of
lights which means plugs so we're taking
a look so I can stand up in this section
but look we got a wall of plugs and then
the source right here so we can and
there's like walls everywhere this could
be a good spot for gaming you can look
if you want oh there's a plug plug plug
plug plug plug no so that's the best
spot so many plugs it will be done idea
I'm so ready if only we could figure out
the Wi-Fi password we could game on the
Internet
all right back home now and I guess
that's the end of the video it is I love
doing forts as do you guys because we've
seen an endless amount of lore for
sports sports for sports park what Ford
sports anyways hope you like today's
vlog don't forget to leave a like yeah
because just go ham on the likes and
then we'll do the PlayStation 4 idea
