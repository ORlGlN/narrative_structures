to be on the Meredith Vieira show and
we're going to be doing a dance - in a
live band this is the name of their song

listen to these lyrics this hotel Rin
has free water bottles and you feel it
yourself ready go
so crazy around the 14th floor you come
here so many buttons
as you can see there's no 13/4 yeah this
reminds me of this Mitch Hedberg joke
he's talking about is like New York City
doesn't have 13 floors but you've got in
the 14th floor
you know floor you really on so uh
Rockefellers wall

here's the show we got 15 minutes until
we're live on TV you're sitting Mary
dancing like well Andrea is just kind of
crazy when he dances his arms go
everywhere and people he can't clear on
a dance floor and it's not because
people like he's this guy in the middle
of a circle and everybody's watching
it's because people fear for their lives
everywhere all right we got to check out
this guy Andrew come on out
finally we have Mary and Andrew this was
Andrew doing his signature squeegee move
before his left enough we all loved

meeting Tom Bergeron the man the myth
the legend so cool this is so cool

literally across the hall from like
where they filmed Jamie Fallon they
filmed SNL in that building a bunch of
other cool shows and it's just Oh

to the show
you're in good hands with Billy and
Sharon
whip you into dancing Andrew xoxo
Meredith oh that was a nice letter from
Meredith thank you
all right it's morning now just woke up
whoa
I don't even know what to say about that
trip it was so awesome man and I have
always wanted to go to New York because
neither neither of us have ever been
there and you finally got to go yes I
think the reason why I've always wanted
to go to New York City is because of how
much Seinfeld I watch I mean we've
literally got every season on DVD is the
best show ever
so I was just a huge blessing or so
thankful that we were able to go on the
Meredith Vieira show live and this is
just the beginning because we've got
some other big plans Justin and I for
others show type stuff so you guys are
going to want to be subscribed so you
don't miss out on anything it's going to
be a fun year fun for vlogs so thanks
again Meredith for having us on the show
that was very nice of you and if you
guys have any like questions or anything
about the show or whatnot just feel free
