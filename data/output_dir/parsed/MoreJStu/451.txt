let alone smells like illegal substances
by anyways we're here at leech pit
because Andrew and I have been wanting
to film Richmond lifestyle part two for
the longest time now and we're looking
for new suits for our characters and
this place has antique antique clothing
so we're gonna see we're also really
high six thousand feet up Wow
but all the vintage games they have
super Mario Zelda I just had this game
he would be instant I sold out the
garage sound like my max
y know a Nintendo 64 game boy lunchbox
this would be the super rich man
lifestyle rope for Andrew
we didn't find any suits or anything so
right now but with Brittany hey wifey
we're a lifetime remaining Andrea Mary
here because we're doing a yoga class
honestly I've never actually tried yoga
like a full class like this before so I
have no idea what to expect
it's about to start though hey Mary
what is this hot yoga I don't know what
that means but it's kind of hot here
he's turning the heat up right now I
guess do you know how hot it gets in
here he said I guess about 19 what and
humid
alright we just finished with our first
hot yoga class how do you feel it was
like medium spicy yoga what would you
guys think okay andrew has a secret I
would change okay now that we're in the
car tell me honestly what you thought it
was interesting I think I thought it was
funny because obviously we don't know
any of the yoga names of the poses or
anything and so he like start to name it
off all he's like animal poses okay half
pigeon sleeping tiger no it was funny to
me but it's it was crazy to see like all
these stretches and stuff I've never
done stretches like that before and it
was getting really hot in there and I
don't think something like that's for me
but all the glory to the people out
there who do yoga ooh everything's
Justin should do it with me
comment below cuz I want to do it for my
anxiety and just to calm everything and
place it like work that you've never
even before like a mini workout and then
get you more flexible because I'm a zero
percent of flexible just get out you
