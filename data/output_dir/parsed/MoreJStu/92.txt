guys you know what day it is it's Friday
what's that mean for Friday
we love building forts I guess let's go
in and start building oh yeah we got
some fun ideas for you guys today so
stay tuned you never know what's gonna
happen in a fort episode uh-uh
we're in the store and we usually when
we go into fort building we kind of have
an idea of what we want to do but every
store is different we're at a completely
different store I've never been at this
one before so so let's go kind of see
what we got working with today put the
spear down
the kulfi could get that in the fourth
here's an option guys look at that and
you got the windows so you can open the
windows here's another area yeah
bunk bed zone
have some sort of defense Walter oh yeah
oh that's nice okay that's an option
this is another one right behind this
like model bathtub hey I can see you
darn it look up here guys
lots of room there it's not bad you can
see out this way that's a problem we're
trying to figure out how to get over
that way but I can't I can't get over
there
there's no room hello
- Pixies walls now uh he's pretty roomy
it's like a sit for it can't really
stand up yeah it's okay relax lounge
yeah the toilet fort this fort it is
actually pretty good but it's hard to
expand so what we're gonna do is
actually fortify what we got going here
we're gonna add a table like a light
system maybe grab some food and some
rugs as well right make it comfy this
will be our home base and then we're
gonna challenge ourselves to go out and
get up somewhere really high yeah I
think we can do it but first we got to
get out and get some supplies guys if
someone looked down the ion side baby
guys okay here's the toilet we're hoping
it fits doing one way to find out you
try Oh
grab the rugs the rugs are installed
here for a nice comfort you got the for
it pretty much set up and it's lunchtime
so we are going to get some lunch to
have in the fort where we at what are we
gonna bring in this time my pizza you
thought it was gonna be chick-fil-a but
we're switching it up to this time guys

potty I mean we could have offered him
this toilet right oh well all right bass
try out the toilet okay imagine trying
to go to the bathroom like this
all right guys for the final challenge
what is it when I try and climb to the
third level of something in this store
it's gonna be hard because there's a lot
of fortification that this store has
done to make it in able to do yeah it's
hard man right now leave a comment for
us let us know what item or thing we
should try and put in our next fort yeah
do it right now comment we got the
toilet in what can we do next I don't
know why it just seems too recently I
always get hurt when we're making forts
I was just peeking out and I saw
somebody in a batch of real quick and
rammed my back into the corner of this
we found a spot we should be able to get
up to a third level this is definitely a
shoe English guys so we had a climb
through here
shimmy our way up that way and poke our
heads through the cabinets
don't have like the Backson yeah doesn't
make any sense
are you going in he's going in guys
I hate those guard dogs
dust you did it much dust but I did this
is like a maze there's stuff everywhere
so this is a big gap right there cuz
it's Anders only on the aisle someone
sees him just in time I hear somebody
another aisle you're lucky they didn't
come see you I went over there I saw
they were just looking at
faucets so they're busy so we can either
go under here and try and get up this
way but I'm saying there's a big gap
here - he's doing it
daredevil now
no she's he out there someone walks by
here they'll be like hey man picking his
way he's sneaking his way through
through this maze we're trying to make
it her make her way into that down here
dude what is with these just I don't
know it's just flimsy
it's just adds to the challenge oh it's
like a tunnel I know there's a zone back
here you can get to we don't know what's
on the other side of the tunnel but we
want to try it's hard to assess is what
hard to crawl it
there's an entrance right here
Oh someone's walking by they might see
me this natural tunnel is very nice
hello
we did make it up to the third storey oh
man hey dusty the fort has been a
success folks I love him we have
