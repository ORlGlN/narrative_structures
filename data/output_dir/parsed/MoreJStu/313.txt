ready to conquer the snow yeah we're all
strapped in ready for the first run of
the season once you get down there and
there's one that takes you up a bit
higher than this one
Cody's board is falling apart so easily
go fix it
yeah we're just had some good runs in so
far there's not too many jumps which
we're kind of sad about but that's
alright we're trying to get this GoPro
shot where the first person chucked it
over their head to the next person and
then slow down the line adjustments
justin through it this thing just popped
out of the case when i hit the crap we

they're gonna go off the jump that's
down there I'm gonna come around and
film it and see if they can get any air
you can do it to Cody all right go to
your turn
Cody's very inexperienced and has never
gone off a jump before this will have an
interesting outcome get up oh wow hey

the end of the vlog thanks for watching
and stay until the end if you did if
you're watching this thank you but a
quick thought for you guys before you
leave um as this verse in Proverbs
proverbs 24:3 by wisdom a house is built
and through understanding it is
established I've been really thinking
about that more lately and I want to
encourage you guys to make sure you're
living a life built on solid foundation
a lot of times we go through life not
even thinking about that kind of stuff
and it is very important when you're
building your house throughout your life
life's like building a house to make
sure that the structure of the house is
on solid foundation the people you hang
around surrounding yourself with
positive influences doing good things
making good decisions it's also
important to life and I encourage you
guys to seek after that oh by the way
this comment I we have been loving all
of the positive vibes in the comment
section this comment was just fantastic
so thank you for that and yeah see you
guys later
good bye
