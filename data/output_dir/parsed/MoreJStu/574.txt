going you know what's at the theater
though with some sort of game you pick
the marriage game oh yeah that's what it
is the marriage game should be pretty
funny so go check it out
love the marriage game show so anyone
that has been married for less than a
year all right if you want to play just
play Melissa you marry doesn't want to
play we were all right that was a funny
show no I was actually laughing pretty
hard and there's really old couple that
just kept giving the funniest answer so
maybe you just killing it I know the
wife oh man it was a TV show right the
love and marriage to him anyway they
have three couples on there and they
take the ladies into the back and I
asked the guys questions and ladies come
back out and they have to guess what the
guy said and then they do the reverse is
pretty funny I was laughing because they
had the old couple that had been married
59 years and then the youngest couple
been married seven days they asked the
husband and wife from the old couple
what their advice for the young couple
to make their marriage to last and they
both said they get separate TVs in
separate rooms as funny
so get separate TVs we have two but
anyways that's it for today's video
thanks for watching I'm a little
disappointed that we weren't able to get
any vlog footage of swimming with the
dolphins but they said you can't bring
the camera in there because it could
scratch the dolphin so that's sad for
vlog but that's okay because we don't
want to scratch the dolphin
we took mental pictures we will not
upload them
okay tomorrow we're gonna be in Grand
Cayman so that'll be super fun we're
doing some some fun stuff we'll see you
tomorrow bye
