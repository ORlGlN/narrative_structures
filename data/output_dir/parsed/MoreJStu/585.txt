get a cake and it's at Austin's house
like I said so we're gonna just randomly
put this on light it and start singing
happy birthday to Austin but we're
trying to find a cake they don't have
any I do have this that we can hold the
cake in if we find a cake oh yeah seem
like this goes on the edges and that's a
dump it holds it then we can chuck it at
him wow we've moved over to Walmart
because
yes we found these surprises hey another
what's a dollar though yeah or this what
we want to do is pop things in front of
our friends this week our lots of Party
Time Explosion soul that might be
something I want is it eight dollars for
this twelve for the multi pack that's
not bad plus the foot I found on my
pocket ah a Walmart gift card hey yeah
we found some really cool hats for the
new year party yeah
they don't even say anything and the
weird thing is it says right here for
ages 14 years and older yeah well
Chinese to me hey guys
Best New Year's Eve ever wow you guys
impressed I love that
resolutions lose weight have more fun
then you get to fill in two of your own
two more let's go you can only have four
resolutions have some bad news
what they have a a TST in here

have one of my house

no drugs in this less drugs yeah less
drugs guys what is your new year's
resolution super Joe oh why you man to
get you meant to get less drugs what is
up people these days see what she was
wrong with our society guys why it's
funny but it's not acceptable
don't be like them it's not cool just be
opposite be like her text cool guys what
is your new year's resolutions wheeze
after we've asked to other people and
they've given us terrible answers do you

Oh up tonight that's that's a Jessica

I don't know do you have a new year's
resolution oh yeah well keep it up
are we gonna find one good answer and
group they weren't to get into nursing
school I want answers like I want to eat
better I want to work out more I want to
make a difference in the world but no no
throwing up tonight come on we found a
good deal
sixty-seven cents for a slice for Austin
59 cents for this slice and together
they make a good cake yeah see it's
gonna be a little squares that we can
mix and match now when your cake isn't
the same what the poo are these their
table grapes more like GMO grapes we
took the Hulka cheese and acted them
with grapes and now they're very big
well we just got out of Walmart and we
were waiting in line for what what do
you think my time wise yeah I was at 7
minutes 7 yeah
give or take you know and what you can
learn when you go to Walmart is to
develop patience we were standing in
line and they enjoyed a gift card so the
the Walmart lady had to go check in or
the Walmart guy and it was taking a
while because they're really busy and
the lady behind us was just getting
really grumpy she had all of her stuff
on the conveyor belt to go up and
finally she's like yeah and took it all
off threw it back in her cart no these
guys gonna be here forever I just think
how it's funny how some people just
don't have the patience and let these
little things ruin their day like
patience is something I feel like we all
need to develop because if you don't
have patience in life you can go from
happy to very upset over oh wow the
lines taking longer than expected my
days ruined everybody get out the way
whoa they almost back into each other
but guys yeah guys you I recommend you
all work on patience because we need it
in life me and Andrew where's just
standing in line like happy having a
conversation with the guy and we're
still happy who cares if something takes
longer its life get over it
that's just our two cents for the day
yeah like I said in actuality it was
probably like 7 to 10 minutes which is
not that long but when you're just
standing there not doing anything it
seems like it takes forever but it
really does
where is dad checking the whereabouts of
dad really where the whereabouts where
is dad are you my dad we were talking
about you not me hey weak
