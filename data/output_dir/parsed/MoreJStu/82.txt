what's up guys welcome back to more Jase
- and happy for Friday - all you peeps
today's a special for Friday because why
it is Black Friday here in America which
means lots of deals lots of shopping for
people lots of force to make so unless
we're just gonna jump right into this
thing so yeah let's go inside guys Oh
guys thirty one day so Christmas oh yes
Christmas music cow dude this is a crime
because nobody coming to get toilet
paper on Black Friday all right yeah oh
yes oh I think we should do that
oh no maybe we don't celebrate this
holiday Multi multi pack
there's no cons with three but it's the
blue flavor
inside
okay so I am back here I got to do a
little clearing out but like we always
say we're building told reports you got
to get in the toilet paper a section as
soon as you can so you're not hanging
around in the aisles because that gets
way too suspicious so that I'm back here
all you got to do is clear this a little
bit they they already built up the walls
for us so this is a super convenient but
what are you doing okay what we're doing
is we're gonna make this the entrance
over here like we did last Black Friday
seriously making tunnels and forts just
makes it like next-level fun because you
have to crawl in and it makes you have
to be more sneaky so here you come come
come hurry get your feet in it's a nice
tunnel worked out perfectly
so there are people shopping for toilet
paper on Black Friday now you're
tunneling through the toilet paper
dude this is fake the best the toilet
paper has been in a while it's like
completely packed in here
I don't think they're gonna be doing any
restocking there's no who's he not much
room yet wait
there we go okay so this first part of
the floor is pretty much gonna be like a
maze really yeah okay good cuz I'm
getting kind of crammed over here to be
honest
quick adjustment when somebody takes a
wall and make sure they took it perfect
so let's just scoot this one forward and
it will be all good
oh wait there's no need to stock right
now
so he's just talking not daubers
use bounty when making walls because
there are two times more absorbent so
soundproof is that the area this parts
that really in apartment also we got one
layer walls behind us so we're gonna
have to open this up some kids was just
hitting the walls was that again yeah
dude all I see him and it is a young kid
he's just whack
those are collapsible so he can come in
he's telling but he's leaving now I was
scary and this is how you block out the
haters they can't see you but we can see
ya
who's there you stop following us please
this guy keeps walking
used if only we could squeegee our way
up here two-story hideout lookout area
huh I am now in no man's land guys if he
bends over he will see me I promise once
we get this room all set up I think
we're gonna try the trying to put stuff
in people's carts challenge so that's
coming up soon guys right now I'm
building like a ax a chair throne room
Nene oh the toilet paper throne okay not
bad
what requests do you have for the king
please sir we need some water
have you bought in today's quarry of
toilet paper
have you met in the motor no then get
back to work and then bring your
requests yes sire I don't think we can
go this way anymore
it's literally packed full full stop
tears no we're cool yeah that's just
pute walls oh I can't
it's him he's a big yes he was goo bully
what have you done
we're trying to build it the first-ever
total bridge because it's so packed
right man we can't we can't use this but
actually we used our brains if you make
a bridge I have to test it okay there
you go it's bad right here is one layer
also if someone takes it a guess you're
doing it nature's just clearing this
piece because
it's so full that he has to go in the
tunnel or in the over the bridge and
then hands you toilet paper back here so
he can put it on the ground because we
got a lot of space in here oh oh the
bridge
what that was the ride difficult journey
I was worried I was gonna like spill
some of the toilet paper in the office
but
that kind of feel like a gold miner
sometimes when you're digging you will
find a gold area but sometimes it leads
you to a dead end where the dead end
right now so I'm coming back there the
landing this is the worst bridge is our
first try okay this is the exit only
problem is Marva is right here with
boxes they'll have to make it dual exit
one that goes to the other aisle that
way do this what's the progress
hurry
now what
go get a couple supplies maybe sort of
stuff that we can put in other people's
carts like the deals cuz they want me
laughs we're just helping them out
somebody wants paw patrol for sure
that's gonna be you since you're gonna
have a kid yeah calm along we always
want chairs in our forts but usually the
chairs that are way too big look at this
perfect size it's pie-der-man food okay
we got the supplies in the fork go back
in we're gonna try something very
ambitious I'm gonna try and get on a
third level and then do an aerial drop
into someone's cart yeah sponge boat is
quiet soft the goal is to try and land
it in their cart whether or not
yes first let's go on the fourth sit out
okay
get in here boy it's been a while since
we've gotten up to the third storey
I got a score usually thrown some minute
check it out guys this is really cozy I
know you guys make for it so much better
yeah this is like the key element
ingredient cuz this stuff herbs
they're so good if I could about this
interpreters that'd be so fun
she literally just her purse right there
you cuz you can't be spotted she has to
be completely
- OH Karma's on their side again
I know
all right the ground attacks have failed
so when I try the air in aerial drops
even though either had a clear sight
with that I don't know what I was
thinking I got nervous it was just so
perfect and made no sense
we're going up somehow some way
with much effort I have made it to the
third storey guys
which is crazy
so we gotta try and make it bad oh so
these are my baskets like to try and
make it in someone's basket you can see
right great here so someone's coming
is there anybody in the aisle from left
side right maybe you can like cough or
something
hey there
so I can't fully sit up
just let me know when she do she turns
it's black Fridays on no one is coming
in the toilet Iran otherwise I could
easily make it in somewhat basket
yeah buddy all right I think I'm gonna
get down now because literally like I
said no one's up here
that was just a random customer and a
sponge just hit me out of nowhere he's
so confused yeah I wouldn't want to hit
anybody oh yeah I'm just getting it into
the cart but we didn't we didn't
complete the challenge so we'll have to
do it at another time yeah with the fun
we'll get it though if you guys like
this challenge then we'll make sure we
get it successful next time well guys
it's the end of the four video wall for
it's always fun yeah nothing too crazy
this episode but get excited because the
next big thing is 40 minutes in December
