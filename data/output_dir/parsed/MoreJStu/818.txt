barely at my knees like the toilet is
really high it's like
throne-like I do enjoy but yeah like why

America to learn a few tricks I like
this though once you take this off
everything all the lights go off hey

as you can see Andrew didn't sleep much
on the plane so either did you
I think about the plane was know how I
had nobody next to me I was sleeping
fine and then this guy came out of
nowhere and just sat right next to me
he's like just pretend the bigger guy
woke me up and I couldn't go back to bed
a whole night like yeah and plus if any
of you've taken flights it's hard to
sleep on a plane anyway especially an 8
9 hour flight it's like we'll take you
guys along with what we ever doing
tomorrow
yeah I'm sorry for breakfast mm-hmm it's
gonna be good
thanks for watching today's vlog go and
