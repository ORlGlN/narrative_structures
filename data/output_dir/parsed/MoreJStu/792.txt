well how did they are sandwiches
I swear I'm running out of names to call
you guys snacks
see I've already used sandwiches what
have I not used plums
good morning plums right now we're
waiting for Andrew we're here because
there is a Jimmy John's that just opened
right up over there and guess what since
they just opened up every sandwich is a
dollar can't have a more juice dude
without a food deal or a free food some
sort of deal and Britney sure - because
how could you pass up a dollar sub are
you excited
oh my gosh and want to know how I
figured this out it was on Facebook I
think for some reason I saw the Facebook
post saying that there's a grand opening
and come tomorrow from see it's right
here
I won say thanks color Springs tomorrow
I'm selling subs for $1.00 to spread the
love grand opening and whenever there's
free food we can't pass it up I don't
know if you can see from here but it
looks like there's a line giant line and
there's Andrew waiting it's like a theme
park here
back from that delicious lunch and we're
here at Andy's house we just figured out
something
what is that we've seen this before left
I've shown you how many cubes are sugar
in this can of soda ten cubes is
equivalent to this can of soda so if you
drink it since basically just using this
whole handful of sugar cubes now before
we get to the ghost pepper challenge we
have to send some letters back to the
people who sent us fan mail so we're
just getting this sorted out oh yeah
messaging down for you David challenge
is about to commence we have the camera
set up our ingredients here are you
fully prepared for what's about to
happen Andrew in the slightest this is
going to be the worst challenge I think
honestly this challenge might be better
than the jelly bean challenge because
like we said I mean a jury would rather
prefer jelly or doing a hot challenge
rather than the gross nasty jelly beans
do you feel the same yeah yeah yeah the
jelly beans are saying my stomach hurt
like all day yeah it is
who wants to feel sick this is just
spicy it just hurts it doesn't make me
want to throw up so just finish the
challenge ate one of these bad guys
