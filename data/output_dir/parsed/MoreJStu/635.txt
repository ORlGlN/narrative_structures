good morning fam check outside just
before we begin the vlog check outside
here blue skies it's 66 degrees out me
and Brittany are hanging it is a
beautiful day I was just making us so
happy but currently we are out here
about to go to the blue wild blue car
wash because the Jeep needs a little
wash haven't cleaned in a while although
it's gonna snow soon I need to get this
guy a clean
please lift it up here we go folks
are you ready for the ride look at all
that so that's doing a good job right
there
have you ever been in a car wash when
the windows have been down No
we want to try yeah
your side not the tentacles of doom
reminds me of Monsters Inc alot yeah I
don't know why but monsters or spaghetti
I guess all right well done well let's
see how good it did
Wow very shiny
I also like this carwash too because
they give you free vacuums so that's
convenient
well we just clean the car went to the
Whole Foods and got a beverage put them
and a snack yeah Justin's oh we're
splitting so it's not bad
oh and this is the best chill not down
there okay this stuff is so good it's
made here in Colorado just in the last
root beer float milk it tastes so good
and the coolest thing about it is if you
return the glass bottle that it's in
they give you a dollar 50 back so that
comes out to being like only a dollar
such a good deal I got Vietnamese coffee
and it's like brewed right in Whole
Foods and it's kind of expensive by all
and get it once in a while and it's so
good here at Coinstar because me and
Brittany have been racking up but come
enough coins I do laundry and then I put
them in here whatever I found some in
your pocket this is all your money and
we're going to go see the new movie the
new double-oh-seven movie tonight
so we're gonna see if this will help pay
for it oh this would definitely work
cause I have this whole pod how much uh
you have to guess how much is in all
this so once he was closer together yeah
uh uh fifty it makes it alright it's
it's gonna be about one
y'know maybe a lot of queers
alright well let's do this start in
English I was really close
