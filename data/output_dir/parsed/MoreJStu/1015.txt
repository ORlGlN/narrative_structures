cool like a little game here writing out
a script for his skin but we each take
turns writing different lines so I went
first and I wrote three sentences and

gonna write three sentences of the
script

he's gonna write three sentences to the
script etc etc etc so we finished the
script and then whatever we write we're
gonna have to perform and whenever it is

sentences that we switch off writing all
