found this abandoned mini golf place and
we're gonna go explore it I've never
even heard of that me either so I don't
know what we're doing waiting here no
how'd you guys know we love exploring a
big we love exploring abandoned places
and so once we randomly came across this
didn't find it online and it's not even
posted online we knew we had to go
explore it so we're not bringing that
though why because now let's go it's a
little windy here we are the crazy thing
is there is no no trespassing signs here
and the fence is gone so yeah
abandoned Golf Course dude you have you
been here before yeah my dad Mike you
played mini golf here like years ago I
didn't even know you have golf clubs
right yeah we can come back here and
play a puppet game oh yeah
cuz like they still have like the grass
here where water used to be abandoned
mini golf course but the coolest thing
is over here they have like the I don't
know what this is
cave tunnels this looks super scary I
don't know what's in there but let's go
check it out oh man dude it's like a
mini fort in here yeah looks like people
have been chilling in here though of
course there's socks random necessities
but this is a good hideout though
honestly this one what is up there I
seriously love abandoned places this is
like so cool howdy y'all
dude there's like a door here
so why I told you someone was up there
yeah this is so good
this is Oh someone's have been having
some drinks
dude this is way too cool and I mean I
can see it way better in my camera
nothing to like I'm just confused
is this like a two layer story the first
time you looked up and saw something
that was that way these things always
tell you like when they're operational
don't climb on the features but
someone's here
why not well in a supporting help
wow I'm up here nice yeah
got to keep looking maybe there's some
more secret hatches somewhere yes this
isn't where we came in
whatever this is where we come in but
how do you get up here good look dude
there's clothes you guys can see that
pick it up I found the way it'd be here
we need bright lights activated so
always this way you wanting this way
come up here you climb up this
there it is we out probably not going to
climb up there but can you see me I see
something like a mattress here do dig
down here like it out how there's trash
anywhere but I could see cars don't let
them see you I'm wearing literally the
brightest colors in the world today so
everyone can see me you should probably
move pink and blue but literally check
this out guys I've never been on the top
like this this is so sick
there used to be the sign this is like a
meeting interesting I don't know but I
don't want to fall through here guys
I'm going back down I can get up this
way yeah you can't it's better not

random and creepy but if this used to be
