called ivy wild school basically we've
been here before they just turned this
elementary school into a brewery and a
bar so it's like one of the coolest
places one of our favorite coffee shops
in town so this is like the brewery I
don't know what was over here when
schools built but we got the restaurant
right here they have events all the time
they have movie nights yoga nights
here's where the old gym used to be and
this is where they have movies showings
and such at the little bakery right here
and then the coffee shop hang the vlog

snowboarding adventure my whole right
side I crashed we didn't get it on film
but I crashed really bad and now I can
barely hold this arm up to film I'm
holding it up so it's ok though at least
I didn't break anything
Daisy what are you doing are you eating
your rope you don't want to do that you
can't get that it's not edible well guys
now over at Andres place and if you
remember the Christmas Day vlog we
uploaded like two days ago we got a
present and we didn't get a chance to
try out those snowing but today I think
is the day we can do this it's yours
charged up it is charged but I need
shoes
oh yeah me too da da da da what board
like I said that other video was like
how it has a handle on it that's really
creative and convenient I've always
wanted to ride these so this is gonna be
fun so here is a normal longboard this
is Andrews longboard the only difference
is the wheels have this machine sort of
thing on the back right here which helps
it go fast somehow it goes 18 up to 18
miles an hour which is really fast power
button power button I think it's working
finally
yes get on hurry Oh get your balance
first with the break initiated break
initiated you should be good at this
since we snowboard and skateboard and
stuff yes breaks gasps ah there's a
weird ride I don't want to go too fast
though initial journey it's hard to turn
as well now that I'm pointed uphill I
can go fast so let's try I'm at full
throttle on beginner mode
where's the board I'm trying to change
into fast mode it just ran away and I
was like hitting the brakes and that's
not good
now it's in their yard over there speed
mode you figured it out
ready activate yeah
are you going fast yes is gonna need a
little practice I almost crashed going
downhill too which is a notic see when
you slightly let off the gas it like
kind of breaks and you get all like
wobbly saying I'm trying to go uphill
but it's barely moving
whoa whoa you got an accident
I'm just trying to chop up this dadgum
ice let's go in the grog good about Gary
hold on you why do I need to pick you up
ha what the hell complain you need to
get to Mary's house and the car isn't
working yes you have to get us in your
car because it's not working I guess you
don't need to pick up Isaac
no the mechanic came that's awesome come
again he just called you right nobody
could pick us up let's hear this unfold
why check this out ready
Wow this is just a single motor one they
have one that's like a dual motor whoa
even faster a little stilted and tittle
photography Wow goodbye Oh goodbye boy

don't know what he said but I think use
explaining something about the mechanic
so what those are complicated they
through moving on to another Christmas
present if you guys saw that um Mary got
a trampoline for Christmas and I was
busy one day and she was so desperate to
set it up and she set it up all by
herself the whole thing would you just

jumps if you want oh
though this is perfect for friends yeah
Wow how high can you get almost too hot

freeze darn it why can't to be summer it
would be cool if they went from
Christmas like cold and snowy to
immediately summer do be during summer

trampoline up with those balls

million balls yeah probably
