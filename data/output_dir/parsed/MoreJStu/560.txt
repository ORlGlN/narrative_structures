good morning everyone
how're you doing I'm doing good I'm
wearing the same clothes yesterday you
guys wanted to get breakfast very bad
this morning
so I didn't have time to change but I'm
here with the whole squad bootleggers
coffee companies this place good
good morning everybody how are we doing
are you guys better with the jetlag
we're getting there
yeah I'd only take second take
but breakfast just came what is all this
we kind of just ordered what she got
now taking a quick Buber back back home
yes all done with breakfast showered up
and ready for the day we change clothes
oh whoa there's bees we're doing some
little photo shoot I haven't posted any
instagrams yet here saying that we're in
South Africa so oh no we're just getting
some pics for Instagram if I can't
handle like a like how can I handle like
any other bugs out here you do you mean
to say I don't know you can't even
handle an ant yes I could there's a
really pretty tree I don't know what
this is but it's cool that's like a
gated thing
very nice so I guess one of the
unfortunate things about South Africa is
you have to be a lot more careful
everywhere you go like you have to be
aware and conscientious of like what's
around you because they're like the
crime rate here is very high even though
we are in like a area that the crime
isn't really a bad thing
isn't that big they're still like you
have to be careful with like cameras
like this and the vlog camera because if
people see that well people see these
expensive cameras they're more inclined
and if they're desperate that they'll
want to take it so alright so it looks
like going on another girl adventure
I'm just mix coming with us but they're
driving a different car
Louie is staying back to edits and blogs
because since they've been traveling so
much it's kind of been
I've been falling behind yes I think
we're gonna go shopping and get some
lunch should be a pretty chill day
any time I just love shopping
sort of this cool little uh what is the
yeah
only from Little Shop
milkshake factory those are so cool
so we're just trying to figure out what
we want
this is awesome apparently this is
all-natural dried fruit a nuts and stuff
so we decided to go with some Mexican
and the prices here are so cheap guys
we're each getting a burrito and tell
him how much it is three dollars per
burrito
yeah I love how everything here is just
so small like it's like organic yeah
this is how it should be
I'm GMO you got some smoothies what are
these
this one is got lots of ginger and this
one's got lots of chili chili smoothie
good for you because you're his throat
hurts so my time what is this Nick it's
a word economy
what does it taste like you don't wind
up
never thought I'd be eating a worm but
we're in a setup
doesn't really taste like a work
she's trying to do yeah just like a sort
of they have a picture frame that shows
the flat table mountain back there but
it's just hilarious bro oh there's a
baby one you guys want to come
high-five that guy's all awkward his
flies all over his face baby great how

okay moist we are back in the room now
it's a little past midnight over here
I'm actually not too tired but I'm sure
once I fall into bed I'll be really
tired you tired Brett yes
Brittney's tired guys but yeah everyone
else is getting ready for bed they're
packing their suitcases it's because
tomorrow we're actually flying to a
different part of South Africa to do
this in a sane activity that most of the
people in this group haven't done ever I
think we're doing like a three-day thing
with it and I think you guys are really
gonna like it you all just have to see I
like I like leaving it as like a
surprise it makes you more fun how do
you guys afford this I know it's through
work but what's the process like like
all your housing and food is paid for
just wondering from Anna I guess
something like this it's like an
investment to travel anywhere is an
investment really of your time yeah you
take time off work but while we're young
we want to do as much traveling as we
can not only like it's an investment
because we make videos out of this but
like we want these memories and since
we're here at a friend's house that's
free and so I guess it is really
beneficial to have friends who live in
different states or in different
countries because you can go and stay
with them and get the whole experience
through them since they live there we're
gonna go to bed now we're getting up
early because our flights are early so
yeah thanks for watching today make sure
you leave a thumbs up if you guys are
enjoying these vlogs
there's a lot more coming so stay tuned
and we'll see you guys tomorrow
goodbye good grief
I'm gonna go get a cheeky Instagram poet
