great morning everybody welcome back to
vlogs you probably clicked on this video
because you've been wanting to see
another toilet paper fort oh yeah we
haven't done one in a while but you guys
have been leaving just insane amounts of
comments on every blog all these they
don't stop you guys don't want us to
stop with the toilet paper for us so
we're giving you what you have asked for
we're gonna try and do some new stuff
hopefully so stay tuned and the toilet
paper forts have been getting really
popular so we don't know if we'll get in
trouble doing this toilet paper forts
are harmless so I guess we'll see we
just want to have fun and build some
forts here we go
triple decker as well looks like
somebody's already been working it kind
of looks like it but don't know we're
gonna definitely I want to try and get
up there and build a seat zone so as as
you guys know always start on the
outside you got to build up the walls
then go inside and get sign yes so let's
get to work comrade
but he's building up the wall for us
thanks man
so right here is very open it's kind of
going to cause some problems if we don't
fix it and right here we have oh cool
I'm going in you have to make sure it's
clear looks clear this this area's good
yeah
so in the first apartment here I've come
across a construction error the
construction workers built a wall here
for some reason we don't like that so
we're gonna have to move this wall out
so we can expand the square space in
this first apartment just move it over
and look there's a whole new lands in
here another thing you want to keep in
mind I'm building a fort is they already
know to keep the walls secure but also
the top because some tall man can walk
by and just see down in there so going
that high how's it going along I'm
making a spot we might be able to get
upstairs
where
thinks people make pork they do
oh all right do that Oh
great you want oh the you watch the
forts yeah dude come in if you want the
entrance is over there okay so cool
build up all this area okay I try Andrew
found a discovery what did you find
I've been working on layer 2 here but
here's the cool part
I shall you should be secret ah all
right
I broke the wall that's okay guys look
let's you get up to level 2 you can get
up to level 3 without getting down
there's a hole this is like the best
buy's so we have to definitely build up
this first and the top - yeah we found
an entrance which is this I can easily
push out and then you can close it when
need be so andrew is going to make his
way through there to the top level to
reinforce these walls so we can hang out
in the penthouse come come
get in there
yes no one came and over
and you closed it and boom we're back in
business I'm just waiting while Andrew
reinforces the second layer then we
could get to the helipad of the
penthouse Oh Craig this would be hard to
build at their level dude why this is
gonna be really suspicious he's like
things moving away we can make it happen
I know so while andrew is building more
I'm gonna go get some supplies for the
house you need some chairs you got it
you want to make your fort comfy so we
got to get some beanbags maybe a rug or
something these will do I start Ayers
I've got a black rug as well
how's it looking whoa
here's the third-level hatch i built up
this wall a little bit need supplies
now
get up here hey people are right outside
they're scary
that's a news oh geez why I you're on
the third level dude I made it guys
I have to build it up I'm in no-man's
land up here we have some intruders in
here
she didn't see me well this thing moves
so it's kind of scary but I did build up
the walls up here just that area needs
walls now
you see the ceiling yeah I can see the
whole store from here this is epic guys
we finally got it to work I knew we
could do this I just believed in us but
now you need to get up here somehow as
well yeah Wow
we need to build up this side cuz it's
lame
I interested he's going to come up
don't know we kind of feel like spies
when we're doing this go go go go cow
now to the roof we can easily climb into
the rafters
help me the dumbest idea it's done but
it's possible it's awesome they ask my
man
I got out safely undetected now
and dressed to get a pretty good wall
Andrew look through the top
sir what are you doing and remember guys
always put back what you bring to the
fort there we go we just put put these
back where we got them and we're all
good come on out boss
I
the
oh my back it's pretty good for it
I must admit look at the walls up there
holy cow we coat totally could have
stayed up there for 24 hours but guys we
would be probably really bored we'd have
to like bring our computers and have any
movies and stuff so today really wasn't
the best day plus we have plants injures
leaving tomorrow yeah but we did
complete it you guys have been asking
for the fort so give this video a like
if you're glad we're bringing back
toilet paper for us we're going to try
and do it more often and next month
August it's going to be a big month for
12 paper for it I'm not going to tell
