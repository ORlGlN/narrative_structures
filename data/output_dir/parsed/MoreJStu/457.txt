good and more kneeling Newberry eggs
whoa I haven't said Easter eggs we've
said a lot of foods good morning hams oh
you want to tell ya I'm all we're doing
so today we kind of wanted to do
something like a little exploring
because we haven't went exploring in a
while so there's this place here in
Colorado called graffiti Falls or
cascade Falls or Rainbow Falls Wow it's
got a lot of names I guess and one thing
we can say about it is it has tons of
graffiti that like local artists common
spray paint and there's a bridge in
water or fall so way I've never been
here before I actually took my senior
pictures here and I literally can't
remember where it is here's where we are
right now we're parked on the side of
the road we might think that that trail
right there leads up to it but I mean
that car parked and those people got out
one of that row okay well I don't know
where that goes let's go exploring whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa see some sort of
graffiti over there so we're gonna take
a look how do we get over there
I don't know we have to get there's like
a cool cave please we can't get over
there there's nowhere to cross there's
got to be a way though your shoes untied
there they are
yeah I sees folks up here if they know
where it is
yeah
we're taking a shortcut to get over to
the other side but it's danger zone we
want to fall it's not that big but jump
but if you mess up you go down the
waterfall
whoa
ah the trail continues on this side of
the river
it's got to be up here guys whoa
there's worker up there Wow Phil okay
we all can hang it odd the poo the
worker said we can't be here
see that's the bridge they're building
come on garnet but look you can see all
the graffiti down in there oh it's dark
but Jia
I'm just kidding guys empty are some
people left this stuff here yeah there's
that can another can you make graffiti
on stuff unless it says otherwise
no I got a try
you can grab you can grab this tree
because it's it's in the ground
Oh guys he may fall
you did it whoa I feel like we're in
Survivor we're trying to find it hidden
immunity idol yeah but we teamed up
because we're rental liens but now we've
reached a dead end don't know we have to
go like this over and we made it to the
cave we were just right over there
earlier now
you can go inside
the cool cave guys and some friends they
just appeared
there's bears in here whoa we get to
explore yay here's a challenge this is a
slide and to slide into the pond

cave the hey I'm about like a chair with
all this trash I see some underwear
yes unhappy dude was so much deeper back
here really how oh my goodness
I'm gonna scared dude look at what can
you see down there yeah I thought you
can see better on camera to be honest it
still looks you're gonna further back no
way just don't want to hit my head you
know what I'm saying Oh way back there -
how much deeper does it go I don't know
if I want to explore in there isn't but
just area here you take the camera and
point then yeah but see it goes there's
two separate tunnels I forget to crawl
do you crawl in those ones yeah yeah
that might be a no really
what unless you are no okay let's get
out of here body better the caves guna

okay
imagine like we didn't have light so we
try it yeah let's do a cave blindness oh
you can't see me but I can see the exit
we have to try and escape I use an only
natural light okay let's go
yeah oh I see the exit oh yes we're
saved so that cave is pretty sweet we're
trying to find if there's any more caves
because
we got our cave fix on
you know I want to keep finding more
caves this is so fun ah but it's like
I'm trying to google to see if there are
any in this area anymore yeah I feel
like it'd be pretty hard just to stumble
across a cave like that one but we will
see what we find
I guess this is the path
whoa andrew is finding some extra things
to help get across this jump because
it's actually kind of slippery right
there almost fell in will it work
I couldn't make the leap my shoes are
wet so it was really slippery and now
the rock slippery but I found this
little fortress guys just pulled up the
car there's Andrew he made his way
downstream seeing if he could make his
way across yes yeah you did it you can

Springs now that means doing butt

there like an underground - we walk
tomorrow but you'll unblock him for us
right so the last I don't know if you
heard all that was last tours at 3:30
it's four o'clock danger is just saying
this reminds me of Europe which I am
getting that vibe dude yeah Queen's
parlor like this castle and just the
whole area just feels very European how
is the parking lot down there we hiked
up these stairs there's a little garden
here but now the top of the castle
archers to your battle stations would
love to be back in time to those Castle
days and archers and ah yeah
when are we going I mean I even know how
they built this stuff back then that
house was built in 1885 man wow that's a
pretty old it looks like good shape as
well there's a real-life squirrel eating
their treehouse get off of there you can
also see part of the incline right here
that's the false peak I think right
there that's basically a staircase up
the bone
this is how to go downstairs and style
whoa hold it since we didn't get to go
inside the castle really at all in this
vlog leave a comment if you want us to
explore the castle we'll do that and
maybe we can convince him to let us do
the underground lair she said there was
well she said they'd blocked off the
underground but they got to open it up
for somebody
it's the COG that goes to the top of
Pikes Peak good go is so fun this is the
parking lot for the incline but this
trail right here bar trail if you go on
that trail takes you all the way to the
top of Pikes Peak really yeah it's a I
don't know I think it's like 16 miles or
20-some miles or something like that
