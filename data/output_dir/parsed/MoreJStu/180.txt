finally the crew is back together whoa
that was a long time you were gone who's
gone three weeks she's gone but yeah
it's good to be back yeah hope you guys
are excited make sure you leave a like
if you're glad we're back together and
the blogs are gonna be going but look I
didn't show you guys I didn't film it
but I had this happen so now you know if
you guys have watched the previous vlogs
you'll you'll know what's going on so go
watch them if not but I had to get a
cast
so anyways Andrea what are we doing
today we have a fun idea for you guys
that involves buying a lawnmower so we
found one on Craigslist and we're about
to pick it up so let's go see if it
works
we'll make a deal would you check out
this land lawn mower into easing tip-top
shape it looks brand new oh the guys he
said it's basically brand new so it's
pretty epic so we got two lawn mower oh
we gotta go to King Soopers to get some
supplies for this vid as well so here we
are
Nolan's other stuff that could explode
oh yeah what
well Big Pharma you did okay give me the
cart because I can't pay any cash
Wow this guy you that's a good one
okay here he goes bananas will work
perfect with this experiment you guys
don't even really know what the
experiment is but maybe you can get all
right cantaloupe can't hold okay yes
it is very hot out that's probably a
good idea it was really refreshing word
what else what else
maybe watermelon baby watermelon should
we throw another one more cup with a
little one if you hold the lawnmower up
and we roll it towards this 100 and Noah
no how many do you want three okay mango
mangos yeah three okay
man look like run to the tropics I know
it's a tropical adventure coming up soon
all right back in the house we need to
get some safety supplies because kids
lawn mowers are not toys yeah but we're
doing an experiment goggles gloves okay
where oh and you're going to do
something dang it all right so we got
the goggles you have the conductor it's
an important role yeah so I think I have
gloves in my car potentially but that
perfect okay
off position yes we're here at the park
we're going to bring the lawnmower down
to the grass and veggies whoo we have
made it over to some shades because it
is hot in the Sun now let's begin
which melon do you want to do first or
item we got a lot of items guys I wish
to start with a banana yeah this could
be a finale this is lawn mower versus
these things there we go
so these guys yeah let's prep bananas
huh it's like Mario coming to life all
righty
all right start your engines captain are
you ready glad I bought that brought
this
there you go all right all right let's
get in position guys go
what where you took the top of it
Salamis probably best for bananas to be
thrown at the blade obviously we don't
recommend you guys doing this but we're
showing you what happens and how
powerful this lawnmower blade is
you gotta go faster than that
oops
ah yes
you see that guys know what happened the
banana got clobbered
wait
how was that um one of them really blew
up we could probably make a banana
pudding
yes one thing we need to do is prep the
soda cans so yeah perfect soccer little
boy up
oh all right start er up
Oh
No
man there was an explosion of
proportions
I thought I can was flying at me look I
got a little wet too yeah he's gotta be
careful of cans huh all right there's
still some intact so get it nice and
explosion like right now yep grenade out
Thomas grenade Oh
and that was a good one now it's time
for the rolling watermelon hill
challenge are you ready yeah there's
fresh juice all over here whoa that
looks so cool from up here promise yeah
we've got mangoes these are pretty ripe
they're squishy ready starter up and
Kiwis
motor starts poking the back boy what
happened that last mango did it in for
it it got scared of it maybe maybe it
was just tilted on the side is what did
it gasp seeing I dunno we're doing
refreeze of people out there who can
matter I don't know
don't worry picking up the trash though
okay yeah don't ever worry about that
giving it another start maybe I think we
flooded the engine because it was
sightless that's why it's not the mower
shot but it's not completely shot right
when you do this it spins the blade so
maybe we can chop some stuff up still do
it so let's put the melon under there
right there a little forward I mean now
the forward fold
yeah let's see if it whoa
hey the melon big stick
all it needed was a few minutes and it's
good fella
the grand finale that's the way to cut
the melon
aha
idiot that was a big hit there's like
battle the lawnmowers he completely
wrecked the cantaloupe I was I saying oh
my gosh I'm s that's what they're
probably all thinking because of Amole
screw pizza take a close-up look at me
okay there's just a lot of fruit guts in
there but yeah well looks pretty normal
I think you just cut it off with a big
chunk try to cook yeah great job with
the mower thanks guys
yeah oh I want to see an example of you
sprinting full-speed while you're
pretending the mole
you
you
alright that's done Oh
if you want to know your whole yard in
under ten seconds as a new tracklist
yeah just have your parents ask you the
ball this is Bryn per give you a raise
funny story when I was younger I my dad
would taught me how to mow the lawn and
I would do it so fast then you get mad
because if you go too fast it doesn't
actually like cut the grass so if I
could you just have to redo it
Oh funny alright well I think let's go
oh okay that works though
I'm glad okay so we didn't want to do
the whole thing with lawn mowers
so look what we found whoa what do you
call this device the weed smacker let's
go get the fruit tress up oh don't tell
Mom nothing
hey drew yeah nothing but nothing
nothing so we got a watermelon what else
a mango mango yeah maybe some bananas
yep advanced we could carry like a nice
smoothie yep the bath money let's go
blend it up Oh mango bananas and two
watermelons we're gonna see how powerful
this weed whacker can destroy the roots
this could be your new hobby
yeah if someone was really good at this
very accurate they can make art out of
this weed whack art the epics
whoa it made it look at that oh you're
inside fire alright guys well isn't that
epic make sure you like and subscribe we
should open a restaurant where all the
fruit we chopped up is with a weed
whacker oh that would be kind of cool
what you guys come you need to see the
chef in the background like chopping up
the bananas and he's like oh you want a
watermelon
okay we're back home and guys we're just
having fun so hopefully a lot of you
