pretty slope by mount uh big mines like
by hardhat well that was fun did you
have fun that was awesome yeah seriously
felt like Indiana Jones while we're on
that little like ride if you didn't see
here what this was like
it could be golden these little stones
you have to heat him up to 1800 degrees
no he said I don't I don't know but he
said it become if you heat him up and
start the gold will start to bubble out
but I don't think we get anything yeah
that's cool so there's some rocks yeah I
just thought it was cool that he said
well this mine closed in 1960 and he
said they've only mined out twenty
percent of the gold so so eighty percent
left in there it's gonna be bought out
yeah some guys gonna buy it and start
mining it that would be a good idea
don't be the worst job ever
