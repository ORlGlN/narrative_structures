there's 100 right there what
from 60 faster negative from 0 to 60
didn't have much
I wish there's another like fast
we can see in just two Cougars of it
grief like that went by so fast I wish
we could go to Denver about an hour
drive
if you ever get the opportunity to drive
one of these cars it is absolutely
insanity
andr I wish you were in there with me I
didn't do anything crazy but it was just
just pulling up right next to people and
then just hit the cats
leaving them in the dust it's so much
fun I did forget this shift because I
was going really fast although on-ramp
yeah first gear yeah guys if you ever
get the opportunity if you're in
Colorado they they you can come drive
this car come here it is insanely fun so
fast Oh
other guys are saying it's like this car
is like just the year it is like the
model and everything it's just so rare
we are all done with that now get some
food here at chick-fil-a but I'm still I
like my armpits were kind of sweaty
you're nervous I was because I never
done that before like you're saying it's
intimidating at first
seriously you're driving that expensive
of a car I think as soon as I got back I
felt comfortable was like oh yeah I'm
just like you know in a Lambo would have
yeah yeah I did so fun you know fun
that's like next-level fun like Zune fun
yeah I did
I was nervous though so I'm just telling
you that I was nervous you probably not
at all
yeah I did it before but it was very
nervous but the bars not over yet by the
way
we want you guys to leave a comment let
us know what car do you want to see us
test drive next oh yeah
leave a comments because we may be able
to do that yeah so just pick any car any
car but what else we have to show them
this have you guys seen this yet by the
way
focus tenecia just announced this
recently and guess what 0 to 60 in 1.9
seconds 250 top speed I was talking to
her
copilot and he was saying this car can
go zero to a hundred faster than that
Lambo can go zero to 60 just look how
beautiful it is and it's cheaper than
the Lambo guys oh but how much like two
hundred thousand yeah dude you do know
how much the Lambo cost yeah okay
maybe when it comes out we can try it at
least maybe I'll buy it but why not
that's it I'm reserving right now you
can't stop me know why I'm doing it
no you're not does it come out though
2019 I think they should come what they
check here law watch I'm gonna reserve
now thank you
do you reserved it already that's all
you have to do just a click of a button
the Tesla semi boys which one should we
get the roaster the semi for sure the
semi is actually cheaper though so
that's just a fast as we can tell many
things but they cost fifty thousand
dollars just to reserve it that's insane
that sucks
I actually I don't want to reserve it
but anyways guys thanks for watching
today leave a like we will drive more
car soon if you like the attenti vlogs
but don't forget to leave those comments
of what cars you will see and well who
are besties your backyard mom peace guys
