this is cybersecurity Officer John M
Arroway date of September 17 2015 let me
begin by explaining the background of
this whole mess six months ago a hacker
named blue blue darling 85 threatened to
obtain and spread vital information
regarding national security
once the hacking began we quickly
realized that the only way to avoid
being hacked boys to go old school so he
saved all the information on the highly
developed microchip after that
everything was fine until rumors spread
that we had a mole in the organization
and that the microchip would be stolen
even though he spent four months
investigating everyone and by that I
mean everyone in the organization we
couldn't find them all yesterday
blue blue darling 85 sent us a cipher
code we deciphered it and it said
tomorrow your microchip will be laying
on my desk haha lol while everyone else
was panicking I came up with an idea
perhaps not the smartest one but
something that had to be done
jeez it jerk it happened you spilled my
breakfast all over me how could I have
done that I'm sitting way over here dude
yeah that's what they all say
who could that be I have no idea but
just act casual no our parents aren't
home Joseph Hayes what do I say yes he's
got a present right yes that's me

my pop turn here sir just come with me

don't want to come in

bit rude to you know what you get that's
the thing I don't really know because I
didn't order anything
the happy 70s mixtape has a terrible
century wait look hmm what is this you a
lid know this idiot don't you just say
that perhaps not the smartest one but
something then had to be done during our
investigation you two stood out nurse
how should I put this impossibly in
threat to our country I would have taken
the ship myself but my position is cyber
security officer makes me an obvious
holder and a simple target so we're
counting on you to you're responsible
for holding on to the microchip this is
of course on level 9 confidentiality
only myself you two and the president
knows about this we can't risk getting
the wrong person involved I've installed
a microchip in the cassette tape you're
playing right now once you've listened
to this message push play again the song
will start playing and the message will
be deleted keep the cassette tape on you
at all times
wherever you go good luck boys John out
do as boss says push stop
didn't you say push play I don't know
I'm not sure
play it again we'll see what he says
no where's the message you deleted it
wait he did say something about deleting
the message so maybe we were supposed to
do that and maybe we're supposed to
destroy the cassette player
oh no the message specifically said to
keep this on a song if it sucks like
calm down this isn't something we're
supposed to mess around enough we just
focus on keeping the safe all right fine
