hey everyone welcome back to vlogs we
have a fun blog plan for you today and
that's probably why you clicked on this
video you know what's about to happen
me and Andrew back I'm gonna build
another toilet paper fort we're gonna
live in here it could be a new home yeah
we're so we're just trying to figure out
where to start on this one and look guys
this one's triple deck so we can
potentially build it atop a top house so
much down be up there you can make a
triple bucket it might be hard but I
think we can get it done folks
it's just the only problem with this one
might be that there's too much toilet
paper so there's not enough room to like
clear but we're gonna try and make it
work
so what's the plan right now Andrew I
don't know but this is the door always
start with a door so you can get in and
start building from the inside out if if
we stay out here for too long people can
see us like why can't that big toilet
baby I've been in this aisle for 30
minutes so if you get in there you start
building outside walls from the inside
it's secret that way and up here already
has a good layer so we're gonna try and
bail two layers hey er do you want to go
in the toilet paper for denial is clear
there's no one in the fact and Jimbo
just left but there's a lady right there
so you got to be really sneaky
right now this one this one's better
yep wall complete let's get this wall
very powerful wall I'm in the 4c here's
the second layer we have built up but
seal these holes in the wall we have to
fix this or people will see us injure
there's holes in the wall here
yeah right there and right there this is
always the hardest part about making a
delicate before is getting past this
first stage because everyone who walks
by there's giant holes they could easily
see me so it's about fixing that and
trusting
crap break our fortress
exactly why you need two layers guys two
layers for the wall
crap we need to make repairs now hey hey
how did you know we were in here
go Sonia you gave it away
no we're building the toilet paper for I
want your videos what no way
it's time to try out the first-ever
double-decker toilet paper fort go oh
I'm ready
very close the door no no no no knew it
to turn this first now but something up
here first ever on the double-decker I
told you guys who'd do this
hey Andrew hey Donny can you see me yeah
there is a crack right here I have to
adjust those
only problem is here's the door someone
drives by they might see me up here and
tell and then next level is third which
is near impossible I can see you up
there this is epic hey oh hey
I wish I could climb through this hole
that would be really hard but the be fun
darn it
now that we got all that sorted out we
need some decorations for the house as
usual what do we need first you need
rugs because all its just bare metal
which is not very comfortable it hurts
on knees to sit on and stuff look at
that maybe some plants decorations
chairs you got to be comfortable yeah
how does it look the big jokes maybe
that's that one smaller
we got some decorations we got a double
rugs got an American flag of course the
minions rug we had to this is a nice
sponsored by me means and then I had to
see here as well which is fabulous uh
what we're thinking is we might go buy
some snacks or a drink and just chill in
here for a bit
we could literally sleep over here -
come on - - but we need to make a better
fort this is gonna fall apart like if we
slept over we can bring our laptop watch
movies hang so this Walmart's connected
with a subway you know it's about to
happen
got our subs drinks remember guys you
have to be honest and there's no doing
bad things like stealing food if you're
gonna build a toilet paper for it and
you want snacks you must buy the snacks
first okay
yes no one's here quick we did it go oh
no don't get any food on anything oh
yeah
yeah this is yours
how's your sandwich oh this is gonna be
so awkward or so on pull the toilet
paper see that's the sandwiches
oh we just finished our food had lots of
business talks really I'm just kidding
we couldn't really talk because people
hear us I do want to get up a
third-level though yeah
oh crap my phone I did it did it
nothing to see here folks
and that's how it's done oh yeah yeah I
know if we heat it up there we can
easily make like a little bunker no
Justin is gonna try the third floor so
huh
quick hide I made it to the third floor
I can see everything I can't really
build afford up here though
hurry
all right
I got it
oh is that the one hyah shelters yeah
that's the one I wanted yeah
so do you want another knowledge one
should be fine
okay thanks forget that because there's
other ones that are high up - that
aren't as hard to get yeah why was this
one way up there though well we're all
done now guys and make sure you put
everything back if you're going to make
a fort because you don't want to leave a
mess for employees we just put the
chairs back and rugs over there and now
it's time to leave I'm actually quite
amazed that no one said anything yeah
this time they didn't get mad at us your
favorite I'm salivating it just a
thought wow you're all these don't do
not doughnut judge me
Phil not judging do not worry be happy'
you should tweak that I bet you'd get a
lot of retweets you do not worry be
happier do not judge ah all in a day's
work guys

art of thinking of ideas for the next
one so and if you guys have any ideas
