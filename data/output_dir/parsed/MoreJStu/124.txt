yeah hi and welcome back to more J sue
with another for Friday oh yeah who's
having a good day today we hope you are
cuz we are as well yep
we're already in the store for it's
gonna be nuts we kind of want to do a
little exploring see what kind of force
we can get into today we don't have a
specific plan first up typewriters out
or I found something that might work
take a look
I'm back in this area this is nice
because we gotta have a table wall here
if we build up down here it's kind of
like a sit sitting the zone
we got an extension cord maybe you can
plug in some electronics for games but
no one would see us down here easily
build this up this is the best part
about foreign states the possibilities
are endless there's so many different
styles and ways we could do this oh we
need that in the fort behind these
blankets and rugs there's a whole zone
back here
you found a passage no one would see you
and there's a box right here for another
layer man we can build a few ports in
here we found a zone it's got cups and
lids and it's pretty cool oh yes yes yes
come in oh yes this is pretty cool I
know just got in here we already have
seats these are blood dolls as well but
there's more room to expand down
oh yeah why I can stick your feet out to
the boxes yes oh there's nothing up
there so I'm actually helping them out
please don't have to get back here cuz I
spilled out everywhere and now we're
just in a more convenient place than the
Shelf we just saw somebody somebody that
I think is always in here cuz they
throwing somebody's playing around in
there but it didn't look like an
employee she has two kids yeah she's
coming back this way it's always the
hardest part is getting out of the fort
without being seen Oh
that's right
we found a new fort I actually didn't
think this was a fact I know look how
many diapers there are
sir
how huge this is
this is insane age again here we have to
build a wall over there because that
people can easily fuse it thinking we
build this up a few employees central to
the left a little bit so if we can build
a wall here yeah good look down here
there's a beautiful jewel of this forest
ah just made a roof so you can come to
I'm here now
there's just so much room already as you
can see it's a big opening you don't
want to get caught guys
she told a person here's the plan we're
gonna try and define an escape route so
we can get out of here you'll find some
other forts we saw one that we have 20
guys yet and they want to get some more
of the roof pieces we can make a huge
tunnel system it's gonna be big
let's go I'm very curious to see how
long this fort is I think this might be
our new record we can make it longer we
can make it all the way over here and go
back here at least 65 feet
how long mattes here's the fort you
might not think it's a fort but it is if
any of you seen Chronicles of Narnia
the tree
I gotta admit this is one of the smaller
forts but probably one of my new
favorites it is so cool I literally feel
like I'm in a closet here's the jackets
I can see out right here
I'm trying to move this box so he and
jury can get in as well can maybe even
get upstairs hopefully gonna fit through
there but you try you're coming there's
somebody looking at jackets right now
okay
maybe in the fort you have this like a
closet it's pretty warm in here because
these jackets are all like fleece
yeah so say this is like a watch out
Tower mainly because it's in the middle
of everything here I wanna show them up
here
it's pretty much enclosed so if we
wanted to get up here we could but right
here is like a bigger opening I could
get up here but as you can see back here
there's a huge hole so somebody wants by
the way what are you doing sir in the
jackets nothing is it comfy right there
it's pretty comfy I like it
I could probably sleep yeah so this is a
pretty comfy fort but it's just not very
big and we can't get upstairs so if we
could literally move these boxes it
would be the best for I don't know if
you could put these upstairs ah can then
please just come do that for us oh we
made it out that was hard to get out of
whoa that was cool I like that for it
could barely see like if we go out we
can't tell if anyone's nearby so I know
oh do it it feels so much better out
here it was hot in there was a pretty
cool rafters fort but it's pretty open
and not much expansion yeah I'm really
leaning towards diapered dungeon oh yeah
I like the diaper dungeon so let's go
get some supplies to make it better
we found some cardboard this is the
perfect dungeon
supply but there's a cyst awkward
carrying this around
we found so many pieces of cardboard to
the fort
alright ran the fourth time to assemble
the dungeon
alright installed next one
oh yes big I love this for making her
away
I've been expanding the dungeon and look
at the progress I've made this was all
right here and I moved it all to this
wall it's not only our triple layered
but now we have another blockade to go
through but that doesn't scare us okay
guys after hours of trekking through the
dungeon I have made it to the inner cave
and Andrew is making his way through
this part you actually have to climb
through this area it's really small so
if you have claustrophobia it's a very
scary part of the game re Andrew I think
you could make it there's also scary
monsters in this club
in the cave house telling there's
monsters everywhere you have to watch
out for the other guys
this cave is a very dangerous there's a
big boss monster breathe
it's can parks also I haven't been in it
yet but the deep deepest darkest cave
behind us see that we haven't explored
that area yet so we don't know what's
there my goodness this fort is huge Wow
I'm ready I'm gonna need my flashlight
with this one guys
yes here I go
you serious I'm coming in there's a
little oxygen in this one luckily I have
my light right yeah
uh-oh you never built a fort that has
been this long and it keeps going I
think I missed cavern Shh is that the
end yes this is the very end of it
Wow my goodness oh there's a
mini-monster it means oh come in this
cavern this is this only safe area
that's the whole cab my light works
again yes no monsters you can find us in
here
uh-oh
we also are out of the way wow this is a
great zone if only it was a two inches
taller yeah I'd be a little more comfy
but with caves you know yeah
with caves
it's very tight spaces dang it I heard
it I don't know if he showed you guys
the main cardboard tunnel system yet but
here it is oh it's time to show you guys
the finished card board section tunnel
system okay so here's what the top looks
like and zoom wow this goes for miles
because if it rains you want to make
sure you have cover yeah and then I like
this because the rain runs off because
it's at an angle so official new record
guys for biggest fort yeah I can't
believe he made a four that goes from
literally there all the way down into
there I'm so excited mission
accomplished
I feel great yeah like you said our
biggest fort new record for us smash the
like button if you enjoyed it and if you
didn't see our last four it'll be at the
end of the video or in the description
check it out because that one is also
pretty epic as well see you guys here
next time okay good bye
