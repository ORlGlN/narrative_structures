vehicle to watch the sunrise and now

this is actually real coffee it's not
like the powdered one like they just
made it oh my goodness it looks fine
even one of you looking here another was
like looking often a good lord
huge lens
oh nice so currently we're at a
anti-poaching showing us like the
location of the Rhinos because they have
like GPS in them so the guys out here
have these little devices as well it's
unfortunate there's a lot of poachers
out here and a lot of people poach like
the Rhinos doesn't want to kill them so
becoming endangered so these guys are
here 24 hours a day making sure that
they are safe
yeah yeah they're picking up the ping of
the Rhino which I don't know how it
works but it's over there somewhere
you're the ping guys what a cool
experience this is you said they do this
every day
Wow
Joe just to protect it right now it's
incredible Wow such a cool shot I'm
looking through the binoculars it's like
perfectly clear it's a beautiful animal
seriously does where I need a dinosaur
look how close we are guys use it right
there
like offroad
so can you give for the viewers at home
just some fun facts about the black
rhino that grana a very territorial
wolves okay a little bit smaller than in
the white runners as well so that makes
him a lot more time into it a little bit
more cases as well their browsers so
they eating mostly leaves and trees and
things like that a good way to pick up
if you when you're looking for black
runners to look in there and they're
done
okay we're on a midden and you'll
actually notice that the black rhino
with cutters his branches at a 45 degree
angle
really so if you see that you know for
sure that you onto onto a black runner
alright well after that amazing rhino
sighting so cool
I just think it's wild that we just saw
an animal that there's only like 2,000
of them left who knows in like a few
hundred years if there'll be any you
