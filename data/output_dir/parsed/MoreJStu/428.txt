well how do you do neighbors what left
the vlog it's being really annoying
because this keeps going on and off this
fire alarm it's give it a minute
it's going to happen it's gonna happen
again holder you see someone's just
playing possum - fire alarm we're on our
way to get some breakfast smoothies and
then after breakfast we're going to go
to Runyon Canyon do some hiking and what
else just exploring the nature outside
so it's really fun and what later we
have kind of two meetings but we're
meeting somebody oh yeah some of you may
know
yesterday it was in the 90s out here and
it was really hot don't know what
today's temperature was supposed to be
but it already feels like it's going to
be a hot one
what is this giant head over here
I don't get it we're here
thank you yes that's good
I got like a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich one kind of wow I got like a
coffee coconut one he sounds need to
stop run away to the hike

Griffith yeah that's it and this is the
entrance together that's okay I mean you

a few minutes guys
Hollywood we see the sign we're almost
at the top but this is a great photo op
and view buildings over there you can
just see everything this is cool there's
the look I've seen this place in movies
yeah probably
this reminds me of Lord of the Rings
I've got white tree right out here in
Gondor thousand years the city hosts oh

I'm just time to head back to the car
hikes are always great when you get to
go downhill the whole way back that's my
favorite type of hike how's a good
little hike we just did it's good to get
outside get some nature flowing in your
veins
whatever that means fresh air in your
blood but if that means yeah the Sun
shooting at you with his rays we're
downtown LA now and he's going to
explain what's happening I'm not sure
where this is but it actually just
opened up here it's called the sky slide
it's a glass slide that's a thousand
feet up in the air so we wanted to be
the first channel to do this since we're
down here
one of these buildings
Wow look at this view though
are you scared yeah I'm hungry too

the slide that's the entrance right

full pizza then mm-hmm which is okay
yay well that's the end of the video
thanks for watching hope you guys
enjoyed it the sky slide was so cool but
we're back in Colorado now and I just
wanted to say that this VidCon trip has
been the best of all the VidCon trips
and none of it would be possible without
you guys so I'm just so thankful and
thank you so much for watching and
supporting our videos now comment of the
day
a who said Geoffrey I don't know but it
wasn't me I don't think Justin and
Andrew remind me a SpongeBob and Patrick
oh sweet those guys are pretty cool how
much do you guys spend on food a day
this comment made me laugh because when
you're on vacation and kind of traveling
it's hard to buy groceries and cook it's
just a lot easier to go out and eat so
we definitely went out and ate more than
we usually do
but it was really cool because we got to
go to a bunch of new restaurants that we
never been before and they were just
superb
and last be who you want to be not who
others want you to be believe in
yourself Thank You Ryan I think that's a
great mindset to have believe in
yourself I believe in you Ryan believes
in you you believe in you all right
we'll see you guys in tomorrow's video
okay goodbye
bringing back the classic so you
I wish
