good morning everyone so we're back to
life again
I'm gonna put on my stuff that I don't
want the dogs put you up my little bin
yeah where's my shoes the top one is
just in case I know how to open it
less of a chance that they could open
the top one all her stuff is in here all
her important special stuff good all
right
then grab your lunch in your water
bottle and Hayley's hanging on the couch
daddy's getting ready for the day and
I'm gonna take aunty to gym and you
snuggle with Hayley could this possibly
be any cuter yes it could be cuter if
you were there okay get in there to make
it cuter Oh
super cute hey I know we couldn't see
it's not looking that but stipulated
that you're right
we don't know where Winnie is somewhere
all right Hayley we'll see you later I
will help you back out the door Annie
we're gonna be late
she is out okay yeah so Hayley's
motivated right now to practice on the
bar it's not Kirk it is it huh is it
let's count the holes 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 1 2
3 4 5 6 so it's even it just must look
crooked it doesn't look crooked to me so
Hayley had so much fun her meet this
weekend that she fives you go to level 3
she finally I was going to say she
finally wants to be on her bar she
hardly ever comes
so she's like acting level three cat
it's a glide swing pull over
front hip circle which I'll have to help
you on shoot through mill circle back
leg cut under shoot way or back hip
circle under shoot back leg cut back hip
circle under shoot I think as the level
3 routine
whoops sir this is blurry oh thank you
all the same thing you're doing I think
on a higher mat battle round off back
handspring you'll learn it well I know
that part is rounded back handspring and
it is a real sock mm-hmm
Haley's got so much motivation right now
to try to make it to level 3 before I
help her let's just see where she is
what her version of a front hip circle
is I feel like I can teach you this
because I did teach Annie
all right okay you know the concept well
you have to get you can't Pike around
the bar in the beginning no friend
difficult does not have a cast at the
end it is aft for the shoot through yes
but the point of a the tip of a Mills or
a friend of circle is to drive your
heels and then Pike at a certain point
she drills let's see if Halley's attempt
by herself was any better than her first
attempt yeah you got to get those toes
up one more I think it's gonna kick take
a couple weeks but she really did do the
drills pretty well we were working on
driving or our heels up this today oh
okay all right
yeah mobile you gotta take we got to
take Winnie to the vet because when he's
paw something's wrong with her paws
she's limping and she's licking it so
we're gonna just go let the vet take a
look at pink yeah it's kind of red
pinkish red one more and then you got to
go get some real clothes on remember our
drill ball better better we saw have a
long way to go but that was better
super proud of you she is Haley that's
cute
but not you hey we near you go in the
car
she's excited right now Wow okay until
they start messing with our cute little
Paul I am meinem Winnie by him hey
Winnie that is the carbon squealing he
wiggled the car you did you did when you
wait I cannot have a pretzel shake
normal day along with every other food
known to man you know oh she's back hey
Lee
one more I think I dropped it in my
throat
it fell in my stomach I know
Oh flew out of her mouth hey Winnie
crush to winning 100 Hertz matter
handshaking : oh that's good she can
still shake her hand
alright the doctor just left the room
the vet and Hayley's gonna give you an
update what did you get from what he was
saying yeah dad um okay bottom line
you're gonna be okay or not yeah she's
good she's not as fat as she was the
last time I probably her weights better
so the diet though I'm cutting back on
treats has worked and the vet just
thinks it was um something that got
irritated like an allergy well there's a
cut on the paw so he thinks maybe they
called upon Koster to lick it and the
licking it costed to get inflamed right
so he's gonna treat it with possums
we're gonna soak up all and a steroid
okay so where's a steroid gonna help
with the inflammation
markula you and you and bum Annie can
soak your paws together yeah hey wanna
soak your paws yeah so still looking I
don't know I don't know how to explain
it but that was good oh I'm gonna be so

they had like steak and seafood you'd be
like oh yeah and definitely get my
mistake and I would definitely not get
the seafood or something like that um I
would it do you know some places always
have like it um noodles and stuff so
that means they have mac and cheese so I
would probably get mac and cheese but I
would not get a steak I am sorry but
because if it was dinner I would not
feel like it it was it but if it was
lunch I would feel like it I don't know
why oh no I will probably say that I was
you would get chicken nuggets at every
or say chicken nuggets and steak okay
but I would definitely not get what ah
