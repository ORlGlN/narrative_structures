we are candle makers we are gingerbread
makers decorator's we are dog lovers
yeah that was much easier we just got a
backup pair crypt we're gonna try
Shawn's grips she ordered her a new pair
he had these berries and she's gonna
like professionally personalize these to
Anna's hands for her backup hair mmm
that's your next business it can't move
on from candle making
well gingerbread decorating would
surprise how many pairs of grips do you
think you've gone through this couple
hundred a hundred she couple she went to
the Olympics Amy have you forgotten how
much fish a couple hon you've probably
gone through what thoroughly zero hmm
