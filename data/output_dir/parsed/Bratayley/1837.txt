no baby bird not baby bird that's true
if you are baby bird I would have chewed
the food up for you first and then there
daddy's got some food for you got this
table that's right here for a month at
least yes kind of sad no time like the
present though right thumbs up

said that really do a room tour but we
can't yet because he's weird Harvey we
don't have it set up Hayley's definitely
her I already clean line no but we don't
have everything up on the walls thank
you very much clean your room just to
make your room clean you just do it for
money
mm-hmm so do you daddy never cleans his
room it's not true he cleans it while
you're gone
and it wasn't you you clean the room
using the force or a small investor that
is not very good table manners do not
ever get your manners from Caleb you're
gonna put your face in your plate
no don't know if your father either
don't ever do what daddy does either
let's pretend like we have table manners
ready set go
show me Haley what are your best table
and let me see your table manners that's
not what she's doing she's not wiping
her spoon on her she's saluting because
apparently soldiers have your eyebrow
project at school and it's about where
your where is your family from so you
have to bring something to share or you
can pass it around or you can bring
accessories or glasses for everybody or
some food so right now I'm reading for
so daddies are Louisiana so I'm doing
mine on yeah I don't got this I know
it's Mardi Gras awesome it's something
before Mario I'm doing it on Mardi Gras
Mardi Gras means Fat Tuesday and so what
I'd like you to figure out is some time
in this project as why they called it
Fat Tuesday
you got a read research why they called
it that Tuesday
whoo all right
I think maybe we're gonna try to get a
king's cake so you got to figure out
some time in your research what a king's
cake is okay okay sorry okay I need some
suggestions on what I should do for my
science project since I have one now
there are a few things that we can't
have and so I forgot what they were no I
think you're head of your paper so the
question of the day is gonna be what
should I do for my science fair project
things with my science project can't
conclude is I'll call including wine
bacteria or mold cigarette cigarette
smoke or other tobacco products fire
house will bleach dry ice liquid
nitrogen and other caustic poisonous
household products medicine
over-the-counter and prescription
science lab chemicals better vet done
three Tipperary you know sorry Toshi
that's what I can't have I need
suggestions thank you good night okay so
it sounds like everybody in this house
has a project do you have a project see
ya why is Haley so weird as my project
is well like a science fair project but
Oh Caleb Joseph L he's gonna be looking
for that later
science fair projects where he has to
have a profit and he has to have find
out what the problem is and then the
hypothesis
what's the hypothesis Caleb I should
know this educated guess
isn't that a hypothesis yeah did you are
you just saying yeah or do you know that
I'm right nine actually well nobody yeah
you're right I'm right now that you hear
it you're wrong
so that's the hypothesis Haley I changed
someone in my class oh you don't want to
do that too so what are you doing I'm
doing George and for all i have written
down is georgia what's the last of the
thirteen colonies 1732 named after King
George to the Great Britain Georgia was
the fourth state to ratify the United
States ratified you know it ratify means
no no so white you're right I told you
to write stuff that you thought was
important if you think it's important uh
what state of the United States I just
didn't know what the word
ratifying the Constitution that's when
the states accepted it it's when they
signed it and said okay we accept the
United States Constitution declared
independence got it the eight must
populace 24
mi destructing you was Madison extensive
and the eighth the most popular of the
50 states it doesn't mean like popular
like wow like it's like the favorite
state in the United States that means

know anything right now so you kill a
both got project that we need to work on
so don't forget to comment down below
could you morning up the question of the
day is what should Caleb do for his
science project
