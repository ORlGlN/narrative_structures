grilled cheese this place is like famous
for their hamburgers Five Guys Burgers

alright let me see really
okay manners right
load it up we're looking mayonnaise here
might say I like the minutes a guy in
our shop
it's about the quality that was for you
at Oakes
and this is swimming
five guys or Fuddruckers I can't hear
you
fun
be careful thank you think they'll say
be careful
I used to think it was a bad word when I
was there so you won't say it
oh yeah he just said
movie I fell asleep
we're gonna rate it a needler sorry
food all right let's go to somebody else
a nine and a half
really was that good sends the best it
can be
all right Haley the one one means it's a
bad movie and ten means it's a great
movie
there's a 10 but you can give it like a
9 or an 8
you like okay it's in you heard it here
ladies and it's a pen I didn't watch it
either
you can't believe you with you guys
George Lopez
we like Virgil Earp oh yeah you know who
George Lopez thank his voice well was he
bitten but you know that would be a TV
that was a TV show called you guys oh I
just
got it so that's why you gave it a use a
bunch of noise
any like them average all the ratings
then we're Taylor gives up tonight so
you should definitely check it out
should you take all their scores you add
them together and divide by three so you
add a ten plus your seven and a half
what 10 plus 9 in Houston was 19
okay and then add Caleb seven-and-a-half
oh all right then
27 divided by 3 right
for some reason I think you're right
that little thing right there Haley did
you write in all her journals there's so
many to choose from
oh I like that one you want to look at
Barnes & Noble and we can come back if
you don't we can go and look at what
Barnes & Noble has and then you can make
a decision look at these pencils hey
buddy
that's cool all right well if we don't
get anything at justice I mean that
Barnes and ever will come back so we
know balanitis
and I decided the reason why I wanted
cuz I like the detail in the globe says
when you come to a fork in the road take
a look that really good quotes under the
most important trophy made heat in life
is meeting people halfway if you
actually look like your passport so you
aren't well enough to travel
here's my favorite do not go where the
path may lead go instead where there is
no path and leave a trail so it means
you should be the first one to do it
right and leave a trail for others to
follow you
that's a good quote should live by that
yes got home from shopping and I got a
bunch of new stuff for my room so right
now I'm gonna put all my stuff on my bed
and stuff number two reorganize it maybe
we'll show you guys in the morning or
some time because we're taking up all my
stuff and all of us or bye see you

there is no question the day today sorry
it's really late and I'm tired
