gonna tell Mary that Annie's sick a win
I don't know I think this is what I
think that we can see how she feels in
the morning but she didn't go to
practice today so I don't know how that
works
I'll be nervous because I mean missing
the day huh
day before me and a level-8 meet what
was the trick at least it wasn't the
Bahamas yeah that's a good thing we got
a lot of time to get you you should feel
good because that's when it's is the
worst with an all medicine for 12 hours
no but you get to take another round of
your antibiotic Oh what last night I
thought it was like five but I went to
your room
it is 11 like not in the morning p.m.
yes but I thought I was sleeping for
like so long and then I woke up at 12 1
2 3 on the hour

missing out on things yeah okay that's a
good one
