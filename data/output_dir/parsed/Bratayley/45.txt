today we the things we do morning
rituals in the hotel room after sleeping
for like 11 hours all of us it was so
good I think we all need a bit but now
getting dressed it's very quiet around
here because they don't say too much in
the mornings your throat hurts oh no I
don't like hearing that sometimes
getting up and drinking and brushing
your teeth can help a fellow bad yeah I
think probably I don't know if they got
sick or overheated
right hope you feel better if that was
you so we've got to pack these bags up
and we have about 35 minutes to get out
of this hotel room before checkout we're
heading to the airport
to go back to Los Angeles I've got a
photo shoot tomorrow for a cover she
does Haley you you could I don't but you
do have a photo shoot coming up
next week in a couple days so everybody
gets a photo shoot that's exciting
they love photo shoots it's been a while
since we've done one Annie you're not
ready
I could tickle her ready all right so
we'll see you guys in a little bit I
gotta finish getting all this all these
suitcases closed today I'm Batali now
yeah with my with my 12 hands
that's what shirt okay guys we are
double stacking backpacks because she
likes both backpacks and we just got to
the airport in Atlanta I'm limited
edition yeah today she came out and said
this is how much he wants to get cut off
which was way more yeah all right well
when when we get a chance we'll find
somebody to cut it
actually I said I would do it - she
won't let me because it's growing out
excuse me I'll be the one to decide if
you get did you roll your eyes at me was
it okay wasn't rolling your eyes but it
was she wants to get more colour put in
I think we should let it grow out a
little bit and trim it and see then if
we want to get more colour put it okay
enough of that silly conversation we get
to go through security so that's always
fun and he tried to smuggle her heart
shape though wasn't it what she call
heart-shaped box of chocolate apparently
that flag it flagged the x-ray machine
so they could have seen it was it shoved
in here and it would have been like the
person who was monitoring it couldn't
tell what it was but then the next
lady's like do you have a heart-shaped
box of chocolates how did you even know
so we got flagged we had to get the
candy out and show it but luckily the
candy gets to come I'm not psychic she
can see it though she's like I can
clearly see that's a heart but I'm sure
it flag things all right we made it
through security somewhat smoothly and
in her box of chocolates what I hate
that I don't should entail hate this
Airport but it is huge and it can take
you a little while to get through it we
need to go to sea
take a little train ride to see
what we're going which way make sure
