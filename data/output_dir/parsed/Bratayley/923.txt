we're slightly obsessed with these yeah
we should have gotten one for everybody
oh the good Todd oh no I think that
count too much tension I think in here
yeah yeah oh that's a good toss again no
don't you dare yeah No
that would have been bad yeah you got a
little a little bit more slack in your
line yeah because if that bounced again
I mean if that hit again it would have
been nicely done Oh bummer

come I guess you're stuck here the other
girl girls will go from sleepover and
you got to stay with me Winnie you're
being bad you're so cute is that I love

you already caught it once oh my gosh it
took me like 50 tries if I can oh not a
good throw got those at the Cirque de
Soleil the little girls we could throw
them up in the air flip around and then
catch them
I can barely I can't even catch I can't
catch it nine times out of ten it falls
that's so cool that's right
and they do it like synchronized really
yeah
that is so cool they make it look easy
too
we figured it out the better spin you
have on it the less wobbling it does and
the easier it is to catch
