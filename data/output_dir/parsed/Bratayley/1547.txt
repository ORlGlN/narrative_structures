growing my hair out trying to get it
like this but not like that
I don't forgot which one it was
I thought it was that one oh yeah that
was the one you said earlier but we're
not sure that's gonna work I am cuz your
hair is wavy this one Annie oh yeah who
for One Direction injection up and
everything I see solos or someone that
looks exactly like you here yeah burger
did it that's her yeah
One Direction thing : popular things I
think so yes
yes it Sam that's nothing also that's
also person that's from one direction
whoo no breakfast hen we all know that
guy so we're gonna see how long we can
get it until it gets on my mom's nerves
into the N once it gets on her nerves ah
we're like usual it's probably gonna get
on her nerves before we can get like
that cuz we've dried out and it's done
down here we've tried it before you know

yeah I just can't ever get past the
where it looks like your hair is needs a
haircut
