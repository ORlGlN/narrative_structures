oh my gosh and on Mondays we shave our
beards well those that have them it's
Monday morning and we're going on an
adventure today to get mold put in any
ears or made of Annie's ears because
hello friends of I will because she is
having a hard time hearing herself in
loud venues and she has a hard time
hearing her track and her purse her own
self so you get this weird I don't know
how it works but you put these things at
the out monitors and all these words
that I don't understand you put them in
your ear and you can hear you can hear
the music and she can also hear your
voice right that you're singing into the
microphone so it can keep her a little
bit more on beat and so we're gonna get
those molds put in and then she's gonna
start rehearsing with them because it
changes a little bit and we're gonna do
it before and after of this scratch so
we are doing no school today because we
might go to the zoo and that's kind of
school right there and we're it's like
science the zoo are you okay
all those little see she didn't even
know she's learning when she's learning
that's the best type of learning all
those things that you read about the
animals I don't want to go anymore I
feel like I can learn at the zoo you
learn about what they eat that's the
best kind of exercise to when you don't

do
