day before Annie falls asleep right here
she's gotta go wash her face mm-hmm all
right question of day would you rather
go scuba diving or skydiving
what is scuba dive when you get the mask
and you underwater go scuba diving
whoa okay I feel like skydiving isn't
natural I feel like it's more dangerous
and stupid I didn't I don't know I feel
like it's something like because
naturally you can hold your breath
underwater for a long period dude I
thought scuba diving finally yeah but
it's not natural the tank good God
honest one of us to explore the Seas I'm
gonna go with scuba diving I'm going to
playing jump out of it because maybe I
understand her I think both would be
scary but you think no I'd rather what I
would rather I think scuba would be
safer no I think skydiving to the Meccan
say to everyone that I was good spotting
I'm sticking with scuba diver and not
going skydiving don't forget to comment
down below cuz Paige wants to know
Haley goes on set tomorrow always
