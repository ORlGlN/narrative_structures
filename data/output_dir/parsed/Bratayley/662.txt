that I know it makes me fall asleep what
a day what a day I am beat what the
rainbow or are you guys at the rainbow
or that I love the sounds of the rain
but oh my gosh yes well we're in an
anteroom hanging some stuff on her walls
finally right before the designer comes
in and and takes it all down but um we
had some free time so that's what we're
doing look at all her Polaroid she took
over the time we were just in LA so
these are gonna come up like in that
area or over here she just got this so
it's kind of fun you guys and we're
hanging this next where we're going to
attempt to it's a shine upside down but
says shine and we're going to see if it
go or the bed but it may be chalk to
talk over the bed in which case it's
going to go in the center of this wall I
think who knows or over the couch
centered I don't know I'm not good at
hanging things which is why we've hired
somebody to do it and we're just not
being patient what's wrong what's she
doing
yeah she'll think it's a toy
guys we still have four boxes in Annie's
room that we haven't unpacked of trophy
and I don't even know what else what
your great-grandmother gave you those
daddy's grandmother know that's where
the spoon collection started and she was
a little tiny little girl what does it
say
Missy oh I see you live round wait last
four where you were born
wait that's not yours that's Haley's
Hayley was born the other one that was
from your great-grandma it's like floppy
oh me too that means it's more to hang I
was hoping we could have put one nail on
one side of one on the other
that's so cool-looking though I want it
I want it to go up here but I don't know
this yeah they could go on this side we
can stretch it yeah hey guys this is so
fun oh I don't know it's gonna fit it
could go does that look silly
yes it might what my we discovered that
a has stopped out of a sub my gosh young
she wanted to place the put her Bible
and I'm like just put it in she goes
well I mean why do you need that many
stuffed horses they can't breathe in
there any hmm
come along look oh my gosh guys look you
guys remember when those boxes were
right there
oh man didn't last I was just about to
show everybody how wonderful it looked
and it fell have to find a different way
yeah it looks really so much better now
that it's kind of just prepared and
played out for the designer we got to do
Haley's next week mm-hmm did that one
cheese little how did you um think she
had this warrior in Texas so flowers

was done gymnastics that yeah you were
getting ready for choreography Oh

blinking what do you do so she's just
checking everything out you guys this
room is so much bigger without four
boxes and all the stuff she had crammed
over here it looks so much better I mean
there's still a lot to do but that's
amazing all we came up to do was hang up
that and that and we ended up hanging up
so much other now it's bedtime because
we said you were getting in bed early
today it looks great I love it makes me
want to go do Hailey's room but that's
not happening tonight
