time for what carry good morning so I
got up about the earliest have gotten up
and I've got a like I just saw they
don't have any blankets
Arnim or sweatshirt not in whatever that
is it's like a jean jacket but I'm
really cold and I have to school
then I'm going to go to the gym camera
zoomed in the keys so I'm starts quit
I'm too lazy I'm so tired I don't think
she's quite awake yet
I think she's pretending to do school
oh no she's got school up there that's
good breakfast in school we're going to
get some of that done then if we can
wake her up and now she's going to work
out I got our grips of planned well
thank goodness last minute I'm like
let's just grab your grips just use mace
it came in handy cuz we did end up
coming out here the guide said that an
earlier vlog we knew there's a chance we
were coming out here so she's going to
get into the gym today and I bet it's
going to be rough but that's okay
Annie wake up wake up it's not that
early early but not well then you should
have come home earlier last night and
held responsible your computer's about
to fall it wasn't that late but you're
going to pay for it today
so eat a good breakfast and do some
school
there she is kind of get out of here in
about an hour and a half a little over
an hour and a half so hopefully she can
get some good schooling I think I've
walked into this room like this and she
looks creepy sitting in here can't see
your face she's making funny faces but
there we go now I can see your face are
you digging in
is it as good as daddy's why does it
look old
Oh lor did you wait too long to eat it
ankle cooked itself I mean it was a
congeal a little bit I fried up an egg
for her I'm not the best egg cooker it
looked good oh good it just wasn't runny
like Daddy dove it okay I'll check with
him on what I did wrong to get it the
way you like it
all right how school going are you glad
to be done with math and like don't even
have to worry about that now one subject
of that time is that how are you doing
it or are you just doing all of them you
know you don't have a plan yeah think
you'll be done in two weeks now two
weeks is the projected like on time
where I don't have to call the school
but we can do an extension if we want I
think it's pretty good that you've
gotten this far I wonder how long I
wonder how long how far off we are
what's your best guess yes and I got of
how much longer you think you have come
on uni go Beach so two weeks behind
well horrible here's the scoop she's
doing two things at one time she's doing
language
yeah to homework and her vocal coach
jackets on the arm he finally warmed up
in here as cold this morning for vocal
she's doing language and her vocal coach
wanted her to learn a new song it's a
song she'd never heard of
she loves Kelsea Ballerini but she has
actually never heard this song that
she's it's called X oh she wanted
something like fast and that beat but
it's got this one really really fast
I'd call it country rap I'm sure they
some of you have heard it but it's not
like okay go listen to it so she's
listening to that in the background and
every once in a while she'll stop and
try to get this really fast part bye see
you later that looks so weird
yeah oh
you got a week done almost right pretty
good in about an hour
what want you know 50 100 yay so that's
a whole week complete okay you have 30
minutes start another week go go go no
no no but you've only done school for an
hour and a half you know we're going to
do school for more than an hour and a
half a day sorry Charlie those legs
still look funny
it kind of reminds me of how pipe relay
is from them I don't know why we're
running a few minutes late right now so
we like to be blocking and logging at
the same time so yeah maybe all academic
right now I got so tired man I know
Jimmy and I agree like we're I think
we're really tired watching all this go
and I know like to get like rain in a
while she's always in my thought I'm
like oh no oh but she's back water
flipping then if we're water flipping
we're good bottle flipping that water
flow thing yeah oh you do on the trip
the environment black
oh the good way
I thought you're gonna do as I know
close with the real dignity I bottle at
this all we got they came over for two
seconds
what's the bottle t-that is that it can
you what does that mean Andy's on the
beam for the first time and I'm just
calculating since like playlist when the
playlist beginning of me I think it was
like the fifth of May okay oh my gosh
I've took them too long right there's
something called a learn in books are
you going to do your little tradition of
how you put your grips on her coach
makes them lay down and like a what is
it hollow body and and the legs and arms
yeah when they put their grips on that
how about other way uh-huh
yeah it's smart it's a good point those
are great there's a risk I just look to
the calendar it's been like two and a
half weeks since she's been at the gym
that's why I could tell haha because we
thought we thought we'd try like food
slaps and yes
she's gonna quit
that's like foreign language to me
