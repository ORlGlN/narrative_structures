well Haley's heating some cooking going
on there's some school going on there's
some fighting going on for it I have no
clue Rush's that was region of what the
US colonies I'm pretty sure it's not the
middle colonies so the subject that
Annie's most behind on is history so
that's what she's working on today and
this little girl is just working on some
breakfast
and then she's gonna start school after
I take a bath she wants to take a bath

by face face
we do love some check for
no it's a fillet is that spell different
cuz they spell it with an A at the end
and fillet is actually spelled BT you
took a quiz that had five questions it
wasn't like a great it was like a
practice quiz before my actual quit okay
then the question was which which region
included pine forest marshmallow
Marshall marshes Martians yeah anyways
so then I thought it was the middle
colonies so then I got it wrong so I was
like huh and then on my actual quiz it's
asking the same question and then I was
like I'll just search it up just in case
and as simple and it says I think okay
it says the answer to this question is
the middle colonies so I was right
but that marked it wrong I marked it
wrong so what are you gonna do have no
clue maybe this person is sweet
maybe that person just thinks it's the
middle column Li like you did a school
story Oh another school story I you were
doing math and there it was not the math
quiz okay
it was one of the lessons and I got one
of the answers wrong and it takes you to
the thing where it tells you the answer
and explains all of them yeah so then I
was like oh I understand that now okay
go back in the night um I put in the
answer and it says sorry you answered
that question correct I mean answer that
sorry you and I incur in Korea
I looked at the answer but I like put
uh-oh instead of a zero or something or
I didn't put the column in there
no I did it it was right so I didn't
know what the table oh man can you guys
