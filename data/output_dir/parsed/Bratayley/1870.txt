night trip and what I was saying it's a
late night trip to target and Caleb and
Caleb got a question for you mommy is

styling industry care
yeah he also ate two pancakes for
breakfast and you're going we're gonna
try to pick out a team game
hey why do we need a new TV oh yeah why
are you sitting and blocking our fire
really really guys really are you
singing and doing what great that's what
I do when I clean it you do a thing hey
it's not Christmas anymore turn that
music off scuse me
did you so oh can I Jim yeah you know
how to do it Kyle Anderson uh-huh
Kayla wants to make my room message yeah
and I love
and he's not sewing do I do away can't
do it because Haley came in here and
broke almost all of my stuff like always
and so daddy survived something else
there wasn't tape measure in here -
because she broke her sewing machine and
she almost broke a Furby what a day
I tell you about your Furby yup the
doodles you like for death it's a little
cluttered you have stuff all over it
okay so we ran into a huge problem we
bought it we bought the right TV because
on the box it said that it was the right
length to fit in our little area with
our TV's gonna go but when we measured
it it was a half an inch too big so now
we're gonna have to take it back do or
life all over again and why we're so bad
at this year right now is because on the
box it said that it would fit
this TV we knew wouldn't fit right here
it's our old TV and then this TV right
here was our technically new TV but it
wouldn't fit up there and we definitely
knew that one one fit up there so
