wondering the girls are interested in
acting now so we've got a little script
fell apart oh my god Johnny zero got you
guys I think are on different scripts
right oh my goodness we can't I wish
they could give you information but we
would get really in a lot of trouble
with the writers and producers of the
show if we released any of this script
you believe you're all back Monday right
that doesn't mean she's going to get a
part it's just really kind of like we
said earlier it started off we just
wanted to like make them like those
things we've been like best day ever
it makes them a little bit more
comfortable and then they you know we
started this and they kind of like I was
kind of fun though they have been off a
few tapes to some directors like last
week and this one's going to get sent
off if she's ready and her elbow hurt
Hailey's that watch from TV she doesn't
have a know the script wasn't really
appropriate for what we were comfortable
with so we're going to pass on that one
