hey we're back we're home
our target stuff look at this I got my
socks
we found some shorts for Annie that
we're super cute just like basic needs
that we needed like chopstick and these
brushes and some face white rare and yes
we did we did buy one of these this was
something we didn't need but we wanted
to try is it amazing she already opened
it it was mine and she wanted to see it
so she was nice enough to put it back in
the package for me I want to try it how
does it feel is it great mm-hmm that a
good purchase
oh it's wax free or something that's why
I wanted to try it like so it's not like
heavy maybe that's a good thing you say
you don't feel it it's lightweight BAM
okay some things like this make me
really excited we're laying in the bed
we're watching Mean Girls and he's been
dying to watch it and we're gonna sit in
bed and well first we're gonna clean
this out of the bed yeah cuz this is not
comfortable
you guys it's Annie not doing a great
job with her face I feel it looks so
much clearer well I meant like just your
complexion looks good not that it didn't
look good before but like your little
bumps like what the doctor said it was
like completely normal
forget what you call it cut with a K but
I feel like the moisture moisturization
why did that not stop anything that's
moisturizer I know that's what I mean
like I'm sorry what moisturizing put the
moist there's moisture ation a word I
just make that up why if your skin looks
really moist yeah I don't think that
would a word but really way I think your
face needed to be and find a good
moisturizer all right okay I'll stop
rambling can I make you really happy
right now you didn't have a pair of your
own yeah hope they fit
