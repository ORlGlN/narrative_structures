Caleb's over there playing catch you
don't think we can see him we're out to
eat after a cold baseball day and Caleb
was pouting because I'm the reason he
likes to come to Olive Garden is because
tomatoes in the salad he was pouting
because now Andy has decided that she
likes Tomatoes and he has to share
guarantees because we have her food like
it yeah yeah that's right she likes
Tomatoes just because one of her friends
does not because they taste good right
before so people's taste buds change
when I was little I didn't like tomatoes

changed you're not normal

what were you doing at baseball for that
game would marry every time I would look
over you and just shake my head because
you're a being oh they turned the music
