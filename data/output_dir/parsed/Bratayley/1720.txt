up and so you're gonna go into the
washroom if you knew a friend of yours
had stolen something what would you do
about it what about if they didn't give
it back when I was a boy he would try to
hit the side because Haley took that
from me I was probably I knew that
someone stole something for me I would
try to find them as fast as I could say
do you have whatever they stole and and
if they said yes I would ask um did you
stir and they said no I would I would
keep saying are you sure are you sure
don't lie to me
and I would ask me sleeve I would ask me
sleep together for them to give it back
so don't forget to comment down below so
we were in another question today I'm
really bad at explaining if you knew a
friend of yours has stolen something
what would you do about it
bye bye now bye bye
so it's my turn to do the question of
the day I love it because no one does
her my server but I did completely we
started so it's like a basic server I'm
not gonna say any names you're gonna
call somebody out better get it right
boom minecraft man 53 you should all
destroy him yeah so mean what do you do
put lava everywhere yeah that's a bummer
but anyways go ahead Caleb I'm just
answer the question the day and don't be
grouchy yes I do if someone stole I
would let's say they stole a lollipop
from a baby
punched finger nerve faces okay what
would you do if you were at the mall and
one of your friends stole some baseball
cards and you saw them put it in their
pocket what would you do
he would face so you'd let them cut
something you want oh yeah they didn't
give it to me then I would tell me to
put it back oh I would say you can share
them with me and they said no I clip
them back okay you know that would be
you stealing - right you'd be an
accomplice to a crime you know if you
would go tell the like your mom or their
mom or the police or somebody who work
what's wrong thought you whitelisted I
want list it let everybody join just
don't
optin lesson learned yeah it's turned up
just white list off
don't work you can still keep your white
ass deep breath rebuild a server for
them guys please although we may be
asked me for people to destroy the
server again what I can't people know
without being are only up people can
destroy it they don't have enough stuff
you only have limited stuff without
being oh you learn something new every
day about minecraft while you're up
there want to dust it not with your hand
oh man oh just make it more of a mess is
it really dusty your site Senate what if
I got you a paper towel clean up clean
and not a lot of cleaning to do what
happens when you climb on furniture you
discover messes and then you have to be
put to work how is this still dusty so
this is a first round and then this is a
second it's probably clean enough
cleaner than when we started
