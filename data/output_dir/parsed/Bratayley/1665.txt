we're about to go run in the Lego store
and we're really excited so we're just
hanging out my card and nonny and pop on
Joanna and Nick are already going up to
there to see if there are people already

you can't breakfast
you tell her thank you for the bag you
tell her thank you yeah there you go
laughs good
no problem we got everything no problem
thank you for watching thank you
we had to split up because Downtown
Disney does not like the crowd we
created so we're split necklace manager
thank you
you
how did you run out of room on that one
she has this and thank goodness we
started early video she was like really
little Texas yes I read them back when
she says she wanted to ride him
backwards for a while yeah
all your videos you did all of us thank
you
yes I've seen them all too well I get
tired of hearing us all talk sometimes
we don't tell people where we live but
we don't live close by that's your hint
we had to fly on a plane to get here
okay we are here for about a week
dang it we're not gonna play that either
so here's the scoop we just got done
commuted meet-and-greet and they got
that very short because it's accurate
cuz the security or the police um said
there are too many people you have to go
find the different places not the yeah
just like that
and so we're really sorry that we didn't
get to meet you all at least that we
were actually there to go they're gonna
open stuff some of the people brought us
in so we're gonna go ahead and open yeah
I waited waiting
yes got me there
I saw a gun here and everything he said
walking away to try to following us and
also like you people oh yeah not was
really nice really fun after the meeting
greed I came out and you draw my mom now
I know how Justin Beiber felt
hi I'm security guard for security guy
I'm in the security guard dunkey bears
oh yeah okay here's another question how
many people do you think were there for
at least at least 300 yeah at least and
now that's a good reason for downtown
Jersey to not want us to be there at
least one somebody gave you a monster
high dolls wow you didn't get anything
with that strap around your wrist
hey Caleb I think this might be for you
that's his I think what the heck

boomin conditioner Mickey Mouse oh yeah
