Transylvania in the car and I just found
out that caleb is getting braces in a
few weeks and that's really cool because

about it is that he can't chew gum so I
would if I were him I would chew gum
until until he gets some like every day
I would chew gum because I know I would
viscum and then popcorn I don't think
I'd miss pop popcorn because usually
when we watch like for instance
one time we watched the first time we
watched Hotel Transylvania and The
Nightmare Before Christmas we got
popcorn prison eating it so I don't
think I would miss popcorn but it's
really weird
I've been hoodie really weird saying

look weird on the outside until he opens
his mouth so I'm okay I think he's gonna
get the colors really likes purple howl
peplum black does like purple he'll get
yellow and black
you can't red white and blue and that
would be like baseball and
you know the u.s. colors I'm gonna do
