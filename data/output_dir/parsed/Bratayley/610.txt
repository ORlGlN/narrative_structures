cleaning up like the position the ledger
has been for the hand walks it's
cleaning up like the transitions in and
out of things okay spacing has to be a
huge issue you guys have to be aware of
where we are art and I know you're just
learning it but I want you to keep
continuing to go through the videos too
just like for example this is left foot
in front on this and when you turn you
keep your feet exactly where they are so
this is the position you should be in
you know and then like when you come
forward skip 2 3 4 hand turn
pump pump you step out with your left
technically that's what I was in here
step out with left and these are just
things that we would have missed if you
weren't here do you mean like every
wouldn't have liked you and have known
how do you Oreo we're eating Oreos and
having a long discussion about what the
best way to eat an Oreo is you get the
whole bag first you get the whole bag
step 1 step 2 do you just take a bite do
you twist it open peel this like this
Center out your spinner or Dunkin yes
chill out nope I'm not a Dipper I'm not
a Dipper
twister that's what he'll peel the white
out and just eat the white and get
somebody else to eat the chocolate I
take it out give it to someone else make
chocolate BAM ah this is too much by
itself no we like the dipping that's a
good technique oh my gosh like these
