thankful for what we have right
appreciate appreciate the life you have
what you pick up off the floor oh it's

there though it's not gonna get
fingerprinted about to step on a stubble
you guys if you wear my yes did you do
applause because I have a plus so the
screen is bigger than the plus but the
phone itself is smaller and lighter
you guys this is so exciting
I don't even know how to turn it on who
goes press and how to decide but I've
been waiting a long time for this this
is like the one miles that I've been
waiting for I've had them all except
some of the Seas right until the eleven
