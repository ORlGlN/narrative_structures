their bodies make that milk
not made of a milk their bodies make the
milk like mommies can make milk when the
babies are little

going to get my hair's up because I very
excited about it because um I couldn't
get my haircut before and I kept waiting
and waiting until after my last four
five meet because in gymnastics um you
have to get get your hair back tie your
hair back very tightly so it doesn't
fall and we didn't want that to do any
bad things uh but mama said we'll wait
until after my level-five me and I don't
have needs for a couple months or maybe
even longer than that and so we're gonna
go to my haircut I'm so excited I'm
gonna get like a side bang and we're
gonna look at pictures and then I'm also
gonna get layers
