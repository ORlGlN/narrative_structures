well it was bit but hey was in the back
and cleaned up and mom is cleaning it up
and hey Caleb is um on the couch
sleeping so it's I'd be the handle all
the question of the day stuff
so the question of the day is if you if
you put G on a test and you knew you
wouldn't get caught would you cheat like
if if you on a test would you if you
knew you weren't gonna get caught would
you cheat on it yes why or why not
my answer is no I wouldn't cheat on a
test because um when you get the test
and you get it right or something I have
to attempt to get it right then you
don't I don't really feel good about
myself because I didn't really answer
that one or if you get it wrong and the
right answer with your answer and then
you looked at it and then it was wrong
because you copied well that's bad so I
just wouldn't do it anyway so um I don't
think the other um Haley and Caleb can
answer it so don't forget to comment
down below because we went into the
question of the day is if you are to
cheat on a test wit and you knew that no
one was gonna look or no one knew would
you cheat on it well I will see you
tomorrow and Ice Age a bang
