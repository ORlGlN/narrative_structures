sleeping on my lap for about an hour and
as soon as I turn the camera I'll show
you that it kind of woke her up oh good
mornin yeah you want to get up you know
it is very late and the game was the
longest game of my life
it kept going and going and going at
once strong and the puppy which is now
up with Caleb with Caleb she slept in
pretty much the whole time
goorsha and now she's sleeping you can
clap and we are now also starving so we
are going to get to Chipotle everyone's
babe sure me too
by electrical like something with you oh
we're on our way
what one of the babes one it's so time
to the question of the day and food I'm
gonna talk to you guys and say that did
its baseball game we lost by one this
close game and that's love um so it was
a close close game we were pretty much
losing by five in that's a last inning
we came back it was five to six and yeah
just got out technically we might have
one or might have tied it but the clock
expired because I'm just getting too
late to play and they don't have any
lights it the question today is that we
decided would be what are three wishes
what if you got three wishes what would
they be and my one would be of course to
have a good family second no or nothing
no I mean when I'm a grown-up I have
raised a good family
I'm not saying I don't have a good damn
I'm saying that I need to raise a good
family
um two would be um probably to have
enough money to buy my kids something or
anything you may need food stuff like
that
and then my third wish we're of course
be to make youtube videos with my
children hopefully we can go 2nd
generation of youtuber Tilly
you guys tomorrow baked potato
baby
thanks for watching
