really got my bag make it where y'all
headed New York yeah to the awkward
store how do I give item
the front from the front is open
I would never mind tan and it's pretty
enough so we're playing in Tesla I mean
what else do you do when you're walking
from playlist of dinner and you have all
of our friends who love gadgets as much
as we do
it's gonna be a long time before I ever
it's disabled before this ever happens
because I'm not ready for any of you
guys I Drive somebody buy a Tesla so we
can have these there's one over there
I don't know if they actually died
I was told that if you refer one person
to buy a Tesla you can have one so get
busy go refers true one other person
does it go
yeah I don't think it'll work
those are so cute
it's not film alright guys so the
question today is what is the weirdest
animal you've eaten that's a good one
take her out alligator rage explain why
your face is covered okay put that
awkward cuz I look bad my face has some
cream on it for making it perfect for
tomorrow
Haley back to you so Haley what is the
weirdest animal you've ever eaten um
probably snake okay I never ate snake
what about you what about you me yeah
hey dude Haley's sake yeah she said she
did what did you eat
all right snake an alligator so which
one's weirder they taste similar
probably to snake kisses from our
backyard okay Katie
what was the weirdest thing plus but I
didn't do it on purpose you guys because
it's not a weird taste if you think it's
a patient it looks like octopus it look
like this pastry and look like a dessert
so I grabbed it it was little so I just
threw it in my mouth and knew
immediately but it looked so slippery I
go up and I'm like the difference was no
so you expect a sweet thing an octopus
slimy but you've eaten like calamari and
stuff right look fried and I knew this
was not fried no it was like whoa Japan
it was a big mistake I don't like
talking about it
Billy's that had to be like some kind of
drive yeah like whale didn't will
deliver like New Orleans don't forget to
comment down below because we don't know
the question of the day yeah what's the
weirdest then will you ever donate
always remember to celebrate life
the baby
thanks for watching
