earn the stormy cloud
away
put it onto my baseball game my first
tournament ever and also my first game
ever oh you know but this year and this
year ever and this year ever this year I
think I've done it before but this year
my first
in 736 right now and if you don't count
day like they like savings in it the 636
it was supposed to be raining today but
it's clearly not
it's just because we didn't want to drag
everybody out because we thought it was
gonna be raining
ever about to propose it very long
get the beautiful sight over there
ah what I could write stop us
Oh skies blue
what your ax the waters green
and this is a very French
looking front use the driver
or whatever you want to be
dude
right
now
we're headed down
get it down okay your accents so thick I
can't even understand you really and say
good
Lily's a sick sick
it's hard to understand me
down
pretty-pretty when the sons
yes
and Wow
what is Bridge America I know it longer
one I don't know what these long
it's half a mile
three
I don't know it is only a check quiet
we'll drive it all the time yeah
I remember that bridge it was all
through the swarm
guess what guys alligators
very hard team which be another team
very badly that definitely was favored
to win
first inning it was 5 to 0
he was 8 to 1 though he was 8 to 2 into
3 8 2 5 into 6
two-six still oh yeah a night it cuz
remember when you were playing catcher
it's tiny
you're letting catcher catcher what's
going through my mind
now I was like it's gonna be a miracle
we get him out because and this kid
coming up always hits to the outfield
even if it is a pop fly
and sure enough he dies to one of our
players sails the ball like the
centerfielder and lookit catch it out so
the kid catches it some guy batting
sounds and I we have two outs
and he was really big two outs two
people on base two outs
and before I joined this team he hit
home
I was a great ball game very
then we go back tomorrow flu I can't get
