morning good morning good morning say hi
to everybody
hi what how has become long for you so
far it's going really well even though
this little with my second day he didn't
go yesterday yet nothing they can do but
it's good yeah
what's one word you use right now to
describe the quandary oh that's exciting
I always wondered so often and how much
of it they remember and how much they're
actually watching in your own laws and
they think they remember but it's just
that they've seen it more recent that
makes sense how often do you guys go
back into the archives and watch old
footage a lot of times is when something
comes up like one of the most common
ones for me is when stuff like this is
happening I'll be like oh what were we
doing last year on day three of it come
or you know just lost you on this day
sometimes you'll be saving about what
were we doing a year ago I feel Yola
what do you think you'll feel when you
watch videos of yourselves when you're
older looking back probably like why
would I say that
like I know to say it's really easy to
say this word
oh here's my question from Hannah Hannah
