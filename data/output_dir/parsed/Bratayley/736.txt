able to see because she's on the far
table but she just landed her ball twice
between yeah I might go see her she's
landed twice on a soft surface not
directly into the pit but on a mat on
top of the pit which is huge on the real
table might I add come on Annie she
landed it you can't really see her but
her hands our hands and that's how you
know she landed it nailed it
so right now we have two beans and we're
gonna try what you guys are gonna try to
make them light up okay I got to be a
mommy and higher than I am so first
we're going to start off by putting them
in cold water all right
so Haley went to school today and did
some science and so what are our options
tell us what we're trying to figure out
because you explained it so perfectly in
the car okay so putting them in cold
water so we're trying to get them to
light up right putting them in warm
water putting them in the freezer okay
honey
Oh turning the lights off okay putting
them under a light um or saltwater right
or sour water and the Sun daddy so
there's my six guesses I think if you
put him in the Sun it's gonna make them
light up Oh easy I didn't get to look at
the beads though but um
amazing they're just regular clear meat
but wonder align so we both might saying
the same thing okay all right so what is
this kind of water so this is cold line
rings it's the cold water all right
anything happen no no on the dollar can
you do like he's asking if they're
glow-in-the-dark and that's how we're
right how do we believe we're gonna
actually see them light up yeah I'm
gonna show you okay so since all this at
school yeah she already knows the answer
so this is the warm water so it's hot
don't be careful does that work no okay
we need some salt water let's add some
salt to that yeah salts here look at
that silk soft right Haley pour some
salt in oh look at okay just a little
bit okay put him in the salt water
excited oh my gosh okay do they light up
okay um put them in the dark or the
freezer put him in the freezer how long
it though that's the best a fridge
freezer downer should we put them in
there for a few minutes like one you
don't have to cook up it okay and then
disappear Wow disappearing beads there
it is um throw battery's almost dead
well stir we top quick turn him in the
dark
yeah go in that closet right there
and I hold him in here okay hold him in
there for a second for the lineup oh
okay
the last one is to put them in the
sunlight or the light sunlight nope
forget in life oh so wait how many
options are there that's not a good
light come up here we're gonna just
don't touch the light it's hot
her daddy might be taller yeah okay hold
the means the very low beam okay mm-hmm
are they lighting up no I didn't make
them line up either yeah all right
backyard hey let's go in the back this
is the one I guess the sunlight starting
lighter look at the verbal one oh and
that was hurting blue oh oh my gosh that
is so cool you guys they went from clear
to blue and purple it's it's a sensor
that mate when the light goes on it it
senses and make a color that is so cool
okay so which one do you want the purple
one did you just take it didn't fall for
it
piggy and mommy purple she was another
one
I may never mind purple I beg the same I
picked this handy
I cheated I looked at all Piper's like
I'll take it
give me the purple one they think it's
true okay and Hayley that's pretty cool
you learned this hand
nailed it oh and when you go back in the
house a full um turn buck
yep Tara back to clear all right let's
see it happen guys it's gonna flick
deflate I'm like wait clearly he's okay
it might take it a second yeah oh it's
