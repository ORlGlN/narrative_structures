proud of
I've never been proud of yourself what a
dude I'm proud of myself every day that
I survived not beating you guys but so
proud that I made it another day
you can't think of anything that you're
proud of
Larkin what do you know most most I
don't know about a moose pound of hoodoo
dude don't fail the question of the day
I mean Annie
not my kind of any don't fail the
question of the day I'm just not most
anything will name something that you're
proud of yourself for doing gymnastics
every day except weekends doing school
two days sometimes seriously seriously
seriously you're not most proud of one
thing you're done
seriously I'm the proud of one thing
clearly see right roll you marked this
camera down to Caleb all I clean up and
you find out what these are five pretty
fine like pink can't find her blankie at
the end of the world

uh you guys might be wondering why I'm
in here I don't really know why I'm here
I wasn't even naming you Quinn Bob up in
there I want to film over there because
it's kind of messy so I'm just gonna
stay here um so anyways so you guys know
the question today what are you most
proud of or that I've done what am I
most proud of I don't know why I'm doing
all these hand motions like what does
this mean because I'm so proud of doing
this stop like um and ice so I don't
think I've ever been like really really
really proud of myself because I'm
usually not the person to think that I
just did something excellent because I
wanna be all like I just did something
better than you so I wouldn't really say
that I ever thought of something that
was that I'm really proud of guess it
kind of makes me negative um or just bad
it's tough so I don't really have an
answer um I guess I just say baseball in
general like I guess yeah um that's
pretty much my whole answer
I guess getting my first home run and
they spelt with something that I was
most proud of or yeah yeah that so
