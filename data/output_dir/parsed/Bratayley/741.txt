of the day
Winnie we'll start with you okay Winnie
would you rather watch a sunrise or a
sunset I know
Winnie me too I said bye because then
you have a whole day woo I like of the
way you'll think uh but I would say a
sunset because I am NOT a morning person
and I very rarely see the sunrise but I
think I'd love to see the sunrise
oh yeah me like three kids sunrises are
more like relaxing really yeah cuz I
think you're just still doing stuff when
the Sun sets yeah okay we're still in
the sunrises handling you say nothing's
going on Go Go Go good I just don't want
to wake up to the sunrise but a sunrise
is beautiful but sunsets can be
beautiful too in Bali Ghana on that
cloudy day he didn't see me yeah he
actually didn't see the sunset just too
close and I'm yeah that was pretty good
is it raining we do a lot of them
gymnastics on the beach yeah what do you
think Haley would say baby fell right I

answer Haley would say sunset yeah

see the sunset yeah
