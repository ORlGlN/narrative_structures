today i'm pi/4 look at me so I'm getting
ready and go to teach gymnastics and so
I have a test coming up in about a month
so I'm practicing before the test and
mommy wanted to fill my purse here's
dentist and so what you have to do you
have five attempts to do your best hands
dip and if you need you can come down
and you how to if you come up if you go
up what it counts as one point and if
you go down carefully and put it for at
least one second
that's two points and you can and your
goal is to please get ten points I think
is that the highest you can go your
highness is ten point that's what we're
gonna do and me wrong you're gonna
practice it on the mat and we've done it
before and I only got one five the most
I've gotten was my fault and I am
allowed to calm down and rest for at
least maybe two or three seconds stretch
out I might not make this one glide and
resting your belly thanks to the
elements do for the midsection okay
I do back to sometimes when I go up I
lose control so I have to walk oh my
gosh because you're a point you wanted
to yeah okay keep going
hey it's alright we can try again after
this
that's one attempt zero points
one point okay one point to it so hey
boy oh man we should let you stretch out
hey
oh maybe you're tired okay that's three
of Tim down by three attempts one point
she has to do she gets five attempts at
press ham stands and she has to see him
any point she can get two points she's
got one more attempt she's got two
points no that doesn't count so it
doesn't two points so the most she can
get is four points if she goes all the
way up and all the way down she's a has
two points she can get two more points
on this next attempt ready go no you
said yes I get one up and one down
nobody told me that well you weren't
here when chicks like yes all right but
she's got to go cuz this is too much in
between now uh his last one she's made
one point because she didn't come down
controlled she can't chest it hold
herself up for a second oh you started
too close so you got three points yeah I
know yes you do three points you were
gonna fall that back okay what'd you do
