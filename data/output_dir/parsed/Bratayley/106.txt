I don't have a menu man oh there's lips
and eyes
it's
like mascara we're trying to figure out
what the fake snow is made of Hayden
thinks that small Percy thought it was
snip soap and now he's not sure but it's
snowing can you guys
so it's obviously not paper because that
would be what once you think
what
hey guys is water wet
is water wet no you're saying no I say
it is wet it is not when that is the
texture refill every day but water
rarely is not bad water is love going
mad water so morning feels wet

causes things to be wet he says yet I
think water as well that's pretty the
question of the day been looking up we
