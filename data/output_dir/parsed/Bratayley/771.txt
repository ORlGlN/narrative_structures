a we kept talking about it and it's
Haley who wolf says she wants to do the
mill circle but we don't know what our
coach is gonna say I know swish so we're
gonna see what happens
her coach has to okay we're gonna see
yeah see you're gonna see I'm gonna see

do the basket sway hey cuz she may want
you to get it more then maybe like next
week at state you can try the mill
circle I don't care whatever it is
whatever you and Miss crystal decide is
fine with me

and not nervous at bow beam no you know
that's not normal most people are most
nervous about being I don't know it's
the - maybe until you start going to the
high bar high bar higher than the beam
but the high bar is not scary because
all you have to do
the most thing that you're gonna do
while haibara Giants

honest yeah but the big the most thing
you're gonna do
basing the biggest thing the whole
