today okay we're officially weird it's
official done a weary soul to rest yeah
I will try to do my best to keep you
safe inside
to her
it's more clear when it's more cloudy
every day
but summers gonna tell her the story
cloud
good morning everybody it is 8 o'clock
in the morning
Saturday and we're baseball well some of
us are baseball
Kaleb and I are at baseball everybody
else is at the house because it's too
cold to be out this early and they will
be joining us when the game starts in
about an hour so I'm sitting in the car
staying warm while poor Caleb out there
way out there is warming up in this
freezing cold 30 degrees out it's
supposed to be 50 but warm up to 50 but
I don't think it's gonna make it there
before we are before we are done with
this game and since I don't have anybody
in the car with me I have to film
because yesterday I don't think we got a
lot of footage so today I was gonna try
to make that a little bit better but
then I realized that no one was in here
with me
so that's why I am doing it it is way
too cold to be outside right now
so I'm gonna just stay in here for a
little longer
probably for as long as I can up to like
the last second I think I'm gonna then
go take my chair and get ready right now
I'm just gonna enjoy watching I can
watch the game in here if no one parks
up there I could totally just sit here
and watch from here hmm that's a good
thought oh yeah and I forgot to tell you
guys I meant to have Caleb tell you guys
this and I keep forgetting the last time
that I filmed baseball practice and they
were kind of far away and I said I
wonder if you guys can guess which one
caleb is he was number 4 we never told
you guys the answer so he was number 4
so if you said 4 you were correct way to
go two thumbs up
I'm very impressed and for those of you
who didn't guess number four good try
the game
and so the games still going on but I
what I was catching I was having a great
game
I was not letting anything go past me
but then when I saw the guy that he was
stealing and picked up my other hand so
right when I caught him I could get it
and get him out but unfortunately our
picture through it'll lo where my hand
was
and here's my clever little ghost right
over and then BAM hits right it was way
worse right when I got it so there was a
guy third and he comes home because I
can't even squeeze the ball and he
scores on that and I couldn't bat and I
was just about to be up after that and
it hurt too bad and I was crying and I
don't cry a lot so we got one more game
today I think you're gonna be able to
play in it
feeling better now it's pretty bad huh I
know I could tell look we're in the car
and he it hurts so bad that we didn't
even get his catching gear off our game
is over we lost
and so right now we're going to Luke's
game and I am eating in the car with my
mom packed me so we're gonna go meet up
with the girls
