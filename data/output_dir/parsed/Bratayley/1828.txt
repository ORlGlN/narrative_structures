haircut I think all this needs to be
trimmed she's in the back hi well
because when it's curly you can't see it
but when it's um straight you can see
how dry it is and it probably just needs
to be trimmed up a little the front
looks good but the ends are really dry
trees elected trim trim just means to
cut the dead ends off just a little bit
right like that you don't want it short
right we could just get look if you hold
it down here you just get like an inch
cut off would that be okay yes do your
first haircut
