Haley I'd say some simple sort of slow
and then progressed more don't don't
overcommit
don't go on there and say I'm get a
video every day and then you video
Monday and then you're busy Tuesday and
Wednesday and video Thursday you'd be
better off to say I'm going to put up a
video every Monday and then do that and
so that way you're filming throughout
the week giving yourself enough time to
edit and remember week those are always
the best so you can head it over the
weekend put your video option on on
