Wow do you see how it's like expanded
when you see all the gassy so Brooklyn
and Bailey there's a lot and Rebecca
challenged us to this stinkiest fish
challenge in the world so if you guys
want to try this at home
no it's happening right now I think from
watching their video we're all gonna
throw up
I would imagine that we're all gonna
throw up the goal is to try to not throw
up but it's fine if you throw up as long
as you yeah you have to at least we're
gonna make sure rules are clear here
just in case you have to be inside you
can't either somewhat closed in area but
yeah not you don't per take in the nice
smell mm-hmm and that's really what you
want so we're gonna do this and good
thing we watch their video so we have
some warnings shoot out in multiple
directions so uh Rebecca probably open
on your side oh my god I'm only here to
make Annie be in the video because
otherwise I would not be anywhere near
this man right now so who's ready for
this
oh I don't know anything you're fine
just take a big would fit does not smell
good it smells like and it smells like
tuna fish gonna pop okay it smells like
tuna fish that you left out like in the
Sun and then some 180 okay
during was bad Rebecca this one doesn't
care not and a bad is the one we had I'm
gonna be honest okay it's not a little
