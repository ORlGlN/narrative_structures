so I can't they just pick me up from
gymnastics and we are going to see the
legends of Oz or he returns and we just
did a toy review on it so go check that
out and Hailey's brought some friends
along she brought Dorothy which we got
to do a review on so you'll see her and
we'll describe her more
and then we have Marshalls now Marshall
mellow or Malo I don't know how you
pronounce it but I will after we seen in
a movie I am hope and it's kind of funny
because after we did the tour you time
got inspired to see it so we're gonna
see it today and also my elbows been
hurting so I'm icing it it's been
hurting since yes last night now after
gymnastics practice on Thursday yeah
Thursday and it's been hurting it didn't
it I think it's just overuse or
something because it doesn't hurt and if
I give it a rest it doesn't hurt but
then when I get back on it and then it
starts hurting so so I'm icing it while
we speak and this was my lunch ice so
it's not that cold cuz it's been in
there for like four and a half hours or
five or something like that so it's not
that cool but it will do
so we are since we are trying to lose
how do you say that since the movie
doesn't start till a little while we are
going to stop at Target and try to shop
throw some stuff because I don't really
know what to sharpen more but we're hos
go time
kill him down that's what I meant to say
Chile Valentine and Haley wore her ruby
red slippers and I wasn't that excited
to see it but now that it were just
about to see it I'm kind of really
really excited to see Haley Haley show
aunty the sweater boy
just cries how do they think I bet you
little kids do ones that see if you guys
can get them going at the same time
ready Oh
if it hadn't hit the box you might have
gotten it
those hula hoops may be too heavy like
they kind of how you like that we got my
catcher's mask painted and we're going
to go pick it up and we're getting gas
because someone ran out of gas
see I told you mommy's always right I
told you those were easier
oh come on
those are the hula hoops we should buy
let's go to Hulu it'll be fine outside
yeah you can either pick one this one
but yeah
but first I gotta dry it out oh okay oh
that one's bent don't get that one don't
get a defective Hulu that could that
could damage your hula hoop records
I'll go to your mad skills
all right hula-hoop queen let's go to
the movie like I thought wait wait till
they drop
we just picked up my helmet and this is
what it looks like we just have to go
home and do and put the mask right
nothing the face mask on so it's gonna
actually look like a catcher's mitt no
just tell me the whoops and he didn't
actually paint the face mask but this is
what it looks like it's still fruit it's
awesomely awesome
and looks at for masking man I can't
decide which part I like better is it
the kind of Captain America symbol or is
it the red white in British that's how
it ended up and I like it
girls no talking or texting do you
understand me
soldiers fall in mine marks
I'll take it by the lid we just got a
movie and it was awesome and so we are
getting gas whoops so we are getting gas
and so we don't run out because you're
about to run out until we wouldn't have
made it home I don't think and anyways
you just needed to get it sucked so it's
to the today's question bidet is very
easy it is I know who done this before
but not in a long time what's your
favorite color
I thought of that because I was just
looking at Haley's ball that she got
from Target
and I thought it was a really pretty
color so that's good that's why it's out
of it so my favorite color is either a
neon green or blue and Hayley what's
yours I think that's kind of fuchsia and
so I'm I don't know if Caleb's get
answer but if he does this public and
maybe purple or something like that but
if he doesn't
I bet it's purple but so don't forget to
come too I just hit myself in the nose
dude we could go down below cuz we want
to know the question of the day is
what's your favorite color
