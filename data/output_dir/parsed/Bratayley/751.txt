big day today
Nikita is her first day of school I
didn't know Hayley's going back to
school just wanted to go to school and
we're gonna give it a shot
and we got a nanny here with us who had
to wake up early super excited then
we're on our way she's got to wear
uniform some khaki pants and a yellow
shirt just got a green jacket in case
it's cold cuz it is raining today rainy
rainy rainy morning so what yeah there
may not be recess today oh I do
yeah Haley got a couple weeks ago got to
go spend the day at the school so she
knows a little bit about what to expect
she's got a new backpack and she's got a
few schools alive in there
and that's it it's a big day I'm excited
for her but a little sad that I won't
get to hang out with her all day anyone
it's too early for it
way too early fully an hour
not an hour worth of sleeping a lot

to say goodbye to chat up walked away

so early guys
Annie was almost asleep in the car a
second ago we decided to come to
McDonald Nicol Donald ooh that's how
they used to say it in Japan we were in
Japan for a few months and they would
say McDonald do you remember that
anything you're only two so he's gonna
get a hash friend I'm gonna get a
biscuit and daddy got a burrito and
Haley's at school Haley what do you want
to eat Haley
