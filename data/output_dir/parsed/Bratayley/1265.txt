little Missy of what you do hey when you

lately when I told you to go clean your

you decide to like shove everything in
like your closet uh-huh pie in the face
you know that you have been recording
now for ReadySet nine minutes and i'm
gonna have to cut this down what do you
think the doctor is gonna say about your
eye that Recoleta gals because they are
you really using those glasses right and
what are you gonna say yeah mm-hmm
why don't you use your classes right
because I can't get Charlotte you can't
control your glasses look I have no
change the sewed up so they just put the
eye drops on really wet and we are
reading a book I took for my traveling
yep she's got a lazy eye just like Haley
this is her travel yeah yeah she calls
it her traveling I cuz she doesn't like
to think of it as a lazy eye right and
all the kids are making fun of her so
we're gonna see what happens next right
while we wait for the doctor to call us
back again
I had to go
wanker yeah so they patched her ah
you didn't get the patch you cut glasses
you want to keep reading you see what
happens okay the book knows we have good
news and bad news for good news
psychotic glasses is that get surgery
I can't Philly thank ya don't think it
we go feel the surgery huh yeah you're
gonna probably put you to sleep
we'll have to look we all about the
surgery and find out mommy
um I'm not very I had to wait for like
20 minutes to go to sleep so why because
murder
it won't take 20 minutes what I'm
assuming you go you're put to flight for
surgery for your eye surgery so how do
you feel a shot no I think they give you
the anesthesia as probably a gas mask
were you they put it over your nose in
your mouth and you count from 100
backwards and before you know it you're
asleep
and then you wake up and the surgery's
done oh well why don't you he doesn't
know yet what'd the doctor say
Danny the good news I got a sucker
sucker when a few weeks we have to read
overall if you have to read over all the
stuff all the material they gave us and
you have to go with me to the first
appointment and ask all your questions
and then if we decide to go through that
he thinks that she definitely needs
needs it
any just love that from you laughter and
I have a secret to tell her the doctor
recommended surgery in a few weeks when
in October yeah gonna be gone you don't
wear glasses well we have to make sure
that the glasses can come off but the
good part is that the surgery should be
successful and her I should straight now
but that's a question we have to ask the
doctors if she doesn't have to wear the
glasses after surgery what a day what a
day how is that good anything
spectacular this is the conversation we
have almost every day after gymnastics
right
I say how was gymnastics Annie says good
