scheduled programming to alert you that
if you download the go 90 app in the
United States of America app stores it's
free if you go there right now and punch

couldn't sleep last night my sweet
little iPad dad what are you doing on

under breath this morning
Oh like breakfast okay we got that

that foundation sleep

and just tell no I didn't tickle him
oh look leftover mac and cheese from
dinner last night out here who was that
bed number two
so it's going to be a fun day today you
guys hopefully hopefully every day you
can make fun um going over to maker
maker studios having a little meet
meeting with oh good morning everything
we got going on and then we're going to
try on some clothes some Walmart clothes
because doing a fun video with Walmart
and hey Kaylee's family on Wednesday we
got to make sure our clothes but because
no one wants clothes that are too big or
too small
oh she's hungry daddy oh let me jump up
and get you some here's some mac and
cheese from last night oh oh heart of
beckon cheese it was love that all night
when you are all right guys we got to
get this day started
showers and teeth being brushed and
breakfast being eaten and we'll check in
with you a little later you've been
thinking about yourself
good talk so we're here for a meeting
and these are the ones running it you
have to do what they do so everybody
stand up
do a little handshake sit down stand up
can you imagine if our meeting was run
by those two I would know you wouldn't
can do all that at home listen to them I
think they think they're in charge if
they ran because if they were in the
meeting we would just do handshakes the
whole time
well we're late for our meeting but
since oh thank you but since John G's in
charge then he'll give us a Hall Pass so
funny story last time you guys were here
I bought you lunch yet I didn't expense
it in time so I didn't incurring these
late fees with our company card but the
late fee has been like 14 cents and it
took like an hour to figure out how to
pay for it but while the 14 cents was
processing they charged me new $0.14 lee
so it's like I think of you guys every
time I deal with that because it's like
this lunch just blunt go away at lunch
14 cents for teams then that's really
funny
