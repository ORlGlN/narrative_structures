hunt for my thing let's see where could
my phone be whoo let's see
aha is this it aha it's on the charger
Thank You Lutzer okay so there it's a
little bit too early for lunch
and when I have a Rito's before lunch
they'll just be here uh so we're going
to hang out that a place to do stuff you
couldn't think of anything I just turned
no you couldn't think of anything
remember we talked about this beforehand
we're like he gets to think of the place
and daddy doesn't have to think of the
place because daddy's cooler than me do
you think I'm going
if we had a vote ahead of Oh on who was
the coolest daddies in the world yes who
would you vote for it
don't you you would vote for me would it
help you to vote for me
yes you knew that we were pulling into
this place and possibly getting a truck
that help you out more me by giving a
track we're gonna get a lot will that
help you though to vote for me can I be
an f250 f350 maybe we're at f-150 work
alright so that's the one
the cool
get in in the run you run the front no
no no other side this is cool wait
when I get my back you want to in the
back instead okay
I'm in a truck guys I'm gonna try I know
that you're I'm in I'm in the truck and
I'm in a truck don't even a truck we
don't have it yet but I know I just said
I'm in a truck oh you're in a truck okay
he said I got a truck I got a jack now
I'm in a trauma goal so look at the back
no big enough that's awesome ha
so we're driving it just to see if we
like it don't watch your back daddy said
watch your back is it different to drive
a truck keep in mind that we have the
Benghazi that we got sometimes so I
should probably be buckled that for
B if good idea Martin wall okay what are
your first thoughts okay hold on I've
got to show this buckle
look at this buckle that's cool and if
this thing's pop got better personal
thing
i'ma drop this one if you wanted me to
be honest
what's your first thoughts on this truck
what do you think about it
I love it I would ride in it every day
you have to convince mommy to drive it
we've write in it every day or we just
let you drive me everywhere okay
I have to show you something all you
ready to the gate we're ready David
great to film something ready
wait what am i coming up but is it
just keep on there's tumor that's so
cool maybe that is a good question how
did it like I know we're not gonna steal
the truck but how do they know that
other people aren't going to see because
before you leave they take a copy of
your driver's license
oh so he knows who you are and they'll
come get you if you take the truck
that's kind of scary
you thought they're gonna let you drive
it all right so does mommy know we're
getting it her mommy came in test drive
yesterday okay so she knows that we're
getting a truck only one that doesn't
know now it's hailing
but I didn't even notice I'll be
returning until he said what about if
return I'm like so oblivious didn't know
what was no no it's like what do you
want to do I know you're gonna say
chucky cheese and like no thanks
that scares me drinking scared yes it
comes around and one of those costumes
that don't like try to give you high
fives like those daily hostage night
just because one person grabs you in a
way try to kidnap me trying to kidnap do
they try to grab exactly kidnapping but
not kidnapping if you're the kids not
napping yes I hope like it's that
literal overturn alarm sound I mean I
got ears let go blanket look at that so
much ready yeah are you open
run wine

so brain update
ready for gymnastics no just wanton we
just went to lunch
and now we're gonna go guys cream so we
are about to get ice cream I'll scream
ah scream you scream off-speed I see
alright let's go okay here's the flavors
of the got I can do without filming I
mean without spilling this is mint
chocolate chip I pick that I also pick
this one and this is cherry
that's mango and then daddy picked blue
raspberry and I gave him a bite mint
chocolate chip has the weirdest texture
but it's really good
how do you feel like it should be ice
cream but it's not like it's ice cream
both it's like not ice cream it's like
Italian ice so disgust going home now
