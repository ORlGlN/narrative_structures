unpacking and doing laundry and then I'm
going to be super nice and I'm gonna go
up to Annie's room and I'm going to
straighten it and I'm gonna go to
Hailey's room and I'm going to
straighten it because they haven't had
any time off today is a day off so I'm
actually not gonna make them clean since
on their day off they're doing school
but at least they get to lay in their
beds lie in their beds lie people who
lie things lay or I might have made that
up or gotten a backwards I think people
lie down and you lay the paper down
somebody who's really good at like
grammar and English let me know if I'm
right I think I'm right okay but they
get to be lazy in the bed as long as
they're getting some check marks and

that so that's what we're doing this
