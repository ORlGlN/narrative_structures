the day the question of the day is if
you were to meet anybody famous who
would it be
it can be past or present for some
reason when mommy said wouldn't we were
thinking of the question of the day
mommy said that I my head went straight
to singing um people that sing and how I
got my guitar and all of that I think it
would be Taylor Swift
I'm pretty sure Hayley's would be I'm
gonna guess for them hmm Lady gaga ha ha
ha I may be last why cuz I probably
wouldn't let her meet Lady gaga
ha she's strange no I'm sorry I probably
would let her meet Lady gaga cuz that
would be pretty awesome and I just have
to explain to Hayley that she just
dresses crazy and I've heard she's a
really nice person like Nikki moon
yeah he just loves her passion although
Haley likes her fashion jeans but
Haley's never worn wrong am I thinking
what I was saying um Caleb and my what
fat what I thought in my head was a boy
singer and the first thing was either um
the person in maroon 5 or I'm moving yes
no what no mom already had someone pad
hands ah fine hmm and okay anyways Adam
Levine or black music Caleb would wanna
meet you and so since Olga Wow who I
would like to meet that's famous what
kind of uh is Aaron Rodgers and if you
don't know who that is
here's the guy that I have on my wall
which I will show you in a second and
he's also the grave a quarterback
tat - 212 skin - football don't forget
to comment down below because we went in
there the question of the day is who
would you if there is somebody in the
whole world who would you want to meet
that famous and the path to present can
be either one by ah babe a
