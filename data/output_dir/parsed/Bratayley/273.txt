of the day is so what is the earliest
memory of yourself or your family just
think about this I feel like I was in
North Carolina and there's this thing
that we go down like a cliff maybe I'd
never really close if you slide down it
there's winter water there's like holes
in there too and it was my first time
and
did you hit a rock is it cold
here all right Caleb and mary-kate are
coming down the rock now
down the cold rock
good job Eric a
here comes Caleb here he comes
there you go okay now Haley here's the
question are you going to go down that
sliding rock no she said you were
earlier okay this time Annie and
mary-kate are going together down the
rock together
and he's here in the belt that was fun
yeah you can have that one for sure is
it probably all right
I remember this on like photos and I was
like oh I remember that
so my first memory when when I was a
little tiny baby they brought me back I
was just like a nanny decided to pick me
up and she was just like just like I
have a new baby sister and I was just
like I don't know what you're saying so
yeah that's my sweetest and first memory
that I know of about me and my family
pretty much combined oh yeah don't
forget to come down below cuz we even
know that question of the day is what is
your first memory of yourself or your
family always remember to celebrate life
