until Halloween is that a promise every
day I'll see those ears on you at least
for a little while yes okay it's gonna
be too bad when the ears get lost
oh you think you're gonna lose them or
is daddy gonna lose them now
there could be a reason that you have to
take them off for a little while right
what just dead girls no I mean like if
we're doing something where the ears
have to come off
but I bet you can it'll be okay if you
put them on for a little while every day
oh look what the dog dragged in
what turbo ha ha so I have a doctor who
I'm in today to get late is that great

that bone good have the rudest daddy
ever that's good to be spraying on
people what's in there
it's just air okay that's compressor not
like there's no cleaner in it no it's
just air I mean it was cleaner Indus
compressed gas oh are you sure it's okay
let's watch it says probably do not do
not spray off your dog org oh my girls
dressed as Candace says Jude Azrael that
could not be good for you stop it stop
it you're going to bad daddy jail yeah
yeah cuz she noticed that for her top I
bet it does do not fail
probably caution do not spray all people
oh this contains this product contains a
bittering agent to help discourage
inhalant abuse do not inhale this people
keep out of reach of children and
daddies do not use near that it do not
tilt shake or turn upside down to edit
uh it's gotta say it summer hey no it
doesn't liquid contents may cause
frostbite on contact with skin if you
try it upside
Conn's no contact position if such
contact occurs
don't listen tell kids not to do it you
just did I'll do it you know yes watch
don't do this kids ever it's liquid
nitrogen you just taught the children of
the world no you're not you hear Jesus
that I'm doing that every day
no it'll it'll freeze it'll hurt you
they'll give you frostbite that's what
it just said what this flashlight so we
just had a good um science lesson how
does that work daddy make something up
quick that's a liquid that turns into a
gas immediately just by turning it
upside down by sprit no it's when it
hits the environment Skipton surprised
you spray it upside down especially
because it's in the bottom of the can so
when you turn it upside down it goes to
the top of they can and sprays out it's
compressed you should have put the
glasses on that could have been a BKB
it's compressed into a liquid state but
when it leaves leaves the compression it
turns stranger gas there you go science

eyes off of that I know he's mean he
should not have sprayed that at my two
