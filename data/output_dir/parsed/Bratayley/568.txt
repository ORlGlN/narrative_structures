hey bratayley fans i guess you've heard
we were making history and we're
starting at the very beginning of our
nation that is we're off on a trip back
in time to the american revolution in
costume and undercover we're in hot
pursuit of characters like General
George Washington lady spies soldiers
presidents pirates horses and some
pretty sweet dance moves will travel the
original 13 colonies to see what we can
find and recreate some of history's most
famous moment so saddle up
oh hey party people when we saw George
Washington loading up all of our
suitcases he's excited to go to Rhode
Island well I got some bad news it's not
actually an island Oh
this week we're going to Rhode Island
which is the smallest state in the
United States it had a major impact on
the colonies mostly from their farming
gonna go to a farm and check it out I'm
excited about the farm it was really
funny because I gave him a tip of $1
bills which had it his face on it with
our suitcases packed we hit the road
Rhode Island was tiny but tough Rhode
Island declared independence two months
before most of the colonies signed up
they just couldn't wait for it
so when we first got here we saw the
sign to Rhode Island so we got into a
car and we were greeting people to Rhode
Island waving at them hey well they were
honking to say hi and smiling and waving
George Washington was doing the turtle
then we kept cruising to our first stop
Coggeshall farm
during the colonial era nine out of
every ten people lived on farms that
means almost everyone being a farmer is
super hard work but it actually loved to
be a farmer George Washington George
nice to meet you sir pleasure
all through the Revolution which lasted
eight years the men spent a lot of time
away fighting the war so the women
stepped up and ran the farms we wanted
to see what that would have been like if
you were a farm wife back then
you spent a lot of time with the most
common creatures on colonial farms
chickens
Marie they're just a little bit hungry
what's up hmm that's a big one hey we've
got a bowl and sever him right now my
god chickens will eat almost anything
but we fed them corn and other grains
do they ever like to bite my fingers
like this hmm and see if any of a wall
come forward
the rooster seemed to be a little more
brave hmm it's called picking her for a
reason
what is pecking order no there's this
thing called the pecking order if the
rooster was eating and a chicken came up
it started eating by him he would Peck
the chicken and chicken would go that's
why the biggest chickens are at the top
of the pecking order yeah feeling feel
happy Thanksgiving enjoy the rest of
your time we'll see you at Thanksgiving
so guys are we ready to go visit some
sheep one of the main ways the colonists
resisted the British was they refused to
buy cloth sent over from England instead
they spun their own from wool it's
called the homespun movement and it
really made the British furious first
the sheep were hiding in the corner the
guy with horns is that a guy yeah that's
good not he's he's a ram yes most people
say you know oh what did she say
back no they say
Hey the British had fancy cloth uniforms
which were made of finer stuff but the
colonial militiamen were homespun
uniforms thanks to these guys
polyester sheep very rare breed yeah we
get wolfram our sheep the she pointed
out really badly but they didn't want to
come past us because they were so we
could tell them for them
hey come on this also

sheep again on the farm you could fall
asleep counting sheep or you could use
this fellow to wake you up in the
morning we pet cow and you know they say

be up to about 1250 if some breeds of
cows naturally have horns both for cows
and for bulls

milk a day and if you don't milk them
all the time Cal stop producing milk he

commands are whoa which is the most
important demand to know what it's for
them to know when to stop and you say

disgusting and weird
we took the wheelbarrow and we put it
all the way down over here
nice wheel and odds thank you
my dad did half of it and then he
carried it up to all of the other cow
pies no chance no chance and he put it
on the top and he goes I now proclaim
this to be hoop Mountain after climbing
that mountain of manure we had a little
fun making human wheelbarrows and we try
to be wheel barrels - ready go here we
have to do gymnastics ready walk you

and then George Washington decided to
the wheel barrel so my dad picked up
George Washington's feet and Haley
decided to jump on top of them and was
being bad luck carry the country on your
back George I got this
oh don't tell me what to do
but we still had more chores to complete
the hardest of all fetching water and
you will evenly distribute the way the
four buckets my dad carry two buckets on
his necklace and rope yeah
how's it fit he walked all the way down
to the well and he scooped up some water
and his two buckets back then they
didn't have pipes and running water so
they always had to lift water from a
well is it heavy food
yeah very good and we all had to bring
it back up and it was so heavy
there you go even Haley lifting it up
she's not tall enough
little bit of help for my dad are you
ready
on the count of three one yeah right
hmm I was too short
getting water is a whole lot easier now
mm-hmm water on and then we get it if
that's like boom like that skipping from
water to fire this is the place where
they molded metal and then we went to
the blacksmith shop where he was making
a bunch of hooks thank you that's the
air to the bellows so this force of the
air you ever blowing a fire to make it
burn hotter you know there's this big um
brown thing with two holes in it that
made air go into the fire to make it um
warmer
uh-huh what was he doing in there
he was like pudding and the little like
metal inside fire and then bended it
what whatever in the metal around that
thing i heated it up making a hook crazy
cool twist twist and then twist with
spin twist bit done whoo it makes it
look nicer and and we use the hammer on
the anvil to make that tell a pro hockey
bang and this is hard
penny mmm you made this awesome thing
mmm after so many farm chores we were
beat but it actually love to be a farmer
but then I think I would get really
tired of it after a while like I'd be
doing it like 24/7 a week and then I'll
be like okay I'm done with this job
so we drove into Rhode Island's capital
city Providence to try our hands at
another colonial profession portrait
painting in confidence wrong Island so
we're coming into this art studio to
paint some portraits the most famous
artist
in the early days of the United States
was a guy named Gilbert Stuart from
Rhode Island of course in case you
forgot what state were in we're in the
state that Gilbert Stuart was from and
he painted all of the american founding
fathers as well as the first six US
presidents Washington Adams Jefferson
madison monroe and John Quincy Adams
which is pretty cool
and you ever see one of these bad boys
see that painting right there
guess who painted it in many ways
Gilbert was America's first great
portrait artist maybe even America's
first great painters we had our George
sit for us so we could try to capture
his presidential look halfway through
our painting session Billie and George
had a pose-off
George finally sat back down so we could
finish our masterpieces added some
features of our George Washington like
the beard and mustache and the ribbon
and the tie and super cool sunglasses
before cameras people had to sit for
hours and hours to get their portraits
done and even then it wasn't always
perfect it's a lot harder to paint a
picture than to take a selfie
