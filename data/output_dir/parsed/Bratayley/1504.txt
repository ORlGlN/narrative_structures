teensy-weensy bit ripped it so I guess
we're just gonna have to put it in the
wall my bag because I am like I said
before I throw it putting things in the
bag
No you can't do any better anything
because you can't rip it as good as me
so we're almost there pretty much yeah
yeah
because if it does then you'll have a
combined four seconds of jumping usually
it's like this so what do you want us to
say just really pretty yeah I'm here
we're car playing for the meet and
that's about as real as it gets
who's nervous me who's excited me

the very worst
who's gonna smile at the judges on their
floor routine with teeth showing your no
I'm so proud when your hairs anyway
we're the exact same clothes you guys
look a lot at a meet when you make out
we're far away from you don't worry
little different in a minute

something good or that's swell now we're
gonna have to head home and we have to
wait from boomer and Annie yeah

I heard that the judges are being very
brutal and when I heard that I thought
that my dad said booed like that they
were being boob oh it's far away so yeah
so see you guys when we get home and
hopefully and these next few events will
be better

it was my best I don't know who's my
best beam but it was a pretty good
beamed a pretty good floor but my ball

bars horrible it I got six eight but
whatever happens this was probably one
of the hardest
jeez

a scar like came up to me and I'm gonna
give her a little shout out so shout out
to the girl like she looked to me and
her friend yeah so what happened when
she came up to me and she said what's

i watch them every day and I say thank
you and then she turns around to her
friend and says and then our friend gets
all excited so hi guys it was good to
meet you

the grocery store and because it's like
well there is gonna be snow to that snow
early in the morning like really early
we don't have much of it so me and mommy
made an emergency trip kid grocery store

night yeah party the grocery store let's
do it I think everyone else have the
same ideas

rotten brown bananas have your choice of
any rotten bananas you would like you're
like Annie
we found we did we found some that
aren't so bad I mean they're a little
bit and apples

kind of slim pickins on the milk to
watch it not even snow that much
tomorrow they're calling for four to
eight inches it's probably gonna be like
an inch what else should we get oh I
