pulling up their hair or tying up their
shirt and that's me okay come on the
biggest left us yeah it's dinnertime
did you like walking in the woods yeah
we'll have to film it on the way back
you left me so I couldn't film it
it's hailey salt hey guys so um if
you're wondering why videos so short
it's because today we're pretty much
hanging out with our family that didn't
want to be on the video and we just
really didn't do anything all day so say
if you don't like how the video is this
short um we don't like to read this
short either because you know means we
didn't do a lot of things that day
anyways um there will be no question the
day today sorry I just couldn't think of
one and I'm literally about fall asleep
fall asleep right now it's pretty late
and but oh maybe my sister's can find a
question today but I really don't know
so remember um - no I can't say that
there's no clue that just tune in next
time our vacation is coming to the end
we're all packed up to leave in the
morning and Caleb's too tired to think
of a question of the day so I thought of
one which is what did your most favorite
thing you did on your most recent
vacation my favorite thing that I did on
this vacation was the two hikes that we
went on they were really fun but some of
the family members went ahead some
stayed behind it is really fun and
everybody just settling down for the
night mom's like packing a little and
I'm watching some TV Caleb's on his iPad
and I have no idea what heylia so
everybody's like telling us settling
down and we have not filmed a lot
because we had a guest that couldn't be
filmed her over here well on the camera
and so he couldn't really film us
playing so that's another reason why the
video is so short and I think Caleb was
trying to say that I didn't really
listen to what he knew didn't really
listen what about what he was saying and
yeah so don't forget to calm down below
because we want to know the question
today is what is your most favorite
thing what was your most favorite thing
to do on her most recent vacation by sea
tomorrow
baked potato baked
