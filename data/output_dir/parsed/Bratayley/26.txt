we just drugged Annie out of the bed
because we have to go upstairs and shop
in the closet the figure out on her hair
to figure out what we're gonna wear to
the concert so that's what's happening
we are headed down to the Gaylord again
we were just there for the gymnastics
meet that's where the cheerleading thing
is today too or this weekend and we're
had the concert tomorrow so we had to go
get packed for that we're kind of past
we gotta figure out what they're gonna
wear on stage if we can't find anything
in the closet we're gonna run to the
mall we're gonna go get Brooke a present
it's her birthday we're having a
birthday dinner down and oh yes oh poor
Gigi all right all right we're
unplugging phones down come in here come
on yeah come on where is my dos dos not
you know but those okay Annie come on
come here we're gonna play dos let me
tell you something
we found this card game I found out this
card games coming out it's okay it's
from the makers of uno but it's dull so
instead of one card going in the middle
there's no something instead of uno card
going in the middle there's dulse cards
coming in so we're gonna unplug for a
little while and play a card round
because we're getting ready to go to the
hotel and we wanted to we haven't had a
lot of family time lately
yeah letter letters how to shuffle
that'll be under stone so laughing
all right here we go Oh Haley you want
to try to shove off this is called 52 if
I pick up no way anymore that's why
that's why it's a little harder so
there's a lot all right he could dad you
can start dealing yeah
daddy already looked at all the
instructions I'm gonna explain up
Wednesday so it is like DOS okay so the
way it starts on two to four players oh
seven plus we're all good all right so
I'm gonna do mommy into so I'm gonna
kill seven cards hey hey do we gonna see
my white seven is that like you know yes
so so far so good
it lets you keep in mind guys when we're
playing this before actually it's a
points game I'm amazed so I went so you
wanna leave yeah no you need to make
sure that you get you get the big cards
out of your hand because if whoever goes
out of cards first goes out and then
they get that point so everybody's hands
okay okay
so the way that's worse because it's dos
instead of one card in the middle is you
can either play it's gonna go to any
first but you can play a seven and
ornate or you can play two cards that
add up to seven or two cards been add up
to eight can i play yellow that's where
we will get into that you play a yellow
eight on top of this 8th you get a bonus
so if you play a 3 and a 4 that happened
to both be yellow on this seven now not
only do you get to lay a card down
everybody else has to pick up a card uh
explain it as we go
I want that right that's sure and then
this flips out
no that's only if it's a double one okay
I have a beer I have a very very very
important question probably the most
important question of the game when I
have two cards left I can't you only get
rid of one my only be able to get rid of
one carbon when you pick another card of
you ever see Jess again she thanks right
now you take that now you get to put a
card Oh two sixes in the middle can you
take this back let's go again
put that six down went over that other
stakes were faster there we go and she
matched colours for now flick our deck
Thanks myself for sending us those in
sponsoring this video
yeah thanks Miguel I think I know
can i play I don't have I don't have
that don't have those I have I have a
hashtag you can play that one either
I can't match a color but I can play it
does it matter which I play it on no do
I still get to go again cuz I really

hate being cold except at night when we
sleep invisible cuz if you like that
shiver and then let your back ties to
her I know
