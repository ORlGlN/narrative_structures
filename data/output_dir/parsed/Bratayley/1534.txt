bit better but so doesn't feel the great
yes um so we're just gonna go to the
question of the day my name is Nina
I'm from Lithuania how did you meet your
best friend I met my best friend when we
first came to secondary school
she was just Sarah lines and I thought I
should say hi to her because she looked
shy
I had my best friend
and my dad is in the military we were on
a military base and um pretty much I
just met him there and he was like
here's where I live and blah blah blah
and so comment down my logs we want to
know when I'm going to sign off if it is
hard for me to talk and so see you guys
tomorrow
so Annie how do you like the gingerbread
house my it looks a little plain mm-hmm
so why didn't you decorate it coz she
decided that she likes sleep more than
gingerbread houses good she looked what
sleep she fell asleep I ran to the store
to do a little bit more Christmas
shopping while this was hardening and
when I came back the boys were watching
their movie and she was asleep and we
didn't put any decorations on so the
good news is that you didn't miss out on
any of the fun and you can help decorate
this whenever we have time in a few days
because tomorrow is jam-packed we might
be here a while

day since I'm if I wasn't so rudely
