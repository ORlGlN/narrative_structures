I'm nothing you don't have to clean
anything you just hear what you want to
hear anyway Caleb you didn't hear me in
the choir tell you about the roof rooms
need to be straightened up before we can
clean the cage up we didn't hear that he
just likes to hear what he wants to hear
he's got selective hearing bully boring
hi are you ready to show us your

guys what shirt what's your new letter
saying oh no that's your old letter no
that's an old letter too
what is P say I helped her write her
name oh I guess she's done showing up
she can't do it anymore she's exhausted
from all that schoolwork
oh he loves you he loves to annoy hmm
how do you get any homework done in this
house fine bird okay we just don't know
we're gonna put their guinea pigs we
might put in that box
they might clean it up this box you put
stuff in there yeah you put stuff in
there where they poop yep okay just
making sure I heard that correct
please Toshi what do you see in there
it's not very doing you touched it
well he'll have to wash his hands after
this for sure
okay they just wiped it on toast did you
stink
okay so the first step is to take the
guinea pigs out of the cage up in there
we have to clean their cage out you can
pat Charlie right now your Charlie I'm
gonna pet your angel okay let Caleb get
angel in there new competitor we're
taking them back to the pet store
I'm just kidding
Haley I'm just kidding we're just
cleaning their cage out real quick and
then they'll go back in their cage okay
do you want to hold angel while we clean
it out so you pour all of that into the
individual is no don't use your hand if
you don't have to so we pour everything
in that into the garbage can right all
right look at the vacuum you guys watch
the guinea pigs
okay okay we already vacuumed all the
stuff over there and so now we're
pouring the bottom that bottom things in
on the cage the bedding yeah Denning and
why did we move your cage over here we
move the cage because it was over there
but the vent is over there and it's cold
okay
you chilling with angel so that's your
job you get to just sit here like a
princess and hold the animals where's
Charlie I don't know Charlie disappeared
can you hold them both no I can't you
can only hold one will you hold Charlie
now so Charlie's not sad
I'll put angel away and you hold Charlie
for a few minutes Lumiere I can't well
Charlie sad and Annie can't hold Charlie
right now cuz she's cleaning up all
right so you'll hold Charlie real quick
and then we'll get Angel back out
goodness I think angels bigger than
Charlie all right well I'm gonna go help
them will you watch Charlie for a few
minutes okay yeah we just figured it out
because somebody left a comment on our
last video yeah they know we got a
guinea pig but somebody left a comment
telling us that the food goes up here
and there's a little pick the food up
and let's show them there's a little
square up here where the food sits so
the food doesn't the food goes up here
so that it'll stay out of all the
bedding and the food won't get where the
poop is and the bedding won't get in the
food isn't that cool
so whoever left us that comment Thanks
right do you thank them cuz now we know
because um yeah we've never had guinea
pigs before

clean cage she loves them do you want to
hold one again she doesn't want that
