it the right way but filming with the
selfie stick

personally the era airplane was like
you're doing that wrong true story
was it one of the workers and where's
the lady what he loved was going away
together random lady getting off the
plane I feel like she not only wasn't
she I thought too she stopped like dude
her bags to get on when she went to walk
off she's like you're not doing she know
about it
no she probably felt sorry for daddy it

us knows we walked in and she realized
the cleaning people here she's like okay
I found
baked potato baked potato baby thanks
for watching Britt Ailey
Katy's always telling me to film with my
iPhone so let's see how this goes
I'm on my way to LA to meet up with
everybody and we're going to see how fun
this is going to be so I figured since I
was traveling by myself I would get a
selfie stick and I'm not sure like how
this works
but I think we're best friends now so
I'm going to travel with this selfie
stick the whole time because we're
basically the best friends
it's my new best friend we got hungry
and the selfie stick and I decided that
we would would eat some some lunch so uh
great lunch the selfie stick and IR and
we're just hanging out here I'm fun oh
right as I turned the camera off this
lady heard you're walking away she told
me that she didn't think I was doing the
selfie stick right and he is very upset
he hasn't spoken for like at least 20
seconds
he's uh he's coming down it's not happy
with me apparently I'm not doing it
right so we'll have to look through our
problems oh we're about to have our
boring call and I just informed selfie
here that I don't have a ticket for him
so we're kind of nervous so if he has to
be snuck on the plane now and he doesn't
like small spaces so
oops selfie wasn't very happy with me
there's nowhere for indecent
he doesn't appreciate being in the bag
he doesn't like you very much all
