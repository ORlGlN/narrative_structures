today which is you like snow or sand
better
I like sand and that's like I'm just got
out of the water from like the beach and
then like a role in it I don't like that
anything I just like so I guess
draw being dry in the same got it I
think I would have to say the sand too
though I love the snow
it's really yeah but I think I'm blurry
do I look blurry you and Inez focused I
like this but I don't like the sand
because it gets everywhere but I'd
rather I think I'd ride safe and that's
it
