gonna go look at our Apple guys the side
is really drives all droughts and rotten
because I left it here and this side I
just started eating but I promise I'm

were gonna go on the big ferris wheel
but plans changed a little bit
meets ran late and so we're gonna try to

that I haven't film much today because
I'm like oh I'm banking on going to the
ferris wheel and filming all that fun
stuff but now we're chef pretend we're
on again yeah yeah everybody put their
arms up and it'll be so much cooler when
we actually go on it so I think that
we're the girls are so tired
Thank You Annie right on cue that's
perfect um we're gonna run down and get
them some dinner
I apologize at this videos like two
seconds long and that we're talking
about what we're talking about right now
we are we are party animals laying in
bed and maggots that way yeah I'm
scraping subway eating of you watching
Ferris Royal pretending candy pretending
so I guess we'll be back yeah I guess
we'll check in after the movie no they
don't want to watch us eat we already
watched k to eat or Apple yeah you take
it yes you can eat like a big circle on
the side which is very funny tell
everybody why you're eating an apple
because
IFT dapple a day for 365 days and then I
met 100 buckaroos so the apple a day
challenge this public knowledge for
YouTube consumption ok ok $100 for
eating something for eating like a
subway that what if I eat Chipotle every
day for a year what will you guys give
me a bullet every day for a year I would
probably pay for you miss ha ha ha fix
my tummy my exercise y'all get me a
personal trainer ah Instagram challenge
yes Dani a hundred cuz someone said
something half of it is going to some
others yes the deal with I was gonna
give Annie $100 if she did 365 days of
Instagram but miss Jill kindly suggested
that I should pay her a dollar a day I
said fine but half goes in savings I
think that's you half of 365 you're you
can figure that out
look hit the bear alright so this is a
normal night normal Annie sleeping yep
Annie's asleep right halfway through the
movie Annie's out
yeah these two are hanging out still we
are wrapping up our day I mean she's not
gonna like after it yes Lisa know what
you guys seem to have a little bit more
energy than right before dinner I think
dinner gave him a little bit but I'm
getting high you are you look like
you're tired so the two big girls have a
meet tomorrow so it's probably good that
we're turning in and made it a night in
the hotel relaxing might not have been
very fun
to watch but you know that's life
so Annie the question of the day is what
I don't know I can't even think of one
message I what is your see what time do
you fall asleep yes Annie tell us what
is your bedtime
my bedtime is when the movie turns on I
love you oh you're sweet
oh she's really asleep oh oh you turn
away from me oh you're giving me the
silent treatment
oh okay yeah I can live with that you're
my sister so I can live the fat Hayley
what time is your bedtime
hey ten yeah I'd say it's about ten
that's not really good like it's not the
best time for a seven-year-old but we
are night owls and for someone who
doesn't have to be awake very early I
think it's okay as long as you get them
out of sleep but you need what time do
you wake up eight or something right 9r
8's annie has Jim yeah
eight o'clock you a clock so you Clete
from 10:00 to 8:00 how many hours is
that
yeah four hours of sleep every night
