I miss drip right before oh I didn't
think it dripped on you let me get you a
napkin I thought it just dripped on the
plate around on the counter
okay so we're having like cinnamon toast
banks or something and strawberries and
Haley's drinking some milk and we were
up and it is 8:15 in the morning and
he's in the shower
she's got to be on set in about an hour
or so what is it and then they both have
to be on another set at 1:00 so oh yeah
two sets that Annie's got two sets they
two different projects you've got one
and then after the second one we're
getting on an airplane and heading to
Salt Lake so it's gonna be a crazy day
crazy crazy crazy we're gonna do some
school in between actually Haley and I
are gonna get Haley's school done before
we go on the her set and I'm going to
get packed for Salt Lake and daddy's
taking Haley I mean Annie to her first
call time so that's the plan and then
literally we're leaving from set to go
to the airport and we're gonna be in
Salt Lake late tonight
