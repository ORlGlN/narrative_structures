with our puppies one honey
Riley um had tummy problems like her she
wouldn't go to the bathroom or eight and
she was really skinny and then mommy
just came home from gymnastics and she
noticed that Piper has a bunch of bumps
on her if anybody knows what these bumps
are I don't know if they're gonna show
up on camera stay Piper don't move they
show up on camera and then over here
there's a lot don't touch them right not
to yeah we have no idea what they are
but I'm gonna go look it up online and
see if there's like an emergency that I
can take her to or I can take her in the
morning see if I can war after war after
war I have never seen anything like that
cuz her fur looks fine other than that
like I don't think it's mange
I've heard of mange oh my gosh like I
saw I know daddy
wants to know he was looking it up
online right now isn't anybody
accidentally spray her with something
like air freshener is anybody spraying
air freshener anybody knows that she got
into something ate something five
seconds before or five minutes now she
had nothing wrong you saw her before we
got home cuz she was laying down right
there next to us so weird
how's Riley doing her tummy better
maybe if we brush them they know I want
no one to touch them and I want you to
wash wash your hands if you accidentally
touch them so I'm going to be once
around with our dog if you know but this
is a hard question it but if you know
just calm down below a sad light be
useful if you don't figure it out the
next trace didn't give this they really
don't feel like bumps that much they do
