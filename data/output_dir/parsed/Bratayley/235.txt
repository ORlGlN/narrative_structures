check back in when we can but the good
news is we have we get off early between

so now this is going to make me watch it
and then ones watch second one and it's
like a movies on but we're going to go
do the climb place and get some energy
out for it get one is I guess so
go haven't seen it but does um you know
yeah so we're hoping that Annie and I
made a question of the day because we
did not last night we ended up staying
up late that's okay pretty early at
least you know what time it is 10 11
something almost 12 we did not wake up
at 9 this is not nine o'clock lieutenant
did you wake up 10:45 why my alarm went
off and I just closed about
I hit stop I cannot look up at 7:00 I'm
trying guys and we are not young we're
no testable engine I'm still a really
weird life hat we're just not in someone
put needles on their snooze so I would
you look up it would hurt them and
there's a closet oh gosh
yeah so she just ate her pancakes and
she did hurt she's starting her tour
list today let's watch her do her first
tour I already saw that her bed was made
so she did it so let's see what she does
going to rent it out first and then
she's gonna open fat don't I said oh why
didn't I do that fine fat don't decide
either is it you know fun fact syrup
melts in the dishwasher so you don't
really have to rinse it you just rinse
it a little bit and anything really yeah
cuz it melts because it's liquid like
that I don't know just melts off so
there we go that's all you had to do is
just rinse it really fast and then you
put it in the dishwasher and then when
you turn the dishwasher on it should
rinse out nope you should always rinse
out because that's going to smell all
right chore chore chores a stew always
want to do this okay that's probably
good alright and then see what she does
next see if she can figure it out that's
dirty okay here she goes with her chores
here we go I don't tell her anything
anymore all I say is wake up and then
she's after it
