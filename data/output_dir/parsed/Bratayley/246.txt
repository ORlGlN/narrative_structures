Hana and we're taking the road do it and
I might just be making this awesome

think on the way like we stop at all
these different places in on the island

we've heard all week how if you do one
thing in Hawaii or in Maui that's what
you should do is the road to Hana so is
our last hawaiian breakfast because
we'll probably just make i'm not trying
to make it bad i'm just narrating
because we'll probably eat a breakfast
at the hotel tomorrow i mean at the
airport tomorrow

I just have this feeling or maybe we'll
be somewhere else just as amazing okay
