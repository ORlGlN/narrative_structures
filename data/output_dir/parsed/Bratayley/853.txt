time for me what are you touring was the
worst fakes we things that I ever heard
yeah you this alright it's morning time
Annie is eating some eggs and cheesy
biscuits
Haley's pretending to sleep she feels
better than she felt yesterday morning
but it's not looking like we're going to
be competing today now we're just
debating on whether we want to go watch
we got a corn pillow heated up coach
Mary's amazing she made these corn
pillows so there's corn inside here sewn
into a pillow and you heat it up in the
microwave and it like retains the heat
so like gymnast uses them to heat
they're like muscle sore muscles in the
morning cuz that's a good thing she
can't reach the sauce don't drip it on
my couch so we're using it for her head
cuz we think she's got a sinus headache
he said you're a weenie so it could be
another lazy day around here
we'll see she throat hurt she's
literally only been up for about thirty
minutes
where is he oh he's sharpening pencils
hey Alfonso what's up dude wow wow what
wow
sure why not go well like we weren't
even gonna like it wasn't gonna go to
the meet like actually compete in it but
I don't feel good so we're not even
going to watch - oh my head hurt my head
hurt
umm my tummy hurts
I feel really shaky ah my throat's good
and I'm coughing you've never missed a
meet before have you have you I think so
I don't think you have don't see you
know I'm not trying to make you feel bad
okay um so that was obviously the wrong
thing to say I didn't think she would
get up that upset so I calmed her down a
little didn't mean to make her upset I
thought she'd already realized it but
did we establish have you missed a meet
before I was just trying to have a
conversation I'm sorry we won't talk
about it then cheer up we'll find
something fun here to do or something I
can't promise it'll be super-dee-duper
fun but it could be like you know how
when you're sick you feel yucky so she
took a bath today we washed her hair so
I thought maybe we'd curl it and do a
little things that she can do sitting
down cause she's getting shaky and dizzy
when she stands up yeah that kind of
make you smile maybe maybe me oh I have
to tell you to cover your cough one more
time I'm gonna play your ribs
you know me all right
I get some curling irons out some wands
have a little girly time Hayley's at gym
PS I got to go get her later she'll be
excited she was very sad that she wasn't
going to get to go to the meet cuz she
had gym and that we were going to be
gone so that's a good thing right we're
gonna make a little seven-year-old
really happy
what a just surprise her maybe we could
pull that off but that means daddy's
angry go get her I told her I'd come get
her if I didn't go we'll make your
happen we're really really mad at us for
tricking her now
freshly curl the hair does that make you
feel any better are you lying to me
do you feel refreshed feel like you
still need a nap okay well that's good
time for that take a nap I can't why hmm
you want to go outside and backyard and
get some fresh air real quick
I'll walk out there with you daddy carry
me well I'm leaving for two dogs right
yeah
oh I got idea let's go outside and get
some fresh air and then let's go put
your carpet down in your room up up in
your room details details
you want him to carry you outside to get
fresh air why your toes does it cold out
in the 60s Oh

okay get some fresh air for the dogs are
gonna come with that and run around in
the yard they both have the dragon ah
what a beautiful day
oh who brought the bunny out or the
kangaroo out here Piper hey whoa oh and
dirty look at all the leaves in there we
haven't seen this water this time of
year cuz we haven't lived here a full
year yet having to our crab thing
Teddy pulled it out nope why is it white
that's got more scum
doesn't feel like winter does it well in
like a week it'll be winter we get a
feel like when uh no cuz we'll be in the
Bahamas
alright beautiful out here I think the
key to get a nanny to feel better was to
get her up and outside of Oh Benny from
the side all right this is my time here
expect I don't feel nothing good I think
um we're gonna play a little game of
chase Piper Piper till she runs under
the trampoline like we used to do at the
old house or we're playing keep-away I
guess yeah her tongue is already hanging
out whoa
sometimes I already got you no no no
he's only not to me never wedding what
are you gonna help us here ah she got it
Piper's tongue is covered in dirt can't
plow into people the first time Annie's
been up and not dizzy she can't breathe
alright we should probably stop the
running around that was a good fresh air
likes to call it quits
hey plan run away dude me and
you're gonna watch the meat a little air
looks long you have to grab hey hey from
the gym guru and we're off to an
adventure and I'm eating Jesus
this person right here he doesn't like
cheez-its
true to my eyes
do you look sick
you definitely look like you feel better
from yesterday oh this feels better and
this coming tummy problems I think
that's probably from the antibiotic side
