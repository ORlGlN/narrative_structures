time for my family it's another Saturday
where I have to go to him and make it to
go free bit it's good thing about today
is that we're going to Mia's house after
my listeners
these toothpaste on my lips
diversity the bunny is out for her first
adventure she's not a huge fan of these
wood floors by the way so they she looks
pretty bad on them heavy feet of any
doubt guys the bunny is out dog play oh
my god could you get any cuter okay I
didn't know her tail did that
I thought her tail was late right
attached to it it's not it's like
apparently it can dangle can you guys
see what we're talking about I don't
want to go too close until we get a good
look can you see her tail that's laying
down it's a Cottontail but I thought it
caught like I thought it was literally
like in the shape of a piece of cotton
just there but apparently it's not
oh how cute is she I know it's going to
be your turn in a second you guys we
have a spoiled bunny this should go
drink out of a bowl today is cage
cleaning out not just cage cleaning like
major cleaning Haley's at gym this
morning a three paragraph 8 3 paragraph
page about this task a system developed
in India and what its purpose was do you
know what its purpose
barely so when Haley gets home from
school she's going to help her take it
out and clean it out completely today
once a week is the plan yeah so a couple
times a week she's been just scooping
the poop out but it's time to clean the
bedding out and later on Andy's doing
going to see her course--you Luna
no I got out of the shower and I look in
the mirror I guess that is not how long
my hair John no like drying it off and I
was like because used to my hair was
like this long ah comes Bruce you
wouldn't know it would you still love me
if my hair like this look like this and
Annie would be like no but we could be
friends only we could still be right
nothing I think about women to the mall
like doesn't maybe she would shoot with
me we talked a lot yesterday about
parents embarrassing their kids whoever
do we embarrass you
she's known it on school let's let her
focus she's got like 20 more minutes
before she's got to go do her hair I
think you should be a horseback riding
school he could do school on the horse
we do need to go out there a few minutes
early those for the chicken leg because
you're obviously not going to ride Lena
no she's going to take care of Luna Pat
her and love her is gonna maybe clean
out her stall or something brush her and
then she can ride somebody else
I asked Amanda who was going to be the
first to ride Luna she goes she goes my
mom said maybe me that'll be an
adventure you'll want to see you know I
wonder if they'll let us come the first
time somebody gets on our which is a
little bit of a breath to to our family
that was John W officer hmm we are going
horseback riding then later today
we're going to Mia's house
and yeah we have sleepovers okay we're I
mean you're hairy and if they don't film

me and mommy okay awesome
so I can say - that means taking care of
Lena I got Bobby hi that's cupcake not

my horse doesn't even got no sweaty
workout that was super fun
alright my friends you know what this
means we're going to teach Haley to
clean us out and it might take us a few
times a few weeks to for her to learn

do this Shore the girls are going to
Mia's house but this deal is have to be
done first look what the bunny can do
