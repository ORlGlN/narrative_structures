hi for me okay guys so we're going to go
down there today we're going to pick out
our barrel to go over the falls in huh
I'm Errol Susie's never been that ahead
rupaul's if you go on the tour you'll
learn about all the people who have gone
over the falls in a barrel some people
did it for fame some people did it for
publicity
some people did it for money but like
you learn on the tour like how many
people have been over in a barrel of
Niagara Falls that's why in a barrel
where else would you go over the falls
I wouldn't go over the hole but if you
had to pull out of a boat a submarine
anyways so hopefully we I don't know if
you can do the same day but if you can
and we're gonna try to go on the tour oh
yeah we made reservations to eat our
lunch up there and that should be cool
it's our first view of the falls other
than for my ring but they closed up
this is grander than it was in our room
because we were actually a further away
that I thought we weren't gonna a little
bit of a hike downhill might I add so
later on gonna be hard to get up there
look guys digging the rocks down here
and I'm just wondering that's not where
people go frame that's not where people
go they go over down there that's what
y'all walk that way first it's like that
way first I don't care where we want
okay but yeah so they would go over the
actual big falls
can you imagine that's like falling off
a building in a barrel
there's the boat let's uh let's us how
close it gets
it will mess your hair up so as they get
closer and closer you realize how
massive the balls are
we're way down there and now we're a
little bit closer we're gonna go walk a
little further down like over in that
area and
see what kind of view that is but they
are amazing
crazy views
guys we're getting closer and closer you
can rained on and you can like feel feel
like it's like it's sprinkling out I
don't know if I want to get much closer
actually my hair is going to get we're
going to go I've never shown a lot of
waterproof too we should have probably
brought an umbrella it's like seriously
I wish you guys could feel it it's like
it's sprinkling this used to be part of
the halls or touristy
so call Darla
let's analyze if you've never been here
I'm hoping we're giving you a good
visual on what it would be like to
actually be here you guys see how far up
the mist goes that is crazy
being part of the crowd mr. ray
until it does now
the regular river engine you fall you
know 300 feet to your dad in America in
a better a journey behind the falls we
better reaction winter room apparently
we're going to get a morning shower
which I already have
that you're going to get a second shot
where we go maybe you're straight
I don't know we didn't bring this the
only camera we drop
waterproof camera that will try to use
this one as long we feel like it
that's not just earlier when we were
above looking at the river that's
exactly where we were looking
here it is guys the lower observation
down
okay guys we had to abort mission we got
over there and like the mist like all of
us suddenly consumed us so here as close
as you're you guys are probably gonna be
able to get
we're going to go a little closer in a
second I'll walk as close as I can
maybe it won't be missing as much
I think we're seeing
that's holy God
cool get it this is a tribute to when
they built this tunnel how they built it
this is crazy
he will flame on
I'm sure it's not helping up I would
anymore
behind
before we other side of
you
the right behind
what's that supposed to mean
sign said watch your step I was like
what's that supposed to mean
I kind of like saying the first steps of
doozie
this is like so exciting on the way down
we got down so fast right now
now we're going up and we've already
seen the fall so we're not as excited I
think really exciting
and it's uphill you like steady uphill
watch so uphill
I need to put benches on this thing if
the kid girls were here they'd be up
there oh yeah for sure
they must have put this up specifically
for Katie
so that she could learn the words I told
everybody that they put that up for you
so that you could learn the words I had
the words are pretty close Oh Canada Oh
Canada I wouldn't even do it fit what
we're about to eat dinner whatever in
the bottle of there now
by itself the islands called I
wait
and
you're you know 75
3:36
I just just like mere Australia moving
so there's our hotel right there I don't
know what your tower were actually in so
that means the fall the Falls are over
like that way right so hopefully we're
going to get around there whether it's
fall so coming right
yeah
we're trying to come to a where so that
the major extinction week or just we
just keep the Falls right there
and this is just one time we're gonna go
with the other side soon right horses
yeah this is the American side they call
it that's neat and like Katie was
pointing out earlier it's kind of neat
to see the river that it comes from like
how it comes down there and that's where
it's falling oh my gosh I hope you guys

fascinating look at that boat down there
that looks really scary oh my gosh does
