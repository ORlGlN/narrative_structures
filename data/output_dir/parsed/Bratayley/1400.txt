hi for makayley this evening is going to
be a very very special day or evening
because um
today is our cousin David's birthday and
you if you don't know yes then he is our
cousin and about six months ago he
passed away and um so
you would be turning 11 today so that's
why we're gonna do something that's very
special and so what we will do for this
first birthday is we are going to get
red yellow and blue balloons and release
them and why are we getting those colors
is because he likes Superman and those
match the Superman colors and then of
course we're going to get Superman socks
so we're gonna run to the store and get
those two things and then we're going to
release them and well at his home town
that the whole family over there and his
hometown is going to do a balloon
release and they're going to be like 200
people there it's going to be a mix
between like family and friends but of
course we couldn't make it because we
live way too far away but we will be
releasing at the exact same time so our
balloons will go up in the air the exact
same time and so they're going to send
some footage and then we're going to use
our footage to make a very special video
for David and so be like tuned for that

or out David would play with it and I
kept asking Kayla why don't you just
give Superman a David why don't you just
give Superman a David hmm Superman's
