all those is Phillips my goodness we
love our Philip um I like she wasn't
there such an inside joke Annika once my
know well I guess we're inside of rush
table or outside our home so that I can
update you anyways sounds good for the
day because we do that every night we
try we don't do it every night but we
try for your entertainment you've ruined
it for the Philips mom um so where's it
is well you rather do you rather go in
travel uh who's doing this me or you
okay God a hundred years in the past or
hundred years in the future
wait let me assume you want to go into
the future wait a hundred years or into
the path something that's already
happened something that already happened
a hundred oh then definitely future you
want to go to the future has happened
this entry that's exciting
Rory I mean gonna go on the path I mean
maybe maybe we make to redo my mistakes
that I have done oh you know but or in
the present but then she could do that
because she would move the timeline how
do you know
well then allows the awesome for
traveling in the past no I need a
quarter decision of going into the
future it's punch Oh Annie
thing is when you go in the past you
can't change anything that's gonna roll
it all the time traveling well I'm
breaking that rule you can't order you
ruin it and then everything you not be
there's everything or not wouldn't be
the same and it could open a transparent
universe and if you could chop you could
get lost in that transparent universe
and then you could leave it on I go I go
into the past and then if you if you
talk to anybody in that transparent
universe and give them your name since
there's a copy of you in that
transparent universe that means it's
somebody completely different
transparent means know what ashes
friends you can see through it
oh this fan does it transfer you said
transparent like 15 second dimensional
do know what dimensional means another
you lord
Oh sideways oh no no dimensional means
two things it's two sides two
dimensional means - yes what what is
three dimensional means three sides I am
so good at math - I'd say that you use
in the future
cuz I would like to know my
grandchildren we're going and my
children remember to comment on below
cuz we don't know the question today is
travel 100 years in the past or 100
years in the future
