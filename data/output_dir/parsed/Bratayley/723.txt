somebody might be a hundred easy know it
are you 30
it's not a classic oh they think I got
it okay wait wait died three times
there's other cameras oh my gosh they're
gonna get a close I think it's I think
it's live you guys I think they're all
sold out

you guys didn't know you're singing and
playing the drums - no one told you that
we incorporated you you're at the down
near the drums page you're on them right
now the equipment isn't quite the center
right okay you know you're going to be
on an Amiga we're gonna find out and
girls look see the two cameras they're
the center between those two cameras are
gonna be the center so when you're on
stage that's night away when there's
enemies I like that well just standing
here I know like well we should probably
ask first they're ready to go you want
some match those actually move over this

look for something on the wall again
those cameras or Center right you really
just speaker says got it
yeah perfect continue in a lock your net
formation
behind you the partner you go the
farther she has to go so you're setting
a tone on that okay if you feel and I
