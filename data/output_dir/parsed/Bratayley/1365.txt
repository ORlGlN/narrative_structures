today I'm Bailey that's probably why you
don't have any friends
hi for me
good morning everybody I am here with
good news and bad news just depends on
how you look at it the bad news or not
so good news or anyways is our flight
got canceled back home so yeah so we're
going to try to go there and go to a
different airline which that's like the
good news cuz our other airline didn't
have a TV and hopefully this one does
okay so we're heading to the airport to
see if we can get another airline and
then but if that gets cancelled then we
get another day in LA
oh that's what I'm hoping where's the
airport I'm gonna give you a little
update you guys know who our flight got
cancelled back well then we jumped on
another flight as I've told you before
and then this flight got delayed so
we're going to try to go to the gate and
there's a huge possibility that it might
get canceled
and we have to stay at LA for another
day anyways um we don't know why we
think that it's just some bad weather
over in the path or something but so
we're going to try to get on this plane
I hope it works if it doesn't I'm gonna
cry well I'm gonna fake cry as I want to
stay here okay then my mom's gonna think
I'm from oh hi
anyways I want to get home to see my
girl and your daddy and your Nani
and and your Aiden and your baby and
your dojo okay okay speaking of what
rich also you need to eat well let's
roll the clip to the girls at home this
is not springy okay all right Joe here
and we are going to listen to
and watched so we're not did you forget
the plan yes we're just coming to the
mall we're going to see million dollar
arm oh yeah
dork we're going to see million dollar
arm we're just at the lawn - Luis - but
now we have to wait to the mall open six
minutes no you can't go in there
because do you work here okay what I do
hold over on your arm ready - no I'm
going to open that door
everyone's gonna know she's a dork
come on Michelle in my kitchen
okay I showed her me and my friends and
she's scary
named Susan
snail okay no fish no it's a little fish
oh it's little bitch that's probably why
you don't have any friends because
you're head-butted them all
Oh date number three so as we said
before this flight was
connections light so I want to shuttle
bus
going to our serve airline
so
crazy
I'm going to so try to make it home
tonight because
we're still named la
la air and stuff
so
beginning cook already on us we're
beginning
two hours
we should have just spent the night here
I just texted daddy and he said
should've stayed the night and I said
yeah
hindsight's 20/20
that means like if you only get known
see perfectly when you already know
what's going to happen right if we had
known this was going to happen we would
have just stayed here for another night
and woke up and tried again in the
morning
here we are on a shuttle bus
well daddy's gonna have to sorry daddy
we will whine about that
now I've confirmed that these flight
this flight
the third airline and third flight
is running on time
do you think we're gonna make it home
tonight
or do you think these are going to get
delayed or canceled so flight 1 was
cancelled flight 2 was delayed so delay
that we were going to miss our
connecting so now we have a third
airline
this is getting confusing and we're
sitting here waiting on a shuttle bus to
take us to a different terminal in this
Airport
now what don't talk about the air
I'm just going to bet you right here in
our bags
I'd agree
guess what I was a new toothbrush you
