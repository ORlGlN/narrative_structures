hey so I don't 6 a.m. all right and my
coach I'd be they're going to start
using grips and I'm not a fan of my
buckle because they take too long to do
it and I don't feel time nothing to eat
something off but so I heard that there
there were these zebra velcro ones and I
heard that really good she's one of my
friends you see stuff and so we have to
measure my hair do this so what I mean
by that is I started using my grips but
then I I didn't do it because it was
starting to be meat season and now I'm
going to try them again but my coach is
going to teach me a new trick a trick
that will help me help us because my
whole team doesn't use grips only like
one person does but all my seams that
see is to think that they it make you
feel like you're gonna slip off the bar
the bar my coach says well I'm gonna
teach you a trick about it you got to
use your old grips and tell them till
these come in all right so we're
measuring from your middle finger your
longest one the base of your palm where
your palm and wrist meet me it's

wrong size and it looks like thank you
