drinks 48 doubled
well 48 50 and 50 100 so 96 yes you do
know there's another easy way
well tell me about it myself twelve look
that's the thing about it ten times
eight eighty and then you just double
that number so sixteen eighty plus 16
equals 96 okay I see how you did that
but that wasn't easier in my head
