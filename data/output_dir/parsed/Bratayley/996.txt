time for my TV so this is our morning
this is our kitchen we're having some
breakfast
I hope your bathrooms clean because they
just went up there we started bright and
early this morning I had all three kids
in bed with me because the banging
started about 7:00 Caleb was so thrilled
so we've been hanging out in the bedroom
and weird they got hungry so here we are
it got quiet though all of a sudden
because I just went up to Hailey's room
yeah open the fruit so we're having some
breakfast
what else is going on he already said
that a bit I mean that's it we're trying
to get used to the we're eating some
strawberry where I said we're trying to
get used to the hadn't been horrible a
nice if it's hot
it makes our it makes our kitchen look
really tiny with that up there can you
imagine this being so shut up there's a
wall here yeah well that we need a
bedroom table yes there would be enough
room for a bedroom so do you think we'll
be able to stay here the whole time that
they're doing all this work what happens
when I do the kitchen where we're going
to eat downstairs in the pool room where
the bar is oh my god we'll have to eat
like cereal for that day or two
sorry no toaster stuff and no eggs or
bacon what we can bring the food down
but I'm saying it's not good I could
have a toaster down there but where's I
don't have a refrigerator like our
freezer so it went out or a stove so we
couldn't there's water down there but it
would probably be like cereal fruit and
cereal because there's a refrigerator
down there a little one just not a
freezer okay as we as we decide what
we're doing right now I think we have a
little bit of time before the kitchen
