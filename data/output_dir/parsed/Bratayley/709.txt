her wearing and all of this I've
collected a whole thing or everything
around the house and I piled it here
from bathing suits to pajamas to
uniforms to shoes and Haley has got to
put her payal her part of the pile away
so instead of just picking them out like
a normal child would she's put them on
like the Haley child would so she's
wearing her mess you scare the snakes so
you're snuggling with Daddy is he
protecting you from the snakes snakes
they're talking about my name you're
showing you're not even showing snakes

funny okay and then Haley have you seen
this pile look at this guys this is how
Haley cleans it would be so much faster
if you would just take it up and sort it
upstairs oh my goodness you are
literally a mess you wear your mess

you'd be done by now if you would have
just gathered the clothes lay this just
shows how much stuff you've had
