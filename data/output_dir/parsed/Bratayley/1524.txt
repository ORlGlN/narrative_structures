sort of my turn to do so I can be awake
so yeah anyway so let's go to the
question of the day hyper tightly my
name is Chloe I'm 13 years old and I'm
from England and the question of the day
is watch Oh looking on that and one
lucky number and my lucky number is four
and my my number is seven so yeah bye
about my luckiest number would probably
be seven my unluckiest number would
probably be like 13 or 63 don't know
which one but one of those so see you
guys tomorrow
comment down below cuz we want to know
the question of the day is what is your
unluckiest number and watch our luckiest
number so see you bye see you tomorrow
my favorite number is a so teen a my and
my worst one is oh one really yes I
would totally think that should be
opposite well I well because typically
thirteen is unlucky I mean one I guess
isn't necessarily lucky but thirteen
supposed to be unlucky oh come on in
Piper like this table
you got your tea set out I bet your
American Girl dolls are enjoying it
Oh Molly and who else you have at this
table okay so she likes to scare Oh
Molly does wait what
don't know what's your name meet my name
is Elizabeth Elizabeth lioness wipes de
Lion lion head these are really pretty
and she likes the scattergram
who's she oh I'm not scared and two men
the Tin Man and what's her name
I've what today became Makenna Makenna
and Elizabeth and Molly yep
so now it's my turn to answer I'm really
tired
because while everybody else got to
enjoy and relax on it on this very um
busy evening and day I had to go to
gymnastics so I am exhausted so I'm
gonna answer the question of the day
which is what is your favorite number
and what is your least favorite is that
it all right so my favorite number is
probably either 5 or 7
it's either 5 because my birthday is
December fifth or because I did send
backhand from a beam at UM gymnastics
today by myself boohoo
and all the other reason is for 7 is
because Caleb's number is always 7 and
baseball so I don't know can't pick and
I don't really have a unlucky number
it's probably an odd number because
can't um divide it it unless you want to
get all the point things I don't know
how to do right now so probably like 109
or something
111 something like that so see ya Nick
don't forget to comment down below I'm
gonna know the question of the day YZ
what's your favorite number and watch my
favorite number
 baked potato baby thanks for
