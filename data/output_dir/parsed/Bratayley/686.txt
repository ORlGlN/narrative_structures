rare occasions where Annie already did
her hair at home to likud I had sandwich
Tim she woke up early this morning and
she had time to messy bun her hair well
that a musically or was that a like a
vogue basically mmm what song did you
have in your head when you just did that
quickly

last practice before your meet it's so
bizarre to say that in June that's not a
good feeling that no single bet all
right good night
do you feel better than eat about
yesterday so explain again just if you
score out of level eight does that mean
couch marries for sure gonna make you a
level nine or what's it mean no you
don't know I'm just trying to clarify
for the people watching I shall no not
definite that she's going to be double
nine it's just an option that she can
for train level nine exclusively and see
where she get anywhere so for every
where like what's the most sore part lay
tummy shoulders right we're warming up
or we're competing for competing she had
good warm up so let's see
