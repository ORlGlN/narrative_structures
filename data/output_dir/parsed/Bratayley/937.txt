nervous are you standing like a gymnast

second maybe that's what you should do
today and like a gymnast cuz that always
calmed your nerves isn't it like pretend
they're about this hope when you're
waiting for the judges Luo Tian the
judges so maybe when it's time to go in
Morimoto stay like a gymnast
hey guys my name is lysis cheese all my
channel TG comm / Alexis cheese all to
come up with username to the time
I really thought about it and this is
just the way for me I make primarily
comedy vlogs on my channel so I'll make
videos talking regularly you guys are
then intermix little cutaways and
sketches that have tell the story
hey what's up Mikey I make comedy vlogs
like a license and I'll repeat this um
sometimes are a little bit more awkward
though their format seems to be a little
bit smoother but yeah it's being high
though but I'm Ricky Dillon hello
and as you can see I'm responsible
enough to remember hearing said okay I'm
Caleb we do family loves and our
channels of daily am I asking if you
guys have any role models that you
either you know looked up to when you
first arrived into you or some of these
stone kind of feel inspired by I mean
right my
on YouTube because of my good friend
Shane I still like this ever
I've never heard of a Peter don't know
who that is actually babysit magic it's
entirely in German no when you started
off on YouTube I'm sure at least I
didn't cut most of you guys probably
didn't feel like you were look I'm a
modeler like you were really like when
you started out and we didn't foresee
this path and kind of realize the voice
in the reach that you now have so at
this point now that you are here now
that you have this kind of almost a
power but
you have this reach do you feel kind of
a responsibility to address certain
issues that come up in the community or
in your comments and if so how do you go
about doing that sensitively effectively
well we try to for you to comments this
closet possible so all of the negative
comments and we think they can have
their opinion but we're only responding
positive comments that's good that's
right yeah the longest I will youtube I
was just really happy baking videos just
kind of like for myself like a kind of
age 52 again these the videos even like
I've never done it did things like some
late we just be yourself kind of video
and then it's a couple years ago I
really really like actually use the
influence I had to actually use that
responsibility that upper hand so
tackling some real topics which is
incredibly dangerous to do if you don't
know what you're talking about which I
didn't sometimes made some mistakes
along the way but yeah I just always try
to make the videos but I think I needed
to hear turns out there
fortunes come in patroclus
role-model a few people actually asked
this one how does it make you feel like
is it scary or intimidating to know that
so many people now are kind of looking
to you as a role model sometimes it's
scary and sometimes it's the best thing
ever
there's like with anything there's
positives negatives but both mostly it's
really cool and it really turns me the
positive impact and talk about
passionate about good if you could
change one thing about your career what
would it be or do you have any regrets
about higher careers on we first started
off I don't know how much into account
when she was going through her terrible
twos and so our channel is literally
bright so we wouldn't never name that it
was going to get to any size we just
joking anyway so from that point you're
like probably shoulda done what is a
message one message that you want to
send to your
your viewers who might be struggling or
going through a tough time right now
everything is okay even if you don't
believe it or don't
everything will be fine I think that's
definitely I always to remind it's very
simple and it sounds it's just
my dad says I often tell people which is
as long as God has been making people
he's only made one of you and I think
about that all the time because I think
well Oh God has made so many people and
I'm the only Shana Malcolm who looks
like this and talks like this and all
the other comes you need to eat but so
it's like there's something we're so
uniquely special that we should forget
how it's special weekly chart
one of my favorite things I've ever seen
it's a goal in like a wall of my
classrooms um it was don't compare your
chapter one to so much chapter 20 mom
because a lot of times what you see I
mean we
their lives everyone has
if I had to pick one thing it would
actually probably be that it doesn't
always get a bonus to win all this
sometimes it gets better
not every situation classes not every
bad point in your life just goes away
you're right like this okay good team
like not every situation for some items
eventually not like not not like just
boys eventually go like oh then hat
enough sometimes it is down to you to
get and to become stronger because
sometimes life just kind of sucks so
sorry no apologies no regrets right all
right so that is unfortunately all this
right we have today thank you all so
