closing this off right here and moving
the refrigerator here and having that
more so then you'd come in the garage
this would be a mudroom type thing I
don't know this is the wall we're
thinking about taking out this wall then
the TV would go against that wall full
of a blackness the fireplace would stay
and ever like we'd have a couch here and
maybe two chairs here and
oh maybe taking that whole wall out and
that would be open okay baby
we're waiting on pricing okay but then
okay so you take so and then possibly
they put a little wall here move the
refrigerator here and then have more
cabinet space there so just that would
be gone this would be gone cut a fish or
