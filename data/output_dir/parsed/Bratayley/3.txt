week in science and another week in math
I'm gonna do the math tonight my dad I'm
also going to do some makeup because I
got new makeup and I want to try it out

Haley's bored she said we've been here
fern all morning and then she hasn't
filmed anything it was making your tired
look who's done with a week and a half
in every subject except for math because
she's waiting for her father to get back
she started what time about 10:30 or
11:00 and it's 5:30 I can't remember if
she got started at 10:30 or 11:00 this
morning but look she left her light on
out front a room and I made her go back
up and turn it off because we were there
so bad about leaving lights on around
the house and leaving stuff on the
stairs I should have made her versus the
rule is when she goes upstairs she
supposed to take something with her
oh that's just mmm I'm not gonna
complain too much because she cleaned
her room this morning now as a reward
for literally doing six-week hours of
school today she's going to do my makeup
because she had fun doing it last time a
week and a half in every subject that's
a lot if we could do that every day
you'd be done with seventh grade now it
would be it would be bad all right so
we're going to dig into my makeup and
we're going to just sit here and have
some bonding relaxation time so her
brain you know we just sit here and we
just talk and we're gonna just let our
brain or Annie's brain I helped a little
bit you have to admit I kept her
motivated while I did I folded laundry
all day so her brain is just gonna be
like I don't have to think about decomp
decomposers and what else have we
