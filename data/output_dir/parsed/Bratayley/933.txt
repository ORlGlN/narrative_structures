family what's what state would it be and
I was asked by typical Maddy I would
probably say Arizona because it is it
has a few cool things definitely Grand
Canyon that I like to visit and it's
just always hot there so in the
wintertime I bet it's not too cold or
it's freezing I don't really know a lot
about Arizona but if I lived there then
