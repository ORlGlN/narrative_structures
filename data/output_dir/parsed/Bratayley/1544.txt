today I'm poppy we think that our
phrasing
why L II why wait so Haley was here
mommy just picked me up from Olivia's
house and it's snowing it almost doing
their own that plans too
but it didn't so we're a little we were
a little behind but now we're back on
track right now we're heading over to my
grandma's house because she wanted to
take me to a play called Lyle the
crocodile
for my birthday because and I think it's
gonna be really cool because I haven't
really been to a play I've been to like
a school play and all those but I'm it's
gonna be really cool just checking off
but it's like yeah I'll miss the whole
family here
daddy's shopping Christmas shopping
never heard that in a while they're
gonna stay with that Papa and me Mommy
and Daddy my grandma are going senile
crocodile
so look how good the snow was coming
down now
are you dreaming of a white Christmas
okay did you get one
how's it taste right how's it taste
been worse the snowflakes earlier were
so big we should have filmed that we
first went in I thought for sure like we
after we ate we could catch some big
ones
all right ready write your name little
right Birds a li okay
Oh things that are phrasing y el e why
wait
Haley was here yep awesome now let's go
get the car it's freezing cut a zero off
in the picture
okay
imagine that your favorite character
being the star of the show
like really hard like rain right so rain
I guess
it's not snow
not sticking it just like
Sol's is
- break
and the girls are watching
he loves her
we're not getting
school
and I use matter that I wanted to help
for me pain but by helping mommy pain I
have to see my room so after the page is
all done I'm done
mm-hmm okay fellas outta my face
nothing you're almost too short all
right I'll get you some more paint you
move the ladder over to the left a
little bit I'm just yeah barely
probably I'm always scared to get too
much paint so
I'll be carrying the ceiling you think
you know we're gonna keep the ceiling
wired it's harder than it looks
I know and then you try it I guess I'm
the same way I don't get as much paint
on there behind you
my dad you take over no not done so I am
really excited Marianas I'm doing the
last bit till a blue paints of my wall
but before I finished I'm gonna say
goodbye so easier we're back from the
play and I thought it was really good
mommy's putting on the second coat of
paint enough I thought the play was
really good um I like it
he's awesome and it was snowing today
and it's not even winter yet so the
question that leads us into the question
of the day is what is your favorite kind
of doll really the question of the day
is what is like what Christmas present
do you want a dog don't forget to
comment down below cuz we wouldn't know
the question of the day it was the one
thing you want for christmas ah I am
crossing my fingers because today was
really snowy and really icy and we're
crossing our fingers to hope that
there's a two-hour delay for school I
hope there is some possibly Baker's I
wanted to know I want it to be icy so we
don't have to drive and then then I
don't have to go to school for two hours
I like this bed
you know it's mine right and you can't
have it it won't fit in your room no I'm
not talking about that I'm talking about
daddy oh not on the bed were you yelling
at your brother and sister during all
that yeah say goods why because they
don't pay attention to anything and
welcome to my life all I pay attention
to is paper
thanks for watching
