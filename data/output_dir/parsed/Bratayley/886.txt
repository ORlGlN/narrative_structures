that on the grant in the tracks it's
really sad a whole little burger no
you're not filming it'd be gross
we're off to make bratayley makes
history yes
bittersweet mostly first of all without
caleb so for the most part we decided to
keep going yes we decided to keep going
cuz we thought that i'm like cutting
half my face off there we go because we
think that he would have wanted us to
and it's a series so one of my fears was
that if we don't finish it that it's
just not gonna have her right and we'd
never get to see that awesome footage
well you know what he was with us so
don't worry he's he we've got the
picture frame and he'll be with us in
picture and in spirit and the girls went
with Nani to go get something to eat so
we thought we'd take a second to explain
why we decided to keep doing yeah they
need to go get snacks but edit okay
we'll see you on the train
okay so we just got word we're not on
the train yet clearly but we just heard
a train speed non-stop speed trains
gonna come and Annie got this back and
this is her protection
