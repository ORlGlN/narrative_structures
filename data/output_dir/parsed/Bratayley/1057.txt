okay not for them you hate the camera
okay I got to do this
oh stop what did we land on pet an
armadillo or a porcupine armadillo why
not gonna hurt you
well if the porcupine isn't scared and
you just get to feel what it feels like
that's for you what if I hit poke to you
what about it won't it over anyways I
pick armadillo just because I would
think if I feel really smooth and I
don't know
yeah don't forget to comment on lock's
we know this March today is an armadillo
or a Porsche guy I hate you tomorrow
oh you guys so long time to go someday
it goes have already down the question
today and - how's it oh oh it scared oh
your cart mmm did you come on Piper
you're fun yeah okay yeah good bye
okay I overlooked her anyways um anyways
so you guys know the rest of the day it
is would you rather pet a porcupine or
an armadillo and I just say an armadillo
I don't know why but um just just gotta
say Hamid Oh would probably better to
pet I don't know I really don't know
because I mean I don't know much about
the armadillo how much drop this on me
um yeah so that's why I have to say on
the Deauville watch it feel like
something worse than a porcupine but I
don't know much about at all I mean like
porcupines you hear stories about mama
Della's are just like Texas no I'm just
kidding
um so yeah that's what I think I wore
Manila though I do think out of Texas I
don't know why it just do hand spray
this because why not opening it with one
hand in your face I would never do that
um so yeah that's my answer so anyways
remember to come down below cuz we're
gonna know thirst of the day is
would you rather pet a pine or an
armadillo show you guys tomorrow
