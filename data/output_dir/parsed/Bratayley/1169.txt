them to light up my MA Oh mine your boy
how's that working for you good like a
minute to get on this Maggie I can just
feel it Eddie you know what was I doing
right what nothing I can say it's gross
what I'm thinking yeah
looks like she's concentrating on
turning a light off get that light off
yet no I watched him she can jet hit it
note that is way out there so earlier
today the kids other two kids and I were
filming at the house and I realize it
was a video a whole video about a lot of
nothing
lots of minutes of a lot of nothing and
I think we've continued that trend today
I can't turn the light off
oh I've got a good idea
time to put my hand and medicine dish on
and you got it from Whole Foods
I'm really scared it's gonna sting
really bad you're never sure it's gonna
sting I said it may sting a little
okay cuz rolled on without her here we
go now it's Duggan coming
how much do I put on that's crazy way
satanic it will look weird if she waste
it what if you wish it will look weird
yeah P waste it'll look weird so bad
it's not a rumor it's like a really Bal
trip to bubble gum dust problems
hmm well apparently this is a secret
weapon this powder again this is gonna
sting right this I don't know here wait
I can get my eye my fingers this you
calling my fingers fat no no how much
better if you just sprinkle it on top so
hard to get out there you go that's a
smart idea that's why you have me around
your listing okay we got it
okay hurts when you put it on like nap
oh and I her okay good you think it's
gonna be healed up in the morning
hopefully it will be worth it
DeVoe sting on the eighth I don't know
wonder how they're gonna look and feel
in the morning think we'll remember to
film about it I don't know whatever
like it hurts okay so now that I've
calmed down from my yeah you know Brett
Angelo being no better just learn to not
move it but kind of let let air get to
it or discuss today it's gonna be from
our box that's goal Mackin girl

dream over and over
