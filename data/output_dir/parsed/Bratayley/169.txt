I've been there in so long and because I
feel like the last time I was there we
did a mean greet they're not like a long
time ago for going with mom to be so
much fun I really wanted to--and I'm
hoping that there sure isn't because I'm
really excited so that's what we're
doing well watch out mommy make me mad
like an IRA let you know
gosh
huh
use it now well
you say that and Riley told me that when
you yawn you're either tired or bored
because you start breathing slowly and
every time so everything slowly you yawn
because your air if it was your brain
and your everything in your body needs
more air so it yawns to get a bunch of
air and then you keep breathing slowly
and you got horn are you doing I was
always scared to yawn when I was in my
actual school night like public school
because I was scared it's gonna make
like one of those weird noises that's
like really embarrassing when I do that
so I would just like try to water then
oh my gosh
trying to want to sneeze in is so hard
I've been did you know if you sneeze
with your eyes open your eyes can pop
out of the children as well
daddy

keep your eyes open yeah that's that
