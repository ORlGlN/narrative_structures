conditioner is putting your that water
on the floor we have to get our
air conditioner fixed and that's why I'm
over here so that someone can come look
at it look at Kayla's room that click or
follow me over here once that right
is empty
so it's scary an empty house but I'll
show you one room that's not empty
because she's getting newer stuff
because this is from when she was really
little
hey these beds finally going by so her
room actually looks like it's still all
there
this is Annie's room after a storm all
you think the new owners would want that
a there we could leave that air there
for them
he's horse picture we still have to get
here's a secret of the bratayley house
you guys probably didn't know when mommy
and daddy were painting this room we
spilt paint on the carpet Oh what that
you never knew we're going to leave that
there we're going to put a carpet over
it may be the new owners won't know so
guys we're at the old house
and the air conditioner is broken and it
leaked all over so the air conditioner

pull up all the carpet well that was the
basement that got ruined this carpet was
old and getting replaced anyway but then
the water leaked on it so it's hot in

hopefully he can fix it and turn the air
back on and then Caleb is gonna lose his
delt muscles he's gonna use oh these big
muscles I mean look how dandy he's gonna
use those muscles to pull up carpet
