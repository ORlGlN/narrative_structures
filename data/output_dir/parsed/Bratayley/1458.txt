then my tournament over fear was for all
around and then the rest middle so I
placed in every fence and looting all
around okay what happened on that one
you didn't start your swing until the
ball was already to you as soon as he
lets it go start to swing your hands
have to mediate your hands have to be
together finding those knuckles up and
as soon as he lets go of the ball that's
when you start to swing
they're good you're on that one now
watch the ball hit the bat you're you've
got a timing now now watch the ball hit
the bat skewed that way a little bit
just a go right there yeah you're
spinning around there's no way you're
watching the ball yeah you can't you
can't swing with your eyes closed you
gotta be able to see the ball to hit it
that's out caleb hits every down good
yeah probably
see he waited till the ball got there
you spent too much time watching it not
enough time swinging at it
I love why wrong hand
yeah top okay go

one and 50 what that's not good either
right in the old way Laos okay sorry

typical Pitzer just figured out you can
do fall on your booty good job

booty following follower honor so it
talks when you bend your legs
