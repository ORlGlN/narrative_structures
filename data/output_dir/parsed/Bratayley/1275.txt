our two choppers right here but smaller

Matt a big like soft and squishy yeah
that's what I wrote video um and then I
went cold in it and it was well but you
tallest girls we're putting their hands
like this and the two smallest girls
went up like like they're on their hands
and how to go up stand up on the blocks
reach up save their person wait till the
other person comes up and slide down the
rope and then it kept doing that but
they got trickier at the
and because someone had to pull the last
person up without the tower or wobbling
cuz it was really understand the study
was so scary and then and then they had
to reach up and grab it it was scary and
then we had to put fire up how did you
