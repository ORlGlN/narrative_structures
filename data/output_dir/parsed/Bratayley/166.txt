moment right now let's go see her a
moment

on and this is how far we've gotten all
right so we're getting ready to go
adventuring what else no we're just
kidding our adventure is gonna consist
of sightseeing possibly like the holiest
site seen star Walk of Fame whatever it
whatever that is for the stars on the
ground in Hollywood and that's really
only a only thing on the agenda
we're gonna go to Beverly but when I go
to Beverly Hills but I don't know how to
get there oh it's called a GPS that's
how I get everywhere but like parking
makes me nervous
no movers are expensive I know that's
what Paige has had a good point where do
we park in Hollywood only time we
usually go to Hollywood is we're staying
in Hollywood I don't know where to park
you guys I'm saying if you're not
familiar with LA it's the parking liked
well I'm sure other cities too like
street parking makes me nervous I like
driving to a store and there's a big
parking lot and you just park your car
and you go into the store
all right right but here it's either
street parking or you find a garage and
my foot is hurting and while he's in
space and I'm limping and it's not good
and look how cute page list page is like
