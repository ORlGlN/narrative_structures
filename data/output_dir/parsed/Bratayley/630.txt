why they call it pink eye for short so I
have money questions for you hey how
much do you think a car cost
how much do you think achieving us can I
get the tea because half as much the car
okay finishing in your bed cost and
around 300-400 a bad cost about as much
of the car really that's what your oh oh
that's right and so how much do you
think a meal at a restaurant cause I
just for you and 30 or 20 30 or 20 okay
what about a candy bar this silver tin
dog game DeMarcos $10 I guess so
cars are thousands of dollars Oh
beds are only usually a few hundred
dollars
TVs are probably $1,000 or so and a
candy bar cost about $1 what yeah and a
meal your meals at a restaurant only
cost about 9 bucks
good food in cars
so you're way high on till whale oh I
feel so bad no how much do you think a a
drink at a restaurant cause I got just a
drink I get like a bounce beat like two
dollars yeah that's good let's go hey
let's that's probably close to Don
Franklin so now that you have a
reference for things cars cost and when
I say thousand I mean thousands and
thousands thousands no like way more
than that like four thousand 10,000
20,000 30,000 like that guy okay now
