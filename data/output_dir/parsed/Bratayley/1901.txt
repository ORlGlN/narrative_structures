median was your weary soul to rest

drive down the road throw the money out
the window please oh yeah our window in
Dhaka is that smart to do throw money

smart yeah no we're not throwing real
money out the window
oh and so that means we're going to
gymnastics today oh you really don't
want to go oh well then we just won't
sign up again okay right when we were
about to walk through the door there was
construction work
and we could we could go into our house
but there they shut down the bathroom so
we couldn't wash our hand
we couldn't flush the toilet so we're
just gonna hang out at the store
they're cutting our sewage in our water
lines right now so probably not a good
idea to go in there and someone said I
have to go to the bathroom and then go
somewhere just to go to the back to my
cell
we're just gonna hang out a store for
three minutes or an hour until they um
put it back up so yeah and we are theirs
we'll see you're inside the store okay
so usually we get up snack but this is
work is only came here to eat because
they're doing construction yeah
so you ended up getting subway for a
snack is wheel cradles Pringles are a
real snack this is why our toilets are
messed up this'll mean we have to part
oh look your way down there they're
digging a poor yard look at the holes
