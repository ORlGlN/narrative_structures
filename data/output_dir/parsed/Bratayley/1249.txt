your baby's growing up well that a lady
switch with daddy to sit with a knee and
a lady switched with mommy just so I
could say with Hailey we're all spread
out on the whole plane and those nice
people helped us
but they end with a little excess no
nice usual healthcare Oh what do you
mean they did other people good what
remember switch see it yeah they were
being very nice Caleb didn't find any
nice people to switch for us though I
told him my best advice was just could
he had the middle seat next to two
strangers I said Caleb just look at him
and say I'm gonna take a little nap mind
