I counted at 45 he's turning out the
lights I'm gonna get scared when he
finds me this time okay yeah if you're
wondering where Hayley unpaid went they
went to go get something to eat they
haven't eaten yet
okay guys so we are in bed because it's
freezing so undercover so really that
tired but we're gonna lay here watch
some TV and go to sleep so here's what
the question of the day is
would you rather shower in the morning
or at night I would definitely rather in
the morning line one because it will
wake me up too because I don't know
three because it feels good in the
morning and the reason I don't I get it
the night at night because when I am
ready to go to bed I'm ready to go to
bed and I don't want to be wet right
before I go to bed cuz and I have to
away from my hair to dry so yeah your
tie would have to say at night because I
like to go in the bed clean and then I
am normally late at night anyway so I
might as well shower at night and I
don't like getting up in the morning for
anything so yeah there you heard it and
don't freak out and another question
today is
rather shower at night or in the morning
roll eclipta hailey Oh buy from us bro
hello my name Haley and I'm tired and
the question of the day is do you like
taking baths in the morning or in the
night is that it is that it yeah I like
taking them in the morning so yeah don't
forget to comment down below cuz me you
want to know the question of the day is
would you rather take it back in the
morning or the night sure now they're
all in bed pages on the phone good night
always remember to celebrate
