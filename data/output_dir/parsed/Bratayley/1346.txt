buy one more trip I don't have to top
your sad little a little issue oh you
taught the shortest road trip but it's
just trying to far but it's kind of not
so I don't know good or bad but anyway
it's why that's a lie
we are headed to Caleb's baseball
tournament and he win with one of his
friends so you wouldn't be late and we
didn't have to get him dressed him in
the morning he made it sound like we
actually like his pants on for entitles
use of up he can't tie is our he
can it wasn't so him he just was until
like a year ago where he could actually
lay some up really well that
and I'm all caught all up within this
like the uber blanket that I got from
Cindy's birthday party right it was her
birthday party
everyone got like this really cool
blanket some people not like a cheetah
blanket or I like splatter blanket I
wanted one of those then they're all
gone
anyways well yeah I'm getting so
off-topic anyways hey - and hey they're
sleeping
forget it
Hailee's boring mommy and I hang out in
the car listening to some radio songs
and sing along
Oh
I don't even know what it is
okay see you later we just got back and
we're at the hotel right now and Caleb
won the game I'm sorry I wasn't really
that Pacific Pacific but we just got
back from um his game

gonna have two tomorrow but we just got
back from his game day 122 eight - right

on it I'm gonna give you a tour of the
hotel okay so my mom and a bathroom I
just booked it let's pretend you got a
bathroom you got the sink you got all
the stuff into the figure but email is
it you got whatever this is um you got
to bed you got this like a little stool
thing my god you got a mirror you
another bed you got a mess drawer desk
within a long walk it around and then
you have some drawers with some stuff I
don't know
no Iowa up I think no QB not Scott hit
hit hit hit a TV and then you got a
little desk area no another lamp and
then a chair and then some air
conditioning and then display down thing
just in case oh my own bed and another
lamp and two more lamps I guess there's
no light and let's see how the light is
is in hairs all the way up on on on on
on
on okay we're gonna see if this is a
lamp on and then that one's already on
Haley do you need help
