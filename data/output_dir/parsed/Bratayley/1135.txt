ah Hale is getting mad at me and that

mirror mode oh my god hello beautiful
light child's come to the end of the day
and he's still not home
um so I'm gonna do the question of the
day because and this kind of falls into
how boring this day's been no it's been
a really boring day and so the question
today is what do you do on boring days
I've got to say what I do is watch like
television shows on Netflix and stuff
comment down below Kazuma and other
today is what are you doing a boring day
make it less boring so but shift and you
can use like whatever fabric that you
have Haley fell asleep watching to the
age she's out watchin videos like a
light Haley the question of the day is
what do you do on a boring day Oh sleep
okay good answer
let's take classes off yeah this is like
super weird I don't know how the kids do
this every day to look into a lens and
film yourself like I loo so I don't know
I decided to film myself tonight just I
don't know for the fun of it we might
not use us um but so along with the
question the day one of the most fun
things to do for all you parents out
there on a boring day is just hang out
with your kids
they're super funny and they'll make you
think about stuff you didn't think you
would ever think about so not to not to
set anybody up for failure
parenting is not easy but it can be fun
a lot of the time so uh yeah this is a
weird thing equipment the day
what are you doing boring days but today
I didn't have a boring day but what I
would usually do is I would watch TV and
try to go to sleep or sometimes like
build a fort or planner girl does I can
do a lot of things so don't forget to
come down below cuz we wouldn't have
question today is what do you do on
boring days bye see you tomorrow
