what you're witnessing right now is a
child who can't go home because they are
sanding the house and we were asked to
not be there today so here's the
situation
we've got Haley hanging out in a parked
car at Annie's gym where we just dropped
her off but we're not hanging out in the
gym because I am editing yeah I won't
leave Earth day to be here and Haley
wants it to be her birthday but besides
that because it's not her birthday
there's a little secret back here don't
look at me oh you knew we were filming I
thought you were asleep
being so loud and Caleb was up late last
night and we had to come to early
morning practice so he's decided to curl
himself every morning trust not you you
didn't have to go to early marriage back
to us hey it's not really fun talking to
somebody I get see where are you Oh
Caleb curled himself up in the back and
is taking a nap and Haley's doing
headstands and this is the life that we
lead while our house is a construction
zone it's very glamorous
we hang out in cars we edit we do
headstands and we sleep well Annie does
gym guys but yeah it's healthy living on
the on the real side of that it stinks
