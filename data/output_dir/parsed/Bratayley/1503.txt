busy first we built a fort and now we're
gonna play a little game it's called
boom boom balloon so here's how it works
there's a die in a bunch of these sticks
Hey do not put it in yet we are not
playing so you roll the dice and look so
I roll the dice and I got a two so I
would either put in two of these in one
of the holes or I would put one in and
click two times you just have to click
two times so when you put it in it's
gonna go click it's gonna click yeah so
the object of the game is to not pop the
balloon whoever pops the balloon is out
okay Haley how do you feel about this
game like cuz I know you don't like to
pop balloons at all
and you think it's gonna pop on your
turn when when I say hit the deck I'm
not kidding okay mommy's going first

more all right chalo three doesn't have
to be one stick you can do multiple
sticks once we're at a stick click yep
