time for my daily mechanical pencil
problems
Haley's writin with a mechanical pencil
yeah and that keeps breaking she's not
used to it
so we're at the gym Haley didn't finish
her worksheets from yesterday so we
figured I could watch a little
gymnastics and it's at Annie's gymnastic
since I haven't watched in a while and
Haley could catch up before we go home
and start day 120 right this is day 119
but you know you're on day 119 from
yesterday excuse me you are Tim Moore
today what are you talking about I
gained lesson 10 now you're not look I
can prove it
okay this was lesson 119 and as soon as
it focuses one nine one one nine is 199
1100 and not one hundred and 1112 do you
need to go back to pre-k so you can
learn - what comes after mommy I was
1108 and now
that is not 1109 that is 119 says 11
yes but you're looking in the wrong spot
that's a hundred because there's three
places 119 whatever have you been
confused all these days ah lemon finger
yeah no I mean Haggard no that is
incorrect my friend so let's continue
writing your spelling words until we can
explain that a little bit better okay
