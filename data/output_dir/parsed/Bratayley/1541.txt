right so this week it's been a crazy
week especially with Piper chewing up
that bird you haven't seen that video

reason why this week was so crazy is
because there was all the snow the
weather and we had a two-hour delay and
then the next day we had it off and then
now we have a bull and this morning we
had
concert so it was just crazy
we found a shout-out video we had fun in
the snow and all of that so yeah and
it's a beautiful day out and we're going
to cat all right now I have a little
snack
and today was my violin concert it's my
winter strings concert and I did it two
times for the can you take it once for
the kindergarten first and second grade
and another time for them third fourth
of thing and I thought it was really
cool because I got to see the other
people play twice and there was a little
surprise at the end and I see it twice
