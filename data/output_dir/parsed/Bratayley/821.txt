time for look Haley we have some pretty
sad kids this morning because when we
daddy and I were trying to make all the
arrangements like we already changed the
flights to go out to LA and we were
getting a hotel which was probably in
the wrong order
but lessons learned we never thought
that there would be a problem getting a
hotel but there's a Star Wars half
marathon at Disney and so the kids just
found out that we're not going to
Disneyland you could run the marathon
it's too late to even sign up I'm pretty
sure and you know it's a half marathon I
gave you it was just like jumping and
Pleasant there's no rooms to stay in
that was the issue
so he's fist we fill wouldn't have
anywhere to say just jump in the
marathon I sleep on the road just like
like in pennsylvaniaÂ´s out where we
were yeah well is what people are like
all inside right so I can they just they
don't have a shoe don't wear they don't
have that you don't have one of those
they will kick you out like you can't do
that alone so we're them to raise money
yeah so we're going to go get a rental
car and drive the rest of the way home
and hopefully not be sad too much longer
we're very very sorry that that happened
we will try to it was a good it was such
a fun moment like okay yeah we'll go to
Disneyland sure you you know but that's
why you need a little bit more time than
24 hours to plan a trip like that this
is why I mean but we should have invited
John G to our health yeah that's how
this all started
we were trying to jot we knew John G was
staying one more night here before he
got on LA and the girls were trying I
don't know if they explained us they
were trying to convince him to come to
our house for the night and he's like
whoa why don't you just kind of come out

excited them guys like okay and we
started trying to make plans to go out
to LA and then all right hotel out
