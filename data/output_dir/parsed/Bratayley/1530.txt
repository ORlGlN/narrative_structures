since my mom's not here we're gonna go
eat eat some Asian food so she doesn't
like Asian or at all buffet she doesn't
like anybody going to an Asian buffet
right so we're gonna try a new one
though we've never tried before we have
try like one or two but so we're gonna
try this one so we're gonna see all this
and Hayley's asleep and we were trying
to wake her up but she's like in a deep
sleep her eyes were open so I'm pretty
sure she's awake hey he's just she never
wakes up tents carrier in the car that's
a mommy nice boy hey hey come on Piper
you hungry I made some digging so the
place we go to is sadly
we think for good but it could just be
because it's almost Christmas
barbecue which also doesn't like
so we're doing things that my mom
doesn't like because she's not here
we can do without her
pouches it's pretty cool
see those helmets up there that's Army
Navy Marine Corps Air Force
oh no no they don't that's just the
other Navy helmet they probably did that
because the Marine Corps doesn't have a
whole ball team
so that's Army Navy Navy Air Force only
because the Navy's twice as good as the
other services
like that helmet more I think that's the
newer one
