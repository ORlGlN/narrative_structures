cutoff so we're heading out early our
whole group still back there we were
cold and scared couldn't make it to the
rides you wanted to get you cuz they
were scary clowns chainsaw chainsaw
I hate clowns period either they're not
scary so we're gonna get in the warm car
and we're gonna go head home and we're
gonna watch funny shows all comedies
here no cuz we're not gonna have
nightmares cuz we're gonna watch funny
shows we're gonna forget his happens but
I would like to say that Kayla would
have had a blast there would have had a
watch so he will wore that mask again so
he'd have been part of the festivities I
did it for him look what came
I had to get a plastic ready to be a
cowgirl now maybe a cowgirl now there
you go get dressed for bed put it up
here with make sure the dogs can't get
it Tom Prakash names too scary that
we're coming cool and remember times was
good dude one day witches would you
rather buy a dragon or a giant octopus
mine is Jagan because the giant octopus
you could like have one arm with the
other arm would like swimming back so
you'd rather fight a dragon mm-hmm me
too you never said a fire-breathing
dragon
yes never said fire I'd be nice little
ki dragon
I would rather fight a dragon do you
want to know why why because I think
that you could have a giant octopus
because it would just be an octopus that
was really big and so those are real and
a dragon is fake and I feel like there's
way cooler fake weapons to fight a
dragon then there are real weapons to
fight an octopus it's like finish the
dragon yes ah this is all fictional I
really wish we had that weapon all right
so don't forget to calm down below you
wanna know the question today is would
you rather fight a dragon
oh don't then let's watch TV
something not scary bye bye
baked potato baked potato baby
thanks for watching
