time for my daily rise and shine oh yeah
if a steak goes down its I did not see
steak on the breakfast morning of our
practice breakfast in bed
ooh look how pretty it is out guys nice
oh wow that got her oh not a big balcony
it's warmer outside than it is inside we
turn we had to turn the air down it was
cold when we woke up my what
yeah merica get your stuff together

there she is what a way to wake up in
the morning round around going yeah we
got round coins can they do that here
give you bohemian money as change when

spend back in the US of days this little
one didn't think it would be a fun to
wake up to breakfast in bed where's the
steak when we're in LA we ordered steak
for Katie every morning we had steak for
breakfast we had steak for lunch all
right I got to get these gorillas ready
for their first practice their only
practice but it's very important we'll
see you guys later
whoa it's like really raining
and then I thought my head and it's in
stores is it did it rain last year while
we were here
can't remember Wow
hopefully it's gonna pass through pretty
darn sunny over there Wow yeah all right
you guys ready to go to practice that is
the million dollar question she's done
gonna stop right
it already stopped that's barely
drizzling how about me all the time
so the vault tape with the measuring
tape would take the wrong way so Mary
went to go get a fit but she didn't want
someone to come take the runway because
she's like hey don't lose the runway and
they all flop down and like poses
and we're done with practice it sound
like a very hot you know I think that
means the meats gonna be amazing
that's how I feel about it we're gonna
go find something to eat now okay are
you complaining about the heat yeah yeah
it's pretty cold inside I have to hide
everyone everything cuz I'd like my hot
line media children probably timers to
so you could practice like in a meet
setting kind of like on different
equipment is probably good to do some of
that look this is a travesty people
she's throwing ice cream away how dare
her just to eat a cone how dare you so
the girls were told by their gymnastics
coach today that they couldn't go
outside oh she said that we could go I
said we could go to the pool for an hour
at the most
and there's like no other so apparently
according to the parents she they were
told that they could be outside for an
hour no those are the words that were
used and they were already outside for
an hour where did you eat Oh hide
outside under an umbrella anyways where
did you where did you eat your ice cream
outside they can't find anything inside
to do because it's the homeless they got
everything bad everything's based off
being outside so do you guys want to at
least go walk in the day look at the
aquarium
