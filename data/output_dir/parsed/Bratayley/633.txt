through it and get like we haven't done
this in a while get a bag of donations a
donation bag
I'm gonna trash a donation sale I've
always thought of that remember a long
time ago when I probably mentioned that
where I was gonna like sell it and
donate the proceeds but sometimes it's
just easier to just donate the stuff to
like the Salvation Army and then that
it's like a an organization that donates
people in need who don't like they might
not have some stuff that they need or
toys or toys yeah people recycle because
like someone gets like that recycle
think recycling is where it can be
remade yeah hmm Horace do like they can
make something yeah they can make
something out of it or make something
again or can just be reused if you yeah
like we don't throw away like Target or
Walmart bags like or grocery bags out of
plastic ones I reuse them for things or
you can buy ones that are more like that
last longer and take them with you I've
never done that I should do that that's
better for the environment so I can't
see yeah
