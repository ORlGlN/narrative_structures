favorite quote from frozen

we know don't say hairy-looking donkey
thing over there that's been Oh in the
reindeer that's men
oh that makes it a lot easier for me I
like that one part that part there Caleb
which are below welcome to the
conversation favorite quote from frozen
it's really not that hard you'll be okay
well I was going to say my favorite one
with hey you're just talking about you
good things good thing the next question
is the next here's how it goes
I'm super I think we lost the monster I
think the girls could probably act the
movie out what was your other one so
happen was uh there's these things
called carpet sliders and there was two
of them and so I put my feet on the two
and I had to hold on to this rope and
the Rope was um not really tied on just
wrapped around them and they had to pull
me and I kind of fell off of the thing
and I got a human
and in this problem yeah cuz I have some
on my hand
it's your favorite kind - Caleb want
some yes this is Caleb's favorite kind
of lotion everytime he smells it well
and Hayley's everytime he smells it he
flips out and wants some it smells
really good it's from Bath & Body Works
so that means it's yours yeah according
to Mary Kate when she puts her lips on
the pizza nose a drink no it was a piece
of pizza that was a drink company might
have been a cupcake is either a cupcake
or a piece of because a piece of beef
might have been a it might have been a
cup drink pizza we invited her cousins
over to our house and we ate dinner with
them since / when we were back then so
we were having you're celebrating some
B's birthday yeah I think I think it was
pizza though and then we had cupcakes
later that but anyways so we had some
food celebrating something and Mary Kate
um took some let's just say was pizza
yeah and put her lips on it and then and
somebody tried to take the pizza because
she just left it on the counter to go
somewhere and she came back in and she
saw that her that her pizza wasn't there
and somebody else had and she said no
it's mine I put my lips on it I think
the funny part was though that she
didn't necessarily like take the pizza
and like kiss it or put her lips on it
she I think she meant that she'd I don't
know what she meant
I think you like literally put her lips
on it so no one would touch it or you
took a bite of it maybe she was gonna
take a bite out of it oh I can see your
camera in the reflection of my beautiful
face oh grandma you have a grandma we
don't slap any part of anybody
