today I'm poppy we approaching a fridge
so be careful not to fall out hi for my
candy hello everyone so yesterday all of
our cousins left so sad that we're all
alone but our grandparents are going a
to take us to the aquarium so we're all
just getting ready for the day are you
going me hmm this is awkward
very awkward
Seto Caleb mommy's doing cats hair I
didn't plan and no Ted helps he didn't
see me filming enemy yes is very boring
so CLI time play hockey
if if you would please stop talking like
that
be ready to see some sharks
Oh
that's how we can see
keep your hands feet
farms inside
the whole dance
you're scared
sharks are an important component of the
undersea world they are the number one
predator that swims in the ocean and
helps maintain a delicate balance in
marine life unfortunately they are not
the number one manager out of the ocean
we are and the overfishing of sharks
specifically shark finning
is seriously depleting their populations
to the historic center and Water Works
building this turn-of-the-century
building is down to two hundred thousand
gallons of seawater the tunnel
is approximately 70 feet long and the
acrylic is over 5 inches thick
supporting more than 700 tons of water
directly over your head
there are over 20 different sharks
swimming around us the largest of the
Sharks aqc is the sand tiger shark these
sharks are ten feet long and weigh over
250 pounds they are found worldwide and
are identified
of sharp teeth there are several species
of sharks that are smaller yet every bit
is dangerous and the vasila black tip
shark is easily identifiable by the
they're very aggressive and hunted
pass-along reefs a ton they can reach
six feet in length
our brown sharks the brown shark that
you see here are approximately 5 to 7
feet in length and are the most
aggressive eaters in the exhibit
it is a common misconception that sharks
need to constantly move however you may
notice several charge resting on the
bottom of the exhibit
they are nurse sharks and the
beautifully mark Australian zebra shark
both of which spend the majority of
their time on the ocean floor
'never VR sharks while divers are in the
water it would be far too dangerous even
with the chainmail suits our divers wear
the brown and sand tiger sharks have a
dumb power in their jaws to crush a
person's arm or leg sharks are
fascinating animals it is amazing how
adaptive they are and any of you heard
about the great white shark that escaped
from our shark tank during the last
our scientific staff I searched trying
to recapture it it was never found so
keep a lookout as we travel through the
park
Wow look at this it looks like the great
white may have spent some time around
