hi for me hmm any guesses as to why
Annie is having the space that she has
on this first day of spring any guesses
all right times up talabani
yep that's right it's snowing and
something else I just noticed all the
toys are left out now yep
backyard so I wonder if those are gonna
work how why is it snowing it's spring
the birds are supposed to be chirping
the flowers are must be blooming no
another not because they're not oh my
goodness we just crawled out of bed and
I took this oh yeah and he did take a
bath now Haley then you gotta get this
day started last day of gymnastics
practice before any state meet last
level-7 meet the season how do you feel
tell us how you feel
talking to my fake microphone huh how do
you feel about your state meet being
tomorrow tired that's not a good do you
feel prepared yeah yeah yeah okay I got
15 to keep yesterday 15 tickets I did I
wager 10 for beam and side for bar how
does that work so if you mate so you
later ten if you wait you're ten ten is
the highest you can go and if you wager
ten is you fall on the beam between you
two double that so I would have to 20
but I didn't fall so yeh but so you get
10 seconds if you don't fall don't
forget whatever number you wager so it's
like a pressure routine do you feel more
nervous when you're wagering or at a
meet is that the same kind of pressure
you feel so you think it's a good thing
that Coach Mary came up with
