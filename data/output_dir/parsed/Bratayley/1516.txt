Negros so like I said yesterday I got
the American total of the year with my
own money and I was playing you sir and
then we found these extensions it's my
day off so I'm playing with her and I'm
gonna put I'm gonna try to find out how
to put these extinctions and it says so
this is Isabel and she has extension we
didn't think that she came with
extension because we didn't see them
three gosh so he thought she we had to
order them yeah like it didn't come with
her cell
then we found them so yeah so if you
order Isabel
make sure you trust the side of the box
because extinctions are in man okay
I mean Yvonne's up I'm gonna take these
off I got them for Christmas sir fake
clip-on not clip-on but then you put
them on your nails not me I'll polish
and they get stuck to everything yes so
and take them off so the first step is
to find looks they're a little hard to
find but we found them they're under her
hair hidden so you can't see them there
is one two three of them and I will just
put them into the
like so cool okay you may need a little
help from your parents you need to just
said this is wait this is complicated
