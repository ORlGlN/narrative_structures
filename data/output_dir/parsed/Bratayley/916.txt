have you felt that every time you left a
colony you really visit my favorite
was your least favorite
do we need to name them so you can
remember where we've been where we been
we've been to Maryland Delaware New
Jersey Boston New York I miss one New
Hampshire the Boston Massachusetts sorry
New York was really boring Fraunces
Tavern was boring
yeah was ya know I would say New
Hampshire's we went in mental
politicians in the United we go say
everything every colony we've had don't
do it had something that I'm like I
don't know that was pretty cool yeah
tradition so now we talk this out it
sounds like every colony was freaking
awesome yeah you agree
way to go colonies way to go America
America we'll try and schedule away yeah
I didn't we don't totally shed so you
can have one to complain about
maybe we'll pretend West Virginia's a
colony and just go sit in the field you
literally just insult everyone unless
we're good
you don't have a computers over to you
Oh West Virginia you let him know
nothing nothing it's awesome it's like
regular Virginia but a little further
west I just he's just kidding for real I
sure hope that other people who decide
to take a thirteen colonies field trip
had their very own George Washington
with them historian in the car yeah you
know I feel I feel for those that don't
yeah it if they don't they can just
watch our videos yeah and learn all this
now and I can go to some of the same
places the thing about that is you know
