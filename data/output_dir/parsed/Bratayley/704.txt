all right my friends we just spent three
hours or so uphill or more the Sun is
draining but we had a blasty blast like
I don't drink you did really because
we're going to go up and our relaxing
day continues we have nothing to do
today
there's not many days where we can say
that where we don't have anything to do
so you ready for some ice cream
super-sized cold
let me know sorry : ok scare me away
first yep yeah no I'm gonna guess from
the bite nobody new boss man Tyler John
what's the verdict yes again Haley is
that one good oh yeah Cole that is not
your natural hair color
goodbye admit your friend Sara you know
eating bean ice cream I had a good idea
when you're cold
just for the record what do you think it
would Haley oh my god oh my gosh they're
not crazy
how how is it that day hold on
oh we can't use ice to the flesh what is
this
open up yeah let her hold it oh yeah
give me a gum yeah I know

that is amazing good did you know it's
gonna be that thing well we went down
there and saw and we're just gonna get a
regular large pizza and we saw this and
we're like oh they will think that's
great
how many gonna eat Jim so as you can see
guys it's still bright out but somebody
else Lee yes is fast asleep the Sun
drained her she got a little bit of
sunburn on her face guess we didn't put
in enough sunscreen
um I've got an idea for a question of
the day we've had a nice relaxing day
what are you gonna give me a baby no I
was gonna give you a present what you
said yeah so all my good ideas have to
involve giving you presents okay I'll
remember that and be like I never have a
good idea ever again okay so it involves
us pizza that we barely even put a dent
in what's the most slice of pizza you've
ever eaten and one meal ie like I ate
worms i one thing i want a hey once I
mean so I ate um three threes your most
I've eaten back in high school a whole
pizza a whole large pizza by my fellas
Hayley's I mean Annie's most is probably
four or five yeah she's asleep and got a
whole pizza now yes
I don't eat the crust so ie you know
most of the crust
I eat up to the very edge so it's not
technically a whole pizza I guess blah
blah blah okay so we're gonna call it a
night because we had a long great well
so funny that I say a long day it was
pretty relaxing
dairy or no yeah what about is people
are not I cannot eat dairy uh well then
I don't know the problem is is we're
tired because back home it's a lot later
than it is here in California like
twelve know pop that late but the sun's
going down here so that just means it
it's bedtime at home which is why yeah
he's out like a light
and yeah is and Haley is all full of
energy and he didn't even eat dinner so
don't forget to comment down below
anyone in the question of the day is
