oh I need me I need blue memorandum in
my word when Jesus don't you know what
I'm dressed but
it was excited you know you're excited
he got the boy catching that's not what
we're excited just excited about
baseball he gets the call from the
pitching coach to tell the picture what
to pitch because they usually only pay
strike when it was strike they don't
call the balls you just know it throwing
the ball okay baseball's bad I mean we
know anaphor nope chuckles oh no I just
need two more help and the games if they
score though the game's not baseball's
bad all right

missed the strike then why do you
justify that straight straight didi
shaking nervous habit no he didn't
I think that's gay Lee's reading right
now she's written stuff she's made like
dog and a boy yeah anyways and it's time
for question the day is once again up it
is would you rather sit in the front
middle or back of a row look back
because um you get the front like
pulling everyone and by the way by the
time you're the you go you go you get to
the top you're already like going down
so you go faster in the back now I say
depends entirely because if it's like a
slow ride then I just like to be in the
front and enjoy the view
yeah but it's that's right I'd like to
be all like
what's a roller coaster
not one of those oh yeah I probably say
back in front your fins okay hmm I'm
that's not a good one
he doesn't ride rollercoasters so don't
forget to come yes and a group are you a
leader or a follower oh yeah that is
despicable
what are you just predicable wait so why
don't you hug your follower just I'm a
leader I hadn't dream like you ever
right now question of the day these boys
remember see the front middle and back
of a roller coaster and one okay bye
thanks for watching
Brit Haley
