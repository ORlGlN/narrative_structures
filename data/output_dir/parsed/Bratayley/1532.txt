couldn't get any filming done at Luke's
house cuz there are at least 75 people
there and there wasn't any um like quiet
places in the house my legs still
hurting because well it's just verdict
um and so sorry about the video is just
gonna be mainly about us in the car but
we did get a little bit of filming at
the party but not a lot um so I guess
we're gonna go to little question of
that question of the day is what's the
best trick your pet knows how to do put
them up bang bang rollover shake
hey babe
let me go get the dog okay so here it is
my favorite is the shake shake so the
first one is sit and then she
automatically puts it so she does a
shake lay down yes it's a routine now
that she sees biscuit she sits shakes
whatever she needs to do to get that
best what's your dog's best trick is so
thanks for watching
