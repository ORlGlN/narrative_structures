really good okay and we're going to Jim
at 10:45 because I have a private the
reason why I ever having a private is
because I miss Monday Tuesday and I'm
going miss Thursday and Friday for
children a gymnastics coach
yeah
and then you have regular practice not
regular backtick the long way yeah and
I'm still in LA time I mean I woke up at
dinner
it was seven hour later
usually I don't feel like the time
change bothers us but I'm at this think
we're it usually maybe it's because we
don't go to LA for four days they get
like like two to three days you really
don't adjust at the time I feel like we
did kind of work I think it's just a
little bit of cars slamming the brakes
on the front but we have a second behind
the head yeah the car behind us I don't
think paying attention and kind of
swerved off the road a little okay
funders can hit us but he didn't woman
back from Adam and he made it way more
dramatic but okay I'm back
