lot of vlog in this home

I said Annie feeling better and
snuggling right okay oh my god see the
only boy gods aren't actually went went
off didn't it didn't go terribly wait
you said your best part Carrie you give
it you nobody was gonna hurt ya the fact
that in we are separately for the
trooper was gonna say that I was sick
but then mommy was like it's okay you
shouldn't be making up excuse do you

because should I tell everybody that I'm
sick when I got on today no you just get
up there and you vote it funny
like jump
the air
I can't keep two back why do you carry
two bags okay guys so here's the thing
anyone being super goofy yes now and
then I turn the care much like myself
this little one I started in the funeral
so hopefully she does not have whatever
it was that Annie had we might start her
on that medicine maybe right they said
they're doing school on the plane gross
TMI we got we got like about two hours
of Annie being feeling good and now it's
back to not feeling well
she felt good all morning and now we're
waiting to get on this plane to Los
Angeles she got the middle she got the
middle part going and nope you guys it
was just a trim her hair is not read
eyed or colored and he goes a filter
so it just made it look a little blonder
if not nothing is in there you did when
that Atlanta flight just I feel bad for
people when they missed a flight I'm
always afraid I am afraid like sometimes
I'm sitting at a gate I'm not gonna pay
attention because we sit we usually sit
down at the next gate when there's more
room and I'm always afraid that we're
gonna sit there and not be listening and
lose track of time and hasn't happened
yet
alright you guys ready for that airplane
kiss tradition lick the airplane they
like a specific side which side do you
decide you go sign on before
so we think about when we're walking
down like where are we gonna sit which
side of the plane we've got both sides
of the plane oh she's not feeling well
again let's think happy thoughts
I know it was a it was so good and then
all of a sudden
hadn't kicked in yet
hey guys okay I'm watching my little
pony
my table
like that the burger maker are up I'm
decent for our arrival - no that's not
about 29 minutes from now a bath bar
boys like thinking appliance is missing
they got all our luggage and he included
yes
yeah it's probably hard to turn
Tipler just stop me
when I got off the plane I was like so
my head and my stomach they don't hurt
anymore like I feel like I'm gonna throw
up but my head's not throbbing
but
I just like feel like
LHS I don't think you up here like any
myself if you have a panic attack on
them you should watch put them out of
sight I was trying to think we're
worried about finding the car and I was
like freaking out wrench and replay on
that look
toy story my little pony on
Lane
see you guys again when we find their
car yay we did it we did it we did it
perfect they fell asleep on the shuttle
the literal 5 minute shuttle ride Annie
hasn't hiccup
we are to push this back in between cars
and blog you guys it was a successful
trip bringing our own car to the airport
right we've made it back almost to the
car the Sun setting it's beautiful here
in LA we're happy to be back we did it
the girls are gonna go to sleep in the
car I'm sure I'm coming
I could only move so fast yes all right
this is how you have to be do you want
to do things with one hand
lately it's still here oh you guys and
scene
we did it hopefully traffic's not bad
for Camila traffic's bad oh hey
everybody
Annie don't act like that literally 20
second ago okay so Annie's up and down
all day long I don't feel good oh I feel
great I'm bouncing on the bed and I'm
like lay down and just chill out and
that was our conversation so right now
she's in a goofy Annie mood we were even
to mate debating like literally when we
walked on the door she thought she was
gonna throw up like maybe we should take
her to an urgent care so that still may
happen tonight but we can't really take
her to Urgent Care when she's like
bouncing off the walls cuz they would
probably look at us like we're crazy but
I know the second we take her to Urgent
Care she's gonna like literally feel
better and we wouldn't have needed to go
but if that takes to make her feel
better then we'll go to Urgent Care so
this video you know this could happen we
might we're gonna bout to wrap up the
video with a question of the day if we
decide to take her to Urgent Care
we'll definitely blog that but if not
we're gonna end the video now I want you
to feel better though and you're on Dave
I'm not feeling well off and on I'm
still glad can't explain the headache or
the nausea and I'm so good I'm like
trying to get a better angle
I'm not below my chin like that I know
guy that's so weird I thought if I could
just hold the camera up like that like
but no all right so the question of the
day is - are you watching oh yeah for us
it is like 8 o'clock at night it is John
do not go to the doctor
see what I mean completely different kid
alright so it's about eight o'clock Oh
mommy I think Haley is in the other
yummy pretzel facetiming page that's all
and if I can get up I don't really feel
like getting up I'm gonna transfer this

computer right now so I'm probably not
