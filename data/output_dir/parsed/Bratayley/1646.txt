we're down
No
you might really look out when we come
into the stoplight
one day she falls out while you're
holding her right yeah I'm gonna tell
you lately
well then she'd probably get really hurt
so let's not have that happen
so like I said we're on our way to get
Haley our new secondary
hey guys I just got home from watching
over League games if you didn't know
where I was that's where I was and so I
was watching YouTube because it's been a
while since a half and so um I came
across this really funny YouTube called
cartoon iam and they did this thing
quotes a beer which is very very very
very very funny and we've watched most
of the episodes this is episode 12 older
clamour and we totally need to
large-screen it to get the full effect
No look we found it sure that isn't a
bathroom it's not please pearl biggest
problem you man so that was shaver but
you should definitely go subscribe to
them because they have a lot of other
cartoons beside chamber so the name of
this channel is cartoon iam and as you
can see they have a lot of cool stuff so
be sure to hit that subscribe button
I am totally and I subscribe but you
actually got to click the button click
the mouse there you go now you're
subscribed huh really so the question
today is gonna be about shaving but if
you haven't watched Savior then you got
a little bit of homework to do
all you gotta do is go 1 episode 1 of
shaving it is called see what it's it's
gone swimming with sharks so slow it
down and then watch them all and then
come back to this video and comment down
below what character you like the best
and why do you like gloopy

be funny really
he doesn't want only poor old male at
Malachi of the turtle but you like I
thought you would go turtle the turtle
and mommy say why she knows you really
well except but maybe she doesn't know
you well because you didn't say turtle
so mmm but give us a turtle we haven't
seen in a while and no one can
understand
