today Albert Ayler count her backhands
rings Haley you weary soul to rest
yeah I will try to do my best to keep
you safe
the gravity
to earth
I'd like to say
it's more clear when it's more cloudy
every day
but summer's gone
turn the stormy cloud
but rained it should be wet is it soaked
so are you now soaked Chester BAM
you are young my side you wanna get more
soap do you not really trampling all to
yourself what you got the trampoline all
to yourself yeah
can you do a front-flip on the wet
trampoline let's not do that you're
gonna do something entertaining you're
inside her home from school and we're
watching TV was named Annie and I think
Caleb jumped on the shampoos I was just
out there it's boiling jumping on your
handling by yourself I'll I can't
believe yesterday I worked on my style
jumps but you did
did you get your legs up yeah do you
think that was a deduction in your at
your meet well hey Lisbon
um let me just put your assets really
recently
every time she
knocking in here what's wrong feet
yeah I'm sure your feet are cold anyway
mommy used to tell Hayley that she had
that she would throw a fit but then
every time we would come home from
school she would tell us with the new
that she's not quitting
so basically Hayley doesn't want to go
to mastic so she throws a fit but when
she actually gives her and it's done
with the running chance like a great
time that's why she doesn't want to quit
so we're trying to think of ways to help
Hayley go to gymnastics cuz she likes it
when she's it
we thought about a sticker a sticker
chart is after gymnastics if she didn't
cry she would get one sticker and if she
reached a testicle she would give a tiny
prize she did it for a whole month she
did me him she did it for two months big
prize
Haley guess what and you do it for two
months then you might be able to get
that roller coaster for the Lalaloopsy
wait what do I get to do then I get
stuff like that you don't go to the moss
at Sun card for the record
Haley cries not in the middle of
gymnastics but before ematic once she
gets a and she's fine I have to tell you
other stuff so the time I jumped off the
trampoline
I broke my leg you have not broken your
leg Oh seriously I think he's trying to
be like Nikolas remember the summer when
we were on vacation and Nikolas tried to
fall in every video I think that's gonna
be Caleb now you
um left us home with Nikolas and we have
a film and Nikolas and Nick um every
time the camera went on you would either
run into a picture or run into a wall
sounds a lot like Caleb through the wall
and then you encourage him by laughing
hooligan hook encourages me bother me
whose talk with their mouth full okay so
right now Caleb and daddy are going to
baseball and the girls and the girls are
on this earth bleed while mommy's doing
something inside and we're getting ready
to do Bible study but so right now we're
jumping on the trampoline and sorry that
our videos are always of us jumping on
the trampoline but so most of our videos
