Wow and we're watching black skirt
squirrels he's huge
instinct it's like hamster Haley gets to
go to her first camp you excited or
nervous
I'm cold or cold all right breathing
yeah not really cold well we're having
in your Rubik's Cube cuz I'm gonna have
time to do your room excu
she's gotta exercise Ramona over here
girls this way this way
I'm just getting tatted up
now she's Giuliana today oh good golly
jewelry on okay let me see fancy
and Annie's heel is hurting because
she's over here just doing full turns
did a few tumbling passes
because she still having fun though
we can't see Annie right now in the sea
of beam
we'll see what Haley's doing
oh my god you just threw it she just
threw it
oh my goodness
awesome - her hands landed it
oh you're debating angle or just leaving
it to the good one what do you think
how'd it feel it looked good yes I was
over here being like all sassy and be
like she won't start anything and then
you got up there and I'm like oh good
job thanks mom you look good any good
job
and the blinds very very long
the event
good job that was awesome
so Annie won't be vaulting either for
the peel pane
Oh someone's being super goofy
after you do a roundy room you know a
half carat round around your chocolate
for home from camp do you know what that
was Haley's first camp ever wasn't it
did you like it
she was asleep in the car so I'd say
it's she had a good day wore her out
oh that Panda because there's Panda
where's their spoon I don't you like
Candice are you in this conversation
with us right now like just like talking
clearly yeah oh hello dog
I almost tripped go ahead Billy oh are
you talking again no but really easy to
break down
no I'm daddy please daddy please daddy
please daddy please hey I am figuring
this out he already did figure it out
sit it's all mixed up and I've already
solved that further still what's going
on about to beat her yes her tickler
hurt so God is giving her calf muscles a
little bit of massage and then she's
gonna cheat what is it the next step is
to stretch them and then ice them
because because we think that it's
possibly not her heel then it's her
Keeley's pulling on her calf muscle or
something like that all right this is a
way it's not in her heel she keeps
saying it's hurting here
which is the Aquila yeah holding on that
and so if we can massage the calf out it
may relieve some pain feels that good
huh
cuz there was absolutely no vaulting or
tumbling today was there you did a
little tumbling a no vault um I don't
know if you can fault tomorrow that's
between you and coach Mary worth a try
to see if this works
cuz it's miserable she can't do anything
and then she's so frustrated is this
like going to the chiropractor it's not
a good pain Annie it many stops she goes
back from one thing I now don't go in my
inner from one day to the next I might
need that paper miss hoverboard got my

Houston in hurts bad if I should laugh
or so this is exactly what Annie's
feeling yeah says remember the calves
