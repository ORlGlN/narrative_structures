today we he's not going to
hey guys so right now we are packing my
lunch and I was like kind of mixing nuts
with cashews and pistachios and we're
cracking the pistachios because I don't
wanna do that
yeah it's my last day of gymnastics
before coach Mary gets back in this
really exciting so cool go Annie I'm
beating you so pursue my mic and cashews
I'll what else be backing he's all about
it yet where's your lunchbox why she
puts pucks in the pantry I don't see
your lunch but see what kind of choices
Annie made healthy choices what do you
guys think
no no this was the old the nuts and the
orders were the only healthy choices you
are not taking a swift cake roll and
Twinkies and two bags of chips magic one
negative one bag of chips and hacking a
very unhealthy snack holidays this could
be a dessert one dessert okay and then
you need like now this isn't like a
full-fledged lunch let's just search for
the record cause she ate lunch before
she went to gym but you needed some
snacks
huh oh my god that's we yeah tell me
about it
Haley - there she is no you're not
eating a Twinkie right now coach Mary's
gonna have some atop with you I imagine
that's true you should have even
watching this who bought the Twinkies
what I'd like to know see if you don't
have those kind of choices in here then
they can't make those bad choices so
it's a default that's what I just
establish right baby
hmm told daddy don't worry oh I would
have never told you to buy Twinkies Oh
daddy you get the groceries up yes
mommy's for allowing dad a fighting game
I'll trade you but ultimately it's the
person who makes the decision to eat it
whether there's temptations or not I
knew Bob what how what on myself I
didn't do anything wrong I asked daddy
to order the groceries whatever yes it
is I'm okay yeah guys today I am getting
new glasses but you but you know how do
you see me with glasses all gosh you
know how you see me with glasses right
now
up close up hook something I'm not not
sometimes like oh I don't know sometimes
I'm gonna say it crosses and I can't
like a read or I hide things up close to
me like the camera so I have to have my
glasses on and right now we are going to
get new basses because of my death I
don't know because she gave me a new
prescription burn burn
for perscription yeah yeah he-hey
but he said that you don't ya wrong
right
I don't know first it was a girl but
there doctors actually yeah but he's
changing the prescriptions giving you
less of a prescription because your eyes
are getting better yep it's just that
when you are looking at something up
close like the camera or when you're
writing your eyes still comes in a
little bit but you don't need your
glasses far away but reader she's got
her she was trying to say the reason
she's got her glasses on now is because
when she is holding the camera close to
her her I may turn in because she's
focusing on the camera
so if she decided to put her glasses on
right now right we get it
those are cute do you like them I know
yeah so many choices what do you want to
die what do you think you'd like which
I'd like a BKB ones oh yeah no we have
to try every single pair on here are
some little ones
yeah those are cute how about these
let's try all these because these are
really little you might fit your face so
these are the ones that we got under my
eyes that's where my bifocals gonna go
yeah so she has a PI focal in her
glasses you see the line right here guys
that's actually the prescription right
there yep and the rest of it regular
glasses but that's what she has to look
through and she's doing writing and
reading so they have a much line look at
these flowers on the side
I mean you bet so you got to wait for
the viewers to come in though you have
to make it we're on the way to I don't
