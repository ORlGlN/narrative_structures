screaming okay but really you know the
reason we're it calls right is not to
buy a toy but to buy some tights because
it's winter for you toy but you have to
find something that's $1,000 not do
behind you what what you have to do
around no cuz you're gonna do something
to me yeah a nice a I'll turn around but
I'm gonna keep this facing you alright
go are you doing so what I was trying to
say is Haley you only have a dollar and
all these toys are more than a dollar so
what I suggest is you save your life
nope $32 you save your money until you
have more dollars I know
or you could afford some bubblegum
that's pretty much it yeah hey look we
have to save your money you have to do
chores you did one chore
I will get that's nature your chore is
to get a toy you wish that'd be awesome
for Hayley poor Hayley had to be I was
always having to be dragged around to
all the sporting stores now we're
grocery shopping she's being a trooper

trooper I don't mean a storm trooper I
just mean she's cooperating for us
