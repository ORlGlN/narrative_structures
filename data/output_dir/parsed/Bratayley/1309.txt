time for what tell me hey guys it's a
beautiful Saturday morning and it's my
day off and caleb has baseball tryouts
today and awhile here's that baseball
tryouts Sydney and I are going to a
professional baseball baseball game and
to this morning I did my wrecking
Reynolds hair and I curled it and trying
it on me to see what happens
yeah and I'm gonna take it down in about
5 minutes and my mom is to take me to
Sydney's I'll show you what my American
Girl dolls hair turned out to be and
this was my first American Girl doll me
Chieko good night alrighty honor or Anna

get mixed up in her name's Anna and I
and this is when it comes here on get
and this is what here mine looks like
there we go this is what mine looks like
and then I did Hayley's I can go tall
too and her hair like loose curls and
then mine I didn't um twice that are
kind of like ringlets like oh don't
really you can barely see them but hers
are kind of like really loose girls yeah
I think it and then Hayley is just like
my American Girl dolls ringlets yeah so
I'm about to take my hair up and about
let me see what time it is three minutes
so if you want me to have to cover your
American Girl dolls hair all you to do
is give it damp and take a section of
her hair and twist it and then put it
into a bun put ponent put a ponytail and
do that to all over here and then wait
for about 30 minutes to 4 to 5 minutes I
like to do to make it curly ER and when
you take it down I'll be curly so that's
why I do it cuz I don't have
loose curl is probably are better but
don't have any girl is that's what I
might actually do a tutorial lot and
then now two more minutes
why didn't I waited how much waited
waited so now I'm going to take them
down then about two minutes and some but
here and I don't know if I can do it
with one hand and I'll film it so though
I just took them down and they are super
girlies well I'm just gonna play around
with them to loosen them up and I've
ever seen my hair curly except for when
I was little and now there's little
parts in them we're one side and I'm
just gonna make those go away we hear
