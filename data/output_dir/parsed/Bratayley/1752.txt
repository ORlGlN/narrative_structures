put your weary soul to rest yeah I will
try to do my best to keep you safe
inside
to earth
more cloudy
every day but summer is gone
earn the stormy cloud
more stopping at warmer and more working
look at this one
oh I like I look at that what should we
name them hey look at the white one in
the orange one I know which we name them
can't think of any to me you do have a
fishing classroom does it have a name
um I am clearly no one to me this is the
best poem letter goes can you beat all
hundred by yourself
have 15 guys pull them back look can you
lift them up me see your muscles come on
there's a hundred popsicles on here
do you know what a hundred divided by
three is by a lot
how many so that means each kid gets a
lot 100 divided by three equals a lot of
popsicles one to play try that again I
know that's right I was looking at it
crooked and it looked like seven you
each get 30 3.3333 three popsicles each
unless you share with your friends can
you eat thirty three point three three
three popsicles I can't do it Matt Flynn
why lovely what what can you mean you if
you have a friend over and you're eating
popsicles wouldn't you give your friend
one those balloons okay so can you eat
33 blues
did you hear what I said I said can you
eat 33 balloons and you said yes
balloons no we're talking about
popsicles yeah I lost her I lost her
guys she's gone she's in la-la land with
balloons all right I don't know if you
could hear her but she said she picked
out a different kind of gum and she's
not sure about the smell so she's gonna
try it she is trying it and what do you
think she said if she doesn't like it
she's gonna spit it in the trash or
choke on it
what do you think it's gross
hello Mike
yo kind you like the kind I get better
this is where I say told you so
right no I why it's I'm gonna eat the
possible yeah the other way to the
popsicles freeze up and really really
really well I'm not I'm not filming your
head and it's a really really really
really day today so I don't think you're
gonna be able to feed the popsicles
outside which is all the fun in it kind
of a fun but but hey it inside yeah it's
a warm bay inside why are you still
talking rumor has it that Annie has to
get her press handstand from sitting
whoa way to dodge the dog anyway from
sitting in order to move up to level six
so she's working really hard on it just
in case that is true that's word on the
street
well I want to know this
then don't do it on the floor just do it
from a stand we'll then just do your
exercises from sitting see how long you
can hold it your straddle press I like
that idea
yes it's raining
exactly you stole the words right out of
my mouth
it was totally gonna say that we had to
come inside public Raney right rainy day
and Haley's been so patient so I gave
her the healthiest of healthy snacks
right curse you that's really healthy
right
eating a little bit of Hershey chocolate
before dinner
because Haley's been such a trooper
today he's been good right do you get a
special team
so those are matters such hearty
oh you can mean hello you can believe
how many things is a chocolate you have
how many rectangles do you have
9 let's put it down and counting him I
can see not not line rectangles like
that ok I was trying to help you one two
we got to slow down and point four one
one piece of chocolate oh don't put on
the dirty table
slow down and point to upkeep in
chocolate and say a number
that was good counting six season things
got slow down and take your time
oh I'm trying to talk of effort yeah are
you gonna grow up and be a candy maker
you're gonna make candy when you grow up
I thought that was pretty easy of a
question trust you I chew bubble gum you
chew bubble gum - do you want to do some
more math okay Hayley just had six
pieces of chocolate and she ate a piece
so she figured out that six minus one
was what what do we say
no six minus one you had six you ate one
how many do you have left five
now you had six right cut your chocolate
down hold up six fingers hold up six
fingers and then your one no all five of
this and one over here that's six all of
those how many now how many yeah but now
how many pieces did you eat hold up your
six hold it for six five and one
five and one hold up all five on this
one okay how many pieces of candy have
you eaten now tell me how many did you
eat how many do you remember just eating
just now
three okay so hold up your five and hold
up your one so you had six sending you
eight one two three pieces of chocolate
so how many do you have wha how many
fingers three so six minus three is that
is math at its finest it is exactly that
so hold up just three fingers three
fingers now take one away take one
finger away how many do you have left -
so three minus one equal I think you're
ready for algebra I think you're ready
for algebra cause you're so smart at
addition I mean at subtraction we might
as a little mood Alber
your favorite inna that what you're
doing you're fake regime okay
