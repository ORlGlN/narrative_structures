moment maybe a little nervous but

level next year I don't know

wouldn't see why not
because you've got a lot of your skills
you need and you're not afraid to try
the ones you don't have yet right Caleb

can't see him but we can hear him he
thinks he's so special I see you we are
in the car going to my beat but first we
are about to pick up Olivia because
she's gonna come and watch my meat and
you're at our house and I'm just very
excited
she doesn't compete today but he can't
compete tomorrow but she wanted to come

watch a movie that kind of like movie
nights but the rule was that you were to
straighten up your room and I guess I'm
gonna be the only one watching movie
night can I listen Haley
yes your room ah after I go potty
uh Annie go take care of business first
a baby I got some flowers and mom is
gonna put them in a vase and I'm gonna
help her nice I got a ribbon I can put
this my here and I could for my last
meet gave me a flower and it smells so
good to smell it mmm make sure this
doesn't Bob you wanted to do it no you
did you said I can do it I said I don't
think you can reach I can reach no but
you had to make sure this is still hmm
so would you like me to do it yeah Bree
I know and I don't think that's gonna
make you that much taller it's like a
few inches higher
exactly
all I needed was a few inches you
measure the simple jump sail let me do
it no it's my pretty flower you are not
tall enough I had to think of something
else hmm
I got it 10 hours later when you crash
down to the ground don't say I didn't
warn you
hey why me hey Annie be careful cuz you
may crash down to the ground oh I told
you this is not a good idea but if I
make sure it doesn't fall and who's
gonna film it when you fall hey who's
gonna catch the oh my gosh we're on
camera now I have to get off you're
almost left right what pillow is this
your lucky pillow because you've had
like 12 other pillows on your bed this
is getting unsafe well if you would just
let me do it it would be a lot safer I'm
not letting that happen
all for a little flower that you're
probably gonna get in the wrong angle I
will
oh and now he's oh yes and my idea was
to have it like hanging off a little bit
Oh another fallacy no you've reached
your limit on pillows that you'll bet
I'm gonna allow you to stand on there
