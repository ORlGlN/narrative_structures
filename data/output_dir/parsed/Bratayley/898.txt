time for metalli today we're going to
the doctors to see the cardiologist and
they work on without work over they
check out your heart that's open
you know why we're gonna go to the
cardiologist
No well so here's the thing
don't know still we still don't have any
results left on what exactly happened to
Caleb but we have some part
these it runs on my side of the family
and so the most people are
I guess speculating or assuming maybe
the better word for you guys
assuming that that is a good possibility
of what happened like he had a heart
thing that we've had checked out you
guys have all been checked for it and
have not shown any signs of it and but
it doesn't check you out at different
times I'm not explaining it all so what
it is is they have to check your heart
out to see if you have that disease and
the last time we got you guys all
checked out you didn't have it but
they're thinking it may be it presented
in Caleb very recently or even that day
and so we're just going to go and get
y'all's heart checked out it was almost
time anyway but we'd like rather do it
sooner than later and maybe when Caleb's
results come back it isn't the heart but
just in case
really go get you guys checked out don't
know we have no idea not
kind of been a little a little bit hard
I mean it's all been hard but maybe that
makes it even harder than not knowing
no clue this isn't what a ten-year-old
and a seven-year-old do at the doctor's
office when we get there really early
and they can't pick you
Haley's heart completely normal
extra muscles in high or not even around
my yeah you're right then blood fender
cool which one left ventricles Falls
something I don't remember what he said
like five percent have it as completely
it's a normal variable so it's like not
normal for everybody to have but it's a
normal nothing it's not bad it's not
good you just have it actually said it
might be kind of good to keep calm
yeah so
kind of relieved to know that
everything's the heart doing what it
should do more question yes
yep didn't really make me feel any
better I don't know makes me feel better
for the girls definitely but
time I guess just time
