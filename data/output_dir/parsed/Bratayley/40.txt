today we heard something good morning my
friends we've had a rough morning
laying down Anna I was getting ready
Hayley's about to do school and Annie's
not feeling well Annie's doing this it's
a roller coaster she felt pretty good
yesterday she feels horrible today so
Haley's up and Adam she's about to start
school she's ready for the plane we have
a quick meeting before we get on a plane
a nanny we figured out what is wrong
well what we think is wrong she's
congested and so we're trying to fix
that we it's a sinus headache is what we
realized I don't know what the tummy
issues were the other day but the
headache we believe you have to do
another one this should be instant
relief that works okay
so Haley's not feeling the love because
I'm making her to school no you you were
mad because I'm gonna make you do school
there's a bonus look pretty much packed
there's a bonus to not feeling sick
there's two bonuses one you're not
feeling sick who wants to be sick no one
the other bonuses you're gonna get
school done and you'll have less to do
yeah if she doesn't get it she just does
not want to do school you'll have you'll
get done sooner to another day that
Annie might be able to do school later
what if the medicine kicks in but I
wanted them to do a little school before
the meeting and I don't think Annie's
gonna be able to do any this has been
requested to get in bed with her all
right
the update is we've canceled the meeting
Haley is taking a break from school
don't have have don't have her fool you
she's not sick she is she threw up
meetings been canceled we're playing it
by ear whether we're getting on the
plane or not I'm guessing we're gonna
get on the plane and just try
well she's sick you're like what's that
mean
hi I think sometimes flying when you've
got like a cold is not good but I feel
like I know it's not even that it's like
what if she feels fine tomorrow like you
know what I mean and then we're like so
now we're sitting here in LA when
there's a concert and she feels fine but
I don't know what to do these are like
tough decisions that you have to make
