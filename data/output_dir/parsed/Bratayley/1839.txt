nearest gas station mister yeah okay so
we just got back from a long trip back
from the great book the the Great Wolf
Lodge
and um I couldn't explain and we had fun
and I didn't explain to you what
happened at the Great Wolf Lodge because
it was too loud and everybody's running
so we decided to do it now when it's so
quiet oh by the way I'm on my way to
gymnastics so I have a few minutes to
tell you this that by BG right now so um
butene Olivia were on this waterslide
it was a really fast waterslide and um
we were in this ginormous tube and I
guess the - the tube um didn't really go
that fast because we were so loud light
mean Olivia I guess we didn't that way
much the we didn't weigh as much as we
should have
so when we were out in the RAF in the
middle of it we stopped and not I'm
slide is light and right when we stopped
the lights turned off so I guess it
thought we were done because we were so
light so um like we got really got stuck
the RAF would not move and we were stuck
down there about two minutes and we were
yelling help and stuff and we both
screamed like we went 1 2 3 and I
screamed and then so a lifeguard and
three people had to come on a RAF and
knock us through but when we
I am knocked um had to come down and get
us um meet Olivia like flu because um
the wrath legs but they went so fast
that we weren't ready like we don't know
they were coming at um fast so we flew
that way but we were still hanging on to
the wrath and Olivia's me got hurt and
was leaving so it was kind of scary and
kinda and I was I'm a little upset after
but I got I'm I lived I lived
oh the funny part was when we just
started on to stop when Liv was
screaming she she was great she was
about to separate we were gonna die so
she said we're gonna and it always
flashed on us
look I was she came out of the raft to
try to push and every time she would get
out it would spray us and then right
would as great as she said we're gonna
so yeah it was a little scary but what
I'm happy about is that I went on the
tornado with Liz and Caleb with a few
other guys with him
and yeah in Paris if you ever end up
going down the tornado backwards no
because then you guys went down you were
gonna go after that fly yes you my gosh
stuff happen you guys got stuck I was
gonna do that but now I really want to
do it backwards
