about that here's what's weird um
instead of floor ringing yeah pretty
much she's sitting on him 0:04 was first
in my um first meet and now floor is
last in my second meet really I didn't
know that so if floors last may or
secont mean that means you start on
vault yeah admit it's always an order
vault bars beam floor so that's why when
you start it on floor it's like a circle
then you went to vault
bars being floor because vault always
first but you don't always start on ball
does that make sense so if you start on
bars then it's bars being floor vault so
