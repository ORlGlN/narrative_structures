that's probably the shortest amount of
time I've spent in a hotel room but it's
definitely better than sleeping in the
airport we're now going to catch the
shuttle back to the terminal and jump on
a flight back are you feeling this

bus is pretty chilly out here and mum

out Kairos pretty big so you need to get
taxis around the whole week or we can
rent a car and have a go at driving in
Egypt which could be pretty fun so

got the rental car we're just getting
our things together now we're going to
drive to the hotel it's gonna be pretty
please first time driving immediate

place beeping just pushing in I kind of
feel like it's inevitable that we're
going to crash this website it's totally
the motion state post-arrest River so
these guys are sticking fit in the van
so though this Trillin this guy with a
banana is just driving and driving the
solution
just relax the driving sis relaxing
some might call it stressful but for
these guys it's a virtue
he just jumped his brakes on it took a
while to stop

until the car weighs it is it touch such
as a little tubular

good shortcut trotting it off okay
