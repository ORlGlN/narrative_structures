I'm nine you're watching good morning
guys I've just landed in Johannesburg
it's about 9 a.m. and I am walking
through on my friend JP there is all
right this is all right take me how you
doing little stress better doing it
right here what what are the plans for
today what do we need to get up
basically we have a whole lot of
paperwork stuff finish being Africa XY
so we have all goes down we can leave
tomorrow morning when Olivia
and where's customers Wednesday morning
you see how it goes
cool we've stopped over some aviation
place and JP needs to get it South
African pilot's license before we fly
apparently any different licenses in
different countries so these two gets
photos done for ahead we've done the
photos we're waiting for the license to
get whatever made up and then come down
to get some breakfast near an airfield
ah job you just told me that this is the
size of the plane and we're flying to
Namibia
so we got burgers for breakfast classics
I'm hoping maybe this will be right
you got the licen take it out of here
man ready to fly yep
so we are in our room I'm gonna have a
few hours nap because we're gonna sleep
it on the plane and JP is heading off to
get some stuff fixed on the plane and
I'm gonna hand him over to you guys so
he can keep you updated with what we're
up to
well I've seen a few hours man enjoy
your sleep peace variety so this is the
baby this is the girl that we gonna be
flying across Africa in and she's
feeling a little bit sad at the moment
that we'll fix it right up and she
should be good to go about tomorrow
morning
well JP's back i napped the whole
afternoon but I feel more I feel weird
but I feel like a bit more rested I've
just found out we've got a super early
morning because the plane was fixed and
ready to go so we're leaving they're
like here like 4:30 I think is that
right
pulled it from around yeah right 4:30 we
should be able to run 6 we should see
the Sun Rise twice actually
oh well yeah and I'll show you guys the
route that JP's planned out in a minute
yeah still just sweep up yeah let's get
some dinner
Phillip happen Ian all day
there we ate a burger the movie burger
right we got half chicken and
tucking in
JP's right this isn't this isn't Nando's
but you know he'll do done with dinner
we've now looked into a taking pay we're
going to get snacks and bits for the the
journey the important stuff chocolate
here you guys stuff up here as well
little bit of an update guys I mean Jay
piercing here there's been a bit of a
dilemma basically up until 20 minutes
ago we were all ready to go tomorrow
morning early start 4:30 we've got the
plane all sorted like you saw earlier JP
got his license they needed then JP got
a phone call and now we probably can't
use the plane that we are planning to
what your thoughts and everything you
feel little bit stressed it's very very
frustrating better I guess flying is all
about being safe yeah we really don't
want to take chances and problem solving
is all part of the adventure so JP is
like frantically trying to look online
on some flight forums to see if we can
yes source another plane so so that's
the current situation oh I'll keep you
updated
we'll probably have some more updates
tonight still quite early when do you
think the air list will we could go if
stuff goes smoothly from here like if
you find the aircraft tonight
you still need tomorrow - well with the
thing is we need to get all that
Namibian paperwork redone which is taken
me seven days so so at least we know the
process now can you contact or is it
still going to take another slide I
could try and get it done in two days
but and that would be very her
so you think two days minimum from here
is when we could actually get into for
elimination and then you would but
you're saying the other option is to fly
commercially to the baby air and then
disorder get an airplane there that
could be a better option isn't it but I
can only do that in the morning
I'm gonna figure that out yeah can we
chat more with the guys you hanging out
today could they make a decline of chat
to them really
what are they suggesting dare just say
it's highly unlikely work to build to
get hold of a plane yeah so JP is
crashed out I think today has been
pretty tough for them and trying to
figure everything out we're still not
sure what's going on so it's kind of
been left tonight all up in the air and
excuse the pun but hopefully tomorrow we
can book some flights to Namibia head
out there and you saying you knows
people out there we could borrow a plane
from or higher up from so I think that's
the current plan I will see weapons in
the morning hope you aren't stuck in
Jana's burg for too many too long sweet
boy
I'll catch you bright and early tomorrow
peace out enjoy life and then the
adventure boom
