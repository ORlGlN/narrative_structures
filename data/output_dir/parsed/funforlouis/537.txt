so I just welcome them to the zombie
project yeah hey guys I am Dave Erasmus
I'm Louie Cole and I've been building
companies using the internet for the
last ten years I've been doing a lot of
things including running a youtube
channel daily vlogs for the last three
years and built up quite a big global
audience and all that while for the last
10 15 years we've been traveling the
world together like here in Canada and
we've been jamming and thinking about
how to use what we know to be helpful
and useful but we've realized that we
don't have any big ideas to make change
in the world ourselves but there's
plenty of people around the world with
incredible ideas but they don't have
access to people that can make that
happen or they don't know how to network
or connect with people and that's where
we want to I guess trying to help and
collaborate exactly so we've come up
with the soli project and last year we
ran a pilot and we threw out this
challenge to you guys and you responded
incredibly we had over a hundred
applications from 20 different countries
around the world and we selected one
team from Australia they came with us to
VidCon we connected them to a bunch of
people but we're just getting side this
year we've had a crazy idea to travel
the world I guess doing like a global
talent search for the compassionate
problem solvers from everywhere
so in April starting on the first of
April we are gonna fly east round the
world in 30 days we're gonna stop in
Lagos Nigeria we're going to go to the
by New Delhi Shanghai Tokyo Rio and
wreck your pic with some crazy special
guests which we want to surprise you
with along the way but honestly it's
mental who's getting involved this year
so we want you guys to be there we want
to meet with you and jam these ideas
with you we're just trying to facilitate
and I guess be a catalyst for everyone
to kind of come together we're going to
be doing kind of like at a day event
where you guys can come along join us
it's going to be amazing
we would love artists and musicians from
the countries that were visiting to come
and bring their talents as well so that
we can have a really fun time together
thinking about what makes a difference
in the world what kind of ideas might
work and then at the end of the month on
the 28th of April we are going to be
launching the applications which is a
two-week window we're going to be
working with the UN they're going to be
helping us with people on the ground at
every place that we start we're also
partnering with the social Progress
Index so realizing that the world isn't
just about how much stuff you can make
and sell but how well our governments
and countries looking after their people
so if you're from one of those countries
they've mentioned or cities they want to
come and join great we're going to do
some fun events but if you're not we're
still wanting your ideas there's no
restrictions and their age restrictions
any backgrounds we will it all
absolutely
so we're sorry if we can get new you but
we couldn't get everywhere we've done
our best to try and get a real global
representation but here's the kicker
guys this year we're going to have a pot
of money that you can say how much that
you would want a bit to be able to get
your idea to the next stage and we're
going to be building a fellowship of
choosing seven ideas that we think we
can back and help grow over this next 15
year period of the next global goals
out back on the road I go about so this
year we're hoping that we're gonna get a
thousand applications from a hundred
different countries a truly global
talent search and so what ideas would be
good I hear you ask I have a certain
well I'll tell you we are looking for
any ideas that are creative or
innovative looking at the world a bit
differently about how you can make
people's lives better for the long term
so it could be using technology it could
be just seeing things differently it
could be getting different groups of
people together
don't be restricted and we are looking
for people who have come up with fresh
ideas you may have just thought of
something yesterday that totally
qualifies we want to help you get it to
the next step so look around your local
area what problems do you see and how
can you imagine in your wildest dreams
how can you imagine those big selves
basically so either your idea or if you
know of someone with an idea share this
video with them I'm gonna put all the
links to all the details to our partners
to the criteria to absolutely everything
in the description below but if you've
got any problems or questions email us
at hello and so be calm or tweet us on
our personal Twitter's fun for Louie
Weber Asmus and we are so excited to
meet you guys in person and to see all
of your ideas in video applications
coming back to us on the web yeah we're
excited
