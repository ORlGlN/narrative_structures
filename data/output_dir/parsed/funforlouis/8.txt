good morning guys
it's half past five in the morning span
an hour until the Sun rises so the
planet is we're gonna head to Lions head
and hike to the top for sunrise and
we're cutting it quite fine because I
think it's gonna take about nine minutes
to drive there about 45 minutes to walk
up so we should get there just maybe
like five minutes before the Sun pops up
it really fast but we couldn't leave
Cape Town today without doing this final
sightseeing tour
yeah and also this is the first for me
I've never hiked lines head in the
morning I should have only hiked it once
in the evening for sunset anyway let's
do this I've almost got the entire squad
I think a couple of people are waiting
behind bar yeah
all right joining us this morning is Tim
and rusick and yeah they came down
bright and early to join us got proper
squad about halfway up this is pretty
spectacular it's a very different
feeling from climbing up at sunset check
out this view behind me
okay oh that first bit was a bit of a
struggle to be honest I think only
having a banana for breakfast and two
hours sleep really hasn't helped I can't
believe there's some guys coming down as
we were coming up I don't know why they
would have stayed up for sunrise right
this is where we just walked from see
that right that's where we parked up
around there that's quite impressive
now how insane is this mind the Sun
popping through those clouds is just
like yeah I've never seen anything like
it
well interestingly guys there's more
people up here to sunrise in sunset
which I would have not guessed and
quickly would not guess that yeah there
must be like over 100 people out there
we just walked over to the other side to
get some shots from here oh yeah that's
cool it's definitely no longer sunrise I
think at this rate we're not gonna get
to the Safari tonight so I think we
should start heading down just give up
now
all right we made it
we've made it down how's that you guys
are just gonna crash out in the back
okay we're gonna head back to the house
pick up Aggie Michael Taylor is that the
only people we left maybe don't have a
quick shower quick or you know get
changed and then we're headed we are
running quite a bit later than we hoped
you could leave here but I'll make it
work anyway we we have to get another
car the Jeep that we had you had to
return so we've got this bigger car
which is actually better because we've
got a bunch of bags we're thrown in the
back so um thanks again to wiggle you uh
