have but that you listen carefully to
the words as you read them and sing them

for us in such a lowly way and I pray
you listen is God's words explain
tonight and I present this without great
richness to your Christmas
the readings from Luke chapter 2 verses
22 to 35 when the time came for the
purification rites required by the law
of Moses Joseph and Mary took him to
Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
this child is destined because the
falling and rising of many in Israel
