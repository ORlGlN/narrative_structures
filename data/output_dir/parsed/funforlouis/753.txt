hey I'm Alex and I'm in the pinstripes
in England and I live in the adventure
you know watch your father Louie boom
good afternoon guys
we've just jumped in Dave's red beast
and we're heading out to San Fran today
find some fun stuff today it's been a
late start to the day
we've just been chilling out and
recovering from our little road trip we
did hayden today days I'm good bro I'm
ready to take this bad boy on the on the
freeway as they call it here let's do it
alright first things first we are
popping into the discovery offices their
offices are in San Francisco those of
you that know I've signed with discovery
now they're helped me with plans and
future stuff and expanding all the
travel things are doing an adventure so
we're just popping in to pick up some
things that I've got delivered there
because I don't have an address and I
thought I just get delivered here and
then come pick them up when I'm with San
Fran so I'm gonna pop in to say hello so
I've got here to the office
I'm just chipping up some of the passes
that were right so I've just open up my
packages and Doritos UK send me a packet
of Doritos roulette they've heard that I
like spicy food so this is like a packet
which contains some hot chilli chips and
some tangy cheese and they want me to
give it a little go see what I think I'm
gonna offer it around just I'm just
gonna like hijack the office in here the
discovery office I'm going to go and
offer these around and hopefully a few
people will be in freely of a shot I'm
hoping these are actually spicy so let's
get okay
I got fast
boy see now that's easy
I got five people did it yeah man you
guys seen yet splashing whoa
go good picture oh you get one oh yeah
yeah I'm getting I'm getting where's the
water take it to Rio
do you a spot you want to achieve
yeah house why she says that is that
good heat if you like spice there's some
spicy ones and some cheesy ones that's
treating boys had a little nibble hey
give a go yeah yeah just keep going yeah
I know that good on nothing ah no yeah
yeah I guess right yeah I pretty much
got spicy ones every time I guess that's
the funny just creeps up in here men
yeah yeah it's good it's good level this
one another spicy flower okay follow me
now here
yeah yeah you go hang on yeah it's good
it's a good slice so the conclusion is
most people in the office actually
really like spicy food like me so there
wasn't any extreme reactions but if you
live in the UK and haven't got a high
spice tolerance you should enter the
Doritos roulette competition basically
submit videos and photos of yourself
eating the hot chilli crisp hashtag
Doritos roulette and yeah I've left all
the information in the description and
then later in the month only look
