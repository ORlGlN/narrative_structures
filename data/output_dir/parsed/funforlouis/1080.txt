we've had trouble getting this little
DVD audio system working and we just
rigged outs it's working now
we have arrived in the Welsh Talmud
lambda mo and we were our hotel
it's like carriage we balanced on the
edge of this cliff let's go see Josh's
room because I think this hotel I get my
own carpeted lift nice carpets on the
walls classic this is the penthouse
suite it's pretty cool over there
here's your mate Oh
right we decided it's dinner time
I'm gonna go and get a curry in Asia
right that was a very lovely couric
where it was I did after the rest of the
rice was it put me off road while within
a bit yeah does anyone know water
colored stuff is in the rice in curry
has the guessing is just found this
wealth tub Weatherspoon's and
unfortunately I'm wearing this Brazil
talk it's not deliberate but the Brazil
game is on and they're losing so I feel
not embarrassed but I just feel like
I'm not supportive but we also made some
well slash Australian friends hello
guys I've met another well friend this
is Zoe hey tell us about London though
what's there to do here you know a lot
apparently this is the best world quite
enjoying ourselves tonight what would
you tell the world that you could tell
them one thing
right apparently where we staying
tonight is a haunted hotel waitin why is
it haunted why is it haunted
so there's ghosts in the hotel George we
go ghost hunting tonight so we left the
guys at the club and we thought we'd
come back to get an early night but then
I was like oh you guys should probably
get to know Josh a little bit more and
George has been thinking about doing
some Q&A stuff anyway so I tweeted out
quickly little Q&A thing for Josh so
we're gonna ask some questions first
question Josh how did you two meet and
become friends I think we first met on
Louie's bus did we maybe maybe on your
bus but then we ended up living together
in a bit of a crazy house which was
awesome which I do
actually miss daily to be fair house
call demands in the center of this
community and it was it was amazing we
had like it was pretty crazy we had
loaded gun found in our garden we had a
machete found in a garden there was a
woman who we'd on our doorstep and we
actually amongst that chaos of the
council estate we were living in started
a YouTube channel yeah which was like a
monthly music event which is still or
not include the purple room so yeah that
was a good time and that was like that
was fun that was the pinnacle of our
service together than a very good yeah
okay I'm switching up a little bit
here's a bit of a deeper question what
advice would you give to someone who is
unsure about things in life Wow
I think it's it's hard and I think
everyone's always an unsure in life
because you know everyone's find in that
own way and I think it's difficult to be
really deeper than excellent then I
guess what's going on for them and stuff
but whenever I'm unsure in life I guess
you just have to remember that there's
only one of you and that always makes me
feel happy again you know sometimes like
actually a lot of the moments like I've
shared with you whether we're in Kenya
when we're in Alaska and sometimes
sitting under the stars at night and you
look up and you just you just think wow
how amazing is that and how small we all
are and it kind of really gives me
encouragement to just be happy in like
you know skin so Josh's new album is
called pillars and someone's asking why
why people it is a good question yeah
pillars it's actually from a story in
the Bible I wrote a song called pillars
it's not even on the album base the
under next album but I still wanted to
call it pillars because the story God
tells someone Abraham I think it is to
not look back and his family to not look
back at the city which they've just left
and I kind of really wanted to put it as
the title of the album because I kind of
don't want to look back the the year
which I wrote this album was a difficult
year for like many different reasons and
all the songs on it a part of my journey
and I just wanted to have it as a bit of
a pillar in time and not look back and
move forward and that's kind of like
that is my all the songs it's all my
kind of emotions from that time
and I don't want to go back there but I
dance so it's like okay look good that's
good right are we gonna rap out there
obviously there's a lot more you guys
can find out about Josh keep asking keep
tweeting hashtag ask Josh records and
the next couple of days while some
hanging out with him I can like throw
little questions during the day and we
can find out bit about Josh together
right I'm gonna it's quite late and I'm
gonna go on a little explore around this
hotel because apparently it's haunted
what are we going josh Josh LaDonna can
you see those clearance meter why Josh
I'm the ghost in there
