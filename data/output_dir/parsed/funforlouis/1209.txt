hey guys I'm Lorent from Temecula
California and you're watching truly so
this morning I've made my way to sing
killers beach house this is where I'm
staying the next of the days look at the
difference in size between my last room
and this room ridiculous this afternoon
I'm going flyboarding which is like that
water jetpack thing on the beach and I'm
quite excited about that actually got my
own balcony I can see the sea
so I've just skated antis and killers
Beach and I'm about to get kitted up to
go fly boarding which is basically a
like a water jetpack connected to a
board on my face and it looks incredible
who's gonna be so awesome
I'm going in the water I'm gonna swim
out to the jet ski
I've come to their swimming pool with a
spar over here hot water saltwater spa
ah well I've just come in from
flyboarding I managed to go into this
spa sit in the jacuzzi for a bit and the
steam room and warm up but it was an
incredible experience I highly recommend
it you ever get a chance and we're going
to grab a coffee now
exhilarating
I actually love this area to give
resources so beautiful
it reminds me a little bit of Santa
Monica in LA but with like a European
twist little coffee shops and I had to
get a couple of cheeky old cheeseburgers
for a snack before dinner cheeseburgers
are great snacks
riotous ducked into the laundrette to
wash some clothes
and the thing was done just need to put
them in the dryer now watch them die
well there's been chilling in the hostel
and I'm now gonna head out to some
dinner and find something delicious to
eat
right so I'm just chilling back at the
hostel and I'm talking to Darcy on skype
a Darcy how's England it's yeah I'm
holding out as long as possible before
coming back so doesn't I don't have to
be cold I miss you I miss you so much
what you been up to school high five
so I decided to have a chilled evening
tonight again catching up with people in
Skype
doing some bits and bobs and mainly
because I'm getting up super early in
the morning to go for a sunrise hot air
balloon ride I think I have to gather
like four or something maybe 5 a.m. so
decided don't go out just sleep sleep is
important but I am I'm really excited
about it cause I've never been in the
hot air balloon before and that's what
you can look forward to in tomorrow's

adventure
