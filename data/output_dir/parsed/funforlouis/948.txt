you start looking up benches in yours
and now you're watching it's my second
day in New York City and I am leaving my
friend's apartment and I'm actually
going to go and stay in Manhattan with
Lily because it was a bit of a mission
getting back here last night and getting
into Manhattan stuff so makes more sense

can I drink $5 as a great deal traffic
is crazy in New York City I just tried
to get a cab and they just took forever
but
I was going to get the Metro
I had this really bad twinge in my back
I don't know whether I slept funny or
deny I caught a nerve something I've got
I'm carrying my big backpack in this
little bag so that's why I grabbed a cab
because that
as motor case oh yeah
before I drop my bags off it's time to
go find a coffee there must be some
really a couple shops in New York I just
need to find them
I have wandered into Grand Central
Station so I hear it's quite person
this is conference
so it's snapchat someone to help you
find a cool coffee shop and I got a
reply on Twitter so I'm heading there
now
I just found this beautiful little mark
Bryant Park this is so little
this is undeniably New York City
literally everywhere I look there's
these towering skyscrapers
look at that and check what I just
wandered into like a thousand people do
yoga at the same time I wonder what this
was I thought is a big picnic it turns
out is yoga exercise I think I found the
coffee shop guys check out this amazing

iron without an ironing board it's very
very difficult now I turn on the table

I didn't think I'd be this day where I
take like an hour and a half to get
ready and the second I'm ready I'm like
generally that everyone else has to live
it but we must be so yeah it is
whether we're going down somewhere where

evening and now we're heading up for
some snacks because they didn't serve
hot chocolate in the bar we were and I
think we really were looking forward to
hot chocolate so I'm gonna try and find
some actually I do
probably need to get to this yeah it's
my favorite any three guys we found the
hot chocolate I thought there was the
only two choices were with marshmallows
or with salted caramel so he's gonna be
with marshmallows yeah the classic
choice we're hitting the milk step one
this is a recipe yeah this is house
playing oh joy make sure you stir it cuz
burnt milk is like the worst thing in
the world and then you get that skin on
it as well when it is hot lady
now you just pour the milk in where's
the chocolate I we didn't add the
chocolate no but we stir it in okay guys
I've never done this
jinae's Royale Cheers mmm perfect into
the night we for some stupid reason just
stayed up for like two hours just
chatting and it's now 4:30 in the
morning but tomorrow hopefully find
something fun today I've realized my
time in New York isn't gonna be like
super doing all the touristy things this
time although Darcy and my dad's are
arriving on Saturday morning we're going
to do some fun things but I definitely
want to come back for a good amount of
time and properly explore the city I
just think there's too much overwhelming
there's an overwhelmingly amount of cool
things today that I just don't even know
where to start but yeah we'll find
something fun to do tomorrow
capture that peace out enjoy life live
the adventure
