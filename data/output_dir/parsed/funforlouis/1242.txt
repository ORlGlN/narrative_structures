hi I'm Alexa I'm from New York and
you're watching fun for Louis I have
ever lie in this morning because of my
late night with Alan and color got
coffee
heading up to see my friend Andy who I
went to Romania with he runs regenerate
local times we both got some sad news
this morning
Batsy power station where we've been
parking both our buses he runs a youth
project and his bus like I was doing
before kind of you shootin off the air
battery power station who said we can't
park or buses in there power station and
God is there developing its
so we need to find somewhere else kind
of it in the South London area our buses
and it's very tricky so if any of you
guys know of anyone or your parents that
support charity and cows double-decker
buses other though there's like a big
land somewhere solution
I'll be cool
just filling their avanthi cup of coffee
he's got his beer
it's nice hanging over them they have a
little catch up he's doing some really
exciting stuff it's cool having them
inspirational people around doing a lot
of big things makes you want to dream
big you know for some reason have chosen
to drive further into London during rush
hour traffic
I always forget about rush hour traffic
because I usually drive at night so I'm
just like yeah driving stunt driving is
not fun in traffic can someone explain
to me how there's a block with the
videos here because I thought they went
bust but obviously not interesting
so me Finn and Gregor pops out for
dinner I wanted to land those but we've
had to set up repeater Express cousin
and oh this round
that was a delicious piece started enjoy
a piece of it may I add a matches what
did you say it was a little bit over the
top we've just been in the office for a
few hours Jack and Charlie came back
well it's been it's been good fun hasn't
been something super productive but it's
been a good creative hub going on and I
hopefully soon I'll be able to involve
you guys a little bit more in the in the
office space vibe but at the moment it's
it's early stages so we're just figuring
everything out
I've had to pull over because my radio
is overheating again I think basically
there's a small leak in the radiator so
I don't know if you remember last week
this happened but throughout the week
it's slowly the water leaks out and it
overheats so I'm gonna have to put some
special like fluid in there that blocks
small leaks so I have to buy some when I
get a chance I don't think it's a major
problem I just shouldn't overheat the
engine cause it might blow up with
something
Oh
it's actually dangerous to undo the
radiator thing when it's still hot
oh the steam yeah be careful guys
because this can burn this can scold you
I should have I should really wait for
the engine to cool down
last time I was doing this a few people
were saying you shouldn't pour water in
your radiator you need radiator fluid I
know
but water does work just not as well and
when it gets really cold then you don't
have any using water because it will
freeze and break pipes and stuff so I
will get some radiator fluid when I can
be bothered okay
hey guys look I just got back and I've
hit 200 thousand followers on Instagram
that is awesome
thanks everyone that followed me on
Instagram and if you're not follow me on
Instagram
look what you're missing out on before I
go to bed I thought I'd tell you about a
few things yesterday I mentioned I I'm
going to Australia I'm actually going at
the end of November and I'm hoping to
stay a few months I'm pretty much
migrating there whilst it's freezing
cold in England parent it's one of the
coldest winters like for a hundred years
