good morning guys is they six I think of
our prep leaving up to the world flight
and today there's lots going on we have
the plane here at Tracy Airport we're
getting the tank fitted the extra fuel
tank and the guys doing the vinyl wrap
have just arrived and already stuck on
the live the adventure logo on the tail
yes that looks so good it is exciting it
this is different by all the close up
it's nice because I get to see inside of
the airplane oh yeah I see stuff that I
wouldn't normally be able to see like
that here was some hydraulic to do it
let's get the crap out of me what is it
late
yeah but then Richard came over and we
felt all the joints and everything and
it's fine then I felt the hydraulics but
it's really good to be
morning Richard good morning good this
is looking so good I am pumped
it was it was okay one side is done
check it out these are responses that
are getting on board with the world
flight you notice there's actually a
little bit of room left
if anyone wants to join
just eating the vinyl around the rivets
every little thing we do just takes us
one step further to departing this is a
big one for me this really it helps me
feel like it's yeah I know this is just
as excited and it's just Snickers like
it has no effect on a safe flight or not
I think for me though putting the
stickers on it it really kind of
customizes the plane to be our plane and
it's oh my gosh so good especially the
live eventually go to bat that's just
the one we're gonna kind of get some
lunch now we've just been lent this
lovely truck
I love these trucks look the whole the
whole front seat you can fit like it's a
middle person the front seat
it's like a couch you look very American
right now
I managed to find Indian food I can't
believe you found it in ubud in Tracy
and it's actually really really
incredible and my name is upload my vlog
iswhat eaten and then we're heading to
Home Depot to get Sumer
I think we can we get that cap for the
fuel a lot of lies
that'll get us around the world safely
at Home Depot oh yeah there you go guys
you get anything I own a boat anyway
we've just got a cheeky coffee to go and
then we're back in the truck Bri let's
get some goof-off was a pro strength
goof off so we're like looking for like
a bathtub plug yeah about that big they
use it for like water tanks and stuff
we found it guys
it's called a two inch flexible cap
quicker that's exactly it
we're just getting a few tools some
essential tools for the flight
JP said we need an adjustable wrench I
found this guy in that's way like three
kilograms oh my gosh okay you can show
do you only need one this big you could
almost probably crush them it's kind of
an interesting thing knowing that this
machine I'm entirely trusting my life to
obviously JP as well and trusting my
life too but to know that this is gonna
carry us around the world I feel like I
don't know I feel like this is bond
happening with me right now
on the plane I feel like there's a lot
of deep kind of respect you know
as we now may be calling her Balu maybe
she's actually he hello it's weird cool
vehicles like a gender female or male
but maybe yeah maybe it's a guy and it
is our dude
Balu I was just telling JP over lunch
that I'm in such a good mood and I think
a big part of it is that for so many
months even though this has been getting
planned I've had so many other projects
on and I've been thinking about loads of
other things like the barsen and now
arriving here and having kind of caught
up almost caught up my blocks all of my
attention is on this world fly
everything is focused on this project
and I just feel fantastic because of
that I think having your attention split
between different things
I mean it's called to have a few things
happening in your life but to be solely
focused on one thing you're passionate
about yeah been a while since I've had
that so I feel very alive
all right JJ's just screwing some panels
special on this is like a sauna is it at
least I don't need to go for a run
tonight yeah
make sure you screw them I'm really good
boy
well the thing is is I'm having to like
fine screws a bit and I know it's not
the ones that were there before so I
mean hopefully Oh skipper
if not we can get some capital that's
good that's a toy
aeroplane held together with gaffer tape
Oh
I've I've hijacked a desk in their
office again just to get some work done
because I can't really help right now
because I don't know anything about
aeroplane mechanics or kind of repairing
the interior or building anything so I'm
just cracking on with who I know best
video editing
okay guys it's finally time to fit the
tank it's probably only like another
half hour of light so it's gonna happen
to happen fast
JB's been hard at work getting all the
piping feared I got the red strapped in
the red tape and the red and red parties
going off for the color scheme of the
plane oh the red pump but no know if you
realize yet that this is how we're
getting your Field Manual nothing you're
gonna pump the fuel so it's not like
flicking the switch and having like an
electric pump you're gonna be doing this
the whole flight and the flames going
down you're like public pressure it is
wrong unless you do two pumps and you
pressurize the tank and then he pumps
the fuel up in the wing no big deal okay
then one you need to do another pump
like one every 10 minutes 15 minutes is
nice so it's less than two days before
we depart and I'm feeling really pumped
like I think every day we get closest
leaving I'm feeling more and more
excited about the trip I can't believe
it's finally happening after like years
of trying to make this happen and trying
to convince people to help us make it
happen we're here we've actually pulled
it off well not quite but we're at the
brink of pulling this off and
I think the thing that excites me most
about this trip is we have really no
idea who we're going to be meeting the
experiences we're going to be having as
much as we've tried to plan obviously we
haven't been able to like plan an exact
schedule we know roughly the countries
were going to we don't know really what
we're going to be doing in these
countries but obviously with this aim to
share stories and find incredible people
and at this point with so much
uncertainty but also we literally can go
anywhere we have our own plane well
pretty much anywhere we have three
months ahead of us
dedicated to doing this there's not many
things in my life where I have a three
month period to do anything I'm used to
traveling at such a fast pace and we've
got like a week here or you know two
weeks at most but to have three months
focused on one mission although we're
going to be traveling very fast to be
focused on one mission it's just yeah
it's just so exciting yeah I know this
is kind of doesn't weigh anything
yes but it would be attached already yes
touch me so and we're gonna have a host
that goes up a little bit or else has to
read a few and then it goes down between
the seats on the floor I'm gonna be over
there so you can pull up pull up so
that's how it's gonna be
say tomorrow morning so we've been back
up on motel for the whole evening
JP probably went to sleep about four
hours ago but I've been up editing
yeah I always edit best at night because
I'm not disturbed I can just focus in
there's nothing happening around
everyone else is asleep I'm not missing
out on anything only problem is it means
our body clocks are out of sync and he
wants to go in to start working the
plane at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow which is in
like three hours and I told him before I
stayed up all night at the pear I would
join him at 6:00 a.m. so let's see if
that happens or not anyway tomorrow is
our last day we yeah I have to do a bit
more work on the plane I think we have
to get some oxygen in the tank so we're
at high altitude we can breathe oxygen
other than that we're pretty much ready
to roll maybe one bit of paperwork and
then the plan is in about one day and
nine hours or something so yeah like 33
hours we will be departing leaving Tracy
Airport hopefully going past curved
Valley which the is the official start
location because that's where we're
ending and yeah that's gonna be the
beginning of the trip and I am so pumped
I'm so excited
all right catching the morning
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
