Sydney and we are heading to get some
breakfast I am in some weird clothes I'm
wearing track suit because I washed all
my clothes there Anthony's house last
night but I didn't think about them

maybe have to go and buy some cheese and
some other clothes but it's a lovely
summer's day in the hood this right it's
raining it's raining

okay I think we've got birth task
complete got some genes we're now
heading to get Rachel a MacBook because
I haven't told you guys yet but the
reason she is here and not in Australia
anymore
is that she has come to be part of team
thumb for Louie and she's helping me
write some stuff because writing isn't
my main skill I like videos but I
understand that some people like to read
instead of watch videos so Rachel's
going to help me with writing different
things one of which I told you guys the
blogs and to do that we need a laptop so
always look at the new MacBook Airs they
are absolutely tiny but they don't have
USB ports which could be a problem we're
gonna yeah we're going to try and figure
out whether this is an option we have a
computer we have one Thank You Apple
next on the list a SIM card for Rachel
it's going to be trapping for a while
mainly in London and American stuff
they're getting a free SIM card
