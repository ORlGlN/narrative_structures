good morning guys I skip the game Drive
this morning I think we all did actually
catching up on some rest
we're just arrived at cheater Ridge
which is the next lodge and the last
Lodge of staying up I was given mice of
a Cold War
I'm so excited guys we've literally just
arrived there and we're getting spa
treatments a good deep tissue massage oh
yes
yeah you ready for this there's no bad
out hey mate Rondo is it that pet
Trimble's it's trying to clean Nick
sonic please do you even have a
toothbrush you can just get a pet bird
can you live in that bird girl you say
tame so this little bird has kicked out
of its nest by cuckoo and these guys
don't have to raise it from a little
baby chick it's like a month old now and
the plan is
hopefully it'll learn to fend for itself
so it's just learning to fly lens the
fly so today's a pretty chilled one
because we think on the game drive this
morning we haven't got another drive
till like 6 p.m. so we're just gonna be
relaxing at the lodge got a bit more
editing to do this is like just
beautiful alright just arrived at our
little brim and I spot some warthog net
chicken awesome yeah
guys are being allowed to hang on to
Alan so I guess he's living in meinem
rise room that cool with you Alan it's
birdie your loving life right now
yeah yeah I think every lodge we've
gotten to he's just got like better and
better
yeah I just want to get Alan back I had
to take Alan but I kind of wanted to
stay in our room tonight guys I'm a
little bit disappointed in Alan right
now he just peed on me and then when I
was showing in the poo and telling him
it wasn't acceptable he jumps in it and
starts throwing it around with this Alan
come back okay Allie where you trying to
go to Yellin it's happening again guys
this is the third of time he peed on my
hand and the moisture Alan is helping me
do some editing
Oh
I was just walking back to the lodge
from my room I supported these
wildebeest just over the fence just
close out with her babies I need to be
careful walking in this long grass
because apparently there's lots of
spitting cobras around here and
scorpions I don't touch the fence cuz
this is very high voltage electricity
right all right dinner we've got some
champagne Laura's gonna pop the bottle
amazing this is so fancy yeah I think we
were gonna eat outside but it's been
raining mostly afternoon so we've had to
move in sighs this is lovely little
paraffin lamp and three-course meal
Oh guys check out this fruit salad that
is the most awesome looking fruit salad
of it we just got back to our room and
found the bath slightly full with some
rose petals then maybe there's an animal
in there what and the sink what are we
doing I'm sorry confuse if this truck is
this trying to be romantic isn't they I
guess but we have a safari in like ten
minutes I'm really confused
I'm not really I'm not really up to date
with like romance things is this
romantic yeah time
whoa
Wow guys
that is a massive fajita well it's
definitely worth going out on that night
drive even if it was just to see that
hyena incredible
it's a shame with him for Leopard but it
was cool to see some signs that had been
around and apparently the night before
they'd heard it
growling around that vicinity but it's a
very rare animal to see but also the
hyena apparently is like super rare and
it was a massive one
we can't help again in like in like five
hours to do a morning drive and I think
we're going to get to see some rhino and
hear a little bit about some of the
conservation work and protection of the
Rhino
in South Africa and so I'm really
looking forward to that and I'm gonna
head back now and try and try and get
some rest
it's pretty exhausting doing these
really early mornings but like I've said
before is it's definitely worth it right
I'll see in the morning peace out
enjoy life live the adventure
