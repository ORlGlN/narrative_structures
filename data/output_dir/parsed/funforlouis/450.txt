so guys we're here in Shanghai and China
doing a 360 video of our visit to the
jingim temple Dave's here with me we're
just gonna have a little wander around
this is pretty incredible Wow
so over here we've got incense sticks so
I guess this is like offering up prayers
to some of the gods I think this is a
Taoists temple from what I understand
so there's burning incense here people
put them in the fire over there
they're throwing coins into this
monument in the middle of the in the
middle of the temple check this out
good shot I'll know maybe not Dave I
want to have a go this yeah I have
they've I took I believe in you bro okay
I think you can get this joking Dave
okay all right so it's your lucky
pheasant okay oh okay
this is harder than it looks but I don't
know how old grannies do this little
granny yes bro
you got it oh this isn't disrespectful
this thing's we're just trying to join
in the tradition you know it's also kind
of fun
When in Rome do you reckon this whole
pot it's just full of coins
judging by how difficult it is to get
yeah finding traditional buildings here
in Shanghai has been very difficult yes
brother yeah because it's a very modern
city I think apparently even 50 years
ago it was it wasn't even really a city
from what I had before I've heard and
then there's just skyscrapers everywhere
it's super urban metropolis built up now
so it's a bit refreshing being able to
walk into a temple like this
it's like peaceful and yeah it's a bit
of a an old traditional vibe going on
should we take a walk up these steps I
love this I hope you guys enjoy this 360
experience of traveling a bit more
immersive what I love is the intricacy
of the architecture like the wooden
carvings all of this kind of stonework
here and you just know there's like
hundreds of thousands of hours of work
gone into it Wow check out this
humungous Buddha
Wow
well maybe this is a British temple yeah
doesn't look like it not at hours I
think it might be but it's just a bit of
a risk to take
sighs excuse my ignorance if I've got
any other facts wrong but I think we're
now thinking maybe this is a bit of
temple not a towers temple but we're
gonna find out that the problem is a lot
of the posters and facts are in Chinese
in Mandarin yeah this is something I
wish if I could click my fingers I wish
I was fluent in multiple languages it's
quite awesome kind of having a window
into other people's culture and beliefs
and all that this excuse for a monk but
I think that's a month
this temple was first built in 247 ad in
the wer Kingdom during the Three
Kingdoms period of ancient China bro we
stumbled across an awesome place this
morning okay okay here we go it was
relocated to its current site in 1216
during the Song Dynasty the current
temple was rebuilt in the Queen
Jose Qi ng Qin Dynasty Wow and then the
renovation was completed in 2010 well
there you go guys a brief but
fascinating tour of the jingim temple
