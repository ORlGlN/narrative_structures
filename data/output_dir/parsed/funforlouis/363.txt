good afternoon guys we have come down
today to some caves near ruse a with
rose family her grandparents auntie and
her dad and apparently these caves are
incredible I saw them briefly in right
it's vlog from a while ago you know any
cool facts about the case of going to
well I'm just going to tell you really
cool story that my grandpa has told me
he came here as like a school vacation
holiday thing when he was 8 years old in
his school it's like way over that hill
and they walked here
they had like a horse-drawn carriage
that carried all the lunches and stuff
and all the little kids were walking
behind to them all day together
no way
guys shut us out human remains they say
how long have been that there were
humans here between 200,000 and 40,000
years of trouble you see it was it it is
the other thing what you found I
remember from last time I came these are
all bear scratch marks
there were cave bears that were living
in here before the humans were it's
crazy and this material of the wall like
makes it really easy to scratch into but
then it lasts for absolutely ages so
this has been here for hundreds of
thousands of years basically crazy yeah
we were reading about these caves the
power in this 14 species of bats in here
I haven't seen any yet but that's pretty
awesome
let's take the battle
where did he go
I'm happy I remembered my hoodie because
it's 14 degrees in here all year round
which is a little bit chillier than it
is outside but I'm fine I'm not some
crazy you warm enough
chilly but I feel it just feels like
there's a scene it feels like I'm in
America in a store where the a season
blasting for like 70 years tell me what
you just told me oh my dad show me that
they hold concerts here like they've had
bands the acoustics and stuff it's just
the most epic event ever imagine that
I'm I'm setting up a band there I'm sure
is that it just like that
guys what's this called I know this
talax place and stuggle Stalag moist i
common which way is it is around I've
literally learned this ten times but
there's also another name apparently for
these rock formations where they're
joining so I guess it's dripped so long
that they've met in the middle because
normally like it drips and then lands on
these things and then it builds up over
time like the sediment but how long has
it been built forming million years
where'd you get it lost this would be
crazy I think I'll make it through this
guys this is tiny this is so darling
literally hit by a truck
you're also insanely tall yeah
whoa this is just getting smaller
smaller okay yeah why didn't they build
this place I know my toaster box oh my
gosh woman that he hits you yeah yeah oh
that is hers man this dude has the
coolest adventure huh
literally looks like an explorer yeah
that was really cool look so look at
this beautiful
so like Riya was saying before her
grandpa came here in 1952 with his
school and it's before they even opened
it to the public I didn't realize so
they had them torches like flashlights
and none of it was like prepared like it
wasn't there like with the lights
lighting up the rocks and stuff I think
I'd like to do some cave explorations
like that
Oh although it would be pretty scary it
would be scary to go in there without
like a guide and light stuff does anyone
know how you'd track your way back out
other than like leaving flags or
painting on the wall is there like a
special way that people find their way
back out caves when they're exploring
it's just this if ik question yeah there
might be some cave explorers watching
right onto the next activity for today
we are going to church which has been
cut out of a cliff face so it's really
high up and it's got amazing views and
yes can be pretty epic
tell us about this place okay this is
the translation from Bulgarian so are
enough winning everything perfect but
there was a saint I believe that lived
here in these caves and he lived here
for a long time people came here and
like prayed to him and fed him and
everything
this is where my might was where my
grandma's from and where my grandpa's
been and where we just were
this is where he walked but he was like
7 my face no it's definitely feels like
I could be part of a movie set
it must have filmed movies in it feels
like something out of like Lord of the
Rings or something
the monk that used to live in when he
died the Russians took his bones and
when they were traveling through Romania
with them there was an epidemic and
people were dying but then they were
getting healed where wherever the bones
were going so this is a particularly
special place for Romanian say to keep
the bones in Romania diseases we really
need them to help heal our people so the
Russians left them and now they're like
a symbol for them sweet tip that's why
we just saw a Romanian family here
this church building has been here since
the 12th century and they build them
into the cliffs like this because they
can't be torn down easily the Bulgarians
my was continually under attack where I
was saying because is such a strategic
point from Europe to Asia so loads of
Empires be coming through and I think
when the Turkish Empire conquered
Bulgaria they tore a bunch of churches
now so it's much harder to tear these
buildings down there like within the
clips I think is pretty awesome
I think the ceiling is like rocks and
then people are leaving little prayers
and money
love all these little rooms little
business so then a huge fire no heed of
spiders ID hey these doors are made just
for you uh man we film the difference
are in that oh my gosh it just made for
my shoulder you miss me so much
yeah they must offend yeah
you learn to swim in this river it goes
down to the villages where they grew up
yes we did we go tiny here you can just
pick them up we played with the kitten
now we're playing with a puppy I think I
think Mariah likes puppies more oh hello
what is this magical place where all the
animals are babies is this it
it is this heaven I think he's my baby
he's so soft
hey what are you doing where you dance
my finger can we take him
this is holy water yeah this takes ages
to fill no oh it's actually just a tap I
thought it's like a well where is it
always comes out are you in your happy
place right now Coffee is Muffy's
coffee holy place
I think we should start our kitten and
puppy monastery yes with all the coffee
but I'm going to teach you about a
Bulgarian tradition see these bracelets
that are tied into this tree you see
these it's like one here just one here
there's so many twirl there's so many
over here okay basically Ryder's told me
on the 1st of March people put those
bracelets on their wrists and then when
they see the first blossom they tie the
bracelet onto the tree and then I guess
it never comes off does ever get taken
off the tree usually not maybe in the
winter it falls off when it's like
snowed on and stuff but yeah so you put
it on the tree where you see the blossom
and what's the meaning oh you make a
wish yeah that's like celebrating spring
cool
we have just driven to the top of a big
hill and arou say and we're looking over
it the clouds are blocking the Sun set
up he's pretty spectacular hello hello
yeah
so guys that land over there the other
side of the river that is Romania and
tomorrow we're going to be driving -
