today we're off to the beach
we've just filled up but full tank of
fuel with seven pounds it'd be like 70
pounds or more in English that's like
ten times cheaper to buy fuel Oh
we're now driving into an extensive
desert so I don't write down and get
stranded so we just stopped off for a
little toilet break because we're all
desperate at the toilet and we are
literally in the middle of the desert
we just arrived at this resort and the
beach on the Red Sea we're going to
wander around and see there's somewhere
to lie down on the Sun and chill out and
have a nice cold drink swim that drive
was crazy was just desert like a hundred
miles an endless desert look at this
cheeky crow ah
so we've discovered this really nice
little resort and we've just been
chilling the Sun a little dips in the
ocean and having enough amazing enough
because I am left my swimming shorts in
my bag which was left at the airport
I've had to do all my swimming including
today in my boxer shorts just hope no
one noticed

watching the sunset it's been an amazing
day on the Red Sea
