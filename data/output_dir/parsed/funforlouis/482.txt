and welcome to Iceland of final stop
we're staying here for like a week so
they've got stopped you down today got a
big event tomorrow minutes done yeah and
then we're staying from my birthplace my
birthday tomorrow well is sunny
that's very chilly very fresh we've just
bought some tickets to get into town on
the box and then we're gonna walk from
there to a hostel
justa crescent later we can check well
I've been resting up for like three or
four hours just um catching up and sleep
because I did not sleep in the plane now
I'm heading down to the social area I
think if you people started arriving for
our ideas Jack also our friend Alex is
arrived because after these next couple
of days we are doing a birthday road
trip guys we've had an incredible
turnout I'm bad at counting quickly but
like say people we're and yeah we're
gonna go if we're starting little bit
earlier than advertised but with yeah
this is great I'm really excited to hear
from people hello everyone what is it
like from your experience to to live
here what what do you love about it what
could be different what could you
improve if politics here are kind of
like we don't discuss things we kind of
just state things we are not very good
at discussing things and like coming to
the solution yeah we often talk about
things but we never do anything about it
we whine and talk about how everything
is so terrible but nobody ever seems to
have an initiative to do anything about
it and I think that's our biggest
problem is standing together we're such
a small country but still you have a
very hard time just sticking together
and doing something about the problems
that we're all whining about we've got
long Ben winters and short summers I
think that comes a like we've got long
periods of dark times and I feel like
that comes into like the whole country
goes into a kind of depression seasonal
depression is a big thing
and uh not a lot of people speak about
it this semester I had a bit of a
problem with depression and I kind of
just quit right at the end and I'm gonna
fail all my classes but I just the
school was just pushing me over the edge
and I decided to let myself just push
myself back and let my that my
depression get a little bit better
before I try so hard to be perfect
people need to go to therapy and we
maybe could help maybe get people
therapy for less money or a good start
would be to raise awareness I think
about the wait hospital waiting rooms
now they're using like the garages as
waiting rooms they have like seperated
the garages of the emergency room and
put like pets to put people in there
because the hospitals are full and the
country doesn't have enough money to
like make the hospital figure like my
mom she like ruined her name me she fell
and she went to the hospital
and she went home with the sock like
underneath as you waited for four hours
just for once off and it just got worse
as he came back three days later and she
got a sock again and then she came a
week later and math with like her doctor
and he was like no we have to have
surgery and now she has to wait like one
half year to get surgery for me and she
was like waiting in the garage so I
think we should put more money to the
hospitals to the people that work there
and we were talking about we would love
if we would start something like raising
money to put two hospitals and just try
to fix some things yeah just do small
things will become a big one like
and you start that everybody like the
bottles that they have everybody gives
that to a special organization all that
money goes to the hospital just small
things here and there that will help
start to raise the money we can talk
about some of the problems but I think
unless you guys are passionate about
seeing those change it takes those
people that are willing to stand up and
say you know this isn't good enough and
I want to fight for it and I'd encourage
you guys to search for things in your
heart and just think okay what do I
really care about and we can like list
you know so many problems in the world
and in this country and in our own lives
but I think maybe it's about to stop
just starting with one the social
Progress Index gives the country a score
out of a hundred and overall you guys
get 87 0.62 which is the UN global goals
is to try and get every country to score
kind of around 75 so you guys on average
like smash it compared to the goal to
get everybody up to a living standard
that's acceptable and then it breaks it
down basic human needs like water
electricity then opportunity sort of
Education Employment and then
foundations are well being things like
personal freedoms and ability to express
yourself and things like that
and you guys are 87 on overall which is
4th in the world so that's how you get
ranked so you're pretty doing pretty
damn well
Wow
that was pretty crazy do you know where
we go yes that's why the president's
residence yeah guys so home told you
this yep
I don't ever have any way please we've
had to cut this this session a little
bit shorter just an interlude yeah it's
an interlude until later on
tell us why Dave why are we well we've
been invited to the president's
residence for a reception for all the
speakers for tomorrow's conference
called what works where if all goes to
plan we will be presenting with the
Prime Minister so the president is like
the Queen I think like kind of head of
state and so what was cool though is at
the end of the jam we got to say to the
guys this is an after you shared all
these things for two hours is there
anything you would like us to go and
speak with the president about which I
never thought I'd really get to say to a
bunch of people and they said yeah they
want to know about health care they feel
concerned that it's not good enough and
they want to know where the taxes are
going so we're gonna try and see if we
can have that conversation I don't know
what this is gonna be like but let's
give it a go yeah I don't if we can film
either but try
I only have one shirt this is crazy
berry berry right what's the deal with
filming Dave so this guy is the
president of Iceland yes so underdressed
is unreal
we just rocked up in very casual
clothing everyone else isn't suits who's
the presidential name with Obama felt
very out of place I don't know but we
had like a good long chat with the
president unfortunately he wasn't too
keen on us filming that discussion but
it was really fascinating and inspiring
and overwhelming and an honor to be
included I can't believe we just
strolled in there and we're just chillin
with all those important people from
around the world that are coming
together for this event to look at
what's working around the world
especially they were talking a lot about
a renewable energy and stuff
all the jam sessions done you're done
now yes brother all around the world in
30 days yeah hold it up that is amazing
but we are we are heading out to the
level carry on our chat from earlier
because I did feel like we we had to put
a pause on that just to go and be mr.
president
is the present
good chats today man and we wrecked what
they asked us to to the president and he
gave us a considered full answer and
what respect right we've picked up we've
picked our friend Alex
Yoel I didn't actually intro you earlier
because we just don't strain to the job
yeah say that again
anyone can do that anyone can go up to
the President's House knock on the door
and just say can I have a coffee with
the president and if he's free he'll
invite him in and let him come another
cup guys it's gone 11 p.m. and look look
