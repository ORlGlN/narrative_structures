I'm feeling a little bit better today I
am heading to hospital to get my
dressings changed because they're kind
of falling off and getting my sheets
dirty and stuff so I need to do that
because it's dry can we sit I mean the
question is on keeping it wet and I just
put this on it is it better for us to
dry out yes okay I think that's going to
be fine because I'd quite like to there
- yes how does that feel better right
sticking in bitch it should be alright
all done
come on new bandage is on I feel so
great I'm now heading out to see Dave
Dave and me are going to go visit one of
his friends who's apparently pretty cool
and chat about our plane idea and buying
lands and all of that jazz I'm quite
excited yes they hate it

going to go see today so we are going
over to Reigate to see my mate Vince who
is basically like the real-life I am I'm
Tony Stark
Tony Stark the real-life Tony Stark yeah

bikes that I think about 50 miles an
hour

sensitive oh maybe yeah that he breaks

shoelaces no brains but you got to tie
your shoelaces yeah go no go
