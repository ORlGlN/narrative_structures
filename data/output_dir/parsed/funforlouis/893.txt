here's a rainy day today but I'm still
hoping to go out boating with my friend
Andy so I'm gonna head up to London now
see if we can get a boat on the river
slugga Andy's car got big battery an
electric motor which we're going to test
out today hopefully works and a winch
just in case we get in trouble so we're
gonna drive around the back getting the
boat
there's a cat living in the boat oh
that's hilarious hilarious hey he was
having a nice little sleep in there I
think well Wow
okay well we found the plug just
draining out the water from inside and
just poking up I'm gonna pull this boat
around
cool I get it baby on the river

this is an this is a little too safe
what on earth the rim is so high
where's the road go guys it looks like
this is a river here but in fact the
river is not supposed to be here yeah

have to bite the bullet and go oh go

freezing oh it's freezing
Oh Andy I've committed how do we know
where the river start
so guys I just pulled out my phone we're
looking at Google Maps Street View to
see what the situation here is because
it's just all underwater I say there's a
big slope following this whole road so
we can just basically back the boat up
these guys forgot to put the plug in the
boat and start lowering it back I heard
it bubbling put the plug in and he's got
the winch that's about I've got the
right and he's gonna lower the boat in
I've got to make sure I don't let go
that right always the bait will just fly
