good morning boys we are heading off I
don't know where we're going we've
arrived at the first project we're
seeing today and this is an interfaith
groups and his children from the
Christian and Muslim faith and they have
come together and United so they're
going to do a little performance for us
this morning play some music but yeah
like I'm saying yesterday this is this

lot you just hear a lot of segregation
and disunity between different papers
but this is it is awesome
music

belly's we might have lost our mother
ever thought miss Bernice engine saw
Jess I've been
we are taking a break from the kids

cultural performance that's going on no

Ebola outbreak so everyone's
super-excited
amazing guys I'm getting some awesome
360 footage as well which i'll be
uploading soon this is mr. Shivaji the
whole village is loving this because
like I said earlier they haven't seen
this performance in like a year
excitement levels are high why did they
stop this during Ebola it was their part
of the in my density revolutions yeah
regulations okay take note to bring
drugs or drink Oh hard water we're
ducking away ceremony hey crazy hot hair
crazy
what an amazing experience incredible
spas are children in this community
during the Ebola crisis they were out in
school for nine months and they wanted
to do something useful at that time so
they started a nurse children savings
group in Sierra Leone so they're going
to tell us today how much money they
saved and how much they've enjoyed be
cool so the importance of this youth
saving pub is that in these rural areas
they don't have banks right and they
also don't get to all about personal
finance and about saving money so what
this time do is the adults that have
these saving groups and they're like
mini banks where lots of people put in a
regular amount of money and then you can
take lines and that group makes interest
a small interest in the lines and so
what they've done is modeled that and
created a child version of it where
children can put in small amounts of
money and I've got this kind of
collective together so this is the
savings box three of the kids need to be
present at the same time to open the box
because there's three separate locks
very secure it's like those movies where
you see the mall turn the key at the
same time okay so this is where you keep
the money how much money have you gotten
your savings club $300 cool and how many
members do you have
twenty-one members brillion well good
job guys keep saving during the period
that schools are closed world vision
distributed 30,000 radios so kids could
have like lessons over the radio so this
is one of those radios I always wind up
as well is this your radio show me show

not teaching any lessons right now cool

heading off nice to meet you all thank
you and thank you for your work thank
you all right we are leaving this town
it's been an amazing morning I've
learned a lot been great to see the
projects that are going on here and the
high morale despite the terrible things
that happen in this country thank you
I was stopped at a checkpoint I think
we're getting our temperature taken
again so I forgot to mention guys we are
heading back to Freetown now so we left
Bo the place has been saying the last
couple of days we're heading back to the
main city because tomorrow morning we
are ending our trip here and we are
flying back to the UK but this main road
back to Freetown is where they have a
lot of these checkpoints and stuff off
swear we have to keep getting our
temperature taken and washing our hands
and stuff it's good it's good they got
these procedures in place and this is
what is saved a lot of the areas from
contracting Ebola because if at these
safety measures there
it's not me Japan is like I said okay
that is just playful cool thank you
we're back in freetown just dropped our
bags in the hotel and now we're heading
out for dinner
the rain is crazy on the way back
the thing in the restaurant there's a
lightning storm going on outside and
suddenly all the electricity cut out and
there was a massive thunder like Oh
outside and I think probably one of the
power transformers has been hit by
lightning that's why I reckon crazy so
the electricity's back on we're all good
a little cheeky apple crumble for
dessert and a copy
we're back from dinner and I have had an
incredible day guys it was so awesome
seeing the village that we visited
celebrating and they was like crazy guys
dressed up in the acrobats and the
drumming and stuff it's so cool to see
that because the timing just worked out
amazingly that we arrived just as they
lifted the sanctions or they lifted
another level of sanctions literally
last week which meant that they can meet
in public and have markets and have like
town gatherings so it was a real fear of
celebration and I guess defeating this
as a community and especially after this
last year of must have been really hard
like not for some of the children not
going to school and just life not being
what it was and then for it to slowly be
getting back to normal again it's just
it was incredible to see that firsthand
to be part of that and yeah one amazing
day what a great time of that we're
actually heading back to London via
Paris and actually voice somewhere else
like I don't even know but we're leaving
at lunchtime tomorrow we're going to
hopefully go and check out our market in
the morning I'll see you then peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure
