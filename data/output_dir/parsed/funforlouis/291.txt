snake the YouTube space as well she's
speaking under penalty somewhere else I
think we're gonna meet earlier they use
my space it's very cold today so I've
got my big our teacher
here we are so we've arrived at the
YouTube space planner to find myself a
little falafel wrap a little bit hangry
on the train because Niro Katherine Nero
had no vegan options at all how to get a
muffin bar good now and I'm just about
to start the event I've got a plan oh
it's free so there's gonna be a couple
of hours and just learning a little bit
about what today is it's gonna be some
pretty heavy topics very important
amazing accomplishments and wonderful
photos and perfect life out there for
others to see and that can create a
feeling that we are not good enough and
that is something that I think everyone
struggles with in this day and age not
only as individuals but also as
companies Roya has arrived she's gone
back in that with my other camera as I'm
about to go on and all next on this game
going top
the do your shopping done it's a new
jumper
Hannah's joining in the pana as well
you excited this is Louie Cole who Casey
Neistat was the you know most famous
loggers in the world as well um this is
the grandfather of daily vlogging right
young to be a grandma but Louie really
did write the book for the daily
vlogging format you've been producing
you know daily videos for a really long
time yeah and so Louie's mission is to
make every day count make every day an
adventure and he does that and he does
an amazing job with his channel and he's
loved around the world but he's also
recently started a platform with a
friend around social change so maybe you
can tell us about your story
yeah I'm going to start I guess I've
always had this passion for doing social
good from when I was young I guess as a
lot you may be in the same position my
parents were taught me from a young age
like it's about caring about the world
around you and I think for me
along with travel comes meeting people
from all different types of backgrounds
seeing the reality of some places and
the suffering people are going through
and just seeing where there's obvious
places that we need to shed light on in
terms of sharing people's stories and
situations and educating people and
educating myself and learning from
people myself so I've tried my best to
share that whole process from a very
personal perspective like just you know
arriving somewhere not knowing something
about what's going on asking people
sharing kind of how I've responded or
like one learning and I've tried to take
my audience along kind of with with me
on that journey right we finished the
panel that's pretty awesome um I've just
been asked to come home to this
Christmas set in the YouTube space and
we were in Rio gonna film something
what's this for
Christmas gift we're making 25 gifts
gonna release one every day in December
where it was a guy just on Twitter yeah
okay cool yeah I love it right things
are wrapping up here in the YouTube
space we've just had a couple of hours
of amazing networking with people from
all over the world yeah doing incredible
things like working with human
trafficking staff or you know just
people here are basically representing
organizations that are the kind of
people I want to connect with it's like
I've just got a lot of contacts for now
when I travel to just tomb deeper things
engaging evil and a better level and
share the stories with you guys so yeah
lots of cool things and we're now
getting kicked out but me and Rio are
sticking around the next couple of days
to take part in this conference about
women's equality I don't know exactly
what this conference is called yeah they
know more about it tomorrow but it's
it's cool to be invited and included in
this stuff and we are now gonna go and
meet with my family because my dad's
birthday today and we're gonna go and
have a meal together somewhere
we have successfully checked into our
hotel

like disease and that why do you like a
girl as I thought like a whole one etc
being in many of you are we gonna do
beat disease can't be request it very
delicious
it
it's fun wasn't it and also we are
insanely jet-lagged I'm surprisingly
lasted that long
I was fell asleep before we even went
out
we're also debating whether to do some
editing tonight or tomorrow just tired
then editing takes like twice as all
here sunny bits like as good quality you
can reduce out of it two things here to
bed and then maybe let us
yeah maybe maybe people do that maybe we
do this enjoy because
we're never early risers and you can
just like enjoy it now and kind of make
used tonight
yeah yeah because it's not gonna last
long I'll be a few days and then we'll
be back to normal in a fat another guys
it isn't even midnight yeah it's only
24/7 and we are crashing this is a very
rare situation where I'm going to sleep
before midnight so yeah it's weird
really weird tomorrow and like I said
it's gonna be this very full on day I'm
trying I don't know how it's been for
today guys watching the vlog it's
probably just been a bit little snippets
of people sharing stuff and yeah it's
not as easy to vlog days like today but
it's been very cool Network wise one of
the exciting things about tomorrow is
I'm potentially going to interview a
Nobel Peace Prize winner so I'll keep
you informed about that I hopefully that
can happen and yeah there'll be some
little snippets of people sharing things
and yeah hopefully lots of inspiration
I'll try and cut it together in an
intriguing you know engaging way for you
guys but it's gonna be pretty full-on
the first thing tomorrow the first
sessions actually to do with them like
child slavery of something pretty heavy
so yeah I'm not quite sure what to
expect but it's going to be a very very
cool couple of days and yeah I'll try
and share as much with you guys as
possible but I'm gonna sign out now
before I pass out and I've seen the
morning you shall enjoy life and live
the adventure but
