tucking into what looks like very
delicious lunch I've got a tandoori

into where we're staying tonight and we
have met up with Amon great to spend
payment and I got pretty somber this
morning even though I did put on some
Sun cream I didn't fit fun enough
rachels advised me to get this instead I
think it's gonna be better arm I'm gonna
actually apply some of it in here
because I'm stinging my bad man like
that it's important so have you paid for
that doing a fairly helpful in the film
and then you ever do it when they ever
do it when you like you you Thurston you
go in and like start drinking a drink
this
but that's when you get arrested that's
the story that criminals say it's not
it's not silly until you walk out the
shop
