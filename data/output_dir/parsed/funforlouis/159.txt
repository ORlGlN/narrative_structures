ruining guide and welcome to module in
Bali it is one of the most photogenic
spots in this whole area
you may recognize these rock beaches and
this very straight road we've just
managed to get some cool shots with the
bus yeah unfortunately we didn't get up
to sunrise this morning it was a very
clear sky so it wasn't particularly
spectacular you know I woke up a look at
the windows right now I'm going to clean
off but we have now driven a little
location remember quite the other people
well that was officially the windiest
conditions of ever flown my drive but I
think even windy over when I crashed in
Cape Town it was it was buying not going
anywhere not a scared about
with it I gave you found a dead boy town
get breakfast dr. strick another menu
this plate
c5 did more than 40 in the twenties
because here I was going to break off
I'm going right
however evening it to take docks we put
in there I just have a lot of work but I
don't think it is it looks pretty
okay the local cafe didn't really have
anything they were human head over to
Burger King because they have the lease
of a better burger option we've been
chillin in the Burger King car park for
a couple of hours
I finished exporting and spotlight
uploading my vlog it always feels good
and I get this done guys it's hard my
miss Dave I struggle with internet but
it's working good also I'm watching
spend Brownback on YouTube I'm just
catching up he's just released a update
on why he quit blogging and that you
started vlogging again Studies on to
season 2 episode 1 and it's him in the
coal road-tripping across Africa you
guys have to go and check out is going
to be an incredible series issuing a
bunch of visual vibes and stuff as well
so I'll link Ben's channel below if
you've forgotten there but I'm sure you
have it yeah hope you did well then
don't you sprint Lindley I've been
joining us on this trip it's going to be
convoying with us all the way back to LA
driving in this car you did have a
rooftop tent fitted so on the drive just
this morning it was so crazy windy that
there the tent would like that I could
get a write-off so we ended up
unclipping it
in the back of it things are ready to
roll now and a nice little rest that's
your rest up do it you ready for an
outgoing shift yeah oh yeah we deserve a
crazy note blue the fact I think it's
all the dry air from the last week we've
made a plan for this afternoon we are
going to be heading to explore a slot
canyon nearby a lot of you may have
heard of Antelope Canyon it's like this
incredible like orange thin Canyon that
you can walk through is like beautiful
colors but it's also super touristy so
apparently if we go there that we like
lines a tourist wait to take photos JP
did some research found a similar Canyon
that's secret that we can hike to so a
jumping in Lindsay's car and we're going
to try to find it hopefully we can get
some good photos there and we're going
to leave the bus here because it's a
little bit hard to maneuver we've
arrived at this random location and
hopefully we're going to find the place
we're supposed to be going to do D
station hours hike or like half an hour
there okay still got plenty of daylight
so nice at the moment some things people
it's nice being down here as long as
it's not windy I this is beautiful oh my
gosh is so cool we're searching for some
narrow parts of the canyon and we just
found this little branch heading into
there so you can check it out it looks
super narrow then this is the area I
don't know the energy guys seem a movie
127 hours without a guy falls down one
of these slot canyons and ended up have
to chop his arm off
to save himself pretty cool movie okay
you're super narrow yeah guys how freaky
is this in chalk written their death
however you can see that there's an
arrow pointing this way huh the body
this could be the beginning of like a
horror stories like friends going for a
hike and then something happens like
someone breaks her leg and we're stuck
out here and then and then or the clowns
the killer clowns attack I don't know
what it is about this place but I mean
just such a good mood I think it's like
the warm and being out in nature and
probably because we've been sitting in a
vehicle for two days but I just like
cannot wipe this smile on ice if you're
feeling a bit down guys and you haven't
even had a house for a while I highly
recommend it
especially if you live anywhere near
this kind of place
whoa oh my gosh look at that car is
falling off the bridge how did he get
down there how did they get down here oh
this is cool yeah there's a ladder right
there
oh that is scary this is terrifying
oK we've decided next time we're in this
area or on a road trip across the
country we're going to come back to this
exact location probably earlier in the
day to get better like but it's yeah it
definitely works another visit so
beautiful and it's so nice it's not like
full of people this is why we're not
dying you guys yeah quick sorry guys I'm
not gonna tell you this exact location
quite a dinner just found the pizza
place 6th night we just realized this
restaurant is inside an old boat a
paddle steamer checked out food is
served check there's a pasta dish out
all that looks tasty so the owner of
this place gallery has just invited us
up to check out the upstairs of the boat
which is where he lives
he's a very interesting character oh wow
so many antiques wow this is cool and
you just collected this stuff from all
around the world
no mostly Germany Austria Hungary in
France I've got my own core sword over
there I was a captain in the Marine
Corps and get it on my alright so my the
only time I ever used it was to cut my
wedding cake haha that's told that to
war in parades no dr. Jeff but I mean

loop off a dagger there that has a
swastika on
and that very rare to find talent yeah

rule pipe or Austria I'm not sure but it
is 1907 every time I filled it up
somebody would say oh so that's just in
the bottom ha ha that's so good that is
actually amazing Wow
so that's called a little pain so when
did you get this Oh probably in the 70s

80s I've had and most all of this stuff
is 150 to 200 years old Wow guys if you
