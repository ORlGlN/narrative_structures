had lots of people say hey hey cool
alright let's come in I'll show you my
old house bro we've set up on the roof
the same as last night and we're just
reshooting some of the stuff that we we
did last night still for this secret
video project but I think it's coming
along quite well this video we want to
get Millie's hair blowing and the winds
kind of coming in and out but we thought
why rely on the wind when we got Alan
with a hair dryer
Alan get your hair dryer out
these guys later on we're trying to
match some shots we did yesterday with
today and we're just playing around
lighting I think we've got I think our
front light is just is the angles off
because we've got far too much shadow
from his nose do you think it matters I
think that's what I think our backlight
is correct
yeah that it's off its off Phil like
this just it slightly bends heading up
who's who's just popping and say hello
check out the situation let's hang out
over the weekend bro we're back inside
for a little bit assessing your footage
Milly's make
it's arrived again laughs annoyed which
is turned into morning though
pretty much
five 5 a.m. yeah I'm not really breaking
out this nocturnal penber school we had
a very good night very productive and
hey I'm really hoping I get to show you
guys this video I was very pleased at
their who pleases Allah yeah so please
both of them I guess the answer
yeah I just look so freaking good it's
been a really fun project but it is
definitely bedtime now so I might quick
you jump in the hot tub it depends I
think so I think I made a quip like a
little while back you should rename your
life for the hunt for a hot tub yeah
that's never been more true than right
now because any normal reasonable person
would go 5 a.m. nice bedtime Louie goes
maybe I should just sleep in the hot tub
but genuinely what you said earlier on
is some I'm considering it
I have decided to save the hot tub
session for tomorrow potentially I'm
gonna get some sleep and tomorrow I'm
gonna be hanging out my friend Matt and
getting on with some editing for this
video project with Josh and I get up to
some fun see you guys then
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure boom
