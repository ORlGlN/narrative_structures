little town just south of Sydney and

grandparents and I'm just going to take
a little wander around but it's really
nice
this lorry reminds me of my buff a
little bit rate - and brother Sam and
here and we're gonna go for a little
drive up the coast
it's a beautiful
so we've been following this incredibly
scenic for you hi and we just stopped
people like paragliding and hang gliding
up there look at this beautiful
butterfly
Sunday very beautiful day we are now two
stumping off and I need an energy drink
as I'm pretty tired and then we're gonna
go food shopping and Rachel's gonna
teach me how to cook an Asian dish
what's the coos oh right we've arrived
in the supermarket what we go first

we're back home and we are cooking this
Asian noodle II dish which is could be
interesting could be interested we've
got this thing common word it's called
because yes thought we've got salmon
noodles Lisa and bean sprouts like this
is probably not a traditional way to do
anything okay somebody let's go for a
freestyle it's about free stuff I just
like how it tastes so these people I
could be spitting laughs I don't know
why learn the bok choy in miso soup and
this is just miso paste okay this is
much
all right time to give this little taste
that was a genuine well that was a
lovely boxing day I had some really cool
science day just to think and look over
my year and get in a good headspace as
