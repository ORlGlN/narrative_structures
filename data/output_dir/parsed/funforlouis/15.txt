good morning guys I have come down to
Kingston today to meet help my friend
Jacob gonna grab a coffee and then I'm
heading in for some meetings in London
after that I wasn't going to vlog today
but as I got in the car I realized it's
actually quite a beautiful day and yeah
they haven't taken you guys into London
with me for a while and also this is my
last day in the UK because tonight I'm
flying out to Cape Town so yeah it's
gonna be a good day nice feeling feeling
good ready for coffee though all right
here he is Jacob cheers bro having a
good catch up eating some avocado on
toast and drinking lots of coffee guys
Jacob just pointed out the size of this
dog outside this is the biggest dog I've
seen for years this is you could ride
that dog had a really nice catch up with
Jacob if you haven't checked him out
he's an incredible photographer I'll
link his Instagram below and we were
just chatting about our plans for 2018
and yeah where we'll be traveling and
projects we're doing and hopefully we
can do some stuff together yeah looking
forward to it actually and
another inspiration guy I'm about to go
and see now and his name's Sam he was
one of the guys who founded unis that I
haven't seen him like three years but
I'm gonna go and check out his New
London offices and yeah as you know
whenever I'm back in the UK I try and
catch up with as many people as possible
so that's not doing guys this is Sam
from uni lat
and we've just spent a little time just
chatting and dreaming together and
looking at ways we can work together
this year but and he's just give me a
little office tour show us around so
there's a little bit of a moment because
we kind of renovate in the office but as
you can see we've got a big guy you have
painted sign on the wall sisters ground
floor London HQ we have all these kind
of meeting rooms starting around which
is kind of a sweet salon is the
destinations where they kind of they
kind of move from Caledonia super like
small space probably literally where we
are now probably like that like that and
it's just mad how much it's grown from a
year on here that's like four years ago
yeah it's like 11,000 square-foot like
whole building in London it's insane
Manchester office as well
congratulations dude this is this is
really inspiring guys because it shows
you what you can what kind of empire you
can build off just I guess to start with
just a Facebook page but we've been
chatting the last arrow so about like
how can we use our platforms and
audience to reach kind of or to do
positive things in the world and have
positive impact what we're saying this
stats were like how you're the Facebook
page had the biggest interaction and
then any Facebook page so in last year
2017 we had over 1.1 billion people
likes commented or shared our content
which is the most of any kind of face
book publisher yeah and had a forty
million video views
I had a figurehead
probably like 20 million video views so
these guys are working on a slot
operating a slightly higher level but
we're all kind of yeah it's interesting
being in the influence of space and
imagining the positive impact and I will
obviously not that they need me to but I
will link what these guys doing down
below specially you need ad adventure
which I think there's a lot of crossover
in what we're doing yeah going like
their Facebook page good campaigns sweet
sweets right guys as expected that was
really really cool meeting with Sam I
feel like on a lot of levels even though
we haven't chatted in a few years
properly just a bit online where yeah we
see the world and this in a similar way
we're excited about having a positive
impact in different ways and yeah I'll
keep you guys posted know things we're
doing but yeah lots of lots of exciting
ideas staring also I didn't mention but
he has his own personal Instagram
account I wish I think you should go and
check out and follow and yeah hopefully
your he'll feature in this year and a
few modes and as we're finding ways to
travel together he might come down to
Cape Town and yeah I think he's got a
lot of cool projects that I'd love to
help support one of which he's looking
at doing more kind of documentaries and
creating more longer form content and
also that's something I'm trying to do
as well Beyond Borders hopefully this
year if that goes really well and
successful that could be a big part of
my future so there's a lot of crossover
and yeah I always feel inspired seeing
people killing it in the industry doing
so well having achieved so much but
being grounded and
having a good heart so yeah
don't check Sam out I'm now final thing
of the day before I go in pack and fly
is gonna go and meet my mum for a coffee
she's work she works around here so yeah
that's gonna get a quick coffee we've
got a little coffee you had a cat chart
and this is where my mom works in where
are we living for school around
Liverpool Street and I'm Lily I get back
to work now back it's been great
catching up I'll be back in like a week
love you but I actually feel quite proud
to seeing my mum working and a good job
up here in the city
she's been kind of working as a
contractor freelance for years and years
and years and she last year kind of yeah
managed to bag herself this very very
good job and yeah I've seen her come
alive because it's I think even office
jobs that are not an office person I
think if you're doing stuff you love and
you're passionate about
it brings you life whatever you're doing
so yeah I definitely sense that for my
mum and
yeah that's good right I'm slightly
against the clock now to get back pack
and to the airport in time but it's hope
fake it I have all my things I've just
packed quickly
well not like regular to me about 40
minutes meaning we're running oh how
half an hour late I think yeah only my
dad who's a gonna connect to the airport
rious bag I'm taking down to Cape Town
as well
dad's drop me off see ya yep it's weird
checking in luggage Ryan's got all this
summer clothes in there I think or
something guys I want to pick up
Emirates for being very understanding
about my insanely overweight and luggage
I normally don't go near the counter so
they can't weigh it but because I
checked and Rhys bag they insisted on
weighing it and told me yeah I was
supposed to have seven kilograms with
the limit I had 25 kilograms that I ever
triple the weight limit
I managed to explain its own fragile
electronics and they they have had they
had some sympathy and let me through
which is nice
I arrived in Dubai
I didn't sleep so I had entered the blog
yet but when I get on the next flight to
Cape Town I'm going to try to sleep most
a flight and I did describe some
breakfast hour till I thought
that was a very long bus drive from the
terminal to the aeroplane I think that's
like 20 minutes driving through the
airport I felt like we were driving in
circles but we got here I think I fell
asleep on the bus and I think I might
fall asleep before we even take off so
you're on the sign out here guys
look forward to the beginning of some
exciting times in Cape Town the vlogs
are gonna get fun at summary we could
have been hanging out with Nick and Ange
and Jesse their baby we haven't met
Jesse yet he's awesome and yeah like I
said we're gonna be working on the
documentary getting a team together
hopefully JP's gonna make it out pretty
soon and
yeah exciting times exciting times
alright I'll catch in Capetown peace out
into her life and in the adventure
