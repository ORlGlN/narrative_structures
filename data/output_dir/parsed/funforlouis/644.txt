hello guys the victor from Mexico
I am currently having some adventures in
Japan this is Nikhil what a beautiful
place good morning guys
we've just checked out of our rooms it's
pretty hilarious this morning they were
doing all these like test fire alarms
clearly they weren't tests for our lives
they're just trying to get everyone out
of bed because we all overslept and like
miss the official check outside it's all
sorted now they I've left these guys
having breakfast and I have decided to
catch an uber over to my friend peace
house furious P those of you that have
seen my channel for years and even my
previous channel will remember Pete he's
a competitive e and he does like workout
staff and bodybuilding kind of stuff and
this morning I think we're gonna film a
collab video where he's going to give me
like a fitness routine and give me a
workout to do something like that we
haven't figured out yet but I'm gonna
head over to his now a lot of fun
I've arrived
hey this is Melissa hey give us a little
tour of your house a tour that's a fun
room
face this way and you see the fire room
I don't know you might appreciate this
this is like some artwork that we like
it on yeah
- all would that's awesome what kind of
plane is that like a Spitfire yeah it's
cool man
oh yeah this is basically the final move
into a house and in the basement I have
like my office if you will so we do our
magic and all that stuff
this is what I wanted to say all of
these oh you're all your Guinness World
Records here I got my masters of
engineering and how I do YouTube freely
and they're like stacked in front of the
main guest he holds a lot of world
records most of them they're all for eat
there are pretty I saw what he places on
Facebook the other day it was for it so
like three chocolate eclairs in 18
second and it was like the record before
was like a minute and something before
we head out guys he is just government
to sign his wall I'm honored to be the
first person for all the guests he has
done hair off my did you to write a
bigger disappointed I just I just expect
it you don't first person you gotta be
like okay I've got a big yeah you make a
point
oh I've been worried like mark mark Tom
impress us so there is
some of these weights look insane like I
don't even know okay I don't even know
if I could lift them once whoa they're
like crazy skulls so I got changed
got some shorts done Pete's lent me some
shoes and we are about to start I'm
gonna go through like some weight
training stuff which which when are you
going to put this in your channel at
some point at some way in the future but
anyway I'll link a link or beat stuff
below it's gonna be it's gonna be
interesting yeah I feel like if you push
you too much they'll probably vomit but
ah this is it we're gonna teach you it
so they wanna do yeah yeah yeah yeah
don't scare me there's no point in
introducing something that you don't
want to do again a little bits good we
have just finished doing some white
stuff which was intense boy we actually
really loved it both of us are shot
sharp and these guys these guys are
amazing I was thanks to them like I
often don't enjoy exercise but they made
it very enjoyable said like teach me all
about it I was learning all the right
techniques and I feel like I can do this
like I don't feel like it was it didn't
push me too hard I don't feel exhausted
I feel like pumps and like ready to do
more something awesome
encouraged that's for sure for sure
that's early but the stuff that we
showed you was like gym stuff yeah you
can't you're on the road you're
sometimes in these like God knows where
in this world sometimes you know it's a
hut in the middle of nowhere and there's
no gym so what do we do okay so this is
like we're now going to do a little
quick thing on how I can learn on the
move travel stuff
what could I like but the body weight
stuff so you know you don't need
equipment to do it you can just do it
yourself
maybe you need like a bar that's right
yeah the most complicated thing is
finding I think the most difficult thing
is doing pull-ups find a place to do
pull-ups all this other stuff is because
I couldn't push up to cool you just need
a float
totally for sure so so we all know their
regular pushing right yeah right yep
you know you can do it yeah you don't
really want to do this I know a lot of
people like bounce yeah and that's just
much like that for us
so we'll go down then we can do an
alternative is going really wacky and
now I'll actually work the back door as
wide as you can so that we can actually
still go down yeah yeah that's it it
gets you much more difficult but there's
not much movement but there is him
you're actually working your back and
people slow thank you if you want to go
yeah you know oh yeah but it isn't easy
that's great yeah there's different ways
of like you put your hands closer
obviously you're working your triceps
right think so yeah yep start
incorporating your triceps so when
you're doing that like this in decline
bench press which is basically doing a
professional foot in the you know when
that's be find this exact same thing so
it's the opposite the most difficult
thing is incline bench press so which
would be elevating your feet and then I
guess the higher than you will feel the
more difficult to get
and projects to which gets really
difficult yeah you know we did that all
these exercises before get deadlifts
bench squat and then drop after fusion
push-ups
yeah you can do back and forth yeah my
eva has arrived
these guys have been amazing it's been
short but sweet sweet yeah until next
time hopefully we see you in another
country yeah we're good we're trying to
plan some kind of travel fingers Pete
travels loads as well and like i said
earlier guys going subscribe to his
channel check out he doesn't like
fitness stuff like eating challenges
loader travel when your vlogs you've got
vlog channel i'll link it all below
anyway you can see what we did today and
and Pete's promising me I'm gonna be
aching tomorrow I kind of feel my like
muscles tingling a little bit I think
tomorrow you're bad okay catch you later

it we painted it to the departure gate
Rachel's here we have the kind of rush
we because they had us the US border was
in Canada so I guess we're in America

a much bigger plane than this
to New York's JFK Airport
welcome to New York mejia we're in New
York again I spent a lot of time in New
York I'm gonna throw this out there I
think I've landed in New York more times
than any other air for this year that's
my guess I don't know you guys might
know I think looking back through my
videos as I was editing for this buffer
compilation there was lots of new york
los children Eva
we're heading to our Airbnb now Nick and
and Andrea are waiting there and they're
ordering Indian food as we speak so I'm
very excited about that because arrived
in Brooklyn died before we head up to
air baby I'm just I've got a question
for you Americans yeah what is with your
obsession with Halloween I don't really
understand it but why is someone hanging
a skeleton and ghosts in the tree and
cobwebs why is that right it's kind of
weird kind of weird but but next weekend
I'll join in all the Halloween
celebrations but does battle me a little
bit to be honest hey make it Nick hey
dude I know every time I arrive you're
getting out the shower okay look out of
you
look at this perfect timing the food has
just arrived so we basically just
arrived with a meal on the table you
happy Rach yay that's not Nick that's

real squad right here this is the
realest one so these next few days are
gonna be a really nice time with the
whole team back here chillin in Brooklyn

New York now I think the chaos of
Manhattan sometimes is a bit stressful
but I like Williamsburg and Brooklyn
