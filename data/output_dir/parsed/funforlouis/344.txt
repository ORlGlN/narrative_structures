you
good afternoon guys we arrived late last
night in the rain forest eco lodge
somewhere in the Sri Lankan rainforest
and we slept this morning because we
didn't get bitter like 3 a.m. and we're
sitting down for lunch
how you feelin Maya yeah look at this
view guys this is literally we're
staying I think in one of these in this
cabin and we are in the heart of the
rainforest this is one of the most
biodiverse places on there
lunch has arrived we have all the things
all of them okay what they're all
splicing
right time to go on our first
exploration we've got a guided tour into
the rainforest and I think we're going
to go and see a waterfall nearby but one
of my concerns this being a rainforest
was that it was going to be raining all
day that turns out it's not there's a
little shower after lunch but this is
pretty ideal it also said that the risk
of leeches isn't as high today so we
don't have to wear protective them kind
of socks but I think sometimes there's
lots of leeches
with rides at a little stream and
there's fish in this pond area before
the water pool starts and I'm gonna feed
through my fingers
okay oh my oh my god like piranhas they
literally like piranhas and they like
leeches oh my god
basically if you are hungry and in the
jungle and want to eat fish you can just
put your hand in and scoop them out you
should do if your ears yeah miss a word
oh my gosh oh there's so many okay okay
oh my gosh they're all coming are you
hold handy I want to do it for your
whole handy do it no I don't want to it
no you can do oh we don't like that I
don't like that you're attacking oh my
gosh provides gonna pass a oh my god is
it it's so weird
let's do it do it you have to hold it
for 10 seconds you have to hold it in
for 10 seconds okay we're gonna get Mimi
do that a kiss okay do it ten seconds
yeah oh my gosh is so good Lulu Ian
those fish were absolutely incredible
guys
it felt like I had a thousand little
mouths and I closed my hands I think
you've lost everyone probably hurry up
this is always Lee in a group I'm always
the last one left behind filming things
what you have there medicinally which
currently if you put on scratches and
stuff they you'll faster I really want
to learn more about this kind of stuff
just go in the forest and like be able
to take care of myself
maybe yeah no oh why not
okay you can't find something around and
I'd be like can I eat it that's probably
the worst thing ever
that's gonna eat everything I'm sure the
jungle for the food and probably
poisonous things ago
okay swing swing on it but in the movies
all the rookies always swing and then it
breaks tires everyone that knows which
ones are good yeah I'm tired zone this
one's fine actually don't believe me go
I see this vine here this is called a
Liana and we were just told that one of
these vines can grow across 100 acres of
rainforest that's insane
one thing it must have underground
connections though it can't be like one
vine so it's like wrapping or and other
trees and stuff then once it reaches the
sunlight then it starts growing leaves
so the synthesis science rustic science
guys is elite is elites attacking Riya
she felt it well I'll put it on my
finger oh okay don't worry you're
sucking me now
did it start sucking you
okay you just you need to go in to get
up I'm soaking are there any others in
your legs oh my gosh it was climbing up
your leg oh my god leeches if you go any
others Ryan's gonna put on the leaf
socks
they look sexy yes buddy
guys check out this cheeky little crab
under that leaf
okay apparently this water is drinkable
it's so fresh that's coming up I guess
from like the top of the mountain
through the jungle into my mouth
the good yes
so we missed the best time of day to see
the animals apparently that was early
morning and there's monkeys and birds
that come to feed so I'm kind of
starving in CNE there's also he said
like three species of snake we said
there's no pointin up here because we
were like a thousand meters altitude and
I can't deal with this height or maybe
it's the rain - well piss them I don't
know I always visualize my life as one
of these and how when you meet people I
was think about how when you meet people
in high school whatever social needs as
I moved a lot how like two separate
trees can come together into a couple
years you're like intertwine like best
friends always together and then how
your lives just
let's beat
so loud the secatur guys one little
beetle size thing like this big making
that noise sound so angry it's really
cool visiting places like this because
it gives me ideas of what I would and
wouldn't want to do and I have my own
eco village I think I definitely want to
do their solar-powered or solar heated
water in all of the Sam
so we had a lovely dinner and we've just
been chilling in the main lobby area
doing laptop Club I've finished that is
my vlog is now uploading but
unfortunately we're gonna have to sit
here whilst uploads which is two hours
so we thought we'd watch a movie cuddle
up and watch a movie it's 3 a.m. and
it's time for bed guys before we go to
bed I just want to show you how cool
these doors are into our bathroom
they're full-on cowboy saloon doors
basically every time I've gone to the
toilet I felt like a cowboy right I've
got a dilemma
tomorrow morning the only time we're
gonna see any cool animals is early like
early early um so I I'm going to get
three hours sleep and get up to see the
birds and the monkeys and then go back
to sleep again I think that's my plan
hopefully otherwise we might not see
animals and this is one of the reasons
owner being the rain forest is is see
the cool wildlife so I'm going to make a
sacrifice tomorrow morning and then
probably have a nap in the afternoon
before we leave and we're heading back
to Colombo tomorrow night which should
be thumb drive quite long one anyway
I'll catch you early in the morning
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
