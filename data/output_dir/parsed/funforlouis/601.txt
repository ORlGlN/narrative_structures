hi my name is Sarah I'm Joe and we're
from the UK and we're currently in
Prague and you're watching one boom
good morning guys is 7:00 a.m. I'm about
to head to the airport
my mom's finally off its give me a lift
should we go to get my bags a little bit
lighter I lost some of my um some of the
things I mean carrying around guys look
at the moon
amazingly guys with arrived with plenty
of time we've got like two hours till
the flight ladies I've already checked
in
we're all good I just need to find my
friend handy now there he is
hey there man
it's gonna be a fun trip I didn't told
everyone what we're doing here I'll tell
you I'll tell you I thank really nice
but cheers Andy to an awesome trip in
the Ivory Coast
so the reason we're heading out to the
Ivory Coast on this trip is that I've
been invited to present on a documentary
about sustainable cocoa farming so we're
gonna be spending a few days out there
before we start filming and then we're
gonna get shown around some cool
projects and meeting the team that's
gonna be filming me and stuff so I'm
pretty excited I haven't done anything
quite like this before being more of a
presenter I'm a little bit nervous
because I don't really think I've got
incredible presenter skills I don't
think I'm very articulate we'll see how
it goes I'm very excited it should be
pretty awesome thing we're doing out
there and showing you guys some cool
stuff I'm gonna be filming behind the
scenes of what we're doing which will
give you a little bit of an insight and
then when the documentary is finally out
at some point next year I'll be able to
point you guys to that you can see what
we made
this was our flying guys I think it's
and Airbus imagine having one of those
planes to live on boy
lately I've been in the top deck of an
a380 491 row 91 that's nuts in there is
over 500 passengers on this plane
merci you go back coming back yeah very
big oh I always take it on as we were
getting on the plane that woman was
kicking up a fuss my bags massive my
carry-on and I found out why look at the
size these tiny overheads luggage things
so it couldn't fit it in there I think
that's my bag now they're in Premium
Economy so I managed to find some space
down there it's a totally full flight
today and again we got awesome legroom
he happy MB yeah yeah
we're about to land very drunk delegate
me it's very
even look at it
what's it about you wouldn't take it
it's just a nice barrier and rather
people now which is slandered and found
out it's 27 degrees Celsius and it's
like so weird going down the stairs in a
plane and then cause we're still in the
plane in the plane I always like doing
this thing that I love there's a need
after happily even to as I opened my
fire
attracted all the countries up BTW this
is according to my app v country calls
it like it colors in all the colors in
other countries
yeah
turns out it's a little bit more
complicated to get in the country than
we thought got all these visa
applications and permission slips we
need to give it off you laughs well well
guys we got in go ahead we didn't feel
like we had to apply for a visa as we
love this so we just tried to walk
straight through the passport control
they're like you don't have a visa so
it's a run back give them some documents
get the visa stalking now
that took a while it did take a while
you shouldn't say that in roads unlike
his neck
so these guys are sort out my SIM card
for me again 20 gig I have the SIM card
we have Internet
where we going this way
I am hoping the car rental place is
still open we've been in there boys
share this guy out with a machine gun as
nice guys that the car rental place
behind us which we were supposed to rent
from Avis he's actually closed and
they're not picking up the phone all the
rental companies foreclose that we're
just gonna get a taxi but we've been
negotiating these guys for the last like
half hour
I cannot believe we are still at the
airport I think we're just getting a
taxi with this guy now we're probably
we're probably getting ripped off to be
honest 30 quid for attaches to the hotel
I'm feeling like that's not African this
is no
that were stay asleep no memorably who's
like this isn't Arabic okay isn't
literally why do you think anyone's ever
stayed here this is my room I've got a
desk I've got a bet oh yeah cool
bathroom buff nice well we finally made
it took a little bit longer than
expected thankful that the guys we got
in the car with actually brought us here
and that could have been potentially
dangerous although we did speak to them
from their visitor information desk so
that's a good site but in all
seriousness be careful when getting in
foreign unmarked taxis like I just did
be careful about that it's not not a
good suggestion but we are here and I'm
looking forward to seeing what this
place is like in the morning I can hear
I just went upstairs briefly I can hear
see like lapping on the shore and that's
a good side I think it's it's cool I
think it's a cool beachy area but it's
pitch black right now I'm gonna crash
out because I only got like three hours
sleep last night and I slept a tiny bit
in the plane but I'm I'm ready to sleep
though so hard so my world
catchy tomorrow morning for some more
fun in the Ivory Coast
peace-out enjoy life and live the
adventure
