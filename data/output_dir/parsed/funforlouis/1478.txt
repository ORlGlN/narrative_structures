through from the tank today by part from
the fuel tank altogether and I put a an
actual can of diesel down there so just
filled up with fuel
and about the head over the bridge into
Wales

Wales and went to the toll booth where
it said lorries of 20 pounds and cars or

pounds being a double-decker bus which I
don't quite understand why bar very
