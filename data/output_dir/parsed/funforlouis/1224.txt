and I'm heading my way to meet with a
New Zealand's best baristas and he's
gonna give me a cutting session I don't
know what that means but I'm trying to
find the place now surrounded somewhere
so I found the Roasterie and this is
Nick in it he has a gun and he's gonna
be showing me the ropes
and what they do here and this is
awesome because obviously I love coffee
and now I can find out more about it
start off with a smelvin
so this is how some of the coffee is
described you can taste and smell yeah

Association of America flavor will

you the temperature so this is the
roaster where they roast the coffee I've
asked Nick to show me some latte art

won 5th place in the world Bruce the
championships and I'm expecting some
pretty amazing things right now I've
