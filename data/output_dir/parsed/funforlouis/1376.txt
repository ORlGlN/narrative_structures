the internet is free here going down to
the main reception and buying a week's
pass on the Internet
it turns out I haven't actually bought
my ticket yet to be in this resort and
the security guard was just like yelling
at me for coming in so I just snuck past
with my skateboard there all right guys
only a thousand minutes until I've
uploaded my video you having a good
morning stage yeah feeling a bit rough
yes very soon we are slowly gathering
the rest of the group another few people
arrive today and then I think a few more
people arriving this evening with a
group spray
so right next to where we're staying
there's a theme park so we've just
strolled down to check out some rides
some on this kind of random toboggan
ride we just queued for ages for but I
think it's getting pretty fun
like I did enjoy a man to Pokemon I was
very good see I've done it properly
unless you delete hola Anna it's kind of
like a near-death experience thing hey
man
so the display from this burger places
all these Tomatoes
this is a really bad idea these guys
twisted me around and I'm gonna go crazy
spinny when we go crazy silly
oh-oh
they just stopped the ride and got me to
straighten my chains out but that we
started again where to start again
I'm in this ride by it's really hot in
there I'm being crushed
so we just got the ride and I bumped
into it and what's your name okay and
they recognize me of vlogs and stuff

coaster
