their van so I'm gonna drive down here
jump start Rodney and then I absolutely
have to come buy a replacement battery
today cos this one is not charging
I've been here for like 15-20 minutes
and it's still not starting it's like
its back not quite strong enough to to
charge this bulkier back break all this
is just completely incapable of
receiving a charge this is a nightmare

battery - Rodney and then it'll be as
good as new - cool right I found someone
to fit a battery longer with my baby
