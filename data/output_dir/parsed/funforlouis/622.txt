my name is Ynez fun it's fun and we're
from Tucson Arizona but where the gang
Canyon right now and you're watching fun
for Louis
oh good morning guys we are leaving our
beautiful little B&B today and we're
heading off on a little road trip around
the island we haven't left Kingston yet
but I think there's some beautiful
places were going to visit check this
out guys this fish swimming around in
between these sniffing things
32 adventure do you know something
really different about driving your own
vehicle than being like driven around
like chauffeured around and it's a lot
more freeing I feel like it's a lot more
chance of doing thing spontaneous or
discovering things and the most freeing
moment of my life was when I passed my
driving test so if you guys at home
haven't bothered passing a driving test
I highly recommend it it gives you a
whole new level of freedom
as was driving through a river
before we start properly we're popping
into the store to get a SIM card so I
can upload videos whilst we're driving
around
we pulled over to get this woman a lift
she flagged us down hello would you like
a lift okay
what's your name I'm funny do you
usually walk this hallway do you usually
walk when you when you come yeah how
long does it take you hours
oh yeah you can nice really clean yeah
very good night that's nice
I always love a place like this
I think we would have had more
conversation but I had a very thick to
make Max and I could barely understand
everything she saying
but I'm glad that we could drive her the
whole distance I was thinking like two
hours to walk I'm sure a bit so it's
always nice to
I'll give you a little update me and
Meyer just started driving I don't
really know where we're going other than
trying to get to the other side of the
island off site so we just thought this
little road looks cool and it's kind of
weird weaving in and out of little
villages and like very windy roads and
it's like jungles mountains either side
of us
good speech
yes Kurtz yes
we need we need two coconuts coconuts
need to deal the water
three days just chillin
we just realized we on the wrong side of
the island since sunset for tonight so
it's kind of already set over the
mountains well this road detour
we found the Sun again
you found our little B&B we've dropped
our bags off we're gonna head down to
the beach before grabbing dinner but
look it's the tropical rainstorm where's
my store right it's raining I think it
could become
so we're just gonna drive straight out
and find enough we need to find the
mangos
this is the last mango in the shop it's
not right so we're probably not gonna
get it
unfortunately it's not mango season at
the moment strain no mangoes anyway guys
I love colorful houses check this pink
house out it's like an abandoned
derelict house basically like that it's
in different places on different
websites and we have one picture for
reference we are definitely not
addressed where are we oh man we've been
driving around in circles for like an
hour to find some birthday and I think
we might have found a place is it open
yeah
I hope it's open this is cool
apparently soup is made with coconut
so we've been chilling for the evening
watching lost this is like a really old
TV show that it's already all the
seasons already finished but I never
watched it and everyone's like oh my
gosh it's the best thing ever so a
million drivers started watching you
recently anyway there's lots of like
jumpy things and monsters and stuff and
we decide to go for a walk outside but
we're both of us are like what was that
and we know there's a dog out here
somewhere so we're hoping we don't get
chased and bitten we don't know if we
can get out of this place with staying
here this like obviously nice and secure
it's fences and we took awhile to even
get out the building a little walk
around the side of the building to see
everything hopefully we're trying to
walk down to the beach that's the plan
to get out guys
there's our guard dog hey dougie Hey
okay I'm just gonna leave
I probably doesn't do it again smokin
I'm hoping when we come back everyone
has guard dogs
it's okay chill chill chill it's okay
nothing to worry about guys I think we
have found the way to the beach the only
problem is Roy is worried that some of
these plants might be poisonous and
itchy yeah it's like a field that just
disappears into the darkness but I can
hear waves so I think I I think we
should go for it let's just go a little
bit and then see you this bed
this might become accordance there might
be snakes mm maybe we should find
another way
this is our dog hey dougie use your
chair
cuz we're coming back in somehow we've
got this hard
is this our hey how you guys doing hey
hey hey oh there it's free guard dogs oh
well there's three guard dogs we're
gonna be a trouble here how do you
convince guard dogs that you're their
friend I'm your friend let I'm your
friend
no hello sit sit hello hello hello hello
choices he look angry you're happy I
can't tell what do you think Riya you
know dogs more than me you don't know
him which makes me think that they might
be mr. bitey yeah okay I'm pulling the
lady
hello hi sorry I'm calling so late it's
Louie here I'm staying in in the villa
we we wanted to go for a little walk so
we we went for a walk to try and find
the beach but we can find one so we came
back but now there's another doggerel
waiting at the gate for us sorry we
weren't sure where does it come in and
okay thanks
okay way back yeah we were trying to
find the beach but I knew we'd met this
dog boy we hadn't let these dogs so I
wasn't sure whether this whether they'd
be friendly hey I feel kind of bad that
we woke up the lady who owns the place
but we weren't gonna risk it those dogs
it was a fun walk though although we
failed to get to the beach but I just I
just love walking around and this kind
of temperature and I also love the sound
of nature
yeah it sounds this sounds so cool
jungle noises I used to have a CD when I
was a kid that was just like hours of
jungle noises like bears and crickets
and and I used to just play it like just
relax in my bedroom which was also
decorated as a jungle if you haven't
seen my video my channel about that
tomorrow we are hopefully gonna get to
explore a bit the junk around here we're
going down to the restaurant we try to
get into tonight as like where the beach
was gonna go down there for breakfast
and and then we're gonna keep on
exploring island apparently I've heard
rumors that there's a bobsleigh run
you know like in Cool Runnings the
bobsled Jamaican bobsleigh team so I'm
hoping we can find that and Navigon that
all right see in the morning peace out
enjoy life in the adventure
