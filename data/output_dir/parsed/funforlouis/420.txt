good morning guys
we have just woken up after a good
night's sleep at the Fairmont
Whistler and then wire about to head out
for some golf lessons I've literally
never played golf in my life this is
Bree and Zoe they're hanging out with us
today I literally know nothing about
golf check this out guys this is where
bears shop and their claws so me and
Roya yay
the sound is good along the ground oh
that was surprisingly difficult
Wow second guy yeah honestly look at it
to the outside it looks like it's like
slow and boring but you totally get an
adrenaline rush you even set bulbs
faith yeah yeah and you are killing it
as well you smacked it twice with a big
duck club spirit on the spot bears is
this some kind of mating call we can do
to attract the Bears
you know I haven't figured that one oh
yeah
oh is that is there coffee up there oh
yeah a bluff right might help even more
now thanks for the tour
my pleasure yeah hope you enjoyed it
hopefully add some yeah hey Ryan Louie
Louie nice to meet you
Ryan nice to meet you we have just
arrived at Lost Lake we're gonna go out
on a canoe this is Ryan he's gonna be
taking us out you're looking forward to
sorry is it not easier just to go - we
did a canoe like this I love fresh
mountain air
I guess growing up in like a town and
being around cities you kind of don't
really know what fresh air really feels
like entering your lungs but when you
come out to places like this
I love it it is just a dark ways there
I love life like my school so just had
some lunch and we're now going on a hike
to a train wreck which is out in the
forest somewhere I don't know anything
about it yet but we'll find out what did
you say the name of this river is check
on the river
wow that is a serious walk
guys check out fast flowing this river
is how many people kayak down here
don't they I'll be doing that
I was tempted to walk across this log to
get to the other side to get some photos
but do not want to fall off that that
would be very sketchy and love the color
of the water here I think it's a doing
the minerals in their glass here that
might wash down but so bright turquoise
walk down
where all these logs have washed down
the river check out this
you're on the break
yeah they tasty
guys unless you know what you're picking
you shouldn't eat wild berries
huckleberries apparenty
like black light
I love this the same the raw power of
nature
don't believe water can move these
massive loads these must wait tons just
like picks them up like they're nothing
in this transport from somewhere else
and dump them we're just arriving at the
train wreck what I've learned about it
is that this happened in the fifties the
driver came around the corner too fast
to the rail weight tractor just up there
come around this corner too fast and
yeah rolled some carriages luckily they
were just cargo carriages and no one was
injured which is amazing and then they
just salvage what they killed off them
and left then just I guess just chill
here in the woods
how not suggest I just can't believe how
far they go for a hike and then just
seeing me
she's not
it's so close to going in the river down
there over
locale mangled this bottom section is
whoa this metal is crumpled
I don't know about you guys got I'm
actually a big fan of graffiti like
street art mainly like wrap it like
artwork rather than I'm not a massive
fan of just tagging stuff so I've
climbed right to the top of the wreck
this is I think this is the best view
get out
well I can feel the train moving I like
that this has been turned into artwork
something that was just like dumped and
now it's like a tourist attraction
whoa that's quite a big drop so if you
ride along here just down here straight
up there would you ride it no not this
Jade No
my limits so the peroneus is an active
train track and they try and discourage
people from walking on the actual track
and so we're going to take a different
route and then on the other side they're
building a little suspension bridge and
they're gonna try and encourage everyone
to walk in that way good idea
I'm gonna cool the best and a rate no I
think you just give him these I might
attract some animals with amazing cooler
or to scare everyone away all right
we're heading back and they're gonna get
some snacks I think your coffee as well
be nice oh thanks for little all right
no problem
I'm eight
just popping into the gold lounge to get
a coffee and some snacks
I need a coffee we've just been nothing
in our room it's now dinner time we'll
come down to the Wildflower we're a
little bit late for our table booking
dinner is served
cheers Riya to Sunday exploring Whistler

bowl handy plus Americans call it cotton
candy

with Fairmont Hotels it's actually been
exactly I've needed after a month of
pretty much non-stop traveling around
