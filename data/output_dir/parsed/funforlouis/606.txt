wasn't really doing any work I just
let's go out have a little review of the
footage there's the shot it's not graded
yet but that's gonna look amazing so
we're just gearing up for the next shoot
going down to a little plantation a
little a little nursery where they're
growing the seeds and the little cocoa
plants
for this young sure Jim Aparo Louise
Yahoo oh where are we someone oversold
up in the air so these are all the cocoa
seedlings that there go in here and then
I've just found out that they send them
from here out to all the other farmers
then they can plant them and grow their
own cocoa plantation YouTube channel
description down here
give my hand well give my foot guys
check these boys out there all got their
mobiles out you feel with you doing
snapchat then they couple those cocoa
pods what and that's that's what's in
the cocoa beans are in there and those
white thing
good job Morton yeah you know that yeah
so I'm gonna have a go one of these
knives they called a heli Bongo
for a frickin load behind them these
guys are on camera crew run a good film
mate and they don't understand me but
it's looking good thank you I saw
earlier where they were growing the coca
leaf feeds now we're here where they're
harvesting all the cocoa pod with the
belly Bongo to give it up back get the
seeds out Jan was showing me how to
carry them over here on my head in the
basket but I can't get that balancing
thing going on and then we pulled them
in here all of these cocoa beans the the
stuff around them the Popo ever is
running off into this into this jug
they've just poured some out no joke
this is one of the best drinks have ever
had in my life
this is unreal super sugary so the best
fruit juice ever
tasteless alcoholic Louie doesn't even
dream what am I gonna get drunk and
we're gonna get drunk and Coco oh yeah I
didn't know that how is it fermented
already I better drink it is so this
time of day
everyone's getting a little bit
flustered because we've only got like
half an hour of light left and we need
to nail the last few bits of filmy this
is where they're drying all the cocoa
beans imaginary talked about you can
make this I love
just thinking about runs hands being in
this room wash their hands wash their
hands
so Jan just gave us a massive bomb iPods
I don't know what we spent the day with
him I guess we can I need to grab my
nice tools and whack it i watch the so
called again Lou got a belly Bongo
at the hotel tonight managed to find
seng city this is vegetable soup with a
bunch of cassava in it I think that's
what it is and we're just trying out
this very hot chili paste it's got a
good kick turn and right it's just gone
11 p.m. and I've been having a planning
meeting with the guys a whole team we've
got to get up early like 6:00 a.m.
because tomorrow is the most important
day of the shoot and we were just
finalizing some of the details for it
I'm really loving this this is like I
said a very new experience for me but I
love what it's all about and that it's
about the sustainability of the cocoa
beans and meeting the farmers and seeing
the whole process and yeah it's just
cool to have a window into this world of
you know I eat chocolate war time and to
be able to see how it's processed and
how people's lives are affected that are
basically it's all due to them that we
get to enjoy these kind of things and
these luxuries in the world and it's
good to see that they've been treated
fairly and people are looking after them
and assisted cool systems in place to
make sure it's all ethical so I've been
learning a lot and hopefully you guys
have had some little snippets of what's
been going on today I'm gonna get some
sleep and hopefully I'm not completely
dead tomorrow
Oh alright peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure
