the guys we just been eating out here we
actually decided to stay outside rather

we're literally on the pavement and
people to be more facade and a couple of
people to be recognized me and this is

December good night time I we're going

have just found this vegan dessert quite
like three minutes in here so we just
paper self-built we're going to go tell
a founder guys
Eureka
okay if you ever go to Eureka we have
some advice but which flavor to get and
we sleep not to get my spear care of the
banoffee personally was the best berry
burn and Rea also see a clearer the
chocolate chip mint
they took cement Agra ones were taken
literally way too many very overpowering
but I am a fan of even if it is a chunky
the brownies visit of brownie something
that one through and I may see a little
bit of the chocolate flavored one but
they run out with like for scrap but yes
those are good food good blizzard check
this car out that is amazing
guys guys look at the me how epic is
that that
I'm saying goodbye direction is about
jump on a train I'm feeling you feel me
ah
are you talking if you look talking
right now okay guys that we are back
home now we just grabbed an uber to sir
Burton and then jumped in the car
I have hugged them earlier it's been a
it's been a fun day relatively
non-eventful and I have been thinking
being back in the UK I probably
mentioned this in the past as well it's
always a bit more difficult for me daily
vlogging because most of my life I'm
traveling and exploring and I've been
new places that haven't been before and
it's easy for me to going to take you
guys on that journey and I guess
discover somewhere together but when I'm
back in the UK I think my whole
lifestyle switches and it's more about
catching up with friends having meetings
and slightly more mundane and for me I
just don't find it enjoyable to try and
film that and make you know make a daily
vlog out of it so singing today you know
today's been fine no but I thinking
today maybe when I'm back in the UK I
should go down to maybe vlogging every
other day or something which is pretty
much what I'm doing anyway
and I'm only uploading every other day
what have been back the last few weeks
so yeah that's a thought but I don't
want to make any big announcements or
anything because you never know things
could change
maybe I'll suddenly find a refresh
passion for it all anyway I no need to
open too much about likes I'm leaving
again on on the weekend on Saturday I've
just booked flights to LA and then I've
got under a week of prep to do for the
world's light I'm very excited about it
alright I'll catch you guys in the
morning
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure Ben
