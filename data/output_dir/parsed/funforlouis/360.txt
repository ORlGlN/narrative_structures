good morning guys
I have just met with Dave it was funny
actually I just like saw his car on the
right away because we were meeting up
here but about 10 15 minutes ago I saw
him and I like food alongside of like I
felt like we were 17 again because
originally I was going to drive down
with him but I ended up staying off his
last night but today we have come down
to a youth hostel where we are hosting
the first ever live the adventure summit
I don't know what we're gonna call here
we've got a name for ya no but it's all
about planning your travel for the year
yeah so I wanted to do it little later
in the year but they've thought January
would be a good time so beginning of
January we're gonna hold it and we'll
let you guys know more information once
we start planning another one later in
the air bro we just gotta get going
we're gonna do some motor pool summits
but yeah it could be a pretty epic so
we're gonna have a look around and see
the venue and see what possibilities
there are yeah so we've begun our tour
this is the first room this is the
lounge area that we're gonna have as one
of our communal spaces we should do some
yeah we should have some meditations
this is by far the nicest youth after
I've ever been to yeah spacious as well
what was the queen doing here I saw some
she opened it
this isn't an on-suite just that on your
left is a bathroom and the room opposite
is an ensuite so technically this room
uses that bathroom okay these bedrooms
it's - depends how much we get books
well we need what we need is to keep a
few fluid spaces because maybe some
girls that want to share with boys or
whatever it may might use an empty space
in circle what what okay this is an
awesome space this is the spaces we are
going to make some serious cooking in
here this is good for workshops and
stuff but really going to be booking
tickets all over the world in this room
this is yeah
look so good
that is cool so this is magical bow
imagine the amount of photos people can
set Instagram shared oh I think people
will fly in globally from it for this
that's that's not really a three is it
we are checking out the outside area
there's some fields over there where we
can have campfires and stuff I think
we're gonna try and get my bus in here
parked up with a hot tub available and
we've just been shown I think there's a
train station very nearby people want to
get trained there we're literally at the
end of this road like a hundred and
fifty meters is where the train station
that comes from London and Brighton is
of course see you in a few months and
yeah yeah alright guys that went a lot
better than expected I mean I wasn't
expecting anything bad but this is
literally the perfect venue Rachel
you've done a good job there thanks
varying so if you guys didn't hear I
think a few vlogs back we were just
explaining that we are putting on an
event to bring together the community
that has gathered around kind of one
it's a little more adventurous Lee and
travel and learn about travel and
vlogging and just create content around
that so very soon we'll be releasing a
little bulletin probably on the live
adventure email and opening for tickets
but you guys come join us with some of
the other youtubers to have an amazing
weekend where we can just spend time
together I learn from each other and
build some relationships too
yeah to inspire each other to travel to
explore the world war and adventure and
how to capture that in creative ways so
if you are a brand or someone that wants
to support this event we would love you
to get in touch
we should they email Dave today you know
you you know they should email Rachel
and I'll make sure I see all of that as
well so it's our a CH AE L and live the
adventure club I'll link it below but
we'd love to get some partners onboard
do some giveaways and yeah just make
this weekend absolutely because I think
this is gonna be the first of many
amazing events that we can do as a
community
so me and Dave have arrived in Godalming
where we're meeting a guy about some
land advice finding lands and we're just
ducks into a charity shop because dave
spotted these shoes in the window hey
quit I think I might have him up yeah
have him up number one brunch spot I'm
sorry mister guys we just had a pretty
inspirational chat with a guy called
Curt who is a little bit further down
the adventure of like you know trying to
buy land and live on it and explore that
whole lifestyle so we've just been
chatting about how to do that and just
getting some advice he's given me a few
brochures and books and then it was
quite crazy we were just looking at this
amazing tree house in Wales and then
lady sick the table next to us just
happens to have been there last week so
it's like totally crazier than that yeah
no this is yeah like this awesome tree
house and that's the kind of thing I
want to do you guys I I there's one
option to buy a small patch of woodland
and kind of just to be a bit naughty and
live on it a little bit and build a
little you know small wooden structure
but I want to go big so that's
that's the current plan so we're just
we're looking at options of how to do
that still I think it's gonna take a lot
look I'm a bit impatient basically I
just wanted to have right now honor like
get the keys tomorrow it's my own place
but I think I just have to be a bit more
patient and hope that we find somewhere
we might quickly whizz down and see we
can find a little patch of land we found
on the internet just for just for fun
we've just arrived to this little farm
this father sale that we're gonna check
out the forest to see this potential to
buy it and turns out there's some sheep
living here hey guys Shepherd we got
surrounded property is just open fields
and there's like a little mobile home
and I call it all shed thing over there
but we're quite interesting the trees
over here so we're gonna have a little
look-see if there's potential to build
some tree houses or something I don't
know yeah and then I think broke some
Hobbit holes some massive hobbit holes
so guys this is the caliber of tree I'm
looking at unfortunately there's pretty
much only one maybe there's one over
there as well
this this little strips the only section
on the whole land which has potential
but unfortunately it's like bordering
someone else's lands literally right
there ideally we want to be secluded and
I'm in the middle of a plot of land so
this isn't looking that promising but
it's good to have come down here and
check it out yeah this guy as well he's
definitely the boy okay there is a nice
little strip it looks like it's quite a
bit forest around here but it's all it's
all their neighbors I guess so the
search continues so before we head back
I've stopped off at another location I
found for sale and this is some forest
with the snuck into to have a look
around and this looks way more like the
kind of vibes we need there's a little
bungalow and then eleven acres five of
which looks like it's forests like this
and these are these are substantial
trees these like this is a definite
option but look at this I'd anything we
should do some cool tree houses this is
pretty pretty good its corner you don't
want 300 year old oak trees protected
and better he's a bad boy oh he's good
so the other thing that's happening
right now is dave has been allowed
access to somebody else's forest to play
around with and park his little his
little tiny home that you bought the
other day I don't know you saw days vlog
or Alfie's vlog the day poor little tiny
home and he's gonna put it on this land
and amazingly it's only seven minutes
away from where we've just looked at
some forest for many
welcome to Dave's woody Hall it
Corcovado I'm so glad I actually came
down it it was only seven minutes away
from that place of checking out so
people were asking and Alfie spoke the
other day basically a friend of mine has
a lot of land in this area and they're
very interested in eco housing community
reflective places and so basically what
I've got is 25 acres here for me to
experiment with so with those hun of
things in mind lately we've liked
inventive solutions for housing force
power for water for waste and for
community and so it's not mine
but I'm the steward of the Corcovado so
this is the first crossroads this here
is gonna be the golf hole nice nice yeah
I saw you in alpha plane the other day
and there's a farm behind them
okay so this is like what I think it was
the entrance area and the activity area
then we're gonna go deep into the core
survival but this isn't the place for my
tree houses really is it not really
because we don't own it so yeah in terms
of investing long-term investing at
ownership I think that's why I'm looking
to buy my own land but this is
definitely a cool spec for day for
experiment and hopefully he can learn
some tough lessons that I can I can take
from him without having to learn them
with it this is a what this is a place
for me to experiment freely which is
what I've always been into but now we
get to do land experiments so here in
this clearing is where I'm gonna put my
chef at ah okay for me the entrance to
the deep corcovado yeah this is kind of
the entranceway I'm gonna put the
Shepherd's heart here and this is gonna
be my first little base well that was
pretty cool guys
I'm glad I got to see Dave's land before
I head off again and leads the UK I
cannot wait to see what he does with it
and also get involved with stuff doing
so I've split off from Dave and I've now
arrived at Mike's house it's Mike's
birthday tomorrow which is very soon
because it's late evening now and we're
going to celebrate by having a little
campfire at the bottom with God and say
I've just built this this little pile of
wood they're not gonna try and light it
it's just 10 midnight we had a nice
couple of hours chatter and the campfire
I've just driven back my parents and I
am beyond exhausted I've done a lot of
driving today guys and done a lot of
scheming with Dave and it's been an
amazing day
lots to think about I'm glad I can bring
you guys in this journey of land
discovery and yeah yeah don't forget to
sign up to the live the adventure
mailing list to find out about the event
we're doing this summit whatever we're
gonna call it
and we're gonna be updating people there
and yeah I'm gonna get some sleep now
and I'll get to you guys in the morning
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure the
