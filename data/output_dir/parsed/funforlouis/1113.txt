go for a little coffee
I mean Steve had come into Kingston and
we've come into a bookshop because what
was away Alfie Facebook me a message
about this guy in Portland Oregon who
has converted a plane into his house and
this is something I've been talking
about for a couple of years now longer
maybe longer am so alongside obviously I
lived in the bus I'm wanting to build a
tree house village and some hobbit holes
I've now got a little bit fixated on
getting a plane and we're just looking
through this little book at the moment
of amazing spaces so basically I'm just
getting some inspiration and I'm really
thinking about long term next couple
years what where am I going to be living
amongst my travel was that when I'm back
in the country and what's it going to
look like and I'm emailing this guy
about buying a plane at the moment can't
quite afford it yet
primary and stiva popped into a little
coffee shop to get some lunch and this
is the article guys this is this is the
kind of thing I wanna do get some words
I want to be this guy off the glass he's
just chillin he's just chillin
oh he's got a blade I love that all on
the wing lighthouse : oh look at the
step lift this little stairwell um I'm
doing this guy's
so coming back from Ibiza I was telling
Steve oh I feel very driven very driven
to do stuff and very excited and full of
energy so today we've been making some
players been chillin and I'm goin
contact with this airplane scrapyard
which I'm going to go to tomorrow and
look at this plane we're going to go and
have a look out then where the wings are
I'm guessing they put them somewhere
else they probably took them out to like
transport the plane and stuff but this
is going to be amazing this is gonna be
where I'm living guys in the middle the
words
II will imagine little tree houses
around it and that's my bedroom like
office space lounge it's going to be so
good
it's gonna be so good we're gonna go
check it out bro I'm just about to head
back and chill with my parents for a bit
so haven't hung out with them since got
back but before I go Steve's got a
little gift for me where you are there
Steve Weiman ray stats bro FTM bracelet
oh yes thumbs it's only little find a
no-mess pouch are these back in stock
and a website I left back in stock now
and we obviously taken their ones
feedback into account and we managed to
lower the prices as well and we've done
some kind of reading and around with
manufacturing and all that kind of stuff
so they are now cheaper now so you can
go check those out
oh and basically how you how you do
these is this works as like a clasp so
this is where you hook that on like that
yeah but obviously that's quite long yet
so you need to resize it so this is a
slipknot and basically you pull that
through like that and you make the loop
bigger yeah yeah and the bigger you make
the loop the tighter is yes I reckon
you're probably about that size
and that goes round okay that goes round
and that literally might be a bit tight
lips on to that perfect you go oh yeah
and then obviously just the bigger the
loop is the smaller is the smaller loop
is the more slack you have fits everyone
there you go guys
awesome I'm so glad they're back in the
stands get my wanna go get your little
bracelets guys before they run out again
see let's eat
thanks for this back by right we're now
going to pick up my dad from school and
I've just been showing my mum and Darcy
my plans for buying this plane and and
this is a picture I pulled off a website
where they've got they do like home
conversions for planes and stuff and
this is just like the bare shell of what
it could look like inside once I've
started my conversion and then there's
endless possibilities we've arrived at
my old school Ben with that up because
he is a teacher for those who didn't
know I'm just walking around some these
old classrooms I used to be in guerrilla
