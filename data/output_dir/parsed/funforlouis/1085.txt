Edwin's not thinking he's gonna go for
the spice thing I'm working on the spice
this one cuz I'm all about that but I
just don't know I hope they'll think it
cuz I don't have this delicious-looking
mango look at this this is this is good
for counteracting spice I'm going for
the volcano dish which says it's very
very hot exactly why one chicken volcano
