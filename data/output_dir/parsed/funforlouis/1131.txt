well Rachel's drive me to the airport
and we've actually driven to the wrong
bit we're actually given to the domestic
departures but we're not running late
which is good that's a good thing
unusual CLA Rachel so I've been told I
have to either pay a hundred and twenty
dollars to take my skateboard on the
plane or I can try and strap it to my
bag so I'm going to try and strap it to
my bag
mmm I should work I cannot believe they
made me strap up my penny ball that's
crazy
so crazy imagine if I'd spent 120
dollars trying to get that the play
stupid this feels strange I'm not
rushing for my flight it's not even
boarding yet it's so funny whenever I go
through security
they scan my bag and I can see it on the
scanner and it's just this mess of wires
and random objects and you can just see
you're like looking at it like
they let it through I didn't exchange in
my bag just went to the toilet before my
flight don't you just hate it when
you're washing your hands and the water
squirts on you and then it's looks like
you've wet yourself embarrassing you can
also brace yourself on the seat in front
of you
my precious

very young should the need arise there's

hi everyone thanks for coming oh that
was so awesome so many cool New
Zealanders came to say hello to me at
the airport
alright let's go thanks for the ride
well I've been sorted our sick hotel
it's not very excited about this I've
heard a rumor that there's a sauna here
I better check in that this is the pond
it's awesome Wow oh yes
well I'm having very relaxing evening
it's so nice to just have some space I'm
cashing out with some friends back in
the UK and like I said I thought I would
take this opportunity to answer a few
deeper questions about my thoughts and
things and few them about my life
so do I ever want a little Lily running
around my life and what's one place in
the world you could live now yeah I'd
like a family
um I can't imagine a traditional married
life with kids but I could have a family
that's not traditional maybe travel
steel or travel at times I don't know I
just I can't imagine a suburban suburban
life yeah definitely a family and in
terms of places I could live I could
like yeah I think I should live
everywhere
I don't know how if I could live in one
place forever
someone's also asked in like five to ten
years time what might I be doing and
kind of depends on YouTube really
depends on whether I can maintain
friendships if I'm in if I'm in a
relationship that it works me still
doing vlogging I think I'd still have to
be vlogging of it if it works I look at
families that flowed a little Shaytards
and that seems to work they're still
doing it they're bit older than me so
yeah why not why not I can still see it
and if it all stops and there's reason
so I have to stop doing it then I find
something fun to do but this is this is
great for the moment someone's saying
that they got ambitious plans for their
future traveling studying abroad charity
work but everyone around them is telling
him it will never happen
how do you stay positive and motivated
to make awesome things happen and block
out people's negativity I think for me
thankfully I've always had people in my
life that are super supportive and super
like they don't cut down my dreams they
just they're like yeah and I realized
not everyone's got that I'd say firstly
try and find people even live online or
whatever that can be supportive and can
encourage you hang around with people
that are encouraging and and you just
don't don't give up the dream dreams
real chase the dream and then lift the
dream it's real and that's enough for
tonight and I've got a really exciting
and activities like a whole itinerary of
activities planned this week all around
New Zealand and yes it's going to be fun
I think I'm going up some really tall
tower in Auckland tomorrow but I'm
looking forward to that
and uh I'll see you guys then peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure boom
