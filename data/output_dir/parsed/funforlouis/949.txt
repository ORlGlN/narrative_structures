I'm exhausted well back home and that
was a lovely day with my relatives and
before we get to sleep on it to tell you
a little story that my dad told me today
which was like amazing whilst we were
driving to Oxford he said last time he
was driving on that road he saw this car
kind of thumb swerve out control and hit
the central reservation on the motorway
flip onto its side and like skid down
and you know into the middle of the road
all the traffic stopped and he said he
pulled over ran over to the car like he
saw a pin who's there as it was
happening run up to the car and saw that
five people were trapped inside so he
said he climbed up until the car and
basically like lifted all these people
up out of it and got him to safety so he
basically like rescued all these people
from the crashed car and I had no idea
he'd never told me until today
I was like yes dad's here right so
anyway there's a nice little story oh
and tomorrow some of you will be happy
to hear this the planet is boat

and months ago like probably six months
ago I'm finally going out on it so many
of you like whatever happens at a bite
and the fact is I've just been out the
country too much I haven't had time to
go out on it but I've organised even
though I think forecast for rain
tomorrow I'm gonna go out of the boat
and go on a little adventure
hopefully with Andy say he got to look
forward to that tomorrow and oh yeah
I'll see in the morning peace out enjoy
life and live the adventure boom
