hi guys my name is Isabella and I'm
currently in Canada in front of the
beautiful Parliament of Canada and the
National Arts Centre and you are
watching good morning guys it's just
gone 6 a.m. we're leaving our hotel and
we're heading to meet the rest of the
production team in Abidjan which is like
an hour away and I did not sleep much
slept like an hour how did you sleep and
a nice nice and I think I think we've
got like a three-hour bus journey once
we get to Abidjan so I'm hoping I can
sleep a little bit there as well is our
taxi
just dropping off the other passenger we
just met with the production team we're
now jumping in some other vehicles and
we're heading off okay this is Darrell
we spot the team where we head in today
no hidden off to get you a download yeah
we're gonna say that stop in the hotel
and then maybe head out to some cocoa
farms later on nice
how far is it it's been a couple of
hours okay you ready for some fun Andy
yeah fun with Andy
guys these are our armed guards that
have been a school in us and I convoy
over here then they're all messes with
us so we've just arrived dog needs help
I pretty much slept the whole journey
they driving for 3-4 hours just sitting
down with some of the crew loved she
said we've got vegetable soup some
boisfontaine I'm quite excited about
this
I loved one thing we're now heading off
in a little Ricky did nearby we're just
meeting all the farmers mojo all of
these farmers we just shaking hands with
belong to a cotton cooperative of
farmers in this place learn a little bit
more about it
is this or the cocoa bean so this gets
shipped to Abidjan yeah cocoa beans you
gon eat you can't even eat any well it's
not bad you can break
and then you can eat this nib inside you
can break that and then nibbler
oh yeah it really does success already
roasted this is so I'm slowly learning
who's who the production team and
everyone that's here and I'll be
introducing you guys to them over the
next couple of days I feel completely
how about yeah I think as much as I try
to overcome jet lag I'm still maybe on
California so I've just been grabbing
little little bits of sleep life on a
journey here after lunch I'm determined
to stay awake for it's the day now and
we're just going to a few locations
directly we're going to be filming the
documentary over the next couple of days
so they're just double-checking the
locations and chats people
I'll tell you guys a little bit more
about this place and how it all works
and how the farmers do stuff together
when we come back here in a couple of
days this was just a really short visit
me the guys we just got coffees and I'm
sitting down with a team all right guys
we just chat and through the plans for
the next couple days I'm gonna be
hanging out these guys learning a bit
about more traditional productions still
quite interesting
guys these are bats flying around the
goodies
I'll talk over these bats ladies you're
crazy
like they travel miles every night they
go like miles and miles and miles do
their thing oh yeah what they did just
going stretching their wings and food
yeah I need to I need to get the
pronunciations we're not asking anything
they don't normally do yes it's
obviously just say what this essentially
covers it covers what work is
appropriate for children and how
bringing women into the formal workforce
can responsibly bridge the lane again so
here each of the paragraphs and we've
gone through we've written example
questions it's not words in the amount
okay we we understand what we're doing
in that paragraph in that setup these
are some questions in the mic so pull
back on the days it is it cool for maybe
just to be prompted with some of those
that's probably the best way to do it
okay now we want to hear it maybe talk
me through on the day I mean I will read
through it yeah a bit of a summary and
in between where you can interject a
little bit of something that you're all
into it with a little bit roughly it's
exactly right
things like Vincennes if we're at the
nursery yeah
getting him just to sort of have a
little moment with himself looking at
just I think you
I didn't think these bats are still
these notes for him I'm trying to upload
my video from my room I'm having some
elements and then Andy just messaged me
saying he's got a bird stuck in his room
I can chase it through the door or not
you gone you've got it
hey are you guys Louie that is amazing
yeah let's show the people tiny okay see
I'm release it into the wild
is it focused yeah look at that guy's
little birdie
he's probably terrified right now a
phrase a bird in the hand is worth two
in the bush
okay then I just take them outside bye
there he goes it's been anything about
an hour
that's cute there we're heading out to
dinner
I think it's walking distance but uh
that's Drive currently Rhonda oh sure
bonsoir
andis been feeling a little rough today
how you feeling now Andy

dish over there no thanks
I'm just good I'm what's this chicken

we are starting the shooting tomorrow
pretty early I think we've got to leave
here 7:30 and then we're driving to the
village that the guys were checking out
today I didn't get a chance to go there
today's being a pretty chilled one I'm
just arriving doing a little recce
kind of talking through what the next
few days are gonna entail and I'm quite
excited to do something you need you
know I haven't done something quite like
this before I'm still a little bit
nervous that I won't go to be as natural
on camera when they're filming me with
the big cameras as I am with you guys
holding my camera like this but we'll
see yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be fun
looking forward to doing something new
