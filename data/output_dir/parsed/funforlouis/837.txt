hello my name's coverage when I'm stuck
on a cliff and the tide is coming in but
you're watching Buffalo you probably
safe in your bedroom enjoy good morning
guys
today is a little bit drier than
yesterday so far but I know that it's
going to last long so we're making the
most of the morning and today we're
heading up here this little mountain
thing here yeah do you think we might do
you think we might avoid the rain first
stop copy
so we're making our way around the
harbor and we're eventually going to
wind our way out lit up this Coralie see
the top is up there somewhere
alright here's a map of this hill we
just we just walked along here around
here and now I guess I'm about to follow
this path all the way up yeah
check out this guy's well it's that I
think it's a dungeon look a prison so do
you think guys I'm gonna climb in this
cave I just found myself a little house
as a sleeping bag and I think we can
climb over here still don't really know
where this place is
someone's sleeping in the corner there
over didn't wake him up
oh really yeah see from down there
I wonder where it leads
I'll know where there is yes Jesus
check out these cannons or look at this
guy I'm gonna bet you down here
might have just popped into this church
at all
I check out the Illuminati symbol in
this church
what Illuminati confirmed
hi lunchtime so for lunch we're getting
loaded little tiny dishes and it's the
best one rice and nuts and curry
these are beef cheeks slow cooks is its
location red wine delicious
well in true Spanish style we are having
a little siesta for a couple of hours or
something see in a bit right I had a
little rest and now we've wandered down
to a little coffee shop again and we're
gonna chill play some cards have a
coffee and escape from the rain because
the rain has set in after our nice dry
morning but my card games begin these
are irrelevant
two things guys firstly we didn't
shuffle despite trying to shuffle these
were the cards dealt in order to us so
clean little shovel secondly in Spain
they don't have hearts diamonds clubs
and spades they have coins fire balls
and then the ways that clubs out clubs
okay maybe they do clubs
those are coins swords cops'll and and
trophies so this is gonna be very
confusing
we've all got traditional Spanish
burgers
we finished dinner and we've strolled
down to the jazz club again see if we
could find any jazz we failed the other
night
these girls tracked us down from Mount a
snapchat
anoche virus aliens
well that was a really nice evening
relaxed listen to what we don't think
was jazz but it was kind of some some
authentic Spanish or South American
music which is pretty cool
the the main woman singing was actually
blind so I just find it fascinating it
must be so much harder to learn how to
play guitar and just generally get
around so it's impressive guys I've got
a bit of a dilemma I go back to my room
I've been editing for a little bit it's
1:00 a.m. something my stomach started
rumbling it's been a long time since
we've eaten and usually I've got some
snacks like bags of nuts and bananas and
stuff and run out of all my snacks I
don't think I'll be able to sleep like
I'm so hungry a little painfully hungry
so I'm gonna take a look wonder and see
what I can find to ate this could be a
bit of a failure as a mission a food
mission but it's worth a try
I am so relieved always after walking
streets - 20 minutes
I found the cobalt place to think about
place open right perfect late-night meal
mission successful so tomorrow is our
last morning in San Sebastian and we are
catching a bus to Bilbao which we're
gonna be staying over the night is
Saturday and then I'm heading back to
the UK on Sunday and I'm quite enjoying
this pretty chilled Spanish excursion
it's good fun it's good to spend some
time and Matt and David or I catch in
the morning peace out enjoy life
live the adventure
