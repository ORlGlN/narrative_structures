we're on our last leg of the Toyota trip
and we're heading back to San Francisco
so this way you can join us in the
Wonder wagon you can just chill in the
back have a look around
Wow
check out our Valley from Allah
now how do you reckon they are
no idea man
think like 3,000 feet
like straight up mountains you need to
go to Alaska man and I think it sounds
good I like the Canada sounds good -
yeah Canada I think you'd love it
every other roadtrip Canada yeah well we
did a little bit and we on the beginning
of the u.s. strip we did we did into
Toronto then across for a few hours in
Canada but then we did all the way up to
Anchorage like through Canada to Alaska
from Vancouver so that was like this
basically
but you didn't feel like you were near
anything like we know with me
civilization in Canada we were like a
thousand miles from anywhere so it was
like forest
is it hard to find gas yeah
as we are coming into Sacramento we're
out of the forest and the big part of
the road trip we're just coming into
civilization again really so have a
little look around yeah
we're going to go visit some friends
they've been good day so most of the
drive this it's lovely it's pretty high
air man Oh what do you think it's been
your favorite moment of all the things
that we've seen probably that magical
day in Yellowstone's breo's and all
those voice in variety love nature mike
byson my voice in all the prismatic
spring and there
I need only found out this trip that
British people say keys are an American
state geyser but yeah I think the
natural beauty and then honestly hanging
out with dusty and evidence being so
nice ya know when you like you meet new
people
well I've known it for a while but you
make that deeper connection you know all
these are these are great people and
these love hang out
you'd they just had a really attractive
way of life and a really fun
they're doing some great experiments and
learning a lot I felt like I've learned
a lot there I think I'd agree mate there
it was it was literally out of this
world the matter the prismatic spring
yeah you were losing it yeah it was like
the moon meets the rainbow meets it was
like going to another planet yeah

and it's been nice to bring you guys
