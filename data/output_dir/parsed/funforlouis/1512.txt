hi I'm Simon and you're watching fawn or
Louie Wow I slips for a long time it's a
well needed sleep they're just grabbing
some lunch by the pool before the ice
swimming competition starts I'm not
showing the timings today because we're
in Uganda and people don't really worked
at the same time constraints as England
but there's gonna be a nice swimming
competition they filled the pool with
loads of ice and thinks of all ice is
arriving and then yeah there's gonna be
lots of cold people and it's all it's
sort of like a big publicity kind of
stunt thing I think to put ginger on the
map perfect and the tourists to try and
improve their tourism and money coming
into the city and stuff
this hotel is incredible such an amazing
view of the Nile I still can't get over
was not expecting this okay the ice is
going in I'm guessing we're starting the
swimming scene
I find African time so funny
yesterday I was told this event was
starting at 1:00 p.m. it's now 6:00 p.m.
Suns on its way down and we still
haven't got any water
I'm a little bit concerned now that I'm
not gonna have to warm up after jumping
in the water but like with less stress
the struggle is strange
I think I'm about to go swimming anistar
pass the Somerset Wow
just in the swim Ashley lost but it's
good fun I feel really pumped like
really accelerated right I don't think
I'm gonna find it's a koozie but I've
heard rumors of a sauna so I'm looking
at the sauna oh it's nice and warm in
here I'm gonna poop I'm just gonna chill
here for a little hair so I've just got
my certificate but taking part in the
ice swimming yeah
yeah
Hey holding ginger together make it
bright II make it better today that's
why we say
so been chillin for a few hours
and I think we're gonna go out to a club
or a bar or something we should be fun
you spend the city bright new day
think we're wandering down to another
bar now apparently it's quite dangerous
to walk around at night but what's the
worst that could happen
Uganda I don't know I'll just hug people
if they come up to me and aggressively
I'll be like hey man what a hug we're
just checking out this guesthouse being
constructed at the moment look at these
cool bamboo lights I think we're gonna
come back all the flesh-eaters to dock
that's pretty cool place we're jumping
in the cab back to the hotel now I'm
sure this like a million there a million
mosquitoes Wow so we're back at the
hotel
there's a million mosquitoes chillin up
there but I'm not seeming to get bitten
I think maybe they're not wanting to
bite me some reason which is cool I'm
happy that can you hear that sound
so anyway it's been quite an eventful
day
I am I failed a swimming the I swim and
my shorts are falling down the whole
time but it was a lot of fun and I think
the great success I don't know what
we're doing the rest of the week I'm
just going along with the flow seeing
seeing what these guys are up to and
just helping out where I can but yeah
