down to dinner shoes it looks like we're
kind of sitting on this little cushions
of floor with the tables a traditional
registan traditional style all right we
are being served by 10 waiters right now

Oh guys if you're wondering where JP
went and he got bitten by something like
he thinks maybe a spider it could have
been a spider or some kind of insects
but um anyway he had to head off early
today he missed out on dinner um we're
gonna head back to the hotel and join
him now we're gonna have to wake up a
taxi driver he's falling asleep
tickle his foot give me a little tickle
okay caches off sealer broke guys if you

so point um updating you on is that when
JC arrives he had his ronan which is
this like big stabilizing rig this
gimbal and we couldn't get it working I
think there might have been something
damaged when he checked in on the flight
and we have just been on the phone to
DJI and they suggested checking all the
cable connections JP got a screwdriver I
opened up part of the I don't know all
the details but opened it up and
reconnected one of the cables and now we
have a working gimbal which we can get
some epic footage with so this is going
to make things this is going to like the
cinematics are gonna get crazy now

hopefully get some very cinematic shots
