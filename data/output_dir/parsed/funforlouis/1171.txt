good morning guys we have the right of
the DreamWorks Studios and I'm gonna go
and meet that guy called mark who's
invited us all to have a tour today I'm
super excited
well it's an amazing start to the tour
we just got treated to a free lunch
let's do a DreamWorks Thank You
DreamWorks it's so much choice I've just
gone for a burger and a chicken burger
but there's like a whole canteen this is
Marty works here he's gonna be our tour
guys and they're not here whoa favorites
this is so random
oh this is amazing so
this guy and so they'd randomly just the
result everything in here I think
they've gone off the street look at
their chills face in the garden this is
amazing this they've got like a
waterfall this is so good
this is not fair like average office
you know what's exciting for me as well
guys is some of you may not know my
background is in animation I've worked
between I've years at Sky TV they like
3d animation so it's going to be super
interesting see where the animation
Suites and what's going on here
are you excited to say does he
and Mark said he's going to take us to
some areas which you usually can't get
to visit as a guest star only areas
so this error is the main hub of
DreamWorks
you might have seen a house but a fish
we've never seen
but can you explain quickly for camera
what this place is at one time decided
hey that's kind of cool so they went
ahead and started hanging out in there
and just chillin after work it slowly
but surely kind of built up to what it
is and they became a hangout um so
you'll kind of see what it looks like
but at some point people found out the
company was like that's not cool but
they decided that yeah it was cool it
was really cool so it is what it is and
it's kind of standing as what it is so
this is the in room welcome and we won't
let's show you guys how we go in here
but this is incredible this is so good
so this is all like not supposed to be
here and there this is like part of the
strut structure of the building
we're in one of the motion capture
friends and there's this tall which he
can basically hold the camera in the 3d
scene we can't show you what's on the
screens but this is this is here
controlling the camera
this is like instead of using a mouse
and computer if we've now wondered down
to the recording she did where they
record voiceovers and all that jazz
my name's Wade
basically the recording engineer here at
DreamWorks actors support all their
dialogue on their lines so yeah they'll
come in and we'll have a you know the
script ready for them and we all know
you can kind of see we'll have some
images if they're the character they're
playing kind of inspiration for them to
get into the character maybe show them
some some footage if that's this is the
motion capture within the mocap stage we
capture body animations so we go find
DreamWorks that was an amazing tour and
