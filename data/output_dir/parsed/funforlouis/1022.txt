well before I head out the house today
I've got a few things to sort I got some
photocopies done next door some forms
I'm just sorting out a few admin things
and just boiled the kettle I'm gonna
make myself a coffee it's actually
really nice day today it was kind of on
and off the weather yesterday I was
talking to rain guys lik who I'm on
skype - it's right Joe Hey Joe has
Australia yeah like the same temperature
is English summer yeah yes we're just
from having a discussion of return of
destroyed nature that's almost England
this summer I think I've almost
persuaded up and then we can actually go
skating skating around London movies
okay well hopefully see you next month
right just posting a letter this is
probably the first letter I posted in
like a year
look at that so organized having a very
productive day so far right still at
home I've just made up this reward
poster and I'm gonna go over to Bethnal
Green now and post this through all the
doors I can think of and I think that's
the probably the last thing I can really
do to help in the search as I'm going
away tonight for four days so they're
jumpin the car is up there I am off
finally on the road
I've got like 150 posters on maybe
something a bit tricky with doors and I
didn't need to stop with an eight first
I'm really hungry and let a bear the
speed on the windscreen mr. bird why he
pooed on my windscreen I just arrived in
Bethnal Green it took about an hour and
45 minutes to drive so I'm cutting it
really fine now to actually get back in
time to get to the airport for tonight
so I need to be as fast as possible
posting these three people's doors
so the laptop change its location around
here so it could be in the slips in the
notice board and I hope so
take you my hair so no one should miss
it this whole block it's uh posted
through the doors as well right I just
spent about 45 minutes giving out these
reward posters and it's have a few
little conversations with people there's
some interesting flats up in that block
and I was trying to Petrie window to see
if I could see my computer sitting on
the side or something but yeah that was
never gonna happen
I've left my email on the posters and
people can contact me but I can't think
what else to do right now and I better
head back otherwise I'm gonna miss the
flight to Ibiza
well the traffic is being pretty insane
today I was hoping to make it over to
Brixton to visit this street gym but
there's just no way to fit it in
I'm usually overly optimistic and it
comes to trying to do as many activities
in the day as possible and today's been
one of those days unfortunately all
right got Home Minister Pak in five
minutes and there's some food waiting on
the table as well which I definitely
need I have not been eating much today

week with all my lost stuff now I'm

doing for like four days I might try and
get a couple of short little videos up
