good morning guys
I'm in London I'm about to board flight
to Miami

like three hours in there what I was
waiting in the lounge
and I was like glancing up at the screen
occasion it's my flight and there's
someone a cent
so I closing
so everyone I think still state girls
don't get to my eyes
so it landed in Miami after another
10-hour flight so basically I did a
10-hour flight to London yesterday and
then rushed onto this next flight 10
hours again and I'm about to get on
another flight to Guatemala

going to Guatemala to visit pencils of

meet me as well so we're gonna get some
fun but I am pretty exhausted

and for the worst decade
sitting up lying at weird angles and
stuff
I cannot wait to get to my hotel

I'm so out with it I literally can't
make sense of anything I'm not gonna go
into graphic detail but I think I have
some my old food poisoning or something

first flights he's not agreeing with me
and I'm just gonna sleep it off I just
felt terrible
very achy stomach cramps anyway I'm
gonna stop complaining but I am glad to
be here I've got Ebola
