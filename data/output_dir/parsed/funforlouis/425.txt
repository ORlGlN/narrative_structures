good morning guys it's about 9:00 a.m.
yeah we had a bit of sleep not a lot but
we had a bit the other is actually
stayed in some hotels in town where are
we carmel-by-the-sea
we're in the Monterey we're in Monterey
but it's near that place and there we're
going to go pick everyone up and cruise
into San Francisco we got some meetings
today got some exciting medians and
hopefully the old one the bug is all
right from last night's adventures if
you didn't see yesterday's vlog there
was a fire basically those if there's a
big fire in the engine and I think it
survived from what we can tell strips
are about faith patience and
perseverance and also hopefully no more
fire extinguishers I don't think that
you can take another class like last
night here we are
oh it's alive
so we've just parked up at the hotel the
guys stayed at and whilst they're coming
down and getting ready I'm going to
stick live the adventure dog club across
the back here
hey guys live the adventure club how are
you guys doing we got separated last
night yeah you miss some drama you miss
some drama though huh despite that you
did the truck is over I'm actually
disappointed over there is it okay is
that it's a girl coming over look coming
over that I can't believe the mood
iran's got such high vines yeah living
the adventure despite fire fire fire are
you feeling this one and alex that couch
is really comfortable yeah but we're all
together now one big happy family
ah I lost my wallet those guys having a
fire and losing your wallet and one
night it's not a great thing but I'm
still feeling happy this is the
adventure crew these are the boys that
we're gonna tackle any issue that we
come across maybe maybe I find maybe
it'll catch fire again
no no so guys we've arrived in Silicon
Valley we've got a few meetings like I
said but we've stopped by a VW
specialist to have a little look at any
damage we did last night and just clean
up the engine and stuff we're gonna
leave this here and then head out and do
some things and then hopefully we can
get it sorted so we can head off in the
next hour or so
because it's pretty beautiful locations
we're going to head up to why is this so
important but that's all the hot air
from exhaust come to the front and suck
to the hip fan and go there is a common
cold air so this is something is gonna
take a little time but today I can maybe
give a rough estimate what we need to do
so this is our new CEO that needs
related reality this you need to
know Racing the old seal is now fuse
yeah I don't know if you heard guys but
we're gonna have to leave this till
tomorrow probably noon tomorrow before
we can get that seal replaced I thought
it was like a random seal but apparently
it stops it from overheating we've
arrived at the boost dasboard
headquarters we were supposed to get
earlier but a bit of delay where you say
Alex like kind of swap boards midair I
did it before
Robin alley what are you doing what's
going on here no right Marcos on a
surfboard a boosted surfboard can I stay
on the couch yeah right whoa I think
we're gonna crash I think we're gonna
crash

boost Abroad Office and I think they're
going for some dinner
me and Sam and Sam weird both of us all

little meeting we GoPro about some
exciting ideas and I'm hoping there

ones I've broken wires sorry this is
Jesse he's going to take us around
yo image all international social media
accounts Michael I might throw in a
little tour oK we've left GoPro we were
basically pitching quite an exciting
idea to them but I can t tell you much
about it but if we make any progress
you should get very excited because you
know we've been thinking taking it to
the next level with adventure and stuff
and yeah things could get pretty crazy
over the next year I'm hoping we've just
grabbed a bite to eat and we have
fantastic news guys I just got a call
from the guy that we dropped the van
offer and he is managed to fix
everything he said best-case scenario
would be tomorrow at noon but he's a
legend and he managed to get it all
sorted he like clean the engine out he
put a new like exhaust and shield on
which is apparently white over heat in
the first place and yeah he's like put
the insulation foam and we're all good
to go even though I lost my wallet I
managed to pay over the phone and we
just need to go and collect it
so we're just going to chill do a little
video that Jesse wants to film we're
going to do like a skating video of the
booster boards I think we're going to
roll up head north Jesse tell us the
plan what's the plan what we do Mike so
