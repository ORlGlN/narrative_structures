in some random cafe I found quite near
where we staying tonight
every male with these boys how we doing
yo Ollie and George are you guys there
good you do sleep well in your car the
seat backs were on the windows in system
and tell us what their most amazing
thing about this cafe is that they

everybody crashed down okay doors what's
your suffers though hardens just sex me
saying that we are meant to go to Finn

us effectively ain't nowhere to stay
oh there so it's now a case of trying to
find somewhere else or air B&B
maybe we can all share interesting going
on
let's roll so the others are on their
way and we've decided to go down to a
lake nearby we also had some good news
the problem with the Airbnb is all
sorted now so we are checking in at five
the river idyllic lake called Pine Crest
Lake and these boys are getting lathered
up it's gotta be good
we're yeah we're good at 25 cents under
maybe some kayaking maybe a little swim
this is crazy
we're not the first ones that the idea
of coming to Pine Crest Lake so sweet we
just need like this time yeah there's a
lot of people should get boat and go out
that way
we have just rented two motor boats for
all of our life jackets and we're about
to head out flat to ours we don't know
where everyone else that are they
apparently arriving soon but we've got
no phone reception so we just have to
keep a lookout from the boat
life love it now we didn't show daughter
we have stopped by a roofer little river
alex is going to go do some fly fishing
yeah you gonna catch some dinner and we
particularly gonna go for a little hike
now we're gonna do a little bit up there
we were warned there's a bit of a storm
brewing and it looks like it's over
there
you're not sure when it's gonna hit I'm
hoping this thunder and lightning there
is we pull into got our boats back over
there before we get you know struck by
lightning and stuff we're gonna follow
this little creek up here we might get a
little swim as well and I quite like as
well ways because it's quite remote like
it's isolated you can't just park your
car and walk over here you have to get
by or hike there's not tons of people
here either
we found this epic bridge that looks out
over the lake I'm gonna walk across it
it's a little bit shaky
well

just finished a little photo shoot on
the bridge and we are now tricking back
down to the boats oh I think we're
pretty late we're having for two hours

rations a fishing rod amazing we need to
organize that of course oh it's rapid
