good morning guys
we have cruised over to the other side
of the island today and I'm still
hanging out these boys from the wine
base out here where we head in today
what's the place we're going to Narnia
yeah apparently some cool waterfalls
maybe we can go swimming
yeah I'm excited I haven't visited any
waterfalls in Hawaii on this trip yet so
it's about time okay there's some guava
is hanging on the trees here good that's
right this is the gates Narnia thank you
that is a that's an interesting gate
make sure you close it yes
heading over to do most people are just
going in there swimming stuff because
there's a high chance I'll fall in the
river I've got so much gear on me that
would be bad that'd be really bad
this is
is very sketchy
we're just walking along this little
Ridge here and it's quite a head strong
current I can feel it trying to sweep my
legs out from below beneath me managed
to get across the first obstacle I had
to put my cameras away because I needed
both my hands now we are
trekking through this little bit of
undergrowth here to get to the next to
the main waterfall where there's like an
area to swim and stuff
right have to cross this little bit of
this little stream before we got up to
the big water so this doesn't look super
deep
it's just dawned on me guys from dipping
my feet in and also seeing other
people's reactions to the water
temperature that is absolutely freezing
guys you're gonna be disappointed in me
I chickened out I just decided you know
we're going to be doing other things
later I don't want to get super cold now
you know what like with a cold
it's really nice it's chilly in there
watching those guys jumping into stuff I
think I'll wait until there's like kind
of a more like a warm water swimming who
I think would be more ideal for me I
think even the sea is a lot warmer than
this
another day another day
okay these guys are heading across in
this contraption we found it's like a I
don't know what this is it looks like a
zip line when you go into the middle
they just leave you in the middle
all right back out of the gate
sylia Narnia very very cool
guys this is my favorite plant so
beautiful I corrupt with one of these
plants in my bedroom it wasn't as big as
s so this is like a massive massive
block these leaves are insane right back
of the car we're gonna go and get some
is it lunchtime if I even always be
dinnertime I think oh no a spare time
or pikes we're heading into this burger
joint
thankfully they they have vegan options
thank you
okay we just had a delicious meal we're
now we're now making a plan to go and
find the lava flow the volcano
last time I was in Hawaii they this
recent lava flow hasn't started but it's
lava flowing into the sea currently and
I've seen some of the other guys come
and visit it so I'm gonna go and try and
find it it's raining right now I'm
hoping it's not raining where the
lockers so guys we've driven about 45
minutes we've stopped this place I don't
know where we are but we are
I followed instructions of where to go
to walk to the lava in fact we might
actually be able to cipher there's like
some bike rental place there
guys little problem these bikes don't
have mud guards and if you can look over
here this is what happens when you don't
have a mouth guard on your bike this
would suck if you had to walk here guys
1.5 miles to go until the lava saying a
danger volcano fumes are hazardous to
your health and may be life-threatening
getting there wouldn't see little
glimpses of lava I'm hoping we just see
like a raging torrent of lava into the
sea but I don't know maybe maybe we're
going tonight any larvae we see
basically is a bonus I say into these
guys I'm just enjoying this bike ride
regardless this is so fun we've parked
up a bike's locked him up and we are
gonna head down to where the lava meets
the scene well we just met someone who
said it's this way so as we're walking
on check this out this is a this is the
ground look at this this is like just
ripples of molten lava just I guess well
it's not molten anymore
I wonder how old this is probably not
that old this is really it's just really
bizarre and it's like shimmering yeah it
feels really light as well as in it like
it's like it's full of air it's almost
like rope or like Platts like people
like head it's so easy to imagine like
what this was like when it was molten
and like how it formed and like flowed
everywhere and we hey guys we have
spotted the lava definitely not a
torrent definitely not like a massive
flow of lava but
do you know what's crazy here is we're
watching land form we're watching like
the country expand or not the country
the state I guess USA is getting bigger
right here everywhere you scan here at
one point energy Disney's birthday
I can feel the warts again okay with
back at the bikes that was quite an
adventure as pretty epic seeing new land
form like in front of our eyes that was
yeah that's pretty special
that's the first me
hey sorry we're late we had a we had a
bit more fun out there than we time the
2-hour ride home please we are back
we're back in Kona it's gone one a.m. I
need to go and do some editing now I'm
still crashed on the couch it's been
really awesome hanging with these guys
I've got lots to process and tell you
about but it's been it's been a pretty
um yeah it's been a pretty significant
stop on this trip and yeah I won't go
into it all now but it's been like
spiritually restorative restorative
replenishing I don't know you know I'm
trying to say it's been great
alright I'll catch in the morning peace
out enjoy life and live the adventure
