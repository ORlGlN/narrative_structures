as you know
yes land last night in Hamilton New York
just to yeah avoid bad weather and it's
licking okay
the weather to Boston now it's flyable
so we're just about to depart we stayed
in the National almost no down the road
thankfully walking distance from the
little airport as funny as those walk
across with my backpack one of the guys
in the construction site so that you but
you can take it plane from there you
know that ya don't like either where you
go that's like Boston it's Hardy planes
to Boston from it I was like no we ever
played
anyway it's funny
approach time everyone there I can fall
with you climbing through 4104 7,500
third cylinder at a uniform Syracuse
approach good morning group Delta
missionary what's the best retail at
work I sorry I have the baby goat
okay scenario is we depart for Greenland
the day after tomorrow what's today we
depart for green and on Friday okay
worst case we buy this battered a
Saturday Sunday I love it because this
looks so far yeah but because of the
projection of Wow yeah it's so these are
this is much shorter actually so the
distance we flew across the u.s. now is
the same distance that we can apply to
cherien 0xo uniform contact approach one
to four point four
what do you 4.4
guys we found food Dominic's diner JP
what is the name of the town we just
flew into it's not actually Bosphorus
Lawrence
okay so we're we're not far from Boston
we didn't fly into the main
international Boston Airport but we're
ready for food this is our breakfast
okay guys we have met Matt he's just
come to join us the airport he's gonna
be flying with us he's gonna be
overseeing the flight because he is
actually flown around the world before
so we're gonna flee with the youngest
okay not just everybody the youngest so
yeah he's gonna be joining us for the
next two weeks three weeks see I'm sick
Chrissy
we're just gonna convince him to drop
out of MIT and he is just finally
brought over some stuff we had delivered
including this new Garmin tracking
device which means you guys hopefully
will be able to keep up with our trip
that was the plan from the beginning
that we had some issues with the other
device we were using and I'm sorry if
you'd been wanting to track us ever to
that as of today or tomorrow we'll get
this guy working
it's exciting
yeah don't touch that bye okay we've
finished lunch JP and Matt have had to
shoot off in the plane to a nearby
airport to get a few final tweaks done
just to make the make sure the plane is
running as best as it possibly can for
the next couple of legs nothing major
just some just some tweaking and I've
opted to stay behind to catch up with
the vlogs so I've just been sitting down
editing in this lovely lounge here it
was the airport Falcon air and but yeah
yeah it's another one of those days kind
of sway ting and we're hoping either
tomorrow or the next day will be flying
up to Goose Bay in Canada and then from
there on to Greenland but maybe today or
tomorrow I could finally get around to
trying to map out the entire journey for
you guys I know a lot you've been asking
like why didn't you do the map yet but
we we have been talking lots about
different places and yeah I'll do my
best
we've still got the map sitting in the
plane so yeah I'll pull that out later
the autopilot is better yeah outlet
works Oh what was the problem the actual
wire was just the guy was like yeah and
these are all claims the actual wire
just gets to all and like the internal
resistances oh she just had to replace
the wire okay we're gonna find somewhere
to stay for the night I think pretty
much all the little issues with the
plane to be sorted Dave here we got
mostly issue storage now they're not
major not met they aren't like serious
thing they're just more we want to get
everything perfect yeah
the main thing is we can charge our
iPhones and iPads now so we can watch an
effort sold away yep me too actually
perfect so that's the biggest priority
and then the autopilot and artificial
Rises and stuff that secondary honestly
my spirits have lifted about 30% since
that's good it is lessens the stress
loads significant I'm happy but make me
happy man well I'm super bummed so I'm
fine you have you do yeah okay we have
driven it to Boston after getting a
quite nice dinner over in wherever we
were
I always do this we were in a small
airport just outside arrested Lawrence
got dinner and now we're staying with
Matt he's finally letting us crash in
his room we were gonna get our own room
here but they haven't got any available
so thankfully there's a sofa bed I mean
JP again they were spent okay I've just
headed out of the hotel because we are
trying to activate a new satellite
device that we can use on the plane for
you guys to track us you know we've been
having problems over the last few days
trying to get the tracking device
working anyway I have this this new
Garmin inReach device that we just set
up so it needs to acquire a GPS fix and
they can't do it from inside the hotel
rooms they get outside war
open sky is sending activation so guys
I've managed to set it up so every two
minutes it pings our location so there
it's pinged us in the middle of Boston
check that out your hair white the boys
are asleep I'm gonna get some sleep -
it's so exciting to have Matt join us
and I'm glad that that's just a leaving
a little bit of the pressure on JP
tomorrow the plan is we're going to
start heading up through Canada and then
from there continue onward east around
the world so I think we're going to be
going to Greenland and Iceland in the UK
and yeah that's gonna be joining us for
all of those legs also he has a YouTube
channel guys which I'm gonna link below
so you can check out his videos they're
primarily aviation stuff and then he
does a bit of travel adventure vlogging
as well but yeah go and check him out
show him some love he's yeah he's just
so valuable to this trip and we can be
doing it without him
so yeah thanks Matt and yeah we'll catch
you tomorrow as we head into Canada
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
