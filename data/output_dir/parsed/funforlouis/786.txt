airport Upington Airport and we're
trying to figure out how to get to our
plane
planes just landed he's on the big
runway or not
the big ones just left crazy long
medicine
we lost our cover guys there was like a
cover over the plane
there's only velcroed on and I think it
like blew off somewhere so we're hoping
to find it
it found it yeah it's crazy being parked
here next to these commercial flights
that are coming in I'll play lick so
tightly and good news guys before we
take off even though we've had our
possible stance the security like the
widget cooler the customs lady said that
we are allowed back in the terminal tur
to get some breakfast release Jim please
manage to fuel up while finishing
breakfast and so much time to go guys is
managed to mount the GoPro and I'm
picking out wide by 2 my iPad and there
we can see this crater in the Sun you
see that that's the shot from the GoPro
so I'll be controlling it from inside
the cockpit
oh wow yay again guys another incredible
landing by JP I'm always just slightly
nervous as we're just about the hit of
look like but yeah we're here we're in
the middle
JP gone inside to check with someone
maybe that we need to just get a
passports checked and you know
officially arrived in the country but
yeah this is the 62nd country I've been
to and I'm excited I want to explore a
lot more of Africa it's funny cuz inside
it smells like new movie though really
so not it might be a but like just what
you remember when you're here just
public buildings over here smell like
this smell apparently is like one of the
strongest memory sensors we have it's
not a problem
as long as we can see it yeah alright
now we've come through the customs and
got a passport stamped in Namibia we're
now heading to another like remote town
and we're hoping the weather is good
enough to land good check yep I can hear

oh yeah oh yeah the best oh right that
is such a sick feeling of them right

town now yeah now I just need this it
looks like it's like like couple of
miles away

doesn't blow away
hello thanks for coming to get us
education good well we weren't sure
sorry Lily then yeah SlideShare and CV
we weren't sure entirely when we were
coming in or the flight conditions and
stuff so we didn't manage to get phone
signal okay so this is where we're
staying tonight the van't hoff hotel
maybe again just to fill in the book
yeah sure so we throw enough stuff in
our room and we've come out for the
number one priority for us is to get SIM
cards so we have internet so we've gone
down the road apparently it's a place
over here and once they've done that can
you go get some food
probably it's probably lunchtime I think
it's almost dinner dude it's literally
on dinner
we got our SIM cards unfortunately
they're only Micro SIM so we're going to
cut them down to nanos fitnah iPhones
and then this is how you top-up credit
apparently you know you have to top-up
each one individually 1050 random things
wait what's the currency out here right
the delicate operation is beginning one
of the things else is famous for is this
big herd of wild horses that's been
roaming around here for like a hundred
years or something and we are going to
go out and find them the guy picked us
up earlier is it's got this big vehicle
we're going to go out and a bit of a
hunt before the Sun sets we've postponed
off food they're holding it really like
for when we get back so I'm pretty
excited have you seen these guys before
these horses out of the area
yeah not up close so different things
wild horses crazy
the
there is still to this little lookout
area some setting horses are chillin
over there I'm getting is a bigger herd
forces some around there let's just to
them it's quite amazing to think these
horses totally wild like from a hundred
years ago the amount of generations
going down they've never been tamed or
kept floor
cheers GP thanks for inviting me out

that on the veer anymore but I sort of
wish I do

fascinating me and JP are now very
hungry and I've just been delivered a
big piece of animal I don't know what it
