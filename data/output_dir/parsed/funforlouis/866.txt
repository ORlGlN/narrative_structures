hello my name is Rupert I'm from
Melbourne Australia and you are watching
fun for Louie enjoy hey good morning
guys it is our last day in Queenstown
we're actually heading off just after
lunch
flying back up to the North Island
before we do we are trekking down to
catch the gondola up to the top of this
mount and are we gonna do some losing at
the top
the amazing thing of this lose place is
that they've got helmets that fit me
I've got a GoPro mounted on so we're
going to get small to purge all right
you'll begin to stay inside of the
closet both - must always be on your
handlebars yeah
Oh
Rhaego
guys that last right oh me that car
was like lightning I don't know it was
different about it but I got so much air
in one of the hills I jumped the whole
hill Landler bottom well this is our
last run guys has had seven races so we
got made this one count
this could get extreme
ah
amazing how was that guy's mind-blowing
so much funner than I thought I could
classify real life so good how do you
find a Jenner it was very good you guys
are pretty tough stuff sure enough to
get smash yeah alright we're back we're
just getting our bags together probably
people having showers some stuff out
before we go and we just had a little
group interview for devan's behind the
scenes channel stay tuned in still for
Saturday really these guys they make
this project happen guys with Louis so
super thanks to these guys check out
their channel right now absolutely guys
I haven't really plugged these guys
probably yet but they have been the
people that made this whole thing happen
and they've done it some incredible
videos around New Zealand that's
actually why Devon originally saw them
as people we can work with and do stuff
with so I'll link them below but you
haven't already go subscribe go and give
some support to them and yeah like Devon
was saying for the behind the scenes
here this is all like one big happy
family and we're all in it together
every one of us even Louie and it's kind
of sad that this is our lost kind of
moments together before we all head up
yeah big crime time we had you know
together as a family but if that's what
happens like when you're filming
everyday traveling together you do
become a family dude Anna Carter was
telling me like he has his wife and
child back home he's like this is real
close and you just kill me so and you
work and you go through the bad things
and good things together no one just
goes really close together you learn so
much about everyone here so she's been
amazing about these guys this dinner
will soon and girl a woman will packed
up get into the van and then fearful
we're saying goodbye to the RV's
unloading all our bags about to catch a
shuttle to the airport
look at all our gear miles so much you
don't realize until it's all together in
one place let's go hey Jordan and
general they're flying straight to
Wellington yeah
yeah I'm just grabbing some lunch before
I get on the plane got some fish and
chips
this fish is delicious good cheeky
little puppy as well
very warm welcome talking for your
safety must remain seated with your
seatbelt fastened until the seatbelt
sign is turned off well we're back in
Auckland that's a bit faster than
traveling down by the ferry like I did
on the way down to the South Island all
right I think these guys now catching an
onward flight to the US now I'm going to
hungry staying here for a little bit
so I thought it'd be a cool idea just to
stick with these guys before they get
their next fight to states but we've
been sitting here for I think like two
hours since we landed then trying to
check in there extra backs and it seems
like a very convoluted process so we're
not really sure what's going on they're
like walking back and forth and so it's
lucky their flight wasn't a bit earlier
although out they would have definitely
missed how are you guys getting on is it
bit of is it being a bit crazy trying to
check in on your extra math class it
comes back yeah I'm very expensive but
we're happy and we gain mine well it's
that sad moment I say goodbye to these
guys we've actually already had our kind
of emotional goodbyes but it's been
incredible being emotional seen an
adventure and tear-jerking
yeah these guys are heading off in the
next leg all the way to LA and then on
to Utah you can't take it you can take
but yeah bro thanks for inviting me on
the trip and enjoy your flight back I
always look at the camera but it's right
there we love Lily so thank you guys
yeah yeah well I hope I hope you rest on
the flight Bruce bye
well what an incredible couple of weeks
with those guys that was intense
I think things are going to slow down a
little bit with the pace I think I'm
going to have slightly longer liens now
and not getting up super early in the
adventures but the plan is and stay in
Auckland tomorrow I'm actually going to
pick up a hippie camper van and then
drive up north
hey guys I left the hotel gonna head out
for dinner this is JP you may have
spotted them in these sand boarding
vlogs
guys we found the Nando's so I'm super
excited I'm going to get a half chicken
turns out all the Nando stuff no need to
get one each single
all right I've got my extra hot chicken
got some corn hairy Perry chips what a
feast awesome Cheers it turns out JP had
a couple of penny boards in his car that
was had a little skater out of this car
park
Oh have a great evening
as cool scene JP and we've got a fun day
planned tomorrow and yeah Wow
I think I'm going to be able to relax a
little bit now that Devon and the team
have left I'm kind of sad though it's
been an amazing few weeks like I've seen
before and if you haven't you need to go
