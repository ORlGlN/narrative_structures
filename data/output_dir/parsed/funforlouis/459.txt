the Instagram shirts I'm trying to look
like an explorer I'm exploring look it's
not ideal flip-flop terrain
this is a little bit rescuing I've
decided to cross this river in
flip-flops on really slippery rocks with
both my a 7s and my ace of an R and a
spare lens it's quite a fast flowing
river I do not want to slip
literally thousands of dollars Oh we'll
be ready
this is literally ankle breaking
territory okay stay on the dry rock stay
on the dry rocks shot of the water
trickling down these rocks basically I'm
doing a slow shutter speed like a long
exposure of the water and it's looking
really silky to watch this
check out that filter guys
look how silky and flowy the water
that's that one second exposure all
right let's see if I can make it back
across
