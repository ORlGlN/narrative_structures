Steve before they head off from their

jealous yeah
three-way three-way booty just come up
with a cheeky idea basically this hasn't
been long enough hanging out Ben and
Steve so they need to get a lift to the
airport in the morning so I've offered
even that's gonna be sick where early to
pick them up and Rodney and something's
so good about spending time with a place
for inside and then though you have to
destroy I'm just so happy to see
benefits like now I think it's that
deeper connection with someone that like
a strong but you've got with with
someone especially after having not seen
them for
a while
so positive - say it again
right back my parents we're gonna have
some family time tonight
I think we're cooking some food I might
get involved with some cooking mom tell

of going to Brazil again and it's very
nice to have Louie with this yeah so

me and I'm already getting the Brazilian
spirit and I'm so looking forward to it
guys because some of you may not have
reserved my favorite country and we're

actually gonna pull an all-nighter
because it's such an early start giving
Ben and Steve a lift to the airport in
the morning for me as well but I've been
doing some things one of which guys
remember I slept on the street with Jeff
last week and we're trying to raise some
money to get his vana stuff sorted or

raised seven and a half thousand dollars

like up and share the story and see if
we can spread the word about his
campaign and get him off the streets
