good afternoon guys we are leaving
Kangoo today and we are heading down to
Illawarra which is like the southern
Western temple of the island and before
we go we're going to go and get some
food where we ate last night this is a
very very good place we've got some
elbow on toast there dummy a scrambled
tofu until asked for isn't it let's hit
the road
so guys we've just arrived and this
incredible place I'm hoping this is the
right place that we burps because if
it's this is insane look at this view
oh my gosh please tell me this is where
we burped what
yeah check out this place I love the
real I love that we have a Christmas
tree yes I am going straight in there
left side of the bed Rams open-plan
kitchen it's all water this is mine rise
bedroom then outdoor shower
this is one of the nicest places we've
ever stayed how much 100 like 2530
dollars a night
there's no really bedrooms yeah say guys
if you want to stay somewhere incredible
for not much money Bali is your place
oh my gosh that was so bad oh my gosh
I've got the battery out quick so I
think it is need to drive this happened
in a river and we it went underwater big
vat of rice for five minutes yet I'm
like yeah I think this is gonna Louie I
was out front and I heard a grunt oh no
this is why you got to already be
recording I put my camera down for one
minute I got some yogurt ham and if the
step is like what's that noise when I go
it's a drug in here well I think is the
honey ready to catch and then for some
reason it just went up by itself because
your attitude Ronit since you were in
front of it oh no I turned them to back
to normal so it didn't have front
forward sensors I don't know that's why
it went up bro it happened to be in the
ocean I believe it in the Sun it should
dry out alright and the reality sets in
that was definitely my fault I was there
just a bit lazy and I didn't want to
land over here when it to catch it
I forgot that there's an umbrella there
and then boom in the water first time
I've crashed it though it's annoying
that was in water thankfully it wasn't
in salt water so I'm hoping it will dry
out and I think it should I think it
should
oh I'm late for a swim
that's how long the day I'm gonna go for
a swim
is great this is awesome if everywhere
could have crashed so trouble II get it
yeah none of the propellers broke early
that's good I feel like it's better than
stalling from a great big height I saw
is taking this join for a little spin
look at this hotel I'm a class bro I
might be the one we drove up to flying
you're drying around it's a very cool
way to explore your surroundings or at
least like situate yourself like find
out where you are I've gotten to the
point now where if I don't fly my drone
in any city I don't really know like
what it looks like yeah it's like almost
like like playing a video game and then
like hitting pause and looking at the
map being oh right I gotta go down there
Konica so before we head out to dinner
I'm trying to draw out my drawing a
little bit of this hairdryer I found
to live with me yeah when do I get his
heroin he sit on the couch for like five
straight hours trying to dry his
dreadlocks this is pretty much that yeah
I do like hair dries it doesn't smell
burnt or anything no that's a good sign
but look at the lens oh is what that is
moisture it's like a beautifying Felton
that's in hazy mmm then I'm gonna have
to leave this out in the Sun sonority
dry slaw so guys we're heading out and
I'm leaving my drone under the aircon
it's pumping down I think an air
conditioning units dry air I think
because I always feel like I've got a
dry mouth in the morning and I've been
sleeping with a heckler and just now my
battery lit up so there might be a good
sign oh it's a doormat I know where that
goes
we've hit into a little bit of a
complication on our way to dinner
Google Maps seems to be taking us off in
all sorts of directions none of which
are leading to the restaurant we're
running out of daylight are the sun's
going to be a nice sunset but we're
probably going to miss it now and and
also we've completely run out feel like
the orange fuel gauge has been on for
like probably the last it turned on
before we even got to our place so it
says we've got zero kilometers left in
the fuel tank right now I have faith in
you okay full faith you feel about this
one Ryan you know just another day with
Louie welcome to my life another day
fire yeah
I realize the reason why is so hard to
get is because everyone drives mopeds
here no one no one drives cars told you
so
so the directions would have been
correct haven't been on mopeds but a car
okay
it apparently
hello we are table for four
all right check out this beetroot and
check the hummus all right this is the
vegetable paella boy leaves cauliflower
dinner was delicious and we now have to
go back but we have zero petrol in the
car so I found a petrol station that's
seven kilometers away it's a 16 minute
drive because it's like tiny little
roads I'm hoping we make it I'm hoping
we make it if not it will be it will be
funny he'll be a bit of fun adventure
well guys as I as I suspected
there wasn't any problems we made it we
got everything Louie yes bro yeah yes we
could just go back and then yeah
tomorrow let's do it we're just having
going yesterday when we run out yeah
that's right
what you wanna do right she hasn't
spoken to me guys we were just laying
down and the whole room started shaking
is it common to have earthquakes in Bali
that's what I want to know was that an
earthquake it felt like what I've
experienced that bugs to be in the past
just like weird like the whole rooms
like I'm moving a little bit I said it
recruit boy so it's just looking Twitter
I need to learn people are tweeting it
big earthquake every summer and it's all
over whoa
well it's 2:00 in the morning thankfully
there is no aftershocks from the
earthquake the little earthquake we had
that was kind of crazy still can't
believe that happened but it's been a
good day school to relocate down to the
southern tip of barley I'm looking
forward to doing some exploring around
here I think the plan tomorrow is we're
going to go and meet up with Josh and
Cody and go and explore an abandoned
theme park so hopefully that works out
yeah I'll catch in the morning peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure they
