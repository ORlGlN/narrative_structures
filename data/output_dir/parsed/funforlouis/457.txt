good morning guys very exciting day
today we are about to head out in that
boat and go and meet some dolphins we
just spoke to the lady she said it takes
anywhere between five minutes to an hour
to find the dolphin just jump in and
swim in it there might even be baby
dolphin something is that you can store
some gear in there
Sergi
we are in dolphin territory
looking for the doctor we haven't found
any dolphins yet but we're heading north
of the coast in the shallows so this
thing we got a nice car window here with
you
hold your breath
make a wish count to three
that was incredible
we're illiterate I could have reached
out in touch with dolphins they were so
close and then at one point there's like
a hundred of them underneath us women
bro how sick was that I had this one way
I swam really far down there's a whole
part and one of the Dolphins from the
flood came absolutely dizzy girls enjoy
that
Wow you know there's nothing he's not
loud
you could hear them like clicking an
organ it we've arrived at the next spot
the guy was saying that there's a lot of
turtles here they get cleaned by the
little are they little fish the cool
little fish and they wait for the next
hill to be cleaned and then they like
line up waiting that's pretty cool today
we're gonna jump in and explore the reef
yay did you enjoy that Riya I know what
they were saying they're probably saying
hey that was so amazing dolphins and
turtles time for lunch

strawberries yeah spread it
check this out
oh it looks so bad yeah it's cuz you
were snorkeling you see your whole back
alright time for a little snack before
we dive nick has decided to take the
throne up even though we're in a very
rocky boat right now
sink or swim or in this case fall out
the sky this is probably one of the
riskiest things ever bro that is sunset

this is an epic epic sunset is moody
clouds and lacrosse the boat alright
let's just tucking away behind that
clown nick has found the spot that we're
going to be diving he's found the little
light
coming into land we're not but you're
gonna be able to land this flat like the
raw feed about is I'm gonna have to
catch it again
yeah
we're getting suited up guys I am taking
this tripod down and this 360 camera
down I'm really hoping it works it's
time come on come on baby
snapchatting guys go follow Nick on
snapchat he he needs more of you and
snapped he snapped way more than me and
they're all entertaining say I don't
blog I wasn't yes what is it I'll link
it underneath is off do that it is time
it's time to get in the water let's do
this
guys that was unbelievable however was
that is that one of the best things
you've done oh yeah make what did you
think every tire came out really big
problem though guys I as soon as I took
my underwater rig down the 360 it filled
with water for some reason so I may have
broken all my GoPro
I don't think the Eclipse you would have
seen really give it justice there's this
immense just feeling of just being
completely overwhelmed by the sheer size
of those manta rays and just the other
night I just fall in love more and more
with marine life the more I scuba dive
and snorkel and just get to spend time
in the water it's just ah I feel amazing
even though we did have a bit of a
mishap tonight as I was saying on the
boat this 360 underwater housing when I
unscrewed it to put it on the tripod I
didn't realized that that is a direct
hole into the housing so it just filled
up with water and I saw when I was
underwater I just saw this like half
filled with the water with these four
GoPros in and I was like ah so I had to
swim it back up to the boat it's all a
bit frantic managed to get up the boat
and there the guy Danny who is steering
the bike steering the boat driving the
boat he thankfully kind of undid it and
took them out and they started to dry
out a little bit I'm not sure they're
working yet I'm gonna try them out but
yeah that is it has been the problem
tonight and when we left because we're
in a hurry and we want to do it or swim
before we come up to the surface or we
actually lost
the tripod stand I used for my 360
videos as well so that sucks
hopefully someone will find it before I
leave Hawaii and I'll be able to get it
back but overall none of that affected
my mood or my enjoyment of the
experience it was just so so epic and I
will catch you guys in the morning for
I'm gonna say the next few days guys
please keep tuned in to all the vlogs
because the the activity activity
we have planned our unbelievable like
tomorrow we're going hiking up a volcano
to do one of the number one things in my
bucket list which is to see a live magma
like lava flow like there in front of us
coming out with volcano yeah I am so
excited for that as well right I'll see
in the morning
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
