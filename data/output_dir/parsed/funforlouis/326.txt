good morning guys
I have got an uber into Manhattan today
from Brooklyn before we catch off flight
to Mexico because last night I tried to
pick up my lens that was being delivered
to me but it wasn't UPS didn't leave it
at the access point they said they have
so I now have to come into Manhattan and
buy the lens because I can't really
continue especially traveling around
beautiful areas without this zoom lens
so very annoying but I'm gonna have to
buy the boat a minute so I've got just
enough time before we have to continue
on today okay also yeah I think this is
the one
all right I got the lens this is the bad
boy
so vital right to the airport and now
with Briah
she had to go and leave some stuff in
their sister or forgot some stuff this

gate and it's just started boarding so

pajama boats under my jeans that's how
polar bears outside

different restaurants

same what's this the sushi

this is like the exact opposite to being
in New York right now like so warm so
happy to be here
this is this is definitely more my
natural habitat what you saying oh yeah
being able to walk around at night with
no jacket to me is like what I need like
it's just cool that we found each other

explore this place during the day we we
couldn't see a lot tonight but we're
wandering around a little bit but
because we got here just as the Sun was
setting we we really haven't seen much
yet
unfortunately this something like 6 p.m.
of similar to New York which which just
means we're gonna have to try and get up
a bit earlier to make the most of the
days over the next week or so like I
said Steven Alexia arriving tomorrow
morning and it's Alexis birthday in a
few days and we're gonna be celebrating
the Day of the Dead festival we were
hoping to go to like a city and do the
parade I think they had one in Mexico
City today but it would have been a
mission trying to go there first and
then and then like fly it to the coast
so we thought we'd just try and find
somewhere local and joining with
celebrations here and then I don't know
maybe go and visit some Mayan ruins go
to the cenotes I don't know if you
remember the trip I did here a couple of
years ago but I love this whole area and
yeah after we've spent a bit of time
here we're gonna go down to Tulum and
we're staying this like really nice
rustic hotel on the beach it's like an
eco
and yeah I'm just looking forward to
spending some quality time Steven Alexia
and maybe finding some more wildlife as
well the raccoons tonight I was not
expecting those guys they were crazy
it's so much fun I didn't in their head
they had raccoons at Mexico to be honest
but yeah anyway it's gonna be fun it's
gonna be a really good week and catch
you guys in the morning
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure but
