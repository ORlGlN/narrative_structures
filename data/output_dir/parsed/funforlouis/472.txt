good morning guys
it's our first day of the Contiki puri
trip it's 8 a.m. and we just come down
for two meetings to find out about what
we're doing in the same way as all the
other Kentucky trips are done they are
filming their own daily videos so
they've got the camera team and we are
filming a little intro shot for the
video right now before we head off what
did you hear about the avocados in Peru
so the first stop on our tour into a
little place right by the beach called
the park of love and it's amazing we're
surrounded by this little mosaic it's
mosaic wool in this beautiful garden
interesting statue over there
hey guys every day I'm gonna try to
bring you something that nobody else has
in their box today
don't you look at that Peter
this arrived at the the main square Lima

this reminds me a little bit of Cuba and
Spain like he wenthe together this
amazing brass band that's playing oh
hell miserable

work it work it yeah you're angry you're
taiga
yo taiga you heard dragon playing guys
check out this almost vehicle outside
the palace they do not mess around
I think we're getting total for filming
all right it's time to try some Peruvian
coffee and we started about this really
the oldest part for in Lima Wow
Justin just kindly Boston churros how is
that okay this is perfect to have after
a great coffee is off
make me tomorrow when you guys don't
have to oh yeah I'm so good on the lab
again recommendation you're gonna see
signs no pictures no filming no nothing
okay in general okay I promise
we're going down here
our bathing inspections events
I'll having to seriously doubt to get
through these doodles
Teddy's out
oh my gosh that is crazy
well there's like hundreds and hundreds
of skeletons down there how weird is
this alley it's it's really surreal it's
like we're talking about how you see it
drawn or like you see like fake
skeletons when you're studying anatomy
and stuff like that but you see it yeah
these are like real people
each of these bones that has a story
like has a whole life attached to it so
dark oh my gosh that is crazy
that's really really freaky scholars
just got hole in it apparently this was
like before they had all the cemeteries
and stuff this is where they buried a
lot of people Cerrillos saying real
skeleton
so I just found out that the skeletons
we just saw were from the 1600s to 1800s
that's when it was used as the cemetery
and apparently we only were in one
section of it
in the hole catacombs there's 25,000
people buried down there and then I
guess more recently they've separated
out the bones and made those kind of
patterns with the skulls and stuff and
yeah it's kind of crazy it's always
fascinating having a little window into
the past and seeing their tombs was very
sobering
it's not often you see step on that row
aware if we just arrives there's like a
water fountain light show later
that's what the research most what in
south-america
areas the most young unpopulated in the
world
you have a very stable girlfriend yeah
guys how long have I not done this
before at the tolerance you are a
perfect tripod yeah man
besides me laughing it's very table
this is the biggest absent uh no in Peru
I made up
Oh
okay
okay we go in a trap I'm trapped in the
phone in I'll get away I'm getting wet
okay
Chloe how did you feel when they were
trying to set you on fire they were
doing crazy stuff and then I was like oh
wait I totally forgot they're holding
scissors yeah I feel like like how can
we make this dance more risky and
dangerous
let's carry scissors well for doing it
so tomorrow we are flying super early in
the morning we have to be down here at
7:20 where are we going again somewhere
really high up in the mountains yeah
yeah anyway a very high altitude place a
parent's 3,800 meters above sea level
and we might experience some out to
sickness but I'll tell you more about
that all right it's been an amazing day

quite enjoyed dancing tonight and I'm
hoping we'll get a chance to actually go
out dancing quickly but we're gonna do a
little bit of editing and then get some
sleep
