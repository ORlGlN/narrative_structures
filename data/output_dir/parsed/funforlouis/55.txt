good morning guys we are in Broome and
North West Australia and we are heading
south today towards Alice Springs and
oilerie it's a long flight unfortunately
I felt pretty ill this morning so we've
just been gauging whether this is a good
idea or not but I'm feeling a bit fed up
I'm just hoping I don't like throw up
and the plane or something it's gonna be
quite bumpy ride because of they hate
and yeah yeah over deserts this will be
very hot
hopefully we'll see some cool views
especially this afternoon
hi everyone ready okay she's straight up
I'm loving the barefoot flying again so
much like Namibia so they don't have any
doors like there's no baby yeah yeah
they went straight through my flip-flop
it's so lovely cuz we're flying VFR I
just literally go direct to on the GPS
no fancy from freaking readings or
anything did that to that there right
there yeah I think you mentioned over 62
times at this Airport Wow and you have a
little stab at Matt I don't see a single
Bonanza and I would be very sure that
some of these operators that have been
doing this for 40 years would be
choosing the best airplane they would
not be flying an inferior airplane miss
Tralee the outback I November 2 ones are
at a uniform ready to taxi for VFR
flight to Alice Springs all right there
we go
other fairly heavy 41 degrees what do
you want the grade do you lie to pray
negative we'll be following the actual
shoreline I just I'm trying to stay as
close to it as possible but I'll be
tracking right now
the red stopped at the turquoise water
never see that copper before there's a
massive battery
we'll see more I have to cut this way
for now
yeah said when we get down there I can
do whatever I want to be a part traffic
and the broom area no Peppa to10 keen
informed me along with shoreline
tracking sound currently 12 miles south
of throat along the shoreline below

life in this water the colors the colors

November 2 1 0 a cuneiform 20 miles
south of Broome climbing 9,000 feet
heading direct Alice Springs
must be weird got on road trips out here
like we need a fuck off work just to get
over true oh so like a bet there's not
many gasps eight there must be big areas
with like Vegas oh yeah you definitely
need to be prepared out here
you think backpackers could die out here
is loose they say a lot of them do do
why do you think there's a Betty back
out here this is what I used to do in
Namibia is just look for people that
have got lost on a desert run out a few
had accidents you must get into the 50s
here and there or do you want to right
now at 11 o'clock in the morning yeah
because they are kangaroos down here I'm
pretty sure but there's no way of seeing
them yeah we're flipping hi
what do you think it's in number one
most used emoji qualifies
I need our combined well we better
figure out something
sorry miss you face in my face
centerpiece sign you're such a flirt I'm
a heartbreak fine
oh I love emojis that's why I wanted to
get it I think they added so much
emotion to text that a lot of like
interpretation was left up to the reader
honestly I think floating without an
iPhone is like very difficult oh yeah
hell yeah are you sued I used to do it
though I don't know how I got by but
yeah
are you used to like make these
approaches right like this super long
wait the other side ever faces down as
well right yeah but when I before his
iPhone I didn't have a bow geez I
remember I do you did never type a yeah
we met and then that's why it took us so
long to get together because I couldn't
flirt with you you're like hey
and he is rock traffic November two ones
they were attainable that's not to ten
we are currently six zero miles to the
northwest maintaining 9500 inbound way
is Rock number two was very beautiful
Wow
is rock traffic November 2 of their
genome test at 2:10 orbiting northwest
of the lure and at 4,000 feet
all righty oh that's pretty cool way to
see it yeah
which way that late spring no way that
way and it was rock traffic number two
was there I felt bad just northwest of
it we were four thousand climbing 9500
heading correct island spring
music what genuinely makes my life
better my gosh like I don't listen to it
enough yeah because I'm talking to
people and stuff but if you listen to it
while experiencing something I do feel
like it enriches the moment yeah I have
to show you the song I listen to when I
was watching the norther in life I made
it like 10 times better yeah I I always
want to listen to me do it on like
snowboarding oh yeah like Java face this
causes injuries but there are moments to
music doesn't have a place like I
offered me a mazhab there would probably
be moments where you just want to listen
to the birds yeah the beach sometimes
this is just laughs hey is that it's
definitely nature sounds which it's
always like yeah they're like music in
itself right okay this is a very very
very emotional arrival for me because I
literally sent seven seven or six then
thousands of hours flying flight
simulator out of the people like
thousands I know it out of my head it is
actually ridiculous is better than I
imagined much better
oh my god I just want I loves as well
yeah this is amazing I'm having a really
good day
yeah good this is exactly how I imagined
it I can't explain it
you did they have all this terrain
correct on the well like I started when
it was just pixels all right
I am in heaven right now I can't even
explain it
cuz I can't see daddy kangaroos oh no
really no I love to do see any kangaroo
how bigger the pack that they travel in
calories yeah I think like dozens Wow a
lot of the trees here plant if you look
down it'll just see about you ashes
where's that from
that's a bit a big fire at some point
you see all these tracks down here that
animals pretty sure kangaroos will
follow those as well
this is amazing right so I can go 300
feet lower than us
this is some of the coolest life I got
yeah
yeah for sure on this trip yeah
Oh springs traffic Peppa - I'm very good

Oh clear of the actor property guys
we've landed in Alice Springs we are
being attacked by mosquitoes right now I
have no idea
I knew this flies in Australia but
there's so many mosquitoes so we're
trying to figure out how we're gonna
figure out how to get out the airport
and did they just drive off we don't
know how to get out and then we need to
get to our hotel wow I'm getting
shredded
alright we've arrived guys I've been
working all evening and I haven't
managed to get my tab it done and
uploaded for tonight just 3 a.m. I have
to sleep I've been feeling awful all day

very cool I think one of the most scenic
beautiful flights we've done and very
very different terrain and it's good to
see JP so excited to be here yeah it's
