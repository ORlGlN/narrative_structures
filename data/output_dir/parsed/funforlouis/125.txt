morning guys I've just driven up to
London to meet up with my friend Andy
and we're about to head over to Oxford
again to do some jet boarding the notice
on my blog for Mike we can offer go but
we we are training in the in the sport
of jet boarding which is like a
motorised dashboard and we are
attempting hopefully next month to cross
the channel and I'm doing that before we
got our round-the-world flight but yeah
it's going to be it's going to be a
Sunday I think it's going to be very
exhausting so I would just stopped off
in a way to get a cheap little coffee
and some avocado on toast that breakfast
ok we've arrived we drove for about an
hour and a half I don't actually know
where we are it was we drove in the
direction of north so we're yeah like an
hour about London and this is the lake
we're going to be training on today I
guess is the guy that took us out few
weeks ago rebel surf and yeah we need to
get good a good amount of training hours
in so we're we're ready for this to see
the ocean crossing is going to be quite
different from gliding around on a on a
class flat lake basically what we're
going to try and do is we're going to
get up to speed on using the boards in
these conditions then after that I've
booked a jet ski to accompany us and I'm
going to take you out on over order oh
you know ok and then we will actually do
a dry run 24 miles I'm going for a
double wetsuit keep warm
this is the helmet I should be wearing
and this is the helmet has to work as a
cop again and what do you think guys
least I'm not going to hurt myself
let's hit myself in the face I think for
the channel crossing I need to get a
full mask I'm not gonna smoke though are
they all they were working okay nice and
easy ran out first we're going to try
and avoid crushing these kids and you
don't don't crash into the kids thanks
and these had a very good first run so
he's coming back in now I'm going to
head out there was a bit cold and a bit
of wind but the double wet Seon I'm
excited about yes right the good first
run guys this is tiring
this is tiring work but I feeling
confident it took a lot longer on our
first day getting up but we both got up
and now it's just trying to get our
posture correct they were not firing our
legs or kind of bending over in the
wrong way
you get the nice tight pans in there I
need to give that logo all right Janice
has a turn without hunting over there
like leaning into the turn like with a
straight body I'm getting a bit better I
am having some pretty major wipe out
there don't have a nickel in your video
but I did one where I literally like
spaced on it and then double back on the
whole back then yet dry after lunch me
and Andy are going to go out together so
we're going to ride together okay
refueled and ready to go that's a really
nice veggie burger
lovely had a GTO as well get some sugar
inside of me this is yeah this is quite
an quite exhausting doing the jet
boarding but I feel way more alive got a
more energy than I did the first time
around right it's time to head out
together
okay
what also run tickle time you guys are
getting tired
run out fuel by get towed back
right that's us done for the day it's
almost 7:00 p.m. we've done almost three
hours in the water
each obviously have been have a little
break sand and lunch and stuff but yeah
I'm feeling very confident we just need
to go in practice we need to find a day
that works for us all to go and practice
and the waves now because when we cross
the channel is going to be no in there
is flat as this and I need to get a good
helmet I need to get online and find a
good support helmet ah see wet success
glorious I'm already aching we're in
trouble
okay in trouble
hey we're back in London Riya has called
uber up to join us she's been working
all day and going to grab some curry
well it's been a really fun day I'm a
little bit achy and I actually managed
to order a massage other the service
where you can order miss chooses to come
to your house so we just chilled and
these for a little bit managed to get an
hour big tissue that those which is much
needed and yeah I'm really pumped for
this channel crossing it's like a last
minute kind of planner but the one thing
we do need to find is we need to do a
bit more training but on the see if
anyone knows anywhere on the south coast
with areas where you can do kind of
motorized water sports and that's you
know maybe a little baby something can
you let me know the comments because we
need to come down and do a few hours on
the sea before we try to cross the
France and but yeah it's been it's been
fun doing something different I don't
usually do water sports I haven't done a
lot dot and yeah it's pretty epic pretty
epic right I will catch like tomorrow
I've got some big announcements coming
to my site watch this space peace now
enjoy life and live the adventure but
