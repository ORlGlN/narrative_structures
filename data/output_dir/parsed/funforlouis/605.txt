hey my name is I and I'm from Birmingham
Alabama I'm currently watching beautiful
sunset behind me you are watching fan
for Louie boom good morning guys it's
6:30 a.m. and we're about to head off
from the hotel I'm pretty out of here I
thought I only got three hours sleep but
I am I need to summon some energy from
somewhere because today is a big shoot
day for the guys I've got some
additional security today guys check
through the script
earning my lines so we've arrived at the
village we were out on the first day
again guys late there's two little cute
goats that I'm like obsessed with
something I haven't told you guys yet
the reason why we're joined by the
police today is that there's a celebrity
coming to join the Sheep
unfortunately I can't reveal who that
person is and they want to wait till the
the little documentaries come out to
reveal that so I'm gonna be filming kind
of behind the scenes like I have been
but unfortunately can't share with you
who that is yet but it just builds the
anticipation for when those videos come
out for you guys so we just have to wait
it's always really refreshing when I
visit places like this guys because
people here are so content with very
little material wealth they have all the
essentials shelter food water and then
they just have amazing community there's
just it's just so different from
developed countries in the way we're
going in the West and and it's just yeah
it's there's something we we've lost I
think from the more basic living is
definitely something we've lost I think
it is community really I think it's that
tighter community and kind of family
vibe I think we need to find ways to
rediscover that in our lives
Louie is down by the school at the
moment getting ready to do some
interviews with a certain celebrity and
we're not allowed to talk about yet and
because someone else has got the
exclusive on it it's gonna be a Man
Thing
I hope you enjoyed those how you doing
yeah francais bonjour je m'appelle Andy
Patrick good to meet you Patrick down to
the school where he's going to be into
me for Louie
so the thing would finish the bulk of
the shooting this morning about to have
lunch I can't wait for you guys to see
what we filmed today it's already called
show anymore it's a bit of a tease but
it's gonna be good it's good we good
guys I'm getting into this I'll get into
the flow this interviewing thing let me
know if you think I should start being
lil bit more of a journalist so I'm not
just I'm not just going places no
purpose but and I talked about this
before but finding amazing things
happening him you know it's going
interview people in those situations and
hang out with them I think that's where
this channels heading I'm more excited
about lunch today if we didn't just have
the normal forget subpoena
we got cursed cursed open spilling
everywhere piscis vegetables potatoes
tomatoes
well sis Louie understand I'm gonna film
a little 360 video whilst we're out
there so there's a few clips I'm going
to get today which I'll release
whenever February however so you guys
can see a little bit more about what
we've been doing I really messed up
earlier we planned a whole shoot with
this particular celebrity and ended up
getting chained to someone and I was
walking along and then I wasn't supposed
to be in the scene so I'm gonna just
hide in the bushes now
film star is named to see him being in a
feature feature film Monday reckon
wonder when he rises to that level
whether he still let me come and his
cameraman
simple simple and easy thing to do
just because there's all these other
things like oh I could get an electric
car and then somehow make sure I don't
know like how do you look at the energy
consumption and how ethical that is and
fossil fuels and I think that I think in
terms of just being up there like
control it's easy I mean it is a
struggle in one way by then I kind of
like the challenge of it yeah well we've
just been doing the last couple of shots
of the day it's so hot out here having
to wipe with a sweat off my forehead so
I'm not like glistening on camera I mean
a shot as well as not a thing guys on
the link Magnus's social media links
below you can go and see all the drone
stuff he does some of his show reels
one of the policemen dropped their hats
off the back of the van so you these are
the first day we're back from a shoot in
the daylight before we head in I sort of
meet these guys they've been legends
they've been helping us out all day boys
you're messy these guys don't speak
English oh bloody oh sorry for swearing
hey policeman points garner Louie
Louie's groin
Thanks
don't rush
thank you very much
thank you very much thank you sir we've
just left the hotel and we've come down
to this local restaurant again I'm ready
for some food dinner is served
I just have to get rice fries and
plantain which has pretty much been my
consistent diet for the last few days
this is cassava which is a traditional
Hyborian dish the root vegetable
well it's been a very random vlog today
guys I did my best to kind of vlog in
between what I was up to but the main
focus was me filming this big video
which like I've said you'll get to see
very soon with my did try and film 360
today but I've just been trying to
review the footage and that's somehow
corrupted a few of the files and it's
made me very sad I don't think it's
gonna be usable I did an awesome
interview and yeah I don't think it's
gonna I don't think it's gonna work
anyway I tomorrow's our last day of
filming and I am I'm looking forward to
this it's gonna be good if we're gonna
go out and see some more of the farmers
and some of the cocoa plantations I'm
gonna get to actually pick some off the
trees and you have to see some more of
the prices of it all cool right
I'll see in the morning peace out enjoy
life live the adventure
