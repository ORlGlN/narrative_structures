hi my name is Jorge Figueroa and I'm
from Calgary Alberta and this is Oscar
and Charlie and you're watching fun for
Louie
good morning guys
I am very rested and had an awesome time
so far with my friends Rob and Bianca
and the family and I've just woken up to
this incredible day
so me and Rob we're about to pick up his
son Josh from kindergarten now I'm gonna
help make some sandwiches for lunch
making rajma jam sandwich take afar that
which drops them down the right we have
come down to us but we're swimmer than
the other day the kids down there
swimmin
boy sit down there within this head out
again so I think that means it's time
for a swim guys the water was too
shallow we were diving in and the shells
there's a no diving sign for a reason
yeah
I got worried this time this weekend has
been exactly what needed just relaxation
great conversations great friends and in
a nice wine down the end of this chaotic
trip New Zealand
I'm taking a little stroll well they
couldn't repair the reel but I got
another little rail with only $25 so
hopefully that will be a good
replacement and we've got some little
hooks here to get some bait fish tonight
something I find quite incredible is
robbing the family live a simple life
where actually fishes for their food
it's like a hunter-gatherer thing goes
down gets the bait out the water fishes
brings the fish home for dinner it's
kind of amazing I'm never in a place to
have that
slower approach to life boys than the
run boys and Eve eating out all the time
it's just been to the refreshing living
with these guys for the weekend and yeah
seeing how they do like my food I'm
gonna do an aeroplane
he's doing the washing-up
you helping hang out the washing Josh
yeah I hope you we're sick goodnight to
the boys and now me Rob from Jake now
heading down to do some fishing off a
wharf in Munger nippy I never will catch
anything we're going to try go our new
fishing stuff I'm going to take the
camper van down clean hips I've been
hurt
good catch
another one of these guys that got
another snapper
these guys
so many of them by I think fishing is a
very exact artful there's just little
things you can vary to make it work and
you don't know them then something's
just doesn't work a little white on
there it's gonna let me get it a bit
further when I'm casting guys let I
think it's still too little to keep the
dinner it is
a court robbed line to our lines
intertwined and some summer or advise
fishing advice bigoted lines tangled we
finally got so this is the bait fish
that we're going to try and catch the
king is good
Jake's caught something whoa yeah oh my
gosh yeah this is the same they could
even be the same guy I got the other day
I can't bring one okay what I'll do is
I'll have fun about
whoa
okay now if you ship that brought over
that besides of that guy
here there you go you just gonna tie it
right in there either bigger to see if
it's sticky suckers really sucking you
can't get em a here's the hook here huh
yeah don't let it out yeah it's so slimy
okay oh it's so strong
slimy yeah that's kinda you
see there bro oh I bet you happened to
be back in there well I got snapper I
don't want to keep that guy when
handling these fish you need to be
careful because they've got spiny backs
and little teeth as well you can munch
you with turn the go swimmin burr up bro
you get broke Wow what are they well
come on baby you put on this way I'm
using the squid from now on
I'm having no luck for this position my
life
chips to measure it it might be just up
it might be just say boy do you think
I've put my line on the ladder down
there so I'm going to do it oh no oh God
well we've been joined by some locals I
think working on the fishing boat there
and they're showing us how to do it just
with a handrail they haven't even got
rods they're just like flinging it and
swing it end and then catching more than
me how did you guys find that yeah
thanks for teaching us though fishing
skills Rob here's our catch from the
night that's my guy fish to go to the
fridge boy I am I'm actually leaving
tomorrow guys it's been a nice weekend I
had a a day or two of vlogging as well
because I'd little bit behind but it's
been amazing
I guess being inspired a little bit
hanging out Rob would be anchor family
and like I've seen earlier experiencing
such a different way of living and yeah
it's been it's been really cool and it's
a shame I have to head off but it is
playlist live in Florida at the end of
the week so that's what I'm flying
tomorrow night I'm driving my camper van
back down to Auckland and then I'm
jumping a plane and flying to America
say no sadly I'm gonna be leaving New
Zealand
it's been such an incredible trip if you
haven't guys ever been to New Zealand
I'd advise maybe putting it quite high
off your bucket list of places to come
to yeah I'm actually thinking to coming
back here later in the year I think that
should be a good plan all right I'm
gonna get some sleep
Rob suggesting we may be able to go
kayaking in the morning before I need to
leave I probably need to leave here
about 11:00 so let's see if that happens
or not originally it was going to be
like a 6:00 a.m. kayak and going fishing
as well but definitely nothing alright
see you in the morning for a little road
trip down to Auckland peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure
