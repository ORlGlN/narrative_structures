I've been driving all morning and we're
just about to go into Croatia and it's
raining
hopefully the weather gets a lil bit
better hello darling
returning to London yeah alright
neutrality - today we're going to
Croatia
okay one more possible please yeah
thank you
we're through yes so we've stopped off
in Zagreb which I think it's the capital
of Croatia and we're just wandering
around in the rain
looking to the nice little cafe to have
a property in a late breakfast and
figure out where we're actually going to
go what do you think you're going
I think she'd probably go this with
accessory yeah this is what I'm thinking
this one
we're winning Wi-Fi toaster cheese
sandwich crush on latte
get down low by winning that's nice
little coffee
I was just directing Nicolas video a
turn right here we just turned the first
three lane one way right coming towards
us so that wasn't very safe we're now
going through the Slovenian border
hopefully me kiss ray otherwise we're
screwed I don't know how we're getting
at home that's probably one of the
easiest border crossings with hat
straight free no complications
Lavinia here we come we were hoping to
stop in Slovenia and have a look around
but it's just raining and I'm tired so
we've made a decision just to keep going
through to Italy and it means we could
spend the whole evening in Venice and I
do this the best out there Venice
hopefully it's not right in there
another night right we've arrived in
Venice but it's chucking it with rain so
got our rain jackets on and we're going
to venture out into the rain and and see
how we do it still be fun let's do we go
I do not enjoy rain this is like a top
of a thunderstorm cold and drizzling
chuckles we're still going having a
wander around but we just stopped on the
little cat face again and chill out
me and Nick are soaking wet absolutely
soaking wet Venice is beautiful but it'd
be nicer if it wasn't raining we're
gonna walk back to the van now walk back
to Rodney and try not to get too wet
I said to my jizz against the clock life
is over the bridge alight here
things over that little bridge
so we're going over the whole bridge of
Venice so hopefully we'll to catch a bus
back and those are going to be walking
for about three cases are in
so it's chocking it with rain and we
thought why let's jump on the bus to try
to get back to the carpark because it's
like 10 15 minute walk and there goes
like yeah yeah go to the carpark but
ended up drove like three miles away
over this long bridge and now we're
stranded so far from the carpark it's
not even funny
I really don't know what we're gonna do
okay we managed to jump back on a bus
hopefully taking this slowly nearer
Rodney
that wasn't funny committed then I was
like dang a little bit annoying
the gas completely drained remain who
trims do types of water like the
kilometers to the GoBot like as soon as
I know that the strap is not one clicker
and drinking as much boxes lovely Rodney
CLA a Venice
on to my lab
Interlaken in Switzerland so I got so
soaking when we were coming back from
Venice to the car park that I my
trousers were just so wet so I just got
out the car filled up with petrol in my
boxer shorts and I'm getting some really
strange looks oh it's wet well it's 5:00
in the morning
I'm in Milan Nick slept the whole
journey here getting his energy up for
he's dry he's doing the next leg into
Switzerland I've been driving around for
a while trying to fight so where's the
park with like Wi-Fi and a cafe it's
that find anywhere I just
brought down some backstreet if you mean
I get moved on I'm going to sleep and I
think tomorrow will be a beautiful day
