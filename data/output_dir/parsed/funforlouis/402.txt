good afternoon guys
we've had a relaxed morning getting some
editing done our Airbnb we've come down
into the center of Guildford because
I've got a few things to buy for a trip
I'm going on this week which I haven't
told you about yet
so Cory's pokemons players out I need to
get my Pokemon game on for this we were
out pretty late last night to the gyms I
took over I've been I've been beaten
I've been knocked out so it was time for
a late lunch in Wagga members move it
we've got Adam our May we've got some
glazes so happy right now
check this out wait is this this is 14
mystic then this outfit Oh instinct
he's instinct okay well I like your I
like a face mask
I've had a little coffee and we're gonna
try and attack a gym but some other
people did and they've got like much
higher CP IQ - so you gonna have to
little driver one of the good things
about having a base this week is it
means we can cook for ourselves or
writing a better cooking she enjoys that
so we're just gonna go do some grocery
shopping and matza spencer's we might
need one of those all right
guys look how cute it is down by the
river and Guilford we still haven't
given you a house tour I thought this
would be a nice time to make myself a
little coffee before dinner so we found
this place on Airbnb it's only like a
15-minute walk down to the station and
that goes into central London it's kind
of out in the countryside boots it's
quite near Guildford town centre check
this out isn't this the cutest place
ever
we were like this amazing little cottage
give us a little tour show us all the
things we found
wildflowers grape vines all on the front
of the house and here
look at the real grapes I don't think
they're ready yet yeah they'll be ready
in autumn which is for like all the
fruit trees Roy loves fruit trees as
well area and our garden had so many of
these I feel like we found the refine
plum plum trees a plum tree over there
oh this I think guys correct me if I'm
wrong but I think these are red currants
red currant my yo-yo
I think these are red currants I think
these are black currants and I think
these are gooseberries where are they so
basically all of the fruit and a fig
tree an actual fig tree these awesome
figs so yeah pretty much dream house I
don't know who owns this place but it's
kept very nicely and it's been amazing
this is a little summer house yeah
that's true oh if it's raining that
would be so cool like a nice summer rain
day and we can't quite see the view but
we're at the top of a hill so you can
kind of look down into Guildford and
then inside thank you got the little
fireplace we've got our own little
kitchen which I don't know much about
how to do kitchen things but we can cook
food like later on we're gonna do
okay wild flowers from the garden how
magical is that is this better than the
bouquet flowers I got you in Amsterdam
so I don't know how old this house is
well with dark plate maybe you can put
but this is I don't know how old this
house is but it has very small doors
which suggests to me look how much
mystery there suggests to me is actually
quite old house because older houses in
the UK were like oh I think it's older
than even Victorian age good a dining
room don't use coz i two of us know we
can just eat in the kitchen this is
where the people that own the house live
so we don't go over there well they're
not there now but that's everything
this is the office that we also don't
use but we could do I feel like like
eight of us could another bathroom I
know that there's a bathroom this
bathroom yeah yeah so I now have a bit
of an announcement to make
it's actually quite a big announcement
this is probably the most daring travel
adventure I've ever been a part of in
three days time I'm gonna be heading to
North Korea earlier this year in April I
went to South Korea and I went to the
border the DMZ the Demilitarized Zone
and we looked over into North Korea but
not many people actually ever go there
and there
a limitation on how many people can
visit the year a lot of people didn't
even realize that it is a place you can
visit I'm going with an organization and
I'll tell you more about the actual trip
but today we went down into Guildford to
get some things and one of those things
well one of those things is a new laptop
some hard drives and a new phone now
this might be a bit overkill but what
I've been told is if I bring my existing
phone or laptop in and there's anything
on there that could be deemed aunty
North Korea or anything they don't like
I could be in trouble
potentially even get arrested there's a
few things in the media at the moment
about people getting arrested in North
Korea so I don't know risk that and the
advice I've been given is get a new
laptop bring you know if there's nothing
no data's just fresh I'll just put some
editing software on there what I'm
hoping is I can vlog while some there
and you have some videos to show you
guys when I get back
unfortunately there's no internet in
North Korea it's restricted from
internet access so I'm going to space
out the vlogs you may have noticed the
last few blocks even this vlog is way
behind so by the time this uploads I'll
probably be in North Korea already and
yeah and then when I get back I'll be
uploading twice a day to catch back up
with myself and there'll be some pretty
amazing content of pretty amazing vlogs
coming your way unless I get my laptop
and camera confiscated so the reason I
bought new ones is that these are though
it's a bit of an investment these could
get confiscated I may not be able to get
these back they might even become scared
as I arrived into the country so there's
there's mixed opinions of whether you
can bring laptops in to come North Korea
so on the try and this way if it gets
confiscated is I lost some money but I
haven't lost my other data and things I
need an ability to edit wouldn't get
back to China so yeah here we go
the this is my little investment
to make it worth it for this trip and I
cannot wait to bring you guys on this
adventure it's going to be absolutely
crazy it's a little bit chillier this
evening so I've got me a good look
burner and again I'm a little bit
obsessed with this it's got a four logs
outside also check yourself
see it's just chillin and wide open this
starts raging right right it's just
heated up some food from yesterday and
prepared a little avocado salad
Thanks how strange does this feel that
we've got like our house traveling yeah
can't wait like make breakfast tomorrow
oh my gosh
well I've stayed up all night it's now
7:00 a.m. I have edited my Amsterdam
video that I was working on can't wait
to show you guys is another similar to
the Montana video that Sam edited it is
gonna be titled this is Amsterdam and
yeah it's a lot of fun but I probably
will need in the future so what to help
me edit these kind of videos because
trying to do them alongside the vlogs is
a lot of work and it means less sleep
and today is supposed to be a day off
with Raya where we can just hang out and
make the most of this this little
retreat and I'm probably gonna end up
sleeping or morning now anyway it's been
nice it's being cool and it's actually
been a bit strange kind of having our
own space in our own house and something
I'm definitely not used to this is quite
different from staying in a hotel or
some of the other places we've stayed in
I'm having like a whole house just for
us but it has been lovely and yeah I'll
catch you guys tomorrow
peace out enjoy life unless the
adventure
