oldest trees on like earth or in this

history in Ayurveda Indian medicine I'm
going to give you traditional use
scientific explanation
do you see the movie yeah well our
nature walk is coming to an end this
guy's been talking solidly for like two
hours
crazy amount of information I showed a
few little snippets but yeah we haven't
seen loads of wildlife it's more just
been learning a lot of facts about the
plants and the ecosystem and how it all
works here so we've finished our
breakfast and we've just come to another
place now it's like a cool little beach
area in the jungle and we're being
treated to a little spa day a massage
and stuff before our flights this
evening which is really nice

tumeric in it that's a good time how was
your massage yeah it's good yeah yeah it
was relaxing I kept on getting
distracted by the monkeys though there's
monkeys running around outside I just
wanted to go and run around with them I
