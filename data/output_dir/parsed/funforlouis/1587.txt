some very exciting shoes hello oh hello
row just on a first fill up with petrol
and our new van and there's a petrol
leak that eventually what is always
happen to us what the hell
I don't know what today
I don't know how you can repair fuel
tanks we've got to start the engine but
cuz of petrol dripping out the whole
finger burst into flames we should turn
off everything that makes electricity
I'm so scared God is everywhere
alright let's our faces that we died oh
it's so scary
we've managed to drive to a mechanics to
come and tell us what's wrong in it but
luckily it's actually stopped dripping
now I know this unknown started again so
we started again so we found the
mechanics to be help us look at the the
fuel tank situation you think this is
funny probably wait you love that this
is a very serious situation we've
stopped with some baby time it's open
now I should probably put some clothes
on
oh yeah we're ignoring the fuel leak for
now with we've got more important things
to do like drink bubble tea moment of
truth
is there a puddle of petrol underneath
ok covertly see but I think it's alright
I think that the fuel levels dropped
enough for us not to be leaking fuel
everywhere so we're just gonna roll like
