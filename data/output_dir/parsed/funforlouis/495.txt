traveling today I think you're looking
forward to today loving it you got to

far the best chair massage if not in the
top five massages I've ever had

well last time I came to China
I could use either but we could not get
over working I was just trying to like
maybe even an hour fiddling around the
internet trying to create a new account
anyway we eventually got in a taxi
somehow figured out where we're going
and yeah it's the start of a new
adventure
those lovely yeah even the simplest
things we can't communicate over you can
even see they can't even read the name
of the hostel in English it's bananas
this is different world I think this is
the craziest culture difference with
mysterious oh yeah I'm shocked I've been
here only Beijing's I'm excited to see
it so the taxi driver has taken us to
the wrong road he's taking us to a
Shanxi but we need a Shanxi very similar
one a in two a's everyone's trying to
help could be a while longer quite an
expensive taxi ride already at two
hundred and something which is like
twenty quid
alright I think we've arrived at our
hostel I was a bit of a fiasco mainly
because I didn't have any cash check
this out though this lift only goes to
even floors well right press the bank
and I only go to ah drawers yeah
here we go
Blue Mountain oh this looks pretty funky
yeah guys check this out Facebook Google
YouTube Twitter Instagram none of this
works on their normal internet it's just
what I'm trying to get my VPN working
this will make it work just need to get
this working we've dropped our bags off
and we're now going for a little explore
wine food primarily food and then
potentially after that massage but
primarily food
what does it require yeah lots of people
around but there's no cars at all it's
pretty children
this is about right
I found some street food turns out
there's a lot of meat in China so I'm
struggling to find a vegan option but I
think I found one
getting some street noodles fried up
with some tofu and and different bits of
vegetables mushrooms and stuff
yeah it's program this is not the
easiest meal of every and I met fighters
tasty slippery of them yes ma'am
slippery isn't oily goose well this is
our little room for the next four days
it's pretty cute little bit so since the
sole be trip began over the last week or
so a lot of you have been asking where's

not with me and Dave she's actually been
traveling a bit herself and now she's
back in New York for a little bit and we
