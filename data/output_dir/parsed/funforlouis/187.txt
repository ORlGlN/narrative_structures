they've been taking this around the
world they just showed me they had they
have like a system to purify the
seawater to make a drinking water I
never even thought about our long boat
trips like how are you going to get your
water daughter's but it's amazing we're
just about to head off one of the girls
kindly made me some ammo on toast
we're just waiting in the harbor now for
this bridge to open so we can actually
leave because we're not going to get
under there with our little big mask I
haven't spent a lot of time outside just
relaxing so it's going to be a really
nice morning yeah buddy
I will just stop in for a bit of fuel
before we head out this is going to be
tired what vehicle these real are they
this can't be real
I know these are like those big crock to
have enquiries right you know there's
massive like coming out so uh those are
crazy so I just heard they're putting a
few hundred litres of diesel in the base
and this is going to last and all the
way to Brazil because most of the time
the boat is wind powered obviously with
a sail that goes up and then when
there's no wind or they're driving and
in the marina because you obsess the
light chug along the diesel engine
should I imagine it all the way to
Brazil maybe I should do this one day
Elizabeth and she's gonna give it a
little tour of the boat where we head
off around
I've been here for a month and a half
yeah it's like sandpaper no good senses

of cozy they like and nothing on that
door
we all have to like just pop two loads
solution there we go this is black
bathroom and then this is where Raiders
love nest so there was just like one
great big mattress like a little sex
then then I moved and he was like oh God

harmoniously there hasn't been love it's
