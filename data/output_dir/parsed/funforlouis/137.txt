good morning guys there are a lot of
exciting things happening today in a
little while I'm going to be taking you
over to see the finished Liddy adventure
but then some dramatic changes even the
last week that have happened and I
cannot wait to show you and later on
tonight we are driving the bus to the
secret garden party festival and we are
yes we're having a weekend of fun with a
hot tub and hanging out with an RS and
partying and but before we do any of
that I am at the air B&B staying at with
Raya and she has a very exciting
announcement to make
so I'm taking an awesome video my
jewelry line will have launched which I
can't I can't believe it
and we're playing it I've been wearing
kind of for like six months and yes my
jewelry line check it out guys this is
incredible
I've been waiting to show you guys for
these amazing things rising working on a
little bit about it so my mom is
actually making all of it some of you
may know my mom's been making jewelry
and selling em and C for like five years
so she's super talented she knows what
she's doing and I collaborated with her
and designed all these designs and
they're all inspired by traveling so
these are actually like this is the
Caribbean collection is inspired by our
trip to the Dominican Republic
these are inspired by Pena so it's like
the color but reminds a Pena there's a
little elephant a skier oh yeah and then
these are just kind of inspired by my
general travels but also there's going
to be a percentage of every sale going
towards building a school so I'm working
with pencils of promise and we're going
to
school together hopefully by the end of
the year so yes a lot of exciting things
yeah so I will of course link all of
this below don't check out all the
ranges that rise releasing and go show
some support and I think you should
probably head over there quick because I
don't know how much stock she's got and
how long these negatives are going to
laugh before we head off I am going to
help her shoot some product shots and
she's gonna be wearing too many
different things so on me get my camera

we've run upstairs they've got a bit of
a sound system
