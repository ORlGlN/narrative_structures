hi I'm Emily on exchange in Japan and
you're watching fun for Louie
good morning guys I'm back in Cape Town
I've just woken up I've come down to the
eye and Laser Center I'm going to get a
little assessment of my eyes and
hopefully this afternoon I'm going to
get corrective laser eye surgery I'm a
little bit apprehensive but I've been
reassured that it's a very safe
procedure so it's going to the same just
brought me to a room watching a video
about laser eye surgery now it works so
there's some people here talk about
their treatment yeah
hey just did you see yeah just
okay okay so I'm going to get you now
just gently cover your left eye for me
just with your hand and tell me if
you're able to make that out yeah okay
anything I'm just going to come close
and I'm just having a DVD you know what
the different colors the different
colors a show where it's somewhere if
you do have the laser though there are a
couple of things we have to warn you
about the first one is if your eyes will
be a bit dry and scratch you for a few
days yeah so we give everybody teardrops
routinely okay okay so I've desert what
I'm actually really excited that today I
feel a lot more ease after watching the
video and check to the doctor a little
bit and getting some examinations and
it's all going ahead coming back this
afternoon and this should pretty much
correct my vision permanently which I'm
so excited about I'm out with the other
guys
we're heading for some breakfast
cool hungry
it's nice to be back in the penny board
breakfast coffee laptop glove
the urn edited some vlogs now heading to
get away laser stuff done and racial
with me that's gonna be right because
she's had it done where did you have
your thumb and it's good yeah yeah so
good 20 minutes and you can see imagine
with privilege and blessing of sight
let's just see must look at the trees
now they notice the difference by
oh great for this baby
don't sit at night
so if anyone's squeamish you might want
to look away for the next little while
basically he's clamped my eyelids open
with a metal clamp and now he's pushed
another device quite hard against my
eyeball now see this little metal blade
he's about to shave off my cornea
all right
I can't feel anything at this point but
that is my cornea he's just peeled back
the flap that's the front of my eyeball
so I can't see anything at this point
but they absolutely cannot move my eye
there you go
there's the later I'm moving over to the
other right this one was a little bit
more scary
I was flinching quite a lot
he's already flaps back the cornea so if
you look carefully you can see the laser
melting away the surface my eyeball
alright I'm out guys everything's really
misty it's like cloudy why is it weird
I wasn't first it-it's fine second I was
kind of this kind of uncomfortable this
is weird
I kind of excited that when I can
actually say it's kind of really flaring
up now
I'm gonna have to take it easier already
next like 24 hours next three days
really I need to keep it chilled
no TV no German assuming good question
I've just looked up at a tree and I can
see all the detail and the leaves
oh it's ridiculous
I feel like I can see better than I can
see with my glasses off

Mountain basically ten my vision from
like 360 to like a 1080
oh do you I can see well time to explore
right now but that was it bro all right

lunch some curry and then I think I'm
gonna sleep for a couple of hours
