good afternoon guys we've had a very
relaxed morning so far Bianca is taking
the kids out for a playdate and briar is
offered to cooking potato and leek soup
before we head off and I'm helping top
of the potatoes and we're having a good
old chat with Rob what we chat about Rob
well I'm just watching you guys doing a
little way yeah now we're just cooling
and about the concept of maybe teaching
the kids what to do actually guys if any
of you if any of you at home homeschool
your kids or have been homeschooled let
us know in the comments and Rob can read
through and get some advice on has to do
that and how to like basically harness
the passion the passions kids have and
kind of help educate through that rather
than the systematic kind of institution
of schooling which I grew up in but you
grew up in it isn't it yeah yeah I think
there's other ways to do it I would love
to be able to make it exciting to them
so we want to learn and also I felt the
other day that the New Zealand was a
classroom mmm no I felt when I came up
out of the water went for a swim after
being camping but it's like this is the
classroom and what an amazing classroom
because museum is one of those beautiful
countries with all all the different
opportunities from mountains to oceans
and land so this would like to learn to
somehow be able to share
so there you go guys help us out if
you've got any suggestions and yeah this
is something I'm not thinking about yet
but oh my god you've got three and one
on the way four hits and West and so
yeah crazy the whole new area of life I
haven't had to worry about
you are the best I'm gonna Lonnie great
enough these guys have been amazing
thanks for having us last few days and
we there's one last request we had guys
it's a bit of a random one but these
guys are looking for like a nanny a pair
and they'll be able to like house them
and feed them and stuff in New Zealand
if you're interested I'll leave an email
in the description but it'd be amazing
they've got a new little baby on the way
that Alana and there's Josh and Jonah so
there's lots of babies there's little
kids all under six but yeah so we have a
long shot but if you are interested and
want to come and hang out in the north
of New Zealand for as long as as long as
you want just let us know five years
yeah all right see you later guys
we just need to get the car back down to
JP tonight it's kindly offered to let us
stay with him and then we've got a
camper van rentals tomorrow morning so
we can explore it's the lovely having
next few days resting up here
a couple of days off as well that MP
noticed yeah good people chill time just
recuperating a bit before the next few
months there I've got a lot of things
planned we're just chatting about that
earlier actually about finding balance
and not kind of burning out but finding
like a sustainable pace of life and
stuff it's not just figuring that out
still Department is I'm definitely
excited by this week and showing Ryder
around this beautiful country twice we
got pulled over by the place
you have a driver license yeah yeah
why is he saying I could get my license
banned for 28 days which is not gonna be
good it's not gonna be good for us doing
a road trip and I can't man I don't even
know we were doing sports I was just
cruising just chillin just chatting away
guys always watch your speed to be found
in it I don't know what this big limit
is I'm not used to I'm not used to
Cologne with this yeah I told him it's
because we were rushing to get food JPS
I told him though wasn't an excuse I was
like this doesn't excuse it but this is
the reason um guys drive safely and
under the speed limit
this is where your attitude and response
to the police mutters a lot if you're
polite and and and admit fault but if
you're like defensive and angry and then
I haven't dealt with the police in New
Zealand before but in the UK they
usually but it may be so funny the money
you got left for the rest of your trip
four hundred dollars so guys we got a
ticket we've got a ticket for four
hundred dollars but thankfully they
didn't burn my licence so we can still
go on a road trip but I have learned my
lesson I'm going to be driving a lot
slower and abiding by the road laws in
New Zealand it's a very expensive lesson
to learn all right let's go and find JP
and get our dinner we've arrived to some
takeout curry at JPS go wait for us
Thank You Man and thanks lending us the
car as well is awesome very well story
if you get pulled over yeah thanks
turns out this Curry's pretty hot I've
been hiccuping my eyes are watering
my ears are stinging my nose is runny
say good point about you your is me no
I'm just actually enjoy
well it's great to spend the evening
with JP it's nice of him to put us up
and lend us his car all week
tomorrow we are heading over to get this
camper van like I said thankfully I'm
gonna be able to drive it and I still
have my license hasn't been revoked
because of speeding I have learned my
lesson guys but yeah let that be a
lesson to you as well
keep an eye on us bleeding a speed limit
which is apparently a hundred kilometers
an hour in New Zealand which is only 62
miles an hour but fair enough fair
enough
all right yeah see in the morning peace
out enjoy life amid the adventure
