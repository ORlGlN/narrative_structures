Hawaii this is yeah is it a massive goal
we're actually coming into the United
States which does mean am I about to put
on our smart piloting shirts which as
you know we've been wearing around the
world to you know just to certain places
we fly into they need that level of
formality anyway this is the last flight
actually probably soon off the take-off
I'm going to take my shirt off and get
back to my more casual wear
but yeah this is probably I think gonna
be like an eight hour flight it's gonna
be intense
I'm super pumped and yeah we need to
head to the airport now
jump straight on the plane and depart
just Psalter after sunrise okay sorted

to where the official beautiful we've
been wearing once we get to Hawaii and
they're not Spain land America pretty
casual as a private pilot they I'm glad

it's just blue darkest the Blues who
really fascinates me like what below
what's down there you know

massive whale like huge and I've never
seen everywhere in my life but I think
it was one better than that right - guys

I couldn't stand like it was right down
here but he said it and it was just I
just want massive splash and I was like
wow that's a big wave and then I
realized there are no waves and then it
was just this massive whale
390 miles ago
happy days I'll reality the halfway
oh yeah well operator yeah
350 392 go we have 700 behind
you know man I'm so excited
it genuinely feels like we're back in
America for me is that the island
it could be cuz they all parts of it
that's higher than up that has to be it
where you look at you see the clouds in
front of us
they're like yeah that's 100% the
islands it's poking out the pot oh wow
yeah I saw that 200 miles away and I was
like there's no way that could be it but
I just realized we're actually lower
then some of it think about that we're
at 15,000 feet oh my god that is insane
hi there this is November 2 under a
uniform we are 1 0 miles from Hawaiian
airspace flat level 1 3 0
I feel like an American because I'm
almost a little patriotic feedback so
weird like yeah so that's supposed to be
the bear occur this is cool this is very
cool I got so excited I went under the
phone it is so it's very familiar voice
voice if you wanted I sped along here
it's just affirm heading three six zero

yeah up just looking for that sweet 3G
thick enough it's gonna be LTE on the
ground

now JP and why we're gonna go pick up
Lindsay she's I think she's just
arriving around now and yeah we are

flight

Island we're refueling in the dark
all right we're not gonna see balu for a
few days now maybe hey maybe even like
five dates over a week I don't know if
you haven't fully figured out dates yet
but it's gonna be nice having a bit of
time to explore rather than just
back-to-back flights I think it's good
we've done it this way though like kind
of bombed it all the way to Hawaii now
we've only got one flight left back to
mainland back to California it's a
complete the entire trip and yeah we can
have some proper rest time it's better
than arriving to the to the summit to
the arrival party exhausted I feel like

we're gonna have energy you know I think
that's a better way to do it we are
picking up a set of wheels can a
sweet-ass minivan
