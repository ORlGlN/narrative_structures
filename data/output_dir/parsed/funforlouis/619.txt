this is Eduardo he is the owner of this
place and he is the chef that's been
bringing out all this amazing dishes
tell us about the three that you brought
out what I wanted to do with TVs let the
people know that Caputo is a place with
history many people think that Acapulco
was invented with Elvis Presley but
certainly not and Acapulco was the most
important commercial port Inn in America
in the in the 16th 17th century and 18th
century so for more than 250 years all
the commerce from Asia just to arrive to
Acapulco I wanted to show people that
like a pork oh he's been going on for
many many centuries and I want to make a
tribute to all those amazing sailors and
people that got involved in the spice
trade this is another of the foolish
it's a mixture between Mexican and Asian
food but taking a step further mixing it
with also with a little bit of
ingredient
my two favorite culinary cultures
wouldn't know thanks for having us
thanks for the delicious meal okay so
what I can put one one for you and that
you can find each other this is T bar
and it's with a crust of escargot and it
comes with a sauce with a little bit of
of truffle and and modificator which is
kind of like a steamed drive and a touch
of Gena tan which is this red sauce here
is with what's your Chili's coconut
green curry yeah
