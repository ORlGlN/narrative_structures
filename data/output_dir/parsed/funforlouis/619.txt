hi my name is gimpy and 9 from crossover
but right now I'm visiting Rob
you're watching Buffalo well good
morning guys check this video out how
insane is that this is just heaven it's
a good feeling
waking up in a tropical paradise cabin
in the jungle
oh we go it's wildlife everywhere we
were just sitting out here for about two
hours this morning just taking it all in
and watching birds flying around and
little green lizards running around on
the roof this is one of those places
that you just don't want to leave if you
know we were saying it'd be quite cool
to pause time here and just just be nice
check out those mangos those mangos I
think they're memories
look at our little cabin in the daytime
you see what the pictures are showing
you last night so cool how awesome is
its place right now well one day we have
all the treehouses you can make it rain
gonna head down to the beach cause
Winnifred beach nearby apparently is one
of the less touristy beaches Hey
hey mrs. great man
whoa hi guys how you doing hey yo
we are no longer on Google Maps a random
track leading down sidewalk where hype I
hope is the beach but you're nice and
it's pretty extreme
oh yeah I'm sure
your eyes lit down there huh yes we're
gonna go down to find some coconuts can
we get its coconuts we get some coconuts
thanks Cheers
so the original plan today was to go to
the Blue Lagoon apparently that's where
like busloads of tourists from the
cruise ships go so this is the local
kind of secret beach that we were told
about and unfortunately it was a little
bit too late to do the raft things we
should have left left like early morning
to do that but we had a beautiful
morning so I don't like this guy in the
hut behind me is just lent me a mask and
snorkel which I was like really sad I
didn't have the other day
so I'm exciting to explore there's a
little reef out here so I'm gonna go and
explore that maybe I'll put this camera
in the waterproof casing again and film
some bits
like the whole thing
unfortunately but it's okay we had a
really lovely swim and moving still out
there actually chasing fetch or
something
but yeah this water it's perfect it's so
warm and it's so clear when the water
was like up to my neck out there I could
feel my feet guys did you see those tiny
little zebra fish swimming around by the
tree I was not expecting those fish then
and then some guy as I was getting out -
told me there's a reef right there like
if I swam out a bit further but you'll
see all those sea urchins I didn't want
to risk stepping on one of those that
would have been pretty bad and I didn't
have any flippers did you have a nice
swim Riya yeah but that was bad for me
because I wanted to sink
I wanted to sink so I consumed the fish
but yeah
he chopped little bits of the coconut
that we can use the scooper out like a
spoon it's slightly off it took
something back at a cabin what you got
Raya we're making the bean thing again
what you requested even though I can
cook more than this okay so this is the
best thing okay you haven't okay whoa
you haven't had anything that I've
cooked you cannot say why does it cause
he's here hey Jamaicans
tell ya those are beans Oh red kidney
beans that's why people here they call
it like rice and peas guys I was like no
no I want read some be like yeah
guys if the ever seen orange juice in a
10 before
hey mr. frog
I'm back
I forgot to show you guys around the
house this morning I mean it's not much
this is but this is the this is the like
downstairs this is a little gas stove
that's running up this big-ass thing
down here and then this it's the
bathroom a shower with no door so I
could just be using the toilet here I'm
being like hey Roy yeah is there
anything I can do to help
okay okay but don't but know that's a
possibility
I'm making myself a little coffee why
doesn't drink coffee otherwise I would
be making i1c I just need to
double-check in here because yesterday
there was a beetle in the kettle yeah
dinner's ready we have watched so much
loves - guys we are know some of you are
trying to tell us clues of what's gonna
happen in the future in the comments
please don't do that yeah no spoilers
I'm not even gonna read these comments I
will I will but just know nice place
yes lost so we have an early morning
tomorrow we've got drive back to
Kingston to get off flights in the
afternoon and I'm thinking I'm not gonna
get up and have time to do the painting
so let's do it tonight before
we're like hurrying tomorrow and packing
and everything so we've got some
painters here we shall lift out and we
just need to find an empty patch on the
wall and think of a single thing to
paint so this is my spot I'm gonna get
you out first with this pencil so I've
sketched it out
I almost bumped into that cat well
that cat hey do you ever have that thing
where like you run out of room and then
you stop squeezing the littles really
small that's why it's always a good idea
to sketch them out first
yeah
it's done look and that is the completed
thinking Boise thingy that looks pretty
good
heck it's a Firefly it's just chillin
walking on our roof well it's the last
night in our jungle hut and I really
love this place I cannot wait
build something similar one day when I
finally buy some land
maybe with Dave that all happens again I
know I've talked about it a lot but it's
a dream is something I really would love
to happen I might try and talk to the
guy who owns this whole place and it's
built these houses stuff tomorrow
morning if we have time just to ask him
a bit about it and maybe he'll give us a
little tour of some of the other houses
and then yeah and we're driving to back
to Kingston and get on our flights so I
bet get some sleep in the morning peace
out enjoy life and live the adventure
