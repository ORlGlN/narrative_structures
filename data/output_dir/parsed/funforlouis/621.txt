hello my name is Luka I'm at the coat
Sauvage in France and you're watching
fun for Louis enjoy boom
good morning guys we've come down to a
beachside restaurant today for some
breakfast and I'm hoping when going for
a little swim because it's like paradise
it's like the most idyllic beach
I got cheeky little veggie burger some
rice fries and there's some sweet potato
coming for me as well for da Briah the
sea is calling us it's calling us we
need to we need to go
what did you get right
we had an incredible time down at the
beach I can't believe this is the first
time we've been here have been here for
a few days already yeah amazing
we're now heading to find a waterfall
which is nearby what's the name of the
waterfall Dunn's Dunn's River Falls
we've had a few people recommend that we
go and check out these waterfalls so
thanks if you've commented and one of
the other videos or places we should
check out thank you
the road we were walking around last
night to avoid getting attacked by dogs
gotta ask you guys what do you think is
the footage in the water basically I was
using this kind of underwater housing
things for my face of another so yeah
just experimenting I think for a lot of
ways it's not as good as a GoPro but the
quality that some of it should be better
I haven't actually lifted it yet but let
me know if you like that sir I came here
six years ago and she said from what she
can remember it isn't dry like we
shouldn't take our cameras well I can
take my GoPro but we shouldn't take
anything that's we can't get wet so I'm
going to leave my clothes and bag and
everything here and hopefully we can
capture the beauty of the water for
these guys so this was the housing I was
using on the beach it's just like a
flexible housing for a lot of different
cameras that I got from B&H I'm going to
test it out the water pooled as well see
how it holds up it could be quite nice
Oh Oh the floor is stony
guys that was just so beautiful
the rocks are so grippy we managed to
walk up there like it only I only
slipped once
and it wasn't that bad but yeah that was
like one of the most magical waterfalls
of Allsup I mean it rushing now to see
we can get to the toboggan run before
closes it's a bummer lapse like bobsled
yeah toboggan is that just an English
word doesn't sound English toboggan it's
like Austrian or something sensible like
Scandinavian maybe it's like a region
word
bad news guys we we rushed here because
someone had told us 5 p.m. was the
latest apparently they stopped the
bobsled at 3:30 so we're gonna have to
come back tomorrow morning
but I is very happy because she found
she found mangoes show us the mangoes
she's been talking about mangoes the
whole time say you enjoying your mango
guys we've urge you to leave Jamaica
tomorrow well we just couldn't we
couldn't come to terms of the fact that
we haven't done a lot of stuff that we
wanted to and it's just so beautiful
here so I think the plan is we're
extending our flights another two days
so that's the plan it's not definitely
air but I'm hoping we're gonna send our
flights the thought that makes me
this is nice so this is the restaurant
just having a quick massage before
dinner that's what I'm talking about I
just have massaged by three people at
the same time and it was the best
massage in my life I'm still in a daze
it was just
it's unbelievable right did you have a
nice sleep
look at the size of this month
everywhere
hey mister any of you guys scare the bus
this is stuff of nightmares
hello mr. lizard how you doing
dinner is served this is raster pasta
what did you get Raya
so I feel better be so angry with me you
know how I'm always losing everything
well this woman just came up to me we're
just sitting at the register on and she
said this is your passport and I was
like where was that she said it was out
in the car park I'd dropped it and I'd
bring my bag in it's just it's just been
sitting in the carpark this whole time
it's so lucky I need I had it in the
back of my bag but I just hadn't is it
too upset obviously fell out but oh my
god oh my gosh it's been a good day
exploring to make up
I think we're hanging around this area
tomorrow because there's lots of cool
things to visit around here and we've
only just scratched the surface we have
like I'm saying earlier we have now
changed our flights so we're not flying
out to for another two days so I'm
excited because we would have had to
leave tomorrow otherwise and that's just
not long enough I'm learning some things
about traveling still even though I've
traveled a lot is that I don't think
visiting new places that are cool like
really cool to explore I don't think
it's worth staying like less than a week
I think it's always worth trying to put
aside a week so sometimes I feel like
I'm just flying in and out of places way
too fast
to meet the people and really see the
culture and I doubt I will even really
get to absorb much of the culture and
staying a week but that's that's how
long I've got um and it's yeah it's been
it's been very cool very cool
well done Jamaica you're an awesome
country I'll explore some more of you
tomorrow peace out enjoy life and live
the adventure but
