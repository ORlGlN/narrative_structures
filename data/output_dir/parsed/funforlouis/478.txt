good morning guys it's day three of our
Icelandic road trip and we're going out
a little tour today we turned up at this
place late last night it's tiny little
village on there I think we're like
northwest of Iceland and we're about to
go for a little drive to see a cool
clear for maybe a seal colony and other
places what's your name again
Maya this is Maya we're staying on the
Mike so the boys can hear the back twice
quite a cup is quite the laying in if
you never you know Oh Billy Dennis oh no
this is the best tour ever
is this the part or long old machines
we've stopped off we're going to look at
some clips I can't pronounce the clips I
really caught I struggle to pronounce
there anything here Ashley needs to be
careful here
what are these cliffs called Lauterbach
loud for be let laughter BAM
yeah that is epic we are going up a bit
higher to the top oh the sleet is
stopped
there's still pretty damp oh oh well you
got Dave I've got an egg so see go egg I
think they really reach
so guys we've just looked at the map and
realized we are the we are at the
westerly most point of Europe right now
that is the westerly most toilet in
Europe but it seems to be closed
no well we've just pulled over to have a
look at this plane which we spotted from
the right it's the United States Navy
kind of military plane it's been
dismantled some old plane I've no idea
why it's here apparently this is some
kind of museum so good
there's taking the wings off right our
light you're thinking I'll just sported
can you actually get in is it bad
oh yeah what was that
hey we're inside the plane this is
amazing Wow explore the cockpit I'm on a
plane yes boy yes hey wait you want to
come and join us and they know we
climbed underneath and shine okay I
really want to live in a plane when we
finally get off forests and in our tree
houses we've got a plane in yeah even if
it's like one this size it doesn't need
to be like a commercial jumbo jet but
what if we got someone to accidentally
on purpose crash land an awesome plane
United States Navy boy Friday today
Larry we're going back to recommend bad
guys I can totally imagine having a part
of my house as a plane do you remember
when me and Steve went and visited the
plane graveyard in the West Country I
think this is a realistic size I think
we could ship this in I love looking at
old stuff old stuff so cool
right back on the road we're going to go
invite some seals now what Mike just had
a bit of Icelandic rotten fish you're
not feeling that Mike is that disgusted
anyone is the Julia what is it
so we're just waiting for the tide to go
out he here spotted a few signals there
sweetie someday out there those are
beefy toys aren't they he's going off to
get the other guys it was
kourin and Pat Curren and Pat have been
joining us today for our raw adventure
thanks for putting up with us
I'm Rachel we've been a little we've
been a little bit misbehaved
so thanks okay frat party yeah I like
yeah I'll let you started it'll see that
Cliff over there that's where we were
earlier enter that cliff
I won't steal one you see any sales Mike
oh maybe I check out that rainbow so
we've been told this sinking Sun here
that we have to avoid and if we do get
in sinking sand we can't move because it
will just make a sink faster so rather
slow down yeah Dave Joseph you spied one
and this one is a great one a massive
one right in front of me this same
I feel like a lot I was hoping to cuddle
one of the seals but they're a little
bit shy so you can get that close but it
was nice just observing they're watching
for a little while seeing the pop their
little heads are swimming around it's
this cool we were just saying me me and
Mike were saying that we don't observe
as much as we you see I think the pace
of life's fast and you know we're doing
so much stuff and I think sometimes just
stopping and watching for like an hour
maybe think it's a nice relaxed peaceful
thing to do
just watching wildlife thank you so nice
thank you so much noise yeah that was
lovely
well at the end I'm not a great day in
the West fjords of Iceland with my best
friends this is such a nice birthday
road trip and we've got a couple more
days to go
hopefully we're going to go and do some
horse riding tomorrow maybe visit
massive waterfall and to see some of the
other incredible sights around Iceland I
see in the morning peace out enjoy life
in the adventure boom
