hi I'm Amanda
aunty we're on st. John's at the US
Virgin Islands and you're watching
friends reliving morning guys
Lewis still fast asleep E he was editing
all night so I thought I'd let him sleep
and explore the area but I've I found
this natural spring
that's about well a few meters away from
our lodge but I followed it up about a
kilometer and I just found this oasis
and then desert literally it's just
water running around and it's just
stunningly beautiful there are a lot of
animal tracks out here which would
suggest that this is their only source
of water for quite a few kilometers
vibrance stream of water in in the
middle of the desert really is a
wonderful thing and it makes me
ridiculously happy there are quite a lot
of wildlife tracks out here I found a
little cat poor and judging by the size
of it it would eat the be a probably a
lynx or eight series cutter I found some
more tracks for you guys and what we
have here is a little bit in well I
heard JP took you in a bit of an
adventure this morning I'm finally out
of bed I did get to bed very late though
our sleeping patterns I'm quite aligned
but we've packed up we are leaving this
lodge we're actually flying to a new
destination let me see if I get a coffee
before we go
hello suzi class hey guys that's what we
called it
someone suggested in the comments on a
PDA like two videos ago pizzazzy is the
name of of guys just before I put my bag
in the plane I noticed there was some
what is this biltong no this is draw of
us sausage which we were saving for
snacks and the ants have got into it and
they are all in my bag so we pulled it
up when these ants in the plane get rid
of these ants
ready to roll do this let's rock
all right baby
oh yeah lunchtime I love that we can
just land any way we want to get lunch
set food oh that sounds good let's go
get lunch sir oh there's hardly any
window that's what the landing is so
easy yeah that's good landing all right
which way baby this way oh I guess
there's no real roads this town we've
landed in it's called voice and just
gonna chill here for a little bit
because it's pretty bumpy flying this
time of day not ideal for JP so we're
gonna get some lunch I'm going to try
and get my upload done for you guys and
and then head off again in like an hour
- we found a spot for lunch I just
pulled out my chair to sit down
and this guy was sleeping it on the
chair so just woken him up ah I think
it's gonna go back to sleep you so
fluffy
this is a perfect lunch guys beef and
chicken burger just gonna eat that
and we've got some chocolate milkshake
cheers easy well Lance definitely filled
a spot we're ready to roll again and she
is
all right so this is the right place
yeah yeah definitely
Hey
indeed ah no
joki where exactly are we
we're about 60 kilometres inland maybe
100 kilometres from the ocean and a
beautiful place called Busan cred and
friends of family friends run it and
it's a beautiful place and some fun
nice and we're now heading out to see
the sunset only somewhere beautiful now
we're running to to quickly set up some
time lapses because we've yeah we
basically run out of time we've arrived
at this rock formation just in time for
the sunset it's literally just just
disappearing but this is apparently an
incredibly unique natural phenomenon
it's pretty crazy
what's this place called Eagles rock the
head of an eagle
oh yeah it's spreading its wings oh so
awesome
JP saying we should camp out here
tomorrow night sleep like amongst these
rocks these are awesome
how do these get uncrate there's AG
while there are few factors is wind
erosion yeah and chemical erosion the
chemical erosion is mostly from the sea
fog that comes in although we're a
hundred kilometres it's like soap so sea
fog and you know the the moisture and
stuff just reacts with concern
it's crazy they're getting one a three
places in the world they have yeah it's
amazing
so we're back at the lodge and we are
getting dinner it looks incredible
what is it meat life sort of a meatloaf
here kind of meat life cook potatoes

delicious
