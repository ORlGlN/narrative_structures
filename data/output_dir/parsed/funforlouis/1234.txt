later so I think it's jacuzzi time and
it's raining a little bit so it's going
to be even cooler before we head out to
the hot tub please find the large vessel
to fill up with water because i always
get dehydrated of an address and alter
our thinking of ours out we've got bars
anyway all this woody this is the equity
nicely I like hot tubs in the rain do
you like hot tubs in the right now yeah
but I've gotta kind of get right under
because I don't like my talk torso game
where airflow enough from the thingy
this is nice that's fun wasn't Alan yeah
oh you can actually show my naked body
on the flow huh I'm not naked that's
lovely that's lovely
just go back to my parents house they're
in Brazil I dropped him at the airport
yesterday and they're away for the week
God sees that friends house but I'm
gonna be hanging out with her all day
tomorrow against I'm really fun but I've
had a really good day today with the
boys especially Alan sit in the hot tub
chan about life as usual but a few
things have been staring on my head and
I floor low chatter you guys basically
at the moment I feel in life like I'm in
a bit of a limbo period because I'm
going to Australia a lot of you know for
a number of months hopefully and at the
moment I haven't got something that I
wake up every day and I think that's
what I'm doing today which is cool in a
way because there's a spontaneous bunton
80 of enough to do anything but
sometimes I'm like I don't you know I
may as well just go back to sleep for a
little because I'm still tight but I
just saying to Alan tonight with this
slight level of discontent or apathy
towards staff and you know I'm just
comfortable right now it's pushing me to
a place where I'm just yeah not
satisfied and I want to be in a place
where I can wake up in the morning
excited about my day not necessarily
have set out plans but be like I know
what I want I know what I want to be
doing and a lot of my days recently lost
couple of weeks and he's brilliant like
friendship-wise have really been a lot
of time hanging out with friends and
building on friendships but in terms of
achieving things or doing stuff and
passionate about it is it's just been
hangout time and it's it's been nice to
rest in some ways but i think i'm at a
phase now where i want to be really
getting in some in my teeth into
something or at least getting an idea of
what what direction I want to be doing
things at the moment cuz there's so much
buzzer on my head there's like I've got
my boss or buses I've actually got two
buses which I could be doing things with
probably when i get back from Australia
I've got so many ideas but it's all just
bit of you know
a bit foggy and I kind of want to focus
on doing something exciting but
meaningful that's not just you know
skating around drinking coffee which is
nice but it's doing doing something a
bit more maybe involving you guys all
that kind of stuff and I'm also aware
that my life isn't perfect and I do at
times live what can be seen as a bit of
a shallow or indulge in existent well
existence where I'm just here doing this
thing you know eating out constantly and
and doing whatever I want and I don't
know if that's the best way to show you
guys how to make the most of life and
I'm sure there's other things i'm doing
which you're inspiring but I sometimes
feel like there's more I could do for
myself as well just like with my days
and even over this week I'm going to try
and eat with Darcy more hair like learn
to cook a bit more and I think we were
planning on making a video together
where she can teach me how to cook some
stuff because I've and I can I can cook
a little bit but it might just might be
fun and different and also for a lot of
you guys watching you haven't got the
money to be eating out all the time and
to be honest the main reason idea is
just because I'm out all the time so I
need to eat somewhere in its fun eating
with friends and stuff and but I'm
rambling on a bit and I just wanted to
let you guys know what's been buzzing
around my head and that yeah just that
it's it's good that I'm in this place
right now where I'm like oh I just wanna
wanna be doing something you know and
I've got about a month now with with a
little trip planned to Toronto but I've
got about a month to logo to Australia
say on pay Pinter to do a bit more
exciting things of my time I'm
passionate about anyway I leave it on
that night don't have any of that made
any sense but um I see you tomorrow
peace out enjoy life and lived adventure
boom
