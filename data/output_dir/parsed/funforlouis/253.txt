sighs sheriff I didn't Harry I'm coming
yes and you are watching
oh good morning guys
I just worked out we're leaving for
Italy and check it it snows overnight
I'll cool it that we've arrived at Lake
Bowen I'm about to get a little tour
stay strength Mabel the people oh you
brought the wrong shoes bright what are
you wearing - uh just nike manic and I
already feel water in my socks oh no
Dave to mess around trying to get some
solos come on Dave come on Dave
Oh
every scheme the weirdest learnings in
fact about this area this statue behind
me these four guys were the first four
guys to climb the highest mountain in
Slovenia called Rigler and they were dr.
farmer the geologist and a poacher and I
don't know when that was how many years
ago is that and they find it in 1778
1778 and this river here is the shortest
river in Slovenia only 100 meters long
from that bridge join this river here
you can't quite see the mountains but
we're surrounded by yeah mouth opened up
like a tiny bit for like ten seconds you
can see in the distance the highest peak
which is like 2,800 meters so it's
beautiful I hope it opens up again so
we've just walked down to this little
dock to get the classic Photoshop that
is the shot there with the bridge and
the church also guys you know are
talking about the lake freezing this is
the first time in eight years that it's
freezing and it hasn't fully frozen yet
but they're planning once the ice gets
thicker to be able to do ice skating and
cross-country skiing on it it's pretty
mad these ducks look so cold
oh right we're heading in yeah maybe
this change
I love its oldest churches for the most
over thousand years old
we've learned a lot of fascinating
things about the painting in his fresco
start painting from dating back to think
that the 13th century and then it's like
spanning over 400 years but the guy was
saying a few interesting things which
are unexplainable one of which is that
angels were painted with teeth which was
a very rare thing so they can't explain
what the Angels happy also a lot of
these paintings like these guys up here
a glance look like they've got their
eyes closed but apparently they just
have got white pupils so they also don't
understand why that is and then also
Cain and Abel you decide of the arts
right here and there's these little
devils that's been painted on which is
also very rare for inside a church that
there's Devils image so a lot of these
things are unexplainable but if ya guess
that makes me here so normally it's not
open for a normal tourist in the summer
it is okay gray but otherwise you have
to have special access yeah we have
special actor yeah
thanks a lot so hi thank you
come here if you're visiting Flaminia
lake bohinj very beautiful

yeah cheers for right time for my
driving set I haven't really been
putting my weight there's been then all
my cool the driver oh yeah very enjoy
that yeah all right we got we're going
to stop in Verona knew we were going to
do Venice but I think we've changed our
mind we're going to go to Verona now
it's a full hour 40 minute drive to
Verona which means we go to getting
there at 8:30 we do not stop at all not
going to start the romance just stopping
to refuel guys this weather is insane
like not quite a blizzard but almost a
blizzard and it just calls crazy traffic
issues like the highway is completely
jammed and the people like driving in
front of us like five miles now let's
try and not split on the road which is
kind of make sense both I unlike this
makes everything so slow so we're being
careful where we also want to get Revie
going it's so heavy it's nice
we've got a snack Riley's the things
you've got water bottle appropriate to
our height pretty much exactly what I
related somehow giggle map taking us on
the most random back road ever
I'm just hoping they're possible because
I can some of these roads you could have
deep snow on them yeah by the end of
this road Italy will be there yeah
tight like that taking us on a like a
winding route to avoid the motorway but
I don't think it realizes how steep snow
I go forward slowly is it just flip it
that just fitted the way or just
spinning
so what about momentum in it
okay we have a little issue here wonder
there's any snow trains in the in the do
you need to be really careful cuz we've
gone off the road we've gone off the
main tracks we've actually beard onto
the stick of snow at the back here this
is our scenario guys where the snows
pretty thick here but okay go for it
I'm trying to figure out how far the
road goes this is still road here oh
this is quite a predicament okay yeah
just go your net back now so like it's
going to come in too deep here yeah it
may be another meter and then
you know okay now back up again you
should make it this turn lock it to the
right yeah we got it we got it
oh good job Nadine see Kristen yes
teamwork good teamwork okay this is
crazy
it's no use stop we've managed to get on
the motorway and thankfully it wasn't as
bad as we thought is going to be that we
managed to avoid getting stuck in the
mountains for the night
I think we're about to go over the
Italian border they're coming up over
we are officially in Italy as you can
see we just cooked the border there
it wasn't even any science then welcomed
it right first thing to do in Italy
we're going get Italian food we have all
got pasta pretty much spaghetti
spaghetti spaghetti spaghetti in smoky
linguini with green is the green
spaghetti
I mean I'm into spaghetti and some
gnocchi all very Italian back on the
road back on the road well well a lot
