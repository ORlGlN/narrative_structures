my arm elevated I think this is how to
do it ah

cut it on guys I was just trying to get
the hairdryer off the wall so I just was
lazy I didn't want to sit here I wanna
chill in my bed and this bracket in the
wall

to me maybe the stitch yeah that's like
bad on them this is all that blood oh

Hilary spending at home right we're
heading out the hotel and so we're
getting a lift to the hospital to get my
stitches
right at the hospital we're just going
to check in on see if I can get my hand
Center I'm thinking two stitches I think
of two stitches I just showed them the
wound and it started gushing again all
over the place
all right I've been taken in here I'm
going to take a lie down and see they
can sort this out
this instead
that's
you're cool with injections I want here
oh you know terrible
some people tend to turn their
look at is it poisonous oh that is nuts
yeah I started good enough now I've
never had stitches before me my first
time so I'm going to start okay yeah

all right crazy well it's going to be
scar really badly

I have the craziest scar on my finger
there you go guys three three stitches
nice and Li no more blood well I managed
to do that without fainting guys I I'm
not sure whether I'm squeamish I think I
handled that okay I and I had to look
away to the injection but you know the
stitches kind of fascinate me
I believe my skin just opens up like
that is it would bet word of advice guys
