good morning guys it is 5:00 a.m. I
managed to sleep a little bit and we're
heading off to another sand dune this
morning to go sand boarding again we're
going to try and get there for sunrise
should be pretty epic
we've arrived at the beach and we are
trying to make our way over this hill to
a massive Sanji the only way to get
there is to drive around the coast but
the tide is really high at the moment so
we can't drive there in our vehicles so
some guys come to help us and he is
going to get with our equipment or the
stuff we need and similarly but as
possible in this car I'm going to drive
through the city apparently it's going
to get quite deep as well and make our
way around so it's really quite quite an
adventure how you feeling this morning
Devon it's a little jammed but it's
another day on the job
yeah dedication for education oh you
guys knew what we had to do to give
these shots we got some amazing locals
that are helped us out so we don't have
to hike in 45 minutes we're going to be
driving through the ocean in a car so
I've actually never done it
yeah this is serious so Connor what are
the chances of survival not like maybe
like 17 I was pretty good
I wait longer we've just been getting
all the equipment set up and now we're
going to make her way way up with Sandy

like I'm gonna start an avalanche hi

it's very steep slope cards just hiding
the bushes there with some slight line
these guys are going to go as well

we have spent the whole morning walking
up and then coming back down
this massive slope on their little
boogie boards and been exhausting but
it's been awesome and some of these guys

pretty scary coming down there we've now

looking so cute I want a pet I'm gonna
pet hedgehog I let you go back stay safe
then get run over
we are back at the most relaxed airport
in the world so chilled just checking in
luggage goes there straight out to the
plane this is what I'm checking in I'm
allowed to hang on to my penny board
which is cool one of the problems with
traveling with all this high-tech camera
gear at some times
airports don't like it okay so we have
some big batteries with us which
apparently aren't allowed on the plane
so I think made me go show you know it's
not looking good right now and I can let
us take the ten thousand watt batteries
with eight thousand million batteries on
the way my idea gravity plane my options
right now I guess they have some kind of
cargo hold for extreme things but it
says they have permission all stuffs not
slightly it's pretty soon another day in
life everyone thinks it's a dream but
it's not my language will overcome it
will figure out now your eyes are calm
that's a good ei filmmaking at the
overcome and the best filmmakers are
people that overcome so little update
we're not allowed on the plane in the
batteries so we're trying to figure out
a solution to get the batteries down to
Auckland it's a six hour drive for the
car rental place is closed now bit of
her last I'm Jordans Connelly has to
stay to deliver the batteries by a by a
car and we're going to rush them to the
plane for I have a good Drive sorry I
can't join you alright that's nuts in it
ladies gentlemen we're all good
I've been sitting here editing and
because we waiting it for a few hours
for Jordan I thought I'd snapchat and
tell people I'm chilling down here and a
couple of people are showing up say
hello do you want to introduce
yourselves I'm Shawn I'm Connor I'm Kim
and you will live in Auckland and
literally they just come down with like
I don't know like half an hour's warning
on snapchat and so it's cool it's like a
an impromptu meet-up so sorry
if you didn't see my snapchat in you
from Auckland maybe next time
Devin showing some of these shots we
film today to everyone so we have the
good moment in here something so yeah

best parts well that was super nice
