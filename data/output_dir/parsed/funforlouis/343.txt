good morning guys sadly this is our last
day in the Maldives but we are flying to
Sri Lanka for some adventure so I'm
pretty excited before we go we're trying
to get some last final photos of this
incredible place and this is yeah this
is just paradise if you haven't seen the
last few vlogs you need to check them
out we've been doing a lot of cool
things guys check out these sharks right
in the shallows
whoa suing so fast this is incredible
how cool is that everywhere right
photoshoot wrapped I've managed to pack
most my stuff and now we need to head
for lunch now it's a great start to the
morning
casually sharks swimming around us in
the shallow waters literally no fear
they were just cruising in a little
squad right I'm laying off the curry
today because yesterday was crazy
these are Singapore noodles oh my
dyslexic parent myself
well sadly it's time to leave it's
jumping in our boat to the airport
Thanks
this has got to be one of the coolest
airport locations ever you literally get
off your bike
get your little trolley to your baggage
and go straight in
you're a strong independent woman you
don't need a guy to carry your back but
I will I carry if you want I put my
drawing up in the overhead luggage
compartment I'm hoping I don't forget it
I get in on the last flight
we're in business plus and this is
pretty nice isn't it
do not I don't always travel business
does not often actually but when I do is
like the difference between reading
lines that fly so much now and really
enjoying their massage right
we are reading through the in-flight
magazine for shrunken Airlines and
randomly at the big address to Bulgaria
it's so cool we went that way
I mean so those people we saw them
singing
well welcome to sri lanka this is my
74th country that banty and I just
ticked off my my bean and they just told
me that it's pretty exciting also it's
pretty exciting in a way also maybe a
mistake
me and Roy a basically haven't planned
anything this week all we did last night
was we booked some way to stay which is
like an hour's drive from here it's kind
of nice other than that literally we
have no plans are you excited or worried
that we have no plans
make sure that yeah so yeah we're gonna
do some research and make sure we don't
miss out thank also thanks for your
suggestion sky's those that commented
the other day in the blog very helpful
stuff the first thing you want to do
when you get off an aeroplane buy a
washing machine
I'm getting my sim card sorted 25 gig of
data for $25 is it $25 nice alright we
are getting in this random car
apparently I can't drive a rental car
with a UK license I need to go and get
another things this really is gonna get
now like some kind of permit
so we just shown up with this guy's
house which is I think some kind of
travel company and yeah we are
I paid for a permit and we've rented a
car this is our car for next week water
the human eye laser and insolence now
asking the police okay that sweet this
is so random like he was like yes a
kilometer away is a massive sign
recurrent or big claw rental place
literally some dudes house when we put
down this Lane we arrived alike where
are we where are we getting taken is
this a scam I don't think it's a scam I
mean we have a car I mean at this point
we can stand them and just take the car
so I think but I have a secret I haven't
told you so when we pulled up here I
thought like for a second I was like
we're going down a dark street and I'm
slightly scared so I took my card my
passport and there in my bra
right now wow yeah because if they would
like took our stuff those are the two
things you need money you need your
passport
because two of my friends got mugged in
Colombia and got everything taken and
that was like the hardest thing getting
a password just to be able to go home so
you didn't do that did you
no I didn't do that I actually even
worth I gave him my husband guys check
out this guy chilling in the back of
that truck on the couch just smoking
it's just it's just chilling really
looks like it in his living room
amazing that is help
sweet well guys that I have done it
again I've stayed up all night editing
it's light outside and I'm supposed to
be driving today like four hours to this
other place that we want to go to I need
to try and find some balance this week
in make sure they don't burn out because
with the amount of amazing things we see
and then the Edit time to make those
vlogs what I wanted to be for you guys
it doesn't leave me a lot of time to
rest and sleep so bear with me I'm
hopefully gonna get the balance right
maybe someday it's gonna be a bit more
chilled so I can not stay up all night
editing but anyway I'm I'm glad to be
here in Sri Lanka and I'm looking
forward to the exploration of this week
and yeah I'll catch you in the morning
peace out enjoy life amid the adventure
