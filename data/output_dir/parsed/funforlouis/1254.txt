photography over today I need to drop
the check off the bank but just having
some nice properly sisterly bonding time

just in natural things around so like
shapes that look like letters and take
photographs so we were just kind of
looking now keep your eyes peeled this

the Darcy's already got an S J
look at this fence this the letter a
lesson led horsy your American letter X
are the letters can you see they'll see
what letters do still need to get
like these footpaths because they're
like these hidden little passageways in
between houses and walls and stuff I
feel like we're gonna find a door into
like a secret garden with all these I've
it all this ivy hanging over us as well
so cool I love going on little walks and
having the time to like appreciate our
surroundings it's nice it's nice in
there dusty
so we're just wandering down the river
and we bumped into three kids who are my
viewers hello what your names and they
are cool you said you've got a YouTube
channel what's your YouTube channel
oh cool today
guys look how cool this triggers yeah
but look there's like a den boy let's go
this is amazing I actually remember
trying to swing for me natural beauty
the natural beauty around us in this
world never gets boring or old I'm
always just like in awe there is that
like a wild flower garden oh that's cool
I always used to do this as a kid yeah
whoa gymnast that's me
I've got home and I need to crack on
with some editing
I've got convert loads of files that we
filmed in India I'm gonna take most the
evening
so been sitting here for hours
converting files very tedious but we
ordered the Domino's Pizza
and it's a right mr. Darcy what did you
tell the pieces delivery guy to draw no
you sure that is I think it's a
chemistry teacher or maybe it's like
having a meth lab like a Breaking Bad
I've been a nice day and hanging out at
RC it's cool around here and then grab
the piece and stuff I've got quite an
editing done comparing flowers all that
pretty boring stuff but it's gonna be
amazing and now Steve has invited me out
to a club that old-school garage no
unitary there and no dance
I thought we'd knock down the house stop
getting that out
quite the establishment I have to borrow
a jean jacket to get thanks though
look at this guy hey man hey man nice to
meet you
I go for it though jump it super good go
go so badly these boys these boys hey
yeah yeah a good night I've had a
fantastic night those guys were jokers
who is that it's good fun it's a bit
weird there's some older women America's
griping me I didn't really know quite
what to make of it I kind of just ignore
them
it's bit hard though and they were like
squeezing about
I'm cruising home now
me and Steve we're just saying we'd love
to go out before I think we used to go
clubbing all the time but like two
really good clubs in London and I think
we're going to start hitting up some
clubs again
get like really get dancing on the dance
floor my stuff it's worse about it's a
good music
I'm off to sleep it's been a good day
it's been good hanging out with Darcy
it's important to hang out with family
you forget that sometimes because you
kind of take them for granted
they might always be there um yeah I
really value my family I also you may
have noticed have started using the
intros that you guys sent me for the
videos again I stopped for a while just
because I was it got back from India and
