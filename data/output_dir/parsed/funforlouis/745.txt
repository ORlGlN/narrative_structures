bumped into Ken yeah yeah ken has also
got YouTube channel he does daily
vlogging so I'm gonna link him below you

think he's over at the Empire State
Building we're going to stop off and
grab another coffee
and I've also lost throw a Rachel
they're gonna shove me somewhere we've
arrived at Chelsea Market we're gonna
have a little wonder around maybe they
want to get back you want to get a crew
back somewhere
I'm not usually into shopping but well I
know any something's and I can enjoy it
JP and we are in an elevator and we are
gonna sink and get into the YouTube
space which is in Chelsea Market
so unfortunately they're filming a bunch
of stuff today and so we're gonna have
to come later in the week that's all so
these are Disney Princess it looks like
that
big girl out of frozen guys it just
popped into a glasses store
I'm not so sure about these guys is what
do you guys think kind of crazy
we've walked into a kitchen supply shop
and Janie is gonna buy or hopefully buy
a at a piece of stone because the
apparently is an incredible pizza chef
Stokes is going to cook us all a pizza
later in the week we just need to make
sure we've got the right thing you found
what you need really big into a pizza
restaurant
wow this is is this one of the best
pizza places is apparently one of those
places we're pretty hungry and maybe
even
the white flag with some marker baby
artichoke
do you have hot sauce thank you what is
that bus sorry saying weirds happening
be chillin for a few hours and now we're
heading back out to meet actually meet
stool in the guy that I've met on the
plane over here and some friends
we walk through the lobby they're like
oh you know it's raining outside doing
an umbrella I was like what guys let us
out
right
okay
I don't know where we going
yeah yeah
our brothers up rather than brothers
umbrellas everywhere yes so where were
the bars so guys we have been set up at
the bar here for the last hour or
something
the rain has died down it's a lovely
evening but I've also to remember Salim
who we met on the plane he's introducing
me to his friend Noah who runs this
incredible site for narratively
any time I do is never about you so we
launched narrative Li about three years
ago the web sites narrative dot ly and
we're a digital publication focused on
ordinary people with extraordinary
stories so really trying to rise above
the noise and the clutter and the
clickbait and the breaking news
headlines and until the the powerful of
human stories that we think are really
important and aren't being presented by
mainstream media so good example for
instance we're sitting here the
Manhattan Times Square you can hear the
sirens going on down to us you know the
five stories down we did a story that
was really popular called The Secret
Life of Manhattan doorman you're looking
at the guy with the white gloves and the
button jacket that you know sits in the
lobby of the this famous building and
you know maybe seems like it's an
ordinary job but yet behind the scenes
here these really incredible stories of
stumbling upon sex parties or you know
people passed out from drugs or
you know dead bodies or what have you so
it's really we've done a story about for
instance a personal essay by a woman who
grew up in a cult so he's really in our
dynamic personal intense sad scary funny
uplifting depressing whatever kind of
stories that aren't really giving me
giving attention
main media and we told them once a week
once a day and rating film comics
journalism audio so really just kind of
celebrating the underdog and we're
having a great time you know being a
champion for these types of stories well
that's pretty incredible meeting Noah I
think it's amazing when you meet people
where you're in a similar wavelength and
you're so for instance we're just ranked
for like an hour about sharing stories
and the whole thing he's doing
it's just similar to what I want to get
into is where I can get a chancer
because obviously I live film my life
every day and share it with you guys but
there's people out there with incredible
stuff going on in their lives and they
don't have a platform or way of sharing
it so it's cool what he's doing and I'm
gonna link it below and go and check out
the site and yeah
well it's been another fun day in New
York and I'm winding down for evening
about eights bet I swell just to show
you guys something I'll just show you
how awesome rachel is and writing stuff
so basically I've had this nightmare
last couple of months of wanting to
rebrand my channel and we've tried to
get some logos designed and things and
I've basically come to the conclusion
that I want to have a handwritten logo
so we've been looking at tons of
typography Instagram accounts and stuff
like that but anyway Rachel where we
went to the art supply store the other
day she started playing around check out
some of these sheets that she's been
jotting and sketching his stuff but look
at this I think we found my new logo
guys check that out
so we're gonna I think we're gonna scan
this in and start using this some web
banners too for that I really love this
so just wanted to show you what would be
not too sweet I am going to get some
sleep now
and I'll catch you guys tomorrow Nick
and Anja arriving I'm super excited
peace out enjoy life oh wait one thing
one thing also all day I've been
vlogging on the Sony rx100 mark for what
do you guys think do you think this is
much better quality than the miss camera
then the the g7x which have been using
for months now yeah I'd love to hear
what you think all right
peace-out enjoy life and live the
adventure
