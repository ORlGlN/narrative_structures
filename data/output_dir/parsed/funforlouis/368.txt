Berlin just spent a few hours doing a
photo shoot for a project I'm working on
which you'll see on Instagram see and
now we're just going to go and explore
we've got a little pedal boat and we're
just going on a little bit of an
adventure on this river here guys check
out this river plane we need to get one
of those planes well maybe maybe not get
one but we need to go on an adventure
one of those planes
I'll get talking to Josie definitely a
float floating plane sure that's the way
forward can land anywhere earlier we
just saw income and land on the river
literally just in the middle of the
river and then just drove over there but
it's a boat in the plane and what are
these called willows yeah
we've waiting where they think of that
yeah the trees are so cool
this guy is almost full enough had a
blackboard about three times so you go
and push them in come on also I'm
definitely too big for this like when
I'm trying to pad on my feet keeping
getting stuff in that I'm about very
intense winter boots hey this is the
perfect weather for winter boots

yeah you said you like these trees
for that
oh boy and boy Mikey spikey-wikey spikey
heat is puppy hey spiky spiky ooh sharp
little baby teeth
so we have just arrived at the Berlin
Wall the Berlin Wall had a lot of
historical relevance here it was torn
down or started getting torn down in
1989 after separating West and East
Berlin so it was like I think East
Berlin was part of the Soviet Union
there's this big divide anyway like
families have separated yeah I remember
being in my bedroom as the kids and just
trying to get my head around what was
happening I must have been six yeah must
be six years old or five and half of
those things where everyone remembers
where they were when it happened
leave a comment if you were alive and
you remember that yeah it was a big deal
it was a really big deal when it
happened I think is it it's been I think
from reading the date it's something
like nineteen didn't say 1961 in 1961
till 1989 it was dividing Berlin and and
then in 1989 they decided to allow
people to visit the West Berlin from the
east it was like I remember seeing in
the news like people get sledgehammers
and smashing the wall down and everyone
was like going crazy and it's like yeah
this really there's a really big deal
you
we've just arrived at the Reichstag
building check this out
that is pretty epic isn't it
guys Riya has run to get some food and I
just come down to the place we came to
last night with this amazing plane
balanced on top of the building I think
this is some kind of Technology Museum
but I'm going to get P photos here and
then go get our bags from the hotel
don't forgot Riya with all our food and
then head to the airport because it's
already like 4:00 p.m. and we have to
get to the

you don't see on every tourist page and
Instagram account when you discover your
own special little secret spots
I like it alright I got me some food
from the vegetarian place ba last night
and this is a very interesting dessert
this is hot - tapioca and banana coconut
pudding it's pretty good ready
