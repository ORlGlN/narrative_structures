hey guys I'm making a video today to
respond to the massive amount of
criticism have had over my North Korea
vlogs I don't know if you've seen but
I'm all over the press with accusations
that I'm being paid by the North Korean
government as a tool for propaganda and
I that makes great headlines there's no
truth in that whatsoever I'm not being
paid by the North Korean government and
actually I want to make a statement now
I do not agree with the North Korean
ideologies but I do care for and love
the people there for those of you that
new to my channel my name is Louie
I travel the world having fun adventures
and I share those with my audience I've
been to developed countries developing
countries with a range of political
problems and social justice issues too
my favorite cities Cape Town and Rio
have the biggest wealth disparity in the
world but I am looking for the beautiful
positive things I want to connect with
local people learn about the culture and
the country I am NOT a investigative
journalist I don't really do political
commentary and there are other places on
the internet you can go to find those
kind of things so this trip to North
Korea as many of my trips I went on as a
tourist and we went on an organized tour
so the same kind of taught anyone going
there as a tourist with experience and
as much as we can be skeptical about how
much was real and how much was staged
that is what I experienced and I can
only share with you guys what I
experienced so that's what I did on my
videos the assumption I made which may
have been wrong of me was that people
watching my North Korea vlogs would have
already had a broader perspective on
North Korea they would have seen
documentaries they would have seen news
articles as I have and I want to
reassure you that I do know what's going
on out there
and not being naive to it all and maybe
I should have at the beginning of each
vlog encourage people to go and do their
own research and find out all that they
can about North Korea so I want to
explain how I ended up going on the trip
now my friend Lane posted on Facebook
that he was going or wanted to go so I
contacted him and found out that he was
going with an organization that were
running their third annual surf school
so I asked if I could join the team and
come along so the guy organizing these
trips has been visiting North Korea for
17 years
doing humanitarian relief work he
doesn't work for the government but he
has been building a relationship with
the government and with the people there
and I don't want to jeopardize any of
the work that he's done with the content
I've been creating so Philip DeFranco
he's a popular youtuber and he made a
video about this unfolding drama he
criticized me with an analogy about
being taken on a tour around a big
mansion knowing that there's rooms with
murder and torture going on in them but
only being shown to the rooms like the
nice swimming pool and the kitchen and
the games room and then leaving that
mansion just talking about those things
my only question to that is what about
the people in the house that are in
those rooms in the nicer rooms I think
the only way to make a difference is to
connect with those people and show them
love and maybe that will impact the
entire household so if that means
surfing or going on these tours then I'm
really keen to do that and I'm the only
thing that sad is that I can't show you
all of the relationships that I've built
and the conversations I've had
off-camera which i think is something I
always struggle with with my blogs in
Pyongyang and the capital we went to a
water park and we were surfing in the
wave pool there and there was this one
moment where I looked around and there
were eight different nations represented
there was people from Sweden Switzerland
Canada the US the UK North Korea Russia
I think there's another one Finland okay
and the Russian guy was actually just at
the water park and he was from the
embassy the Russian embassy and one of
the North Korean tour guys turned to us
and said and surfing brings peace and I
think that was a very strong message and
I I think it really does I really really
think it you know as it as you've seen
with the Olympics a lot of sporting
activities I don't know if you saw the
selfie of the North and South Korean get
gymnasts with a peace sign that I'll
show you here like for me those things
break down barriers and I think that was
the whole purpose of us being able to
connect with people out there so I leave
you with this final thought a North
Korean business specialist Felix at said
if you have no presence in the country
you cannot influence anything for the
better and I think the future of our
relationship like our the international
community's relationship with North
Korea is fully dependent on
how well we know them and the intention
of this trip was to go out and get to
know them better and I'm happy to say I
made some friends out there and I'm
really looking forward to going out to
visit them again
