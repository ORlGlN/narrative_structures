opportunity to do this sunbathing I'm on
the bonnet for the third film of the
last day I hope you vendors drive up it
I've jumped off there's a little bit of
rearranging happening before we head off
because basically these guys after the
music festival are heading off all the
way up the coast to Mozambique on a road
trip I'm hoping to join them in probably
like a week and a half after I've just
done some stuff in Cape Town so they're
getting getting the land a all prepped
and ready hey
we just stopped off to get some food
snacks and trying to follow Nick and
Andy's advice I got nuts
I got bill Tom I got water to drink so
there wasn't any other hot food is
either Wimpy's or or points of chicken
pies so I bought some chicken pies I
don't think they're that healthy but no
other options
these roses triple-a access right then
show us how you transform transformers
so it turns out I mean SP don't have
intense so we might just have to sleep
out on the grass in see the bags under
this I think it's gonna right now wait
we could probably sleep under the car

people have been laughing at me for
drinking milk I think it's good source
of calcium Thanks and managed to find
