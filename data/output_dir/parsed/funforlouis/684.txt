hi I'm Sharon and you're watching fun
Philly boom good morning guys
it is almost 9 a.m. and we are leaving
Hastings where we stayed last night and
we're driving down the coast to Rye
which is where we're leaving this
morning and we are heading into the blue
yonder on this boat which I'm glad
didn't get stolen last night we just
left it there with the motor and
everything this four of us Nick is gonna
be hopefully catching a ferry from Dover
and meeting us the other side
the day's looking nice the seas looking
calm and I just wanted to mention as
well guys with all the tragedies in the
needs of moment with refugees trying to
cross large expanses of the ocean and
the Mediterranean and stuff and
you know we we realized how dangerous
this journey could be and how privileged
we are to I guess have the safety of
some of the equipment we have and and
also we've been planning this for quite
a while now maybe three months and we've
alerted the Coast Guard and we've got a
support boat that's going to be on call
so we're doing our best to be safe and
Andy's done quite a bit of research
about crossing and stuff so and we don't
want to be too blase about it because
these kind of journeys can be quite
dangerous do this boys
okay living building okay big enough
right there as well so one of you is
probably a carbon attack
they've kept Andy up all night snore Oh
kid I almost fell out at the end point
still touch my leg we just found out
that until recently might thought this
whole thing was a joke
breakfast is done and then white is
almost high enough for us to launch the
boat now we need to reverse this guy
down this ramp you confident about the
crossing Andy so wheels going to be a
scouring across the channel first first
safety check with our walkie-talkie and
Andy forgot to charge the battery so we
haven't got any means of communication
unfortunately the other way and turn it
over why Brown other way other way

week my channel at the moment oh they
are going to rock us like horribly over
yo
we went what not now but where what are
we in the wrong are we in the wrong
place we're in the military profession
right no not yeah really ability to
that's why 15-mile here we decide that
we all forgot
so this air is a military area and
they're shooting out from the beach into
goes over the top so boot bullets could
be whistling past us so we should have
gone much further away boys out there
