met a girl serving coffee who's one of
my viewers it's lovely welcome to the

apparently there's no uber in Montana
there's no lifts and apparently there's
no taxis waiting out here either so I
have to call a taxi to get into town for
a meet up with everyone else I've got a
few things to buy basically I was by
tired this morning I totally forgot to
take my MacBook charge of hotel room so
I'm going to pop him and get one another
thing I forgot when I left the UK with
my verizon Wi-Fi box because and
t-mobile which I'm using my phone hasn't
got very good cell service over the
state so I'm the pop in here
they're setting me up a little Wi-Fi box
I just found out the mall closes in like
20 minutes so go and buy a few other
things I need but yeah thank you so much
all right I've got some outdoor clothing
that I needed time to get my verizon box
guys the absolute legend at Verizon gave
me an a spare jetpack which is their
little hotspot box for free he gave me
two for $50 it is such a glorious day
I'm really looking forward to the next
couple of weeks basically we're going to
be we're going to be roughing it a
little bit no luxury accommodation

for you guys were actually getting the
Wonder wagon which you probably haven't
seen oh I haven't seen since the end of
last year over six months ago maybe like
eight months ago when I left it in San
Francisco so it's been in storage and
and I'm having it delivered to Montana
so we can drive it around it actually
turned out cheaper than renting a car
just to get someone to drive it up here
so I'm looking forward to being reunited
I love that guy the Wonder wagon guys
