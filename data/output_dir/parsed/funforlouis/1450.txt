with Davey wavey for a few days I'm
super fly and we're heading out to get
some stuff this is an amazing day
apparently it never rains here so we've
arrived at Home Depot we're getting
stuff for a video family I love places
like this and make sure you want to do
all the latest stuff baby explains what
we're actually getting today a giant
penis yeah we're constructing a balance
beam that we're gonna have a really for
the boob Olympics
and it's safety first here in Palm
Springs so this is hopefully gonna stop
our heads from splitting it's even
warmer here than it is in LA it's like
like in the middle of a desert
surrounded by mountains so du/dr this
breakfast place kuchiki's
and see and so I scooted or skated here
to get a meal got a nice little latte
here and we all have it a mixture of
breakfast and lunch I didn't really know
what meal it is today right
run brunch lunch so now suddenly little
somebody for the pool is actually the
first time I've just children a son
since we've been in America okay so the
guys have convinced me to put hair
removal cream on my face don't really
know how this is gonna turn out is it
feels normal at the moments not stinging
but firstly it's gonna sting I'm in so
much pain I'm in so much pain
fill up my faces a fire can I put
aftershave for my cheeks and it
literally felt like someone stepped over
the face of I like so bad
why yeah it's all red I've now got a
really patchy stubble or I don't know
how this is so bad wait you don't
understand that it's still this is like
an hour later and I'm still in agony
practicing clear doping today

gonna give you a little tour of the
garden quickly this is amazing orange
tree with like massive oranges on it

plastic like astroturf and it's really
soft

prosciutto what I think this is the
first one fish meal we've had since have

I'm just about to get a hot tub with
soil oh this is
I was just thinking tonight I'm chilling
in the hot tub like a couple of months
ago me and Sam were driving around the
UK and this was like what we dreamt of
every week was finding a hot tub and
being able to relax and have a bit of
luxury because it was like crazy on the
bus driving all night and now like most
nights we're enjoying some sense of
luxury whether it's at Sawyer's or here
at Davies and I just don't know I just
really was thinking that I it's
something I want to take for granted I
just really appreciate it and I do I
realized how amazing it is and ya know
I'm just having to think about that
tonight that's tougher grant it's that
were you like when we get cool stuff
happening in our lives so there's a deep
thought for you guys Oh see you in a
couple of days peace out
