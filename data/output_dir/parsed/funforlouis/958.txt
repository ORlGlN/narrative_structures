and a bit our flight from Doha
it's good to be back it's about the UK I
just need to go and report my last love
the guitar
back of my parents house and I've been
chilling here for a little bit about the
head straight back out again pretty much
up to London during the Jamie Oliver or
food Tube channel we're going to be
tricked exciting together I bet drive to
the train station
I'm horribly jet-lagged I look fairway
I just got the tube um wouldn't open oil
Street where Jamie Oliver doctors are
and it's already getting dark and then
I'm just checked and the Sun sets at
quarter past 4:00 today I've been out
the country a month and the Sun is now
set for bus oh that's not okay no I go
here we go hello hi it's Lois
right I've arrived at the food to studio
we're just getting ready over here how's
it going Jamie I love what we what we're
doing today
me well my inspiration for use Nando's
so Brown luck members yeah so well legs
and breasts piri piri sauce but fresh
nice knife I've cut up sheets I know you
like cheese or any cheats salsa that
takes about 30 seconds okay okay and
we're doing some sweet potato chips Oh
amazing because I'm I'm told that's what
you like I like yeah he knows everything
a lot it's perfect so I've got my mic
start look put in the back pocket here
whoo professional look here's the
cameras nice nice well it's gonna be fun
it's gonna be fun why we're starting to
starting happy your brother Joe laughing
but please bring in your hostess Bacchus
handy
so if you want to split your chicken
I've got now two cameras in to go that
breastbone big knife and do one long
move then bash it and then all the way
through and that is your Harper chicks
that easy
next stage we're doing the time this is
the herb that we're getting ready for
the marinade but what until was if I
know what was going to be quite
interesting is like we've got a whole
career here that we got we got look we
got one two three cameras Steve what is
yours looks better than mine you're
going to be responsible to all these
people getting fired
that's really rough man so somehow with
one hand you've got a mess I like the
flavor injection okay I'm gonna I'm
gonna mix this marinating now we added
some oil to the cut so yeah there's no
right way to do it and if you cook that
straight away that would taste lovely
and if you let it marinate overnight
that is very good nice marinating Chloe
let me touch the screen to focus I like
the camera that's a really artistic shot
probably doing the next bit I don't you
probably swooped in that for this way
isn't that will Jamie show me the next
bit excited yeah who's going to be good
ready yeah while we're doing some sweet
potato fries look at the way each shapes
left-handed it guys if you want to see
this video from a different perspective
a different point of view it is camera
now it is coming now and see a better
version of this video pressure on you
yeah well that's semolina and they used
to make desserts out of that in the
1920s well we're going to put it on
sweet potato fries so this is going to
go super crispy that has a lot of
texture to it
yeah crunch right but we're just
throwing the chicken and the sweep tape
right in the oven how long do we need to
put in the network I'm going to put
and as we could make about 35 minutes 30
minutes so I and how long was it on the
griddle about 5-10 minutes until
challenge
now if Chile
the simplest cheats sauter
ever in their brilliant color great
flavor or homemade peri-peri sauce
blending these roasted vegetables so
with the chilies I'm going to taste
income what we want to get our chili is
we want the heat but if it's just mental
here you'll never taste the moon and so
what we do is we keep the chili but we
try and lose the seeds you know but I
think my favorite chili actually is a
scotch bonnet yeah yeah that's like
that's like the heat I like I concur
shall I add heart start with yeah cuz
I'm a bit worried you're being a bit
crazy chillies added okay a few other
little or spices as done we do it from
there lemon juice down meercatvinny Gong
its taste so good how's it all going
Jamie oh really well you're asking
really good questions she liked the
sauce still on my lens
how are you happy about that yeah it is
sorry about that you know in chilies is
a chemical called capsaicin which as the
nearest natural form of morphine on the
planet really and so it releases so
that's the addictive thing very much so
yeah but it immediately releases
endorphins so I don't know if you've
ever eaten chilies quite quickly and you
have this woosh this kind of like pick
on wall yeah and got your washing
because it actually actually eating a
hot chilli will have a faster effect
than an expresso if you want to pick me
up in the morning oh really yeah cuz
like all this I don't know in your life
but like in my life sometimes I'm not
going to a job yeah I've got to be on
the ball yeah and like on my way here I
just got the flight jet light and fell
asleep on the train had to drink a Red
Bull
yeah you should either do a load of
coffee but actually if you just Nick a
lot of chili sauce or questionis amazing
picked you up this is a bigger than a
life-changing
listen mate when all my mates are going
raving and dropping pills and doing all
that filthy stuff then I just had a big
chili necklace man yeah that Louisville
sir ball guys right people should try
that at home I've been told that you've
got a special relationship with coffee
here I am that's true told a lot of
stuff about you and food actually in the
last day 24 hours so I feel why I do is
try and get you to try coffee and a few
ways you'd never end it before I I might
mess with your taste medium and see if
you like it I'm totally up for that so
I've made you a coffee granita because I
know that pocket so basically this is it
it looks like snow and when they went
when you go ski and they always say
don't every brown snows or yellow snow

very very tasty delicious but let's give
