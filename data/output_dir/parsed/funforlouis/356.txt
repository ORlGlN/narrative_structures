well today ended up being a little bit
more chilled than I thought it's gonna
be but it's lovely time catching up with
Alfie I decided to crush it his ass
tonight because it got pretty late and
also me and Dave are heading over to see
a venue that we've booked for a live the
adventure summit which we are doing
early January and it's only 20 minutes
from here so instead of me driving back
up to Surrey staying the night there and
then heading back down to this area and
early morning I thought it made a lot
more sense to stay here for the night
and meet Dave I think we're meeting at
like 10:30 so yeah it's gonna be good
it's gonna be a good day tomorrow we're
also meeting a guy after that who has
had some experience with land and
searching for land like woodland and
building buildings on woodland so yeah
we're gonna meet with him and chat
through plans for my tree houses and
then in the evening hopefully I'm gonna
get to test my hot tub on the
double-decker bus for the first time so
I'm really hoping happens right catch
you guys in the morning
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
