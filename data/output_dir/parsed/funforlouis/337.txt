good morning guys today on leaving Sri
Lanka Roy left this morning on a
different flight and I am late board
line by sitting in a lounge and my
ticket said boarding at 12:45 and then I
looked up the screen it's 12:30 and it
said final thought I'm heading there now
slowing the FATA London for a couple of
weeks it's been a it's been a pretty
cool adventure actually I really like
the Maldives and and that was relaxing
it's just what I needed I think before
this trip I was feeling really stressed
out my life and this is definitely
relaxed me
and when I got in the plane guys I've
got a very exciting announcement that's
going to involve you guys so stay tuned
well guys today is a pretty long travel
day so I thought I'd take advantage of
the time we have to announce a very
exciting competition a lot of you would
have seen that loads of youtubers are
taking part in a campaign called Stand
Up to Cancer people are doing all sorts
of things to raise money go towards
groundbreaking research to combat counts
up I don't know if you know that up to
50% of us will contract some form of
cancer in our lifetime so this is a
pretty important cause and I'd love you
guys to get involved so I've given some
thought to what I could do to raise
money and I've come up with a pretty
exciting plan basically the competition
I'm running has four runners-up and then
a main Prize winner and each runner-up
will get a hamper of amazing goodies a
Sony W X 500 pocket camera which has the
equivalent of over 700 mil optical zoom
a penny board a High Sierra backpack a
Gandhi's towel a live the adventure
t-shirt live the adventure hoodie and a
live the adventure tote bag and a signed
poster of one of my instagrams those are
the runners-up and the winner of the
competition gets all of those things and
an all-expenses-paid adventure for two
in the UK that our plan out is gonna be
crazy ending in a meal which I'll come
and join you at on the last day so
hopefully that's pretty exciting for you

do it so let's raise as much money as we
can together I love you guys
right I've arrived in London after an 11
hour flight that was a very productive
I've got lot of work done got like two
vlogs edited to work to my video to
buffer and
I still got the rest the evening nice I
managed to grab a little bit food and my
way out as well got a little wrap and
some cashew nuts and a little smoothie
fruity thing and I'm just waiting my
over now
home sweet home and it's chilly right so
back at my parents for a few days at
least I've got a wedding tomorrow which
I need to go find my seat for hopefully
I've got that somewhere maybe need my
drapes novels but while I was away I got
this package in the post
it's a rucksack and it's inside okay
as some of you may know GoPro released a
few products maybe three weeks ago every
month ago anyway I've got a feeling
there may be one or more in those
products they the GoPro Hero 5 this is
quite exciting because I think this is
waterproof and has a screen and reports
for pay 120 frames a second at 1080 it's
basically all the good things about all
the dope raised in one so this is what
the GoPro 5 looks like close-up fully
waterproof rounded edges it looks pretty
nice I should have really had this when
I was in the mold is but I'll definitely
take out do some test shoots for you in
the day maybe like over the weekend
where else we got
got a little what is this like oh I
think this is that tripod thing that you
can this
yeah yeah there you go so this is like a
tripod that it's like a selfie stick
thing and a tripod that's boom what and
I have a backpack now Skeeter thing this
is my problem I was on the fly Phillip
today and we got a little goodie bag of
like Twitter trees and I was like huh
I'm gonna take that bag and put my
toiletries in it because I don't know
it's poetry bag I travel all the time
but I always just throw my toothbrush in
like the top of my backpack and now I
have a toiletry bag and now I have a
GoPro bag specifically for GoPro stuff
sight I'm very excited and do Noel
Summer Slide about it's now I'm back in
the UK I can take my booster board out
for those spin let's do it
well tell you one thing guys it's
definitely not summer anymore when I was
here like two weeks ago it still felt
like summer but it's there
definitely autumns definitely kicking it
now it's almost filling my winter it's
not sure whether I can tell you that
I'm back that was very exhilarating and
yeah quite a good adrenaline rush
actually I have been reflecting a little
bit just since getting back off the
plane because I've been chilling for a
few hours this evening and I've realized
I feel 100% recharged and rested from
that trip away which was my full
intention if you remember on my way out
of sharing that was just feeling a bit
kind of anxious and stressed out with
different things anyway all of that is
gone it's like a cloud has lifted and
yeah I'm just feeling very excited about
life very energized and just a very got
a very clear head and I'd like to stay
that way I don't know if I will but I'll
try my best I find life kind of you
going ups and downs but I'm on that up
right now so I'll catch you tomorrow for
the wedding
it's I'm gonna just be sensitive because
it's obviously a private day for my
friends and they probably don't want
everything on YouTube but you know I'll
be ducking in and out and we'll see some
of the regulars Steve and babe and Mike
and stuff I'll catch you in the morning
peace out enjoy life Olivia venture big
