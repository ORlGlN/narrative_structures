so we've just got off the flight from
San Diego and I bumped into Carmen and
this is a really crazy story so like
five years ago when I was doing parties
of my boom bus I did her party and then
she's like eh you I think you are a
member like you're off YouTube but also
you did my party so that's really crazy
so and we didn't really realize until we
got off the plane
how's your flight yeah yeah

we're back in England now we've been
greeted by lovely bright brain that was
simple walked up to the luggage belt and
the first bag I saw coming around mine
so ready to find Steve now my phone died

these mountains these the boxes yes

meeting find the nomads means they've
just been chillin
because I'm like the zoning out today

battling three and I think I'm winning I
think I'm winning are we going out for
dinner now Lex is in the back and we're
gonna go meet with Jake as well and have
a very fun evening Steve wearing that
it's a cool restaurant it's a cool
restaurant I've got a corn on the cob
I'm entirely sure how hungry I am so I'm
just gonna start chilled and then see
what happens I like this guy it's all
about getting the bar
let's start whole rapid ribs
why did you have a good man stage
sweetie yeah I'm kind of too tired to
appreciate right now it's good it's
really good I'm back at Steve's so we've
got my laptop club going on I'm gonna
crash here tonight my parents are still
in France we don't see they're on their
way back I get back tomorrow it's been
another tiring day I'm gonna have to
sleep now and try catch up with some
well needed rest as I haven't really
done much today I thought I'd ask for
another few questions
are you guys have for me what is your
most crazy near-death experience a
Hummer weather share this with you guys
or not but Dave Erasmus you know Dave
will make Dave he actually saved my life
once I was swimming off the south coast
of England and it was really cold water
and I am loss of swimming I cramped up
and I started hyperventilating as well I
had just eaten and I'm not a great
swimmer anyway and I started getting
really dizzy in the water and I was like
Dave gave me like help and we managed to
swim to a boy and then I was holding on
to the boy and I was like dizzy and I
couldn't be see and I was just like oh
my I can't swim back and it was getting
bad and I was kind of like basically
passing out and Dave grabbed me swimming
ashore
I called onto the beach like vomited
like it was full-on my I think I had
like early stages of hypothermia as well
as mental so that was a pretty close to
death experience and Dave saved my life
if I had a lot of money what charity or
charities would I give to there's not
one specific charity that jumps out of
me but I remember going to this thing
one time where this guy was talking
about kind of the worthy causes in the
world of things that need to change in
order for the world to get you know be a
better place and what we should look
change and something that was like a
root cause of a lot of other problems
was like inequality and mistreatment of
women and there was this whole kind of
reasoning behind how a lot of other
things are caused by that so that really
struck me as like oh yeah like if we
could address some of those issues in
developing countries that could have
knocking affect a lot of other issues
that are going on so that kind of I
think that's the course that I'd get
behind one other question before I head
off not quite as deep what's my favorite
animal I've got to say my favorite
animals a lion because it's still kind
of the king of jungle beasts strong and
it's a symbolic bull so you know he's
just chilled he's just chilling out in a
Savannah in Africa he was just like oh
I'm just gonna sleep all day in the Sun
so I like that kind of mixture boy I'm
gonna get some sleep tomorrow I think
we're gonna need to rush off to get to
have like an embassy to get a visa for
somewhere and I mean we're mid Steven
made up with Ben and then we might even
meet up with Jack and Finn and Troy
later on who knows peace out enjoy life
and live the adventure
boom
