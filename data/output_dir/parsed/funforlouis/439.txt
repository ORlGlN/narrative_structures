good morning guys we have just arrived
in a tiny little town with Dylan on
quite some toffee and Lake breakfast and
then we are heading to a ghost town
nearby to do some exploration this is
literally like straight out of a movie
this place here we go here we go cheers
everyone
- another day Montana
how's everyone feeling today Vinny gets
I'm good now that I've got my coffee
where we going guys we've just stopped
forgive those puppies outside and Riya
needs to see the puppies
hello today moose and this one is
trouble
are you happy
cruising into the ghost town so we are
here in the bannack state park this is a
ghost town I don't know anything about
it so I guess we're gonna come find out
it's free it is pretty cold right now
wouldn't be a ghost town without a
creaky door
this town ain't big enough for the two
of us
probably gonna go and explore their
garden shed there's a cute little stream
running at the bottom check this out
that's it boy that's whip yeah yeah or a
bear
imagine having to obey these rules you
have to wear two clear coats your dress
must be must not be any sure than two
inches above the ankle you will not keep
company with men why I don't understand
why teachers can't marry you though
look at this staircase this is an ethics
there game did not many buildings in the
town on two floors imagine walking in
just seeing a little girl
this house
what's in here just a bar or barber's
the father's chair unless it's like an
electric Ellucian chair I think we
should venture further down into the
town I want to go into these some of
these back buildings up at the back
would you be depressed units now
I'm walking right to the edge of town
why I think these old tin cans that they
used to shoot target practice oh that is
cool it's very cool I love exploring I
kind of like exploring without knowing
exactly what I'm looking at either I
finally like to imagine okay guys I have
found the coolest thing what is this
like it's like a cowboy original cowboy
how about hot well that was a lot of fun
enjoy that no it's crazy we were just
talking about how strange it would have
been all the way back then it's being so
disconnected from like other societies
and you're kind of I guess there's a lot
of little towns that still exist like
this we're gonna try and find the girls
now it's actually freezing so I think
they've been cuddled up in them in the
van waiting for us oh yeah yes baby we
are now heading to a cowboy ranch where
we're gonna be staying for a few days my
hoping the weather's a little bit better
it's a few hours away tomorrow we're
gonna get to riding some horses we don't
have one

to drive thank you

heading on - what's the name of the
ranch we're going to

were supposed to be there
a few hours ago Blacktail lodge

ghost town stuff it's cool it's chill

going strong this has the worst weather
to deal with we're here

having I've ever been in look actual
logs we've turned the heater on in the
cabin it is super cozy in it but it's
quite chilly outside and I am really
looking forward to tomorrow guys because
