good afternoon guys I just had lunch my
parents house and I am driving to meet
my friend handy i've also grabbed some
of my things because i'll be staying
with andy for a few days and we're gonna
be celebrating New Year's together and
stuff so before we go to his house we've
decided to go out on a 4x4 experience at
Mercedes world in Weybridge we went on a
racetrack there I think last year if you
remember so yeah we're gonna go down for
an hour and I think he's basically
driving around the track and I'm just
gonna be a passenger and placing my life
in his hand so this would be pretty fun
the last time I did a 4x4 actually the
only time I've done but before before
thing was in Canada with JP if you
remember when we went on that Fairmont
Rhett so yeah it should be interesting
I wonder how slippery is gonna be
because it's pretty icy
even though it's really nice sunshiny
weather it's really frosty so it's like
that really bright and crispy kind of
weather right now so we'll see so if you
guys remember from my vlog a year or so
ago we did some track racing on this
track here
is this where it says to me
right this is the car and he's gonna be
driving so the best things the Opus make
you choose a little bit more Vincent as
amazed or not yeah we can see that since
the cost of this what angles that I
believe percentage-wise fairly
whoa nice I save I yeah oh my god
whoa I could feel it skinning her see
this OS is that 3234 for you 41% be fine
I wouldn't do this in my camper did you
sign the damage insurance will
well how do you - or now you don't
anything mother ended so this is our
high miss vehicles beam with the raised
suspension
it's pretty capable vehicle isn't it
that drivers better no not really
well that's a lot of fun we're now gonna
go and have a look around some of the
other cars maybe see if we can check out
a G Wagon so they've they've sent us
upstairs to check out this 152 grand GU
wagon
this is flashy yeah and I think it's a
bit flashy
oh yes and he's having a look at this GU
wagon
as it fell do these seats in the back go
flat fully not fully it doesn't go flush
flat it just goes like that yeah they
all come down but it'd be difficult if
you nicely they sunk in on it because
then you could out have a little bed in
the back it's pretty cozy
yes the main reason Andy wants a 4x4 is
to get to tow our boat and maybe put
some kayaks in the roof if we get a roof
rack I like the color all right so this
is Andy's current car it's not really
suitable for towing our boat I don't
know if he's gonna get a g-wagen but
we're gonna come back tomorrow and do a
little test drive a bit I really hope he
does I really hope he does
yeah what do you guys think do you think
it's do you think it's too flashy with
the GAR
what do you think it's pretty good I
think it's pretty good on anything it's
horrific ly flashy I think if you had a
chrome rap on it I would be happy the
team laughing boom just arrived at
Andy's house this is where I'm gonna be
staying for the next couple of days
before all over New Year's trip to
Oxford and it looks very nice this is my
favorite thing the hot tub which is
installed yet but hopefully very soon
very nice all brand new renovated and
he's just about to show me something
that happened today to his bath river
right
are you screwed the door back on yeah
today Andy had to saw his door in half
because the mirror oh my gosh the mirror
fell off the wall and jammed the door
closed or just jammed the closer then he
drew Scott was it a circular saw you
just oh my gosh and then on the whole
marriage shattered this is seriously
heavy
oh there bro you're lucky you weren't
sitting on the toilet we've come up with
this genius idea to try and sell his hot
tub won't be warm tonight but we might
get to get it hot tomorrow but we've
just realized there's a bunch of sand on
the here which they're still building
the they're still building the back
section with the decking and stuff so
we're gonna try I'm an optimist I'm an
Andy side
it's got me yeah that's right I'll tell
you like five minutes so we just have to
be Thor he heard the pipe here for the
tap managed to do it with oh wow it
literally looks like a snake
oh yeah Andy come look at our pet snake
all right it is almost fill up our said
it's a 42 degrees Celsius it's a 90 was
it another moment which we let it fill
up a bit more then
well it's 4:30 in the morning the hot
tub has ever so slightly got warm up
from 7 degrees Celsius to 10 degrees
Celsius which is not a lot but hopefully
by some point tomorrow it would have got
much much hotter I'm hoping 40 degrees
probably won't be till this evening
though I've been not working very hard
I've been doing some 360 video content
I'm gonna try and get back into that
guys yeah some sleep I'm very tired but
it's been a fun day and it's nice to be
staying with Andy for a bit this is
really nice hopefully this can be a bit
of a base for me back in the UK when I'm
here this is it's nice living with
friends muna and they've lived together
multiple times in the
past but it's been a long time say this
could be pretty nice anyway I'll catch
in the morning peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure
