good morning guys it's day two the live
the adventure Africa trip
I'm with Kyle and Britain who are taking
our vehicles the Jeep that we got from
wiggle and then the live the adventure
van that we branded up they're gonna
meet us in a Township called langar the
rest of the crew are jumping in this
tour bus and yeah we're doing a township
tour so we're going to learn a bit more
about the history of Cape Town and meet
some locals and just see some different
culture it's gonna be quite a contrast
from hello this side of town and where
we're staying but is there it's equally
as beautiful and yeah I think we're
gonna have an incredible morning because
it's gonna be nice here
the walking tour that we're gonna do
that we're doing 45 minutes to an hour
walk okay
whether to visit different status or
giving them like houses we're going to
visit ikeda garden like I'm gonna have
fun with the young ones so please guys
you see something with the township then
you wanna know about it
asking questions okay especially going
to happen you talking to someone
for them the social in acting
okay before we head to Langer
we've stopped off at maidens Cove which
is I think I stopped here the other day
with Kyle actually but these guys
probably haven't been down here yet so
again a few photos just a quick quick
stop just to really see this side of the
mountain before we head the other side
most the team you would have met in
yesterday's vlog so make sure you watch
yesterday's vlog but we've got two new
arrivals I'm gonna introduced you to now
that literally just flew in from the
States
guys can I introduce you in my vlog
quickly guys this is Nash and Taylor and
they have just done like 30 hours of
traveling right oh my gosh
straight off the plane and yeah heading
out for the day so it's good to have you
guys
as well it's evolving itself in a
training grass
I repeat as squirrel is rolling itself
in a green grass like plague in a green
France I guess you get that now in Costa
Mesa if our artistic architecture
Kolkata and country
I read it in physical people
greatest weapon in the hands of the
compressor is the mind of the compressed
that's what the government did in
disguise that's why they were sort of
like introducing busy existence so that
people like to check in color people
better than the black sort of a crime in
the country itself so that they can
think that they are better than the
blacks by doing so they were still
staring that gap in between they were
they were extending at a trade-in
so that's like given today you'll find
that people in South Africa they are
still separated or subjugated because
because it's right here in their minds
you don't that we are different we don't
be a lot who are you
we've arrived at the langa township and
we are going into this cultural center I
don't know if you remember that like
three years ago when I came here with my
friend Neelam we came to this Center on
one of the tours and had a look around
but there's kind of local artwork here
they're selling pottery and yeah do some
good things empowering the locals there
so it's cool to be bad they are doing
portal here so I'm like one of the
artists to elaborate and tell you more
about what are they doing how do they
benefit from what they are doing okay so
we just gonna go inside okay
time for coffee hey man thanks you can
make us some good coffee okay that's
good that's good news
this is Odin showing us some of his
artwork it's all um it's all done with
colored standards that were safe yeah
and then they become colorful you see
the colorful there yeah and then I put
the glue yeah and it makes this line and
just put the stand and then you spin
around
remember that the telescope now it's the
oldest town should be Decatur and this
is it's one of the time chips that was
too much affected by about 8 w and most
of the systems that were introduced
during the UH party time
and they happened quite a lot in this
Township this is where they had to get
their identity parties where to collect
them and the the oppressive government
at the time required anyone well I think
the black population to have a party to
go anywhere and there was a massive
restriction on movement and travel
around the country and it's kind of
crazy to think this is only like this
only ended like 25 years ago so it's
kind of mind-blowing
so one of the things Godfrey's explained
is that there's different levels of
housing in the townships and this
housing here is the hostels they call it
the hostels and if some of them are
pretty rundown 16 different feminists
instead of finding 16 men sharing so
which would mean that in a room which
was designed to accommodate three men
instead of finding three men with 93
families regardless of a number of each
feminine so the other tried to mention
instead with my twosome is instead of
that so there's no privacy it is a kind
of postal certificate
we've just arrived at like a
kindergarten and we're meeting a bunch
of cook okay local kids hello
so incredible they're even living in
like areas of kind of low income and
poverty like kids are just having
energies so positive I just love how
happy they are just by like the simple
things it's just like I think we can
learn something from kids be honest I
think we all need to learn something
just like pure it's just so pure did you
guys enjoy that
did you guys enjoy that yeah that's a
good fries in it just will halt we'll
make Sam what do you think of that
incredible seeing those kids smile and
play with us was really heartwarming
great way to start the day with a lot of
positivity they're just so awesome to
see you know so much energy and
positivity in a place like this where
people are a lot less fortunate
you don't get to do a lot of
and you know
are just barely making a buy as you can
see with the shops and everything if
they have going on but it was a really
really cool experience
to do for sure yeah yeah it it's pretty
hard did a lot a lot of stuff we've been
doing and the stuff we're going to be
doing this week it's kind of yeah it's
definitely kind of a sightseeing trip
we're seeing a lot of the the amazing
things paper town has to offer and the
beauty and luxury but it's good to see
the whole balance and see the whole
picture and realize this is a
complicated city a complicated country
we found a penguin already ok the tide
is pretty high through here we're going
through here to Narnia to find all the
Penguins that would have to leave my
cell bags here with and she's kindly
gonna look after them have you seen
penguins before in the wild
the tide has come so I'm kind of
shivering a little bit you made it
how's that we're gonna head off now
because we're gonna drive back home via
like chapman's peak which is the other
side of Table Mountain and it's gonna be
perfect for Golden Hour something's
gonna drop we could get pretty beautiful
sunset let's see how many drains we can
get off at the same time we've got the
inspire we've got yeah we need the
Maverick we need the Maverick Pryor in
the Maverick air yeah
okay guys we drive so you wanted to get
some drawing shots of the of the van and
as we tend to the corner we lost the
signal and bringe drones like miles up
above thankfully we didn't lose it gonna
come back down to get it shot all right
slow down let's wait for a sec is it
comment is it coming back good news guys
the Sun is popping through we're gonna
go down to this little cave
let's need to climb through the fence
everyone's a bit chilly so we're gonna
we're gonna go to the restaurant now

shared vibes yeah NASA's been doing some
white space trip I just got some
asparagus hummus how is it

really cool today guys I like the
variety of stuff with there's getting to
see it a bit of langar to meet some
locals living there and you know it's
like I said seeing the other side of
Cape Town I guess and then seeing a
classic spot which you need to do if you
haven't skate town which is going to see
pink gonna see the Penguins and yeah
we've got some great activities planned
for the next couple of days but yeah I
think just hanging out with these guys
and putting on this trip has been
amazing honestly I just I've wanted to
do this for a while and we've been
planning it for a while and I just think
it's the beginning of a whole new phase
of yeah hosting trips like this I'm
super passionate about it and so is Riya

influences and other destinations you
think we should do in the future

little bit and then I need to sleep

morning peace out
