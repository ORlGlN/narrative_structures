good morning guys
we had a pretty late one last night we
went down to hot water beach which is
right here and we dug a hole in the sand
and they got a little bit scared by the
hot water but we have poured a sense out
bed and some lunch right now this is a
nice little falafel wrap and I coffee
I'm not wait yet I'm almost away yes
guys literally sleeping as it's right
now right we are now heading to
cathedral cove which is quite nearby
it's about ten minutes away
try not to break everything in the back
of the campfire because all these roads
are really windy and every time I take
it cool and I can hear like everything
like shifting in the back which is very
pretty epic spot and apparently it's
24-hour parking so they can sleep here
which I think we should because check
out that view
but first what are you doing right now
pretty awesome - really tight parking
spot
are you doing good but it's a 45-minute
walk down to cathedral cove it's pretty
beautiful I'm not always a big fan of
walking but I have no complaints right
now this is just awesome and and we're
going to stay here tonight we've decided
we're gonna Park up at the top and maybe
even get up and watch the sunrise in the
morning I love this look at that Ridge
up there burns
I hope the stars are out again tonight
so I just realized I've been wearing
this vest in so many of my instagrams
and videos that it looks like I never
take it off
and the thing is I haven't washed it but
I just don't have that many desktops and
it's hot weather and stuff priority
we've arrived guys cathedral cove check
this out I came here two years ago if
you watch my New Zealand vlogs like
right and kind of near the start my
channel I came here I did a little like
kayak adventure and we got here but this
is like a Brighton of cliff faces this
massive tunnel that goes through to
another Beach anyway especially after
being in Malaysia to stay warm
I met some of my videos from Germany hi
guys
last time I was here I saw a stingray in
the water right here in the bay now I
was chasing it but it it ran away wait I
did run away it's far away pretty quick
come down on the beach we spotted this
little outcrop on this hill and we're
trying to walk down there so we can like
sit on the edge and can I look over both
sides we've reached the end check this
out
this is crazy
yo this is a little outcrop that I'm
sitting on and it's like an overhang and
it's made of super crumbly rock look
it's just crumbling apart my hands
that is ridiculous how does that make
you feel right I feel fine
yeah I kind of hate watching you do
these things
I think rise run away cause she's
annoyed because I'm being dangerous and
stuff I'm gonna stop now
I can't I can't watch Louie when he does
these things and he just like blatantly
risks his life that thing is literally
made of chalk and he's just okay I'm
just gonna just gonna walk this way
pretend that it's not happening so what
I have to deal with Louie your shorts
are completely white and that literally
does nothing that is the cliff we were
just hanging off the edge of
that peak there that's crazy
it's interesting their forests in New
Zealand because it's kind of like kind
of jungle II but then it's also you've
familiar to like a British forest or
something or like North America so many
movies have been done within New Zealand
and I can see why
just like magical so magical here isn't
it doesn't feel real cuz like what you
said it's just such a mix of jungle and
like what reused you
it's time for dinner we're racing down
to the town at the bottom of this hill
so we don't take too long
and lose the opportunity to get a space
at the top to sleep at night we're not
sure if it's gonna fill up weather a lot
you could go up there's a sleepover I'm
assuming they did let's get taken out
you managed to get some food just in
time and I ordered a little veggie
burger as well right things are whenever
to eat both but we'll see she's probably
right and then we've set up a little
table here and we're gonna watch an
episode of love
so I've set my camera up outside my
little rx100 doing a star lapse which
hopefully will go all night so if it
hasn't been stolen by someone you can
check that out now
right you'll see in the morning peace
out enjoy life live the adventure
