I am Katie and I'm Ruby we're from
England and you're watching
Louise good morning guys
I'm heading off in about half an hour to
the airport but before I do they're
having a little family breakfast and my
grandpa has come over to join us and my
dad has cooked up some wood we got there
dad
well you kids up holiday thank you
French toasty things and posix delicious
my breakfast done took a little coffee
as usual running a little bit late for
the airport I think I'll be fine because
I don't have to check in any bags
yeah still going I just need to check in
and it's pretty relaxed it's not very
busy right now she's good I just need to
prove I go an outgoing flight out at the
USO I can check in online unfortunately
I'm through security and already
regretting not bringing my penny board
on this trip my decision was because
it's bad weather in LA apparently
doesn't it I'll get to skate much there
but just found out my Gators gave b-36
which is a 15 minute walk should just
bring my penny board just for the
airports
it's cuz with life inside
oh you call me flying
this goes with die
you call me slide slide
you call me sly
this goes with light
this was worth flying and flying and
flying in flight because with flying and
flying and flying in flow
Brian London in LA about half six
million think you know I flew for like
11 hours descended three hours later
when I didn't know
I love the time differences I think I'm
going to go through customs and then I
need to catch the bus and go meet the
boys I just takes the wheel and they're
gonna wait for me to get dinner order an
uber and then these two guys came up to

in-and-out experience yeah you should be
like I don't wanna build out too much
