good afternoon guys it's day 7 the lives
the adventure Africa trip and this is
like our last day together really
because tomorrow's like a travel day all
day and yeah we've had another morning
of a kind of relaxation and catching up
with work and sleep and now we're
heading out on a game drive to find some
giraffes and some more cheaters
hopefully how's everyone feeling today
yeah yeah I so badly wants these
vehicles how you feeling Helen Aggie

into one cloth today see how that works
out
okay we found some troughs check it
gotta get that Instagram
okay so we're in two cars and Sam Jacob
Bryn and Kyle are in the car behind us
and they've kind of got lost I thought
this would be a good opportunity to get
cool a long shot of them arriving from
down the road so I'm just wandering over
trying to make the most of this 600ml
lens managed to get there meta bones
adapter working today I was having some
trouble with it yesterday oh yeah here
we go a landscape here guys so epic
especially with some of these kind of
moody clouds and stuff
Young is just up there trying to track
the Cheetahs
okay
Bryn's joined us for a little bit he's
in the tracker seat I think he's gonna
have a bumpy ride
and found the Cheetahs who's about to
walk over yesterday we saw a male
cheetah and my thing today is another
cub or two cubs these walking safaris
with predators now crazy like the only
other times I've done walking safaris in
the past Buddhists would like zebras and
antelope and stuff but this is and how
crazy is this oh my gosh it's gotta kill
my this noise is like six
what's he saying right first thought so
this is a mom for Cubs when you first
saw them they were like what how big are
they I never seen anything like this
before
not like Oh fried a cheetah
no they cook with the pride all family -
mother income yeah and the bangers Jacob
right here we just had a cheetah kill
now we're getting Sam ready
they're saying that that kill was very
fresh like probably happened as we drove
it in I think we might have started a
little herd of wildebeest or hartebeest
or something nothing there she is an apt
one say good to keep the tears not so
good for the wildebeest this is this is
the wild though guys this is nature
okay last shot of the day before we go
and shoot well before we gonna shoot
this beautiful bed they've got on the
side of the river for sunset we're gonna
try and rig up the GoPro fusion to the
DJI inspire so we can fly with so jumps
in the in the car with the boys and
we're gonna try and hunt down what hunts
probably not good work we're gonna try
and track down there too man
to shoot I mean to fill guys have just
jumped out with his there was a rhino
and it's baby just in the bushes here
let's record the testify just in case
something happens yeah let's at least
get 360 footage of the crash yeah
this is what's happening
I found some giraffe over here I'm so
intrigued to see how this looks like in
the 360
I think that's throwing the balance of
the inspiring men
glad I don't have minds with the
controller yeah this is crazy oh my god
the things you can only do this in
private reserves okay we've just arrived
at a magical location this is part of
the lodge and stuff it's called the star
bed and it's the bed that set up on the
riverbank and there's like lanterns
everywhere so we're gonna go check it
out get in the photos this is so awesome
we do have the option to stay here
tonight one of the couples but I don't
think anyone's gonna then we can just
head back to the manor where there's
electricity and stuff but I would be
down for this one
one night you'll be staying for longer
yeah okay there's a few mosquitoes there
is a few mosquitoes
yeah not really conception experience
and I was almost dreaming of meeting
everybody like this in a way to
collaborate see I use at the very
beginning this I wanted to see what
people are doing how they were doing it
because we had to figure it out on our
own and just kind of grow by ourselves
I've been on a lot of trips and a lot of
them are very surface level and I've
never really been on a trip like this
where people are so willing to just be
vulnerable and kind of dig deeper and it
was definitely a challenge for me but I
I loved it and I loved being around so
many inspiring people and connecting on
a deeper level and yeah I just you know
walking away from something like that
it's really refreshing for me and yeah
I'm just really grateful for the whole
experience being out here with everyone
and and getting to really kind of bond
more McCallum staying on a deeper level
I think is really cool we go on trips
with we've gone a couple group trips and
it's very like she said surface level
you guys just do your own thing but I
like that Riya kind of forced us like
deeper like when we started talking in
the van and like right I forget I think
you and I were talking here you're
talking to someone else but you know
booty was so tired and want to go to
sleep
and then you think I can't like miss out
on this and like everyone kind of woke
up then we all were talking and all that
so yeah I love that I was like the
genuine interest in each other and other
people's by I was like how we're all
trying to better ourselves or you know
how we can help each other in that way
the curing Taylor's story and like you
know like seeing I think I think that
really like inspired me because she like
really opened up and poured her heart
out to us and told her story and it was
like really crazy you know you never
think you you don't really know what
people have been through and like
hearing that really was like kind of
like a reality check for me it's like
you know you never really know what
people have been through and I'd love to
like fly more trips together and travel
around the world and also like stop like
thinking of ways that we could work
together to like you know do big things
and make an impact and you know whether
that's like a collaborative film project
we do together or something who knows
but I like taking over that box I was
worried that you know we were just walk
away with amazing content but now like
from the start of that meant from the
fire chat and other chats we found the
cars and stuff I definitely feel like
I'm walking away with a lot of new
friends I think because in our world
it's not very often that this kind of
thing happens I again I was kind of
worried if people would just kind of
reject it and feel uncomfortable but you
guys are so open and vulnerable and
especially around the fire that was feel
like that was like a really really
special moment so thank you for coming
into this with an open heart if being
around like-minded individuals seeing
what they do learning from what you guys
do it's really cool I definitely respect
all you guys for doing what you do and
yeah I'm just really happy to be a part
of it all I've been taking in so much
and I feel like this will like how to
put me into like a whole different
person
in the future because everybody was
missing like the depth and connection
we've got back for a lodge after such an
amazing night firstly having dinner out
in the middle of nowhere in the forest
and secondly just having just such nice
chats again I guess that's a big part of
what you guys probably haven't been
seeing from the vlogs over the last week
is kind of the the depth you know
obviously we've seen the activities
you've been up to and funny little
moments but yeah trust me it's being
deep it's been really cool and yeah I
feel like I've made some great friends
and I'm excited about the future and
future trips let me know guys who you
think we get include in future trips
comment below and also I guess maybe
some social good projects and some trips
focused on particular causes that we
could organize we did try last year to
do one around the deforestation in
Borneo and the kind of the orangutangs
out there and you know the problems
there with all the palm oil plantations
and all that I still love to do that and
go document that but yeah let me know
below there's there's other things you
think would be really cool for a bunch
of influences to go and do and yeah
tomorrow we've got a full day of driving
and then people are starting to kind of
head off and head their separate ways
it's a bit sad but yeah it's been good
and I'll catch you guys in the morning
oh one last thing guys do check everyone
out there's been on the trip obviously
I've been linking them the whole time
but it's worth heading over and checking
out their instagrams or those some of
those who have YouTube and yeah
show him some love
all right peace out enjoy life and live
the adventure
