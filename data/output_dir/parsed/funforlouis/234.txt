hey guys my name is Charlie and you're
watching fun for Louis enjoy the video
and peace out good morning guys
a beautiful day in Palm Springs we are
in the center of town to get breakfast
before we head back to LA we were
planning on going for a bike ride this
morning but unfortunately there weren't
any bike to briar to rent from the place
where you're at so we're just going to
go chriskate set off breakfast guys I
found a winner with a coffee to fit go
good
I don't like a incredible earnest coffee
guys Palm Springs
if you'll hear check out how beautiful
is the weather today I love all the time
yeah it's so close it's kind of weird
because it is like there's a lot of
older people it's more of a kind of
retirement place but it's just super
chill and it's like feels like we're
just a little little oasis in the middle
of the desert well I can show you
finishing around in longer here but we
have to go now but like a two-hour drive
back
I think maybe the way this improves a
bit that I think is it sunny planet
actually I think we managed to avoid the
last of the rain first week you guys
ever seen this many went to survive
there's like hundreds of us
so happy
everything has money no I mean no this
like inspired going here and it's a
patented result it is really with me
yeah I like some temporary in this life
is like hard to drive down a judoka
guide like Haskell over because look up
scenic vistas struggling with right of
this mountain we have to come back we
have come back were double a trajectory
just the like hang on it is it
without a minor problem lately I loved
my fourth year as an informative
transmission by with cruising point
instead and then I tried losing power
loading down and then descending outside
backfiring we had no idea what horses
that and then I open up the engine and
look at their this FloorMate I was down
here it was like rubbing on this wheel
that's it so I don't know whether that
was like stopping it right like might be
okay ready Bingham I believe in the
damage oh I'm so proud of you he picks a
specific little against the sword comin
from
Oh
okay we managed to make it probably
another 20 miles
but because I'm going fast in a lower
gear so I'm going into third yeah look
it's just pushing the engine too hard so
it's kind of overheating I'm hoping it's
not doing any permanent damage I think
it's just um yeah I just need to cool
down a little bit please this is
frustrating but you know these things
happen when you're driving an old
vehicle it's kind of part and package of
having the nostalgic spun vibes as an
old classic number man guys check this
out this it's happened again
look the starter motor is falling off
here like wiggle free and pulling into
there again it's a serious problem I
think that's what caused the the car to
stop again right I'm just finding this
fault here and hoping then that'll fix
it and we're going to fly off again
all right let's do that does the trick
come on baby
if anything is I know nothing about
mechanics I guess you've run over the
father really badly we got it was
Brian's anima
I can tell you about
oh thank you
okay guys I am back in Venice we made it
back the wonder bug might need a little
bit of work but she made it back I am
now heading out I have met with you guys
from DG IV the drone guy Jason and Cody
we're going to go and try out the
Maverick and maybe this under full Pro
this is this is Jason he's on another
electric skateboard with this the
evolved board okay so we're going to
cruise down hopefully we're going to
find somewhere to try and do some drone
tracking whilst we're cruising along
there the boardwalk at the front and
it's perfect time because it's cold an
hour right now so I'm going to put my
helmet on a beep
no windy it's pretty windy guide but
we'll see putting them at me to the test
I think we'll do all right yeah okay
we're putting this feature to the test
is the active track features though
hopefully as I'm boarding it all follow
me which is what I'd like to see you
guys okay from my own rather than have a
stroll around the movie
so is that automated yeah I didn't find
anything aren't you really good mama
yeah yeah yeah keeps you marked on the
side yeah nice yeah that's the coolest
shot and it's just tracking you behind
right within the the mavica way and then
have a little go the the new fan of for
price I was going to try a headline and
you go what time high
oh yeah that must be us right there
thank you yes that after that right this
later and it's not a seagull
I would say goodbye to this GGI guys
have to get my hands on a maverick see
we are now heading out to dinner you

chili you are you doing okay Laura in
Canada blue okay let's get let's get at
home
we're back from dinner being another
Sunday I really enjoyed playing with
those drones today I think I missed
flying a drone I can't believe I almost
crashed it into the sea oh my gosh but
yeah there's some up-and-coming trips
that III need to do some growing stuff
for because it's just going to be too
epic not to say on the try and get
maverick and we might be able to get a
little annum for pro as well but they
definitely got me hurt today I can't
wait to play with those a little bit
more there was a bit of a bummer today
though with the Wonder bug so I'm hoping
we can get that sort is because I just
want to do all the road trips of Thank
You Raya I just want to like take a
couple of weeks just to explore with
nowhere plans just cruise around and
kind of rough it well just like camp out
and you know wash and waterfalls and
hiking the woods and stuff like I'm just
craving that kind of off-the-grid kind
of real rustic adventure missing those
kind of vibes so hopefully we get that
all sorted and ready for the next few
months
better than that yeah I'm feeling happy
and feeling like the Palm Springs
Breakers needed and yeah good vibes good
California vibes catching the morning
peace out enjoy life Olivia's venture
