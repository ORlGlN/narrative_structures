hey guys I'm Molly I'm Francesca and
we're from sorry
you're watching vample only enjoy boom
good afternoon guys I'm taking a little
stroll through Brooklyn with Rachel
we're gonna go get some lunch we've had
a productive morning doing some work
after lunch we're gonna head into
Manhattan we found somewhere guys a
laugh oh that's all getting spicy
flatter and lentil soup you feeling
today right you still good like
we can get a copy of that
so the fitness and very important that
go in consolidation for anything
so the reason we've come into Manhattan
is because basically next weekend is
buffer festival in Toronto and nickel
and who are currently in South Africa
wanting to come but they need some kind
of Canadian visa which apparently takes
three weeks to process
from Cape Town but lost on nickels in
America or lost move into Canada who
said he managed to do it in one day from
the Canadian embassy in LA or something
so what we got to do before they fly out
to New York to join us we're gonna see
if the Canadian embassy will let make a
manager process the Canadian visa in one
day and in which case then they can come
over here and it's all it's all good we
don't really know whether they are going
to let us in or chat
yeah we're like yeah we'll the way
this is where we need to go maydianne
consulate-general
these is an immigration says it's closed
you must go to the address below for any
visa 290 Madison Avenue between 40th and
41st Street there's no way you've seen a
visa be processed faster than 14 days
I'm just amazed as you may have
overheard the security guard saying fix
the Leafs 14 days to process but we're
gonna try this number and maybe try this
again to this address to see if we can
persuade up but before I play this
Rachel noticed how badly spelled this is
right
Tuesday's to Thursday's thank you man
Ackerman stay in school kids I'm I know
I'm not the best at spelling we're gonna
pop in and get Rachel the SIM card how
much have you spent on data in the
state's already
she's always felt like $100 already like
always get forward
we're taking a little stroll through
Bryant Park to this other Canadian
Caesar place
I wonder what they're doing at Bryant
Park let's cut this out they're just
taking all the grass away and they're
just covered in the sand what are they
doing maybe they're preparing for the
ice cream I think that's it
okay this is bad news guys
it's breaking everything Matt if the bad
news maybe don't set off the fire hose I
don't know it guys
I don't know worthy I'm just gonna put
that there that looks right way the bad
news is actually they said it's like the
30 days to process this visa which is
longer than the other guy told us make
it they gave me an edge inform but he's
like even if it's like sped up it's
still 15 day process so I'm very
confused and things are looking hopeful
for Nick and Adam to come into Canada
but we'll make some more inquiries
thanks Shane come on Canada guys we just
met this girl Melissa and she ran out of
the coffee shop she recognized me she's
invited us in for a coffee this is so
nice in here I actually looked like
just gave us free coffee and a little
vegan cookie thing
I love meeting ideas and the Ranger just
told me she's never seen the Empire
State Building for what do you think any
Soto is now turning at the top of that
since we're here in Manhattan and
there's lots of shots of aspiration to
help me pick out new sweater
it's getting a little bit chilly earlier
and there's going to be even colder so
either need a new square or a little
jacket
what do you think guys
why do you picked me this ultra
fashionable jacket
because most of time I'm not in cold
places so there's no point we carry
around the coke thing yeah but this is
this how small it goes yeah I pretty
much just fit on the board in my hand
guys look at this I picked this out
myself this is a green jumper is it a
jumper where is it a cardigan I don't
know what it is but it's like made of
this really awesome wooly stuff that
feels so fluffy Kashmir
is so soft rachel is so soft July my new
clothes guys got this cashmere jumper
thing I'm gonna look after your eyes
quite expensive but it's so comfortable
and so warm and this which if it's
cheaper bar
good purchases should blast me and
definitely over the next month when I'm
gonna be in slightly colder climates
