let's go home so something that is quite
special about that little riders that
Icelandic horses she's saying maybe
Mongolian horses as well but they have
an extra gate like speed to the other
horses can't ride out which is called
halting so I think from what I
understand I think that's what is called
I think from what I understand you've
got the trot then you've got the tolt
and then you've got the canter and then
there's other ones like gallop and made
it another one I missing but it's like
very unique only with these horses so
