hi everybody I'm from Calgary in
Sardinia and you're watching family
though good morning guys it's just gone
for 30 and it's still dark but I am
heading now to meet back up with Raya
and we're going over the bridge to New
Jersey
towards the sunrise over the cityscape
of New York of Manhattan
oh and I'll tell you why when we get
there yes
Hey good morning you ready
sunrise nice little empty Times Square
is guys check this out what
so the reason I go out for sunrise this
morning is that up and go sent me some
of their breakfast drinks and challenged
me to do their dorm breakers challenge
which was to find the coolest spot in
New York towards sunrise so I enlisted
Rhys help she did some research and
found this location how I think is that
so this whole challenge was to raise
awareness for the Dawnbreaker
scholarship scheme that doesn't go
running and their whole thing is having
breakfast on the go and making the most
of your mornings now a lot of you often
ask me how can you fund your adventures
well this is a brilliant opportunity
because you can submit your ideas and
they will pick the coolest morning
adventure idea and help fund it so on
the link everything below in the
description and hopefully you can have
some pretty epic adventures is this your
first time in a long board writer yeah
are you funny yet okay kind of scary
we're gonna jump on this ferry back to
Manhattan actually quick in the Ganga
neva thank you
so that ferry ride is only like ten
minutes and for those who don't know the
geography of New York basically we just
spent the morning in New Jersey which is
a completely different state how
beautiful is that morning yeah so for
those of you that want to go to that
location to watch the sunrise
it was here 13 pier 13 in Hoboken New
Jersey that's where we were so I highly
recommend it if you can get up that
early in the morning I highly recommend
it
well guys we had to jump on the bikes I
can't believe I be there like four five
days and I haven't been on a bike yet
it's ridiculous
so good these are like identical to the
London bikes get up that 44 litre back
guys ride to show me a cool jazz joint
down the road that has has stuff
happening all week so I'm gonna take my
mum here it's like big big band jazz so
the girls have headed off on a girly day
and me and Nick I'm hanging out we're
gonna go and have some laps of club find
a cool place to chill get some coffee
and then we're heading bats bah and Nick
it's very exciting it's gonna be okay in
the 5d clamp from is upgrading this
cameras his camera is lenses and all
that and then hopefully we'll get some
sick photos guys you just watch

how's your morning be I feeling that
what you doing it CrossFit up early
watch this
upload I'm loading this is like a
gigabyte file guys
imagine overhead in snow as fast the
world would be a better place
that is ridiculous
okay
things done I know III man my head into
the camera store actually so much--but
on a taxi Nick explain your dilemma what
you decide you decide between the sony
a7s and the market D of 5d mark 3
but it's a very difficult one because a
very lot of online about it and they're
very conflicting opinions and people are
very
polarized on the topic so decision
chapter one of these guys made a
decision
basically Sony a7r Mark who's coming out
the end of the month early it's gonna be
much better than the internal 4k video
120 frames a second at 1080 and 40 was
it to make forty to forty two megapixel
camera so no growing up so we can
probably go together in LA and we're
going to sushi time sushi has arrived
yes yes bro what'd you get that definite
chicken teriyaki bro yeah pretty happy
that do you think we go on a sushi day
funny funny right sushi done we're now
gonna see if we can catch the last bit
of sunset but it's looking looking
unlikely I think Steve Melanie man
we should walk down that way it's the
weekend
yeah
yeah
I think it's going to cloud
so it might be tomorrow it might be
tomorrow guys that we check out the
sunset guys basically is today and
tomorrow
the Sun is in line with the like the
grid of New York so as the Sun sets you
can look down the road and it will just
like dip down like right at the end of
the road so hopefully tomorrow we'll get
some pretty sick pictures probably just
jumped in and over and we're all heading
to get an hour Thai massage which I've
been thinking about for days now and we
finally organized okay
you ready for this guy's
the
guys just come out of massage hands down

that's the big thing going for me
because I get quite a lot my soldiers
