Verona and we're seeing that for
breakfast - in this morning - food has
arrived first and that they didn't have
anything breakfast in the menu so we're
kind of its kind of lunch I guess

having an awesome Italian lunch and
there's a strange man brushing his teeth
in the street so the plan today guys is
that booking.com
is sending us on an adventure and I have
no idea where we're going they tweeted
me a riddle this morning when we eaten
breakfast and a few of you guys helped
me solve it and all I know is we're
heading to a place with 52 tunnels just
like north of Verona and then I don't
know where we go from there so I'm going
to try to eat and find out the next clue
we are stopping up for ice cream
and maybe by Canuck it makes me quite a
squirrel or great hungry
got my company ready to roll

Italy random we were planning to meet
somewhere and they were just like
driving around what amazing hello

it so we're not gonna go any further
we're gonna either do a detour to find
this place or I think I might tweet come

so next them the treasure hunt or
wherever this is this mysterious journey
we're going on let guys be high the bees
shooting their friendly let's go meet

though
we've got a new direction to head in I
don't know really where we're going but
I'm kind of gonna follow in that song I
like these kind of like we're having
this conversation I just found out
that's amazing facts about Ange because
we're having this like you're doing
these questions to each other to find
more out about each other and I was just
shocked and amazed to find out that Ange
is a drama she can play the drums like a
professional drama drama
so next time we see the drumkit I'm
gonna get and so we've arrived in this
little town and guys this is the most
picturesque drive I've ever done in my
life
