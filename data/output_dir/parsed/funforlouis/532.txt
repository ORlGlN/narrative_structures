good morning guys today is a very
special day we've woken up early to come
down to an elephant orphanage where
we're going to get to visit some baby
elephants and I haven't told Raya
there's a bit for surprise
I'm actually going to be adopting a baby
elephant for her cuz elephants are one
of their favorite animals so I think
we're going to meet the little baby
we're gonna adopt hello Louie Kirstie
thank you coming down early yeah thanks
for letting us come down a strict
feeding schedule so 9 o'clock and then
we feed them again at 11:00 Titanic and
TM appliances come on how you feeling
this morning the ones excited yeah and
tired but the excitement stakin are you
ready to meet some elephants definitely
yeah
it is important to note that you should
not scream and shout because that makes
and getaway indicted and not to spook
you all in the air is too close to you
cause if you do that someone could come
around as well somebody are I interrupt
while the female is a lot of fish around
for the run by women don't you've no
basis and that's why red is guys the
first elephants have arrived it's crazy
I've never seen an elephant this small
it's so excited how amazing is this
right
you know one of the most friendly yeah
have a look Oh Maisie hey hello this is
this is like the most incredible animal
interaction ever had
so I haven't told you I this yeah but
we're adopting this independent yeah I'm
gonna up to speed
listen under came and run up to do we
get to like fun it's
Oh someone with the duck do that alright
you happy Roya yeah hey doctor it's
uncle nowand so we were just learning a
little bit about how it works here and
the babies basically have come from all
over and Kenya from different situations
like their parents have been poached or
you know there's been some incident and
they're raised here for a little bit and
they are the whole aim is to get back
into the wild so the race is a little
bit and then they're taken to another
park where they're slowly reintroduced
into wild herds and those wild herds
will hopefully adopt them in and then
teach them about how to be a wild
elephant and then they're released fully
wild so yeah it's incredible
it's so amazing that we get the chance
to interact with them here and play with
them stuff see you later
I'm so sad I know I love them all so
much
they're an awesome little herd of
elephants like a miniature herd of
elephants which is filling in the
adoption papers in your pack you get
lost a certificate and a little leaflet
on and doctor and about his rescue and
his meal is basically pictures so the
elephant's have John back into the bush
to play to the back and we're going to
go and meet a rhino called Maxwell he's
unfortunately been blinded so he's never
going to be released into the wild so
they just look after him here yes bro
Wow oh my gosh you know we feed it
system I know just stuff yeah oh my gosh
this is crazy
so Kirsty works here and we've just been
having a chat about elephants and I've
ridden elephants before and once when I
was in Thailand and once in America I
think like two years ago but she was
just explaining that that's not
necessarily good things like elephants
in the entertainment industry and they
have to go through stuff to like get to
that place I don't know if you want to
share with it without like the
researchers in that norm well we could
we can't endorse elephant riding because
in order to do that you need to break an
elephant spirit yeah in order to train
it in order to be able to ride it and
that others ride it as you've been
seeing this morning they're such
emotional they have such characters
they're quite a spiritual animal and to
break that spirit is what you need to do
in order to ride it so guys if you're
thinking about riding an elephant if
you're traveling maybe dine maybe don't
do that and I'm not going to again and I
think I think part of its just being
educated and learning about good
practices and what's good for the
animals and I think I was a bit
oblivious like I haven't done the
research so I'm telling you guys I'm
helping you don't do it so guys if you
want to support the elephant's here as
well I'm going to link details below of
how you can adopt one and they'll email
you like it's Story and photos and
updates stuff and yeah and then that
will fund it being raised and released
back into the world which is a beautiful
thing let's go
so we're now heading to the masai mara
where we're going to be staying in a
lodge right in the park and we're about
to meet the owner now before we head off
with your skin directions so my thinking
is that I'm just worried about the
painting because just asking how long do
you think you'll get want to get there
we're just chatting about safari and
other you guys are right down this
little guy to see we're with it would
work great I know so we've got
directions to the camp tonight and we're
going to be cutting it fine you need to
get up before the Sun sets so we quickly
