cutest little house you can pretty much
like live here without having to go to
the shop it's trade with each other so
someone has like a territory
so not everyone has to grow
we're going on a little stroll around
the village now I'm glad it's a little
bit cooler today it was sweltering
yesterday but it's nice now this is so
beautiful it reminds me a little bit of
some of the towns are being - in Romania
this feels a bit more familiar
guys I think they son an abandoned
church building check this out
it's kind of old dilapidated is like
smashed windows that little spies like
about fall off I love all these whales
everywhere
no you just bring the water up like this
but I know they've got like mains water
as well like plumbing stuff they got
like normal taps as well okay

delicious lunch and so exciting to eat
healthy like that awaking French

we're leaving the village now we're
heading back to the town that we stayed
in last night it's been a really nice
day so far
so glad you got to eat food open to you
about simsimi yeah it makes a lot of
sense now and wire is traveling she's
like this food just doesn't cut it
we're going for another little walk in
the town I think all of this walking
that we're doing is pretty essential
workers when we're not walking we're
just eating so we've been like snacking
all day eating fruit and I haven't felt
like any emptiness my stomach for like
two days now just completely fall
constantly which is good I need to
stretch my stomach out a bit and also
all day this is what I've been hearing
all day don't know what's going on my
name is Matt and usually implicit
everybody forgot that woman above the
listeners I best buzzer again rise
grandma doesn't speak okay any English
I've just had to have small bits of
conversation that's translated but most
of the time they're just having their
own little conversation which is fine
that leaves me a little bit I'm confused
riah where are we arriving
yeah so the whole city's come down and
barks and they're like tenderizing so I
forget been here yet no your tickets we
had some very very interesting singing
going on these are the colors of the
Bulgarian flag red green and white
I really want to go on one of the ride
but I think I'm about ten times too big
and there anyway Pangos
all about the rollercoaster it looks
like a kids roller coaster what about
this this train thing here
this is traditional Bulgarian music and
briars grandmas is part of the group
like this so I haven't heard of sing yet
but I think it's similar
my
ah
I think this is an acquired taste I
think interesting how do you like it
sacrum
yeah this is like a karaoke
okay that is nice to see some Bulgarian
culture
I'll be out physical The Bling is
amazing so we walked past this bench
last night check this out it's literally
the biggest bench in the world and me
and Raya gonna climb up onto it okay
it's just your size wait that's the
first time you've ever been too small
for something this is the best thing
ever
can we have giant sanity we're trying to
find some forest and have our treehouses
yeah and we can feel like what they call
what are the family the borrowers the
borrower's I don't know that is guys
remember the borrower's I know tiny
people and that everything is big in
their house like cotton rails with their
tables and stuff no symbols that sounds
awesome my feet don't even touch the
ground
this is fun thank you thank ya Raya how
are you gonna get down girl took it man
all right can you talk us through the
dishes they do grandma's prepared so
this is peppers and eggplant are
aubergine she's like great tomato sauce
for that I made with her Tomatoes the
same tomatoes we were in for lunch I
don't know why I said tomatoes then
these are I don't know what the word is
in English but they're basically what's
the word in Bulgarian so me
they're basically wrapped cabbage leaves
with rice and veg and stuff inside you
got another salad of the incredible
vegetable garden and then this is what
compote and these cherries yeah soaks in
water and a little bit of sugar and then
in a jar like real juice actually it's
pretty amazing
I basically love Bulgarian food is the
best well it's been a pretty awesome day
spending time with Rhys grandma in a
house here in the town going and
checking out a village house getting to
taste so much good Bulgarian food and
yeah just having a little glimpse into
life here in this town which I can't
