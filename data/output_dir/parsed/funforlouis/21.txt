good morning guys is another beautiful
day in Cape Town we have quite a cool
day plan today basically we are teaming
up with an organization called African
impact and we're heading into one of the
townships or communities and yeah seeing
one of the projects they're running
there so you're about to head off with
the volunteers
okay guys we have arrived in a Township
called pi Lita and I am here with this
is Olivia this is Liz and this is sandy
who drove us here and my lecture is the
biggest Township in Cape Town I think
there's like 2.2 million people living
here
the only other bigger Township in South
Africa is sureto in new Janice Bay and
we've just arrived at this place some
Sun where Billy save some knobby lay
this is a like a play school and we're
gonna be hanging out and seeing this
project we have just met new Monday who
runs this children's kind of play center
and she was talking about how she's
fostering a number of kids that have
been abandoned as babies and through
difficult kind of family situations and
yeah it's just very powerful to hear
what she's doing here
you can see this she's very passionate
about it and yeah we're just looking
around this little building and seeing
what's happening they're doing she's
saying they also host like little
after-school study sessions for the high
school nearby and yeah she's just an
amazing person and it's so cool that
African impact has partnered with her to
serve this community and to
Oh
Lancia Noir sound very similar sounds
different so we've been playing some
games and now we're doing this really
cool exercise where the kids are cutting
out words about themselves like positive
words out this magazine is sticking them
on these CDs like mirrors so you're kind
of looking back and it's kind of
representing who you are
okay we we started doing clapping
rhythms and now we're gonna turn the
whole classroom into a dance boy shows
your best dancing best dancing
had enough thank you ma'am
okay guys we have just arrived at lions
head and we're gonna hike up hope
hoping to catch sunset but we might not
we're back here with Alex and friend UJ
and yeah I haven't been exercising at
all yet we've got tomorrow we've got a
first personal trainer appointment which
it's quite a privileged position to have
a personal trainer but I think I need
that to get me in the routine anyway I
think I'm gonna be sore after this hike
and then after exercising for the first
time in months
tomorrow I'm already out of breath this
is embarrassing
yeah that is nice guys I probably
mentioned this a million times but the
Sun sets and Cape Town are in my eyes
pretty unbeatable so we're just gonna
enjoy the Sun for a bit we might make up
in time yeah we've got we're getting top
of that yeah what time's the sunset and
it's gonna be very dark we're coming
back down so I brought some
that's gonna be the interesting part
yeah
we've still got a long way to go we're
just about to leave the sunshine and
head around this corner and like I said
we might not make it to the top and time
but this is still epic can't believe
this is the first time I'm doing this
you
okay I've seen the first signs then use
ladders chains and staples at your own
risk so I think it's going to become a
bit more of a crime than a hike at this
point but I'm ready I'm actually
surprised I'm feeling less out of breath
than I thought would be our first step
on the ladder that was such a fail guys
I am useless I think so cool guys check
out this view the clouds are rolling in
Oh looks amazing okay there's a pretty
constant stream of people coming down so
it's gonna take a while for us to get to
the top but I'm trying to find a little
side route to scurry up the side so I
don't need the ladders and stuff I was
just thinking us arriving at the summit
after sunset kind of sums me up really
like there's no way well it's gonna be
very rare that I'd do this for sunrise
maybe I'll do it at once I'm often a big
fan of sunset missions but knowing me as
well I can't even do those properly and
I often miss the sunset because my
punctuality isn't perfect I think that's
not ways a bad thing putting cases like
this would have been pretty cool to see
the sunset probably oh well there's
always more opportunities to climb up
again
we made it yeah
and those Instagram shots topping up our
Instagram bank we've needed to
yeah we've been inside in our apartment
for most of last week's I haven't got
many instagrams yeah
it's mad innit I know this isn't even a
big city compared to some of the
metropolis of the world it's cool seeing
it on the light as a backdrop to like an
amazing mountain kind of thing this is
such a good spot right we are heading
back down
yeah it's pitch black but we have we
have torches so it's good I can imagine
people have serious accidents coming
back there
all right it is dinnertime we have
worked up an appetite for sure
guys we just got sitting at like the
best table here so it's out this is this
is really really nice yeah this is like
a magical kind of fairy garden we have
actually been here before when we came
before we had that table inside but this
is this is an awesome table eart check
it guys Mimi's shown up it's so good I
start as arrived I've got some tomato
soup this big steak I completely forgot
to vlog like main course but the the
desserts come out we're just sharing
this chocolate program we're having very
big courses we are we all have right
back home guys it's been an amazing day
it was so good to go see the projects
entirely teacher and it was so good to
get up lions head I can't believe it's
my first time and then such good chats
over dinner I'm buzzing and I'm really
thriving here guys I just want you to

feeling very alive and very rested I'm
looking after myself and something
