good morning guys we are in Calumet I
think that's how you pronounce it in
northern Canada we arrived late last
night we can get out of the airport we
had have a bit of fiasco and
unfortunately we're gonna have to head
out first thing today so we didn't get
to explore the area but it is pretty
fascinating here it seems like a bit of
a melting pot for people from all around
the world coming here to kind of work
for different things but yeah we're
heading to Greenland today yeah I'm
super pumped I've never been to bring
him before so this is kind of hilarious
we don't know how to get to a plane we
had the same problem last night we
didn't have to get through the terminal
or out of the airport so we were trapped
outside for like 45 minutes in the cold
and now all the security guards like
yeah I don't know how you get to the FBI
where the planes waiting so he's gone to
find out what are the most fascinating
things about this place guys is the the
written language I think correct me if
I'm wrong but I think this is Inuit but
look how beautiful that written
languages it's amazing
we're just heading over to fuel up and
to drive down to the other end of the we
need to taxi down together so the next
leg we're flying today is over to
Greenland to Nick on the west coast and
this is probably the riskiest flight
we've done yet which is why we're
putting on the dry immersion suits like
we did yesterday
they're like full suits that if we do
land in the sea we can get out without
freezing to death so we're gonna have to
wear those throughout the flight and
have the raft the inflatable raft with
us as well so we just quickly grab and
get on the plane if we need to I've laid
out all the foods here this is mats
Louise and mine problem with mine is
it's not it offers me no text arity in
my hands so I might need to get Matt to
do the takeoff out of here and then once
we're in cruise all I'll consider maybe
just take my arms out of the suit so I
can do something at least
but yeah the weather's great over here
I'm not sure what its gonna be like over
there we should get into nuke we wanted
to go to our sauce walk or something
today that's not happening and nuke is
kind of a better place soot to really
get to see Greenland so
yeah but nervous
and
isn't how would I say it isn't a normal
flight there's a lot of risk involved
I'm gonna continue my pre-flight now do
everything as thoroughly as I can
and should go out the entrance running
great
no complaints
so one of the questions we've been
asking people out here is why are they
living out here so remotely so
disconnected from the rest of the
country and everyone's saying that the
money you can earn out here is
incredible like even the security guard
here was saying that he's earning
between 150 and 200 thousand Canadian
dollars a year I think he's doing a few
different jobs but from what I can
gather is something to do with the the
government a Canadian government is
subsidizing a lot of costs out here to
keep towns out this remote in the north
apparently this is what the guy said
anyway to to make sure that Russia don't
take over the Arctic which sounds crazy
to me but maybe that was the original
reason why they set up towns out here
but yeah this is kind of baffling JP how
many gallons can be held in total in the
plane there 129 usable 132 onboard but
only 129 we can actually use and what's
the legal amount you want to have weigh
in when you learned well the legal
amount is 45 minutes well to an
alternate plus 45 minutes but that's
beyond my comfort zone i i prefer
learning with as much reserve as
possible so today today we're gonna land
with about five hours of reserve which
is what we kind of need because if we if
we get there and it's below minimums we
need to come back here so
yeah I'm comfortable with today's flight
in terms of reserve I'm not comfortable
in terms of the terrain we need to fly
over it's frightening if you saw
yesterday's video we actually saw a few
icebergs as we were flying in just
flowing out and see which was kind of
amazing
also something different we're doing
today is we Matt's attaching a camera a
GoPro on the tail of the plane so we
should get this really epic shot looking
kind of over the top of the plane where
we're heading
guys can you see the angle we've gotten
there and the plane how epic is that so
you had to buy the fuel by the barrel
and we just filled the plane with two
barrels of faff gas that's crazy isn't
it two whole barrels are in that plane
okay time to get the suit back on
hopefully I don't punch myself in the
face like I did yesterday when I put in
a zipper up
because the water is literally right
there as we take off we we have to take
off Fuli zips up with our everything
like look at my hands the suits are
fully ready it just makes it more
difficult to do anything yeah yeah
where we going back to the stomach I
think you did you do this silly is
considerably cooler than ours
yeah this is the first real overwater
leg last night we got a little bit of a
taste but today we're seeing actual
icebergs gonna be out over the ocean for
like three hours so it's really sweet
bit of a problem guys we can't find the
key anywhere which means we aren't going
anywhere until we do we found the key
where was it JP in here
I advise that since no warming up
crossed my hangers or it looks like they
got something hanging off the pilots
door there she filter some packet okay
thanks
Louie you strap was hanging out of the
door okay Radio November 2 1 0 after

good we're getting a good time right
today oh it's nice and cold up here
yeah most bizarre terrain I've ever seen
it's kind of funny because it looks so
beautiful but it is dancing right yeah
you wouldn't want again
that was interesting yeah well hopefully
we get everything back hopefully it was
just the pedo thing through this thing
for Lu as it will reboot e71 yeah so we
the pitot heat that thing on the air
that on the wing that takes the the
meshes are I'm pressure or rhyme air
flow yeah got completely blocked
so we lost a speed plus this thing
completely blanked both so yeah so
basically it's a problem with this Aspen
where is the pitot heat is blocked
occasionally it just gives up completely
that's great
which is really really dangerous
that's so annoying is that via blog
through the ice yeah it was some kind of
icing apparently because if we turning
on the heat I got it back
but it just doesn't make any sense
because we haven't flown through any
sort of moisture so it's really
surprising I guess maybe the humidity is
just bright because we are on - once and
that humidity just probably little bit I
guess immolated yeah that's crazy would
have been very difficult to get there
without this the weather was down to
minimums are possible as we would have
had no way of shooting an instrument
approach like that can end up being
deadly yeah if you have your alternate
and everything is yeah it's both of
these failed because of that that's
that's really pretty crazy
that was an awesome flight officer hello
Thank You Louie
yes oh so thick beautiful views on when
stepping I thought the Canada Line
lingos beautiful this is even more FA
yeah yeah the airport alone
guys we've had dinner we've been
wandering around town a little bit and I
had a Facebook message today from one of
my friends who said I should meet one of
her friends in Nick and we've met out
with her this is Natasha Hey
so we've been learning a lot about
Greenland tonight I'll fill you in later
on and hopefully tomorrow we get to have
a proper sit-down interview but I'm
gonna go meet some of their friends Matt
still deciding whether he's gonna come
out with us tonight yeah and we've we've
grabbed a few snacks it's super
expensive any guys like crazy expensive
this is probably gonna cost me like $30
or something but we're only here for a
couple of days and he'll be fine so
we've only obviously only been here for
like half a day but I've just been
asking every question possible to
everyone I can make mainly Natasha and
we found out that there's no roads
beyond this city which is the capital
the smallest capital in the world by
population there's no roads that go
beyond it so you can't connect to any
other town or city in the country or
else there's they speak Greenlandic and
Danish and E and English and I speak one
language I'm embarrassed by that fact
and then what else yeah we're trying to
wrap our head around how the government
works right now but we it's very
confusing but it's very late also
directly linked with Denmark and they
use the Denmark currency The Crow not
I'm just I'm doing it like this you
taught us loads of stuff it's like a
lesson thanks for a good night bye
and Natasha's offered to be interviewed
tomorrow for the documentary which is
really cool because I feel bad that
we've already been to the US and Canada
and haven't really done any cool
sit-down interviews yet but we can do
some in the US when we come back round
Bennu yeah we're gonna figure out some
cool conversations to capture I guess
time is more like a kind of a
pre-interview interview so it there lots
of lots of mind-blowing facts about
Greenland which I'll try and I try to
talk about more tomorrow but yeah we
should probably head to bed and all the
other thing is we may be staying with
Natasha and a boyfriend
tomorrow night which is why I really
hoped for is to be able to stay with
local people as we're traveling so if
any of you guys want to host us as we're
coming around the world that'd be
awesome
peace out enjoy life a little adventure
