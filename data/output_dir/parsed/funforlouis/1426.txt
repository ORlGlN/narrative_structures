minute and get a rental car to drive

Darcy felt left out in the videos but
she looked left out but she was just
taking it all in with you yeah it's kind
of overwhelming and now she's best
friends with Lily
now we're gonna warp Darcy to the
security thing
so we went to hers and there's like way
too expensive to try a rental car hurt
so we're trying a few other places for
this women like now I can imagine this
is gonna take a few hours to get this
sorted which is fairly long we've kind
of got sidetracked I'm still trying to
find rental places but Lilly and Adina
doing a little shopping trip for a music
video that Lilly's filming tomorrow
night this is like knives
I think that might have been the longest
thing in the world but it just happened
literally took like hours upon hours
upon hours just to get a rental car but
it's cool now of God we've got it we've
got it let's just hope it's big enough
