if there's one word to summarize Dubai
so far I'd say extravagance
during this month or over this 40 days
it's Ramadan in Dubai which means
everyone pretty much is fasting from
food and drink all day until the Sun
sets
so it's illegal to consume food or drink
in public so it's going to be
interesting 828 meters fine never call
to prayer lunchtime prayers
