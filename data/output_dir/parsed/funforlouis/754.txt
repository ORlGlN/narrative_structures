Adelaide Australia we're about to form
this yield let's do it
and you're watching fellow boo hey guys
I'm in this Italian villa still and I'm
heading down to grab some lunch I think
some of the some of the guys made some
pasta and you know nice Mediterranean
food a little bit overcast today that's
nice and warm still I'm now sitting down
for that book club to let my office
guys this lizards everywhere but if they
all go there is no meeting I'm taking a
pause from other things yeah remember I
said a copy somewhere in here is coffee

your head okay how can I help
that's a good question yeah this blows
blood all over did you hit it on this
window here oh my goodness
we're trying to ring the doctor I've
been sent to get some coca-cola because
I think sugary drinks helps when you're
maybe going into a bit of shock or
concussion apparently now they may feel
a bit useless right now
right I think some sugar is going to
help to know coke how many cakes get his
head injuries I don't think that's true
what are they saying that we can call it
up to a local doctor the NAD will come
here now talk a she said probably dr.
Upton no in a single sign of working so
the owner of the house has arrived it's
going to try and help us find a doctor
nearby so just to be on the safe side

trip to us to I've ever driven
we've arrived we've ride the hospital
you're going to be ok
hang in there hang in there so Rach is
just filling in her information and then
a nurse is going to see her I hope
you're alright
Rachel's just come out from seeing the
nurse
ray Oh
are you laughing at all right what
happened what do we say no bitches oh
right it's okay you don't need to hide
people understand what happened okay
all right enough wife anyway so
unfortunately the beams Rachael's injury
is non-urgent which means she's been
pushed to the back a very long queue and
now she's waiting potentially for hours
the scene for her head to get stitched
up or whatever so I've gone for a little
stroll
see if I find it up snacks keep me down
and it brings some food back for those
guys well guys I think I did good look
at the size of this pizza literally got
the biggest feature in the world to
everyone so wandering back to the
hospital now I also got myself a cheeky
little kebab in there why I found some
food
that's big enough everyone if this is
anything like their kebabs then it's
gonna be good Rach is bleeding quite
badly again what I'm telling with I'm
telling you to pretend that year we've
been waiting for hours and then I'll get
see okay go okay what did I do
just go Rachel's died right like you
look like it almost at Ocean
yeah that is awesome that is the one
how vibrant of blood is this is like
insane
you really dove it three and a half
hours later for how later writes his
name has been cold you go Rachel get
mended get mended guys Rachel just sent
us this help him in a weird room my
doctor speaks no English things going
very well I sent her a sad cat in
response I think that's the best
response she's out what happened well my
dad was very nice he couldn't speak any
English so we communicated by googling
words and showing entry to her perfect
did he stitch your head he did I have
two stitches in my head and he was like
you got no water on my head for three
days and I was like it was like okay 200
