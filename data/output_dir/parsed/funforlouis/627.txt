doing an awesome photo shoot they were
creating a picture they took in Greece
oh shit yeah good fight
yeah
then
you know pull this Sun Chien focus yeah
that was she's like spot-on in focus
Oh
just zoomed in on your beads I got the
shots I needed another view from sunset
I feel sorry for people that live on
like the east coasts of things cuz they
never see the sunset light over to see
you don't see the sunrise and that is
commitment getting up the sunrises
needs go and get simcard now I've run
out of tethering data from my American
cinema so I need to pick up a Mexican
Bob I can keep an uploading these vlogs
me and Nick have been chillin having a
deep conversation for a couple of hours
and we are grabbing dinner now on the
restaurant on the beachfront the girls
just joined us
Rachel chill out say what jokes rate
jokes we mystery to this year nick has
gone in on history portion fight that
it's a parable that said if I'm gonna be
able to finish this that is the most
extravagant that can keep the same
and what is that it's just a big role I
just know it's secret potion super thank
you think I want
we are quickly hurrying down to see
Walmart still open we probably missed it
but where we say we might might still be
open
scary
why are you so excited and this
Christmas and I get a decoration from
every country that I go to so in Mexico
this is probably will employ it from
America
no from China
yeah I think you need to be Michigan I
think they might be a little big and
heavy fry bag
today Louis we can take them back
which are real Christmas Louie just said
that Christmas in South Africa doesn't
count
no it's because it's not snowing and
it's warm and they have fake Christmas
tree so this is not as as good as like a
pretty New York's good as well South
Africa and Australia
I like no real Christmas
no offense nobody so what I'm looking
for is some shorts that aren't swimming
shorts but both so I've been wearing
jeans all day so I need to wear
something that's a bit cooler I'm
thinking some harness also they can put
a belt in so I can get my keep my camera
clip on me so I'm thinking something
like this maybe maybe blue maybe gray
this is why I'm standing far away from
unity because he's tuned to get changed
and clicking public
oh yes lady
think I'm a 34 yeah you should probably
try and send some underwear to
what's amazingly no one is noticed
or I hope you boys are
I have left the shorts on I was trying
on hoping I can buy him at the counter
without taking about
I'm still wearing this
well this is what well that was pretty
successful I didn't get my flip-flops
but I groping after needed can I just
point out how hilarious this is just a
video did you see anything the girls
having a pillow fight in bikinis
now this place all day long get girls in
bikinis in this video on the video
screen yeah really really good
cinematography so all day we've been
seeing all of these police and armed
military everywhere and I just want to
say it makes me feel very safe walking
around here I'm not too worried about
anything going wrong because there's
lots of lots of security it's been a
another chilled day in Echo Park I
tomorrow I'm potentially going surfing
if I get up in the morning that is but
we are definitely going to go and
release baby turtles in the afternoon
which I'm pretty excited about and yeah
I'm feeling really good being is just
just very enjoyable see in the morning
peace out enjoy life the adventure
