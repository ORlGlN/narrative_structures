hi my name is Ben and I'm from Maryland
USA and you're watching frightfully good
morning guys
we are rested up we slept overnight in
Washington last night in the RV because
I don't think anyone had the energy to
do the all-night drive that we had
planned to Yellowstone Park
unfortunately because of that we've had
to change the route that we're doing and
we're going to skip out Yellowstone
National Park and we're going to head
straight to Idaho today I think we're
learning some valuable lessons about
trying to squeeze into many locations on
a road trip so it's a bit of a shame but
I think we can enjoy the places we do go
more because you're not trying to rush
everywhere guys exciting news apparently
I've found Seattle's Best Coffee I'm
good thank you okay this is definitely
not CFS coffee
