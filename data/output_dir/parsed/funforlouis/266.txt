good morning guys today is the last day
of 2016 it's New Years Eve I'm in Putney
my friend Andy's house where I'm staying
at the moment if you've missed the last
couple of days vlogs
we've been warming up his hot tub we've
managed to get it started and running
but taking a long time to heat up it's
been pretty cold outside but it's
finally ready so before we jump in I'm
just gonna make myself a coffee with one
of my Christmas presents which I showed
you guys the other day is an arrow press
so in my opinion the arrow press is one
of the best ways to make coffee and I'm
going to show you how I was introduced
to the arrow press by Nick Miller who
usually travels with one so the last
year or so I've seen it having coffee
made with this but this is the first
time I've had my iron so I'm very
excited I think I made myself like eight
coffees on Christmas Day so you start
off by putting a filter in this little
button bit you can't get metal filters
as well but I've just got these normal
filters and then you screw that on the
bottom there alright next up you get
some coffee this is ground coffee and
you can grind your own coffee as well
Nick's got a little coffee grinder but I
haven't got one of those yet and so
scoop some coffee in I think you just
put in whatever your preference is and I
can't find a tablespoon so I'm going to
put in maybe like like three teaspoons
or maybe then what you do is place over
your cup to fill this up with water now
I think there's a more precise way to do
this but this is pretty much how it
works maybe give that a stir and then
apparently God slowly strain the copy's
rate and this should take about 30
seconds
that is how you use an arrow press and
then it's quite easy to clean you just
have to unscrew that pop out the bit of
grounds coffee in there and hey presto
you have yourself a coffee right keys
hot tub time and something that's always
essential when you're gonna go and sit
in hot water for a long time is to stay
hydrated so I've got a bottle of water
thought ahead or is it very jelly
I think Andy's gotta find this towel
it's kind of weird walking through a
building site to get to the hot stuff
let's check the temperature yep
40 degrees that is what I'm talking
about it's nice and toasty oh we take
the cover all the way up
can you think of a better way to spend
the last edge 2016 rights 4 p.m. time to
get out the hot tub we've just managed
to make a little walk way to say getting
dirty probably time to go and find some
way of celebrating New Year's think
we're gonna get dressed and hit Oxford
that's what we head off we're just
checking the oil always a wise thing
today that looks right does does look a
bit thin
dude let's bit watery than that
yeah I think we'll be fine for now so
Andy left his car pots by River when was
it a few months ago close by River a few
months ago you might even seem like how
high the river gets when we went out on
our boat but apparently the whole car
was underwater so yeah so potentially
there's some water in the oil tank
probably needs an oil change but we can
do that later okay I think we'll get
dogs to the back I'm gonna get those
snack for the journey so we've arrived
in Oxford we've met up with some other
friends and we're going out for dinner
this is the start of our New Year's Cafe
Rouge this is our new year's crew
tonight
we had a lovely meal very civilized
that's a very interesting conversation I
don't know any of these guys pretty much
know like three of them so get to know
people and now we're heading to a club
apparently it's 11 p.m. so we've got an
hour till midnight few of us are driving
few of us get a taxi I think I'm looking
forward it's gonna be nice
two minutes the midnight guys
we're about the like chocolate
that's got an awesome photo guys
welcome to 2017
what
we have left the club there was a lot of
fun I especially like the little drum
and bass set they did in the end I am
however a little bit peckish because
it's like to your 3:00 a.m. so I'm gonna
see if they've got anything edible here
maybe a veggie burger I'm hoping hoping
they've got some falafel or they got
hummus hummus and falafel this is my die
here
well it's quarter past 4:00 in the
morning we're back at the hotel it's
it's been a very good night I wasn't
really sure to expect when we came to
Oxford but I think we managed to pull
off a pretty good New Year's Eve and it
was nice to meet a lot of new people
tonight it is now 2017 can you believe
it
sounds like a date from the future like
every year just whizzes past then
quickly it's kind of crazy and they were
saying we are nearer now to the date to
the year 2033 than we are to the year
2000 so yeah probably a drought there
but I'm looking forward to this year and
I think it's gonna be probably a better
year than 2016 for a lot of people yeah
I'm always optimistic like so I do hope
for you guys that you've managed to pull
something positive from the last year
although there's a lot of negative
things that have been identified that
have happened
globally I think I think there's still
things to be grateful for and thankful
for in our lives
yeah I just yeah I've got feeling a lot
of the bad things that happened
politically as well all the things that
a lot of people see as bad I think
potentially those could be things that
trigger positive change because so many
people want to I guess combat a lot of
the segregation and racism and I guess
yeah a lot of the political figures like
Donald Trump or the the vote Breck's in
the division and stuff I feel like a lot
of people are gonna want to rise up and
say actually we we believe it's
something different that we want to see
you know good things happen so you kind
of motivates people to take positive
action when you went your I don't know
when things aren't comfortable you know
when it's not things are kind of shaken
up a little bit so potentially the stuff
that's happened this year that's
shrinking people up a worried people
will also motivate them to make positive
change in their own lives so yeah so I
think it could it could spark something
good in this next year who knows maybe
maybe it'll be tough maybe there will be
some good things as well always look for
the positive in life guys that's one bit
of advice what are you guys planning for
2017 let me know below yeah what was
what things on your bucket list well
things he's dreaming of it would be
great to see what people want to be
doing and it's good to share vision with
each other you know
it kind of it puts it into reality ready
maybe some things you haven't even told
people yet so yeah this is a safe place
a safe community to do that same go
friend awesome I'll see you tomorrow
the first day of 2017 please Hell into a
life and live the adventure
