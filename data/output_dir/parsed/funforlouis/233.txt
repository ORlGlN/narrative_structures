my name is Matt James and we're in
Claremore France and you're watching
from for Louie boom good morning guys we
have come down to Union Station in LA
and we are heading off to San Francisco
today on an 11 hour train ride which
sounds pretty long I'm really excited
because last time we got trained in the
US was
we go like a cross-country train from I
think from Chicago all the way to three
nine are you excited Riya
yeah we got a double decker train
tell our little cabin turn it so cute
ramani to put snowball bags in the logic
trust I think we've been traveling for a
few hours it now loves toys and this
train has its own campaign so
the first point in now I think I found
it I think that enjoyment or whoo
look how alternate they're going minute
of you guys lunch has arrived
this is the only vegan option of many
veggie burger we also don't really know
where we are
little my map kind of crazy ticket so we
started in LA this morning and this is
where we're heading up to San Francisco
and we are now here from this little
edge I don't really know what this area
is it's kind of in the middle of nowhere
it's very prickly and everything so
cleaning
I know saying that because I understand
that so it's because I don't when he was
in the drought for like years before
pretty much now and the past month and a
half and raining a lot of LYLAS are
complaining that it's been raining but
to the vendors are all for you three
times yeah
and it's full of weird because normally
California so you can√≠t drawing they
just mix like a cures over anything in
this thing so the landscape
so I've had this genius idea that
they're all my Creek on mr. burgum
and yes goody for gherkin take oh oh
thank you know what's really cool is
that we have placed that for the
klystron even the road up the Pacific
Coast Highway
now in between computer so I'm going to
take a little nap guys what's really
cool about our cabin is we can show down
here some work and then there's a bunk
bed here which I've just folded down and
I can just climb up in with it easy set
oh and I'm long enough as well I mean
it's gonna kill and also we found out
that this train goes all the way up to
Seattle I think it takes look another
day from San Francisco maybe like two
and a half days I feel like we could do
that at some point in Albie's so good
we love hi miles on a train like this
you could walk to the back of the train
and look out the window along the track
as we were going so going on a mission
now the Vulcan car gets the back of the
Train
oh pretty baby
I think the coolest characters right
because this one is done the glass
ceiling so you can be everything
place there are now Michael Matthew is
Raya later on like I found a better the
true meaning of animal in time
so guys there's been a few delays on our
train ride so far and we're not even
halfway to San Francisco yet we just
sucked in a place called San Luis Obispo
so I don't know what time we're getting
in tonight it was supposed to be 10 p.m.
but I get to probably be like midnight
now so I don't mind because this is
actually really fun even though we just
like sitting and chilling it's like it's
cool because you feel like you're
traveling you're getting somewhere again
similar to being on the plane but you
kind of see everything passing by and
there's a lot more space you can walk
around there's a large dining car and
just being able to stretch your legs and
I don't know I could do this for days I
honestly could actually I did once back
in 2008 I don't know if you know before
I was logging but I did a train ride all
the way to Beijing in China from Moscow
so is that like a six-day train noise
it's pretty epic yeah you know of any
cool train rides around the world like
multiple day train rides that kind of
like famous let me know because I feel
like if you called the planner trip do
one of those at some point
yeah yeah I like this also in the UK we
don't have double-decker trains like
this so this is new to me so we rushed
in earlier I didn't get to show you
everything that this is that this is
downstairs is like rooms down here and
then packaged little work
Stanwell to the south
free coffee after him and then this is
our little run down here hello hey you
should come outside could you lift we
all right that's another way out so
what's his name from the right on the
rail if I catch you smoking it we got my
train or on the platform that will be
your stop I will keep drawn did you hear
that Roy yup well guys we were supposed
to arrive two and a half hours ago you
should still haven't arrived I think

stopped right now and he's Oakland and
yeah I'm ready to get off the train
Bryce cliquing up there in the bunk bed
yeah
I'm a little bit achy I'm ready to
stretch my legs and yeah about the move
I had the train horn going yeah
- forget my editing done so being
productive days notice and sitting in
this carriage pretty cool
we are here
