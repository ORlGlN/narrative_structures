the night to get here Nick did a lot
more Drive than I did actually I was
very tired they are going to be the next
in get into Calais but look at the icing
sour it's pretty awesome
we've sucked a little crate breakfast in
my opinion crepes so much better than
American style pancakes
allow I hope
chappie
Steve would love this guy swag
I should do the cafe
so me and Nicola we're distracted
getting a coffee and taking instagrams
of the Eiffel Tower and we're running
late for our ferry in Calais now so I'm
going to have to drive very fast to
Calais fast and responsible so this is
famously one of the most mental
roundabouts in the world there's no
lanes look at this
it's just insane it's insanity from all
angles so we've got a three-hour drive
to Calais I need to do it in like two
and a half Nick's gonna get some sleep
because he's been up most the night
driving and I feel like hey had a little
coffee took white wake
