good morning guys we've just left off
Villa and we've come to this lovely
place for breakfast and this is our last
breakfast with Angelique and soya who's
just gone up to get some more food
oh this has been an amazing time
together isn't it no this is the first
of many adventures together though yeah
yeah we go we've gotta get planning yeah
definitely it's time to say goodbye guys
California or these yeah definitely
enjoy your last day all right time to
head to a bird this is the place that
right has been talking about the entire
time yes okay this is not my favorite
places in the world and the second I got
there last time I was like I just need
to bring a living here right now so I'm
so excited honey it's gonna be happening
right I have stopped off on our way to a
bird because as you know the other day I
broke the screen of my cameras my a7 s
semi a 7r and my theory is if I can find
an HDMI micro HDMI cable that I can try
and plug it in a TV or something and get
to the menu and then enable the
electronic viewfinder so I can actually
use the camera again so sorry that just
went way over your head but that is the
plan that's what I'm gonna do so I'd
like track down like the only camera
store in Bali
I'm gonna head in there now and see we
can do something so the first place
didn't have the cable but they've
directed me to this other place it's
like a hardware store which does a load
of different things I'm just worried
that the cave was a little bit too
specialist there are a lot of things in
here so this is the large HDMI cable the
small HDMI or you don't have it so I'm
pretty sure we've found the only
shopping mall in Bali
guys I think we found it I think this is
it
I think I have the cable that I need the
plan is I'm going to plug it in here
which is where the external screen for
the camera can plug in if you have an
external screen and then when we get to
the air B&B I'm going to try and plug
this in the TV and hope that it shows
what should be on my screen so I can
select on the menu enabled my electronic
viewfinder and start using my camera
again
cool we have our own little river suite
and some dudes cutting banana leaves so
before I do anything guys I'm gonna test
out this cable oh yeah like one side in
a TV this is what my problem is right
I've always had this set to disabled why
can that work anyway I've always had
this set to just the monitor and not the
viewfinder which is a problem again yeah
so now I just have to talk about this
hey that's nice yeah that's cuz I was
worried about the monkeys and stuff and
the monkey bar it's not oh my god this
has been days guys and I did try
vlogging the other day as you know
without even looking at the screen but
this way I can see where my battery
percentage is out I can review clips and
I can check things are a focus I mean it
does look a little bit silly vlogging
like this but I think their quality is
gonna be back to its normal self I don't
know how you guys have been finding the
rx100 today it's still pretty good
camera and it's good for a little
poignant shoot bust I don't think it
compares to the the eighth of an S or
the edge of an R so these next few days
are gonna be about chilling and getting
headspace I know I talk about that a lot
like that is something I need and this
is the perfect location we're out in
nature
it's just me and Raya so we're not going
to like try and go on adventures every
day although there are some cool places
to go on adventures though we will do
that because we're here for four days
but and tomorrow I think I'm just gonna
chill by the pool and try not to get
sunburned I think that's a plan okay
guys I found something of Riya might not
be super happy about this is humungous
spider like it's a big one it's a big
boy shows nice being back on there he's
7s I feel like I'm quite like using a
point-and-shoot excuse it's so much
easier and less bulky but I think I've
also got so used to carrying around this
guy like that it just feels weird going
back to pointer she feels like I'm
taking steps backwards so this is a
paddy field power and barley is quite
iconic for hills covered in paddy fields
and I don't really understand quite how
rice grows I need to look into the
science the vectors it's literally just
flooding the plants like I've seen a lot
of water
so I've just taken the drone up to get a
bit of perspective on our surroundings
and we've also just rented some moped so
we can get around because Rio is saying
which I was here last the roads get
really congested because they're quite
small so when we go out for dinner and
massages and stuff we're gonna get
trapped if we try and go in the car so
this guy's just shown up and he brought
an extra large helmet and it fits which
I'm very surprised but a few of you were
a little bit concerned because I was
driving around without a helmet on and I
agree with you it's not not something
I'm proud of and it's something that's a
constant struggle with the size of my
head even with my dreads are down I'm
still like double XL size hat or helmet
but safety first so thanks for calling
me out on that guys here we go
there's a gear thank you
yep a nice day we'll look after your
bike
this is so refreshing huh look at that
sky as well guys well we're gonna head
out to dinner now I've got my helmet
it's a very warm evening and quite a few
bugs around for anybody oh he's gone
you ready for a bike ride
so this restaurant here Riya went to
quite a lot
okay with moved tables to over here
these are the tables that are hard to
get on they and this is I've got a
cashew vegan curry and this incredible
smoothie thank you
guys ha ok guys there is a ginormous
lizard look at the size of this gecko
he's not on the bed yet can you see the
size of this
okay he might be under the bed
thank you guys
oh it's like a holiday no oh my god
I found it inside the bed look where he
was hiding inside the bed frame but bow
