Amata we are from Germany and you're
watching Valerie who enjoy good
afternoon boys had a bit of a layer this
morning and I'm with my dad
I haven't sit in a while and we're gonna
be making a video together today or my
learn Louie series which I haven't done
in ages but we're gonna have some fun to
kick ourselves some lunch and it's a
glorious day outside so we're thinking
you may use the barbecue
alright we're strolling down to the
shops just to get a few more ingredients
for our lunch and it's this sweater is
insane so woman I've heard that this
August is supposed to be the hottest in
history in the UK
you ready feel like that you're the
hottest little gift yeah we're not gonna
be here
I'm going on a mission for milk
everybody melts at home for some reason
I had to have powdered creamer in my
coffee this morning right we're gonna
barbecue our lunch and there's no point
firing up a big barbecue so we're just
gonna get a little disposable one it's
just my daddy right we're just getting
ready for the shoot obviously this will
be alone in the LOI video that will be
up on the channel in a couple of days
probably or next week or something so
you can see the full extent of what
we're cooking and how it's all going
soon there we've been cooking away for
the hour or so and I've worked up a bit
of an appetite we're just about to serve
up my yummy food which I'm not gonna get
away again too much enough to wait for
the video all right we just finished
filming and finished eating as well and
I'm just having a nice little family
catch-up
Cheers what is this apple raspberry
rhubarb oh yeah I love curry Bob yeah
guys I've been terrible the last couple
of days I've been leaving it too late in
a day to get my vlog from the day before
edited and uploaded it's a it's kind of
usually I did that night or first thing
in the morning but I kind of got to this
bad habit leaving it and then getting
delayed so it means I can do less in the
day of everything and the stresses of
daily vlogging I'm finally done with my
editing for today so we're going out for
a little family time and since my mom's
not coming to Brazil anymore it's much
family timing as possible for that
did you enjoy our video today that enjoy
the video the it doesn't take five
minutes
you think so the best bit is when you
get to the end
yeah we're trying out my new camera for
these logging stuff with that
I think it was not all right
so it popped up almost the same place
that did the other night this time I
don't have to worry about that battery
not starting so we've got a new battery
and me and my dad are now wandering down
we just dropped my mom off to go and
meet Darcy she's up in London and we're
gonna go and stroll and meet him now
maybe get a little dessert hot chocolate
or something and then we're gonna walk
over to the light that big beam that we
want went to the other night and let me
show you to show them how cool this
so just waiting for Dorothy and in the
meantime thing we're gonna go up in this
slide we took walk spots a couple of
times but they've been on it yeah

sort of this is basically the best of
your place hey nice to meet you Batman

walking over to the spotlight again big
lights
I didn't show you this the other night
guys but look how many bugs and fried
themselves on the bulb they get
attracted to the light and then fry
ladybirds well don't do it it's like
that scene out of bugs win is that that
big fat bargain there's like the lion in
his life it's so
what have you got there dad I've got one
of these moths

but it's flapping in here I don't know
if he's gonna go away he's flapping he
wants to get out he wants to get that
kin today he's clapping he's quite big
he's quite big he's gone he's oh oh he's
only used a oh don't go on the light

shock yeah burn his toes up oh no guys
