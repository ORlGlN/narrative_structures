they're like they're very very dark
lenses of it would you're inside yeah no

these are the next time trying to beam
around smaller so I'm decided I hate
shopping

coffee watching the surfers bumped into
this dude
Alex yeah yeah he is a Spanish youtuber
so if any of you guys speak Spanish
don't check his channel out or link it
below he's out here in Australia
improving his English name so I need to
learn Spanish guys I need to learn
Spanish so bad when my life slows down I
was chatting to JP about it today like
at some point I think my life pace is
going to slow down and there's lots of
things on the day which I can't do right
now with the pace of life I have but
learning another language is up there
guys look at this campervan that is
lovely
I've never seen it like a navy is that
like a slightly like a dark definitely
navy blue oh but doesn't that get you
excited but look inside but I love that
it's still the tradition like old retro
you know I mean it's not been done up to
to new well it's been restored is any of
this original what is it originally made
to look like oh it's just lovely
oh look at this stuff it's like it's got
the modern touches but it's like still
looks really oh you think the one the
bug needs before the fool needs work
like it hurts me to see it every time
yeah it's got it's been neglected for
sure
what's the way for the girls to arrive
we've gone for a little stroll to the
end of the beach and we are just
checking out this awesome swimming pool
like literally right on the sea I've
seen this a few times before but never
but these little splashing instable so
cool
okay guys we have met up with Rachel how
you doing Rachel you believe how long
it's two years
I reckon some people don't even know who
wrote to it if you die and you need to
get tonight go back and what I'm
thinking I think it started because I
came and stayed in Sydney and then I
ended up just staying for like a month
at your house tonight we've literally
like no plans Rachel like yeah that was
very kind bit I think I was in have not
the best of places in my life without
then I think I think I was just like I
think it was just all so new to me the
YouTube being and like and I was just
like overwhelmed with everything and
Rachel helped me get back on track so I
owe a lot to you Rachel and it's nice to
see you again
and we've decided that we're going to go
out and just get some food and find
somewhere just to chill for like a
couple of hours so we can probably catch
up and chat and maybe play some board
games well maybe there's ballgames in
our air B&B we can grab do you like my
little cute beach place yeah okay good
news guys we have a replacement fusion
that we had delivered to Rachel I don't
have your note but we kind of break our
the other one so more 360 videos coming
we are we've had dinner wait interest
with met with Holly
wait Richie or Lee you switch them
around Holly but your instagrams really
really okay thank you we met olive ollie
and we are playing space team show each
other
if you seal disable few sales
Oh Ethan device to one device to one
they're gonna be so angry
we're just going for a little stroll
what what are you gonna say via that
this machine is amazing that they're
cleaning the beach and just so much
pretty much all the trash that gets left
on beaches gets put into the ocean and
then kill
animals and sets of this way none of
that happens it's amazing I mean people
shouldn't be throwing their trash in the
beach anyway but yeah and if any of your
going to the beach make sure you pick up
any trash you see even if it's not your
own that is cool
it's just like a track to it like a
little singing in the background we're
going on a little walk
Ollie's taking us to see the lights oh
yeah it doesn't it pretty nicely
creepy like guys it's 3:30 in the
morning and I'm uploading a vlog I had
to skate down the road from where we're
staying there's really good Wi-Fi just
public walk free Wi-Fi in Bondi Beach
but you have to kind of go down to the
beach front so I'm just perched in this
like the doorway of this shop and I've
got almost 4 megabytes up which is like
4 times faster than the Airbnb so I'm
just gonna chill here it's gonna take
two hours and I'm just going to do some
work that's annoying
it means I'll be here till 5:30 I'm
hoping it speeds up
so turns out there's a one gigabyte data
limit per day per device and I can't
seem to get around that restriction so
I'm gonna have to carry on uploading
from the house it's now 4:30 in the
morning when I should get it like half
uploaded
well the challenges of daily vlogging
it's been a very chilled day to day guys
I've enjoyed resting and not running
around like crazy this is exhausting
skating uphill anyway yeah I'm gonna go
to bed and I guess tomorrow will be a
bit more eventful we'll try and do some
things I'll try and show Riya around
Sidney a little bit we're gonna go over
to the opera house maybe get a boat if
the weather's nice and yeah see in the
morning peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure
