you are watching fun for Louie boom good
afternoon guys we've just arrived at the
convention center I've got a few
interviews going on today I've got like
a little one with short awards I think

long onstage Q&A with an audience and
then I think a two-hour meeting Bri this
afternoon
I think that's good

I need to take a microphone okay okay
all right let's do this
he has been to our places and probably
most of us that balances weight the
traveler lets rehab
you've been to so many conventions I
feel like so you're like a pro at
prepping so the big question is what did
you have for breakfast to prep for such
a big day I had a banana papaya cashew
nuts and then I just ate half a bowl of
vegetable ramen No
nice nice do you ever get overwhelmed by
coming here and meeting everyone or how
do you kind of explain how it feels it's
not it's not overwhelming I think I've
been for the last three years to a lot
of YouTube convention so I just enjoy
meeting people because you kind of meet
incredible people from all over the
place that come to these things like you
guys you're all incredible so even if
it's just a little conversation with
different people it's it feels cool
because it's more than just this online
kind of interaction it's like this real
community people that meet up and come
to these things
about no left
these things that stop them doing these
life is like a fear of stepping out and
being charged or fear of maybe they'll
fail they want to do and well it's a
saying like failures mother might like
it but it's it's something that it's
machine scared you know
like this is kind of trial and error but
you can learn some things without having
to try them like try these out

these guys ahead enough food yes Ricky
we decided we're gonna kind of cool it a
night now day tomorrow and is really
tired she just likes the feeling of this
well that was a lot of fun guys
I enjoyed dressing up as Captain Jack
Sparrow I'm also kind of glad I didn't
go for the eyeliner because now I don't
have to worry about taking eyeliner off
because I imagine that's not fun but
yeah it was good to participate in
Halloween even though it's something I
still don't really understand um I
should probably research and find out
what it actually even is but it was cool
to dress up and I thought if there's
something positive I can take from it is
that people very creative with their
costume designs and it must be a lot of
fun working up to like going out and
knowing that you're amongst like
thousands of other people that are
dressing up and it's it's just an excuse
I think to dress up and have fun so
that's a positive thing from it sweet I
think tomorrow we're gonna go in an
Instagram mission with JP he's gonna
come and meet us and I'm gonna try and
get up a little bit earlier I've I've
definitely found this bed very
comfortable like maybe a bit too
comfortable so haven't been getting up
in the morning
but i yeah i'm looking forward to the
last day of streamcon i think we're
going to pop in and say hi to people
even though I don't think I've got
anything I have to do like I don't got
any pals or anything sweet I'll see you
in the morning guys
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure boom
