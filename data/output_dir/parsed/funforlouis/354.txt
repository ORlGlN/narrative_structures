good afternoon guys it's incredibly late
start to today's vlog but I did however
yes then today get three vlogs edited so
I'm almost back on track I know a lot of
you have been frustrated that I'm so
behind in my vlog so I apologize but I
am working on it it's not very easy but
anyway me and my dad are now heading up
to London just to find something fun to
do I've heard there's a little festival
happening near London Bridge but we
really haven't got any plans other than
we have the booster board with us and
I've also got a penny board as well so
we might skate you around a bit yeah
so I have a penny board my dad's on the
boost it I think this is his first time
in a crowded area on the boosted you
don't know it's on the boosters but it's
is slightly uphill here oh sorry that's
gonna be trying how Lindsay just a very
slow
I think this is just the underground
here
we are standing a London Bridge we've
managed to navigate our way here without
any accidents we're gonna head towards
Tower Bridge now and I think there's
some stuff going on over there and even
if we've missed some of the activities I
think we're just going to go points of
food on a bit of an adventure I think we
go down these stairs dad then it's like
a flat path all the way found a little
open-air theatre show just my luck my
very first patient dies on me this man
this drunkard I need to know what he
looks like my life wasn't dying fuel so
the kingdom of heaven with you and leave
me in peace
all right well we had some dinner and
sat in on the fifth production what was
it crime and punishment crime and
punishment didn't really I didn't really
follow the plot because we got there
half an hour late but it's pretty cool
it's been happening since June
apparently four nights a week or
something in that place for free like
people who just show up so there's like
free theater productions going on every
night just the officer did not know
about that trying to keep our heads low
not to be busted by some security guard
yeah this little section of river here
is apparently private property so no
skating allowed we're breaking the rules
that's where we were just now just down
there I decided we did a cost over Tower
Bridge
I don't know where we're going stuff is
fun spontaneous adventure
check that Hummer limo out
though this is one of my favorite areas
in London sing Katharine Docks
yeah it's nice next few little pubs
coffee shops and we were just looking at
the the size of the lock to get ships in
here because the the tides completely
out in the Thames at the moment if you
remember the other week when we drove
our little boat up here in the boat got
it got beached on the side of the Thames
but it's crazy because this is all still
full of water and in the lock over here
I'll show you quickly this is like
completely empty right down to the water
level that's just that's just the bottom
of the riverbed there just mud
we found a little footpath that runs
alongside the river so this out what
awesome views
having a little break see I don't think
it's even pulling that much more strain
once you're going
speed up event
well level you one two or three
no I'm talking about
see cruising around London at night is
it's very beautiful it starts a nice
city I don't think I've ever been inside
have you been inside
guys here we are simples cathedral I
think this must be one of the the
grandest buildings in London alongside
like Buckingham Palace we're making some
good distance on these boards I think
that's like a two-mile skate from London
Bridge or whatever guys I just found an
epic Instagram location in London
basically this is the Millennium Bridge
behind me that's at a modern over there
as you cross boom one incredible view of
sympathy drew very tempting
this is loud
yeah
should we do our home I am tired
surely the boho
I don't know where we are
no I think no I'm a bit I'd go a bit
lost
somehow we've got lost in Borough Market
all the gates are closing have a very
fun night skating around although I
haven't actually gone to the booster
board yet so I've got this idea
my dad's can jump in the car and meet me
at the London I was just a couple of
miles away and then I'll just cruise
over there now just to get out of my
system thanks for secretly I enjoy home
no yeah it wasn't too bad
so alpha showed me this app the other
day that comes through the boosters
board that shows you your battery
percentage and how many miles you've
covered and stuff so I I just checked it
now and unfortunately I've only got 33
percent battery and it's not looking
hopeful like this is this is full power
right now it's almost we're almost out
but it's annoying
but I'm gonna make it
yeah I think they're very far it
immediately was I could immediately tell
it wasn't power powerful and then it
yeah just stopped well as a very fun
evening and I appreciate it spending
quality time my dad I don't always get
to hang out with him especially when I'm
gallivanting off around the world so I
made the most of tonight it was very
good and talking about gallivanting
around the world tomorrow night me and
Dave are heading over to Cologne in
Germany for a couple of days we're going
to be going to a photo conference called
Photokina I mentioned it a few vlogs ago
but yeah we're going to go over there
with Sony we're gonna be hanging out at
their booth so if you're going to be
there but I'm just thinking actually
this vlog probably won't be up in time
but anyway that's where we're gonna be
maybe we're gonna meet some of you guys
there hopefully and yeah learn a bit
about photography twice and cameras out
who knows all right catch in the morning
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
