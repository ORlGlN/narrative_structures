well dinner sir we got sweet potatoes

delicious thanks mom well look who's
come to join us is Hillary hey yeah how
you doing haven't seen it's like three
months okay so having a nice family time
we're gonna go and give her a lift to
the train station and guys you should
check out she hasn't released it yet but
she's working on some music which is
gonna be incredible on a channel and
also we are discussing some travel plans
which are really exciting as well is
that your train hi
I'm just sorting out some paperwork
because I'm not often in England and
sometimes you get caught with admin and
not a few that is in the post and like I
was saying earlier I've got police
finding the post for speeding I just
want to show you something guys so this
is in this form exceeded the speed limit
by six miles an hour
thirty six and thirty so not extreme
speeding they are going to all lengths
there like it's a court hearing a court
hearing to give me a fine and point to
my license thing it's a bit of a waste
of like the courts time a six miles an
hour over like I didn't get frustrated I
things a lot by just spending like half
an hour filling in a form to send to
them so he's like here's my letter I'm
sending off and I don't have envelopes
and I've managed to buy some stamps but
I've sent a little let for the court
axon of my license and they're gonna get
give me a fine and all sorts of stuff
let's go post this in the letterbox but
in the post box but this is it's just
annoying you know
and you know the crazy thing is if I
hadn't responded to that letter but
haven't send that off the next time I
flew into the UK I probably get arrested
again for missing a court hearing even
though it's because I went to 6 miles an
hour over the speed limit that's what
would have happened arrested there would
have been a warrant out for my arrest
well guys and added some nice family
time tonight I always get really peckish
astana night yeah I think it's family
time tonight I'm really good chat with
dad and just it's just nice coming back
for these kind of pauses in my hectic
life of travel around the world and
getting up to whatever it doesn't mean
however these videos when I'm back at
home do tend to be a bit shorter and a
bit a bit less eventful
what was my the big event today was go
for coffee with Ben C's so bear with me
and this is I guess a little bit more
ordinary than the rest of my life but
it's important and it's good to spend
side people and yeah not not as much of
an adventure there's some of the other
stuff I'm getting up to you I'm sure you
understand and it's good it's gonna be a
good week I think I'm heading up
tomorrow morning Steve's picking me up
and we're gonna go to London and get to
some mischief and so I'll catch you then
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure boom
