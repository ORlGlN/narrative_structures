hey guys my name is Josh
I'm in Paris I'm in Switzerland there's
snow and mire and you're watching
good morning guys I've arrived in New
York City
breakfast on the train
I think I've figured out my way there
I've said like three trains
well I accidentally got that train free
as I bought the wrong ticket guy was
sympathetic and let me off
I just arrived in Manhattan I just need
to figure out my way
it's a Hoboken now for I'm staying there
just jumped in the cab and I thought
I'll take it to this address and he was
like I'll be easier to take a bus so he
just dropped me down the road to the bus
station and I'm gonna jump on the bus
well that was a bit of a kerfuffle
getting here but
I'm now heading up to meet my friend
Michelle you guys may have seen her
briefly in my u.s. 2011 roadtrip series
it's like the first day when we arrived
in New York we all crashed no apartment
and that's the apartment I'm heading to
oh I'm pretty tired guys it's early so
I've arrived and my friend Michelle was
going off to work I'm just going to
chill in our apartment for a few hours
and make a plan for today I've just
uploaded my ice bucket challenge video
and I've got another vlog to quickly
edit get that up this evening and then
I'm back on track
Oh what I'm also going to do now is have
another chance yet is donate to the ALS
Association because it's not just about
pouring cold water on your head
it's actually about bringing awareness
and raising money to find a cure for the
ALS disease I'm gonna have a little nap
because I think get much sleep on the
plane and I'll try it
so just like little power nap and so and
then I'm going to go out for lunch

ready to hit New York City I think I'm
gonna grab a cab after lunch I'm now

catfish the movie have you seen it but
they're just telling me about the light
in golden hour is the time to shoot
everything about lead if you watch
movies it's always shot either in
sunrise or sunset just as the Sun is
kind of at that point in the sky because
it's perfect lighting there's not too
strong overexposed up
