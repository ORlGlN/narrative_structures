good afternoon guys
we're in Dubai we drove here from Abu
Dhabi last night after flying in and
yeah I've come down to the Dubai Mall I
think it's one of the largest malls if
not the largest mall in the world I've
been there a few times in previous vlogs
and we've got a little bit of shopping
today for the onward journey as we're
traveling around the world the first
thing we need to get is a bunch of hard
drives because I've used all my hard
drives up and yeah then we might do some
sightseeing
do some activities hang out some people
later on I'm so glad to be here
gorgeous weather
okay we haven't found hard drives yet
but we have to start with some lunch
we've got some pad thai which is pretty
tasty it's so much choice that this mall
is crazy isn't it I've been here I think
almost five hours
if boring is just shopping but it's
still amazing
it has like I'm sure you guys team up
looks before it has like a nice ring
one of the largest if not the largest
Aquarians in the world and had
STIs of skis like a net mother now just
has everything you could possibly ever
imagine cinema
anyway it is crazy I'm sure you could
get lost in everydays all right these
are the drives we need we're gonna get
four of these which is 16 terabytes so
it should do this for a while for some
reason that the different colors are
different prices this is like $20 more
just cuz it's white is that we're gonna
go up the Burj Khalifa
JB's never be done as a Sun setting
either so this could be pretty epic and
my friend papers coming to join us you
ready hey but I'm also waiting we're
just tucking into some very healthy ice
cream and sorbet
right we've got to the top of the Burj
Kalifa this is my first time being here
at night and it's pretty epic it's very
different experience because you can
just see all the city lights and it's
also kind of rush hour so there's just
so much traffic but it's really
mesmerizing watching all the little cars
they're just like moving around and yeah
this is that this is really really cool
you know so guys we're definitely not at
the top look how much further ago that
have you ever been up a building this
tool before great be uneasy about it a
beam up the building it sways they all
sway but it was noticeable really that's
pretty good yeah I'm sure if there
weren't so many people and if you just
had the time to like analyze it and it
was really windy you'd probably feel
this way
this is so cool boys I've never seen the
big fountain display on the top you can
see how fast it's moving might is pops
twice in the way down like pop they're
like the 100th floor and then again
about that
here - - it Hafer didn't make it
the top of the tower with us but she's
swaying outside we're gonna go get some
dinner now check that out
guys we found hey fire
it's taking a while you gotta use I like
them did you have like a heels on or
something before
okay thank you we need to find some food
now we're gonna go and sit down and
chill this is so funny when we sat down
to order at this place hey food was just
like have you got anything that looks
like this
do you like pulled up this random
YouTube video and it's just like a
steaming cup of soup and she's like wish
you to be fair they actually found
something that looks pretty much like
what you asked for
oh thanks that's him yeah yeah I mean I
don't usually but we're both pretty
tired so little a little pre-dinner
coffee in the Dewar chairs with your
water so we've finished dinner and we've
just popped up to the Apple Store
because all of our phones died at the
same time so we're literally just like
stealing power right now and charging
all our phones before we head back
unfortunately tomorrow to do it properly
but we've had a bit of a like a chat
tonight when we were sitting around
eating just about like I don't load zuv
different issues and we're gonna we're
gonna have a really long chats around
with and boys and religion it got pretty
deep so hopefully tomorrow we can just
yeah we can get deep it's just hit me
again how insane the shopping mall is
somehow it's 10:45 it's like almost 11
p.m. and it's like fully busy everyone
still shopping I don't know when this
closes this is insane it's actually
insane okay so he was going to drop us
somewhere
JP's staying in a hotel tonight this to
get a little bit of breathing space
because you know we've been on top of
each other for six weeks so it'll be
good to have a night apart I'm gonna be
staying at Steve's house Steve bond here
we saw as we arrived them to buy Benny
we lost two papers car we're just
walking around in the parking lot this
place is so big that we've lost her car
right I wasn't gonna hang around hey
fern JP to find a car I ended up just
jumped in it uber back but I'm yeah back
at Steve's house now I'm gonna crash out
it's been not massively eventful day but
I quite like the having a first day just
as in like an establishing day in a
place it's hard to jump straight into
the action so we're gonna have a bit
more of a productive day tomorrow and
like I said we're gonna be having a
really in-depth interview with Hafer I
think she is awesome and I can't wait
for her to share some of her life on
camera for the documentary and yeah it's
yeah it's nice to be back in Dubai and
I'll catch you first thing in the
morning peace out enjoy life and live
the adventure
