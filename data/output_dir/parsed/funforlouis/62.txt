good morning guys it is 5:00 a.m. we are
in Auckland New Zealand we are leaving
today to fly to Fiji yeah it's gonna be
an interesting flight it's quite a long
one and like I said the last couple of
logs these next few legs are pretty
critical and yeah interesting because
we're flying over such vast expanses of
ocean this is the Pacific crossing all
the way back to the states that say yeah
yeah just prepping as much as we can
jp's Ben and I just checking up on the
weather as usual we flying out about an
hour
it's gonna be a nice sunrise yeah it's
beautiful around you so we're all fueled
up paid we're about to go David here has
been an absolute legend over at sky care
this has been the best service at any
FBA anywhere in the world bro yeah
exactly
thank you so much you're an absolute
legend right it's time to see that we're
getting off dry immersion suits on it's
very noisy right now because there's a
lot of big commercial planes however I
guess lining out ready to take off we're
a little bit our place here and being a
tiny aircraft from clear
and Karen's November 2 ones are getting
called mad are to not even real New
Zealand are gonna run straight off we're
going straight over to say raise our
university throw it here
oh there it is
to the left on the shore there like a
bunch of big buildings that stuff looks
lovely equally about these islands I
think that poor 9th there nobody looked
on that map nature is a
that's an amazing island by the way like
it that was lips to this little berry
oiler that at the world little barrier
okay yeah people live area where do you
want to all right we're coming up to a
point of no return and I calculate go
740 miles left we divide that by eight
hours of appearance so ninety two point
five knots is the lowest we can go that
means we have plenty of wheel so we're
gonna weigh in a per seat and looks like
we're gonna get to Fiji today awesome
what's there if we carry another speed
what's the ETA ETA 140 Zulu but
for five hours
alright so a while to go a lot can
happen to five hours
alembert 1-0 uniform clear to land
runway 0 2 3 1 0 at 1 5 knots its Lancer
- sir
I hope we're staying right there we'll
all the fancy ops of the nice water
those we're on the ground in Fiji we've
had to spray the insecticide or whatever
this spray that you have to spray in
some of these countries so you're not
contaminating from other countries you
know I'm talking about anyway and we
have to wait in five minutes but it's
like literally like a sauna in here it's
so hot I don't even know you can see me
I think the lens is steamy up
welcome to Fiji we have arrived at our
hotel
thankfully it's like walking distance
from the airport sadly we're actually
only here for one day so we've got the
afternoon to enjoy this place and then
we're heading off first thing in the
morning it reminds me I guess it reminds
me a little bit of Hawaii I guess it is
one of the Pacific Islands I would love
to spend some proper time here this is
like a nice climate yeah just proper
tropical vibe you know
I'm tempted to jump in the pool after
we've had some lunch they make
incredible 3gc
well thankfully guys I found something I
can a they have dal roti and rice and
have a bit of Indian food there JP tells
me that Fiji is it that the third
biggest Indian population outside of
India and as you know I love Indian food
you know you're not feeling Indian food
today JP well JP and me actually just
crashed out for a couple of hours both
pretty exhausted him more so obviously
he was doing flying I actually did
manage to get a little nap on the plane
so yeah he's yeah he's powering through
absolute legend we're now you know just
wandering down to get some dinner
guys I think I might have ordered too
much I got this curry dish which comes
with a main curry and a soup and then I
ordered a side of vegetables so yeah I
don't think I'm gonna be able to eat all
this but I'll try yeah I may be sleeping
some of tomorrow it's funny because I am
I've rested quite nicely
big news even for a few days I've got a
bit more energy but I should probably
pace myself because we've still got a
couple of weeks left until the arrival
party's over
yeah it's probably best to be two step
when I tomorrow morning well like a net
oil we're flying into American Samoa and
then the following day with like
Christmas Island and then as chapter
champion we've got yeah maybe even a
week in that why which are looking
forward to I think these very fast stops
on ideal but you know yeah we're kind of
just leapfrogging to get to the places
we can with a fuel we have yeah so
another long flight tomorrow we're
making progress guys yeah I'm seeing a
network
into a life adventure
