good morning guys it's my last day in
the UK and before I like the us start
our epic flight around the world I've
got a few things to sort out one of
which is to swing past the yard where
the bus is being kept we haven't seen it
before this is the lift Adventure bar
and like you saw the other week is
completed it is ready to roll we've
already been doing a few festivals with
it and for me this is just the beginning
of an exciting journey I have always
wanted this class have always dreamt of
being a hot tub on the bus come on I'll
show you the house some of you have seen
it if you didn't see the video the other
day by the way guys are linked and below
we took the bus to the secret garden
party we had some decks out downstairs
DJing people in the hot tub it's been
anyway like I said this is been a dream
of mine for years and even when I was
teenager I used to kind of draw pictures
of like hot tubs and top of buses or
inside anyway it's finally complete and
sadly I'm going away for 3 months so I'm
not going to be with the bus and it's 3
months but I would absolutely love to
offer you guys the opportunity to rent a
bus if you're in the UK essentially the
block can be used for like I don't know
I just think there's endless
possibilities anything within your
imagination of what you could do with
this class whether it's like private
hire or you work for a company you want
to do with the corporate event for me
they have so much potential here so I
will leave an email below obviously we
like include a driver too from locations
we can even wrap the bus with logos or
designs and yeah guys honestly it would
be amazing to know that the bus is
actually being used I
the next three months so if you've got
like a birthday a wedding like I said
some kind of launch event this would be
just such an epic position honestly this
is one of the most exciting projects
I've been involved with it has taken a
while he's been I think a year now in
the making obviously Mike who still get
married he did the majority of the work
set it all up we kind of sat down and
dreamt up together and drew sketches and
Jim's helped kind of finish off the
designs and and change some things
inside obviously if you drop us an email
we can give you a bit more specs about
what's inside but I think there's like
an eight or nine kilowatt generator in
the back there's mains power throughout
the bus running water we're going to
install some showers as well for the hot
tub oh and also there's a microwave
ovens a little stove and sink and that's
back here if you haven't seen before
this folds out to be a massive double
bed so if you want it to use the bus and
accommodation somewhere at festival like
I said or use or to go somewhere call
some friends this is your bus a plan is
when we get back from our three-month
flight around the world we're going to
be doing a tour a road trip in this bus
maybe doing some private screenings and
just meetups basically around the
country and again I'll let you know
exactly when that's going to happen it
probably happened beginning of next year
but like I said I just cannot wait for
this bus to start getting used and yeah
I guess all the hard work and effort and
design that's gone into it for people to
actually be able to enjoy it and have
fun with the bus that was the entire
vision from the start guys I've met with
Briah okay and we are government lunch
before getting on our flight this
afternoon and we're just spending some
nice time together I've got my copied
see so I'm going to be flying to LA and
arrived flying to Bulgaria to send my
other family and we don't know when
we're going to see to the next which
doesn't usually happen not like this
anyway
no I honestly I think that's like one of
the secrets to making long-distance work
is knowing when you're going to see to
that
so it's assuming that we don't you know
then it's like it gives you people minds
but right now it could be in three
months yeah what yeah worst-case
scenario if our timings don't work out
because there's well flight so like up
in the air give the funds but like
everything is all the dates like there's
nothing in stone because they could be
like weather problem we might get
delayed we're already delayed a little
bit from taking off originally we're
going to leave in the tent but anyway it
means that we can't give people step
dates of where we'll be places so Riya
can't like keep her entire three months
just open and free to come hang out so
well we try and make it work but yeah
worst case gnarly I three months back
that's not a lot of you guys man three
months is way to like one month yeah
yeah I think after two weeks that's like
normally like the limit man like two
weeks and then college like they make
sure that we're not spending more than
three weeks apart but it'll be I don't
to say it'll be like a challenge for our
relationship I think it will be just
but we've also been saying that we're in
like the best place to Empire in our
relationship right now
I think you think because it's not the
time to be being apart yeah yeah I'll be
fine
all right we'll be fine we'll be fine
okay mighty bears arrived now
bye have a nice flight / bulgaria also
there's a massive project going on or
something over there guys I cannot
believe this they didn't set my back and
if you saw yesterday it was absolutely
rammed like couldn't be more full of
electronic like more than I've ever
brought anywhere before and they just
looked me they're like it's your bag
full of cameras and I was like yeah
digital editor so good so relieving that
happens did it that could have taken
like 20 minutes to half an hour just
searching through every little bit my
bag back three three do you feel a bit
sad though guys leaving briar yeah it's
been really nice hanging out with her
sausages last new week obviously will
mostly traveling together but this next
trip is definitely going to be the
longest time apart that we're going to
be having I'm headed to my gate I
managed to get a little bit of editing
done but don't ever going to hit my blog
uploaded before slide apart
an ongoing problem to me and because
it's my last day with riot yesterday I
didn't there any editing and then again
this morning just wanting to spend
quality time together didn't manage to
cut away to commit to finish the Edit
last probably the last couple of weeks
have been a lot of organizing through
the world fly and I haven't been on top
of my vlogs stuff because I get the
state and we start the trip I'm going to
hopefully get up on there the daily
real-time upload so like the following
day off this happened and I'm going to
be trying to snatch Instagram story
everything as much as I can so yeah do
not miss out
I'm in Erie Pennsylvania right now I
flew over from Toronto this morning and
I'm now about to depart for a flight to
Santa Monica which is where I'm going to
go meet Dewey but we're going there for
a few reasons we're going there to get
the airplane tagged to get a oil transit
system installed as well as just some
general work on the airplane plus to
brand it get everything ready and then
we officially leave for the trip from
California in about seven days roughly
not exactly sure yet
so guys if it's got text message from JP
he's currently flying from Toronto to LA
to meet me so we can get out the last
the plane and get things sorted before
we leave end of the week
but he just said that there's been some
engine problems he does do an emergency
landing in Springfield than or ever does
not sound good said that engine nearly
died
I think failed in the engines I'm hoping
this isn't a severe problem don't even
want minor problems when you're flying
this should be completely sorted before
we fly hoping we get some throw
mechanics on this ADA
I'm glad in two eyes I know not all
really hope jerseys right yeah he
messaged a meal and it basically they're
they're examining the plane people could
be wrong and he thinks hopefully it's
nothing major our top secret theory
offline and I'm starting off right here
in our head I play this
