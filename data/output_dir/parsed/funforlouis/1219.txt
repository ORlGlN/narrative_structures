I'm Sophia I'm 12 years old and I'm from
Adelaide Australia and you're watching
from the Louie injuries right it's 9:00
a.m. I managed to go there to fit
alright I didn't get a load of sleep but
I'm just doing some breakfast quickly in
a moment
this is Sammy he runs to the projects
out here he's gonna share a bit of his
story when I was approaching seven my
brother who was my idol he died he died
mysteriously
but that wasn't a big thing within this
teach that was the norm of a day some
teacher burned alive Dyer's some of them
knives some of them shot
randomly for us it was a normal life
when I was age nine I became a street
boy and all these boys within this state
who followed me to the streets because
we all wanted freedom got in the life of
trans we did whatever we can to survive
so I go to the highway transaction park
and the very first guy who comes is a
guy from England his name was Albert and
look at him I didn't know his name van
and looked at him and I stuck my hand to
him I stood for Schilling he takes me by
the hand is not a chimp of me and hits
me simple question why are you not in
school there are say simple money I
think you'll give me the money and
disappear but he gets on to as a second
question they may take you to school and
pay the money would you be willing when
I donate my hats we find yes this man
took me and he walks to school
he talks to the proprietors of the
school they accept me into school and
then the very first thing he passed me
is a pair of shoes now
shoes meant a lot vend and that killed
me I felt luck after special but he put
me a brand new pair of shoes school
uniform school bag and took me back that
school paid all the money to cover my
primary level and he went
kept going to school what kept me going
to school was the shoes I wake up in the
morning look at the shoes another one
anything just put on the shoes in the
school uniform acceptable to school
that's how you have come from Canada I'm
just so so lucky to be at the center of
what is transpiring out here the other
day we got one of the boys join a
national school which has produced more
national leaders than any other school
in this country this boy came from the
streets when you hear of the kind of
lifestyle of Bagram some of the kids
have come for is just amazing and then
end up where they are such a privilege
it's crazy to think what Sammy was
sharing this morning how about where
he's coming from and his life has turned
into this and he's supporting hundreds
of kids that were in his position so
inspirational so I guess today we're
shifting more of this stuff up there
great the cements a knife yeah let's do
this
so we built volcano
that's much quicker than taking the
stairs down much quicker we are making
good progress guys we're gonna sieve the
dirt
Cybil the rocks out I'm gonna try and
get some of the kids to teach me how to
dance come on
kids are gonna teach us a song now Rock

the other day he was talking on camera

the video I'm saying thank you for for
the messages and thank you for you are
making me stay happy I'm telling God
that to bless you and to I do thank you
Campbell so I think we're about to head
off which is gonna go and duck in and
see how this business meetings been
going
so we've just come down to the Garrett's
again have a little look inside because
we when we walk down the other day I was
like so this is one of the guys is
employed through this carriage being
built for your family it's a little cool
and they're saying they're repairing
like five to six cars a day in it pretty
awesome
I guess that's generating some income
paints and mechanics here good it's good
to see the vision succeed

time in the hotel and we're jumping into
Matt tattoos to go and get some dinner
