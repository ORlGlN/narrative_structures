the bumpy road which is on the back my
parents house well this has been the
bumpy road for as long as I can remember
since I was a little kid but office
because it's a private road and the
residents don't pay for it to get well
what Carmack probably and it also means
not that many people drive down it which
I guess is the aim be I'm going to the
train station to pick up my friend
Sylvia and to meet my dreads up today
which could take a fair few hours
because they are being a mess
