but whenever some seats in the front row
wait we're in the right one

create community so it's not just about
going out having a coffee eating food is
about connecting with other people I
think that's another story we wanted to
tell and hopefully that back in three
that's why it's video
when I started I put myself in a box as
a travel blogger and I thought I could
expand we do travel blogs and I've
decided to kind of break out of that and
having a lot of fun experimenting and
having fun with just like things like
this I hear about never like what I
thought I could do a morning routine but
yeah just don't put yourself in a box
because ups of you take you to that we
can all think whatever we want
so we've just come out the screen and
they did the little red carpet thing met
some viewers and we're gonna head to

with a filmmaking aspect I really
enjoyed that you need the Romanian I
enjoy like Mayan creation all fear that

in my room for a couple of hours editing
that's rendering now I've just met with
Steve we're walking out to me the others

stuff Vegas is a big deal so it might be
like diner
yeah okay I'll find say I've seen some
fries how's the day being that good I'm
just tired
yes it's weirdly tiring like watching
stuff on screens all day it's been
really cool but like yeah he has been
quite tiring I think also with the time
difference of stuff is yeah that weird
like I feel
I might actually get a little bit of
caffeine in me filet yeah later because
this is the light on it yes I was almost
naughty before I came out I've had a red
ball stomach so I was thinking I might
have a ripple because otherwise I'm
gonna go to bed at like 12 we get one
yeah don't know huh tonight last night
we have to stay up nice tonight yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh I
thought your zippers broken blow man why
why would you want a zip whoa oh no no
no what are you doing bro oh no it's

off me wait your zips up the side why
just in case you need to get your hip
yeah but that would actually be good for
me bro but it's my hammer or this would
be good for you
it would be
I don't know what's going on I think
that's literally just a drink so just
before we came out for dinner then
uploaded the Artic visual bytes and I'm
just so excited for you guys to see it
so if you haven't already hello Suzanne
Oh check it out
you are not ready you are literally not
ready for this is unreal it's unreal I
think it's definitely the best visual
right stunning
when is it is it nice feeling to have it
finally online yeah but that's still
only like 200 people are online version
Nancy the go live ready dude all that
hard work paid off bro yeah I think I
think I'm okay well everyone went back
to a bar for a little bit we've just
been sitting around chatting and yeah
it's been a really good buffer festival
this year I think the main thing for me
is just just feeling so proud of all my
friends just seeing what we've all like
achieved and just making these cool
videos and getting to show them and I
don't know I think it's just that
environment where people feel supported
and encouraged with what they're making
and just having a setting where we can
all come together over these last few
days and just encourage each other and
like chat about people's content and
just get to lay on the stage and look up
at a big screen and all of that it's
just you know it's been really cool
tonight was the last night but we're
gonna be hanging around for a few more
days and tomorrow actually we are I
think I think this is the plan we're
going to Niagara Falls we might even get
to go on a helicopter ride over Niagara
Falls I think I think that's worth it
and then we're all heading off in our
different directions but we were
chatting tonight about how we can spend
more time together I think that's often
the conversation when we we do these
like group events we're always like oh
how can we how can we make sure we're
not only seeing each other like four
times a year but that we actually get to
spend my quality time hanging out a lot
more
and
yeah I think I think next year's a lots
going to change I think it's going to be
way more collaborative way more plain
bigger group trips and maybe basing up
in different places for a longer amount
of time with people that we love and
want to be spending more time with like
Steven elects hearing been in the coal
and Sawyer and Angelique like them for
me that's what we want to be doing more
of not just balancing from country to
country like every week or so like I
really want to still travel would be
based up so I can like invest more in in
the relationships of people that I care
about and also do awesome collaborative
projects with people I think that's what
I've been thinking about and that we've
been chatting about the last few days
there is a this is a lot of energy for
almost 1:30 in the morning then what are
you doing why just trying these on
alright just high heels I'm too short
that's what it is no you hanging out
with you it's all guys but is it is this
he's been on women's shoes but he says
it's the women shoes I think that is how
does it feel being that's the best
well guys it's free a.m. it's time to
sleep I found out a little bit more
about this trip tomorrow so apparently
there's no helicopters but we are doing
an epic day out and Niagara Falls I
think the zip lines and loads of stuff
is like bus loads of us going down there
and thankfully we're leaving at midday
so I'll actually get to sleep in the
morning yeah that's a wrap
but for festival 2016 tapped in the
morning peace out
enjoy life you live the adventure
