we're just trying to figure out exactly
how we're gonna do it the moment we've
just got this pan out I didn't start it
right but we're gonna do like the logo
thing and make it look good more
professional maybe maybe do a little
intro animation that having a little
snack with what's in it up
white chocolate milk chocolate
apparently Darcy made these so we
decided instead of doing like and
compute your animated intro thing for my
dad sternum we're gonna do like a
stencil thing and we're gonna do this
stencil and like get messy it's gonna be
fun
say hey guys the rice scissors against
knives is it knives or scissors like
which is quickest like we've done well
this is all got quite elaborate when we
set up the cameras and lighting and
we've cut out this lettering and we're
doing the the intro we're doing a banner
for the youth from my dad's YouTube
channel and we're just going to get it
colorful we're gonna get some pans from
cooking utensils and shot and then we're
sprinkling flour over we're gonna lift
that off and it's gonna look pretty cool
and you guys click through and go to
this channel to see the banner and then
when he releases his next video you can
see the whole intro is done so make sure

flour now I reckon come in you come in
