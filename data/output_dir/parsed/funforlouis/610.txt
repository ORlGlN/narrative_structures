and I'm in Carlsbad California and
you're watching for Louie boom good
morning guys we've just woken up we were
kept up all night that's a party nearby
and then play music to like 5:00 a.m.
but we've opened up lunch
look at the Vee isn't that just
spectacular let's go for the rest of
pasta again so good
where'd you go for today

brought my own mango to the restroom
alright it's not embarrassing
I need stay with them
mangos brilliant my favorite fruit when
I first taste it as a kid I don't really
like it I love it now toys how beautiful
this little area this is like right in
the bottom of the cliff under the B&B me
and Roy actually came down and swam here
last night this sounds crazy guys but
today's the first day in Jamaica that
I've actually felt like my mind has
rested it's been wearing it like a
million miles an hour and I know it
sounds crazy but I just haven't been
able to relax even in paradise
and we've just taken a few hours out
today just chatting about you know
probably a lot of stuff ups chat about
the other day in my in my Q&A but just
about the deeper things and things that
really matter and and just trying to
live in the moment enjoy where we are
and not be constantly thinking about
doing things and filming things and it's
been very um it's been very good for me
but we are gonna head off now I'm
feeling feeling very happy hello going
look it's a parrot
you've come into play hello hey
okay bye-bye
this is kind of where I want to live
treehouses here would be pretty amazing
than me we are heading up on this canopy
wooden plank but maybe this happening
ultimately lifts jungle lift anyway
we're heading up from one of these this
is a 20-minute ride that's nice
imagine if they forgot about us and then
just like lift us up it I wouldn't
actually than mine you see this guy's
kid even oh yeah how are you feeling
about that right no you don't like those
this is unbelievably peaceful the
leftist optimists and it focused on
gentle it's got a CD player
hey make your way to the right arrow
okay bye
there we go you ready well no I won't go
I think that is the point of bobsledding
please go eat you guys see in Cool
Runnings if you haven't you have to
watch you can't do a Cool Runnings feel
the rhythm fill the rhyme get it up it's
bobsled time oh gosh okay here we go
letting movie control is not a good idea
that with a baby oh my gosh I wasn't
expecting it to be that far was that
scary for you I kind of want to go again
we only have one right I'm also glad
that we're getting pulled back up to the
top we don't have to walk back up I like
that so for those of you that haven't
seen four runnings basically what it was
about was a Jamaican bobsled team now
obviously to make Miz in a very hot
climate so and bobsledding is more of a
Winter Olympic sport
but I found out today was that it was
actually based on a true story so I was
just reading the food over here
and it was staying that in 1992 Jamaica
became 14
the head of United States Russia France
and Italy and the two-man team can came
in 10th place so I think it was a the
movie is about like beating the odds how
they could train out here in Jamaica
with no ice and no real bobsled run and
the little thing I said at the beginning
of our of our ride was with the little
thing that they said in the movie feel
the rhythm feel the ride get on up
it's bobsled time that's I didn't want
to attempt to make an accident I'm not
very good at that look at these guys
they are serious helmets goggles yellow
this is it all dressed in lycra Cheers
having little mid-afternoon snack
hurried busy rolls habanero sauce looks
like a plantain there this is the
hummingbird garden guys neck I've never
seen a hummingbird just chillin before
yes problem that lizard is not
I could stay here all day looking at
hummingbirds but everyone's waiting for
us to leave because we're the last
people here oh look its tail
I so beautiful
look at the size of this tree it's not
necessarily its height it is its width
just so chunky and those roots as well
but just to reach those accord what are
you trying to do follow me I know a way
across the river
the Sun is set and we are now heading
down to the south of the island I don't
know what the place is called with the
bestie we're not yeah we're going like
southeast right
okay so we're heading east and rires
found this really nice area that's more
secluded and more jungly and more like
nature vibes
this is where Royce let us it looks cool
okay yeah we'll see but it looked cool
on air be okay
I am exhausted 250 stairs is much lot
more than you imagined is out here we
need to paint something on the outside
guys like these ones can you think of
something cool for us to paint how many
people from all over the world have been
there Awesome's like the global mural we
are all snuggled up in our jungle hut
guys this is like the closest thing to a
treehouse I've stayed in even though
I've been banging on about tree houses
flight years this is amazing and this is
way more legit than some of the other
places I've been staying and recently
there's a mosquito net because there's
lots of mosquitoes around also this
lizards on the ceiling which that is a
good thing because they can eat all the
mosquitoes so I'm happy about that I'll
give you a proper Hut tour tomorrow when
you can actually see stuff it is quite
dark and yeah we're going to try and
visit some like beautiful Lagoon and go
rafting and stuff tomorrow and it's it's
gonna be just brilliant and obviously in
the morning peace out
enjoy life live the adventure
you
