good morning guys we are leaving Cairo
today and we're heading to her GABA
which is on the coast it's been an
amazing time in Egypt so far yeah it's
gonna be a short flight like an hour and
a half I'm a little bit tired cut about
an hour's sleep last night yeah this has
been an incredible stay we're just
getting the plane ready now if you don't
know this is Eddie and he's been helping
us with the whole world flight people
organizing all of the all of the stops
and helping us with planning and yeah
checking safety and stuff if any of you
are planning to fly around the world
I'll link all of Eddie stuff below we're
just stickers on the plane now aviation
support
it's crazy walking amongst these plane
wrecks and just imagining the life they
used to have even this like a hot-air
balloon basket here it's just yeah it's
amazing look at it just left to rot in
the sand what's this play brand-new
engine granular power and then they're
just grounded and they couldn't even
just like sell it and get some
don't you guys see lady legend okay a
double town of ever 284 we'd like to
request the follow me car and request
start up November 2 1 as you okay any
from startup approved approve November 2
on circuit
finally on the road a gap I always get
really excited we we're about to take
off even if it's a short flight yeah the
problem for me is it doesn't matter how
long the flight is the preparation and
everything beforehand is just as long so
I longer flight yeah because they're
ultimately less working there enough
oh yeah guys if you did watch the
vloggers we flew in but ice was
explaining why we're not we have got a
wall camera for are flying in Egypt
because it just looks a bit suspicious
I think there's been problems in the
past having a how about the website a
kebab just to save ourselves a problem
alright your doors are locked
yeah your secure secure
yeah a heavy takeoff and a shallow one
ready to go let's do it fool the live
temperatures and pressures anyway and
she wants to fly
I just have this suck realization of
what we're doing again it's like flying
around the world yeah easy to forget I
think about what we were planning it's a
baby or and stuff but now we're doing it
yeah it's crazy I get those moments to
where you just forget an American evolve
just conserving I'm clear to cross over
the field November 2 1 0 a uniform alarm
clock gives you 60 0 / 9 34 13 report
reaching as there are 6-0 I think
they're a little bit optimistic about
how quickly this airplane can climb I
think they want me to be at 6,000 feet
now already barely over 2,500
I love these pads in the ground they
always look like very so much and there
may be a very very summer yeah but I
feel good as it definitely makes a
difference a friend inside
it's funny how not nervous but just
aware I've become but worth like yeah
let the moment up at the airplane I'm
just like in my oven and I just this the
stress just dissipates and I'm just in
like problem-solving focus mode and then
there are these moments when I'm just
like I'm flying a freaking aeroplane
over Egypt yeah is really close
that's very good yeah I see why you just
want to get at the end soon as possible
okay that while your brain is just in
that mode it's kind of like it's kind of
like preparing for a big competition
swimming competition yeah and then
you're in the zone and they're like oh
wait wait wait no no no you got to wait
now and then you're like sitting there
just passing 4,000 now they're literally
all these roads one by lois especially
identity can see it these words have
never been used they're brand new and
the desert is just a golfing them that's
crazy
there's so much infrastructure here that
is being used like the older housing
like it's the oldest leaves when it does
occur yeah but it's sickening if you
think about it yeah cuz there's so many
people that don't have anything that
could be living in there it's crazy how
the landscapes just changed because of
the irrigation for perfect oil like
desert field
it's literally the heart of this country
no there's no a hat that ago prior to
keep it cool could begin sir
I'm glad we got away pretty early
wasting too much time I heard today
yeah and radar November 2 of their get a
for flight level 0 9 Lord direct cross
me kind of amazing that we just like
went to Oklahoma air for plane and just
think about it like I was sitting there
this airplane felt like the strangest
thing in the world what everything cuz
of the panel configuration everything
was different I might never get the
chance to do this again I think got a
lot over time I I go to places with the
expectation that I'll be back you know
like I don't have more time to absorb
this but I might never get the chance to
do this again look agent or this fly
around the world like you know buying
these also places there's November to
one very acute afore were quite
deceptive it's about a thousand each
change was either one team whatever that
face is resting country to fly to obey
they brought me is definitely blowing
our brain my brain let there then I was
one for me the interesting floor going
over the tropical I think it do could be
of a pretty amazing it will be amazing
but if yeah Thailand Malaysia Indonesia
will be the worst stressful for me yeah
make a little weather and I think
they'll be very hazy and humid it where
it won't be like her it won't be like
reasonable joke or it yeah that'll be
hard work for me the most fun will be
Australia yeah especially if we have a
bit of time to kill there this idiot is
take me so far out now I have my landing
gear on but I cool
former turn left heading zero-niner-zero
business and three two thousand feet
left heading sir dancer on a 2003 firm
having the runway in sight sir that's
affirmative husband our website de
barbarac all uniform clear for left hand
visual approach on which before let's
continue descent circuit my altitude and
pushed our 19th is nothing only tower
tighty desmos exactly for the visual 3/4
light 3/4 and they've got a ground I've
ever - I'm sorry uniform over at Victor
6 Thunder - 104 more get a ground state
she has cleared hold short runway 3 4 3
4 follow me car inside which is such a
big Airport we can literally do by the
time it gets takes us to get there I
could literally take off the land oh
yeah and these donkeys we're with a
fighter jet so yeah yeah cause we're
probably winco's there I take the
counter downer yep ok
always we're signing out we'll catch you
on the other side we've made it to her
gutter we're just about to jump in the
taxi and head to the hotel
right
as you can see with this pink in the
room the whole night ordering room
service and I've just had a nice
relaxing bath whilst my videos been
rendering but unfortunately the overflow
of the bath isn't connected properly so
I completely flooded our hotel room like
the whole bathroom the whole floor out
here and this isn't ideal
anyway that's been my evening we've got
dips lessly early staff we go outside
yeah we've got and we've got to get up
her five no we've got to leave here at
5:00 a.m. so probably get up like 4:30
and it's JP said the longest flight we
have yet yeah we've got a direct flight
all the way from Egypt in the East Coast
where we are now to the UAE Abu Dhabi
we're gonna be flying over Saudi Arabia
and we've chosen not to stop there for a
fuel break as it's like extra paperwork
and landing fees and stuff JP did say
however that if if the winds are bad and
we get headwind we may have to divert to
Bahrain and do a fuel stop there but
it's $1,000 to as there like a handling
fee or landing for your waiver so
hopefully we can avoid that yeah it's
it's it's definitely we've definitely
entered a whole new phase of the trip
and like I was saying earlier today I
feel just this sudden sense of
excitement again and I think coming
through Europe the excitement kind of
dropped a little bit from how it was
when we first departed but yeah I'm
excited again and yeah I cannot wait I
feel like this next these next few
countries there's so many unknown kind
of factors and I think that's what I
love about it I think I love that
there's yeah there's all this some
uncertainty or or I guess kind of
unknown stuff
right I'll capture a few hours guys
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
