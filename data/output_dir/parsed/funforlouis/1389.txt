so you remember a few weeks ago when I
got arrested as I landed in Heathrow
scored off the plane at least well today
is the court date which I managed to
rearrange so I'm going into court today
and my get convicted of something but
probably not I hopefully I can
get out
although sunny yesterday and now it's
gray and drizzly again I'm strolling
down to court rooms now I probably won't
be able to bring my camera in with me
I'll probably confiscate as I go in the
door so
so I'm not allowed to film any of this
it says I'm going to get sent to prison
if I do so I just sat there for three
hours
with nothing to do and then they turn
around they're like oh yeah can you come
back in another two hours just got some
tricky fish chips to cheer me up all
right let's try this again shall we
it took me like five minutes to stand in
front of the judge and talk to him and
be like hey man this is all being a big
mistake but they liked me they kind of
let me off I've just got to go to the
police station now and get them to let
me off I'm here at the police station
and we're going and see if I can
straighten everything out okay they're
now saying I need to go back down to the
court to deal with it there I'm not
criticizing the whole legal system in
the UK but my experience has not been
great right back in court now they
things to be thinking I switched up my
camera but they're now saying no I can't
get it sorted I have to come back to
court like in a month which is a
nightmare because I've got the valid
insurance which is the problem they
didn't have that now back again to the
police station
this is crazy
that's everything I can deal with today
some paperwork's gone off to the traffic
processing place I have no idea but it
has well now earlier today and I'm
usually very patient things
I don't know I then think like I guess
I'm privileged to be part of a
relatively just legal system and there's
probably quite corrupt governments in
legal systems in the world and England's
not that bad I guess so go be quite
it's nice to be home I'm going to hang
out with Josh tonight hopefully Josh
record some of you may know him
