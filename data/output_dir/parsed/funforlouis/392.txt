good morning guys I don't know what day
of our trip is a completely lost track
of time because we don't have any access
to the Internet
I'm not carrying the phone around most
the time it's kind of surreal to be
honest but I'm loving it and we are down
a speech and we're about to go in there
try and do some surf lessons although
it's very very still water that's
coaster so the aim today is to try and
get some of these local kids on the surf
boards be awesome I guess these are kind
of North Korean tourists that come from
other areas down to the beach I think
that's what the boy
ah
I want to welcome you to the 2016 DPRK
surfing catmoj amigos
you are very special and very unique in
the history of the world because now
surfing is going to be introduced to
your beautiful nation of DPRK and so we
want to say thank you
surfing started in Hawaii and it
finished in DPRK but nobody remembers
the middle only the first place in the
last place right
we hope that surfing brings peace to
Korea so we're happy to be here and
thank you so much for joining us

it all starts before the fun begins
everyone is hiding under the umbrella
because it is scorching today

tried to buy a well I tried to fire a
tomato right and they didn't understand

offer them and they kept on saying
something to me and then they just let
me take the tomato for free so I have
this like big tomato which I'm going to
munch on I don't really understand why

you're gonna go and jump on like
absolutely amazing amazing yeah so good
but it's funny
we just had a dance-off with North
Korean military on the beach this trip
is just getting crazier and crazier I
can that's one of the best experiences
of my life I figure it all right we are
having a barbecue on the beach now for
dinner I don't know this are there any
vegetarian options here was this all
meat
I think it's all meat guys Doris one of
the girls in the group brought
marshmallows all the way from Hawaii and
we are tucking in you can't make um
s'mores because they don't there's any
bring graham crackers although I have
got chocolate boy no way yeah my room oh
but I'm going to tuck into this body ah
wow that's a good stuff we're back from
our little barbecue on the beach it's
time to go to sleep we've got a very
early morning we're actually starting
6:00 a.m. lesser thing would be the
whole cliff surfer culture is people get
up so early to go and find surf and the
reality is that's probably going to be
no surf but the guides that we're kind
of teaching wanted to do it before the
Sun gets too hot because a few people
got sunburned today so we're going to go
do that and hopefully get some sleep
later in the day tomorrow but it's yeah
it's going to be painful getting up
tomorrow morning but it's going to be so
worth it I think we had a real
breakthrough today with getting past
that kind of formal barrier that there's
been so far on the trip with us and the
local North Koreans and there's just so
much fun and playing games and falling
off the surfboards and laughter and
messing around and dancing I don't know
I just thought it was yeah a very
special day today and I feel very
privileged to be part of this trip where
we're literally making history as things
happening there but net this has never
happened before some of these things so
well catching the morning piece out into
a life live adventure
