miracle when it rains there's like bring

continuing it's like raining again
outside there's still lightning and
stuff as well is it a taste explosion in
your mouth yeah so this is like a slab
of chocolate with the day on top and
then the almond bones were
go ahead I've been standing out here
trying to shoot slow-mo the lightning
and the lightning bolt hit just hit this
building right in front of us all the
lights just went out and we are I'm like
literally shaking I thought I feel I've
been shot it was so loud oh I don't
think I've ever been that close to
lightning bolt that was just crazy
on full-on shaking I'm actually feeling
the fusebox must have just got trips and
then they just put it back on this is so
crazy
question is where is the lightning gonna
strike next
as we back home and it's been a really
chill day but really nice especially to
see Ben I know he's having a rough time
right now at this elbow and recovering
and I want to spend a lot of time with
him I also who want to try and get more
regular vlogs I know I've been pretty
sporadic but I wonder you I guess I'm
trying to adjust to like having a base
now and having waking up in the same
place every day and some of the days
aren't we're not going out and doing
exciting things every day I'm like just
getting on with some work we're doing
things like no working out and just
trying to bring more I don't know just
just working on my kind of itself like
I've said just my fitness and just
getting some routine and but I will I
know not all of you interested in that
part of my life by will actually show
you in the coming weeks just some
day-to-day stuff I'm doing now like my
routine it sounds weird saying that
words cuz I literally haven't had any
for five years but this is a new journey
for me and I'll try and take you guys
along I don't find a lot of it
particularly inspirational to like vlog
about but I guess this is my life right
now so I'm going to vlog about some of
it and don't worry there's some exciting
trips and traveling and friends coming
over to South Africa and loads of stuff
I will be vlogging but it's just quiet
right now which is okay anyway I will
catch you guys probably not tomorrow
because it's Valentine's Day and I'm
taking the day off Araya but probably
the next day peace out into a life and
live the adventure
