he hasn't had an email saying that his
fees has been processed or anything who
because we're leaving on Friday I'm
needing to go back for both of us to get
our passports tomorrow
I'm so happy and I think it's suddenly I
thought we screwed the trip I think Dave
suddenly thought maybe maybe it's
possible he's got email notifications
and I didn't yeah so we've had quite a
few difficulties organizing this trip
primarily not posting to Nigeria and
having to change to different country
but I think it's all good I mean we're
still gonna hit some hiccups I'm
expecting some things to go wrong oh
yeah but that's still fun but it
wouldn't be a problem solving

our own problems Dave is hitting bad
story yes bro I sleep tomorrow we'll go
and pick our passports up you know visas

like
and I've got like stomach cramps and
feeling a bit nauseous so I might have
to have a little lie-down for like half
an hour and then figure out a plan
probably drive back up to sorry tonight
yeah it's not nice when you feel like
this so I just spent the last three
hours asleep
Althea's those house trying to recover
from whatever illness I have
I thought the best course of action
would be to drive back to my parents
while some still conscious I did not
feel good
I don't seem to have recovered at all I
can't really a I feel really sick hoping
I'm not coming down with anything too
serious
it's kind of sad I would love to hang
