hey guys I'm an app and right now I'm
cycling in the seaside town of Hastings
and you're watching ancillary boom good
afternoon guys today is a special day we
are joining with millions of people
around the world to make a stand against
climate change so basically this week in
Paris I was telling you about this
little yes and yesterday's vlog this
week in Paris a lot of the major
governments around the world
I'm meeting to talk about how to tackle
climate change and to make some
commitments to that and people all
around the world are gathering today
wherever they are in whichever city to
stand up and say we care about this and
we want to make a difference so we've
come down to LA City Hall and we're
joining with this crowd to have a little
rally climate change rally this is
Isabel and I just stopped her because I
like this sign keep fossil fuels in the
ground
and I know a lot of you probably think
me of a hypocrite because I do use
fossil fuels and I fly although over the
place but I'm so open for alternatives
for the flame fuel maybe for Southern
Open and also I think my traveling
hopefully for you guys could help you
fall in love with the world a little bit
more and what to protect it and find
alternatives
that's the journey of on and I pick it
out here
so my plan this week was to actually be
in Paris to the March but because of the
attack that happened like a few weeks
ago they they canceled all public
marching and demonstrating and stuff so
so I thought I'd stay in LA and just
join in here and because it really
doesn't matter where you guys are around
the world making some kind of stand
making some kind of step towards being
these kind of things resolved is
important and like I said I'm not even
there yet I've got a long way to go with
doing my part but I think if we can just
just start the journey I think that's
what's important and this is this is a
good thing to represent today for me I
like Singapore welcome I fear to be here
together with you
our future is abundant our future is
peaceful our future is our it only
applies to change every day right now
our leaders have a chance to set the
long-sighted goals to change the course
of humanity and if anyone ever
questioned the existence of climate
change by saying I am NOT a scientist
then respond this way that is why you
should listen to 97% of scientists who
are telling us in Los Angeles most
people do not know their neighbors most
of us do not know the people who live
next door to us or down the street half
a block we are maybe the most alienated
city in probably the most alienated
society on this planet and all of the
consumer goods all of the waste of
resources all of the investment and
material things has taken place at the
expense of our relationship to each
other as human beings
alright the speeches have finished we're
joining with everyone now we're gonna
March another where we're going but this
is this is kinda like the first rally of
ever
a tipster happens to be in LA right now
individuals that feel like they make a
difference spare parts to leave no
probably idea by a few hundred people by
I always see these kind of things on the
knees but never be that it's interesting
things are less because I don't think
many people saw this much other than you
guys watching and turn the news outlets
showed it but in itself I don't know how
much of the difference this makes but I
think it's very symbolic and I think
it's cool to draw people together and
realize that they're not alone there's a
people earth came along today that
weren't planning to but they still wait
we into snapchat about what's happening
and yeah it's nice nice to be people has
some good conversations and
and yeah it's all about connecting with
people enlighten me
guys this is Nick he watched my videos
and he came down today to say hi and
hang out and meet up with Phil if going
get some food I also got given a rose
today which is nice
hey thanks for the rice one of the girls
in it gave it to me this is where we
going guys so Jen what we ordered on the
menu was this thing where she just keeps
from bringing out loads of food we were
worried to begin with but I think it's
looking good now we're getting enough I
don't even know where everything is I'm
just going with this chocolate orange
cake this this is amazing so spend the
whole evening in the apartment with Nick
Nash and we actually watched The Cove
which is the documentary about dolphin
slaughter in Japan which was a bit of an
ayah and kind of ties on from the rest
of today for me which has been about the
environment and global warming but for
me that all ties in with the planet and
the life on the planet including all the
wildlife and that's wise in with this
journey Aman trying to live more
sustainably and ethically it's a massive
journey I'm gonna be honest and I know
like I'm saying earlier there's lots of
ways I can improve
I would love actually some feedback
because I've been really wracking my
brain today about how can I
to actively choose to live with a
smaller carbon footprint now I know
you're going to say stop flying
everywhere but realistically the life of
Chosun the opportunities I've got to
travel share my travels with you guys
and make a difference in a bigger way I
I'm gonna keep flying now I would love
some real advice about other ways I can
you know and not like not like
ridiculous ideas because it could be
like oh we could have walked home
instead of getting an uber but I would
have taken five hours so I I genuinely
think like transport is the biggest way
that I'm I'm contributing to global
warming but there may be other things
I'm not aware of so anyway if you guys
are more research than me I would love
some feedback and some stuff if you
cleave in the comments just some ideas I
will be talking quite a bit about this
stuff over the next couple of weeks and
answering back and like a discussion
with you guys as well about it because
this does mean a lot to me and it's the
first time in my life that I'm really
adamant I want to make some changes in
my life so as things unfold over the
next couple of weeks in Paris and
governments making commitments to things
and maybe revealing I was reading an
article saying they're going to be
revealing new initiatives and
technologies and stuff like that they're
gonna tackle climate things I'm sure
I'll be talking about those things
anyway so that's that's what's been on
my mind tonight I'm just thinking a lot
about the world we live in and my impact
on it and how I can help and be a better
global citizen and a better human being
and then another subject and something
I'd love your opinion on and I said I
would keep you involved with this a lot
you fed back the other day that you
enjoyed being kept in this the story of
story the app so you enjoyed the
feedback and being involved in what's
half
so I just got one question for you I'm
not gonna bore you any longer be talking
for what
go on question for you do you think
there is room in your life for another
video social media app and if so what's
missing from current social media video
apps where yeah like what's missing and
what would you love to have as someone
that wants to make potentially and wants
to watch short-form videos on your phone
so let me know in the comments if you've
got any suggestions or ideas or things
that we haven't done yet on the app if
you've had a look at the app or you
haven't looked at it and you're just
like no I'd really love this in my life
or this would be a cool thing to have
just anything any ideas would be awesome
like I said I'd love to include you guys
on this whole journey so we're still in
the process of building something and I
want you to build it with me and Nick
and that like I'm gonna get some sleep
and we are leaving here tomorrow we're
gonna go move in with Jesse and Jeana
for the night at their Airbnb down the
road peace out enjoy life live the
adventure
