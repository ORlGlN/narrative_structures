domestics like right I've arrived at
Newark Airport New York I think I've
been to the 3rd or in year remember but
I need to jump them over now to this man

Escalade eval we've all five hours in

hours of training
I've arrived in Manhattan just about the

minutes say I'm impressed
yeah so we do all the guys from B&H and
we're gonna be looking through a lot of
the gear we're going to be using on the
trip I know I'm so excited just like
Christmas
how you doing bro it's been a
rollercoaster of a mile today I haven't
been updating every whim you been I've
been blogging a little bit of it for the
movies probably been the toughest
toughest two months of my this is one of
the important documents one of many
important documents this is your
Canadian flying license right it's my
Canadian with all the ratings and
everything we need to fire on the way
now we just need to convert that to
American but we'll explain that later
okay this is it this is the big guy Wow
that's contact Wow yeah very
exciting I can't rule the gear over here
this is going to be our audio we haven't
tested this yet but these the wireless
lav mics and then we're just going
through over here looking at the lenses
and tagore these SD card so me where's
the bad boy Island in here this is the
2.8 70 to 200 this lens does the same
length but the quality the different
guys so this is a 24 to 240 so you'll
get the same zoom assistance to Bonnie
but this this goes up to like six points
five six one three aperture to the
quality Christian earth and depth of
field didn't incredible on that and a
low-light okay Prince this is the audio
activating to give a little rundown I
love you this yeah
I'm on the list clogged in death and to
hear about or into your recorder oh yeah
will you turn them on you turn these on
they really manage the automatically
pinky for their pair very accurate and
impaired in doing that we can't mix them
up and then where would you click play
we do such da da no I'm listening to
their the zoom a stick little you that I
think that was a picture enjoy being
used to using me instead an estimate
Barry we're just learning about the fs5
camera which is going to give you going
to get a quality it depends you can set
up that to have all the leader on the
area you have to or you can just do okay
we are wrapping up while training for
today my mind is like overloaded it was
information this is all the gears
ringing now it's out of this box it
depart from the microphone yes it sounds
about all of the adding gap inside ok
we're going to jump in to be an h2 store
just have a little ones around the get
excited I always get really tight beam
it
I'm going to try not to buy him anything
back on the 12 to 24 I'm just showing JP
what how why did expect well 24 I think
this is a cocktail every rhythm music
music a pill the disordered humility
stretches of the edges like this but I
think you get those views out the window
than any wide Lyle and cake shop guys
it's quite a light way as well some of
the lenses are taken are heavy yeah this
is the lens guide so you master then we
feel like that polite isn't it I know
it's so light okay got a few little
things from being H and now we're
heading to check into our hotel I'm
pretty tired I'm pretty tired we might
have a little rest remember thinking of
downloading a few cool documentaries get
some ideas for the world's site and the
way we're going to film it if you've got
any suggestions at all documentaries
where we can get some ideas not so much
the filming style but more like the
storytelling elements last over live and
yeah we want to make it original we want
to do our own thing but taking
inspiration from other documentaries is
going to be a war
all right me and JP distorted $50 of
Indian food be generous $100 oh yeah
$150 each yeah okay we marked we flushed
out belly oh we sit down and we are
watching documentaries to get my dears
this is Craigslist Joe a guy surviving
just by time two people meet people on
Craigslist I think it's funny that we're
watching dr. Mario to learn how to make
them yeah
yet we're so deep into making my bird
well at major events um has any training
and helping it's a good chance that all
right we've just come out the hot tub
it's been very relaxing evening and
being JP have been having some cool
discussions around other nice just the
trip and logistics and sharing I don't
know fears and the challenges we're
going to have and but just also how
pumped we are to be able to share this
whole journey with you guys and yeah I
can't wait to get underway three weeks
time we're leaving and in two weeks
so after this New York trip from heading
up to France is going to be a wedding
then I'm going back to the UK for a week
but then I'm coming back to yes start
preparing we're going to get the plane
ready as you know I think a couple of
months ago we bought bought the plane
and Oklahoma finally all the paperwork's
gone through and JP's managed to get
everything you need so it insurance you
know we had to stop her owners trust
basically loads of red tape and
important things which obviously is an
important thing we're buying a plane so
it's going to be difficult
anyway it's all through it and now the
time to get excited and start start
getting some dates in and solidifying
our plans and including you guys a bit
more and yeah and in then we're off I
cannot wait honestly I think this is the
most excited I've ever been for like one
project or trip I've ever been on
so hopefully you guys are as well also
look how cool this place is can you
believe this is in man Han this is so
epic
it's like courtyards in our hotel
I love it right I'm going to go get some
rest now in preparation for tomorrow
we're going to have another intense day
of learning and yeah hopefully being
able to put all those skills into the
content we end up creating and yeah
storytelling still making these are all
skills all to improve on so I can make
better content and make a cool
documentary JB right I'll catch in the
morning things down enjoy life and if
