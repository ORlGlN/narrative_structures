hey there my name is Luka I'm from Fort
Lauderdale Florida I'm currently in Lake
Tahoe California and you're watching fun
- Louie boom good afternoon guys
happy new year its 2017 I'm excited
about this year it's gonna be great I am
back in putney right now and we were in
Oxford for New Year's Eve as he saw so
we drove back this morning and me and
Andy thinking about taking kayaks out
into the river we have got our boat but
he's misplaced the key for the engine
it's good to take some kayaks out for an
hour or so and just have a little bit
fun
perfect we're talking guys that's a good
fit
what we'd realize guys is because the
kayaks aren't actually attached is I'm
gonna need to hold and so they don't
slide out the back of the car
about these paddles well they just clip
together
okay what you saying get in sideways
and we're off which ways we head left
alright I think we're going this way
and they checked the tides on his phone
the way over and he's saying that the
tide is going in so we can head kind of
west towards Barnes and then getting it
over back to Andy's car and then go
collect the kayaks this is where Andy
parked it along some somewhere along
here when he the water table basically
submerged his whole car a few months ago
but I don't think we're at risk of
happening today so I think their tide
starts going out again for those who
they don't know the Thames is a tidal
river but because it's going out again
in about an hour I think it's pretty
much static at the moment so we haven't
really got a lot of current to carry us
but don't worry we're strong you be
risky
good look at the sky help me
did you hear the crowds just behind me
here is full of football club sullen
stadium I don't know what you called it
but the match going on and yeah it's a
lot of enthusiasm cheering I don't know
who's playing I don't really follow
football very excited
we're going under our first bridge this
is the one I always take my
double-decker car all my cameras
I've probably got four and of technology
but that's not water
such a beautiful sunset I'm so glad we
got on the river now apparently we can't
be out here after dark so we need to get
to the place where we're trying to get
to before we get to hold on so
apparently we're almost at our
destination and I thought as well as
jumping in the hot tub tonight it'd be
nice to book in a massage they I'm gonna
call this massage place and see if
they're open today cos is a bank holiday
New Year's Bank Holiday Monday how are
you are you open today do you have any
availability tonight for a massage for
two of us yeah me and my friend six
o'clock yeah
good man yeah yeah but we can still be
in the same rooms fine all right
yeah success well we made it we lift the
kayaks there and and he's just ordered
an uber and we probably can't put the
kayaks in the uber so I think we're
gonna go back get his car and then come
and pick him up
all right back at Andy's car luckily the
toy didn't go up any more than it has
where were you parts when it went under
long hear this so I did the road and it
went fully under Wow so the tide must
come up too like they're all secure 100%
secure
well guys tonight has absolutely flown
by we have we got back from the massage
what's the movie got some takeout Wagga
mamas and then me and Andy sat in the
hot tub about three hours
having yeah a good old heart-to-heart
reminiscing from our childhood days yeah
it was very nice like I said before it's
just very good to be somewhere where you
care about people and you can just I
don't know just stop and rest little bit
less hectic than being back with my
family it's been really nice staying
here Veronica one of Andy's guests from
Barbados cooked me some carrots and
potatoes yeah it's just it's just really
nice I am however leaving here tomorrow
I'm picking up Muraya from the airport
in the morning I'm very excited to see I
haven't seen her in like 10 days which
isn't very long considering we used to
like spend like more than a month or two
apart but it's getting harder to spend
time apart yeah so I'm excited for that
we're gonna get a little air B&B in
Brighton for a few days before the live
the adventure travel summit we're gonna
be making big travel plans for the year
and just you know starting the year with
some momentum
I think that's what I'm most looking
forward to is getting things in the
diary you know sometimes you just need
to get some things in the diary or the
calendar to have something to look
forward to or to feel like you're making
progress so I think the more cool little
trips and events you can you can book in
the better as a kid I always used to do
that I always used to just need one trip
away even it was in like six months time
just to have something to live for and
look forward to so alright I should
probably get dressed because I'm just
standing here tripping on the floor in
my towel it is freezing tonight by the
way guys the hot tub water went from 40
degrees and when we took the cover off
its dropped all the way down to 37
because it's icy outside anyway I will
catch you in the morning
for another day in 2017 let's do this
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
