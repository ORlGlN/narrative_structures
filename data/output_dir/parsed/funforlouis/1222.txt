patti-anne Tecna and I'm like the whole
work from my jockey bag and you're
watching but we well we've got less than
an hour before landing in Dubai
and it has been a lovely flight I've
just been learning what it is to be
enjoyed
I'll go over the case they're just be
taking some polaroid photos together
yeah
ladies and gentlemen we have arrived to
Al Maktoum International Airport where
the local time is 16 degrees centigrade
and the local time is 6 o'clock in the
morning so this is crazy guys we would
divert it to another airport because of
weather conditions and now we're just
sitting in the plane waiting here and
then we're real refueling and eventually
flight back to Dubai
regarding weather and a lot of versions
of other aircrafts there are quite some
unknowns we expect to know more in about
1 hour from now all right they've open
the door to show us fog outside it's
crazy
this
definitely not flying conditions
so we were just hanging out on the plane
waiting when I was going to happen there
13:30 aircraft into here waiting to land
there's also some radar fluctuations
there a drop drop with the radar do i
right we've been seeing this runway for
like three or four hours now and they've
resorted sir I think feeding people baby
food that's the last food left on the
whole plane crazy
so after four hours responding impacted
by and I have no idea what their
connecting flights doing I may have
missed we're finally on the runway
Wow finally
disembark from the play as a man is a
massive play
so change of plan couldn't make my
friend for breakfast obviously because
it's like 11:30 and Rudy to get off the
plane at like 6:00 a.m. so I'm now
trying to find out what happened about
my flight to Nairobi which was due to
take off an hour ago obviously because
of all the risk of puffle I did I can
make it I don't know whether that's been
delayed but I'm going to find out this
is what I need connections this is
craziness guys everything's been delayed
like all the flights have been delayed
turns out I did miss my flight to
Nairobi we can get to the gate and time
I just spent our two or three hours
waiting in a line to reboot my tickets
for a later flight so that's all but now
and finally go getting to eat
I'm so hungry time for some lunch
hello
thank you I've managed to nap full white
seeds a whole row now I'm gonna sleep so
good do apologize for his delay there is
a knock-on effect from weather bad
weather this morning
welcome to Jamaica a timeshare 14a
yes Kenya well after what seems like
days of traveling I finally arrived in
Nairobi Kenya I had a good sleep on that
last flight I slept like the whole
flight I had four chairs slave out gone
and now I'm just hoping that the luggage
actually arrived here all the way from
Australia which I very much doubt
considering I miss my flight guys it
actually arrives my bag actually arrives
I'm just amazed
still wait for my petit boys
so my skateboards arriving tomorrow I
filled in a lost baggage for and now I'm
getting a SIM card a Kenyan simple

Andy and him and the rest of the team
are in town at bar and I think I'm just
going to chill here and get some rest
because I'm a zombie from those flights

driving to your town called Nakuru and
