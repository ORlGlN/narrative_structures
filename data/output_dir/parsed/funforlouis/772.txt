idea it is just afternoon we've had a
bit of a lion and amazingly the guest
house was staying has lent us a car to
go to town for breakfast
so in jpr heading in and we're also
going to try and fax the this paperwork
we need to get over to the Namibian what
is it air space whatever they are
whoever controls us flying into Namibia
they apparently don't haven't heard of
email so they only work with fax
machines until VIX is crazy but it's the
latest slightly sign hopefully can get
it all sorted out in the next few hours
and have an update
what's going on we finally found the fax
machine they're trying to send it to
Namibia now the reason they're so you
want answers
yeah that sound dude oh my good hello
buddy yeah most of you guys would have
never heard that sample but that is
dial-up internet sounds that's the
people that are a little bit older than
teenagers nowadays you have to used to
use the internet on your phone line how
great is that fax fax machines cool
what's going on JP recruit well the
facts worked in a way they haven't so
they just need to look through the form
and approve it yeah yeah and then it all
goes to well all go to plan we head up
tomorrow tomorrow morning for this thing
hopefully yeah I like that you can't get
too much of a good thing yes coffee all
right this is called a stellenbosch
combo burger beef and chicken this is
something crazy
I don't think I've ever had a beef and
chicken burger before you ready for this
JP taking these foods on his lunch break
just chilling in the wheelbarrow yes
rocks we have finished our lunch and we
picked up some shoes I got some
flip-flops kind of sandal things JC got
some trainers all right come into some
outdoors shops yeah buy some things
because we are going outdoors on some
missions got these guns probably I need
done might need a little penknife I was
looking at these hats but the biggest
happen finds this one and it's only XL I
need triple Connie doubling so next on
the lift is a audio adapter so we can
record conversations so you guys can
hear what we're talking about in the
plane so reply tomorrow morning
hopefully we need a little adapter come
into this like electrical music
second-hand shops so see we can find
something yeah this is it we need needs
to be this split into two of these isn't
it
I think we're in luck this is like this
is like a pressure test needs to go into
the jack yeah and then one goes into my
headset and then run go into the iPhone
right yes I think we have all the
business is a voice recording we have
all the bits we need nice your phone can
you just lift chief he's checking up in
the application
sorry just progressed you ladies on the
fight repeat that pretty
sorry Charlie okay yeah so what do I do
with that member sorry I've never done
this but I've never done this before
I've never gone through the process of
overflights I have no idea what that
number does this is new to both of us oh
it's so funny so Elise he had some idea
from kind of I have to know how do you
get approval to fly into a country it's
nuts
yeah you know if we don't have approval
where the Air Force will come and screw
us down to a runway and arrest us so
this is very important so yeah we're in
I guess we're in we have permission yeah
you don't know you guess I need your
phone because I've never done this
before so yeah so give us a little
update JP
looks like we got a permission show - if
you'll cut it babe
what kind of looks like maybe we can do
it maybe we've got a number we're only
going to get arrested
we're only going to go rest of it we
don't have the right stuff we've tuned
it in all but got a number but we don't
have any paperwork we have services we
are quickly nipping out to catch the
sunset some sets so earlier guys like
before 6 p.m. it's a bit of a shock to
the system because up in the northern
hemisphere where England and America and
stuff has been sitting a lot layer so
we're gonna try and make most of it
let's chase the Sun JP let's chase the
Sun all right so we're getting a
document - so we're good oh and getting
a document yeah fax apparently we don't
need it but we're getting it emailed but
we meant it
brilliant brilliant ok so guys it looks
like we also sorted on the permission
front with the Namibian stuff we don't
want to take risks on that do not want
to end up in a minute in Namibian prison
although it would be quite an adventure
it may be there bro maybe just this
that'll do
well the Sun went down very very quickly
like 5:45 that's get nod we're not sure
what we're doing tonight we probably
find something fun today and then I
think first thing in the morning we've
only got two hour flight to do tomorrow
but I think first thing in the morning
to make the most of the day we'll head
off guys Jamie's going to show us
something
see this massive palm tree the end of
the road well apparently that isn't a
palm tree you can see the stuff inside
of it it's a telephone mast look at that
that is basically what gives us Internet
guys look closely that isn't a palm tree
it's got like little satellite dishes in
it and stuff it's a completely fake palm
tree in the middle of the desert that's
awesome Wow
it's completely baked Vodacom yeah look
we can see the steel that is crazy
reading a Bible it's wide-angle lens
ten millimeter lens and it's got some
scratches on the lens because like most
of our cameras I don't put my lens comes
on but just read that toothpaste get the
scratches down so I'm doing a little
experiment
with toothpaste time to get a toothbrush
out this might go over ever kid it's
going to be ultrasonic sounds like a
dings I do sadly creating for the phone
if this works then I'm impressed at how
well it can party as well maybe you
should like press a real hard I don't
know maybe it'll require like a few
times you know a few tries but I'll be
able to tell whether it's helped in a
little bit did it work no can work at
all it's still just as scratched hmm oh
it's fun
smells good now yeah so that's nice and
minty today we got this hair into
wonderful after a few hours of laptop
Club and Instagram editing stuff we're
ready to go up dinner
BJP base both feel a bit weird because
we just had some interesting coffee and
it's less it's a little bit shaky I
don't know what this coffee is but it's
crazy coffee
guys JP just got an email through with
all the official paperwork so we are now
clear to fly legal legal we're legal to
fly and if they stop us to arrest us we
can show them that well they ordered a
big burger and I have got two burgers

different buns so I guess I guess I've
got a little lot of eating today JB went
