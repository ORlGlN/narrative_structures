so I've been driving all night it was
kind of like sleeping in a in a bumpy
sauna
then blend upon its family one place to
be or on the roofs that are sorghum Dena
it's possibly the most uncomfortable
night I've ever experienced
they're not getting either
terrific yeah but now on the roof
getting a bit of suntan get some breeze
and it's actually the leaf bumpy play so
this is this is amazing
oh I had one of those moments last night
where I was like I cannot believe with a
credible such a unique experiences like
just fun of it all
they really spend the rest of the
journey
we are stuck in the most insane traffic
and I think we probably get my somber
Jackie's been have gone back down into
the truck this is art this is awesome I
tell him the good news
so we just got a call from them because
we basically had 20 hours in the roads
and had no hotel today put some money
aside and getting five-star hotels and
when we on policy with some plan for the
replacement he fell pointing to that
that was all the best things in the work
so very happy
till eight bad he's done menthol that'd
be a good idea but now it's not going to
get Tamera nasty with us today so he
decided to jump down from the lorry and
get in the cab because we're going to
die of sunstroke otherwise it's quite
hot on the top but it's been an
incredible ride so far we have no
windscreen and we have a one-armed
driver
that's the way they roll in India
