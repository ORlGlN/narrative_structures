I have left
man Alan's and now heading out to my
parents to pick up a few things and get
some stuff and then may grab some lunch
and I think the plan is I'm gonna head
up to London to see my sister Hillary
today because she's not feeling too well
and she's asked me to come a visit by
I'm in Cabo
I just spent about two hours in
different banks from the south of the
cattle and it's an absolute nightmare
but it's all sorted now and I am mean
met out with my friend leek you haven't
seen in probably over a year Express so
I got my sloppy Giuseppe get some chili
oil and that guy and then throw up the
lunch I'm heading up to London
see
I've been driving for an hour listening
to some jungle music love in the jungle
and I'm about 20 minutes from my
sister's house
see this bridge here four point two
meters high my butt can't fit underneath
that bridge and back in a day like maybe
a year or two ago I remember driving
this route and having to stop and look
at the height and realize and then had
to reverse up and tell my bus her out
well she's only have like three times
but luckily didn't hit the bridge don't
have to worry with things like that with
Rodney Hillary hail and we've wondered
down the road we're trying to find
someone to go out for a coffee or a
little just sit down for a little patch
up
and then state places with enough
we're gonna stay outside with if the
weather is actually nice it's raining a
little bit earlier we decided to get the
bus back a little bit of a walk we're
gonna swing past this awesome thanks
guys
Oh Kendall as well thanks Adam
I like the colorful candles all right
finished dinner and I just been on my
computer a little bit me and Hillary and
Adam is go for a little wandering with
some live music down the road and I just
walking along the pavement and spotted
this carpet this lovely carpet look at
this nice copper in the floor ah you are
so considerate just making the world a
better place to leave the car Farrah
well that was such a nice evening with
Hilary and Adam I am now in a bit of a
mission to find internet because I
actually haven't uploaded my vlog yet
which I I've been trying to do all night
I just haven't that get internet so I'm
not really sure where to go right I've
driven up to Covent Garden is this is
the nearest place I can think of those
got superfast internet I'm just thankful
now one Dutch my son stays in London and
I walk past Covent Garden
tube station is closed but look at this
notice they've drawn out the whiteboard
it's a reference from the Big Bang
Theory I think
so I wondered around a little bit and I
was gonna go to a jazz night and then I
was like I'm quite enjoying wandering
around aimlessly I know that sounds
strange but we're just kind of like
taking it in and don't know it's just
really peaceful not having any agenda
and just strolling around London also I
think next I'm gonna bring a nice camera
maybe do a little late night photo walk
or something but look I've come to now
is it's just literally right opposite
the London Eye and you can climb over
this wall here by this Monument and you
can walk right down to the to the river
loop down these stairs
don't know you can see this hang on this
is really nice
guys I just stopped off my way home I
wanted to show you this really cool
place which I felt for a while it'd be
really cool to live somewhere like this
it's called tide lake village and it's
all these really cool boats and the
river I like tucked away look I've got
like trees growing on them and there's
this whole community of people living
right in the river and it's awesome
well turned out to be quite children
today I really enjoyed walking down
London tonight they I am I don't often
walk on my own and have that much
thinking time but it was is actually
awesome and I'm looking forward to the
weekend catch you guys tomorrow
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
