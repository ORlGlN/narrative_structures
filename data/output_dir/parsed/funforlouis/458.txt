good morning guys we just arrived in a
little town called Hilo it's towards the
other side of the island we are heading
out today to do a hike up a volcano and
I'm hoping later on we'll actually see
the glow of the lava because it's an
active volcano so we're going to get
some snacks get a coffee and then carry
on the drive we've just arrived at the
most active volcano in the world this is
our tour guide Marcus is going to take
us around so just been told most of
these plants that we're walking through
and this trees are unique to Hawaii
because it's such an isolated island or
group of islands some of the plants have
been bought in since then so there's a
lot of a non-native animals and plants
but this forest is pretty original guys
look down here into this insane valley
of dried lava it's just crazy
this was a red-hot lava lake no mountain
of lava that turned into eventually the
highest recorded lava fountain ever in
Hawaii 1900 feet list guy 580 meters
they measured it at about five times the
size of the hill that you see out there
today
we're getting next to off these flowers
now one of the birds love them get it I
got it
The Fool is nectar droplets we've done a
pretty epic location for lunch you can
have a little picnic here we're on the
edge of this dried lava field and just
just slipped and had a horrific accident
I'm the one that's gonna die someone has
to do it whoa is that from the molten
lava to this blushy yeah I think we're
gonna have to leave you we can't afford
it otherwise all of our hotel know guys
are seriously the the droids lavas like
super shop Wow okay that is sharp guys
look at the cross-section of miss lava
that's amazing when they first started
letting people walk on this it was only
eight feet deep of rock and then
underneath click 300 feet of lava whoa
maybe that's still what it's like now
it's probably yeah let's probably this
probably molten lava right underneath us
we get some cool photos I'm going to try
and walk along that Ridge without
hurting myself goodbye
I could I could slip and fall after
seeing what these rocks did to and I do
not want to slip over feel like this is
all gonna fall down
shiny this ruckus well it's like a boil
as a real it has that same like oil
slick
this is called rainbow lava yeah yes
these rocks here she's got some amazing
ones they're that bright magenta in the
corner here and then the shape of the
rock as well
we're misting formation yeah like uh-huh
we're now heading to find a steam vent
where moisture and rain waters run
underground to where it's still super
hot and it's all been heated and it's
getting back up through the ground steam
it's where there's no ping in the ground
just six feet down it's around 160
degrees Fahrenheit to be about 71
Celsius now very good sooner than that
oh my lenses steamed up oh yeah that's
nice I could sleep down here
this is where the dangerous volcano
bunnies live and they attack humans
man-eating bunnies
I still find it crazy to imagine that
this was 600 feet deep of molten lava
and then it slowly dried what slowly set
so so cool feels like I'm on another
planet like we're walking on the moon
off me that's the guys we're actually
running a little bit late because we
took so long down there we've got dinner
planned and then we're heading to
another part the crater where we can
look down for sunset to see the glow of
the lava oh but um we need to hurry that
was an exhausting run but we've just
arrived at this amazing natural lava
tube weather lavas like dried in a set
way that creates this big tunnel I don't
quite know how it works but that cooled
on the surface while I was still molten
hot underneath and over time it melted
away into the bedrock while the top
community cool if they had a good solid
chain-link is rock on high now this
underground cumulative flowing lava
when was this tunnel form around 500
years ago when 500 years yeah I notice
the roads the trees and I feel until
there's a tree roots
right we're heading to the what is it
like an over is it like a lookout yes
okay we're heading to a lookout see the
volcano the Sun probably going to set in
about a half an hour or something I just
found this in my pocket I wasn't going
to keep it cuz I'm not allowed to it's a
national park but this is basically
obsidian lazy they play minecraft this
is obsidian this is what real obsidian
looks like thanks
awesome Annette since the little
rainstorm fact that the sun's kind of
gone in or at least the clouds have
covered it he's got very chilly and we
were not prepared Nick definitely wasn't
prepared
we are quite my outta to die thing right
now
nick has climbed over the fence and he's
just sitting in there in the hot steam
it's the one is it ah the girl should
have just come here this is quite my
camera cuts hips and Steve without this
theme has warmed us up but it gets it's
crazy hot we keep on jumping in and out
this old it's just like if suddenly
changes to super scolding you can
actually hit pretty hard guys look at
this sign hazardous fumes hot lava we
just borrowed these hilarious limiting
coats off Marcus Nick and ang have their
matching coats and me and Roy have ours
it's so cute
there's something really exciting for me
the closer and closer we're getting for
this lava I think it's the raw sheer
power of the earth and it's been
something I've wanted to see for so long
I can see the glow now you see the glow
from the from the bottom the smoke oh
it's like hitting the smoke it's bright
orange glow
guys we found it we've had lover
I mean it's miles away but mixer using
Anja it's a tripod we've ducked inside
the museum for the volcano just to get
out a cold
let's get pretty dark now that was
phenomenal though looking at that from a
distance to see the little splatters of
lava kicking up apparently it's a very
rare occurrence being that high up now
this is the second time it's actually
been invisible at the top of the volcano
here so senseless eruptions started back
in 2008 usually all you're able to see
is the ambient glow can make you look
cool of lava below illuminating the sky
all right we're heading off Marcus has
been an amazing tour guide thanks bro
