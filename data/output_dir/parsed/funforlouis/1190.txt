I had a lovely sleep we all slept for a
long time and today is going to be good
one we're getting all our top top tips
out we're searching for breakfast so
hungry Indian breakfast
Nelson salsa that is exhausting yes
please
we've finished breakfast we're now
meeting the driver of the support
vehicle that's literally taken a week to
drive here to meet us and he's going to
be joining us for the whole trip
finally finished wrapping around and
we're now heading to British stuff for
the rickshaw run we're going to go ahead
now see the top tubs can add a bit I
know it's fine luma striker and also
like a couple panel three make sure to
set so I loaded equipment today
we have arrived
we've arrived with all the rickshaws
we're getting a debriefing on kind of
what we need to do for the tuk tuks just
keeping them running and fuelling and
stuff like that so ah good morning
Victoria we were just talking earlier
about teams and I think it's going to be
Ben and Harry Ben and me and will and
then Jack and Max are going to be the
rough teams I don't know whether we're
going to mix them up a bit so those are
the three touch
we're just being given some wet wipes a
bandanna and a t-shirt so far we've had
a little talk about tuk-tuks
brief explanation of the engines and
stuff which gives us a bet on and now
we're getting registered get a few
freebies and then we're going to go out
hang them up a little bit
stick some stickers on and finish the
job how you feeling much love it's
really close to getting the engine is
really excited you great feeling like
there's so much to film I'm going to
have so little to put into a film at the
end I'm going to have like and now for
five different visual vibes we're going
to basically check out the tire
commercial it's norm well it's up to
scratch with it then you go to sign some
time right here just to double check is
in good shape for takeoff
yeah literally signing our lives away
here feel an exciting yeah I'm so
excited it's just only hit me today like
when we like typical the tuk-tuks out
and it's just I'm not buzzing for it now
I can't wait they look great as well how
you feeling Ben I'd add words like I was
trying to sum up and the word how it's
like down daikon I just really want to
gather right now we've actually got two
more days until we go and I'm feeling a
bit impatient I'm just like let's just
go today let's just go this did that did
it I got the keys did dude it I got the
keys uh-huh I got the keys so we're
taking the tuk-tuk to the little test
drive
how sick is this been happy time for
three days and then hated awesome so
excited I'm so genuinely so excited
what's your first writing as an
incredible I'm blown away
Harry's an amazing driver oh yes
well buddy we have all successfully test
drive we met one of our tuk tuks already
broke down but we've fixed it now so
these two amazing jazz literature's you
have the whole nation apart people now
fixed yeah absolute pitch by five and
then we're going to try and throw with
me surfing on the road that's a good
plan it is a really good feeling
proximal definitely good and let me just
hope so this is an infirm we're going to
connect this up to the tuk-tuk battery
so we've got mains power on each tuk-tuk
first little problem is the inverters I
bought for each tuk-tuk are too powerful
for the batteries so we were hoping to
charge all our phones and cameras and
stuff off the batteries but they they're
too weak so we're going to try and see
we should get them upgraded so we have
bought a larger battery and we're going
to switch out and hopefully that will
solve our problem so we pick three flag
poles and the union Jap lines when we
see each other in traffic
we've got a couple of bottles of
two-stroke oil because you need to mix
that with the engine for the petrol
span and superglue essentials
so this is the last sponsor sticker for
Teenage Cancer Trust and the sticker on
this guy mean thing got a horrific fight
earlier about stickers literally about
stickers I think that's what being an
India does here
we haven't even way a pin sticking out
just on the back here what's been back
Harry's gonna be doing the whole rally
on this and we're gonna let them start
two days early so gets a bit the head
start
you're gonna make it the whole way me
and Max are going to go and buy some
cable ties just for fastening things
okay so they fight the water I love
places like this you're just wandering
along this like a hairdressers and then
there's like a mechanic's and there's
someone welding a fence and then there's
just like every single thing you can
imagine
no one's actually got a tie so we can't
we're gonna keep looking by things we
may just give up yo knees inside it fits
the time so after trying all day we
successfully fit the inverter and it's
running fine off the the new battery now
so we have power for the whole trip
we're heading to a little QA in a bar
over there and I guess we're just going
to find out a bit more about the whole
really like everyone that's doing the
rickshaw run is here and we're about to
hear some important stuff from the front
right let's just start me with this
vigilant logo you might have seen that
before it's got tiger and some rituals
very informative very informative we've
been doing it from club for a few hours
and now with gravity please rush the max
how long have we wait for it in 85
minutes
yeah I am annoyed you should even know
it I'm 53
I would attack
and then half an hour later was right
which was surprising but it's ok so
quite nice right then we check the
expiry date on the bottle and look here
expires 15th of the 7th 2014
oh wait that's July - July it's the end
of the night we're going to get some
rest it's another day of getting the tuk
tuks ready tomorrow so we're going to
need some energy but it's been awesome
I'm loving India and cannot wife the
rest of the trip peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure boom
you
