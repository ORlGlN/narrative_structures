we parked outside the bus place last
night and we haven't been too hopeful
about the getting the bus repairs
we found the go around the corner whose
comrades have a look I think it's about
half a
the open of the back the engine have a
look and this is what we found
this thing has snapped fun done this
this bolt thing and I'm gonna walk over
to the guys and see they can weld it
together the welding is done then kindly
offered to drive us down to a place
where we can get a new belt
so we've welded we've grind it and now
we're tightening this bolt back in
hoping it doesn't snap again the bus is
running now we just need to now we just
need to see it stays running in this
break I'm very proud right now in Sam we
basically are incredible bus mechanics
we're gonna be a little bit late for the
nice stuff seems to be buddy
we just got Birmingham like an hour and
a half later than planned but no joke
this is the most insane amount of people
mads were you saying bro

clock though Sam's come over this idea
of doing this orderly queue everyone

birmingham police cours saleya we're now
just chilling in Nando's yesterday
I don't already next up it's been it's
been a nice relaxing wine down evening
we were on our way to Maddie's house
after chilling and berming of the
evening and we've run out of diesel it
is not easy
scootering with a twenty liter diesel
can - get the engine started running out
field wasn't quite as easy as pumping
the fuel back in I actually ended up
having to take the fuel line and suck
the diesel out of the tank to clear the
blockage pit blocks when you run out of
fuel and and then got the engine started
so we're eventually here but all these
problems will be solved but this just
had a fuel gauge they diamond trace
