a very late night he kindly drags me out
of bed so I've got to get into Victorian
this morning and going to the Google
offices to help them out with the
project
so we're in the Google offices today and
we've Jillian and Toyo what's the
project that's happening today well this
project is about working with young
people and it's about getting young
people offering young people a platform
so that they can express their values
about what is like being a young person
living in London and we're here in the
Google offices which is a fantastic
opportunity because it's a nice
environment for them cool and they've
asked me to come in and share a bit
about my story on YouTube and help them
come up with an idea to share their
story with you guys so we're going to be
filming something today and hopefully
putting up a video
so the planet is we're going to sit
around a little huddle and these guys
going to make a video and we're going to
talk about their experiences and a
project idea that they've got and they
want to do which we're going to talk
about how we're gonna get that on
YouTube

moment we've been invited for this
project which Naomi a directed with my
life

cool meeting those young people and
hearing their story and what they're up
to and chatting to them about starting
their own YouTube channel and the movie
