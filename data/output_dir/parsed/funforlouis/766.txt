weekend
so we've loaded up the red dragon we've
got all our things in there and yeah

the car down but kiss it is like
roasting sauna in here so just open all
the doors to let some of the heat out
yeah right guys the other day you might
remember we uh we bought this guy and
I'm gonna try and quickly wire in it we
can oh it might be epic bro depends
where the Vista connections the same as
this one I just pulled out these guy no
paint is it no they sent a quick one
what what we just have to do is figure
out it's not the same connector is it
no it's a different guy we just need to
figure out which was which and then
strip them and put on but it will take
like a quart of an hour thing okay but
anyway there's his old guy and then when
I've got time I just need a little like
a knife or something boy it's couldn't
hear like a little sharp knife because
I'll just strip the ends like that and

we've popped over to see some of Dave's
friends and let's throw down to the
beach that was a nice little stop these

probably gonna go find someone to stay
for the night because in a similar way
to me they doesn't plan ahead I don't
