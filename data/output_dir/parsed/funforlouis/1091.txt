energy levels up and we're going Wow and
check this truck I know you feel it this
dragon he knows exactly what's up
we've stopped off at gas station guys
said that the most incredible driving
stunt I've seen in a long time we were
driving parallel to this road to the
highway and it gets to a dead end and we
would have had to turn back all the way
to get on the highway but there's a
grass verge it's quite a steep Bank what
did you do just drove straight up the
grass verge onto the highway it was
incredible at one point thought the van
would tip over but we made it and it was
it was amazing it was amazing he's a
very skilled drivers here
it's midnight it's time for me to say my
antibiotics and it's also time you're
driving
we've got like I said a full night of
driving ahead of us he's driving off to
me Jesse's next yeah I'm driving naked
it's 4:00 in the morning
and I've had a lovely Drive I'd had a
lot of thinking time I've been thinking
about when I get back to England and
what sue is one of my bus is and where
to live and stuff and I've come up with
this idea to build a hobbit hole by a
little field somewhere maybe with a tree
on it or the tree house as well so I'm
just kind of developing some ideas here
also look I mended my glasses with a
lollipop stick and a paperclip and some
electrical tape so these are working
well we are actually now in El Paso
which borders Juarez I literally what
looking at the Mexican border I was
driving through and Juarez is actually I
think the most dangerous city no it's
got the highest murder rate outside of
an official war zone in the world so
it's probably one of the most dangerous
cities in Mexico I was thinking we could
drive through but you know all of these
guys have got their passports so it's
not gonna work out for me
I'm gonna get some sleep now and catch
you guys tomorrow
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
