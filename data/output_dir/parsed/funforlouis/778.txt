my name is Caitlin this is Garfield
we are from Suffolk in United Kingdom
and you're watching Fanta Louis enjoy
good morning guys
sunrise sir yeah half 6:00 in the
morning and we are about to head off on
a safari a safari ride good morning
how're you feelin all right in here
probably a bit better than me yeah I'm
actually right I'm actually right all
right got a rifle for hit thank you
you ready see loads of awesome animals
toys ready man born ready
let's go look out cheetahs we am coming
yet
these are the ones that um killed Mufasa
yes as a noiseless excuse as it
we're setting up a little picnic you can
have some coffee and some snacks I think
we haven't seen any rhinos yet I still
want to see some rhinos and down TV we
didn't get to stretch past that and it's
been pretty chilly guys so that's we've
been wrapped up in the rugs because it's
still so early
but the Sun is getting higher on the sky
and nice and warm now just a bit this is
the life man
yes is awesome alright back in the truck
see see what we can find
alright it's hard on these drives cuz
you just you just don't know they could
be hiding there might be somewhere else
but we'll see
we found rhinos guys we found arroyos
what are you saying man
this is what I wanted to say that is
like one of the main reasons that it's
common it wasn't a certainty to find
rhinos but we just stumbled across the
five five of them yeah
this is amazing we're getting super
close now
by mr. Ono say guys you see all this
smashed down trees this is from a
massive herd of elephant this come
through here and just destroy everything
we've spotted an elephant he's out there
the other side of the lake
by
see more there somewhere
I'm so glad is your elephant
thank you guys I've been sleeping all
afternoon it's been amazing
this weather oh I swear this client
probably the only issue being out here
and this nature reserve is the Internet
we only have edge on our phones so I've
been tethering my phone to my computer
start my upload at 3:00 a.m. this
morning
I thought I should be out by 5:00 p.m.
next day that's giving it a good you
know port you know it's upload it's now
3:30 p.m. it's only uploading 25% so
core in 12 hours which means toddler
this whole video is going to say 48
hours by which time we're going to be
left here so a bit of a Nia really and
it's probably the slowest internet ever
had probably slowest upload of ever done
guys look at the hippo is just chillin
over there sunbathing the elephant's are
coming out to play guys it will coax the
war
but that is going to do the elephant
snip is now a fight the hippos don't
seem too bothered either that's ten
around them look a little tornado
you
to make sure then accidentally lean on
this fence that would hurt guys I just
walked around the other side of the lake
to take a time-lapse of the sunset and I
just kind of walked through this bush
and I think these are the thorns that
JP's warned me about it's really really
spiky thorns and one just went through
my sock ins my ankle and I think there's
a thanks bleeding really hurts I went in
there you can see the blood on my shoe
where it just squared ah
and apparently the tip it's got em like
poison on it so um ouch that's a lot I
think this is the spot
I've got me careful put my camera here
because see that wire right there he's
got nine thousand volts or seven
thousand volts of make running for a
we're going to accidentally touch my
lens on the front and then blow up my
camera and kill myself so it stopped
look so close to the fence there we are
popping into the shop to buy some dinner
we can do another bright thanks huh oh
