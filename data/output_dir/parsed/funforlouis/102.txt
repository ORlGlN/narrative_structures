good morning guys we're in Germany in a
town called baden baden it's kind of in
there
I guess the southwest corner of Germany
quite near the French border we flew in
last night from Brighton in the UK and
we're just about to meet up with my
friend Felix a lot of you know him he
originally had the expedition happiness
the big school bus that I now have in
the US and yeah I came and visited him I
think earlier in the year but he lives
nearby so he's going to take us out for
lunch we're gonna hang out maybe chat a
little bit about the documentary because
he's had quite a bit of experience he's
just released his own documentary about
the school bus but yeah and then I think
later this afternoon we're gonna be
heading to Austria I was contemplating
staying in Germany and shooting some
stuff for the documentary but I think
the plan now is just so I can say I've
officially done every leg of the journey
is yeah stick with these guys and then
tomorrow when we need to put the plane
in for maintenance I'll come back to
Germany and apparently there's some cool
opportunities here to interview people
and some Syrian refugees that have come
into Germany so that's the plan guys we
met up with Felix yes bro
Felix kindly got the place to stay last
night now we're heading out for lunch oh
yeah this is Dima as well have you
didn't watch yesterday's vlog he's
randomly like tagged along from the UK
with more countries than me as well
which is pretty impressive right
is she tending our flowers hit the women
sending her flowers on the bridge Felix
that's quite fast car and we were just
talking like theoretically could we race
these guys to Austria to be just outside
Vienna over they were really good
what do you reckon do you think we could
be a pen somewhere in Austria but I
would say being a nice step is that sort
of spin yeah but if we get out of hotel
all together yeah
by the time they take a cab by the time
they prepare on JP spook Harry but he
probably takes like 45 minutes just to
do a lot of pre check on the flight zone
okay another 45 to get to the airport
another two hours until takeoff because
they are not allowed to take off
whatever I'm positive I would take the
bet I mean like 10000 or whatever at
least like a 10 hour drive but you could
probably do in five eight but in theory
this is cool this is like I feel like
this is an episode of top getting in the
making we can be like would have to be a
night time because in daytime you cannot
drive more than like 200 ok so we're
saying clear roads and you don't have to
worry about it you don't have to worry
about getting pulled over by the police
stacking every hour drive it's an eight
hour drive but we can do it for I've
been pleasantly surprised by this town
never heard of it before we came here
today but apparently it's like because
it's in the south of Germany it's really
nice weather here most the time and
Felix likes it because of the nature as
well who's saying how actually hate
cities and I I can kind of relate to
that like I don't have a hatred towards
cities but I do enjoy
less of that kind of chaos and noise and
stuff and having somewhere to chill
yeah I don't know if I could live
permanently in a real hustle-bustle of a
city but then I would what do you guys
feel do you like that kind of that kind
of energy do you thrive from that or
does that drain you I guess that's the
question is a bit like whether you're an
extrovert or an introvert it's great
Greece and Egypt Felix is thinking about
joining us when you when you get to join
us bro
I think Austria increase such as like
Greece yeah I'll put my shorts on and my
dad body and then drink what are you
drinking now an increase I don't know
but I think we've got a different idea
of where in Greece I'm thinking they're
going to like refugee camps you just he
can hit in the Greece I agree silence
Gemma nee I'm gonna be back the platanus
I don't know if I was saying earlier but
we're gonna drop the plane in Austria
for some maintenance it needs to be
there for quite a while like more than a
week unfortunately but I'm gonna be on a
mission at that point first stop is
coming back to quite near here and yeah
hopefully get to do some interviews and
and meet some Syrian refugees and some
local Germans and kind of just kind of
get my head around the whole dynamic
going on there and then yeah off to
explore some other areas possibly Greece
and I don't know we're on to Egypt after
that but yeah I'm gonna meet these guys
back or JP back next weekend Austria
baby
let's do this
oh yeah there's that front over the
river yeah does anyone like ginger and
chocolate I have some amazing dark
chocolate ginger in it trial bearable
but it's definitely going strong to
taste last place that I'm joining for
all the way to Austria
it's like Q&A hey you guys ready yeah
okay okay first question what is the
most frustrating or difficult part about
traveling the world this way there's all
the red tape and bureaucracy I'd say now
that says like permit long lead times
for filing plate plans that sort of
thing baby don't baby don't being able
to land too definitely because things
could change last second rare you
definitely need a
be flexible and open it and patient I
guess yeah have you bought the aeroplane
or is it rented really cool series by
the way Louie owns the airplane he
bought it
yep it was just played a lot more sense
up top I'm not planning on on keeping it
and it was kind of like at its best but
well planning on keeping it yet I don't
know how I would be able to do but it
makes sense to be able to sell it and it
should hold its value and if we'd rented
it would have been a waste aboard up in
120-130 sales dollars down the drain
yeah we're renting thanks though ok are
you ok JP I'm fine
another question about JP I said I saw
you speaking German on Instagram how
many languages do you speak you're being
played there's a video by you channel
you can check out if you want to do that
it's called how many languages do I
speak who really how many languages do
you speak
I speak five what is the funniest thing
that has happened to you recently Matt
peeing in the plane that was a that was
a lariat guys I get it if you didn't see
that floki means go check out it was
like I think I left like a six minute
section of the blog with your lay like
Matt trying to pee unsuccessfully and I
feel like I should address this a little
bit it is actually quite challenging
just in this plane in general especially
in those suits because there's just a
lot of layers you're working with like
you got to turn around you gotta get
like the theme problem one of the
biggest problems is gravity because like
the seats are angled backwards you got
to make sure that stuff like that I said
what I thought more than anything though
it's just a number of let the sheer
number of layers I think I was okay I
was my baby how much do you sleep on
average per day and also will you ever
visit Sweden after your trip for who is
that everybody I guess but mostly
last night I reckon I got like three and
a half and then have another 20 minutes
down so yeah at that some days I'll get
bored antisense
but I'm not courage 'never II won - like
trying to survive on a little amount of
sleep but on this trip I'm willing to
sacrifice a bit sleep to try and get the
vlogs edited and uploaded and I way
underestimated how long these vlogs are
gonna take to edit I need there gonna be
a challenge but this is like next-level
I kind of I kind of like that either
so almost to the airport I think this is
probably good one to end on what so far
isn't something you remember the most
about this trip flying over the
Greenland ice cap blowing a great little
general way was just like you know that
I think they were gonna keep landing we
hadn't greenery like the bounce head of
the iceberg great and also just like I
mean I would say like the whole of
northern Canada going to Greenland cuz
you just get like so remote there's no
one out there you're like some of the
only people in the world that stuff a
set like we did that the Sun was saying
like three hours right and it just felt
so epic it felt like we were just
something breaker uniform you can expect
if you like typically would have we
dropped out
I love getting to see these interesting
places loads flow like this just looking
out the window we've landed an Austrian
there's like a restaurant right next to
the runway awesome I'm gonna dump our
bags out here well I think we've also
managed to book ourselves into the chief
you know hotel nearby so funny people
are not to use to no odor staring what
was your name again
make a hello hello Mickey's come to say
hello to us he's been following the
adventure yeah so we've got a relatively
nice room tonight I'm sharing with Matt
because we're both night hours so we
both stay up very late and and the other
boys you know probably go to bed earlier
than us so it makes make sense and we've
spent most the evening so far just
trying to figure out a bunch of stuff
which I'm not gonna bore you with but
turns out yeah a lot of the things we're
trying to do is flying around the world
and you know filming stuff and finding
interesting stories it doesn't always
fall into place as planned it gets bit
more complicated so currently I'm trying
to figure out whether to to drive or fly
back to near where we just were this
morning in Germany to trying them to do
some filming and capture some kind of
documentary footage and men from there
whilst the planes getting maintenance
and JP needs to shoot off for some stuff
whether I then fly elsewhere but it's
just a bit tricky tricky trying to
figure it all out say and I solved it I
just hate getting up super early and
flying places on budget airlines
they probably won't let me take my bag
on that scary
anyway I'm not gonna bore you with any
more but and it's been a fun day it's
nice doing our final flight together
with Matt it's been it's been a good
time bro yeah yeah I feel like this
isn't the last adventure we're gonna
have to get away I'm pretty confident
about here but you've been you've been a
good help for this trip thank you so
much for your for your wisdom yeah and
if you haven't guys definitely going to
subscribe to Matt and he can take you on
these adventures from his perspective a
lot of more like a lot all the flights

videos and yeah let them know let us
