good morning guys
we've just finished breakfast again
overlooking the river watching the
hippos play and we're about to get taken
on a little walk a guided walk around
poverty by this guy mark is gonna show
us some stuff and he's gonna leave is
protected with his bow and arrow it's
crazy to me that hippos can climb up
here I can't sleep the thing with
walking along the river like this is the
thing we can see hippos coming but the
crocodiles they could just come out of
nowhere I can know that you just don't
know right there like the most relaxing
place ever
I just can't believe they get through
these little gaps
unlike the hippos next door camp which
are totally used to humans these are
really not used to seeing you in so
they're like really pissed off when it's
yes they're all staring at us
go ahead look at the baby hello baby
we're just sitting down for some lunch
sorry the whole vlog today guys has just
been hippos but they are just
fascinating animals lunches herbs
vegetable curry had enough thank you
thank you so much good bye thank you
thank you cool thanks for all your help
and service and it's been great thanks
thank you
I sent it's at my Center that I'm
looking forward to seeing you again yeah
thanks
good bye
yes mr. Cotto we just left the first
Lodge on our way to the second and
within like two minutes huge crocodile
and like this place seems unreal that
there can be so many animals in such a
small area but crocodiles hippos and
elephants all within like ten meters of
each other
can we get out d yeah really yeah okay
these shout if you want us to come back
okay this feels quite risky
I rise crazy
I think they've clocked us I guess
they're just keeping an eye on us
mmm they're the one animal that the
Maasai are scared of the elephants Saudi
told me yesterday I think that's at us
should we come back be at the elephant's
okay
it gave us a mock charge protecting its
little baby
guys that elephant is pissed off
this is anger
Mahad is dumped out my chest they were
serious I'm pretty sure they serious oh
and look they're full of another Zog so
we're taking a different ride probably a
good idea
imagine if this one's blocked by
elephants as well
the cheaper guys cheat around this way
well we didn't find any cheater but we
have come back to the Maasai village we
thought would be cool to say hi to them
when it's sunny and not pouring the rain
nice to come back here in the sunshine
and see these amazing traditional
performances
these traditional master chart
these same eyes symmetry is
guys we found the cheater
that was so incredible
terrible oh my gosh also that is the
gruesome reality of the wild and I was
dying
cheetahs are straight-up predators and
it was munching on a little baby Impala
well guys we've arrived at the new lodge
tulipe quani to pili Holies pronounce
that tip-tippy lee quani hello hello

got some penne pasta I mean no one's got
the same and this one spicier right I
went for some vegetables I'm heading
back to my room now oh it's good thank

told that there's a resident leopard is
that true the leopard the leopard that
lives here

was the hippos and here it's the leopard
