I'm Jeff with world wars 360 and
basically I've been an urban survival
level-10 friend of your fookin yeah and
right when I was getting ready to raise
money to help pay my expired tanks and
registration on my van I was to do a
crowdfunding campaign on IndieGoGo right
when I was getting ready to launch at
the cops those bad boys they came and
they kidnapped my van they they're
holding it hostage and they are
demanding ransom and they said if I ever
want to see my van alive again I gotta
pay that money or it's killed and so
they got it locked up in tow yard jail
in prison over here in San Juan
Capistrano and all my stuff is in there
so long story short I'm gonna have to
raise money to get it out of the prison
or I gotta get another

oh and so when they took my van away and
if you live in your van and they take it
away guess what happens to you you end
