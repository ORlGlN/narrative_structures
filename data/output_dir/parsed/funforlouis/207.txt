good morning guys you've just woken up
outside in the wilderness we camped here
last night as you can see in these
little tents and a little fire and some
dinner and we're about to head back to
the lodge for some breakfast before
we're heading out to the market before
we do we're doing some very special so
whenever the guests of the Lodge go out
they they ask them to take these little
bags of tree seeds to replant the trees
on the riverbanks and they cover the
seeds in charcoal which protects them
from being eaten by animals and stuff
which is pretty cool and then we're
going to we're going to shoot them with
catapults onto the riverbank
so we're replanting trees and where we
aiming just over there did you salute
well Jack very well like a baby
Canadian was another black man I've
never heard that one before that
and what trees adieu I'm going to grab
my bag and we're jumping on the ATVs and
heading back pretty genius idea that
these little childhood season it I love
people that find problems to solve like
that animals eating the seeds I think
basically they stay with a charcoal
wrapped around it until there's like
rainfall and then and then it dissolves
it
when we arrived the other day I'm saying
like they are in a drought right now
it's like supposed to be the wet season
but they haven't had any rain so the
riverbed was dry and if you watched
yesterday's vlog we drove down here on
the dry riverbed the last night at 4:00
a.m. the rainfall from wherever there's
some lightning storms I guess on the
horizon basically all the rain washed in
and the river is now here look this was
dry last night and now there's a full-on
river
well we've been completely blocked off
the whole riverbed is now a flowing
river I'm going to have to cut into here
now we have arrived like at the lodge
kind of the breakfast I think this is so
cool eaten breakfast and then there's
like awesome birds are chillin over
there I hit he is a bad man
funny the other day we arrived I was
running up and down this path at night
to our little to our room here and I was
told like I shouldn't be running at
night through here because there's
leopards around the camp they come in
close to the camp and apparently running
past a leopard at night it can trigger
their kind of chase everyone is there
like primal instinct and like and just
go see you even though typically they
don't attack adults so lucky I didn't
get shot by leopard so after months of
drought in this area the heavens are
finally opened check it out this is
pretty heavy rainfall
the rain has stopped as I was heading
back to the main building I just stopped
for the path because there's these
little dick dicks just chillin right
here
hey guys they're my new favorite okay so
I was just given a suggestion to put it
in my mouth so that it can reload kiss
are you ready
I wonder if I'll do it I don't know so
we've decided to stay at the lodge for
sunset so we can get all our cool photos
it's kind of hazy the sun's going down
it's like behind the scenes of a
instagramers life just lining up the
shot now and this is pretty pretty
beautiful 15th day
you guys must think we're hilarious but
this is the reality this is like a sneak
high machines actually a not quite as a
can bid getting some of these photos as
you would have thought obviously very
post this is another essential little
cute lanterns we're going to do fairy
lights as well
nice battery-powered fairy lights we
need to get the malays I feel like
they're a bit of an essential for the
modern instagramers like stepping out of
all of the nicely they had little teapot
something nice I switched to my 20 ml
1.4 oh my gosh
it just started chucking it down I think
we got our last two photos oh the girls
are bringing the rugs back in oh that's
crazy wow that just came out of nowhere
haha
Oh expect those baby I just look like
that minutes ago I know it do you think
um happy now like that not good and I
was literally as you said okay you done
well it's been another amazing day in
Kenya it's been a little bit more chill
today than yesterday if you missed
yesterday's vlog it was absolutely
mental we went on the game Drive we saw
like every animal we had breakfast by
the bank of a river and we came back
chilled in the pool and we went out on
quad bikes and yet tour along the
riverbed ended up like camping on the
riverbed under the stars and then woke
up in the morning to to the river you
saw this morning and the river is
flowing we'd hear it flowing in the
background there listen
yeah the rains have definitely come in
and yeah I it's just nice to be here on
the first day of the rainy season like I
said earlier it was really special
it did however mean that we were rushing
to get all the photos with the guys Jack
and Lauren like trying to get them
before there's any more rain and yeah it
it came in just we got just in time
before the torrential downpour tonight
we were basically head up in that like
shacks up in the in the lodge up there
for hours and the rain was just coming
down it's like coming sideways but I
feel I feel happy for the the nature
because you know everything's going to
grow better everything's going to be
more green tomorrow we are heading to
the village that we were supposed to be
going to today is a good job we then
head there this evening actually because
we would have just been like caught in
the rain and stuff but yeah we're going
to go super early evening up at 5:30 or
6:00 again and head off and hopefully
yeah and get to meet some cool people
apparently this village isn't used to or
it hasn't been kind of commercializes
tourism but it's yeah really authentic
and hopefully we'll get to meet some
cool people and learn a bit more about
the culture here catch in the morning
peace out
