hi good morning guys
come on coconut breakfast it's about
8:30 and we are about to get into some
vehicles in ahead to the next
destination I slept very well guys I was
out like a life
paid in this morning wire
shines you know the place we're going to
tune in the name of day by day we're
heading to pay and wait for our joy
approximately four hour drive this is so
he's all going to you hosting us so it's
been in BO so fantastic and he's gonna
give us he's gonna show us where we are
and what we're saying as we drive all
the way there
will trigger this temperature the laser
temperature thing
guys I cannot believe that we got pulled
over at that checkpoint and they just
pointed this laser thermometer at each
of us to check our temperature and then
let us go and the reason they did is
because one of the major signs of having
Ebola is you know a raise in temperature
so they check as you're coming in it in
and out of each town we've just been
stopped again this time we have to go
and wash our hands so the the army have
stopped us
get no temperatures taken again
36.5 that's my temperature 36.5 which is
the good one this one this this one
thank you right
we tried overtaking and getting around
but they told us to go back
they've got a good system going on there
guys passports checked
what is it let me see
another one that was about
we have to wash our hands before
entering the hotel
we just came outside for lunch but the
rains the rain should start it again and
the tables getting a bit wet so they
suggested we go inside
okay yeah a bit dryer
I got a schwa more plate chicken spicy
sauce looking good we finished lunch and
it's finally time to go out and see some
projects we've arrived that can come up
this is the village river right that and
these were the people waiting to say
hello
well welcome water welcome
I just wanted to thank you all for
welcoming us so normally I have this
homework I must say it's really
impressive the way you came together as
a community to deal with me outright and
you mentioned that there's still
challenges like the crowding in schools
maybe projects but hearing from how you
dealt with this massive outbreak I've no
doubt that any challenges that you face
you'll be able to so we just heard from
some of the villagers and the elders
from the area about how they avoided the
baler in this area and there was a
couple of cases fairly nearby but it was
cool just hearing from people and we're
now gonna get a little tour around the
village from some of the children refer

cooking dinner hello this is what we
were met with that
I was getting a little coconut drink a
sweet
cheers cheers Cheers Shawn thanks for
showing us around look at the village
elder on the mayor bike salute mate
how amazing is that we've just pulled
over to watch this kids play simple mean
Riya are eating in the room and then I'm
gonna get on with some more editing the
internet is a little bit slower at this
hotel so I'm not sure quite what to do
so hold tight guys the vlogs aren't
coming out fast then it's because Sierra
Leone in today isn't amazing well I've
been on a proper mission tonight guys
after dinner I went over to the
headquarters of World Vision which is
down the road to try and get my video
uploaded got it 50% uploaded to like two
hours I'm now back outside my hotel room
and the Wi-Fi like burrito is up there
somewhere so I'm just standing here
waiting for the last 15 minutes and then
it's gonna go live yes but despite slow
internet speeds
it's been an amazing day and it was
great earlier I don't know if I really
explained what was going on but the
village we went to a lot of the children
there and in the area of sponsored
children from World Vision so you can
sponsor a child with World Vision and
the community that that child lives in
gets the money and it supports them and
their family so those communities were
educated about Ebola and it was actually
prevented from infiltrating a lot of
those community
which is amazing news they were taught
kind of procedures of how to protect
against it and what to do if people
contracted it in all of that so really
good education and the world vision were
a big part of that we're going to visit
another project tomorrow I don't know a
lot about it but it's every day's an
eye-opener at the moment and I'm excited
for the rest of the week it's like 2:00
in the morning
and we're getting up at 8:00 so I'm
gonna get some sleep and I'll catch you
then peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure
