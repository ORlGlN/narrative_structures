strange it's just like she made fun of
sunny then suddenly like massive
downpour of rain and then it's like kind
of drawing up quickly
I don't know parents they've been on and
off rain all week so I guess when it
rains wasn't to go and get coffee and
chill for a little bit

with his I've asked for Rachel's help
and gave me some clothes she thinks I
should just get t-shirts but I kind of
like vests even though they're not

at least another week Nick and Andra
arriving in a couple of days and yeah
tomorrow I'm going to test out the Sony
rx100 the new one I got today and we're
going to see how it holds up compared to
the g7x so I'm just gonna try it out
there was a little bit sad today I
figured out me and JP were fiddling with
this settings and basically the idea was
potentially I was gonna start uploading
my vlogs in 4k now we've tested the
camera and it doesn't seem to do any
stabilization with the 4k footage so it
could be a problem and I may not be able
to do that yet maybe you guys don't need
that yet anyway but well we can test it
out I'm gonna try and vlog tomorrow with
the rx100 and see what happens so let me
know what you think it's Mari sweet
right oh I'm gonna dunk them do some
more testing with the the new GoPros
well I haven't really even tried it yet
but yeah we need four thing I know I
think things ain't fun to do with the
GoPro tomorrow leave it to me I think of
some fun plans don't worry there's
plenty to do in New York
sweetie right I am gonna get some rest
and I will catch you in the morning
peace out
