hi guys I'm Alex from Spain I'm Dara
from Puerto Rico
penny would challenge you could check
here so today I'm going on a bike tour
around Melbourne this is my guide Danny
he's gonna be taking me around it does
however look a little bit still real
it's just starting to rain so hopefully
the weather holds up but I'm excited
we're gonna learn a lot of stuff about
Melbourne today
first stop on our little tour Federation
bells these bells were built in 2001 and
Danny just told me that you can go
online create a chain like submit it and
then it tells you what time you can come
down here and hear your own tune playing
on the bells and I think that is pretty
awesome
that's amazing all right let's go so
Melbourne had heaps of beautiful gardens
sir just dotted all around the city it
was a city that was built basically
because of the gold rush they were
producing I think a third of the world's
gold at the time and so because of that
that wealth and that money this is where
Melbourne gets some of its fantastic
gardens and some of its really cool
buildings and architecture firms all
basically things built out of that era
there's a lot of really cool hidden bars
and restaurants
after we checked it out
well it's been a pretty awesome tour so
far getting to learn the city a little
bit we've stopped off for a coffee on
route
so if stuck to this cool little place
for lunch Danny tell me about this place
what's so what's the deal here so Intel
is anything which is that the average
could convert this is actually a place
that I stopped up my first day of
travels here in Melbourne which is
basically a volunteer kitchen where you
serve yourself all vegetarian sometimes
vegan food and you leave the a
contribution or a donation at the end so
makes food and healthy food accessible
to anyone missing it sway try it now so
that was a delicious lunch and now
Danny's gonna take me to see more of
Melbourne this is such a beautiful bite
right check out this little converted
trailer cafe I love it
this bike tour is turned into a little
bit of a copy tour Melbourne but I have
no complaints no complaints at all
so we've come back to the graffiti
alleyways I looked around lost more than
Melbourne and to be honest they probably
all changed since I was there the amount
of artistic come down there
just amazing so I'm done with a cycle
tool such a beautiful way to see
Melbourne I think I'm gonna have to make
that one of the first things I do and I
visit most it easiest uh check it out on
a bike find the best places
