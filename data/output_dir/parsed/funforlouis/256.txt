good morning guys today is our last day
with the damanhur community and the
first thing we're going to do today
first thing we're learning about is how
they harness an energy called selfic
energy to create these devices which can
store the energy and have different
purposes that they use them for I guess
like protection and health purposes so
yeah we're going to find out a little
bit more about that so this for example
is a bracelet that gives you support for
protect you'll always be energetic the
energy which is all about the guy this
is where they make the selfic devices we
just found out a founder Falco down a
little community he built this cell for
us and he used it to on it cosmic energy
or another dimension transfer perfume
and color well this is a cool workshop
with statues okay
the founder of community
Pacha local community space with its so
much creativity there's so many people
making things and studio spaces and
different mediums as well whether it's
like sculpture or cutting glass or
making mosaics really cool I like the
idea of being in a narcisstic community
I feel like there's a process that
happens when you can create and build
things and make things like good very
syrupy sit there like you're saying this
last night as well because we did a
little Art Club yesterday in yesterday's
vlog did you this year I feel like
something that I miss in my life when
I'm not able to you know just create out
my imagination and do art and stuff it's
very important thing for the next
location a little bit of a mystery I
don't know where we're going next
we've arrived at another part of the
community this is amazing we have to
like drive down winding mountain roads
to get here so this is like really off
the grid it is so good and they have a
cool dog hello alright we're getting
some tips that have a build houses for
our community this is a straw bale house
- window shows what's behind it's after
the clay layer this is what all the
insulation for the waters this is so
nice and they can bedroom up there yeah
the bedroom love they're very very
silent because the straw has a very
strong insulation both thermically as
well as acoustically Wow
so this is an extension to your house
neither will become another person
actually and there will be also a vacuum
behind there and all of the bricks are
made from straw ya know they're
definitely enjoy it
when truck I like this this little log
burner
guys this is crazy we've just been told
that this entire house spins is that to
get the best heat or something it spins
with the Sun and it has solar panels on
the roof and it has photovoltaic on the
roof Wow stolen inside so it's
completely self-sufficient this is crazy
oh my god what a years well Wow so you
could like watch the sunset and the
sunrise out the same window
did he build it good job I'm doing this
house with more solid everything that is
one of the most amazing houses I've ever
seen who has blue thought it is I'm
going to spin my house around so we've
finished our lunch hanging out with all
the dumb and harrion's that are living
here we found out now around the table
of 18 people there's actually 12
different nationalities represented
which I thought was pretty cool and
we're now continuing to have a little
tour and we're about to go down to this
building this is really cool because
they've been experimenting with solar
power for decades that our guess and
these are the different generations of
solar panels so guys who just walked
into a control room these are the
battery banks from the solar power and
these are hot water tanks where the
water's getting collected from the roof
and she's just telling us that even the
winter and the sunshine this is sixty
degrees Celsius just from the Sun
heating the water that's crazy that's a
lot harder of a shower that's like way
harder than you draw a hot tub but this
is our 3 3 from what's the canoe feels
get the water
ahh what is the locker I've just been
really really creamy good water I don't
know whether you realize where this is
the one that comes from the substrate it
comes in here go through the first
filter is pushed by these two pumps
through these together we have our water
regularly invested and it's spilling
water guys I just want to show you this
package can I've ever ever seen let's
let our fabric a because your camera
well your water ah you're just like a
big balloon you just like a big very
believable okay guys it's been a lovely
visit to this place lots of things about
lots of inspiration we're now going to a
very exciting place
called the physical the Enchanted Forest
I think it's called the Enchanted Forest
we're going to the enchanted forest now
a sacred forest so we've arrived at the
temple of a sacred forest we're getting
shown around some of the things here
this is the oldest tree act they
estimate like 150 years old and they've
named it Yemen tell and they've built
like a shrine and a meditation circle
around the tree so guys this is the
stinging plant rooms like that again and
their shelf electrodes - yeah and then
it goes through a MIDI controller and
you can hear the frequencies and
melodies that at last make it
so it's protecting me let the flow of
electricity it's exactly every living
being is has some electrical activity we
are back at the temple of humankind yeah
for a concert if you didn't see my flop
in the other day when we went down into
the temple you're about to get an
amazing treat
they wish to be beautiful and with about
the how little em little shopping
ah
yeah
the last film editing was actually a
native Amazonian language about the
right
is the saying that these next ones are
from related American origin we not a
type of cameras in the narrations of the
episodes people outside the German Aryan
community to see the new sections
they're very exciting in the same ways
this section if you watch my book the
other day thought about that but
representing all the different kind of
deities and gods and things were all
cultures from around the world and if
the same is in there that the murals
that are painted all over the world and
were kind of it again is the whole kind
of theme was uniting the whole of
humanity and that massive horrible and
dumb has the Bowser you know whether you
believe hmmm the spiritual belief they
do or not for me if you make that
most important things me it's what they
stand for that this whole thing of
trying to unite people built community
with automation so you know the other
day Kristin hit 100k on her YouTube
channel well tonight is another special
night because Nadine is about the hit
three hundred thousand three hundred
thousand
we're not saying oh good boy I thought I
would kind of summarize our trip here
and I guess reflect a little bit about
the last few days because it's been I
say quite overwhelming I've learned a
lot about their belief systems and kind
of their worldview of why things are the
way they are and what needs to change
and those of this and things like that
this is a very bit heavy subject so I'm
not going to go into now but guess but
trying to dig out myself of what is what
how would I fully define my kind of
spiritual beliefs and growing up in
church as a Christian and being inspired
by Jesus and then also wanting to
connect with people from different
backgrounds and different world belief
systems and how I can live unified with
those people and find a way to love one
another
anyway lots of stuff flying around my
head it's been so much I haven't been
able to I guess translate to my vlogs
but it's all been really really cool and
one thing was taken away from this
weekend is really wanting to pursue
continue to pursue this vision to build
tree a tree house community and
Christian and Syria are 100% on that as
well so we've just been chatting about
areas which we could do that and how
long will it take for us to establish
something like that because I think it's
going to take a while right
anyway I I will I'll update you guys if
I had any further thoughts and whether
we have any deep spiritual discussions
as a group on all travels back and yeah
I'll catch you very early in the morning
we need to leave here at 7:00 a.m. to
get
to the airport to fly back to the UK so
yeah I'll see that peace out enjoy life
if the adventure
