and you're watching good morning guys
and it was snowing hey there's no
snowing and we are heading out for
breakfast
we have just finished a big hearty
breakfast and I'm still trying to wake
up not feeling 100% today but I've got a
power through I think we're going to
maybe go and get a little coffee and
then I think we're going on a little
fight see some cool ice caves and
waterfalls and stuff
li-mei
we've arrived at Johnson Canyon and
we're gonna go speed up hike and looking
forward to this things can be pretty
stunning also there's bears and wolves
and elk which I'm going to keep my eyes
peeled for
the best it's so slippery in it
the park there are so slippery I don't
know how I haven't fallen over yes how
many times you fallen over Mike anyone
I'm almost guarantee I'm ridiculous we
were supposed to meet up these ice
sheets but we didn't for some reason so
just makes it a little bit more
interesting
oh you sit down I like it
we have arrived at the lower fold he's
going through this little cave get to it
cut it out how awesome is this
yes Mike
just in some danger photography don't
slip man
there's no guys the tree is kept on
growing and wrapped around the fence
here that's crazy
yeah so refreshing the mic is just had a
little drink out of the stream I think
I'm gonna have to do that as well
they make that might collapse if you go
too far for I'm gonna have a little bit
Jeff get right down yeah yeah this time
just we just sit in a nice okay
okay I've got it I got it just hope my
camera doesn't slide in
hmm nice delicious
it's amazing guys
well we decided to get the snacks out
just have some raisins sharing a banana
this is a beautiful hike
when you paint these and stuff you don't
always realize how kind of polluted and
nasty the areas we can get out in the
wilderness you suddenly see the
difference and it's incredible
I like this guy's thinking of a little
nap that took the mountain
so apparently guys these are waterfalls
just showing us the way to get closer to
the water
we're gonna head over there we want to
avoid these massive snow chunks crashing
on my head
cool little rocket fuel on then they've
respectively down there
yeah
guys this little chipmunky awesome it's
so tame yeah yeah
just tell me that's at about the
Chipmunks again apparently along this
trail somewhere there's a sign that says
chipmunks hospitalized more people and
bath every year than any other animal
because they just bought your fingers
yeah I think it's a mixture of ice or
even just their claws well never seen it
myself okay
I think we're gonna head to some Hot
Springs now so I've gotta swim in trunks
we're gonna get in
getting a late lunch this bakery we've
got some suit coffee coconut water
we've arrived at the hot springs of the
delicious lunch and it's a little bit
too crowded here so I think we're going
to change plans and go back to hotel
maybe jump back in the hot tub there and
I've got with anything today so before
dinner we've decided to go and jump in
the hot Sun briefly we've got love
you're like 20 minutes do I need to
leave yes I think it's worth it we
jumped out the tub to dinner again
dinner has arrived

lamb meat Wow

Canada I am heading to bed tomorrow if
the day's clear we're going up a gondola
up the mountain or we might be something
