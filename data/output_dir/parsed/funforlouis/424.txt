so guys we have stopped in Eureka the
sounds did an incredible drive last
night to get us here we are stopping by
this mechanics which is currently at his
lunch break but we have a problem
starting the wonder bug the battery's
fine all the mechanical work done
yesterday it seems to be great but
there's probably a wire loose or
something so we're gonna just check out
before we head off the rest of our road
trip I know the others are I think
they've got for breakfast some way
in the meantime risk of the cruise
around and my new boosted board that
they gave me yesterday
so we've given up waiting for bill he
was taken a very long time in his lunch
break so we're gonna pop out and get
some get another breakfast we had
breakfast when we arrived at 7 a.m. and
now it's not another breakfast now you
also want to catch up with the other
guys we didn't see him last night cuz we
were like so far behind it's like two
separate road trips in the moment we
need to be here
United Sam show us what we bought
provide everything except space for us
to prepare drinks and Louisville his
coffees twice this morning
just today just today today we're
getting a cup holder being which we're
gonna put Matt on top of the subwoofer
to solve all their problems sweet then
pour some oil now sounds looking for a
hairbrush get all the essentials
everyone what they think all right
should I cut my hair or should I leave
it like comments please help me out
let's have a little pause yeah let's do
it guys let him know
detangle and style
oh no idea but maybe I should just brush
it now I'll be good for the next two
months this guy this is like the only go
out not in a packet oh it's so
satisfying it's like a flowing mane now
you've got that right all right let's do
this fits the console organizer but it
might be a little bit too big so we
provided Dennis's place you can have a
little look at the engine and wiring
it's there so we had a fire and it
melted all this this seal and then some
of the wires got a charred a little bit
so I taped them up but they didn't look
damaged but this is all part of the
adventure though bye
the journey on the story
it also feels like when we overcome this
problem dislike the sense of my chin in
yeah we're like six
girl
just taking off
she has like food she'll be a brand-new
car yeah that's a good time guys
that means the alternator's charging the
battery thing try and turn the key Sam
see it's showing what happens so
situation update is we've diagnose the
problem is the starter motor there's
more than just the wiring sounds having
fun it's more than just the wiring it's
it's the star beau itself which needs
replacing so it's getting a bit late in
the day but we're gonna try and get a
replacement and see if Dennis can fit it
for us
continue up I think it's a wise idea
look this is the starter guys this is
what Dennis just took out of the wonder
bug replacement is just arrived
oh yeah
guys moment of truth Sam's just shown
Dennis the booster board
we bought this drinks cup holder unit
earlier in Walmart then this is just
lettuce a power drill then we're just
getting a lot of screws in
Walmart strikes again so we're well on
our way to meet our the other guys
we're just driving through golden hour
and I just pulled over I'm trying to
find someone to fill up gas but look I
just found this guy no biggy me guy
stares out amuse we love popcorn that's
a book good it's vicious
I'm telling you let the popcorn not my
finger buy the popcorn ready
most birds are this big in Australia now
this is an Australian bird look second
largest of all birds it's on our coat of
arms and as you know Australia is the
only country in the world that eat its
coat of arms we eat kangaroo and we eat
EMU steaks which kind of sucks for you
it's pretty bad we should do that so as
you can see guys right by this e me
there's this sinuses tore through tree
and the trees around here are massive
like giant redwood trees all right this
one right here that we can drive the
wonder bug through you can drive through
train all right let's see if we can get
these bad boys right oh yeah
we saw be fair trade oh my gosh we
country
yeah I got in three came through again
this is the weirdest sensation guys
being inside a tree
the trees are real big right there get
back
how's it feel booster boarding for a
tree Sam do you think it's the first
time so it's boosted water through this
tree I I plan over the next six months
to boosted poured over and under and
through everything else any hole you can
find and call all the way we're inside
the tree boys how is it still alive
so we've entered a part of America with
like zero cell service on any network
thankfully I've just managed to retrieve
my my map to get directions to where
we're going bro we're not gonna get
there to 1/2 10 so it's probably a good
idea to get some snacks in hey was the
best nap ice cream cookie another
crusade in my yet unhealthy tour through
America chocolate chip cookies with my
shrimp it's
oh whoa
 this is locked be worried yeah okay
we've got rabbit property
Harriet turn around so long night we
were sent a massive email with
directions have to get to the Airbnb
which is like in the middle of nowhere
in the forest it was such a long email
that we just didn't read it because it
was just a lot of effort so we've been
following Google Maps but apparently
it's taken us down the wrong road to
like a locked gate at the bottom of a
very steep track and now we can't turn
around
three point here
I love these signs
whoa
right we found this note on the van yes
park here walk up to the lodge with the
staff go lightweight at a tree house
full of road to the right I think we can
carry on going bro we're ignoring the
we're ignoring the sign so what did the
sign say instead you said go up further
and then take a right at the tree house
ah bro guys look at the tree house oh
yeah yeah full pelt go go go
you got this you got this
yes buddy I was like that means it's a
long walk and that means they don't
believe we had the best adventure like
five beds and so happy we're back with
you guys because we were like sad that
we've been having all right I'm just
reading the dinner of these guys cooked
earlier and then we're going to play
some games
it's almost 1 a.m.
grab my stuff out of the wonder bug
there try and get some sleep I think
we're gonna stay here tomorrow guys we
can put this another night and we're
just gonna spend some time out it's like
a retreat out in the woods there's no
internet there's zero and get my vlogs
up but there might be a chance for me to
whiz into town like a nearby town
tomorrow things it's been a it's been a
good day we've overcome another
mechanical problem and yeah we found
ourselves here
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
