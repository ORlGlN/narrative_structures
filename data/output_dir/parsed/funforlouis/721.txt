lots of people to meet this is our this
is our room whilst we're in we've come I
think we hooked up a pretty good room
Dave Dave's gonna sleep there is that
compu-date it's quite nice and cool yeah
you sleep there I miss having sleep here
maybe so we're being asked or two to get
my past because it's a bit hectic in the
main anime is so we have to say the
service elevators and escape through the
kitchen and now we've arrived it's fine
where I need to be once I got my past
and saw it this is colonies vmd of
VidCon
amen you excited for the it's couple of
days yes it's gonna be amazing
it's gonna be crazy right
hello no it's Laura guys like all right
you're good
are you good we just arrived like just
about to head out the hot tub and then
the Aussie boys arrived one wave yeah
is it one way one way these are the guys
that we chose after well mainly Dave
spending hours of going through so we
had Skye prove to people it's the soul
be project that a lot of you know has
been going on for the last I think was
it like a month go monster yeah
and then these guys have come over from
Australia to for us to all brainstorm
and we're gonna brainstorm and come up
with some exciting ideas to support what
they're doing we just got given some
amazing outfit Crouching Tiger Hidden
Dragon oh you look so stunning dive I
think we should give it a spank I'll
explain this whole thing layer as well
ways there's a reason there's a reason
right just our conversation so everybody
lawyers like fluro Friday and move down
sunrise the last two years on bundo and
bond is down at Bondi and then it went
to it's now eight beaches in Australia
every week and we've had 50 beach
overdue beaches worldwide from like the
States and Mexico shrank at India and
then what we do addressing for
before we go in the oceans everyone
comes down Iran's welcome all ages we do
a talk about mental health so we let
them know what what is all about and we
share that personal experiences with
mental health just so people know
they're not the only ones going through
it such a lonely thing to go through and
then we all go down the ocean like surf
together
catch pie away it's just it's some
people to swarm and then some people do
yoga so we have free yoga and the whole
idea is just to create this big
community that's connected by the ocean
and give people hope they can beat me
into health issues and so this is the
whole thing want to bring tomorrow it's
to say book the start in Australia but
you know it doesn't have to be at your
beach you could do it just have a flu at
your school we could do it at your
workplace and like together if we stand
together we can all bring this ugly
issue of mental health but making it fun
more fun than that
just to clarify tomorrow these guys are
doing a panel with us and that's what
we're planning well that's what they
planned it sounds amazing
I made a vegan and they won't hire these
under a play I have a camera with me as
I'll set up over and like record the
whole session right so guys I've ordered
