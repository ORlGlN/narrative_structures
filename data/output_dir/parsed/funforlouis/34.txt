Tour now and yeah this is exciting
you wouldn't think is it like feels as
big as it does on the outside yeah show
me go through each little bit and why
you chose what you did and all that kind
of stuff this is this is like our dining
room table and actually we had like nine
people here the other day like Nadine
Steve and Ryan we had so many people
here and it was great and then this
comes down this table goes down to
become bigger than a king bed yeah that
is cool so it's huge it's like this I
love this the other night in terms of
socializing because on the happiness bus
there's no place like this where you can
just all sit around whether you're like
eating or playing cards are just
chatting like we were the other night
this is yes is like awesome we have like
our shoes here that's like you're in
Vetta
that's our inverter so we have 3000
watts yeah
if surround sound in the front or back
or just like all around I feel like it's
nice I can actually stand up straight in
here as well I feel like I need to raise
the roof from there bust right yeah it's
like this I can fully that's good yeah
good and then so this is the kitchen
area how long have you had Lena by the
way five months renovated we've wound
her for like a year now yes okay if you

something similar this is amazing yeah
this is all barnwood so our
brother-in-law had an old barn then he
was gonna tear down wow there's like
salvaged yeah it was almost like there's
like bugs like our renovators sanded it
and like made it nice and it's just adds
a nice rustic feel yeah I love it
we just need the mini stove I like that
it's off grid but then it's also like
high-tech like you've got a little
workstation and shower nice nice I like
this little this little copper like
stinking yeah this is so good and it's
like a memory foam oh this is soft this
is really nice it's nice it's like a big
window did you put the windows there no
is that well and where air streams have
windows okay that's really good yeah
this is really spacious it feels like
yeah it feels really roomy our vision
for like how we want to live is totally
aligned and I feel like we're gonna get
some land somehow somewhere and start an
awesome community living together in the
next hopefully just as soon as possible
but there's so many hurdles and it's
gonna be such a long journey potentially
we're committed and and yeah I can't
wait to plan more and spend more time
with you guys it's like it's really
exciting and it's so cool to have you
guys here at the weekend and to welcome
us back and yeah
yeah like I see people hug I see people
cry for joy I see people come out of the
shower yeah imagine it and then like
you're saying this morning imagine this
not ending it's not just a weekend but
this is like a there's like a place
where people calm and find refuge and
some people like saying like they don't
have anyone to support them or
encouragement in life and then we come
here it's like a family yeah so it's
cool this is really cool guys yeah we'll
keep you posted on our plans and stuff
but yeah tomorrow night we should I
think we're gonna brainstorm how we can
do it
the series just show me his vintage
coffee grinder yeah yeah this is from
Vietnam I don't know is where like you
put the beans in here and then you turn
this and it it grinds them up that is
insane and then right here is where all
the coffee grinds go and then you do a
little pour over good vibe over here
yeah right here
French cress French press yeah this is
awesome this is awesome bro
okay we're gonna have a nice little chat
now a little reflection on the weekend
sharing about I don't know what venture
means to us what community means to us
me and I are gonna like lead through but
it's more about a community kind of a
group chat this is like the ultimate
people that you want to spend time with
and your mind can't wander to other
places because this is like where I
wanted to be out of anywhere else so I
want to have like more of these moments
in my life and this was one of them I
think humanity as a whole at the place
that we are right now there needs to be
an awful lot more people like us getting
together and maybe we weren't talking
about life-changing things but still
that is the first building blocks and
the platforms to build off and for being
surrounded by so many creators and
people that have been all over the world
and on so many
different types of things is is
inspiring it doesn't matter where you
come from or what kind of job you're
doing now or how old your whatever that
it really doesn't matter you can do it
if you want to and kind of yeah the last
summit already inspired a lot of us to
even have the courage to start uploading
our videos on YouTube and kind of be
creative and share our work and yeah
coming back to these events kind of
keeps you pushing kind of hard yeah and
say no you get it you gotta keep going
it's it's so important as people around
you that believe in you that spare you
one when you're feeling low that that
are rooting for you and I just want all
of you to know that and like I'm
speaking for all of us here but that
we're all here to support each other
with our dreams and and to pick each
other up and I'm certain that we're
gonna stay in touch and meet up again
whether it's another summit or traveling
together and collaborating together and
doing things but I think that's one of
the most valuable things that I've seen
from this weekend is that we can all
really be there for each other I just
didn't understand for such a long time
white people didn't didn't get me like
white whatever I said no one no one like
there was just like no like it's fine
you'll get this like nine-to-five job or
whatever and I said you don't get it and
if you you get it people and I love you
you're great I think like thank you so
much for forgetting it for understanding
I'm one of those people that jumps off
the building and I'll build my wings on
the way down and in the past three or
four months I've made some very rash
decisions and a lot of people around me
have basically told me you're too old to
be making these kind of decisions you
need me to think about other things and
for the first time in a long time it's
nice to know that they weren't that rash
they weren't that crazy and it's
perfectly acceptable to do those things
so thank you all I was always brought up
to I don't want to say hate but there
was there was a lot of hate in the
household and it was just over the last
five years or so and finding finding you
Louie that has really changed at truly
you know not personally knowing you like
JP but whether you like it or not your
change in people lives man and I'm one
of them so I've been on my own since I
was 15 my I left Sierra Leone when I was
10 and migrated right after the Civil
War migrated to the US with my dad and
he moved back to Sierra Leone I was
staying with my stepmother and she
kicked me out at 15 once she found out
he was having an affair so but it was so
many negative things um that I had to
overcome at such an early age I was
homeless I was whatever you can possibly
you know you named it but I knew that I
wanted to do something better with my
life um I finished high school and not
only that I went you know put myself
through college
got myself a first apartment at 19 and
became a home owner at 25 and while I
was doing those things the only thing
that was somehow that fill the void was
traveling but you know I don't really
tell people a detail of my life so the
extent of being nice to people because
you don't know what they're going
through it's really you don't look at
someone and think you know what they've
been through because I know what it
feels like to be in pain and be hurt so
I never want to put someone through that
and traveling it's something that I love
doing and the fact that you guys are all
here and you're so nice
please continue being that way because
I'm just like everyone here is super
nice and I'm really grateful to connect
with so many of you all for us a lot of
times we're making these videos and
staying up all night but we don't really
see what like the impact that they're
making and recently I've been feeling
like I'm not doing enough and like I'm
not making the most out of life and if I
were to die tomorrow I wouldn't be fully
content what I've done but this weekend
and it's like the hug we had at the girl
panel yesterday and this chat now is
yeah it's like totally showing me the
impact of what we're doing I think a lot
like you said riah you spend your life
trying to figure out how you can leave
your mark on the world and make it a
better place because you're here and
there are moments where you feel like
I'm not cut I'm not making the cut you
know but you'd never realize the impact
you have on other people I was brought
up focused on negative embed and that's
I've learned that most people are good
most people are the majority and you
cultivate that here with this that's
what this is about you're cultivating
the good having now completed one of the
biggest dreams of my life with JP the
next big dream and I've been talking
about it for probably a decade is
finding land building a commune having a
base with tree houses obviously and but
also more about being able to exactly
what you saying cultivate good and
cultivate this kind of environment but
living in a community of people like
this permanently would be just insane
and and be able to travel out from that
place and then come back and recharge
and support each other and dream
together and but having this rather than
once a year or twice a year having this
as the kind of space that you can live
in and for me that's that's like the
biggest dream right now awesome unless
than you it has anything else to add
live your life the skies were great
now very clear
okay is it guys that is the end of the
LTA California summit 2017 it was just
as amazing if not more amazing line than
I imagined that it could have been I'll
continue to I guess kind of I don't know
like process this last couple of months
and how everything's been for me and
there's so much I haven't been able to
share and stuff that we're kind of
keeping for the documentary some of the
the I guess the tougher times and the
the friction between me and JP at times
yeah I think yeah I'm just really
looking forward to after having a good
long break is plowing through the edits
on the documentary Kip who came
yesterday was it was the day before to
there to do a talk on Carroll split well
he made cowspiracy and what the health
and he talked about his journey of being
a vegan and he's had like wildly
successful documentary so he's going to
help hopefully with the kind of guiding
and I am learning from him a bit about
the the post-production stuff so yeah
look if we're showing you that to you
guys again if you haven't yet please do
pre-order the documentary it will help
us a lot shout encouragement I'll link
that below and yeah I guess catch you
guys tomorrow for a whole new adventure
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
