fine afternoon guys we had to be able to
change in plan today we were supposed to
leave shrine conversing in the morning
the weather on the flight light of the
room basically go really bad overnight
so we cancel
so in that a super chilled morning and
now me and JC are going out for the
tuk-tuk is better enjoyed by the temple
nearby
you know they surround them do joining
us as well Sri Lanka is so beautiful
meaning the antedates lovely we saw an
elephant last time around midnight
misleading by the weather the house at
the I think Oh Lord
which is pretty special
so we were right this is the this is the
temple here
is this a Buddhist temple
so I do really love the written language
and SriLankan check it out
hello so this this monk just met his his
house here this is made from a mixture
of like dirt and cow dung mixed together
quite a few people around the world used
after building material must be pretty
strong and then I think this is a leaf
from a coconut palm guys have you ever
seen kitten suckling that's so amazing
is this where the elephants drink these
little frogs little the little frogs
somewhere in this little pond there's a
crocodile I don't know whether they're
joking or not must be really small
cooking ah
right back in the tuk-tuk I'm going to
do some follow shots of the dry
we're looking for the elephant's no luck
yet
alright time for dinner
well it's 1:00 a.m. I'm going to be
heading to bed soon we have to be up in
three hours and hopefully we will be
leaving Sri Lanka shortly after that but
depends depends on whether the weather
behaves itself and this next flight is
quite a long flight over the ocean and
this area I don't have our saying before
but it's part of the world is the
weather's like the worst kind of weather
you want to be flying through what is
the most kind of temperament or storms
can pop up out of nowhere so yeah JP is
concerned understandably and yeah I've
just got to be very wise which is why we
didn't fly it this morning it's been a
pretty chilled day today I managed to
catch up on some sleep from the night
before that and manage to get some edits
done and yeah I'm really excited for the
next week or so I'm excited to get to
Bali and that should be a lot of fun
right I'll catch you guys in the morning
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
