good morning guys
Alan has left he's got a train home I am
now going to the YouTube space to have a
little meeting with YouTube should be
nice first meetings done had a cool
meeting with YouTube
now I've just headed across to the other
side of London having my second meeting
for the day ok guys I'm all done all
done we were makings now very productive
very boring for you guys I'm sorry sorry
I'm now and trying to find a little
coffee shop below the bike tower bridge
check it do you know what I've never
seen Tower Bridge open so you know the
middle bit opens when like big boats on
three where they've got massive baths
and stuff so a little basic all of that
he's just chilling but that bridge in
the middle there actually opens up when
there's massive boat
this is actually part of London I don't
often walk around but it's really
beautiful you ever get a chance to
comment this is this is the spot we'll
say you got the crazy new buildings in
London at the Gherkin and stuff right
next to Tower of London over there old
school I was saying this a second ago
guys by loving older architecture
alongside and contrasting with newer
modern buildings like that like that
look
so this is something not a lot of people
know but by London Bridge in the centre
of London there is a pirate ship an
actual pirate ship check this out
it's always here doesn't actually say oh
how cool is that it looks like you can
actually go on it it's a living history
museum guys I'm gonna do that next time
we were in London and have some time so
my sister Hilary has just arrived at
London Bridge we're gonna go out on a
little adventure
and find someone to have some dinner
together and catch up
I always end up doing this when I'm with
people it's basically in London there's
no real thing is like jaywalking like in
America so just kind of stroll across
the road but I always leave like my
sister or whoever I'm with across the
other side when it's like a red man
sorry it's my long legs food has a ride
I got like super green kale salad with
falafel and some sweet potato fries and
some carrots and stuff what do you
guys I've just arrived back servitude
I feel very sick this ain't a meal with
my sister had a great time at her then I
decided to come back to me my bed mat so
I jumped in an uber to waterlily those
roadworks the whole way miss my first
train literally jumped up a bit early
and sprinted to catch the train either
stop why I got from the Train
literally hyperventilating I'm so unfit
like running with my back packing bags
and stuff I was like there wheezing
people are literally asking if I was
okay and that was like half an hour ago
and I'm still recovering
I am so sorry Matthew well I've been
hanging out with Matt for the remainder
of the evening I've come back to Dave
and Matt and Alan's house and I'm gonna
crash here tonight because I've realized
my car what my grandpa's car that I've
been burrowing he's actually at Steve's
house and that happens to be going there
tomorrow so he's gonna drop me off and
I'll get it
but yes been there it's been a kind of
random day so sorry that it's not me
that eventful but like always I
appreciate me enough to share it with
you take you along and I thought what a
day before signing out is show you guys
some of the answers that you gave the
question that Ryan asked last week which
was if you could go back in time and
change one thing what would it be if I
could go back into time I would go back
to 2012 that's when I left my high
school to go to another one
I would prevent myself from leaving so I
could stay in the school to have a
stronger relationship with my friends
than I have now because I feel it's kind
of distance right now and I think that
if I would have stayed that I would have
a stronger relationship with them if I
could go back in time once and change
one thing I would probably change the
way how I live my life because it's
really kind of hard for me right now
because currently you know really lazy
and it's really hard for me to exercise
and it's really hard just really hard if
I could go to the past and change one
thing I'll probably make my dad harder
so he would let me go to this
prestigious sport event that was
selected to participate in it because I
I worked really hard to get into the
team and the fact that it did he didn't
let me go kind of brings me down
because the sport event could have been
life-changing if I could go and no I
cannot go anymore so yeah those
responses thanks for sending them in
there was only a few but they were quite
personal and yeah I just I felt for you
guys and it's difficult sometimes when
things don't go to plan and they don't
go our way but I would do and the advice
I'd give you is don't let those things
stop you don't live it don't live
regretting that things didn't go the way
you wanted them to but I guess look for
words and look to ways to change the
future and you don't have to kind of be
held back by things have happened and
I'd say yeah look for ways around the
obstacles that coming up half life isn't
always easy and I think part of learning
how to overcome those things is what
helps build our character and give us
strength and courage to you know combat
fear and things that you know hold us
back so yeah yeah just keep going guys
and yeah thanks again for sending them
in it's always good to learn more about
you guys and what's going on in your
lives
I'd say without getting too personal but
one of the things I'd go back and change
in my life I'm not gonna go into detail
but there's probably certain people that
I would choose to have never met because
of the damage they've done to me it's
not something I regret but I think I
would you know if I couldn't probably
change that but yeah the question I got
to ask you guys this week which is a bit
more positive is what the things in your
life that help you thrive one of the
things that don't just help you survive
your life but
really flourish you know things that
just make you your happiest you're most
kind of satisfied and content bring
contentment
and help you be the best version of
yourself so what the things that do that
for you let me know um like usual you
can send your video clips in and I'll
include them in next week's video yeah
awesome I will catch you guys in the
morning
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
