good morning guys it's our fourth day I
think it's our fourth day in that Court
and me and JC have come out this morning
to explore a market a cash one of the
local guides that we've been hanging out
with recently the last couple of days
recommend we came come here this is its
worry market and we haven't had
breakfast yet so I just bought three
bananas and I figured out it only cost
me five cents a banana
so it was like ten rupees the free
bananas absolute crazy the bananas are
so good out here that I just bought for
more but another ten rupees these are
like these are only these are less than
five cents each these are like for these
are like three and a half cents each so
change
this is this is bizarre like I'm used to
drawing attention like I'm quite so
unrecognizable but here like everyone is
like what the heck like who are you
everyone is looking at us like staring
in a friendly way though it's so amazing
people are just feeding this cow
wherever it goes
right we've got given the roses
so just to my mind my air something I
find amazing about being here is like
normally when I'm places like this
people don't care they're funny about us
taking their photos but what I'm here is
people are asking us to come over and
say their photos which is just amazing
because there's such interesting people
here it's also very noisy in case you
decide
that's good are you enjoying this Jesse
everything everything yes candy
the Sun is coconut we're gonna try and
cost over a bill like I'm going to get
hit for every angle
crossing the road in India is an
adventure but I love meeting the cows
around here they're so friendly
okay so other than the bananas we
weren't sure which Street food to trust
especially as the fact that we're
hopefully flying tomorrow out of India
so we don't want a bad stomach so we we
found the restaurant we're going to let
it loose out we're doing
we're gonna try though some vegetable
noodles just finished a burger with I
had to take the cheese off they said it
wasn't gonna come with cheese but veggie
burger JC's got peach so which looks
pretty nice
and you got the vegetable meters as well
amazing amazing
jacy's just ducked into the shop to get
a little souvenir and we're about to
meet back up with a cache where we're
meeting in we just stopped check it out
this is called candy game
hello
hey Leslie hello Louis
what's your name what's your name
all right we've met back up with the
cats
and Divya hey
thanks for coming to get us
so we've stopped for a coffee and we got
these drinks like apparently these were
the only drinks available and guys if
you've ever been to this place if you're
from India this is the most disgusting
during I've ever taste in my life like
it's coconut something but I didn't know
the other thing was and it's like it
literally tastes like mouthwash I mean
it does look like mouthwash what did you
think guys do never never get this drink
but Divya's like quite happily sipping
away you like it yeah maybe but maybe
you if you drink this from a kid then
you'd get used to the taste but it's
just so strong it's called a refresher
as well based like the least refreshing
thing
all right dinnertime we've met back up
with JP what is this Fork River snip or
glue and you can see they're not a key
made yeah they just cut the food up that
is amazing okay I think this place is
predominantly a meat restaurant where
you tricking me getting stuck in they
know what half this stuff is
I am intrigued by this fork though this
guy Mandy has just arrived
he found us today after watching our
Instagram stories and he's joining us
for dinner and he's just giving us this
prison what is this this is orange
roughy
dessert okay okay when we finish this
I'll uh I'll have Bonilla guys
literally this is the eighth time
they've sung happy birthday to people in
distress for like more than half the
restaurant it's a birthday today
it's JC's but they next week so we've
asked for a little special song tonight
as well
so JP showed us the other day like the
most dissatisfying video in the world
and YouTube and is like it's like an OCD
person's nightmare where they're like
buying things all wrong anyway that's
that's exactly what Jay Z didn't taste
like into the loose at the swapping cuts
just like be random let's try this let's
try this out
one come back all that welcome
guys are really nice
it's not too sugary it's just nice that
I can play super boy I loved it
tonight - no I might have another one of
those yeah I love that
check this out they actually just print
it out a photo that is really cool I
like that I think more restaurants to do
that right I've just ducked out of a
hotel to get some Red Bulls for tomorrow
morning because we're getting up at 4:00
a.m. for our flight to Sri Lanka
it's gonna be another crazy early one
another smell of incense yeah okay I
managed by three Red Bulls and the
packet of coconut biscuits I think get
any more cash outs we need all the cash
we can get for the old tomorrow the
paying for fuel and or charges and then
we'll need to pay them again to Sri
Lanka I probably need to change a lot of
the money into US dollars if you've seen
the last couple of flights we've done
and pretty much every air will be now
flying into you and have to pay in cash
and I've already spent over five
thousand US dollars in cash on the fioor
one fuel since we left at with abbath
which is insane but when we get to
Australia is gonna be nice again it'd
probably go to pound card right see you
bright nearly 4 a.m.
peace out enjoy life
