good morning guys I am in Zurich at the
airport about to jump on the flight to
Linz and Greece if you're a little bit
confused where JP is and where the plane
is right now we're taking like a week
away from the plane as it's getting some
maintenance done JP needs to swap the
paperwork and stuff so we have
temporarily gone our separate ways but
I'm just trying to film as much cool
stuff as I can and meet cool people a
lot of this trip was about kind of meet
local people and sharing stories from
people so I've kind of been following
these opportunities I've been getting
one of which was here in well back in
Freiburg in Germany where I was this
morning and the last few days was just
to meet some locals but also meet some
refugees that have been coming into
Germany over the last few years and now
I am heading to anthems and then Lesvos
the island of lesbos where there's a
massive refugee camp where a lot of
Syrian refugees are going and this is
quite a big thing that's been happening
happening in Europe it's quite a big
topic and quite a kind of a point of
tension for a lot of people so you know
I thought it'd be cool to I guess go and
interview some people chat
people learn a bit about it and share
that with you guys and capture some
stuff the documentary we're making so
anyway that's the that's the deal that's
what's happening and yeah I'm also going
to meet my friend area who's coming to
help shoot some stuff he's gonna be
helping film whilst we're in the grease
so I'm gonna head through now and
catch my flight in time from running a
little bit late
so I just landed in Athens
that's a nice little flight like $2
powers managed to get a little bit sleep
now I'm going to grab an uber to the
ferry port where I'm gonna be me my
friend Aria he's I think his flights
about to land and like an hour and then
also this guy's Seraphim you the guy
that invited us - well it's 20 plus 6
and it is so nice and warm guys this is
the first proper warm place we've been
since we're in the u.s. we've just been
like further up like northern hemisphere

vibes
hello Greece this is a nice welcome
