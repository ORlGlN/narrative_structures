we're gonna go to some horse stables we
can hang out with some horses see what
they're saying sweet so it decided to
get off the m25 because the traffic is
long so I'm fortunately not gonna go to
see any horses but we have stopped at a
service station and we thought what
would Louie do in this situation so we
decided we're gonna go and grab a coffee
the only logical choice
so got the service station
exactly same wonder see when I go to at
night
some go upstairs to go to on sofas check
out this children so we leave in
Starbucks what we did now today we're
gonna go and chill moaning on rent in
common I just looked at my tire I
thought what the hell is going on what
is that I think there's a strawberry
milkshake I think Dave what's just
happened mate we took a wrong flip in
turns gonna come off the m25 when in the
car park came out the carpark and
guitars toos Roy guns and ninety pence

I'm actually just gonna head over to
Adam's house with Alan and Matt and
we're gonna jump in a swimming pool and
we're leave Dave here because he's a
long-haired and then take these guys so

night barbecue jumping in the pool table
tennis smash down now we're gonna jump
in the car and go somewhere I don't know

what's goin on me well we were thinking
about getting a little Starbucks because
it's only right given the end of the
night but we think maybe we should go to
