Park we're gonna find something fun to
do it's not a super sunny day but it's
quite warm
well up till that half so we're trying
to get into the subway and turns out
they're looking problem or something
so we chilled in Central Park for a
little bit and lay down in the Sun
that's nice I've now decided lost in New
York I should probably go get a massage
because means things were talking about
the whole week we didn't have one so
I've found a little Thai massage place
across the road so I'm going in for a
60-minute deep tissue massage where I
was singing the lobby cool little ginger
tea check out Oh guys it's just what I
needed
oh just so relaxed and the know I have
state tests wolf I've been doing this
week
probably left over from the horse-riding
yeah that's what it was having a
demotion set
and Raya got her nails done you know
I've never had what's called a pedicure
you should get one the manicure as a
manicure manicure yeah I should get what
is that candy guys do that
it's not very manly not very badly so
guys I am heading to the airport in
pretty soon like 10 minutes and what to
waiting for the car with is going to eat
some lunch it's quite late lunch but we
managed to find some curry I'm
introducing riot or more Indian food

they'll be nice nice to family
turn through and it's my gate just
notice this
very attempts to get another massage
look at this in the airport all airports
need one of these
thank you very much to show your place
thank you
so I'm doing the classic vlogging in the
toilet again this always happens on the
flights but it's less intrusive and
interrupting than vlogging from my seat
everyone's asleep at the moment I'm
halfway across the Atlantic Landing in
two hours and I'm pretty sure my
sleeping patents going to be very messed
up tomorrow but I'm looking forward to
being back in England it was an amazing
week in New York pretty chilled day
today I
I feel pretty pretty tired from the week
even though I took a couple of days off
but take this opportunity seeing as it's
been a chilled blog today to enlist your
guy's help
now basically like what a rebrand my
channel it's it's in need of a bit of
rebrand and the intro animation and the
edge and slate as well I'm looking to
redo now I did commissioned a designer
to try some ideas out they failed
miserably like catastrophic ly failed so
I wondered whether I could ask you guys
any of you guys that design and would be
willing to attempt a redesign a rebrand
on my channel just a new logo if any of
you were animators could do some cool
animated intro
and obviously if you if it's something I
love I will use it on my channel and
I'll be happy to promote in the
description of all my videos the
designer that creates something that's
incredible so potentially if you are a
freelance designer it could bring you
quite a bit of work so I'm hoping
someone watching this video or my videos
can help me in my dilemma my time of
need
so yeah I'll link an email below in the
description where you can email some
ideas that have been credible that's
about it I will see you tomorrow and
I've got up I've got some fun stuff
planned this week it should be pretty
cool right peace out enjoy life and live
the adventure
