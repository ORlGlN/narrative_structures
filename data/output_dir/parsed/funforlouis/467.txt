stopped off to get a little view of the
mountains those the clouds is you wait
to be like
so we're at 3800 meters again and we're
above the clouds how crazy is that
so we've just arrived at a textile
center and they're gonna talk a little
bit how they make all these rugs and so
this is this project thinking in the
culture in the language in the
traditions farming management of the
land but the most important the revival
of traditional texts their undying past
to the younger generations we can give
enhance literally no way this is alpaca
wool it's a rainbow
they're just washed alpaca wool and
they're gonna show us how they diet Wow

that simple was the game
Tina's learning how to weave with the
Bulls of wool and she snapped it she
broke it
everything that's made has a little tag
on it and has a photo of the woman who
mr. death and also information like when
they were born and stopped their name
right this place is incredible
I can't believe the amount of work put
in just to make like one blanket weeks
and weeks apparently every seven
centimeters takes a whole day to Nick
you can imagine how long something like
that would take these blankets how crazy
is this place friar it's amazing I was
just saying to my blog that we are so
disconnected from like where we get our
stuff from just like throw money and buy
t-shirts like don't care so being here
