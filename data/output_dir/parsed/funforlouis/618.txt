how it does I'm hoping it doesn't fill
with water but I've been insured it way
guys this is the boat we're going on
after we've been diving and we're gonna
go for a little trip on that I think
we're having lunch and they live in
London eh I'm sad that nicotine come I
forgot to tell you guys the recent Nick
isn't with us is because he was feeling
a little bit ill before him so we've
left him at the hotel to recover
guys we've just come up riah didn't come
up with us we kind of lost her
underwater which is quite bad we're
thinking she just got overexcited and
was like looking at sufficiently but
they've gone to look for her yeah
there's two those two instructors
looking on over there you see it's right
there
we found her she how did she go over
there okay I think we're good guys
think she's safe do you think she panics
underwater yeah if I lost everyone I
I need to be okay
right other than getting lost did you
enjoy it did you see any cool animals
what did you see
goodbye banks we've upgraded to a little
yacht we're gonna go out with an
adventure wit now well the sea was a
little bit murky so we couldn't see lots
of animals but it was still pretty cool
and because it's so murky I think that's
why Raya lost us as well I can't wait to
ride amber you know swim around in
totally clear water what was your
favorite thing about the dice
I feel like meditation I felt like I was
like actually a bitch
and then I one of those moments at
Toronto's Lake Como
good job staying alive

all right it's sweet but I only let a
living room
oh there's a bed down there it's little
