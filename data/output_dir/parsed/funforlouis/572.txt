so Louie andreas still sleeping it's
just gone midday so because it's
beautiful weather my dad and I are going
to go out for a bike ride and I grab two
GoPros and I thought I'd take you guys
along you know you can see a bit of New
Zealand and yeah it should be pretty
kick ass
so this is my dad's bike KTM this is the
one I'm riding BMW and it's got a nice
tank bag on it so I can leave my camera
in there which is pretty handy
my sky
you
get off her new noise I have it the live
this morning
I have not I'm not a good sleeping
pattern right now that JP has got back
from his motorcycle right and you know
we're heading off to collect for
campervan we have about 45 minutes
right we managed to get our van with
five minutes to spare
Ryan those are the important information
to remember like do you have it like
printed out anywhere and he's like no
probably do that so much information so
she knows how to operate over that we
got like a toilet and everything ever
have a little look around
check this out like a full-on kitchen
it's like a shower and toilet in here
you can even have a shower whilst on the
toilet how great is that uh with this is
like so luck true this is crap with a
microwave oh my gosh no here yes this is
what I need bugs this is great
you ready for an adventure so excited I
thought we were gonna get come it's
so short notice it's like peak season a
new Xena right now like every single cut
like apparently and puts out a bow there
are a lot hair so we're following JP
back tears now
before we head off to somewhere the name
it's actually her good to go
we should probably come up with a kind
of loose plan for where we're heading
I'm thinking the place called hot water
beach which I came to like two years ago
you can dig in the sand and there's like
hot springs coming up you can like
basically make your own jacuzzi so you
can even their light and stuff
maybe wish you do it's not okay you're
so far away
got a cheeky little apple salad what are
these
eggplant fritters alright JP's off
silhouette man thanks and yeah like me
and write to hit the road oh it's do
this
well it was quite a windy journey over
the mountains and briar I was trying to
rest in the back and I don't think she
rested much to do now my bed fell off
the thing near me
no yeah it was like a roller coaster I'm
suffering for my life let alone tennis
week I was driving very carefully it's
just really windy here we are hot water
beach yeah so guys we just turned up at
this campsite and thankfully they had a
spot for us apart tonight and we're just
following this security woman down
through our spot we've got a little
space with some power
she's on her bike there you go guys this
is our spot for the night so rise to
show me how to make the beds because I
wasn't there when the guy was telling us
ok guys it's almost 2:30 in the morning
I thought this would be the best time to
go down to the beach because I don't
think many people are going to be down
there I've got the shovel I've got the
map for directions and I've done all my
editing back in the van
Ryder's been sleeping for a little bit
so she's still waking up I'm super
excited
apparently there's gonna be like glow
worms and stuff and I walk down there
and we have to hurry because at 3:40 the
tide is going to come back in and we
won't be able to dig there the hot water
jacuzzis natural jacuzzis you ready for
this wire she's literally fast asleep
like five minutes ago
guys we have found the glow worms I
don't know if you can hope to see this
but come check this out
this it's not like super bright birth
I've reached it in here the ways to find
all these areas of hot water Springs on
out on like get digging guys we found
some hot water so we dig here but you
keep looking
places the gate

and find another pool because that one
suddenly filled a sea war and it's
freezing

back look at that guy's yes buddy it's
now 5:30 in the morning we're back on
our campervan nice and cozy we had a
pretty awesome nighttime adventure but
it's uh time to get some sleep now I
think we have to leave this place in
like 11 latest yeah best Corgi that
makes sure we made the most of the day
all right I'll catch you guys in the
morning
and we have no idea where we're going
next but we're we're gonna oh maybe
