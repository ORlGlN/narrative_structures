good morning guys today I'm at the board
masters Festival with Molly these are
the guys I went to Jamaica with in
November last year I'm just gonna be
hanging out with them today and checking
out what they're doing they've got a
little pop-up shop here and then over at
the the festival where we were last
night
there's a little stage area which
hopefully I'm gonna be DJing a little
bit later on which is pretty exciting
cause I have a DJ probably in a while
plays check out this camper van this is
even older than the one I got in the
u.s. it's a split screen
situations changing unification like
this is enough he's a pro sir but the
plan was
mamie Ben was gonna take me out into the
water I had the moment and not keen it
looked super park cold and he may
persuade me later on but we'll see play
in the meantime we're gonna go over to
he makes surfboards we're gonna go over
to his factory and check out how
surfboards are made which I don't really
know but he said I might even get a
chance to have a little go hello right
I'm jumping in Ben's van we're gonna
head over there now I just need to swing
faster a B&B that I need to book for
Mike boys so this is it skinned dog skin
dog surfboards he give us a stupid quit
or show us how it works when I start to
finish how do you make a surfboard
okay yeah yeah I might we were just
check I might at some stage well so like
really get the passion for surfing which
I think it's slowly building I might
come in and design my own board has
taken up e so yeah so you got like a CAD
like a so this is 3d shape and room
really and you just know you kinda from
experience what kind of shapes are good
for what way exactly Ben's been surfing
since he was freedom yes and as he kind
of worked with design she's grown and
you know now I have files that I go to
for specific people specific models that
I remake and make over and over again
and then you send that off to a company
that print and more do you have that bit
we may it's a CNC machine down
which is one of our best folks and he
runs machine we also finish his circle -
in factory suite so it's a great
relationship and then show us where how
they arrived like when you get them here
so they come in so a CNC machine I
things like you give it a 3d design and
then it intelligently like makes that
basically do the mills yeah so as you
can see it has an outline is this like
is this like polystyrene foam what's
moving okay there's still a lot of work
to do in shaping room you still no idea
you know you can still majorly screwed
up after this stage okay
you don't know what you're doing you've
got the right as you probably even find
out surely what we're doing is we're
going to obviously the templates having
to kind of here at the tail we're just
looking for this below into this line
doing one nice smooth motion that's it
buddy this became its hokey better
pretty tightly vertical and you're
literally gonna bet let the team down
let's put into it we're just gonna
happen
right really yeah that was a lot of fun
it's a little bit scary because you know
if you mess up then you're gonna have to
start from scratch again so for a
blogger yeah okay okay
so now seriously you did great so after
that the board comes into this into this
really sits the way to get laminated in
this room here this is where we put the
fins in we use tubes like this and
routers to to route the fin boxes out
before so this is where yeah this is
where I can imagine having a lot of fun
we're quite lucky you have a little
compressed up but we have this machine
we can offer 38,000 colors and
flip-flops metallics Pantone's whatever
what this system is designed to keep
quality of paint so are you can stir it
you stone twice a day which keeps the
consistency to paint oh no way nice I
didn't know there's so much involved
with the transduction finally let me can
I see some of the finished boards it's
got a short perhaps a loser first of all
I'm going to show you is the one that we
were scientists yeah yeah as I said
before us is one of my favorite boards
and this is what I was cutting guys down
there and that's you made this exact
same way templated it and well thanks
for showing me around that yeah yeah I'm
gonna plan at some point to come back
here look of staying and hopefully learn
a bit more about surfing if you are ever
a new key calm down check this guy out
was it skin dog in dog skin dogged
surfboards
right back at fistful beach the Sun has
come out it is turned into Ashley a
glorious day it was so miserable this
morning but I'm glad the weather's
changed guys look at the size of these
pans look at that I could lie in there
Ike literally lay in there and I got my
chicken curry fried the boys that come
down we're just trying out some of the
Molly headphones would you recommend you
can't hear me I feel good
got a little bit unfortunately where
nothing to make Oh God give me one of
these bayous too big take my carry-on
home so they can give me another one
really fine
I think I had one of these before is
this a new design sweet yeah nice and I
think a lot of the Molly stuff they use
like recycle it's kind of eco-friendly
that's why that's why I like work
hey if this is a display one so I'll
leave this for display and I took this
one in there oh nice
thank you
so Riya is over the hotel we're gonna go
pick her up and then we're gonna head
over to the festival and decent deejay

the festival I had a little lion she's
not being another percent he does get
some work done for this worked out well

evening of fun the music and good vibes
