good afternoon guys today is a pretty
exciting day for me because my friend
Alex
Emily are getting married if you
remember about a month ago I went to
Alex's stag dude where we had lots of
fun and dressed
tweed and cycled around and then went
down to fall for a fishing trip but
today is their big day so yeah it's
gonna be cool again just seeing a bunch
of my friends and getting to celebrate
with everyone so I am heading to the
ceremony now which I probably won't kill
much of
Wow that was a very nice ceremony so
many people again guys whenever I go to
these like friends events and
celebrations I just see like people
haven't seen in years and I know I
always say it but it's like it always
surprises me because it's like yeah
little parts of your history and past
and yeah very nostalgic and it is now to
start keeping up with rain check this
out and we are driving to the area we're
having like a meal and then I think
there's a party tonight and yeah that's
gonna be a good day
you let go is a cap yeah this is pretty
fast in there
while the wedding photographer has
worked his magic the rain held off for
just enough time for everyone to get the
photos done and now we're heading in
some tea oh yes Steve what you saying
you having a good day but guys you
missed the earlier Steve song a song on
stage with the food the boys
where is this us
all right dinner has arrived I've got a
vegetable puff pastry pine and mashed
potato

actually put my fingers all over it
right just finishing up dinner

for me everyone other wedding people
enjoyed it
just trying to get around the air
they failed mice
yeah I think you are impossibly
beautiful
I'm very excited to marry very excited
to be married
you are a great companion and a complete
all-rounder you are around two skills as
well to you
family and friends as
okay so what we couldn't take to bring a
little journey from how we know that
it's and just some of this massive
character flaws really basic reason I
joined that men speak and I'll happily
take back for the second part of form an
attack I'm sorry for that speech what do
you think and of course the internet
fame they came to giving sound
professional advice as doctor in fact a
few web-based heroes in here doctor
later gets poison arrows a toast
Daleks and
now organizing its funnel-like in harm's
way
the Freud informatics nemenyi
they're leaving right now don't start
here
we go in going out
well the wedding is finished and I am
heading back to my parents for the night
and it's been another very heartwarming
day a friendship and reuniting with
people
let me got me thinking just like I guess
I haven't really thought this much
before but looking around the room today
with everyone there that I've kind of
grown up with and spent different
periods of my life with it made me
realize like you do go through kind of
different phases of July typically you
leave home maybe go to university or
move out with some friends and then
that's like a very exciting freeing time
when you're learning a lot about the
world and then and then you kind of go
through your 20s and you get a job maybe
you're still lit with friends or maybe
go back to live with your family and
then there's this very distinct phase
where most people will get in a
relationship and move in together or you
know then get married nots not too long
after that and then then it's the whole
family vibe and it's just quite
interesting I've never in my head broke
in my life up into phases before because
I guess I don't typically follow how
society
you know tells you to live but I just
yeah are just observing it tonight and
just realizing yeah this is crazy like
the reason I don't see a lot of these
people nowadays it's because we're in
totally different phases
my life's probably more reflective of
people in their 20s like you know a bit
more free traveling a lot not always but
that is typically the case and then a
lot of the guys near my age are a lot
more settled and that's why I rarely see
them and only end up catching up at
these events but that's fine that's just
the way the life is sometimes and you
you go through times when you're hanging
out with people a lot and and then
you're gonna move on like Raya was
saying the other day when we were in Sri
Lanka she was saying you know she thinks
of life as as these intertwining vines
sometimes and then they kind of go off
the separate ways and I think that's
what I've realized with a lot of people
is it's just natural to to go off your
separate ways sometimes and move on and
it's just nice to reconnect like today
it's very nice lots of
catching up and good conversation and
yeah I know I have been a bit weird some
of you guys kind of just a little window
into a kind of special day for Alex and
Emily he probably don't know it all but
it's what I did today and it meant a lot
and I'm glad I could take you along and
share some of it with you and I'm gonna
head in now get some sleep and I'll
catch you tomorrow
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
