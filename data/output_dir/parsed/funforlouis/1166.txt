we just walked out the end of our
corridor in the hotel where I live in
the jungle or about that breakfast
we've got hard-boiled eggs french toast
what's the plan this morning then we're
gonna get married bet she's still like
laying up and we're gonna hit the road
at 230 kilometers to be slow and run
it's like the name will go well
that was a lovely breakfast
so we've finally found that it's very
similar to blocking the petrol tank so
the petrol engine or three room service
potential our exist and we're only two
tons of
so they get fixed
so me and Ben are going to jump in Mary
and help them take you around to the
carriage to get fixed
apparently the problem is there's dirt
in the fuel line from the main tank and
that's what's been causing a lot of
problems so oh look what you found big
load the Frog is a froggy pants though
the whole village has come to help boys
just their pet cow just chillin there
hey mate even see Moomin I'm here in
Jones herding a cow with a touch up
Harry what's happened mate
I have lost my money those 70 quid so
that's like only rupees 77 thousand
that's like seven thousand rupees so I'm
not sure a strong social tuk-tuks send
to my bag like three times over that
would have happily lasting is the end of
the trip as well we stopped to this kind
of petrol station last night and this
guy came up to me and awkwardly hugged
me and then next thing I know I don't
have my wallet on me so I think I may
have been robbed last night and we are
off on our third day on the ritual run
we first down that encourages Mary
look at we found more reassuring that I
change the engine so it's raining the
other guys have water leaking all inside
and let's want to sort it out we seem to
be pretty weather proof what do you
think there yeah it's getting over well
and there yeah alright we're hanging in
I'm pretty dry
basically we've just kind of pulled over
and monsters around he heads us they
just started to see through the window
and I think that were just sort of
starting slow and it looks like this
kind of electrical cells butter so
friends are drivers without a fight
there's a wire
so we're not sure what's wrong it's
raining so we've decided for a second
time to toe marry until we get somewhere
where we can kind of have a proper ler
for rain stop whoever
Karen seem like they might be able to I
already know what they're telling I
think we'll probably luck
popping on my bedroom I learn the
Midland notes on the side of the road
and it's some of the best food some of
the stories I've ever tasted
I mean you'd expect the current media
find the right that was a delicious
lunch the rain has stopped and now we're
hitting the road some more ritual
runners oh that's anyone out that
we've been driving a few hours and we've
stopped all to let the engines cool down
to have a little break and we are kind
of on track we're not running too late
and apparently this room is that there's
Wi-Fi at the hotel tonight
and I haven't posted the Instagram or
tweeted in days so I'm really excited
how are you boys doing I'll know my
voices go from singing too much I've
been singing Bastille at the top my
voice I've really should have a bit of
that
bye ugly it's been a bit of rough there
if I'm honest because I have my money
stolen and then one of my films that I
was shooting on overexposed and
basically ruins I lost like 26 motives I
I did spare upsetting well you know many
go on right
how are we not going yet
this car a truck over so can I trust all
that truck and we look up and lit shits
headlights through in front of us and
Jacqueline swerves off the road I think
it was like that close to our car like
pushing off the road
yeah we're about 12 kilometers away from
Jaipur which is the original destination
okay and like 4550 from the one with
Wi-Fi the next 25 kilometers the road is
 pothole but then our flag gets
a bit better not good like not flat road
but better I haven't talked into me -
she reckons it if we do want to push
through which I'm pretty sure we all do
why that's good is because it gives less
distance tomorrow which means we won't
go into the nightmare in Bihar one two
it's raining again railing can I get
rain with that we are in a crazy
thunderstorm on the craziest road yet
and it's met and lightning
there's lorries let's pose there's
near-death experiences
in one
oh my God look wow the guys literally
just squeezed in between two lorries to
try and overtake how are you finding a
max it's actually quite fun I'm enjoying
it I go party and I'm soaked
they lost a tire off the road
oK we've we've broken down it's not a
good place it's raining and I don't know
what's happened but we were going to try
get it started again
how's that Jack that was gently one of
the scariest things I've done on this
run
I had emergency sawed twice because the
distance between me in that car is
nothing and the minute they braked
which is quite frequent I'd be like wow
jam on the brakes telling about emotions
the racket at once I'm soaking wet and
we've arrived at Hotel Apollo Jack you
won't be long till we get our rooms
Jack's got his room yeah we've got
coffee
we've got laptop Club I'm really happy

can upload an insta basha yeah yeah the
internet isn't great midnight feast

feast curry this is some chicken thing I
had to go for chicken Finn's the only
one holding strong with the
vegetarianism so even though we've had
the most
knackering day ever we still stayed up

another day of the rickshaw run crazy
