and Lizzy and Australian currently on a
three-month exchange in Italy and you're
watching fun for Louis good morning guys
I'm in Berlin beautifully yesterday I
had a spontaneous decision to slice
Berlin visit my friend Felix Ali and we
hung our little bit watch recording a
bit of her album last night and yeah I
don't know what we're going to get up to
today but first what cool is we go and
get some coffee from one of the best
coffee shop for Berlin water we have now
headed back to Felix's hotel where we
need to see who's done really you
remember really doesn't really like me
sometimes get a bit weirded out maybe
we'll eat yeah three hey hey buddy okay
hello hi
oh yeah what's wrong he's like go go buy
your bike there you go
I'm slowly gaining Rudy's trust
he's kill not completely sure so this is
a really beautiful little Park with one
event it is next to the zoo
yeah nine that's better huh little yeah
it's a little bit chilly but I've got my
gloves on so it's good so guys when we
were in Mexico when we first met Felix
and Sally and Rudy it was pretty hot out
there and as you can see Rudy's not
built for hot weather so I can see he's
way more in his element here yet Rudy
look how happy is yeah buddy yeah he's
built for real for this kind of climate
how do you say beautiful like really is
a good-looking duck invited now it's
just like try to jump in the car head
and find something fun today what is
there to do okay laughs locks it in
Berlin ha ha ha hey I think the wall
went through you okay
and why its iconic when you're leaving
the American sector also this one when
they split their linen for pizza yeah
this is all war this is all it was for
me mr. Berlin will have and will it was
intended to tear it down
now checkpoint charlie was American
property with American plans I guess
Wow Berlin was owned by America
so we've narrowed down a few options
things to do this afternoon
unfortunately the sun's kind of we're
losing daylight so we want to leave for
me inside plus it's freezing there's a
few cool abandoned places people told me
about like place defend when to it's
like a power and a hill like an old army
base and then there's also parent in
abandoned amusement park here but I
think I'll save those for like when I
come back in the dollar and but the
thing we have found is this I think they
come kind of like chocolate shop or
chocolate back three where you can build
your own chocolate I'm hoping there's
some kind of option to make a dark
chocolate vegan chocolate bar or
something yeah I'm just going to do a
dark chocolate oh yeah or you can just
you just choose your own topping
basically these are my flavors I've
chosen you gingerbread chili and then
I've chosen rhubarb quantity yeah and
coconut pieces coconut flakes bit of a
weird combo but I'm hoping it will taste
good yeah and we've gone for the big
size check of it you basically you make
it and they mix it together there put it
in the fridge for half an hour and then
they put it in a little package feeder
cut it the same they don't do a fully
vegan version but they've got dark
chocolate I'm just gonna know dark
chocolate there might be a little bit of
very nervous
on top of that I'm interested to see how
it turns out yeah oh yeah these drop
boxes
I want to see him take it out the mode
you want yeah oh yeah ginger boy has
anyone done this combination before
no no one's done it that's cool
nearly the muck the first time guys
totally unique chocolate bar this is the
real solution of chocolate yeah
when I get again to see how Sully's
going on with her recording hey man okay
sorry how's it going today really good
I'll let you make
Oh
this is a bag of guys it's time to try
the chocolate okay we got and that isn't
a good patient
yeah this fool are you they fighting or
a bi-level
okay see what the gingerbread might have
been a little bit too much in this it's
good but the gingerbread overpowering is
yes like Janovich over here boom by all
again from know like hope you learn a
little bit about the old man
like I said yesterday one of the things
these guys are doing in Berlin is
working on their movie trailers well as
Sully's album and I'm getting to have a
little watch now that's her song yeah
it's German though I don't understand
what this says like slippery three
yeah man oh it's me one
yeah these in different sorts there yeah
every day you can we stay famous Thomas
whispers let me use output rock Vienna

moon studios and adds the two studios if
you're in Berlin and want to record the
music hit them up or link and below in
