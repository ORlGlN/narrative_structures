energy its sharpening knives because
when we were cooking and you chopping
you talking about how blunt the knives

evening for a family tradition which is
to go to the movies to the cinema what
were you watching aunt
look at this place compared to yesterday

coolest 3d glasses as well just in the
cinema without needing my glasses my
prescription glasses but it's 3d moving
so for these glasses on money we've just
come out the cinema I really enjoyed
that movie it's good love Christian Bale

good visual effects classic story
I've got back to the house guys and I am
having another Christmas Skype call and
you saw in yesterday's intro it's Rachel
we were we were together last Christmas
in Australia and for those who did don't
know Rachel and now she's in London but
I decided to stay in South Africa and
not go and hang out Rachel in London so
we've come up with a plan we've come up
with a plan this is a plan when are you
on a holiday until and when you go back
to Australia I stay on holidays till
about the end of January Australia Day
so the end of January so I am gonna be
in New Zealand mid-january until the end
of January but the first week were the
first couple of weeks I haven't
currently made an exact plan of what I'm
doing so that the suggestiveness rachel
which i think is a fantastic suggestion
is that i go out and see her in
australia and we can hang out for like a
week or something in Byron Bay it's
gonna be great we'll see Holly yeah holy
that we missed the last time so you guys
think that's a good idea let us know
below and we can have like a nice
reunion back in Australia is it warm in
Australia this time yeah but I'm hoping
by the time I get back it's gonna be
perfect beach weather perfect okay I'm
excited I'm excited let's make this
happen
let's make this happen I have to make
this effort okay well um Merry Christmas
