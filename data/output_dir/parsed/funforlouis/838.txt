the hostel staying in last night mats
picked me up finally and we're strolling
over to the the hostel him and David are
staying at this room tonight so I'm
gonna I'm gonna be there and the weather
isn't looking fantastic today so we're
gonna cross it so Matt's made a bit of a
plan which involves less walking around
in the rain I think and we're going to
get some breakfast I need a coffee as
well so I've arrived in my new room this
is a little bit more spacious and now
heading up breakfast
so we've sat down for breakfast got two
fried eggs we weren't quite sure what
we'd ordered but that's going to work
for me not so sure about these guys the
plan today go ages we're going to take
the journey car which has a lot of
historical relevance which we can shout
out later but we're just trying to
figure out if we can even get there we
looked at bus timetables and trains and
we've like trekked off way across San
Sebastian to try and find transfer for
those who don't look like options so
we're now walking to a car rental place
see if we can rent a car because I think
it's about hours an hour away maybe an
hour and a half
so we finally found the rental car place
but it looks very close just shut up no
it's not opening it up all day this is
Spain for you
siesta all afternoon right we spotted
another one they said this one's open
now close from 1:00 till 4:00 okay

check out
I know ASAP the football ground here
very hot sauce it up yesterday cool well
guys this stadium that's about as much
as we're going to see in it through this
gate is fence
we're going to go and sit in a
restaurant somewhere I think and warm up
and dry off just jumped in the cab we're
heading back to the old town to get some
lunch starter has arrived some bacon
mushroom pasta this looks pretty good
alright mains is a riot meatballs and
gravy some chips David's got the same

chicken or up for with chips just you
know slapped amid over
still raining yeah I improved it's not
gonna work it's not fine rain there is
yeah so much the worst it's almost the
worst kind of rain guys this is the fast
flat which is the region of Spain where
in I've never seen this flag before it's
pretty cool
hello mr. Swan
check this dog out he wants to meet a
swans too we've dumped in out the rain
again I feel like this is what our day
is going to be just finding refuge from
the rain and we found this place of
heaters I love these heat lamps and
we've come for some desert after our
lunch and they're obviously another
coffee do not always surprises me about
foreign supermarket it's the smells like
me or like a smell from the entrance is
either really strong cheese or just down
there it was like fish really strong
fish I think thing they've really sucked
it out like those aren't appealing
smells if you want to go shopping
somewhere
in the UK they pumped like the bakery
smells of like moon like fresh bread or
doughnuts or whatever and you want to
walk into a shop but fish and cheese
we've popped into shop to find mats of
warmer clothing because it's going to
stay cold and wet the next few days
apparently any luck I'm gonna get the
cow hoodie you went for it
we have wanders back to the cathedral
and we can have a little look around
which is the gesture period is over
so everything's opened up again
guys we interesting how interesting is
that the main statue of Jesus at the
front is there portrayed as a shepherd
whereas usually you'd see and being
crucified is the kind of the main thing
pretty cool
we have found somewhere for dinner
after resting of the hotel for a little
bit
check out the pinch off again what they
tend to do is lay out all the food on
the counters here they'll pile over them
this is such a unique way of having any
food it's like just standing around a
bar just getting like small dishes but
it's like try out these cool ribs
guys we have just met these local girls
were your names only and they've come
and found us I've been tweeting us I've
seen occasional sweetly like well that's
rusted and I'm like oh yeah random and
then they found us just walking walking
down this street it's nice to meet you
Louise coffee's arrived and it's the
darkest copy of ever see the guys
usually if you have to shine light
through liquids nope this is like tar
I'm imagining this is very sprinkle
it's like curdling good it's good number
ah well it's been a good day it's been
very rainy and reasonably uneventful but
it's been nice just hanging out with mer
and David and just taking a slightly
slower pace that these few days which
has been very nice for me I just
catching up with sleep and not rushing
around jumping up planes and stuff as
amazing as those things are I will catch
you guys tomorrow morning I think we're
going to do better hiked up this hill
nearby and wear this it's like cool
statue and look at an incredible view
hopefully it's not too rainy see then
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure boom
