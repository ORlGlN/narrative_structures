then we
so ignite man me and Allen are going to
the movie premiere of banner versus it
man unfortunately sleep forgotten Horus
be the best rated helpers
just disappoint Allen melt he said he's
upstairs so guys here are our tickets
but the RSVP says we have to dress smart
say this isn't smart maybe not
but luckily we have the number one UK
fashion fashion blogger
that's the kind of guy Steve is he's
helping us out he's getting us we're
thinking either hiring suits or just
getting some nice outfits the best
flavors is lunch
why we live we live like the boys in the
shadow of my strange haircut
the Lego
you could do that what beige - so
Steve's taking this in - hmm
trying to figure this out
you know you think and hope it on before
you go set up in your suit sighs the
first Jack I picked up don't worry about
no mean it's like you trying to validate
yourself
wait what let me see this doctor say
just wait buddy
guys this Alan look a little bit like
Ellen without the pageboy awaiting Alan
is still trying to track down an
all-black sure with the look he's going
for his Bentley completely black and
with white converse they can't find an
all black shirt good into a French
Connection see we can find one weirdly
Zara didn't have one and then I just
need to get some shoes Steve said I need
to get some white high-top Nike dunks so
I'll have another pair of trainers
right we've got the shoes we've got the
shoes and we're all good
this needs to get to a hotel now to me
now under staying in town tonight we're
gonna drop off our bags get changed and
then roll to the red carpet
so we found our room turns out there's
no ironing board or wire in our room and
we've got to get our shirts looking nice
they told me the ironing board in the
vending machine
I do not know how to do this it's kind
of embarrassing I think the reality is
I've never had a job in my life where
I've needed to buy a chest and even with
other school I didn't bother ironing
what do you guys think it's looking a
right
polkadot not perfectly ironed but like
this is white little pocket thing yes
Alan it doesn't it will keep you landed
in a suit
basically me and Alan do not dress like
this ever this is like one of the only
scenarios and maybe our friend's wedding
I excited about this guys this is my
first movie
quite good one as well all the actors
are going to be there for the actors
again I mean literally the only one I
know is the one that's not that Damon
the one that like what's that Ben
Affleck that's the one we're gonna be
sharing the red carpet with very
important people I don't know how we
know I don't know how we I don't know
where they're supposed to walk this way
let's ask these guys how do we get in we
have we have tickets
we going first bit being selling the
baby won't be placated we probably
should have
we're being ushered in we'd be rushing
in
we're trying to find our seat you go
there
oh that's it what's the time again is it
Henry Cavill good evil that's the guy
I know everything there is there
Superman
mr. Ben we should
Allen do you know who that is
apparently space Wonder Woman maybe it's
like a surprise thing that happens in
the surprise yeah I thought it was good
I thought it's Bree Olson right help
ease off catching a few days right turns
out they do veggie bean burgers in
Venice those guys are just about to
fight into my veggie burger turns out
it's not veggie burger is it it's a
full-on cheese burger a thief
cheeseburger I'm just gonna return it
the only thing I can think of doing at
this summer nights is gone 11 is Ronnie
Scott's again made it to Ronnie Scott's
that made some drinks with Alan it's
been a fun night
it's the first yeah yeah you're often
drunk in my vlogs
do you know
I was a great evening guys
we were wandering back to our hotel
anyway we've just walked down a weird
dark back alley we want to get the other
side of that building in the chance
night Daniel Bedingfield just got on
stage to start singing and to start with
we were like mocking him because he was
wearing pajama bottoms boo boo no later
than fluorescent yellow socks and we
were like who is this guy and they're
not like he looks like an old Daniel
Bedingfield
but but I need to ask you guys who
actually knows who Daniel Bedingfield is
because we just realized younger people
might not and if you don't you need to
get tonight
you see research he's done he's made
some tunes
absolutely so anyway that was there that
made my evening really I mean the
Superman a Batman I think nothing
compared to seemed a new Bedingfield
shook his hand I was actually more
excited about meeting him then I was Ben
Affleck pianist well otherwise it's the
end of the night it was it was kind of
bizarre but fantastic and now me and
Alan are pretty much sharing a bed is
that okay with you yes they said this is
a like a double like a twin room with
two beds and there is technically but
this like very technique made alan
haven't actually caught up in ages
probably like a year and a half
something like that anyway so we're
actually managing to catch up which is
one of the good things about me being
back in the UK like I keep saying
tomorrow am I've got a few meetings in
London and I don't know what I'm doing
in the evening yet but it should be fun
I catch in the morning
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
