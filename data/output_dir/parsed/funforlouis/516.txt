good morning guys I have just driven up
to North London to go climbing the jack
and the place you've come to you is a
place called forecastle which I didn't
realize it's named that because it's in
a castle where you can see look check
this out it's a full-on concert so I
haven't been climbing in a while I'm a
little bit nervous that I've lost a lot
of strength but let's see how it goes I
do enjoy it here we go
guys first thing I need to do is buy
some shoes because I don't have climbing
shoes Jack's here yeah he's gonna give
me some I'm sorry he's triggering some
advice city some right what shoes
should I get why that makes hikes in the
car like a month so many different pairs
I like the idea of like easy to go in
easy to put on my shoes you know I'm
getting a little chalk bag or more
things laughing what should I go for
guys
yeah first things first we're going to
do some traversing just going to show me
how to work my technique a little bit
suck the boulder stick to the green ones
work way to hold on alright for the
bright green ones yet
I feel nice and warmed up now this is
bouldering by the way this is what we're
doing today bouldering not traditional
rope climbing so it's no rope but
there's a softer map we can land on
I think I'm just getting too excited too
quickly I'm having to take a little rest
already
I still strengthen my arms or my hands
are just yes Jack you got yeah yes buddy
they're brushing the grips with the
toothbrush some reason
yeah nice and then no you want okay
nice and then nice and that okay nice
people nice oh so you didn't have to
swing out there you could've cause you
had the height you could have just put
your leg straight here guys let this
place has a dog
hello duck what's your name your name's
pip yeah hey there pit like a days
come on what days look impossible
your behalf come on yeah yeah
jackets are showing me as well as a
climbing center this place has a little
garden at the back and a little because
they grow their own produce which they
serve in a vegetarian cafe out there
yeah I mean I'm so I think that's where
we're gonna get lunch I'm shaking I
could snores okay hey oh this is what
would I do man and it gets a landing and
grow some kale
we'll wrap up in the biggest bar
we'll take you back to the very
beginning slow you've got to describe it
very so you've got you outside John guys
this grip here that we've been jumping
up to this double orange one this is the
most satisfying what I've done and I
think I'm kind of cheating so got that
extra height but the satisfaction just
brought tree and grab and hold of it
I definitely think Jack's got it I think
he just needs to work a bit more you're
high interesting yeah it's I am cheating
but I wonder if you can jump and grab
that red one
so I think I'm done guys we're gonna go
and get some lunch now but Jack's just
told me the tradition is whether these
guys before they finish there has to be
three sets of chin-ups on this bar so I
guess we must do that with
we've done with lunch with a nice little
Thai curry try to get a takeaway coffee
they don't have takeout cups so I'm
going to transfer this into my mug in my
car and then and then I can leave his
Japs head enough now bye guys
yeah it was then I'm kind of cheesy but
you know pleasure to see you man
differently income money em mmm yeah Jax
get me into it I need oil I've been
looking for something sporty your
activity for a while so it's gonna be a
meditation skip it yeah oh good
we'll take you back to the very
beginning so guys remember when we were
in Kenya last week with in the one well
his whole passion is photography and a
lot of you followed him on Instagram
following his adventures around the
world but I noticed he doesn't have any
long lenses like long focal length
lenses which can be a problem especially
for trying to get awesome shots from a
bit of distance so I mentioned to him I
actually have a lens I'm not using and I
barely use as he bought it which is this
70 to 200 Sony lens so his girlfriend is
about to head out and join him on his
travels so I'm swinging past row hunters
and drop off his lens so hopefully this
will make its way out to him and it will
be able to label his create photography
talents her blossom even more and get
some of those epic shots he's not gonna
be able to get without every the very
beginning so I've just got back but I'm
now heading to the train station to pick
up my friend Sylvia she's helping me
neaten up my dreads has been absolutely
month and they got very fluffy so she's
kindly coming over she's just got back
from being away so she's going to stay
over tonight and then help maybe a bit
tonight a bit tomorrow morning
thank you so much yeah good all right
11:00 p.m. really tie for dinner we've
just ordered takeout Indian feed sylveon
Stein Darcy's hair bleaching the ribs
then and then when they're finished
she's gonna start on my dress great
check that feast out check it out guys
we've had a bit of a disaster so the
idea was most of the dreads we were
going to try and get um neatened up
tonight but I dropped Sylvia's only
crochet attic and it snaps
yes that's of it well not quite sure
that broke I think that's what breaks I
remember it falling on the floor anyway
so it's broken it's completely useless
it's it's now 1:30 in the morning we
have one other crochet hook but it that
we found in the sewing box but it's too
big so there's a few that Sylvia can eat
it up at the back but it's not um it's
not working great and it's not going to
work for these ones so we're gonna have
to head off first thing in the morning
and find a sewing shop that sells a
replacement one and then we'll have to
finish off in the morning but yeah
there's nothing more we can do
I tried tweeting out hoping there might
be someone that's still awake lives down
the road that might be able to lend us
one but then it's crocheting at night
yeah TIFF excited thing that was a
little bit a little bit hopeful right um
yeah we'll try a bit more tonight and
then I guess we'll catch you guys in the
morning
see you then peace out enjoy life and
live the adventure
