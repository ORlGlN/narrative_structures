hey guys I am filming a very exciting
video today i am doing a collaboration
with ancestry DNA they are sponsoring
this video and for those of you that
haven't heard them they are a service
which take a DNA sample and then they
use kind of advanced science i don't
really know how it works but they
predict your genetic ethnicity and they
tell you where you're from essentially
so I'm really excited it takes a few
weeks it takes like six to eight weeks
for the process to happen so
conveniently six to eight weeks ago me
and my dad sat down and you can see us
doing the test you have to spit in a
little vial but anyway yeah this is what
happened oh there's quite an intensive
instructing my instructions there's a
big tube that's the black line it's
you're gonna have to sit every 10
minutes like generating spit oh here we
go
do not eat drink smoke or chew gum for
30 minutes or we did just have a cup of
tea what about a chocolate I'll just
take another look guns in it oh oh oh
good so here's the black line that's the
level we have to spit up to there's a
lot of spin that's quite a lot hell over
it it's this thing boy I think we're
going to put that in it and on it we're
all a sterilizing lick fluid so it
doesn't go off oh wow okay all right
so we spin it first and then we add the
stabilizing fluid Lois I'm nearly there
because it's not the talking get on with
it yeah all of it in one deposited Oh
what how do you do that also now or
something look how far over the line
that I managed you know this with how
did I spell or something so simple
respecting the vials we've shaken them
up a vial on mate and there's an
important code on you yeah and now we're
going to go on punching the code they
can track that this is my spit nobody
else's and then we're going to put them
in these boxes send them off and then
you'll find out we'll all find out where
are where we're from where do you think
you are from there I mean what's your
guess okay so I'm guessing
I'm guessing a good shot guy Scottish UK
so I don't know whether there's a
breakdown alright a Scottish line yet
England UK Scotland I think that then I
think a bit a tiny bit Irish maybe there
is are I think I'm about and eight Irish
so my dad has done a lot of researching
into our family history he's probably
he's probably got a bit more of an idea
of where our ancestors came from but I
heard a bit of Sweden maybe we in my
have swedish we've yet to connect with
Sweden but I think the Swedish a bit of
German or Russian Russian I think that's
on your mum's side okay so you're going
to have you know the good make so let
put these in the bags now and then you
have to write your name you have to get
the code on the yeah and then we'll
we'll find out we'll find out shortly
okay done alright you can send these off
now so it's pretty easy we just sent off
that little bottle with a saliva sample
ancestry DNA ran it through their
systems analyzed it they actually have
over four million other DNA samples
millions of family trees and billions of
historical records and yet they have
this advanced kind of DNA science that
they used to send me back hopefully a
pretty accurate prediction of where I'm
from and I've seen a few other videos
but people do this it's pretty exciting
to be able to do it now with you guys as
well I'm hoping to do it my dad as well
he's not with me here but when I get
back to the UK and I'm sitting down in
my dad I would do this with him as well
I had asked him not to check his his
like results yet so we're going to do
that together in a vlog like in the
future okay here we go
oh I can do my DNA matches as well what
maybe I can find relatives I never knew
ahead oh my gosh this is amazing
okay so 58% Europe West
thirty percent Irish and four percent
British what four percent Scandinavian
Sweden Norway and Denmark
that's the Viking and
great-great-great-grandmother from
Swindon four percent Iberian Peninsula
no way that's like now Spain Spain and
Portugal
what and there is the tiniest bit
zero percent Finland Northwest Russia
but there must be like maybe that just
means less than one percent it's saying
only four percent Great Britain so
there's these regions here if you can
see on the image here that covers Great
Britain but also found in Ireland France
Germany Denmark Belgium Netherlands
Switzerland Austria Italy but then it
seems to put most my DNA kind of genetic
heritage to Europe West which I think
there is this overlap okay let's little
bit further down so we've got 30 percent
island okay there you go
that's why thirds you San Island also
includes Wales and Scotland so as you
can see this is like big rings around
the kind of regions that it is a text
and I guess the more that people that
log on and submit their DNA the more
accurate they'll be able to get a
because the database is going to be a
lot bigger so I guess my DNA links with
a lot of these orange dots here this is
where my mum Tyler the family's from I'm
actually a McGregor while not on a
Gregor but my mom's side of the family
is McGregor as much as my clan this is
the ring I'm confused about the 4% from
Spain and Portugal
I guess this doesn't make sense it's
overlapping Western Europe England all
of this and then this I knew about knew
I had this connection in Norway and
Sweden so this is a complete puzzle I
honestly came into this been a bit
coffee thinking yeah I've got a pretty
good breakdown I know where from my
parents give me a lot of information
about my kind of relatives but this is
mind blowing like there's just whole
regions and it just didn't know us from
like folks from Spain and stuff that's
mad let's go back to my mum and dad and
say we're your family history is a
Spanish for Portugal connections so cool
I cannot wait to sit down my dad and
look at his because it's I want to know
whether the the Spanish cultural
connections and my dad's side or my
mum's side I guess we'll be able to find
out there you go guys my ancestry DNA
results that was actually really
fascinating to find out about my genetic
heritage and I would highly recommend
you go and do it yourself and see where
you're from even if you're confident
like me that you know you probably don't
know so yeah check out ancestry.com
forward slash Louie Cole and that'll get
your 10% discount I think it's $99 to do
and yeah like you saw it's pretty easy
to spit in that little bottle send it
off six to eight weeks later you'll be
able to check your results too and if
you want to post videos and share your
results like I have include like hash
tag my ancestry and tweet years up I'll
try and check out some of your guys and
you post them and yeah hopefully the
more of us that do this the more
accurately we can see where we're from
and also maybe find distant relatives we
didn't
we have so you can click my link in the
description or on the end screen here
and yeah hopefully we'll be making
another video similar to this in a few
weeks time with my dad and who knows
maybe we'll find some other fascinating
things about our genetic history alright
catch go see peace out enjoy life and
live the adventure the
