I just wanted guys I want to show you
where we stayed last night this is
pretty incredible we are in the middle
of the redwood forest in Northern
California and we are in like a
sustainable living house which is like
totally off the grid
it's got like a compost toilet over here
it's like a three-story wooden building
right in the middle of the woods no
electricity well minimal electricity and
yeah the water is coming from like some
big water tanks at the top of the hill
there's a garden out here come check
this out I guess they're growing all
sorts of veg check this out I want to
hear the best and the worst thing about
staying here hahaha I think they're
gonna be different because my worst
things no internet on it yeah there you
go having to throw sawdust on your head
yeah I'd say no electricity yeah kind of
but the best thing and the friends and
all the friends yes friends and and the
nature the nature as well this is pretty
awesome Elstree and the dogs oh yeah we
listened okay where did the dogs go Sam
brought his friends
hey we're now loading up the van we're
filming a little video for Alex Martha's
Channel
and what was it happening oh yo we put
everyone's luggage in here because it's
a very steep hill down to the other vamp
which couldn't even get up here the
wonder bug did it
goodbye amazing wooden house this is
gonna be fun
good luck bruv heads is so chill bro
this is where he's going to lose it well
we made it down to the bottom very
easily and now we're transferring bags
it's matter than that you boys ready so
let's do this do this so when we came in
here you wouldn't it seems it's night
time but we cross this tiny tiny little
bridge with just bet live like
centimeters either side barely fits no
there's nothing that this vent
we have just crossed the state line into
Oregon we've thankfully found a gas
station so we're filling up apparently
you not have to fill your own gas in
Oregon how great is that
did you know that oh yeah look at this
Willy's family guys yes stay look no
self service it's crazy so there was no
coffee cup cup tops and so I just use a
soda can and now I realized why no one's
ever done that before for you you are a
mess I was like oh this the best
invention ever coffee soda and then I
realized why no I invented it let's suck
we're having a little break some food
snaps get a job so breathe free smells
so I'm just checking the oil it's one of
the things that Andy said when we bought
this bus is essential to check regularly
as is with any vehicle but the oil helps
with the engine cooling in this case and
I think all donut gazans oil compared to
other cards so I'm just checking the
dipstick here
guys who just pulled over there's a
little bit of smoke and oil leakage
I think it's cuz I way overfilled it
with oil I'm gonna sell my truck I don't
think it's a big problem
these guys have too much oil than too
little oil
so we're five minutes away from a
water-filled Omicron agency fortunately
we've lost most alike
the Sun is technically still in the sky
but with this kind of mine balance now
either way it's gonna be pretty
beautiful here we are guys
Multnomah Falls looks like the others
arrived quite a bit before us they have
a much faster vehicle although she did
well the Wonder bug I got up to like 80
miles an hour which probably isn't great
for her health but it got us here
I'm sick
oh hey we made it so pretty
however give this yeah
okay rise spike the puppy
oh you're flattered
so you gotta head today where she must
be terrified
Ali's joining us for drive into where we
go important okay we're gonna go we're
gonna go and get some dinner because I
think it's about dinnertime
look at these letters my bad these boys
bus a cigar ZZZ and they kinda wanna be
Ozzie and the two of these fuzzy
sandwich so I for dinner
bang bang is this the right place
so my brother and I have recently
returned from Mexico we'll take into the
habit of drinking mescal similar to Kela
when it comes with a little scorpion in
the bottom so here we are
yeah doesn't it absorb all the light
alcohol so it's like super - really
chewy nothing magic
yes we mask oh wow amazing we have some
curried french fries here that's looks
pretty awesome ok ok that was careless
this looks so again is a sad night
tonight because again we're losing some
of the crew Marco Alex and Kerry are
flying back to somewhere where they
flying back to San Diego that's right

to send the a go and the rest of us are
