good afternoon guys me and Raya are
about to leave her grandma's house and
we're heading back to Sofia to catch a
flight to Berlin because tomorrow I've
got a job in Berlin for the day and then
we're heading back Bulgaria but we
better get a move on because as usual
we're running a little bit late look at
all the fruit yes - fish - neck neck
neck foot okay
there is tonight messy ciao we like to
write with my Bulgarian i'm dis
repeating that's a little bit ok figs
grapes peaches yeah alright alright you
ready for our two-hour drive
guys on the way to the airport
I've asked rioted look up some fun facts
about Bulgaria because we've been here a
couple of days and I've already noticed
a bunch of interesting things and if
they aren't in those hun facts like no
wonder Philip clintus like the shitty oh
yeah okay oh wow bulgaria is the only
country in Europe that hasn't changed
its name since it was first established
cool really all right Wow but what is it
in Bulgarian same oak area because a lot
of countries don't have the same yeah
like China and Bulgarians is goodbye
let's could I just good day good day
yeah it's like totally different
the oldest gold treasure in the world is
found in Bulgaria the oldest go to
treasure
yeah well older than like a scapegoat
so get this guy's in Bulgaria they shake
their head to say yes they nod their
head to say no that is so confusing so
we were at with her grandma and she was
like saying yes and like talking about
singing in the kitchen and she was like
yes and I was like it's funny because is
that is there any more coffee it's a
pretty coffee there so yes but it's like
yeah we're sayings are those things
where you think you assume that it's
just global and you're like okay we'll
be honest with the language but we can
at least you know do hand gestures and
not our head but it's not the case like
they don't mean the same things
everywhere so it's really funny and some
hand gestures are like really bad in
other countries into them so yeah I
think it's easy to assume that it's what
you're used to is normal everywhere but
it's not like were you saying in Greece
that yes and they were the same well in
Bulgarian and the word for no is nee and
that's the word for yes yeah
that is never wandering bordering
countries in the West yeah yeah their
grace is like two hours work
the Bulgarian folk song
was sent in deep space on board of the
u.s. space probe Voyager 1 as part of a
collection of our civilizations
- cultural artifacts a message to a
leader
and what the alien said
jamming out the Bulgarian army has never
lost a single flag in battle
slash
I mean I think I'd be more concerned
about other things class you can just
replace the flag
John Vincent Vanessa was a physicist an
inventor a Bulgarian descent best known
for inventing the first electronic
digital computer
yeah that's like a big thing that my
grandmother talks about what made the
first Peter I never heard
it's like everyone
Bulgaria invantive in their defense
computer well this guy's of Bulgarian
descent his name's John so he's
obviously novel that wasn't living here
probably in 1976 UNESCO declared the
ancient Bulgarian calendars the most
accurate in the world is it different to
the Gregorian calendar
Patrick was I mean the column that we I
think the calendar we use probably most
similar to that one because you know
everyone have different ones like the
Mayan calendar that ended years ago I
never cut doors in the die instead whoa

hour and a half so all good
