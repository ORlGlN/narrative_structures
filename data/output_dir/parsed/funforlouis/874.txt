we've come for two hours

I see I'm coming in fresh so it's
probably likely we're different I'm an
impression hard my brain is just
malfunctioning yeah I know it yeah

we found
we've been tuned for a couple of lights
is the best place possible incredible
music great food
it's just worked out fantastically
there's nothing more rewarding Kiba
we're now deciding whether to go out
dancing or whether just having more
children tonight because we're all
feeling quite chilled I'm just gonna
figure it out take a little stroll
figure out we weren't sure what today so
we came back to the house and we've just
had an impromptu self the lesson with
each other we kind of figure it all out
how it works because we all got towards
slightly different things that we're
just figuring this out it's a lot of fun
what's the order of play here okay can
you stop stop that free no stop yeah
looks a 9mm and we're gonna do seven
eight and we come back to another stay
night
and then back to the beforehand you
missed the for free we didn't say no
then we're going to be four yeah then we
do that's Emily yeah then we need to say
no everyone needs a little coca-cola
yeah and then maybe we'll throw in a
little sombrero yeah okay nice
smooth them
guys I'm loving the South sir loving it
but it's time for a little drink and
little change of scenery so we've gone
for a little stroll
probably gonna chill in that hotel again
it's the spot is 1:45 in the morning and
it is burger time
let's do this we are back and I am super
tired I got other plans tomorrow it's
still the last full day in Cuba and we
haven't been to the beach yet so I think
that's the plan we're gonna find a beach
depending on the weather it got a little
bit chilly today obviously not as cold
as other places in the world but still
it was a bit chilly so yeah it was good
weather I'm going to find a beach and
then we might be filming a video for
Dave in the afternoon
something dance-related we're gonna try
and find some music and him and I are
gonna film a bit ourselves so hopefully
that's the plan I will catch you in the
morning guys
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
