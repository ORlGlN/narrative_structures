bit of a rainy day here in LA so I still
got some fun planned jumping the Wonder
bug and I'm about to head over to
Sammy's cameras buy a new lens it's a
low aperture wide angle lens with an
adapter to my Sony camera so hopefully
we'll be able to shoot some pretty
cinematic amazing clips my blog
I'm also green Jesse with me I'm just
waiting for her now and she's getting
ready going to come down yeah me someday
yeah
I just love this we're going to a thanks
right
hi guys I picked up Jesse y'all-y'all
we've got the live stream on the ground
because it is good lunch I ran out why
not good real life yeah here we're here
yo y'all here well here we're in the
wonder bug right now yeah Cree's it
we're in the sick ass car
Louise wonder bug that is a VW tennis
down six mountain
I didn't listen but we're headed to the
camera store to buy some camera here so
we can make YouTube video
yeah yeah all right here we are
Tommy's cameras you can try slend up all
right this is a sigma lens 20 ml 1.4 and
I need to use adapter on the toilet we
my age didn't unlock from filming them
for tonight
well hey Jesse the autofocus is pretty
good
oh yeah but look at this depth of field
right and how wide it is
whoa that's nice in that Oh
that's fast autofocus like deduct if I'm
plugging my that was that Wow
yeah likewise yeah it doesn't double you
got shallow shallow depth behind me bit
like I'm going on - yeah yo what do you
think guys I think I'll commence guesses
oh yeah they've only got one instructor
Jesse Jesse's not going on today guys
what do you think this is only a 7s so I
was testing you before the age of an r/t
this is in the 80s I want to test out
faster autofocus take a bit longer
whoa it always not coping with how low
the aperture is is it focusing all right
my face like how fast is how close come
on again probably not a place
okay I just noticed a problem is with
the author's focused on just like Ana
rattling kind of motor noise it's trying
to focus so intently so we're just going
to clear that was an error like this of
fault with the adapter or whether it's
just the way it's going to be which
means a mic after use it to be royal
rather than blogging we'll have a look
subscribe I found a problem when it's
recording and he turn it appropriately
Edison yeah I heard it
mmm and then I wonder if one switch
focus then you switch the manual and it
makes you hold it the same day same
Roger the other hobbies of you is you
know okay so this is with the continuous
focus yeah
motor noise switch to manual
I spent if I can keep my on the exact
right length away do I move it like yeah
I'll be out of focus just looking at
getting a mic I just really want a tiny
mite for my camera I can just like
attach on the side that has put the - in
most M mics attached on the top of there
but I'm thinking that I can just strap
on the side I'd get a red monitor yeah
just leave looking at new screen thanks
what did you get dizzy ring like I don't
even remember I really like I got you I
got a seek large wire a light with one
point and work well he had a nice time
what is that what is that G Series
that's one in four to seven that's SP
point eight I got a ninety difficult one
point eight yeah we'll give it one e21
I've never seen anything like these a
nightly like friends breaking down I
love it it relaxes me
bodily drive any I just was like
I want to get a clap for this
yeah good characters in life know all
about performing alive is okay I'm back
at Jessie's Raya and Rochelle filming a
video we're going to try and use this
lens we've got a top mount is Mike and I
want to see the audio gets rid of the
click enos from the autofocus I could
also turn it on manual so you wouldn't
get it can you hear this
I've left resettle and Roya
tell me Jessie's going to chill here as
well and I'm borrowing his electric bike
to go back to the hotel and get right a
laptop because you forgot that Sun has
come out it's a lovely day now
whoa
so you
I love this weather where the Sun comes
out then the skies still like proper
stormy set out
alright guys I got her laptop
and I managed to get my helmet you may
have noticed I wasn't riding with a
helmet leather here so I have a safer
ride back right I'm back Jesse he's
convinced me to go to a yoga with him so
let me sum shoot and we're going to head
down and I'm probably going to die
probably gonna die alright let's see how
I love it
guys I'm back from yoga that was that's
pretty incredible with it better than I
thought it was it was exhausting
I was fell asleep at the end we like to
lay down and we're just like peeking out
and they're like we're doing not um that
can i yeah I'm definitely going
again I signed up with three more
sessions and I could do that regularly
stiffly we are now heading out to dinner
Ilana - hey
all right we just picked up Molokai how
you doing bright
chillin man freshly back in town to
Korea yeah how was that it was a wild
experience facing crazy food and had a
good time is good so we can donate on
everything here man
yeah okay
they see my favorite restaurant knowing
is the element here where Tyler
my guy give a selfie because we had such
a cool night it was yeah great food
great company something I'd like to do a
lot more here in LA is just having meals
together with friends when we have our
own place I mean I'm not going to be
doing much cooking but I feel like the
idea of having meals at home together
with people maybe maybe getting takeout
food of it oh we're going to cook we're
going to kick algae show cooking okay
anyway my point is it's just it's just
lovely and I think that's something
special about eating together of friends
anyway we've got a couple more days in
LA and then we are heading off on a trip
which I'll tell you about tomorrow
probably but it's fun Sam Evans is
coming over and yeah there's just lots
of things happening in the next couple
of weeks which I'm very very excited
about but we're just going to be taking
it easy and just kind of recuperating a
little bit because it's been a pretty
mad couple of weeks a lot of meetings so
it hasn't been like mad adventures but
it's being relatively exhausting and I
might take tomorrow off I should need to
chill but it's being yeah it's been cool
today getting a new lens this is I don't
know how it has been guys I haven't
watched the twitch back but let me know
if you like it some of you don't either
super shallow depth some of you like
seeing everything of focus but I kind of
like this lens especially for kind of
b-roll stuff so ready for the adventures
this lens is going to be the one thanks
for Rob's tricky kind of suggested it
although I don't know how it performs
with the Sony cameras but we'll
obviously when I'm editing right I'll
catch you guys in the morning
peace out enjoy life in this adventure
but
