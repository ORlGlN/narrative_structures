good morning guy just arrived at the
airport
my dad had finally dropped me off and
today I am heading to Somalia it's going
to be a very interesting trip quite
last-minute that a lot of you know
Jerome and some of his friends launched
a campaign a movement to ya address them
in a big world issue starting with this
pretty devastating famine and drought
happening in East Africa right now so
I'm heading out there to stop spent from
a some of the distribution of food and
supplies and water to some of these kind
of remote villages and kata Somalia and
yet see the beauty of the Somali people
and share stories and I don't know well
but I don't know many of the team of
going with the only guy I know is
Chicago I met the other day and yes it's
going to be a big adventure
so it landed in Istanbul we're now
getting school entry to our necks gate
where we flying to Nairobi in about an
hour if any of you have been following
this love army campaign that that
started like two months ago you'd know
that right back at the beginning to Rome
and his friend Shakur and others
research and found that Turkish Airlines
of the only airline that fly to Somalia
so they approached Turkish Airlines
actually I think it was that online they
tweeted them load people tweeted them
and they they stepped up and got
involved and that's who's flying us out
to Somalia at the moment so we're just
waiting in Istanbul in the first
Airlines lounge and I've just been told
this is the biggest business class
lounge in the world and it is actually
not like we just came in from up jets
check this out because two floors I've
never seen this before
upstairs Downstairs I just want to show
you some of the stuff they have in there
it's got a little computer workstation
area
quarum straight up library and snooker
table free popcorn and Athlon cinema
with lazy boys we've got this seating
area upstairs
if told suiting area unnecessarily large
TV literally there's free drinks and
snacks absolutely everywhere all right
let's head back downstairs this is where
you really start to realize the size of
this place
you've got a massive seating area here
full-on interactive like virtual reality
golf game or even is with a massive
scale electric step some of you guys
remember
a lot of you guys might be a little bit
too young for scale electric but I had
electric and I just loved it haven't
gone on the scale electric pepper
absolutely year so well as a scale it
grip
we've got a couple of Playstations down
here a full-size grams of PNA we've got
another little computer workstation here
one dining area
another little lounge area a second
dining area straight up chef cooking
food and we have a little cheeky plate
and then the different little quinoa
lentil salad kind of vibes going on over
here and then this is the central
courtyard just end it didn't this like
the most nuts lounge everything I have
one of those free lounge parties that
get me different business lounges around
the world - everything - one like that
this is like mind-blowing I just want to
like hang out here all day I blow like
is flight simulator 24 hours you can
have denill and I'll be like
okay guys it's about time I introduced
shut up
right so they my view is no Jerome you
to Rome another day started hoping
coming on so Jonas briefly explains what
the whole thing is we do in every saw
that there was a barrage Somalia and we
googled International Airlines of
bloomer the only is not an airline that
flew those ammonia and so we especially
get a plane
and then on the process of learning
about varying work realized that what a
stupid idea is they had an arrangement
invite we locally in doing that time
that I am going to smaller and we are
today I think Center program one two
million years of work and there's more
Omega network
continue doing it but kind of me and
Jerome and then we call other people in
jail are Ben Stiller safety being Ramona
or Whomper and probably a lot of you
guys already know about it and probably
already donated TV and been going on me
this dream is not to be out in this
prick so it's going to be me shutters
you know the unruly olive oil market
tomorrow and essays and days ago you me
them later on but the arm super excited
okay three in the morning
as a pre-conference like I've edited
three logs today I banged out two edits
and that's life
I'm feeling very productive okay we're
trying to find our driver now so it took
a little while coming out the airport
because they were a little bit confused
why we're going to Somalia and I think I
think the fact is like not many people
go to Somalia and there's not many
reasons why I think they assume it's
like dodgy dealings like we've got
terrorist links or something but the
reality is which is going out there to
see the amazing stuff and meet some
amazing people
welcome what was your name again
David and you work for the ALC do you
work for the ALC yeah yeah yeah and was
that fun for again led the American
American Refugee Committee okay ALC
deliver most of the food and the war and
the humanitarian relief in Somalia in
terms of prices and really amazing
organization now about 400 stuff and
they're all Somali working in Somalia
for Somali until it was a really good a
lot of the documentation of Somalia is
kind of
destruction terrorism and famine does
not actually so much shown about the
actual people and just day-to-day life
everybody in the country is this is
obviously not involved in in the action
in fact it's very small amount of the
percentage of the countries involved in
whom you would call terrorist action but
the whole country gets branded like that
because the only view coming out of the
country is that pilot in that yeah and
hopefully over the next few days we'll
get to show bit more accuracy of flight
yeah and life people day-to-day life in
Somalia are you new here guys this is
the beginning of a very interesting trip
Shack of the booth of the way like we've
just been having amazing conversations
just learning a lot by each other
because literally we met like two days
ago but we have a lot of mutual friends
and I feel like we're on a very similar
wavelength about how we view the world
and how we want to be a part a solution
to see things change you know I but for
me as well I just want to reiterate
coming out here getting the opportunity
to I guess document some of the stuff
having in Somalia I think the key thing
and shock I was saying earlier is it's
not like we're coming in as Westerners
just with Aid and it's like here's the
solution to your problem have some aid I
think we need to think long term I think
obviously short term yes people need
food their starvation people are dying
of you know you know there's no water
there's a drought so there needs to be
some just supplies for people but I
think it's about supporting people and
trying to find solutions to long term I
don't know repair in the country so over
the next few days I'm relearning a lot
more and watch a little documentary on
the plane about Somalia but I'm going to
be learning as much as I can about the
the culture the political situation and
yeah just how we
me personally alone that how us as a
global community can support countries
that struggling like that and yeah it's
exciting and I hope that you guys are
excited too yeah be a part of it and and
find ways that we can rally together to
make a difference in places like that
but ya see the CEO happens it's going to
be a little bit dangerous probably the
most dangerous country are being in
please now enjoy life and live the
adventure doing
