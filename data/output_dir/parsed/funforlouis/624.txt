trying to figure out whether this is too
wide where this is pretty cool t
basically under stop going on about
lenses soon once i get myself i'm going

of exciting to try new things the more
range of lenses I've got the better kind
of virtual stuff i can tell you them
where when we're traveling the world
together like this is 24 to seven eight
it's not i think it is it before we face
this is important guys to protect your
lens get a UV filter and then you just
screw that in the front and then it
doesn't get scratched or anything and
you can just replace these crazy
specially if you movie yeah in this is
compulsory otherwise you will scratch
