hi this is Brian Barbara Iook now we're
on top of Pat bells in the Lake District
and you're watching fun salute boom good
morning guys we're just woken up in our
beautiful Airbnb in burger mode and this
is a view out her window whose is unreal
this is like the most picturesque place
I stayed if the lead oh my gosh Italy
and before we head off to the next
destination we are going to go and
explore the roof because I had a little
peek and it looks like we might not get
up there because it no not that way
though okay that's a good sign but we're
kind of like in the Attic for building
we're going to try to throw up some keys
left in the door right it is the
elevator shaft room machinery
oh man it's really close
ah all right Stephen girl I think we
found spa I feel like we one of the
tallest buildings in a say oh my gosh
what an amazing view yo man this is
incredible outlet right specific to that
is the church Bella kept me up all night
again those repair wasn't all night but
it was in the morning early
that's like checkout time actually
because we got to be out of the building
wait it's like spring yes bro this is
kind of scary actually
in place elite it's not a direct drop
down I think that's not balcony down
there yeah yes guys
well the bells sounds ringing what
amazing timing bro how big is this just
this is awesome I liked how Italy look
dreamy it is kind of like been in the
movie right it's good then we started to
feels amazing start to the day
yeah right look at the snow-capped
mountains it's like we're surrounded by
mountains yeah let me just look an epic
photo of us it's going to go on my
Instagram you know I mean to get follow
it exploring with Josh yeah
never vlogging walk on the roof at the
same time we're heading back down the
girls have been weighing a little while
hopefully they're not too angry but we
just couldn't resist this is just the
slogan in their voice whoa bro you know
stuff haha
how'd you look at the angle how are you
look at the angle yes way I know way
that was a success
how is this for sure success definitely
a good way to start boiling see Mikkel
gonna be mad I think that man
I live in so it feels we've been on
street level now where I stop for lunch
I have a vegan burger which looks more
like a whopper because think of it sides
of it I don't know how I'm going to eat
order can't even hold it so I did a
search with speciality coffee in Bergamo
found this place a jar
basically me everyday how's the coffee
Laura resilient coffee bean oh yeah Josh
you look like you need a coffee
you
we're leaving Josh there to rest up do
and we're going to go in there blow the
town see this people going lick the
sides of this tiny little band I don't
even get the scale here so this is me
standing next to you so there's a raised
part of this city which is like elevated
above the rest of City and to get up
there we have to understand it kill us
so the point Achatz now it's kind of
perfect on a day because the sun's
getting low in the sky and it's just so
clear it's not single cloud anyway
we've arrived at the top we're going to
go and try to find the most beautiful
view now we have no idea where we're
going
our theory is we just keep heading
uphill we'll get to the better
I did it actually not really the
advantage point oh wait we're also I
guess you can because them is like
Hanuman stuffed his mountain
I got a little bit obsessed with
breaking ice off the wall here and the
kind of frisbee off died no you do it
guys look how cool this is
the wall all the way around the Tri
cannot is leaving the archway
we found the most beautiful square and
this other part of the town so nice to
see the way the Sun glinting through
here guys I think there's a wolf here
this looks so much like a walk
we're taking the light through the town
can I get the best photo
we found the best year
guys who got sick so a location
she's going to shot me sitting on the
edge of the wall this is a very very
high world
Oh
the Somerset we're now going to head
back and find Josh and then hopefully
getting dinner for leaving Bergamo we're
going to stay near curing tonight we got
like over two hour drive and take you
this make blizzards on the way guys look
at the difference in each key dog
so after much deliberation we've decided
to leave here and find someone to get
dinner on the way because it's still
quite early then it is gone sick and if
we eat now we're going to be hungry
later on so I think we stopped from like
an hour hour and a half work well I feel
a Josh did you rest well yeah three
Arden sleep I feel a bit better yeah all
night last night
Melda dreamy place consistently try
different meals come with a chickpea and
potato pancake which is pretty amazing
I'm probably going to order the same
again though because they're quite small
portions Wow we've arrived
oh good job Laura very cool little
lounge area here I like that we're going
to go and check the bedrooms out oh wait
what's this basically a hot tub yeah I'm
gonna sleep here is that okay with
everyone this is cool I love this
stairwell whoa this is really cool so
this amazing place is our home for the
next few days we are near Turin in Italy
in fact I think you're looking out the
window here that massive lights down
there that is to Rend and we are
hopefully going to go explore get are
some fun things around here before the
trip to this amazing kind of eco
spiritual sustainable community which
I'll tell you more about a few days when
we get there because I don't really know
much about it myself but in the meantime
