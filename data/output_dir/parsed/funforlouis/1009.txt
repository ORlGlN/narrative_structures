hey guys I thought I'd do a quick video
about the first time I've done things in
life and the importance that's had for
me the first thing I'm going to talk
about is venturing out there and passing
your driving test so the first time I
actually got on the road with a car on
my own was one of the most pivotal
points in realizing the freedom I had to
travel and explore the world and I just
remember sitting in my car I was almost
18 and I remember driving along with
this just excitement of like wow I can
literally travel anywhere right now
which leads into my next first which is
to do with travel as well I was 21 and
it's my first road trip so I bought a
minibus I think a few days before we
left it's my 21st birthday and I just
grabbed a few friends I think there's
eight of us and we drove for three days
around Europe we did like South France
Italy up through Switzerland Germany
into Holland and it was incredible again
this sense of freedom this sense of
adventure and travel excitement that
again opened up the next phase of
traveling for me which was realizing
that you don't need to do package
holidays you don't need to do these like
really planned out rigid itineraries but
you can kind of explore and kind of make
it up as you go along and doing it all
with your friends as well I mean it's
great traveling with family but there's
something exciting about traveling with
friends this leads onto YouTube the
first video I put on YouTube was my old
channel eating stuff food for Louie the
first video that really went viral was
meeting a scorpion and although I'm not
really wanting to go down that route
anymore I definitely acknowledge it as a
stepping stone I remember the day I
first got featured on the thing on The
Huffington Post and I was getting phone
calls from TV companies and they were
like we want to do a TV show with you
and you can travel the world eating
things and I was like all excited I was
like I think the first time it dawned on
me that this could be a whole new kind
of direction in my life of making videos
and having this global audience which
again like I said this is led to this
channel now and what I'm doing
now but like I said this is kind of just
to inspire you guys to look at your
lives and remember the first times
you're doing things and look forward to
the first time you get to do things and
there's actually a website first comp
and Vodafone are running a thing where
you can come up with exciting activities
that you want to do for your first time
and they're going to draw I think ten
people from all these ideas and entries
you can do and they all fund and make
possible a first-time activity for one
of you so visit that below and yeah just
keep me up to date guys with any fun
stuff that you get to do in your lives
and adventures you do like I said before
I want this channel to be an inspiration
to you guys to get out there not always
sit and watch YouTube but get out there
and live the adventure
