Havisham and I'm from well Jalisco
Mexico and just want to say hi and you
watch him fall for Louie
it often English I'm in a bit of a
delayed start smog doctor Diana chill
morning just hang with my friend Andi
some of you may know me and him and Dave
for both together on eBay last year and
today we've decided he on a bit of an
adventure he's just born new motor for
it and we are heading into central
London so let me show you around this is
inside is where we'll be sleeping
tonight we're hoping to do a bit of a
campout somewhere the other where we can
end up this is a motor rigged up to the
steering wheel which we didn't have last
time we give no name yet I don't know
yeah we haven't done we still undecided
on a name but and it's all the safety
gear we've got these buoyancy aids we've
got a little air horn down here here in
case we need to signal for help
and this is just pretty incredible
bouncy power station yes wow they're
doing some serious development I don't
see this
I'm taking the wheel
easy and ease just tracking our route
see how many miles we go how many miles
we got so far
Oh guys oh my gosh Andy things are ready
to cross the channel in this I'm not so
sure let's speed up a little bit no I
think you ski going hello it's only
gonna get crazier click this book yes
big fan and the London Eye
and Louie and ambit guys we're
surrounded by these fancy folks we have
no idea what we do it
do I hope that we don't like traps in
the book of Acts and I need to said what
would happen if we denied
they can feel desire trouble the tape
modern supposedly draw we are passing it
through London an alarming rate
hello hey this is ridiculous this is so
rude
we're doing it Tower Bridge basically
this bridge when massive ships come
through it lifts up in the middle there
I've never actually seen a permit you
ever seen the middle of Tower Bridge
we may have some repairs and wait powder
here something
are you feeling living first rough way
it's for all time no restriction tuning
it on the River Thames
McCallum a half an hour yeah
guys there's the o2 arena we're all
missing Greenwich and in andra just
googling it is the marine that we can
pull over in and get coffee and some
food
so I think we need to call them to laugh
it
guys it's the 10th area I've never seen
the thames barrier in real life as the
fact we found a little dot this is the
greenwich yacht club we're gonna see if
we can park our without getting in
trouble
mooring only by prior approval of
Greenwich Yacht Club okay well I tried
to ring them they didn't answer so the
guy came down and said we could dock so
I've got the ripe and I'm trying to pull
the boat in without crashing into any
other base look at this evening guys
this is just beautiful cheers Andy
cheers cheers Cheers
we were just accepted into this Yacht
Club as as family because we have a boat
the Yacht Club have kindly lent us one
of their fobs so less ourselves back in
once we've gone for dinner because I
think it's gonna be closed by the time
we get back so we're walking down so
look at the local pubs get some food and
yeah so kind very friendly people a
table is like yeah didn't the time now
this place is toilet just got some
plastic fish and chips and he got a
burger lovely evening
it's um mushy peas as well for eternity
so we finished our dinner taking a
little stroll down to the o2 arena but
also this thing which I've only just
really found out about today the airline
it's this big kind of like gondola thing
over the Thames so we're gonna go in and
CV we get a ticket and go across here's
my oyster cart
right into the into the cable car heads
are bowed it's just Chilean rose you've
done by these red lights she's chilling
the end of that are you see at least the
doors are really secure
is quite reasonably priced pings my
oyster cart marinate 3 pound for each to
get across
I'd suggest this is a romantic evening
activity for any of you guys excited in
London lovely
so we basically got straight back on the
gondola from the other side because this
time a night there's not a lot to do
over there you just popped in to get
some snacks and now we're going to
scroll over to the o2 arena see if
there's any movie showing
broken back into the Yacht Club so we
went in for a showing of Mad Max Road to
fury it's pretty good
you know we've strolled back down the
river to our Yacht Club and I'm gonna go
and see our boats all right it's very
kind of the Yacht Club to let us talk
about here and I think the plan is we're
going to see what it's like to sleep in
we got our sleeping bags earlier and a
little roll mat each I think it's not
too cold tonight sleeper there I guess
it will yeah maybe so guys we um who
snuggled up yeah I think it's just
pretty good I think this is like the
perfect size for two people to sleep
there
Andy's over there I'm chillin here we
can see London through there hopefully
when I get told off in the morning to be
in it pretty sure it's chilled I think
this is the first night I ever slept on
a boat this size and hopefully it's the
first of many we're gonna be planning
some adventures the next trip we're
gonna do is willing to go all the we
were thinking of doing today but we left
you late he's going all the way out to
the sea which is another like 30 miles
another maybe like four hours and the
Bight and then another trip we could do
is go down drive this down to like stop
Hampton or Portsmouth and then where do
you cost to do Isle of Wight Portsmouth
yeah
Portsmouth and then we'll go across the
island boy and then the big one you see
is the English Channel to France
I don't know we go much further at about
this size but I think we'd be we were
just admiring the the other boats and
yachts in there see whether we should
upgrade at some point but all in good
time all in good time we're gonna get
some sleep
we're gonna get up early and then we're
gonna make our way back to Putney
I'm hopefully where any problems right
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
