good morning guys I slept I slept for 12
hours last night I needed that is a
beautiful day the wind has died down
yeah there's been a few people doing
some talks this morning I decided to
take the morning off just a rest and
didn't get to catch some of the talks
but apparently they were like super
powerful yeah
really jumped in deep from the beginning
of this weekend which is cool everybody
in this room wants to give up on
normality and travel the world is that
correct
definitely
so I bought a cycle pen with the
intention of signing a contract and
whether you believe in God or the
universe or whatever if you do something
with intention
if the craziest things can happen so a
few weeks later after I bought the
special pen I was sending my first
contract so yeah if there's something
that you can do to convince yourself
like you know to prepare yourself in a
way in a responsible way to prepare
yourself for that dream to come true you
need to do that JEP took off early this
morning and flew to Las Vegas to get the
seats fitted back in the plane like our
massive fuel tank taken out so I think
he's gonna be landing in like 40 minutes
in the meantime gonna get some food hey
there max feeling pretty good having a
good day yeah what did I miss this
morning
yeah you're a pretty past that yeah you
were getting a bit of rest in and
there's a workout there was a talking
fan live Thank You Sun came out the
winds gone away so yeah
someone has kicked off so nicely just so
good that and that guys is this kit he's
gonna do a little talk and his life and
if you don't know hip had a big impact
in my life he's made a couple of amazing
documentaries one of which was
cowspiracy
and what their health more recently and
that was a big dramatic change in my
kind of life direction deciding to go
vegan so and we're going to talk a bit
this afternoon about it and I think he's
making a new thing which I think
probably secret but I might be involved
that's like a projects coming out next
next year you think after okay so stay
tuned for that yeah I'm pumped it's
gonna be a really cool day can i order
some food okay got the food got some
sweet potato fries tofu stir-fry I'm
gonna go find a little spot chill B this
is like the vibes this is so good am I
gonna sit in the Sun yeah just finished
eating and JP's on his way back he's
about to come either into land or he
said possibly if he's feeling confident
doing a flyby in the plane I think he's
only a couple of miles out so we're
gonna gather and get some cool shots so
you gonna fly quite low yeah yeah I
think that's the plan
yes I'm so weird hearing them from the
ground
this is such a cool feeling like waiting
on the grass if it feels like I imagined
how it did yesterday
you
hey damn bro it's so cool yeah this is
really really cool Arya's doing getting
a few shots of the summit this weekend
I'm probably gonna be throwing a few in
the vlogs yes bro
is it nice flying ended to fly vice
where new leader flybys I know Jeff is
enjoying himself I can just imagine in
there like yeah that was sick guys we
had these ships from Hawaii and then we
just need to reconfigure the back
everybody that wants to fly writes it on
a name on a thing and then we put it in
a half yeah yeah and so all these things
have been happening over the past I mean
long time you know the Bronze Age Iron
Age they go from you know many hundreds
of years hundreds of years and then you
have closer and closer and then it goes
into social movements and then just in
the past couple hundred years you see
happening slowly and then happening fast
you know with slavery that you have
civil rights and then you have women's
rights and then more recently gay rights
and transgender rights and you have
these things ascending essentially our
evolution of who we are as humanity's of
humans and where we are at the core
humans were loving
come kind compassionate beings so anyway
with that being said we're just entering
a really special time where where you
can't lack of better word this movement
of equality extending now over to
animals and but this difference with
this one is this move of this stage that
we're at it's gonna be look back in
history of what again what side you're
on at the end of the day and a hundred
years from now two hundred years from
now they're gonna look back at this time
where this happening really fast there's
only gonna be one way history goes out
you are the social influencers you are
what is creating history today you know
you're one us you know you're one post
you're one blog can reach millions of
people around the world those millions
of people can reach millions of people
so the butterfly effect is so powerful
and is really powerful like when Louis
saw cowspiracy and its dude just we're
always track specially I was right when
the film came out we would know the next
day when something happened because you
just see the spike we get all these
emails and remember we woke up like wow
a big round of applause a lot you've
been asking about the the Kickstarter
campaign we did to pre-sell the
documentary we're making there were
three guys that ended up opting for one
of the biggest rewards which was to join
us on the world flight now because of
problems with paperwork and logistics
and complications it meant that
especially coming into the Middle East
and Asia it's really difficult to try
and include other people as passengers
on the plane anyway the three guys that
did the Kickstarter did that option
we've actually flown out to the summit
and JP's about to take up on a short
flight in the plane so there's three
guys in the back who the with the seats
that have just been fitted and then the
plan is after the summit we're gonna
take those three guys on an adventure
and I think we're gonna be heading down
to the Dominican Republic we're going to
be staying in some tree houses and stuff
just to make it worth their while there
they I guess backed back to the project
invested a bit of money so here we want
to make it worthwhile so it's going to
be a fun week of adventures but it's
starting off from this weekend and I'm
glad we got the plane sorted to take
people up on a golden hour flight today
so hopefully they have a fun one
I've just got the bags that we gave
Lindsey to bring back from Hawaii and I
just got back to the bus and Sophie this
is Ryan's Doug Sophie is chillin on the
bus and she's normally not incredibly
friendly but I think we've become
friends like Sophie I love you
hey so let me introduce you to a brand
new dance I know you're gonna love it if
you give her one chance let me introduce
you to the early morning uber disco
you can sit down now
so guys yes this is all about the live
the adventure summit this weekend but
realistically we would not be here if it
wasn't for an idea spark
two and a half years ago in New Zealand
and where JP calls his home where I
think it was after about two minutes of
Louie and JP meeting for the very first
time that the idea is far to this crazy
concept of flowing around the world in a
one prop light aircraft and we are right
here because that dream that reality has
actually happened
I met Louie when I was 21 which for me
was one of the most significant things
of my life to to meet Louie yeah it was
really saying to me and yeah we just
started dreaming and making it happen
Greenland was spectacular and and
meeting the people there and actually
getting to stay with locals and and
seeing such a unique world that so
people people get to see was awesome and
then Pakistan I just had a absolute
blast at Pakistan it was so so good
people were amazing and just not what we
expected at all even thinking back to
like the day we flew out of here like
almost three months ago at that moment
of taking off and just I remember being
like I like broke imagine the feeling
when we land back here like it was kind
of that projection of like and we were
just grinning and you know flying off
and as you know the Sun was rising it's
just so beautiful and I think one of my
favorite things was when we were like
cloud surfing just skimming there the
clouds and when you see clouds like
rushing past and I like cruising in and
out and you feel like you could always
touch them they're just like big fluffy
marshmallows it's right there if I had
done this a trip alone it would have
been flying getting to a hotel sleeping
for two days and then maybe going out
not really meeting anybody except for so
what we're really helped was his his
outgoingness and his ability to to meet
people and and for us to genuinely have
fun
despite all the stress and thus the
seriousness around it so I think that
was Louie's biggest contribution to this
trip and it made it significantly more
enjoyable to me I really felt like part
of the family part of a connection to
people all over especially Pakistan
Egypt again was like another vibe where
I just felt like wow how like this is
amazing global family we have and that's
why I think this this is so important to
me this weekend as well it's not
centered totally around like me but
Aloha the vlogs you know even the world
flight this is much more about a
community of us being here together and
and you know it was just a great this is
a great thing to be able to organize on
top of the landing but yeah I think the
community aspects and realizing this
global community yeah it was it's never
felt stronger to me after the worlds
like this yeah awesome and there are
there are a lot of moments during this
trip there we cut out because we want to
make the movie something unique we don't
want to just you know cut a bunch of
vlogs together and show you guys that
there is a lot to come yeah I've got
probably 30 hours of interviews as well
which are gonna be in the documentary
for you guys which is they're cold I
can't wait to show those they're really
cool on behalf of everyone thank you for
putting this together and for landing
safely guys that was pretty awesome
being able to share a bit few of the
stories which we haven't shown in the
vlogs yet and just getting to sit with
JP and yeah share what the adventure
meant to us really and we really would
love to do a lot more of kind of sharing
and doing doing talks places over the
coming year so if any of you are
interested in hearing our story and want
to book us I'm sure we'll be doing a lot
of that so I'm sure link emails below
though yeah we'd love to travel and and
share about the adventure and filming
the documentary and details of flying
yeah I don't enjoy I enjoy doing public
speaking it's cool
anyway we're gonna we've wrapped up warm
it's another chilly evening we're gonna
sit around the fire and carry on
chatting and sharing stories and
hopefully
it's dinner
you
I've been travelling now for the last
four years of my life non-stop not not
exactly as an influencer a little bit of
that micro influencer in the last couple
of months and what I've been I've been
working events all over the world
I love obviously what Louie and JP are
doing too so they can really kind of get
to know what what the world's issues are
and this documentary is is I have a
feeling gotta be pretty groundbreaking
and something that that I personally and
I know a lot of people here are very
much looking forward to and I think
being surrounded by the people you're
surrounded with here talk to these
people as much as possible because the
experiences that they've had in those
countries and how that's changed my
molded them into the person they are
here today and I think we can learn a
lot from that I think society in general
can learn an awful lot from nasty girls
what's your panel like 12 13 years I've
been who's asking 12 13 years that I've
traveled I feel like like Peru India
Ghana parts of like Southeast Asia the
majority of travelers I met have been
solo female travelers between like 18 to
25 like that is the majority industry
sources guys females are the majority
60% that is our female travelers the
travel in our age group so I think a lot
of people believe that to fulfill their
life it comes from there's constant
excitement excitement excitement and
doing the next thing but what I've found
at the end of the day is it's really not
excitement it's peace so you can go
place the place to place the place
trying to fill whatever gap you know
you're feeling at that time but it's not
gonna come until you sit with yourself
and find peace inside that was a really
cool special time for the girl sharing
in they're sharing a bit of all their
own travels and
people got vulnerable his as cool it's
really cool that's what this week is all
about I think it's connecting being
vulnerable with one another encouraging
one another we're gonna we're gonna do
some night photography now I've got like
some experts with us we're gonna try and
push the plane I just had to wake JP up
if it said he was having a little nap
and we're gonna push the plane into
position all right we've got a whole box
of leaned cubes here got some diffusers
some colored gels you know these light
painting light out the light out the
plane a bit it'll be awesome
I've got a whole crew ready there
tripods look at all these cameras the
night's gonna be here for a couple hours
so you have time to do it you have time
to screw up the best way to learn is to
trial and error so yes and then have fun
with lights no you don't use anything
you have a headlamp could be extremely
fun to just kind of walk through the
frame yeah and it's good that we've got
a clear sky and no moon yes we should
get some good stars stars should be
bright tonight
some of you guys will remember Lily from
a couple years ago and we used to hang
out a bit more than we do now she's
actually the person who introduced me
and Raya Raya used to live with her in
New York anyway she's come all the way
out to California to this event to
perform for two new songs that I think
she's just released today so we're
gathering around
your love was handmade for somebody like
me
got your heart Oh baby look your
daughters and I see time I see pies
well it's the end of day 2 that lived
the adventure summit what a special day
one incredible day
and again as I was hoping we had just an
epic party it's like almost 2 a.m. I
think I don't know and they're still
playing music things are dying down a
little bit
I just feel overwhelmed how amazing this
weekend is everything I've hoped for
we've still got another day tomorrow a
few more cool talks people sharing
things it's so cool that Kip shared
today that he managed to make it down
here it was totally unexpected I've only
seen him once before this and yeah I
feel like a beautiful friendships
flourishing I'm sure a lot of you guys
who have seen what the health of
cowspiracy
and been impacted by those films can see
why I'm just so excited to be hanging
out with him and and planning some
things and yeah hopefully yeah hopefully
we'll get to hang out quite a bit next
year and do some things together so yeah
that'd be cool and yeah lots of other
cool kind of connections and friendships
for me over this weekend for everyone
and yeah I'm just excited to see what
happens what what this weekend catalyzes
you know like cool adventures and other
people doing things and but you know
supporting each other's dreams and all
that kind of stuff that's what I really
hoped for and that's that's what that's
what's happening and then yeah what's
the next step I don't know where's
where's the next event we're gonna do
comment below let me know where you
think we should do the next LTA summit
and you know we'll start making some
plans maybe run a few of these events a
year I think right catch in the morning
peace out
enjoy life adventure
