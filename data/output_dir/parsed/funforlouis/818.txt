g'day my name's Shane I'm currently in
then tired to go working at the Wilkins
ice runway it's about 4:30 in the
morning
honest ten degrees the sun's just coming
up and you're watching the movie please
good morning guys today we are off to
Val Val but before we go we got some
breakfast and I'm quite excited we found
some we're serving eggs and bacon got
our coffee with these guys in this is
going against pot yeah how you doing
this morning it's ready for a two-hour
journey this is are transported a big
coach so we're just gonna load our
luggage in here
good we were just about to get on the
coach and we'd put our bags in the
storage and then found out that they
didn't have any tickets left
so we had to quick quickly grab our bags
in a rush when they were closing the
door so we quickly grabbed our bags and
then we've had to wait to the next one
David grabs his what he thought with his
bag he thought this is his bag and then
five minutes later as we were chatting
he looked down and he was like oh crap
this is not my bag so now he has someone
else's random bag and and he hasn't got
his which is guy's passport in it right
so we have to figure out a plan now I
think we're going to go find the ticket
office and tell him the situation so
what's the latest the latest is we're
going to collect my bag at the ticket
office
and we're going to deposit this so
should all be relatively has this person
being informed of the situation or not
they don't know bigger they have a
surprise it's dark out
let's try this again well we are here
with the rise in Bilbao they get these
bags switched back over now any of the
person that's got David fagot left here
the taxi dropped the other guys at their
hostel and there wasn't any room there
when I went to Burt say and he just
booked me in to another hotel nearby
I've just arrived here and it's pretty
nice everything you need is usual little
desk it's cool it's kind of a low bed it
was like a kind of japanese-style thing
a little table with air coffee chillin
and guys they might well I had a little
knockdown nap and now we're heading out
for lunch
I think things gonna rain today it was
just a good thing
famous Spanish dishes is quieter and we
move all that sorry this is me viola I
think usually there's seafood in it and
we are in a seafood restaurant but none
of us a particular fantasy looks like
chicken Toyota right the next dish is
arrived salmon got big chunky salmon
with left lunch and we are coming to the
Guggenheim Museum it's one of these in
New York as well and I think there's
gonna be some kind of modern art and
sculptures and stuff in there the
building looks crazy I'm not sure this
is guys but it seems to be part of the
bridge kicks out this like mist
there's one of these spider statues in
Tokyo as well
the first exhibit we've walked into is
this this massive like cylinder you can
walk inside and where it's just like a
big spiral and we're just walking around
around oh we've got into the middle
I think yeah I think I think this is it
it's a big spoiled cylinder cool
this is a miniature replica of the room
we just walked through and we were like
walking inside these big sculptures to
give you some perspective I'm gonna say
something controversial guys some of you
may have an issue of this like dislike
modern art museums I don't get them I
find them
lacking in talent often just boring
they're not let me film anything so I
just call me bother to try new slide
filming of this is the work but I don't
really see the sea is very impressive
anyway we've left the Guggenheim and we
saw one last exhibition which actually
redeemed it slightly it was a bit more
interesting was this like French
feminist sculptor in the 60s he made
some pretty cool stuff I enjoyed that
bit more than some of the less complex
stuff and like I liked the actual shape
of the building the architecture is
pretty fascinating but look look how mad
that look it's very original
but they could just probably do this
thing more productive with the spaceman
side I think
we're just having a little laugh reading
some of the reviews on TripAdvisor about
the Guggenheim elegant trashcans save
you money would be better empty stunning
building but not impressed with the
weird collection pretentious rubbish
this is similar to my views I guess look
quite quite strong but don't bother
going inside we've finished our little
coffee break and now we're gonna try
find a jazz club and get some dinner
there's no live jazz that's made me sad
we're trying to find somewhere but there
seems to be no live jazz for some reason
so we're just going for little wonder
I'm still very hungry so I'm hoping we
can they're stopping somewhere get some
food
there's some people competing on the
walls over here look at that
No
to think it's like the protester guys
what does this say
is it like a protest against
yeah I think what is this
she really didn't want me filming that
did you see guys look how look how fresh
this graffiti is they literally just did
it ran off we've had a conversation with
some girls the other night about battle
culture and it's a very kind of
patriotic crowd can a nation that often
don't want to be identified as Spanish
even though they're within the country
of Spain but I'd love to know a little
bit more about it if any of you are vast
will know about the whole kind of nation
of the battle people yeah comment below
because I'm not sure what the widely
foods are protesting or anything really
these guys have just dropped me at the
hotel I'll see in the morning yeah so we
ended up just staying at the restaurant
chain like ours is really nice despite
wanting to find a jazz place I think we
gave up on that idea that doesn't seem
to be any jazz in Spain how but yeah
such a nice evening very chill day to
day it's been but it's good bonding with
those guys yeah I've got to do it live
editing now and I remembered to buy some
snacks tonight so not gonna have to do a
late-night kebab run I brought some nuts
and chocolate and stuff that's my hotel
I have had a frustrating few hours guys
that I've been editing I've gone to
upload my vlog that was supposed to go
up tonight and Vodafone in Spain is
stupid okay they restrict you to one
gigabyte a day why I'm willing to pay
for more I'm you can have my money
one gigabyte a day is not enough I use
that in like an hour
literally just like FaceTime with
someone so please if you're watching
Vodafone Spain don't restrict date usage
if people are willing to pay it doesn't
make any sense anyway rant over bingo my
vlog up we have to find Internet in the
morning the Internet in the photo is not
fast enough either
these are the these are problems I have
to be fair not very big problems
compared to the rest of the world so I'm
gonna stop complaining now and get some
sleep and see you guys in the morning
peace-out enjoy life and live the
adventure
