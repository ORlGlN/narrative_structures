hi we're at the LTA summit and you're
watching good morning guys it is day two
the live adventure summit and I'm a
little bit late for our first session
which is with some Falcons and and owls
we're doing some falconry that's what
we're doing and I think we're getting
some close up time of the birds first
and then in a little bit they're going
to fly them outside so I've got my
coffee and petting it what's this
Yuri Laura that's the big out how you
feeling this morning feeling full of
energy I'm feeling more awake and I was
yesterday I had a lot of sleep that's
good coffee
I think that I would had a lot of coffee
as well that is if your mug your spares
okay it could be tired the glove so with
this one if he goes you go with him
anyway this is imagine you out solar
flying a fire whoa
that wingspan it is so now he's coming
from outside he's already quite warmed
up cause he's panting because they have
no sweat glands the only way to cool
down Victor Pan yeah it's Michael he's
not my bigger than a chiral owl LS yeah
ell look saying that I could be an ally
my first night now I need big experience
feeling I think yeah that owl is your
spirit animal a pathway this owl can
hunt foxes we're going line
yes whoo that was difficult this is
incredible it's absolutely incredible
I don't think I've seen now this
look at those talons
by my nose
quietly
it is such a good we have just managed
to grab some lunch and coffee and we are
now heading to a workshop that's Sonia
running a couple of the Sony team have
come down and they're going to be
talking about cameras and stuff we might
have some giveaways for people and then
I think we're going to be going out on a
little photo walk and they're going to
have a few cameras to lend people the
more fun part my job is dealing with
people like sales people with a real
passion for photography who used
products on a daily basis to who sort of
do things with the cameras that you know
we get really jealous of I have my
favorite lens in the world ever
but Optical Image Stabilizer millimeter
f-18 you can tell I love it because it
looks really really used right Sonia
brought a bunch of kitten loads of
lenses to lend out for our photo walk so
people are getting to try them out 24/7
guys look who's arrived
wait what I'm joking he arrived the day
late but his coming from Gatwick he
landed where we going from bump Aston
so I took it over straight here like 70
pounds that's all worth it because I
still made it and we're about to go on
our photo walk now so can I go home it's
gonna be fun
are you feeling tired no actually I'm
gonna sleep okay so I'm sensitive to
caffeine so I literally on purpose like
a black cup of coffee chugging I'm here
Wow buzz in there I feel weird but it's
okay you're gonna crash tonight hot tub
and then beds tonight later right
although I don't have a bean soup I will
find you one for ya yeah right headin
off

more
you
you
right we are back from a pretty fun walk
tiring but I feel like energized and
we're just given the cameras back I
think people got some cool shots if
everything went to plan I would have
included a few of the photos we took on
the trip on the wall in video so let me
know what you think so guys we're
sitting down now just having some chill
time and getting an opportunity to chat
and give advice and just and then I
watch each other's videos and stuff like
she's been watching a Matthews there you
go
videos he did a little kind of 2016
wrap-up video which I actually need to
leave my channel safe beating you to the
punch no weight load of people were
creating this weekend they have their
own channels okay I'll try my best over
the next few days to like shower few
people will probably link a bunch of
people at the end of the weekend as well
so my dad has arrived isn't it that has
come down to check out the summit and
Thomas has shown us the new Mavic which
I haven't given you a close-up look at
yeah it's really well me I'm super
impressed it's really well made it's
like really lightweight as well yeah we

lightweight and then wait up and in this

how have you found some I'm at civil
word part of a bigger bigger community
like we're all Harless big wide world
and we come from all different
backgrounds worse than almost can't
describe how amazing this place is
guys I'm going to leave them to it the
fire but I am on a high because tonight
has been incredible just the vibes I
don't know if I've ever been somewhere
with so many just ecstatically happy
people I think there's something about
like just I don't know when everyone's
in such a happy mood it's kind of
contagious and we were just having just
ridiculous amounts of fun so I don't
know I just yeah this is a this has been
a rare evening and I've got to say just
one of the best evenings I've had in a
very long time yeah what an amazing
group of people I think this is more
than I could have wished for for the
summit that people can come together and
just make real friendships a couple of
girls are telling me like they've
already started planning trips with some
of the others here which is exactly what
we wanted to happen and I don't know
it's just the whole like vibe of wanting
this community to kind of bond together
it's just worked perfectly like just
having this space over the last few days
and we've still got like a day and a
half left at the summit yeah oh I'm just
so happy it's so good right Alfie and
his friends have left we have left the
hot tub also um and we should probably
go to bed because we have got an early
start tomorrow it's the last full day of
the summit as you can hear there's
actually birds tweeting outside well
that's not a good sign it's the last
full day and then we've got a bit of
Monday morning but it's been absolutely
awesome today and like I said before I
just I can't go over it's a very very
cool starts to what could be a lot of
events that we might start you know
putting on for you guys anyway I'll
catch in the morning
peace out enjoy life and let the
adventure
