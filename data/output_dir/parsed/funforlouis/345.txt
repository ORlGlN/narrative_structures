good afternoon guys today is very
exciting because we are about to go on a
safari drive in Sri Lanka in this part I
can't pronounce it begins with you it's
a long name anyway I think we're gonna
see elephants and I don't know we're
gonna say cool animals basically very
different from an African safari which
is the only other Safari Avenal
and I've also got my drone I'm hoping we
can get away with using this in the park
without getting told off
so we paid our Park see and I guess this
is the entrance now
while our
check this out guys how young is it you
think how many years old 10 years this
is amazing guys they're very different
from African elephants they I guess
their heads are the shapes that is their
kind of lower down or smaller or
something so they're recognizably
different
like how he's playing in the dust the
other elephants doing as well like
licking the floor I don't know what
they're looking for
right we'll just fight some more
elephants over there and headin over the
little herd of them maybe like maybe
like seven elephants
something with notice guys is that these
elephants are eating stuff off the floor
they're like kicking it around and then
eating I guess it's grass
whereas where we've seen elephants in
Africa they seem to be more like
grabbing leaves off trees and stuff so I
guess their diets different and and also
these elephants are quite a bit smaller
than African elephants and I'm gonna
find out but I'm not sure whether these
are like a specific breed of Sri Lanka
or whether the exact same I love the
exact same elephants is like Indian
elephants
what are you digging for buddy hahaha
it's thank you are we go ahead Roy how
does this compare to an African safari
it's so different the terrain
there's a crocodile over there next that
bad that bird might get much careful
go ahead
hey buddy yeah that's amazing little
elephant by the ride
so Atlas the National Park and on our
way back to the hotel we've stopped off
at this Conservation Center where they
do like elephant feedings throughout the
day and they are just about to do you
one with the right just in time what's
up worthy go away sort out your attitude
don't screw me maybe you can come back
and get some food later get your milk
oh thanks for now this is so cool guys
the only thing I've been too similar to
this is the David Sheldrick foundation
in Nairobi where they were like doing
the feeding when we adopted it in da Tay
remember and from what we can tell I
think this is a similar place where they
I guess raise orphan elephants and then
re-release it
look there's a dog right there so if the
puppy starts playing with the baby
elephants in all my dreams thank you bye
so guys we've stopped in a town with
good internet and we have set up a
proper little laptop Club station in the
car side of the road tethering off my
phone there and briers just that's a
really important business cool and it's
hilarious because it's it's like a
beauty brand basically and they're
probably in some fancy office in New
York right now and I'm literally like in
a little village it's really got his
dogs barking I'm gonna tell them like if
a cow walks past the window just ignore
that that's so we're on the road we
actually stayed finishing all my stuff
and uploading videos until midnight and
now we've got two hour ride and very
windy roads all right guys we're almost
there we've been going on a very windy
crazy road that this next section of the
road looks in sane look at this this is
our room for the next two nights
hey you can't really see outside at the
moment but we are suspended over a
valley in the rainforest and we're going
to be checking that out tomorrow morning
and it's like balcony out there which
you can't see and we read a line and
that monkeys run up and down on the tops
of these little houses so I'm hoping we
hear them in the morning and then
hopefully in the afternoon we'll get to
go through it or hike into the jungle
and see loads of cool animals we saw a
few on the drive which I think Garrett
wants to get my camera out in time but
tomorrow we will be going out to see all
the wildlife and I'm super excited to be
here and catch in the morning
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
