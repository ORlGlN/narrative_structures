burning guys is half past four we are
leaving Nagpur in India today and we are
flying to Sri Lanka hopefully if the
weather is good enough there's been a
lot of debate throughout the night
whether the weather is good enough and
there's some storms for militant places
me and JP didn't sleep at all
JC may have got an hour's sleep I don't
know but yeah spirits are high and we're
ready to roll right we've got everything
ready we've got the GoPros on got our
bags in don't know no the Sun is
supposed to be rising in like less than
half an hour still pretty dark to me
interesting prop clear
so November 2 and there you can from
clear to the destination Airport Victor
Charlie row in India via the frypan
route fight level 1 1 0 after takeover
only three - left turn
climb on track squawk 1 3 3 1 circuit
hopefully we end up in in Sri Lanka
today yeah I'll be good
I'd be pretty nice
I will drop back a little bit make it
less loud for everybody around us
they literally just open that April
first there's nobody else there they
were got a best bet now yeah for sure
absolutely pretty much just IMC today
which is not good considering we're
heading towards the storm hopefully we
can climb above it
I wonder if it this hazy around and
there's some paper isn't yet and I don't
know it should have like 12 minutes Wow
yeah actually it's rising at five
minutes I really hope we get above this
because if we stay like this all day we
we can't really continue
I can see I can see from up here this is
so beautiful
I'm really glad we're about it right now
makes big difference
you don't see those really high clouds
yeah that's negative okay don't my day
you see the storm yeah you see it does
massive clouds sticking up yeah
definitely is there and you can start
seeing the stuff is starting to grow
like pop out it and they will go up to
40,000 feet in like two hours
Wow
you want some of the good stuff
hey you can see these Jeff up there
they're way above everything like they
have nothing to worry about
what was that like for you at 35 40
actually all the weather stations in
India are down what you mean I was
trying to get some weather for the
airports that we're about to fly over
and they've opened down for a whole day
but now we are going to have to dodge a
storm and the remedy 1jq from negative
we cannot go directly killed might due
to a significant weather in a way we
have to maintain one four zero for at
least five correction 50 miles five zero
mile circuit for like one of the hardest
things about this trip was taking non
Aviators you know pilots onboard yeah
but III I think anybody else would not
have picked it up as much as you have
thanks thank you definitely I find it
very interesting even though I don't
know whether I'm capable of doing it
myself but I feel like I think you you
are just not to this extent maybe I hope
I can get through here before it gets
too bad of that we're gonna try to I
want to go right here I might go down a
little bit this is screwed underneath
though I want to basically go straight
ahead
you had the good
you're gonna miss what just flying yeah
we got a lot more of a ticket I do miss
it they're like after four days on the
ground it kind of gets a little tough I
don't want to jump to conclusions what I
think that's just clear blue skies you
might be right chocolate wafer yes
please income five yeah they taste a
little bit stale real uncut baby yeah no
I didn't think we'd make it here today
this guy no no we do it all Domitia
we're gonna give them a little cigarette
I was gonna give you a cigarette
Sri Lanka
yes right we're we don't the path with
airport and we're gonna produce pretty
cool flying now
yeah baby
yeah oh my gosh it's just so quick a
beautiful it's like a dream yeah it's
actually loud - everything is my
favorite thing you're literally just
touching clouds it's like it's like
you're in heaven
now the Queen Frontierland on me -
peeping - 5 0 P 2 0 a Durant is reserved
this is a reserve yeah it's not a bad
way this is where we like staying there
oh yeah the wind it did say 20 knots
which is crazy this is not story here
all right welcome to sri lanka how we
made it a long day before uniform
continues to intricate army via taxiway
alpha tan alpha 3 okay by alpha and
alpha 3 sir
okay so we have a slight problem we we
haven't got enough fuel we got two
barrels which I think I think they're
200 liters each but we haven't managed
to fill our reserve tank which we're
going to need in the next leg so there's
a high chance we're going to need them
to get another barrel and that needs to
be delivered here from Colombo which is
like a four and a half hour drive and
we're due to be leaving here tomorrow
morning early so hmm
I'm not sure exactly what's gonna happen
and apparently the weather is perfect
tomorrow for our flight to Malaysia so
problem solving right now
this is the color it's going to pick us
up I think maybe we'll fit our bags in
here we can just escape ball behind us
something with all of our luggage and us
through screens like oh yeah we have the
option of getting a really nice van No
thank you thank you thank you okay I
think we've a cars come to pick us up
because they realize this competition
can afford
how far is it we can go all the way
how you feelin JC you happy to be here
yeah I think we're gonna go see some
elephants all right here's a little
bungalow these three folks
IRA just arrives at the canteen little
worm buffet dinner buffet lunch awesome
guys check how legit this treehouse is I
want to stand there so cool we've
managed to get changed
we're jumping back in the tuk-tuk and
we're heading to see elephants now you
come in as well go for a little walk in
Safari
I don't know how confident I feel
because we've just walked out of the
electric fence area and apparently this
is where the elephants are over here and
if you don't know guys
elephants are probably one of the most
dangerous land animals the humans if
they get angry and charge us we're
screwed everything wild elephants before
are you in for a treat
yesterday yeah
Ziggy's 20/20 elements he's gonna say no
no don't worry it's gonna be fun he's
like yeah no charges can it kill us can
the elephant kill us no no course we can
goes again you guys didn't choke this is
a an area of the elephants have kind of
created as if barge to the undergrowth
it's cracking down little trees and
stuff yeah all these branches that just
like broken on the floor elephants this
electric fence he was just saying this
would literally send us flying if we
were to touch it he was like good girl I
bet Wow so yeah I'm assuming that's
death okay probably shouldn't walk walk
that way okay they told us to hurry so
I'm assuming that means there's
elephants
it's Ayodhya secession like
warm evening breeze
I think I think the elephants I think we
found the anything nice there's the
elephant
well it's been a pretty awesome day we
made it to Sri Lanka and despite some of
the weather worries and yeah it looks
like we're heading off first thing in
the morning - I think we're going to try
and make it to Malaysia but potentially
we could stop in Indonesia
if the weather's if the like winds bad
and we can't make it far yeah it's been
a very good day and yeah I get a bit
more sleep than we did last night now
catch you guys in the morning
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
