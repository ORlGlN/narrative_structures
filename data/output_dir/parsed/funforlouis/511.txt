Dave all right made you a cookie bro
thank you well you know toilet you just
put it on the survivor yeah man over
here think it's gonna be angry oh hey
wait I don't know it's really weird it's
a weird feeling
Oh Dave who the cobra's cream egg
actually leave it here in your head
thank you well guys like don't know what
I'm doing up at this time in the morning
but we're siesta where we're gonna go to
a church service
I think everyone's upper part Mandy
right hey how you doin some days you
wakin up now I mean my brain isn't
working yet but I feel happy so that's
good
it's nice school thanks for taking us to
church max are you ready for brunch
that's a silly question moley Oh guys
can you see this rainbow over here
peeking out
so because of the unreliable weather
here in Edinburgh we thought we'd find
something inside to do so even though
the rain is stopped the activity for
this afternoon is butterfly world that's
right we're gonna go see some
butterflies and we're just in time I
think to do the animal handling so we
get to hold some reptiles and spiders
and stuff which would be nice
so I can highly recommend twining
butterfly houses in cities especially
when it's bad weather
some little taste of the tropics
they're baby chickens
it's going on
my girls I've never seen a hedgehog
running on a hamster wheel
you had like butter I'll get the
rest under here
perfect sit
she's off on a mission in she's
moving I love all insects and creepy
crawlies and bumps and whatever you want
to call them I love them all there's
nothing that freaks me out really I
think my woods jobs have a tarantula
like snuck up on me
and I look down but I love spiders guys
they get a bad rap they really do
that will leave cutting ants boys anyone
seen easily crying out sighs I found a
no chicken a little baby chicken
the koi found
I found him on the floor he was just
walking along and I was like hey man
want to be my friend that's your prison
that's your Easter present little baby
chick when we build our tree houses guys
and we have a big patch of woodland
if we could get a big enough Catalan
to do the greenhouse as well and have
basically a jungle in our God
lovie amazing in there and you can grow
a tropical fruit and have all the pet
butterflies
I think that's I think that's a new
addition for my plan
a big greenhouse it wouldn't need to be
quite as big as it got I definitely want
butterflies I love that
and he was just saying this place
reminds him of my bedroom when we were
growing up and those be the don't know
when I was about 13 or 14 I decided to
transform my bedroom into the tropical
rainforest painted tree mirrors all over
the walls had like running water in
there had a pet iguana that just used to
roam free
loads of plants it was quite incredible
II actually won a prize on the BBC
Homefront show and yeah basically lived
in the jungle for like four years or
something
he's to play recordings of like birds
and this is thrown out and imagine I was
in the jungle so that was my that's my
teenage years if you haven't seen that
video guys I'm gonna leave a link here
you can check it out and it was like I
look hilarious I haven't quite hit
puberty in the video say and yeah if you
haven't seen it check it out I will
definitely be recreating that in my life
at some point when I have a house
jungle bedroom the way forward ready
