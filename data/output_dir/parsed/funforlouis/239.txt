Australia but I'm currently in Los
Angeles and you're watching fun for
people to guys before I head out my
adventures today I'm going to make a
smoothie with our blender that we
ordered I've never done this before
called a nutribullet where I was trying
to teach me how to use it but we'll see
think it's pretty simple but you to
chuck everything in here pivot lid on
turn it upside down and then push it in
and let's blend it all up so these are
the ingredients I've got bananas mangoes
chia seeds now I'm going to use the
middle like vegan protein powder which
I've had recommended to me oh yeah the
other thing guys I've got some frozen
blueberries and some frozen strawberries
which I'm going to throw in there as
well so I'm gonna blend there and get
this mushing down a bit and then I can
just go into another stuff this is how
we're going to water it down a bit of
almond milk
give us your face oh yeah oh maybe right
I'm leaving the house split a rainy day

counter hey there Brian Cody and spear
have been cruising the booty boards but
Cody had a little accident so cool so

like your taillight I'm going around the
corner in the whole board you split up
from them okay okay we're heading down
to the marina now we're just going to

for a guy we met the other day Cameron
who's like living in his bus around
there somewhere but he has got a board

Nelligan reflect here's a guy it now we
are arriving at you like creative music
noise mr. far away is a kind of an old
song actually but I think it's a really
relevant song for all the things that
are going on in the world right now I
wrote it when I was travelling Indonesia
now actually throw it there but we were
surrounded by all these different people
from all over the world and we're all
having dinner together one night and
it's really remote little village and I
was noticing how like we all just became
friends so fast and we're all from so
many different backgrounds and the night
we're all different colors and have
different religions and different ways
of thinking seeing the world but and so
I started thinking about how different
we always go and realize that we're all
the same because we're human makeup or
meaning famine with blood so to oppose
and it came to be chosen but we are the
chosen
this lake is amazing apparently they do
like a couple of nights a week and live
music here I'm definitely going to come
back I just want to say guys today like
the amount of connections of major
people and like really crazy
coincidental connections between
unrelated people we were meeting just
the whole thing's blown my mind and it's
a bit of a sign for me that we need to
be spending a lot more time here yeah
just a very chill day like with no real
plans but it just all comes together so
nicely and I feel like the community
I've been craving for so long I've got
feeling a lot of the connections I want
to be making are going to be here so
we're going to try and be around as much
as possible the next couple of months
even though we have a few do trips plans
and stuff I feel like this is definitely
what we sell it was going to be which is
a cool base before I hit the bed I've
got a big announcement I want to tell
