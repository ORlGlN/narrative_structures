good morning guys
me and Raya flying to Abu Dhabi today we
have a 30 hour flight but thankfully
because we're going there for work we're
flying business class which I'm very
excited about and we're flying via Tokyo
so we're boarding our first right now
and then we have a short layover and
then we're heading on already been
handed some orange juice before we take
off
managed to get a window seat
unfortunately this is where I are
sitting far away from me I'm literally
all the way down there why we say putt
for par okay and I guess we can get
loads of work done this flight say okay
you comfy
and amazingly Phoenix a riotous like me
there's a lady sitting here before I
guess again she goes
we're so much closer there's still
another way but first thing we like
really pathetic but we've just really
enjoyed being back together after their
wealth like this
something about safe we're really
enjoying it
so Roya is having a deal with that
have been editing the entire flight
snap
well flight log which is like a big deal
like these logs take up to 10 hours then
is there like lots of these to go
through pretty happy and
when we land I would have to show you
how cool the toilets are in business
boss
okay so firstly they have a window
louver the view it's pretty cool isn't
it and then secondly check this out I've
never seen this in a plane before
this is like a bday I think ok I won't
be able to demonstrate on the vlog but
the options are a front wash for the
women a soft wash or a backwash and then
you've got different precious
quite finished rendering on the fly so
I'm carrying my laptop with me whilst we
go through security of customs and
checking in my next flight
I'm hoping that upload once we're here
at the airport
good guys I'm pretty proud of myself I
managed to convince them to let me take
my laptop through the scanner it was
still open she kept telling me to close
yeah I was like really almost closed it
cuz I don't want to like crash my render
anyway I got your three still rendering
we're just gonna find our gate now how
was your flight
protip you should try to sleep at the
like time of your destination so I think
it's like 10:00 a.m. and Abu Dhabi right
now so it's kind of like I slept through
the night
yeah alright guys this is our flight I
can't read Japanese but
this is it the yh7 one gate 23 abu dhabi
well that was quite the fiasco we've
just been running around for lost hours
two different lounges managed to upload
my vlog thankfully I feel a lot calmer
than I did an hour ago anyway um think
we're boarding soon briar and me just
got our names cooled out I think they
need to check our passes or something
and then I might grab a bite to eat
before we head off in the next leg I
think this is quite a long flight I
think this might be like a 12-hour
flight we are about to board I just want
to show you guys these incredibly
Japanese vending machines
these are everywhere in Tokyo even like
on the street they do ones which serve
hot drinks which I'm sure I showed on my
my last vlog in Japan thank you
thank you very much thank you hello okay
okay we're singing a little bit closer
together to this flight still not as
close as we could
yeah I thinking we can watch some shows
together I found out they have internet
on the flight which is handli exciting
to do some work famously I should
probably sleep in this place
I'll trying to get a couple of hours
sleep
what's this
what the heck is this the table I love
how different airlines have different
ways of doing the table well that is a
chunky table
okay so Riya has suggested I do a review
of the Etihad business class what do we
think so far amazing service very
pillows it's a massage thing
have you found it
it's not really muscles just like it's
like a thing that's likely to pumping
like pulsing my back which is pretty
good
this is the competition blanket
it's nothing
which is quite louder than I set up my
iphone to record the audio hopefully
that's a bit better than the camera
audio that was capturing
yeah so I've got my dad now
nice little freak shutter to pass the
dish I was impressed with a little quick
basic math good flavor and yeah the
thing I love the most
now the bill is the coffee is like
tropical thank you
right I got six hours left to the flight
I've been working pretty hard I did
watch a movie I watched em come Island
skull skull island King Kong
some of us it was pretty epic it was
pretty epic
anyway
to continue my review again I'm very new
to this so they really know I'm doing
but I thought I'd check out the the
bathroom it's a little bit different
from bathrooms in economy class which
might normally fly this is an exception
this business class flight anyway the
main thing I noticed two things right
firstly same as the other plane were in
there's a window I already see anything
because it's nighttime anyway again nice
view unlike the other plane there's a
few more
things this toilet has it has some
alcohol antibacterial gel
I guess this is just so
some hand cream
and my favorite
it has facial mist now I'm gonna be
honest here I've never tried a facial
mist before in my entire life so
give us a guy
I've decided I'm gonna try the bed out
I'm gonna try and get a few hours sleep
gonna have a little look in the toiletry
bag that I requested this wasn't given
out as a standard thing what we got here
we have oh pretty nice face mask
this feels like
really soft material I'm gonna put that
on
pair of sleeping silks travel socks are
they they're gonna wear those
that's it there is a pair of slippers as
well that all I'll show you when I wake
up
nice right
now I'm just gonna reply the chair
Oh
let me just shuffle up a little bit
Oh
are the ghosts completely flat come on
come on baby
but the light goes off as well that's
pretty cool
I also be sitting on the pillow very
comfy pillow as I was saying earlier and
yeah
facemask time right see you in a couple
of hours might wake up I guess to have
some breakfast or something
Abu Dhabi we've arrived
it's Matthew that's me I'm just waiting
for my girlfriend she's is coming you've
arrived to our hotel and then we have a
little car a little golf cart this is
cool
I don't know where we go in
well this is epic
we have our own pool and the beach is
right there that it's very cool
yeah I had one of those chairs
we have one of those chants so that has
got to be one of the longest days of
travel I think I've ever done it it
seems like we left were Bryant I said
actually we we are going to bed he'll at
5:00 a.m. and she just checked her fiber
she set an alarm for 5:00 a.m. before
this morning where it was actually two
days ago whenever we left whenever we
left to go into the airport to come
amidst these couple of flights to get
here it was 5:00 a.m.
technically two days ago anyway I'm
confused we're gonna have an amazing few
days in Abu Dhabi we're gonna be yeah
seeing the sights doing a lot more than
that I did it last time when I was here
on the world flight by the way we
haven't seen that video if you haven't
seen that collection of videos I think
they've blown you can click at the end
or whatever and yeah we're gonna be
doing a lot more and seeing a lot more
and I'm excited to take you guys along
for the journey all right see in the
morning
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
