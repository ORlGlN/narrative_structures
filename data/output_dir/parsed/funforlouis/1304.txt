hello everyone my name's oli and today
you have the chance torch the awesome
adventures of fun for Louie enjoy this
morning me and Rachel are off on a road
trip to byron bay
we're leaving slightly later than
originally planned but it's all good
it's all good I don't think we're on if
you like oh we went into like we saw it
and it's been raining like really
heavily I hope it's a bit sunnier biome
day quick coffee stop on the way we've
stopped off for a quick fuel break and I
think we need some some fuel for us as
well feeling a bit tired
like a taffy in Australia to have all
these amazing flavors would be look
and got original orange what is that as
Irish double here
maximum energy look at this guy hello
hello see late night we've stopped us
for a lunch break exam
the weather has got better definitely
got better
what is that there's no I think
Australians have a habit of adding an
apostrophes in their words that are not
so stick and also raised or forgot her
flip-flops so no she's I cannot believe
it's nine days till Christmas
isn't that surreal nine days to
Christmas this is my lunch there doesn't
seem to be any sauce with the mince I'm
used to that I like chili con carne so
that we asked for some hot sauce
this is what we got
death with liquid fire this may this may
be quite hot from the 10 minutes left
this product contains the hottest known
ingredients on the planet Earth
please use of extreme caution is that an
exaggeration
I should just test
which do you think I should make
suggestion
let's go a good thing to that
I'm convinced ready to try some
how's this
really let's get those net let's not see
strip that's not to you spicy
well I don't know what you're
complaining about I need death sauce
I've just given you Dexter
are you coping no good no update
what the source was actually by our
I forget some milk to help
this last time was turned into a bit of
an endurance test like a pain endurance
test
as goes like there's a thousand daggers
in my mouth right now right back on the
road we've done a few hours I don't
really know how many how many we got
left six only six hours left guys we've
just pulled pass apparently a very
famous monument in Australia called the
big banana I know I need to go and
investigate this this looks intriguing
we up and we've come to
investigate the banana now and it turns
out that they've sent it's a whole kind
of theme park and have a knick-knack
shop around this phenomena I'm still
trying to figure out the significance of
the big banana but this is intriguing
very intriguing
the banana is locked by the banana looks
what wise have been on the left
I want to go in when you go in
apparently the big banana generated a
spirit that wolf goodwill and
entrepreneurial endeavor we are
switching drivers again we're we're
still doing it
I think we're like an hour and 20
minutes away so we've made with a lot of
mileage today Oh
we've arrived in Byron Bay and we're
both very hungry we're just having a
little discussion of whether to eat
sushi or not to eat sushi and I was just
saying I'm when I'm hungry I'm not sushi
doesn't spring to mind that's all I'm
saying but I think we gotta go fighting
else now I've got a question for you
Australia why do kitchens closed at 9:30
that's not an appropriate time to close
the kitchen in a restaurant that's too
early people want to eat at 9:30 me
so I've learned that everywhere closes
at 9:30 enviro baby and that's kind of
confused me because I don't know how
this I don't know how people do things
in the evening do they just go to bed is
that what happens is that everyone
environment may you go to sleep early
that's weird I thought people were cool
here just take it as it comes
ok ok oh no I'm just I got a little bit
hungry
this might be the option found out
another important fact about my room not
only are you not allowed waters
you're not allowed goats or pigs on the
beach
it is raining again we have to drive
back to where it's thanks right
oh that is heavy right
right with combats we're stayin tonight
and we've got a couple of rooms and then
tomorrow we're meeting Rachel's friends
so we're gonna figure out where we're
staying tomorrow night oh wow it's been
a long day of driving today and sorry I
hadn't made that eventful but hopefully
it's gonna be a really fun few days in
Byron Bay and I am exhausted and my
stomach's feeling a bit bad from the
chili I ate at lunch time I think I
won't regret that and thank you for the
suggestions for books I should read from
yesterday's vlog I am going to look for
all of those comments and Rach was gonna
help me pick a couple of books maybe
that you should read cool well I catch
you guys tomorrow peace out enjoy life
and live the adventure
