throw that away
I've just been chilling with Nick and
Ange catching up a little bit I haven't
seen them properly at months but we are
we're running down to the beach again
because there's literally another insane
sunset and last week Nick bought a drone
one of the the DJI phantom4 I think it
is this guy
I think he's gonna try and take you out
the reason I haven't got a drone there
guys is that I II just I've already got
too many things going on for me trying
to film daily I just don't need a drone
in my life right now
maybe one day but I'm quite happy taking
other people I don't have enough in my
life
oh yeah you can talk about how did they
find me when I tell it when it turns
just quality attractive you found me
yeah come play with us yeah I'm a
plugger
are you landing in the middle of my shot
you landing the middle my shot no yeah
keep it out keep it up bring it this way
what we found Nick Shak this is a
24-hour hot tub I better just test this
quickly oh that's perfect that is
perfect
is that a frog goods can you hear that
so guys I was standing in the lobby with
Nick reached into my pocket to get my
wallet and then realized it wasn't there
and that the last time I had it was down
at the beach when we were filming like
the time-lapse I was using it to prop up
my camera top to film a time-lapse of
the clouds and then I just II Billy just
left it on the sand and this is like
half an hour ago and the tide has been
rapidly coming in so my wallet with all
my credit cards debit cards driving
license has probably been swept out to
sea which is very annoying on the second
day of being here in Hawaii I'm gonna
walk down now and see I can find it this
is not cool guys really not cool
I think it was over here somewhere like
a misdirection
guys where is it
oh my gosh guys it's still here sitting
where I left it
oh my goodness I am so lucky I cannot
believe that I cannot believe that my
wallet and get swept away well that
someone didn't steal it
that was really stupid of me this was on
the sand by just out by the sea was like
the tide is just about to hit you've
been there for like half an hour just on
the floor
I'd like guaranteed you the toys take an
hour and then I water and shine the line
the floor and it's just like sitting and
through another vegetable medley
check out this dinner guys night right
we're gonna get some sleep soon after we
finish those thing and I'm looking
forward to showing you guys Hawaii as I
discover a bit of Maui and then go over
to Kona I think it's gonna be phenomenal
week or two a week I don't know how long
we're here for this could be great
anyway I'll catch you guys in the
morning
peace out enjoy your life and live the
adventure
