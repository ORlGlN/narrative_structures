ladies and gentlepeople would like to be
the first to welcome into dallas-fort
Worth International Airport good morning
boys we've landed in Dallas on a layover
to Hawaii but we only have less than an
hour to get to our connecting flight
site we've got rush through US Customs
we've just been given these special
orange tickets the guests Holgate
okay guys we've got through customs just
about some reason they were hassling
Raya which doesn't make any sense to me
because I'm the foreigner but we have
less than seven minutes for our flight
starts building hopefully his name will
hold up
guys Riya has had terrible luck this
morning she was questioned twice coming
through customs and then she has her bag
thoroughly checked and because we're
already running late I had to go ahead
she's like go go go
but dauntless this Skylink train and
have literally been sitting on the train
platform minutes - it's worse no no I
think luckily her flights been delayed
by like 40 minutes so hoping
yes sweet
this is a flight hasn't boarded yet you
have extra tracks they are incomplete
why here we come you excited Roy yeah
we've been sent away before we neither I
wish I can say this is going to be
another country but and Hawaii's America
hello
we're getting the wrong way
turn around I need to get to Hawaii
we've landed we've landed in Maui Hawaii
first-ever time to Hawaii this is
exciting
cannot wait we're in Hawaii
we've arrived in paradise it's confirmed
we've arrived
guys I edited three vlogs on the plane
so they're scheduled for the next three
days and I feel great all my works done
the Sun is out we're in paradise and
we're heading for lunch do you feel
great yeah
we've decided already guys we found this
Mexican place
and we've just got some veggie burritos
and I'm just just so happy here it's
like the vibes already good wives
as it
look there's a coconut just sitting
right there where did that come from
I found some mangoes for Raya I found
them
too hard
and they know good enough
so we grabbed a couple of drinks got
some coconut water and some kombucha and
we were trying to find some Sun cream
that doesn't pollute the reef Roy was
saying a lot of the traditional song
cretins are damaging to the marine life
so we're trying to find like her an
eco-friendly song cream does anyone know
like brands of song cream or the things
we need to look out for when it comes to
using the right kind of Sun cream so it
doesn't damage wildlife please please
let us know guys check out that rad
Sankar so that's pretty epic right one
day can we build a big sandcastle
maybe yeah
we're going on a mission to find a cool
spot to watch the sunset agree
the seaweed is their vibrant bright
green flip-flops are not easy to walk in
on these rocks but the rocks really
spiky for your feet or I just said that
panties her and that one's me
that was a pretty spectacular first
sunset in Hawaii and check this out we
just got back to our hotel and we're
greeted with a flaming entrance drinking
there'll be a fire show somewhere we
should go and try and see like there
whether they call it a luau a luau
so me and Ryan have been fighting the
jet lag
getting a bit of editing done and that
burrito PA earlier I'm still full from
so I'm gonna try going on my sewing day
but we haven't got a lot of the kids
everything closes quite early they say
there's a little store that we popped
into earlier
it's open till 11:00 so we're gonna go
in them grab a few snaps I so warm
it's crazy warm isn't it it like hasn't
even dropped in temperature at all since
earlier they are the best
this store has $18 for wife
Rises it's the wrong shape I just think
it's too boxy every to do better I think
we can yeah
this is a weird thing
I mean I think salesmen
yes Li Aloha I feel like I'm in that
scene of dumb and dumber when they have
to just get the essentials in the shop
I've already picked up some teeth placed
and some Krazy Glue because I'm
definitely out of Krazy Glue
and this is always very important to
travel with for me it's vibrating things
so we did look at some of the other
Hawaiian shirts in there but I think
we're gonna wait and I haven't told you
guys yet but we're meeting up with Nick
and Ange tomorrow they're gonna come
pick us up there in another island right
now where are they they're in Kauai and
they're gonna fly to this island which
is Maui all right and we're all gonna
hang out it's so good but maybe Nick
hasn't got a Hawaiian shirt yet so we
can go Hawaiian shirt shopping I think
that's a good a good plan I think it's
one guys
managed to push through is almost half
11:00 yeah I've realized the twine
zionism that would this is actually the
furthest west I've been in the world and
I know the world's rap but like times oh
