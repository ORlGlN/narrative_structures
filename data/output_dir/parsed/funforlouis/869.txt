hi my name is diva and I'm originally
from Melbourne Australia but right now
I'm at the Colosseum in Rome Italy and
you're watching fun for Louie
good morning guys it's a refreshing
start to the day I'm just walking down
to me a taxi and we're heading to catch
a flight to milford sound which is i
think half an hour away over the
mountains incredible views apparently
this is Blair our pilot and we're
step-ups walking to the runway and board
the plane
that was an incredible flight guys epic
epic
it honestly feels like we've flown into
some prehistoric like hidden land I
don't think I've ever seen anything like
this
the plan is now I've been dropped down
at the dock and he has done trotted me
up the other guys I can get hold of him
because there's no phone reception but
he's Jordan yeah you know I was coming
oh yeah I I couldn't get very many one
but I managed to get a flight this
morning really I just flew in there
oh so thanks bro I just caught a flight
in this morning I just caught a flight
in to meet you guys he was dead over 36
hours without hearing a word from him
and he's alive I mean like we should
sing a song oh I'm sorry
right no I can't I thought is annoying
Bertie that's a dinner table risotto
good time
guys these the batteries these are some
of the batteries that I was trying to
transport down but failed one mission
and you got into Christchurch
okay so I found their way here okay as
you can see you
he borrowed from his kids and I mean
took this and then we got some noodles
so this is not waterproof by any means
but if it goes in the water it is going
to sink but it's going to give us a
couple extra seconds to dive in there
and pull it out which means everything
will get ruined for the most part but
will these tablets we can fix summer
those Kris is currently getting in the
exit throwing shot of the waterfall
and just flew really high coming down
he does not want to crush that into the
water
amazing news guys
they have coffee on the boat this is
going to warm me up
we've driven the boat into the sunshine
and it is glorious guys it's glorious
apparently it's very rare to get weather
like this look guys one of the plays and
stop rotating crazy I don't know if you
can fly that's an 11
then Apple must buy here call that
distance fall off my
in all the way it's like having an
airplane takeoff and only having the
left wing does that freak you out a
little bit well we have a $50,000 camera
I didn't have it they just told me as
well this is 300 meters deep so we're
never getting out we're getting some
flybys with the drone of this little
group of seals and they don't seem fazed
by it at all they're just chillin
this is absolutely incredible they've
taken off with the driving whilst we
move in on the boat and we're cracking
this other boat while driving and it is
still laughing coming very fast high
speed high speed repairs
who's just docked the boat and I think
we're going to get to do some kayaking
now - pretty exciting
right I've been told I need to take my
jeans up and switch to shorts that's
better
right I'm in my kayak I really hope I
don't drop this camera in the water only
she's got it we've been in the water for
about ten minutes and this already rates
is one of the best things I've ever done
this is in sine beautiful day probably
the best scenery I've seen ever you
speechless these guys getting some shots
from the boat bus when they say go so
behind us is a mix of saltwater and
freshwater but this bit here is flowing
straight from the glassy or at the top
of that mountain so apparent you can
drink it I'm gonna give a little go
guys check this out milford sound voted
the world's top tourism destination that
is quite the claim i may agree right
we've got in from our first kayak and
got this underwater chamber for this
spiral staircase coming down here to
them check out how it is incredible
marine life in the in the water here
this is kind of magical this is called
black coral and this is the shallowest
depth it can grow out in the world in
this lake because of the salt and
freshwater divide something to do with
the water makes it possible we're
heading back out the tire now Jordan
Jordan's going to join us
how'd you find that Jordan I'm so
excited guys lunch has arrived
Oh guys I'm taking this opportunity to
some babe and it's kind of ironic
because apparently this is the rainiest
place on earth Rainier than any other
place on earth but we've just got here
in a really good day
probably gonna get back on the boat now
look how high the drone is that is
insane I've never seen it that high but
I think we're going to get an insane
never flown that high before sending
clear nozzle to go above 400 feet we got
some information from the airport here
to fly above our ball our
and I went and I was above the water
falling another hundred footers Oh were
you scared
and especially kind of like Devin Graham
$50,000
Chris get some cool photos of this
drying
we're back in the RV this is like an
identical RV to the one we had on the
North Island and we're going to drive
although back to Queenstown how long's
our drive for four or five hours I'm
hoping we can stop up for some food
before we go
this is a famous wild bird I've ever met
hello hello hello we've made about
twenty minutes into our five hour drive
because we've kept on stopping off for
your own shot and also found that rapid
bird
furthermore some birds corner pet bird
lover is protected
we're making some good progress on the
way back to Queenstown and we've stopped
off in er I don't know where we are all
right well guys that was one of the most
epic days of my life seeing the beauty
of Milford Sound we're now back in
Queenstown and I'm going to need to get
some sleep but I will see you on Monday
because I'm taking some day off a lot of
you may know I'm now taking Sundays off

life with the adventure
