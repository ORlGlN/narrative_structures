house and the garden was a little bit
overgrown and we'd organised to get a
gardener in there as a nice thing to do
for him and it's the best time I've seen
it's looking pretty awesome like all of
this was overgrown there's like bushes

good job yeah like all of these flower
beds and stuff these are all full of
weeds little Primrose is this looks
completely different isn't it that's a
real transformation

little bit a little bit long tends to
happen with hair we're just trimming I
don't know it interests but how long do
you think that is like few inches yeah
something like that yeah

but it's good it's good - it's good to
knit or not yeah she's getting on the
fluff Unni is it quite messy

that's good because some people really
find it painful and you know I I'll be
doing this yeah
