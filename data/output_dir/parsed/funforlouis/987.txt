we have arrived in an area called
Bandstand
we're taking a little stroll around
apparently there's like a fort around
here somewhere so we're going to walk
over and see this for I think one of my
favorite things about India is the
hand-painted signs everywhere
so beautiful they're like the Hindi
writing and I don't know I just I love
it
feels more authentic and it gives places
more character
the guys this fort behind me was built
by the Portuguese in 1640 it's a long
time ago guys are these tuk tuks around
here bringing back a lot of memories
from last year for the rickshaw
