fun freely it's our final morning in
South Africa and now we're heading back
to England via Dubai it's going to be a
whole day of flying so hopefully we get
some legroom this has been such a flyby
visit to Cape Town that we're just
trying to see one more friend before we
get to the airport she's she's just
gonna run out of her office we're gonna
say hello my name's Jess think we were
supposed to check in may be already so I
don't know how late I don't think really
I think airlines are pretty
nice it's one of those things you can be
relaxed with and just turn up late it's
more this addition yeah suggested to
take off it's the end for the moment
temporarily of team abundance is
breaking apart
we should probably hurry now we were
being too blase about this I hope we can
have some legroom who got hurt yesterday

Dave's gonna try and get his flag on and
see if he can get us upgraded and it's
on to business or first-class I I don't
think this is gonna work but
who knows worth a little try they like
the story about making a cool video on
the plane but you didn't seem to have
any power so we're gonna try again at
the game trick number one and trying to
get something is using the social
endorsement from test report yeah after
will be our endorsement when we get to
the game we we've done a little TV down
the line
on to plan B basically we're in our
seats that we were assigned but they
look power power and see Zulu are
high-tech man USB what you send a not
