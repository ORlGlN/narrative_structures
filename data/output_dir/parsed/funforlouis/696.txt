guys we are near Oslo in Norway and me
and David going to go for a little ride
of this boat looks like you got
something jakey these guys you got a
bitch you got some seaweed
yeah this is gonna be cool
silly boys well you can probably see
right up Bassitt shorts from the company
on the end of the Louie look how cool
they look on the end of that oh wow you
look awesome
so guys this is our Airbnb were staying
right in there to this Lake is this a
Lake was this - see they call it a Ford
which I believe is Leakey but I can't be
sure that it doesn't connect to the see
that boat goes away these guys wanted to
swim across here but I'm not a good
swimmer so I was just gonna follow them
in the boat
Wow yeah this guy only built the house
he's only lived in it two weeks and we
got this brand-new house we found a
purple starfish yesterday did you see
that I bet there's crazy sea monsters in
there that are so great that we don't
have to be directional with the camera
yeah can't believe he's finally getting
married I never played some yeah I never
get bored of sunsets some people do I
just love this jelly-like look that's
the weird thing about water isn't it is
that it's like half a solid and half not
solid it is all it's like a membrane
isn't have you look at a glass of water
it kind of can go over the top of the
glass when I go to space I want to mess
around with water cause it looks crazy
in space when's that happening YouTube I
think once once we've got flying around
the world done yeah then we can think
about what's next
this is what I want though mate this is
what I want from like any land that we
can try and get was it on a big bit of
water like this on water with trees but
mainly like off-the-grid but not far
from the grid because we still need to
travel and you know meet other people
but this is such a good place to create
we can make all sorts of amazing things
here yeah southern England do any of you
guys know anywhere within its hour's
drive of like sari or London that's like
a big lake with forests that we can buy
basically that's nice
we can make our own little Ewok village
there caverns
well the thing is people didn't
understand when I first built my cabin
like seen weird in the back of my own
garden they cost like 20 grand and it's
been my home for five years if you're
like paying rent in London yeah you
probably pay flip in what do you pay
like a grand a month
12 grand a year see they would pay twice
that just to rent in London for five
years and I've got my own cabin so land
seems crazy but it's actually not crazy
well I watched this guy talk last year
according a seam tar lab and he has this
book called Andy fragile and he
basically says that the man-made world's
we live in are so uniformed and
essentially boring that it makes us go a
bit crazy like all these white walls
they're pure white there's not much
information from that bird oh ah what is
he does anybody know what that bird I
think it's just a seagull Bray I like
him but because like rocks like this if
you look at this rock it has like a
purple layer a yellow with a different
texture has white the light shining on
it in so many different ways it's like
it's interesting data to our brain and
that's how we're built we're almost
we're built in
joy complexity and our were like
cubicles in our offices basically make
us go a bit crazy there's not enough
information to process which is why I
think we feel comfortable and good in
nature but they save variety is the
spice of life than they exactly anything
with very variants in them jellyfish
right they're right behind you look look
okay hopefully we'll float past it you
guys wait wait can you see it I hope you
can jerk and they're poisonous
yes yeah yeah yeah those tentacles
coming off the bottom hey guys catch
this jellyfish yeah he's a big guy yeah
I'll jump in bro and just grab a with my
hands are you filming these rocks have
gone purple does anybody know what it is
maybe it's those flowers above it maybe
those flowers those are plants above it
but isn't cuz we saw a starfish
yesterday that was bright purple never
seen any well it's like the lichen or
something all that algae is probably the
algae bro you guys know what it is
definitely tell us cuz I've never seen
in my life before
where's the fish amazing if they call
metal right now yeah
we got in yeah it's good
