good morning guys it's day six of the
live the adventure Africa trip it's
bright and early
6 a.m. just about to head off and I
think we're gonna find some elephants
that's the plan and we've got we've got
these big poncho blankets to keep us
warm and as we did yesterday we're
splitting into two cars
how you feeling Taylor oh my gosh
you're not really oh so it's not bad oh
it started
the sender droned go find the elephants
so the elephants are on this Ridge and
there
the boys are finding them with the pride
it's cool to see some masters at work
I'm trying my best to get shots of the
elephant but they're so far away all
right I'm struggling with this lens a
little bit because it's not connecting
properly to my camera it's it's
connecting through this mess of bones
adapter but somewhere there's a loose
connection so it's not all auto focusing
but I tried I tried to get some shots of
the elephants I've got the six hundred
mil at full length and I'm using my
clear images oome on the Sony and I
think I've got the elephants and shot
time for a little coffee stop okay we're
gonna do a team photo before we leave
we're going to assemble on the two cars
thank you time for breakfast vegan
sausage its steps ah perfect thank you
oh yeah calm believe how early eight
still it's the only one feels like it
feels like it's the end of the day
already
right we had lunch we've had a little
nap I've got some work done and now
we're going out on another game drive to
find some what we're looking for
Matthias she is we're gonna find it she
hardly
we've just figured out as an amazing
echo from this spot
so we've arrived at the top of the
mountain I was mistaken earlier we
haven't had lunch we had breakfast but
because we got up at like 5:00 a.m. I
was really confused so this is actually
lunch and let at this location the
longest I've ever liked okay a cheeky
little orange juice
this is chase Morning News France
cheers bro yes you gonna do this with
one.txt Oh
I uh got my big lens out again today
trying a different speed booster Jacob
had this speed booster which gives you a
cropped image but it's working now with
the lens whereas the meta bones I had
wasn't working or wasn't engaging
properly anyway this is kind of tech jog
and for those of you that know what I'm
talking about but I'm gonna try and
update the firmware on the meta bones
adapter tonight and see if I can get it
working with the lens properly tomorrow
okay we're wrapping up a cool photo
shoot we've been doing on the edge here
and got instagrams for months now and
we're gonna jump back in the cars and
hopefully gonna find some animals
there's a cheetah hiding around here
somewhere
the animals in this game reserve they
have trackers for the treater and the
elephants I think kind of ping them and
find out where they are
Livi God we carried away following the
wildebeest and he's lost the trap just
now we're trying to work it out this is
what out - yeah fly across here that's
right yeah you will see the road then
I'll let you know just matters
I think it is taking you home I think
home is the controller
founder there we are and that's what's
that's the measurement to show you
yan can you explain where we're heading
and what we found we melt she does the
latest addition to tomorrow okay stick
together guys I don't think I've tried
to cheer by foot before I think this is
a first so there's a really strong
signal which means it could be anywhere
here they haven't spotted it yet
it literally be like hiding behind that
verse
such a animal
is there enough
okay I've swapped cars I'm rolling with
this squad now I've missed you guys
so Yan was just telling us that the Cape
Mountain zebra that we just saw at one
point were super endangered super
endangered and there's only possibly you
know less than a hundred left are the
dry anyway now good news now that
there's I guess they've been they come
back from the brink of extinction that's
cool good news is a success story
guys we have arrived at this amazing
sheer drop off the side of the mountain
for sunset and we had all four drones in
the air just now and now we're doing
some yeah get some photos girls they
just taken in the view this is
unbelievable we have every camera
rolling right now that's how beautiful
it is
okay jealousy felt a sick Rock to stand
on down here yeah this one here sick
I made it onto the rock it is pretty
precarious I'm kind of balancing on the
top here and it's a sheer drop so I'm
not going to stay here for long but you
