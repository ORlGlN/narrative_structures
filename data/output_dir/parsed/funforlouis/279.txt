good afternoon guys very excited today
we've just arrived at the Warner
Brothers Studio Tour and we are going to
go see basically Hogwarts and all the
Harry Potter stuff and Roy has never
been here before
I came a few years ago you're excited
right do you not remember I know you're
freaking out Lana you've been here
before haven't you you aren't even ready
honestly like you don't even understand
humming Wow if you want to give the
doors at Jasmine fish so we've been let
into the Great Hall this is the first
part of the tour and this is like
amazing last time I was here I think it
was like maybe even three years ago two
or three years ago we had a dinner party
here and we met all the like animal
actors and stuff literally on set right
now we just walked into the Great Hall
look at this guy's how insane this is
the Christmas that they like totally
Christmas it out so it's like extra
magical just on top of like basically as
magical as you can get just add more
magic on top
that's what's happening right now
okay I didn't think ahead today guys and
I just wore like my hoodie but Riya was
a little bit disappointed because we
want to get some proof io so they've
kindly got me the cloak to it so I'm
going to wear this for the rest of tour
and I'm gonna get my Griffin at this is
fine yeah oh my gosh yeah I bet yeah
that looks good
so my favorite book was the fourth one
the Goblet of Fire and when I was
reading it that part when Hermione comes
down the stairs and said the yield ball
and she's all dressed up in the book it
made it sound like it was like she's so
dressed up and so like breathtakingly
beautiful and I was reading that and I
was like holy crap I cannot wait to
watch the movie and see like what she
looks like that's that part like stuck
out to me the most I'm so excited to see
it come to life in the movie and here
are their costumes this is the dress
that Hermione were so beautiful
guys imagine a bowl of ice cream this
big
hahaha I definitely would not stay
together
here's the makeup area this is one of my
favorite costumes it's also from the
Goblet of Fire just think that's so
beautiful
I think one of the most fascinating
things to me is the amount of like
background stuff that maybe it's only on
camera for like two seconds but it's
like the detail the attention to detail
with all of these props and like
stick-on beards and stuff is absolutely
incredible I bet some of these didn't
even make it on camera this is very
special so this this sticks on his
forehead those moles there they go even
faintly Wow Ray's got with you and then
they just like color it in pretty much
whoa renowned those grunting up around
the date seriously what is someone gonna
make a boarding-school that is like
fully designed like Hogwarts because I'm
100% letting my kids very kidding
imagine if you could have actually gone
to boarding school that looks like this
so this is Harry's invisible cloak and
he's just saying that the green here is
where they green screened it out when he
was putting it on I said we're in the
other way around
Wow Dumbledore's office this must be the
coolest set
Wow I'm sorting head
he'snot to sit in the corner
I think the coolest thing about coming
here is realizing how much work went
into making these movies I think we
watch so many movies nowadays and you
like don't even really think about how
they're made but example this is the
potion classroom and every single label
was made like hand-painted magic so
magic wand Bueller's details
yeah big Alexa I know come here oh my
gosh are you kidding a little behind the
scenes info Hagrid was had a body double
that was like a big rugby player and and
he had a costume that made him like
seven foot six or something so he was
huge and then he had like this head that
he would put on to look like Hagrid and
that he was mainly used for like further
away shots and stuff but um Hagrid's hut
which is where about right now they
actually had to build two of these like
two two different scales they built it
to scale with each actor basically so
they had to like exact things but one
everything's like a little bit smaller
because everything need to sit with the
actor that was inside look just crazy
and this actual hut they took it on
location in Scotland so they like I
guess put it on the truck Orlando and
like brought it all the way to Scotland
to shoot and throw the bag
something that's just being clarified
for me is the difference between special
effects and visual effects so visual
effects is all like computer eyes like
green screens and backgrounds and
special effects is where the props
themselves line animatronics and like
explosions and stuff and that's special
effects so there was a combination of
both in the movie and I think I think
it's hard to see sometimes what's you
generated and what's been made from
props the last time I came here they
didn't have this section opened because
they didn't have the Train this is
unleased from a museum and it was
apparently over there at the time so
they now have the Hogwarts Express the
actual train they used in the movies
this is unbelievable
it's like legit this isn't a model train
this is an active train
Oh
how awesome is this train oh my gosh
this is like all I've ever wanted its be
on this train and go to log words it
never kind of doing it so the train was
for the exterior shots for the movie and
this is where the actors did all their
acting instead
here we go the famous triple decker bus
to do it so I'll add an extra death on
my bus guys there is snow machine check
it out
it's acting snow oh my gosh this is
amazing I know maybe it's fun but it's
cold
it's snowing yeah actually smells of
soap look at my camera hot words time
you have to go have to go we're the
animatronics and like model room this is
awesome
Christa button yeah
my gosh is ringing
yeah guys this is where Raya got her
arachnophobia from this guy out of Harry
Potter look okay but can you blame me
like I mean it's kind of terrifying but
real spiders aren't that big
I heard they are not real yeah oh my god
I can't okay
oh yeah look at that days
as gross so all the buildings in the
movies they built scale models out of
cardboard and then they chose the camera
angles in real life first and then they
built this so pretty
so this is 24 times smaller than the
real one these are some clips from the
movies of how the model was used and
then it's like going back and forth from
the prop to the green-screen then the
final effect it's pretty cool borrowing
the gift shop I've got the perfect gift
for Raya why is she going well we are
leaving the studio's now that was so
much fun guys such an amazing tour is
now dinner time we all start being safe
find somewhere nearby basically the
nearest restaurant we can get tea so we
double on or off for her Airbnb and I
just boosted board it down to Regent
Street to upload my blog which is a
little bit late guys I'm sorry it's half
past 10 I've been uploading my blogs but
later I'm thinking
 uploading a couple of minutes from
there so let's give it a go
right all done in about five minutes
exactly what I was hoping for Ryan now
needs to go home and film and edit video
so she's she's stressing out a little
bit because this this wasn't part of the
plan means stopping to upload but it's
all done now back on the road
Hey sorry where was the end of a very
magical day guys tomorrow we are leaving
