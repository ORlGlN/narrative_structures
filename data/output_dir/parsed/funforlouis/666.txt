Joshua Tree ready to watch the meteor
shower tonight and you're watching fun

headquarters for the general assembly

it's quite exciting I also need a coffee

something this guy's the police our
cordoning off this road because very
important political figures are about to
arrive at the UN we are now chilling
outside waiting for my friend barri

Thanks
oh hey there brother
welcome thank you thank you good to be
here
pretty cool yeah take it in that's sweet
we are in the lobby of the UN building
now we have these policies these are the
best bosses to get inside we're just
someone's just asking for us or do we
get to bear paths I don't even know
who's supposed to be filming
Road because the flag come out
good good good probably stick it back
now
guys we've just met Mitchell who are you
Mitchell and could you explain to my
audience firstly who the UN are and then
what the General Assembly is as well
well the United Nations is like kind of
like a club that the governments of the
world started 70 years ago because they
needed a place to talk about the big
issues that affected them all at that
time it was mostly about peace it was
about war because 70 years ago they were
just Wars popping up everywhere but over
the past 70 years this club is grown in
every country that it emerges on earth
gets to join and now it's now it's a
place to talk about solving world hunger
keep maintaining peace dealing with the
environment and all the thorny issues
that affect us all no matter what
country we live in
ooh and what's the what's the General
Assembly what's happening happening this
way every year
lots of work is being done all year long
that's all negotiations and what should
be done about each issue but they recall
the presidents and all the Prime
Minister's together once a year to
actually endorse those so this year
they're gonna vote on a new set of
pillars that everyone's gonna try to
follow for the next 15 years
you know eliminating the worse property
in the world in the rhythm and also
dealing with climate change Postum so
there's there's 17 goals that the UN are
looking at and we're gonna we're gonna
have a little later on and see what
those 17 goals are and see how we can
make a difference and how you guys can
make a difference as a doing a little
interview though Mitchell yes
then David won the back over to get
another drink it's quite interesting
here guys it's not a lot to film but
we've been meeting some cool people just
observing what's going on singing this
projects we can get involved with or the
UN can get involved with projects we're
doing I'll keep you posted
we make any plans but we will be milling
around here a bit more there's an event
on tonight it's gonna be an opportunity
net to network with people and just see
some cool things I don't think we're
gonna meet any Prime Minister's or
presidents today but we're gonna keep
trying as I found all the United Nation
goals for this year or for the next 15
years
number one no poverty zero hunger good
health and well-being quality education
gender equality clean water and
sanitation affordable and clean energy
decent work and economic growth in
industry innovation at infrastructure
reduced inequalities sustainable cities
and communities responsible consumption
in production climate action life blow
water life and land peace and justice
and strong institutions and partnerships
for the dolls in two ways I can get
involved with all of those goals that
being said
sustained it sustainable development
goals and that's what this particular
section I'm in and I've been avoiding
a big thing the General Assembly the
United Nations that's what's being
pushed so I'll let you know when I
figure out how I can get more involved
but it's pretty exciting stuff
we've arrived that Jerome's place he's
very very tired and he's gone to bed
because he's been up for like 24 hours
solid editing a new video for his
YouTube channel which I'll link below

and this is where we gonna sleep we just
got a crash in here it's got a few
little bits around but yeah we could
head out get some food and there's
another thing happening at the UN

party vibe so we're gonna head back down

from the hotel and drop them off I just
wanted to show you one more thing check
this out it's the iPhone 6s oh it's got
the responsive touch so you click and
hold and it does a little it buzzes and
then opens up a new set of menu items so
