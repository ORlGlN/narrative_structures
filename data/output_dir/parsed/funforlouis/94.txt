well this 5 a.m. is time to hit the
airport
and sadly leaving Greece today good news
is I'm going back to Vienna in Austria
and Raya has happened to coincide her
European travels she's doing like a
backpacking trip at the moment and
having lots of fun with korrina her
friend Benny where she's managed to
coincide her travels with me coming back
to the yellow so we get to spend the day
together again so far in the last month
we've managed to catch a couple of days
together in the UK and yeah we've got a
day or two together in Vienna now so I'm
super excited to get back there and I've
got to just hope I catch my flight
No manases dropped the rental car off
and arrived in time for my flight which
leaves are thinking about 55 minutes but
because it's a very small airport it's
all chilled
yeah Athens hello
perfect timing my next flight is
literally boarding now and then miss the
flight all the way to Vienna
to light number two I think this is the
closest connecting flight I've ever had
like closest together like literally
stepping up one plane and stepping spray
onto the other within like ten minutes
in Vienna
I forgot how cold it was here and I'm
still in my shorts but I think it's like
30 degrees outside so I probably need
some iTunes back on see how are you
today guys I found Riya Riya has been on
the best adventure for the last couple
of weeks like traveling around Europe
and yeah I'm just so glad we coincided
tell us tell me your highlights of your
I read about it but there was like a Sun
flare did you read about that yes so it
was like an extra I don't know like the
Sun does extra bright for a little while
and because of that the Northern Lights
were better than ever like even the
locals were like whoa
we both saw I've seen the Northern
Lights like from the plane before but
we've both seen the Northern Lights this
month like from the ground for the first
time so I also recommend you add that to
your bucket list ok guys we've met up
with Lucas and Lisa they're helping me
with some stuff today and we are just
going to find a cool little cafe we
tried to stop it this cafe called the
central cafe this apparently is a bit of
a tourist spot so there's like a massive
line outside like 30 people and there
there's some incredible architecture
here I'm gonna have a little look around
once I've got my coffee what did you say
this building here was better this is
like the main theatre is that cool oh
let's quickly get other way this bus
it's like so much history there's so
many cool buildings
unfortunately because it's a Sunday a
lot of the places are closed but we
still didn't have a wonder around and
just taking the beauty what did you get
do here recently yes which I cannot even
try to pronounce but so you have been to
the end I will know which what I'm
talking about it's like this huge yellow
palace and the gardens behind it are
unbelievable and I would say what else
have you been doing this last month tell
my audience you guys have been choosing
where I go so I'm like Twitter it likes
where I've been heading to next yeah
it's been super fun
oh and I've also been breaking down like
how much I spend on travel and stuff so
it's kind of helping anyone who views
that want to be going backpacking
through Europe this is a huge like also
a fun trip to do yeah and it's been
really nice like even though I've been
having my own adventures like traveling
the world and going in the little plane
with JP it's been so nice to like see
where I is being and and keep up-to-date
on her adventures as well and it's so
cool that we got to meet up here and you
guys voted for Vienna as well so you
guys made this happen yeah thanks guys
appreciate that yeah
guys we're just about to go into some
Peter's Church this is like an
incredible building that looks even more
insane in size we're just gonna have a
little explore if so cool seeing a place
with such history like I think we were
just reading up that maybe this was
first started getting built in the 13th
century and then it wasn't until like
the late seventeen or was it 1792 1792
they completed then it hasn't changed
since then but it was essentially being
built for like five hundred years before
that just like you can stand in there
with a like a fascination of the history
but also it's still like such a
significant spiritual place with people
obviously they were like lighting
candles as prayers and and today's
Sunday so I guess there's like church
services going on there but yeah I
always feel this like real sense of
peace when I walk into kind of old
traditional churches like that because I
guess they've been a place of sanctuary
and worship yeah just like hundreds of
years guys we have found a vegan
restaurant good veggies of the double
Zed also excited this place said it has
the best veggie burgers
we just got dessert this is a vegan
chocolate mousse with blueberries okay
let me taste this
that's really good in there we're back
for the evening we've had a really nice
night and such a fun afternoon exploring
Vienna I wish I could have stayed here a
bit longer and joined in on Ryze
backpacking trip around Europe but
tomorrow I'm meeting back up with JP and
we are continuing our adventure flying
around the world as you know we have
brands supporting the world flight
partnering with us one of those brands
is kayak who are sponsoring today's
video if you're planning a trip to
Europe
kayat can help you make the most of that
trip if you don't know kite is a tool
that searches hundreds of travel
websites to give you the best available
offer and it gives you tips and advises
you the best times to travel and how to
travel within your budget actually Raya
as I said earlier has been making some
videos of her backpacking trip and she's
outlined how much things have costs on
her trip honey yeah just because some I
get so many messages of people asking me
how much trouble really costs and I
remember there's a snowman I told you
one of my sisters friends he was getting
on basically a free flight to Europe and
then he was like oh I don't know what to
do it was like you should just keep
traveling through Europe you know after
your trip he was like I only have six
thousand dollars saved up did I tell you
this no that was like six thousand
dollars you know what you could do with
that
so yeah just I wanted to do this trip to
kind of like show you guys exactly how
much money I'm spending each day just to
get you an idea and to show you that
it's it's possible and yeah people tell
these crazy ideas of how much it costs
and it's so much more affordable than
that also I want to show you guys this
new Facebook filter that kayak have
released it's the I love Europe
Facebook villa check out this cheeky
little badge and then look at this hat
it's like BIGBANG oh they they are
consumer I think is now the Cathedral in
Barcelona yeah yeah I think you're right
man Athens I think Oh have you been to
Athens no oh wait I think I just blew
out about things we got happens today
often people ask me like where should
they travel for their first time abroad
and I would suggest just a trip to
Europe definitely this time of year as
well don't you think like because it's
not as hot of course it was quite cold
usually it's still quite warm but not
super hot and obvious is like high
tourist season so by now things have
calmed down and there's no sending
people and yeah
it's my favourite time for sure
unfortunately I'm leaving Europe
tomorrow I'm heading onwards down into
the Middle East and Asia I'm pretty
excited it's gonna be good but I'm not
excited to be leaving Riya we don't know
when we're gonna see each other next do
it we always say this but this is
actually the hardest one like this time
might actually be there might be two it
might be two months which is a long time
apart that well we'll figure out we'll
figure out I'm gonna see if I can
persuade this come out to Australia to
join me anyway I will catch you guys in
the morning
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
