hi I'm Stefan I'm from London
I'm here at Chichen Itza Mexico and
you're watching from fillory good
afternoon guys me Rachel and Darcy are
heading into London a little bit later
than plans but the rain has stopped
there's a little shower this morning and
it's still quite warm I think we're
gonna head into Shoreditch and get
coffee or surprise Keith Taurus well
after driving for about an hour the
cooler
we've arrived in Shoreditch we're
heading in for a coffee maybe some lunch
as I know it
the club
enjoy this place Rachel this is your
vibe isn't it

Cheers
alright guys rachel has an interesting
story to tell you tell him the
interesting story
then we were sitting in the Sun he
easily yesterday and I looked and I
realize that and listened to you like
the heat it was the heat so to be
sitting in the direct sunlight and I'm
literally any man and someone told me on
Facebook and I yeah all the east around
that's not true okay we've just moved
tables for the fourth time basically
upgrading upgrading tables each time we
see their best but so we've got this
nice day for now it's all about the soft
top cushioned chairs not about these
hard chairs and fortunately for me so
we're having a little break the middle
of our day from our laptop Club and
coffee don't have a method
we haven't had a problem at large in the
world Perry this is one of the best
places in London hey Chloe this isn't a
bad polish would you acknowledge thank
you yeah sure how was your massage
Rachel so good from there
Oh a little lady was walking up and down
my back on her tiptoes
I know who they were only waves that way
it's just everyday life
I want a little ladies to run up and
away back
so even Rachel have found their way over
to Brick Lane because we're both on the
mood for a curry tonight I've been
walking along basically in Brick Lane
everyone's trying to get you into a
restaurant they're like shouting at you
dragon you over to Linda Beals
but we were more interested in some
where we could have a bit laptop Club
and chill down this cool place there's a
map that open window here and we're just
chilling
Great Scott a wine I've got my mango
lassi come in invite advice food has
arrived chicken vindaloo going on there
onion bhajis on the side rate to go up
in Delhi to what look crazy how you
handling evenly what are you going there

I think it's time to head back in fun
evening
it's nice driving into London sometimes
then you don't have to track it back at
the train it screws back another good
thing about not drinking
that's worry about that later
we are back home and it's getting pretty
late now Rachel its Goods bed she's
getting up in an hour and a half and
going to the airport super early to say
I'm sick of my goodbyes and we're gonna
see each other next week when I meet her
in New York so don't panic but I just
wanted to say two things before I go to
bed firstly a lot of today we've just
been brainstorming and planning some
things including a blog which I think I
told you guys about Rachel's helping me
on and I'm just getting some blog
inspiration so one of my friends Emma
sent over her blog and I'm getting some
inspiration from this is pretty cool so
tear this out some little articles you

and give her some love I love all this
illustration and stuff and she's there

anyway I'll link for lately's blog and
the YouTube channel yeah there's some
great content online you've been doing
awesome things and I also want to expand
the content I'm doing and collaborating
people and I don't know it's cool it's
great to see other people doing stuff
and being inspired also a big thing has
happened guys I wasn't here for when it
happened but my dad captured some of the
footage romney has gone
Rodney's been towed away so I'm going to
show you some footage no no no he's not
here but we do have a
Rodney's been sat on the side of the
road for a good couple of months and was
going to need a lot done to him to get
him roadworthy so they've decided
decided to take him to the salvage job
beyond the sky
well that's the sad goodbye to Rodney
and I'll glad my dad captured it so I
could see him one last time I'm gonna
get some sleep now because I'm super
tired and I'll catch you guys tomorrow
