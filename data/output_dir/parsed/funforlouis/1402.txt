chilled morning I came back from Jack's
just been chilling in my fam and now me
and Ben are heading up to Notting Hill
Carnival and Steve's heading up there an
awesome day this is where the so
basically as well as the general like
five people walking around
main procession route where this blokes
there's different light countries
representing their music
today's just going awesomely I love them
I love the carnival
I love starting over
if you go cluster buggery and crowd you
don't enjoy him it's also very proud I
keep losing Ben but luckily he
it is time for some chicken left is
latest possible I love
there is a beautiful sunset and Ben is
risking his life to get a cool shot of
this do not slip away spikes man
but business is not okay I decided I
should probably climb up here as well
it's very naughty but I think these
policemen are coming - first off is
these policemen are telling us to get
down so we better get down there very
angry ass
yeah
right police
something crazy just happened the whole
crowd for its mental metal look at this
look at this
there's always gonna be someone
misbehaving in the carnival
I don't even know happens literally the
crowd part in seconds it's like noon
almost got pushed over
so we've managed to we've managed to get
out of the craziness trying to rescue
Jen you just met Jen who watch in the
minor burns videos and and we just had
to rescue her from all this craziness
though we're just trying to find a bit
something a little less chaotic over
so labor everyone's walking this way and
we're walking this way to the car but
it's been incredible but quite tiring
how did you find your first carnival
experience then I absolutely loved
interference yeah yeah it was wild what
I loved the music
loved the vibe yeah I just had sick time
question is have we got a parking ticket
oh we got one I've just dropped myself
off in Ben's car and we're probably both
gonna get relatively early nice because
it's been very tiring today it's been
awesome but very tiring has been hectic
has been a great day chill out man it's
been a boom well that was a crazy day
I'm gonna get some sleep and I'll see
you guys tomorrow
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure boom
