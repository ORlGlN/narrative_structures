hey everyone I'm a TA I'm from New
Zealand and I am currently in rainy Fiji
but for now you guys watching son - Lily
soon
good morning guys in fact down in Venice
Beach to get some breakfast with Raya we
take an average place called amaze Bowl
how they do really nice I saw you both
standing somewhere and then today is the
day the Raya is buying her first
skateboard
are you excited to learn to skate today
Riya yeah slightly nervous but I won't
use pencil at if I saw my knees don't
get like the police very such a good
idea okay
Nadine the Nadine is filming a 360 video
today and she's going to film her and
Raya learning game
how you feeling wire okay I just like
something but like getting my other
class of course was very hard
yeah she's got this
it has been fun making three to give it
is very different in that the headaches
I can do you can't really do everything
probably managed to grab some lunch and
yeah now it's fun to be some skateboard
shopping now that Royce had a little
taste of what what type of board do you
want so guys this is the first time I've
ridden on a penny longboard they release
the thing about getting a last year
maybe take it for a little spin
yes son
a lot of pepper wear underwear dark oh
you can try to the flowers a nice guys
are just pumped into all these Norwegian
photographers that here you here with
your photo you like your class okay cool
awesome and where you're heading next
San Diego awesome awesome
that's nice to meet you off you found
your ball Wow let's so pretty oh that
looks so good
have you tried it with it one of those
ones you just knew it as your boarders
TV story love at first sight I remember
the excitement again my first board
it is trying to film 360 while skating
harder than it looks
so crazy
hey yeah easy here you go right all
right what's the hardest thing about
skating I think we'll like fishing
control because especially once you
start speeding up and you're feel like I
don't know I'm in the hands knees wheels
you know and then like one little bump
that I could see out listen seriously
for me and leading backwards if I can't
turn that way alright so Cameron had a
slight today but it got delayed till
tomorrow got going so we're just hanging
out still and we're going to I'm going
to take some photos with him his van
because it's their two year anniversary
together what's his name again
Mirror Mirror Mirror the miracle van
that way but I even like the white so
I'm going to take a couple wide and then
I'll go in two guys you just some of the
photos you got too far I likely get on
the reef we're going to try some now
like this in front of the van having
lived in a van for two years would you
think of the best and worst things about
it
meda thing and you can have a home base
wherever you go drive wipe your voice to
California so being able to up and move
your location grants worst thing the
worst thing is probably that you can't
host these variables yeah I mean I can
keep one person in there but its cuddly
and beyond that doesn't look yeah I can
keep one person in there somewhat
comfortably but not super comfortably so
I'm such a part of bringing people and
it's hard for fabulous people but I feel
that I showed that Morgan in the back
yeah
hey guys if you're thinking about living
in a van pros and cons Roy happy look at
that sunset
could you let me by guys I just bumped
into Jesse I'm going to take out his
electric light is it weird to be struck
that I'm silent it's like even quiet
guys I'm getting one of these bikes sure
okay I'm gonna try right board I'll be
really careful that I won't get it back
oh it will I know nice this is a really
nice long good
so Marco and Alex just got back from
Jamaica those students of videos are
there and this is similar stuff they
brought back
not bad credit no stuff my copy I'm
going to show that later a bit there we
are
tell me about it so this is a old tavern
Blue Mountain coffee so Blue Mountain
coffee is among the most rare and
expensive coffees in the world because
it has really restricted supplies and
only five estates that can make it in a
small area and all like hand-picked
those on terraces hmm oh yeah I didn't
know other flavors oh well it's mostly
its popular because it's really well
found when they're not like any
bitterness yeah it's not too much either
one way or the other it's just like a
very mild and clean and yeah it's pretty
good all right guys we are heading out
to dinner with will in Arden we haven't
seen him yet
who's arrived you managed to convince
them to make us some vegan pizza it took
a lot of convincing but and hey how is
it bro if what we're nodding back look
like a breakout and RiRi's proudly
showing off her lung board again yeah
it's author than that it's crazy to
write say it's crazy to write it's so
like well as usual it's been an awesome
day it's been a very meaningful day to
me and Maya and picked out a long boards
I think this is going to mark the
beginning of a new era of yeah just been
able to do stuff together I think for me
I've been into kind of staying around at
various skateboards penny boards along
boards for a while now and I think this
is the scarf of rice I hopefully will be
able to do some fun skating this week
and I will say I'm very tempted to try
an older ones electric bikes Jesse had
but we'll see we'll see about that
anyway catch in the morning peace out
enjoy your life live the adventure
