Skype call with Steve he's in Scotland

chilling with friends and Skype catching
up some stuff since I've been away the
last few days and I think it's time for
a late lunch apparently my dad cooks
some kind of wack I'm on the start of
things I'm gonna reheat hey now let's go

mando so you're gonna go down and get a
whole drink and maybe paddle in the
river

managing to fight it caffeine addiction

good like more energy I'm not having
these horrible dips in the day like it's

I do like I've had some decaf companies
but what are you go there dusty that's
good is it tasty it's so crazy coming
out of an air-conditioned Casta in
England and then outside like boiling
hot such a weird sensation that's so
lovely this is the rhythm of our local
River
when I was a bit younger we used to
slide down here
beause when the river was a bit higher
so like it was more flowing like that
like or everywhere we are going for a
paddle

deep and fast current
