Oh one day the d hey my breath darling
know how things you wanna go he's
finally awake has like seven hours sleep
on this bed here I feel very very rested
while he's sleeping with Lisa great
progress
and your holy days the ladder beam ugly
legend was the life a lie this is a big
big big ring
as an issue - music for niggas
activities or the wonder bug that
studies that mean
we're done 600 over there
how many Italians are we doing like this
about
we're about ten to the way down
my
oK we've realized it's pretty shaky on
the bus they would go out of hand in the
right
he's more cultural line this way to meet
my son I know fun fun oh hey yes brought
to bear on this of the three guys he's
bringing them all bananas hey this is
quite cool dried by banana drop it
okay recite similar to breakfast we're
going to have to do a u-turn and this
it's like the most difficult record
season in the world it's ridiculously
long
yes bro
we've left the bus in like the most
illegal parking spot ever literally just
on the road but it's right next to
Chile's where we can keep an eye on it
making some fresh guac okay
we like the samovar friend far
see all around I just a longer threads
some Evans has ever driven up guys check
this out it's just a just happen
whoa nice serious it being a very long
drive today Sam has been taking one for
the team in Ireland which is an Ikea
in unison hand up I like to drive
through the day you get to like see this
big
durability removes makeup today I think
I'm
in a box like this every time we go
Krispy bar the boys in the back of the
bag gives the room suitable us
yeah it's been a real drive and it's
super hot - my life has been overheating
they've also been what I'm rendering I'm
just putting in the freezer here
than these boys Judith has been chilling
out on the bed - imagine what's on that
I can't tell you how much AeroGarden
last former prom on over there
the boys it is mounting a GoPro and a
360 camera on the front of the bus
Oh
what's going down right now bro
we're destroy evidence to submit
initially is romantic
such a couple of lads it's a couple of
lads from the area of the corn as well
we literally drove through a storm of
fly eyes it'll wet I think he squared
through the home but bro literally it
was like a cloud of flies for like miles
and it was just like splatting again for
instance haha also the road conditions
here are so bad that we may have broke
bit from the bus we're just looking at
the damage now basically there just be
massive dip from the road and also speed
bumps that have no warning so we like
him the whole and it because the whole
back end sticks out this far it's the
leverage of the you know here's the the
pivot point here's but the whole thing's
bouncing that's why we like flying out
of the bed when we're laying in there so
I think some of the battery systems kind
of like falling apart in the back so
we're going to try and try and fix it oh
wow okay so some of the cables are
pulled out the battery terminal this
whole shelf fell down yeah yes
whilst JPS fixing the battery I'm gonna
have a quick look at the headlight
because we only have full beam the left
headlight still broken yesterday yeah
yeah yeah yeah I think it is I think
he's right I think it could just be the
connector
hey no luck with the headlight I think
we got to buy another Pole bro we're
gonna have to get another headlight unit
I love this repairing on the go cool so
we're going to talk up here finish
repairs and we're going to try and find
something to eat
hopefully there's a little cafe or
restaurant nearby we're kind of in
unknown territory right now we don't
really know what's dangerous whether two
stops turn places a lot of people
advised us not to even drive at
nighttime but reading these roads
relatively safe one of the big problem
is that my friend Beto has basically had
a last-minute emergency and having them
join us I was thinking we'd be able to
meet up with him today to continue with
him joining us but I haven't even to get
through to him and I guess we're just
going to have to keep going without
someone helping max know some sort of a
limited Spanish but other than that we
don't really know much about the areas
and it would be good to get local locals
advice at this stage but you know we
just got to make
we're still here guys no success finding
food other than hot noodles noodles
they've got hot water easy so we can
just fill up yes before that's right I'm
calm I've got mine I brought some for
tomorrow from the bus to it traditional
Mexican feast
I've just finished two or three hour
driving
3 a.m. we are well on our way to Mexico
City now originally we were going to go
all the way 50 we were going to kind of
kind of go around the edge and head on
up I think we're going to stop now
mostly company for the day and maybe
free ourselves a night in a hotel or a
nice freshen up and get ready for the
next leg of the journey up to the state
but the bus is holding up well and yeah
this is this is all from guys I can't
say enough I'm really really enjoying
this
bring about Marie
anyway I'm going to get some sleep I'll
cut from the morning myself enjoy life
thank God
