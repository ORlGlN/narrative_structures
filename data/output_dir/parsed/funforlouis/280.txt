good afternoon guys it is Christmas Eve
and I haven't got all my presents as I'd
predicted I've left at the last minute
so I've ways down through Kingston to
see if I can get a few things to my
family and then I'm gonna wrap up when I
get home under the Christmas tree the
first place I'm stuffing is Jessup's
because I'm gonna get to make my little
sister dasty right I'm gonna get Darcy a
lens that she's been wanting a
wide-angle lens I just realized the boar
I head to the next shot local hero is
right next to Jessica so I have to get
cheeky little company fest so I've got
my coffee and smoothie and a soup to go
feeling very productive right now
why I'm in Currys now 20 some other
gifts I think I found the thing I need
it's like a little Bluetooth speaker
it's not that little edge yes it's quite
big
so the next gift I need to get is for my
grandpa and he was like a big
mountaineering kind of guy so I found an
outdoorsy shop and how though he doesn't
do anymore
I might get him something cool like some
socks doesn't think guys I just found
the perfect gift
my sister Hilary nail style studio she's
always very trendy and wearing funky
clothes and stuff so I think she's going
to rock this she didn't paint her own
nails because also she's gonna have a
lot of time on our hands like sitting
around being pregnant and stuff so okay
absolute win Zara what's in my videos
and she's offered to gift-wrap well they
offered to gift wrap your gifts anyway
but I've also got a few other things I
need gift wrap and that means I don't
need to worry about like doing a really
bad job reference which I definitely
with your pray what's the what's the
trick to making it looks they need you
taught how to wrap presents a nice to
learn I'll have to learn from you
it helps when it's like a square okay
there's everything the buckets of
amazing
I am so happy guys brilliant look
everything's wrapped this is so good
look at this dog that I just found so
cute
truly weird today are though everyone's
rushing around to get their last-minute
shopping it's a really nice vibe like
I'm just feeling super happy like just
you know Christmas spirit is in the air
funny good mate even though it's
freezing
guys I think I've done all my Christmas
shopping all of it
I even got myself a little thing of P
protein because you know vegan life
stuff sometimes I don't know what we're
having for Christmas dinner tomorrow I'm
gonna piping on at least get some
Brussels sprouts potatoes I'm so
impressed with those kids busking guys
you're watching good job it's not often
that he to take initiative nowadays for
like you know that I feel like it's
quite entrepreneurial like going out and
like they were making money in the world
I'm like everyone watching is like
taking dollar doing that young kids
getting out there and like finding ways
to hustle
that's going to cool and apparently like
in Kingston even just you can just bust
cool you like you down 4x4 license like
in London you just come and go inside I
like you I just have one more stop off
now is to go back to pick up the speaker
that I bought because it was actually
too big to carry around and carry about
to the car so I left it behind the
counter on the drive up and carry to the
car and then we're done
Christmas shopping done I think that's
the easiest Christmas shopping to have
done a little bit nervous because I
don't feel like a very good at to the
gifts but my mom helped me a little bit
yes
quite relieved
so it started roughly my first present
this is the biggest one but I just have
to get it wrapped before anyone saw
I finished wrapping it so cool I managed
to do risk okay let's bring some of
these unable tray right I've got a
question for you guys what's your family
tradition with Christmas presents do you
just put them under the tree like
whenever when if you've rather than or
do you wait til the last minute and then
hide them under there pretend Santa did
it I've always just put under the tree
because this is shocking but I didn't go
off leaving some jewel right time to sit
down for dinner
my uncle Tim has joined us today this is
looking very yummy we're watching planet
Earth this is the third episode of watch
it's about jungles
I want to show you something guys this
is something when mom made the other day
- gingerbread house check this out what
do you think Sam it's pretty good in
there
you made like glazed windows I guess
we're gonna eat some of this tomorrow I
like it why I want to put a light inside
i'ma see what it's like with like lit
out from the windows yeah it's so cool
it must be sugar like food coloring of
sugar
have you seen these windows that that
mom made in the gingerbread house anyway
if you want to see how my mom made that
she made a video on her channel so I
will link that below you check it out
it's pretty cool do you remember when
you were a kid and the night before
Christmas was so exciting you could
barely sleep that's not exactly how I
feel all right now um yeah I feel like
growing up you kind of lose a bit of
that magic in your life I'm still
excited that it's Christmas tomorrow and
stuff but I feel like when I was a kid
it was just just
uncontainable and it was so magic even
though I didn't grow up kind of
necessarily believing in Santa Claus I
still felt the magic of Christmas and
yeah I don't know it's kind of sad that
as you age you I don't know become
cynical and you kind of lose that for
whatever reason it is Society or you
know just the way you think the way
you're taught I guess grow up I think
it's important to protect that magic and
they seem important to continue to see
magic in the world but I don't know how
to do that
I think there's some ways to do it but
I'd love to know from you guys how you
protect kind of the magic in your lives
like how do you continue seeing the
world met in a magical way yeah let me
know and if you are still a kid and it
is it'll still magical for you protect
that don't learn you and Rob that magic
away from me yeah there'll be lots of
things in life that will try and stop
that but just remember as you're growing
up keep seeing things in a magical way I
think that's so important mm-hmm anyway
that wasn't supposed to be negative I am
very excited for Christmas and yeah
tomorrow we're just having a family day
in I think my grandpa's coming over at
lunchtime and my uncle and Aunty are
coming over for dinner
there'll be lots of eating and watching
movies and Christmasy things and
actually it's already gone past midnight
so it's already Christmas Merry
Christmas guys wherever in the world you
are I hope you're having a lovely day
and hopefully are getting to spend it
with family that's one of the most
important things for Christmas most
important things about Christmas for me
anyway I will see you guys in the
morning
and I cannot wait to give presents to
people and just yeah just have a great
Christmas peace out enjoy life
