answer Hey
oh sorry oh sorry sorry go okay bitch he
cannot bring him anywhere to be being
present and being able to stay pregnant
is something I've been just wanted
practice because which is that building
a lot you will be very focused on the
camera what we're doing and looking at
the screen and I the risk is you don't
feel like there so I just found over the
years like the color wickedness
my body where I don't think about it
I'll get rid of the day on my generally
can't remember building it guys we have
a great panel just mean a few people a
few words
check this out to live the adventure
logo tattooed your dis is right your
friends this is so cool I can't believe
it yeah I love it
where did you get them done right that
was a lot of fun being Laura have to
without an apple to like drop off for
left are yeah and then we're coming back
to the like main convention hall where I
haven't even checked out yet but I'm
going to the havok stands well the BVI
stand talk about me traveling with
maverick and the phantom drone and yeah
hopefully you get to share with a few
people but it's like using a drone to be
fun
oh I think appear I think this is their
yeah I think people is doing having a
good big one it seems really hectic
nobody here does very little fun of it
all it's my first time in a convention
business though it's like many guys when
you've got a fighting machine and until
I'm trampled by the technology other
than you I killed it as well like a
complicated right
we have no idea you're flying around me
it just it just a completely different
perspective when I was in Kenya earlier
in the year I went to visit that type of
example require a yard and I thought are
they could be really fun opportunity to
penetrate America and get into sort of
the village and the people there I mean
that's that thing be a bizarre modern
world but equipped they're pretty
primitive leader to third goes the you
know the night to unite celebrated
doctor the members of a driver for I'm
sending it up the up and nail down
and so these are these kid like the
perspective of their village that has
grown up and and even the elders of the
village show you this perspective their
home that they've never been before that
yours is pretty often is this excitement
and for me it's more like but what
you're able to do there no impact
I can see a lot of that problem have
been able to calculate the moment I
would never be without everything right
dr. Dominic yes sure I was always having
trouble getting the best shot having to
climb onto a tree just to shoot it from
the volatile would have looked like
ripping my eyes or getting hurt but I
was doing it for the job and then after
a while from folks like picking up on
drone everyone starts doing tone getting
the chance way better into the V
swimming in the trading house experience

mean big country it was just this Tommy
would like it was really intimate like
there wasn't like I said there was a lot
of people now I don't have to watch the
vlogs to back to January but for me it's
so heartwarming to hear like real true

sensitive guy because he created a
subnetwork like the sub with the
adventures like friends yeah and we were
