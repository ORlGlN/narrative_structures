microphone
it's like Anna padded square we just
shut down the audience right I just pop
back up to the room we had a very cool
panel and I'm trying to plan a cool
travel one for VidCon this year guys so
if you've got any ideas of what you
would want to see in a kind of travel
adventure YouTube panel at VidCon let me
know below because we're trying to plan
it now and also we've got a few spots
available for guests to have on the
panel so let me know who you'd like to
have on the panel yeah and what kind of
topics we should cover and what would
like throw in a big audience because
yeah we want to do something there
people want to engage with and yeah let
me know the like we're trying to make
our way to the pool and a lot of cool
people around what these dudes and yeah
I'm looking what's getting up to like
jumping in the hot tub and you know a
little bit of them even though it's a
warm day
I don't think I've been to this one
before is that of rat is it chinchilla
what is this it's not dead but he looks
injured
so you carving up in here you can't be
nothing here bro whoa limping oh no he's
definitely hurt all right it's hot tough
time we're just hoping mr. rats okay
he's chillin under there somewhere we'll
keep an eye on him and then oh why so
chilled
my theory is maybe he's been poisoned
unfortunately where we had a nice little
hot tub session we're going for a little
stroll around the hotel ground this
sounds a little late it's looks so
beautiful
I'm pretty convinced as alligators in
there yeah we're in Florida just ducked
out of the Convention and I just met up
with Jeff he's also here playlist live
and this is his coach check mr. coach
out and he's invited me to come and have
a little a little tour
all right guys hey great thanks for
coming to my place yeah this looks
amazing
little little incredible it's not like a
record I could afford the big one huh
this is like the most luxury bus I've
seen in a long time this is like way
better than the bus the Duggar guide
check out a TV
yeah it's not on right now but yeah so
it's 45 feet and also happens to be
45,000 pounds we have a range of about
1,200 miles so it holds 250 gallons of
fuel Wow is that like an edition it did
like got an additional fuel tank for
that they just built like that no it's
just felt like that's in the factory
this was not converted from a passenger
bus this was born into life like you see
it Wow okay so they start off with a
chassis that is bare bones and another
company's had all the systems so we're
going to microwave everything is
basically alcohol the size the household
fridge are not an RV refrigerator yes
automatic icemaker lots of presents and
social I have a powerful generator to
power it I think it's got a twenty
thousand kilowatt generator so you can
have everything going at once whoa or if
you want and I serious power also got a
cord where I can run another coach if I
study up or something yeah all right and
you got like water tanks all the taps
run and stuff is it uh-huh
yep this is a you guys two different
tanks one is one holds what's called the
grey water yeah and the other one holds
the toilet or the flat water okay and
this is a kind of a bad way to space air
I never really liked those visitors oh I
made this shower is incredible this is
like nicer than most hotel showers I've
got it got a little remote thing Wow
and all that stuff I love that it's like
lit with the LEDs and myself and I got a
filter from around the window and I like
it I don't have to go to the laundromat
you got you know in why you say in the
UK skiddy what got a washer and dryer
okay that big is the thing that's like
the line I've never seen that in a
vehicle before it is full-size dryer
yeah there's the toilet blue or the
Handy a okay oh my gosh this is this is
incredible do you love living on it I do
I would like to convince everyone to do
it yeah everywhere whenever I go
somewhere I don't ever have to worry
about leaving anything behind all of my
stuff is always with me so therefore
where I can wing it I'm a little bit of
a of a nomad yeah I don't know if any of
you guys live on a vehicle but I relate
massively like I always feel I don't
know there's something about sleeping on
a bus and having all your belongings and
your homies and wheels so it's like the
feeling of absolute freedom so yeah yeah
yeah I relate their relatedness to say
oh it's only I ain't brought this here
and stayed longer yeah I didn't bring my
bathing suit I don't have my tuxedo and
I walk outside and you poke this is a
large walk-in closet lalala they call it
a walk-in closet so it's included of my
my super bad temper suit I like it I
wore inside the conference a little bit
wasn't anything that is great with a TV
in here these are the electronics just
you know had an old-style TV ok reliable
to this is like I said guys this is the
best I've ever seen and we were just
chatting and Jeff is starting a YouTube
channel he's already got a channel but
we were talking about like what kind of
content could he make on the bus and
what do you think he should be doing on
the channel like what would be
interesting for you guys to watch if he
was like touring around I'm trying to
convince them to head over to California
for VidCon next month and yeah like what
kind of like cool collab videos can you
do with youtubers let us know in the
comments below
he'll be like responding to you guys and
I'll Kip here and we can you know be
good just to figure out like what could
he be doing with this epic bus he's got
yeah we don't want to do anything that
limousines are already doing so any
suggestions like bachelor parties or
weddings or guys nights out any of that
stuff is non creative we're trying to do
something innovative and out-of-the-box
like an adventure tour bicycling yeah
idea like a Mystery Machine thing where
people don't know what they're doing
until they get on the couch with us or
something really highly creative and
interesting that we can continue doing
over and over again yeah but don't be
fooled by the luxury like we could be
doing anything on this bus so yeah just
suggestions are welcome and you'll be
seeing Jeff from the channel next month
when he hopefully goes over to
California yeah most called the content
coach there's nothing you're not going
to find anything there but if you look
for me on the content codes or content
codes one of the other I'll link it or
below anyways yeah to go you can also
message me there if you have something
more substantial and elaborate we'd like
a dialogue about I'd love to hear from
ya yeah thanks for the tour Jeff just in
case you didn't see when we walked in
but look at there
the rest of the babies are taken out
whispers yeah this is just incredible I
love the chrome finish it's almost like
one of those Airstream trailer colors
boy that's what I like about it yeah I
like how like they make another one
that's all painted but I like the shiny
chrome yeah well there you go guys
as inspiring we're about to go out for
dinner it's been editing in the room
rice been having a little nap so we just
notice this crazy party going on down at
the pool I can't believe we missed out
it's like the most epic pool boy right
now it's just jack Evan we're eating us
any haunted like oh this is our chef
Rafi he's going to do some acrobatics
every tonight
I think am I ever going the cooking bit
is the kind of cooking I'd enjoy very
like the cooking mix with a martial art
guys I got some vegetable sushi as well
along with my noodles we're just
observing out in heaven sitting in the
most bizarre fashion luckily with one
leg what is going on is the normal
thickness how do you how do you like
Bend like that I want to show you
something more like this isn't already
break ass down no now if you look at my
knee look it's going through my right
foot is not now walk so this is actually
not helpful for me because my right knee
is now doing that so I have to go shoot
and so that's how I can stay calm in my
life all right or left now he's an all
right I can just go straight to bed
