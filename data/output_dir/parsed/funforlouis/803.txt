hi guys we are from Singapore and you're
watching fun fun Louis so today guys we
are heading out on a little an adventure
Cape Town me and Rachel are quite early
we were going to go up Table Mountain
but it was too windy the cable car was
closed so we just went out for coffee
and had a nice chat and now it's kind of
lunchtime I think
we've arrived at this cool little cafe
and I've got some kind of Bolognese
linguini vibe thing and Jessie's got
some tomato soup I'm snapping snap peas
and this is a tomato breeding
a whole rage you're gonna love it in
here
Rachel's gonna read me this kids book
apparent it's relevant to my life once
there was a boy and one day as he was
putting these things back in the
cupboard
I found an airplane suddenly the plane
fluttered it ran out of petrol
nobody does he put petrol in the plane
probably now the boy was stuck on the
moon this is not based on factual he was
all around and consumed his torch beside
it around this time of record lows the
boy began to climb and the Martian began
to pull and soon the boy is back after a
long night they were both finally off
the moon the boy went one way and
emotionally like a mirror
it's like how you meet all your friends
around the world I like the cute hippie
vibes in this area can I come
does the quirky little random shots like
vintage things and little knickknacks
great to support a little ring shows
your ring rate
yeah tell me what are you doing I mean
we hope today I don't know what it's not
even that cold that's like I'm freezing
so yourself a little blanket he looks so
cool
great tired I'm pretty tired too to be
honest that's where we were gonna go up
to date but look how cloudy it is we
wouldn't see nothing next time right
next time we can go up the mountain
we've arrived at this wine tasting place
like a vineyard and you guys know I
don't drink
but these girls want to taste the wine
so I thought you know this is Rich's
first time in Cape Town and this is
something they're famous for if it would
be nice to come down there and then
experience this whole thing I think we
found just kind of sitting with them and
this is cool it's like a really swanky
vibe you know
this is swanky
Ben has arrived and he's having to catch
up with the girls with his wine 56k
pretty glad for that one yeah this
little sip yeah being Louise PA is hard

never stops working

but we need to head off we're going Ben

plans coming up you're gonna have to go
over to Ben's log and actually find out
what those plans are although we didn't
we didn't tell it so much but yes

for a swanky meal in celebration of
Angie's birthday which is on Sunday and
my birthday which is like a week and a

intense looking forward to it and
another note what do you think of my
beard it's kind of getting there
