it is an incredible day here in Cape
Town so we've decided to come down to
Kirsten Bosch the gardens have a little
wonder around I think Ryan's gonna love
it here first stop and then they're all
drink at the cafe before it closes
riah got a chi latte and we were very
confused by this hot milk and then the
chai came all right that blew your head
that's my favorite thing and the spots
it's way more chilled here than it's
been in the past when I visited I think
because it's a weekday and it's like
late afternoon is that really no one
here you like this right yeah that's
great I think well doing to take that
picture okay
where the elves
where's guys lift all the bees there is
so many bees in that flower tell me is
what we're gonna walk into a spider
where'd you find Louie I've got a
swinging tree look at all these branches
would have been blue did they smell like
maybe they're honeysuckle
it's no quite nice guys look all the
flowers and wires hair you should keep
them in there well we're leaving Kirsten
boss there's a brief little trip so me
and Roy are rushing down to see me catch
the sunset
at C point which is like the front near
the waterfront like round the around the
coast a little bit see it the other side
of Signal Hill there but we need to get
round that corner before the Sun
completely drops did we miss it
guys can you see the Sun oh my gosh we
just painted it we just made it for like
what I'm just looking this up here oh my
gosh okay wait maybe spinning a little
you eat uh-huh
look guys the Sun is set by we kind of
made it
it's a seaweed it's probably that whoa
that's is that all seaweed
died
although we missed the sunset I would
say this is one of the coolest places to
come down to as the Sun setting I know
right now there's a weird amount of
seaweed so it's a little bit smelly but
it's pretty awesome view
I'm going to undetermined to get a good
sunset whilst we're here because the
last one we attempted like it got really
cloudy but apparently this weekend the
way that's going to be
guys check this out there's like 30 guys
just sitting the top of that lorry
that's the way to travel
I'm sure they've all got seatbelts yes
boys we are having a movie night
we just got takeout Kauai I'm ready for
this what were you watching Maya okay
well before I head to bed I wanted to
include some of the answers that you
guys gave to my question from last week
which was where do you find your
inspiration I find my inspiration and my
family and in music I find my
inspiration from my grandfather who is a
retired squadron leader in the Indian
Air Force surely for his discipline I
get inspiration from watching people
doing what they love in youtubers Bob
Marley I find inspiration in the Bible
what inspires me in life is the music
that I write and play the people around
me and the places that I travel to I get
my inspiration from my family and my
friend
I think the inspiration from failure I
get my inspiration from people who never
give up people who never take no for an
answer
guys thanks for sending those in this is
a way for me to include you guys into my
videos more and learn a bit about you
and I've been wanting to find ways to do
that for a while so I think this is
working well I'm going to leave you with
a question for this week which is a bit
of a deep one
but it's what do you love about yourself
not in an arrogant way but just a
genuine like what do you like about who
you are maybe you struggle with stuff
self-esteem maybe
some things you don't like about
yourself but my question is what do you
like what do you love about yourself say
send those in I've left the email below
and we'll hear from people next week
that'd be cool
all right I'm heading to bed I've only
got a couple more days in Cape Town and
then I'll let you know where I'm off to
my next adventure peace now enjoy life
and live the adventure boom
