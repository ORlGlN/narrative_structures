my name is Cyrus I'm from Sweden I'm in
old Kyoto and now I'm in Italy and
you're watching fun for Louie
and John good afternoon guys we have
just finished lunch we're in LA and
we're feeling a little bit miserable the
weather's been really strange the last
few weeks cold rainy and as you know me
and Raya are addicted to sunshine aren't
we yes and we are we're needing to
escape we need to go and find somewhere
warm and sunny ASAP so today's vlog is
sponsored by The Weather Channel app
they're going to help us find somewhere
warm and escape the cold and this is the
world's most downloaded weather app so
honest tradesman's features are pretty
cool right firstly it is 16 degrees and
cloudy in Venice right now we have an
idea that maybe Palm Springs be a cool
place to check out then 24 degrees that
is what I'm talking about
also on the apps it's pretty cool you
can see the sunrise and sunset time I'm
not so interested on dies but we should
be able to get there for the for the
sunset so we'll get there for Golden
Hour we leave now so on the way back
from San Francisco the other night we
actually were driving into a storm that
would sit in California at the time and
my friends are even like texting us to
see we were okay because all over news
but I was getting real-time alert on the
Weather Channel app to my phone warning
us about significant weather changes and
yeah it's helping us avoid like there's
like flash floods and there's a sinkhole
that happened to that sort of allows
cause Spelling's and stuff
yeah so you can click this alert button
in the corner and yeah just take any
alert you can choose to be notified
about different things that it is like a
government issued alert about hi Seth
pollen and there's like a rainstorm
coming another time this would have been
very handy was actually in Slovenia I
don't know if you guys remember when we
were driving in that snowstorm and we
got stuck in the mountain and had to
turn around and then I gave that back up
again just hit the road you ready you
ready for sunshiny anyone I got my
dresses I always find it so amazing that
can be rainy and cloudy one part of
California and then you can describe a
kind of hours and where else and it's
like totally different climate
all right thoughtful for a quick coffee
profuse then chill fuel for road trip
trying to give the wonder bug its fuel
see is thirsty she is a thirsty vehicle
guide she drinks a lot we've got about
an hour and a half left to get to Palm
Springs I can see there's like a bit of
mountain Ranger which you see the Sun
beyond that but it's like super stormy
cloud this ciders I guess we're in a
valley or something I don't really know
but yeah excited to get the warm weather
I guess that's why it's so much warmer
in Palm Springs as well cause it's like
I'm getting it in a different and that
was like stuff yeah there is the code is
even amazing how much colder it is in
Venice we head to Central LA I was just
saying to Raya it's so interesting like
our shared passion for sunshine because
that is actually the reason we met
originally it was I don't know if you
remember but I was in Brazil with my dad
and mr. Darcy and the I was in Rio I
think maybe they were different people
friends and I was in Rio and I was due
to fly to New York a few days later but
ended up and I'm just going to get a
connection to one straight of the UK and
then I ended up looking at the weather
forecast being that it was raining the
entire time in Rio so when a line
changed my flight New York here I come
so I pleased with that New York Aikido
girlie and that Kennedy came and stayed
with me Lily so basically if it hadn't
rained that weekend
me you've never met an I'm so mad hazy
and under the you guys how they like
situations in your life but it's like
little decision or little things
affected a massive change of direction
in your life I always think about it's
like so mad and I think thousand years
and why we clicked because from the
beginning we were both like really like
imagine if I like cold places there's no
way that we could stay there is no way
so guys if you want to catch an early
flight because the weather is bad then
maybe you'll meet the love of your life
guys check out the clouds behind us he's
just finished and now it's blue gone
yeah we've been waiting for
guys we've arrived in Palm Springs Oh
beautiful oh my god we could be palm
trees it's like the cops ended we had
seven paradise we managed to make it is
a golden hour and we need to find
somewhere to hang out now I don't think
we've got long before the Sun gets on
the mountains up it is war if I'm wrong
within that
guys we have arrived so nice to be here
we're going to go check in drop our bags
off and yet then finding fun today
because we're staying tonight and
there's a hot tub and it closes at 11:00
p.m. also those coming in I spotted some
bike for the guests if view so rise
going to jump on a bike and we're going
to go for a little cruise make these
bikes out but ask if we can grab one so
we literally drop my bags off Rio just
got changing some some more appropriate
clothing and so we wanted to get out
before it gets dark
it's actually quite a cool way of like
discovering somewhere I've said it
before many times my blog but either
cycling or I get booted boarding around
you kind of you see more of a place you
wanted you noticing for like these
awesome card stick that Apple right
would you like a car like that so good
right the weather tomorrow is looking
pretty good
19 degrees there yeah
sunny zero chance of rain isn't it crazy
that we can predict the weather have
always found that math I just found out
this project that the same technology
that you predict turbulence on planes if
using the Weather Channel app to detect
whether pants
Ryan got my coffee heading to the hot
tub
they can't be twisted that one's perfect
this office ah so relaxing ready for
dinner yeah

climbing the ranks for me climbing the
rack being California yeah we found like
very lovely mix and local places in
Venice well it's been a great evening
and it's so good being over here in Palm
Springs thanks again to the Weather
Channel app for sponsoring today it's
just so good knowing that there's a
place so near LA and I can get away to
when the weather is bad or it's cold and
yeah I'm sure we'll be visiting here I
also want to go to check out Joshua Tree
that's nearby I want to get some cool
nighttime shots because it's like really
clear and there's not much light
pollution so I want to get some epic
kind of star photos that's another trip
