drinks maybe some snacks than I just
still trying to come up with a plan
got some tangerines got some bananas see
I've got some water so good today part
your time we've decided thoughts got way
too much pent-up energy being stuck in
the house so we're going to take you
through a walk and Kate's got less room
so this is perfect
actually the point I have a harness a
little kitty horn harness any other look
it in each so Peter don't even try this
is not cruel this is good fam I asked
the other day what would chill him out
and a lot of people were like outside
thoroughly enjoying the life outside is
this what you always dreamed of freedom
thought you were you eating girls
yeah it's stuck in the machine before
turns out taking a cat for a walk it's
very different from taking a dog from
door is very unsure about as well very
I'm sure anything so that's not a good
idea bro so you don't want to fall down
there bro
I do love being outside though
so I was back in from this walk how's
your walk thought how is your walk
