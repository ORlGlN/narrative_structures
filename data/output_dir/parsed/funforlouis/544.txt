actually got out the first time together
in the morning you are a morning person
he's the early bird doing a little pre
slope massage yeah

no Ben's winning again
guys this is the last runner today and
I've decided as it is the last unit
today I'm gonna ride down I'm doing a
360 video and this third person would go
ahead I don't think this is great just
for a single guy bro but this footage
they're just gonna wave down together
we're back down
guys I think I think the 360 could have
worked I think it's pretty good that's a
lot of fun riding down with the boys oh
I dare do that we're getting a little
squad photo before we go squadron yeah
guys I'm back on my broom we're about to
go for dinner I just want to show you
two things firstly I finally got some of
my own clothing I've been jet-setting
around the world and I haven't been able
to get much of this year and I just
opened the package which was sent and
I've got all of my a few sweaters and
some tank tops and stuff so I'm happy
secondly you know the 360 I filmed
earlier I've just ended to there spend a
couple of hours editing and look how
sick it's looking so this is just my 360
view I don't see anything right now
let's check it this is what we filmed to
this section out here and the guys are
following behind me check that out
so you know Dave's always coming up with
his harebrained wacky video ideas please
he's come up with one tonight
he wants to basically do a song cover
dancing around this hotel could be quite
laborious I think he's gonna be dancing
around in his dressing gown then you're
gonna film it right we're setting up for
the first shot Dave's gonna be jumping
out his bed
how do you do that I did not like it's
over for bits of free days I'm enjoying
this this has really made my evening
Dave is a complete nutcase seen four
complete now heading to scene five
look at this guy
it's a wrap yes I'm very pleased this
won't be my favorite video I've ever
done
when's he gonna be out tonight yeah okay
first yeah guys I'll link it top line
the description go check out and share
it with everyone we're gonna try to make
it go viral I think it's good but then
that was a very very unusual night but I
cannot wait to see the video that
they've they've editing here now he's
gonna drink coffee this is so unlike
Dave to stay up late and edit welcome to
my world Dave welcome to my world but
yeah this is the last night here for me
I'm flying out of Canada tomorrow I've
actually got a lot more stuff than I
started with I've got this
I wrote this third person rake I got all
my ski stuff and these extra clothes so
I am gonna be leaving here with an extra
full bag of luggage I think which is not
ideal but oh well I'll catch you guys in
the morning

adventure
