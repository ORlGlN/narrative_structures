other a7 s which I did something I

been very apologetic that I've been a
little bit clumsy this week the cameras

gonna put a floaty thing on it when I go
swimming so if you know even if I didn't
drop it or it'll float to the top I
won't get washed away by the waves or
even sent me a flowy handle it's great

slightly handle one then it won't it

of zombie state because yeah I'm jet
LAG's of other than the hour-and-a-half
sleep bed this morning I've been up for
24 hours now and then even then before

48 hours I've had 5 not up out of sleep
I'm pretty dead I don't even know that's
correct but it feels like that anyway
thanks for sleep now yeah it's good to
be back in the UK talked a lot today a
lot to catch up with I was hoping to go
and see the bus and chat to Mike about
how he's getting on with that but he's
insisted that I wait at the end of the
week because like he's excited to show
me it finished or like almost finished
and he doesn't mean to see it in a state
so I'm gonna respect his wishes and wait
to the end of the week even though I'm
super curious to how he's getting on but
I'm going to leave him to it leave he's
like a master at work so I'm just gonna
let him finish all the things he needs
to yeah and then we've got a big
Christmas party on the bus and the
weekend so it should be pretty fun right
