good morning guys it is the third full
day on the bus we did like a half day on
Friday I'm back here with the boys we've
got Dan joining us today he's coming to
help with some materials and yeah we are
against the clock a little bit we've
just been looking at the timetable and
yeah we've got to get a very efficient
battle plan in place today to make sure
that we get everything done so it's
exciting I like working against the club
right Mike's gonna rip out upstairs
then I gonna clear with this stuff that
I've left down on bottom deck so we can
start ripping out the seats and figuring
out how are we gonna do these water
tanks on the back which is gonna be a
mission I'm gonna give you a little
before tour so when we start ripping it
out and converting it you can remember
what it is like this is a bat I just
found this little porthole in a bit
we don't really know what this box is
but we're we're betting on it not being
that important because we can't see
anything coming out the outside of it
don't know you kept pets in there maybe
maybe some Pokemon in there
check this out guys this is this is not
strong enough to put a hot tub on at the
moment we've cleared out most of these
chairs we're gonna leave these in for
now this is the area and the back here
that we think I put the water tank so we
just need to see how vital this is
might actually have to see us now it
works
so this is the today's dilemma we need
to fit a lot of water back here maybe
like two and a half a thousand liters
which is our rough estimation right now
we might have to reduce that in order to
do that we need to fill out most this
back space at the bus we've got 500
liter tank in there I think maybe we can
fit another 500 liter tank under in this
footwell area I think we still need
access to this fire escape door
potentially but we can't block this
access because this all looks like
important wiring under here it is
lunchtime I'm actually leaving now
we're gonna get lunch together then I'm
gonna head into London for some meetings
lunch is served
let's first go to Jean sitting pretty
nice yeah yeah yeah thinking gas heated
Mike's making some business goes still a

top I'm in fantasy I actually used to
live in Battersea die so this kind of
weird being back here and I'm about to

Club to chill out maybe grab a little
coffee and meet with Laura who you may
