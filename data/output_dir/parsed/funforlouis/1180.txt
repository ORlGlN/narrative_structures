grill and then we can get this caption
and we've got like some friends come
over to help so hopefully it works
so do you think this one's big enough
yeah let's build of the Eiffel Tower
well when I think trowels I think like
when you're camping and you have to kind
of poo in the wilderness and you have to
dig a hole before you do it yeah what
would be your weapon of choice here oh
and it's don't be apocalypse stuck in
the zombie you don't wanna be slashing
blood because the blood carries the
disease
wait so you wouldn't go for a crowbar no
because this would pop them but what if
it's like what it's like Walking Dead
zombies and you have to you have to
penetrate their brain push them away and
then like give up a song wax yeah that's
a good that's a good you can get
distance to that yeah
what about close range man right here so
when he gets a little closer I think the
bat I think the spiky bit cuz then you
can switch Connie from the brain one
so you smash the brain open does it like
spray all over your face yeah like it
right got the wrench and we're ready to
roll the spanner Louise the spanner miss
Bella I don't think we kill many zombies

which is the the most basic futon but
this is this works perfectly you just
pull it out you just drop this down boom

blocks away we decide to escape with it
he's just gonna escape with a futon
let's see if it works have you ever
skated the food car before we're pretty
close by actually Louie I decide escape
into the road with the futon he's okay
he's done this before as a professional
