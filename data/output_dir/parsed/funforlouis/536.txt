we are leaving the curry today we're
heading to Nairobi most the team are
flying out this afternoon than a few of
us staying on for a few days we've got
like a four hour drive so mate everyone
ready for four hour drive
we just stopped for a toilet right guys
so what do you show you this this is
crazy apparently this is the hotel Julie
land hotel how is that hotel alright
I've just been dropped off we've arrived
in Nairobi we're gonna get some lunch
and we've also just found out that the
hotel that and these books it's in to
stay tonight is pretty horrific so
you need to change the plans
I'd quite like to find like just a
mid-level hotel doesn't need to be
spanked fever the reviews in this hotel
tonight was saying this blaring music of
3 a.m. good job and a good job and the
under the hotel booking where new Africa
got some pasta for lunch unlost lunch
together as a team I also think we've
found a replacement and found a
replacement hotel like that so Nairobi
he's notoriously a bit dangerous a bit
sketchy so that I think this parked our
car inside the cool thing to keep it
safe because it's called our bag stacked
on the top check this place out looks
like the UN who's that dude yes Bob I
just go go we jumped in some cabs and we
head into the hotel we've cooked a
slightly better one than and Ebert so I
think it's right
yeah listen to this review the hotel is
located in a dangerous part Nairobi you
cannot go into the street after 6pm I've
never felt so threatened I think we
found a hotel the first one we tried was
full but it turns out we're not in the
safest part of Nairobi but I think
that's part of the adventure isn't it
funny how upset I your power out yeah
yeah I probably should be flashings
camera I think a late at night on this
I'm gonna try and be a bit more subtle
and Barney can protect me I Andy's
managed to haggle him down deal it was
like 70 quid a night how much is it now
25 minutes I yeah for a room it's pretty
good good so we're heading out on the
town I've switched to the g7x it's a
little bit less obvious carrying this
around and I roby than my big camera

we've been having a great evening lots
of conversations deep conversations I've
been getting to know these guys a little
bit more I'm going to tell you who the
team is now which is this a little bit
smaller and it's difficult to introduce
it for home it was a massive team but
you've probably seen a lot of these guys
and some of the other videos like when
we went to Calais and other trips still
got nowand Barney he's gone no no
Bonnie's gone JP obviously Andy George
fryer but I just wanted to say a little
bit like this trip and he's the main guy
he's been organizing this for years and
he's been mentoring a lot of these other
guys that have come along and as well as
helping the kids here and like in
Romania when we've been over there these
trips are also very much about who's
coming along and the impact on their
lives and JP is just going to share a
little bit about his life and what stuff
was like for him years ago in like maybe
how stuffs transformed to him and the
night gonna share a little bit
Wednesday please uncle and 29 years old
grew up and suffer than house in the
state tryna saw the things that are
often happening to constitute about
Edwards my crime is over too far myself
following that cloth I enjoyed it while
it lasted um 2011 I was sentenced to
fire the opposing sentence for robbery
and firearms came out of prison well
whilst I was in prison I was trying to
make connections with people to do
better things better things up and then
I've done in the past so to my close
friends Jordan one who had been
introduced but doing great things went
to South Africa are doing that
missionary stuff working with people and
better in their lives and learning from
those people and I wanted a piece of it
so I came out and contacted the ones and
George they kind of put me on a path to
me Andy I met him a few times before but
didn't really know him yeah I tried to
go to Kenya in 2014 but probation put a
stop to that so that I was too high-risk
2015 I wanted to go as well but there
are some complications with also try and
now I'm here 2016 so I'm finished my
full prison sentence on my probation I'm
here now and can you have great guys
yeah just hoping to bit of my lives and
be a better people's lives over here and
there's a blessing to be around easier
there's a small social enterprise as
blossom and growing rapidly inra Hampton
which is under the umbrella of the
regenerate charity is called a silver
bakery so with Andy's little dreams has
been dreaming about the lemond feel good
bakery stranger world yeah but like JP
the other ones making a difference so no
thanks he's wicked Frankie so yeah I'm
being employed as a drive off for the
filter bakery but that's not necessarily
my main that's my main role but I still
kind of hands-on with making the
sandwiches and going out and doing some
pitching sales of what not
so for every sandwich that is sold a
percentage of the price goes into a
bucket that gets sent out to not a
physical bucket ago said no it goes into
a small we forgot the funky so yes o
mighty gets sent over into the free fat
free freedom programs have one in Nakuru
in Kenya one in Nairobi Kenya and one in
Romania it's nice to be involved as well
and it's nice to be in Kenya at the
moment because now I'm seeing the
sandwich that were making and all the
hard work that goes into it in the
kitchen and having handy on you and he's
gotta be sold it got me sold now I'm
seeing that in product of it so it's a
bit more it's kind of more touching more
heartwarming and to see the the droid us
on these young children's faces and let
them just young children people who
can't afford to eat to see the joy in
their face and to know that I'm a part
of that process of making someone happy
is really beneficial for myself it's
just a blessing to be a part of the team
really and yeah just good things for the
future have you on our team rankings
most of the things to each other but
there you go guys a little bit of an
insight into one person's life that's
been impacted it's hard to share these
stories sometimes because though we're
having all these conversations there's
so much going on behind the scenes but I
hope you guys are inspired and excited
about great things that happening here
and i'll link stuff below how you can
support the field of bakery if any of
you know like businesses around london
that need light regular sandwiches for
their companies and employees and
meetings or maybe your parents do please
get in touch on link everything below
but it will be supporting a brilliant
thing and tomorrow you watch the blog

that the young children in bad
situations here benefiting from the
stuff going on in London
