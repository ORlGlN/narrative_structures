you're watching bumper Louie
dude so after almost a six-hour flight
Dubai I've landed in Bangkok and I'm
pretty tired guys they slipped
for the second half of flight yeah yeah
I need a bit more sleep
it's very warm here it's like mid to
high thirties that's Mike humid
so this girl has come to collect me
and we're just going to go and find the
car
very nice
Philip out of it
continue to drink so Jim it's got like
winners
so I'm happy about my down exchange
thank you well I derived and I think I'm
going to sleep for a few hours
look at his cute little elephant towel
and my bed sleek lever Oh Ted Philip
alright the trick here is not sleep too
long I've got to meet everyone else in
the lobby at 6:00 I shouldn't sleep more
than like two hours really a big mistake
alright I've seen a bit well a slip well
and up now coming up the lobby we're
about to head out dinner meeting the
team yo it's Jamie Lee how you doing man
good before we head out for dinner we're
just having a little team meeting you
might recognize a few people here
Allie hey we just met each other yeah we
got connected button device well I'm
Gina hey Russell
and Jamie and Jesse and there's a bunch
of other people I'll introduce you to at
some stage basically everyone's a little
bit out of it today we have flown all
the corners of the globe to meet and I
think tomorrow is the initial like first
start day with all the cool activities
tonight the children we're finally
leaving this is a personal adventure
doubt so I'd probably have literally
just came from the airport got out a
taxi into the hotel slipped back out
it's now it's nighttime I wonder if this
will be different when I came here when
I was 18
I'm guessing it will go check out these
little streets down selling crazy bugs
deep fried tarantula frogs scorpions I
might have to come and try some of these
later on after dinner we have arrived at
the restaurant and I'm hungry guys I'm
super hungry
and I love Tyson services
before we ate I just got drink I ordered
some kind of coconut shake and it's come
out in a coconut that's crazy
can I get it much give this little taste
I also get it I also get
sorry Jamie's being very adventurous
tonight that is adventurous to me that
is a big dessert I don't eat
which I've got a green Thai curry and
I've asked her to be extra spicy let's
see how it is
that was delicious toy - I enjoyed that
we are now going for a little stroll for
your better hotel we're going tomorrow
we're visiting a temple and we have to
wear like long trousers so I'm going to
go and get some of those like loose
cotton trousers to wear is apparently
jeans would just be way too hot where
are we picking some out they look good
are they big enough
I think I've gone live on an arms dealer
and the Iraqi shadows I don't know I
want to go for a like something a bit
more chilled I might actually wear out
again though these are the travelers I
got guys just just simple brown cotton
one but we we had to be a fun I was
bartering more than she was asking for
she's getting really confused about it's
just like no like this and anyway but
it's so little money out here I posted a
point of bartering a lot because you're
only saving like a couple of pounds and
it's good to give to other countries
economies and I don't know I like
thinking that it's benefiting someone
someone running the store
you
turns off the bed night-night Jesse well
hopefully tomorrow guys I'll be a little
bit more with it I think tomorrow like I
said we're heading to a temple and then
we're doing a boat ride and we're gonna
have a bit of time off in the afternoon
but we can chat to some of the other
people on the trip some of the other
guys and yeah I'm just looking forward
to an incredible week with everyone it's
gonna be awesome all right I kept in the
morning bright and early
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
