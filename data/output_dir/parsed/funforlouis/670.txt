hi my name's Sarah I'm from London and
currently I'm in Venice and you're
watching bond for Louie boom good
morning guys today is Roy's birthday and
we've just rented a car and we're gonna
head into France from Barcelona we're
just gonna grab some snacks before we go
I always found the perfect snack place
whoa those are massive bananas
how's your birthday going so far
but where we are heading into the
mountains we come heading to the pair of
A's tickets the mountains like really
dry
mr. Weber rides in this beautiful little
town called Coolio and I suggested
yesterday that we come here this is the
place I came to every year my parents
there's a lot of memories here
guys the girls have gone in they are
swimming in the Mediterranean Sea but I
think me and Rio is gonna chill here
yeah plus sunshine is amazing somebody
thinks great
okay I've changed my mind I am going in
the sea it is gonna be cold but I think
there's just enough time to warm up
again before the Sun goes there so I'm
gonna jump in I'm gonna walk to the end
there and I'm hoping to film it in 360
is off this is awesome guys
I sometimes am afraid to go swimming in
Tonga but this is probably the warmest
the Mediterranean is oh yes September
it's been heating up for summer
refreshing you know that was pretty
incredible
I think it's time for a coffee now how
fun is that
I thank you
these streets is beautiful
we're still contemplating whether to try
and make up to one of the castles in
sunset do you think we'll make it if we
left now two fingers like what you wanna
do I don't care I'm okay on the streets
or if we can drive we've jumped back in
the car because we think we can make it
up to this castle at the top of this
mountain for sunset so
and see weapons I think we can do it I
think the control will touch this little
castle the lovely lady laughs into the
castle is closes in 15 minutes already
yeah Majan they close the drawbridge yes
we're going to explore around the castle
we made it in perfect time this is epic
look at the views from the top here
Louie would you rather work at that
castle as a guard or this castle is a
guard it depends if it was like during a
time of war by yourself alone I know
wait tell me I'll choose this guy looks
menacing Oh with no one to mess with
this guy no way
celebra okay I wouldn't mind living here
going to think we're gonna try and get
up to that castle over there we've
driven down a road which may have said
don't go down there no entry but I think
that's a suggestion rather than a brawl
we've gone anyway
this is so awesome yeah it's fine I'll
give you permission even during your
birthday Riya although I think we could
have driven it because we're on the
right stone this would have been a bit
scary go to the big Tower yes Tower yes
get some instagrams
please I can't watch this oh my god he's
literally like 100-foot cliff oh my gosh
please get down like you got a great no
stop please I'm not nothing anymore
we've arrived back in Kaleo after quite
an adventurous drive through the melons
and we are sitting out to dinner
you're a nice cat made a new friend
well I think it's about time we head
back to Spain way back to Barcelona
after an incredible day it was
everything I could have wished for it
was so nice to go back to Kali or my
childhood holiday destination and it was
so good to bring the girls and give Roya
an amazing birthday day out it was yeah
it was just wonderful and before I sign
out guys I thought would be really cool
as a little birthday present for riot
from you guys is if you headed over to a
channel subscribed shadows and love
she's making videos about her life she's
not doing daily but she's kind of doing
little weekly updates and she's doing a
lot of travel and they'll be coming
already I know she'd love it
and so I'd be really cool and I'd love
it too yeah
tomorrow we are heading to Romania to
help my friend Mike with the project
he's doing out there so that should be
pretty cool it's been a very random week
yeah as we blaze being so different
right I'll see in the morning peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure
