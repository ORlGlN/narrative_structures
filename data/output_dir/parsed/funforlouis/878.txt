and
my excited is botting very very tired
today and click site because I can't
remember the last moment to a new
country can you guys remember which blah
going to likes a brand new country it
has never been to Boise I don't think I
went to one last year
that's correct me if I'm wrong it's been
like a magical country but he was so far
from America
don't really know to expect it's
probably going to be way more normal
than I think it's in a bit I just got a
text to my phone saying there's no state
services available here at all I think
I've ever seen that when I flown into a
country look how many people there are
trying to get through immigration
I just been voice and hours at the last
updated you we're still standing in this
very long queue but you know it's
chilled children I'm pretty hungry again
and I could do with a copy that's my
update you got anything to update people
with Riya
you're just chillin you're still excited
right thought that we'd be at the front
by 20 past 7 and I said 7:40 but
realistically it's probably gonna be
more like 8 o'clock also rise pointed
out how are they still immigration
checking here immigration picking don't
think that's quite right it is 8 minutes
to 8 and we are still here welcome to
Cuba we especially three guys I need it
like two hours of stink tuned hours and
trying to find rice bag now because
they've got these bags lips that just
come off the luggage belt over the last
few hours no one's collected yet you
found it we've found the guy that's
picking us up then he's pretty happy
he's probably been waiting like this
home spotting oldies little sign out I'm
getting my first Cuban coffee I'm quite
excited I've heard they did good coffee
here
that is pretty nice pretty good coffee
with the right where we're staying
tonight and for the rest of the week is
this where we stay the whole time
it's in the old town of Havana I think
this is the coolest place spant is the
best place to be and we're going to just
drop a bags in and go up to the food
they find some food oh yeah I might need
that hey that's my phone in the car
thank you so where we're staying is
someone's house that opened up as a
guest house so I guess they host people
to stay here this is quite common in
Cuba in Havana which is where we are
this is pretty cool this is pretty cool
she's just giving us a lowdown on the
area and what there is here and she's
speaking all in Spanish luckily right
speaking Spanish I cannot speak a word
of Spanish I can say thank you that's
not it
and please I'm gonna try to learn some
this week this is the main street with
the restaurant tip and it seems to be a
lot of live music like every block
there's like another band or something
going on so we're going to go and
investigate
the sounds for yoga
right first meal in Cuba chicken and
rice and some veg and some crisps so
it's pretty cool
you
this is a legitimate taxi just chillin
retro taxi as on on the Bevin mission
guys to try and find internet to get
some uploads done so we're going to do
some research we're at hotel we're going
to see what the Internet's like see if
it's doable not holding out much hope
well we went to a few hotels and we
asked about the internet here it's not
good news guys it's basically six
dollars the equivalent of six dollars an
hour for very very slow internet so I
could sit around for five or six hours a
day trying to desperately upload each
vlog I think that's not productive use
of my time considering we're in such a
beautiful country so I think the current
plan is that I'm just going to upload
when I get back no internet for the week
well that was a fun little excursion
around this particular area of Havana
and I think there's a lot more to
explore I'm really looking forward to
Dave arriving in a couple of days and
yeah just adventuring around Cuba it's
going to be it's gonna be awesome I
still can't quite grasp that I'm here
min Roy was saying we didn't feel like
this was actually real yet so probably
tomorrow when we wake up this will be
like whoa and I'm gonna get a lot of
sleep because I've been missing a lot of
sleep over playlists and I need to catch
up so I'll catch you guys tomorrow
peace out into a life and lit the
adventure
