good morning guys meanwhile up in this
beautiful forest in the cabin up near
Woodstock in New York which is an
incredible little hippie town which
we're about to head into to have a
little look around Breyers dad is
lending us the scooter switch we're
gonna head down it do is look I've made
friends with Sophie hey Sophie took a
little bit of a while to warm up to me
back when she cuddles up next to you at
night yeah yeah do this
first stop is Woodstock we're going to
an ice cream store I'm hoping they've
got vegan ice cream in that sorbet
cheers for this sorbet is perfect this
town is pretty perfect to be honest this
is like totally my vibes Woodstock with
a festival to happen then was it 1969
which triggered a peace and love
movement which is like had a massive
impact so there's that proper hippie
vibe here still a lot I could definitely
live here I could live here everything
gets so cold in the winters that's my
only problem we need to find someone
like this but in California near la ish
like an alpha male AIDS then you will
know anywhere
similar to this in California last night
Briah what's this pillar in the middle
of the square
oh I sleep you can support your language
yeah read it read out Nega for you buy
the Amiga who sit that and no does that
mean as a literal translation basically
that repeats rubella yeah
basically this whole town is just full
of like creatives and artists and
designers and writers and all of that
and the community that Ryan's mum lives
it is the oldest artists community in
America it's like it was like
establishes 1906 a 1902
pretty amazing look at this lamppost
someone's knitted her little Jersey for
it
right we're going on an adventure we're
gonna try and get down to this waterfall
down here
turns out this little walk was a little
bit trickier than we imagined to get
down to so I've just run down here got a
little cool shot I'm basically trying to
film a little clip for an Instagram
I think they call them sooner sinner
grams or cinema grams and they're
basically we're like a part of the image
is moving so long an experiment I'm
gonna try and post a photo with part
movement if it worked out I just figure
out how to get back up there now
I think I'm just gonna go straight up
but I tell me your favorite things about
Woodstock I think it's just survives
really like everything here is just so
calming and peaceful and happy and
loving like every store and every person
it's just it attracts those kinds of
people I think that's why you like it -
yeah yeah I want to spend a local time
there and see this store over here
this used to be Ryan's mom's jewelry
store
that's when she first moved to Woodstock
back on the ski-doo it
guys I've just stopped to show you this
sign this is what was talked about
earlier we're heading up to this
community that rides non lives earth to
this out bird cliff in this hill above
in 1902 RR Whitehead led to workers in
many arts and crafts to try and
experiment in utopian living how cool is
that
hey guys friendly um with Sophie
we are heading to this little hike I
think I might be a big high country it's
like two hours we have to drive to the
beginning event and Sophie's so excited
cause I found a mouse but don't jump
don't jump just chill guys check him out
hmm so cute needs to go back home now
you need to go back home
I remember stay in my hand back on the
floor you can go yeah bye
well it got quite warm walking up that
hill so I've just temporarily taken my
shelf we have arrived I think neither
are we near the summit yeah we near the
summit and these crazy abandoned hotel
is to sit near in the midst of forest
what is this
this place is insane
News gave up on mystery when was it
built
I actually saw this place and rise vlog
like ages ago we need to make a blog
about this like a year ago yeah
such a cool place and we got these
stairs
we got
so apparently there's a rattlesnake
around this area which means we can't
let Sophia felishj because otherwise she
could like disturb them and a
rattlesnake bite have been pretty deadly
for a dog that's why Ryan's carrying on
you join them enjoy a little break so
apparently the lookouts over there but I
think the sun's setting the opposite
direction so I'm gonna climb up this
cool lookout tower just watch the sunset
oh is it locked
we that was pretty spectacular
the guy's mind right now and thinks he's
looking out every the other side so
beautiful city
this is pretty epic
check this out
I think this is another requirement of
the forest that we buy is based on the
top of the mountain okay but just a
pretty epic view okay yeah maybe it
doesn't have to be quite as Fe right I
just pointed out some of these dates
1910 19 18 19 18
that is crazy who would have been
enjoying the views from here for like a
hundred years
English history well I mean not
thousands years but still this is a lot
of history for America how cute is this
look so we can fit inside and then it's
just like a little baby Carrie thing and
she's like a hot water bottle she keeps
you warm I keep her warm she keeps me
warm it's like a deal you like - my
favorite living creatures best friends I
love it Sophie you ready to go home we
just got back after a delicious meal
with rice parents I was pretty exhausted
off that hike but it was really nice
spending some time out in nature just
really nice been out here really this is
like simple living and nice to wind down
after this crazy month like I was saying

UK where we just go out into the
countryside and decently nice bear but
yeah it was nice just spent some time
with Raya today and bringing Sophie
along she's she's become a better friend
of mine which is nice it's a relief I
was a little bit worried when I was
heading up here but she wouldn't like me

anniversary of us starting today and
