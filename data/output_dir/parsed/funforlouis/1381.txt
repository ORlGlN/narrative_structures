we've gone down for some breakfast in
Chizik having a little break from
everything

work in progress reps sweatshirts

link it in the description he's got some
cool designs um but yeah we're done
sorry not by the way I'm speaking funny
because I'm eating a soother and I find
it very addictive
I've eaten a whole pack yesterday I
think it needs all day long
hello bye

for a week without the see him from wait
but he's gonna have an amazing time I'm
sure no beans for now oh really
no have an awesome time break guys have
got a confession
yesterday I had a second coffee and I
know I was trying to do one coffee a day
but I'm thinking okay I've rethought my
plan if I wean off coffee maybe doing to
coffee today to start with like one in
the morning one any late afternoon
evening and then I'll cut down some one
coffee today when when I can cope with
that so I'm having a second coffee today
as well and then maybe in the next few
days I can cut it down to one coffee no
a new Steve's actually a buddy dancer do
it man
dinnertime Cory take away Cory I
actually haven't had a really good
career since India ordered the vindaloo
I'm hoping it's spicy but
you've got some problems over there you
can join your chorus they put some
vindaloo pay vindaloo no cheesecake
movie time just had a proper chilled
evening as these see in watch movies I'm
still on my like chill time these last
couple of days still recovering it's
been cool it's been corn iron it Steve
yeah nice and chilled select Steve loved
you very so Steve's dropped me off I
thought why not take this opportunity to
have another little heart-to-heart with
you guys I don't always have this
opportunity because my days full of
activities or I'm doing things and
hanging out people and I just get to
show you guys like a bit of a montage of
what I'm doing and what I'm up to which
is which is fun but I don't always get
to you know chat on deeper level so and
this isn't particularly deep but it's
been on my mind a little bit obviously
I've been aware of the world around me
what's going on in the media and how
that affects people because now I've got
a bit of a platform and all you guys are
watching me watch my life and everything
I think others you know there's people
on much bigger platforms celebrities
that have loads of people watching them
and what they're doing and I've been
following this whole shenanigans with
Miley Cyrus and usually I don't get
sucked into celebrity gossip and all
this kind of stuff but it's got me
thinking a lot you know because I don't
know I I get what she's doing this whole
publicity stunt thing this really
raunchy photoshoot she's done all these
like controversial publicity things but
I
I think she's she's personally like
she's young like she's 20 but she's not
really thinking of the impact she's
having and I think this is where I'm
driven to think a lot about the impact
I'm having what other
people are having even youtubers or like
in her case like major celebrity I think
what she's communicating especially to
girls and a lot of you watching the
girls is one of that it's okay to just
be an object as a woman like a sex
object
she's objectifying herself massively and
I think she's pretty talented and has a
lot more to offer and I know this is
stuff that is people saying but I
genuinely worried that people watch
people like hone and and the way that
the media industry exploit women and
encourage that and I think even on a
subconscious level it does affect people
and how they view themselves and what
they deem is valuable and and how they
find some level of acceptance is through
their physical beauty or sexual sex
appeal or anything like that and I just
think the same there's so much deeper
stuff we have as human beings and our
character is very important and we need
to value who we are and build ourselves
and internally who we are and how we
treat people and how we interact with
the world and and that we care about
others and stuff and it's not about this
I don't know worshipping and glorifying
yourself and just looking at the game
you can get from the world and and I
guess playing the game like Miley is at
the moment and I don't know I'm not it's
not I'm gonna label this video like me
ranting about Miley it's not even that I
just think it's made me me think a lot
about the influence people have in the
world and and how you could use that
influence for good or bad so it's just I
don't know it just made me think a bit
and I don't know how to promote
especially for girls because I'm not a
girl I don't know how to promote kind of
a better message you know one of
one that's really going to give you
value and and not this shallow sense of
of just raunchy sex appeal I don't know
I'm right I'm kind of rambling now but
yeah I think just think about what the
media is telling you what people are
telling you and everything and just
question stuff you know there's some
advice question a lot of things I think
that's what I've done in my life
anyway I'm gonna leave you there and
catch you tomorrow
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure boom
