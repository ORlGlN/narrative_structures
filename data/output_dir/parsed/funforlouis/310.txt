Jerome's apparently in LA Hey

which is pretty crazy we've both been
traveling a lot I'm sure he's been doing
lots of amazing things I'm about to find
out what he's up to and what he's doing
in LA and hopefully we'll figure out a
way to see each other a bit more often
I'd like to I love to write is there

I think it's been more than a year
yeah yeah so me and Ron have been
catching up for lost our hook up some
food and now we're going somewhere but
he hasn't told me where where we're
going again so have you heard of
cryotherapy before night it's like a
shark anything it's like a route around
your body yeah and you the temperature
goes down to three and minus 300 degrees
Fahrenheit three minutes
no it's dry dry air it's dry nitrogen
whatever I don't not share the other
thing bright but it's really good for
your joint and for your don't you get
hypothermia no because it's only three
minutes it's really good for you really
so we're gonna go yes this sounds like
an absolute nightmare you know how much
I don't like cold but then I love it
okay - three - three hundred degrees
fahrenheit yeah
so basically the way it works is all
your blood your body freaks that right
so all your blood goes to your hurts
yeah and you know right organs so heart
pumping like I do yeah to try to keep
you alive and then at the end all the
blood goes back to your fingers and
stuff it's really good it cleans you
