things are very imposed by what he just
wanted one Savior yeah well we had it
guys we're heading to LA tomorrow I
haven't told you yet so I'm gonna need
my longboard for that we've arrived at
Jerome's and he just told me they're in
the middle of watching cowspiracy guys
this is the movie that inspired me to
stop eating me I know a lot of you know
that and I know you and a lot of you
don't want me to keep going on about it
baiis is life-changing you felt it's a
life-changing driving this me this is
amazing I didn't believe it when I first
learned it two hundred sixteen thousand
more people were born with the plan
every day every day it's extraordinary
but what's really extraordinary is you
eat per day 34,000 acres of corn to feed
a person I'll play PC and I play you
require just 1/6 of an acre of land to
feed that state for some vegetarian
diabetic who's next imperative of course
sweet times often to feed married
resistance high consumption by the meat
dairy and eggs with this is because you
could produce 37,000 pounds of
vegetables of one and a half acres but
only 375 pounds of meat on the same
cloth
you know places your honor I'll see you
tomorrow yes
say it back down
Joey's head into beds peace out
mmm almost still buzzing yes out of life
no me and Nik staying out doing some
instagrams we're trying to get a cool
motion shot of him skating past unless
it's with the lights kind of blurred in
the background I'm back in my room I'm
gonna get some sleep because we are up
relatively early it's gonna be the first
time I'm probably out of my room before
midday or week we're gonna go and hang

10:00 a.m. meeting hang outside gonna
grab a coffee or something

saying earlier we are all as a team
flying out to LA which is gonna be a
little bit warmer and there's a bunch of
people out there I'm excited to see
