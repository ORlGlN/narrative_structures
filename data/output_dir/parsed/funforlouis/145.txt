hey guys I am in Somalia right now and
I'm filming 360 video if you have a
little look around with a donkey and
basically I'm out here with a campaign
that the love army have been running the
last few months to Rome and some of the
other guys shakka who I'm out here with
have managed to launch a social media
campaign with raised over two almost two
and a half million dollars and today
we're distributing food admits spamming
that's going on in Somalia so there's
there's rice sugar flour vegetable oil
and milk that's been given out to three
hundred families in the area and yeah
I'm privileged enough to just come and
see what's going on we've got our and
armed guards with us because Somalia is
a bit unstable and not the safest place
a lot of our borders but it's pretty
incredible to be here and yeah
just to be a part of this really this is
my friend Ali he climbed up a tree
earlier because I crashed my drive he
scratched up his own it's a story but
the legends oh okay
gave him a cool pair glass looking good
rice it is a very cool I don't know we
just waiting for there's two villages so
you see I don't know if you can see in
the distance there's a crowd of people
there a crowd of people that way and
there's some women walking the other
side of this tree and I think they're
going to come round and and start and
kind of standing by their their little
collection of food these guys are the
Somali military they're also just
helping keep us safe here right now the
donkey having a little dust off well
the very high caliber weapon they told
me that the village leaders have already
identified the most vulnerable family
and given them a list of names so those
are the people that get to stand by the
food and then their additional family
members will come and help them take
food away once wants to handle it all
out haha
okay so they just explained that as a
1000 more people waiting for food in a
crowd over there and like I said this is
just the most vulnerable of this this
community that has access to this this
food so I guess the others are going to
have to wait until the next Supply Drop
I don't know when that is just show you
the the urgency and desperation that you
know if I'm in court I'm going to add
three it's a question that our has been
a Brandt recurring drugs there for
people when out of the reserves now it's
just perfect time to have food but soon
they're going to be farming chelsea way
again now just perfect time now now they
have something to wait until these
through the vegetation carrot arabic
foods that are the tomatoes and green
peppers anything that person a food that
they can stare at the market yeah cop
