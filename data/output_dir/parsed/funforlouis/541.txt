good morning guys we just made our way
down from an area of Nairobi comes too
wet so we're gonna introduce people and
yeah this is Raya yeah this is Anton who
owned for years and so I can see you
again
Anton and the team Steven and the team
run net to my knee foundation and they
run today they're running this single
more than just a meal the bakery the
sandwich is in London but this and Tom
he's one of my heroes now and he's and
so holding on this whole thing is
incredible come and see what's your name
Kennedy Kennedy or to jr. they beautiful
Junior
you have a mode of preparing of you left
your lunch for the kids and this is the
kitchen
yeah which is one of the key this is a
lentils we
sandy was just telling me that the
feel-good bakery are donating 80 pounds
a week at the moment which is providing
like three hundred and eighty meals that
they give the kids once a week
that's like 20p a milk which i think is
crazy it'd be cool if we could get there
fielder bakery publicized and you
generate more money to eat by selling
the sandwiches back in London and
providing more meals here
peace out
tell me about yourselves
begging the food around looking for
shelter
because of you I am friends now
using you
but life me but
but now we change not a lot of God no
now we are sewing
you look so different that's amazing
at the end of it everyone is so much
doing hope and right penises we're
thankful everybody's jealous before
hearing that they're just talking about
how grateful they are thankful they are
enjoying this loveless community change
their lives
what have to go through
thank you
thank you for buying from the good
bakery
that money is supporting they're more
than just a meal here but I'm never
shower you so I've got to know we finish
lunch now will the kids want to play a
big
and don't tell me about the football
team the football team is a seven a side
stream which is composed of either 17
boys team you guys here yeah
in some warm-ups before England's plays
Kenya in a minute yeah yeah yeah Louie
you play he's gonna win
ah Kenya Kenya in blatantly England is
it every year we pay you enough but last
year let's say we play dude it'd be
cheaper yeah yeah so we are the
champions at the moment we are need to
pay their cup
he's winning and II find it so hard
running about just running about on the
surface with lots of stones everywhere
and wearing these little Tom's nothing
we're winning two one two one is it all
the boys that finish their game and
we're gonna head off now catch these
guys again tomorrow
dinner hoping it's gonna be a little bit
more chilled tonight because this is
Sunday night so there's a big football
game going on at the moment so the lads
are sitting at the bar watching so it
turns out me and Ryan have this table
all to ourselves
having a nice little romantic time
together we are back from dinner and we
pretty much did end up just having
dinner
us two and the rest of the boys watch
the football which was actually quite
nice I love hanging out with the guys
but me and Roy have realized we haven't
had a lot of time just us for a long
time so we're taking the day off
tomorrow I need to catch all the few
logs I need to rest
it's been just full-on just been
non-stop but I've really enjoyed it
especially today seeing Anton and the
project and just the amazing stuff
that's happening some of the stories we
heard and the impact that's something
simple and we take for granted is having
a meal but knowing that these kids might
go days without eating and seeing the
impact that just was at 80 pounds a week
and have to feed like almost 400 kids so
if you guys want to find out a bit more
about the feel-good bakery which is
funding that and you want to get behind
that like I said in the other vlog it's
obviously funding the stuff that we were
just the other projects in Nakuru that
we were just at but if you want to find
out how you can help volunteer donate
all of that stuff I'll link it below
this is a really good thing to get
behind and I'm excited to be able to be
a part of it
all right Oh see it's Marie well not
actually the your tomorrow don't worry
about peace out
enjoy life endlessly adventure
