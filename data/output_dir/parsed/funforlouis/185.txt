that I've been put in and they're going
to be swapped out for the final
porcelain teeth they're going to be
permanently in my mouth I guess they're
clearing them in with some kind of
permanent glue for those who don't know
last week I am yeah I had major dental
work done and because they've kind of
really bad erosion of my teeth all the
enamel was gone that's been causing me a
lot of pain and and dentist has been
telling me for a while that and there's
nothing I can do so I ended up having to
get some crowns and veneers to protect
my teeth and yes today I've got like at
least four hours in the chair just
getting getting everything sorted so can

a visual recap this was a photo of my
teeth before and this is a trace of the
porcelain teeth they needed to make so
they go close up you can see my stubby
front top teeth and the erosion on the
back teeth of the bottom and then this
is my teeth now as you can see there's
links on the top teeth and the back
teeth are the right height stop me
grinding and here they are side by side
as you can see quite massive difference
and I am super happy with the result

I had to go back to the air B&B just
have a little nap because it was an
early morning and yeah I think I've just
been running myself not much sleep and
not much food they just need to rest up
for a bit but I've met out of riah
and we are heading to Signal Hill to
watch the sunset
you've been Signal Hill before I need
you Instagram is great really
so those of you that have seen my
previous Capetown vlogs you'll recognize
this spot as where I've gone paragliding
from before a couple of times we've
wandered down away from the main kind of
spot Signal Hill there's this little
footpath that discussed meanders down we
could all go all the way down there
because I have a clean shot of them
flying pebbles
she's great
hey don't scare Tristan I love LA thank
you right it's a nice little platform
don't attempt to jump up there eat it
sweating now hey guys a cool spot yeah

beautiful so while we're watching the
sunset
I noticed we're in the last hour of the
Kickstarter campaign 26 minutes to go
and we've hit a hundred and ten thousand
pounds sixteen hundred people backing it
this is incredible so this whole
Kickstarter things being a whole new
experience for me and it's not so much
that it's been stressful but I have felt
kind of anxious and I just changed JP
and he feels the same it's like until
it's over and we've managed to raise the
money there's been this kind of this
constant feeling of like what if we
don't hit it what if we don't hit the
target what we're going to do because I
guess we've got our heart so set on the
goal so I'm feeling super excited now
and yeah in 25 minutes it's time to
celebrate so good what a month and this
last week being really intense like
doing the live streams and trying to
pull into port from press and different
brands and stuff but we managed to do it
and if you guys contributed and that's
the project and thank you so much and
you are not going to be disappointed

sense of achievement you know were to
hit target especially when it like my
first time kind of crowds or something
and yeah so I feel good so we've had a
chilled evening it's nice to finally
relax like I said we've had a full-on
monthly and JP pushing for this

supported us it's going to be an
incredible movie and yeah very soon
we're going to get well underway on all
their kind of pre-production and
planning everything and yeah it's going
to be it's going to be pretty epic and
finally I hope earlier in the vlog
wasn't too gruesome for you seeing the
dental work cards getting done if it's
feeling pretty good I was wiped out at
the beginning beginning of the day it
was really full-on and yeah it was it
was weird kind of coming around from the
other the local anesthetic I had but
yeah it's it's already feeling kind of
really natural and I haven't had any
problems eating today
and I think it's just going to get
better and better it's good to finally
feel like I can eat properly without
having crazy sensitivity and also feel
like there's some longevity with my
teeth now and I'm not worried about them
just dissolving and disintegrating like
they were right on the weekend peace out
enjoy life live the adventure
