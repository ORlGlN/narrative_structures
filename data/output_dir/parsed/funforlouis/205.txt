game and it was like a competition to
make some babies out of play-doh this is
one of my favorite ones

a very active kid so you might you might
have your hands full right I'm gonna
shoot in the central now capture with
healthy and entire thing they're out for
dinner
actually having this right back in the
car heading into Central
gonna be a bit strange actually driving
past Westminster after the UM the terror
attack a few days ago
I've been following out on the knees and
just a crazy happening in other
parts of the world and you see like
these disasters and you kind of feel a
bit to touch from them but when they
happen in like your city and I with
really terrible wherever it's happening
and my heart goes out to the family that
were impacted
that's the world at conflict and
it makes me want to find police
yeah people basically well I've finally
got here after like 45 minutes and
traffic London is crazy right now
period Timoteo 15 eating it's easy
oh yes bright my Ellie wait yeah well
maybe nibble from yours guys check this
desert out
I missed the main that this is a vegan
dessert what even is that coconut ice
cream chocolate or
so we just come outside
I'm showing turn out be the Loom cube I
got every day what I'm doing this I've
got all my life back stuck way that like
it is nice and it's on this little
magnet
let this little magnet it sticks on
there I got convinced I'll being change
come to Ronnie Scott to me sit at the
Lake Jam going on
Alcide Nazi Party about it
well it's 2:00 a.m. that was awesome
loving the judge boys Alfie nhi left
early but stay in for a while just in
the zone you know probably time to head
back meet Laura at 9 for a 10:00 a.m.
meeting with Sony so yeah probably hit
the road well despite being a really fun
afternoon in the evening and yeah a good
time with Alfie and Shay tonight it's
actually quite sobering driving past
Westminster on the way home and yeah it
got me thinking a lot I think the main
emotion it provokes other than of sleep
and of sadness is dis confusion there
are you confused I just can't wrap my
head around and as a motivation to do
something like that you know I mean this
is pretty heavy subject to talk about
but I don't believe you know extremist
attacks a lot or anything to do with
Islam and it's sad that people kind of
yeah listen to the voices of a few kind
of crazy deluded people and and
attribute that to a whole face group of
billions of people and yeah I I want to
find more ways in my life and on this
channel to promote tolerance and
acceptance and yeah
to celebrate the diversity around the
world and that we all have different
ways of expressing life and different
traits and different ways of doing
things but I love that we can learn to
live together and love each other right
I will catch you guys in the morning
peace out enjoy life in this adventure
thing
