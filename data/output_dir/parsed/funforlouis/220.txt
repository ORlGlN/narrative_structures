unfortunately it's a very rainy day to
day here in Austin we've also met with
JP friends I now okay we just talked
about the situation's the hairy
dreadlock umbrella the hell is the
Angelou dream we've just rolled into
this building where they're showing off
this new electric sports car so I click
this like prototype far out this is like
coming out with Wi-Fi movie this is what
I love about summer software is it's
loaded like pick innovative companies to
showing off their latest and craziest
things admit it's gotta be a winner for
me so far guys look inside look allowed
in slowest way guys we have tracked
Amsterdam who were hanging out with last
night era he was in Mashable and we've
just arrived at the Mashable space first
up by Southwest and we're going to have
a little wander around now looking for
fun isn't it
what's the main things we need to check
out the ante photo shoot and Aniki
harder Photoshop and gets better
okay let's do this bro let's see this
bro take the south you this is a 360 a
farm run by inmates in my bones this is
a tiny planet version so you Felix you
didn't go right into you have to hold it
upside down which is really weird to get
used to
so you're going to hear and periscope
will read it automatically right we're
going to go and pull the sword from the
stone and we're getting this captain
slow-mo on a GoPro that's spinning
around like bullet points oil
guys like do this to the scuba literally
LED screen of the entire bar like oh wow
you're literally designing it lots of
hearts look a heart
I go maybe this wouldn't be that
practical look at all this inside that's
needed to power the lighting we are now
caffeinated ready to head back into the
rain we're going to try and find
somewhere cool to hang out now well it's
the way cool inside the delighted talks
going on so we're going to try to sneak
into one of the talks
my friends Brian Johnson is doing a
quarter like AI and stuff so might want
to get into that what sense of
intelligence I would say like what is
most everything humans could you never
want me it would be the brain because we
have no idea what's there and so if you
pretend in our eyes we trace the
electromagnetic spectrum and the
electronic spectrum is is a trillion
times negative experience and so there's
a reality that exists outside of our
definition
so I wonder like is consciousness
trillions of it is a possible range of
consciousness for our rings a trillion
times of mind-blowing for is a day
having niggas all used to learn how to
read and write DNA that we can use
biology ways we haven't ever had before
and if you think through what that means
for our ability to thank you biology is
very good at it's letting up I think
creating new structures for a materials
manufacturing unit right and so we
really want to make it an impact of how
we interact in the world and the
footprint we leave on the world is
managed and we need to think about how
we have a radically rear vision how the
makeup okay going we have winds back up
you get the bus but we balance very
cheeky spot in town to park up there's a
few friends we want to show around and
instead of tracing back up to the edge
of town to show
we're going to try and get amongst the
vegetable so we'll see how it goes all
right Louise going to try and park the
bus I don't know how this is going to
work out guys I just have to run down
the road and get dinner pretty hungry I
found this vegan chili dog with vegan
cheese this must be the most unhealthy
vegan thing of every and I'm very
excited let's see how this is I haven't
been a big fan of eating sausage in the
pasture that's alright that's alright
well we've been having a lot of fun
hosting people on the bus tonight kind
of amazing having I guess having my own
place it does feel like I have a house
and I'm going guests over and I'm very
glad we found this tricky little spot a
little bit naughty but we were only
going to be here for the evening so it's
yeah it's been nice to be right at the
heart of it all and now it's like 3:30
and we're thinking we should probably
leave we need to be back in LA in like
less than two days though we're just
going to hammer it you're ready Tamara
yeah I am but for very tempting we have
this hallway
and over here I'm a Tampa not to wake em
up or drop off at the house or just
bring home little to LA I don't think
we'd be happy about that
okay guys this is the start of our
journey from Austin almost 20 hours la
we are filling up the tank I'm doing the
first leg of driving it's brought some
Red Bulls for memory I've decided I'm
just going to have Red Bull and energy
drink when I'm doing long road trips day
to day like not drinking but rotor so it
is pretty efficient stay wink you might
not know this yet but JP has been making
a video in German of this entire trip
site and if you're German she going to
check it out I'll link that below and
it's been an epic road trip and we're
kind of sad to be leaving South by
Southwest it's been way too short
we still have 1,400 miles to go but we
have to do it really fast we've got like
two days so it's going to be a brutal
Drive you're ready for the brutal drives
easy I think we're under estimating like
the amount that's ahead of us and a lot
can go wrong as well it's gotten way too
smooth leave as far as I like and is
very quick but it's pretty I'm hoping
over the next day or so we'll get some
really nice like desert drying shots
we'll be able to just we haven't really
taken any photos of us with the with a
bus which is weird but we're going to do
all that and I think in it should be
pretty cool drive back I'm going to jump
behind the wheel now and catch you guys
somewhere we might still be in Texas
when I wake up but you know catch in the
morning peace out enjoy life
