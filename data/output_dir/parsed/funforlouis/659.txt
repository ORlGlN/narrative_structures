hi I'm lady Eve and I'm currently at the
temple of the magician in oak Schmoll
Yucatan Mexico living the adventure and
you're watching fun for Louie boom good
morning guys is a lovely day in
Marrakech
me and Roya going for a little wander
into the market and then just found a
really beautiful museum that we're going
to go and visit
apparently the building itself is
incredible is it the Museum of Marrakech
the museum of Marrakech so we're going
to go visit that as well
guys I just walked past this butchers
and there is a cow's head hanging
outside well we've split off from our
usual route and we're exploring some of
the streets that we haven't been down
yet love it
honestly is so fascinating it I think
this is probably up there in the most
fascinating cities of this skill and as
I'm saying - right yesterday like I get
so exhausted working here it's so high
energy but then maybe that's the same in
any city whether it's like like us you
know windy streets and selling Apple
city or whether it's like a commuting
modern city than I've never actually
lived in the center of a city before
do any of you guys find that if you live
in a city do you get exhausted being in
the chaos of it all or do you get used
to it and do you learn and up against
that ribbon let me know hey bro
yes pumpkin
oh look at the tiny kit and sleeping in
a bucket yes
oh yeah no can you Miami Leno dilemma
set off a little bit you wanna see your
hopeful I know
it's incredible how good this guy sounds
it's got a free string homemade guitar
but that combined with the choice just
beautiful and I've heard quite a lot of
Arabic you do this trip but this guy top
still he is killing it
we're in a bit of an installation
finding some awesome shots
rioters try to step over this fence and
not everything over is that embarrassing
that would also really cool it on camera
literally everything fell over oh that
makes me so happy
check this out biggest chandelier ever
what you can't even see the scale of
that but that is insane this whole
museum is titled
floor to ceiling with like intricate
beautiful tiles hands
oh yeah that is a second scrum I think
was everything about Marrakech is the
architecture Rena yeah like this
building's ridiculous look like every
detail would you do this in your house
when you have a house yeah one day well
when you have a palace this is yeah it's
sick
not trying to settle for that yeah don't
trying to take shortcuts in life that's
a good lesson you're sure
we've wandered into a spice and herb
shop and they massive bag what is that
you can leave me along you know
we are back in the main square we'd be
lost in the side streets for hours
awesome stuff they love it we're now
trying to find another cool little
rooftop terrace restaurant have some
lunch
I think we found our restaurant up there
guys I've been shooting some cool 360
stuff in the markets you can't leave me
along you know
yeah this is they should be more nail
every day just getting some of that
chili sauce get some flavor on there
just want to come out maybe some salt as
well some of these two genes aren't very
flavory and some new flavors
Oh
gonna stroll back to re-add before we
head up for the airport got our bags and
stuff Rhys doing some last-minute
shopping she's get postcard is it hard
thinking a postcard yeah I like that one
I like
the doors look good we've ordered our
taxi to the airport we're taking one
last little stroll on an Instagram
mission is a cool little door over here
that Raya spotted and we're going to
take a photo in front of it this has
been quite a magical trip guys it was a
bit last minute and we didn't really
have any plans but send out pretty
amazingly I think the taxi has arrived
thank you
back at the airport how's your time in
Morocco too short but we've got a coming
back and it's still more than three you
know what I like properly go to the
desert where you went with your friends
support like ultimate sand dunes get to
do that
yeah because our trip was so like such
limited time we can go right into the
desert but that that would be amazing
it was it was definitely worth coming
for a few days oh the ultimate adventure
exploration place I think so much to
explore basically because we booked off
flight so lane the return leg we could
only book business class it wasn't a lot
more expensive it's like 100 pounds more
that we have a lounge invitation this is
nice
we had some chill time in the lounge
at last minute laptop getting Instagram
up my Romania trip I'm always behind
away
I need to get back my Instagram game
removal
it's a lot to juggle traveling
taking the fire in a time all right
just been welcomed Phil I think that
works or never know the time is
approaching we are back my parents for
the night and pretty late it's actually
20 to 2:00 in the morning and I am
making a coffee because I've got lots of
