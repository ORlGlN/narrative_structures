your shoes
I don't bend good bro I loved your teeth
the vigil boys thank you so much enjoy
such a nice night
that was a lot of fun we've decided to
leave the party head back to the hotel
there's like a hospitality lounge on the
top floor so we're going to go back
there chill for a little bit it might be
a bit quieter to have conversations and
stuff we made our way to the hospitality
down I've got a handful of grapes I've
got a coffee I know that's kind of crazy
for this summer night but I've got some
editing to do I love coffee is that the
new style yeah I think the Bizon
Sawyer's room you killed it bro you
killed it tonight amazing guys what's
your name again
Alex guys I'm gonna link his channel
below check out his music beautiful
singing so good yeah let's do a video
let's do video
a lot of these conventions because you
just get to me the most amazing people
I've always said it it's the thing I
love the most about YouTube is helium II
the community that is YouTube it's it's
unbeatable there's no other thing I love
more about the platform than the people
I think I might call it a night we've
got another pipe tomorrow night I'm
gonna have a bit more energy tomorrow
during the day I think I'll be out of it
earlier making the most of my time here
in Turin say well like I said earlier
the garlic is incredible
it was brilliant to be a part of it even
if it was just intro in Ben's video but
it is inspiring to see so many
incredible filmmakers and content
creators doing what they love and yeah
it makes me think I'd love to experiment
a bit beyond daily vlogs and try some
other content I know I've said that the
whole time I've been vlogging but it
would be cool series invited me to play
around with maybe filming like another
funny video I don't know if you remember
a couple of years ago but we filmed like
a green-screen collab where we did I
think me and him we did a Q&A on my
channel and on his channel I was like
how to be American and kind of like a
classic Club but it was very funny so
I'd like to try some things like that
um and someday I'd love to try and make
some different content like some
fictional thing maybe I could try my
hand at acting I'm not very good at
acting but I could like I could I could
play some kind of role and yeah
something high production value would be
fun yeah maybe some documentary stuff I
like the idea of all that I'd probably
need to get a bit of a team together to
help me with that way I don't think I
could do that or one way I think daily
vlogging is a full-time job although it
looks mid not much effort from from your
perspective watching these videos
there's a lot of behind the scenes stuff
there's like there's a bit of work
involved in
daily vlogging but I I love doing it
still and I'm glad that I could share
with you even days like this where I
kind of get up late and there's not much
to the day other than the gala it's cool
that I could share that and I love
sharing my life with you guys so I know
don't say it a lot but thanks for being
a part of this amazing community that
makes my life possible and it always
means so much to me when I meet you and
and some of you have shared with me that
my videos have impacted your life in
some way in that's incredible to hear
and I'm glad I can be an inspiration and
do my little bit you know I'm gonna get
some sleep I've got a few people I'd
love to film some videos with and hang
out with tomorrow and I'll see you then
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
