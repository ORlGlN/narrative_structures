good morning guys it's my third and last
day in Somalia and we've got up super
early it's not even 6:00 a.m. we've come
down to what sunrise beach check this
out
what sister the space where and then
fills us home so the ALC which is the
organization that are on the ground here
and the local Somali volunteers that are
helping with all of the food
distribution which is happening on this
project and visiting doing incredible
things they've just told me that they
own quite a big boats and they trained
up locals with fishing skills because
they see the sea as a valuable kind of
food resource during this kind of really
tricky time of famine where a lot of the
livestock have died and I think training
people up and teach them how to fish for
food I guess is a pretty cool thing
oh my gosh they just Chuck on the beach
headshots do not feel free I guess this
is this wisdom of the fisherman list is
it's just their work area try out the
fish okay this is the little workstation
that alone will turn a man
ha are you eating or is it compadre I
thought it is smoked lamb double-step
look at that
whoa I guess I'm kind of torn seeing
this because on one hand yes but
phishing is providing valuable food to a
lot of people that need food and then on
the other hand I don't know I just feel
like we're kind of fishing the world's
fish population to extinction and it's
not sustainable but then maybe I can
choose that because I'm coming from a
position of privilege and the ability to
eat a diet of my choice so yet but the
know kind of taught but yeah what do you
guys think those of you that are vegan
and choose not to eat meat and fish or
your thoughts on them needing to eat for
survival like a lot of these people are
and also to generate the business and
money
okay for the Sun is risen we're just
chillin here now on the beach and
shackle is just saying it's actually
super peaceful here when somalia
stabilizes i feel like this will be an
awesome little resort area are like we
could do some restaurants on the beach
have a little hotel of mine i'll be
doing yoga
there's definitely problems in somalia
there's problems in all country and one
things can't think is that if Bulgaria's
all pirates you have to experience the
place of yourself and not just formulate
your opinion based on what one person is
saying because everybody has different
perspectives as far as I've been in
Somalia
honestly any terrorist I have seen any
ocean promising people live in their
lives and they're also called everybody
polarized in the whole country in a
particular way is that women children
aren't able to get the food that
anything they're help them in E so
really we've been out here humanizing
and also experienced I have a pleasant
time when I'm here such as me person
yeah it cool I definitely want to come
back and it to be like a real flyby
visit yeah I want to explore the rest of
Somalia and keep meeting people like
this needs local tears get on with their
life just you know going out fishing
running a business this is this is a
little window inter yeah just normal
day-to-day Molly life
where we just arrived the arrival is one
we arrive at the center where it's
honored by one of the beneficial one of
them there's one that we give
microfinance I want any committee with
Mohammed who's a manager for the
microfinance alone Aaron we running a
microfinance program here he is one of
three wishes we have even have some
little money three thousand eight
dollars to set up here it was a loan or
this microfinance loan so she set up
these premises
she's into this act I and I business
she buys plain sheets and she prepares
into those kind of vision pattern it
will be expanding it will be a kind of
generating new income from these new
ladies of unbelief skills and hopefully
it will add something to the society so
this is the process of the back making
they started off with just a simple
white cloth and she soars it up together
come over here and the reason why
they're tying it up is because their end
up they're going to end up dying it so
this is what creates a pattern soy Dora
yeah so that's what will create those
beautiful pattern what was she doing
before she started this business she is
an ADP she's in one of the displacement
come yeah yeah yeah she came around and
Yaffe identified her food microfinance
loan program I mean she visited solid it
is a its revolving the excuse I mean
many girls are analysts are they using
to generate income as a source of
livelihood that's perfect here asteroid
so from what I can see there's two sides
of the business there's the tie dyeing
and sewing up and making this clothing
and then there's the henna tattooing and
apparently once the girls are trained up
they're going to be getting up like a
mobile and a business where they can go
and visit people in their homes and and
do the henna designs and they're on
their hands and arms and stuff they
amazing what skill that's so talented
the woman are very unfamiliar here don't
like empowerment or the part of the
things like to be independent and so
barely they don't have to rely on
someone else they have to rely on
themselves and as the committee has done
we immediately started saying yes sir
release the ration the food supplies
that to love army bringing in it it's
emergency relief not long-term solution
to and supporting Somalia and start this
this is this is the long-term solution
is equipping empowering especially the
women to run their own businesses and to
employ other people and this is this is
really exciting to see it is really
exciting thing so guys just to show you
an example of how advanced Somalia is
okay the way that people pay for things
isn't with cash
it's not even with credit cards or even
like contactless it's all on their
phones it's all digital so after buying
the she what was that for a matter
$10 $10 that's five gold so I'm gonna
pay for the sheets so to pay her all I
need to know is her phone number
you usually have phone number isn't with
some software you'll press $5 and they
you play hush can you say okay you put
you I put my password you just load up
your phone credit and then that's how
people transfer money
they just need to find the time so this
is the amazing technology that you can
be see in Somalia the world doesn't
Oliver but the reality is because of the
civil war is always creativity
it's time to go sadly I'm saying goodbye
side
shutter and the mole guys it's been
incredible I'll be back I will be back
yeah right I've gone through two
security checks where they went through
my entire bag from the Somali army and
then the African Union Army and now I've
got the airport security - yeah pretty
intense
until tiny plane that was an interesting
flight looking forwards get rest well
I'm back in Nairobi to the night I have
got so much editing to do I cannot wait
though because we had an amazing few
days of adventures and yeah I just
really want to share them with you guys
so I'll catch you first thing in the
morning for my flight to Istanbul 5 a.m.
peace out
enjoy life live the adventure
