so today I'm with Cyr and we're gonna be
doing and ask Louie and austere peers
about you yeah last time I did this it
was kind of on the end of some of my
vlogs and I thought why not dedicate a
whole video to so if you want to know
who you are
yeah why do you wear dreads I think lots
of you wanna know that why do you have
dreads there's no reason why I have
dreadlocks
I just just decided have you seen that
long a little a long time how and then
how old do you think like this party
progressed well I trimmed them if you
don't but maybe like I think about what
were you guys doing eight years old this
grew of Louie's scalp done in front of
me let's see what you'd read loads Louie
what would you do if you were not a you
to Lou that's a good question what would
you do if you weren't a youtuber well
some of you may know I've got the
double-decker bus that me and Sam and
maths travelled around the UK on well
you know like other thing you're not be
doing something on my bus like either
living on air maybe doing some kind of
more like Youth Work stuff around London
still I don't know something like that
people know that you are kind of almost
fearless you've eaten all kinds of stuff
you know freaking done crazy things
what is your phobia this isn't like a
massive phobia but I dread throwing up I
hate vomiting maybe that's one of the
reasons I'm with you in that tap maybe
one of the maybe that's why one of the
reasons why I'm good at keeping things
down am I on my favorite channel because
I hate vomiting so much that I can fight
it really well okay do you guys twerk
apparently twerking was upside down so I
didn't know this
that's just some weird really weird
demented handstand okay benda basically
the answer is I cannot put why you're
always wearing gloves friend right
mm-hmm
guys I cannot tell you it's actually
something that you may find out one day
where's your inner monologue sound like
I think it's pretty simple I think I've
got like maybe like a Homer Simpson
voice that's just like thing right he's
like and he starts looking around for
like what like a hamburger sitting on a
shelf or something like it's gonna be
right there
loose you're in the moon look animala
guys Oh what am i doing right
the years 2077 earth has been invaded by
scavengers and I am the only person who
can save this place one job
this guy stepped on an island with
another youtuber ago it be I don't pick
one person one youtuber oh okay what is
it for life yeah but it has to be girl
in because yeah you guys have to marry
this yeah it's gonna you know we want to
we'd want to populate the island comment
he think would work out well unless
Holly with me to populate okay little
Louie babies mix with something running
around the island what would that be
what's the weird face you can make it
and I'm really singing to make a weird
face I'll go gonna go on this is like
bendy nobody could invent something what
would it be oh that's a great one
teleporter yeah well just open vent you
and I with Brooke with my brain what's
your worst habit maybe like accidentally
ignoring people with conversation and
like in distracts you did do that when
you're in your last party like oh no I'm
like so it still needs me like just done
