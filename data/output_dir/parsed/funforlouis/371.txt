Russian or Bulgarian Bulgarian symbols
they share a nail feather I came up with
it ok Bulgaria came up with a Russian
alphabet thank you and I'm not usually
in the country I can kind of guess what
words mean but because like if you read
the word it's just like symbols to me
like I don't know which ones Americana
which one's Lotte someone help you know
thankfully by the end of the trip I
don't know how many words are there I
think they all get very good at language
but I might try and learn
then cymbals me now we've just finished
a lovely dinner that Rhys grandma cooked
us from homegrown vegetables that we're
going to go and see tomorrow in their
little village house and we're now going
