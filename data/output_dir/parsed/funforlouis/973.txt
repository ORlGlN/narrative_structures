hi I'm Eddie and I'm Charlie and you're
watching con for Louie enjoy boom
good morning guys we are heading out
from the hotel there was actually
something we were going to do this
morning and I thought I just you know I
need sleep so I asked if I could just
skip that and meet up with the others
later okay came home to love it and
everyone skipped it
morning guys so we're now running a
little bit late to meet up with the
others we've got some energy drinks
and we're ready to roll
hey guys you're about halfway there
where we headed us if we are heading
from our hotel past this giant beautiful
Duomo - a horse statue that we were
supposed to be at 15 minutes guys
remember when I was here in Florence
like three months ago with little boys
Tyler and outfeed Joe Marcus and Troy
all that luck
this square view remember was packed
with like 10,000 people and there's DJ
over there and there's like lasers and
lights and smoke machines and stuff it
was crazy and it's cool to be back here
now and it's so so chill
we are now heading to do a guided tour
which someone who knows what we're
looking at some point no things until
that's what look at that I don't know I
just look everything that wow that looks
pretty look what is that guy doing
why are some dress and then some just
completely that's the Renaissance right
and rediscover nude
how you enjoying Florence a barley oh
it's Victor man I love France Italy is
such a pretty place
it's good to go on these guided tours
because he actually learned some of the
history about
we're now walking across this bridge and
the naught is to be honest I haven't
really been listening to the tour guides
because there's just too much to take in
I'm just like mesmerized by a statue and
I don't know about but this bridge is
cool it's just lots of expensive jewelry
shops I don't think we're going to be
shopping on this bridge you tempted
Shannon not really I don't have too much
money
Lily what you makin Florence I do really
like for I think it's very different and
there's so much culture everywhere
really it's like so excited this is a
good energy I think this is the most
genius money-making scheme I've ever
seen they're telling everyone to put
money in the in the bore and it pulls
into the drain and everyone's are
scrambling to do it they're just running
over to their foot in their coins in and
someone just make a little money yes we
first-time rich Justin you eaten three
ice creams
mind your business is how I see thing
that's that's how you do it in Italy you
don't mess around
hello mr. horsey hello
we have just ducked into a camera shop
and I've got myself one of these
diagonal dears alot of straps I saw Ben
and Steve get them in calendar on their
vlogs so it's a great idea I'm going to
copy others it's much better than
carrying it around by hand way below
yeah right we're just walking back to
the hotel we bumped into some viewers

going to stop this in the lunch
another key little restaurant
vicious
these pieces are absolutely delicious
but my visa came without much cheese and
Justins pizza came with quite a bit
cheese so he had this genius plan to
sandwich the two together and he's
discovered something incredible this is
the way forward

proud of knit back to the hotel you
upload my video hang on a chill for a
bit I'm trying to rest as much as
possible today and then gonna meet up
the guys in a bit run back in the room
getting ready to go out and I tried to
hang my shirt up in the bathroom in the
shower to decrease it it's a little tip
you can hang any of the shower and the
steam decreases it but I hung its new
clothes I hung it too close to the
shower and and it got really wet so I'm
having to dry it quickly before before
