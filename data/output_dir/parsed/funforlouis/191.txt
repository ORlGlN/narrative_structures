the Sun is sitting right now and I was
going to send my drone up trying to get
some shots but it's super windy outside
so I decided to stay here for another
day but later on we might take her
Nick's throwing up she's got the plan
and called pro and I've got these little
Loom cubes I got when I was at a photo
show in the UK and we're going to
connect them onto the drone if the wind
dies down later in here we're going to
collect you at the dry and gets another
cool night
and God
this is really cool this made up of old
oil they're having a little couple
date night door has gone back to the
Airbnb and we're eating sushi I've got
this avocado and something sushi is it
this is the best fishing takedown isn't
it
this place will be willoughby well how
is a very delicious dinner and good
night eat conversations and heart to
heart it's just the right back at Nick
avenges and we're going to take this for
a very quick spin this is Nick's salmon
for pie so we're just connecting these
little loom cube attachments because
saying earlier and check us out I've
rigged them both up to this app so I can
just hit them here and like slide up the
brightness level correct for spying on
your neighbors you have this forward
oh no wings that we know this down test
at 90 right we're just checking out the
flume tube website showing how they do
like drone shot okay so see would be
good to be done Beach from everything
we've seen on the website I think the
main use of using this for nighttime
like shots it's lighting an area to
actually take photos from the ground so
we're going to mess around with it
tonight but I think when we've got a bit
more time and we we've found like a sick
location like a waterfall or something
we're thinking we could light up the
waterfall and yeah and do some epic
night photography
so people are very safety-conscious in
Capetown of eclis there's a bit of
danger here but we're parking up this
kind of looks kind of suspicious so
equally I'm got long before there's a
lot of like security cars that drive
around looking after certain
neighborhoods so NYX NYX thinking maybe
I just just in a cartoon wanders my guys
drink differently after new probably
going to go again it's especially a guy
had like someone guarding him yeah
so let's just do this quickly guys how
awesome is this person okay they're
currently on the lowest brightness right
now as soon as you take off on this
level and high brightness it's a bit
windy but we should be right
okay we're getting magnetic interference
but still like should be right
whoa right that is bright very good
it looks like a helicopter boat it's so
right it looks like a terracotta these
things like the perfect lighting oh my
gosh look at it I'm going to go up I'll
do that
