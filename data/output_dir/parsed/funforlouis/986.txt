hello everyone I'm Haley from Canada and
you guys are watching fun for Lily guys
today's been an interesting day so far
me and Steve have both been feeling
really rough and we've just had to sleep
a lot of the day so we've finally
managed to prize ourselves at the hotel
room and we're going to take a little
wander around the local area and see the
cool things around here
how you feeling steve-o I'm all right
now than ever not feeling great but it's
nice to get some fresh air
needed some recovery time I think we're
getting there we're getting there with
our recovery I think yes they just took
out of us I think the whole trip we've
just been a bit like long day's late
nights early morning kind of vibe and
that's not good man burning it burn
there - yeah - so hard crossing the road
here guys
it's not the same rose and then they
went you could walk
and then the help people like ours
I think this particular experience in
India has been interesting for me
because we would put up in the Four
Seasons five-star hotel but then we can
walk straight outside and then we walk
through these streets where you know
it's a clearly very different world than
oh it's just been a bit bizarre it's
been different resourceful to get my
head round the nice to different world
is now and I'm waiting to see into this
world but I'm finding a bit detached I
think I'd love to stay somewhere like
here with like a local family and kind
of really experience the true culture
like first half rather than just walking
along and like looking at people's lies
and the people watching
look at that shape
hello the kids around here so cool swell
start the music keep them well swell
start the music we can't really portray
someone just threw a bang or what ha ha
he's throwing that hello well nuts
so is that some kind of celebration got
under there like firing off bangers and
stuff we're hearing for myself but well
my ears actually ringing dangerous Hey
it's hard to betray on video the full
kind of immersive experience of walking
down the roads because there's like heat
from places as like smells as like
otherwise just I'm trying my best shot
shoot little things and show you guys
but this is you've got to experience
this in mad will start the music sleepy
people to keep them well started
we've got this group of kids following
us we don't even know where we got it
probably going to lead them down a bed
everyone is so friendly everyone's
saying hello that asking our name is
cool
this might be a dead end and then did it
a bit cut through hi hello can we walk

built into this slum basically which way

I was not excited that much bro how
friendly are people here unbelievable
I think Indian people are the
friendliest people have ever encountered
I don't feel at all in danger
I feel just completely welcomed and
everyone just wants to meet us and just
the most positive voice ever I kind of
guy is that we've only come down here
and walked around on the last night keep
it moving ugliest are we doing B&C her
really hungry but I don't know I trust
the food still English side here like
they've got like raw chickens just out
so we might stroller find somewhere a
bit more legit because you don't mess
around in India we've already felt a bit
weird today and stomach something about
a bit cramped up so stay safe keep them
all busy mother sorry joy give me more

restaurant we ate in the other night and
we can trust the food here

fight with the rides at the airport we
had some nice serenading by our camp
driver thank you it's good singing got
that ticket India has a hilarious amount
of checks and counters that you have to
pass through probably like double the
amount as a normal Airport we probably
had our passport checked like five or
six times and for some reason there's
like four stamps on my ticket now nuts
in it grazie
hello write it on the plane
business C or unlikely the same breath
again
mando she got through a long time
my feet can't even reach the end I feel
kind of sad that we're leaving India
because we literally only been there
like four or five days and that
definitely wasn't enough time to
explore and we did get a nice taste of
what Mumbai is like but we would have
Bert

afield sure there's lots of
usual attention surrounding bring y'all
very much cost which are distinguished
almost like you bother technique
honorific initiate mixtures thanks
