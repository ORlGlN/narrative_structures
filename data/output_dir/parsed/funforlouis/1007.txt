look stroll down with all of Lucy's
housemates getting I get some coffee and
her house my Caroline gave me this
special creams but my wound which is
healing nicely ready for coffee
so we've hijacked Louie's camera and
we're going to get some ingredients to
make breakfast meanwhile we edit this
video from last night
and these are my roommates
so the best things ever so we came here
to get breakfast foods we're leaving
with lots of potato products it's a new
chocolate ice cream so who knows what we
can make with that but you share those
regulations

doing it better school fight back this
is it's breakfast time
oh this is amazing that's our chair and
that's goat cheese you didn't find a
sack that'd be such a camera so Lucy's
gone out and now I have jumped my penny
boards and I'm skating down sea soya
it's just beautiful weather here in LA
loving this
I just stops and the farmers marking the
wait soil got food
right now we rule school like that
it's a little bit scary during the
downhill penny boarding off my shawl the
other day I need to face my fears and
get my confidence back has to be done if
you ever injure yourself or fail at
something and it puts a bit of fear into
you guys
you got just you do Scott go again even
if you're scared you go mate in soil
yeah good man you know you don't want
some yeah oh it's getting bad over what
you go saying you wonder like black

haha what you've been feeding it on
Lily's is scooping everywhere this is
all today that's awesome right it took
like nine hours and it's cool this
massage chair time bro I've been in the
massage chair for like an hour
look who's arrived it's Casper oh he
stole the chair you stole it

about what happened I guess everyone's
probably been apologizing about what I
saw oh that wind yeah nice it's getting
better it's getting bad things happen to
good people sometimes we should have you
a penny board though oh I threw it away
as soon as I wash your blog no man type
a penny board yo he penny boys here
after you did that I think he's a
lunatic
we should go to anybody but seriously we
can find one
like well just left sores and had a
great night hanging out with everyone
very chilled literally spent most a
night in the massage chair but it was
good it's good I felt a little bit out
of it because I'm still jet-lagged so
I'm still kind of yeah just trying to
get in the LA Times own but it's been
good
hanging out with Sawyer Casper Alexa
popped over and I'm looking forward to
hanging out a lot of the other guys over
the next few days vidcon's starting
tomorrow actually tomorrow evening
tomorrow during the day though I am
going to go and hang out see R and Kate
and Damon and some other people down at
the walk tour in San Diego cuz they're
not in LA at the moment and they're not
coming to VidCon either they're doing
the walk tour like all over America and
luckily and they're not too far away
tomorrow so that's gonna be fun
I think Lucy's going to come down and
Nick Miller has just flown in today as
well and his wife and she goes no scene
on his channel he did the wife tag
the yes just everyone everyone's
arriving that's for the days and it's
going to be an amazing weekend but I'm
going to go home back to Lucy's for the
night and just just I'm just taking it
easy that's why it's been a chill day
today I'm just taking it easy ready for
the hectic few days ahead
what's some waiting for Lucy to come by
and pick me up I thought I'd talk a
little bit more about fears and like I
was saying earlier I am penny boarding
again and try not to let my injury the
other day affect my confidence on the
board and but on a deeper level in life
I think often the more that we go
through life and experience negative
things we I don't know it's not just
fear but we kind of
when things happen we react and it means
that we maybe don't want to step out of
our comfort zones again because
something negatives happened and I think
it can really I think it can really
prevent us in life from doing things I
think we can really be inhibited by our
past experiences and we can really let
those things dictate will be doing the
future so I know I'm reading into this
really deeply but honestly I think in so
many ways in life you can you can just
be yeah it just stopped
paralyzed and restricted by past things
having a negative effect or fear about
what we're doing in future I don't know
that makes sense but I'm I'm very
adamant that we should even when we've
had negative experiences not let that
affect how we behave in our future and
what we believe we're able to do and I
don't know just if those are things
happening in your life at the moment and
you feel like something in the past has
affected your ability to you know but
all confidence to do it just just do it
and just be courageous and that's that's
a little bit of advice for tonight and
on that night and I'm just going to be
heading straight back and get some sleep
and for VidCon tomorrow
so these out into a life and if you
venture
