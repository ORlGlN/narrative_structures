and you're watching good afternoon guys
we've had a lovely morning of Riyadh
today so nice basically in in Marrakech
there's all of these places you can stay
and they're like these got these big
courtyards in the middle with all these
rooms in the outside and it's just
beautiful we're gonna go for a little
stroll now I'm fine thanks to eat for
lunch and I still need to try and get a
few more gigabytes and why at this
little SIM card I bought yesterday so we
can get more videos up for you guys look
at these cute little dolls eyes
the streets are so hectic guys gonna
help with it to stay get hit when they
are moped boys crazy
right what your first impressions in
Morocco I like nothing like you where
I've been before just makes me really
excited like how much stuff
hey ma'am
hey boy
these lockers smell incredible these
spices behind us just like filling the
air with I don't even know what it
smells amazing though
what is that smell
Caprica maybe paprika we're back at the
phone shop I'm trying to get more
gigabytes on my sim card they're
following this guy he's going to take us
to where we can buy more data
seems like a very long process we've
walked into the main square in Marrakesh
and this is like the center
well the main tourist stuff is I guess
but it's still fascinating this a lot of
markets
we're following the noise of some
drumming and music over here we're gonna
go check this out these are very close
look we're standing here Cobras are
right here
maybe a venomous snake
welcome
we found the cute little restaurant that
overlooks the market
terrorists
starters at the right little bit bread
yes Bret
Cheers
Maine's the variety playful to zoom to
the town what is it is this potato
potato peppers tomatoes olives I like it
over here because you can look over the
mayhem and chaos of the market but it's
like quite tranquil
cause I feel like we're like above it
all just like well they might be further
away another if we come back we should
go like staying with the Bedouin tribes
I wish we could've done we might be able
to do it a day trip to visit the Bedouin
sand stay with an imitator that'd be
cool I think you ride out there on a
camel and then you can like you can I
stay with him overnight and the stars
that we're amazing in the desert
I think it's quite nice getting away
from recognizable cultures like England
at Weber and it gives you a totally
different perspective in the world
it makes me think a lot it makes you
think like I wonder what how these
people operate and how they see the
world and and the difference in views I
it's just so important to get out of
your bubble yeah
continue that bubbles obviously way
bigger than usual but like America been
a lot of Europe and stuff is kind of
like a bubble just like a comfort zone
yeah this is just so drastically
different and other coaches going to
check out this hand-painted pillow just
a trip away to the desert
this guy's gonna explain what we're
doing what we're doing tell us I want to
feel making a video tell us what we're
doing show us the shows the plan seven
half a 70-year with the party from
market uh-huh crossing the Atlas
Mountains you stopped twice yeah first
time for at the panoramic view pictures
second time you sit down for coffee or
drink oh I love coffee and for toilets
