Francisco
yeah celaya guys I just got in the
little bit trouble when I was out trying
check in my bag with her they were
asking to weigh my hand luggage on my
hand like just heavy it was 20 kilograms
- split up 12 so she started kicking a
big fast and I was like you don't
understand they might fly with this
never had forums but the reason I never
had problems cuz they never weigh it
anyway
finally never take her on she's very
fine - they say Thank You Kaylin being
understanding but I just don't - check
in all this electronics and camera stuff
and hard drives
