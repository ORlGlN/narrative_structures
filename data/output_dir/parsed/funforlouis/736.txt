good morning guys remember you can hear
that thunder behind me that's crazy it's
rained a little bit this morning but we
are up bright and early because I've
been invited to this really cool project
happening on Santa Monica beach called
the barefoot wine beach rescue and we're
gonna be picking up litter and yeah just
just cleaning up and it starts at 9 a.m.
so it's half eight now and we're gonna
stop up for a little coffee I'm not away
this is the best coffee place in LA
so we've arrived down at Santa Monica
beach and we are just waiting to get
told the plan few volunteers have shown
up this is this is a fun vibe this is
really fun fight that's right we're just
signing up and collecting our t-shirts
this for me
that's alright thanks for inviting me
first of all thanks for coming my name
is Bram I'm the chairman of the West la
Malibu Chapter the Surfrider Foundation
we're really stoked to be here with
barefoot barefoot has been supporting
Surfrider for over 20 years now in that
time they've donated over a million
dollars to the organization Surfrider is
an environmental nonprofit that is
fueled by activist energy I'm a
volunteer all of the individuals that
run that 85 chapters in the United
States are all volunteers we're out here
protecting oceans waves and beaches
because we love it here and we feel the
need to take care of the places that we
love the purpose of a beach cleanup is
yes to clean up trash from the beach but
it's really secondary to getting people
to come out and take a look at these
things that are on the beach that are
littering our waterways and see if
there's some way that you can make a
change in your own personal life to
eliminate this plastic waste from
getting to the beach in the first place
barefoot wine has generously offered to
donate five dollars to the Surfrider
Foundation for every Instagram tweet or
Instagram post or to twit a twit twit
twat beat
with the hashtag Beach rescue so if you
guys are on social media please take a
moment at some point today take a
picture post it tag us hashtag Beach
rescue $5 goes to strip writer it's
awesome we're putting our clubs on
gloves bags let's do it this is where we
are dumping all the litter after we pick
it up already got quite a good
collection
so we've been told there's a lot of
litter under the pier so we brought all
the way over to this size I'm going to
investigate

litter good job Nick hold on
I know it's a talented really good job

Nikki read of course you guys are going
to hear from in a moment thank you to
all of the volunteers core activists
that belong in our network can continue
to show up and participate in any number
of environmental campaigns and events
that we've got going on here in West LA
Malibu then there's a couple hundred of
us but if we make that a couple of
thousand or a couple million and think I
think we'll see the difference
immediately you know so how powerful is
that looks pretty cool right on the
arrows and our social media platform
this is the one place where I really
feel like you can count on the message
to spread like it says encouraging young
people to be a part of something and
kind of purpose and and they really they
really do so um that's my spiel about me
a huge thank you to website Malibu's
Surfrider chapter also barefoot track
relying for your commitment to clean
each's and you're awesome wine and
without you guys this would have been
possible so thank you guys so much we
got a gift from barefoot wine and Rachel
are particularly happy amazing so good
and it's so good to be involved with
these guys and what they're doing I was
chatting to the guys Surfrider's and
they're cleaning beaches all over the
world and barefoot wine have been
partnering with different people
cleaning beaches and it's something you
guys can get involved with as well
I'll leave stuff below links and stuff
today I tweeted saying that for every
retweet barefoot wine we're going to
donate $5 - yes sir Fridays and cleani
beaches and I got over 5,000 retweets so
that's 25,000 dollars of donations from
you guys I just wanted to say thank you
your back our house and it's been
raining every since we left the party
just let's make a coffee I just need to
show you something guy that just knows
this right outside the window
yeah it's this little worm I don't know
what that is it's a bird feeder for
hummingbirds see if I see any
hummingbirds combust
I will filmed and show you how cool they
are
serenade a snake
you
so beautiful
so we just ordered Thai takeout for
dinner and I've just turned the hot tub
on it's gonna take a little while to
heat up so the plan is we're going to
eat food watch a movie on the projector
screen and then after the movie hang out
here and just have some amazing time as
friends in this beautiful place well
guys it's been a great day despite the
rain I actually think the rain is
probably a good thing for California
considering its having a drought
everyone I spoke to today it was like we
never get rain like this and they were
really excited to see it so yeah I guess
is I guess it's good it was also really
amazing to take part in the beach
cleanup today and I realized that
although it's only me personally only
picking up like a few bags of litter
that we found as a team collaboratively
we like we created you know connected
that massive mound of litter and it just
made me think on a bigger scale as well
us as a community or you guys as well if
we all do our part in our local area
even if you don't live near the beach
just to pick up litter or just to help
in any way to preserve the environment
your written it actually all adds up and
when we've all got that kind of attitude
day to day we can genuinely make a
difference in saving our planet and it's
something I need to challenge myself on
a lot more the ways I live the attitudes
I have in how I can be
more mindful in how I know look after
where I am and where I live so let me
know below of you guys are already doing
things in your area or call conservation
what you're doing helping out things
like beach cleanups I'd love to know the
kind of things people can get up to out
there and ways I can get behind things
more support other projects awesome I
will catch you guys tomorrow for pretty
children peace now enjoy life and live
the adventure
