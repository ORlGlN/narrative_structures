Wow bit of a surreal morning really no
more driving the tap tops we're here
we're out there the finish line is
really cool come in last night and we
had a long long lock-in and now can I
just walk it around to a nice thing to
eat maybe some breakfast or lunch other
day so me and Finn are going to try the
coffee here we're going to sip it
together it's quite water to those that
yep
now do Saturdays
how's it that was a better breakfast
than I expected
yeah we go down there let's have a
little look at this pool
we're just going to go and see how the
girls are doing this morning
here's the finish line that we came
through last night and we're just
wandering over to admire all the other
rituals as well so we just came out to
our tuk tuks and the first time on the
trip we've had stuff stolen out of them
which is really weird
head-on inverted stolen and these guys
have had their the front of the radio
stolen that's not cool well we've had a
nightmare this morning trying to get on
internet so I have this clever idea it's
very naughty but to basically connect to
the router of the whole hotel change the
passwords that only we know the password
and then we'll have the whole internet
connection to ourselves booting everyone
else off it's a little bit naughty but
maybe we just do it for the hour just so
we can you know do our stuff so you've
logged on to I managed to get the
password log onto the route right now
we're just trying to find out how to
change those Halsey's this vlog manager
say you watching this how's the hacked
internet working world house one where
you happy
nice pitstop baby
I felt bad and we put the password back
to the original password so when so
other people in the hotel could use the
Internet
and we're still doing laptop Club
chiller
Jack with me and Jack basically being
inside the whole day just relaxing what
did you get been drinking
yes canary eyes in trinket heaven me
Jack and will and it's going to cruise
into town we've been very lazy today and
but then I was trying to go and explore
a bit before we have a party tonight and
get some good food as well

focus but it's dinner time I tell you

no coughing oh oh look oh my gosh look
what does happen
within a minute we've had the battery
when I blew up in this smoke everywhere
now these bulls are fighting outside the
top clubs and I just stood in poo this

courage is alright blowed away

blowing up so I've rewired in the
negative to the negative terminal of the
battery
