you ready it's starting out this yeah
yes sir Happy New Year guys
this is my 1000th vlog and it's the 1st
of January 2016 and I thought I'd do a
bit of a special video today I'm here in
langkawi malaysia with Raya and we're
going to do a Q&A I tweeted out for some
of you guys to ask us some questions
Sal's got a few here zero current life
journey going the way you previously
planned or things completely different
than expected speed honest I've never
planned my life out I've had a few ideas
of things I love to do but I haven't
planned as such like I've never had like
a 1 year plan or 5 year plan it's
definitely gone in a direction that was
unexpected and if I think about what I'm
doing now and where my life's at I could
have never predicted this you don't have
to stick to a plan like things are
always going to change I think yeah
Society makes you think that you need to
have a plan from today till like when
you retire pretty much which is insane
yeah hanging out with you and Ben and
all of you guys that's like the first
time I saw people that didn't have a
plan and we're like kind of winging it
but like winning so I was like yeah I
think I can do that too what is the
biggest obstacle you've ever had to face
and overcome in life
um probably moving to America I guess
like coming to America without speaking
any English and going to school two days
later and yeah just like dealing with a
huge culture shock and mainly the
language barrier was really hard and yet
no one has even heard of Bulgaria so it
was there's definitely a difficult
transition but I think it's like my
proudest moment as well like overcoming
that in my early 20s I went through a
pretty difficult relationship and I
think it taught me a lot and I had to
overcome the feeling that I failed at
something like drastically failed
because I'm an optimist I always see the
outcome is being good like no matter
what happens I'm always like oh I'm sure
this will work out buying or will be
able to overcome the problems that you
face and I quite like problem-solving as
well that when you've invested three or
four years of your life into a
relationship and then it fails
catastrophically that's a real big thing
to deal with yeah I guess you you can
learn from failing basically okay the
main question we were asked was are we a
couple and there was like various ways
of putting that and the answer is yes we
are it seems like an appropriate time at
the beginning of the year it's like a
fresh start and so there you go I don't
we guessed already yeah if you if you're
observing you may have guessed
and as always it's felt a bit weird
making it like an announcement because
over the months it's been a bit of a
journey and it's like a personal thing
but also I've wanted to share that part
of my life with you guys
yeah mostly oh I think it's time for
think times it's kind of like you know
when you change your status on Facebook
but like times a million so that's why I
wanted to wait a little bit and not like
announce it from like the day we started
that would've been worse and there's a
follow-on tweet from that which I
thought was quite nice rich what's the
best moment you've spent together and
where and where were you yeah as you may
have seen I went and surprised Riya for
her birthday it was like a blood moon
lunar eclipse or something and that was
like so magical we stayed up and watched
that and then I think the next day we
like drove into France and had literally
the most magical day ever so if you
haven't seen that vlog I'll link that
below but that was probably the best day
of spend maybe Jamaica yes that yeah
that morning when we like we woke up and
didn't look at our phones or laptops or
anything and just sat on the balcony and
like tossed for a couple of hours and I
don't know it was just really really
nice what's your number one Year's
resolution
cool let's cool it go yeah I made the
fur balls that were in there I'd say I
really want to get into my fitness a
little bit more so I kind of just want
to find something active that I really
love doing and that I can do regularly
as well and I think that's something I
struggle with other than video hook my
life and editing I really struggle with
routine I guess I'll get personal now I
think mine is to learn to love my body
and just like love myself more in turn
because I think it's just like a really
dumb thing that gets in the way a lot
and really really hinders my confidence
so that I'm gonna get over that this
year if you have to have your very own
travel dog what breed would you choose
and what would you call him /her now it
has to be a totally taking planes so you
couldn't really do a big dog
what's a little dog that's cool not sure
our no offense finger to ours but a
little dog that's cool that's cool
perfect free I don't know I mean guys
I've never had a dog I don't even know
the don't worry Hey what who knows all
the doctor freaky okay well we're
getting a Jack Russell then it's a
dresser yeah okay that's wise already
good yeah
and I love Jack Russells they have the
personality of the victim of like a big
dog but they're little I love animals
but yeah I'm more of a cat person
yeah well you cannot say that because
you haven't had a dog you can't say that
you had a cat no son no guys no oh does
nobody have to change their mos right
because like the biggest thing between
us okay
it does Riya keep a count on how many
country issues visited and how does it
compare to Louise I have to look at my
app I have that ass that you showed me
it's called Ben and like the
and been been like been like being
something yeah like you've been
somewhere been yeah we don't see you
being yeah I've been to lose it but
Americans oh wait I've been to the
restaurant okay how do you so saying the
same word but we say a different I've
been to the rest yeah yeah like been
like my dad then yeah I've been to the
restaurant
yes guys do you say bean or been so I've
been to 28 countries okay you've got a
bit of catching up to do um and also you
have nine years in me so yeah true what
is your favorite part about traveling
together ups and I can tell this is an
American because you still favourite
without you and traveling without to
else remember me so had to say like our
absolute dream day yeah pretty much the
same thing you you always had a few more
puppies they're pretty much in mark I
got but yeah like we get excited about
the same things and we love doing the
same kind of thing so you're just like
we just get it you know when you spend
time with someone and it's difficult I
think when I sit down with you it's just
really easy like I feel like there's no
energy drain at all like some people
were little bit draining to be around or
high maintenance or and I'm sure I can
be lapped some people as well
I've had some really great friends and
we'd go travelling it just doesn't work
you don't have anything to do with
whether you like the person or not but
you just need to travel like the same
way to make it work yeah what do you
feel is your biggest success in 2015 oh
that's a great one I think making this
kind of work it's been a success for me
because I always wondered and it's
something I probably responded to
previously as I just thought I don't
know how compatible my life is with a
relationship like the last three nights
here I've been staying up i've been
shattered after dinner sleeping for a
couple of hours waking myself up with an
alarm working for three hours through
the night going back to sleep again just
to try and get my
it's my vlog edit edits done and then
try and have new things throughout the
day to video so trying to juggle that
trying to juggle down and also work on
like a new relationship with someone
it's it's kind of bizarre and we're than
difficult so there you go there's a bit
of an insight into the life of a vlogger
a daily vlog on I guess mine was like
fully deciding to step away from trying
to be successful in like society's view
and like like quitting my job and moving
out of New York and living out of a
backpack just like really going for it
you know and still feeling like it was
like the best thing ever and I don't
think I'm ever gonna regret that so and
you've obviously made there fun oh so I
hope you guys enjoyed a bit more of a
traditional YouTube video a sit-down
video a chatty video I'm gonna try and
do these a bit more regularly maybe once
a week we'll see how it goes it's nice
to switch it up a little bit from the
daily vlogs although we are about to go
parasailing so but we also filmed the
video of riah's channel she has a
channel we didn't realize you need to go

want to take my family on vacation and I
have to take them parasailing to another

sunset because we don't get to watch the
sunset from our side of the island I'm a
little bit annoyed though guys because
my zoom lens something broken with it I
don't know if you'd be noticing but the
the focus is a little bit out so I'm
gonna have to replace this when we next
get to a major city
