important night as well as being buyers
birthday which is important it's also a
super moon and a lunar eclipse and that
only happens every 30 years so we were
gonna sleep and now and then we were
like oh and we thought it's like 4:00
a.m. that it was gonna happen so we were
going to go sleep wake up at 4 a.m. and
see the moon doing its thing but now we
found out it's 2 a.m. which is not that
late so we're gonna sit watch a movie
yeah two hours time so we're gonna sit
watch a movie and then head out and
hopefully get a pretty epic time-lapse
of the moon it's just turned midnight

30 really different to a minute okay the
movies finished we're heading to bed
