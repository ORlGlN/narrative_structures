it's day 2 of painless life and we have
a three outward being great today which
feeling alright I'm feeling alright I'm
ready I'm ready
just did one coffee baby are you feeling
this morning
all right cook this done Alfie gave me a
for knowing that he had in this bag
ready I'm here with the bagger bros yo
who else in army up just a sport you
don't really want to sit behind here and
like sign things though I think we're
gonna stand how the front against that
everyone
this is crazy
lots of screaming
you guys ready for this your first play
listen good this guy jesse has made me
this Swan this origami swan wow that's
insane
how long did it take you to me thanks so
cool guys check out the one he may dry
out yeah I just didn't know this kind of
stuff as possible with our army
well these girls doing they're doing
like ribbon yoga
by the meals going well we've been going
for like two hours it's pretty awesome
Rachel's just asked me to do a handstand
with her or a photo so this is horribly
wrong I did it I did it
that was great meeting everyone thanks
for you came down to meet us it was cool
because we didn't have as many people as
some of the other meetup queues but we
got to chat with everyone which is
really nice and I always love meeting my
viewers so yeah it's been a good morning
riah despite this this is everything I
needed life hello can I have some free
coffee please Justin Justin americano
please
thank you so much have a good afternoon
hey Louie hope you're doing good in
Orlando I just touched down in Rio man
first time so I've actually never been
to Rio de Janeiro before I have worked
on a project in Brazil and my brother
and sister-in-law actually live here and
hopefully gonna come and meet me at the
airport which is really exciting and
cinnamon ages but it's kind of
interesting as well I feel like Ethiopia
was all about basic utilities water
electricity you've got to buy in China
or about political freedoms freedom of
speech sort of things to do with labor
and sort of fairness in the workplace
India was about pollution and about
education Japan was about work ethic and
work-life balance and then I feel like
now going to Brazil and to Iceland in
its different ways we might hear quite a
lot about corruption politics unrest
things like that but maybe not we'll
just have to listen and see what people
say it's different things all together
bone kind of interesting because both
Brazil and Iceland this month
proves the unrest in in
impeachment of their leaders and stuff
like that so let's just see what's going
on I'm excited to be here though and
Brazil is one of my favorite countries
ever really has a place in my heart and
excited to be here again guys this is
the hottest by a country mile it's been
on the whole tour and it's only 8 a.m.
but I'm out with my bro and her sister
live this is Nathan hey and I'm excited
just to spend the weekend here and get
set already for our event on Monday so
we're staying here in Rio for a couple
of nights before Louie arrives in her
Gina's house and this is herb dog Amelia
and and she's kindly hosting us but
since I've been here and I found that
she is a teacher and so I wanted to ask
her some questions about education here
in Brazil so Luke just explained to me
that they what a gene is saying is that
there are lots of laws there is lots of
structure but nobody really Revere's the
law and you know it's not in what it's
not executed on politicians when they
break the rules and things like that so
to improve the structure here you just
need to find a way to get people to
adhere to the north corruption is almost
cultural here if people don't
necessarily know what else they could
expect and so people just think well you
know when recently 20 billion went
missing from from one of the
government-owned
petrol companies people don't really
know if that's a good or a bad thing
like is that normal is that happening a
bit I guess in our tiny little way
that's what this project is about is
trying to show people really quickly how
all the different places and regions
around the world are operating so
in compare and contrast as they are with
it alright on that or no this is really
bad
we shouldn't be accepting this it's
doesn't happen in other places and I
hope that by people watching our little
films they'll get a little bit of
insight into other structures around the
world and how to like maybe improve
their expectations or to appreciate more
what they've already got but yeah good
to be a completely different set of
problems here to any of the other places
we visited all right guys I've just been
editing and chilling this afternoon and
now we're gonna head out to dinner at
the Green Team
this is this is epic
please check this restaurant out this is
where we're having dinner
boy look there it's a stingray just
chilling in there
we got dinner it turns out and the
sandwich we tried to get was like more
like a pizza okay I'm I'm happy I got
some side vegetables the mashed potatoes
well I still can't get over this place
room this is like I don't know it's this
light of a crazy greenhouse but it's
like the biggest green ounce a little
beaner and it's like actually cold in
here like they put the aircon on so this
would be insane imagine having this
place and just having your own like for
it inside you just set your own climate
so before we head to the party tonight I
thought it's probably important to go to
the hot tub first so that's where I'm
headed right it's just behind me she
needs to wait for some new towels for
our room but I think if I'm correct
we've still got like half an hour before
they close I'm pretty excited about
that was refreshing ready to pull it up
or you can go to the fight like this
night
ah all right party's over
it's the end of day two of playlist um I
am really exhausted I think I only slept
six hours last night I was hoping to get
a little bit of nap this afternoon but
it just didn't happen but it's been good
seeing everyone catching up people the
meetup today was cool and like I said
earlier great to see you guys
and yeah tomorrow's the last day and
then I'm heading off in the evening to
go and join Dave again yeah this has
been good good catch in the morning
peace out into her life live the
adventure
