good morning guys it's almost 5:00 a.m.
we got up at 4 a.m. ready to fly out of
Abu Dhabi today we're heading to
Pakistan and we have JC with us if you
haven't seen the last couple of vlogs
he's flown in from France to come help
Phil and yeah I didn't sleep at all
that's like been gaining I was up
finishing some vlogs and then I was
gonna sleep like an hour and then I just
I focused didn't have time to say I
might have a little nap from the plane
you're excited for the day JC yeah let's
hope that you don't have like a fear of
flying and small flames
we have a small problem
yeah the airport might not have aviation
engine oil for us no thank you
engine oil the third is 15 w 50
aeroshell but whatever you get it no no
I'm leaving in 40 minutes
unfortunately yeah
yeah it's okay I'll figure something out
if not I'll call you again okay thank
you
I can't believe that Abu Dhabi doesn't
have this
what do you think of the plane JC that's
pretty big this is first I'm saying in
real life laughing it's gonna be crazy
yeah you got a first class we're gonna
be serving three males some Oreos some
Pringles yeah to explain the situation
well we we have sort of situation we try
left Austria with six quarts of oil but
at two of it was not compatible with the
oil that we're running right now
well three we only had three quarts left
I have one quote left in the back though
I was worried that because we had a nine
hour flight coming here that we were
gonna have used a lot of oil
and and that we need more because we got
a lot of flights now and I'm not sure
when we get oil and we're in the country
of oil and we can't get oil but luckily
I just checked our levels that we didn't
lose any oil in the last flight so we
should be okay to get to at least India
either in Pakistan or India we'll find
oil that's good news
the we're in the country of oil it is
weird but everywhere like everything
here is - I like nothing they just they
just don't know peasants like us what's
that all our planes different from every
other flight every well to the engine
like we're just cheap no don't say that
about balloon these are the things we
got delivered so we can access out of
some tanks at high altitude and we're
just gonna see if they fit I really hope
they fit yeah perfect
right filling the ferry tank first then
we'll fill the wing tanks settled up
with the money and we are just watching
if the most incredible sunrise it's just
I mean to be fair I never I never am
around for sunrises but this just looks
pretty spectacular to me it's cuz it's
such a smoggy kind of hazy or cool yeah
yeah I'll sign that okay
how's it back there it's okay all right
we need sir

lovely boarding I think we're just about
to break out of there the haze as well
so here it I have just a kid we
literally have to like I'm supposed to
go directly for those buildings but
because we climb so slowly to go this
way though right because we would just
fly straight into the
take the overhead bsl-4 that wind left
exactly one right

is actually the same just like the
photojournalist shooting free throws

there it's just we're too heavy right
now that fulfill okay so we're trying to
keep up that number
yeah spo2 over 90 okay so you guys just
need a path that around every now then
breathe a bunch of oxygen maybe if you
want to like put it on yourself for two
minutes or three minutes and then pass
it on okay like that yeah sure

top is our Arsenal know if it's of
oxygen gonna take you Africa are you an
85 maybe you get you go first
187 the Uni know make sure
you hold it the right way and then make
sure that fall yeah it's pretty much
like on the altitude that we're flying
which is about there so if you just want
to hold it on for a while maybe like one
or two minutes yeah you can put it on
cool oh wow what's up here is went after
84 all right Jay Z's going first because
he's got less oxygen in his blood to be

very fun drive from the airport that was
awesome
I love all the hustle and bustle color
and just so it's just like a visual
overload just getting our room ready
yeah JP he's already conked out and I so
fade he's been working hard today guys I
literally just looked on Google Maps as
I wonder there's anyone to eat round
here and the first restaurant I spotted
is literally look look at this it's like
a castle and it's like it's got like a
rooftop on it that we're gonna we're
gonna head in and check it out no
they're not open yet they're opening at
7:30 but we've asked if we can just run
up to the roof and take some photos
before the Sun completely sets and I
think they're gonna let us see
turns out we can stay here now but
they're just not serving the main dinner
courses until 7:30 so I've asked if we
can just chill up in this spot here
we're just having like a little Buffy
dinner right now
JEP he's just woken up as well and he's
he said can we bring him some food back
so we're gonna bring him back
although we know I'll have to take this
food back because this is the buffet
food they said we need to order another
dish to bring that to him which a bit
weird but you know this is how they do
it in Pakistan
okay we have some takeout food JP just
