hey today I'm here with grace hey and
what you always wanted to learn gross uh
well Japanese probably but this is like
on the top three guys tie-dye oh that's
a quiz today we're learning has a
tie-dye t-shirt and we've got our friend
Lucy here who's an expert by dying
hi the last time I talked I got anything
I think I was like eight years old and I
have no idea what I did Lucy our expert
is gonna now talk us through everything
we need to know about this process so
step one you need to take this it's soda
ash it's a dye fixer so that the colour
stays in the shirts gonna put it in like
the two gallon size of warm water and
soak your shirts in there for 20 minutes
don't eat it
if it is step two is you need to figure
the loves on so that's this doesn't
happen to you
for putting gloves on this videos gonna
go by Road this glove so a positive
don't get all the whole reason that
you're putting the gloves on it so it
doesn't have holes it this is gonna look
way cooler when it's cold I
life's all about dipping some shirts in
some chemicals and then
cien where it takes you
put that on a shirt and then dip it in
some chemicals guys d prefer the vein or
do you prefer the round you prefer the D
step three is to pick the design that
you want to do on your shirt and there's
several different ways that I'm show you
that there's like a twisting motion
there's ones where you can make it
rigged to be do little pinches there's
like all kinds of different
more difficult design but you want to
try and now you're going to actually dye
it so you're gonna take your dyes which
we've made
and basically just spray them on there
it's like thick stuff right totally
but I know on a tarp and everything yeah
your blood splatter analyst it's like
you know very cathartic on a lot of
levels you know yeah you know you see
the ships on TV like put oil in a pan
with one of these things it's like that
I like the purple
the great thing about tie-dyeing is you
can basically make it up as you go along
you can do any design you can just throw
colors all over the place
and it's gonna look cool at the end
everyone is an artist when it comes to
tie-dye maybe yeah on this
yeah
and now for step 5
we are going to wrap our shirts are
readily finished pretty colorful shirts
in plastic bags so that the Dyson's soap
while still waiting for the dye to soak
in it's very important part of the
process to eat brussel sprouts mostly
waiting really hot here get these little
crispy pieces I love my friends don't
like the stress
I hate those people okay you reveal
yours first
okay I'm less confident but what you are
I agree that's just it
look I'm bleeding out of my armpit and I
like this on a scale of one to ten how
likely are you to wear this like like
like a tent it's like a military fun
wait wait you put way too much it is in
the competition and now for step six
we are going to hang the shirts on the
clothesline to dry
and Lily want one job in both legs
strong hey just bright they just
crumbled in my finger it's too exciting
about his shirt they just halt down
broke all the pegs finally for step 7
we are gonna put the shirt dry
but they're actually dry and asipi so
your shirt on
I think my t-shirt looks a little bit
like vomit yeah like a unit one
but that's okay yeah I like the unicorns
yeah if anyone thinks they can do a
better job than us what you should do is
follow the instructions that you've
learned on this video and make your own
tie-dye t-shirt and then send us photos
on Twitter or well those places we want
definitely look at them yeah and I also
filmed a video a fun video on Gracie's
channel yeah so you need guys need to
click on her go and check that out now
Louie was praising people on my channel
it went a solid medium yeah go check it
out and my thing is a good grade and
there's a squirrel over there look I
look like an email guy sitting next to
you which is great
