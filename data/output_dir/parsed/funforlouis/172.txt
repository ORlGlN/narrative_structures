good morning guys is our second day at
this treehouse village in the Dominican
Republic and we're about to head out on
a horse riding Trek to a waterfall it's
going to be pretty epic sweet alright
stop we're going to go get lunch
so this typical Dominican Republic food
rice bean traditional nice
prior we've arrived to the place we're
going to get our horses he's a tiny hood
or just wasn't me lately
Carla get out let's come in Canelo's
with Canelo yeah yes Canelo it feels
kinda weird writing about this book I
think he's strong an outside
and we're not going too far we've got
about half an hour horse ride to the
waterfall and I think this is the best
waterfall on the island that's right
yeah the most incredible waterfall I've
just info open it look okay where you go
the mall I get to ride horses but less I
just want to walk plated I'm like why
would I walk places when I could be
riding a horse
guys it's baby pineapple growing here
that is amazing yeah alright the horse
is going to weigh here how is that
that's good I like horses outside yeah
cuz I think they're mean to someone my
size cuz the big ones are scary like
you're so high up in the ground
I guess if something goes wrong you can
just like top of those I think we've
managed to find a time in the day where
it's not super busy so as things because
we had a really lazy morning Fitz turned
up
it's end up good for us
we've just arrived at the top of the
waterfall this is crazy you literally
just see through the trees hairs up that
is a long drop
I've got a feeling this isn't one of
those places you want to like dangle
your feet off the edge to take photos so
the Dominican Republic is one of the
stop off for a lot of big cruise ships
and they often have like day tours to go
and do activities and I think this is
one of those places people come and stop
off so at certain times of the day this
is kind of rammed with people but we've
just arrived and there's no one here
like this is completely empty set this
out
this must be pretty rare right okay guys
this is my 24 to 40 lens and this gives
amazing versatility you get wide shots
with this and then boom all the way in
has incredible day
the mix coming up the waffles amazing so
refreshing
the guys I brought my little loom food
with me which is fully waterproof
Wow what epic cave is built like a
properly secret cave by where higher
interest find their treasure coming
I just felt something literally my toes
I think it's cramped under there
so as an effing little square I enjoyed
that a lot
that cave so epic
I feel very refreshed having to I'm in
the waterfall I think the last couple of
times I've been to walk fools I kind of
got all down and haven't gotten swimming
and even though it's a bit later in the
day and it's not war but there could be
I couldn't resist
and I do not regret it Oh feel great for
something I love doing when I'm doing
waterfalls or blowing water it's opening
the shots after like half a second and
getting our really still keep blowing
effect
take a mellow have you been
he had a nice little chill time waiting
for us Canelo's very eager
he's like pushed in front of Austin I
don't know where is he's longer this is
what it's all about guys horseback
photography yes I love it this dude is
washing his motorbike on the main road
but he's just study that is on the main
road and not like in a driveway or
something
Thanks
klefki

 yeah this is the best part of being
in the Caribbean hmm yeah
so you're the mascot man slightly better
than what comes out of the campaign yeah
it's just incredible it's like a
completely different drink right back to
the tree houses so I was explaining
yesterday that we last night actually
stayed in one of the tree houses just
some still but what we're hoping tonight
is that we can move to the tree houses
like right at the top of a tree that
we're going to go in there check if it's
ready or not and get a lot of stuff up
there guys this is the tree house I
really want to stay in this can check it
out all right this is your view oh my
gosh waking up in the morning to this is
going to be so cool guys I'll give you a
proper tour tomorrow and it's light but
this is what I'm talking about like it's
built into the tree like everything's
built around this central like living
tree oh my gosh so cool check out this
rhinoceros beetle though he just found
on the floor is he's a big guy yeah
okay we made it back into our little
tree house at the top of the tree and
we're going to go to bed now within
editing down in the main communal area
and yeah this is this has been a really
fun day I can't wait for tomorrow as
well we're going to go out on a boat
ride to a nearby beach and we're going
to go like snorkeling and stuff and like
yeah hang out with some of the other
guests but the main thing I'm looking
forward to is waking up and seeing the
view from up here and yeah I am just
like totally like pumped that we're
staying in a treehouse like this is the
first legit I've seen this the other day
but this is the first legit treehouse
I've stayed in like we've stayed in like
little cabins and things on stilts like
little Hut's and stilts but this is this
