good morning guys
is a sunny day in Cape Town and I have
had a pretty productive morning so far
I've gone on and had a workout with our
personal trainer and I've made my way
into town where I'm gonna be picking up
some equipment for filming some
interview stuff for the documentary so
I'm meeting Nick here who's helping edit
the whole thing and yeah we've arrived
at alms so we're gonna be getting some
some backdrops and some lighting to film
with and I think we're gonna yeah just
to test out some some different products
so guys this is Jason he worked at alms
and he's showing us the gear that he's
gonna lend us for a few days hopefully
products
we're trying to fit the backdrop in the
car yeah I think this is okay we've
loaded up the drivers in we're gonna
head back to Manon Berg now and start
shooting kind of shoot some of these
interviews now we've got all the
equipment we need and then what we got
about 35 before that look good on this
at least then it's at least that's at 50
no that's a 35 but then I'd be sitting
further back good night I know we want
we want the new one the distance so yeah
that works
I'm still like we need to figure out the
lighting I feel like yeah we should we
put the 80 point on it see ya the 85
would look like ice so we can see the
two contrasted the like that lady black
backgrounds were really nice yeah I like
just the black out background I think it
it takes the focus completely into
you're not wondering like you're not
distracted at all the audio is not right
but we're just testing the visuals so
I'm gonna be looking about here and then
we're cutting between the wider shot and
the tight shot and the lighting looks
nice the backgrounds not backgrounds not
showing for something to check for later
is I think maybe one eyes and focus on
one isn't cuz it's that shallow
we could always push it so it's that's
the 2.8 I think so we could push it hi
crazy isn't it let's try it on there
okay guys I've met back up with Raya and
Bridget and we have arrived at Kirsten
and Basha getting that for an amazing
concert Jeremy Loops is playing tonight
I'm super pumped we've got like
backstage access which is good and
it's crowded this is packed tonight
think this sold out a while ago it's
very popular

get here this early last night this is
definitely the calm before the storm if
you haven't seen Jeremy perform for
Ben's here

8:30 or 9:00 or something so things
ended pretty early look how different
the field looks now with like nobody on

we're gonna head down onto the green
I think Jeremy's folks it here he's just
gonna pop a little bottle of champagne
and then we're gonna head over to help
bay exciting news is me and Raya had to
move out of the place that we've been in
in Clermont and we're heading over to
help bay after this to check out this
new house that we're staying in for a
week apparently it's pretty amazing
house that Jeremy's hooked up for us to
stay in so we just stopped past a piece
of place because the band are hungry
there they've done a good job tonight
and I think they deserve all these
pizzas so we're gonna we're gonna get
all those hungry mouths fed this is it's
just where we're staying I'll give you a
full house tour in the next day or so
but I haven't even seen around the house
myself here see later boys so this place
belongs to one of Jeremy's friends he's
an absolute legend and it's kindly just
to stay for the week no way this is cool
you know the sunrise here is next level
and this is where the Sun sets yeah
sunsets literally right over this whole
Bay oh my gosh oh I can't wait at the
end of a pretty epic day cannot believe
we ended up here this is a bit of a
dream that we're in this incredible
house obviously it's been awesome
staying over in Claremont we've got a
bunch of friends over there the LTA
office is over there and Amanda who gave
up her house to let us stay there
Thank You Amanda but also this is pretty
nice as well we're not going to be
staying here for as long Jeremy just
said would need to clear out a Saturday
but we're gonna make the most of it I
cannot wait to just work a bit from here
tomorrow I catch up with vlogs and yeah
taking this view I mean you can't see it
fully now because it's pitch black
obviously but I think it's gonna be
stunning in the morning and yeah if you
don't know Jeremy's music and you like
the sound of it
get to know it I'll link his new album
that he's launched below you can go
check that out and I think Ben's gearing
up to go and tour them I'm sure he'll be
dropping some vlogs and yeah me and
Jeremy might be scheming up some video
projects at some point yeah I'm looking
forward to our time which seems to be
slow you know slowly running out in Cape
Town

here another two weeks anyway I'll keep
you updated I'll let you know how we're
getting on with the edit for the Beyond
Borders documentary and yeah I'll catch
