hi guys I'm Alan I'm from the West of
Ireland and you're watching fun for
Louie top of the mornin to ya good
morning guys
I am in a bit of a rush this morning I'm
heading to the train station and I am
going into London to meet out my friend
Nick I'm probably gonna miss my train
we have stopped off for a little coffee
in my favorite coffee shop in London the
student cafe
and some of you may remember when I was
in Italy cooking calm contact with me
and sent us on a little adventure
well now back in London they've done it
again and they're sending me and Nick to
do some challenges today so we're
getting sent some tweets and clues to
where we should be going today but the
riddle they sent me is you can always
bank on an adventure
by the river any questions just holler
so new it's a South Bank but I needed
more specific and more specific location
so I think it's at the South Bank Centre
because there's an exhibition by some
artists whose last names Hollow so I'm
checking now I think this is it guys so
we got our tickets to this exhibition
make I'm having some issues get my bag
in the locker it doesn't is the tiniest
Locker in the world this is Louis best
Locker round one come on Louie we are in
the tunnel boy when we arrived I had no
idea that's what seems to be some
interactive exhibition a little bit of
wonder
like stuff like flying around
whoa
they're actually falling from the
ceiling I didn't understand upside-down
goggles apparently
you let like a stormtrooper with
dreadlocks they travel towards over here
we are now entering a section with a
slide
do you need a deleted stack Thanks like
this
whoa thanks I kind of snake kick I found
a snake
my only phobia is snakes apparently the
names lied oh no I think it's my dear
clue guys it's might be a clue where we
going
so we're taking a little break for lunch
and you know try to figure out what this
clue means something to do the lie
though which is the swimming pool so
guys I tweeted the clue out and the
first response and someone called Jack
it's suggesting it's the serpentine in
Hyde Park which also is confirmed when I
type in lied a serpentine comes up so I
think I think that is it because you
know serpent cheer Larry which is Nick
mains of a rides got some tagliatelle
would you get there Nick well Nora
and I've added chicken to it all right
Lloyd Oh
on bikes
I wanna get I got these guys
I think horses abandoned bikes Nick why
don't we get horses guys it started
raining cycle in the brain guys I did
not expect that I'm singing in the rain
just singing in the rain by the world
the fulfilling and happy again
we go swimming drugs and we're gonna
head into the lies oh I've never been
hit son as we were arriving we got
another tweet explaining that somewhere
in this Lake area there is a little
rubber duck and we have to take a selfie
with it and tweet it to get the next
clue
so we're going for a little swim find
the rubber
right I tweeted a selfie of me and Nick
with the rubber duck so we're just
waiting for a response and we're going
to get a little drink what's your right
we've been tweeting the next clue
and this is it you have a decision to
make a cup of tea or a coffee in an
underground toilet
we're not yanking your chain I didn't
know what that meant but luckily Nick
nose would admit I did and he's heard of
it it's basically this cafe that being
converted from an old Victorian
underground toilet so I googled it and
we're heading there now
yeah you sit you sit in your I know to
drink coffee yeah
guys we found it the attendant let's
gonna check it out that's gonna get
coffee apparently they have something
for me what do you have for me they have
a picture of me performing his
sensational new poem what is this
I had to perform a poem at a bar tonight
and 9:30 after show hot tub
wow this is cool guys check out this
place these are old urinals that are
turned into little little tables to
drink coffee yet
so we're chilling here for a little bit
there's lots of clubs JEP come join us
he's still in London for one more day
and then we're both independently going
to New York Torres you know you see
these girls all the friends in New York
still the company opening yeah anyway
also boy what gathered was about this is
it is what it looks like I'm booked into
due to the forms tonight before my poets
I've never performed and failed to carry
them in my life so it turns out it's
going here what's your name Josh works
in it randomly is a poet so he's gonna
help you write a poem
before they play at least roll the dice
so I see let's see how it goes
what a great your coffee shop
all right we've got a few hours until my
big baby my big performance so we're
going to go fighting to eat a little bit
maybe go for a little cycle again that's
right
time for a curry I'm gonna try the
Aladdin restaurant thank you
Thanks yes all right
we left the hurry house also guys this
is where my bag was stolen from do you
remember those looks just hit laptop
passport hard drive camera everything my
whole life done anyway we're now heading
we walked over to the bedroom bar which
is the venue where I'm supposed to
perform a poem be honest I don't get
nervous about many things but I'm
nervous because I'm not a performer I'm
not really a poet
and I'm just not passionate about it you
know if I was passionate about it it's
like a big dream of mine but I just
needed to overcome the fear then I'd be
more into it but I just feel like it's
just a challenge I'm just gonna have to
do even if it's just horribly awkward
and then these guys are going to support
me on it nope no support whatsoever
this is business support from JB ready
ready for this I just gotta get ready
this is really awkward silence I don't
think it'll be funny that's what he's
gonna do after I've read my poem the
theme of today in the challenge is and
like this event around London was
winging it right and tonight I do really
feel like a winging it I got a poem from
the from the coffee shop guys the
barista I've also tweeted out saying the
last minute he would tweet me your poem
and it's worked I've got a couple so I
think I'm gonna play on that theme of
rolling the dice and and reading random
poems of Twitter the ladies before me
it's finished so I'm apparently going on
stage now no preparation
you say roll the dice my dice are loaded
I live on Wi-Fi I try to know my path
wander down the road less traveled with
a little extra view with all the cards
on the table I'm able to beat my best to
rest easy on the knowledge that this was
a Thomas worth taking the risk this is
amazing as a dice rolled the clock
ticked attacked ripped the scales tipped
and I sat and listened I think the
automatic our lives that like the pitch
and once we paint it when we like around
six years old but at the point we have
not yet come to realize that life is a
roll of the dice you tell a cheese you
only guess is the spice of life now that
my challenge is completed on this flyer
that I was handed earlier it basically
said after show hotdogs at sanctum Soho
you'll find it on the birthing comm app
