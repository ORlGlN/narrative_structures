my name's oli in the beautiful Yorkshire
countryside and you are watching fun for
Louie enjoy boom good morning guys
we slept well and we're now heading
together but now heading to get some
breakfast mainly mainly coffee though
Bailey coffee and then we're going to go
in a bit of it explore we haven't made
much of a plan today but there's a bunch
of people we want to catch up with and
this is only like David's like second
time in New York time so there's plenty
of stuff to show her
me and David finished most of our work
we're going to drop my bags off all pick
our bags up and go somewhere else we
don't really know where were staying
tonight but we're gonna sort that out
and then we are heading to B&H the
camera shop where I'm going to look at
some different lenses and microphone to
the camera and yeah just have a chill
day around New York yeah it's down there
we have our bags and we've just booked
another hotel around the corner it's
actually right by Brooklyn Bridge so I'm
hoping we do some awesome nighttime
shots we're gonna record a video for
later later for Dave on with a hope so
it's gonna be fun a little rooftop
poetry yeah
poetry is a funny word in it I like it
man when I hear poetry much we should
find a slam poetry night tonight we
should I'd love that I would love that
hey what
thank you we've dropped our bags off for
the new hotel now I need to get some
lunch
oh yeah we're gonna check out the roof
first see we can film a thing you later
guys the roof door says it's alarmed but
I don't know what fully believed it so
we're gonna give it a test the alarm
could go off in which case I'm just
gonna go downstairs and apologize to up
to the lady interception Oh Dave well no
thanks I'll browse really ready oh
that's good no alarm
I think we're here it elicits excited
Wow then we might begin
it's not that higher roof no turn that
brick upside down
so it got a rip well let's try it's
quite loud up here but let's just sit
over there let's see weapons
the bride taking the bridge oh yes
so let's see how boy
guys I think we found on poetry spot our
prize you don't even understand how good
this is
yeah that's your spot Dave we should do
this later okay we should go
that's a cool game run guys I am trying
out some different lenses on the Sony
this is a 24 to 240 so the normal one
I've been vlogging on is a twenty eight
is twenty-four to 240 check this out so
this is wide and then I can zoom in on
this I feel like this might be more
stable Netherlands as well we think this
is the twenty eight mill which is lower
this is a tube this is a picture of two
and the other ones like 3.5 so nothing
behind should be blurrier right now this
is the lens I usually use guys this is a
12 mil lens yeah maybe yeah basically it
doesn't always which is pretty useless
cuz that's what I need I'm trying out
anyway I quite like the extra white the
Zilla wife it looks fishy made that fish
it looks a bit GoPro to me there's more
GoPro but it should be good depth of
field other night I prefer the old I
don't know I think we're gonna stick
with their mic like from the 24 - boy
this is a waterproof case can take
underwater
finally saw it it's time to eat guys let
my state
yes my state
I'll show you guys that last guy you
know there and check this out he plugged
straight into the iPhones they don't
even needs me or blipping laptop with
you
we can just be anywhere and just on
casting out yeah we win a little
overkill on the food hopefully wheel
why excited
black bean burger tastes like
back at the hotel I'm gonna go and try
and film this cheeky little poetry video
dating on the roof so I've got my new
tripod I'm gonna be filming this Dave's
got his little camera for a second angle
and his new mic that he's excited about
yes bro you ready for this bro
yeah that's nice to go good quality
we're done with our recording but we did
I think it will still work
it looks pretty good and it's pretty
awesome piece of writing that this city
can sneak out all right we're all done
with our filming on the roof now we're
gonna head to this poetry slam that they
found nearby wow that is like 10 police
cars driving past let
drive
- okay and you're gonna dance
now moving over my bed he was seven
we live in Cheka Cheka you
we've left the little poetry slam which
turned out more to be like an open-mike
rap night which is it was cool there's
some there's some real characters there
we're now taking a long stroll back to
the hotel I'm thinking we can like walk
along the river if we get tired we can
always get an uber halfway but this is
cool I like walking around New York at
night did you enjoy the night Dave yeah
I loved it man wide variety from like
semi-pro so like leave some he'll
probably need some psychological health
some people had some issues man yeah but
that was good
maybe this is good for the newness yeah
what I quite liked is it seemed like a
very accepting group of people like that
everyone was encouraged whether they
were talented or not it was like a real
family and this one kid who said he's 17
and it's at first open mic night had
done just seemed really emotional then
these who like just really thankful sit
is like the best night ever so I found
that and they're pretty awesome I like
the openness man yeah it's good
that's how I roll they've been calling
some poetry under here how's it going
Dave Oh bro you naked and they could be
holed up in it then bro but about yeah
but it's good for audio yeah possibly
you taught me this one man sound but
yeah little thing I've used in the past
that is long six and a half minutes yeah
it's long when you put that up bro
tomorrow yeah yeah guys it will be up by
the time you watch this video then check
out his latest piece of writing it's
pretty cool it's pretty cool it's pretty
gnarly yeah well it's just some kind of
out there thinking I've never really
thought about any of that stuff you're
talking about
it's good stuff Dave Dave's
experimenting quite a bit on his channel
every video picks up is actually
completely different from the last video
so this is awesome he's also pissed the
end of the night it's actually quite
late it's like 3:30 but me and David
both still on West Coast time say we're
not tired but we should try and get in
the New York Times own so we can enjoy
the day and not sleep in I think
tomorrow we're gonna be going to the UN
either during the day or probably
definitely in the evening with some
party we've been invited to I'm also
trying to catch up with KC tomorrow
Jesse's in town so we'll see him at some
point and Jerome as well I don't know
where he's at
we would potentially suppose to be
staying with him tomorrow night
but who knows people are the track yeah
right sleep time like babe peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure
