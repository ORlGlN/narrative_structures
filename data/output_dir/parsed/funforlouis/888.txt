hi my name is Ellen and I live in
Ontario Canada and you're watching fun
for Louie boom good morning guys
I actually slept quite well if you can
remember I slept in that surfboard case
which is quite well insulated so it was
a good night's sleep and now we're
having breakfast together as a family
party time
coffee yeah Coffee please how did you
guys sleep I see yeah like this choice
is correct with a hard-boiled egg take a
little bit off the back a little it off
the top yeah I guess no oh my gosh I'm
gonna try yeah that's amazing
everyone go and try that go into the pod
world and egg you're in trouble
Yeah right I'm trying this trick out
I've taken the shell of each end so you
just put your mouth over and blow it
yeah yeah and then you're holding the
shoal in
the guys were packing up our stuff and
for the last like hour I've been looking
for my glove and I think I may have left
him over here when I was doing some
photos last night doing some time lapse
photos I was looking everywhere by
turning the bat up slow down was like
looking in my bag and then eventually
walked up the road to the security desk
and after than anyone had handed them in
and they had they found my glasses on
the floor and handed them in so I'm so
grateful whoever this man it's not I
wasn't counting that but they'd actually
have been handed in but someone was very
nice and did that so if you ever find
something that's not yours looking
around on the floor and then always hand
them in all right Alec cpu's whilst the
guys continue packing and getting their
stuff stored I'm gonna go down to the
lake which this whole festival was like
riding the edge of a lake because we got
here late last night I didn't really see
much of where we are so I'm going to
wonder down and have a look
there's something very fun about daytime
raving oh I'm getting hot there I need
to drink

ridiculing me every gonna kill me go
away yes all our operatives give me good
guys this is my back this is what
happens when you don't use some cream
I've done this a million times in my
life but and he's kindly put this teto
in the freezer water and it back down
and just suggested um putting this like
auntie burn thing on my back although
it's not super extreme and these sheets
are usually for like extreme burns
I think Amit yeah this is a little bit
overkill but we're gonna try it anyway
adults I want to use it yeah good and
that's all we've got so so because we
haven't got any aloe vera or any other
kind of off the Sun we're gonna go over
the top and put this on my back
actually looks like a bra so that will
seem very dramatic but like I said it is
a little overkill it's not necessary but
I'm sure it's going to do a lot of good
point back
I've been moisturizing as well and I've
got a freshly shaved face and I think
I'm going to keep it pretty pretty
freshly shaved for the near future maybe
I'll grow beard back at some point but
I'm feeling good other than other than
the sunburn I'm feeling good guys it's
been refreshing today and I just feel in
a really good mood and I'm excited for
the coming weeks and if we get to go and
meet the guys up in their road trip see

peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure boom
