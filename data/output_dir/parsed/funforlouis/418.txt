good morning guys today we've come down
to ruffle a beach in New York to take
part in a beach clean-up day it's
actually celebrating 10 years of the
barefoot wine beach rescue project I
don't know if you remember last year in
LA we were working with barefoot wine
and the Surfrider Foundation and it's
happening again this year it's actually
happening in 11 different countries and
people are working together to keep
their beaches barefoot friendly and I'm
excited to take part today here in New
York we're gonna get later on some clips
from different countries to see what
they're doing and to include in this
video I'm gonna show you what's
happening but it's it's great to be part
we've actually got a load of volunteers
that's showing up we're about to walk up
and down the beach just waiting all the
litter and Vince the plastic that gets
left out here and hopefully to encourage
you guys as well that this is important
to people beaches clean guys check out
this 360 camera this is like the $50,000
one it's nuts isn't it
for those of you that haven't met Louie
in real life to seek to get that
perspective he's six foot five so this
is like the big bag of her
I think the size of our bag may have
been a little bit too ambitious I think
we're gonna feel about 1/100 of it
we're doing a massive group photo now
we've collected most the trash litter
free massive bags were filled up and now
with all these surfboards which spell
out world Beach rescue today

perfection you really want to just spend
a few minutes and thank you guys what
you guys did today everyone coming out
on a Saturday afternoon Saturday morning
and spending this Saturday with us to
make the world a better place through
wine is important
what I want to do is raise a toast so
let's raise the toes on behalf of
leaving our only footprints barefoot
wine has been an amazing partner they've
enabled us at Surfrider Foundation to do
so much good around the world so we
couldn't be happier to be here and thank
you our Surfrider activists are
first-time activist those who came out
to Rockaway for the first time we're
coming out here and making a difference
that's not easy to do but it feels great
right we're about to head off from the
party but before we do I want to let you
guys know how you can get more involved
with supporting what's been going on
today basically Surfrider's is this
incredible organization a nonprofit
that's been protecting the world's
oceans and waves and beaches for years
now and barefoot wine have been
supporting them you guys can help
barefoot wine to pour them even more by
firstly if you've been out there on the
beaches today doing your own beach
cleanup post a photo and hashtag world
beach rescue day
and for every hashtag used there for
wine our gonna donate $1 to Surfrider
Foundation if you haven't been out there
and you have been able to do it actively
what you can do is go over to my Twitter
and retweet the tweet that I posted
today and every retweet they also can
gonna donate $1 and I've got a funny
story from last year basically we did
this they underestimated how many of you
are gonna we're gonna support this and
read through the tweet and they donated
$5 for every retweet and I got 63
thousand retweets on the tweet and this
year they're gonna cap it at a hundred
thousand dollars so it doesn't get too
out of hand but it's still pretty
awesome and yeah I'll link everything
below you can see how to get more
involved and find out more about what's
going on and I just think it's great
that we come together as this global
force today and and get behind something
so great and I think this is a
continuing thing we all need to learn
how to live more sustainably use less
plastic especially when we're outside
and there's a bunch of ways that we can
yeah just just do better for the oceans
rise making a video today and she's
going to be listing some other ways that
we can protect the oceans that we are so
dependent on really awesome right
try it Briah where are we going now
we're going to stop yo that's my mom
lives and it requires EMF ugly and
everything's great and we're catching
the train
nice
all right we're staying up in some
beautiful cabins up in Woodstock and
some of them in Rio have been talking
about for a while is whether I'm going
to be able to make friends with her dog
Sophie so I'm working on it it's gonna
take some time
I just gave her some snacks so she I
think she likes me a little bit more I
think it's gonna take a few more hours
just for her to the class tonight
some dogs completely freak out when they
see me and they were like never be my
friend but she's she's all right Sophie
just doesn't trust men right away
because I think she said takes a little
while to figure out if you're a good guy
or not
well guys we had a lovely dinner with
Ryan's parents and I'm slowly making
some progress with Sophie she's not as
scared of me aren't you Sophie she's let
me strike and stuff but I'm gonna carry
on tomorrow and make some progress
today's been an amazing day in New York
it was so good to get involved with the
barefoot wine and Steph riders thing
earlier the world Beach rescue day and
already you know I've shown you that
tweet or the hashtag 1500 people have
retweeted said that's $1500 raised if
you want to I'm gonna link the tweet
below you can go over and retweet that
and get involved like you're saying
earlier posting pictures of you cleaning
your local Beach and yeah this is this
is the world movement guys we're in it
together and yeah it's exciting I'm
gonna get some rest now this is like the
perfect place in Woodstock to just take
