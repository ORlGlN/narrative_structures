hi I'm Stephanie from where I'm carolien
Pisa
you're watching thunder Louie boom good
morning guys I have arrived at zeitgeist
it's 8 a.m.
I've got my coffee and I'm ready to head
in which is the front of the building
this is where everyone's coming through
and there's a main hall in there that's
where the main sessions are happening
but like I showed you guys yesterday
this is this is where I'm based there's
all these little exhibitions and cool
stuff happening super cool technology
it's basically all of googles cool kind
of technology wings and things projects
they're working on and this is the
YouTube bit and this is where all the
360 videos I'm one of like 5 360 videos
or something they're showing on this
3/16 wall
and then as people come out in and out
of the sessions I'm going to be like
checking them through what I've filmed
how it all works and well I'm like
hammer works
for questions and stuff
so guys this is the Google John brick
this is 16 GoPros check that out this is
the one I use this is only this is only
for GoPro so the dotted color lenses
check this guy out
seriously that looks like a lot of
effort to sugar
imagine if every time I shoot 360
hey let's go is just me and it smeared
the big screen this is weird
a nice size Louie that's crazy
get this out this is my Romania 360
how sick is that this is how we're all
going to be watching YouTube in the
future I'm going to be sitting in the
middle of our living room we're gonna be
like spinning around looking everything
everyone's gonna have projectors on
their ceiling
guys I'm gonna have a go there check
this out you get your photo taken and
then this little robot draws your takes
an image you have the contrast to
generate a scribble and then the
scribble is plotted from a series of
points on line that the two wheels
install on a triangular path
sweets to the pen is your rag is it all
within this yeah YouTube within here so
no Android phone actually controls
everything okay so the phone talks to
this low-level Hardware here that is the
image guys that's what it's gonna look
like and that talks for this yo-yo board
you have to controls the motors and then
these crucial stepper motors moving
shapes to position themselves rather
amazing
- guys this is it started I can see some
of my dreads already up here there are
young guys I think the further back you
go the more you recognize that and then
you go in closing it's just like this is
what I need to do next guys underwater
360s I'm gonna I'm gonna be underwater
guys this is a nice she is the one that
invited me she's like my sister and
we're gonna head off and get some lunch
now we've got a good morning we
introduce a lot of people to the whole
360 video thing we as the people that
came to see yeah yeah I kind of had an
embarrassing moment where I didn't
realize that the guy literally second in
command that YouTube I'd like say do you
do much stuff you do good like what yeah
so guys I'm going to try out this wing
project is to do it like drone
deliveries so I just ordered something
here
I'll get some juice
that's me Wow
so it just tracks the location of where
you are yeah you can say deliver to
where I am right now yeah I mean if
you're not evolving to be in a park
walking down the street or because the
delivery timing is so precise we move
down to the second we could say
I'll be there in two minutes to go over
there
Wow just in time wherever you need it
so I think the concept is that this may
be the future of how deliveries are made
quick deliveries with small items I
guess you'd have liked who take up
through that like emergency response
things it's done very much at these
communities but yeah yeah yeah yeah here
we go guys
the trains arrived
it's not away that is awesome
period wow that's fast
there's my juice guys perfect throwing
that deliver the juice new update noise
you know I told you that it's a lot of
important people that come to this event
but Kanye West's have shown up and we're
trying to get to come and experience the
magic of 360 in virtual reality of
Jackson
I think he's doing a talk later in the
main room everyone's quite excited I
just walked past the speaker's lounge
Kanye West just chilling in there I
didn't want to be paparazzi and start
like filming it Mustafa but he's just
chillin Kanye just finished his little
talk and I managed to get a little
selfie with him I'm gonna insert that
into the video now that was one of the
only times I've run up to someone and
asked for a selfie and I got it and he
looked at the Camry goes diaper camera
man so he approves he approves it my
vlogging camera here we are at a grand
dinner point of overwhelming because I
realized in this group of a few hundred
people these are the most important
people in the world by important in
terms of
any other
crazy guys look how fancy this is so
many different sets of cutlery three
different glasses this is serious
Wow
brother was with the girlfriend no
English
his love
yes yes bro
Wow what a night it has been such a good
day today guys
just bizarre like really overwhelming I
think being surrounded by so many
incredible like well-positioned powerful
people in the world and being amongst
just like a couple of hundred of
probably yeah just like the most I don't
want to use the word important but it
really is like these people like the
heads of the biggest companies the the
decision makers of the world that are
like like genuinely changed things and I
really again don't know how I ended up
here but I just feel so privileged and
just like so out of my depth as well I
need to get better at networking they
like I need to research about all these
cool people that are changing the world
if I want to be someone that's being a
part of something that changes the world
I should at least find out about the
other people on that doing stuff pretty
much bigger scale than me yeah that are
actually changing the world I've got one
more day left here and I'm gonna try and
be on form I'm gonna be truck try and be
like really on it tomorrow I didn't feel
informed that today I feel a bit a bit
out of it anyway I'll stop chain but you
know I'm I can't help it it's it's
exciting and I've got no one here to
like me sharing this with like if Dave
was here this would be way better just
because me and Dave like bounce off each
other in social situations and you know
but next time next time hopefully anyway
I'll see you guys in the morning for the
next day of zeitgeist peace out enjoy
life and live the adventure burning
