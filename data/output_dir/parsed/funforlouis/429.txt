Louise last roundup video and some
people saw the last roundup video where
he's like Bam Bam Bam Bam is like
freaking cracked for blogging it was
ridiculous

want to start a club so we've been
working for the last couple months on
trying to build out the idea to think
about what that can mean and I want to
show you something that we're launching
right now which is not like you know the
big launch is just the beginning of a
new chapter which I want everybody to be
able to be a part and that is live the
adventure club so this is the first
iteration of trying to build
like represent digitally what is already

heading off on a road trip after this

guys will be cruising road tripping home
making a content because like loads of
you already vlogging right now and so I
want to just walk you through really
quick what we're doing here and how you
guys can be involved we are currently
working on trying to figure out our
partnership with a guy who actually
built funforlouis matcom of his own man
and started to you're taking all of
Louie's videos and I've met with him
recently from New Zealand and we're
trying to figure out a way to do that
and build it out so that it would work
for everybody's videos so sweet idea and

of affairs like a summit where you guys

I'm I'm ad onto the Instagram wall that
they printed some hits in canvas oh my
gosh yeah

Steve sit on with the only British guy
in the world yeah we are back with Josh
how you find a big gun dude honestly my
first VidCon experience it's like mind
blowing only one of the reasons why is
because all the youtubers get together
as a group and it's so weird seeing them
all together there's no drama row it's
all positive having fun and it gets
pretty wild in the bank off scenes yeah
well it's like one big family and
welcome to the family we're going to
some crazy place and I don't even know
what's gonna we have now come to a
YouTube dinner most awesome vibe sunset

looking good to this boy things--if

ready to talk business
guys with back and I wanted to show you
something that was talking about earlier
in our panel this is a website called
fun foolery map comm where a guy called
Brady of his own back has geo tagged
some of my videos on a map you can click
on these and see different videos we
would love long-term to integrate this
into live event rock club where you guys
can have your own profile and link your
own videos but we need some help Brady
needs to geotag some more videos so we
would love people that want to volunteer
and help out to reply below to ideas at
Libby Adventure Club and we can get a
few volunteers to help out that would be
awesome
it's quite late right now it's actually
a 5 a.m. I haven't finished my vlog I
think I'm gonna have to catch up my
vlogs after VidCon to be honest guys I'm
going to try and throw out two a day to
catch out myself but I just realized
today I this only happens once a year
there's so many people I love and I want
to spend time with and I want to stay up
all night people and the sacrifice is
getting my vlogs out on time and I'm I'm
okay with that sacrifice if you guys are
it means I don't have to stay in and
miss parties to get edits done I know
some of the other guys daily vlogging
I've had to do that tonight and I just
it's too valuable to me spending time
with people so it may felt like another
very random day kind of running around
trying to film the chaos and do the
things I need to and try and recover a
little bit you know this is all
exhausting but I'm very happy and
I'm loving seeing people and it's all
just great life's great at the moment
and I hope you guys are having a good
time as well I hope life's good for you
guys
I will see you tomorrow morning for I
think this might be the final full day
of VidCon tomorrow I've got long me up
I'm looking forward to it and looking
forward to meeting you guys
peace out into your life and live the
adventure
