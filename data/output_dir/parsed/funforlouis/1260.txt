hi I'm Nessa
I'm from Fairbanks Alaska and you're
watching one for Louie
enjoy
I'll come back down into town to the
youth hostel I'm gonna get some lunch
Adela
look at this incredible food that is a
chicken burger what do you got Ella time
traveling style fruit juices this is an
amazing place you're looking full stuff
that was so good
that's a Philly yeah Louie hasn't
actually quite finished the Beast of
Sandwich that you went for no chart it
suited me but I oh yeah
my men'll are gone for a little drive to
find these waterfalls with the crystal
cascades right
I feel like it could go horribly wrong
oh that's wicked so cool
it's so unrealistic movies when they
like swinging combine divine right you
know father I know how whoa
how does even growing like that
we need to find a rubber ring or a Lila
or something
ASAP right we've made a plan we are
going to drive and try and find a little
rubber dinghy because that river looks
too awesome to not go on a rubber dinghy
adventure down there so hopefully we can
find a shot with rubber dinghy that's
close by I think it's pretty good plan
we had a good plan let's make a good
River ready to rumble let's do this
let's do it yes we got them we got two
only $15 each Eliz going to find some
insect repellent and I've got foot pump
out and I'm going to start plating the
first thing is
we get a little tiny little pump I think
I'm winning the race I'm cheating a
little bit this sir starting to fill up
Eliz not doing is quite as well one down
one to go
we've got these oars just screwing them
together Louise found a new girlfriend
in Carnes we've got some beautiful
scenery all as well we're ready we're
ready to go on our adventure it's quite
late in the day so whoo things were
worried about could get very dark we
could end up boating into the night and
also we could end up in a lake of
infested with crocodiles Lake Placid we
saw road signs for is actually just down
the road which way do from today how to
do that yeah this is awesome how are you
feeling Ella feeling excited a bit
nervous at all so I think we're gonna be
okay so just before we set off we
realized mine's already punctured
so I ran back to the car to get some
chewing gum we'll find some cellar table
to me
turns out they came with their own
puncture repair kits so I'm going to
quickly repair the panel before we go
let's do this okay this is amazing what
we should have got to us
oh no not it cluttered
Ella's gonna try and squeeze under
liquid it's very ambitious Ella you do
it don't punch your everything you know
just watch out for the spiders yeah
okay we're abandoning that plan
Oh
toting stuff hello just source nightmoon
wait
sameen eller have come to the conclusion
that if we were crocodiles we might
possibly live here which is a little bit
worrying because the water is quite deep
and it's quite murky and there's lots of
crocodiles in this area how are you
going to pick up a crocodile Bela just
hit on the head
I hope there's not venomous
this is sorry
so we broke my camera in the water but
we had an amazing adventure we survive
with no crocodile attacks and we've now
picked out my friend a rancher and we're
going to go to some dinner because we
definitely worked up an appetite evading
crocodiles we have found an Indian
restaurant are very excited for carrying
right now I love curry so much it's
gonna be later we have met out with juju
as well
hey you're looking forward to curry
I'm very much looking forward to come
you need to get your curry on because
