hey guys I'm doing another 360 video
this time I'm in Tahoe with Dottie and
Kevin and Dave and we are walking along
the edge of lily Lake and the forest
it's pretty epic have a look around to
the trees I'm pretty out of breath cuz
we were quite high altitude what am how
high we like 7,200 feet whoa yeah I just
feel incredibly unfit how you how are
you holding up Dave I was gonna say I'm
glad to hear we're so high cuz I'm
wondering why I couldn't breathe
these trees are epic Wow guys look up
the cup words this day's give me a good
hug funky tree man
tree huggers been here a while what's up
that home bro he's big isn't he yes I
love them watching my troubles drift
away though the lyrics oh oh whoa oh wow
this is why it's cool Lily Lake oh this
is awesome
oh yeah sitting on the dock on the lake
guys if you look across the lake over
this way you might see in the distance
there's a Beaver's dam I've never seen a
beaver is a wobble oh yeah he doesn't
slow-mo yeah totally the wind the net
that's not a seagull is it yeah wow that
is really cool man yeah yeah he's a
stalk isn't what he delivers babies
right come here my hog man
I know 7-under gonna go for a little
balancing guy long let's look look oh I
don't follow my cameras
he hit first she's great
wow this is my kind of Lake man yeah
yeah is this a kind of layer on 11 days
love - love - I need a xxx black to be
fair they should be pretty ideal because
we could build the tree houses in there
in the trees and we can have water wars
in the Middle where you knock each other
off whoa are there many forest fires
around here yeah yeah - seventy thousand
acre ones going on
never I'd see ferns I feel like various
Olivia
Wow this wasn't the way we came was it
amazingly
no this tree stump looks good too many
ones so this little dam down here this
is a man-made thing is it yeah and what
what's the purpose why did it why they
done that do any of you guys know why
they would have built this dam I don't
really understand
that's okay almost I think also the
surface is the lace bit choppy because
this really
we've now hiked over to this little
Ridge have a little look over the edge
the little waterfall here I think in the
winter it's flowing a bit stronger than
this
I am I dropped a little lens cap down
the waterfall but it's too slippery I
was going to try and climb down to get
it but there's no chance she's way too
dangerous also now on the lake here
there's an island and there's a house on
the island which is pretty awesome so
you can move okay check that out I'll
admit I'm gonna try and find the other
guys Wow look at this tree stump
that is amazing how epic is that so
swirly the patterns are crazy oh yeah
there's a better view of the island guys
we are now in dotty and Kevin's goat pen
and we are playing with the goats
that's Odin that massive billy goat over
there this is Olaf were these guys names
did they like with all the skins Isabel
yeah
big ugly British blue yeah yes bro
yes they're like mountain goats
basically yeah so we want we wanted to
put these structures up here because
normally you have to like trim their
hopes like once every three months but
they play so often that they're going to
naturally wear there
didn't you say as well that their their
cashmere goats Kashmir so you get a
special type of comb so all goats have
this outer coat that's like it's like
this long like more like giving it is
really soft inner cashmere

on the ground we put banana peels on him
whether they'll come and take a moment -
chomp on his hair yeah me Mike
