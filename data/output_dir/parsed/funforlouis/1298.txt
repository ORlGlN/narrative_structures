shopping centres really overwhelming
I just go into camera shop and I'm
looking around I see different options
really for blocking can birds and deer
Salathe stuff seeing of this this better
camera stuff
your blog with its lens
so me and Rachel over split up she's got
to do some of her Christmas shopping
take some of those things off her list
and she's told me I should go find a
book shop and browse some of the books
you guys suggested I read a few days ago
wrote through this text of it
this definitely sums up my opinion on
Christmas shopping how did you shop and
go Rachel
so apparently this chicken dish is
hotter than vindaloo so hoping
this blows
tonight me and Rachel Matheson cookies
she's gonna teach me how to make cookies
I like the cider ninja britman you're
just gonna get anime no more
alright snot if we are making some
Christmas cookies for rector's neighbors
and how do we do this Rachel I don't
know I've never made Christmas cookies
with what we think first then we're
making the dough and then the dough has
to rest for like 2 hours okay
and this takes a long time yeah but what
greed is well cinnamon and ginger and
cloves in there swimming in Gingerbread
okay because we bought this guy
oh yeah it's guy breaks wasn't fooling
me we made three of these brown sugar 6
tablespoons of butter
this is flour
this is flour so I just suck yeah yeah
get closer yeah
oh come on something that we should be
fully done that the star Easter they
prefer you're gonna show us how neatly
you've been keeping your work bench yeah
it's important to stay very tidy in CLE
so this isn't a great example but it's
you know that's the creative lemon
ginger bread mixture shortbread mixture
now we're making chocolate chip cookies
to see the Sun mixing these pieces all
ready to rumble
why the flour everywhere this is flour
we are now adding these chocolates I
better taste these just take them all
right like the mix is ready we're now
going to clear up right the kitchen is
relatively clean and now we are doing
this thing we need to stay in the middle
for work to do this is to work with skin
look good sweetie even together
yeah
