hi my name is Tia
I'm from New Zealand and you're watching
from below II so it's been a bit of a
late start for the day I've been sitting
in beds editing and Rachel's being super
awesome and cook some late breakfast
this looks amazing I'm popping up to Mia
with my friend Lily and some other girls
for a coffee and it's been a super chill
day today I mean I guess most my week
has been but today especially I'm
feeling good I'm feeling arrested very
interested this is Lily and K and we
were getting coffee that's nice I'm now
gonna put some food
but irony we get to a vegetarian place I
hope you guys have been sharing yes okay
we've arrived in a place called Surrey
Hills and this is apparently like the
hipster capital is it a hipster capital
of Sydney yeah so that's cool
I was impressed about vegetarian food
baskets
right we're on the way to go out skating
near the Harbour Bridge and oh and this
is a this is a very narrow road look at
this guy and everyone's confused they're
very bad drivers in Australia this guy
okay yeah do it well on the curb you can
do it slowly
yeah you don't even need to out the
curve this Centurion
what is this road what is going on this
is this is chaos and chaos you're gonna
drive please learn how to drive that's
my advice
meet the skater crew are you a good
skater Rachel have you ever skated
before
what you doing you don't hug it you
supposed to fill in the floor
so I skate back up to the car and I'm
coming down to pick up Rachel because
would have taken a bit longer walking up
with the longboard and we are heading to
the cinema to see Hunger Games - I'm
really excited I am
very excited pretty good film kind of
ended abruptly I guess for the next
episode it feels good it's good yeah we
have to stop it was an emergency we had
to stop and get methanol because we're
hungry and something I didn't know
Australia still do that double Big Mac
that they banned in America because you
know supersize me got that Big Mac bands
that had double Big Mac they've still
got an Australia mega Mac so I had to
get one do you have a McDonald's and
then at the time you're like oh this is
a good idea
and after did you like that's that's how
I feel but I am also excited and I may
not seem excited but I am because I
think that day I'm uploading this video
I'm always getting I'm getting confused
at times things but anyway I'm very
close to hitting half million YouTube
subscribers and it's a really nice
landmark in my youtube journey so that's
why it's exciting for me and it means a
lot that you guys are a lot of you guys
have been on this journey for a long
time and hey and you know yeah I'm
grateful that you're you're still
participating in my life and hopefully
it sir hopefully it's fun for you guys
as well
it's been an awesome year and I'm sure
I'll have some more reflective moments
as we draw to the end of this year but
it's it's been good I've just having you
know having everything slowed down a bit
like the pace of life the last week it's
given me a lot more time than I think
about next year what we want to be
achieving I guess kind of started to
construct kind of a new year's
resolution but more just a bit of a
battle plan and strategy for my life
next year because I could just carry on
travelling random places and just doing
various things each day with friends
which I think it's all good but also I
kind of and have felt for a while I when
I when I get back to the UK definitely
next year I have something I really sink
my teeth into and I was chatting to
Rachel tonight we were just I think the
last couple days have been goods because
we've actually got to have a bit of a
deeper chat about life and everything
and it's it's got me thinking in a good
way it's got me thinking is uh just
thought-provoking and yeah I think um
it's good I think it's good about you
know just looking at your life and
weighing stuff up and anyway I'm
rambling I will catch you guys tomorrow
I think I'm having a barbecue in the
beach and we might be leaving on a mini
little road trip I'll see you then peace
out enjoy life and live the adventure
boom
