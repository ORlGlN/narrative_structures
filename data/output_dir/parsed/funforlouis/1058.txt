little hotel it's right in the center of
Rome thankfully so I think we're just
gonna walk from here
go and see some of the sights if we've
got a big dilemma guys it's shocking it
out with rain now and we're not sure
what today's because we could walk
around but we're gonna get very wet
doodling about getting a massage yeah
that's a great plan
we've armed ourselves with umbrellas and
we're going to go buy some food and more
importantly for me and massage
another Fiat 500 guys and this one said
branded up as a Ferrari or even inside

I remember this from last time I was in
Rome in the evenings they have like
artists out here they do like they have
like all their live portrait drawing and

pretty mazing we got the massage place
they have spaces for us to have a
massage now I've got one our Thai
massage I've asked her extra strong so
I'm ready for heaven guys just came out
a massage place and oh my gosh there's
everything I could have dreamed for she
literally beat the crap out of me and I
loved every second of it
she's like pulling my legs in other
directions she was walking on my back on
her tiptoes Oh guys it was insane I was
drooling I was actually drooling my
pillow was it's happening this made me
realize I think when I have a wife some
stage of my life she's gonna need to
know how to do Thai massage just system
