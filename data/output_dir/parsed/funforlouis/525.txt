what's that is it this is triangle
anyone watching this letter B at anger
in blue is that what is that it's a
triangle with a circle in it finally
ryos got all that stuff do you feel
prepared for the wintry weather that is
the problem when you're traveling a lot
of different countries especially when
you tend to stay warmer countries is
being prepared and having enough clothes
for different climates in a tiny I
haven't nailed that skin you can see
this is where I associate the car this
Anthony this but why did you go in that
machine this is the normal sized one and
that's let's sure people
so I'm back for the night
I've just had a lovely family meal and
everyone's headed to bed
but before I go to bed I've got a few
exciting things to show you
firstly this camera is a replacement
camera that's been weighing on my
parents for a while I had a few things
delivered here but I haven't been back a
month so it's the first time I've been
able to get it so this is the the rx100
mark for I broke mine in South Africa I
didn't tell you about it I dropped it
and there's an error message and stuff
and so I've now bought this is my pocket
camera this is the camera I have been
using for months now and most of last
year the a7r Mark - amazing camera
really good at photos as well as there's
42 megapixel camera and films and 4k and
stuff doesn't film super slow-mo or
anything and it's not incredible in the
low light but what is incredible on that
low light is the case of an S so this
camera is also one that's been waiting
for me I actually broke my a 7r mark -
and our scuba diving so I had a bad
month in January I broke a lot of
cameras so this this was the replacement
I bought but then when I tried to ship
this and this camera back into South
Africa I got like a massive import fee
so I just refused and got them to send
back here so I've got too many cameras
now it basically looks identical is it a
bit smaller yeah it looks bit smaller I
don't know it looks pretty identical to
me so the main difference is with the
two cameras are the ace of an S mark -
shoots at 120 frames a second at 1080
and it's
better low light apparently the sensor
or whatever I think it's the equivalent
to two stops of aperture lower so on
this lens which is the lowest it goes is
at three point five it's not great in in
low light on the basis of an R but
hoping on the a7 s it is so I've been
rolling with these little belt clips
right so I've been walking around like
this which you often don't see it's kind
of silly but I quite like the freedom I
can run around and it's a bit heavy on
my waist but it's quite cool place to
put the camera and I've now brought
another clip so I can have a camera on
each side of my waist say boom I
definitely feel like a cowboy right now
I want to have some spares on my shoes
I'm gonna walk into this delay ting so I
now got a camera clips to each side of
my belt what does it look like yeah does
that look ridiculous you think that's a
silly idea I think it's probably worth
it when I'm definitely out in like
incredible places with loads of scenic
stuff and I will be taking photos and
switching lens lenses quickly yeah I
think I might roll like this with a go
guys for those of you that are
interested in cameras and what I'm using
hopefully there's a bit of an insight
there and we'll be learning more about
the a7s2 as I experiment a bit more with
it and I can tell you the pros and cons
and why I prefer yeah I like I like
getting new gadgets to play with and I'm
quite excited to be messing around with
this camera hopefully looking after it
as well sweet and one last thing I
thought I'd ask you guys basically I'm
back in the UK for a month now I'm
needing to be here to get some visas
sorted have to get my passport to
embassy
and send it away and stuff so I can't
travel but I'm also looking forward to
spending time with the family and
friends and I wanted to know you guys
because this isn't somewhere new that
I'm exploring what would you love me to
be doing in the UK what do you want to
be watching my daily vlogs and what's
interesting to you here because for me a
lot of what interests me is exploring
new places so this is sometimes tricky
to find interesting things to document
and share with you guys so yeah let me
know in the comments what do you want to
see more of and I'll see in the morning
peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure
