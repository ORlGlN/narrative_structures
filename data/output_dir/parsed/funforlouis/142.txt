channel called Louie's Luke and he
crochet things for his channel Wow that
is sick wait let me have a look at that
I've never seen anything this elaborate
so I just come out to check on the bus

I'm saying there's a little get-together
on the bus tonight every youtuber I've
met today I've been like you need to
come and check out my bus later on so
we're going to have a little yeah a
little thing later other big news max
has arrived
I specifically invited max to VidCon
because we've got this panel on Saturday
and I think he's an incredible emcee and
host and I think it will just make it
the best kind of ever so if you're at
VidCon and you're watching or you know
someone here make sure that at 2:00 p.m.
and Saturday you come to our panel I
think it's called how to follow your
dreams and make an impact in the world
or something like that a quorum the
exact title anyway max is going to be
hosting we might even do I don't know if
you saw my Africa burns vlogs but you
might even do a little dance opener like
a warm up at the beginning of the
seminar which would be pretty cool
anyway max is going to bring his big
sound box to the bus later on so we'll
have a bit of music and yeah I'm super
pumped to show people the bus guys look
how pretty Rhys looking it's beautiful
and we're heading for the YouTube party
the annoying thing with this particular
pie that happens every year is super
limited for space they told me those are
like max
obviously been looking like outside why
would they limit how many people and we
found in a the kokyu this tiny burger is
it's a portobello mushroom burger I'm
going to use ten of them all the food

backhoe there like Brian follow this
miniature Instagram account where they

old school
Edwin Damon how you guys doing okay

yeah we love VidCon decide for three
hours a lot of people believe in you
anyway we're just come down to Denny's I
am very hungry I have me medium probably
today that's one of the problems with
VidCon it's like you're running around
you don't get a and I found my Denny's
ditch my best anythi vegan dish - hello
what's alright yo
Edwin's got lovely blue hair you can see
that I think he forgot to wear gloves
when I enjoyed his hair yeah I think
it's much to wear rubber gloves bro I
love it I love it
this time around I went for some
zucchini and squash and extra broccoli
the sad thing is they didn't have any
avocado they've run out of our car dough
which is always a disaster so I think
this is going to do this is going to
fill me up fill er again
right guys here's fiberbed is 3:00 a.m.
I'm pretty tired everyone else went back
to bed like hours ago well before I go
back to the room I thought it's love a
little bit here because everyone's
keeping in the room I've got a big favor
to ask of you basically a few days ago I
had to re-upload my vlog with me buying
the plane and yes super annoying but
anyway I want to do a little experiment
and a friend of mine has a website
called amp tube and it's a way of
getting extra exposure in your vlogs and
it's a way of sharing but also a way for
you guys to get your videos seen by
other people it's pretty cool anyway I
have linked back on a plane vlog a link
you to go through and they can help me
get that video out there because if
you're constantly flying on YouTube for
kind of exposure and get your video seen
you know it's a constant struggle but
yeah you're awesome and you guys can do
that I'm really interested to see how
effective it is and whether it can get
more exposure on the vlog as you know
it's a pretty important milestone for
mere JP buying that plane is super
bummed out that we could leave the vlog
and reuploaded I don't know anyway
that'd be cool if you can do that and
yeah a links that right now need to go
back to that video it's a new video go
check out our heaven we bought a plane
it was epic and yeah I am very excited
and it's nice being here at VidCon and
Steam people were talking about dreams
and stuff too
and I'm sure we will be in the next
couple of days as well I'll catch you in
the morning peace out you'll realize and
live the adventure
