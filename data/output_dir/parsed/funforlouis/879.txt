good morning guys I am heading to a
panel we've got two hours sleep last
night so please wake up first little bit
Wow look at with people that are awake
all these people awake like me hey good
morning good two hours sleep okay so you
get to sleep a bit longer
a little bit more await now I'm pumped
I'm ready
my planner is fun for Louie and I also
daily vlog properties polite
I think today's 720 days I do a lot of
traveling and having adventures
hopefully taking a lot of you guys on
the travels with me daily vlogging and
be able to live from that is incredible
but then also it robs your kind of easy
to store headspace of thinking because
you're like even if you're having a
relaxed day by the end of the day of
things at all I got enough fish to make
a video to put out today even though
it's just a relaxed one and then you end
up kind of well I end up doing it
slightly for distress for the end of
April so you can take what they offer
where I don't have to pick up my camera
and I'm even trying not for like to look
at my phone or laptop from this life I
can get in a good headspace once a week
that yeah Louise you going on stage what
you doing
thank you feed me coffee so the panel is
over and we're probably gonna let me
have another rest since we didn't sleep
enough but before we do that I'm gonna
try - Zoey she invited me to drop in on
the her Meetup she's doing like an eight
hour meet up today hello oh this is cool
it's like a party this is like a party
hello hey Zoey party going on sorry to
crash your party
can I have a so nice to see Zoe and me
up that is a very cool concept for me
ups tables balloons I'm thinking this
could be a trend is always open sleeping
for a few hours just trying to get some
energy for the rest of the day and for
tonight and we're now heading down to
meet the girls for some lunch too late
lunch
how you feeling Nick
this is lunch I think it's chicken we've
left the pool and we'd come up to the
balcony towards the Sun Fay is a
beautiful sunset tonight guys check it
out we just realized that even there's
something right now and kind of do
time-lapse of it there's also a rocket
launch happening the opposite side of
the building we don't know whether we'll
be able to see the rocket which is this
an hour's drive away but I'm pretty sure
we will make what's the latest on the
rocket launch been called off due to
tracking issue but it would have been it
would have been here before we head to
Universal we're going to go down and
meet some of the viewers that have been
patiently waiting outside to meet their
favorite youtubers we're probably not
their favorite youtubers but we'll do
we'll do
if we want to hear of really good
singers it's interesting with the whole
fangirl thing guys cuz a lot of you have
noticed in the comments my vlogs have
been saying that you don't like the vibe
or the whole mentality or like fangirls
and I agree in a way like I don't like
the idea of obsessing over people but
there's something nice about the kind of
team spirit out there like everyone
singing together they're excited they've
got like a shared passion which is
YouTube and meeting people stuff but I
like I don't know I kind of like the
vibe even though that's a bit too
screamy and I think we would get a
little bit too caught up in meet people
but I like the the community of like
viewers that meet at events like this
it's not everyone but I think it's kind
of cool what do you think Nick yeah I
think it's like it reminds me of school
cheerleading when you change school yeah
yeah no like singing songs and and
everyone's happy out there yeah yeah you
realize like any different yeah I know

bye thought I should inform you a little
bit of a situation we've got basically
by the time this vlog is live by the
time you're watching this I'm gonna be
in Cuba and I've been told Cuba has
terrible internet or basically
non-existent internet so I might not be
like to upload my vlogs whilst from
there worst case scenario they'll be up
as soon as I get back so there might be
a big delay maybe a week before and get
them up best-case scenario I should be
able to figure something out but I'll do
my best
my flights like 10 a.m. so I'm gonna get
some sleep and I'll catch you at some
point
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
