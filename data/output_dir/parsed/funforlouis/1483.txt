Day 1 of the road trip round the UK in the Boom Bus,
and I'm feeling pretty excited. Very tired, but pretty excited.
Check out the 'tache.
Check how long a bus's oil dipstick is.
Okay, so we filled up, checked the oil, checked the water,
we're on our way to Brighton.
Okay, so it's 5pm,
but I've only been out like 5 hours.
Uh...
and we've arrived in Brighton, and the meet up in the park is now happening.
Everyone's arrived.
I feel a bit sorry for everyone because it's so dark and rainy outside and uh...
we've got a nice warm bus.
But we've put some lights on outside,
and uh...
we've got a few people coming to hang out.
This lovely girl Paige
has, uh, given me this lovely, lovely drink.
"Inside this bottle there is honey,
raspberry squash, apple juice,
fish paste, ketchup, mayonnaise,
double cream, butter...
That is delicious. Delicious!
Uh... The, um, the gathering we had was great, um...
Pretty wet and cold.
So we're celebrating now - having a little, uh,
a little party down in Brighton  here.
And it's pretty crazy at the bus, come and check this out.
So we've just finished the party.
Yoda's had a very busy night,
and uh, we're just dropping everyone off at the train station.
This is where Yoda chills when we're driving.
Also acts as a... as a hat, a head warmer.
Gotta get my duvet back out,
turn these, uh, settees back into beds,
and uh...
have a...
a well-deserved rest, I think, after that manic day.
But it's been fun, it's been fun.
Um...
Yeah...
Another crazy day tomorrow I guess.
Um, my hands are covered in oil...
and...
Yoda's just climbed up my leg,
because he's a ninja cat.
Basically,
A ninja Jedi.
Aren't you, Yoda?
