awesome meeting you guys but it is
exhausting

madness he's gonna get coffee why they
already I've had three coffees and two
red balls and I'm like shaking so I'm
not gonna have a coffee okay this is the
plan yeah me and Ben are going on stage
and we're doing a challenge the
challenge is we're going to challenge
some of the other youtubers to have an
adventure and we're going to give them
each two hundred pounds well as a team
there's three teams and they won't know
that I think they're competing for 200
pounds but we'll just end up giving them
200 pounds each to have a really fun
adventure and then we they have to like
document their adventure film it and
stuff and all like keep you guys up to
date my vlogs it's gonna be really fun
and you guys can join in as well
hashtag adventure challenge yeah yeah we
want to see all everyone's adventures
this is called empower to adventure I'm
so excited
so last night I flew in from Italy did
an amazing collection that when you
reveal your father again on my blog very
much filler to the guideline may have
been both the daily vlogs we do not
traveling adventure stuff this is
actually my second night back a day back
in the UK in about six months and I
cannot hope for a better welcome home
today we're gonna invite some other
people on stage we're doing a challenge
and they've got the people coming on
don't know where the challenges yet I
want these guys to think as teams very
creatively was the most fun and exciting
and unique adventure you could have if I
gave you this 200 pounds on the stage
right now after tonight you guys hit
both as well I want to see what
adventures you go to if you like
Instagram little things to be able to
even if you run your own YouTube
channels for me it's all about it's all
about feeling empowered obviously we all
watch YouTube
I was up with favor YouTube's youtubers
you know you're favorably to ISM but I
think life's about not just sitting
behind a computer but getting out there
and living your own lives and doing you
know that's that's something I want to
promote massively
so over the coming weeks especially as
it gets into solver bumps and stuff a
little bit but I remember hashtag
adventure challenge ideas and you guys
got for going on your adventure you say
