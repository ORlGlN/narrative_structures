of fun that looks full of flavor
well let's see how that's actually all
right what's up special cheese vegan
cheese can you taste it don't matter
right Alfie's gonna sprinkle some
choices is like super awesome it's like
a superfood isn't it they are gonna go
everywhere you got to show your feet

start and I've got things to do tomorrow
so I'm the dry pack - sorry I've got my
Troy Lord my pole and all my healthy
food I bought today guys
day one of trying out being a vegan have
gone very successfully
that's my any day I feel great not being
vegan a healthy just went for one day
just to try it is that moral support for
me what I'm gonna do
yeah is I'm just gonna eat less meat and
just like make sure that substitute
things yeah not be vegan but just be
careful why it
yeah Italy and yeah I don't be one of
those like I don't even like labels to
be honest I don't think I'm gonna go
around Philippi when I'm a vegan know
just because it's got some negative
connotation is what you eat which
affects the climate and we're just being
what's the word like a sustainable
living sustainably I think there's other
areas of my life I could look into being
more sustainable but it's a journey
isn't it anyway I'm off
and you go a long time sawed in two am
actually probably go
I'm back I'm tired and I'm heading to
bed I'll see you tomorrow guys
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
