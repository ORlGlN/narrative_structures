I'm miles from Great Britain I'm
currently in the Alps in France and
you're watching falfa Louie enjoy
good afternoon guys with less georges
who we were staying with last night and
we have come into Palo Alto to get some
lunch we just sat down
I've ordered my food I'm running out to
pick up a Wi-Fi box because I completely
forgot to bring my Americans Wi-Fi box
back in the UK so annoying I managed to
get replacement Wi-Fi box also just
bought this a massive UE boom speaker
I've got the smaller version but I heard
him playing it here and I just like I've
got one of these I've got to get one
it took me quite a while to get my um my
little Wi-Fi box so they've had to grab
my food to take out so we're not late
for the airport slice I've discovered
falafel I'm sure we tried it before and
I didn't like it but that was good that
was real good holster clip by Sony
camera onto my belt and now I'm all
sorted I've kept me on the e today just
blown a tire
we've just blown a tire oh wow okay that
looks bad that looks real bad
oh my goodness no no I that's I think we
need to try and fire that up a jack
check that out
Dave just look at this though bro yikes
sheesh that I've done diddly done bad
guy this is the current situation our
flight leaves in an hour and 10 minutes
it's going to take I predict an hour to
change this tire we haven't quite got
the right tools it's gonna be very
fiddly so I think what we do is hey Ted
to the airport an uber and get this guy
towed to a garage and they fix a tire
and Dave back light and stuff
that's the best bet a bit annoying but
they knew if it's only three minutes
away I think we're good yeah that's
crazy
yes Libra save the day dragon survives
we tried to change the time it's going
to take too long we would have missed
our flight
I still am not under percent sure we're
gonna catch up probably quite important
closes check and closes nope wait before
using sports
I think we made it got through security
yes
still boarding
Oh a bit crazy isn't it
hey get off my new camera holster check
that out from a qubit call in the tower
get the guys to tow it thank you thank
you Dave I probably we made this flight
boy no
a very quick security thing yeah it's
good
its domestic isn't it domestic is always
much much international Robert make you
forget being in another country friends
then please mate hurts him up
Robin Robin if you're watching you're
the best you're amazing since many of
your car is gonna get robbed up for
thank you
we've landed in Salt Lake City that was
the first two flights we're now heading
to get in our second flight and it's an
hour five minutes which is pretty
chilled because by the time you like get
to like cruising altitude then you were
already like putting your seat belts
back onto land they did you get your car
yes or no yet toes

the day so we are back in business
but in bring out the airport
we've arrived guys we are back in the
Wonder wagon it's been I don't even know
like a month and if you remember me and
Raya had to leave it here because we
were heading off to Sierra Leone it was
a much bigger drive than expected from
San Francisco and Kate has kindly been
looking after it but now is our mission
me and Dave are going to drive it back
to San Francisco a feeling about that
Dave I'm tired now but I'm pumped for
tomorrow yeah we're not packed tonight

also super excited to be teaming up with
Toyota again and their tagline is let's
go places so we are gonna try and go to
some incredibly beautiful places on the
way back this part of the country's
awesome
Yellowstone National Park I think maybe
we're duck into Utah or I don't know
