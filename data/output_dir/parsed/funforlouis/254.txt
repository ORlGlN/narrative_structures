good morning guys
I'm back in the UK and I thought I'd
start a day off by washing my grandpa's
car it's getting very dirty so I'm
singing a car was trying to talk over
this
Brenda's rough yet probably a terrible
idea anyway things have done here I'm
going to be heading into Kingston and
probably grabbing a coffee with Steve
and then we're going to be heading into
London and I hear tonight that there is
a protest happening and how did the fall
of it know Downing Street which is
protecting against Donald Trump gang
employees the UK so now I'm going to go
and check out the little amount
this bra a long time I haven't seen you
can go no hotel and it's bloody freezing

away see when I came back and I was like
this is actually too cold to me

into London see what we can find
okay we've arrived in Waterloo parked up

they're waiting for this thing to start
I don't really know much about it I just
got an email about it today so yeah
we'll see be pretty crazy
for remember a video we made at it I
just think it's quite okay nobody I look
so different
yeah lastly short help the guys it's
time to go and find where the process is
happening we've we went on a mission to
try point Stephen koepfer could be
devised hope so we're given up it's
actually just not too bad once we go
into a crowd at worst we find we also
got a little snack we don't know how
long we're going to be we don't know
what's going to happen but it's good to
be representing joining forces that
everyone supported station I am very no
suspect I don't know how many people are
going to be there by it's cool that
we're turning up and kind of see what
it's all about it's important saying
unit it is important
now that the rough Collies basic legal
advice so you've got a restaurant
outside and it's often searched on that
side okay so then if there are any
around we have recommended solicit on
three things a good at Venus also oxime
arriving there rich is there a risk of
people get arrested
unlikely amass individual suit on us
they're going to get vegetables on the
whole is probably fine I'm going to be
more lively we're going to head into the
crowd this is big big it's that you bit
nice how many people attended our tomato
fulfilling with Nepal and all these
reporters
oh we did we don't know where we go
we're going to I get most every phone
book
so good yeah diversity of people head
going to 40 Downing Street
I'm messing cows every different yeah
high five we haven't seen each other
since Kenya
if the everyone here this is welcome and
a really really cool
Eliza displeased to just killing no
one's picking off you know man
real nice might've worn you down until
my ears only set for a couple of hours I
make these with this person down
Stephanie made the point
to realize that a lot of people here
standing from st. Paul
the guy's people walk the entire length
of Whitehall hung around for a bit I was
great to be a part of that protest I
think there's going to be many more
protests against the Trump presidency
and a lot of the bad decisions is making
so then sometimes it feels like you're
not making a big difference but I think
people still need to stand up and let
their voice be heard and hopefully
people being a part of this and similar
protests around the world will slowly
make a difference that's my hope
ah
we managed to get some dinner
big you fighting the one we've just got
some coffee this prayer and they were on
the house which is weird like the guys
bonded but I didn't know no matter like
they would literally just like gave us
the cookies and the hell all that time
my heart in life we know just going to
give me away it's not I don't know that
it's cool though very good realize that
at the third drop our prototype the bomb
amazingly I've not really gone to this
usually I'm kind of like don't really
agree with like yeah Angela on violence
star now fan yeah absolutely that's my
main like concerned about getting
pregnant by that I like the idea concept
like they're peaceful protests when you
actually don't earn that's some industry
mean I don't get angry and I hear a lot
of suffer from spell I think
22 the day my power we
sighing nice having to live in
backwards walk now I
yeah it is difficult for political news
online and although it's hard to form
really pigeon ate all I do know is that
by the things I've done for monetary
more this world like unity and loving
people different for self extensive you
difference and celebrating on
differences
being tolerant loving the whole of
humanity and a jar in the together we're
living where human beings are the more
think falater sprinkle hard segregate
ourselves then it it feels like you go
back time feels like we shouldn't be
going through this learning to be nice
to give everything for that so we need
to be change agreement and I specialize
in in to sell things me or Bingbing
betrayal I've known areas make it's done
and as you point to the many and de
justice become against things don't
agree with
maybe maybe maybe we can clear change
make differences
well pay attention and government will
act on it don't forget that I can quite
suggest I can add you guys today drop
Steve off and back home now about the
his bed but like I was saying guys find
out what's happening in your area see if
there's anything you can do to get your
voice heard
we need to stand in this together we
need to fight for what we believe in and
not let division and darkness prevail
and what we need to fight for yeah for
unity and love catch in the morning
peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
