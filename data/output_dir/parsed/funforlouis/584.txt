Merry Christmas guys I'm about to head
down to breakfast and me out with a
family but before he do this guys just
feeding the fish and he's showing me
there's a monitor lizard on there I
don't know if you can grasp the size
guys but that monitor lizards hand is
almost the same size as mine he is big
it's basically a dragon
yes dragon Merry Christmas guys yeah
yeah this is crazy
well again fish look at the size of that
that is like a sea monster isn't it
Merry Christmas
well I slept for like 12 hours straight
good did you sleep well mum yeah I did I
did I did wake up at five to be honest
but I went that sleep yeah I just wake
up there's a little bit hungry so I
found loads of chocolate ain't loads of
chocolate knowing that today was a good
start to Christmas near me what do you
guys do first thing Christmas morning
we're doing a very untraditional
Christmas right now not just because of
the way the bowls there because we
haven't got like opening gifts under the
Christmas tree or anything I don't think
we have any plans I was so out of it
yesterday I'm feeling a lot better today
although I still think it's gonna save
me a few days to adjust to this being
the reality of where we are like it
doesn't seem real doesn't seem real does
it hell this is real life Merry
Christmas daddy I just bought a pair of
goggles I'm gonna go in guys haven't
been in the sea yet these lot went in
yesterday but I was just so spaced out
but I apparently it's warm any of that
we're gonna try and take the sea kayaks
out later well the sea was very murky
and I've just gonna switch my goggles
for a mask and I'm gonna go for a little
swim in the swimming pool here same I
set my camera in there I think it's
gonna be a bit clearer is it clearer in
there dad I love that I think the only
similarity between today and other
Christmas days we usually have at home
is how relaxed everything is usually we
just sit around doing nothing and that's
exactly what we're doing today
lunch time device check this out check
this out
you can see where we walked across hair
like a velociraptor
yes bro straight-up dragon you happy to
be out here dad yeah nice look at these
little crabs and they're making these
tiny little balls of sand and kicking
outside their house I think they're just
digging tunnels
look at these intricate patterns made by
the crabs it's kind of fascinating
yeah I love animal art so we've heard
rumors of monkeys there's lots of
monkeys around here but we haven't seen
any yet so this is why we want to
explore into the jungle I think that's
where they're hiding
that mint smell the mint
just keep your eyes peeled for snakes
dad nothing quite like a Christmas Day
jungle trek what he found something has
got a live in there
I think it's giant monitor lizard Arkin
I think these are pretty strong that
guy's a monkey yeah I know mate
you think wake him up
it's ridiculously humid guys you see me
I'm terrific
I think we just wake him up he's been
very tired I actually didn't really
think we're gonna find any monkeys but I
didn't I thought Louise just be helpful
keep himself amused to say yeah we got
monkey hunting but anyway so the plan
now is we're gonna jump in these kayaks
see these sea kayaks and we're gonna go
out and a little explore I think we go
to the island so Hillary and Adam have
disappeared off somewhere but me and my
dad are gonna go around this side of the
little island to me yeah okay not that
one this one yes brother
these crabs are crazy hello mr. Crabb I
got changed and we're heading out to
this night market which is about half an
hour walk away I thought I think we're
gonna get attacked you down there guys
check this out for a Christmas sunset
that is pretty spectacular pretty epic
isn't it that
so we're doing Secret Santa tonight and
I've been I picked my mum as my
personality to buy gifts for so I'm
going to be wandering around looking for
something small
that's really cool that's you're like
I'm really bad at buying gifts but I'll
try
oh hey guys what do you think I found
this sarong and it looks kind of cool
because it looks Malaysian all the
little patterns do anyway so
unfortunately this isn't actually a
sarong it's something you wrap around
your head like like this lady's wearing
right with we're doing the Secret Santa
this is my gift now this is we're done
this in the weirdest possible way okay
yeah right this I thought was this the
wrong but then she showed me it's
actually a headdress but I thought maybe
we could turn it in just the wrong but
I'll show you how to spill it on right
open it all the way out you've wrapped
this around that way and overlap and
then put your head in that one one as
well but I'm not I wasn't excited I
wasn't expecting you to wear to wear
this like this I just really like the
pattern and I thought you could turn it
into a sarong showing her my gift from
Secret Santa which was Evan we have a
problem there she put it all around
Ronda
watch right now quite is quite tight
this is Adams from Hilary a transformer
and some herbs would you get that
manicuring things all pedicure things
yes this has been complaining yeah
you're gonna wear flip-flops and just
keep your toenails in order I like it
that is very you yeah Christmas I
