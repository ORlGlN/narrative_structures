so guys this is a bit of a different
video my channel today basically I was
contacted by NASA and offered the
opportunity to ask some questions to an
astronaut his name's scott kelly and
he's living up on the international
space station for one year check this
out the launch of soy use tma 16m will
return three veteran space fliers to the
international space station with two of
them embarking on the first-ever
year-long mission to this vehicle
one-year expedition crew member retired
US Navy captain Scott Kelly has
accumulated 180 days in space during
three missions Kelly piloted space
shuttle discovery service mission to the
Hubble Space Telescope in 1999 he served
as the commander of the sts-118 mission
to the space station and he spent over
five months aboard the International
Space Station as an expedition 25 flight
engineer and his expedition 26 commander
hi I'm Louie Co I travel the world and
make videos from our YouTube channel fun
for Louie and in my adventures I find
this a lot of obstacles that come across
what's been the biggest obstacle of the
mission that you're on and how did you
overcome it
well this is my fourth time in space my
second long-duration flight so I kind of
eased into this pretty easily if kind of
felt like I had really never left it's
really amazing how your body remembers
the environment I think though the
biggest obstacle or the biggest
challenge will be the the duration of
this flight you know just being here for
so long never being able to leave never
being able to leave your place at work
so you know so far it's been a pretty
seamless transition but I you know I
expect as I'm here longer it'll be get
more challenging that regard doing what
you're doing staying up on the
International Space Station is the
biggest adventure I could imagine and
I'm sure it has been for you but if you
could travel to anywhere else in space
any solar system or planet where would
it be no people normally ask you know if
you could travel to any other place in
our solar system and then I generally
say Mars but the way you pose the
question I think if I could go anywhere
we would probably be to a planet that
astronomers and scientists have just
determined is most like Earth and you
know to see what's really there you know
if there are living creatures or you
know just how that planet is evolved and
how similar it really is to our home
planet I've heard that up in space stray
cosmic rays can cause you to see flashes
of light has that ever happened to you
and if so what does it look like you
know the first time I saw those was on
my Hubble Space Telescope mission in
