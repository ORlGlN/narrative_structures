hey it's Danny the only and you were
watching fun for Louis good morning guys
is day three of the Toyota road trip
back to San Francisco we have just left
to lava hot springs we had an amazing
time in the natural hot springs last
night and now we have apparently 12
hours to get that back to San Francisco
but in reality is going to take us a few
days well guys we've been driving for a
couple of hours and I think it's lunch
time stopping at this little diner
Molly's Molly's cafe
this is classic Middle America we're
probably gonna get lots of odd looks as
we walk in baby what you're eating there
they just reviving bro revising
Dave I have a problem there's nothing on
the menu I can eat it's all meat and
dairy
well my supposed to be
there's so tough guys if they did you
ice cream of the style I scream massive
top of ice cream
this is a tough part of the world to try
and eat a vegan diet very very tough it
might be the toughest part about me and
Dave was saying last night even if we
were in like rural India or something it
would be much easier to find food but
not here guys look at the length of this
lorry that's like a train on the right
well that wasn't an incredibly
successful lunch stop but it's kind of
expected I knew there'd be hardship
along the way of trying to change my
diet and it's all a part of it I think
learning the ways is a big it's a steep
learning curve as what I'm saying we've
we've got a lot of miles to cover I
think we're going to dip into Utah and
then into Arizona no Nevada Nevada maybe
we're actually planning to pretty much
beeline straight for Lake Tahoe where
we've got some friends and we're going
to be hanging out with
we've been driving these really straight
roads and dave has decided to pull over
film a little poem in this epic
landscape debut me are gonna go and
explore this train there's like some
train on the side of the road I'm just a
bit worried about the Met fans we've got
past Oh mate so sandy I do think we're
gonna get stuck in that I think I don't
want to get stuck in the Nevada there's
a road
anything do you think this is a legit
training that's about to leave or do you
think this has just been chilling here
for like a decade guys that know about
trains it is does this look like a used
railway or is this just doing nothing
here that's what I thought
they catch the ball they boy didn't you
catch it
there's a trailer park over there Dave
there's like a couple of trailers that's
scary that scares me Dave you've left
the lights on bro
I'm going in to explore guys I have no
idea what this train is for just fill it
weird that all its metal so this is like
a car or something it's crazy
Dave I hope it doesn't stop moving
whilst we're in it no that's why I
thought this must still be an active
train mission no why I'll jump down and
it gets on the tracks think I'm
straddling across two of the train
carriages it's actually quite high up
that is awesome I love that I'm going to
try and crawl under the Train
this is not this is where you really
don't it to stop moving why that might
be in the sound we heard maybe the train
start to go
like yeah let's go let's go Ava's been a
bit of a legend today he's been driving
all day I've been trying to finish some
editing and doing some bits and bobs I'm
gonna do I'll do the next big shift
sounds good yeah I feel bad but this is
way better than the drive here where I
drove the whole thing by myself because
Riya and purse a driving test bro have
you got your keys you need to pass the
driving test friar okay let's hope it
starts well it didn't know sup wait am i
met am I missing thing turn the ring
scrubs off my breath no is this my key
yeah holy Tuesday morning I thought we
were gonna get eaten alive by meth
dealers we could we could live one of
those trains we were done bro to be fair
you did leave the lights on for a little
bit save him did you think we were done
yeah
I'm just so glad to be back on the
tarmac bro this boys this bro
oh boy a bomb cowboy Bo but ain't it
we need a petrol station there might be
one says about station
the gas station guys look how epic this
gas pump is it's like it's not even
ditched to its what is that analog I
just had to lift this lever here and
that's happening never seen one of these
we've dug into the little restaurants
get some food before the final leg and
take over driving in days because he's
been doing all the driving
but with vegetables finally look look a
little stomach bug so I can eat food try
some of these
finally broccoli chickpeas all the beams
this is this is a good food where you
like this trouble in this family
yeah ma'am back in the Wonder wagon I'm
gonna do an hour 40 minutes drive and
then we're gonna try and find a motel
tonight hopefully so we can just like
have a shower and have a nice rest
before
the next leg to Tahoe tomorrow guys we
found a place called royal in which I
think matches me and a quite well we're
we are royalty oh absolutely
- look clean rooms that's what you need
need of your royalty I love that I have
to point out are there clean rooms oh I
thought they might be dancing you tired
Dave play this game that's really
difficult but if people ask him what
that game is what's the game
it's called 10/10 it's like Tetris but
my girlfriend got me into this and I
can't stop we have found our room guys
and it's just glorious they comfortable
beds Dave oh it's nice sometimes on road
trips to have a little break and treat
yourself there's only cost us like $60
though which is crazy because it's
everything you need big bed little
coffee machine and a desk to do some
work amazing right
I'll see in the morning guys bright and
early peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure
