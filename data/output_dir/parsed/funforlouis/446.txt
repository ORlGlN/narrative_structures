good afternoon guys
it's an incredible day in Denver we're
just about to head over to Boulder which
is this place we went like a
year-and-a-half guard I know you
remember when we got a train across the
country and we were visiting our friend
Laura well we're gonna go over there
today hopefully on a little hike and I'm
looking forward to this it's gonna be
incredible last time I came I was
feeling a little chipmunk by a lake it
was called Bear Lake and so I don't know
we're heading up there or another place
we've arrived in Boulder picked up Marco
we're now going to try and find
somewhere cool to explore but it has
started raining unfortunately even
though it's like an incredible day in
Denver and apparently the weather in
Denver is always different because of I
don't know the mountains and the wind
and this stuff science yeah wow yeah
double rainbow all the way guys double
rainbow we need to stop and look at the
double rainbow it doesn't go all the way
though the shot ekwa is it called the
shot ekwa so taqwa
shut up coat rail so guys we came to
this spot in with it a private one 14
october 24 in
look how cool the rainbows are had a
rainbows make you feel and magic for I
spot a cool photo opportunity with the
wildflowers
I'm gonna go make friends at the dare
hey buddy hey buddy
how's the food don't hang out oh okay
why I really loved there I think they're
beautiful
I'm really elegant you know just the way
they walk and their posture and they're
super chilled right I need to find the
others now I kind of wandered off to
make friends of the deer but they didn't
want to be friends they were a pretty
tame though oh look how unfit I am it's
going to look strong oh I need to get my
hiking game on this where we going Nick
lead the way
guys what is this place
Dutch fairies make these these little
fairy castles
Wow someone's balance these rocks on a
little stump on the tree
so Laura is a stay this is Laura if you
don't know she was just saying that in
2013 there's a crazy flood here and it
ripped through the forest so the reason
why this gorge is so wide and let
there's like trees ripped up and stuff
it's because so much the water was
flowing down here and that it's reduced
to its tiny little trickling stream so
the path goes this way I'm gonna try and
see where this riverbed goes and maybe I
can find them again maybe not maybe I'll
get lost
honestly if I could find any cool
animals
oh cool
pull these lines Hey
okay see at the bottom love ye okay I
think I've gone past the point of no
return because I can't get
I think when I'm out in nature I've
weigh the fair exploring areas that
people don't usually walk so if you're
following a trail it's like nothing I
just feel like you're just doing the
same thing a thousand other people have
done but when you're finding your own
path and and exploring the unknown
that's where their excitement comes in
for me like who knows where this river
leads like what am I gonna find what
kind of animals live down here and
because it's off the path maybe if there
are animals down here
they haven't been disturbed by people
stay you know it's more likely it's like
people walking past all the time animals
aren't gonna hang out there
so crazy to think about how much has
changed since last time we were here
like that was the first time I ever
traveled with Louise I just met Nick and
we'll Ben Steve it was just like his way
before starting YouTube and just so
crazy like it hasn't even been that long
but so much has happened it's really
cool yes I am yes perfect super cache
perfect the weirdest thing has happened
I was just following the river and it
just like disappeared just dried up so
now I'm walking on a completely dry
riverbed I don't know whether it like
went underground or like diverted
somewhere I didn't notice ah sweet look
at that cabin that is cool
I made it back onto a road guys look at
this insanely cute bunny
yo sir I saw a grizzly bear I know I had
a punch and I had a punch off without ya
ya bat with the guys gonna head to
dinner now that was a nice little detour
I enjoyed that where are you taking us

Chinese house this is our last night
