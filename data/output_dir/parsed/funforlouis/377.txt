Bulgaria's so old he's been ruled by so
many different people and when they dug
down to fill the metro they kept running
into like super old like buildings that
they found like thousands of years old
so I took them so long to be able to
build the line so yeah here's some of
the stuff they found when they were
digging this is just like archaeologists
just uncovered yeah just in the middle
of the city
Oh
