Wow awesome well okay guys we're doing a
livestream from Cape Town South Africa
it's quite late at night we want it to
do it bit early but we were out at
dinner having an amazing dinner actually
but we've got a big announcement kind of
we are here for a while three months and
we haven't moved in this is gonna be
like a test for our relationship
hopefully a good one
yeah we've moved in together we have an
apartment for three months
we're unpacked for the first time in
three years for me like five years for I
have an office space because usually we
have a hotel room and I just explode I'm
like charging now that reasons up a
bride's head basically yeah now we
actually have our own space so good like
them I was impact probably within 10
minutes of getting in here I just wanted
to yeah I have everything hung up and we
got a nutribullet so we can make
smoothies in the morning and my I set up
a desk as well and I have a some amazing
view of the mountains it's just I think
something you don't really realize but
when you travel full-time there's all
these decisions that you have to make
every day literally you wake up and
you're like where do I go to get
breakfast and where do I like how do I
find wherever I need to do it's like all
day every day you're making all these
decisions and to be able to be somewhere
where my breakfast smoothie is in the
freezer already you know I mean like
everything's kind of set up for you so
you don't have to make all these little
decisions and you can just dream big and
kind of work on bigger projects I think
that's what I'm most excited about for
these two months yeah I haven't settled
yet I'm looking forward to settling I
think one of the reasons I'm not settled
and I haven't told anyone online this
yet but I'm I have to fly back to London
tomorrow night really bad timing but
there's a really cool conference
happening and it was like either I
missed the conference or there's three
options either I stay in London for a
week and I wouldn't have been in Cape
Town now I know who's been waiting
around or I come out here get settled in
this place see Riya
and then knit back to London for three
days or I would have had to miss the
conference so anyway I'm going away for
three days this week then I'm back and I
think we're not back oh right we are
kind of doing I guess the best format
from I found four lives but I'm willing
to experiment it's doing a Q&A thing so
we can respond live I did a little tweet
earlier just to get us going as usual
and then we can respond to people in the
live chat hi guys why Cape Town don't
name a water crisis yes we do about the
Walker so they do have a water crisis
where sometimes in the next kind of
three months basically they might be
shutting the water off because it's like
the worst drought in history basically
and when you're here you have to be
super super conscious of that so we
literally are showering over a bucket or
trying not to shower as often as we may
be used to at home some people at home
shower like once or twice a day
I usually shower once a day but I'm
trying to do every other day and even
like with flushing you have to be
careful so the Buc in the water with the
Buffy you have to flush the toilet with
it's all these like in everything you do
you're trying to keep conscious of that
and yeah so the water crisis is
definitely real and we're trying to do
the best we can to kind of make as
little impact as we can and why Cape
Town won it's summer here right now it's
hot it's beautiful and amazing it's so
you Louie
is currently working on editing the
documentary yeah I see boys night yeah
beyond borders and you want to set up a
little team down here
yeah we're just currently interviewing
setting up a team a write a someone to
manage the team that kind of producer
and yeah like a head editor potentially
a couple of other edits
so it's coming together JP's coming out
in two weeks I think he said so yeah
it's gonna be you know so the Liberty
adventure office is down here so only as
employees and stuff so it kind of makes
sense to be here and kind of be next to
the adventure team as it's growing try
to get the like Beyond Borders team set
up down here and just enjoy we have a
ton of friends on here as well Louie
just hung out with Ben today there's a
lot of amazing people that we're gonna
get to see and hang out with and be in
the sunshine and also Cape Town's an
incredible city so all those things yeah
it's quite windy right now as well guys
I don't know if you can hear you might
not be able to hear but our house sounds
like it's haunted because the winds
whistling through we're quite high up
we're on the fifth floor of this light
block of flats but I feel like the wind
is just like trying to push through our
building and it is like whistling in the
background so if you hear any with wait
weird whistling sounds in the background
that's what is should we look on Twitter
fest so monument yeah people can hear
the wind that's crazy
yeah
that's the best deep walk okay what's
the biggest challenge this is from Sara
what's the biggest challenge we've faced
whilst traveling it's not we have face
it's like you face what struggling yeah
I mean I think I might link it back to
what I was just saying but it's it is
just like all day every day running
around it's like yeah just making all
these little incisions that and you're
not able to zoom out and dream big and
plan kind of bigger things specifically
with how quickly we travel last year a
lot of times we traveled somewhere for
like two or three days and you literally
get there you can barely adjust the time
different certainly know where you are
then you have to leave so a lot of that
kind of backed up I feel like time just
go so quickly I don't even know where
it's gone and you weren't able to like
really achieve any of your goals so and
I think for me one of the reasons why we
are here for so long as well as doing
that documentary are kind of neat a big
one space but I think it is the whole
exactly what you're saying like feeling
constantly kind of exhausted and for me
when I'm just jumping from spot to spot
to spot and traveling like there's a lot
of fun in that but after a while it's
not like I don't appreciate it but it
just restricts other parts of your life
and it's like I've always wanted to live
in a space of freedom where I am
released to kind of live my dream and
and not just kind of have travel
adventures but kind of adventure life
together as well now and it's like
sometimes actually the freedom of or the
being so spontaneous or often just the
speed at which we travel like it
actually restricts us so it's the
cutters house where design goods travel
and you know it's it resembles generally
it's it's more about freedom and getting
to explore the world but I think for me
where I'm at right now
we're so I feel like a bit of routine
and a space where we can relax and know
you know that we can come back to as a
little base is actually gonna help me
move on and actually get more thing
build more things and feel more I think
after such a kind of unstable few months
especially with the world fly and the
lack of sleep and the kind of content
constant kind of go-go-go I think having
a place to kind of gather myself
mentally emotionally like it's gonna be
great and I'm really excited about being
here and I think that so that ties into
the questions I think that is always
being the struggle for me traveling is
is that that's the struggle it's it's
not having a place to feel kind of like
okay cool I can get my head straight but
I have been kind of on the road for I
almost five years and this is been this
is gonna be the longest period of time
where I'm just gonna pin one spot I'm
not making any commitments to schedule
this year other than I'm imagining it's
gonna be more like every other day so so
far in January it's been every other day
and there may be periods where we're
doing loads of really fun stuff and I'll
be vlogging every day but if it's just
we're here and we're getting on with
stuff and I'm doing the documentary
stuff like I think I think every other
day is more kind of achievable so much
what's my favorite spot in Cape Town I'm
excited to find that out because there's
so my feel like I've been here twice
before for quite a long time each time
but still it's like the whole time goes
by and I'm like wait I've barely seen it
so obviously the the mountains are
incredible Table Mountain and lions head
and stuff I really want to do a lot of
hikes I really love is it called
kirstenbosch yeah Kirsten Bush
kirstenbosch it's like this Botanic
Gardens it's so stunning that's probably
one of the most amazing places and also
there's this Beach that is covered in
penguins which I am
kind of blows my mind to be on the beach
and there's penguins everywhere but
there I love penguins and they're so
cute so that's that was one like one of
the coolest things when I sat for the
first time yeah I think generally the
other side of Table Mountain from where
we are so we're on the east and then the
west where we were just now for dinner
the whole coastline is that's where you
see the best sunsets and yeah it's
literally Beach and then it's just table
manners they're like you know I think I
prefer that side of the mountain so
there's loads of cool spots along there
it's just a bit more expensive to stay
and we're here for like quite a long
time so well and the little adventure
offices here in Nick and Ange everyone's
around this so it's kind of more
residential area sorry
someone said what's our fondest memory
of one another or together there's a
nice question yeah summer said where are
we living I think we live in I think
this area is called Claremont yeah
that's I mean I feel like my mind's like
I think I don't know why but what's that
movie inside out
I can literally visualize like these all
these mini risers going through all the
files in my head right now I'm trying to
find a memory but let's limit it to last
year I think last year my favorite time
together therefore probably my favorite
memory singing back with our time in
Greece in Corfu because I think they I
think it's rare that we get to switch
off and I really felt like we switched
off in coffee and that was just so nice
and I just remember it being like good
quality time together
well I was going to say the Maldives it
wasn't last year's the year before but
it was it was the same thing as well for
both of us being able to not film
we actually like fully turn our phones
off no looking at laptops nothing for a
couple days we were only really able to
do it I guess once a year but we should
dress and try to do it more than that
because I feel like our relationship
like jumps up a level whenever we do
something like that so the Maldives in
core
those kinds of experiences and yeah just
like to get rid of all distractions to
just have amazing deep chats and just
like long dinners and all that stuff
yeah best and someone said tips for long
distance relationships and how do we and
also set another question but similar
how do we keep such a strong
relationship going while struggling well
ok second question first we've never not
traveled together which is actually
what's interesting about this is this is
our first time I were living together so
this is like kind of a big relationship
test for us most people it's the other
way around we're like traveling together
is a relationship test but so yeah I
don't know how to answer that second
question but the first one tips on
long-distance relationships definitely
number one is to have an idea of when
you're gonna see each other next because
I think if we were to say goodbye and be
like okay I don't know when I'll see you
again I don't really know how that would
work
yeah but to be like even if it's like a
year from now or six book you've even
it's a long time no not for us for some
people they do have to go really long
times not seeing each other but even if
it's a long period of time to know that
it's coming is I think makes it like
tangible and it means that every day
you're able to like I love countdowns
and there's been times when I've like
written out countdowns for stuff so I
don't know to be able to know that the
days are ticking off and you're getting
closer and it's happening and just to
have that day it's super important and
then also communication is key and
everyone communicates differently and it
took us a while to figure out like a way
for us that worked well for both people
but so so people it's like FaceTime do
you want to text all day whatever it is
for both people make sure that both
people are happy and feel like they're
getting to communicate enough and like
they're being valued and I think it is
really long-distance we really trust
each other as well it helps I am
imagine if you're in like a jealous
relationship trying to do long-distance
he would be inadmissible yeah so many
flying in Willie wait what's that about
having impediments do you want any
animals there that dog cat iguana well I
actually once did have a pet iguana and
they are no offense but they had
terrible pets why they're just very like
my Guana wasn't very friendly and then
also like they just sit though whatever
you know I'm guessing any reptiles are
like this just not very emotional zero
emotion just like it's basically like
having a pet rock and then there's like
it's not like having him like an
expressive like kitten cat dog you know
I've never had a dog but that's at some
point in the future probably I why I
imagine us having is a puppy which will
then become a dog how did he deal with
jet lag I Diamond is getting worse for
me I was having discussion with someone
today he will see travels a lot and he
was like yeah when you as you get older
your body becomes less capable of
jumping time zones and I think as well
with the lack of sleep I often punish my
body with not punished but you know like
inflicting myself yeah I think it I
struggle like I'm still even though I've
been in like five days I've not even
adjusted even traveling with a two-hour
time zone so yeah I don't I I don't know
what advice I just say just be aware
that there's a high chance as you age
and you're traveling or Alaura more you
what he might start being like hold up
someone said they just joined what we're
talking about a gay little update I
don't know how much longer we're gonna
stay on 17 I think we'll try and do half
an hour which gives us a bit we are
talking about the fact that we've moved
to Cape Town together we're gonna be
here for three months which is a really
big deal for us we're gonna be most that
time in this apartment Oh probably will
probably like an apartment tour and what
am i vlog see but I don't like to start
showing you guys around now like it's my
fault actually on that point we realized
on the first day that because I am
slightly more disorganized or for me I
just like keep my things a bit more
chaotically but I know where everything
is
but Riya obviously and most people kind
of like things a bit more you know is
that if I can keep my stuff contained in
one room which is like the office it's
actually a spare room then it's gonna
save us a lot of aggro
I think you'll save our relationship I
don't think we could really live
together without you having a space to
just explode with all your things
because I I'm like I feel super stressed
out and on edge when everything's
everywhere I kind of need everything to
be in its place so if you have a room
where you how do you suppose when we
travel building like I think when we're
only somewhere for like a day or two I'm
able to kind of look past it cuz it's
just everything's crazy anyway and it's
not I don't see the hotel room is like a
Haga to just relax here because
everything's so crazy but to me this is
like my sanctuary and I'm able to just
relax and yeah so if you kind of keep
your things contained then it means that
we can be happy
Oh someone told burping Bob exhaust how
do we get the funds for travel well okay
look we are now both in a very
privileged position where we can earn
from making YouTube videos do an
Instagram whatever social media
it's a dream job I'm feel very
privileged and thankful that we're in
this position but listen up guys
you don't have to be doing what we're
doing to be able to travel like we're
traveling both of us traveled a lot
before we started this yeah so I started
traveling actually back when I had
pretty much zero Monday's name I had
lucky I had a lot of other friends that
wanted to travel and living in Europe
even in the UK like been able to travel
and do road trips with friends is
extremely cheap and we were even like
sleeping in the vehicle so for me it's
like how desperately do you want to
travel and can you adjust your kind of
comfort level down you could go camping
like I said road trips you don't need to
be staying in swanky hotels and you
don't need to be even flying places and
even if you do wanna fly places for
instance the the trip I was just talking
about earlier triptych or Corfu which is
one of our my nicest memories of us last
year was a last-minute flight that we
found on the day and it was 60 quid yeah
we were actually didn't know where we
wanted to go and we were like let's just
see where there's cheap flights from
London and you have a 60 pound return I
think to go to Corfu and that's
literally why we chosen end up being an
incredible destination so and I'm sure
like you guys could work like a pretty
standard job and save 60 quid for a
flight take a 10 like the amount of like
very like I don't do it so much my vlogs
now but before is vlogging I would like
fly to Ibiza and live on the beach with
no money now just let me let me give
advice as a girl over here
I have never like slept on the street or
in a park or anything like that like
Louie has that's not much below like for
example I don't think I ever even stayed
no-tell before I started travelling with
Louie so and I used to travel all the
time and the way
that was staying in hostels and Europe
specifically same with friends so when I
was like 15 I went to Jamaica and I met
a girl she was my friend who lives in
Jamaica and she was going home for
spring break and I was like can I come
back with you and just hang out with you
and I so like the flight was basically
my only expense because I was staying
with her parents were feeding me so I
would just I want to travel so bad that
I was just on the constant lookout for
any opportunity that I could find and I
would just like visit friends and go
with like family members to different
places so it definitely kept an eye out
for all of that and also if travel is a
priority for you you can make it happen
and you kind of don't realize how much
money you spend just on everyday life
but literally like a Starbucks coffees
like what four or five dollars if you
are used to getting Starbucks every day
that is so much money that adds up and
yeah there's so many little things like
that drinking I don't drink and a big
reason is why because a table when I was
in college drink it was my friends who
would drink would spend so much money
and I'm like I just wanna save all that
money and go traveling to be honest and
I did and yeah there's so many ways to
save money
good questions just I just forgot what
they said
Oh someone is people are a few people
are asking again why we're in Cape Town
specifically it's your biggest pet
peeves and look Cape Town is already
before like the other reasons about that
about to explain but for me Cape Town is
in my top I'd say it's in my top two
favorite cities asking true so I'd say
London in the summer I'd say Cape Town
in the summer and other times of year
it's just amazing and that's they Rio de
Janeiro Brazil but yeah so firstly one
of my favorite cities secondly we've got
a bunch of friends out here thirdly we
have I have my live the adventure office
out here we've got a team and also
getting and because of those reasons I
thought this would be a great spot to
assemble a team to do the Beyond Borders
documentary it's beautiful weather right
now being in Europe even being over in
LA right now the Sun set in there like
five by three here the Sun sets at like
8 p.m. so lots of different reasons so
yeah Oh burping blobs that's another
question yes from Norway
Santander be says biggest pet peeves
with each other or in general I would
say
okay one of mine is when people are
really loud in public and aren't aware
or don't really seem to care about
people around them so I don't know if
you've ever experienced like someone
getting on a bus and playing music off
their phone just loudly and everyone's
just like whoa I don't know what's
happening so that's one of mine people
kind of like don't respect other
people's like private space and no no
just respect ago in general I think one
of mine and I know this isn't people's
fault but it's like really loud snoring
if I'm in a room with someone that's
just like snoring away it really gets to
me and but then I found the magic of
earplugs and it new lives changed my
life it's probably saved a few of my
friendships as well the other day I was
in a plane and before we even took off a
guy is leaning back and just was snoring
so loud everyone in the plane was
staring game like someone was trying to
kick his seat and everything it was just
like so bad someone asks a question that
I just remember from further on was how
do you deal without having a limited
wardrobe whilst traveling dresses are a
huge help if you guys notice I pretty
much only wear dresses which take up
less space because it's like a whole
outfit in one and I guess just making
sure that I bring in a couple of new
things like usually once a month or
every two months I'll get a couple of
new pieces in just to kind of keep it
exciting but yeah I don't know I don't
really ever feel that bored in my
clothes especially what if I the good
thing about living out of a carry-on is
that you have very few clothing and what
that means is you kind of can only have
your favorite pieces so you end up just
being happy with a lot of the stuff that
you have I know I've never really cared
much about literally as one pair of
jeans and like three shirts I'm learning
this right got my camera is got the
drones got all the bit you know tripods
the batteries on a pattern I pretty much
done oh yeah clothes
yeah then I'm just like yeah five pairs
of socks he's had this huge bag only
full of electronics and then like a
little carrier bag like a plastic bag
from Walmart or something three shirts
of it true story
yeah well I'd like about three vest tops
a t-shirt this is my only teacher yeah
and you don't have any like button up
here I've got one pair of jeans yeah
I've got one pair of shorts swimming
trunks literally my clothes could fit in
a bag this big yeah granted I do have a
few clothes in my parents house his suit
and snowboarding gear but anyway i-i've
I wonder what traveling if I was really
into fashion would be what's one thing
you love most about each other thank you
yeah okay bye love I think I love how
like kind-hearted you are and I think
it's rare thing this yeah I think you're
just incredibly kind the way you see
others and treat people and just in the
way but my favorite thing about Louie by
far is just his heart is like just so
big and fur for everyone and everything
I kind of I used to say this even like
before I met you that kind of my dream
guy would be someone who is like a
strong man that I feel safe with but
would also when they see a puppy they
just melts and I feel like that's easier
yeah you just have a huge heart and you
when I like help everyone and love
everyone thanks
we're twenty eight minutes two minutes
guys you're gonna try and wrap this up
at half an hour
I'm literally with live streams to
probably I know it's like an hour and
two hours but let's try not keep you
guys all night Oh whew people are asking
about JEP like I said earlier if you
missed it JP is coming down to Cape Town
I think hopefully in two weeks we've had
a bit of a break since ending the world
flight I've needed just to recalibrate
and of surety that's - it was it was an
amazing feat we're both just super happy
and I don't know proud that we managed
to achieve it but I think it was
definitely we needed a few months just
to just a rest and get excited about
digging back in with the documentary so
he's going to come over we're gonna
brainstorm together and help ya compile
this what I believe it's going to be an
amazing documentary to then kind of get
out to you guys and hopefully get bigger
than my current audience and JP's
current audience and get it out there
for the masses and so for those of you
that supported us with it all thank you
so much for the continuing support
we're both yeah we're both super pleased
with how it went so far Oh
someone said Jax gap can help you jack
harries is actually gonna be helping he
was one of the executive producers that
opted to come and help us like kind of
finish up the movie and you know I could
pilot a bit together he's even said and
I'm not like this isn't confirmed but
he's even said he might come down to
Cape Town so it'd be fun to get Jack
down there so that in which country was
your first kiss you know do you remember
Oh in New York
let's do one more question yeah one more
question guys we only read one of the
Twitter tweets so I go back to thank you
guys so much I feel like we need to just
do a lot more yeah yeah what is the
hardest part about documenting your
relationship on a global platform if you
could go back in time would you change
anything about how you've done things I
really like regret stuff to the point
where I'd go back and change it cuz I
think often even if there's tough things
you go through you learn from those and
if you hadn't gone through them maybe
you wouldn't learn from stuff yeah so
for instance maybe the fact that I was
quite adamant to be vlogging every
single day until late into the evening
every single night probably was harmful
to our relationship slow down but I
think I wouldn't have known that until
it been happening and then we'd have
talked about it and you might have not
even known that like oh actually this is
a big deal like we need to find the
right boundaries and we're still kind of
constantly in that kind of place of
figuring out you know when when to share
how much to share and how much our lives
should revolve around my vlogging and
YouTube channel and it's definitely
shifted away from it being for me one of
the primary things I'm always thinking
about now I want to think beyond YouTube
and our relationships a lot more
important and my love
and I think when we started it honestly
was like yeah more level with like this
is such a part of who I am that if you
can cope with it then like we couldn't
be together yeah and I think it shifted
now that like I'm quite open to
imagining a different future although I
still love blogging and still love
making videos so this is like I'm making
him not blonde or anything like I
actually personally think and a lot of
other vloggers have talked about this
daily vloggers that daily vlogging can
be incredibly toxic and damaging to a
relationship and I think it's not about
like therefore do not daily look but I
just think it's about getting a balance
getting priorities right and taking days
off to be honest you can still even
daily vlog but if you even if you like
daily thought only till 5:00 every day
or something and then just have two
things together that it's just hard when
Louise spent so used to literally from
the moment he wakes up to the moment he
goes to sleep I used to study every vlog
in bed yeah like Lily felt for a long
time like there was just a third person
in the relationship and like anything
any experience that we had together we
were sharing with someone which on one
hand was amazing and I make videos as
well so I love sharing everything with
you guys but on the other hand there are
you just sometimes you need to be alone
and you need to be like sharing things
the two of you and growing as a couple
and it's getting better isn't it yeah
definitely I would okay I think my one
super quick is that the daily vlogs are
on his channel which I find very
difficult so with my videos I'm like no
I'm super confident and happy with the
videos that I put out with his videos
when someone else is filming you you
might not like look your best feel your
best and that kind of stuff and to be on
camera always on someone else's channel
we're also where the audience doesn't
know you that's huge for me because even
though my news videos all the time if
there's a lot of new viewers all the
time and there's I know some people at
deaf subscribe to you how many subscribe
to you yeah are the people that what
my videos subscribe yeah so I'm even
aware and feel super defensive like
although I hope that most of you guys
except Trier and a kind to her there's
always people that attack you like in
every video in every video that I upload
there's someone being mean to Riya like
even if just one person but that gets to
you and that I've noticed affects the
way you behave
on any of my vlogs yes you know there's
always like one or two people out there
digest I feel like there's like a bully
on the other side of the camera and so
when Louise shows the camera to me it's
like there's a bully like in my face and
I'm just like no I don't I'm so nervous
about it I'm gonna be in front of you
because I don't want to get picked on
but I know that it's a tiny minority and
I'm so grateful to all of you guys that
are really really kind to me and
honestly thank you so much from the very
beginning so many of you have been like
so kind to me and you were the reason
why I started a channel because so many
people were so loving that I wanted to
like be a part of this community um but
yeah I think that's that's definitely a
struggle and it's something just to and
I think we're even saying this tonight
we met some friends for dinner
that like you as a viewer and us as
viewers of other people you you often
forget that there's real people that
when you comment like you might not even
think we read comments but we do and
like that's a real person it's not a
fictional thing so you might say
something not realizing how hurtful that
could be you kind of need to put
yourself in other people's shoes imagine
even though you're a complete stranger
having someone judged you or say
something mean or just like you know
it's I've toughened up like I've had to
toughen up over the years but i struck
definitely struggle when people I love
are getting attacked and I'm just like I
like the biggest thing is would you say
what you're writing to that person's
face and most people that write mean
things wouldn't because when they see
you as a person in your human in front
of them they just I know I I can't
believe that people
those things but yeah it feels like so
detached when it's online and it feels
almost like a TV show but yeah it's just
important to remember that everyone you
watch on YouTube is real and they're
vulnerable and opening their lives to
you and it's something to be grateful
for as a viewer that I'm grateful for
all the youtubers i watch as well and
yeah just keep in mind yeah so in
general just be nice guys when you're
commenting it means a lot and it makes
people's day like the amount of sleep
the amount of youtubers I know and it
literally makes them there Dave if my
comments are the reason I keep creating
videos like the comments that I get on
my videos keep me going and every time I
upload a video that's the first thing
I'm like refreshing the comments and
reading them and replying and yeah they
mean a lot to a youtuber is that cool I
think we're gonna wrap up guys one thing
I'm seeing pop up a lot is are we gonna
do some kind of Meetup walk quickly
before we wrap up can you just comment
in the comments tree what we should do
as a meetup because I don't really just
want to meet up and around them location
and take selfies I don't have to take
selfies but let's do something like
should it be like a picnic and Kirsten
Bosh or so let us know if you're from
Cape Town or if you are not from Cape
Town but like the idea of giving more
meetups around the world like what kind
of stuff
Signal Hill and tell us what you think
of yeah instead of just like a meet-up
like well let's come and I'll take
selfies let's I feel like I like the
idea of us having meetups where we just
do something on the beach - Lions heads
hiking lots people resent hiking
beachbody
cool ok we'll look really guys there's
lots flying in great I think we're
wrapped for the night and we'll see you

sweet
