Bass Pro and American Airlines would
like to thank you for traveling without
exception

we have just landed in Miami
we've got like three or four hours wait
to get it off fly to London but that was
an amazing flight we saw tons of the
other Caribbean islands as we're flying
over mainly unfortunately even though
this is just a connecting flight to
London we still have to check in through
the u.s. immigration get our passports
checks and standing key for us and stuff
see
we've got a while this is our next
flight this is probably going to take
like two hours oh my gosh I'm exhausted
I've just took us an hour and a half
come through customs but finally
approaching your gate to fly to London
but we have to eat is we basically
skipped lunch so it's stopped in and I
think this is a Mexican restaurant maybe
in the airport well our meals have
arrived chicken fajitas Hillary's got
some chicken thing

bit badly even Hillary

basically my ear is getting but guitar
with cool trips away and hang out the
people would work with different brands
and stuff but I II would really love the
last you guys since you are the whole
reason my presence on YouTube and all
the videos making its what do you want
to see me doing like in terms of
adventures pushing the boundary with
boundaries of adventures obviously like
this weekend twist fun it's great to
hang out Hilary some of these nice
resort hotels are kind of the limits of
adventure they're just like so I pointed
out in the comments in a few days
that it's things like this which
actually then enable me I guess to
travel to other locations and do crazy
stuff that insider' in all of the crazy
stuff and really find like the most
remote locations the coolest people like
are saying I think last year in a blog I
really want to find inspirational people
and but also just yeah just I guess it's
rare unknown and activities and
experiences that push the boundaries to
show you guys and show the world if any
do you have any ideas or a read you know
there's cool articles about you know
places to go to or things to do leave in
the comments below your suggestions yeah
let's let's have some fun this year
that's all I wanted to say really is
that I want to have even more adventures
include you guys in more adventures as
well and yeah hopefully we see some
crazy things together I'm going to
not be blogging tomorrow it's sadly it's
my grandma's funeral
I shared a while ago the tip that she'd
died and I was like apparently there's a
massive backlog of feelings because it's
wintertime as our elderly people are
Boston playing so anyway I mean the
funerals tomorrow with families I'll be
with my family all day there'll be yeah

guess to be filming everything also it's
nice to try to take some time off so I

track and Wednesday but I just wanted to
say thank you guys for journeying with
me through the ups and downs and me
experimenting trying new things
