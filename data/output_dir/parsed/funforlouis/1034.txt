hey guys my name is Marcus Verde and I'm
from Australia and no I don't ride a
kangaroo to school or work just in case
you're wondering but in case you have
forgotten you're watching fun for Louie
so enjoy right I have got quite late
today and come down for some lunch
what's for lunch dad potato we are now
going on a little outing to Risley
Gardens which is just on the right and
means Darcy would quite like a copy
right now are you excited about that I
like rhubarb and custard and what we
found yet is a revolt
right we're walking through the gardens
now and das just pointed out that it's
beautiful at the moment because there's
its water droplets all over the plants
flowers and stuff and the Sun so it
makes it makes a good photos
look at the size of these leaves these
massive those are ginormous leaves
cheers cheers dad
cheers Darcy this is a cool Japanese
looking familiar
don't put your finger in is now big of
you
but that's gonna try and catch when they
wake up I can't even get this done
that's not
- gate
Larry is this an easy job watching
actually fish fatigue me underwater
those fish were a lot of fun
right now we're climbing we're
environment burger house and my Oreo
milkshake matteri
and were these these are courgette pies
okay that's spicy sauce on that yeah
we have finished our food and we are now
jumping on some Boris bikes for for a
late night cycle right somewhere I don't
know where we're gonna make up
Clemmy didn't cross the road in time
and now she's stuck we have to wait to
the traffic
so this is basically turning to what I
did last night wandering out London but
we're just cycling around aimlessly
having a good catch up and I think I'm
very thirsty so I stopped off for a
little refreshment
where we ducked our Boris bikes and I
imports heavy hey I've jumped back and
Rodney now I'm just trying to warm up
after quite a chilly side ride it's a
lot of fun though but it's been really
nice seeing Clemmy this evening Clarence
one of those people that's just a joy to
be around you know those people that
just other night just bring you so much
life very refreshing
yeah at least hanging out we were we
were actually pretty close couple years
ago quite a while wrong I'm gonna pick
up a hitchhiker I just stopped and he's
had his thumb out I think there's so
many little things we can do that aren't
a big hassle to us but they mean the
world to other people and for me just to
pull over third
you know from 30 seconds and
and drop that guy a minute down the road
it's nothing for me but make such a
difference to him you know I think
there's so many examples like that bike
I'm not necessarily saying it will just
pick up hitchhikers there's so many
things we can do sometimes which a
minimal effort but have such an impact
on other people's lives comment below if
there's things that you guys have done
or to think of that don't take a lot of
an out of our time buck and mean a lot
to other people and I'll challenge you
maybe to go out and and do one of those
things which might might not be a lot
for you but yeah it could change them as
day you know put smile in someone's face
right I just got back to my parents
house I think I'm gonna head off to bed
I'm trying to make plans this week
because it's half-term to go away on a
bit of an adventure at Darcy and I'll
keep you guys updated with that yeah
I'll catch you tomorrow
peace out enjoy life
