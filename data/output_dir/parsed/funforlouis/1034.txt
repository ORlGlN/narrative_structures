York before going back to London I was
gonna be flying on the weekend but the
weather in Rio is looking really really
bad by then let's sit inside was it's

better get a few things together and
organized well as time to get some lunch
I am absolutely starving guys I've spent
all the morning and early afternoon just
finishing my vlogs getting them edited
my latest was uploading now I forget it
out tonight before I head off but
there's a good sense of satisfaction
getting work done and I don't often see
my editing is work but when it completes
into my day of like focus get it up
this is rewarding is rewarding to finish
things

can make things in 3o
Assoc it's like to quit

that was good let's get some food
I feel energized I'm now strolling down
to the supermarket to try and get a
little gift for the lady who's house of
miss Damien
Oh flowers

much stuff to sort out I don't know if
any of you guys do this but when I
arrive somewhere I just like spread my
things out I like empty my bags all my
clothes are down there I've just got
random like wires and everything just
spilled everywhere it's not good it's
not good when I was lost packing from
home to come away I asked him guys if
you knew ways to keep things from
wrinkling and someone suggested rolling
my clothes dependent so I've rolled all
my clothes up and I'm about to squeeze
them in here let's see how that goes
they kind of fit I should have to me
alone it was a zip it come on baby
almost unpacking guys and Cody is put
past to say goodbye because I was yeah
wasn't planning on leaving Rio this
early I was actually gonna say to the
end of the week but then the weather's
bad and the only flight I could get to
New York with tonight so it's just
turned out that way but he's brought me
a gift and these are cool I've seen them
do this in the beach they're like it's
like handbag minton you kind of
demonstrate you're gonna chuck to each
other oh right let me check it - you
knew - you force it back you kind of
took it to each other yeah instead of a
bat you sees your hands I don't know
what it's cool if anyone knows it leaves
a cool thing I mean I have fairly
awesome thing yeah feathery awesome Jay
get amazing packing skills bro
there you go
almost got it you can iron that out
later so close but so far man oh oh
there goes cool my stuff left the place
and we might just wander down to the
beach quickly and cheer a little bit and
then I'm gonna grab a cab to the airport
we got a cab silly
and chime as well I just a bit worried
be a lot of traffic would be late but
what
perfect I'm a chicken now it is nice to
be back for penny balls from the airport
a little bit worried because they're
fighting in conformation on this flight
I asked the lady on the phone to email
me but I never got email confirming the
change of days so I guess I'll just have
to say please locate my reservation
there seems big problem he's asked me to
follow him over here anything let's find
something out like I think I have to pay
again some kind of difference for the
ticket
and still some problems I'm not sure
what's going on all sorted guys all so
I knew there'd be some kind of problem
to solve so last minute
I'm so dehydrated guys haven't been
drinking in the men's day some stupid
reason
to start probing headache
Edouard settling down for the night
we've got about seven hours left
capitalize off that's the end of the
noid we're arriving like 6 a.m. but it's
big very short day today obviously
my god well a lot editing doing all that
stuff and then I was rushing because
there will go the plane but here we are
and I thought the speed of the brilliant
opportunity to have another chat with
you guys now over the last week of SIA
been hanging out my dad and sister
any of you have been leaving mean
comments towards Darcy now obviously I
met brother
I feel protective of my little sister on
straight up and people in the comments
that is leaving unnecessarily mean
comments they just doesn't apply to
Darcy only there's time to learn with
friends or there's people in my folks
and people for some reason want to be
nasty
okay now I've held back having a rant
about this by thoughts of our time there
they see they're fairly new subscribers
my comment section isn't a place for
negativity okay long-term subscribers to
know you this is a place of
encouragement and a place where be nice
to each other
okay so I'm just going to set the rules
if I see otherwise I will be banning
people but I don't want to have to I
just think we can all be a community
together where we are
so sorry for that little rat
I don't often want to have to do that
but it needed to be said and if you're
watching and reading the comments and
stuff I need you guys that are being
positive or if to remind people nicely
if they're leaving negative stuff and
you've you have been really good at
outside
I nearly ran over my nose
I now have I think four days New York
when I land I'll have no pants zero
glands it'd be nice to have a bit of a
look around
I've got a couple of friends that are
living in New York I'll probably be
aren't with and maybe you guys can leave
in the comments and suggestions at all
stuff like where key fun things that you
know of in New York not just the typical
my tourist things but some other things
as well being awesome and then I'm
heading for the weekend back to London
I do love right now I feel full of
energy because of the fact that just
doing to be spontaneous noise so I think
I'm going to leave you with a challenge
before I sign off just to do something
spontaneous this week and it doesn't
have to be a spontaneous it's just
flight to New York
same day but it could be just something
simple small
but let me know if you end up doing that
because maybe filming
maybe these ain't spontaneous there
eating other than Oh catch you guys
tomorrow in New York City
teased out into a life
