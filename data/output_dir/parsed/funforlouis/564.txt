good afternoon guys today we've decided
to go up Table Mountain it was a little
bit cloudy this morning so we had to
wait until it cleared up but now it is
perfect and it's worked out quite well
because today's clouds last day so she
gets to experience one of the the best
things to do in Cape Town in my opinion
I'm gonna get the cable car up and down
a little bit less effort and then
walking here you guys ready to go out
Table Mountain yeah came in five tiers
of two so I gave one to you guys the
floor is rotating
I'm building with you is all I needed to
do and in every kind of the top never
gets old
this is right its first time up Table
Mountain would you think
I prefer this side though to the city of
that yeah looking like ghosts do you see
that guys ready to go twice a minute
nothing to say
I decided another quite like to go on a
hike like in a more remote part of Table
Mountain I've done it before like ages
ago I mean I did it last year we hiked
to the top buck I'd love to do it like
kind of over there somewhere
yeah there's nowhere no one else
zigzag path down hey that's crazy
imagine walk no matter

here one of those is our car time to
head back down me to get to hello to the
airport

to the airport we're gonna get a little
drink and snack and enjoy this

food inside of us and this is Indian
food which is a little bit of change
from Thai food mixed dying from what
from vindaloo anything spice makes you
bleed I've just got flavor onion bhajis

samosas because I don't know they're
pulling my leg but apparently they call
them some Musa serving some authors do

gone to bed Raya actually went to bed at
9:00 p.m. which I thought was pretty
ridiculous
she missed dinner and everything I've
been up trying to get some more editing
done I just realized I got so distracted
the last couple of weeks with with what
we were up to that I totally forgot I
hadn't uploaded my 2015 montage video
yet which I've kept some promising to
you guys so I think I'm gonna try and
plow through a lot of that tomorrow I
also want to show Raya a bit of Cape
Town because she hasn't been here before
really and there's so much to see so
we're gonna try and planning some fun
things hopefully shark cage diving which
I've never actually done I attempted to
do it in like 2009 but we didn't
actually see any sharks or we weren't
allowed in the water or something and
she wants to go paragliding she wants to
go see the Penguins so we'll we'll have
some final next couple of days
alright I'll see you tomorrow peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure boom
