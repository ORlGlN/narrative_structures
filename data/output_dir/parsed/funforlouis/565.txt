get off the name guys we've come to a
cave sounds with Burghardt and it's got
all these colorful buildings so we're
gonna go for a little wonder maybe get
some cool photos and stuff
I think all streets should be this color

trying to figure out which one's the
best color oh I like this green this is
cool green what we found Riya yeah are
they the same ones for Singapore yeah

Justin epic photos I'm always looking
for places like this and this is the
prime spot
well that was a very short little trip
mainly for Justin and Brittany because
they're leaving tonight I think I'm
definitely going to come back for a more
extensive photoshoot another time
by getting some lunch
truthfully that was
yeah Cheers
turns out these guys are off to the
airport see you later

you back at the house we're getting an
uber back go make a plan for stuff Denis

big time there we go yeah and then move
you all the wrists from side to side
then it's next give me some pointers
just keeping steady
just keep trying to keep steady change
your but it's all in the but all in the
pants so if you look at your tire you
probably be better work wasted balancing
look at the nut there
keep focused on that
find both enter

time rise sharing some mango with a salt
we're watching movie trailers to find
out what we should watch in the cinema
tonight me and Nick quite keen to watch
James Bond the girls however want to
watch the good dinosaur which one we're
trying to find something maybe that
compromises maybe something with an
action film with Dinosaurs yeah that
sounds good to me
I'm also trying to figure out my GoPro
situation because I was a little bit
gutted I didn't get to film the 316th
the manta ray so I need to figure this
out for next time thank you
make better everyone
okay front some so now you need a club
just make sure your head doesn't go over
the other side
so we're walking down to get some food
at a Thai restaurant and we're just
having a conversation about facing fears
and whether you should push people out
of their comfort zones and Nick
apparently in his Marisa and has been
very persuasive in pushing her out of
her comfort zones or helping her step
out so that kind of thing yeah divers
yeah so the question is for you guys do
you think it's good to help people push
out their comfort zones or should do
respect people's first decision on
whether they want to do something like
that no I think it's good to push people
personally or do you just let them
surely should you push people unit they
say like slightly hesitant like should
you should you gently nudge people in
literally because then they might
discover something that they didn't know
that they enjoyed you can't stay in
decomposition so you can have you up but
you're not gonna I saw a great phrase
the other day something like nothing new
no something like nothing news ever
discovered in Campinas comfort zone the
article Sofia girl says he hates calling
it your comfort zone because a comfort
zone sounds way too comfortable
oh yeah I know we really lay on the
facebook train we can't get enough of it
oh my goodness my name is :
oh why can't it ever look normal
it's the end of the evening we just
watched a movie or cuddled up on the
sofas and I enjoy days like this where
it's just like a slower pace we're not
doing a lot kind of winding down after a
pretty full-on week it's sad to see
Britney and Justin guy the family is
slowly splitting up kal-el was about the
head off tomorrow back to LA Mira is
sticking around for another like five
days or something we should be cool
