good afternoon guys I'm feeling a little
bit drowsy today I slept most today and
I think unfortunately I've fallen back
into the American time zone and yeah I
haven't quite got rid of the jetlag yet
I made it worse by staying up late with
Steve last night playing Pokemon go I am
about to head over to the train station
pick up Sylvia and she's gonna run she's
gonna help me sort my dreads out because
they're getting a bit too fluffy oh I
love your wizard oh so sorry for taking
no sorry be hittin sorry the trains are
so bad right let's let the dredge repair
again I think this is is this the worst
you've seen it since we started you know
what I don't know anymore but it's yeah
it's not the greatest some of my dreads
have like joined together some of them
have got so thin they're about to pull
out uh I haven't been caring for them
much but Sylvia same part of things yeah
let me take care this is good
well we've had a bit of lunch Sylvia's
getting back on it I think we're making
some progress yes is it mainly in the
back that's kind of messed up well the
back is more grown together yeah hunt is
more just like fluffy and right we're
about halfway timewise because the whole
day was delayed because of the trains
and stuff and still be getting here
later um I had planned in tonight's go
and see my friend and her birthday thing
it's a little barbecue down the road so
I'm going to pop down there quickly say
hi make it brief just see a few my
friends are then come back here for
Sylvia to finish the rest but thank you
so much you've made some good progress
well guys I just had the nicest couple
of hours catch up with some friends
saying hi to my friend Amy whose
birthday it is
and just to something very heartwarming
about seeing seeing people that have had
an impact in your life and and had a
real you know this history there you
know so I saw a lot of people we've got
a lot of history with and really very
warm and fuzzy as usual and I've
organized to have probably little catch
our TV this week because these big
social events you don't often have those
deep conversations you know because it's
a bit hectic but it's good I'm glad I
pop town to see you need to do that
we've had to move inside because it's
got dark outside even though the Sun is
saying so late at the moment it's like
10:00 to 10:00 right now and it's only
just got that like 30 darts
I think that's I'm saying I like 9 which
is so awesome but Sylvia how are you
getting on get we got to dreadlocks left
they're the hardest to do because they
cut on the top and in the front we've
got this
Yeah right nothing
yeah good log family back again added
neat dreads the route you're doing this
one yeah
just rolling then getting all the fluffy
hairs I don't if you can see and then so
taking that those hairs and then putting
crochet hook through the dread hook it
onto the deck onto the lose hair pull it
back it sounds simple but it takes a lot
of practice
I was worried some of the ones at the
back we're gonna fall out they got
stabbed in it believe in the book super
thin mrs. Finn but this shouldn't fall
out alright I think so cuz now is
holding on to like this amount of hair
okay let me just flip thank you I fell
out I'm gonna come back from traveling
at one at some point I'm gonna have like
a dreadlock that's fuller now me like
Sylvia can we put this packet in so now
sure we can I feel like that is gonna oh
no what did it happen a beautiful no no
yeah I think maybe does it did it almost
it almost happened it's like literally
hanging on by no nudging leaving
dreadlocks I think the main problem is
because what I originally got this done
years ago I think is like 12 13 years
ago down the my hair I think I've said
this before what my head wasn't
separated out properly as like a grid so
some of my dreadlocks are really fat and
some of them are really thin and
tell you yeah questioning the best way
to do it section it equally so you can
get the even size dreadlocks basically
loads loads of videos on YouTube about
the brick pattern the brick pattern
that's what you want for dreadlocks
really for not like a grid
yeah not completely two-digit straight
square so it's just like yeah so it's
like so you know for example this to
dreadlocks here so therefore you would
put one then between so when it falls
kind of yes yeah but also see
everybody's scalp is different you know
you have to kind of adapt everybody's
call swing Sylvia's just point out how
long my dreads are getting more ended oh
they're long yeah if you yeah if you
reach back stand straight now this
stupid normally yeah it doesn't feel too
heavy does it no it's pretty good
oh they feel really nice also good oh
yeah done a good job he just felt so bad
meeting the dread around your and bruise
like everyday go is here today say
because I think you can see not that's
what is up from the same yeah hey make
my head Rumsey day on the bus you're fed
eyes up
well I'm job sooner off she's heading
home
it's got pretty like some whisper
midnight Steve rang me and he's Kings do
another late-night Pokemon mission he's
a little bit tired though because unlike
me he never sleep Roubaix so I'm gonna
go pick him up I was hoping to see Ben
tonight because Ben's been on this
Pokemon game as well but he he's going
to catch an early at night and hopefully
we're going to catch up tomorrow instead
means teaming just going to go for short
ones and I probably have like an hour
we're just going to cruise around
see if I can level up some more really
tired
Steve give you dragging me out what you
saying man we going on this fatal thing

live and it's one bank as well
no yeah didn't even put them fight guys
we're in for a little walk
I left my camera in the car and just cuz
I got too distracted to vlog this is not
good for vlogging I'm telling it but we
did meet these cool guys and they were
saying that they haven't made this many
friends since I playing Pokemon since
they're at high school it is amazing I
think that's pretty amazing so yeah I
like I'm saying yesterday I think this
is a bit of a revolution happening and
leveled up just now we 10 level 11 in a
day pretty much a day for it just over a
day bro you're not me oh my gosh guys
look at this
no joke look how many Pokemon around
here it's like seven oh I need that

pot of two V's sitting here if you wanna
play pokemon we'll just come here oh my
gosh won't get what is the hunger do oh
sorry that's how you catch pokemon they
get him that's it really what do I know

I'm going to try and reset my body clock
again I started doing it in the last
week and me and Mike are gonna head back
over to the bus and get cracking with

out figure out a bit of a battle plan
for the coming three weeks we've got
until the first deadline to get the hot
tub installed so we're going to be
making some big decisions tomorrow and
cracking on with the bus and then
