okay so just got to Nottingham just
about to park up for the night
it's like half 3:00 in the morning and I
Drive into a service station and didn't
see a curb oh I just heard a massive
bang noise and now it's done to the bus
you can see
this is under the bus and it dislodged
by the curb when I went over this is a
very vital valve for the air system and
as I was trying to remove the water tank
which what this loved I knocked the
valve luckily I found the little bow
that full enough but in the process I
have to climb under the bus and
