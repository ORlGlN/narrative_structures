vote which has several hundred years of
tradition and it is the family business

Barbara Barbara's the boat name by the
way
somehow we've ended up driving down the
strip off so we just carefully back it
up sure we get to be top of the class so
we're going to pop up there before we
eat lunch now because the Sun is gonna
say otherwise oil is so gorgeous this
coaster was called
to let Blake ski flaky flaky grad this
was the first records of his courses I
don't know exactly on his belt was from
the Year 1007 11 1011 right and so
that's the very long time that's a
thousand six years old pretty crazy
so that one day we live in a coastal
brush big castle with all our friends
have the awesomeness it's quite amazing
view that way as well when we got to the
highest point wealthy it is printing on
a fork
this castle there's some significant
with the history of printing not on some
follow exactly what the significance is
that yes Slovenian printing history this
is this design of this machines like
hundreds of years old and we just
watched like a little demonstration of
doing this and we also just told a crazy
interesting facts that the term lower
and upper case comes from the literal
case that they used to pull the letters
out of so the upper side of the case was
the caps lock and down here with a lower
case I also just found out that before
kind of like the nineteen seventies all
newspaper printing and book printing was
done like it's like manually doing the
letters would have been such a big job
to print anything so now we're going for
lunch it's pretty much tin an hour
thirty
what we call a miss din dinner or lunch
this is right is we're staying tonight
this is our last night in Slovenia so
the first port call we came to the hotel
which the heads straight to the spa area
and I've just been sitting in a sauna
for quite a while and very hot now we're
now on Kristin and the serum we've
ordered a lot of food look at when you
arrive you got we got smoothies or
literally the phone we had like one
minute till they ended room service
knowledge which like making stuff up
making stuff up
we got vegetable pan of duck this was
not on the menu
I got I got two dishes in case of hungry
or someone else is hungry so then listen
here you mean that's so fat Wow did have
asparagus oh we have come back to our
room that's a really nice evening
hanging out of everyone and yes be nice
just to wind down today after quite a
few full-on days of activities I did
really enjoy today though I had Lake
Bled on my list of places on being my
bucket list for a while and yeah it was
pretty spectacular I think I'd like to
come back here in the summer though
because a lot of the forests and just
the scenic mountains that I think it'll
look very different when it's really
green and yeah so I think that's a plan
where we are talking about some kind of
end of summer Europe trip at the
potential thing say yeah sure that
happened tomorrow unfortunately we are
leaving Slovenia we are continuing the
road trip though into Italy and we
decided tonight that because Venice is
on our route we are probably going to
pop into Venice and have a little walk
around and then we are ending up in I
can't
where we're going but we've got a lot of
very cool plans in Italy as well and I
can't wait to show you guys and also I
think this is just so exciting for me
because we're getting to hang out as a
group of creators bond together and this
I just feel like we're building this
this bigger narrative it's kind of
collective force this like you know
squad of awesome people that we get to
do a lot of adventures in the future
with and stuff so and yeah I'm really
happy even though it's been quite tiring
anyway I'll catch any morning peace out
enjoy life Olivia's venture boom
