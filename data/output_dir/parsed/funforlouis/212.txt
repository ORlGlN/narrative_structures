hola soy Mario there's espa√±a y esto es
for for Luis
dentro video boom morning guys is still
in Mexico I had myself sleep on the sofa
last night
and JP did a massive driving
we have a little problem this morning
we're only a couple of miles the US
border we decided to fill up with fuel
and the the petrol station doesn't
accept our cards for some reason so a
good friend Victor here is a sporting
it's down the road on an ATM so we can
withdraw some money
you're willing to be on our way
pigs uh hired a match they were doing
all right I mean probably
place in about an hour and a half now
unfortunately we thought we'd be in the
US by now so we missed the opening of
the border so its fullest our four
syllable spirits yeah we're good we're
good
oK we've managed to pay for fuel we're
now moments away from America this is
actually America the other side of that
River so having a bit of a chair would
sound this morning we Samurai both in
our night shift and it's a pretty long
night driving we've just got woken up to
get not a shift on and just Sam's shout
wasn't really the best so he's driving
back here and I've just decided to jump
on this truck just to have a little luck
to see what it's like being with a
Mexican driver more but I feel very fast
I've just jumped into the driving seat
I'm gonna drive it across the border I
feel like that's a little bit more legit
since it's now my bus so just about to
cross this bridge from Mexico
into the United States this is a tight
squeeze our buses Parma straddling
Mexico and America I'm in America
JEP still in Mexico so this is the US
Customs and Border Protection guides
escorting us somewhere not racial the
passports really I love that all our
password
we're going to Austin and then we're
going to California

contraption that's gonna scan the bus I
assume to see we're going if we've got a
stowaway we've got we've got a GoPro
okay okay guys we got caught filming at
the border babe advice it's not worth it
thankfully it all turned out okay we
didn't have to wait too long maybe now
we are in America and I feel great if
this was like our big worried not
getting the bus it's because

leak anyway where we've plugged our hose
in and we're filling up a water tank

were filling the wrong one the main
water tank so we're gonna plug it into
one of these taps yeah open to easy
boom semi-successful water pump test
we've gotta tap working what people
figure out the shower but the urgent
matter at hand now is parking the bus
stop for the night and cruising down
into town get some food and meat
when trying to find where the polarizer
get feedback at the penny

he is doing a CNN party tonight so we
are cruising down to meet with him now

apartment isn't it it's my home

spot to head to wall marks as a few
things pick up

we do everything we came in for I don't
even know what we got but I do know I'm
deliriously tired and I cannot wait to
jump in the bus and get some sleep
