good afternoon guys we are leaving our
Airbnb in Abood today to go to another
Airbnb in a bit we extended our trip we
were originally going to fly out today
but we've had a few days off this is
just so nice here although it's rainy
season and it's about to like Chucky's
down with rain and we're going to a
really really nice villa next so we
better get on the road
welcome to rainy season in Bali
I'm glad we're not on the moped right
now
we think we've arrived either we've
arrived or we're just walking to some
random person's house for this yeah to
do a mere baby
oh yeah yeah this is cool
yeah lightly sculptures
Oh
I'm just getting a little tour oh cool
Wow massage beds perfect yeah that'd be
great
so a little living room yeah okay for a
swimming pool overlooking a paddy field
that's cool
oh I definitely think you have a bath
there all right we just check in the
upstairs room oh yeah the bamboo room
are we gonna stay in the bamboo room so
I'll give you guys a proper tour of our
place tomorrow but we're gonna head out
now
I'm really hungry I'm gonna pop next
door apparently there's like a
restaurant there and get some food this
is cool though this is this must be like
the biggest place we've stayed his four
bedrooms but it's so cheap it was it was
fine it's still only like a hundred
dollars a night
this is nice yeah - second off my place
though
yes thank you
I'm a delicious
we have finished up the lunch and now we
are going to cruise back down into town
the rain is chilled out and we're going
to take a little stroll and see some of
the cool things here
to go up to where
let's find a coffee place oh this is
coffee it's getting perfect guys look
how amazing some of these doorways are
so all night so cool
yeah
like the culture here so really
preserved like when I
that holiday
like decorations everywhere and
everyone's kind of celebrating the local
culture
so it's touristy but it's still
there's like right in town
so we're just checking out this movie
theater that we might go through tonight
we have our tickets we're going to come
back in a couple of hours part of this
place where even after taxes eat that
food there unlike candy couches and
watching movies oh so we would have gone
free to walk around here earlier but it
was absolutely trucking with rain all
day so we've only just got a chance to
come out and it's still not completely
stopped raining but this is just about
bearable dicey doorways like this I
don't know like whether there he was
houses or what but they have cool like
little shrines the nerman are we just
wandering into someone's house
whoa what even is that is that this
summer's house probably probably a
shrine as an Internet
it's so quickly in it you make a wish
oh look at the fish that rhymed guys so
much inspiration
so many of the places are like fill out
of bamboo and have cool furniture and
stuff and as you know me and Raya are
thinking of basing up somewhere for a
bit
well obviously tea will be travelling
bar we're thinking of having our own
place long term it's the treehouse
vision but that's going to take a while
and in the meantime some of you may know
we're thinking of facing up in LA
however we do need to do a bit of
decorating when we get our place so
we're just getting some inspiration here
for furniture and Riya said last time
she was here she found some really
amazing furniture stores in you there's
one where I was like you sell online and
they did it so we're only gonna get
inspiration because you can't actually
buy yeah I don't think we're gonna go as
far as importing stuff in Bali but maybe
maybe one day we can come back with a
huge suitcases and just get handle stuff
here
so this area is monkey forest and I'm
going to be exploring here properly
during the day that it's got very dark
right now that the road signs caution
monkey crossing take care of his stuff
these monkeys are thieves and they steal
everything
be careful bro don't try yourself on the
lines
now I'm not stupid into ornaments but I
could vibe with one of these like tree
things imagine if we got souvenirs from
everywhere we went we should use like
one mother thing
yeah wouldn't we fill an entire house
with them get one little thing oh yeah
let's get one of these guys no they look
happy smiling this is a smile wall
there's a shop this is really nice
I'm loving how bright it isn't here well
well-lit spaces are my favorite like
rustic but well lit you don't have to
dingy guys look how cool this chair is I
love that I think I like the big hands
that this this guy this guy's coolest
would it not that I really don't like
that what's that one it's just to to
blink
yeah that's not the vibe regarding for
this
yeah
I hope we get a place we have lots of
trees oh yeah so we can hang lights in
them right it's movie time check out how
cool your cinema is okay guys we have
just left the movie that was absolutely
incredible
it was Michael Moore's new documentary
called where to invade next I don't have
you heard about it but I'm not gonna
really do it basically it just made me
walk away feeling like as a lot of these
documentaries do feeling like I really
want to make more of a difference and
use this platform to highlight more
important stuff as well as my travels
and adventures and enjoying things and
having fun is yeah highlighting things
to make a difference in the world and
seeing things change and campaigning for
change and yeah I'm going to continue to
think of ways to do that and include you
guys in my travels and I guess like for
this trip although a lot of its being
having fun and having fun with friends
things like the green school we went to
if you didn't see that vlog we should go
and check it out but highlighting cool
things that happening that we should
learn from so that's what I'd like to
see more so we just got home watching
words invade next and having some dinner
and living average having over dinner
about what we thought and what we kind
of got out of it and I I guess I went
sit down and chat to you guys about what
I thought because I had a very different
perspective because I actually grew up
in America so basically the premise of
the movie is um Michael Moore goes to a
bunch of different countries mainly in
Europe but kind of round the world and
looks at kind of systems that are in
place that are different than the way
America
so for example education or prison
system or laws on drugs things like that
and he focuses on like certain countries
and the way they've done it and how it
is probably organized better than the
way America is doing it so it's kind of
like to show so it's like where are we
going to invade to kind of take their
ideas and like make them our own so
anyway for me I moved to America when I
was 9 or 10 and I went to school in
America for about eight years where I
went to uni in London and growing up in
America there's this huge feeling that's
like pushed on you that America is the
best place in the world and for me what
this movie did is it kind of showed like
with facts and examples how there are
things that America is doing that aren't
the best and they're not the best of
they're being done around the world and
I thought that was I just thought that
that was an incredible message to spread
because for me this is actually kind of
why I want to like spend my life
inspiring people to travel because to me
traveling and seeing how different
cultures live is kind of popping you out
of your little bubble of where you live
or where you've grown up and showing you
that people do things differently in
different parts of the world it's
important for all of us to have the
opportunity to question because just
because we're being told that something
is done right doesn't necessarily mean
that it's true or that it hasn't been
outdated so for just one super quick
example is that I went to high school in
America and then I went to uni in London
and the reason
on to uni outside of America is because
I couldn't afford to go to school in
America it was extremely expensive for
me to go to college or university in
America and when I was telling my
friends and even my like college
counselors that I wanted to apply
outside of America like none of them
really understood what that meant or why
I would ever do that like Americans just
say America has the best education
system why would I go study anywhere
else obviously not all of them but
that's just a general kind of mindset
that's around the education system and
the reason I went to school in London is
because it was significantly cheaper I
was actually able to pay well like for
my whole tuition while I was in school
instead of having $200,000 debt which is
what would have happened if I got school
in America and this is a little example
that Americans a lot of them don't even
realize that there's other places where
school is free or cheap if everyone
could just kind of question and do some
research and understand that that's not
the way it's done everywhere then
hopefully we can all just kind of not
only like grow and learn and be more
accepting but also be more willing to
fight for what we believe is right I
encourage all of you to question and to
research and to just decide for
yourselves what you think is right
versus just kind of taking everything is
you know what people tell us is right so
yeah anyway sorry like that
that's the neural bug it's a overall a
very inspiring night and we'd love to
know any other documentaries you guys
recommend please comment below and we'll
catch you tomorrow for more fun in Bali
peace out
enjoy life lived adventure
