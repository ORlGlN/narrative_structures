so our first flight is to Bucharest the
capital of Romania and I think we've got
like a three-hour layover and then we're
heading to Cluj which is a town or city
and then I think it's a three-hour drive
to the place we're heading which is
Kristy Roux the last time I'm there I
went with Nick day and Steve you may
remember we were helping like for an
ending with the project
what's up with our TV
Oh gentlemen we have just landed in
Bucharest ordinary kondeh airport please
remain seated features the function
until we have reached our final parking
position and the fasten seatbelt sign
has been switched off the rest
it was a flight no windows
I know what is that it's not Windows
doesn't know what that is
it's limit for them so I thought we
might have some time to chill in the
press but apparently we'll get straight
on our other flight so we're just we
have to like head out the arrivals got a
passport standing we're coming back into
the park now we're headed
and so we've arrived in Cluj there's a
going Lucas here pick us up he contacted
me online and said he he wanted to come
join the charity project Lucas yeah hey

we got three hour drive let's go let's
take a guy
Luke's his friend is coming to me after
this car gonna throw a bag from there
and then find something edible inside
ever spent time in this bar Romania

Bulgaria no way
we're on the hunt for food

the Internet in this Romanian shopping
mode and it's going to make down and
sixty mega yes

some like falafel hummus kind of vibes
I'm feeling that Riya what we found over
here
like a girl you would never guess guys
there that to be good be no sugar no
sugar dairy that's incredible like right
next to where you just happen to be
sitting
okay let's stay cool right in saying
guys we're still here I'm holding
everyone up because I'm trying to render
something and upload it convinced it's
so good here I just thought if I can get
this done before we get on the right
then we chills bust and the moment it
looks like we're going to be getting in
like well like 1:00 in the morning no
grades might stay up also I wanted to
clarify we don't actually know Lucas he
is essentially a stranger we are we're
arriving was like I don't hear this guy
is but he's a cool guy and we I think he
is a cool guy you're a cool guy
you're gonna look after us and these
guys maybe skipping school he's skipping
school yeah they were like well I hope
you got scores on their school so don't
skip school like that's very bad and
don't get too close the strangers view
though we are by the game
now these guys are awesome thanks for
helping us out and sorry for taking so
long with my my stuff so Philips gonna
be driving you 18 for that yeah and
Lucas is 17 he can't drive yet Philips
been driving for months how do you guys
feel about that
we've arrived in Chris theory but as we
pulled up to park
I think Phillips car is packed in
driving Shh okay rich okay well let's
push it into place because we are here
we we have arrived we just need to
figure out what steal the car now maybe
we can just push it and park it so we
push it over there we can try and fix it
in the morning maybe maybe Mike can help
oh so um we're gonna we're gonna try and
find this place we're staying in now so
guys the next dilemma is Philip and
Lucas to film their room like fetch the
keys for our room trying to follow the
instructions Mike left me which was go
outside go over to the main building and
then let yourself in and find room
number 8 I've been trying this key in
all of these doors and doesn't seem to
fit say I think this might be the wrong
building okay guys that I found out is
her left
I found out where we're staying yeah I
don't taste and everything there's a
tiny bear look at Goldilocks try the
next time
Oh a day of traveling all day traveling
I'm pretty exhausted so tomorrow I think
what the plan is we're gonna chill in
the morning catch all the sleep and then
hopefully go meet up with Mike and the
boys that are working in a nearby
village building a house so we're gonna
go and check out what they're doing and
maybe join in let me hang out with the
people there yeah it's cool to be back
I don't know you those you that might
have seen a vlog I did two years ago

came down here and basically went to the
same village and stuff so you may
remember that I'll actually link it
