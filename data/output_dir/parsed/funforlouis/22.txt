standing around in the pub drinking
personally but I'm glad the other guys
are having a fun night and hopefully I'm
gonna pick them up without accidentally
sliding and these g-wagen in off of the
side of the road because it's very icy
guys because and these cars automatic
I've gone into Tiptronic mode and I'm
staying in second gear and then your
device I had from handy because this is
a very heavy vehicle it's don't use the
brakes at all just to do all their
braking with the gears so engine braking

everyone home safely and yeah I think
it's bedtime it's about half three we

but just might change our plans tomorrow
a bit is that the weather isn't it
looking great it's gonna be really windy
so that some of the ski lifts might be
