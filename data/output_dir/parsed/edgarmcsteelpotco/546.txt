what's going on guys today thought I'd
make a quick video it's going to be a
call of duty black ops 3 video I know I
look far away but it's because I'm
filming with my fisheye so that I can be
shown in this video as you see by the
title we're going to be doing the Call
of Duty backfill challenge I think I'm
the first to do this I have a check um I
don't think many people could do this
but you know what we're gonna make it
happen today so let me search for a game
while I explain this alright so
basically I want to play Call of Duty
like I normally do I'm actually going to
try a lot because I don't want to keep
doing backflips but what's going to
happen is every time I'm killed I have
to stand up and do a backflip and yeah
that's basically it there's literally
two feet of space in between my couch
the tripod leg is right under my hand
right here as you can see and then two
right here so let's just hope that I
don't land on my computer or anything
else I'm not in the back flippin mood I
haven't done any flips in the last
couple of days just cuz I've this
sickness I've been having is really
weird and I've been having like like he
flashes and stuff like that honestly
horrible alright um to make this a
little bit more interesting I've got to
use the locust wake and easy yet but
let's do this and everytime I get a kill
I get a kiss Selena Gomez so we were
playing this close I probably still look
far away guy up on the roof
jump Gotti the guy around here
gotta get killed already okay I'm gonna
try to not do too many camera cuts
because I want this be done sorry

a while strike started to suck let me

teach me in my cult duty way is how to
be a better player because backflips get
