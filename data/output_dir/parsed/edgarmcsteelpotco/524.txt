what's up guys I posted something today
on Instagram and said give me YouTube
ideas for whatever video you want today
and my friend Dylan Cody told me to make
a stunt where I light my pants on fire
and then I jump off this trampoline into
the pool planning on doing a double
front not too sure yet after like four
hours of trying to get my parents to let
me do it I'm pretty sure that my dad
will be back in an hour
hopefully cuz I really want to do it now
make sure you don't try this at home
even though I'm doing it don't burns
hurt is what I've heard I've never been
burned by anything but a stove maybe
some hot water yeah don't try this at
home it's gonna be sweet though I got to
go find some pants and put on like two
pairs of shirts and hopefully I can swim
with all the clothes on
alright so my dad just pulled up out
there I've got three pairs of pants on
to my scarf and my stocking cap that I'm
gonna wear with my pink boots and then
two sweatshirts wish me luck
I think we're gonna use lighter fluid
maybe hair spray not sure I'm gonna go
out open the pool hopefully everything
goes to plan this would be epic if it
does and I want a big flame but I don't
wanna get burned
haha I still have the tag on let me go
open the pool I feel like a new man
never seen you wear this Taylor so I
think she'll be fine
you
Wow I smell like lighter fluid man this
stuff's heavy all right oh gosh I feel
like I weigh 70 pounds like 70 pounds
more
whenever the flavors are rising super
fast discount scary no wonder people
don't stop drop and roll and they just
run around and scream a little bit huh
guys that's it for today's video
um leave a like cuz I set myself on fire
yeah these these pants are fine so
that's okay but yeah leave a like

close the camera with my hand but I'm a
little wet so peace out
