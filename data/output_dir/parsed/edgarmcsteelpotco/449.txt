Pizza has arrived what is on my lens
what's up guys it is morning now and we
are about to head out to a parkour gym I
just found like eight hours editing this
video so if you guys haven't watched it
please go check it out it's really good
I loved it and you will too and I'm here
with Caleb
Luke Madison we're about to go to some
parkour gym and I already said this and
what's get I got to go upload this in
the car or at a restaurant where we go
and I am so freakin sore this morning
from the last few days of trampoline
since I like hardly ever trampoline
anymore and it's raining and I want to
know how I'm gonna get my laptop in
Luke's car we'll figure it out shortly
hey Lou yeah it's raining the life of a
youtuber when it rains I don't have any
energy I'm about to go in here and pay
to sit down parkour and freeway I'm
going right here all right well we
forgot we have to sign waivers to places
usually so we're going to go to some
other place with trampoline so I don't
put as much energy into my flips
youtuber problems
one of those days that every flipper has
where you can't land anything oh
these drippings you suck I'm hoping
these tramps are better
kind of soft boom though I want these in
my backyard
for everyone wondering yes I did that on
purpose
and then you got the perfect
I might do that on grass someday like
Honda pads
slowest double for a full contest
well I just messed up my left ankle
again well not even my ankle it's just
right here
I should probably quit doing as many
flips especially ones that you know tear
the front of my foot so I'm not gonna do
any more flips or us a day I'll do them
into the lake but that's about it
ah
I'm just waiting for a tire to fall
right off
that was awesome but I'm not dumb enough
to participate in stuff like that yet
explain to us what's happening all right
so we go in the room and we put a bunch
of lotion on the fan and then we turn
the fan on and there's fin lotion it's a
lotion part go get the X X yeah the gel
oh yeah right cuz we can't use all my
mom's stuff ha ha ha get her out of your
stove how you forgot this
it's oh my god it's literally flying
into the door Oh
hop in I got a hook for me grab some
towels oh dude all over the guitar why
oh my god why you tried to switch the
TV's so you get a bigger TV I guess you
actually kicked it over and I was like a
big white line all right we're leaving
here I'm about to go relearn how to do a
stick shift my dad taught me once but
I've pretty much forgotten since then so
I'm about to learn in Luke's car that
sounds crazier than it looks
see this car now listen
I feel like a driver all right we are at
a bowling alley and we're gonna go
can you guess it skiing do one foot back
foot off that team anything right there
do that really good I'll do it first you
want there you go
oh why to get what though somewhat
Clippers do when we get bored
wait I lied ooh I forgot how to do scoop
sounds great
what you couldn't do it in moccasins oh
dude that hurt my ankle has been so long
I swear every time I go out in public
with this camera everybody looks at me
looks around like I'm carrying like some
futuristic item I went out crazy nice
that feels lighter mom these are all
heavy
all right this is the one I'm tired of
sucking
guess what that strike it wasn't even
mine that was bull get it
they're better bowling from back here
that's bowling-ball 2016 it's not a
bowling ball it's a jawbreaker
you're right
that concludes the evening all right so

does it for this video yeah the next one

and cliff jumping and stuff so yeah
