we've got these pads because whenever
you're flipping on a pad you need more
pads tracking now don't drive fast
make sure nobody steals my pads decided
not to use the pads but see how soft
they are can't use the goal so we're
gonna have to try to use this thing
yeah good thing we checked got it
really put all my power into that and
barely made it
standing full
can't double back because nothing's with
you small and I don't feel like landing
on my head today or my face and we can't
pull them because they're like locked
into that wood all right guys up there
is a little platform I guess it's in the
middle of the lake not really in the
middle actually it's just like 50 feet
out from shore probably yeah after I get
done with church tonight I'm gonna swim
out there I'm gonna do a double back
because who cares yeah baseball they
told me not to wear jeans so I wore
jeans going into a little graduation
thingy and then church and then I'm
gonna go do a double backflip my age
what's up man I gotta go too so is this
just your car now or what I first own
the stop oh sure it is yeah baseball
twice in one day I even though I'm gonna
freeze today's the only day of the week
that is not gonna storm besides Friday
I'm not taking my chances of waiting
till then let's do this sorry the audio
still sounds horrible but it's morning
now because I didn't get the chance to
go yesterday because there's way too
many kids playing baseball and walking
around and fishermen and stuff so
hopefully there's not too many out today
I'm going to go ahead and put on my
wetsuit because it looks going to be
freezing and then we're going to head on
over so some people might be thinking
this is stupid but kids my age do a lot
worse so I did this about a year ago and
nothing happened but I was too scared to
double back for the year ago so there's
nobody down here so we're good
let's go gonna be cool guy
fucking 50-foot swim double back and
then another 50-foot swim
we're done the water is literally so
cold makes it hard to breathe I have to
get practicing for Hawaii my talk on
that was just so horrible I barely made
a double backflip I was so tired but I
couldn't sit up there and wait let's get
out of here we're safe at least it's
soft now thank you all for watching I'm
gonna go take a shower

filled that I'm at and all the time
