what's up guys yes I'm shirtless again
for you we tried to make a toilet paper
fort in Walmart oh my god hold up shout
out to the people the more yard you're
awesome yeah anyway we tried to make a
toilet paper fort in Walmart and it
didn't work we got kicked out but we're
going to try to go to a different
Walmart within like the next couple of
days and refill mitt but for now we're
just going to take out the in-ground
trampoline and we're going to try to put
it over there by the pool and do flips
into the pool
it's a lot bouncier than the other
tramps we used to have a rectangle
trampoline by the pool but it broke so
we had to take that apart and then yeah
all that so anyway we're going to try to
lift it out of the ground bring it over
to the pool and do some flips for you
guys have some fun it's me Quentin and
clay we don't really have anything else
to do because my video idea got ruined
and it really sucks so we can probably
do it by ourselves
cuz I do bitch Oh so here's what it
looks like under here for all you
curious fellows don't know why I'm gonna
be able to lift my half I'll try it
hey handsome ready oh ah one two three
oh my god I'm getting my part yeah I'm
not getting mine okay we're gonna have
to figure this out real quick let's get
play out here show us a flip on this Wow
oh I'm about to fall off of this bitch
ah that's not a real sound yo
all right sides out Oh mine too buster
mines are burning my hands perfect
timing
here's a look inside of the trampoline
okay we're going to open up the pool and
we're going to set it right there
hopefully everything goes to plan we
could perhaps jump off the roof onto it
and then flip into the pool we'll see
we're gonna have to clear this obstacle
right here Oh God jump into the pool
from here well okay I got my refreshment
and ready to move it okay I can go to
touch in about three seconds
bye someone jump right in the middle
best pool set up ever
okay so we've got a big ole empty hole
and then we've got a big ol trampoline
next to the pool check it out
sweet okay let's put some bricks under
that side so it doesn't flop and then
we'll get to doing some trick aru's
maybe we can jump off the roof the
spring pad from the small $140.00
trampoline that we used in insane
trampoline flips off bridge is going to
be coming in use here okay I really want
to get up on the roof we might have to
try to jump to the roof from the tram
that's the only way I can think of
getting up there oh a lizard
throw something cute for us
try through a triple front first-rate
yeah alright alright go Buster

we took it out a hole instead of either
pool okay we're gonna move the
trampoline back to the window I'm gonna

thumbnail holy frickin crap
