thank you today I'm going to be showing
you guys how to do back those on
all right so how I learned was to go
sideways first you comfortable use like
pillows like this I learned on Avengers
so your your sideways kick your feet we
go over not like sideways you're not
going to go but you go
protect your head you go to keep going
sideways closer to straight so right
about here trust me what you do it once
you're going to do a cannon in without
any problems so here it is again now and
you're ready to try straight back
it's really easy once you get the hang
of it so thank you guys for watching
