let me tell you something you already
know the world ain't all sunshine and
rainbows it's a very mean and nasty
place and I don't care how tough you are
it will beat you to your knees and keep
you there permanently if you let it you
me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as
life but it ain't about how hard you hit
it's about how hard you can get hit and
keep moving forward how much you can
take and keep moving forward that's how
winning is done
and something else will take its place
if I quit however it will last forever
you
