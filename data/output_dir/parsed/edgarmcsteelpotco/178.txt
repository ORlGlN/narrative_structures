this vlog is a documentary on Dylan's
first time and an airplane you've never
been on an airplane before if you
changed us and we crash I'm going to be
very bad it didn't get the full
experience of having to wake up and like
- yeah we usually leave it like you know
we're not getting it
yeah this is the first time we're ever
getting a direct flight from Wichita
straight to LA because usually we have
to stop and you know Chicago or Colorado
or Texas or something but this time we
got in this program that just goes boop
boop
instead of boom boom boom okay and
change my way to on there we're about to
leave the bathroom
time to go there for security still got
bees on now there are few things in life
that require the precision of writing on
healy through Wichita Kansas while
dragging a rolling suitcase okay this is
a big plane that are on Wi-Fi I found
the air conditioning though I do it how
are you feeling right now
yelling a little help right up there
seriously looking to be announcing today
this sounds like the freakin Joshua vo-
left behind where he just got in trouble
he didn't have his bag under the chair
that could have made us crash support is
commemorated in aircraft our aircraft is
because of eight clearly marked as this
because we too don't really go to the
facility and as you are looking
we're moving slowly it's about to take
off for you ready I've been naughty now
you have
together God we own hands
and liftoff
like the weird noises the pollination
but it can't wait for turbulence you
know what that is
the plane shaking scared relax and
imagine us dying
close your nose the gallery like turtle
of your years
month off
looks like you're about to
landing right now weird he touched the
ground fell out of my bed
this is the most fun part of the plane
process standing or what seems like
forever because it is we're doing we're
making time for a Healy's at it
here's the black suitcase yep
I like the gray one a little grayer
black which row we get any of this row

crazy coincidence

okay our cilantro driveway at 3:30 2
a.m. Friday night right at 4:10 a.m.
there was an accident
out in one of your uncle Damian's corn
fields it was this truck went airborne
and flew into a pond look through there
cornfield literally is a 2013 Ford f150
crew cab burgundy Wow interesting
like that's double your cheque like no
they found mine and that's not it but
how is that okay go go go there's a TV
and has an HDMI cable we could be
playing on play games you could play
xbox on that thing hope you know we're
one mile from a subway the go-to
restaurant every time we're going to
California we're also staying at the
same hotel as last time the one with the
robot they came and delivered us food I
made a video about that right there is
our over room here we see it but yeah

looks just like crap yeah no this isn't
sparkling though it's just still yep so
still Wow okay here we go you ready
someone who's awake are you about to get
a bed no I just took my second shower of
the day because it was really hot on
that airplane and I was sweating up a
storm I even bought some deodorant it's
like random little shop at the car
rental place but this boy was none the
one on the way back from what was this
Chicago I don't know wrong so hot I was
like we were next to this old lady on
the flight and she kept glaring at me so
I was kind of quiet just like I have to
be now because everyone else is asleep

been to LA or really like anywhere that
