see mommy right here baby
man I was just sitting here thinking I
really just look at him
I really just think the Lord for my baby
boy like ah I like I'm so grateful that
he is a healthy baby and that he just
like I love seeing him laugh and smile
and as long as as long as he okay I will
always be okay
I just love him so so so much y'all and
the reason why I really really thank God
you know that he's a healthy baby it's
because I used to when I was pregnant
with him I used to have nightmares you
know I never told y'all this vise I have
nightmares when I was further along in
my pregnancy that I would be in like the
tub holding him and he would like
disappear out of my hand and I'm I have
dreams that like here he would die and I
would just have all these nightmares
about him all the time and I didn't
understand why you know but I used to be
really really scared you know that's
something what happens to one but I just
started praying and you know I just had
to trust God and believe that everything
was gonna be okay because I just I just
wasn't I mean I don't think nobody's
ever ready to be a parent
but I know I definitely wasn't ready I
was 18 years old
freshly out of high school freshly
graduated out of high school found out I
was pregnant and Laura like lord knows
what I was thinking I did not know like
how to be a mom and I'm still learning
so you know it's just like it's it's a
lot of things that come with being a
parent but it's a blessing so shout out
to all the parents out there shout out
to all the moms whether you single
whether you married because having a
baby is a blessed thing like
just everything about that little boy
just make me just everything about the
little boy just make me smile the way he
walked the way he cried just like
everything the way he talked I just love
him so so much
CJ mommy love you well anyway yeah it's
looking like it's looking like he don't
want to stay for a minute and play so
I'm just continue to let him play and be
a kid and you know until you get tired
so you go to sleep tonight
on time because he'd be up with me but
i'ma let him wear himself out and keep
an eye on him and I'ma just go ahead and
end this vlog but I appreciate all y'all
for watching I know last time when I
when I spent time with CJ and I said I
didn't do nothing too special
I think comments saying all this was
special you know because you spend time
with your baby so I appreciate all you
guys that said that and everybody who's
watching and I love y'all so so much for
being true supporters and I will see
