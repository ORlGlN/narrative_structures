- Hi everyone.
I'm Jenn Im and today I'll
be meeting some athletes
who are going to be
representing the United States
in the Winter Olympic and Paralympic games
in South Korea, Pyeongchang in 2018.
Korean culture is known for their beauty
and cosmetic lines so we're gonna put each
Olympic hopeful to participate
in one of three games.
And this episode is Place the Face.
We're gonna throw each athlete
into the K-Beauty gauntlet,
and see who comes out on top.
So lets go ahead and meet our athletes.
Hey guys, so here we have Evan.
Thank you so much for joining us today.
- Good to be here.
Thank you for having me.
(laughs)
- So today we're gonna
really focus on K-Beauty
and it's gonna be pretty challenging.
This is one of my favorite
challenges actually.
So we're gonna do a game called
The Facts and the Furious.
So three simple questions you will answer.
- Musubi.
- Musubi?
Like spam musubi?
- Maybe katsu musubi.
- Well I love spam.
- Mexican food.
- Mexican food?
You like spicy food then?
- Yeah spicy where it still has flavor.
- Oh so it's not to the point
where it's like hurting you.
- Yean, exactly.
(both laugh)
- For sure.
What's one song or artist
that's been on repeat lately?
- Definitely that
Kendrick Lamar, "Humble."
- I love Kendrick.
- That thing gets me jumpin'.
- "Stay" by Zedd.
- He's amazing live.
- It's a real ear worm though.
Just gets in there.
- My definite go to song is
DMX, "X Gon Give it to Ya."
- Oh hell yeah!
- It's a great pump up.
- Oh my god.
- You start dancing, you bark a little,
weird people out, but
it's pretty much my go to.
- No seriously, every
time that song comes on
in a bar or a club everyone's just
"Alright, we're doing this!"
- Exactly.
- That's a great song choice.
We're gonna play the game!
It's called Place the Face.
- Ready?
- Oh!
(grunts)
Not ready for that.
On the table, I've got three go to
Korean products that I love.
First we've got the BB Cushion.
And if you don't know what that is,
this is what girls put on
their face as the base.
- I think they joke and
call it Bondo, right?
The guys call it Bondo like on the car.
You know, when you got a little bowl
and you kinda patch it up.
- Oh my god!
(both laugh)
Yes, this is our Bondo for our face.
Second, we've got some eye shadow sticks,
and the last one is a lipstick.
Add some color to your lips.
Pucker up.
And the best part is you're
not going to do it on my face,
but you're gonna do it on
this lovely woman here.
Obviously doing this blindfolded as well,
so you've got something
to, I know, ya know?
Okay let's put you into
position, over here.
Okay, and go!
Oh.
Okay.
- This is gonna be.
- Hey, you're off to a pretty good start.
- I don't know what a cat eye is.
- Just flick it at the end.
Flick it.
Now for the lips.
Alright.
And you're off.
Yeah, okay, okay.
Fantastic.
- I'm not very good at this.
(both laugh)
- Wow, it's really low, isn't it?
- Yeah, those are some big lips.
Okay.
Not bad.
Oh, god.
- Oh, no.
That's way off.
- Oh my gosh.
That's pretty darn close, actually.
- Can I have a little more?
- Yeah.
- Am I on the eye?
- You're close enough to be honest, yeah.
Or you're more down south.
Oh, yeah that's one way to do it.
- You said go for it.
- Yeah.
- I'm assuming her lips are right there.
- High cheek bones, I gotcha.
- Yeah.
And come right back across the face right?
On that high cheek bone again.
Gotta get that Bondo in,
and you have to sand it down
'cause if you don't get it sanded down
you'll see it when you
paint the car, you know?
I'm gonna say it's
about right there, yeah?
Look at that eye, right?
- Make sure you flick it at
the end for the little cat eye.
- You gotta give her that cat.
- Yeah, there you go, there you go.
(laughs)
- My masterpiece is complete.
- I think we have the new
Picasso here, alright.
Ready to see it?
(both laugh)
- Wow!
- This one was really good.
- I actually go them.
- This one was really good.
- Oh wow, not bad right?
- Yeah.
- This one I was very impressed.
Oh my god!
She's fiery.
- I don't know she would be a mean wahena.
(both laugh)
Tried to give her some horns.
- Do I look?
- Yeah.
- Oh not too bad.
- Yeah, right?
- You pretty much.
- Got it in her eye.
Some people like the nude
look on their lips so.
- Exactly.
- Oh my gosh.
- Like, come on.
- Not even close to the lip.
- It's okay, I mean we
all have our strengths.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Makeup is not mine.
(laughs)
- Well that concludes
K-Beauty with NBC Olympics.
I feel like the athletes are ready
to dominate their sports
and maintain a great complexion.
Thank you so much for watch America,
and I'll be seeing you in Pyeongchang.
