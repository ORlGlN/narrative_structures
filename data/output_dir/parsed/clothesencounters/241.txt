well dude if your date starts in the
morning or afternoon
you have to bust out that floral frock
out of your closet I always feel like an
ethereal fairy when I wear this and I
made sure to add some tougher items like
the wide rim hat to break up all the
sweetness for a casual and girly look
try pattern mixing I've went for a
microdot and floral mixed and harmonized
everything by throwing on a black
cardigan a solid color always balances
any whimsical outfit valentine's Day is
supposed to be sweet so don't be afraid
to be as cute as a cupcake this
two-piece outfit is ultra cutesy but the
subtle stripes Browns the look I think
it makes it a lot more different than
wearing all white and looking like a
bride
