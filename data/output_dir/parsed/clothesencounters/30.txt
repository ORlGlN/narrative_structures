- 'Tis the season for Halloween.
I've partnered with Simple
Skincare to show you
these two killer looks to rock this year.
First, I'm gonna show you how I did this
dead bride look and
then into a disco alien.
I'll be using Simple's products from their
water boost line, in between the looks
so that way I can keep my skin hydrated
during this spooky time.
All right, so let's get
started with the first look.
So here I am with fresh clean skin and I'm
gonna use Simple's hydrating
booster to prep my skin.
Since I'm gonna be putting
a lot of stuff on my face,
I wanna make sure that it's hydrated.
I love this booster because
it also acts as a primer,
so it's gonna make sure that
everything stays on tact.
Now that my skin is ready and good to go,
it's time for concealer.
I'm using Colourpop's No Filter Concealer
in the shade light and I'm
gonna start applying it
all over my face as the first base.
Then with a damp makeup sponge I'm just
gonna blend that baby out.
I wanted my face to be a little lighter
so I'm gonna go in with foundation now,
just doing the usual, dot it on my face
and then blending it out.
The next step is powder.
I'm using my trusty Laura
Mercier translucent one
and I'm just gonna set that
in so that nothing budges.
For my brows, I'm using
Benefit's Goof Proof Brow Pencil
and I'm just gonna do
my usual brow routine.
At first I was tempted
to use a black eyeliner,
but I thought I'd go for
something more wearable.
Okay, brows done.
All right, so let's move onto eye shadow.
I'm using NYX's Jumbo Eye Pencil and I'm
gonna use this as a
base for our ultra smoky
dead bride look.
Feel free to be lax with application
because after you do this, you're gonna
get a dense brush and start
to smoke the edges out.
Then I'm gonna go in
with the same eye pencil
again and start covering the lower lid.
Go in with that same brush and start to
smoke it out the best you can.
Don't trip if it doesn't look too perfect,
because in the end, you're a dead bride,
so it's all right if it
looks a little messy.
Now I'm using Kat Von
D's Monarch Pallette.
I'm grabbing the matte black eye shadow
and I'm just gonna start
packing it all over my lid.
I'm doing like a little patting motion
instead of a sweeping one because
I wanna minimize the fall out.
Then I'm gonna use a dense, fluffy brush
and start smoking this all out.
Next up, I'm taking
this burnt sienna shade
and using this as a transition shade.
I did kind of like a
slight winged out shape
just so it looks a little glam.
Then I'm gonna go back
into the same sienna color
and I'm gonna drag that out
for the bottom of my eyes.
Grab a black eyeliner
now and start tightlining
the bottom half of the
eye, this is just gonna
smoke the look out even more
and intensify everything.
Then I'm gonna grab a
cheek brush and I'm just
gonna dip it inside that
sienna color and start
using that as a contour shade.
I kinda went a little harsh with this,
so I'm using a makeup sponge to blend
the imperfections that I made.
There, much better.
I'm gonna quickly pop on some falsies now
for some instant vavoom.
Now using a black pencil liner I'm gonna
start drawing the skeleton nose onto mine.
I went for, like a rounder shape,
because I wanted my nose
to look more button-like.
Then go in with a
concealer and start whiting
out your lips, you want a super pale base
because we're about to
draw some skeleton teeth.
First using a black liner I'm gonna start
drawing the inside of
my lips to make me look
more dead, then I'm gonna
lightly drag the pencil
out to the corners of my lips to give them
the illusion that they open wider.
I'm gonna draw the outside skull
teeth first and then
I'm gonna grab my liquid
eyeliner and I'm gonna redraw and sharpen
the lines in the corners of my mouth
and also along the lips.
Using the liquid liner is easier than
the pencil because you can
be more precise with it.
I shaded the inside of
my lip a little darker
and now I'm done.
Throw on a black wig, grab a veil,
and prepare for the ultimate
wedding of the underworld.
I love that this look is a little creepy,
but still sultry as hell.
Now, it's time to take of the wig
and all this makeup off so that we
can transition into the next look.
First, I'm gonna use
Simple's Cleansing Facial
Wipes and start removing the first layer
of makeup off.
You guys know that these wipes are my jam
and I love how soft and effective they
are for removing the first
portion of my makeup.
See, look at all that gunk.
Now I'm going in with Simple's Water Boost
Micellar Cleansing Water.
I'm soaking up a cotton round and then
gently removing the
remainder of my makeup.
This formula is awesome
because it's refreshing
and rehydrates the skin.
And there are no harsh chemicals,
which is always a plus.
Okay so now that makeup is finally off,
let's start the second look.
First, I'm just gonna prime the skin again
with Simple's Hydrating Booster.
My skin has been through a lot today
so it's important that I add this step
so it's hydrated and primed
for the second round.
So I'm basically doing
the exact same steps
as the previous look.
I put the concealer on my face,
added powder, and then drew on my brows.
Now that we're up to speed,
I'm gonna go in with
another NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil
in this lovely green shade that I honestly
thought I'd never use.
I'm gonna start coloring
it all over my lid.
Then going in with Colourpop's Cusp,
I'm gonna pack this shimmery emerald shade
all over the base.
I'm honestly just
obsessed with this color.
Now I'm gonna go in
with my Lo-key palette,
I'm gonna grab this orange shade and start
using that as my transitions shade to
blend this crazy green out.
Surprisingly the orange looks really good.
I never thought that
this would be the color
to blend out really unusual shades.
I'm picking another adventurous color,
this is wild thoughts and I'm just gonna
start going in all under
the lower part of the eye.
I just basically picked
out a bunch of intimidating
colors that I never use for this look.
Then I'm grabbing my
liquid liner and drawing
my usual cat eye.
I just realized that I
wanted a little extra oomp
so I grabbed this champagne color and
added it to the inner
corners and brow bone.
Now I'm skipping mascara and I'm popping
on these big fluffy lashes.
These add the drama that
I want for this look.
I wanted to add a
celestial element to this
so I'm using Urban Decay's Heavy Metal amp
and I'm adding this green sparkly glitter
to the top part of my lid.
I love glitter, so this
is very much needed.
Then using Stila's liquid eyeshadow,
I'm gonna take this violet glitter
and start covering the lower
half of the eye as well.
This is Halloween, folks,
so go big or go home.
Now using my favorite
highlighter, I'm just
gonna dust this onto
the apples of my cheeks,
nose bridge and Cupid's bow.
For the lips, I'm going for a darker color
so I'm lining my lips
with a black pencil liner.
Most of the time I don't
really line my lips,
but for dark colors,
it is an absolute must.
I'm finally busting out squid ink
from my collection and
I'm gonna apply it all
over the lips, this is such a cool color
because it's like a
dark, dark indigo shade.
This is definitely one of the most
challenging colors that
I've ever applied on
my lips, but, I tried my
best, please don't kill me.
Now that I'm finished, I'm gonna throw on
my rainbow wig and my
little alien antennas.
I love how whimsical this look is
because of all the variety of colors.
This is the perfect look for parties,
whether it's Halloween or not.
