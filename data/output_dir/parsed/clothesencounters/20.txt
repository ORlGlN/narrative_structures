- Hey, everyone.
It's your girl Jenn and
today I have a fresh batch of
favorites for you.
We are coming very very close
to the last month of 2017
and I'm so excited because
I love the holiday season.
It's about to get very very festive.
But, first I just want to
talk about all the best things
of November so let's get started.
My first favorite is a beauty product.
This is Atomy's Rose Rain Mist.
And this has been great to use as a toner.
I actually got this from
a subscriber in New York,
her name is Michelle and
on the note she wrote that
this is one of her holy
grails and it's quickly
becoming one of mine as well.
And I just love the way
the mist is distributed.
It's like a really fine
cooling mist and it just
does a really great job
toning and hydrating.
Sometimes I'll use this just
as a setting spray as well.
When I just want my
face to look more dewy.
You can also spray this
on your body as well.
Naturally my skin is a little
bit on the drier side so
this just comes in handy
when I want a refresher.
Next up I've got another beauty product.
I want to talk about falsies.
I have been a falsies
girl since I was 15 or 16
so there's been a lot of like
fake lashes on these eyelids.
And right now I'm kind of
in more of a natural subtle
makeup look right now.
So that's why I've been
loving these falsies by Kiss.
The two styles that I
love are Lily and Jasmine
and I have stocked up
on both these styles.
These are really great if
you want more of a fresh
and innocent look.
The band is super thin so
you don't need eyeliner to
cover the band or anything.
It kind of reminds me of
the Ardell demi wispies
but these are more perky.
Sometimes with the demi wispies
my eyes can look a little sleepy.
Not with these guys.
I'm wearing them on my eyes
right now and I just feel
just like very fresh.
These have been great
to use when I want more
of like a natural look like this.
But it's still glam.
For my book favorite I have
The War of Art by Steven Pressfield.
This was one of the presents
that my brother got me
for my birthday.
He said that this book
really helped him when he was
going through a creative
rut and I'm actually trying
to start this new creative
project and that's why
I smashed this book out.
This is a very easy read.
I finished this in a couple nights
but I do feel re inspired.
This book is really awesome
when you're going through
a creative block because
it just highlights the fact
that the only thing that is
stopping you from doing a
creative project is you.
And he calls that resistance.
And resistance is that
voice that tells you
to start tomorrow.
It tells you that you're not good enough,
or your idea's stupid.
It just basically explains
that the most difficult thing
about starting a project is beginning it.
And it is so true.
I want to say that this book
wasn't like mind blowingly
good but there are definitely
parts of this book that
have me feeling inspired and
ready to start my next project.
If you're looking for a quick
read that's gonna give you
a kick in the butt, go check this out.
My next favorite is a fitness one.
I recently purchased these
ankle weights on Amazon
and they've been incredible
for just helping me step up
my fitness game.
Sometimes I just don't want
to go to the gym because
it's just kind of a hassle and
I just want to work from home
but I realized that I needed
to get just better equipment.
Right now I just have these
little dumbbells but they're
just not good enough.
I wanted to get something
where I can challenge my legs
and my butt so I got these
eight pound ankle weights.
I just Velcro them on to my
ankles and they have been
amazing for toning the legs
and I was using these elastic
bands before but these
are way more challenging.
I love that you can also put
them on your wrists as well
if you want to do some arm workouts.
You can do arm circles.
You can like punch the air like this.
I'm like already working
up a sweat right now but
these are incredible if you want to start
working out from home.
You can also just like leave
these on your ankles and
just walk around the house
if you want just kind of like
a no brainer workout.
I am always looking for things
that challenge my body more
and to stay fit.
My last favorite is this green tea matcha.
I recently got this as a
gift from my friend Regina.
Thank you so much.
This has been life changing.
It's been such a great way to
get caffeine in your system.
Before with coffee,
I didn't realize how wired I get
and how bad the crash is from caffeine.
Like personally I do like the
feeling of feeling hyper awake
and a little bit wired.
I don't know I just kind
of like being on edge.
But basically what
killed me was the crash.
Because after like an hour
of feeling like, I'm awake,
I would crash and I would
feel really really tired.
Um, not with this matcha.
It's definitely more of a gradual energy.
Kind of like slow release.
So it just comes up and
it gently comes down.
It's just very nice.
I feel like this is just
better for your body.
It's also very relaxing to make.
You get your little sifter,
you sift out all the
little clumps and then you add hot water.
Personally, I like to add
ice because I just like
iced drinks so I make like
a really delicious matcha
iced drink and it is just
so tasty and gives me
the energy that I need.
I know matcha is having a huge
moment in New York and LA so
I'm so happy that it's in the
comfort of my own home now.
Alright guys, that is
a wrap on my favorites.
If you'd like to share anything
that you were inspired by
or loved please write it
in the comments down below.
I'm trying to think if I
have any updates for you.
The wedding planning is going.
I'm not gonna lie it's
been pretty stressful.
It's just a lot of like
small like details but we are
having our cake test tasting
this week which I'm really excited about.
There's still no like wedding
dress that I really like yet.
It's kind of weird because
last time I went wedding dress
shopping it just felt like
very bizarre like a lot of the
dresses it felt like someone
just copied and pasted my face
on these dresses and I just
feel like that's a sign that
I haven't found the dress that I love yet.
But yes, the search continues.
Then my brother and I are also going to
New Orleans next week.
I am so excited.
If you guys have any
recommendations on what to do there
please write it in the
comments down below.
From food to drink to just entertainment.
I would love to know
like a local's thoughts.
But yeah, I want to thank
you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye, muah.
