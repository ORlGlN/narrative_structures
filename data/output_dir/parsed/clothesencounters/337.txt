I thought I'd break my black-and-white
spell with this delicious-looking
rainbow cardigan I love how it gradually
fades into grant the top which is why I
wore a gray circle scarf okay they say
your girl likes to coordinate underneath
I kept it all black with this fuzzy
colored gloves and some wax denim face
it everything is better with the Cape
because everything you do instantly
becomes more dramatic like Madeline of
Jean Grae set it with a cape you don't
walk in an outfit you swish
I thought I added this warmer option for
those who live in colder climates
because in every winter or fall video I
do there's always someone saying that
they live in a place that's really cold
to be honest I wouldn't last a day in
cold weather because I I don't know I
guess I'm just spoiled by the weather in
California so major props to you or for
those living in a super cold environment
my trip to Korea was so inspiring and
here I'm wearing two of my favorite
pieces I got in Korea this Burgundy coat
and this black leather cap
I've got a thing for prints
the walk you in the butter like this
Looney tune bomber jacket
it's so totally 90s and I think it's a
really good winter coat because of the
quilted lining and the synthetic down in
the bomber underneath I'm going tally
winter style with my sheer button-down
and some angled skorts
all right so those are all the looks
please comment down below and tell me
what you look was your favorite if
you're addicted to your phone and need
some time to kill you can follow me on
instagram and twitter at i'm jim and
