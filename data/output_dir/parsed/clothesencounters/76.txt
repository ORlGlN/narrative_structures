- Hello there.
Welcome to our hotel room!
-  Woo!
First of all, Ben,
and Jenn robes,
and they're lovely and thin.
- I know!
- This is like the dream.
I've always wanted a nice
robe with my name on it.
A nice shower there.
Oh, yeah.
- Sit and think.
You know, about life as the
water's coming down on you.
(Ben laughing)
(electronic music)
What's up, guys?
Today is the first day of Coachella.
(cheers)
Oh, I'm so excited.
As you can see I'm just doing my hair.
I'm just gonna do what I always do,
which is a smooth wave.
For those who are
wondering, I use this by T3.
I don't know the name of
this, but it looks like this.
It's got rose gold hardware
and I really like the big barrel.
That's what gives your
curls that fluffy look.
This morning, went to a little bruch
for House of Harlow, which
is Nicole Richie's brand.
Had some food and then I uploaded
my spring make up tutorial.
If you haven't seen it, I'll
leave a card right over there.
It's inspired by the Pirates
of the Caribbean movie
and I used the Le Roc's
new palette for that, so.
I really had a fun time
creating that look.
The agenda's quite packed already.
We've got pool party from one to five.
John Boy's doing tattoos.
A$AP Ferg is playing at three,
and then by five we're hoping that we can,
we're just gonna be at the festival
and we can meet up with
everybody, so excited.
(electronic music)
Men shaving men.
(hip hop music)
Here we are about to
have a nice little lunch.
How's your tattoo?
- Yeah, I said all right.
-  You gonna show?
- It's a nice little chile pepper.
- Oh.
- You know?
-  It's so cute.
I was so tempted to get one myself,
but oh my gosh, my mother texted me.
She says (speaks foreign language)
"No more tattoo."
And I said, "Only Ben is getting a tattoo.
"I am not getting a tattoo."

Way to the festival now on the shuttle.
Excited, we're gonna
meet up with everybody.
- Yes.
- Yes.
-  I love Rocky.
(electronic music)
- Good morning, guys.
It is day two of Coachella.
Yesterday, Friday was definitely needed.
If I had one word describe
last night was overstimulating.
I truly forget how crowded
and intense the festival is.
You've got all these lights,
all these acts, all
your friends are there.
Wrangling people.
I think Friday was to just break us in.
We saw Steve Angello last
night, Dillon Francis,
Travis Scott and DJ Shadow.
DJ Shadow was sick, though.
I didn't know he was a fellow Aggie.
He went to UC Davis, too.
It's so sick, Stephanie told me.
Right now I'm putting on some
of this body glow by Kopari.
This is just a body shimmer.
It gives your skin some nice gold flecks
and it looks really great in the sun.
I'm obsessed with it and
it smells like coconut.
All right, now we are
heading to the guy's house.
We're gonna just settle in there.
- Barbecue.
- Doing a barbecue, perhaps.
- Catch up.
- Head out the festival.
- It'd be nice to have a relaxing time
and actually talk without having to shout
while we squeeze--
- Yeah, all right.
- Through people.
- I know, I know.
The group we are going with
go together to the festival.
It's too hectic to meet with
your friends at the festival.
- The rose garden.
- The rose garden,
the Sahara tent.
We're at the house, we are prepared.
We've eaten, go rally up the troops.
This is the house that they're staying at.
It is in Palm Desert.
The lovely Hannah.
Oh, my God, dang, Sophie.
Hannah, Sophie, you guys look so good.
- Thanks, Jenn.
- Coachella ready.
- Ready.
(electronic music)
- So we just made it to the festival.
Oh my God.
- We have made it.
It was so easy to get in today.
- I know.
- And it's still light.
Look at this, lovely.
- It's daylight.
