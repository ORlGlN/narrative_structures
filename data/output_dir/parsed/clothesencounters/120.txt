We should get Cheeki another toy
She's been chewing them all up,
haven't you?
Yeah, we could go now.
I'll just drop off the groceries and then
we'll pop on over?
Yeah! Alright, I'm down.
Oh babe? 
Can you grab my sunglasses please?
They should be on the side.
I actually think they're in my bag.
Let me check.
Well this is unfortunate
But since we're here this is the perfect time
as any to show you what's in my bag.
So let's take a look, shall we?
Well guys, that concludes the
What's In My Bag section
But let's just keep this stumble between us.
Babe, you okay?
Oh yeah! I'm okay!
I just yelled cos I found this 
underneath the couch.
You are so cute.
I'm always looking out for you two.
