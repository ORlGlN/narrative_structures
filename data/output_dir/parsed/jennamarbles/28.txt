hey guys I'm in my dream corner it's so
dreamy in here I've seen the title of
this video and I know you're probably
think you do yourself like that's on
video I've seen your dogs you can't put
her before what is this and the truth is
is that I debated not posting a video at
all today I'm just not feeling very
great and it's nothing serious is
happening you don't need to be worried
because such as we all joke I know you
guys do genuinely care about me and my
well-being everything's fine I'm just
feeling not quite like myself today and
the theme of 2017 on my channel has
really just been I post whatever I want
I make whatever I want do whatever I
want and try to make me laugh and be
happy I thought to myself you know what
would make me happy today and the answer
is always the same thing it's hang out
with my dogs color with my dogs and feed
them peanut butter so that's the reason
I'm posting this video that's something
that makes me feel good and happy and I
love watching trucks for any animal
really eat peanut butter that can
because it's amazing and the best I do
apologize I'm not trying to disappoint
anyone without having a video this week
I'm genuinely sorry but this is what I'm
going to make this week and hope you're
doing well and I hope you like watching
dog sleepy number two because it's
pretty great
