all right I'm gonna make a video so you
can see how ridiculous my office is
because I almost died the other day when
the light fixture fell down on top of me
and was killed me and that's where all
these like little bugs live in the
office they go in there and they die in
the Hangout but now they can just come
down on top of me so my office is full
of bugs it's gross
all right that's my light now and that's
what fell on top of me and broke and
almost killed me
and all these little bugs are all up in
the light go and now the bugs just come
out of the ceiling yeah just all over me
that's so gross it's not cool not cool
no look No
