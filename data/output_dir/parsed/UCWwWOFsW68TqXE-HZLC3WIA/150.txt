hey guys what's going on everybody
oh my gosh by the way I guess I was like
gonna tell you is in social and we have
an ace family member here that works
here so shelter her you want to say hi
to the Hayes family her name's Katherine
as well so that's pretty interesting
guys this looks absolutely
guys if you don't know about this apple
juice I suggest you try it awesome and I
are so obsessed with it
are you plugging them right now drink
like 100 a week and we put everybody on
this like we refer the table juice every
see that guys we're here at crane on
Ventura Boulevard kind of just wasting
time until there's the car I want so
we're kind of just buying time until my
tattoo appointment I'm actually pretty
nervous it's been a while since I got a
tattoo and I know how bad they are
blossom you got one
was there long though
my last tattoo was Elle's name that was
my last tattoo so today I'm getting a
couple pieces gun to add on to my sleeve
I don't want to give it away just yet I
want you guys to see it without me
saying it so I have an idea why don't
you tell them what all your talk to me
yeah a lot of you guys have been asking
me to do a video dedicated to my tattoos
and I haven't done that yet for you guys
so they should be a good day before I
actually go get some tattoos done
that looks amazing that's yours
it's right here for you my smoothie
thank you so much professor
doesn't mom
take a picture and this mood is good as
well all right guys we're gonna need a
little bit before I discuss my tattoos
be back in a few frames family so why
Katherine finishes eating her crepe
the very first tattoo I got is the one
on my chest I know I'm crazy for getting
the biggest tattoo I have my very first
tattoo the one on my chest I got for my
mom and she had no idea I got it as you
can see I know a lot of you guys have
seen it I'm not gonna see her get naked
out in public it says many women do
noble things but you surpassed them all
so a mom the story is actually
interesting because like I said my mom
had no idea it actually caught me with
it at my basketball game I was playing
and she happened to see it when we got
home she asked me what do you have on
your chest and I was trying to hide it I
was not trying to show her actually did
a great job of hiding it from her
because she didn't find out - a month
later mom you still mad at me can blame
my dad because he's only told me I can
get it of course I had to show her and
she broke down and start crying cause my
very first tattoo I could never thank my
mom enough for all that she does shout
you mama I love you now I'm kind of
confused cuz I don't remember what my
second tattoo was fuckin let's just go
through all so the one up here hopefully
you guys know this one it's Jesus
I'm a big believer in the man above and
I have a lot of faith underneath we have
here some roses okay in the back we have
some prayer hands you got to have faith
you got to believe you got to pray go
off of the prayer hands we have a
necklace with the Cross on my forearm we
have here a lion no I am NOT allele but
it is my favorite animal and it
represents strength on my wrist we have
here a bracelet I love bracelets also
with a cross on it on the inside of my
arm of course I had to get one for my
pawn shop
it says my father built my well being my
father has an important role in my life
and he's my best friend shout to pops on
the inside of my forearm we have here
gates to heaven with some doves on the
inside of my wrist we have here blessed
because I'm very blessed I also have a
rip piece right here says my family is
my greatest blessing which it is I also
have a leg piece that says as long as
you have faith in God anything is
possible through 1/2 faith in God
anything is possible obviously the very
last tattoo that I got is of course a
lively McBroom my princess my daughter
my world my
not my everything cuz you're a part of
my everything and I think that's it
everyone always asked my gonna get a
second sleeve but I don't know if that's
me I think it's too much
so today's family
what would I get it
hey I mean if you think I should get
Catherine's name sat on me coming below
but today I will be getting
lively ELLs middle names
but here we do the poor guys ain't home
actually not that bad
right now a little too
check it out you guys they don't know
what that stands for some of you mad by
the way my man Robert Becker used up all
my tattoos he's done all my tattoos
I did it I did it hate family I got the
ACE logo finally tatted on me
it's our family tattoos it's been my bad
bet it's for Elle and it's for me so
baby when you ask me if I get your name
tatted this is better than getting your
name tag actually it's not not okay
we're not Frank's family along at the a
slow going
what's our brand so of course I had to
get it home I think my sleeve is pretty
much covered up now so for our next
child holder is a boy if not
my next child his name I'm not sure
where his name is gonna go but it's
gonna go somewhere so stay tuned for
more tattoos oh and I may I think about

guys I just want to say something I've
been noticing a lot of you guys have
been coming up to us you know like
saying hi and introducing yourselves and
whatnot and I just want to say that I
feels I know Austin feels the same way
we feel so inspired by you guys just
coming up to us and just saying that you
guys watch our Channel
and then you guys love us because this
is the reason why we do what we do you
guys inspire us and we hope that we
inspire you guys and obviously you know
we get a lot of tweets and a lot of dm's
and whatnot but we can't get back to
every single person and it hurts me that
I can't get back to every single person
because I really do love every single
one of you and we've noticed a lot of
people saying that they've seen us out
and they don't come up to us for
whatever reason but we just want to let
you know that we're all family don't be
shy guys don't be shy and that we
appreciate every single one of you like
we literally love when you guys come up
to us and when you guys hug us and when
you guys tell us that it feels so good
that you love us because we feel the
same exact way and it's just such a good
feeling to just see you guys in person
and see your faces and it makes me so
happy and to be honest with you before
me specifically before I started
vlogging I was more reserved than I am
and I think it's really helped me just
being more like personable and just
being more in the moment and so when you
guys come up to me and you guys say hi
I'm just like I just feels such a good
energy and I'm just so happy and that's
why I continue to do what I do so I just
want to let you guys know we missed you
