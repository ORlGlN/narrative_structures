what's going on viii family can you
guess where I am right now
can you guess we are at the post office
because we're about to get a peel box
know a lot of you guys have been asking
if you have a feel box well now we have
one in our information of the peel box
will be in all our descriptions
hey guys so today we will be Christmas
shopping for our family probably got a
few rings oh well we can't we got some
rings we can't okay by the way guys are
matching today
oh yeah we're matching matching onesies
and Austin has a black one and al is
just looking grumpy
to throw a penny for good luck let's do
it
you know I'm always down for good luck
you toss one I toss one
there we go here goes mine here we go
good turn
and even got places for you to take a
nap
hey princess you like this sweater you
like this you want this one or you want
the pink one what smells good you see
the salami
dang it's like the ocean
that's cute I was kinda like a leaf like
I fell upon the tree he'll put his girl
on FaceTime he knows that she watched
our YouTube channel and she thought
she's all faced on right now she just
joined a family today have a go on
mainly made with love babe look at this
Kruk cross the dough hi baby
you ready look at some rings we're about
that around this corner how do you know
this a jewelry store because I've I've
been looking even look I know a lot of
you guys have been wondering when are we
gonna get married or why haven't we got
married well here it is the reason why
we haven't gotten married is because I
want to do it the right way I don't want
to be those guys who get a ring and it's
not the best ring you know me I want to
say here here's this ring and later on
I'm gonna get you a nicer ring I don't
want to be those guy hours have respect
for those guys but I just don't want to
be one of those guys so I want to make
sure I do it the right way and make sure
she gets the best because this woman
right here deserves the best and she's
gonna get the best so we're gonna go
ahead and wait until we can do it the
right way
if that makes sense
and by doing it the right way also means
I would like L to be in it as well so I
want her to be old enough to be able to
walk down the aisle with some flowers
and stuff like that
right you got to be in our wedding right
so I feel like that's the only way for
it to be the best way and just know the
whole proposal thing is coming real soon
she won't know when it's coming and you
guys won't know when it's coming there's
gonna be a big surprise and I will be
honest we're gonna have some more
supporters at our wedding what yeah
let's do it
we don't pick like four or five of our
supporters to come to our wedding it's
gonna be crazy
just know it's gonna be the best one you
guys ever seen you don't mean I like to
go big it's all the way to go and
another reason why we're looking at
rains because I have to know what style
she lacks I just can't get a random ring
because what if she don't like it all
right I don't see what you would like oh
you want to see what I would like to get
well I guess I like to go big go big or
go home
I'll ring Go Go me great let me take a
look at that one on the very right what
about that one
this is two months two months to 18
months
that is too much you deserve too much
what do you mean I don't want to hear
that brings back all you see I look
around here like round you too right cuz
you got for me but some people haven't I
do like that one
I like that's beautiful alright guys so
now I know what style ring my queen
likes she likes around diamonds she
doesn't like to be too fancy she likes
simple simplicity is is key but even
though I believe she she needs a little
flavor to it below some little fancy
stuff like I said she deserves a dress
so I believe I think I know how I think
I know he deserve more than someone so
hey what's that raises are maybe I never
know you never know so while we're
supposed to be Christmas shopping for
our family we're out here looking at
wedding rings that's all bad that's okay
cuz that time is coming now
yeah we're just doing it all today now
we're walking to let's a panga mall
we just left the village they really
have too much but we know the mall has a
lot - you were here at least once a week
oh god damn look at that
parcel look at that purse y'all don't
understand right now
the mall is right now
it is so packed
yeah
Oh
we get ice cream I told y'all last time
we were here that was going to
eventually get an ice cream every time I
come to the mall it always looks
delicious
like I'll try to figure out where we
should sit
literally there's nowhere to sit here
by the way this is what I got
this is what Katherine got she'll beer
destroy an ice cream god damn
all right guys so I'm not sure we're
having bad luck or maybe there's just
nothing else to buy I feel like our
family has everything that they want and
it's really hard to like it's so hard to
shop for them so we're just gonna have
to go to another mall and just get like
yeah so right now we're walking back to
the car and then we're about to head to
the Grove and probably Melrose hopefully
they have some because like I said we're
struggling right now
we're struggling we don't know what to
get
it's okay though part of the process la
is great but the traffic is not needed
as you can see we're at Melrose it's
popping I guess Saturday is the worst
day to shop something's dropping in here
