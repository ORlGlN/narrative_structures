what's going on AIDS family so today we
are shooting a video that we think was
done to us
a couple weeks back and as you can see
we are in our apartment parking lot and
it happened at the same location okay
and as you can see right here there's a
little ledge so we pulled up from a long
day there was twenty dollars just
sitting right there on that ledge and
Katherine and I were weirded out because
we're like why is twenty dollars just
sitting there waiting for us we were
like where are they camera right so we
start looking like are we getting prank
like what's going on so we just left it
there we didn't even play with that cuz
we're like that's bad karma right there
right so we just left it alone and all
sudden some lady walks by and she's like
snatches it and I need that yeah I'm
looking like that is not sure that's
what I said I was like that is not sure
she looking Michiko so I needed we were
like dang that's crazy we were like
looking around like you just got caught
on camera right so once we saw that we
were like yo we should make a video like
I made a snapchat about two so you might
have seen it yeah we made a snapchat so
if you guys follow she would have you
know we're talking about so yeah we're
thinking like you know we should make a
video like that right so that's exactly
what we're about to do I want a little
twist but it'll be exactly but with a
little twist so what we have here is the
$20 write handwritten letter but the
twist is this handwritten letter with
instructions right it says it's your
lucky day follow these simple
instructions to receive triple the money
step one take the $20 and drive to
target down the street
step two hand the $20 to the homeless
man that is standing on the sidewalk in
front of paleis at the end after you
hand him the money stand there and wait
for your $60 and it says thank you for
being thank you for your good deed right
so the reason why we gave these simple
instructions because we really want to
see if there are good people in the
world right if you're a good person you
would follow these simple instruction
and get rewarded with triple the money
and Catherine and I whenever we go to
Target we always recognize this homeless
man that is always standing outside of
there so we're like you know what let's
help them out today and so not only are
we going to be helping out the homeless
man but we're also going to be helping
out the good person who did a good deed
let's see who that lucky person is and
let's see who that good person is
alright guys so awesome is gonna go put
the letter out there shuffle right here
do we have a rock or something because
what if the wind blows it by the way you
guys are wondering why I was on my lap
it's because we're parked so state so
she's in being her car seat when we
strike moving but you have a stake yeah
Shepard right here over here uh more
towards the front no no you sure yeah we
all just hanging like right for them
okay let me see if you show
see look with $20 is hanging right there
so when someone walks down the stairs
they're gonna be like oh hell yeah hope
these the sticks hold it I need it I
need a rock or something
yeah where's a rock is there a rock what
about a Gatorade oh I got something got
it got it got it
all right that's perfect by the way this
is Catherine's radiation rock all right
let's get it y'all let's see that lucky
person is or should we put it and should
make the edge put it this way so just in
case they come out the elevator they can
also have a chance to be that lucky
person all right guys
hi guys here we go here we go now
where's playing the waiting game and the
nobody can see through oh and yeah and
um and let me just show you guys some
real quick my windows are so tendon that
you can't even see inside the car so no
one can see the camera and my car is
super dirty to need a damn car wash kind
of nervous to see like who that person
is now there's people going and we
already not like three people going to
like the garbage do you mean Shh no and
another thing - were actually whoever
takes this we're actually going to
follow them and see if they follow the
instructions because if they really do
it we're really going to give them
triple the money and obviously the
almost mangas his money as well so in
the day everybody wins if someone just
takes it I can just keep it happy but if
someone just took in so running
I know Mom
Elle is excited too guys
she's excited to see who the lucky
person is but no one comes rest of the
day
not one person cut them hail
what are you doing put my kid right back
hey what are you doing
that's daddy's gatoring give me that hey
you don't put your ear like someone just
walked by here you see it oh wait he
didn't see where's the money mom all
should be in there better
all right is here he's really he's
really
this rotation is minimal tonight yes oh
he wants to look cool looking look he's
looking like this is this is suspicious
look he's looking around looking around
he went back to it he said hell no oh my
gosh that was crazy so he's probably
gonna go deliver his package and then
come back and then go right because how
he can't go right now guys that was so
crazy he read it like three times and
didn't do nothing oh oh here's a girl
girls oh my god she stopped on a
dime she like I need this 20 well I
got a do look why is no one doing it she
wants oh oh no yes you can't see
inside the car why do you no wonder why
is no one is so easy to do guys what why
is nobody taking it why isn't my taking
on the challenge if I saw 20 there with
that letter and them instruction nobody
thing I'll we're doing I think that I
would like look at it too and laugh and
just feel kind of like awkward like do I
do it or not I don't know it's down the
street target living guys is one minute
down the street like it's not that hard
to do for $60
I'll do a butt-naked
it's pretty interesting to see people's
reactions to it I really is also going
to hear might be that girl what the
just took the whole letter she left the
rock she mean reason probably she's
probably the other girls
um roommate wait she's probably just
that girl's roommate she literally just
came down it took everything me or read
nothing so they're probably gonna go and
do it you think they might do it
that was strange guys I was gonna wait
here and see if they come back cuz if
not we might have to do this again
it goes to the bank is the more money
what you think oh someone talk
about the guy back but you saw that it's
gone oh he was probably gonna do it oh
