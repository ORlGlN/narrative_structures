exciting day because I'm flying to
London I don't really know how this vlog
is gonna turn out just because there's
not going to be much to do or say on a
plane but I'm not leaving for the
airport until like 3:30
still packing haven't finished all so
let's please ignore the pimple that I
have going on right here is really
bothering me so I messed with it and now
it looks even worse mmm quickly heading
over to Trader Joe's and Walgreens I
want to pick up lunch snack for the
plane you didn't bring snacks with you
right there's security also I want to
get some travel size stuff from
Walgreens like mini hairspray and
bottles but my face wash and stuff like
that these kind of basket carts are
seriously my favorite thing also gotta
love a good travel Isle I got a veggie
wrap with hummus some watermelon to go
macro bars for the plane travel stuff

much lighting is going to be best for my
QA once we get there happy daddy of the
otter in the background in there
since I knew that today's
is going to be sure and uneventful
because we're on a plane for 10 hours I
tweeted out home asking if you guys have
any questions so we're going to do a
quick on the plane to a also we're kind
of enjoying the free wine right now some
Cheers
did you ask for anything for Christmas
so what girl 1 straight up so far I have
asked my mom for a quality knife set
that is what you know you're in adults
Cheers also I'd like to mention
illegal because we are going to a
country where you're allowed to drink at
if you can describe your personality
with one specific makeup product what
would it be I feel like I'll be
highlighting hot highlighter that's what
I was thinking
soft and gentle highlight dramatic
that was like my project videos my
Ferrucci that was my first expensive
highlighter yeah
what do you think
editing
laundry deterg-- to the fitment
whatever software I really like the
bottles
Tony wait Tony right
you can speak on yourself you
I love down what do you love the most
from your roommates can only pick one
index doesn't count
everyone equally how dare you what are
your life priorities at the moment
getting deep love you
one of my questions what are my life
priorities at the moment
yeah spin bikes it's the same thing
wearing a choker choker choker and
visiting you guys yeah
if you had to describe 2016 in one word
which would you choose
I feel like I made a lot of career
changes
this year is really going to change on
the rest of my
there goes I guess
deeply where you can embed
how about mango mint
I don't think I've ever seen that before
my moment ever
because anyone makes like matcha and
like you became together
like a christmas version launched
you can bet any Christmas
I feel like we're missing that I would
set it to like everyone but are you
seeing your family for Christmas yes I
I'm going to Chicago
favorite part about walk miss being able
to really
watch the pods over
one for watching today's Q&A
I don't know about you guys but this
chicken is sparkling right now Diana's a
little scared that her chickens rosin
touch it again didn't temperature give
it a tap that one is all that I wrote
it's a penis intimate you should get
free wine twelve seconds later chicken
was frozen so he asked for the salad
maybe return it was the last one so we
got three one instead
no no this means on you look like
alcohol like we need to spread it out we
need to spread it out clearly some time
has passed because I'm in a hotel room
right now but I wanted to film the outro
real quick and explain why these two
vlogs are so weird because our flight
was so long and the time differences are
so weird I decided to end blog mistake 5
in the middle of our flight because
that's technically when like the day
kind of ended for us so it's thinking of
combining the two vlogs but I actually
was able to get quite a bit of footage
from landing to now this point which is
the night of the 6th so I think I'll be
able to separate them they might be kind
of short whatever but I hope you guys
enjoy today's video and just know that
tomorrow's vlog is gonna start when I
land in London and it is the 6th just
weird
sorry time zones I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video bye
