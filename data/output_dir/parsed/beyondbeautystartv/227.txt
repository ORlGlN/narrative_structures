Nilla wafers because they're so good

like a fifth necklace okay I want you

so pause the video and read it look at
our new car and now we're just renting
it but it's pretty cute so we're finally
leaving the resort and exploring the
island I think we're gonna go see like
some waterfall or something I don't
really know it's pretty nice
I'm pretty sure this is the cave that I
just seen went in during one of her
kawaii bugs a couple of you guys I've
seen that heat and you know what I'm
talking about
but I think this is where she went oh my
god that's so cool pouring rain right

is a road where cars drive and I just
think it's so cool because a river runs
through it

so I was just standing in that little
spot right there to take a photo and my
mom was literally freaking out

freaking out like I mean it's my dad I
felt like that D we think dad so I don't

above sea level or something and my head
was killing me no I'd like the biggest
headache because I haven't eaten like in
