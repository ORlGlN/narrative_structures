wait wait wait wait what oh my god oh my
god I'm so excited
happy Friday it's about noon I've
basically spent my entire morning
working on emails social drafts
reuploading a video to edit something
things like that just a work lady but I
finally have everything finished up
until Leona hits me up being like here's
another thing you have to do is another
thing you have to say I'm just giving
your but I'm actually gonna head
out and do some Christmas shopping
because I have had no time since coming
back to London to do this yet and today
and tomorrow or like my only days mostly
need to buy gifts for my family to bring
back with me to Chicago because I leave
tomorrow tomorrow night yeah that's what
we're doing right now wearing this
really cool hoodie that I got from
forever 21 online blue jeans some little
slip ons and that was a weird angle my
outfit of the day ah friggin right
what am i doing as
previously heard it is time to Christmas
Shawn quick rant my family is the
hardest family to shop for starting off
with my dad
hardest person shop for never tells us
what he wants ever never never never I'm
talking birthdays holidays nothing and
he's like a dad so like what do you get
a - you know you can only buy him so
many bottles of cologne and shaving kits
and grill accessories and tennis gear oh
I've done it all guys I promise so I
have no idea what to get my dad my mom
is a little easier because I can
basically just buy her whatever I like
because we have very similar styles in
all aspects of life oldest brother
Marcin kind of like my dad no actually
if he knows what he wants he'll ask for
it and just be upfront about it which is
great makes it so easy but when he's not
specifically asking for something he's a
very picky person so it's almost
slightly intimidating trying to choose
something that he's gonna like because
the odds of him liking it are very slim
oh yes stealing someone's spot not
stealing they're leaving so receiving
Kevin I just never know what he wants
either the only thing I can think of him
wanting right now is I know he's super
into making his own matcha drink so I'm
gonna buy him some nice like expensive
bougie matcha powder from out here but
obviously I need to get something more
than that but the first order of
business is to get a cup of coffee I got
the goods
Hey
