I'm so sad like we are over halfway and

here yeah but we just finished getting
ready and now we're eating breakfast

swimming with dolphins in Jamaica like

with a bird on my phone right now just a
bird on my head oh just you

to leave but the birds won't get off my
head come on there we go we're good to
go now no you're free
we just finished eating and now we are
about to go and swim with the dolphins
yay so did you guys enjoy that dull
pitch so we're a little disappointed
because we weren't able to bring our
GoPros with us but it still had to go
exactly yeah
what do it was uncredible and that was
really fun but one of the things that
you get to do is you ride the dolphin
and you're literally like chest-to-chest
them so it would have like harm them and
scratch them
so we weren't allowed to bring cameras
but it was really fun
we got photos and now we're kind of like
what are we doing I don't know how to
play you know today where are we on what

fun and successful day do you want to
say anything do you have any words of
wisdom I feel like she's in Boyle I
literally look I first I am wearing a
