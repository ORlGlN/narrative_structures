I love you love you too hello guys and
welcome to vlogmas day 19 by it's like
god I don't even know I feel like I
should all wait drive my phone yes I do
just kidding nothing just kidding so
it's like 6 o'clock a.m. right now
and I'm going to the airport
and I'm really freaking tired but I
think I'm going to edit my room tour
I'm not really sure yet might sleep
possibly
an hour with the sleeps
I don't really know okay guys time to
rant so basically I was taking at two
flights to get to Aspen's and of course
the first flight that I took got delayed
so I missed my second flight and the
lady was like okay well there are no
other flights flying in today so you're
gonna have to a customer service and
booked a hotel and oh my god I got so
upset I was like basically yelling at
her but anyways it's okay because I
found a different flight to a different
Airport that's a little bit farther away
from Aspen but she offered to pick me up
from there with her mom but now I am
stuck in Denver Colorado Airport for
eight hours
it is currently 11:30 ish and my flight
is at like 7:30 so it's gonna be
wonderful I am currently at war front
front cafe and bistro rush I don't know
I haven't eaten anything - yes
I don't know what I'm gonna get yet but
yeah I came here and they gave me like
there's a customer service vouchers for
free food so I mean like I put me in a
better basically my eight hours
organizes everything
I got a chicken Caesar salad and it
looks so good I'm starving
okay guys my date Wow okay all right my
day is slowly turning around right now
I'm working on editing a vlogmas day 18
and it is going up because I got free
Wi-Fi so once I'm done editing this I'm
going to upload it from the airport and
then I'm gonna work on editing my room
tour video which I started doing on a
plane and it looks really cool
I really like the music that I use for
it so basically I'm just sitting on the
ground because every other outlet that
has seats by it are already taken so I
am on the floor next to this pole but I
found two outlets so I'm happy this is
where I'm gonna be chilling for the next
decade of my life
all right I'm gonna get back to anything
guys so I was editing a video and my mom
tried to FaceTime for the first time
here we are faced timing I'm good I'm
not bored yet surprisingly oh my god I
almost forgot my phone on the floor that
would have been bad um it's exactly 4
o'clock and my flight is at 727 I still
have like 3 and a half
and I basically just been sitting at my
computer I finished ending my room tour
video which turned out really cool so
I'm excited for you guys see that
and I uploaded my blog with sweidy
yesterday but I think I'm gonna get
Starbucks or something because
I'm so freaking tired I'm running out
like 1 hour sleep still and I want to
die but I don't know I plan on sleeping
on the plane that's a good idea
so I decided to stop by Jamba Juice and
I got their banana berry smoothie I
think and then I wanted to get this
double shot of wheatgrass I've never
tried this before and I don't really
know why it comes with an orange so I'm
expecting it to be bad
okay
I see why you need the more image so I
didn't want to say it when I was there
but when I took that wheatgrass shot
thing I was like six sitting at a table
next to at these like two two minutes
we're either my age or older but they
were like really really attractive and
they're like looking at me and then all
of a sudden I whip out a camera and film
myself taking this wheat shot and they
just like looked away and laugh I was
like you don't understand so it was
really embarrassing but yeah I've been
getting like a lot of looks from
vlogging in the airport but I see I've
just gotten to the point where I don't
care like at all
look at how cool this thing is
it's not pretty yeah
we finally landed and I probably look
really gross cuz honey just passed that
Wow I literally felt like a two-minute
fight for me but you just went to bed
and look up and I as if my traveling
experience could get any better
my bag is at the original airport that
US was surprised too so I don't have my
bed we're gonna pick it up tomorrow
morning at home so we just arrived to
Aspen's house
yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah and she's
about to show me Miko's room oh my god
this is so different than what I
expected I don't know I don't know what
I was expecting this is so cute so it is
currently what I was gonna when I am
what I am and I'm just like gotten past
the tired point and really no and that I
am right now that quite a long day quite
an interesting traveling experience but
it's official I supposed to be here
