-  Once upon a time
on a YouTube channel not too far away,
there lived a tired young mother
who worked through her day
with barely a smile.
One night she sat back
in exhaustion and sighed.
When what to her wondering eyes did appear
but her fairy godmother.
With the tap of a wand
and a twirl of it too
her Disney side was revealed
and her happiness grew.
She smiled.
She danced.
She found joy everywhere.
(leaves rustling)
(laughter)
(squealing)
She laughed and she sang.
The magic of life, it was there.
And they lived happily ever after.
The end.
