- Someone as they were leaving
asked to pay for our check.
Are you gonna buy presents?
- Yeah.
-  I think Mom would love a mug.
- I just feel like a mom.
-  Looks like a
lot of the toy section
got picked over.
- You get three since I love you.
-  Oh, thanks Laura.
(Christmas music)
Here we go.
There you go.
What are doing today?
- Going Christmas shopping.
-  Are you gonna buy presents?
- Yeah.
-  Who are you shopping for?
- Everyone.
- Today the kids are doing
their Christmas shopping
for each other and for Jeremy
and I at the Dollar Store.
Okay, let's do it.
What you see?
She's excited.
They're candy.
- Can I have them?
What about one of these?
-  A military action play set.
- Is it pretend?
-  Uh huh.
- Can we get this?
-  Who would it be for?
- Caleb.
-  You think
Caleb would like that?
What is that?
- Plane.
-  Who do you
think would like that?
- Daddy.
Can I have these?
-  What is it?
- Hockey.
-  You know what,
that's actually called golf.
-  Caleb's turn.
Alright, who do you wanna
get something for first?
- Isaac.
-  Go get it.
- Elise.
-  You wanna get Elise a puzzle?
- Perfect.
-  I think Mom would love a mug.
-  It's Elise's turn.
- I just feel like a mom.
I don't know what to get Dad.
I got him shaving cream
and a football every year.
-  So you're having a hard time
thinking of what to get him?
- Yeah.
-  Time to start
your Christmas shopping.
- Oh, candy.
-  Candy is fun.
Let's see if we can walk
around and get any ideas.
What are you picking for Laura?
- This.
-  Nail art.
She's gonna love it.
Why yes, yes I can.
-  Isaac's turn.
So what do you like about this tradition?
- I think it's fun to
get each of the presents
at a Dollar Store.
-  Do you have
any ideas for anyone?
- No.
-  Alright, who
are you getting first?
- I'll go with Laura.
-  Looks like a
lot of the toy section
got picked over, makes
it a little bit harder.
- This is for Elise.
-  She's gonna like that.
- There's a new basketball
sticker collection.
-  A new one.
- Yes, are you allowed to
get stuff for yourself?
-  Maybe Nae-nae would like it.
No, you can't get stuff for yourself.
- This ball for Leesy.
-  You think
Leesy would like a ball?
You think I would like this one?
- Yeah.
-  Oh, that is beautiful.
- I would like one of these babies.
-  You think
Elise would like the baby?
- Yeah.
-  I see somebody
who would like a baby.
Who likes the baby?
Who's trying to reach it?
She's trying to get it.
-  I bet Nae-nae would like this.
-  Do you like that baby doll?
It's always fun to me to
see what they pick out
and what they think of and
sometimes it's hilarious
and sometimes it's surprising
me how thoughtful it is.
Sometimes it surprises me what
they're noticing about each other.
- For you.
-  Oh let me see it.
Oh, these are nice, who's that one for?
- You.
-  For me?
Do you like the headbands?
- Yeah, I like these kinds of headbands.
-  For who?
- You.
-  For me?
- You get three since I love you.
-  Oh, thanks Laura.
- Are these real flowers.
-  Those are
actually called fake flowers.
They're beautiful though huh?
Are you done shopping?
- Yep.
(upbeat music)
- That could be for Laura.
This is Laura's.
-  Some gum?
Good choice.
- Isaac is gonna love this.
-  Is that for Jenae?
Is that the money you
earned from doing chores?
- Yep, sure is.
-  Who's that one for?
- Elise.
-  Elise.
- Mom.
Janae-nae.
This is for Laura.
-  It is $6.55.
You have 45 cents and
there's your receipt.
Take your change too.
-  Your money.
- I'm gonna give Daddy socks.
-  Nice.
- He's been needing them.
Don't tell Daddy.
- You want something?
-  You want it?
You like that?
She likes this section apparently.
- I've always wanted a slinky.
-  For you?
- When I give someone something,
they might give it to me.
-  Or you might get to use it.
- Yeah.
This is Caleb's.
This is the perfect section
to give something to Isaac.
(jazzy Christmas music)
-  That's beautiful.
- I want this.
-  It's always hard
not to just shop for yourself.
It's really easy to get
distracted in a Dollar Store.
There's so many interesting things.
- Do you think Isaac will like these?
More athletic.
-  Yeah, they look great.
Why don't you try them on?
Those will be awesome.
So who are those for?
- Isaac.
I can't believe all of this is a dollar.
-  I know.
- Janae-nae.
- Dad.
-  Okay, let's shop for Daddy.
- New nail polish.
-  New nail polish is very pretty.
You can put it in for a choice.
- We have to buy one more for Daddy now.
Is this nail polish?
-  Yeah, it's nail art.
- I want one of these nail art.
-  Well maybe somebody
else will get one for you.
- I'm gonna one for myself.
-  Yeah, but today we are going
Christmas shopping for our family.
So you get to buy a present for Leesy.
You could get that for Leesy.
- No, what are these?
-  Those are fashion nails.
You stick them on your fingers.
- I want these for Leesy.
I think Daddy would like this.
-  I think he would, go ahead.
Put it in there.
- That's a lot of stuff.
-  We do not have enough money
for all of those things.
You have to choice just one
present for each person okay?
So what do you wanna get for Daddy?
She made some last minute changes
and here's her lineup.
I think you picked out
some really good gifts.
Poor Laura's at must the age where
it's actually really hard to understand
that you're not buying
yourself a Christmas present.
She's being a trooper.
Money still in your pocket?
Are you ready to pay for it?
Good job Laura, just
put it right up there.
(Christmas music)
There you go.
(Christmas music)
- That's for our baby.
-  Oh, that's so sweet.
-  Okay, there's your money.
Laura is doing her own
Christmas shopping today.
- Here you go.
-  There you go.
- I did it.
-  You got money
back, that's called change.
-  Here you go, thank you.
-  Thank you.
Are you all done with
your Christmas shopping?
Okay, let's go.
-  How did it go Laura?
- Good I got...
-  You got some change?
That's exciting.
Hi Dad.
What do you think Laura would like?
- This mirror.
-  A mirror?
I bet she would like that.
You know who else I think
might like that right now?
Nae-nae.
(giggles)
- Okay, I'll get another one too.
I'm getting that for her.
- The advantage of having Janae with us,
we can see what she likes.
You like the truck?
We should probably buy this.
Whoa, check out the sunset.
-  Elise is
done with her shopping.
- There's like this one
thing that I really wanted.
I might wanna tell one of my siblings.
-  Yeah, was
it hard to not get it?
- Yeah.
-  That's the hard
thing about Christmas.
- I basically wanted it my whole life.
-  Is it hard
around Christmas time
to be shopping for everybody else?
- Yeah.
Maybe I'll just tell one of
my siblings that I want it.
-  Do you know what helps me?
It helps me to remember that on Christmas,
I'll receive gifts too.
What really helps me is to think about
how excited people are
gonna be about this.
Think about how Janae's
gonna react to your present.
And think about how Laura's
gonna be so excited.
- I'm glad that I got tiny objects
so then when it's in
the package it's like...
-  Yep, nobody will even know.
Not the money.
Do you see something fun over there?
- How are you?
- Good.
- Thank you.
This is your change.
- Thank you.
- There you go, have a good day.
- Merry Christmas.
Can I give some of my cents to the...
-  Bell ringer?
Sure can, let's do it.
- How much?
-  How ever much
you want, it's your choice.
Since the other kids
got presents for Janae,
I'm also going to be helping Janae
get a couple gifts for the kids.
Is it time to do your Christmas shopping?
Which one of these ones?
Oh that one looks good?
Alright Nae-nae, which one?
You want that one?
Oh you want both of them?
You can only have one for Laura.
Tough decisions.
Okay, you licked that one,
we're gonna call that one yours.
Which one for Laura, tough decision huh?
I think that's everything.
Now we're gonna go home and wrap.
(rock music)
I love this burger.
-  What happened Caleb?
- Somebody paid for us.
-  Yeah, just one
of the other people here
anonymously paid for us.
- So our waiter just came up
and told us that someone
as they were leaving
asked to pay for our check.
It's just amazing.
He said Merry Christmas.
I just wanna know who it was
so we could go thank them.
- There was this cute old couple over here
that was like super nice watching
and sympathetic of some of the challenges
I was having of watching the kids.
Maybe it was them, I don't know.
But thank you whoever it was.
- So we couldn't tell you
this in the restaurant
but we were so, I don't know, touched
that somebody else paid our bill
that we realized wait, we
should pass that along.
We looked around and
said, hey we wanna pay
for somebody else's bill.
I don't know, it was just kind of special.
The kids were all excited and
we're like don't look at them.
So they weren't supposed to tell them
that the bill was paid
until after we were gone.
So I get they're finding out now.
- So with people paying for our meal
during this Christmas
season, it just reminded me
of the Light the World
campaign which is all about
reminding us to love each
other and to spread goodness.
So if you haven't heard of it,
I'm gonna put a link
in the description box
to the new Light the World video.
One of our kids is in it.
So check it out and let
us know in the comments
which kid it is.
(Christmas music)
- Goodnight, J House out.
- I turned the car off
without putting it in park.
The car started to roll
and I was out of the car.
(Christmas music)
- This girl just wrote her
name for the first time ever.
I go and I put the tape
in the refrigerator.
Losing my mind just a little bit.
(Christmas music)
