Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)
-  Alright you guys, how did it go
sleeping in the tent?
- Went pretty well.
- It was very fun.
- It was a little bit scary
because I had a bad dream.
(group conversation)
- You guys, let the air out.
- All the air out.
- Alright, I'm laying on it,
I'm walking on it.
(uplifting music)
(laughter)
Thanks for helping.
(laughing)
Dancing (laughs).
(upbeat music and laughter)
So I don't know if you guys remember
when Caleb flooded the
toilet and caused a leak,
and then we had this hole in our ceiling.
We have a friend from
church who's a builder,
Chris, he's out here giving us a quote
'cause we're gonna try
to mix some things up.
- We think we should fix it.
And we're also thinking about
putting a wall up down here
and creating an office space.
-  Like a fourth bedroom.
- Yeah, it would be a fourth bedroom,
but right now we would
use it as an office space.
So we're just looking into that.
It'd be sad to break up the nice big room,
but I think there'd still be enough room
for the kids to play.
- Yeah, big decisions.
- Look, look at that clean bathroom.
Ah!
So it's officially spring,
oh my goodness, I hear an ice cream truck.
That's cute, anyway,
it's just funny, like we had
snow flurries this weekend
and it was freezing,
and now we're out in our short sleeves
enjoying the sunshine,
and I think the kids are
gonna be outside playing
all day long.
We have friends over now,
more friends coming this afternoon,
we're gonna be with our cousins tonight,
so we're just enjoying the spring.
- So our cousins are really
big into Harry Potter,
and that's what they're playing right now.
- Wingardium leviosa!
Wingardium leviosa, leviosa.
- What is it again?
- Wingardium leviosa.
- Wingardium leviosa, pshoo.
-  Oh, what happened to me?
-  You float.
-  I float?
Okay, tell him another one.
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus, yeah, (mumbles).
- Expelliarmus, pshoo.
-  Ah!
- Ha ha.
- We're gonna go get Malfoy now.
-  Okay.
(piano music)
So Allison got her hair cut,
I love it.
- Kitty, kitty, come here, come here.
-  Is there a kitty?
- Meow, meow.
Come here, kitty.
-  Is that a kitty?
Do you see the doggie?
- Hi, doggie.
Woof woof, woof woof.
-  So Brett and
Michelle are babysitting
a dog right now who's name is Dexter,
and he's a cute little, I think maltipoo?
Is that what he's called?
- (laughs) I hope so.
- Michelle, is he a maltipoo?
-  I think he's
maltese, or a maltipoo.
- It's a maltese, or a maltipoo.
- There's a dog called a
maltipoo, that's awesome.
- And I love it, I love the
little tiny white fluffy dogs,
and I'm sorry, my nose itches.
(laughter)
- It's a vlogging thing,
when she starts to talk to the camera,
her nose itches, you're
allergic to the camera.
- (laughs) Oh, anyway,
so I just love him,
like he's just so cute,
and the size is small enough
that the kids aren't
as intimidated by him.
(upbeat music and background conversation)
Say, "There you go, Dexter."
- So if you have a dog,
let us know in the comments
what kind of dog do you have.
- (mumbles) What is the word?
- Obliviate?
Yeah, yeah.
- Obliviate! (mouth explosion)
- He's a natural born wizard right there.
- Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)
Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)
Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)
-  Oh, you got him.
You turned him into a monkey.
You said it a little bit wrong.
(laughter)
- Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)
Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)
♫ Who sent his son to walk with men
♫ On earth so we may know
-  So with Easter coming up,
we are dyeing Easter eggs today.
- So last year at our house,
we accidentally dyed a
whole carton of raw eggs.
-  It was awesome.
- It made for some interesting times.
So I saw somewhere the idea
to put rubber bands on it,
so it'll make some white stripes,
we're gonna see if it works out.
What are you doing with yours, Lisey?
- Doing both sides.
- Doing two different colors.
Do you wanna eat one, Laura?
-  Pink with blue stripes.
- She doesn't really understand
what we're doing yet.
- Mine's the slowest, I
have to wait very long.
Look, it's not even dark.
- Alright, Laura picked green this time.
(laughter)
- Ew, that's vinegar, gross.
Is that yummy?
- Yucky.
-  It's pretty
though, I like that color.
- Alright, let's take these off.
(children talking at the same time)
Glad I'm not wearing a white shirt.
-  Did it work?
- It did work.
-  That's cool.
-  That is an evil egg.
-  Caleb, yours
is a little bit sparkly.
-  Now you're all sparkly.
-  Here, throw this
in the red for just a minute.
-  Okay, let's set it down.
(upbeat music)
-  Goodnight, J House out.
-  This may be
the cutest little thing.
Stop acting like a pest, says Beezus,
who's real name is Beatrice.
