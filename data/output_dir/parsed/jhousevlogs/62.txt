- Hi!
-  Hi! (laughs)
Did you have fun with the stickers?
- Yep.
(banjo music)
-  You guys tryin'
to eat the bubbles?
-  This is low and high
and off, but then there's also
numbers on here, so I have no idea.
So this is our new family read aloud.
-  So even though we
went to bed really late
last night, the kids are still
in their Kansas City time.
And so they were up long before the sun,
I think it was like 5
AM, so we've unpacked,
we're getting ready for
the day bright and early.
(soothing music)
-  Alright, so what do
you notice about the roses?
Take a close look.
- They're prickly?
-  They are prickly, do
you guys see all the thorns?
- Why?
-  But, can you smell one Laura?
Smell what the rose smells like.
-  Don't prick your nose.
-  Smells good, huh?
(relaxing piano music)
- So this courtyard is
awesome, all the kids are in
the courtyard and I look up
and I'm like, where's Janae?
Are you wishing you were outside, too?
There they are!
Hi!
- Hi!
-  Hi! (laughs)
-  (baby gibberish)
-  I know, they're
all out there being crazy.
- So the boys were playing
football out here and they lost
the ball down the hill.
Oh, it's way down there.
So there's a little path
down there, I'm gonna see
if there's a way down to the path.
(uplifting music)
I'm trying to do this.
Got it!
I remember as a kid playing
with my brothers, we were always
losing the ball over the fence.
We didn't have to climb
down a big hill though
to get it most of the time,
we just had to like ask
our neighbor for it.
- This house we're staying
at is full of these cute
little things I keep discovering.
The door knocker on this
door is a couple kissing.
(knocking)
-  Go!
Over the top.
(laughter)
- Rebounds-and-sist so he did do it all.
-  Were you recording?
- Yeah, I didn't drop it at all.
(relaxing piano music)
I keep on catching the bubbles.
-  Nae-nae, look at the bubbles!
Good job, Laura.
- Ahhhh!
-  You guys tryin'
to eat the bubbles?
-  Oh, look at that one!
-  We're really happy,
they had a little booster
seat here for Nae-nae
so she can sit up with
all the rest, which
makes her the most happy.
- Well you guys are gonna think I'm crazy,
because I think I'm a little
crazy, but I literally packed
my blender and brought
it with us on our trip.
Because I love my morning
smoothies so much, and I didn't
know if the rental place
would have a smoothie blender.
That's what those things are called.
Anyway, and I like to be
able to put lots of veggies
in it, so I'm excited to
use it while I'm here.
-  So I know long term
we're gonna have to teach
Janae that she can't rest
her foot on the table,
but it's pretty adorable right now.
-  This girl makes us so happy.
(upbeat music)
How are you, are you
inspired by Dad's moves?
Yeah it is, this kitchen is for dancing.
Show 'em how it's done, Nae-nae!
-  (baby talk)
-  What do you have in your hand?
What is it?
- Swimsuit.
-  Why'd you bring your swimsuit?
- Because, just in case I need it since
we're going to the beach.
-  Well, we're
actually going to Walmart.
- We are actually go to Walmart.
-  Maybe, baby.
Kay, go get in the car.
Laura has been so cute
here, she is so excited.
The very first thing she
did this morning was put
on her swimsuit, it was
like 5:30 AM and she put her
jacket on on top of it because
she's like, "It's cold,
but I need to be ready for the beach".
And then, we're getting ready
to go to Walmart, and I look
down and she's got her bathing
suit stuck under her arm.
I'm like, what are you
doing, and she says,
"I'm bringing my swimsuit", I'm like why?
She's like, "Just in case
I need it, just in case
we end up at the beach, you
always want to be prepared Mom."
I afraid she's really going
to be disappointed when
we actually go to the beach
and she realizes it's freezing.
We brought our swimsuits so
we could go to some pools
that are in the area, I
don't expect the kids to swim
in the ocean, so she
might have a different
idea about that than I do.
(upbeat music)
So we're driving to Walmart
and all yesterday evening
and all this morning, I worked
on the list of what we need.
Because I didn't pay attention
to like what's already
at the rental house, what we're
gonna need, and guess what?
We're on the way to Walmart,
we're almost there, and I
don't have the list, and I
was really bummed about that,
and then I said it out loud, and then...
- I have the list!
- Isn't it amazing?
He's like, "Oh, I saw it
on the counter and I just
grabbed it", and I'm like, I'm so glad.
-  Do you know what exit I'm taking?
- No, but it might be...
-  We just missed it.
- Yeah, don't go out
when you don't know where
you're driving guys, you
might miss your exit.
It's working out just fine,
we just had to make a U-turn.
- It's hard when you're in a
new place, like yesterday we
missed a turn, and it was 25
to 30 minutes to get back.
- When you're in a new place,
like their roads are laid out
differently, like where we
would expect things to be
on the left, sometimes
they're on the right.
- We were driving up and
there was covered parking for
the Walmart, we thought that
was pretty cool, and as we got
underneath it we saw that
they're solar panels.
- Whaaaaaaat?
-  That's pretty cool.
- That is really cool.
(upbeat music)
- Let's just say that shopping
with five over tired kids
is not, not a great play.
Does that pen look like
a microphone to you?
- Guess what, he has hair!
-  Kids are so excited,
there's an airplane dragging a banner.
-  Was it really close to us before?
- Yeah, he was like right there.
- It's a plane dragging a banner.
-  Isn't that cool?
- Yeah.
(relaxing music)
- So the kids are out back
eating, and Kendra and I are
enjoying some alone time here
in the courtyard eating lunch.
Soup and salad, and Pringles.
Only the finest.
- Hopefully this is the last
store that we have to go to for
a couple of days, but we're
trying to get kind of everything
set up and organized for our time here.
So the girls and I are
headed to Trader Joe's.
The boys are watching Janae
and watching football.
- Hike!
-  Nice, good play.
- I'm a quarterback.
-  Quarterback Caleb.
(funky music)
-  Nice, perfect throw!
There he is, woo-hoo!
- So we don't have Trader
Joe's in our county,
so this is a real treat.
I've heard of Trader Joe's, I
don't think I've been in it,
except maybe once like a decade ago,
so I'm excited to see what they have.
(upbeat music)
Well we got some yummy food
now, it's home to try out
the grill for the first time.
What do you think of Trader Joe's?
- I like it.
-  Did you have
fun with the stickers?
- Yep!
- We're using the grill
for the first time.
Jeremy's cookin' dinner,
we are having sliders.
-  I'm excited.
-  Me too, they're gonna be yummy!
What are you doing, Isaac?
- We're watching the game and
going out and playing what
they did in the game, and then we're
just doing the normal play.
-  Got it, so you're doing the plays
they're doing in the game.
- Yeah.
-  That's awesome.
- Yes, I didn't go up!
Your turn
- Two yellows.
- So this is my first time
cooking dinner in here,
so I'm just trying to find
like the right utensils to use
with everything, and
I'm trying to figure out
how the oven works.
So the stove really has
me baffled right now,
I'm sauteing some mushrooms
for our sliders and I can't
figure out if I have the heat
on high, or not super high.
There's markers for low to high.
See, it says low and high and
off, but then there's also
numbers on here, so I have no idea.
I think I have it on pretty
high, but I'm so confused.
Dinner is served, sliders with fixin's,
and these are garlic fries.
-  Looks good.
-  First dinner
in the new dining room.
- Hi!
- My favorite part of the day
was trying to go shopping.
- Alright, let's pray.
-  Alright guys, what time is it?
No, not actually what time is
it, like what are we doing?
- We're reading our read aloud book.
-  We're starting a new read aloud.
And because of the time
change, we are all very tired.
Take care of me, be a doll.
- It's been a long day, let's go to bed.
-  So this is our
new family read aloud,
it's a gold rush adventure.
-  J House Out!
-  Basketball on skates?
(upbeat music)
- We've got food, and we
are somewhere fun, and it's
gonna be bedtime any minute!
