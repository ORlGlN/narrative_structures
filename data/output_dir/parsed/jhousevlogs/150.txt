- Janae had a big poo
and it's very disgusting and yeah.
- Did you just see that?
- So it's getting hotter
and hotter in our house
and I just called about getting it fixed
and they closed 15 minutes ago.
(jolly music)
- Good morning.
I actually have a really
terrible headache this morning.
But I'm getting up and
I'm trying to keep going
because I'm a mom, and that's
the only choice you have
when you're a mom.
I know all the moms out there understand.
(baby cries)
If your mom is near you right now,
give her a great big hug
and tell her she's awesome
because being a mom is a really hard job.
- You're awesome, mom.
- I didn't know she was listening.
You're awesome, Elise.
It's gonna be a good day.
- So I just changed into this
and I still have my shorts on.
-  Oh, good thing.
What's the paper and pen for?
- Oh, I have to draw things on it
and so that I don't get sick very much.
-  It'll keep you from being sick
if you draw things there?
- Yeah.
-  Oh, good thing.
- Isaac's learning a song on the piano
and singing along to
it, it sounds awesome.
♫ I'll be there to save the day
♫ Superman got nothing on me
♫ I'm only one call away
-  He's so fun to
listen to when he practices.
(piano playing)
(drumming and singing)
(upbeat music)
(Janae laughing)
- Janae had a big poo,
like all the way big to her back,
and it's weird because
how she eats real food
is how she has like real, real poo.
Real.
Poo.
And it's very disgusting and yeah.
- So Jeremy and I are both
in the room on opposite sides
and we both look at Janae at the same time
and we see her crawl forward.
We're both like, "Did you just see that?"
Baby girl, you crawling?
All the toys over there.
(Jeremy and Kendra laughing)
You're doing it, you're doing it, come on.
Get over here.
(Jeremy laughing)
That's crawling!
You're crawling, baby girl!
Watch out, world.
-  She can move.
There it is.
- Yay.
-  It's so fun to get to document
her progress through all her life.
Love you.
- I don't know if I'm
ready for my baby to crawl.
And it's definitely time to start
some serious baby-proofing around here.
- So over on our Facebook page,
Kendra asked what baby gates
we should be considering,
and we got so many suggestions from you.
It's so fun to have that
interaction over there.
- So we have a pile out
here, what are these?
- Blankets!
- They're a special kind,
yeah they're quilts.
- These are quilt or things people make.
- Right?
Kay, so who made this one?
- You!
- You!
- And it was my baby blanket.
- It was.
This one!
- Daddy.
- Dad?
Dad did not make this.
- You.
- I made this one again.
Who did I make it for?
- Isaac and--
- Isaac and me.
I think it was for Caleb.
- It was, it was Caleb's baby blanket.
(cheering)
- This one!
- For me!
- Grandma!
- Grandmom.
- It's so beautiful!
She made it by hand.
- Well, I'm sure she used
a sewing machine too.
So guys, this one's really special
because it was given to your Dad and I
from Grandmother.
(upbeat music)
It's called Papa and the Pioneer Quilt.
(telling story)
So what are they collecting along the way?
- Fabrics!
- Scraps of fabric, okay.
So every time she gets a scrap of fabric
I'm gonna give you all
a scrap of fabric too.
(upbeat music)
Elise is helping me with lunch.
What are we making?
- Tuna salad sandwiches.
-  Chicken salad pitas.
When we make chicken salad,
instead of using mayo, or Miracle Whip,
we use plain greek yogurt
and then add just a
titch of ranch seasoning
and it's really good and it's
a little healthier that way.
Is the can opener giving you problems?
- Yeah, I'm right almost there.
-  You're almost there.
You can do it, girlfriend.
You are strong.
- I did not know I could open a can.
-  Well, you
did a great job on it.
We just added the ranch,
it's looking good.
- Lunch is served.
- So I got out all of my scrap fabrics
and I'm letting the kids
lay them out on the floor
and design what they would do for a quilt
with those scrap fabrics.
This is a very unique design, Isaac.
I love it when we do an
activity where everybody's quiet
'cause they're so engaged
in what they're doing.
To me, that's like a
winning moment as a mom.
Oh my goodness, what a fun quilt!
I love the sparkly one.
- Mm hm.
- So Isaac decided to go abstract
and not make it into a
square or a rectangle.
And here's what Laura
ended up finishing up
with her quilt.
Here's Isaac's second design.
I love it, dude.
Here's Caleb's finished quilt.
And you turned into Superman.
(glorious music)
81 degrees inside, and we've
been trying to cool it off
and it just keeps getting hotter.
So we actually got our
air conditioning fixed
or replaced or something like that
back in the spring, and so
it should not be going out.
So I don't know why it's
not cooling off our house.
(rock music)
-  So what are we doing, Caleb?
-  We're building a bench!
Or a table.
-  Yup, we're gonna
put the bench together.
(rock music)
-  Whoa!
-  Go ahead and
take all the pieces out.
And let's set them out on the floor.
(rock music)
- These are the legs.
- All right, the first thing you gotta do
is get a screwdriver.
- I think it's much easier
if I just get my tools.
- Go get your drill from your toolbox.
- Dad!
- Grab a screwdriver, we
gotta unscrew all of these.
- Okay.
(rock music)
- Caleb, you're trying
to do it all in one load?
So when I'm doing projects like this,
it's important for me to always remember
I'm not trying to build a
bench the quickest I can,
I'm trying to do it with my kids
because raising the kids is more important
than how fast the bench gets built.
And what we're gonna do
is on each of the screws
we're gonna first put
on this big disc washer.
- Ooh, it's hot in here.
- So it's getting hotter
and hotter in our house,
and I just called about getting it fixed
and they closed 15 minutes ago.
So if we're gonna have someone
come out and look at it,
it's an extra 150 dollars.
I tried turning it off and turning it on,
that works with computers,
maybe it'll work with the AC.
We'll see.
But if it keeps getting hotter
we're gonna have to just
pay the after-hours fee.
(Janae crying)
She is not happy about that.
-  All right,
now stand it up tall.
-  Now sit on it and make sure
that it's good and strong.
- Oh!
It's perfect.
- Hey, Dad, you need to get on it
so we know it's perfect.
-  Why would that help?
- Because you weigh a ton.
(Jeremy laughing)
-  All right, if
it can hold all of you.
- Wow!
(applause)
- It can hold up all of us.
-  Good job.
-  Bring it on in.
-  All right.
A bench!
-  We have a bench!
Table for eight.
It doesn't match perfectly,
this is like a little bit more tan
and this is a little bit more yellow
but it is close enough.
I'm so excited that instead
of buying a whole new table,
a bench solves this problem.
Yes!
We have friends over,
and we're playing in
the sprinkler tonight,
which is awesome, 'cause it's warm out.
(children laughing and playing)
Filling up the pool?
For the little kids, that's nice of you.
Well, it is after 8 p.m.
and it's still 83 degrees
in our house and the
temperature just keeps rising
and so we now have an
air conditioning person
out in the dark using a flashlight
trying to figure out what's wrong
with our air conditioner.
-  Good night.
J House out.
-  Two.
Two boxes.
- Wait, I'm excited about both of these!
-  I know.
I'm sorry, buddy.
-  I did it!
I did it, I did it.
I figured it out.
I know the answer, and Jeremy doesn't.
