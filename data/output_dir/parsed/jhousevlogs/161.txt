(bright music)
-  Caleb found his seat.
- I am a scary monster.
-  Are these the scary monsters?
You're gonna eat me?
No, don't eat me, scary monsters!
- Do you know who these people are?
-  What, I thought
you guys were scary monsters.
You tricked me.
- We were just pretending.
- You just wrap up like this.
- Boom, scary monster.
The echo is really creepy in there too,
do your scary monster voice.
- Waaa.
-  Whoa.
- And mine is (hisses).
-  Maybe for Halloween,
you guys can be scary monsters.
- Oh yeah.
We need these to be our scary monsters.
-  Is that your costumes?
- Want to see something cool?
I can make it so nobody thinks I'm here.
-  It's just a
blanket with a basket on top.
And then out of nowhere, it's a person.
- So Laura and I are just sitting here
talking about Christmas,
which she's been very
interested in lately,
because she keeps wanting to talk
about her birthday.
And I'm like, babe,
that's a long ways away,
that's after Christmas,
and so now we're talking
about Christmas.
So Miss Laura, do you remember Christmas?
Do you remember Christmas trees?
- Are Christmas trees
are gonna be outside?
-  There are
Christmas trees outside,
but we're gonna put one inside our house
and put lights on it.
(gasps)
Okay, what else do we do for Christmas?
- Get candy!
- It's really interesting to me
to see how little she remembers.
I guess she was two last Christmas,
but I'm like, that was only
like what, eight months ago?
How can you forget Christmas?
What happened on Christmas?
- Well, one time I threw up.
-  You did
throw up last Christmas.
How do you remember that,
but you don't remember
what Christmas is about?
So Miss Laura, what happens on Christmas?
- We eat yummy stuff.
-  So we eat yummy stuff.
What else do we do on Christmas?
So what do we do when we
wake up on Christmas morning,
what do we do?
- We get ready and do chores.
-  Is that what
we do on Christmas?
- Yeah.
-  Don't you remember
anything about Christmas?
- No.
-  Who's so special
that was born on Christmas
that we celebrate it?
Not you, it's not your birthday.
- Janae nae!
-  Not Janae.
Who was born on Christmas?
- I don't know.
-  Jesus.
- Jesus, Jesus!
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
-  Did you know that Christmas
is Jesus' birthday, that's
why we celebrate it.
- So we put out a lot of stuff?
-  Yeah, we do a Christmas tree.
- Mom.
-  Did you just say Mom?
(Kendra laughs)
Mama.
You want to crawl so badly.
(Janae cooing)
Good job.
I swear you look older
today, just in one day.
Did you grow up last night?
Are you talking now?
Can you say Dada?
Look at that drool.
So Janae started over there
and now she's over here.
Yeah.
(Janae vocalizing)
So this morning, Laura is
at her little preschool.
And so the kids and I have been getting
some schoolwork done.
We tracked more hurricanes
and we did some cursive
handwriting practice,
and now we're reading another
chapter of Harry Potter.
You want to read two chapters?
- Yes please.
-  And Janae's just
hanging out in baby toy land.
Okay, let's keep reading Harry Potter.
(dance music)
-  Hey.
Yeah.
He's dancing.
(uptempo dance music)
(Jeremy laughs)
Whoa.
Whoa.
♫ I'm not throwing away my shot
♫ I'm just like I'm country,
♫ I'm young strapping and hungry,
♫ And I'm not throwing away my shot
(laughing)
We just had lunch, listening to Hamilton
and dancing like maniacs.
It was fun.
- I think Laura fell asleep.
-  Laura, how was
your pre-school today?
(murmuring)
Do you want lunch?
- Laura, are you sleeping?
Yeah.
-  Laura, do you want
to do a dance party with us?
No dance party.
- I feel like this girl.
Let's go to sleep.
-  Alright good night big girl.
- Nap time.
-  Have a good nap.
(trilling)
(sweet music)
(laughing)
(trilling)
Boom chickaboom chickaboom chickaboom.
(snorting)
- Mamamamamamama.
(laughing)
We gotta stop playing with you.
We gotta get your clothes on.
(lively music)
- The kids go to a
homeschool enrichment program
one day a week,
and so they're just coming
to meet their teachers.
Caleb found his seat.
(enchanting music)
- So since Jeremy has the big kids
at back to school night,
Laura and Janae and I are going
on a relaxing walk, right before bedtime.
I'm trying to calm them down,
so bedtime will be easier.
And the weather is amazing out here.
Sometimes it's hard for me
that I can't go to some
of the other things
or we choose to have the
big kids go one place
and the little kids stay with me,
but I also really enjoy it.
It's kind of a nice one on two time
to just be with the little kids
and to do some things I used to do
when I just had Isaac and Elise as kids.
It's kind of special.
- What?
Look at this.
-  That's a praying mantis.
- Are these real?
(jazzy music)
-  Alright, go down to Spanish.
Spin the tail on the donkey.
(laughing)
So Elise, how are you feeling
about starting school?
- Good.
-  How about you Isaac?
- I'm excited.
-  So Laura, what is that?
- I don't know.
-  What do you think it might do?
- Spray.
-  Spray what?
- Water?
-  Why would it spray water?
- Those things spray water.
-  It's called a fire hydrant.
(gasps)
- Then it better get out of there.
-  It's called a fire hydrant,
because if a fire happens,
then the fire truck can come up
and hook a hose onto it,
and then it sprays water
to put the fire out.
So firefighters use them.
- Does dragons put out fire?
-  Dragons make
fires with their mouths,
but they don't put out
fires, I don't think.
- Yes they do.
-  Oh they do?
- Yeah, even firefighters.
-  Firefighters and dragons.
- Yeah, same difference.
-  Same difference?
(Kendra laughs)
So Miss Laura,
- What?
-  what are we doing tonight?
- Going on a walk,
only until the Sun's down.
-  Yep, we're
going on a long walk.
- Yep.
-  These two
are my little buddies.
- And Janae nae is our baby.
-  Good night.
J House out.
