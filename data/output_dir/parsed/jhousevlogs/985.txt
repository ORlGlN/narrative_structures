- Hey, this is Kendra from J House,
and I am going to show you guys
how to make candy parachutes.
The kids have been very excited about it.
And what I liked about this
activity is it's not very messy,
it's super quick and
easy, and it uses stuff
that I already had around the house.
So, you need string, or, in
my case, I'm just using yarn,
'cause that's what I had.
You'll also need some tape, some scissors,
and you'll need tissue
paper, the kind, like,
with gift wrapping.
At first, I thought it meant,
like, Kleenexes tissues,
but those wouldn't be
big enough, so you want
the full size sheets of tissue paper.
And, of course, you need candy.
I bought the mini size,
and that does work,
but I think the fun size
would be more better,
and be even more fun.
This activity was inspired by this book,
Christmas from Heaven, and
I'm gonna tell you more
about that in a minute.
Here's how you make them.
You just take your full
sheet of tissue paper,
it's 24 inches by 24 inches,
and then, you need about
48 inches of string.
And, so, one,
two, three, four.
Close enough.
What matters is that the
string is the same length,
so then, I'm just going to match that.
So you've got your two
strings of the same length.
Now you're going to use the tape.
Isaac, can you grab me the tape?
And you're going to tape
it to the opposite edges,
like this.
Okay.
So you're going to tape it to
the opposite edges, like this.
Okay, now I'm gonna do the other one.
Alright, now that I've
got all four edges taped
you pull it up together
in the center, like this,
and you tie just a regular knot.
Like, just a regular, old knot.
And the candy is gonna go in this part,
the little loop that's left over.
Got it?
And now you have...
a candy parachute!
Good job!
Okay, now we're gonna match
it up so it's the same length.
- I'll put it right here.
- Okay, get another one.
She chose the Twix, she's a smart girl.
Cut it right there.
Very nice.
(Caleb laughs)
Now we're gonna put the tape on.
Okay, I need you to get
me a little piece of tape.
Good work!

The idea comes from this book.
Oh! That's the back.
Okay, this book, Christmas from Heaven,
the true story of the Berlin candy bomber.
It tells the story of Gail Halvorsen,
who was a pilot after World War Two.
He was flying needed supplies
into the Berlin area,
like flour, and just stuff
that they needed to survive,
and it was then that he
noticed the children there,
and the war-torn city
that they were living in.
And the children had nothing,
and he just wanted to give them something.
So he got his buddies
together, and they pooled
their candy rations, they
tied them to parachutes,
and they dropped them from the airplanes
as they were flying overhead.
Anyway, the idea caught
on, and by Christmas,
people in America had
donated 21 tons of candy,
that were then tied to
parachutes, and dropped down
onto Berlin.
I love this story.
I'm a sucker for
non-fiction picture books,
and I love a story that ties
in history, and geography,
and compassion, and
just, true life heroes.
The kids love the book,
I highly recommend it.
And in the back it gave
instructions for how to make
your own candy parachutes, so
we just knew we had to try it.
Thanks for watching my
crafty collab video.
This is a collaboration with
other YouTube mommy meetup
mommies, and so, in the links
below you'll find the links
to all of their channels.
There is going to be a
Christmas craft posted every day
from now until Christmas, so
go ahead and check 'em out.
Thanks! Bye!
