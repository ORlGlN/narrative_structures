So Laura, what did you choose
for your birthday breakfast?
- Monkey bread and strawberries.
-  Yep and she
wanted some apple juice.
Your picture turned out great.
Alright, we're gonna go around the room
saying things we love about Laura.
We would love in the comments to hear
what you love about Laura.
- I love how thoughtful
and aware Laura is.
When someone in our
family is sad or upset,
she often goes to them
and gives them a hug.
And just is so kind.
- I love that whenever someone is like
doing something kind of scary,
she always is like, I don't
think you should do that.
- I love that Laura's really
cute and is always nice too.
- It's always been funny
to me that even though
Laura is on the younger
side of the family,
she has a take charge personality.
She's like, hey guys, let's do this.
I'm like, do you realize
you're smaller than
most everybody here.
She's an organizer.
- I love how Laura has such big hugs
every time she sees me.
- I love that she's so thoughtful
of like if someone was feeling sad,
she would go up to them and sit by them.
- Laura comes up with the
funniest stories and songs.
It brings so much joy to our life.
Her little Grandma stories.
Which could be like a TV series I think of
just your stories of
being a little Grandma.
We love our Laura.
What do you love about Laura?
-  Laura I have some good news.
- What?
-  You now are old enough to get
two vitamins everyday.
(cheers)
She has been waiting and
waiting for this moment
because the instructions
say that you only get
one vitamin if you're
two or three years old,
but if you're four years old, you get two.
- Vitamin dance.
-  Vitamin dance,
do the vitamin dance.
-  What do we do after breakfast?
- Open my presents.
(upbeat music)
-  Are you ready?
-  Who's first
to give Laura a present?
Nana-banana.

Yes, my own band aids.
- When you give someone a
gift, but you actually want it.
(laughter)
(upbeat music)
- My own earrings.
- We're gonna be matching.
-  If you wanna stand up,
you can look in the mirror
once she gets it on.
-  Oh, it's so sparkly.
- Pull on this.
You're own gum and this is lip gloss.
- Yay!
Thank you.

testing out the lip gloss.
(upbeat music)
- Did you wrap this one?
- Yeah.
You throw the ball back and forth.
It catches on this.
- Thank you!

for your next present?
Why do you look like you're 18?
-  It's the lip
gloss and the earrings.
-  There you go,
this one's from Granny Jo.
(upbeat music)
- I've always wanted one of these.
It's a mermaid dress.
-  It's a mermaid tail blanket.
Watch, you put your legs in there.
Now you're a little mermaid.
You can snuggle up on the couch.
Watch, see how cozy it is.
- And sleep?
-  Sure, you can sleep in that.

disappear inside of that thing.
(laughter)

whipped cream on there.
-  That looks so yummy.

A fun part of birthdays is
playing with all the new toys.

(indiscernible singing)
-  Did you build a tent?
- Yeah.
-  Awesome.
-  There's a lot of giggling
coming from inside this tent.
- We're playing ball.
- She's our teenager.
- So for lunch today we're having a bunch
of Laura favorites which
means it's a weird lunch.
We're having macaroni and
cheese, chips, apples,
a vegetable and a secret treat.
That looks like macaroni and cheese.
- Kind of a weird combination.
-  Mac and cheese, peas,
potato chips, strawberries and apples.
- Sprite?
-  That's right.
- Yum!
- So we almost never
do soda with the kids,
so she's very excited.
She was hoping to have some soda today.
(techno music)
-  This is quite the project.
- I was wrong.
- I'm just sitting here smiling.
- A ice cream cone.
(laughter)
- One more visitor coming
to stay with us tonight.
- He's waiting for us at the house.
