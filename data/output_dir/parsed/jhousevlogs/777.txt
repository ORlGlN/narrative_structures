- All right, I just gassed up.
And we are hitting the
road, heading to Denver.
I am the appointed
night-driver in our family,
and I get a little loopy,
but I get the job done.
So, I'll see you guys in
the morning in Denver.
(pop music)
I slept like an hour, maybe,
'cause I had to pee so
bad, I couldn't sleep!
Okay, so here's the thing,
is I just rolled down the windows,
and I'm taking pictures,
and I'm like, Jeremy, people
say Kansas is not pretty,
but look at this, this is gorgeous,
and he's like, Kendra, we're in Colorado.
I'm like, o-o-oh, fail!
It was dark the whole
time I was in Kansas.
I have nothing to say
about Kansas, it was dark.
The directions were easy, go straight.
(soft rock music)
Even little Laura's doin' it!
-  Do it, Laura, whoo!
- All right, so our
first stop this morning
was here at City Park in downtown Denver.
Check out this view.
There's a playground and
some very friendly chipmunks.
And lots of geese and walking paths.
It's really pretty.
(classical music)
-  Whee-hee-hee!
(Jeremy laughing)
-  What?
- It's fun to ride on Dad.
-  Nice!
- So, Kendra saw that there was a big,
old Cathedral here in Denver,
and big Cathedrals always remind her
of her time that she spent in Europe,
so she wanted to come check it out.
(angelic chanting music)
- All right, so we are headed into the
Colorado State Capitol building.
We're excited to check it out.
We've heard that when you go inside,
you can climb up some steps,
and be literally a mile above sea level.
So, you can be a mile high
in the mile-high city.
Senate, have you ever heard of Senators?
Yeah, they're part of
the legislative branch
of the government.
Let's go look in there,
and see what's in there.
Isn't it beautiful?
- You know your kid has
been up most of the night
in a car not sleeping,
when you find them like this.
Come on Caleb, we're checking
out the Supreme Court.
Aren't you totally interested?
- I'm tired.
- We're all tired.
- All right, well we're
literally driving out of town.
The kids are already zonked in the car,
but I wanted to stop and drive by
16th Street Mall and just see what it is,
'cause I'd heard it
was a really cool spot.
When I saw it, I had to get out of the car
and look around,
so Jeremy's driving one loop
around while I check it out.
I love this!
What a cool street in
the middle of a downtown!
This place is awesome!
- Sometimes when Kendra has
only had an hour of sleep,
she busts into song, which just began,
and I told her she had to stop
so that we could share
it with you as well.
Okay, go ahead.
- And, go!
♫ A long, long time ago
♫ I can still remember
♫ Your daddy and I went
on an inner-tube date
♫ There were tubes in the water
♫ When we floated down
♫ We were with my family,
and it was a fun time
♫ And that's the end of
that sto-o-ry, my dears
I'm lovin' this drive.
There's so much cool stuff to see.
Better keep my eyes on the road.
Hey, guys, we're comin' up to a tunnel!
Do you guys want to hold your breath
during the tunnel with me?
Okay, ready, go.
(sighs)
(laughs)
- You go over the middle line here,
there's a bumpity-bump so
that it makes a loud noise.
- Even if you barely
touch the middle line.
-  Yeah, not like you're
being completely dangerous
or a bad driver.
- You have to understand,
it happens a few times
when you're driving for like, 12 hours,
and you're on roads where
there's like, nobody.
- Anyway, so every time she's done it,
Elise has come up with a name for it,
it's pretty funny.
(tire bumping noises)
What's that, Elise?
- A car fluffer.
- Car fluffer!
So, next time that happens,
know it's a car fluffer.
- Which, thankfully, Elise
did clarify, doesn't smell.
There's no smell associated with it.
-  There's my mom!
There she is!
She's bringin' us in.
-  The party is starting!
-  There they are!
You guys excited?
Go see 'em!
- I love you, muah.
Good to see, you.
(excited chatter)
- All right, so we're here,
and the party has officially begun.
We are hitting the trails,
and we're gonna go see Fish Creek Falls.
I think that's what it's called.
(techno music)
- What's your thoughts about it?
- I'm fun.
- Isn't it fun?
- No.
- We're gonna go to a water fall.
- No.
- No?
-  Where are we going, cubby?
- To the water fall!
- To the water fall!
You see it, Caleb, look!
(upbeat music)
He's doin' it, he's sittin'
in it, he's ridin' it.
(excited mumbling)
Are you in the water?
-  Isaac, did you climb up there?
Or did they put you up there?
- No, he climbed.
- Serious?
Are you a mountain goat?
All right, well we are
driving up the last windy road
on the way to the vacation house.
- Look how beautiful
this is, look at this!
- This is where we're staying!
Anyway, we are almost there.
All 35 of us are going to be staying
in the same house this week.
So it's gonna be an adventure, for sure.
We're gonna show you the front,
and come back tomorrow,
and we'll give you a whole house tour.
All right, so we are pulling up.
There's the lodge, whoo!
-  J-house out!
- J-house out, wa-ha!
(light techno music)
- Woo-hoo!
- Hello!
- J-House out!
-  We're Meg and Em,
and we're saying, J-house out!
-  Isaac, why do you think America
wanted to be independent from England?
- Because they have a different accent.
