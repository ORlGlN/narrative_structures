- Raspberry.
-  Alright Isaac,
what are you thankful for?
- I'm thankful for Thanksgiving.
- I'm thankful for that
I love my whole family.
- I'm thankful for the gimungous turkey.
- I'm thankful for dang it,
you stole mine, Thanksgiving.
Let's see,
gosh, I'm thankful for
our nice warm house.
It's cold out today.
- I am grateful for YouTube.
How cool is it that we get
to connect with our family
and friends and to meet
so many cool people.
(upbeat music)
- Okay, so usually I'm totally
prepared for the holidays.
Okay, totally might be a
little bit of an exaggeration.
But this year, I'm completely
unprepared for Thanksgiving.
I am headed in, it's the
night before Thanksgiving
at like six pm to the grocery store.
I know, kill me now right?
We're headed in and we
are going to hopefully
get everything we need for
our Thanksgiving feast.
We've gotten lucky, so far
they're had pretty much
everything that we've been looking for.
The pies are looking a bit meager.
I'm wanting to do some
bacon in my green beans
but I'm feeling kinda lazy.
So I saw this, look.
Fully cooked bacon.
It's just like on the shelf.
It's not in the refrigerator section,
it's not in the freezer section.
That just makes me nervous.
How can you just cook bacon
and put it in a box in a shelf?
I don't get it at all.
Yep, I think we've got everything we need.
I think we're ready to check out
and be ready for Thanksgiving.
And guys, guess what,
I'm actually vlogging in public.
I hate doing this,
so anyway.
Hopefully I'll get better at it.
We're having our date night
with Sam and Nia tonight.
- So exciting.
- It's truly exciting.
- Sam and Nia, and you
have to have some context
of how exciting this is for us.
When we first started vlogging,
we were about two weeks in.
And this was just, I guess.
- Two or three weeks in, I don't remember,
but we had about 150 subscribers
and one morning we woke up
and saw that Sam and
Nia had subscribed to us
and commented on our channel.
Sam and Nia subscribed to us.
We got the memo, we knew you
wanted to be our friends too.
And we've shown you some of the footage
of our kind of freak out moment
of like oh my gosh, Sam and Nia.
- But when I was editing
it, Kendra kept coming
and she's like, no that's too much.
- That's too much.
They're gonna think we're crazy.
We're going to show you a
little bit more of that footage.
- On our video where we talk about
how we secretly wanna be
friends with some vloggers,
we totally wanna be
friends with Sam and Nia.
They are so cool.
- Yeah, I love their videos.
- They are so cool, I can't
believe they subscribed to us.
- Let's see if any of the
comments are from them.
We're trying to figure out how
you respond to Sam and Nia.
It's hard 'cause you can't
really put all this into words.
(screams)
It just doesn't come out the same on text.
-  Too bad we can't do a
video response to Sam and Nia commenting.
(screams)
Thank you so much, we're so excited.
Let's be best buds.
- This is like if a really
pretty girl says hi to you
and you make way more out of it.
They say hi and it's like oh she likes me
and wants to be dating me.
And then you totally overreact.
Yeah, we're totally
embarrassing ourselves.
(laughter)
They are calling.
Hey.
- Yay.
- The phone was ringing, we're
getting ready to actually
talk with Sam and Nia for the first time.
What was going through your little
mind and heart?
- I think I'm just really grateful
that I had already Face
Timed with Nia before
and she and I have talked and texted.
So I actually was kind of
surprised that I didn't feel
uncomfortable or nervous.
It felt like oh look, there's my friend.
- Hi.
- I spend so much time
watching you right here.
It's crazy.
- Yeah, nice to finally meet you.
- It's good to meet you too.
- I like your earrings Kendra.
- Thanks, they're new.
- So it was neat for me to
get a chance to meet Sam.
He's totally down to earth.
It was fun that
he knows about our kids.
He asked about Caleb and
what Caleb was up to.
- I love that you guys jump straight to
talking about your zits.
- See that pimple?
- Oh yeah, it's looking better.
(laughter)
- It was like too big I couldn't pop it
no matter how hard I squeezed it.
Finally she was able to get it out.
- YouTube's kinda funny like that.
You can show up with no makeup done
or you can talk about your zits,
or heck maybe you can talk about your poo,
I don't really know, we
haven't gotten there yet.
But it feels like life's
an open book on YouTube.
- Do you guys wanna hear about my poo?
(laughter)
I was thinking about it, it's so funny
with building a relationship on YouTube,
like I actually know more about you
than any of my normal friends.
Because I see a good amount
of you every single day.
- You're quite the fan boy.
(laughter)
- Yeah,
I may have embarrassed
myself a couple times.
- This is the last round,
we're gonna win it right now.
- Yeah, we'll see.
- 14 to 17.
The topic is
workers that wear uniforms.
Ready go.
- Ring.
- Oh honey, that was way too fast.
- Hey, oh no, Kendra your list
is dismal.
- That was way too fast.
- Okay, I put police, fire, nurse.
- I did
nurse and police
so we got two.
- We got two, so we got the two we needed
but we didn't get the bonus points.
- Alright so where does
that put you guys at?
- That would put us at 16
so if you guys got three, then
you win the game.
- We did not.
(cheers)
- We have another chance.
We're still in it, yeah.
- And it's this one right
here, names of baby animals.
Names for baby animals.
- Names for baby animals?
Oh my gosh, there's no way.
- This is hard.
-  I got this, I'm good.
- Next time I wanna
play Scattergories Nia.
- Oh my gosh, I love that game.
-  Keep distracting her,
keep saying things to distract her.
Ring.
- Oh honey.
-  Oh my gosh, you're
actually thinking of names.
(laughter)
- Sam were you naming the animals?
- What were we looking for?
- Here's what I put
here, I put like kitten
and puppy and stuff like that.
I wanna hear each baby name.
I wanna hear this.
(laughter)
Well Happy Thanksgiving everybody.
Thanks for coming and watching
and checking out our family.
We would love for you to subscribe
and look at some of
our old favorite videos
if you wanna see what
our family's all about.
We'll see ya tomorrow.
J House out.
(epic music)
(knock at door)
- Oh, it's a surprise.
