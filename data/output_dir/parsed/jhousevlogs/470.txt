one you think it goes with and one at a
time you're going to go through and
we'll see who can pick the most right
you ready for the first one which M&M do
you think this is what does it taste
like to you chocolate and peanut butter
you think it's the peanut butter one
that's right Kaylee's here's your first
one peanut butter that's right to try to
keep it fair we're gonna put a blindfold
on yeah all right can you see anything
yeah I set it down right in front of you
kind of here to this edge thank you
peanut butter yep that's right
very caleb here's your next one
this is hard
the crispy one that's right
that is the crispy one it's crispy
and a little bit funny so what do you
think it is do you think it's the honey
nut or the crispy Hangul you're going
with honey nut sure no that is not right
it's crispy go taste chocolate the milk
chocolate nope that's not right this one
was the dark chocolate you were so close
no it's dark chocolate yeah
it was dark chocolate we decided to take
the blindfold off because it really was
a lot harder fries when he couldn't see
all the options on the table quantity
did I know if you know what it is what's
that Oh mom and yeah you're right that
is almond I love it Oh crunchy
that's called an almond M&M it's
probably too big for you it might be a
choking hazard so we're going to skip
that one
so what do you think's inside of it the
big kind of nut on it this time yep it's
the all-in-one good job
all right that's right tastes like the
normal but crunchy okay what do you
think was making that crunch I think
it's that one that is not right that's
the s'mores Krispy one this one was the
pretzel pretzel yeah it is pretzel good
job you're doing really good
that's right
here you go that's an original what do
you think you all done yeah
this really does check them out
yep you're right it's just a
milk-chocolate me that one was not men
that was just the original milk
chocolate one right there that's okay
that is not correct
this is s'mores flavored one right there

that one good job good job you guys
crispy but it had a little taste like it
was sweet
