-  Laura wants
to try out the blanket.
(giggles)
(upbeat music)
-  I'll be back in a few days.
- Nobody makes Play Doh but God does.
-  Oh, he does?
- They are best friends.
-  You guys are gonna
be on the five o'clock news?
- Uh-huh!
- Yes!
(upbeat music)
- Well, today, I fly out
to California for a YouTube conference.
And everyone else is staying behind
so I'm saying goodbye to them
as they're getting ready to head off
to their homeschool
enrichment program today.
(gentle music)
- Done, there you go.
-  Thanks.
-  Thanks for
helping her out, Elise.
- Uh-huh.
-  Good morning.
I think she's ready for a nap.
Go get them, Nae Nae.
(gentle music)
(slow violin music)
- I'm making up a song.
-  All right, let's hear it.
(gentle piano music)
What you working on, Elise?
- Something for you.
(Jeremy gasps)
It says, "Dear Dad, I love you.
"And I hope
"you have a good time.
"I wish you good things, love Elise."
- That's so sweet.
Come here.
I love you.
I'm gonna miss you.
-  Me too.
- I'm gonna miss you too, Dad.
- I'm gonna miss you too, Laura.
(gentle music)
- This is you, Dad.
-  You drawing me?
- Uh-huh.
-  I love you, Daddy.
-  I love you too.
You drawing me, Laura?
-  Uh-huh.
-  Make sure to
draw the smiley face.
(gentle piano music)
-  You're doing awesome!
Okay, you guys, it's about time to go.
- Okay.
- I gotta say goodbye to you.
Hugs.
-  Bye, Dad.
-  From the bugs.
I love you guys.
-  I love you too.
- I'll be back in a few days.
You be good to Mom, okay?
What's this, Laura?
-  It's me and you.
-  You finished it?
-  Yeah.
-  Is that me on an airplane?
- Nope.
(record scratches)
This is a bed.
And that is a boat.
-  A boat.
So, what does it say, Laura?
I love it, thank you.
Come here, oh, I love you.
- How are you, baby girl?
Oh, doing some yoga this morning?
(Janae babbles)
Hi, hi.
(chuckles) Hi.
With the big kids all
at school this morning,
I'm hanging out with Janae.
And I'm also working on
some of the sewing projects.
As I've been sewing for the first time,
in a really long time.
It's been a good reminder to me
about perfectionism and perspective.
When you're up close
on your sewing project,
everything looks uneven.
Like, "Oh, I made this stitch
a little bit sideways."
Or, "Oh, I didn't iron this crease right."
Or, "Oh, I didn't cut it quite square."
But when you hold it up and away from you,
it looks like a beautiful blanket.
And I need that reminder so often in life.
Like, up close, when
I'm looking so closely
at like my kids' behavior
or my marriage or my house,
I'm like (groans), or my body.
Like, it's like (groans).
"I don't know if I like what I see."
But when I back up and you
look at it from further away,
then you can see the beauty
and the whole picture more completely.
Anyway, that's what I'm thinking
while I'm sewing this morning.
And hanging out with this cutie.
(Janae squeals)
(squeals) Hi.
Oh, we love you Nae Nae bug.
And here's Laura's
blanket, it's almost done.
(uplifting music)
This blanket is almost done.
I'm going to save the rest of it
to finish up with Laura this afternoon.
That was quite the shriek, little girl.
Janae is starting to learn to squeal.
And there's somebody at the door.
Okay, the doorbell was my
online grocery shopping.
And I think I say this every
week when our groceries come.
But it's because I love it so much.
I just can't contain
my excitement about it.
Online grocery shopping
is the best thing ever.
And so are poopy diapers,
which I think she has a poopy diaper.
Let's go change her.
Shall we finish up your blanket together?
How was preschool today?
- Great, I got my own Play Doh.
-  Show us your Play Doh.
You own Play Doh, what
color did you choose?
- Pink!
-  And what did you
learn about in preschool?
- Well, I learned about--
I just learned about--
-  Are you getting your papers?
- Shapes!
-  You learned about shapes?
Oh, what's your favorite shape?
- This one is the pink one.
-  Yeah and what is it?
- Heart!
-  And what is this in your hands?
- Play Doh.
-  Did you make it?
- No, nobody makes Play Doh but God does.
-  Oh, he does?
Are you sure about that?
- Yes!
- So, silly Laura is going to help me
finish up her blanket right now.
And she had to put the Play Doh
right next to us so it'd be safe.
So, there's the Play Doh.
Shall we finish this?
Yep-a-dee-dep!
(gentle music)
- All we have to do is vacuum it.
-  Now we just have to vacuum it?
- (giggles) Yeah.
-  It's already done,
Laura, it's all finished.
- Oh, can I lay it down?
-  Here, why don't
you lay it down on the carpet?
Did you make it?
- Yep.
It was kind of easy.
-  It was kind of easy?
-  Yeah.
-  There it is,
you made this blanket.
- Yep!
-  Is it a big kid size?
- Yeah, I think so.
-  Are you happy with it?
- Yes.
-  Look, it's pink and black.
Laura wants to try out the blanket.
(giggles)
Ready, set, (gasps) there.
- (laughs) So cozy.
-  Do you like it?
- Yeah!
-  You did a great job.
Shall we give this to a little friend?
- Yeah, today.
- Today, I wish we could today.
Okay, this is hilarious.
This is a little behind the
scene moments into our life.
It is currently nine minutes
until Jeremy needs to
leave on an airplane.
He is downstairs in the office,
is sitting there in his underwear,
with shaving cream on his face
because he still needs
to shave and shower.
His bag is not packed.
His laptop bag is not packed up.
And yeah, nine minutes.
So, I'm trying to hurry
and pack the bag for him.
And he's got to shower.
This guy, he lives life
so much to the fullest.
And he's always trying to pack so much in
that sometimes his life
is full to overflowing.
Well, he's amazing.
10 minutes later, here he is.
All ready to go, his bag is packed.
Can you smile for me?
- I'm not quite all
the way ready (laughs).
- Okay, all right, well, he's headed off.
He's going to be gone for a few days
and we're gonna miss him.
- Tell the kids I love
them and I love you.
- See you soon.
- See you.
- Fly safe.
(gentle music)
All right, well, Jeremy
made it off to his flight.
And I came to pick up the kids from school
so I'm sitting here in the car line
and I'm kind of enjoying it right now.
Just slowly moving forward.
But with the rain and
the windshield wipers,
it's just kind of cozy in here.
It also helps that the little girls
are both napping so it's quiet.
I was just realizing that
it won't be quiet for long
because I'm picking up
all three of the big kids.
And I know it's gonna
feel like an explosion.
They'll open the door,
and their backpacks,
and their lunch boxes.
And they're be excited to
tell me all about their day.
And I'm excited to hear about it.
But the contrast is interesting.
Like, the quiet of the car.
And then, the kids.
(gentle music)
(rain tapping)
- We were the last in class!
-  I know, I was running late.
(Kendra laughs)
- I have really good information for you.
- I have good information.
-  Oh, my goodness.
- Somebody on the news, he came.
And he's talking at five o'clock tonight.
And telling everybody that he came here.
-  What?
- There's gonna be a picture of us.
- On channel nine.
-  On the five o'clock news?
You guys are gonna be on
the five o'clock news?
- Uh-huh!
- Yes!
-  Whoa.
- On channel nine.
-  Whoa.
- Yes.
-  Was it like an assembly?
- Yes.
- Yeah, it was Brian Buzby from weather.
- So, I'm just going through security.
I'm remembering the time that
I left my laptop at security.
That was embarrassing.
(gentle music)
So, I don't know if I said this.
But my brother, Brent, is
actually going with us, as well.
We're going to VidSummit
for a couple days.
I'm excited.
(upbeat music)
So, we're waiting for our shuttle.
It's beautiful weather here in California.
(upbeat music)
(gentle music)
- They are best friends.
Today, Bitsy--
- Well, we had an awesome afternoon.
After school, the kids and I
went over to a friend's house
and we hung out there all afternoon.
It was so nice 'cause I
got to talk to my friend
and the kids all got to
play with their friends.
Anyway, we had dinner with them.
And now, it's bedtime.
See you guys tomorrow,
J House out, good night.
-  No (laughs)!
-  Is your room really messy?
-  You gonna give it
to little kids who need blankets?
(Jeremy laughs)
(kids cheer)
