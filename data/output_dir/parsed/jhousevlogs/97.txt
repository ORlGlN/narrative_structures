- It's just raining a little.
- He must be getting soaked.
Poor guy!
- So weird!
You can see the ribs.
-  This is Kendra
on a walk in Seattle.
Hi!
Oh, this is so cute!
-  Michael got
his Rambo knife out.
(giggling)
- Wow, pretty cool, huh?
(upbeat music)
(upbeat cheerful music)
- It's just raining a little.
Not too much to not go
kayaking in the morning.
It's funny too because of the time change,
it's a lot earlier here.
(upbeat cheerful music)
We were nervous that, with
it being rainy all the time,
we weren't going to be
able to get out here much,
but even with the rain,
this is still beautiful
'cuz there's no lightning,
so I don't think I'm going
to get struck by lightning
or electrocuted, but it's
just really peaceful out here.
Listen to the noises.
(water lapping)
(rain sprinkling)
- So, Jeremy went out on
the kayak this morning.
He was taking the first turn
and then I was going next
and I'm in my bedroom getting ready
and I hear that sound.
I'm like, what's that sound?
Oh, that's rain.
It is coming down out there.
He must be getting soaked.
Poor guy!
I can't even see him.
He is going to be drenched.
There he is.
I just spotted him
coming around the corner.
- 6th avenue, so we're pretty excited.
-  You guys watching the parade?
- Yeah.
- Poll question, on Thanksgiving
do you watch the parade?
(light sweet music)
- We'll make a model of the
Pilgrim village at Plymouth,
Massachusets, celebrating
the first Thanksgiving.
She sounded excited.
We'll make the houses and
the church here in school.
Good morning and happy Thanksgiving.
Today, I'm going to be
really honest with you guys,
has not gone the way I had hoped.
I had this picture in
my mind of how I wanted
the morning of Thanksgiving to go.
This is my favorite holiday,
so I was really looking forward
to some stuff and, basically,
nothing went the way
that I wanted it to and,
instead of rolling with it
and having a great attitude
and choosing gratitude
and flexibility instead of
anxiety and frustration,
yeah, I didn't.
I got frustrated.
We headed over to my brother's house
and on the drive, I
apologized to the kids.
We read a really sweet book about
the meaning behind Thanksgiving.
So, I'm ready to restart
and have a great day.
So, I failed to bring a rain coat,
so I'm just going into hibernation mode.
-  This is Kendra
on a walk in Seattle.
- When we left, it wasn't raining,
but we're in Seattle,
so now it is raining.
So, we're on a walk an they're all smart.
It's just me, I'm silly.
-  So, grandmom
and granddad are having
their 60th anniversary on December.
- The kids are making
cards for my mom's parents.
Lily, this is some beautiful artwork.
You're doing great.
These are fun.
(upbeat Christmas jazz music)
That looks beautiful.
Good job, Jemma.
So, it's lunchtime and we're all eating
all sorts of stuff.
I am making a grilled chicken quesadilla,
but it got me thinking, poll question,
what time do you eat Thanksgiving
dinner with your family?
We do it as a dinnertime thing.
I know some people do their
Thanksgiving feast at lunchtime.
We're more of a dinnertime crew.
- This is fun.
- All right, don't beat up the bag.
- So, my mom and dad are
teaching us how to make a turkey,
'cuz, honestly, I have no idea.
-  The sink is super clean.
-  Push downward
on the center of the clam.

- Laura was singing very, very loud inside
and so, we told her that the front porch
was a stage and she could
sing all she wanted down here.
-  We've been
thawing it for three days.
(upbeat jazz music)
-  We can only get
so much of putting vegetables
into the but.
(upbeat jazz music)
- So weird.
You can see the ribs.
It's like I'm inside of a body.
-  You are.
So, what did you think
of preparing the turkey?
- Kinda gross.
-  Yeah, but
it's going to be yummy.
- I signed up for mashed potatoes.
-  You wanted to help uncle Mike.
- You are going to get the
potatoes out of the bag
and then, you're going to get this rag wet
and scrub the dirt off
because, like papa was saying,
they grow potatoes in the dirt,
so they're covered in dirt.
So, first, we need to
clean all the potatoes.
(upbeat sweet music)
-  It looks like
you're scrubbing pretty good.
-  No, we don't want
any of that dirt on there.
-  With the perfect form.
-  Don't know about that.
So, the trick to peeling a potato
is to keep your hands and fingers,
see, all of your fingers,
below where this is going.
There you go.
- Good job, Caleb.
I cut my finger last
year with doing potatoes.
- Yeah.
I nicked my this morning.
- One time I scraped a potato
and I didn't get bleeded.
- Way to go.
You didn't get bleeded.
Can I get a high five for that?
Nice.
(sweet guitar melody)
He's doing pretty well at it.
- He is doing
pretty well at it.
(sweet guitar melody)
- So, up to my room,
my cousins, they flew.
The played with my toys
and computer games too.
All were assembled except or uncle Norm.
That's how much my father says it's worth
to give to the--
- Laura and I are going to do stuffing.
We're in charge.
Ready? We need four of them.
Ready?
- One.
Two.
Three.
I can't-- four!
-  You can.
Okay, let's go that way.
- You've got 'em.
- Let's go.
It's like, the yummiest.
We do Stove Top.
- That's it?
-  That's it.
-  The turkeys are roasting,
the house is smelling good.
Grandma's blanching the asparagus.
Woo!
- So, what happens is,
when you push this knob,
to this number up, it starts mixing.
The farther you go up, the faster it goes.
Put it in there and mix
it around like that.
(giggling)
Wow, pretty cool, huh?
- The house is nice and quiet right now
because a bunch of kids are
outside playing Frisbee,
but Grandma and a bunch
of the girls are making--
What is this?
- Turkey vegetable plate.
- Veggie tray.
-  A turkey veggie tray?
- Uh huh.
- How do you make
a turkey veggie tray?
This is like art with food.
- I know.
It's my dream come true.
-  I thought he was
sticking up his head like that.
-  It could work either way.
-  Turkey head.
Oh, this is so cute!
Look at that turkey.
Whoa!
- Guys, I'm it!
And, I'm it.
- Who's the thrower this time?
(upbeat banjo music)
- It's not raining now,
so the boys are out
playing Frisbee with uncle Mike.
You would think that you
could go on a walk right now,
maybe without a rain jacket.
You'd probably be wrong.
Woo!
Did you catch that with your head?
- Right in the head.
- So, this is my brother's back yard.
How cool is that?
The hustle and bustle in
the kitchen is increasing.
- It's getting really stressful in here,
so I'm gonna just
continue sitting here.
-  You're just
gonna continue sitting?
You're watching the baby.
- I am watching a baby right now.
-  There you go,
that counts for points.
Five points for you.
- Don't eat the cars, baby.
-  Hi.
(sweet playful piano melody)
It's like she smiles on demand.
-  Yeah.
- Hi.
(baby babbling)
We all took our places,
the food smelled so great.
Hey, Nay!
And dancing and art.
Nay's coming through.
Hi.
Hi.
Do you wanna come see the pretty book?
Thank you for dress-up,
red shoes, and big hats.

We're down to the last
minute of preparations.
There's a crew in the
kitchen, a crew setting up
the seating area, and my sister and I
are in charge of the kids,
keeping them out of the
way and entertained.
Folding chairs.
Lots of folding chairs.
Very nice.
Seriously?
The double table?
That's impressive.
So, my sister, Tiffany, just
flew in last night from Africa.
She's been there for, like,
two weeks or something
and so, she's showing the
kids some of the pictures
and video from her trip.
- These tigers are five months old.
-  That's Tiffany petting a tiger.
-  A white tiger.
-  That's crazy.
- And before, she petted a cheetah.
-  Really?
- Now, do you see what happens next?
What does my face look
like in this picture?
I'm, like, super surprised.
Look.
One of the tigers jumped
on my friend's back.
It was playing.
It was a nice tiger.
- That's creepy.
- It was totally
right on top of her.
I was like, oh, my gosh.
Having fun with my friend.
-  Michael got
his Rambo knife out.
- One of my camping knives.
-  I love it.
(triumphant cinematic music)
- This is delicious.
-  Oh, it is good.
-  Like, showstopping good.
-  Cranberry salsa.
- It rips your taste buds.
-  Melanie added
corn to the dinner for me
because I love corn.
- I also love corn.
- Good. It's so good.
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
for me without corn.
- Hi.
- I am Thankful for what's in this room.
I'm also thankful for the food,
but mostly for you all.
You are everything in my life.
(Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by J.S. Bach)
-  Who made these
mashed potatoes, Caleb?
- Aren't they so much mashed?
- Caleb mashed them.
- They're mashed so good.
It's Jenae's first Thanksgiving.
She's having little yogurt bites.
She's not impressed.
- Dish duty.
It's a thing.
Thanksgiving dinner is done,
which means it's officially
the Christmas season around here.
The kids are snuggled up,
watching a Christmas movie
and I'm warming up the pies
and we're gonna eat dessert,
which is, let's be honest,
the best part of Thanksgiving.
- The pie almost--
What is this?
-  That's a hot mitt for the oven.
- It's too big for me.
-  It is too big for you.
How many pies are we getting?
- We're getting three.
-  Three.
I will manage the oven and you
can help eat the pies, okay?
-  What kind was this one?
- This one's chocolate pecan
and that little piece
fell off in my mouth.
Oopsy.
-  Are you serious?
- Oopsy.
It was already cracking.
Come on.
-  Is this an apple berry?
-  This is apple Marion berry.
-  Which is
like a Washington thing.
- It's a specialty.
(exciting orchestral Christmas music)
I'm trying a bunch of things.
Chocolate cream, chocolate pecan,
apple Marion berry.
- I'm holding the baby.
Good night.
J-House, out.
(screaming)
-  Caleb's helping me paddle.
(giggling)
I'm a little bit nervous.
The graceful dismount.
(laughing)
- I got all dough-y.
-  Whoa, that's a pretty big one.
(upbeat music)
