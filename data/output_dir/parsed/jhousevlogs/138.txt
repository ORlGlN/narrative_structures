-  What did you find Janae?
- Ha ha ha ha.
(clapping)
(bright music)
(cheering)
-  Cubby, what's ya makin'?
- I'm trying to make
like a secret passageway.
-  That's pretty cool.
Oh did you make a train track?
- I made this one.
I made seven eight nine 10, 11, 12 14, 15.
(clattering)
- Stop!
-  Oh no.
Nae Nae did you get it?
She just wants to play you guys.
- Yeah, we can put it back.
- I guess that's a baby play.
-  It is.
- Destroy.
-  So the kids are
ready to build a new one,
so letting Janae knock it over.
And of course, now she's not interested.
(clattering)
(laughing)
She's like, what was that?
(squealing)
- Got you.
I got you.
-  Good job Elise.
Elise, you're doing awesome.
What game are you playing?
- Infection.
-  Infection?
-  And I just got tagged.
-  Alright.
- Now Elise is it.
Count to five with your eyes closed.
- One two three four five.
-  Laura, you're it with Elise.
Go get the boys.
- I'm gonna go this way.
-  Get 'em.
(uptempo suspenseful music)
(yelling)
Oh got him in the face (laughs).
Okay, now all of you guys
have to go get Isaac.
Laura get him!
Get Isaac!
Oh, he got you.
Okay, Isaac's it.
(sweet music)
-  What do you think of that, huh?
What did you find Janae?
What did you find?
We just read this book.
It's called If It Rains Pancakes.
It was so good.
So it was about haiku and lantern poems
and so the kids are now
going to compose their own haiku poems.
Okay, how many syllables do you need?
- Five on the top, seven in the middle,
five on the top.
-  You mean five on the bottom.
Alright, what are you gonna
write your haiku poem about?
- Sports probably.
-  What are you
gonna write yours about?
- I have no idea.
- Football time.
Football time
(clapping)
is fun.
That's five.
-  That is five.
- Now I need seven.
-  Okay Isaac, let's hear it.
- Inflatable dinos for Isaac on Halloween.
They seriously are.
- So Especially Fana see.
-  That's amazing, good job.
- Football, ha ha ha ha ha.
(Kendra laughing)
- So I almost didn't ask Caleb
to write a haiku,
because I'm like, he's in kindergarten.
He totally nailed this, I am so impressed.
Let's hear it dude.
- Football time is fun,
especially Fana,
see football ha ha ha ha.
(Kendra laughing)
-  I love it, that is so clever.
- When I have fun, it makes me scream.
-  That's a great intro.
- Isaac is awesome.
No, he's super awesome.
Oops, need to add words.
(Kendra laughs)
- I love you Mom.
You're so silly.
And I love you so much,
I love my whole family.
Even I love Janae.
-  Yay, that's a great poem.
So since I was asking the kids
to try writing haiku poems today,
I figured I better try it,
and it's actually harder than it looks.
So here's my challenge for you today.
I would love for you to
write us a haiku poem
in the comments below.
Go for it, give it a
try, it'll be awesome.
Alright, here is my haiku poem.
Autumn.
Sunshine rays outside.
Warms up my heart inside,
like hot apple cider.
We've always been big fans of the library.
Elise is having tutoring sessions
for her dyslexia twice
a week at the library,
so now I feel like we kind
of live at the library,
which is not a bad thing.
(chill guitar music)
- Almost at chapter two.
- You have to tap 'em.
-  Oh is it a touch screen?
- The dinosaur
-  Hey girl.
So I just dropped the camera
as we were loading
everything into the van.
I hope it still works.
I can't really tell,
because it's so bright out.
We've had this camera for a long time,
especially for how much we use it.
I think it's almost time for a new camera.
It's been dropped so many times.
So when we were at the
parade the other day,
we got a bunch of flyers and coupons
for different businesses,
and one of them was this coupon
and it is a coupon for a free cookie
from this cookie store,
and I am not one to let a coupon
for a free cookie go to waste.
I will use it.
Do you guys want to go get a cookie?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  Oh oh,
can you help me out buddy?
Let me see.
Oh my goodness, these
all look so delicious.
(bright clapping music)
- A lemon, same as Isaac.
-  Are you gonna do a lemon?
- Uh-huh.
-  Okay.
Laura, what do you think?
- It's good, I love it.
-  It's good?
Yum.
how do you like lemon?
- It's really good.
-  Yeah?
So we're sitting here admiring
all of these cookie designs
and talking about which ones we would want
for our birthdays.
Elise wants this one.
The boys both like the soccer ball.
I'm a big fan of this one.
-  What do you
think Dad would like?
-  What do you
think Dad would choose?
- I think he'll like, happy birthday Dego.
-  Diego?
Well we could change it so
it said happy birthday Dad.
- Yeah.
(bright music)
- Alright poll question,
which one of these cookies
would you choose as
decorated for your birthday.
So this is Janae's current favorite toy.
She likes to shut all of the little doors
and then we take turns going
around and opening them.
(laughing)
I started filming and Caleb leans over
and he whispers to me,
Mommy, you're not recording.
And he was totally right.
The camera was on, but I
had not pressed record.
So anyway, Cubby came up to me
and asked me to play
some card games with him,
so we played our favorite math game,
which is addition to 10.
And then we played speed, which
- She crushed me.
- I did, unfortunately it's
my absolute favorite game.
Now what do you want us to play?
- War.
- War.
So we'll see.
- And now we can play chess.
- And checkers.
- You want to play chess and checkers?
Is this a game day?
- Yeah!
- I guess so.
- So Chiefs' stadium has the world record
as the loudest stadium in the world.
And it gets loud there.
(crowd roaring)
(beating)
In the news, we hear
about so many tragedies
and terrible things going on,
with earthquakes, natural
disasters, shootings.
What I love about sports is that
it can bring a whole community
together to be united,
chant together, to sing together,
to have fun together.
We were clapping hands and celebrating
with complete strangers.
It's a really beautiful thing.
- They're on the half yard line.
-  We're about to score.
- Yep.
(funky beat music)
(cheering)
If we make this field goal,
we win the game.
(cheering)
(dramatic music)
yeah!
Woo!
Yeah!
-  Good night, J House out.
-  How should
we take the fire sticks?
- Maybe I should hold them on the drive?
-  Are you cheering
for the other team?
Uh-oh.
-  Hey.
(laughing)
Oh, they scored!
