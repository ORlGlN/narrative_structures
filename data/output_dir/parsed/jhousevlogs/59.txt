- Hi Ballengers!
- I lost my tooth!
(giggles)
- What's a koala?
-  I just thought
I'd go for a roll.
(laughter)
- It's a panda!
(playful instrumental)
-  What is going on?
(laughter)
(upbeat instrumental)
- We're making scrambled eggs.
-  Are you my helper?
- Yep.
-  Wanna get a bowl?
(light tapping)
(playful upbeat instrumental)
(gasps)
(crack)
- Dad remember we walked on eggs
and you cracked them?
-  I do remember walking on eggs,
that was crazy.
(chuckles)
-  Oop!
Oh no!
(laughter)
(squeals and cheering)
- This is fun.
-  Cooking is super fun.
He didn't get any shells in there.
Try to keep it in the bowl, okay Laura?
We're gonna add some peppers.
- I'm gonna soon be learning
how to bake this myself.
Looks pretty good right now.
- So we have big plans this morning,
we're headed to the San Diego Zoo,
and I wanna make sure the
kids have a hearty breakfast
so they're not hungry right away.
(upbeat instrumental)
Well I felt silly packing my blender,
but I've used it every day
and been so grateful to have it here.
Another day, another smoothie.
(upbeat instrumental)
- So we've been having this
sourdough bread for toast,
and poll question, do
you like sourdough bread?
Kendra and I love it,
how bout you guys, who likes the toast?
- It's okay.
-  Okay.
- I don't like it that
much, but, it's fine.
-  Thanks for eating it anyway.
- Yeah.
- I like it.
(light guitar instrumental)
- Now let's find more rocks!
Cause we have to find good white rocks.
(clanking)
We're gonna wash them
so they're not dirty.
- Let's take em back.
It's really important for
us when we go somewhere
that the kids can still
have creative play.
-  So Elise what are you doing?
- Um, I'm doing my piano practice.
-  Um, on an iPad?
- Yeah.
-  How does that work?
- There's songs that I can do.
I'm at level three,
and I'm trying to get it
to the very next thing.
-  Ooo, kay,
show us how you do one.
(rhythmic piano)
Piano practice on
vacation without a piano.
The kids piano teacher
has this special app
and she gives them assignments through it,
and so the kids are able to do this.
So we're driving to
the San Diego Zoo today
and Isaac just noticed the
coolest thing about our car.
Check it out, it not only
shows us the directions
of where we're driving,
but it shows us the speed limit.
For a long time I've said that
that would be an obvious
thing to put on an app
that would be really helpful,
and they've done it, thank you Apple.
- Cause when you're in a new place,
you don't know what the
speed limit is all the time,
so here it is, right in front of us.
-  It just changed.
- It did, it just changed,
so now the speed limits 45!
I love cool inventions like that,
they make life easier,
especially when you're traveling
and in new places.
(upbeat instrumental)
So we're looking for a parking spot
and we drove past this
car, and the trunk's open
so we were assuming people were around it,
we just kept driving
and then I looked back
and there's no people
anywhere around the car.
So it's one of those situations like,
I don't know what to do,
but it's kind of drizzling,
I think we're gonna shut the trunk.
- Yeah.
- Cause I would feel bad
if they left it open.
I mean it looks like it
was left open on accident.
- I would typically do that too,
the only nervousness is,
they were like, left it open on purpose,
they just went to go grab something,
and then we locked them in,
but the chances of that.
- Who leaves their trunk open on purpose?
- The chances of it, us
messing something us,
are much lower than us
helping them out, so.
- Okay, we're gonna do it.
(rhythmic upbeat instrumental)
- So all my life I've heard
about the San Diego Zoo,
it's kind of a world famous place,
and you guys are gonna
come check it out with us.
I'm so curious what makes it so special.
- We'll see.
- I think there'll be animal there.
(chuckles)
(kids chattering)
(giggling)
(playful instrumental music)
- So I think this is
Janae's first time at a zoo.
-  Hi!
Animals!
(giggles)
Oop, little nervous.
Hi, hi orangutans,
you guys, look, this
one's just rolling along.
Look!
I just thought I'd go for a roll.
(giggling)
Some people go for a stroll,
he's going for a roll.
- I share a birthday with
one of the orangutans.
-  You and Karen
are birthday buddies.
- I'm a little older, look these two,
have been a couple since 1987,
they have seven kids together.
-  Aww, that's so cool!
(playful instrumental music)
So Karen is the orangutan
that shares a birthday
with Kendra.
Apparently she had open heart surgery
and is the first orangutan
to have ever had that.
- Two years ago.
-  She's the rolling around.
- Yeah, she's the on rolling around.
-  Hi Karen.
Isaac is an orangutan.
- Yeah.
-  Basically.
Little kisses, they're
sharing food, how adorable.
Oop, never mind.
- Daddy, dad, look at that bird!
(elegant classical instrumental)
So we're at a part of the zoo
where the birds just roam freely.
- Last time we were in a bird cage,
a bird landed on my head.
-  Yeah.
(chuckles)
- And I was freaked out.
(birds squawking)
(Laura squeals)
(elegant classical instrumental)
-  That was the coolest thing.
Do you see the birds?
- Do you see the birds?
Tweet, tweet.
(elegant classical instrumental)
-  You guys, there's a hippo.
(kids chattering)
- They have the monkeys, the hippos,
and the ferrets in the same enclosure.
(giggling)
(kids chattering)
-  What is going on?
(kids giggling and chattering)
-  They sense danger
from Duncan.
Huh, what?
(chuckles)
She loves the fish!
So I thought I was gonna love the zoo
seeing all the animals,
but watching Janae,
thus far, has been the most
magical part of the zoo.
(gasps)
- Do you see the fish?
(Jeremy chuckles)
-  Fishies!
(playful instrumental music)
(kids chattering and giggling)
(kids chattering and giggling)
-  Laura!
(water splashing)
(playful instrumental)
Good job holding hands girls.
The elevator's broken.
- The bummer is we're gonna
have to go back out like that.
-  Uh oh.
Where are we headed next girls?
- To a restaurant.
-  To eat lunch.
What'd you find?
- Albert's Restaurant.
-  Let's do it.
(kids shouting)
- So the zoo had a place for
us to come eat some lunch.
(playful instrumental music)
(laughter)
And a bouncy baby.
(laughter)
- There you go!
(laughter)
- Janae has been having
so much fun with Duncan.
- How close in age, I mean,
it's like a month or two?
- I think it's like?
- It's two months.
-  Two months.
(playful instrumental)
So what happened?
- I lost my tooth.
-  Yeah.
- Right here, look.
It was this one.
-  Give us that smile.
- This is awesome.
Pretty soon she's gonna
have nothing to eat with.
-  So that one that's left,
that's a baby tooth, right?
- Yeah.
-  Is it wiggly?
- Kind of.
-  Soon you're gonna have nothing.
- It's wiggly, I have another lose tooth.
-  Kendra, there's an ant eater.
-  It's got such a pointy nose.
(kids chattering)
- Are they endangered?
-  They're endangered means
that there's not many of them left.
- Aww.
-  Yeah.
- Does that mean some of them died?
-  Mhmm some of them died.
- So on the ride to the zoo this morning,
we looked at the zoo
map and we made a plan
and we said, we're gonna go to
the polar bears first thing,
we just arrived at the polar bears,
it's like three o'clock.
(playful guitar instrumental)
- Ooo, that duck is trying to dive.
(laughter)
-  Two, three!
-  There they are!
-  Hey Laura,
do you wanna know what
you're gonna see next?
- What?
-  Reindeer!
(playful instrumental music)
(kids chattering)
(playful instrumental music)
-  Hey, can he get us?
-  He can't, see he's in a cage.
-  Say hi!
Aww.
(playful instrumental music)
(people chattering)
-  Isaac what is it?
- It's a panda!
(magical instrumental music)
(magical instrumental music)
- It's funny on this trip
because out of no where,
suddenly the conga line, happens again,
and it just keep happening
over and over again.
- Happening in height and age order?
-  Yeah, they're
perfectly lined up.
- They're very organized.
-  Uh oh, there's a break off.
- Falling apart!
We did not do anything!
-  No coaching.
- This was not like a
parent involved moment.
This was completely them.
- It just happens.
We're going on a potty run.
- Freeze tag, I'm it!
(yell)
-  Run Caleb, run!
(kids giggling and screaming)
Poor Janae has not napped at all,
she's liking the animals
and she's being a good sport about it,
but, I can tell she's getting tired.
It's hard being the youngest baby, huh?
-  We went to the bathroom!
-  Success!
- Had to be down the hill
and then up the hill.
-  Good workout!
- Whoo!
(kids chattering)
- What's a koala?
-  A koala bear?
It's these fluffy bears that
climb in trees and sleep
and they're little.
(upbeat drum jazz music)
(kids chattering)
(kids chattering)
-  So what's been
your favorite part of the zoo so far?
- I don't know, I like all of it.
-  I thought losing
your tooth was pretty cool.
- Yeah.
-  Caleb did you
have a favorite animal
we've seen so far?
- Leopard.
-  The leopard?
- I liked when the koala was on the back
and I also liked the, um, the leopards.
-  Should we do the zip line?
- Yeah!
-  The sky safari?
(playful guitar instrumental)
- What is this crazy fast!
(chuckles)
-  We're going up!
Are we up in the air?
-  Yes.
-  There they are,
up there, the Ballengers.
-  Hi Ballengers!
- So we decided to do the Skyfari.
This is so cool, there's mom!
And the girls!
Look at that airplane you guys.
(inspiring upbeat instrumental)
(inspiring upbeat instrumental)
Laura you're so brave!
- We did it!
-  Good job big girl.
What did you think?
- I liked it.
- So we're trying to go
on the Skysafari again,
and Laura doesn't wanna go with Jeremy
and I was talking to her about it,
like why, and why don't
you wanna go with Daddy?
- Because I'm afraid.
- She's worried that
Jeremy's gonna break it.
-  Why!
- Because you're so heavy.
(chuckling)
- Because I'm so heavy.
I'm so heavy I'm gonna break the skyfari.
- It's beautiful.
You can see all, from everything.
(pop upbeat instrumental)
-  It's Parker and Caleb!
(pop upbeat instrumental)
- The kids are fascinated,
they've never seen a
caricature being drawn before,
and they've been watching
the whole process
from the beginning, it's really cool.
- If he drew me, my
teeth would look crazy.
-  You're right,
let's see that grin again.
- Well I think we're done at the zoo.
The kids had a fun time,
and, we're gonna head home.
-  So Caleb and Parker
are putting on some sort of
a gymnastics routine here.
(cheering)
-  Yay!
(cheering)
Good job!
Well I think we successfully
tired the kids out.
I know we successfully tired me out.
So it's home to dinner and bed time.
Good night, J House out.
Well we love our rental house
but we are having one issue with it.
- So we're at a museum
with the Ballengers.
(upbeat techno instrumental)
(crash)
(squeal)
-  What the?
(upbeat techno instrumental)
(squeal)
(upbeat techno instrumental)
