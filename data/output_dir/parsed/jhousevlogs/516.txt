this is insane there was a tornado that
touched it and he first coming in like
take shelter like all the bathrooms are
the shelter I will keep you safe don't
hold my hand
so that's the tornado so we're headed to
the airport but the tornado sirens are
going off so I don't really know Jeremie
up here to the left is the library can
we pull in there maybe when you're
driving you're supposed to take cover
okay let's uh play on the left there's
this is insane so we have the family all
in the library and they have everyone in
a shelter so Jeremy
dropped the kids and I off at the
library and we hurried in while Jeremy
went and parked the car and came in
himself and as we walked in there was a
library employee right at the front and
they said thank you for coming in like
take shelter like all the bathrooms or
the shelter there's about 20 people in
each of the bathrooms and little shaken
up about it
so by glad that the warning ended and
hopefully now we can make our flight on
time the sirens came back on so we're
going back in we checked them the flight
is still on time and they're planning to
take off but we're now facing the risk
that we might miss our flight would you
make good job so we just got news that
there was a tornado that touched down
not far from here and on our way to the
airport
so the sirens are off but it's raining
now and we have to try to load up the
kids to get to the airport you guys did
good running into the car we are still
under a tornado watch but the tornado
warning is over so we are venturing out
to the airport and
we don't really know what to do we don't
want to miss our flight so we want to
keep our families safe so we kind of
feel a little so it says that all the
flights are delayed except for ours as
ours
I'm so confused
you see these lower clouds moving really
fast and it's scary like is it going to
turn into a funnel cloud and suck our
family up
we found our terminal
no daddy found a terminal not a turtle
no no turtles just the terminal
we got to get the car seats and the kids
and the luggage
Japan
look we brought everything we own with
us where's Laura
hey girlie
apparently our airplane that was flying
in got diverted from landing here and it
went to Tulsa Oklahoma so we're waiting
for it to clear enough for it to come
from Tulsa here to pick us up and then
we'll go to Phoenix
good job everybody
under normal circumstances I would never
spend four dollars to rent a cart right
now anyway that was the best purchase
I've ever made
so our flight was supposed to fly out at
6:05 and I just updated the status that
no longer says on time and now says
10:30 departure Kendra is having a
really good attitude about this like
she's been super positive I'm angry that
they didn't update it to say that it was
delayed because we wouldn't have driven
to the airport if it didn't continue to
say on time when they already knew the
airplane wasn't going to get here so I'm
frustrated about that because I don't
want to sit here and try it anyway
I'm frustration but there's nothing we
can do about it surprise we'll just
party
I just want to complain about it a
little bit more but whenever I'm feeling
a little grumpy you guys always make me
feel better with your stories so let us
know in the comments below one of your
stories at an airport where things
didn't go as planned whoa they're just
motorcycle
all right so I bought a lot of different
kinds of gum for our trip because I know
it helps with like your ears when you're
on an airplane and so I have lots
different kinds but here's our poll
question for the day what brand of gum
is your favorite I really love Trident
for some reason I just like that brand I
like bubblicious and try why do you like
bubblicious it's like Nick and baseball
players use it so that by now so we have
three more hours to kill Jeremy is
napping and the kids are having a bubble
gum blowing contest bubble a bubble gum
bubble blowing contest I don't know how
to say that there we go
now is
what is the
boring damn here it is he stepped out
for a moment of fresh air and I wish
y'all a whole time for the airplane
