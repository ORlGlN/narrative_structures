-  Thank you.
(upbeat music)
- Well, I started the day by
waking up and throwing up.
I apparently am sick today.
Hopefully I can get better quickly,
and hopefully it's not the flu
because we don't want the
same thing to happen this year
that happened last year where
we were all sick on Christmas.
Quick flashback.
Merry Christmas.
- Well, Laura just threw up
all over the living room,
and I think that about
does us in for the day.
We are officially postponing Christmas.
The kids are bummed to not
be opening their presents,
but honestly they're all
just laying here listlessly.
So we were going to do Christmas tomorrow.
- Well, it's 24 hours later.
I was sick all day yesterday,
in bed the whole time.
I'm feeling a lot better today.
Kendra and I were sick yesterday.
It was miserable.
And what was sad was he
lost out on a lot of really
fun things we were going to do.
We were going to go and ring bells
and sing like we do every year.
(bells ringing)
And we missed out spending a whole day
playing with some friends.
We just had a lot of stuff planned,
and we've missed out on it.
So we're trying to salvage the day.
And again, hoping and
praying that our kids aren't
all sick on Christmas again.
So Isaac, how was it
yesterday with mom and dad
being sick?
- It wasn't that good.
We had to cancel a few things.
-  I heard that you
made dinner all by yourself.
- Yep.
-  And mom came in and
you guys had the food set up.
You had NaeNae all set up.
You guys were praying.
Caleb helped.
- Ready.
- On your mark.
- Set.
- Go.
(upbeat music)
- Three in a row.
Go.
(upbeat music)
- Yes!
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- So this was a Christmas present we got
last year or two years ago.
- Two years.
- Glad we busted it out.
This is so fun.
On your mark, get set, go.
- Are you allowed to take pieces off?
- There we go.
(upbeat music)
-  Thank you very much.
God bless you.
- I think it's a little
too small actually.
-  Free sample day!
- Here you go, sweetie.
Hang on to it.
Both hands.
- Going to try.
- I love eggnog.
-  We'll see.
Yeah.
- Okay.
- So with Kendra still
not feeling really well,
and with a potential of
our kids getting sick,
we're grabbing some things
that we really want.
Rolls, crackers, soup, Gatorade.
So let us know in the comments
what do you grab to eat
when you are feeling sick.
(upbeat music)
(baby talking)
(upbeat music)
- Oh.
-  Good try.
Nice.
- Well, Janae and I came
to check in on the family,
and it looks like the gingerbread
houses are going well.
- Okay, Laura.
Let's get it up again.
- Third try.
- We didn't have enough frosting.
- I think Laura's going to have the most.
-  You're super dad
doing this with these kiddos.
- Super bad?
(laughing)
-  No, I said super dad.
- Super bad.
- I meant super dad.
I meant super dad.
I meant it as a hero.
- All right.
I think that might stay up.
- It might.
- Might have got some frosting all over.
Okay.
Do you guys want to try it yourself?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
(upbeat music)
-  Is that part
almost falling off?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- Have you guys ever gone
and seen like an amazing
gingerbread structure?
We've seen one down at
like Union Station before.
And every time we try to build
our little houses at home,
I'm like more impressed
by the amazing gingerbread
creations that you see out there.
That's like some real talent.
(upbeat music)
- Caleb's was a little
bit broken in the box.
- Empty the packages good.
- We're just waiting for it to dry.
-  Awesome.
- Mine is standing up.
I'm just waiting for it to dry.
- It might fall, but --
-  It's kind of leaning.
It looks like the leaning.
- It's the Leaning Tower of Ginger.
- Yeah.
It always ends up, that one gets broken.
-  Next year NaeNae will need one.
Are you saying hi?
-  Hi.
-  Hello.
- So Jeremy and I have
decided that next year we want
to do the graham cracker version of these.
Oh my goodness.
You're going to try to
jump out of my hands.
(laughing)
-  Okay.
Put some candy up on it.
- There you go.
-  Is the roof starting to fall?
- My gingerbread house
one is starting to fall.
(upbeat music)
-  You guys done?
- This is my back door,
and this is my front door.
-  You guys did great.
(upbeat music)
So while I was sick, I
watched a three or four-hour
documentary on Walt Disney.
I'm nerdy like that.
And it was so fascinating.
What blew my mind the
most was that I think
his failures and the way
he responded to those
define him even more than the successes
that we normally think of.
He continued to get up, continued to fight
even when things went bad.
And a lot of things went wrong.
Like they -- he went
bankrupt more than once
and he had mental breakdowns
and he had to fight back
and keep reinventing
and refighting and coming
back with new things.
And so that's just been helpful for me
among my struggles or
my situations to realize
that my failures are going to come
and it should be expected
and that what I do with those
and how I respond to
those is what determines
what I have the opportunity
to be and to become.
Hi, dad, hi, dad.
- Do you see the Christmas tree?
Christmas tree.
-  Yeah!
(soft, light music)
- So Elise has her last
ballet class before Christmas.
(soft, light music)
So before bed, we are
going to give the kids
a chance to eat some of
their gingerbread house.
- I like how the frosting hardened.
♪ Born is the king of Israel ♪
- I love Christmas so much.
-  Yay!
- That's a good song.
♪ O come all ye faithful ♪
♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪
♪ O come ye O come ye to Bethlehem ♪
♪ How we do this right since
Jesus wants to be kind ♪
- That was beautiful.
- Thank you.
-  Your Christmas
carols are special.
(laughing)
- Hey, Laura.
Jesus is their baby boy.
- Oh, it's a --
- A daughter's a girl baby
and a son is a boy baby.
- Well.
- Jesus is a son.
- Oh.
- Well, we hope that you
all have a Merry Christmas.
- J House out.
This is actually a big deal.
We never shared our last name on the blog.
