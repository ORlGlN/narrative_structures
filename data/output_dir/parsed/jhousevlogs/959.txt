(upbeat music)
- Alright,
we're in Bret and Michelle's
basement on a Sunday.
This is my Mom, Granny Jo.
- Hello.
- Kendra was wanting you
to tell us some funny
something something from what is was like,
a story from raising me or
something about us growing up.
You got anything up your sleeve?
- Jeremy liked to really
kind of push my buttons
and so his punishment of course
was that we would put him
in the laundry room for time out.
We'd sit him up on top of
the washing machine or dryer
and he would kick and kick and kick
and kick the entire time he was there.
(laughing)
- I wanted to make sure
to make it a punishment
for everybody who was trying to punish me.
- And real often we would
get around the table,
be about ready to say
the blessing on the food
and Jeremy would go (spitting).
(laughing)
And we were just about ready
and then he'd go (spitting),
make everyone laugh.
So I said, "Okay, you do
that one more time, Jeremy,
"I'm gonna have to rip out your tongue."
- How old?
I was like five.
- You were two.
- Two?
- And have three.
Caleb's age.
- So Caleb.
- Yeah, Caleb's age.
- Okay.
- And so as soon as I said that of course
Jeremy goes (spitting)
and so I grabbed his mouth
and I tried to rip out his tongue,
but it really did not work
because he ran and he
ran faster than I did.
- I remember a lot of times
just trying to make my mom laugh
if she was trying to discipline me
(laughs)
that was a key of my survival
which is exactly what Caleb does.
It's really funny.
You guys are gettin' it goin'.
Oh, as soon as I show.
- Thanks a lot.
-  Sorry.
Sorry, as soon as I start filming.
Wow.
Okay, well we're gonna
have to get some doubles
going on in a second.
What?
(laughing)
That was amazing.
Well, thanks for telling a story, Mom.
That was awesome.
Elise, you have some pretty
awesome makeup on today.
She gave me a little kiss.
It was cute.
Kendra was like, "Who kissed you?"
And then Elise walked up with her makeup.
So we have some sad news though.
Our little baby Laura...
I'll take this ridiculous hat off.
Baby Laura is, she has
a temperature right now
and that's not fun.
- Hi.
- So she's just not herself.
I guess another significant thing.
It's our anniversary today.
- Yay.
- We were joking about our anniversary.
- It's actually our 10-year anniversary.
- Kind of a big deal.
- It is.
It's a huge deal,
but we celebrated it by let's see,
you were up in the night with
somebody that peed their bed.
- That was 3 a.m.
- And I was up with her and then--
- At 4 a.m.
- There was like some
tantrums on the way to church.
- Yeah.
- Anyway, there's family
in town which is super fun
and it was just a busy day regardless
and Laura's got a fever
so we're just really
not celebrating today.
It's an uneventful anniversary,
but we'll make up for it.
We'll do something fun another time.
- We're planning sometime
this summer, we hope.
- Hopefully, we would like
to do something bigger,
but really like this is real life.
- Yeah.
It's a little bit hard when
you have a baby who's nursing.
To go somewhere far is kinda difficult.
- Right now we're just dreaming
of like going out to dinner,
so hopefully we can do that
sometime soon, but not today.
- It was funny though.
We have other friends who
have their anniversary today
and one of 'em posted on
Facebook something like,
"It's been nine years of marriage
"and we still have never had a fight."
- And I think my response
was, "Oh, we can't post that."
- Then I was all technical.
I'm like, "Well, if we define
fight very differently,
"like a fight is like
shooting guns at each other,
"we've never had a fight."
- Oh, good.
Oh, good.
- Yeah.
- Earlier today, like this.
Do you see that little like
kiss mark on Jeremy's face?
I was like, "What happened?
"Where'd you get that kiss from?"
Have you seen Elise yet today?
- Yeah, yeah.
We showed 'em.
Her lips are so cute.
- That's what we're up to.
It's our 10th anniversary and she's sick
and we're hangin' with family.
- Have you guys seen this thing?
It is so fun.
So it's a big ball maze.
There's like a ball inside of it
and you try to go through the maze.
(child screams)
That sounded like Caleb.
It's funny hearing my
mom's stories about me.
It sounds so much like Caleb.
Caleb.
- We'll clean it up in a little while.
-  What's goin' on?
- He's just getting out, placing cups.
And Luke was trying to kind of clean up.
(singing)
- Uh oh.
Did Luke touch your--
- He's singing "Deck the Halls."
(singing)
He knows all the words.
- Don't do that.
- I'm just moving this.
- We think Caleb might be coming
down with a fever as well.
Either that or he has
permanent crankiness.
- Yeah.
But exciting.
We have a cake that we're doin'.
What kind of cake do we got goin' on?
- Lemon cake.
-  Lemon?
Oh, yummy.
- With lemon curd.
-  Lemon curd topping?
- With lemon curd in the middle
and then it's a cream cheese frosting.
- It's like a lemon meringue cake?
- Yes.
- So, it's lemon jello
cake with lemon curd
and then lemon cream cheese frosting.
I didn't make it.
- Wow.
We're good.
So this was our 10th anniversary special.
One take.
- We made this for you.
-  Thanks, for our anniversary?
- For your 10-year anniversary.
- Very good.
So,
there we have it.
- Happy anniversary.
-  Yeah, you want
to give us the J House out?
- I got nothin'.
-  Nothin'?
- I got nothin'.
-  Caleb,
Isaac, do you want to
give us our J House out?
- J House out.
-  That's pretty good.
Elise?
- J House out.
J House out.
-  With the lipstick.
Caleb, can you give us a J House out?
- J House out.
(laughing)
- We've trained them well.
- Yeah, okay, J House out.
(chattering)
- Peter trying to...
