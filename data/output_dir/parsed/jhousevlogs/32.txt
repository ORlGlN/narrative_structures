we say the things we love about Caleb
and we'd love to hear in the comments
what you love about Caleb.
- I love how much love Caleb has.
He loves with such passion and intensity,
he's a great snuggler and he's so kind
and he just really loves everyone
in our family.
- I love that he always
wants to play with us,
like hear about what we did.
- I love how fiercely
independent Caleb is.
Sometimes as a parent that means
he's getting into stuff or doing things,
but I know that as he
continues to grow up,
that independence is gonna lead to him
creating and doing some
amazing incredible stuff.
(Janae shouting)
- I love how Caleb brings so much joy.
Like if we're playing outside
and then he just figures out
something fun to do with us.
-  What do you love about Cubby?
(Janae babbling)
Yeah I love that too.
- What I love about Caleb?
He puts me to sleep when I was two.
-  And three.
- Yeah.
(gasps)

a root beer mustache.
(electronic music)
Okay Cub, what did you want to do?
- I wanted to go to a
movie at the theaters.
No one's here.
- We have the whole theater to ourselves.
(lively music)
It is always really fun when you have
the theater all to yourself,
so we got here just as
the previews are starting
and we're deciding where
to sit in an empty theater.
Poll question, what do you
prefer, the front, middle, back?
You can sit wherever you want.
Should we do the middle?
- No, I want to go by myself with Isaac.
(epic rousing music)
(stopwatch ticking)
-  Did you like the movie bud?
- Yeah.
- We're the only people in here.
-  Yeah.
(bright music)
Where are we going now Cub?
- To get my birthday cake.
Ice cream cake.
That looks good.
-  So the initial one,
they spelled his name Balb.
Happy birthday Balb.
(laughing)
But they're gonna make us another one.
You got skills.
- Thank you.
Is that better Caleb?
- Yeah.
-  Is that your name?
- Yep, that one's yours?
- Cool, we'll take it.
- So Caleb chose all of our meals today
and for dinner, he chose spaghetti
with corn and cheesy toast.
So it's been really fun
to celebrate Caleb today
and to think back on his fifth year.
It was a big year for him.
He learned how to ride a bike,
he learned how to read,
he learned how to tie his shoes,
he started kindergarten.
Oh, and rollerskating.
He learned to rollerskate.
Anyway, I'm just really proud of all
that he's learned this year
and especially the ways
that I've seen him progress
in his patience and his hard work
and his good attitude.
- And going to bed at night.
- And doing chores, and
going to bed at night.
I'm excited to see what year six brings
for this boy.
Gymnastics time.
(upbeat music)
Say gymnastics.
-  Gymnastics.
- Me and Nae Nae are gonna stay home,
everybody else is going to gymnastics.
-  Bye.
