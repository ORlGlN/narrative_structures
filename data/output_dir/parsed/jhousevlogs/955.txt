- Happy New Year!
Good morning.
This morning we decided
to start the new year
with new hair cuts for the boys.
It has been desperately needed.
So I'm going to cut
Caleb and Isaac's hair.
And Jeremy is going
into work this morning.
(bright music)
Let's take your shirt off.
- Why?
- So you don't get hair on it.
- And why my pants too?
- So you don't get hair all over 'em.
Okay, you sit right here.
(buzzing)
I know why is that not working.
Our clippers broke.
So I can't cut their hair this morning.
Dang it.
So I went into my bedroom to tell Jeremy,
who was getting ready for work,
that the clippers weren't working
and that I wasn't going to
be able to cut their hair.
And Elise comes running into me to tell me
that Caleb was cutting his own hair.
Here's some of his hair.
And Caleb what did you do?
Oh, there's a patch.
There's a patch out right there.
And it looks to be that there's
a patch out in the front.
Apparently Jeremy was
able to fix the clippers,
so we're going to resume as planned.
Seriously people, I'm really
hoping that this is not
an omen of how our
entire year is gonna go.
Because this morning,
hmm I'm not feelin' it.
(buzzing)
Now that his hair is shorter,
you can actually see the
spot where he cut it.
Do you see that?
I don't know what to do.
From far away, you can't really tell.
But up close,
there's definitely a little bald spot.
Should I just buzz it?
It is a two sucker sort of hair cut.
- Hello, camera.
(buzzing)
- I got two suckers, camera.
- So Isaac actually requested a buzz cut.
(buzzing)
- Whoa!
-  Wow! That's a lot of hair.
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I,
J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S
-  Are you guys all
eating right by each other?
- Mmm hmm.
-  Silly gooses.
Well Mom's over here
having some awesomeness.
What is this?
- This is the best salad ever.
I'm pretty excited about it.
So there's
lettuce, broccoli, sweet peas, carrots,
sweet maple turkey,
smoked Gouda, which is
one of my favorites.
Did I say that right?
Anyway, and cashews and walnuts.
-  Yum.
- With a raspberry walnut
vinaigrette dressing.
Happy New Year right?
- Leftover Chinese food,
it's one of the few foods that I like
better the second time around.
Mmm, so good.
- Alright, so I came
up to my office, today.
I wanted to review
kind of my work load and what happened
this last year at work.
And think about what I'm
wanting for the next year.
And just organizing myself.
That's always an important
thing for me to stay,
to come up and make sure
that I feel organized
on each of my cases,
for each of my clients.
And it's hard to do that
on a normal working day.
It's nice to just spend some
time just focusing on that.
So, I'm glad to have a couple
hours up here for that today.
Alright, so I just got home
and the kids are screaming
about something they built.
I am not used to bald children.
-  We built something.
-  Did you guys build something?
What is it?
- It's a rocket ship or something.
-  Okay, so what do
you got going on in here?
What are the cups for?
-  They're the buttons.
-  These are the buttons.
- And I have those.
-  Wow!
- And can we show you how
we do it?
-  Let's see it.
Oh, it's like a bobsled.
-  That's exactly what I thought.
- But, for real.
- So Isaac was telling me
that this is going to be
the very first ever by
kids built electric powered
thing a majig.
And so they got all this done
and then he looked at me and he said,
they got all this done, then
he looked at me and said,
"Mom, now we just need to
figure out electricity."
-  K, we got to
get this thing powered.
- So we just have to use those.
-  Oh, if we can just plug it in.
Okay, we'll figure that out.
(laughing)
-  We to turn on this.
- But they took this box
and they completely unassembled it
and then they colored it
and they put up those cups
and then they reassembled it like this.
All I did was hand them tape.
This is...
-  Their creation.
- Yep.
-  We found a good babysitter.
- Yay!
It's date night.
- We're going to go on a little date.
That was one of our
goals for the new year.
So we're rockin' it.
- Yes!
- Have fun.
Caleb, don't destroy anything
while we're gone, okay?
He's done a lot of damage to this house
in the past, so.
Okay, we're here at 54th Street Grill.
And one of the hard things
about grills like this
is there's a TV back there,
and it's showing the best
baseball highlights of the year.
Then there's one over there
and it's showing the NFL top highlights.
Then there's this TV,
and it's showing a bowl game.
And I'm supposed to be
paying attention to this.
- It's date night, come on.
- And she's like talking
about all this important stuff
and I'm just like.
It's hard.
- He does alright at it though.
I'm so excited to be on a date.
Like it's been a while
since Laura's been having
a hard time with babysitters,
we haven't been able to get out much,
so I'm like really excited to be kid free.
- Yeah, I gotta get back
to focusing on Kendra now.
Kendra just had a helpful idea,
that we just switch seats.
There's no TV's on that side, so.
There we go, much easier.
- So I ordered a steak and steamed veggies
and garlic bread.
We did like a three
course meal for two deal.
Where we got an appetizer
and two meals and a chocolate cake.
-  So we had to get it to go.
- But I had to sneak a bite
because it's my favorite,
but we need to go get our kids.
- Yeah, we're hoping that
the ice cream doesn't melt
because it's so cold outside.
It's like 20 degrees out there.
- It'll be fine.
-  Let's do it.
We're back to our bald boys.
Laura,
can you wave?
Can you wave?
-  Nope, nothin'.
- When we first came in,
she gave us a big.
-  There we go.
Hi, hi.
- Alright, so date night went well.
It was so nice to be able to talk.
We have so much to plan
and our dreams for 2015
and it was just really
nice to be able to connect.
And the kids did great
with their babysitters.
And we have an extra child in the back.
Where is she?
Ah, there she is.
Hi, Allie.
- Hey.
-  What are you doing?
- Going for a sleepover.
- Yeah, a good start to what's gonna
hopefully be a wonderful year.
So, J House out.
Good night.
- Can everybody say J House out?
- J House out, good night!
