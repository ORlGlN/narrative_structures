so the big kids get to do something fun
today they are going to like a kid's
camp this morning and they got to pack
lunches which is a big deal on their
hanging out with friends who's excited
okay you guys have fun bye-bye
yeah you sure can bye buddy so I decided
to come up to Zona Rosa which is an
outdoor shopping place that's in the
north side of Kansas City and I rarely
come up here like maybe once or twice a
year at the most
but Old Navy is here and I think there
was maurices and a charming Charlie's
which I really enjoyed so I think I'm
gonna hit up a few of those places but
it's a cute spot okay so it's 9:45 I
totally thought stores would be open
apparently the stores don't open until
10:00 so I think I'm actually going to
go on a walk check this out I just ran
into a book exchange here it's just
filled with books like you can just kick
out a book probably drop off a book
tumble with that we did he say hi
hi are you gonna play with mommy today
yeah you are teasing mommy mommy the
only problem with this is she's gonna be
done with the stroller before I've even
started shopping and I know I just told
you guys again yesterday that I hate
shopping which I do hate shopping but
it's necessary evil and I need a few
things so got it good
people I bought several things and
what's exciting is I didn't realize how
big the sale was in the ringing updates
I'm like oh that's different that that's
different than I thought I always love
surprise hit that like that's awesome
that way for lunch and watching one
child play in a baby play area this is
like am on vacation today tonight was
the first night we showed our kids The
Incredibles what do you think of it
Isaac is probably maybe my favorite
movie net

babies had powers what if we had powers

have the same as the big sis like when
she disappears Oh Ethan Rayne oh my -

superpower what would it be screeching
yeah stretchy guys ready I don't know
that's a deep question you know my gut
response has always been flying just
because I didn't going to be awesome to
fly but I'm sure there's probably a
better answer than that somewhere
