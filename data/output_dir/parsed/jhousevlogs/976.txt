("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)
- Our four little kids
have been sick this week
and we decided to capture these
special memories in a song.
♫ On the sick days of Christmas,
my children gave to me
♫ 12 runs to the toilet
♫ Cleaned 11 chunks of vomit
♫ 10 hours of cartoons
♫ Nine-and-a-half Tylenol tablets
♫ Eight loads of laundry
♫ Seven crackers for dinner
♫ Six extra baths
♫ Five farts that were
actually poo in their pants
♫ Four sick kids
♫ Three throw-up bowls
♫ Two tired parents
♫ But one really really
stinkin' happy family
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!
- I hope your holidays have
been healthier than ours so far.
Goodnight!
- Night.
(cheerful music)
