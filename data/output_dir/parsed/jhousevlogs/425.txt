the water yeah we're going to go under
there's a tunnel right
so we were driving by and saw this
neighborhood and this is like a Kendra
paradise it's a bunch of old houses big
trees green everywhere
it's gorgeous we're just exploring every
house is different and unique and
beautiful this is so beautiful right
look at that stone house
so we decided to come to the st. Louis
Zoo it's actually free to get in here
and we're excited to see some of the
exhibits so the zoo is actually located
in Forest Park in st. Louis and Forest
Park is really interesting because it
was the location of the World Fair in
1904 and so I'm just loving the history
of the area and it's beautiful to have
this massive park in the middle of this
city I'm a sucker for anything
historical at all I just love it
ow
only actually going
the water yeah we're going to go under
there's a tunnel right here we're going
to go under the water
we got but we're gonna be in a tunnel
like we're gonna totally to dry we're
not gonna get wet but we're going to go
in it
bon soir father sorrows you know those
aren't dinosaurs those are sea lions are
they so it's pretty cool we showed up
here right when they were feeding the
sea lions and the seals they fed the
seals first another doing this you know
so we were just learning and they call
boy sea lions bowls and the girl sea
lions when the calms cows not
interesting definite you Isaac
they have to get good at hand room with
your mouth really did
what if we fed you all of your meals
just throwing it to your grocery hey
what I'm about to ask any question so
Kendra asked if we could ask some
questions from a zookeeper so she came
out and answering the kids questions
it's really funny
Isaac had a good question he wondered
what happened during a tornado how they
took care of the animals and it's really
interesting they open up a way where
they can go inside if they want or stay
out here if they want and they let them
choose is that a rooster leaf
and surely they don't chew alguno who is
who yeah some of them are bigger than
others some of them have darker fur than
others
so I think we've been out here at 20 or
30 minutes in the rain just asking
questions and we're learning so much I
asked a lot of questions about the
training process when they begin how
they teach them to do the different
things that they do and this is the kind
of learning that we love being out here
watching them and talking to the people
who know what they're talking about it's
really cool all right is the back and
inspired
a little bit
yummy more 200 know they both want it
there's more pockets
gonna do
so we've lived in Missouri for like six
years
and we still don't own an umbrella
thinking it's time to buy one one good
thing about coming to the zoo when it's
raining there's nobody here
so that's good and it's always
sprinkling al-salam but if we are gonna
get totally wet it's gonna be a long
drive home to Kansas City tonight it's
getting along Friday that way so they're
getting ready to feed the giraffes
they reach so

Crested wood partridge what is this bird
it's a peafowl alright Laura's in the
front Caleb's in the bottom
Jeremy's cushion we're ready to just
make it back to the car oh it's so
pretty well swing it does let's go okay
okay we actually initially came to st.
Louis to attend a hot air balloon
festival tonight and it is raining a lot
anywho so we are heading home and what's
interesting about today is pretty much
from sunup until now nothing has gone
the way we expected but it's been a
really fun day the kids are really good
sports even when we were out in the rain
and we had some dry clothes for them to
change into in the car and so now we are
hunkering down for the drive back to
Kansas City
