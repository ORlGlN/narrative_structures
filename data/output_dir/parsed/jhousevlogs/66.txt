- Some of our pipes are frozen.
-  Get him! (laughs)
-  Laura's
getting ready for the day.
(upbeat music)
- I'm making muffins.
-  What kinda muffins?
- Cinnamon.
-  That's a great
way to start a new year, huh?
What month is it today?
- January.
-  January,
what happens in January.
- I'm four.
-  (gasps) Not yet
though, you have to wait
until your birthday.
- Yeah.
- Good morning.
It is officially 2018 and
we are starting the day off
in a very, very cold Kansas City.
It is negative nine degrees out right now.
That's not even wind chill.
That's just the actual temperature.
So we were hoping to go out
and have a fun breakfast out.
But honestly we don't
wanna leave our house.
So, we are making cinnamon muffins.
Caleb is making cinnamon muffins.
Here they are.
(upbeat music)
Nice.
Bless you Miss Nae Nae.
Bless you.
(Jeremy taps rhythmically)
-  Kendra's making a smoothie.
- So we're having cinnamon muffins,
a smoothie and eggs.
-  I'm helping with the yogurt.
-  Sure.
There it is.
Yum.
- So Travis and Ashley brought
this game over, Pentago.
And we are loving it.
- No, it is not sponsored,
but it should be.
(laughing)
(happy music)
No Dad, I got five in a row.
- What?
He did it!
Five in a row.
Isaac wins it.
Five in a row.
This is like an epic tic tac toe game.
Isaac hasn't lost yet.
-  This game
messes with your mind.
Like it's just crazy.
-  Five in a row.
- Dang it.
-  Yay, he beat you.
- That's twice that he's
beat me with a diagonal.
- I know, but it's hard because he puts it
on three different squares.
I'm trying to make chores
a little bit more exciting this morning,
so I have papers with
chores written on them.
And the kids get to choose them.
Maybe that'll be more fun
than having them assigned,
I don't know.
But the chores have to get
done, so we're doing 'em.
Dun dun dun, dun dun dun, dun!
What'd you get?
- Bathroom!
- Whoo!
She gets to clean the bathroom.
- Yay!
- I want this one.
(laughs)
- What'd you get?
Laundry!
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I got like the hardest chore.
-  You can do it.
Hey, let's go do the laundry.
Ready, set, go!
I'm gonna race you to the washing machine.
On your mark.
Yes!
- Mine?
- Yeah.
- Just mine?
-  Yeah, your laundry hamper.
- Can we just do something?
-  Laura's
getting ready for the day.
- Perfect.
This is what I call perfect.
(playful music)
- Somebody's not feeling the new year.
We've got a fussy Gus today.
(upbeat music)
So we're starting off the new year
with some serious fun today.
There's a new trampoline park in the area
and so we're trying it out.
The kids are excited because
they get to jump on trampolines
and I'm excited because it's warm in here
and they can be active and having fun.
We're here with friends,
which makes everything better.
And seriously, how did
people live in cold climates
like 200 years ago?
I do not think I would survive.
I would be whining a lot.
(thumping rock music)
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Oh!
-  Jeremy's up on the jousting.
He's gonna go against, Caleb.
-  Ready, set, go!
(Kendra laughs)
(tense music)
-  Good job Lise!
Oh!
-  Oh, oh, get him.
(laughs)
Go for his legs.
Oh!
Good job.
(imitates tense music)
She's getting me.
No!
No!
Caleb with the helmet on.
Nice!
(upbeat music)
-  Jeremy and Elise
are racing some sort of race.
They're going.
- Oh, you won!
-  Uh oh.
Oh no!
-  Yeah!
-  Isaac is
getting Jeremy so good!
These two are so cute.
(Jeremy babbles)
She likes it.
She likes the trampoline.
- Whoo!
-  There's too many
kids here to put her down.
But she loves it.
- Yeah!
One, one.
-  Hey you.
- So we're gonna go.
We're heading to a movie
with all of our cousins.
-  And Granny Jo.
- And Granny Jo, my mom's in town.
- So this is a big deal
because our kids have actually
not gone to a movie theater.
Except for Isaac.
- Like Isaac's first one
was Wonder.
- Yeah, and our other
kids have never gone.
So this is a big deal.
I'm gonna stay home with her though,
she's not ready for it.
-  So how do you guys
feel about going to a movie?
-  Excited.
-  Excited.
- Hopefully we get the middle, middle.
-  Yeah.
Find theater 10 you guys.
Theater 10.
(bright music)
Alright, what'd you guys
think about the movie?
- I really liked it.
- It was good.
- It kind of made me cry.
-  Did you cry?
No spoiler alerts.
We won't say why.
- I didn't cry.
-  You didn't cry?
What'd you think about it?
- I didn't cry at all.
-  Did you like the movie?
- Yeah, I liked the movie.
- I loved the movie.
It was really good.
I think Wonder's a little bit better, but,
it's really good.
- What I loved about Coco was that idea
of chasing your dream and
the importance of family.
And the way that they put
those together in a unique way.
And so it was really good,
it was touching, good show.

-  Nae Nae found Ivy.
She's so happy.
-  Oh be soft.
Oh be so soft to Ivy.
She loves her.
Well, time to go.
- Go get her.
So my mom came out to visit from Arizona.
- Yay.
Hi Janae.
- Well unfortunately it is cold enough
that when we came home this evening,
some of our pipes are frozen.
At least this bathtub is.
The water will not drain.
So we poured a whole
buncha salt down there.
And we're hoping it will thaw out.
- Why is it not coming out?
- It's because the water
in that pipe right there,
is frozen.
So it's like a big ice cube so
the water can't get past it.
And if it does that too much,
then sometimes the pipes break.
- Ooo.
- Luckily our showers and
all of our other sinks
are all functioning.
It's just this one bathtub.
And this has happened
before a few years ago.
But last time, I sprinkled a
little bit of salt and wallah,
so this one's making me a
little bit more nervous.
Can you feel it?
(playfully pensive music)
What do you feel?
- I feel ice.
It can go all the way down there
and then everywhere else is ice.
- I know, it's solid ice down there.
I know some friends that
today are without water, so.
Poor Janae keeps crawling up
to the side of the bathtub
and crying and whining,
'cause she loves baths
and she wants to take a bath right now.
But I can't give her a bath right now.
Say good night.
Goodnight, J House out.
-  You might win the whole league.
- It's is cold princess?
Like how could we ever use this much salt?
Are you guys excited for our trip?
-  Yeah!
- We're gonna be there for a long time.
(kids yelling)
-  Happy New Year!
(upbeat music)
