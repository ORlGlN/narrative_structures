-  You guys want
to make giant Kisses?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
-  Alright, Caleb
has his treasure hunt
ready for us.
Make sure the violin is in the
van before slamming the door.
-  Happy
Valentine's Day, everybody.
- So today is Valentine's Day,
and nothing shows Kendra
love more than decluttering.
We're donating some more stuff,
and we're dropping off a bunch of boxes
that have been sitting in our garage.
Alright, lets unload the boxes.
(upbeat music)
Thanks for helping.
So Papa and Mugga are here
with us on Valentine's Day,
and they have a little
something-something for the kids.
-  Close your eyes everybody.
No peeking.
-  Lisey, don't peek.
- Okay, you can open 'em.
Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.
(children gasp)
- What?
-  Thank you.
(upbeat music)
-  One for you, Jeremy.
-  Sweet.
-  Is it coconut?
Oh, it is.
-  Wow.
-  The pink stuff is coconut.
- Mmm.
- This is Janae's first Valentine.
It says, "Janae, we love you.
"You have a great smile."
Oh, for me?
- You can open it later.
I went to a special class (mumbles)--
- Oh, that's so great.
-  Where we
learned to make, we made--
-  You made that?
-  Stamps.
- They gave us Valentine's
and wrote five things
that they love about us.
(upbeat music)
- So there's people that we know
that have been going through a hard time,
and we thought it'd be fun
to show them love today.
- So since today is Valentine's Day,
we are going to study the
human heart and how it works.
So what is the job of the heart?
- It pumps in and out blood.
- It makes owies bleed.
- It has to do with blood.
You're right.
Okay, so this is what the heart
looks like right here, okay?
-  It doesn't
really look like a heart.
- It looks different than
the shape that we draw
that's a heart, right?
Okay, everybody take your fist.
This is how big your heart is.
So put it right there.
That's where your heart is.
Every person's heart is about
the same size as their fist.
And then this is if you
cut the heart in half
so you could see the inside.
This is what the inside
of the heart looks like.
- I kinda see a heart right here.
-  Like a heart shape,
like loop, loop.
- Yeah.
- So here's the heart, and it
pumps fresh oxygenated blood
through all your body so that it can keep
all the organs healthy and strong.
And it does that through arteries.
-  And you can breathe.
- You breathe, so you
get oxygenated blood.
-  It's unbelievable.
- It really is.
So here's the heart muscle.
And remember, these are the arteries
that feed the heart itself.
If the heart doesn't get
oxygen, it can't pump.
And if it can't pump, what
happens to your whole body?
- It just stops.
- Stops getting fed.
- And the problem is the
heart can die very quickly
if it doesn't get blood.
There's three main arteries
that come into the heart.
You can't see the side one here.
And mine got blocked
right there on this side.
-  And Papa's actually scheduling
open heart surgery to get that fixed.
- How does the heart keep pumping
while it's out in open heart surgery?
-  So they have
machines that artificially do
what the heart and lungs
do to keep you alive,
and then you hook it back up to the heart.
- And I have actually
seen open heart surgery.
So I've actually seen that
machine when I was a nurse.
-  Yes, she fainted.
Just kidding.
(group laughs)
- Okay, so we're gonna
color these pictures
and label the different
parts of the heart.
- Kendra does such a
good job with the kids
where she'll have them
all doing one activity
but all at different levels
of their grade level.
(upbeat music)
-  So Laura finished up her heart.
But then I turn over the page
and discovered this drawing
which I have never seen
Laura draw like this before.
Did you draw that?
It was you?
No, Lisey drew it.
- No, I did!
-  You did?
It looks amazing.
I love the eyelashes that
you put on those people.
-  Thanks.
- And now, she wants to work
on this picture of the heart.
She did it.
Lisey, that looks awesome.
So two or three months ago,
my dad had a heart attack
and he went into emergency surgery
and had several stents
placed, but further evaluation
has shown that he has more
blockages going on in his heart.
And so we've just found out
that in two or three months,
he's going to be having another surgery.
And this time, it's gonna be an open heart
triple bypass surgery.
So we're learning about the heart
and learning about what we can
do to take care of our heart.
And hopefully, this
helps the kids understand
what's going on with Papa
when that time comes.
-  Laura, what are we gonna do?
- We're gonna put up the bird feeder.
-  The bird feeder.
We're trying to decide where to put it,
so we're testing different spots outside
to see where we can see it from inside.
Hi!
-  Nae-nae, there it is!
-  Hi, dad.
-  Okay.
-  Putting the birdseed in.
-  This is like
treats for the birds, guys.
- This side is filled the most.
-  So what's neat
about this bird feeder
is that it's set up that
if squirrels come on,
they can't get the seed.
- It's weighted for four
ounces, believe it or not.
The birds are under and out.
- So my parents actually
got this bird feeder for us
for Christmas, so it's
fun to get it put up.
-  There it is.
- There it is.
-  Come, birds!
- Birds, we have food for you!
- We have a free restaurant.
Come and get it.
- Now we gotta probably
sit back and be quiet
so we don't scare 'em.
So while we've been dealing with snow,
we have a couple of days
this week that are above
60 degrees, so we're
taking advantage of that.
Papa, pumping up the tires.
We haven't used the bikes for
a while with all the snow.
(upbeat music)
-  We are gearing
up to go on a walk,
and she won't keep her hat on.
You're gonna get cold, silly.
That was a big jump.
- One time, we went on a walk
and we came over here, and it was so fun.
-  Yeah, you love the rocks.
- I memorized it.
- It's a good memory.
So we're going on a walk.
My mom's from Arizona, so she's all cold.
- So cold!
- And I'm like, "It's nice out today."
But I did bundle Janae
because nice in Kansas City
this time of year is cold.
But she won't keep her hat on.
You're a happy girl.
While we're walking,
Papa is taking the big
kids for a bike ride.
And I love it.
I think they look so
cute riding their bikes.
I don't know why bike
riding is so cute to me,
but it just makes me smile.
Okay, what did I give you guys?
- Kisses.
-  Kisses.
-  What kind of Kisses are these?
-  Hershey's.
-  Yup, they are chocolate Kisses.
Do you guys know that when I
was a little girl, one time,
my mom, Mugga, made giant Kisses
for us for Valentine's Day?
Giant.
Do you guys wanna make giant Kisses?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  Giant ones?
- How big?
- But they would be rice crispy treats?
-  Yes!
We're gonna make it out of rice
crispies instead of Kisses,
but we're gonna make
it look just like this.
Do you think that's possible?
- Yeah!
You can shape 'em.
- This big?
-  We'll see.
- Can we eat it?
-  Once you have
both your rice crispy treats,
you can eat 'em.
Sound good?
Who wants to help me make it.
- Me.
- Me!
-  I really
particularly like your outfit,
by the way.
Elsa with the Minnie apron
is just working for you.
And the socks.
-  And the long stocking socks.
-  And the socks.
So first step is make rice crispy treats.
(upbeat music)
Okay, this way, it won't
stick to your hands.
There you go.
Good job.
-  Compact it so
that's tight and squishy.
- I might need a little more
because I'm pushing it out pretty good.
-  Oh, you mean
pack it in that much.
- Yeah, pack it all in.
I forgot to butter my own hands.
Oops.
-  Laura eats 50% of the time
she's making something.
(Mugga laughs)
It's like, "Sure, I'll help make it."
-  So now shape
that like a Hershey Kiss.
- While we're making these Kisses,
we have birds flying up
and using the bird feeder.
It's really fun.
- Now bring it up, and
now we bring this up.
So wrap it up to make it
look like this Kiss, okay?
-  Wanna go get the
next message and I'll help him?
-  Yeah, sure.
-  There we go.
-  So Kendra wrote
little notes to each of the kids.
-  And then you wrap it up.
Laura's Kiss keeps getting
littler and littler.
What keeps happening?
-  It's gonna end
up being a ball of tinfoil.
-  She's like, "What?
"Wasn't this the idea?"
-  Then hold it up here.
You gotta flip the thing up.
-  Now you get to eat.
- Let the feast begin!
- That's good.
-  It's like
the size of your head.
-  How'd you feel
about giving a Valentine?
- Good.
-  What'd you like about it?
- I liked that they were happy.
- Yeah, it's a fun thing to
show people we love them.
So I almost forgot that we
have gymnastics tonight.
And we're running out of time,
so we just decided to stop
at Chick-Fil-A and grab some
dinner before gymnastics.
You're it, Cubby.
- We have approximately 10
minutes before gymnastics.
So we're going to chow down
here and then go to gymnastics.
Actually, just kidding.
We can make this a totally
romantic five-minute date night.
The kids are gonna eat here,
and Jeremy and I are gonna eat over here.
Yes, that's how it's done.
- We were like changing in the car.
We were like five to 10 minutes late.
(upbeat music)
So since we've been home from gymnastics,
the kids are all making
treasure hunts for each other.
Is this yours, Laura?
(gasps) Is that the first note?
- Do you know how to read scribbles?
-  Yeah, of course.
- It says it's in here.
-  That's what it says?
-  This.
-  (gasps) There is candy.
-  No, you don't get to eat it.
It's for Caleb.
Just to show you.
-  Oh, that was
a good treasure hunt.
-  I get to do
it for everybody else,
so I have to hide it.
-  Okay.
Alright, Caleb has his
treasure hunt ready for us.
What's the first clue?
- The first clue is on
the side of the table
where I did my, made my treasure hunt.
-  Go look for it.
- (gasps) Is it taped?
Whoa!
In the cupboard?
- Yeah.
Not in it, it's on it.
- (gasps) Right there!
Where I watch football.
-  Watch football.
-  Laura, say
where me and Isaac sleep.
- Where me and Isaac sleep.
-  Let's go!
- On the bookcase.
-  Over here on the bookcase?
-  No, not that bookcase.
-  Oh, the other bookcase.
- I found it.
Where I snuggle with--
-  Dad.
- Dad.
- Where Laura strolls her babies.
-  In the basement!
It's a great treasure hunt, Caleb.
- Candy!
- There's a lot of pieces.
- Six pieces.
- Nae-Nae's excited.
- What's fun about these treasure hunts
is the kids worked on
them for like 45 minutes.
- I love that this was the kids' idea.
They worked really hard on it.
And treasure hunts are
actually hard to coordinate.
I'm impressed.
Good job, Caleb.
-  Good work.
Alright, go get your 'jamas on.
(upbeat music)
How was violin?
- Good.
- (laughs) Make sure
the violin is in the van
before slamming the door.
Open the door, and close the door.
Nailed it.
(Isaac chuckles)
Before going to bed, Elise made us
this adorable little Valentine.
And she was cute.
She wanted to see us kiss,
(chuckles) which was really funny.
It was reminding me too
of a couple of years ago,
I invited you to help me
share a Valentine with Kendra
of writing down things
you loved about her.
Then I posted it all over our room
because we got so many amazing
loving things from you.
I invited you to send emails with things
you love about Kendra, and
the response was overwhelming.
I got so many responses.
I thought it would be
really fun to help Kendra
see how much she's loved.
(Kendra gasps)
Each paper is an individual
letter from a viewer
about what they love about you.
- Guys, this is so overwhelmingly amazing!
Valentine's Day is a fun day
to celebrate with the kids
and as a family, but Jeremy
and I also wanna make sure
that we take time to celebrate together.
So we're actually gonna
do that another day.
We have a babysitter lined
up and gifts for each other,
and we're going to do a
little Valentine's date night
that's special just for
us 'cause it's important
to celebrate the love of the whole family,
but it's also really important
to take care of our marriage.
Well, Jeremy and I actually
have a playlist, I think,
on our channel of our love story--
- That's true.
- Where you get to hear about
how we met, our first date.
There's some, you know, disagreement
on what our first date actually was.
And then our first kiss.
- Our first kiss.
- So if you're interested
in hearing more about that,
you can check out that playlist.
And for now, we're gonna go to bed.
- Good night.
- J House out.
- Thank you.
(upbeat rock music)
Yeah!
No one's here!
