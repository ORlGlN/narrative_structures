ready for the day
yes growing and if you can smell it it's
starting to smell like random there's a
certain smell that comes from the heat
when it grows okay now I can tell that
it's just about to the right point where
I really don't want to put too much more
flour in otherwise it makes the dough
too I really in any get up okay so we
have the bread rising but it's time for
another dance break
so I'm getting ready in the morning I
wanted to listen to a book on tape that
I had bought a long time ago it's
actually on a cassette tape
please continue listening on side two I
did dig out a cassette tape player out
of the closet and it's so weird to use
it it's been a long time since I've used
a cassette tape so a poll question when
is the last time you used an actual
cassette tape to listen to music or
something it's still rewinding thanks
forever we become so spoiled with our
technology an immediate response and as
a kid we didn't have cell phones we
listened to everything on cassette tape
all of our cars had cassette tape
players your body of your panel ready
because that's actually going to be your
frosting for the federal and so will
Kenny house normalize you can butter and
your brown sugar like this you guys
remember where the dough was before we
took it off okay
it was down really low huh

but I'm going to actually have you put a
little bit of butter on me just like
you're watching your knees exactly but
you don't wash your hands with butter I
did when he did good boy
between your age now I'm gonna let
everybody be one punch in case we're
going to go from oldest to youngest okay
