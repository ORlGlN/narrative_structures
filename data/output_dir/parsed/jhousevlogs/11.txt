-  What?
-  Yeah! This is so cool!
- Coming for you!
He's making a baby gate.
(pleasant music)
Since Livy knows how
to do this by herself,
I can do it all by myself now.
- I'm teaching Laura the alphabet.
N, give me N.
(Laura laughs)
-  Thanks for
helping her out, buddy.
- Yeah.

Number 9, speedily.
Number 10, angrily.
(Isaac growls)
And you write it angrily.
Number 11 is happily.
Now can you write it happily?
Bigger smile, bigger smile!
-  What are you working on, Elise?
- I'm finished, Science.
-  Very good.
So we decided to take
the kids on a hike today.
It's starting to warm up, and that sounded
like a fun activity.
(upbeat banjo music)
What's this?
-  It's a cave.
One more if it's safe.
Isn't it so cool?
-  (gasps) Oh!
-  Can you walk
on the balance beam?
Ooh.
-  Hi!
This is our house.
- How did they build this?
-  Do you remember when we built
a thing like this at Papa's cabin?
-  Mm-hmm.
- Wee!
Hi!
Two, three, go!
Wee!
(Laura giggles)
-  I'm making an obstacle course.
- Brilliant.
So the Santa Fe Trail and the Oregon Trail
actually run right through this park.
- There's some ruins at
the park of some cabins
that were built right along
the trail at that time.
-  It was a fireplace.
- A real one from a long, long time ago?
-  From a long time ago.
-  How did they keep it so long?
-  It was the
only thing that lasted.
There used to be a whole cabin here.
-  Look how big it is.
-  Look, I'm in a fireplace.
- Hiking in Missouri in the winter
is not as pretty as the
other times of year,
but you don't have to deal
with any bugs, so that's nice.
-  Looks like there's
water coming from that cave.
-  What?
-  Yeah! This is so cool!
-  I wanna come!
Wow, cool cave.
-  Can you guys see me?
-  They're right here.
-  Oh my goodness!
- Hi, Mom!
-  Hi, guys!
-  He climbed out of the cave.
- (giggles) Yay! I succeptisul...
How do you say it?
Okay.
-  Successfully?
- Successfully did it.
-  Good job.
-  I wanna do it again!
(bright music)
- We're abandoning the
stroller for a minute,
because we want to go more off-road.
(bright music)
- I heard there was gonna be bears here.
There wasn't, and I'm really hot.
-  No bears. You hot?
- And thirsty.
-  And thirsty?
Happens when you go hiking.
-  So Laura, why did you think
there was going to be bears here?
- I don't know, I thought
there was gonna be
really bad things here.
- I love this place a lot.
-  Why do you love it?
- I think it's really fun.
I liked the cave and the
playground was awesome.
- So apparently, the trail we're walking
is a big circle, and it's leading us
back to the front of the park.
So we have to go back and get our stroller
that has our car keys.
Oops.
Let's head back up to the starting point!
- I'm digging for gold.
-  I think
we're in the wrong state
to find gold, buddy.
- Where do you find the gold?
-  Where do you think?
- California.
- That's where the gold rush was.
So some of the adventures that we go on
turn out to be way better
than I think they're gonna be,
and some of them turn out a little lamer,
and, uh, this might be
one of those days today.
I don't know if it's just
that it's not, you know,
the gorgeous summertime,
but we're ready to go home.
- There must be a lot of
gas going through this.
-  There is a lot of gas going in.
-  Cool!
(Laura laughs)
- Coming for you!
-  Caleb's trying
rollerblading for the first time.
-  Go, go into them!
Rollerblade in them.
- Well, the weather is amazing today,
I've got all the windows open
so I can feel the breeze,
and all the kids are
outside except for Janae,
and she was standing at the kitchen door
and she kept pounding on the door,
like she just wanted to go outside so bad.
So I brought her outside,
and it made me realize
that the deck right now
is not baby friendly.
So I need to change that so
when we go into springtime,
Janae and I can both be
outside, and be happy,
and safe, and watch the kids.
I think I want to put a
baby gate up right here,
that would be first step.
And then I want to do something different
with this area, rather
than this super classy
free table that we picked
up a few years ago.
But I can't decide if we should
make this an eating area,
like with an outdoor table and chairs,
or if we should make it
an outdoor sitting area,
with like, couches and a rug.
So let me know which one
you think would work better.
Ideally, I would love
to have both outside,
but we just don't have
enough space on this deck,
and the patio is used
for more important things
like basketball, and
rollerblading, and sidewalk chalk.
-  The trampoline
is like a giant baby gate.
- And she loves it!
-  She does.
Is that dog, doggie? Ruff, ruff.
She grunts when she's signing dog.
- Everything's so kind of
dead and dry right now.
I hope we get some more moisture.
It'll be nice to see everything
come alive in the spring.
Lisey's making an ice cream cone.
And Laura, are you writing your name?
- Mm-hmm.
-  This is the
winner, we're doing 8 to 9.
(funky music)
-  Yeah!
-  Isaac, you won?
- Yeah, 10 to 9.
-  Good game.
-  Very nice.
Way to school your dad.
(Isaac softly laughs)
So I'm trying to increase
how many vegetables
we get in our diet, and so
I'm making spaghetti tonight,
and I'm gonna have some regular noodles,
but I'm also going to
be using some of these.
They're called veggie
spirals, so we're gonna eat
spaghetti sauce on top of that.
-  This smells so good.
- It's just sauteed onions,
mushrooms, garlic, and spinach.
- So I'm on day four of the cleanse.
I haven't eaten anything but the salad
that I get one day a week.
And today, one day,
each, I'm losing my mind.
But this smells so good,
and I've been like,
craving food all day.
So I have one more day
left and then I'll be done.
- You can do it.
-  I can do it.
-  So this is,
I'm just kind of making
like a homemade spaghetti sauce.
-  Yeah, looks amazing.
- We're making a baby gate.
-  Ooh, is this
gonna keep Nae-Nae safe?
-  Yep.
-  And I'm holding it.
-  Are you gonna have to be here
forever to keep her safe?
- Yeah.
-  No, I'm gonna get
a different piece of wood
so that can rest and tape that back,
and then I'm gonna have to
tape those two together.
-  How's it going?
- Good. Our baby gate's actually working.
- We don't want her to get out here.
-  Yeah, you don't want
Janae to be able to get out?
- But then, once she's
older, I'll take it apart.
-  Do you think
she could fit under there?
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
-  You're a little
bit worried about that part?
- I think Nae-Nae might be strong enough
to just (imitates crashing sound).
-  We could test it out.
- No, not yet, once it's all the way done.
-  Okay.
- So this is my dinner,
it's zucchini noodles
with all the veggies on top.
-  Mmm-mmm!
- This is really good.
-  Yeah, you nailed it.
My salad is good, too.
- The zucchini noodles, I really like.
I don't know if it's that I've been eating
really healthy lately, but I
feel like they taste amazing.
- Look at this mess waiting
to happen over here.
(Janae giggles)
- Nae-Nae.
-  Ah do do do do do.
-  So Elise is getting
ready to head to ballet.
And Isaac has a Scouts
pack meeting tonight.
(background chatter)

♪ Just be happy with who you are ♪
-  Laura, what did
we do for Scouts tonight?
- Got a cookie.
-  Cookie.
- We played human Hungry Hippos.
-  Human Hungry
Hippos for the pack meeting.
- Goodnight, J House out.
-  So Janae is, shall we call it,
helping fold laundry.
- Destroying. (Kendra laughs)
