(bright music)
- Quiet.
- I got it, no!
(Kendra yells)
- Whoa.
Socks!
-  Good job, blow 'em out.
-  Good morning
friends, what day is it?
-  Dad's birthday.
- While he's gone playing racquetball
with his dad and his
brothers this morning,
(Janae screaming)
we are going to get his presents ready
and some breakfast ready
and Janae's apparently
really excited about it.
(upbeat music)
- So it's my birthday today.
I'm really excited.
And I'm starting the
day playing racquetball
with my dad who just flew into town
and my brother.
- I'm gonna win.
(uptempo dance music)
(hitting balls)
- Two wins for me, it is my birthday
so they might be playing
easy, but it still feels good.
-  It's card making time.
Laura, tell me about your card.
Look at all those L's.
Here's a picture of Laura and Daddy
and here's the boys.
Caleb, that is such a sweet note.
Isaac is Dad in all yellow?
- Yeah.
- I love it.
Poor Janae is too little to color.
I think she's upset I won't
let her eat the markers.
- I love Dad.
I want to marry a guy that's like him.
-  You want to marry
a guy that's like your dad?
- I love you Dad.
I'm so glad you are in my family.
Love, Caleb.
-  Whoa, what is that?
- A dinosaur.
-  This is a dinosaur?
- Yeah.
-  It's very abstract.
- Your honey will love this one,
it's made out of stripes.
-  Did you say my
honey will love that one?
- Yeah, cause it's yours to give to Dad.
-  Oh that's so nice.
Thanks for making a card for my bag.
Who's home?
- Dad!
- How are you guys?
-  Happy birthday!
- Good to see ya.
- She wanted to say hi to Daddy too.
- She crawled from way over there.
- Come here.
-  How was your racquetball?
- It was good.
I won the first two games,
and then I lost the last one.
I wanted to sweep the whole day,
but I was worn out.
- For Jeremy's birthday
breakfast this morning,
we are having eggs, hash browns and bacon,
and fruit smoothies.
(blender whirring)
- Be quiet.
-  We made a lot
of smoothie this morning.
How's the smoothie?
- It's very good.
-  Jeremy is the
master of cooking eggs.
- I'm no master, but it is yummy stuff.
Oh I got, oh!
- Ahh!
- The master?
I need a spoon.
Can I get the yoke without cracking?
-  Awww.
We'll get some paper towels.
- So this is a special breakfast for me.
I'd love to know in the comments
what a special breakfast is for you.
Another special breakfast is crepes.
I love Swedish pancakes, where you roll
it up with whipped cream
and strawberries and stuff.
That's really amazing as well.
- Jeremy got some work done this morning
and now he is out golfing with his dad
and his brothers, and
I'm so happy for him.
He never gets to do that kind of stuff.
And it's important to play and have fun.
I actually just read an article all about
the importance of play,
and not just in a kid's life
but in an adult's life too.
So Laura, what are we gonna make?
- We're gonna make the birthday cake.
-  For Daddy?
- Yeah, and it's gonna
be with this and this.
-  Okay, so we got some
of the ingredients right here.
What's the name of the kind of cake it is.
- Chocolate.
-  Not chocolate,
it's called pistachio.
- Pistachio.
I don't like that name.
-  You don't like that name?
- Let's name it yellow.
-  Alright, so you
start with the cake mix.
Oil, add three eggs
and the secret ingredient
is a cup of Sprite.
Now we're gonna mix it up.
- It's mixing it up.
-  It is mixing it up.
Now we're gonna put it in the oven.
(lively big band music)
There's the pistachio cake.
We just mixed up the frosting.
It's pistachio pudding,
Cool Whip and milk.
- I think you should
add a little more sugar.
-  You think so?
The cake is ready.
(bright music)
Well while there's been
some birthday elements
of our day today, there's also been
a lot of normal regular life.
I'm doing laundry, the
kids did their chores,
they're jumping on the trampoline
and Laura and I are hanging out,
because Laura is feeling particularly
nervous about something.
Since the big storm that
we had just a couple
of days ago, she's not
wanting to go outside,
she's not even wanting
to be in different rooms
of the house than Jeremy and I.
She pretty much just
wants to hang right by us.
And we keep reassuring
her, our house is safe.
There's no storm today, it's sunshiney,
what can I do to help you feel better?
- Just a snack will help me.
- Oh.
- Just food will help me.
- Just a snack, huh?
(bright jazzy music)
- Get in, get in.
That's about as close as it gets.
Oh.
So we're out golfing with
my brothers and my dad,
perfect way to spend my birthday.
(hitting balls)
It's such a beautiful day today,
the clouds are incredible.
-  Beautiful.
- Did it go over?
I hit a good shot.
So I'm 35 years old.
This last year, so many
amazing things happened.
I had my fifth kid, Kendra and I have made
a lot of progress with our marriage.
We did counseling,
which was really important.
We hit a million subscribers
with our channel,
we bought our house, we started
a law firm with my brother,
I just feel really blessed.
Well I guess the kids all disappeared,
I hate when that happens.
- Happy birthday Dad.
- Happy birthday!
- Hey hey.
- Wow!
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!
(laughing)
- It's time for Jeremy
to open his presents.
Each of the kids has a present for him.
- Did you draw me a card?
What did you write?
- I hope you hae a fun
time golfing and playing.
- Thanks, that's what that says.
- That is fun.
Everybody, Janae and Mom and Dad
and Laura and Elise and Caleb
and Isaac love each other from Laura.
- She loves her L's and H's.
There's L's and H's.
What?
A new tie?
(laughing)
I love this tie.
Can I try it on?
- Sure.
- And
how's my tie?
- What do you think?
- Great.
Tell everybody that you have a new tie.
- I have a new tie.
(laughing)
Whoa, tis one's in a big bag.
This one's kinda heavy too.
Do you want to help me?
Alright, let's see.
Monopoly Jr.
I have wanted to play this
with my kids my whole life.
Can we play this?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Happy birthday Dad.
I love you Dad.
I'm so glad you are in my family.
Love, Caleb.
- Thanks buddy.
- A snake.
(record scratches)
- And then a drawing of a snake.
- Where's the dinosaur?
- This one's super heavy.
Happy birthday Dad.
You picked good colors.
And a rainbow?
- A sunset.
- It's a sunset.
Dad I love you Dad.
You are the best.
Whoa!
- Your own root beer!
- Well I might need to
share it with somebody.
- Me me me.
- Yeah!
- All of us!
- Root beer.
- I'm a big root beer
fan, there's no question,
so thank you.
Alright, let's see the card first.
From Isaac, Dad, happy birthday.
Ooh, go KC.
That's a really good drawing.
- No offense to Raiders fan.
- Isn't it impressive?
- Yeah, no offense to any other fans.
KC's the best, number one.
Alright, happy birthday Dad.
I hope you have a good and fun birthday.
Thank you for being my dad, I love you
and thank you for playing
and watching sports with me, love Isaac.
I love watching sports with you.
- I picked last, so, it's
kind of an interesting gift.
- This might be my favorite present.
Let's see what it is.
Socks!
(dramatic music)
Thank you.
I've been wanting socks!
I appreciate it.
-  Last but not
least is Kendra's present.
- Kendra has never, almost never I think
kept a secret from me.
Or a present, have you ever done it?
-  I can usually keep
a secret for like two minutes.
- That's about it.
- Maybe.
- So I have no idea what's coming.
I know you've worked on it a bit, so.
Kendra's been super cute about it though
with her qualifying, 'cause she's like
I know she's making something
but she keeps downplaying
it, like this is really dumb,
it's really not a big deal,
she's been really cute about it.
- It's just silly and simple.
- It's just silly and simple.
-  It's just fun.
- I want Kendra next to me,
just in case this is like a prank
and it all is gonna blow up.
- Do you want me to help
you open it, like the kids?
- Yeah, okay.
I feel bubble wrap.
- Go to the side of the bubble wrap first.
- The side, is there
like more than one thing?
Okay, so, it's a mask.
- You might need it.
- Why would I need a mask?
- It's a hammer.
Smash me.
You made something.
- Yeah.
- You guys, it says smash me.
- Your presents inside of there.
- Smash me.
- Okay, let's go, do
you want to go outside
and find your present?
- Let's do it.
Here we go.
(uptempo rock music)
(hammering)
-  Whoa.
That thing is tough.
- So this thing is more
solid than I expected,
I'm gonna need a not kid
hammer and not doing it
on the table.
Should I get a chisel, so
I don't hurt the present?
-  Maybe.
- 'Cause look I can see
the present in here.
-  Oh.
-  Don't hurt your hands.
-  We decided
to let the kids all try.
- So I think I'm gonna
try to chisel it out,
so I don't damage what's inside.
(chiseling)
(Kendra laughing)
-  That thing's
like really in there.
- I'm gonna try to
actually hit it my hardest.
I haven't done that yet,
so let's see how it goes.
-  Uh-oh.
(yelling and laughing)
So here's where we're at.
- To finish this off, I
needed a solid foundation.
There we go.
- Woo hoo!
- Alright.
It's to go to to a movie.
-  Yeah.
- We never go to movies and I love movies
and it might even still work.
-  Happy birthday.
- Thank you so much.
So I've had several members
of my family and friends
say that they hope I have
a good sunset tonight
for my birthday.
- 'Cause they know how much you love them.
- Yeah, isn't that thoughtful?
It is a good sunset.
- It's beautiful out here.
-  So the kids are at gymnastics.
- They are, it's gymnastics night.
So today has been such a
great day in some moments,
and so darn annoying in other moments.
You I think when the
kids get really excited
about a special day,
it's really hard for them
to behave appropriately,
abd so we've been dealing
with discipline issues.
That's just real life,
it's just real life,
like I feel like this moment doesn't fit
in this beautiful vlog,
because we've got all
these wonderful memories
and all these happy things happening,
and then you turn around
and somebody's hitting their sibling
and somebody else is
whining about something
and that's just real life.
So we had some other things,
we had hoped to go out to a restaurant
with the family tonight
and the kids just weren't
behaving well enough for that.
So instead we stayed
home and had hot dogs.
(lively music)
(Jeremy laughing)
-  Elise.
Do you want to go home and
have cake and ice cream?
- Yeah, yum.
-  Here's our
version of 35 candles.
♫ Happy birthday dear
♫ Daddy
♫ Jeremy
♫ Happy birthday to you
(clapping)
-  Go for it.
(cheering)
- I didn't spit, I didn't spit.
-  Alright, who
wants cake and ice cream?
-  Me!
- So one of my favorite parts of this cake
is the frosting isn't the normal
rich buttercream frosting,
it's like a light whipped
pistachio amazingness.
It's so good.
The kids have prepared
an interpretive dance
to celebrate my birthday.
-  Jeremy, a man of good deeds
who cares and loves.
Today it's his birthday.
Jeremy loves to sing and dance.
And today he's turning 35.
-  25, I would've gone for that.
-  That's a lot.
Happy birthday Jeremy.
- Yay!
- Happy birthday!
-  Goodnight, J House out.
-  New pajamas.
- We thought it might
help her for her audition,
to practice in front of all of you.
-  There he goes.
- We're playing copy Janae.
(Janae screams)
(screaming)
