Jeremy yeah masterful surgeon well I
mean last time we did this everything
went wrong so last year Caleb got a tick
he was the only one of our kids that's
ever had a tick and he got one it was
the first time we'd ever experienced
that and we tried to pull it out and the
head got stuck in and it was a disaster
he was screaming the whole time and to
hold him down we did get the head out
but this time we've learned some lessons
and it went a lot better
was that okay buddy you were so brave
did we get it out of your skin is it
right here I didn't smush it I just
pulled it out so it would let go I have
it right here
it's worth you wanna go eat lunch yeah a
second okay let's put a little bit of
alcohol on it too that's recommended oh
well mr. dr. Jeremy apparently I'm doing
a search on the interwebs well let's see

where it is oh my gosh that is so
disgusting

that is so disgusting oh that is so
disgusting
well glad we got it I hate like I love
like the lush green beauty of where we
live but why does that to come with so
many disgusting bugs yeah I grew up in
Arizona and there were no ticks we only
have like rattlesnakes and scorpions by
the way there's a tornado watch going on
so uh being from the Midwest today
you guys see it well they get bigger if
it would have stayed on cubby longer it
would have gotten all bloated because it
would have been sucking his blood we got
it out some it didn't suck his blood
poor Laura she just wants to be hanging
out with us to me all right let's go
wash your hands and then eat lunch I
already did

hey daddy what's your favorite kind of
pizza my favorite flavor of pizza I
think I like supreme
I like black olives a lot and green
peppers and onions and hamburger and
pepperoni like I like everything on my
pizza oh what's your favorite then I
walk and tie it up with what cheese and
deluxe no no I can't pepper very fun
what's your favorite Caleb yeah Lucy
what's your favorite cheese cheese yeah
sometimes pepperoni but when it's
pepperoni we just take off that
pepperoni yeah so it sounds like elese
likes pepperoni pizza if you take off
the pepperonis or cheese pizza so so my
favorite kind of pizza is actually a
calzone and it's a Philly cheesesteak
calzone that they had at Minsky's which
is a popular pizza place in Kansas City
area it's amazing
wait I don't think your favorite pizza
is allowed to be a Philly cheesesteak
calzone
that's just like not even pizza so try
again I'm not really a red sauce person
so pizza is not my favorite thing in the
world so I like I guess the ones like
I'd like a barbecue chicken pizza or
like like a white sauce pizza so another
favorite of mine I like ham and
pineapple but the ham isn't as good so
you get pineapple and pepperoni that is
good it is really good we we get that I
haven't done it for a long
it's one of my favorites I like ground
beef on pizza I like vegetables on pizza
bacon bacon bacon on pizza is good mmm I
love dessert pizzas like chocolate chip
pizzas or fruit pizzas if I did not say
that
they can't be thank you look up you
she's actually playing chubby bunny
this isn't gonna end well okay I got it
shut up and swallow it oh you got to
chew it No hey key you can shoot up and
swallow your watermelon silly Billy is
getting juice everywhere
Kendra's so cute when she lowers
but you what are you laughing about
what are you laughing about
it's so funny how it kind of drags
Kendra along we used to have just a
normal push mower and we use that for
the first year and a half here in this
lawn it didn't have you know any
propelling system when we actually
preferred that do it little awkward
getting around our tree let's be honest
this is the first time this year that I
found the law and I think I might be a
little bit out of practice
Jeremy was nice enough to offer to do
some of the hard spots I don't know why
he thought I needed help
hey why I'm super proud of myself I just
got back from a two mile run which is
not a long run but this week I've done a
total of six miles which again is not a
super far distance but it's six miles
more than last week so I'm proud of
myself and it started raining so I know
I looked awesome with my frizzy hair but
I just kind of had an emotional funk
today and it felt so good to just get
out and run like I need to be running it
helps me emotionally it helps me
physically it helps me spiritually it
helps me be a better wife and a better
mom and I just love it
now don't get me wrong I'd rather be
laying on the couch eating chocolate
cake which I still might do tonight but
it felt really good to get out there and
um yeah I had a good run so Isaac did
something fun today he invented a what
you invent what is it animal
what's your animal meat a felt swim what
does it do it's the fastest running
animal swimming animal flying animal and
swinging on trees and holy cows that's
awesome how did you come up with it um I
thought I was making a one that can fly
and swim and I like how that can run on
land too and you know all right do what
I won that can swing on branches awesome
that is so cool and I did them all
together awesome well very cool I love
that Isaac is using his creativity
Kendra gave him a lesson the other day
about right-brain left-brain and he
knows if he likes me really logical he's
been trying to be more and more creative
and I'm it and that's on the right brain
side because I've been working on the
right foot I should Libya good night you
