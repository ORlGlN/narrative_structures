previously on J house vlogs Kendra just
got back from her hike and I wanted to
show her what happened while she was
gone
Kendra your oh my gosh what happened it
shattered I try and tell you that I went
to the cemetery and it all broke my
piece
well we're going to start cleaning that
up now we are headed to Walmart to buy a
new patio table why why do we need it
because when you're staying somewhere
and you break their table you get to
replace it so that's we're headed
did you guys see that toilet
I so bad want to go and like take
pictures with the toilet
we could start a thing right instead of
target balling toilet sitting like
there's a toilet sitting out in front of
someone yeah toilet sitting that could
go very wrong we're going to start
something to catch that toilet sink no
we don't want to see those pictures if
we don't want to see those pictures we
are headed to Walmart and then to jump
ok where are we going
no we're not going to a candy store
we're going to Jamba Juice which is
better than a candy store so here's what
we look like going into Walmart hey and
this is really any parking lot like
we're all holding hands hopefully they
still have what we're looking for we
just leave the table I think this is it
they have it yes they have it guys I
don't know how we're going to get it in
our van we're gonna have to try to get
this in the van with the kids it's gonna
be fun we're trying to fit the table in
the car so we moved Isaac up we could
fold this all the way down
I thought it might work better to have
it only halfway down though
all right it's in hopefully they live
survives survives all right we put the
table in nice work Jeremy I have like
bungee cords to hold it down to I'm
gonna just do that well you brought
bungee cords all right we're going in
