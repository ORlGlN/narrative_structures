-  What are alpacas?
- I don't know.
We haven't seen 'em.
-  This is an alpaca right here.
(bluegrass music)
(babbling)
-  Do you think
you'd like alpaca clothes?
(pop music)

- So I was up this morning early
playing basketball with friends
and now we're gonna be
cleaning our church.
(Classical music)
-  Man, I like cleanin' bathrooms!
-  Why do you
like cleaning bathrooms?
- Just--
- You like having
that on your side?
(electronic hip-hop music)
Good job cleaning, peeps.
So as you know, I'm a lawyer
and one of the things that I've loved
over these years as we've been vlogging is
when viewers have reached out
to get legal help from me
and I've been able to provide advice
and provide support and love.
It's really been one of
the most meaningful parts
of being a lawyer over
these last several years.
And Kendra and I talked
about how we could do more of that,
how we can make it easier for viewers
if they need legal help,
to be able to reach out
and for us to provide that.
So what we've decided to do is
to put a link in the description box
of all of our vlogs.
So if you are needing legal help,
you can go there
and even if you're not
in the Kansas City area,
we can provide legal help.
Or we can help connect you with someone
who would be the right fit for your case.
What I've loved about vlogging is
the relationships and the connections
that we're able to make with you,
and what I've loved
about being a lawyer is
helping people I care about.
And so these two things just
really go together well.
I know that not all of you
are gonna need legal help
right now, but if that is something
that comes up, or someone you know
who is looking for help, send 'em my way.
- Well, I'm really proud of Jeremy.
He has been so disciplined this week.
He lost ten pounds this week.
- In six days.
This is my first thing to eat
after the cleanse.
-  It's a healthy choice.
-  Can I have some?
-  She wants a bite.
- Mmm, that was yummy.
- So Kendra found that there's a local
alpaca show going on.
What do you think an alpaca show is?
- Like there's alpacans there?
That dances with us?
-  Dance with us?
What are alpacas?
- I don't know.
We haven't seen 'em.
-  What do you
think an alpaca show is?
- Is it like where you sit outside
and there's like a screen?
-  What's on the screen?
- A movie.
- Is it like a bird show?
-  What do you think, Isaac?
- Isn't it where those
like native people dance?
And they're dancing and
sometimes we might get
to join in?
-  Where do you guys
think an alpaca show is?
- Outside.
- By a camp fire or something.
- Inside.
-  What do you think
kids are supposed to do at alpaca shows?
- Play?
- So honestly I've never been
to an alpaca show either,
so let's go find out what it's all about.
- You don't know?
-  I have no idea
what is gonna happen here.
But I've seen pictures online.
Let's hope in the car, peeps.
- So usually I teach the kids about things
before we go see things,
but this time I kinda just
wanna let them discover it
on their own, see how that goes.
(upbeat electronic music)
So here's the poll question for today:
Before watching our video today,
did you know what an alpaca was?
Let us know up here.
So Laura, what's an alpaca?
- Uh, I don't know.
-  Don't know yet?
- This is an alpaca.
-  This is an alpaca right here.
- Is it kind of like a sheep?
-  Kind of.
-  It reminds me of a llama.
-  It's like a llama sheep.
- It is!
- Alpaca, so the alpaca
that does the best gets the
first place ribbon?
-  I guess so.
-  It's like a competition.
- So it's like an animal show.
-  That's right.
She likes alpacas.
(barks like Janae when she sees a dog)
Do you see how they get down?
She's trying to bark.
She was trying to bark.
- That's the sound she makes for dogs.
These are alpacas!
(instrumental country music)
-  Okay everyone,
try to chew like an alpaca.
- So Janae has signed horse
and she signed dog.
She's confused.
It's an alpaca.
-  What's that, oh.
- They're so cute.
- So apparently alpacas'
hair or wool or fur,
when used to make
clothes, creates something
that's really breathable and nice.
Look at their hair.
- So Caleb, do you hear that?
They shear them, which means cut off
all this fiber, which is their hair.
Once a year.
-  And then they use the hair
for blankets and clothes
and all kinds of stuff.
-  And we'll
go see that over there.
(rock music)
Feel that.
-  That's the fiber.
- So apparently they
call it fiber, not hair
or wool or fur or something like that.
So initially I was wondering
about all the fans in here,
because it's a cold day,
but then I realized
these alpacas have a lot
of fiber on them.
- What's the limit that alpacas can grow?
Like, how much feet?
-  How tall?
- At the top of their head,
they're about five feet.
(bluegrass music)
-  She wants to walk.
-  Alpaca-vicuna,
which is like an alpaca.
-  Wow, can we
hold it, is that okay?
-  Yeah, you can.
-  So then the end
thing is it becomes yarn.
-  And then they
make things out of the yarn.
-  This is a combo
of alpaca and acrylic.
You shear it, you give it a
big, short, butch haircut.
(bluegrass music)
-  Oh my
goodness, what do you say?
-  It's dyed.
-  You say thank you,
they already said it.
Pick it up and feel it.
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.
-  So you guys have little balls
of alpaca fiber.
- Literally turning into string.
-  It is.
Wow, do you guys see?
She's pressing it with her foot.
- This looks like a cinnamon roll.
-  Is that some
alpaca hair for you?
- Mm-hmm.
- So apparently when
they're judging alpacas,
they're looking at the body 50%,
the hair 50% or the fiber
to see how tightly woven it is,
something like that.
- All right, this is it,
can you guys feel the intensity?
-  No, yes.
-  Real alpaca judging.
We're at the Alpaca Super Bowl.
(dramatic music)
- Go, That Guy!
Go, That Guy!
-  Cheering for him?
- Yes.
- Number 110 is his number.
-  Oh, did we have a favorite?
- Go, Alpaca 110.
- That's a thing.
-  Yeah, we
should've brought signs.
(babbling)
She's cheering!
(upbeat electronic music)
Isn't that crazy soft?
(upbeat electronic music)
- This is so soft.
- It's really interesting
to see this whole process
from beginning to end, from the alpaca
with the fiber on its body
to it being sheared and
then what they can do
with those fibers and making clothes
and other products.
It's so soft.
- So soft.
-  Do you think
you'd like alpaca clothes?
- It would make me warmer.
It would be cool to have pajamas.
- Yeah, look, it's alpaca stuffed animals.
Aren't they so cute?
I'm almost tempted to
buy some alpaca fiber
and try spinning it just 'cause I've never
done it before and I wonder
how it would feel to actually do that.
-  So, what'd you
think of the alpaca show?
- It was a lot different than I expected.
-  What did you expect?
- I expected that the alpacas
would do tricks like--
-  More like a circus?
- Yeah.
-  That would be fun.
(upbeat music)
Laura, where are you headin'?
- To a birthday party.
-  Fun.
(upbeat music)
- I think I would love this.
I should get into this.
-  Definitely let out a lot
of that aggressive
energy that you (laughs).
- So we came to look for these things.
They're called dumbbells?
We're going to do some
weightlifting at home
and we need weights for that.
(funk music)
Jeremy and I are out on
our date night tonight
and we decided to stop
at this sports store
to get some dumbbells, but
now we're just having fun
checking out all the things.
So here's pickleball stuff.
There's supposed to be a pickleball place
close to us.
- I'll have to try it.
I've never played.
- I bet I'd beat you.
Jeremy knew about this, but I did not.
A speed chute.
So you run with a parachute behind you
and then it makes you faster.
-  Well, when you're doing things
with resistance and then you
remove the resistance you--
- But still, don't you think it'd look
a little funny to run
around the neighborhood
with a parachute behind you?
-  Definitely around
the neighborhood, yes.
Why don't I just run
around with one of these?
(Kendra laughs)
Dragging behind.
-  Jeremy loves whiffle balls.
- Good memories.
-  And whiffle bats.
We had a whiffle bat for so long,
it got broken and then we duct taped it
and kept using it.
- It's still good.
-  Good memories.
End-of-the-day snuggles with dad.
(Kendra laughing)
It's her favorite.
She climbs over and begs him to do that.
- Dad.
- Dad, it's Dad.
(pretend-snoring)
(babbling)
(Kendra laughing)
-  You can see
her, she kinda leans
her head back.
She's ready for it.
-  Good night, J House out.
-  We've been
having babies for ten years,
by the way.
We've had someone in diapers.
- We were talking about that.
-  For ten years.
- It's been a decade.
- Here, get in the air.
Come on, go.
(laughs)
-  What are you guys doing?
