-  Now we're
headed to an escape room.
-  He's going!
(upbeat music)
- So I am not a morning person.
I would rather stay in bed,
and I feel grumpy in the morning.
But Janae is so happy in the morning
that I can't help but smile.
I go and I get her out of her crib
and she just glows.
She just radiates happiness
and she's blabbering away and signing
and just the joy on her face
is completely contagious.
Each of the kids as they wake up
and come out, they see Janae
and they just light up.
And it's amazing how happiness
is contagious like that.
I'm very grateful for
her joy in the morning.
Maybe I can become a morning person
if I hang out with her enough.
- Mama.
- Mama.
- Mama.
-  Mama.
- Mama, mama.
(babbling)
-  She wants to
watch Baby Saving Time.
- Can you blow kisses?
Yeah, that was a blowing kisses.
Can you give Mama kisses?
Aww, thank you.
(babbling)
(laughing)
(babbling)
-  "Ew, Mom, you're salty."
(dramatic music)
So we're gonna add some black olives
to some of these.
So Isaac started doing grateful olives.
- I'm grateful for sports.
- I'm grateful for families.
- I'm grateful for clean drinking water.
You might wanna scoot back, Isaac.
Caleb can hit the ball pretty hard.
(Jeremy groaning)
Nice!
- That was pretty hard, like--
-  Man, hit,
he's going, he's going.
So did you guys have
your snowballs out here?
- They got destroyed in the night.
-  Here, Dad, pitch to me.
-  Did you guys come out
in the middle of the
night and destroy them?
-  No, they got destroyed.
Now we're making a calendar.
-  Whoa, into the tree!
Get him!
Oh, almost!
- I'm gonna kick you, ya!
(shouting)
- So we're running several
errands this morning.
Caleb is my little helper.
First stop, I'm dropping off all
of my documents to my accounts for taxes.
Yeah, taxes are done!
Yeah, we're out of gas.
(mellow jazz)
Full!
(fast-paced electronic music)
Plumbing!
We need the one-inch
connectors.
So we came to get a couple
more connectors for our kids' PVC pipe
building kit that we made for them.
So here's the one-inch ones.
Let's look for the
connectors we're needing.
- We found it.
-  Yep, this is the one we need.
-  Should we take the whole box?
-  We need it.
- There's a whole entire 'nother box.
- Oh good, we needed a lot more.
("Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" by Mozart)
So I have a car where I still physically
roll down my window.
Let me know in the poll
if your car has automatic
window rolling-down system
or manual, with your hand.
- So for Spanish today, we're trying
to do a little activity
with play food down here.
We're gonna see if the kids can ask
for what they want
and remember the word in Spanish.
- Hola.
- Hola, buenos dias.
- Buenos dias, que quieres comprar hoy?
- Quiero el pollo y las uvas.
- El pollo y las uvas.
- Ya esta gracias.
- De nada.
-  She wants something.
- Que quieres?
Quieres agua?
-  Gracias.
(laughter)
- Hola.
- Hola.
-  Que quieres comprar?
- Quiero
el pan.
- El pan.
- Y--?
- Y la leche?
- Yeah.
- Say sí.
- Sí.
- Sí.
Can you say gracias?
- Gracias.
- De nada.
-  Hello.
She's coming to play peek-a-boo with me.
Hey, peek-a-boo.
Peek-a-boo.
(Kendra laughing)
-  Uh-oh.
-  Peek-a-boo.
-  To properly play peek-a-boo,
you have to move your
head all the way sideways.
Poor Jeremy, it's hard
being a work-at-home dad
when you've got this cuteness.
-  Get over here.
- Quiero la manzana.
-  La manzana, o!
No tenemos manzanas hoy, lo siento.
-  She's so sad.
- Quieres un platano?
No?
Quieres las uvas?
-  Sí.
-  Hola.
- Hola.
- Que quieres?
- Yo quiero Taco Bell.
(laughter)
Tacos, burritos.
- No tenemos tacos.
Lo siento.
- Queso.
Gracias.
(laughter)
I'm still learning Spanish.
It's pretty slow process.
Good job, Elise.
(upbeat music)
- Everything's upside down.
(laughs)
- We're wanting to have Elise have
some more practice on her addition
and subtraction math facts.
We wanna make it fun,
so I downloaded a few new math apps today
and the favorite one that we've tried is
called Operation Math
and you get to be a secret agent
and try to do addition facts
and subtraction to open
secret access doors
and hopefully complete
your mission on time.
It's really fun.
I love it when learning can be fun,
especially with something
like drilling facts.
Flash cards aren't fun,
and these app games can be awesome.
(video game music)
You got this, Leesy.
You're almost there.
- I like being secret agents.
-  You feel sneaky?
What about that timer,
is it pretty intense?
- It's intense.
- So we're cleaning up the house again
for what feels like the fourth time.
Playing some music.
We're all working together.
Nae Nae's dancing for us.
Good job, Nae Nae.
Yeah!
(gentle music)
- Tonight is fun.
Jeremy and I are going on a date.
We're going out to dinner
and to an escape room game
and the kids are going to a gymnastics
parents' night out glow-in-the-dark night,
so win-win-win-win.
They get to have fun at the gym
and we get to go have fun too.
And we get to keep Janae with us.
And that's even gonna be more fun.
(Classical music)
We're going to a crepe place
and I'm really excited.
I was looking up early
today restaurants downtown
and nothing really sounded super inspired,
but my friend knows of a crepe place!
Drink, drink, there it is.
(upbeat music)
Now we're headed to an escape room.
- We have our secret weapon with us.
-  Janae is the
mastermind behind the plans.
She's so precious.
- This is the room that we're going
to be trying to break out of.
I'm excited, I love these things.
- We have 60 minutes.
- I think we can do it.
- Yes!
- We got out, 13 minutes remaining.
It was really, really fun.
We did have to get one hint.
We did it.
(fast-paced electronic music)
-  Nae Nae's out.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  Nae Nae's going.
Well, gymnastics was a hit.
- Oh my goodness, they loved this.
-  So how did you like it?
- It was so much fun.
(babbling)
-  Nae Nae, Nae Nae.
- Good night, J House out.
(laughs)
-  Whoa!
(laughter)
