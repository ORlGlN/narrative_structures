time out sorry I'm not in the vlog today
guys I haven't been feeling all with
morning sickness and I'm excited because
I have a doctor's appointment coming up
to try to help resolve that a little
more but I've been thinking a lot about
pregnancy and how it is honestly hard
for me but it is so completely and
infinitely worth it everything in my
life that I have done that's been really
worth it has been hard you know if
you're going to school if you're going
to college if you're having children if
you're you know any of the goals and
dreams that I've had that I've worked
towards have been hard and so I think
that's just the way life is like we have
to go through the hard times to get to
what's beautiful and worth it and
pregnancies kind of the same as that so
I'm just trying to remember the end goal
and stay positive and yeah
the hungry bunny got the kids down now
I'm gonna see if I can get some food
down Kendra try an IHOP
she's been so sick you guys prayers for
Kendra to house out okay this is making
me feel a little bit better
