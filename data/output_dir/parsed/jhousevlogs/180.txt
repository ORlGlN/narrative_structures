is really to check it out
good morning we are headed to Utah on an
airplane in like an hour and a half and
the kids are being so helpful this
morning I've been amazed that the jobs
are able to do it stuff that usually
just gara me they are doing and they're
taking out the trash and making lunch
they're packing bags so kendra has all
of the clothes bagged and number so
which day they're going to be worn and
Isaac is packing it up so we are in the
car and we're headed to the airport
series we're not the tornado in sight in
fact there's not even a storm in sight
so that's good news
we're running a little bit late which is
why Jeremy just winter a yellow light a
little kind important it was yellow it
was not read those chemicals ha ha yeah
we're going Utah oh hey raise your hand
if you were born in Utah hey Laura you
were born in Kansas City me and Isaac
were born
actually we don't see the house where
you guys were born yeah so Kendra and I
aren't from Utah we just went to school
there I did law school there and then we
moved to Kansas City
so basically headed to our beginning
this is where Jeremy and I met this is
where we were living when we first got
married and had Isaac and Alisa so it's
full of wonderful memories were excited
to share some of that with the kids and
CVX live is happening so we're going to
see a bunch of youtubers well this is
not our first time flying with all five
kids but I don't know if I'm ever going
to not be nervous about flying with five
kids I feel like we're driving up to the
airport terminal and I'm like alright
Jesus Moll we had to come with us this
time nice so the way we do this when we
go to the airport is Jeremy drops me and
all the kids except for Caleb off and
then he goes in parks car and comes and
gets us we're waiting for a bus I could
see it coming but I put the bag inside
out with our car seats so before the bus
gets here I have to try to fix that
there's the bus let's make this happen
I just got it in time just barely did we
make it I always feel like we look a
little crazy walking to the airport
time
the day William 25-minute silly
Kendra was just making fun of me for
forgetting my laptop last time she's all
did you remember your laptop yeah I got
it ah the big event when our families
get on a plane thank you guys all right
let's go
they're pretty exciting years
different everybody
they let the kids look into the cockpit
Michaela goes whoa a longer button we
weren't able to get all six seats the
others at times the boys are few rows
back girls I'm here with me so just
being the Kendra that if guarantee were
the Olympics been traveling at the
airport to be an entire event trying to
get on the bus train to get to ticketing
going through security sitting on the
plane like it's amazing
haunted the runway make runway Vegas go
so Pat I bet the runway is on the bottom
and we could slide right down it until
we fly up into the air
so before we left I was looking
everywhere for one of my favorite
earrings I had left it on to people and
I couldn't find it anywhere and finally
we just had to go and I was like man I'm
not going to have my earrings that I
love and guess what
I just opened Laura's backpack and she
had packed my earrings she flipped on
from off the table and she packed them
at the bottom of her own bag with some
random socks
did you take my earrings let's see your
pierced ears you got your nose
so we're not going there's overdose Lisa
you can hear assembly
Thanks
however they leave it was good
Hey

janae and she's loving it like you're
listening good job team you can say oh
you can so today this is it our rental
van we did it almost for pay but we're
getting close

much a professional car seat installer
at this point the worst hauling in life
if I burst the children and he does the
car seat and we're calling it even oh my
goodness Jesse that there is an actual
opening we feel cooler driving at the
end of the Center
I always feel cool driving in windows
thank you and you look good doing it
just in case any of you are wondering
this is why we believe the Utah desert
on a brighter day heats the car so much
that would been 16 hours of a crying
baby hey
girls is adorable Gemma look a baby hey
so we're here at Marla's play and she's
making dinner for us thank you
so all day
we've just been off with vlogging with
the camera so what I mean by that is
like something she was happening and we
go and we grab the camera and we forget
to press record we return money travel
without smiles at the same time it's
hard to people mainly unless you have
ninja cat-like reflexes which sometimes
sure he does
got to come roll down the hill
let it go roll down the hill he's going
on your mark get set go
faster faster
hey let's build a snowman oh man
how do you feel after hearing that
alright you want to put down the hill
not up the hill we've had some kids that
likes grass and some babies that hated
it she's pulling her feet up Oh what do
you think in agreement figure she's just
kind of scowling at it like what is this
no no not a fan of the grass
we're staying in a rental house for the
first couple days that we're here in
Utah we much prefer to stay in rental
houses over hotels instead of getting
one room with all of our residents we
get a sub workers so we're going in to

looks like it's right next apartment
