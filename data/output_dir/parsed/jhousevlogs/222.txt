I just found out I'm balding Joker
I'm feeling pretty determined I really
want to figure out what this birthday
you found a clown all by yourself
my pecker was sick last name is throwing
up
it's one of the bummers is that at our
reunion there have been several people
that have been sick we've had some
throwing up and so we're just seeing it
kind of go through the family what do
you want for breakfast buddy I'm gonna
have a mix of cinnamon and spice and
then increase I'll be a yummy combo meal
probably about 10 hours you went to bed
around 8 or 9 and you woke up around 6
this is the latest you've slept in all
trip so it's been so nice in the
mornings it's warm enough that we've
either been going on walks or Laura's
just Out playing in the dirt already the
weather has been so nice if those
glasses on you pick on the page
my god yeah that would be fun
exactly
you're just pretending you better hold
on you guys what we have oh you stop it
okay how do you spear it
hey how do you make it go
there you go
pop us at the four-wheeler so that they
can't go very fast it's perfect for the
kids have to learn how to drive all on
their own I just found out I'm balling
apparently pregnancy does this to people
it does after you have your baby you
lose some hair and I've always lost some
hair right here but look at this
apparently I can't wear my hair like
this anymore because it's just so
obvious I'm gonna have to like get
creative and part it different ways so
that you guys got them it will grow back
though but there's always awkward phases
it has her back after every other kid
but what at this time I just lose all
the rest of my hair wigs
I think it's been so friendly with all
of his little nieces yeah
he's I'm playing with them the whole
time Pat it and Mark it with it and
wicked
so this morning is a girl dried my mom
my grandma my sister sister laws we're
all going for a ride
so the first day Caleb wasn't quite
brave enough to do the whole thing but
today he's doing it the entire distance
go so proud of you buddy the ladies were
gone for over an hour
the great-grandmama driven off
four-wheeler Isaac coolest great-grandma
out there how was it oh yeah over an
hour we went far it was dusty my thumb
is so you press though with your thumb
yeah yo son left so I didn't have
sunglasses on initially and I knew it
wasn't too sunny out but I hadn't
realized how much dusk we get into my
eyes so like the first 15 minutes the
drive on just like crime then Tiffany
was in front so she gave me her
sunglasses and okay I gave you Jeremy so
yeah so Jeremy thank you we got a baby
it's a baby Gemma
absolutely loves Jenna no I know
are you worried oh so we're trying to
identify the kind of bird that's living
in the birdhouse we've seen it three
times and my mom has a bird book we look
scary to drink
it is we don't think it's a cero I think
it might be some sort of a cinch
so that's such a longer peculation it
does and the nice stripe I'm going to
find it going to figure it out I think
it could be a red okay so I'm having a
really hard time finding this bird I
don't know why I can't find one that
looks just like it I'm wondering about
the nuthatch
or maybe the black-throated sparrow but
that one has a shorter beak than I would
like there's a blue tint to it
Jeremy wondered about this titmouse
that's white on the front it's gray on
the back I don't know if it's blue
I'm going to find it there's a long beak
okay I grabbed another book and I think
I found in here meters out that's
definitely it yay breasted not suffice
nut hat net hatch thank you
the white-breasted nuthatch and now we
just have to sit here and we put the
bird to come back again so we can
confirm our suspicions listen to this
nuthatches
are the only tree climbers so agile that
they can creep down a tree trunk which
we've been watching this or do over and
over again and we've been amazed by
definitely they find morsels that upward
climbers knit this smaller net hatch is
also free frequently on insects at the
tips of small branches and on seeds from
pine gum timezones this is a
white-breasted nuthatch I knew it all
along
we're the biggest nerds we are being a
nerd oh that's good here it come so we
don't have the internet so we used books
look crazy we figured it out there it is
that's too little yet Caleb are you

peace
