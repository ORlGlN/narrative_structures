(kids laughing)
There we go, one, two, three.
(kids laughing)
(upbeat music)
Time out quick reminder we have
this Saturday is our one million
sub service celebration if you
can come that's great if not we
would love for you to participate
by donating in the link
in the description box.
I know the people in Puerto Rico
I just saw in the news that like
70% of them still don't have power.
And everything we're trying to do
is to give relief to them and so
any help big or small we
would love your participation.
But I'll get you back to
the vlog now, time in.
(upbeat music)
(Dad laughing)
I gotta stop, Isaac, I gotta stop.
-  Daddy.
- I may have fallen a little bit there.
Trying to mess up Isaac on the race.
So normally when we're here there's a ton
of people, it's nice to have the
place pretty much to ourselves.
For now, school's about to
get out so it'll get busier.
'Kay, go potty.
(upbeat music)
- I'm coming in, get on the tire.
-  Nice.
- I'm doing it the baseball way.
-  Baseball way, nice.
(calm music)
Whoa it's like riding a horse.
Get your protective goggles on Laura.
One, two, three, nice.
'Kay here we go big girl, you and me.
Pull it back, three.
-  Oh that's my sister.
-  Yeah, we hit it,
lean back, lean back.
(upbeat music)
- Thank you so much.
-  Hey, hey.
- This is crazy.
-  You ready to get out, how was it?
- Good.
(soft music)
-  Ooh, almost, he makes it.
Oh almost, 'kay Caleb you wanna try?
Oh he's getting close.
(everyone laughing)
- This thing is heavy.
-  Got it, good job.
(upbeat music)
Not gonna happen.
Are you a fairy?
- Oh, I can see his sock.
-  Get that sock, hey.
What happened to your body?
There's some in your ear.
And now for the annual
J House corn race, go.
They're going, keep going.
(peppy music)
Go, this is such a good workout.
-  (mumbles).
(girls laughing)
-  You're huge.
(everyone laughing)
- Yay.
- You're, there's a
football inside of you.
-  I'm sad we're missing Janae,
she would've been so cute in the corn.
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
-  Ooh Caleb that
was so close, nailed it.
(Isaac screams)
In and out.

new house, oh I love it.

-  You want that room, okay but
there's no toilet in this
house, you sure you wanna stay?
- Yes.
-  Look at these ones cub.
(soft music)
-  They don't want them.
-  Chicken.
-  Look, do you see the turkeys.
-  They're on the run.
-  You gotta pump it.
(upbeat music)
Then pet it.
You guys see that little piggy?
What does it smell like Laura?
- Poop.
-  Poop, poop, piggy poop.
-  Good night, J House out.
- I got a text from my
sister this afternoon.
That my dad was in the
ambulance on the way
to the hospital and that he
was having a heart attack.
And that is a text that
you never want to get.
Anyway, I cried, and I called
my sister for more updates and
I prayed and I called Jeremy.
