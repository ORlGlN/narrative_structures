- This is just wrong.
Oh my goodness.
(upbeat music)
Guys, what we're gonna make today
is a fruit Christmas tree.
(kids exclaiming in excitement)
(Janae babbles)
-  What are you doing?
Look at how well she's standing.
So this is a toy we've
had down in the garage.
We just pulled up for her.
-  We realized she's
at just the right stage for it.
- Yeah.
Take a step.
Take a step.
There it is!
Good job.
(fun guitar music)
Somehow our garage always
gets unorganized and messy.
Again.
And one of the presents
we're getting for our kids
is gonna require a clean garage.
So I'm doing that today.
And I'd love to hear in the comments,
your guesses of what present
we're getting the kids
that needs a clean garage.
- Why we do have all the winter stuff out?
- We are gonna go through
it today and see what fits,
so we're ready for a snowstorm.
So we gotta see which size you are.
You wanna try those ones on?
- Yeah.
It kinda of fit.
-  It totally fits.
-  That looks awesome.
Okay, run around in it.
-  See if it works.
-  It's overalls.
- So I decided that today was a good day
to get out all of the winter gear
and see what fits the kids.
That way we can hopefully be ready
when the first snowstorm comes.
Hey, this one might fit you great.
-  Where did we get that?
- I don't know, I have no
recollection of this one.
-  Thank you to
whoever gave that one to us.
- Right?
It's probably a hand
me down from somebody.
Does that one work?
- Yeah.
I like pink!
(bright music)
- Gloves.
When you have a lotta kids,
you acquire a lot of winter stuff.
And I just wanna go through
and see what we need
and what we don't need
so we can donate whatever
we're not using anymore
and buy whatever it is that the kids need.
We have four full tubs of winter stuff.
Winter stuff is big and bulky.
Try that one on.
- Me?
- Hey, try that one on.
-  My big coat.
(bright country music)
-  I'm not going outside.
I'm gonna stay in where it's warm.
- And that has hot chocolate.
I mean make hot chocolate.
- That's my job.
That's my job, take care of
Janae and make hot chocolate.
- And love us.
- Yes.
Laura, this one's your jacket.
This one says 12 months so
this one's for little Janae.
So the zipper's broken on this one.
It's obviously a very old coat.
I think we're gonna get a
new coat for you this year.
So I'm feeling kinda disgusted.
This super cute snowsuit
is like this on the inside
and then look it, there's
another spot down here.
-  We're wondering
if maybe a mouse got to it.
- Kinda feeling grossed out about that.
-  Snow pants!
Alright, who has snow pants?
-  Me!
-  Snow coats.
Who has snow boots?
-  Me.
- I don't.
-  Alright, who has snow gloves.
-  Me.
-  Alright, who has a snow hat?
- So it looks like what we need
is new boots, a jacket
and gloves for Elise
and new snow gloves for Isaac.
Do you have everything you need?
- No.
- Oh this is a lot of things for winter.
-  It is a lot
of things for winter.
So it looks like you and
I need to go shopping.
- Yeah!
- Well now I know it's
warming up for winter.
-  Were you warm
with all that stuff on?
- Yeah, too warm.
-  Too hot inside?
(dramatic music)
- Mission clean up garage
while listening to some of
my favorite music of course.
So we found that with managing
seven people in our family,
we have to donate a lot of stuff
and cycle through a lot of stuff.
Otherwise you can hoard
and just keep tons of stuff
that you don't end up using.
So the garage isn't
perfect, but, it'll do.
I'll be back to clean it
again in three months.
(happy music)
So Caleb's my helper.
We're dropping off some donations.
-  Caleb and Janae are building.
Caleb, what's Janae's job?
- She's the crane.
She knocks stuff over.
-  She knocks it over at the end?
Janae are you a crane?
This is a nice build, Caleb.
- Put that one there and one there.
-  Balance.
Is your design done?
- Yep.
- 'Kay, how do you get Janae to do it?
(playful music)
Hey Janae.
More interested in that block, huh?
(laughing)
This is hilarious.
This is like one of the first times
my kids have just built stuff
for their younger sibling to destroy
and now she has no
interest in destroying it.
Now if he'd built something
that he really loved
and didn't want her to
touch, you better betcha
she'd be all over it, right?
-  Please don't knock it over.
I actually kinda like this thing.
This is pretty cool.
-  This is hilarious.
Whoa!
She got it.
-  Hey Nae Nae.
(Janae babbles)
-  Isaac are you vlogging?
- Yeah.
- You vlogged.
- Yeah.
- You're a vlogger.
- Yeah.
(laughs)
- So we're trying something new today.
We are making fruit Christmas trees.
And I really love seasonal, festive foods.
But I don't like when we eat
too much candy and treats,
I just don't feel good with my body.
And so when I saw this online
I thought it was a great idea.
So we're gonna make fruit Christmas trees.
(bright music)
- Grapes.
- 'Cause then you'll.
- I won't.
-  Very cool raspberries.
- So Kendra picked up a buncha fruit
and she bought this at the store.
And I don't think I've
ever eaten it or cut it
or know how.
Do you guys know what fruit this is?
- A star.
-  It's the star fruit.
Have you guys ever eaten that?
- Yeah.
- No!
- You have?
- Remember last year.
- So I actually have no idea
if this is ripe or over ripe.
But this is why I bought it.
- It's a star.
-  What do you see?
-  A star!
- So guys, what we're gonna make today
is a fruit Christmas tree.
(kids exclaiming excitedly)
So you're gonna decorate
using these fruits,
a fun Christmas tree.
So everybody's gonna get a cone
and then I got a buncha toothpicks.
And then you choose,
you can do whatever kind
of a pattern you like.
I think it's gonna be easier
to put the toothpick in first
and then hang the fruit on it.
- Okay, I'll do that.
- These smell good.
- Yummy.
Our kitchen actually
smells amazing right now
with all this fresh fruit.
- What's cool is I don't mind snacking
while we're doing it either.
-  You can do
a grateful raspberry.
- I got the star on top!
I'm grateful for music.
-  Good one.
- I'm grateful for pineapple.
Then we do this and then I'm gonna...
-  I think Caleb's
eating more than he's decorating.
- No.
I only ate two so far.
-  This is awesome.
- This cookie.
-  I saw that.
-  I like it.
(all laughing)
- I decorated this much in 830.
-  How's it coming Caleb?
- Good.
- I'm making legs.
-  To help it stand up?
- Um hmm.
-  So Laura, what
kinda fruit's your favorite?
- Raspberry.
-  Raspberries are your favorite?
-  It looks like you like grapes.
- It does look like you like grapes.
Maybe she's eating all the raspberries
and putting all the grapes on.
Caleb and Laura have finished theirs up.
I'll show ya how they turned out.
Caleb's got two stars at the top.
-  Mine's about to fall over.
-  You guys are doing awesome.
- I'm not that quite done.
-  Yeah, you are
packing a ton of fruit in there.
- I love fruit.
-  Isaac's trying a star fruit.
- Crunchy.
It's really, really, it's different.
-  It's different?
- I love it.
-  You love it?
- Uh huh.
- So what's it similar to?
- Nothing.
- It's similar to nothing?
Is it closer to an apple
or a banana or an orange?
- It's mostly like pineapples and mangos
but it's not much like anything.
-  Lise are you gonna be able
to eat your Christmas tree?
- Yeah.
Just a little bit of Dad's help.
-  Oh I bet Dad will be helpful.
So here's our finished Christmas trees.
- You guys did great.
-  Guess which one's mine Dad.
-  So you can have one of mine.
-  Oh there's
two stars on this one.
Do you eat the outside?
-  Isaac did.
- It tastes kinda like candy.
-  What fruit
would you compare it to?
- Sweet tarts.
That's what it tastes like to me.
(child babbles)
- Hey Laura, you can grab it.
It's a bag!
Yes!
So we're pretty excited about these bags.
They are not Christmas presents.
Jeremy and I have decided
to learn how to online shop for clothes,
because we never have the clothes we need
and we never have the time to go shopping.
So these bags are full of clothes
that Jeremy and I get to try on.
-  We'll see if it worked.
-  So we bought
loads of things for Jeremy.
This is gonna be fun.
(bright music)
I'm trying a new dinner tonight.
It's called pork chili verde.
And I'm serving it over rice.
And yeah, we'll see how it turns out.
It smells good.
Okay here's the pork chili verde
and we're going to eat it on top of rice.
(upbeat music)
(record scratching)
(Kendra laughs)
- Kendra's saying that a
higher line on the pants
is coming in.
I just don't know if I like this style.
- Don't blame this on me.
This is definitely not his style.
So we're trying on the pants
and the length of them all feels long.
And I'm like Jeremy
maybe you're supposed to
wear them up higher.
And so now the length feels right
but look how high Jeremy
had to hike up that waist.
(Jeremy mutters)
This is just wrong.
Oh my goodness.
- So we're testing out the
different kinds of cuts.
So there's athletic and
slim and straight leg
and some really aren't working.
But I like these.
These are the slim cut.
-  Snuggling?
- Goodnight.
J House out.
(upbeat music)
-  This is gonna end bad.
- Laura made me a necklace.
(Janae babbles)
-  Lise's cartwheel.
(Kendra cheers)
- I forgot my um, shoes.
- Shoes, 'kay?
No shoes.
