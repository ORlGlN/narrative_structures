so we just got back or exhausted and
we're locked out of our house we're
saying goodbye to this little person
Jimmy oh so much
Hevy
good morning we are finishing up our big
trip here in Arizona and we are flying
home to Kansas City today it's always
kind of hard to leave like we love being
with our family and it's also nice to
know we're returning home to friends and
our own beds and our own routines and so
there's a piece of me that's excited and
a piece of me that's sad but mostly I'm
hoping that our trip traveling home goes
quicker than our trip traveling here
which it pretty much has to right
doesn't look like any tornadoes tonight
anyway so hopefully it's a safe place
maybe
the shuttle is the hard part because we
have to let go of a cart so everybody's
got their bags they're carrying which
does look
time to go through security
oh that was you Jeremy the machine go
ahead
made it through security so I'm glad we
got here early enough to pick up some
food before we take off because we're
getting home around dinnertime but we're
leaving before lunch today
there's our plane let's board
Laurie get mama Kay
daddy's carrying all of our stuff back
there
he's the friendly neighborhood packing
seven people
okay let's take a big step
the car seems the hardest part
we decided this time to only bring one
car seat instead of two hopefully that
works out
are we gonna go up high in the airplane
come on hey you can't drive the airplane
silly-billy back to the pilot your comic
and our airplanes are awesome I love
that they're designed they have a
plug-in right here at each seat
smart is this
Oh
being nervous about finding know which
party most excited about going home
going home uh-huh and drinking so does
Alaura where we go in we are we're gonna
fly but where are we going again
we're going home okay
we got me
tell me we are going
okay sure yeah yeah nope we're not there
yet Laura we haven't even left yet
you're ready for takeoff
are we going higher in the air but am I
thinking
go
way to go to our house
all right what we did it we survived not
just drive home we can do this oh come
on it's not that bad
so we just got back we're exhausted and
we're locked out of our house the garage
entry keypad won't work and we don't
usually rely on that usually we carry a
house key with us but this time because
of a long string of events we ended up
giving our car keys to our
brother-in-law to do something and so
our car keys are also locked inside of
there and our house key is too so we
have no way to get into our house
jeromy's trying to break in breaking I
feel he locked all the windows I mean I
think we don't want everything locked
that door is the door locked
yeah
I think that the to button isn't working
that's my hypothesis so maybe we
shouldn't have made her password
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu yeah so we are going
to head back to my sister-in-law's house
and then I think Jeremy's going to call
a locksmith because what else do you do
when you're locked out of your house I'm
feeling really bummed like we've never
traveled without our house key before
and in like the chaos of the tornado and
leaving we just handed our car keys and
I'm tired so we can see inside oh we
have one of those hidden keys somewhere
but we don't so Michelle's family was
heading swimming so I figured why not
we'll just come join them that way you
know we're having fun while Jeremy's
figuring out what to do at the door holy
Isaac is the water cold
well Jeremy just called and he got into
our house so I can't wait to hear all
the details about it but I'm just glad
to know he's driving here to pick us up
so what ended up happening was Kendra's
dad papa
he called and he was like you know
Jeremy you probably should just change
the battery in the keypad and I didn't
think that we needed to do that because
I could see red lights shining in the
keypad every time we were touching
buttons so I didn't think that the
battery would need to be changed but I
took his advice I went to a neighbor got
a new battery and the garage door opened
up so Thank You papa
I had a locksmith actually coming to the
house at that time it was going to be
like 80 bucks to get them to break into
our house so Popeye oh yeah like 80
bucks thanks for the advice I am so
excited to be home and inside we have
not gone in yet we're in the garage this
will be our first steps into the house
locked do we have keys we have the key
now here is the key please no more
problems we want to go inside oh I can
do it
my older sister Tiffany is an actual
yoga instructor so she's going to show
us how to do it and I'm also excited
because Jeremy's doing it with us I'm
getting into the mood
