- Well, we love our rental
house but we are having
one issue with it.
- So, we're at a museum
with the Ballingers.
(child babbling)
(upbeat music)
-  Good morning.
-  Good morning.
-  What's the weather
like today, Ms. Laura?
- Cold.
It's raining outside right now.
-  Where were we going to go today?
- The zoo.
It's world famous.
-  It is world famous.
We'll have to go another
day, maybe tomorrow.
School time.
Macy's working on a math test.
- It's hard.
- Isaac is working on spelling dictation.
We are having quite the
rain and windstorm today.
It's calm at the moment but
this morning, early morning,
it was crazy out there.
It woke all us up, like
the sound of the wind.
Anyway, on a positive
note, that means it's only
like 7:30 and we're all
dressed and ready for the day
and doing our school work and
already have eaten breakfast.
- I am making a person that is edible.
- Oh, that can make me pretty!
-  What are you making?
- Some relish bakeoff?
- Time's up.
- So I made this thing.
-  What is it?
- It's the ocean.
- Well we love our rental
house, but we are having
one issue with it and that is the stove.
It is really not working very well.
It's not heating things up.
It kind of warms things but
it doesn't get really hot,
which is kinda the purpose of a stove.
So we ended up contacting
the people that we're
renting from and they were amazing.
They got right back to
us and they apologized
for the inconvenience.
We're like, "It's not a big deal,"
but they're sending a technician out
to look at it this morning.
So, hopefully that'll get
fixed because we do plan on
cooking a lot while we stay here.
Cleaning up the Playdoh mess?
- Yep.
-  Good job.
(upbeat music)
-  Looks like there
might be sun coming out.
- The sun'll come out this afternoon.
Bet your bottom dollar
that there'll be sun.
- So with Kendra's beautiful song,
our kids just signed
up for the play, Annie.
They're gonna be doing it this summer with
one of the local theaters.
They haven't even seen it yet
but they're excited about it.
- But you have to be six and up.
-  Yeah so, unfortunately,
Laura is just gonna
get to watch with me!
(soft music)
- The traffic is a little bad,
but not that much.
Always remembering my mom
and dad are nice, nice, nice.
Sometimes they're angry
and sometimes they're not.
So, I love mom and dad.
And this is my end of the song.
(light music)
- No truer words were ever spoken.
Did you hear in Laura's song
that Mom and Dad are nice
but sometimes they are angry?
Yeah, that's real life.
Real life parenting right there.
We are driving right now to meet up with
the Ballinger family.
We're really excited
they came to play with us
for a couple days here in San Diego
and we love their family.
They're a home schooling family like us.
They've got four kids,
we've got five kids.
Play really well together.
The parents are awesome.
Basically it's just really
fun to be able to see friends
who you don't get to see very often.
We live in different parts of the country.
So this is a real treat for our family.
- I'm gonna put an iCard right here
to the Ballinger family
so you can check them out.
- We're sure that you're gonna
love them just like we do.
-  The reunion.
(kids screaming)
(parents laughing)
- Hey Mark, how are ya?
Let's do it.
Release the minions.
- So, we're at a museum
with the Ballingers.
(upbeat music)
- How are they on the exact same metal?
How does this do it?
-  There's
lightning in the thunder.
-  Thunder, feel the thunder.
-  Well, we have two blocks here.
-  Which one's warmer?
- This one's cold.
- This one's warm.
- This one's warmer.
-  If I put ice
cubes on each of the blocks,
where do you think it's gonna melt faster?
- On here.
-  The warm one?
- How does that one do that?
-  Isn't that crazy?
Why would it be melting on the cold one
rather than the warm one?
What do you guys think?
- That one's metal.
-  What did you say?
- Metal.
-  Metal?
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun!
You are right!
-  You are right.
This is metal.
What affects heat transfer is
the material of the object.
(upbeat music)
-  It's standing all on it's own.
Duncan and Jenae.
The babies meet.
- We're making a Golden Gate Bridge.
-  A bridge?
(upbeat music)
The bridge is completed.
Almost!
Rebuild.
I love it.
- Kid City, five and under.
Caleb is so happy that he
is still five years old
'cause this place looks fun.
-  Whoa.
- Basket, basket.
-  Look, you're bringin' em down.
You drivin'?
On your mark, get set, go.
Best part of my day, that was amazing.
There you go, Elise!
-  Look at that!
-  Try it again,
try to get the spring.
-  I can't get it.
Is there anything wrong with me?
Wait, is it just light reflected?
-  Let's read what's going on here.
- There's the spring!
-  You found it?
- Yeah!
-  Where is it?
- It's right here!
-  Is it underneath?
-  Yeah, right here!
-  You're grabbing
it, you actually got it.
-  There's the
camera that's making it.
-  Have you figured it out yet?
-  No.
-  So you can
actually grab the spring.
You can actually find it.
- I found it, it's down here.
I'm shaking it.
- I know there's something
to this, but this really
just looks like a spring.
-  Grab it.
- I can't!
How is that?
I mean, there's a mirror.
Look and then it makes
your hand look upside down.
-  Get set, go.
Whoa!
- Mine is still going!
-  The blue one's coming!
(upbeat music)
-  Alright, now push the red button.
Showing how solar power works.
Nice.
Oh!
He's trying to do
one-handed cartwheels 'cause
Parker can do one-handed cartwheels.
(light music)
-  Okay everybody,
look up here and smile!
And Duncan, big smile!
Big smile!
(kids humming song)
- We just made it home and
we have a brand new stove.
Look at this!
It's all shiny, better keep that clean.
- I like it!
-  It's new.
Who's coming over?
- The Ballingers.
-  What are we gonna eat?
- Pizza party.
- Yes!
So we're not using the stove tonight.
We are ordering pizza and
the Ballingers are coming
and we're gonna hang out.
When you have a lot of kids,
sometimes the easiest place
to hang out is just at home.
So we considered going
to a restaurant together,
but here, the kids can just run and play.
-  Laura, you playing with Duncan?
- Yeah.
(baby babbling)
-  Hey, what are you guys playing?
- Pass him this, it's Caleb's turn.
(kids laughing)
-  You guys playing Old Fellow?
What is this game?
- Checkers.
- Checkers.
- I'm losing.
-  That's okay.
Are you having fun?
- Yep!
- Yeah.
- So we came back to our place.
We had pizza and we have just been talking
and hanging out and the kids
have been playing games.
We're just chillin'.
Anyway, we have had a long
day and we've had so much fun
with the Ballingers.
- We're gonna do it again tomorrow.
- Oh yeah, we're going to
the zoo tomorrow hopefully.
- To the zoo, zoo, zoo.
How 'bout you, you, you?
We're goin' to the zoo, zoo, zoo.
You can come too.
- Once she starts singing, I'm just like,
put it on her and see what happens.
And it's normally magical.
- Goodnight, Jacob's out.
- Don't tell Mommy.
- So I thought I'd give
you guys a quick tour.
Check out this view
while we're doing dishes.
(upbeat music)
-  He's gonna make it.
You lost it!
