-  This was discusting.
-  Elise, what
happened to your glasses?
- Jenae broke them.
(laughter)
- Yay!
(upbeat music)
She's dancing.
Best way to start the day off.
There it is.
Yeah, dancing while eating breakfast.
So I think Pentatonix is my favorite
Christmas music this year.
Sometimes I love Josh Grobin,
kind of a different style.
When I was growing up we had a
Beach Boys Christmas that I loved.
Let us know in the comments what Christmas
music you love listening to.
- Daddy.
(guitar music)
- So the church we go to
doesn't have a paid ministry.
Everything is done by volunteer
including cleaning the church.
Alright you guys, this is our task.
We're gonna clean the
outside of the church.
Pick up any trash.
Alright, we gotta start
putting trash in that bag.
(rock music)
Good job team.
Let's see if there's other
stuff we can do to help clean.
So Elise, what happened to your glasses?
- Oh Jenae broke them.
-  So how are you
keeping the glasses on?
- I just hook it onto my ears, my hair
when I have a ponytail.
-  Nice.
Pick it up and throw it in.
There you go.
Okay, watch out, this
one's just papertowels.
Go ahead Isaac.
Yeah!
If it has water in it and stuff.
Nice!
(techno music)
So we were able to go
to a friend's baptism
and I had been asked
to give a talk for it.
It was a good experience.
It's good to think about my baptism
and thinking about those kinds of things
just always brings peace
to my life and my day.
- When you help a baby
you just tear one piece.
- So we're watching
our kid's gift exchange
from a couple years ago.
So fun to see how little the kids are.
(laughter)
I'm so grateful that we've
captured these memories.
- So today we're working
on one of my favorite
Christmas traditions which is getting
ready for the kid's gift exchange.
What we do in our family is in December,
the kids all work to earn money.
Then we go to the Dollar Store
and they buy gifts for each other.
I love seeing them
thinking about each other
and working hard to earn money
and seeing the joy of
giving in their eyes.
Today we're doing some
deep cleaning chores
so the kids can earn some of their money.
This was discusting and
now it's getting all clean.
- Look at right there.
-  Yeah, good job.
-  Thanks big girl.
(upbeat music)
- I actually all gotta get like the stuff-
-  The gunk under the table.
Good job cleaning.
Hello.
-  Are you little Minnie Mouse.
She's trying to get it off,
she can't figure it out.
Thanks, I'll get it.
She's like, what was that?
Nailed it, good job.
Now shut the dress up thing.
(guitar music)
- This is a fun job.
-  I'm glad you like it.
(guitar music)
Caleb is cleaning off
all of our condiment jars
and containers.
So I just came to this spot in our fridge
and I'm feeling like this is
a little bit embarrassing.
What do you think?
- I think we should keep it just in case
we run out of all of this.
-  Just in case.
So when we have more than we need,
we just dump it into this spot.
I'm just feeling like this
is a little ridiculous.
I don't wanna throw it away
though, it's good ketchup.
Yeah.
-  Laura, you cleaning the van?
- This is not supposed to be in here?
-  Oh no that is look.
It makes it smell good when
it smells funky in here.
Watch.
Smell.
That's an air freshener.
- Can I do it?
-  You can spray one or two.
Well this week is supposed to be the last
little bit of warm weather.
We're enjoying it.
Look at the blue skies.
(guitar music)
-  Good job.
So right now we're kind of all divided up.
We're working in teams.
Caleb and I are finishing
cleaning up the refrigerator.
Isaac and Laura are cleaning
out the van and garage.
Leesy is helping us by
watching Jenae at the moment,
she's taking her turn.
And Jeremy is working on his office.
(upbeat music)
(piano music)
- Feels good to have everything so clean.
To celebrate cleaning up
we're going to partake
of some of the popcorn
our neighbors sent us.
(guitar music)
- I like the caramel more.
But the cheddar's really good.
-  What do you think Laura?
- I'm gonna go inside.
-  You're gonna go inside?
Okay.
- Daddy, which one do you like?
-  I think I
like the caramel better.
- Yeah.
- Look who woke up from her nap.
Nae-nae, who is it?
Who is that?
- Well since Elise's glasses broke,
it's time to order a new pair.
So we have to decide on the style.
We're ordering them online.
So they've got a picture
of Elise that we can try
the different glasses on.
Do you know what kind
you're wanting this time?
- Skinny.
-  These are some of the ones
that we've favorited as
we're looking through them.
Can we try this one Leese?
-  I kind of wanted the
front to be just one color.
-  So you
prefer it when the front
is just one color?
-  Yep.
-  So not this one.
These ones are light blue.
-  I like them pretty much.
-  I think those
are pretty cute on you.
So this one's mostly clear.
What do you think of that one Leesy?
- It's not really my favorite.
- Okay, let's try another one.
Alright, we found some skinny pink ones.
-  Do you think it looks good?
-  I think it's pretty cute.
What do you think?
-  I like it.
I like it but I don't know
which color to choice.
I want something different.
I like the blue.
Actually, kind of want the blue.
- You think so?
Blue's your favorite color now.
- There's another one that has flowers.
-  So this one
has flowers on the side
instead of Hello Kitty.
How do you feel about that one?
- Happy!
-  Okay, let's try it on.
-  Yes!
-  It's the perfect frame.
-  We did it.
- I'm gonna get it.
- Yes, we found them.
So we were very, very excited
and relieaved to find those.
So we'll give them a try.
- Thanks for checking.
- No problem, hopefully
they get here soon.
Jeremy and I are headed
out on a date night
and the babysitters are here.
Jenae is showing off for them
and she is walking with the little walker.
- I have to get my clothes on.
-  She's going to town.
What!
Oh my goodness.
Whoa, yay!
So this morning I saw Jenae
take three steps in a row
with this little walker thingymabob.
Now she's booking it.
Oh my goodness, this is going too fast.
Are you wanting the tree?
Yeah.
The transformation is complete.
- Almost, I gotta get shoes on.
-  What do you think?
She's excited about it.
I know I'm biased, but I
think she's the cutest baby.
Oh my goodness, I said that about
all my kids when they were babies.
(screaming)
Come to mama.
-  Here it comes.
Yay!
- So the kids haven't seen
Jenae's new trick yet.
Ready?
(giggles)
Look at her go.
(applause)
She's still going.
- She did it!
(applause}
-  Isn't that so cute?
She is loving this and
she's so proud of herself.
She just wants to do it more.
-  Clap!
She's like, just put me down.
(laughter)
(upbeat music)
- So we're cutting our datenight
a little bit short tonight
because Jeremy's getting to go do
something with his brothers.
- We're gonna go to Star Wars, the movie.
- It's true, so he and I had dinner.
Now are just-
- Kendra was super nice too,
she's all encouraging me to go.
She's like you should go.
Wife points.
- He's gonna love it,
yes I got some points.
So now we're at Target.
Where else would we be?
- As soon as we're done vlogging,
Kendra celebrated that she
tricked me to not get a cart.
It's like an ongoing thing between us.
She never thinks we need a cart,
but then we always do need a cart.
So I'm getting a cart.
- So check this out, it
says indulgent snack mix.
I could get behind that, like trail mix,
no I don't like that, but
this an indulgent snack mix.
It's got all these yummy different kinds.
-  There's
like chocolate in there.
- Yeah, chocolate cashews.
Everything in there's good.
-  Tis the season.
- I always wanted one of these.
It'd be so fun.
Oh look!
-  Don't we have
an electric one of those?
- We don't, well we have
a big standup mixer,
but that's just so fun.
Look at this.
I think Jenae needs this in her life.
We found the wrapping paper.
-  We need some.
That's a lot of wrapping paper.
- Over here.
- Whoa!
-  Good night, J House out.
-  This is just
wrong, oh my goodness.
(techno music)
- You guys what we're gonna make today
is a fruit Christmas tree.
(techno music)
