-  Basketball on skates.
(upbeat music)
- We have food and we are somewhere fun
and it's gonna be bedtime any minute.
(soft music)
So today is the big day.
We are suppose to be flying to San Diego.
We've got our bags pack and
now Jenae is throwing up.
It's so sad when a little baby throws up
'cause they don't know what's going on.
She just like cries.
Ugh, it's so sad.
Anyway, we don't know what we're
going to do about our trip.
Our flight is later this afternoon
so we still have time that if
she doesn't throw up again,
we might be okay because stomach bugs
can pass pretty quickly
and she was throwing up in the nighttime.
Or the other option is
that Jeremy will go ahead
with all the other kids and
Jenae and I will stay here
until she's healthy and then fly out.
It's hard because we keep hoping
that she's gonna be getting better
but then she throws up again,.
It's so hard to see your
baby in pain like that
and not feeling good.
The timing is terrible.
- We're ice skating.
(orchestra music)
-  How's it goin'?
- Good.
-  Did you guys
build somethin' awesome?
Let's see it, stick the marbles in.
- See, it jumps into there.
-  That's cool.
- Just weird with the shadows.
-  Shadows are kind of cool, huh.
- Yeah.
I'm in a sunny spot 'cause I'm cold.
-  Do you know what
the most important thing is
for some of the best
scientists in the world?
Observation.
Just looking at the
world, looking at shadows,
looking at nature.
- Really?
-  Yeah, really.
I think it's so cool that
you're observing your shadow.
- I normally just look out the window.
- So I saw the greatest thing ever.
Naenae is acting happy.
- She took a little nap.
-  And she ate a little bit.
- She ate a tiny bit so we're waiting
to see if she'll keep that down
and then I can feed her some more.
(baby grunting and cooing)
She just wants to go out
and play with the kids,
but I'm nervous about that.
(playful piano music)
-  I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you, hey stinky.
- I think, I think this might work.
- Hi. (kissing)
- With the long travel day
we're trying to get the kids
get their wiggles out and use
up some energy being active
as much as possible.
So we pulled the cars out
of the garage one last time.
- We're playing basketball.
-  Basketball on skates?
- Yep.
-  Okay, let's see it.
(hip hop music)
Good job, Kaleb.
Whoa, that was (mumbling).
You guys, think of how much
better you are at skating now
from the first day.
- Hey Reesey.
- Hey what?
- Show us how to get down.
- No way.
- Show us how to get down.
- Okay.
- D-O-W-N, that's the way to get down.
D-O-W-N, that's the way to get down.
-  What do you
think Nae-na-na-nae?
- Laura.
- Hey what?
- Show us how to get down.
- No way.
- Show us how to get down.
- Okay.
- D-O-W-N, that's the way to get down.
D-O-W-N, that's the way to get down.
- So Elise is looking at this.
Is it a puzzle?
-  Uh huh.
-  She's looking at this puzzle
and she started singing this song.
Wait how does it--
♪ Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas ♪
♪ California, Colorado, Connecticut ♪
♪ Doo, doo, doo ♪
♪ Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho ♪
♪ Illinois, Indiana, Owia, Kansas ♪
- So anyway, her starting
to sing this reminded me
of this video we have.
We posted it, it was filmed
before we ever started Vlogging.
I think it's when you're three years old.
♪ Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas ♪

Cici drove us to the airport
and now we get to unload everything.
♪ Let's begin now ♪
Okay, I know that looked
like a ton of luggage
and it was we have five ginormous bags
and we're taking three car seats
and it's just a lot to pack.
I'm actually feeling pretty
proud of myself about it
because there are seven
of us in our family.
We're gonna be gone for a full month.
We needed all of our homeschool stuff.
I've got their math stuff
and their spelling stuff.
Two of the girls are having
birthdays while we're gone,
so I've got their birthday stuff.
There's just a lot to fit in.
We did it.
-  (laughing) You're last.
Kaleb.
I beat you guys.
(upbeat music)
Jenae found a dog.
Hey.
You guys ready to get on the airplane?
- Yeah, we're goin' to San Diego.
- So I got this teething necklace.
She is loving it.
-  It's a good idea
'cause we didn't want
to drop a teething toy.
- Yes, I like that it's attached to me
so it's not always falling on the ground.
- I declare a thumb war.
Five, six, seven, eight
Have to keep your fingers straight.
(upbeat music)
-  You guys playing tic-tac-toe?
Are you Xs or Os?
- She's normally both.
-  Really she's?
(laughing) That was quite the yawn.
-  She want's
to see out the window.
(salsa music)
This is a very busy airport right now.
- So this is always the
hardest part of our trip.
It's getting the baggage and
making it to the rental car.
Poor Jeremy is the pack mule.
-  Naenae is exploring
our new rental house.
- I think this place is perfect.
- It is really adorable.
Kendra just asked if I'm trying the wifi.
Anytime we go stay
somewhere for a long time
whether or not it has good
wifi makes a big difference
for uploading videos.
- Well the weather here's amazing.
I'm in a short-sleeved
shirt and flip flops.
The last hour or so we spent
settling into our rental house
and I really like it.
It's got character.
It's layout is fun and
unique and the outdoor space.
Oh, it's just beautiful.
Alright, let's do this.
(upbeat music)
- Where's the trash?
-  Underneath the sink, I believe.
- So it's passed 10 pm, Kansas City time.
Our kids are starting to melt down
but we haven't really had dinner.
It's a crazy night.
- But we have food and
we are somewhere fun.
It's gonna be bedtime any minute.
Well the kids are finally asleep
and I am completely exhausted,
but I'm so grateful to be here.
The rental house is beautiful.
I can't wait to show you guys all of it
when the light is out in the daytime.
We're just excited.
We're looking forward to our month
that we get to spend here in San Diego.
I'm also just feeling
really, really grateful.
This morning started out pretty rough.
Jenae had thrown up in the night time
and then this morning she
threw up twice all over me.
She was just really, really miserable.
I spent most the morning just holding her,
trying to comfort her
any way that I could.
Jeremy gathered the kids
together and they prayed.
They prayed that Jenae could get better
so we could all travel together
because the thought of
traveling with throwing up baby
wouldn't be fun for her or me
or everyone else on the airplane.
We were seriously discussing
delaying our flight.
Jeremy and I prayed for her
and I know my parents
were praying for her.
Sometimes it amazes me that God cares
about the little things.
I'm just feeling really grateful.
-  Good night to yourself.
- The house looked like it has blown up.
-  Say goodbye to Granny Joe.
- Move your body.
- I'm going to show you somethin'.
-  She's dancing, she's dancing.
- Can we tell them where we're going?
We're going to--
(piano music)
