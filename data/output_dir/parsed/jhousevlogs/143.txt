-  You guys want to see what came?
It's all your Halloween costumes.
-  Yeah!
(lively electronic music)
(Jeremy laughs)
(yells)
(funky electronic music)
-  Thanks for being a hard-worker.
- Can you help me?
-  Yeah, of course I'll help you.
- That's mine.
This one's mine.
(gentle guitar music)
(cascading toys)
- She loves those toys.
- This morning, we're doing a
fun family project together.
Jeremy and the kids are
going to build a website.
- We're going to make our own website?
- What do you guys think about
us having our own website?
- Could people go to it?
- Yeah for sure.
People who watch our
videos could go there.
It's gonna be at Jhousevlogs.com.
- So with Jeremy and his
brother Brent having recently
started a law firm together,
they needed a website,
and so they looked around at
all these different options
and they decide to use Wix.
Then Wix shouted out to
us to sponsor this video
so that we could build our
own J House Vlogs website.
And we were so excited about it,
because we had already used this process.
And it was super user friendly and easy.
- I'm literally so excited.
- Welcome to Wix.
- Alright so this is the editor.
Okay, so we found the
template that we want to use.
Now Isaac, do you want to
help me with the next part?
- Yeah.
-  You can make
it say J House Vlogs.
And you hit apply.
- Apply, hey this is easy.
- so we want to have Janae, replace image.
- Yep.
So we just changed the image they had
with one from our Instagram feed.
- Now let's go back.
- There it is.
Alright, should we do
that to the next one?
- I'm gonna get this one.
- Oh the sassy pants one of Mom?
- Uh-huh.
-  Uh-oh, there's a
sassy pants one of me on there?
-  You have like
food all over your shirt.
-  No poop.
- Oh is that poop?
- No I have poop.
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Let's do the one
with poop on Mom's shirt, okay?
Hit apply.
- Family friendly.
- It's on there.
(laughing)
Alright number eight.
- So we're showing this
to the kids right now
and letting them help,
but I honestly can't wait
to get my hands on it
and have some fun.
I think I could play on
this thing for hours.
- Yeah.
Get in here buddy.
-  Yeah, click right there Cubby.
-  Now we can see
what it would look like
on a phone.
Oh right here?
- Yeah, show that.
- Okay watch this.
-  What?
- Now if you click on that link
it goes to J House Vlogs.
- And now we're in.
- What?
- Now there's an easier way
to get to J House Vlogs.
-  So now I think
you can drag it Elise,
to where you want to put it.
- Let's try putting it up over here.
There you go, you're shrinking it.
- Who added that on?
- The J House?
That was Elise.
- Great job, I like it.
(gasps)
-  It did it.
It just pulled up all
of our YouTube videos.
All I had to do was enter in our username.
- So Laura was gone at a
play date this morning,
and now Elise is gonna
show her what we made
while she was gone.
- We made a website.
(gasps)
- Janae just took a long nap.
-  Do you want to see our website.
(laughing)
(blowing raspberries)
That's what she things of that.
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Which one do you want to watch?
- It has everything single one?
- It has everything.
- What?
-  Let's do this one.
Watch this.
(laughs)
(accelerating music)
- We'd like to thank Wix
for reaching out to us
and sponsoring this video today.
It was really fun to create
this website as a family.
We're excited to continue working on it
and show it to all of you.
- So we put the link
in the description box
to Wix.com, so you can
build your own website.
You can also go to jhousevlogs.com,
to see what we made.
(lively guitar music)
- Ow ma ma ma.
- Hi hi.
(baby babbling)
- Good job, oh.
(blowing raspberries)
(laughing)
-  Lunch today is leftovers.
-  But it's still good.
- This is my life.
I'm nursing Janae.
I was reading a book to Laura.
I'm correcting Caleb's reading work.
Isaac comes in to tell me
about a new sport he invented.
And Elise came in to
tell me all about a show.
- Welcome to motherhood
with five children.
-  So Elise just
sat down with her notebook
and the little sequins are making
this pretty pattern everywhere.
- Whoa.
- Dude.
-  Isaac look.
(laughing)
- From the sun, it's making it bright.
- Get it.
Get it.
(yelling)
Get it.
(yelling)
(laughing)
- So now that the kids have
discovered this lighting effect,
they want to put on a show.
Laura is being Elsa
and Elise, are you Cinderella?
-  Yes.
- I have to do my make-up, just pretend.
-  She's got to do her make-up.
- Yeah, but then I'll come back,
but don't start it, okay?
(elegant orchestral music)
-  She's ready (laughs).
- Presenting Elsa!
-  Yay!
(cheering)
- Dun dun dun,
♫ It's funny how some distance
♫ Make everything seem small
♫ And the fears that
- What is this?
- A ring.
- Do you want me to get married to you?
Yes.
- You love me.
- And we're so happy
to be with each other.
(laughing)
- Uh-ma.
(Jeremy laughs)
- Uh-ma.
(laughing)
- She's so cute with that.
- Ah-Ya.
(laughing)
- Ma.
(laughing)
- So I just checked the
mail and we got a box.
And I'm excited about it,
because what's inside the
box, here I'll show you,
is our Halloween costumes.
I let the kids each choose
what they wanted to be.
Alright, do you guys
want to see what came?
It's all your Halloween costumes.
-  Yeah!
- Here you go Isaac.
(laughing)
- Yeah!
(roars)
- Caleb.
- Oh my tie.
-  Laura.
(squeals)
-  Lise.
- Yes!
- How does it work?
- I don't know we're gonna
have to figure it out.
What's the necklace's name?
- The Heart of Te Fiti.
- Is it the Heart of Te Fiti?
(bright music)
- Whoa.
-  Is that fun?
- Yeah.
- Woo.
(laughing)
- Woo.
It's so pretty.
Moana.
- Who are you gonna be?
- Harry Potter.
- Okay, ready?
Let's see if we got the right robe.
- I like it.
- On real Halloween,
you're gonna have your
white shirt underneath.
(enchanting music)
- I like it.
- Wait, I know what we need
to complete the outfit.
Stand in front of the mirror.
- So this will go on
and then we just pull it up.
Looking good.
(funky beat music)
So Elise had been a
princess every year before,
but this year she wanted
to do something different.
- Yeah, I kind of felt
not princess-y anymore.
- Elise told me she wanted
to be something strong
for Halloween, because it
represents her personality
better, because she's strong.
What do you think, go look in the mirror.
-  You look so good.
- I think when my hair's down,
it'll look better.
-  Okay Elise,
we got to take it off.
- Ah I don't want to take it off.
-  It's fun, huh.
- Yeah.
- Halloween will come soon enough.
So I think I'm the most
nervous about Isaac's costume.
I really hope it fits.
The reviews were all over the place,
so we'll try it on him.
- I'm excited for this.
-  You should be,
your costume is hilarious.
- It was a great choice.
If your costume comes with a battery pack,
you're doing something right.
-  I'm excited.
-  Load it up.
-  Someone found something cool.
(boing)
That was a good one.
-  That was a good one.
(boing)
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Nice.
Good job.
So before we can blow this up,
Isaac has to climb inside.
Let's see if this one's the right size.
(playful music)
It works.
(laughing)
- Where did you go?
Your head's supposed to
come through here somehow.
-  There we go.
There he is.
There we go.
- This is like maybe Laura could fit in.
-  (laughs) It
does just barely peek out.
Let's just make sure
his nose and his mouth
can come through, so he can breathe.
-  Oh there, that's good.
- Think you can get
Okay, just a second,
we gotta figure out the head spot.
Okay just a second Isaac.
Hold your head still.
(laughing)
-  Yay, we figured it out.
- We figured it out.
(laughing)
The dancing dinosaur.
-  Alright, I
think we have the Halloween
costumes figured out.
- Yeah!
- I made the Halloween
decisions early this year,
so that I wouldn't have to
stress for the whole month.
But what I didn't realize is that now
that the decisions are made
and we've tried them on
and the kids are all excited about them,
now I get to look forward
to Halloween for a month.
So instead of dreading it for a month
and being stressed about it,
I get to look forward to it.
Like I need to be more decisive like this.

- You didn't read it so well.
- So this was the favorite book
Did she say I didn't read it so well?
-  Yeah.
- (laughs) I screwed it up.
This was Isaac's favorite book.
And so I read it with him,
and I then I did it with
Elise and Caleb and Laura.
And now, that was my first time
to ever read it to Janae Nae.
- Read it again.
