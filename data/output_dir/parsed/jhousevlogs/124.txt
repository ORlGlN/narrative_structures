- She's just fun, hi.
(laughing)
Caleb got kneed in almost his eye,
it's already swelling up.
-  This is hard.
-  My body hurts
just watching you guys.
- Pay me!
You owe us two dollars.
How's the cookie?
- Good.
(bright music)
-  Elise tried a new
hairdo all by herself today.
I think it looks so cute.
- And I put in a bobby pin all by myself.
- Time out.
We found a way that
everyone can participate
in the upcoming Service Celebration.
So many of you have reached out
and said you want to help,
but you live far from Kansas City.
So we're gonna be assembling hygiene kits
for Puerto Rico, is right Laura?
We're gonna be doing
1800 of them, so 1,800.
Each kit is $10 dollars.
And the way you can help, if you want,
is to help us with supporting funds.
Each kit is $10 dollars,
so that's $18,000 dollars
that we're trying to raise.
No pressure though,
if it's not something that you're able
to do, we understand.
We just wanted to give people a way
to participate, if they wanted to
and we appreciate any help you can give.
There's a link in the description box
and it goes to Heart to Heart,
they have a page specific
for our fundraiser,
of J House Vlogs and
we can reach that goal
of $18,00 dollars.
Thank you so much.
And we'll get you back
to the regular vlog.
Say time in.
- Time in.
-  Nice, turn around let's see it.
- So yeah, I figured out a
new hairdo that I can do.
-  That's fun,
especially with short hair.
It's fun to have different
things to mix it up.
- Uh-huh.
Normally I just do a little
ponytail right there.
-  The kids are
doing some morning stretches.
- I can go all the way down.
-  These two have been
trying to get to the splits.
- I can.
-  Almost.
- You want to see my splits?
-  Oh my goodness, my body hurts
just watching you guys.
Oh my goodness.
Here's the poll question for the day.
Can you do the splits
or did you used to be
able to do the splits?
Let us know in the poll.
Wow you guys be careful
with your bodies, okay?
But your pinky toe has to stay up.
-  You are so close Caleb.
- Ready and up.
Feet together, make sure
your feet are together
and your head is in touch with the ground.
-  Knees together.
Look at those bridges.
- I can't.
-  Hey can you guys
all do downward dog with Janae?
- Downward dog everybody, push your toes
and make sure your feet are together.
- Hey you.
So last night I had a terrible dream.
It was super scary
and anyway, I just kind
of woke up feeling nuh
about life, like it's
hard when you're sleeping
and the whole time you're like scared
and nervous and worried about stuff
and then you wake up
and it kind of affects
how you feel about the day.
So I'm trying to get into a good mood.
Working on it.
- Now we're gonna do push ups.
One two three.
- Four.
- 10.
(Kendra laughing)
-  Caleb, whatcha working on?
- I'm working on a map of my room.
- There we go, we're making a map.
- How do you spell desk?
-  How do you think?
- D-E-K-E?
-  D-E-de-ssk.
- D-E-S-K-E.
-  There's no E at the end.
D-E-S-K.
Good job, so is this
the key for your room?
- Mmm-mmm.
-  Elise, how's yours comin'?
- Pretty well.
-  Here's the
trampoline under water.
-  That's our trampoline
in our house, good job.
- Come on, who wants to go
on a map adventure with me?
(playful music)
- So I come in, and then
is that the laundry?
- Huh?
- Is that what that little
drawing of a shirt is?
Cool.
- And then the trash can.
- Right there.
And then you have a dresser.
Are these the windows?
- Yep.
-  So this is Caleb's
first map that he made.
And did it really work
to show where stuff was?
Nope, so what did we have to do?
- Try again.
- Try again, and then did it work?
So the kids are having a
fun time making their maps
and then testing them out
and so we come into the room
and we try to follow their map
and see if everything's where it should be
and then they go and make revisions
and changes, and it's really been
a really fun activity for the morning.
Here's Elise's map to her room.
Where's the door?
-  Right there.
-  Right there, good job.
- So here's the hamper
and then my dresser,
my bed and curtains.
- Good job, Elise this looks amazing.
I love that you drew
the little night light.
What did you think of drawing a map?
- It was pretty hard.
-  Well you did awesome,
I'm really proud of you.
Okay we just need to make
the key to go with the map.
- Well it just helps me design.
-  Ooh, do you
think you'd like design?
- Yeah.
(laughing)
-  You're just delightful.
Isn't she just fun, hey.
So Isaac and I have been struggling lately
that he's not as excited
about his writing assignments as I am.
So we decided to switch
things up a little bit
and today for his writing assignment,
he is writing an analytical article,
discussing the Kansas City Chiefs
and the Oakland Raiders
and that rivalry and digging into it
and he's really excited about it,
and he's still writing,
which is what I wanted in the first place.
A little bit of a Chiefs fan?
- No, a big Chiefs fan.
-  There we go.
Whatcha learning today?
- Rounding.
-  Rounding, do you like it?
- Yep, its easier than I thought.
-  Yeah.
It also helps, she's been eating
some round candy, to
help her with rounding.
Mean Isaac, he won't let you eat things
off the floor.
So today's one of those days
that's just not going according to plans.
Jeremy's had just a bunch of stuff come up
that was kind of frustrating
with some different work stuff,
and so he's been busy and preoccupied and
Oh Laura, stop.
That was Laura putting her hands in food.
Anyway, I feel like also
today's one of those days
where I just had these expectations
of things we were gonna be able to do
and the day has just gotten away from me.
- So I've had kind of a grumpy day.
But I'm gonna play Monopoly
Jr now with the kids
and that makes everything better.
So Laura, you rolled this dice,
you're first to go.
Six!
Awesome, so we're going this way,
one two three four five six.
- You're just visiting.
-  We're just
visiting in jail, perfect.
Alright Caleb you're up.
- Three.
-  Three,
Ooh you got a chance card, yes.
I am hungry, that looks good.
- So the boys were having
a friendly wrestling match,
which you know brothers do
and Caleb's face ended up getting
the bad end of that deal.
I'm so glad that didn't get your eye.
Buddy I'm so sorry.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah, let's keep some ice on it
for a few more minutes, okay?
- It's too cold.
-  Is the ice too cold?
- I wish I could play Monopoly Jr.
(sweet music)
- Well Isaac is reading to Caleb,
while Caleb sits and ices his face.
Caleb does not like to
put ice on his injuries.
He thinks it's too cold,
which I can understand it
is cold, ice is very cold.
- Let me see your eye.
- Ooh he's gonna land on something.
Pay me!
You owe us two dollars.
-  Laura, are you on Daddy's team?
What's your job?
- (yawning) To roll the dice.
(laughing)
- This game is so much fun.
Maybe Lise will roll a one
and she'll owe us two dollars two.
One!
Pay me two dollars.
-  Is everybody going swimming?
So here's dinner, it's a
baked chili and cornbread.
Yum.
- You owe him three dollars.
-  Isaac's at the pet store.
So what kind of pet did you decide to buy?
- A German shepherd or
a Labrador retriever.
- Nice.
- Ooh.
- One two three four.
- Thank you guys.
- We owe you three dollars.
- Caleb's pet store.
- Give three dollars to Cubby.
-  Hey Laura, what kind of a pet
are you gonna buy?
- A German shepherd.
(laughing)
- So Kendra showed the
kids a video this morning
about German shepherd puppies,
and so they've all been
thinking about that.
So Kendra had Famous Dave's corn bread
at a friend's house,
and she's been talking about it a lot,
so I'm glad we're gonna
finally get to try it.
-  It's so good.
- It smells good.
It smells more like cake.
-  Yeah exactly,
that's what makes it good.
There it is, should we
put some frosting on it?
-  Alright,
we're counting the money
to see who has the most.
Alright, how much do you have Cub?
- I have 20.
-  How much do you have Laura.
30, 31, 32, 33.
We won!
- Yay!
- Me and Laura.
-  The birthday boy's the winner.
(laughing)
- Yeah.
- Let's eat dinner.
This stuff is amazing.
It's so good.
- Puzzles.
-  Puzzles everywhere.
- Yeah, Laura really likes
pushing the pieces out,
she doesn't like putting
them back together so much.
So Caleb and Laura started the cookies,
but I definitely finished
making the cookies.
They needed some help,
and now we are going to
decorate them as a family.
- So we have some good friends
that are going through a hard time
and wanted to take them
some of the cookies
that we made tonight.
(bright music)
- Delicious.
- Ooh orange.
This is hard.
- Can you guys see the sprinkles?
- Yeah.
- What do they look like?
-  Spiders.
- Spider sprinkles.
- Hi.
- Hi, we have spider sprinkles.
(laughing)
- I got some on me.
-  Whoopsadaisies.
- We might have to keep all
the cookies she decorates.
-  It's like a jack-o-lantern.
-  There's a little ghost.
Laura's going for the modern art.
-  Picasso.
- Please can you get me.
- You're actually doing a really good job.
What do you think, is that good?
Laura that turned out so cute.
Are you gonna eat it?
-  I'm gonna give
this one away to a neighbor.
- Okay, so this one's for the neighbor.
And that one's for you?
Awesome.
-  How's the cookie?
- Good.
-  Okay I think all of
these turned out really fun,
but my favorite one is Jeremy's,
especially because he put it down talking
in a nice little pirate voice.
I was also excited that
we found some eyeballs.
Elise made a pumpkin smiley face.
Janae can you say good night?
Say J House out.
Goodnight, J House out.
(lively music)
- Quiet.
(golf stroke)
- Uh I got it, ah.
Whoa.
Socks!
