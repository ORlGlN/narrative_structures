-  Nae Nae, what's
your New Year's resolution?
(baby babbling)
- I think she wants to
learn to speak more words.
-  Maybe walk.
Can we go for potty train
or is that too early?
- No, we're not gonna
go for potty training.
- So my New Year's resolution
is to limit fear's power over me.
When I see opportunities
or when I feel like I should do something,
I don't want fear to be holding me back.
- I want to learn how to
change Nae Nae's diaper.
-  Oh, that's a great goal.
Caleb, did you accomplish
your New Year's resolution last year?
- Yeah.
I don't really remember it though.
-  Then how do
you know that you did it?
- I don't know.
-  Did you keep
your New Year's resolution
from last year?
- I don't remember mine.
-  What was your New
Year's resolution last year?
Oh, you weren't born yet, nevermind
- To be born.
To become a human.
-  You did it.
What's a talent you
wanna develop this year?
- I'd like to learn this girl is on fire
and practicing that song.
-  That's what
your goal is for this year?
What's a talent you
wanna develop this year?
- Getting better at rollerskating.
- Rollerblade.
- To get better at skating.
-  Where's a place
you wanna go this year?
- Chick-Fil-A for a lunch.
-  That's a good goal.
- Disney World, the
Magic Kingdom, Orlando.
- I have been wanting to go to Hawaii.
- I want to go anywhere.
I love adventuring and
exploring with my family
and I don't know exactly
where I want to go this year,
but I wanna go somewhere.
-  What do you
want to achieve this year?
- Do everything.
-  Do everything?
- Yes.
- Doing better hairstyles.
- I think I would like
to feel more at peace.
I feel like so often I'm living in chaos,
and I can't keep up.
And I want to kind of let go
of some of those expectations
and embrace more of the chaos
and hopefully feel more
peace in the midst of it.
I think I'm always trying to fix things
so that I can feel peace.
I would love to learn how to
have peace in the midst of it.
(baby babbling)
-  If you could have
one new experience this year,
what would it be?
- Going on a bigger rollercoaster.
- It can't be driving.
-  Not quite old enough to drive.
- I want to try sushi.
I've never tried sushi and I kind of feel
like I'm not an adult because
I've never tried sushi,
but I also don't know
if I wanna try it out
because raw fish sounds disgusting to me.
I can barely eat regular seafood
and so I just don't know
if I can do, but I want to.
'Cause I think I'll feel
like an actually grown-up
when I do.
-  What attribute do
you want to develop this year?
It's like what about your
personality or character
do you want to improve?
- I like Cinderella and everything.
I got the characters.
(Jeremy laughs)
-  What attribute
or characteristic
do you wanna develop better this year?
- Learning how to not react meanly.
-  Like try to
react with more kindness?
- Yeah.
- Being nicer to my siblings.
-  What attribute
or characteristic
are you working on this year?
(baby babbles)
- I would love to cultivate
optimism this year.
Optimism with the big things in life
and then the little things.
Some day I wanna be known
as an optimistic person.
And right now, honestly,
my first reaction to things
is usually stress and worry and anxiety.
And everything in life so
far that I've experienced
always needs up working out.
So I just want to practice more optimism.
Like you know, be a cheery person.
Oh, and gratitude.
-  How many books
you wanna read this year?
- About 15.
-  15 books?
- 14.
- 200 or something
'cause I wanna get really good at reading.
- About 200.
- 12 to 24 books this year.
Do you have any physical fitness
or health related goals this year?
- No, I don't think so.
- I wanna eat more fruits
and veggies and get stronger.
- To get my hands stronger
with the stuff I got for Christmas.
- I would love to weigh 15 pounds less.
- I have been struggling
to exercise consistently
and I love how I feel when I'm exercising.
So I need to get on that and
the thing that's always helped
with that is setting a goal with a race.
So this summer I would like to do
either a half marathon or a triathlon.
Something that sets a goal for me
so that I can actually
get better at exercising
and just feel better.
-  How do you decide
on a New Year's resolution?
- I don't know.
- Just thinking of what
other people can do
that I wanna get better at.
- If it'll help me in life.
-  How are you
gonna award yourself?
- What's award yourself?
-  Like what prize
are you gonna give yourself
or what present or treat are you gonna get
if you reach your goal?
- Candy.
-  What percentage
of people do you think
keep their New Year's resolutions?
- 60 people in the world.
-  60 total?
What advice would you give
to people who are trying
to make and keep their
New Year's resolutions?
- Candy, or you can pray.
- You should keep working on them.
- Just try to remember what it was.
- Don't forget your resolution.
- Well here's the advice that
I'm trying to give to myself.
I want to choose a specific goal.
Write it down, make it measurable
so that I can actually make some progress.
- We would love to see in the comments
