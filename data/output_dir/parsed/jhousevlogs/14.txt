(bright playful music)
- Nope.
- Eight, nine, ten!
Here I come.
- So our Saturdays lately
have been really busy,
running errands, taking kids to basketball
and other activities and we just wanted
to take some time today and really play
together as a family.
So today is Janae's first
game, hide and go seek.
Are you ready to be it?
Are you gonna find everybody?
(Janae babbling)
Where did they go?

other kids, where are they?
Nae Nae, come in.
Come see, what's inside?
Shoes, you see shoes?
Are there any people in here?
-  Nope.

but you led her to shoes.
- She was very happy about that.
- Nae Nae, look under the bed.
-  Hi.

Say I gotcha.

(laughing)
- She noticed the
curtain was kinda moving.
- Let's go find everyone else.
- She's like wait a minute.
There's nobody else in there.
(Caleb laughs)
Okay Janae let's look under the bed.
Is there anybody under there?
(playful suspenseful music)
-  She's looking.
-  Under the bed.
-  No one's under there.
- Alright, let's go to the next room.
So Janae's a little bit
nervous about the bathroom,
'cause the light's off.
Do you want to go in?
-  It's a little creepy.
(gasps)
(dramatic notes)
(laughing)
It's Laura.
You found 'em all.
- Good girl.
She found me.

Alright Laura, are you ready to be it?

Where could they be?
Do you want to come help?
Where haven't we looked yet?

(Jeremy laughs)

No (laughs).
-  No.
- No.
Where could you possibly hide?
Ah!

You were hiding good.
Alright who's left, Isaac and Laura.

(Laura laughing)
Did he find you?
- Yeah.
- Where is Isaac?
-  Alright, Isaac's the last one.
- Where is Isaac?
- He's probably in the bathroom.

- Not there.
-  Isaac's in a good hiding spot.
Come check harder in here.

-  Everybody's having
to get pretty creative now.
- I found you.
- I was under Caleb's bed.
- Oh my goodness, that was a good spot.
- I think someone's breathing.
(dramatic note)
I found you.
-  That was a good one Caleb.
- It's uncomfortable in there,
so I didn't really want
to stay in there long.
-  Yeah, good idea.
- Nope.
Isaac and Dad are left.
-  They're good hiders.
- Ah-ya!
-  Oh that was clever.
- Nope.
(laughing)
- Daddy scared her.

And I was right here.

- Now we have--
-  Isaac.
- Yes!
-  We gotta find Isaac.
- Isaac is good at hiding.
-  He's really good at hiding.
-  Looks like no
one's in the curtain.
(dramatic music)
- So we can't find Isaac.
All of us are looking.
- Let's look in the pantry.
-  Let's check it.
No.
-  Nobody wants
to hide by the trash.
-  Yeah, that's true.
- No.
- He's hid up here before but--
-  I looked, I looked for that.
This is a good hiding spot.
-  He must be
laughing so hard at us.
I bet he has a handle on how
much he's laughing right now.
-  Yeah.
'Cause all of us are looking
and we can't find him.
-  Did we check
behind the chair in our room?
That blue chair?
-  No.
-  Let's check, is he back here?
-  Nope.
- Maybe behind the pillows?
-  No.
I found him you guys.
I know where he is.
Go check in your room one more time.
(Jeremy laughs)
Shhh.
Okay you guys I'm gonna give you a hint.
He is in our room.
He's in this room.
- Isaac!
Isaac!
-  Genius.
- At first I was like gosh,
I gotta not let them see my body,
that's gonna be hard
and then I was like
oh, I have clothes too.
-  Okay, who would
like to play hide and go seek?
- Wherever your family is,
be sure to take a moment from the business
and enjoy time together
in some simple little way.
Good night, J House out.
(laughing)
(bright electronic music)
- Tyrannosaurus Rex is real, too.
-  Laura, are
you gonna do some art?
