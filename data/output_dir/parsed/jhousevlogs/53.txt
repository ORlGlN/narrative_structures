-  Laura, how does the
seashell let us hear the ocean?
- I don't know.
(upbeat music)
- She just did it again!
It's so cute and I'm losing my mind!
I'm making some last-minute purchases
to get ready for Elisa's birthday.
(upbeat music)
What are you working on?
- Mix and stir it.
-  So Laura has rocks
and all these sea animals
and what's in the water?
- Shaving cream.
-  The shaving cream
was what's in the water.
I just put a few dollops
of shaving cream in there.
What are you working on?
- I'm trying to sort all of these
and then look in the book
and see what these might have lived in it.
-  So let's see you sort them out.
There's lots of different
kinds of seashells, huh?
Those ones are teeny-tiny.
Look at how little those ones are.
-  Look what I found.
-  Those ones are really pretty.
- They're the same as these but littler.
-  Yep.
Did you find a match?
- Yeah, but what lives in this?
-  So the animal that used to live
in that seashell is called
an Atlantic oyster drill.
-  This looks like a drill.
(imitates drill noise)
-  It does look kinda like a drill.
- Atlantic oyster drills
like to eat oysters.
- "The blanket was red.
"He pulled the other side, too."
(Janae babbling)
"And they all snuggled
close in the blanket
"that was red."
(Janae babbling)
"And then, at last, Mrs. Bear said,
"Oh no, I know!
"Kiss good night." (kisses)
The end.
Yay!
-  So this is the seashell
that we found on the beach the other day.
Uh-oh.
There came some sand out.
Yes, I found it when we
were doing family pictures.
- It just kinda washed up.
- From the sea?
So it's big enough you can actually hear
the ocean in it.
I don't know how that works, but it works.
Laura, have you heard the ocean?
-  No.
- Come on over here.
-  Can you hear the ocean?
(Jenn shushing)
- I can hear it.
-  You can hear it?
Can you hear the waves?
(Jenn imitating waves)
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
(laughs)
- It's so cool!
-  What does it sound like?
(imitating ocean noise)
Hey, that's really good.
Laura, how does the seashell
let us hear the ocean?
- I don't know.
-  Look inside.
- There's nothing in it.
-  Right, there's nothing in it.
- Is there like a battery?
-  There's no batteries.
- I think I know how.
-  How?
- It might be
shallow or something?
-  Shallow.
-  Shallow?
- That if you put your ear to it,
it makes those sounds.
-  So Laura told me she figured out
how it works.
- Magic.
-  Is there magic in it?
- Yeah.
-  Nice.
- I can hear it!
(upbeat music)
- So I'm at Target by myself because
I'm making some last-minute purchases
to get read for Elisa's birthday.
We have a birthday season in our family,
which just means that a bunch
of the kids' birthdays
are really close together
and Elisa's is the beginning of it.
I can't believe it.
She's gonna be eight years old.
That is just crazy.
(Jeremy and Laura singing)
So Laura is learning the 50 Nifty
United States song
and she's singing it over and over
and over and over again
and it's so cute and I'm losing my mind.
♪ Al-A-Bama, Alaska, Arizona ♪
♪ Arkansas, California, Colorado ♪
♪ Connecticut ♪
♪ Do do do ♪
So I'm going on a walk
and I'm taking a couple
of the kids with me.
We're gonna enjoy the fresh air
and let them sing at home
as much as they want
♪ Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, ♪
♪ Illinois, Indiana ♪
♪ Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maine ♪
♪ Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan ♪
I can hear them as we're walking away.
They're still goin'.
You ready to go on a way?
- Yep.
-  Let's do it.
- But it might still be stuck in my head.
-  I know, that's how songs work,
they get stuck there,
even when you can't hear them.
They're like living inside.
Okay, let's go.
♪ Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, Montana ♪
♪ Nebraska, Nevada ♪
♪ Al-A-Ba -- ♪
- Stop it.
When I touch your nose, stop.
♪ 'Laska, Ari -- ♪
♪ ...Zona, Arkansas ♪
- Since we live on a ginormous hill,
the walks are actually
really good workouts,
so that's a good thing.
(Classical music)
The hill so steep that it's almost harder
to walk downhill than uphill,
have you guys noticed that?
That's always weird to me.
Look how big those leaves are.
- That's even bigger than my face.
-  I know, it's gorgeous, too.
Walking is one of my
favorite ways to exercise,
so I love it when a walk is also a really
good workout.
I've been pushing Janae for a while.
It's nice to have the kids
be able to take a turn.
It just feels good to be outside.
(Classical music)
Keep pushin'.
This is quite the hill.
You guys resting?
They found a way to
work together. (laughs)
Janae's the one with the comfy ride.
Hi, hi.
(Classical music)
Wanna get out and play?
- Chapter book.
-  It is a chapter book.
The Bug House.
Here's Isaac in his natural habitat.
At the library with a sports book.
We found some great books.
Now we're just gonna sit down and read.
(Classical music)
Did you find some books?
- Why are there snowmen?
-  'Cause they're trying to think
about wintertime here too.
But it doesn't really feel
like wintertime, does it?
- I'm wearing summer clothes.
-  You are wearing summer clothes.
She's doing it.
Janae is learning how to do something new
at the library.
She's climbed up on the step two times.
Let's see if she does it again.
Oh my goodness (gasps),
she just did it again!
She climbed up that step right there.
Are you so proud of yourself?
Yeah, let's see it again, Nae.
Laura, that looks pretty comfy.
Can you really read the words?
- No, I'm just looking at 'em.
-  Would you like
me to get you a book
with some pictures?
- A chapter book with pictures?
-  Sure.
How's that one?
- Good, thank you.
The Berenstain Bears.
-  Oh my goodness,
look at her climb.
-  Come to me, Nae-Nae.
-  You did it!
Yay!
(babbles)
Janae could not do this before today.
She's so proud of herself.
- So for the last couple of days
I've been listening to
The Greatest Showman
music a lot.
It's really good.
I went to the movie, and
I didn't enjoy the movie
as much because it went so fast,
and it felt kind of
like there wasn't depth
to a lot of the characters.
It was kind of like a big montage
instead of, like, going as deep,
but now that I'm listening to the music
and I'm more familiar with it,
I think I would like the movie a lot more.
Let us know on the poll,
have you seen the movie
The Greatest Showman,
and what did you think of it?
-  Caleb, what are you doing?
- Making a treehouse.
-  You're making a treehouse?
This is pretty interesting.
So Caleb grabbed the foam pads
that are over there and
is building a treehouse.
So Caleb read a book about Curious George
building a treehouse and
then he was insistent
on building a treehouse right now.
I'm like, "Dude, we're inside.
"You can't build a
treehouse, we're inside"
and lo and behold, he
figured out a way to do it.
He collected these rubber mats
and is assembling his very own treehouse.
- Welcome to my treehouse.
-  How do you get in?
- Crawl under there.
-  Here's how Caleb gets in and out.
The army crawl.
- Here's the front door.
-  That's a nice front door.
Ooh!
There you are.
Do you know what letter that is?
- For Laura.
-  It is, it's
an R, that's in Laura.
Where's the match?
Where's the match?
(gasps) Good job, there it is!
- Thank you.
- Down in the forest,
the bears started to --
-  Thanks for folding, you guys.
- We're gonna play a game of Monopoly,
if we get this done.
(upbeat music)
-  So Jeremy's on a business call.
And playing football.
That made my heart so happy
to see Jeremy playing with the kids
while he's on his business call.
I could never do that.
Like, I can't multitask like that.
When I'm doing something,
it has all my attention
and anything else I
find super distracting.
Jeremy is a multitasking master.
Like, the more things he's doing,
the more focused he gets, somehow.
I don't understand how that works.
-  Well, tonight we finish
our first read-aloud book while we're here
in San Diego, The Great Horn Spoon.
How've you liked it?
- I've liked it.
- Yeah, so, in this book there's like
all these cowboy miners that have their
talk that they used.
- Ruination!
-  Ruination!
- Tarnation!
- They're goin' to the diggin's.
And then there's Praiseworthy,
who's from Boston.
He's very proper.
-  And Jack.
- And Jack.
- I'm almost at 23,000.
-  All right, good, get it done
so we can read our book.
-  He's red in the face.
-  This has
been the last hour here,
him running in circles around the house.
- Same with me.
-  You've been doing that too?
You got it?
23,000.
- Good night, J House out.
- So we're headed out hiking today.
(upbeat music)
- So they found the clues
for the treasure hunt.
Eat a lime?
They're just snugglin' with mom.
