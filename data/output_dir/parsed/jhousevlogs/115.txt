-  Do you remember
when you auditioned?
(bright dance music)
- What?
- Oh look.
- It's pretend flying.
-  It's pretend flying, Caleb.
♫ You are there, you are there
♫ I see where we are
(bluesy rock music)
(soaring classical music)
(funky electronic music)
So about once a year we come
to the Science Museum here in Kansas City.
And they always have new features,
so the kids love it.
(yelling)
There's Isaac.
He's up there.
(singing)
(piano notes)
It's like a crazy illusion, huh?
- How did they do that?
-  It's an illusion.
- What's an illusion?
-  It tricks your brain.
(playful music)
It looks like you're flying.
(laughing)
- Oh look.
(groans)
(laughing)
- Ja!
(laughing)
(funky dance music)
-  Oh.
Whoa.
Whoa!
(squealing)
- Oh yeah, I have to make a circuit first.
-  Gotta make a circuit.
-  Huh.
- I got it.
-  You got it to work?
(circuits turning)
Good job.
- Yay!
-  You made it all the way.
(yelling)
You want to slowly get it going,
get it going faster and faster.
Good job.
I love how fast your feet are going.
(whirring)
- It's not actually flying.
It's pretend flying.
-  It's pretend flying Caleb.
-  Yeah Caleb.
- Let's go.
(singing)
-  So taking Laura to the bathroom
has been super hard,
because she wore her
swimsuit under her clothes,
you little goose.
- I won't need to go soon.
-  I know.
(bluesy rock music)
It changes the light elevation, huh?
- It's disappeared.
- It's gone.
- So the kids think they can beat me
in this tug of war.
It's set up to where their
side is easier than my side.
Go!
No!
(bell dings)
Oh.
(cheering)
Maybe it is, I do have
Laura on my team though.
(yells)
(Jeremy laughs)
(yells)
(funky beat music)
This is cool.
Laura and Lise, good job.
-  Well that's cool.
-  Whoa.
Okay Isaac, go lift 'em up.
On your mark, get set, go.
(funky groove music)
(yells)
How did that go?
- Woo hoo.
Why is this trying to escape me.
-  You won't fall out, it's safe.
It looks like climbing on chips.
He's up at the top.
- Woo, this is fun.
(tropical beat music)
-  That's a skunk, does it stink?
- No.
-  What do you see?
- Dinosaur.
- I'm in the middle.
-  I'm in the middle.
(gentle guitar music)
- Look they're actually working in there.
So this is a cool section.
They actually have meteorologists
working on projects while the kids
are looking at their work.
- That's a real fossil.
It's a brow horn.
-  It's a real fossil.
- Oh it's one of those?
- Yeah.
-  It's a horn?
- Now,
- That's big.
- The unique thing about it,
it's from a baby triceratops.
-  So a baby
triceratops fossil of a horn
is what the kids are holding.
- This is 65 million years.
- Right.
-  What'd you find?
- I don't know, but it has these.
-  Whoa, those look like ribs.
- Yeah.
(bright uptempo music)
-  Close your eyes.
-  Put your hand beside you,
see, look how it stays behind.
- What?
-  Your shadow stays.
Okay, now move away.
- Oh mine's here.
- Whoa.
(whirling ball)
- That was no.
-  Okay, we're trying
to get it in the middle.
- I did it.
-  She has it in the middle.
Oh.
Don't let your little finger
get stuck in here though.
There it is.
- I made a walkie talkie.
-  How cool, does it work?
- Hello, anybody here?
- So these are whisper dishes
where you can hear from all the way
across the room.
- But how can I hear you?
(uptempo lively music)
- This is a good phone!
-  That is cool.
- And then when you're
done, it's like spikey.
(rousing electronic music)
- It's funny how this
place has all these frills
and amazing things to do.
And my favorite thing has been just
building with my kids.
It's super creative.
So what'd you think of building?
- I like building.
(bright music)
-  You skippin'?
- So I just checked my email
and I got an email that
Elise has been waiting for.
What are you waiting to hear about?
Jeremy knows about this.
- No way, this is so exciting.
- Yay Lise.
-  I think she got an email about
the upcoming Christmas songs.
-  The auditions?
-  The audition.
-  Do you remember
when you auditioned?
- I get one?
-  So I got an
email, I have to open it up
to see if you got one or not.
- Let's see.
- Okay.
- Remember, I did like six auditions
before I ever made anything,
so even if you don't get it,
you are a good singer.
-  Lise, do you
want me to open it or wait?
- Open it.
- [Kendra[ Open it.
You are going to be in
the small group medley
for I Adore You.
- Yay, that's the one that I wanted.
- Is that one your favorite?
-  Yeah, that's the song you sing.
- I'm so excited for you.
So lots of kids in the school audition
and they chose about
three kids for each song.
And so Elise is gonna be in a small group
singing I Adore you.
- Boom.
- I'm so proud of you.
- That's the one I wanted.
-  Honestly, I
would've been proud of you
if you didn't get it too.
- Yeah.
-  I'm just
proud of you for trying.
- J House out.
(yelling)
(Jeremy laughing)
-  Get him.
- It's snowing.
- Trick or treat.
- Daddy, it's too heavy.
(playful spooky music)
