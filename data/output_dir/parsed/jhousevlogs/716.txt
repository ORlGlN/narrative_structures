- Hey guys, we are watching
the lunar eclipse right now.
We're all snuggled out here.
And we've been having a really good time.
- Pee pee.
Pee pees.
-  Pee pees?
- Di pee pee.
-  Let's change the diaper.
- Diaper.
- Diaper.
(delicate music)
You're so gentle and soft with that baby.
- I help.
-  Do you need some help?
All right.
- Thank you.
- Good morning and happy Monday.
We are out at the garden
class this morning,
and it just feels good.
The weather's nice. The sun is shining.
We're out in the garden. It's
a good way to start a week.
- Look!
-  Did you get it?
Way to go. What is that, dude?
- A beet.
- A beet?
- Cool.
-  Poke him out of the ground.
You got it, good job.
A pepper!
Hunting for strawberries.
-  There's only baby ones.
-  There's only baby
ones? Are they not ripe yet?
Nope, not yet.
- You can draw a picture.
-  All right, Caleb,
what do you think of beet pancakes?
- Good.
-  They're good? You like 'em?
- Yeah.
- Now we are having lunch.
- Cheese great.
-  And we're having
a new kind of a lunch.
So I just took these fun plates
and I cut up some cheese.
And this is cheese tortellini.
It's actually cold.
It's from last night, but
I think it works well.
It's like a cold pasta salad.
And here's some ham.
And then we've got green peppers
from garden class this morning, cucumbers,
a grape tomato and some
olives, some apple.
But I'm just loving
watching Caleb at work.
(Laura yells)
What?
So she looks like I just haven't fed her.
Where's your food, Laura?
Yeah, down there.
Say, I got fed, I just
threw it all on the ground.
Like a crazy person.
- Crazy person.
-  Did you just say crazy person?
Can you say crazy person?
Oh, is she tired?
♫ Daddy daddy da
- How can you not be excited to come home
to that little song?
♫ Daddy daddy da
- She was just screaming
when I walked up the stairs,
daddy, daddy!
-  Daddy, daddy.
- When we were in the park--
Daddy, daddy?
When we were at the park, a
white car drove by the park
and she was swinging and she looked over
and she squealed, daddy, daddy, daddy!
You thought it was daddy, huh?
(speaks indistinctly)
- Yeah, that happens sometimes.
We're finishing off
lunch with some popcorn,
which the kids have discovered
they can blow around.
- What? Elise has a secret weapon, eating.
-  Elise has a
secret weapon, eating.
-  Mm!
- Can you blow it?
There we go.
At first I was like, you
guys, don't blow your food.
And then Kendra was like,
well doesn't that look fun?
And I was like, yeah.
So, Kendra's got in blowing with the kids.
- Try to only parent when
absolutely necessary.
Hey, oh, no popcorn fight.
-  But doesn't that look fun?
- We have to go, in like five minutes.
He got you guys.
Now there's a little
smudge on your screen.
- Sorry. We gotta clean you off.
(blows raspberry)
- All right, well Jeremy,
I don't know if I mentioned it before,
but he has a super flexible work schedule,
so he works a ton of hours each week,
but he can move those
hours around as needed,
and so what was really nice is,
Laura and Caleb were both exhausted,
and so he came and worked
from home this afternoon,
so that I could run Elise to
ballet and Isaac to piano.
-  So the kids are having
a hard time waking up, right?
- Yeah. They're both
needing lots of cuddles.
I think maybe their naps
weren't quite long enough.
-  Yeah, they look tired.
- They still do look tired, huh?
-  Tired little
girl. Tired little girl.
- Are you tired?
No?
-  Are you tired?
- He says, no.
All right. Woah, that
looks kinda close to me.
- Can I do it?
- You can say hi.
- Hi. I'm vlogging.
-  You are vlogging.
What else are you doing right now?
- Um, I'm cooking dinner all by myself.
-  Woo, what are we
having for dinner tonight?
- Um,
rice and red chicken and--
-  Red chicken?
- No, orange chicken.
- Mm-hm.
- It's one of a Chinese
food, and, um, veggies.
-  And veggies?
(upbeat music)
-  Blow it if it's hot.
We weren't fast enough.
You win. We lose.
- I was reaching. I was like, ooh!
And it went over.
-  I was distracted
by something over here.
Can't take my eye off you.
- Oops.
- Oops.
- The kids beat the parents. Yay!
Go Laura. Go Laura.
- If we're keeping track,
if we're keeping track of whether or not
the kids are winning or us,
we're down, like, 3,000 points?
Like, you guys are destroying us.
- We're down, like, seven years.
-  Okay, there we go.
(baby talk)
- Jeremy's spoiling me again today,
and I got to come alone to
Isaac's football practice.
At least, at the moment.
He might pack up the kids and join me,
but they weren't done
eating dinner yet, so.
Now I'm just watching my boy play.
I love how much Isaac loves
coming out to football.
He just, he thrives. He just adores it.
-  These two.
Laura keeps running up to
Caleb and giving him a big hug.
You guys hugging?
- Yes.
-  Okay, Cub, oh! Oh.
She is a tough cookie,
being buds with this guy.
Okay, you guys come on.
Let's read scriptures.
-  J House out.
- Good night.
Caleb just wished on a shooting star.
What'd you wish for, buddy?
-  I wish I was a real dog.
-  That's just like weird.
-  I wish I was a butt.
-  Hey, that's
rude. Come here, you.
Cubbie, come here.
- Hey dad?
- Yeah.
-  Is that the Big Dipper?
-  Yeah, it's just
above that house over there.
-  What? Where's house?
-  Yup. And then it
points to the North Star.
(kids talk indistinctly)
-  There's a Big Dipper,
there's a Little Dipper.
-  Jeremy, I think
you got plenty of footage
for a 15-second intro.
-  Oh, I know. I'm
capturing this for my own joy.
