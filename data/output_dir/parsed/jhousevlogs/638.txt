my goodness there's something going on
up ahead slow down babe emergency
vehicle
all right well we are headed down to the
continental breakfast this morning and
hoping to find good news and that we'll
be able to leave today this is like day
three of being stranded on the alien
planet alright well we just got news our
neighbor knocked on the door and they
said the roads are open so I 40 is
officially open we don't know what the
conditions of the road are going to be
like we're assuming it's going to be you
know not ideal but we are excited we're
leaving Tucumcari New Mexico what
happens in Tucumcari stays in Sur good
he wants to go alright we are getting on
the i-40 it has been closed for 36 hours
the right way yep you are let's do this
thing
alright at this moment I'm feeling
really grateful for Jeremy's years of
snow driving experience
oh yeah this is a drivable road
all right here we are i-40 so I just saw
what looked like about ten bears
together like Jeremy's totally doubting
me but they didn't look like cattle they
just the roaming bears don't bears
hibernate I just don't think it was a
bunch of bears
well it didn't look like cattle our
cattle Orange maybe it was bison me it
was bison we don't know we saw maybe it
was giraffes anyway that's the latest
update here we are
semis when it's wet
it's just the worst it is passing semis
in general if it's really windy if it's
really rainy if you're feeling really
constipated I mean those are all touchy
it's really hard to pass assembly
I better put this kid away
alright guys we only have about 50 more
miles of this and then it's supposed to
clear up we're counting down
it's kind of nerve-racking the drive in
this Venice stuff
especially when you have precious cargo
ha precious cargo
Alaska Arizona Arkansas California
Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida
Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana
all right well jeremy has declared that
we are on a mission and that mission is
to make it to our families for
dinnertime tonight so to do that we
calculated like the exact middle point
of our trip so that we could gas up once
and we're just like snacking in the car
and so we're just going to stop there
and eat lunch and so we're attempting
with four kids and a nine hour drive
we just want to get there we feel like
we've been stuck in one of those holiday
movies where you can't get home for
Christmas we just might get there so
we're playing a game where we're picking
a memory during our last 11 years of
marriage and then we have to try to
guess we're going back and forth it's
like 20 questions it's been really fun
and by the way today's our anniversary
we decided it would be super romantic
and celebrated by driving across the
i-40 with our kids it's working it's
very romantic
and turn it all around
with the new attitude everything can
change make it all you wanted to be all
right we are attempting the world's
quickest traffic stop
hey is it nice to be out of the car dude
yeah your hair goes crazy
we're running people through the
bathroom while we wait for our food and
hopefully we can just get there you just
want to get there okay so apparently
laura is stuck up in the play place so
it's my job to go and rescue her the
girl you stuck because we're coming down
let's do oh you all right big girl

filthy from traveling and all the snow

Jeremy was really excited to get to a
place where we could clean off the
windshield then he could see better

we're it wait all right Jeremy and I are
having a sing-off guys ready the kids

me Lauren my goodness there's something
going on up ahead
for emergency vehicles
oh my goodness
is it a fire
but what's on fire
oh I hope everybody's safe it's like
people were
right so we just passed by a car fire
and it looks like everybody was saved
like it looks like an empty car
how does a car like that just catch on
fire
I have a story about a man catching fire
on the side of the road that was our van
it's happened it's crazy so we were just
driving ahead and somebody flashed their
headlights at us and so they were
warning us to slow down and up at the
top of the hill there was the fire in
the accident and so we continued on and
Jeremy is now trying to warn the people
up ahead but he couldn't find our what
our they couldn't find our headlights
he drove a different vehicle I was like
turning on the windshield
he's like warning them with our
windshield wipers but yeah watch out
something up ahead so I'm just sitting
here realizing how scary a car fire
would be like I looked in the backseat
and I'm like man just Jeremy not getting
out and unbuckling the kids from the car
seats and getting us all out of the car
oh my goodness that's perfect so when I
was about 15 years old we were driving
down the exact place we're going right
now
on this same road and our van began to
smoke and we pulled over and it was
smoking and my stepdad went out front
there was actually flames in the engine
of the car and I remember the real fear
was that there was going to be an
explosion you know just that fear that
you know we were going to die in a fire
and so we ran out I remember them taking
sand and dirt to try to put out the fire
in the flames
anyway we were all okay but it was a
really scary experience we had to wait
for someone to come and pick us up
did you like jump out of a car and run
away from me I ran at least a half a
mile with my younger brothers and we
knelt down and we prayed and it was
actually really miraculous someone
pulled over who had a cell phone which
was like a newfangled device that could
call someone at that time not a lot of
people in cell phones and it was and
they had a fire extinguisher as well
well
it was crazy and so it was a good
experience let's hope that doesn't
happen eyes knocked on some wood
we have put in here Caleb's asleep
I have to tell you guys our kids are
rock star travelers they are doing a
great job
like
but I think we've only watched like one
and they're just chocolate like they're
just so great
I mean there's still the meltdowns in
difficult times
I'm loving this drive for me when my
parents got divorced you know a couple
times each month we would
this trick when it's really nice
you guys were here for about ten minutes
out guys
we are always done why are we there I
don't you excited do yourself
you
