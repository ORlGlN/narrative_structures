- And the house looked
like it had blown up.
-  Say goodbye to Granny Jo.
- Move your body!
- I'm going to show you something.
-  She's dancing.
She's dancing.
(Jeremy laughs)
- Can we tell them where we're going?
We're going to...
(upbeat piano music)
- Good morning.
Today is a big day around here
because we are packing for our trip.
And we're starting off the day
with a really yummy breakfast.
At least I think it's yummy.
Some of my kids aren't so sure about it,
but we are having quiche and smoothies.
(relaxed music)
-  How do you
like the quiche, Elise?
- Good.
-  Laura, what do
you think of the quiche?
- I like it.
I'm cutting it into pieces.
-  Say goodbye to Granny Jo.
- I will see you in a couple
of weeks, which is so fun.
I look forward to it.
We'll come and play
with you in a few days.
(record scratches)
- Sometimes as a mom, I feel
like I am trying to move
an army of concrete ants
up a waterfall in the desert.
That didn't really make any sense,
but sometimes as a mom, I
feel like I'm like, "Come on!
"Let's do it!
"Move your body!
"Do your chores!"
- Do it.
Do your chores.
(Kendra chuckles)
Can we tell them where we're going?
- Do you want to?
- Yeah.
- Or do you think they're ready for that?
- We are going to San Diego for a month.
- I'm so excited.
I keep texting Jeremy pictures
of the weather forecast in San Diego.
- It's true, she does.
- Because it's like gorgeous.
It's like there's sun.
- But the list of people
we're gonna see, the
things we're gonna do,
we're all really excited.
- I am too because it's a lot warmer.
-  It is.
-  Ooh, what are
we gonna do in San Diego?
- Go to the beach.
-  The beach is gonna be cold.
Like the water's cold.
- But it will be nice.
-  The sand and
playing outside the park
is gonna be nice, but the actual water
is gonna still be cold.
It's still winter in San Diego.
- I'm gonna swim in San Diego.
- I say we let him have at it.
That will be fun to see.
-  We might let
you swim in a heated pool.
(Caleb gasps)
- I got real makeup for Christmas.
-  You got real
makeup for Christmas?
- Yeah.
-  We've seen you
use it a couple of times.
- I know.
-  Are you liking it?
- Yeah.
-  How do you
feel about San Diego?
- Good.
-  What are we
gonna do in San Diego?
- Ice cream.
-  We're gonna eat
ice cream in San Diego?
- Yeah.
-  Whose birthday is it gonna be
when we're in San Diego?
- Me and Lisey's.
-  (gasps) How
old are you gonna turn?
Four!
So what are you most
excited to do in San Diego?
- Go to LegoLand and go to the beach.
- Well, we actually just had
a really successful family meeting.
I gave the kids all lists of specifically
what they need to be getting done.
And now, it's working.
Like we talked about
how we need to be a team
and be working together
and how it's a lot of work
to get ready for a trip.
And anyway, we even did like
a family cheer at the end,
like, "One, two, three, go, San Diego!"
So I'm feeling a little
bit of a weight lifted,
and I am going to help the girls.
We're gonna try to get them packed.
Is this something you're gonna pack?
- Yup.
-  Show us what you're packing.
All of that.
Okay, we have underwear, pajamas, clothes,
shorts, dresses to wear to church.
-  Wow, she's way fast at packing.
-  I might have been
helping her a little bit.
(Elise chuckles)
We're bringing the jelly shoes.
Laura, go find your jellies.
That's why we need to look for them.
- No.
- So I had Laura try on this dress
and see if it fit before we take it.
And now she doesn't wanna take it off.
She just keeps dancing in it.
I think she feels like a pretty cool cat.
You're not gonna wear that
shirt when you travel?
- I wore it today just to
not wear it at the airport.
It's an ongoing tradition
that people have
mentioned in the comments.
So I'm gonna end it off.
-  Breaking tradition?
- Yup.
-  So what did you just find out?
- We can do laundry.
-  Yeah.
- So if we ran out of clothes,
we can just do laundry.
-  That's exactly right.
- That's my whole packing problem.
- So Elise and I were struggling.
I'm like, "You do not
need this many shirts."
And she's like, "I do!"
And anyway, finally, we
realized she didn't know
that we could do laundry
when we were there.
So that should help with packing.
- So today,
I'm going to show you something.
So today, I love my mom.
(Kendra chuckles)
Here's Nae-nae and mom.
- She just woke up.
Say hi.
-  Are you playing Osmo?
- Mm-hmm.
-  So you're
piecing together a coding.
Let's see how it goes.
-  It goes like this.
-  Laura is in her fourth
or fifth outfit of the day, of course.
And what did we make?
- A doggie (mumbles).
-  A doggie.
What should we call our doggie?
- Fridge donkey.
-  The fridge donkey?
-  Yeah.
-  Interesting name.
You ride it?
Go ahead.
She rides the fridge donkey.
Oh, no! (laughs)
You crushed him.
- Now we have to make it again.
It's all tangled.
-  Okay, here.
I'll make it again.
Hold on.
(whimsical music)
- J House, out.
I'm vlogging you.
- You're vlogging me?
-  Yeah.
- All right, I think the dog is done.
- I guess we'll have to
make it again, right?
I can turn it off.
-  Okay, you turn it off.
What are you making?
- We are making corn muffins.
-  For dinner?
Just for fun?
- Snack.
-  Yummy.
-  And let's see.
-  Teaspoons, please.
(blows a raspberry.
- And then we'll need one egg.
Thank you.
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Great singing, Laura.
Elise's muffins are done.
How did they turn out?
- Good.
-  Thanks so much, Elise.
- I tried to make them not overdone
or less overdone.
- Well, the kids are getting restless.
I'm getting overwhelmed.
And the house looked like it has blown up.
The mess that comes from
eating corn muffins.
(whimsical piano music)
Everything is out.
There's messes everywhere.
And it's time to take a deep
breath and go eat dinner.
(upbeat music)
So we came to McAlister's Deli.
They have kid's meals that are
99 cents, which is awesome.
Lisey, what did you order?
- I ordered a salad.
-  What did you order?
- Turkey sandwich.
-  With what?
- Cheese.
-  And chips.
-  And chips.
What did you order?
- Mac and cheese with a fruit cup.
-  Nice.
She was really excited about the water.
-  She can't
totally control her face.
Pretty good.
-  She's dancing.
-  What's that?
What's that move?
- It's a hootie move.
-  A hootie move?
-  Oh, look, she's dancing.
She's dancing.
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Macaroni and cheese.
(Jeremy laughs)
- Thank you.
You know our family too well.
(waitress chuckles)
-  We need extra napkins.
- Mom, I got a snack!
- You got a snack?
So Jeremy's sandwich is
called the Big Nasty.
but this is a Parmesan kale soup.
This is our first time
trying to kid's meals here,
and I am really happy with them.
They're good portions, a
good selection, and 99 cents.
This is not sponsored.
I'm just thrilled.
(upbeat music)
-  Good night.
J House, out.
- Some of our pipes are frozen.
-  Get him! (laughs)
-  Laura is
getting ready for the day.
(upbeat rock music)
