♪ Annie ♪
- So I got a text I'm
really excited about.
Here it is.
Do you know who that is?
(bright music)
(cracking egg)
(sizzling)
Jeremy is the egg master at our house.
And while Jeremy is making eggs,
I'm doing the complicated process
of toasting frozen waffles.
So we're gonna have waffles
and eggs for breakfast
and I am so excited.
Every day since we've
been home from our trip
has been so busy, a birthday, a baptism,
Valentine's Day or just
lots of stuff going on
and today, there is
nothing on the schedule.
I am so excited.
- Hi.
-  You're looking all dressed up.
- We are playing pretend
and I'm gonna soon go outside
and drill holes with my drill.
(drill buzzing)
(playful music)
-  And what are you doing?
- We're pretending that my house broke.
I got kids.
-  How many kids do you have?
- 16.
-  So you have 16 kids.
- Yep.
- How did you house breakdown?
- From a really bad storm.
- So where's your house?
- Out here, but it's under water though.
- Can we get out there and fix it?
- Sure.
-  Let's go.
(drilling)
- Thanks for fixing my house.
-  You're welcome.
- Bye.
-  Jeremy's
headed up to the office.
Janae is just waving.
- Bye.
-  Bye, there it is the wave.
- I have a meeting with Brent.
We're talking strategy and
growth and business stuff
with the law firm.
-  Sounds fun.
- See ya.
-  You are such a big girl.
- So Caleb has been making this
and I think I'll make it.
(playful music)
It's a flower code.
My sandwich.
- I busted out our math scale
and Laura is playing with it this morning.
Alright Laura, can you
show us how it works?
(pieces clinking)
Uh-oh, which side is heavier?
That side?
Can you make it equal somehow?
(pieces clinking)
So when the arrows line up,
that means it's equal?
- Yeah.
-  Alright.
Uh-oh, which one's heavier now?
Can you make it even?
- What does even mean?
-  Even means the same.
Which side's heavier?
Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- So it's a lot colder today.
I got earmuffs and gloves.
But Caleb has been super focused.
He is committed to
drilling holes right now.
So we're going out to do it.
(drilling)
There we go.
Uh-oh.
- It's okay.
- So Janae is finally
down for a nap and so,
Laura, what are we doing?
- Cards, we have to match 'em.
-  We have to find a match?
Did you find a match on your turn?
- No.
- {Kendra] Okay look at
this card and this card,
there's gotta be some match.
(gasps)
You're right, it matches.
It's a yellow nine.
- Yep.
-  Let's see, now it's my turn.
Oh I found it, look Laura.
What's that?
- One!
-  That's the number one.
- Nae Nae's soon gonna be one.
-  That's so true,
it's gonna happen so soon.
(drilling)
-  Are you gonna drill it out?
Pull it up.
(blowing)
- I got the drill out,
but not the drill bit.
- Yep, we're gonna have to fix that.
(bright music)
(drilling)
I think Caleb can do
this for a couple hours.
Someone woke up from her nap.
- Hi.
- A little too early.
- Thanks for getting her Isaac.
Good job, birds are an example of that.
Hi baby, hi.
- We are learning about mammals
and marsupials.
-  Cool, different
categories of animals?
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.
- We started a new science
book and we're liking it.
It's the middle of the day
and I am in a quiet car all by myself.
My hair's done, my make-up's done,
I'm dressed, this is quite a moment for me
and I'm actually really excited about it.
I'm headed out to pick up a fun lunch
just for Jeremy and I.
I'm getting it to go
and then we're gonna home
and have a little lunch date.
Jeremy meantime is dealing with lunch
with all the kids
and so, this is like
a mini vacation for me
in the middle of the day.
And we're doing this for two reasons,
one is we haven't had as much time
to spend together as we
would like to recently.
We feel just with
everything that's going on
and so many extra people visiting
that haven't had as much time to connect
as we would like
and we're starting to feel that strain.
So, time to invest some
time into our marriage.
And bonus, we get to eat yummy food,
because I need to go
grocery shopping again,
so the fridge is almost empty.
Luckily there's stuff for the kids though
and I think they'll be pretty happy.
(bright music)
So this First Watch place
is my new favorite spot.
- We have a play.
You'll have to sit down.
-  Okay, I'll sit down.
♪ This is the happiest builder ♪
♪ Builder builder spin spin spin spin ♪
♪ Make us fast as you ca-a-can ♪
(sped up singing)
-  I got a sweet honey pecan salad
and I already ate the
breadstick that comes with it,
because I'm so hungry.
And Jeremy got a Southern
California burrito
to make us homesick for San Diego.
Do you want some?
(Janae babbling)
-  I do.
- Of course you do.
The big kids all got all bundled up
and went outside to play in the cold.
They were wanting to,
so we were like go for it.
So the little kids are just in with us
on our date.
-  Yummy.
I want some.
-  So Janae's been
our little date buddy.
- She's so adorable.
(Kendra laughs)
Is it a phone?
Hi, can I talk with Janae Nae?
She's right here.
She's starting to feel
a little bit better.
She's been sick and
more cranky than normal.
We're not used to her being as fussy,
but it's nice to see her
starting to get better.
-  Uh-oh.
-  Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
-  Did she just
make that funny face?
Do you notice what she
does with her tongue?
Yeah.
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.
- So I got a text that
I'm really excited about
and I haven't told the kids yet,
so I'm gonna show it to them.
Here it is.
(sweet music)
Do you know who that is?
- Melanie's baby.
- Yes, it's Michael and
Melanie's new baby boy.
That's your new cousin.
What's his name?
- We don't know his name yet,
but isn't he cute?
(Janae babbling)
Oh she's reaching for him.
- That's your cousin.
- Yeah, you're gonna play with him.
Do you want to see the baby?
- He's your baby.
- So this is my brother Michael's new baby
and they're the family
that we went to go see
in Seattle for Thanksgiving.
I'm excited for them.
(laughing)
They have two kids.
- Who wants pizza?
-  Me!
-  So we went with
pineapple and pepperoni.
-  And?
-  This one's my favorite.
It's Philly cheese steak.
(enchanting music)
They have breadstick, garlic knot thingies
that are so good.
(dramatic orchestral music)
♪ No need to pick up any toys ♪
- Turned down like five in a row.
- So after listening to the music,
our kids are finally watching Annie
for the first time.
What did you guys think of the movie?
- I liked it.
- It was awesome.
- I know who I'm gonna
want to be in the movie,
I mean the play.
-  Yeah, who are
you gonna want to be?
- Daddy Warbucks.
- I want to be Punjab.
(laughing)
- I want to be Annie
when I grow up.
- So we were watching it tonight,
because the kids are signed up
to do a play this summer of Annie.
- Goodnight J House out.
(kiss)
- We don't know if that
means we're moving soon.
If we found the right place, we could.
(bright music)
What do you think is inside the box?
- Whoa whoa.
What did you find?
I forgot the Jello salad.
