So Janae just said her very first word.
That one looks pretty cute.
Thank you.
So I have my hair down today.
My whole family's a little confused.
(jangly upbeat music)
(uptempo music)
-  It's like dance cleaning.
("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy ")
Oh very nice.
(bright music)
She's asleep now, shhh.
So with the weather getting colder,
it is time to go through
the growin' bin, right?
What size clothes are we gonna look for?
Four year old ones.
Four year old ones?
'Cause how old are you gonna be soon?
Four.
And then five.
And then what?
I don't know.
(laughs)
-  So pretty
much all of Laura's pants
look like this right now.
Yeah.
-  You've gotten taller.
Show me how tall you are.
Whoa, whoa that is very tall.
So we gotta get the clothes
out of your drawers that
don't fit you any more
and save them for who?
Nae Nae.
And then we're gonna go through this bin
and see which clothes fit you.
So step one is to go through
Laura's very messy drawers.
What happened in this drawer?
(playful music)
I messed up it.
-  That one is too little for you,
I think we need to save it for Janae.
I wanted to keep it.
-  Let's see how short it is.
You got that when you were two.
I think it's too little now.
But you can find some new stuff
in the growing box, okay?
So these look really short.
Wait a minute, these are size nine months.
These are Janae's.
Oh.
-  Down at the bottom,
we found Laura's missing necklace.
Well we're surrounded by piles of clothes.
Ooh, you're getting kinda
almost too big for these ones.
(bright music)
C-c-c-cutie.
-  I think you put
the shirt on backwards.
I did.
(bright music)
Church shoes.
-  You want to try 'em on?
Ooh they are still a little bit big.
And then what happens when you're four?
Pre-school with the big kids.
(bright music)
-  I remember
that was Elise's favorite
pair of pajamas when she was four.
That one looks pretty cute.
Thank you.
(laughing)
That one is adorable.
Put your arms up in
the air, and let's see.
Thank you Mom for buying these.
-  They're hand
me downs from Lise.
Are you excited to wear your
new four year old clothes?
Yeah.
-  It's fun to get new clothes.
You love four year old stuff.
Yeah.
(beeping)
-  What are you doing in here?
Just weighing.
-  You built a scale?
Alright Caleb, how do you weigh something?
So if I want to do this,
I could do these two.
See this one weighs more.
-  I see.
And then maybe we could add a few
of these little stuff
to this and see what it might do.
-  Whoa, you figured
out how to equalize it.
Wait, you took 'em off
and it still stayed.
How did it do that?
Ah-ha, so where you
put it affects it, huh.
Caleb thanks for showing us that,
that was really cool.
Good luck weighing stuff.
(upbeat music)
-  So Elise said that
a friend of hers at school
put bananas in her sandwich,
so we thought we would try it.
Alright, let me know what you guys think.
It's good.
-  It's kinda different, huh?
The flavor of the banana
really took out the flavor
of the peanut butter
and I love peanut butter.
So I have my hair down today
and I very very rarely do that.
So much so that my whole
family's a little confused.
-  You look so different today.
Well thank you.
-  With your hair, you have hair.
I do.
The kids are like, you have hair.
It's down and Janae
keeps like touching it.
It's just funny, because
I always wear it up.
So question for you,
do you usually wear your hair down or up?
I have my hair down some days
and I have my hair up sometimes.
I usually wear my hair up.
-  Yeah?
I let mine hang down.
So Janae just said her very first word.
I was laying here on the ground
and she was crawling around me
and she crawled right up to me
and patted me and said Mama.
Didn't you, didn't you say Mama?
-  Mama.
-  Mama!
I saw her say Mama.
It was like Mama.
It was not just random babbling,
like she knew what she was saying.
Mama.
Okay now let's let her talk.
Nothing, nothing at all.
I swear she said it guys.
(laughing)
(Janae babbling)
Oh she's talking.
-  Dada Mama.
Well I still have a lot of work to do,
but we've made a lot of progress.
I've got a pile of stuff to donate,
that Laura grew out of,
and then some of the stuff
that she grew out of,
we're gonna save for Janae,
and so I've got a pile of that
that I'm gonna put in these bins.
And I went through her drawers.
It's amazing what you can find
in a three year old's drawers.
But look how much more
organized they look now.
It's just interesting.
I grew up with hand me down clothes,
Jeremy grew up with a lot
of hand me down clothes
and I like that.
I like that it teaches our kids
that you don't have to
have things brand new
to have them work and be functional.
The kids are really happy
with hand me down clothes,
so I think we're gonna enjoy
it for as long as it lasts.
That might not work when they get older.
We're going to do that for now.
This is my favorite vegetable,
my favorite fruit, my favorite bread
and my favorite kind of noodles.
Same with me.
And they're mine.
-  Well good.
We should make this for dinner more often.
(lively music)
Isaac and I are working on
his Pinewood Derby tonight.
If you remember last year,
we had a scare with the saw.
(saw buzzing)
(yelling)
Get back.
The blade actually broke and snapped
and kind of scared everybody.
-  Do you remember that Isaac?
Yeah.
Yeah, that was scary.
So hopefully tonight
goes a little bit better.
So since we don't have the equipment,
Mike, he goes to church with us,
he's helping us, he has the saws
and a cool little workshop down here,
of a bunch of equipment,
and he's gonna help us
cut the Pinewood Derby
right to design.
(jangly string music)
Right there.
-  That's not really
the right drum for that,
but we'll put this one on.
(machinery grinding)
(lively rock music)
(machinery buzzing)
-  Well we can just
take sand paper to it at home.
(drill buzzing)
You made a hole, make it deeper.
Watch that,
good thing you got your goggles on.
-  Is it hot?
Yeah.
-  It's hot isn't it.
-  The friction.
-  The friction.
The smell of the wood is so good.
(dramatic guitar flourish)
Nae Nae's dancing.
-  She's into it.
-  Woo!
-  Woo!
(Janae laughing)
-  There it is.
Woo!
Get that knee into it.
She's excited.
(laughing)
(Janae squealing)
Woo!
We did a 10 minute family clean up
which ends with a dance party
and a clean living room.
♪ We don't even have to try ♪
♪ It's always a good time ♪
(laughing)
♪ It's always a good time ♪
(clapping)
♪ I can't stop this dance dance dance ♪
♪ Just dance dance dancin' ♪
I'm doing it with my knees.
-  There's the Nae Nae.
Everybody do the Nae Nae.
-  Do the Nae Nae.
Yeah.
-  She's got it.
-  It's the Nae Nae.
Look Mama.
(laughing)
-  Goodnight, J House out.
-  Super Laura.
(tropical beat music)
Not a poop your pants face.
You can get me man, and
then I'll show you, my man.
-  Oh (laughs).
And there's not just one of them.
There's more than one,
is this a thing and I had no idea?
