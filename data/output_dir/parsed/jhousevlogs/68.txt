-  That was quite the face.
- (giggles) Let's take down the tree.
-  What are you making?
- Ice.
-  You guys playing laser tag?
- Yes.
(upbeat drum music)
-  Will it stay on
there if I just keep going?
(Kendra gasps)
-  Oh!
(children shouting)
- I can see.
-  Look what came in the mail.
(peppy instrumental music)
(baby coos)
-  You just walking around?
These are the Christmas bins.
They're all full.
(baby squealing)
-  Janae found
the Tupperware shelves.
(giggling) I see you.
(baby babbling)
-  Hi, are you saying hi?
(baby squealing)
(thudding)
(whooshing)
- Well, so far our day has
been a little bit of a bummer.
We had some fun plans,
but we've had to cancel
because Jeremy has run
into a bunch of problems
with work this morning.
It's just been lots of
technical difficulties
and issues coming up, and
our plans were to go out
and do something fun with him today.
So, we're going to save
that for another day
and instead I called some
friends and they're coming over
to play with our kids, and
I'm cleaning up Christmas.
I think by the end of today,
Christmas is gonna be all boxed up
and we're going to try to take
the tree down, which is sad.
And also exciting to get
the house cleaned and ready
for the new year.
Who's coming over to play?
- (whispering) Brittany.
-  Your friend
Brittany's coming over to play?
Well, that's going to be fun.
You better go watch the
door, see if she's coming.
(upbeat guitar music)
- So, the kids have some friends over
and they're having so
much fun playing together.
(upbeat instrumental music)
-  What are you guys doing?
- We are eating.
-  Is this your baby?
-  Yes,
do you got the new baby now?
-  So, are you guys
gonna have some birthday cake?
- Yeah, yes it's my birthday.
-  Ooh, very fun.
- Mom, where's my food?
-  What are you making?
- Ice.
-  Where does it go?
- In here.
I want to bake you something.
I want to have breakfast.
(knobs clicking)
(slurping)
-  Hey Nae Nae.
(baby squealing)
(synthesizer music)
-  You guys playing laser tag?
- Yes.
(synthesizer music)
(guns clicking)
-  Lunch today
is a ginormous salad,
gettin' ready for the new
year and eating healthy.
(clicking)
(boys laughing)
-  This game is super fun.
(clicking)
- Hi.
(girls laughing)
-  What are you guys playing?
- Exploding kittens.
-  Awesome.
Everybody look.
(children laughing)
- All of these are so funny.
- I don't--
(Kendra gasping)
(children chattering)
-  Aubrey put down a
note, you gotta put it back.
They're teaming up now.
It's gettin' real.
Uh oh, Elise is attacking Caleb!
 Caleb,
you have to draw some cards.
(boy yells)
 You have two notes.
♪ I cry the day that
I take the tree down ♪
♪ I want the season to
last all year round ♪
Do you guys know that song?
I think of that song every year
when we take down the Christmas tree.
Sorry, I'm definitely not a singer,
but it's in my head,
so it had to come out.
Jeremy has a minute to step away from work
and so he's going to
help me get this beast
out of our house, and then
I'm going to vacuum for days.
Do you guys see all
those things everywhere?
This is the one moment when I usually wish
that we had an artificial tree.
Like, it would be a lot easier
to take down and put away,
but I do still love having a real tree.
Jeremy and I were chatting
and I think next year
we'd actually love to get a real tree
that actually is like in root,
so it's an alive real tree.
And then we could just
plant it in our backyard,
which would be awesome.
That was quite the face.
- (giggles) Let's take down the tree.
So, I will be doing this in my pajamas
even though it's three
o'clock in the afternoon.
(Kendra laughing)
I had some like work problems,
technical problems with my computer.
-  You guys stabilizing the tree?
I've gotta unscrew it down here.
(happy guitar music)
(upbeat drumming)
- So, there's a park nearby
that recycles the trees
and so we're going to take
it there to drop it off.
-  There he goes.
The man and the tree.
Bye.
- I'm on it.
-  Are you gonna tie
it to the top of the roof?
- Yeah.
- That is a really big tree.
(upbeat instrumental music)
(vacuum whirring)
- The Christmas tree!
-  It started falling off.
Okay, I better try to fix it.
(Jeremy laughing)
Oh, will it stay on there
if I just keep going.
(jaunty guitar music)
- So, Jeremy and I finally
just put on clothes.
- 'Cause I'm about to go to the store.
- We're matching.
We didn't know that, we didn't mean to,
but we're both wearing
our Studio C attire.
- Which as a side note, Kendra has become
a little bit of a Studio
C binge-watcher lately.
It's her current--
- I have it too!
- That's hilarious.
Are you wearing a Studio C shirt too?
- Yeah!
(Jeremy laughing)
-  Our cousins are here.
Luke and Allie.
(children talking)
- Well, Jeremy is heading
out to get some dinner for us
and I'm going to stay
here with this crazy crew.
(upbeat guitar music)
- We're going shopping.
-  We're going shopping.
(singing)
- Yes!
-  You've been singing so much.
Do you want to help me
get some flowers for mom?
- Yeah, yeah.
-  Okay, put 'em in the cart.
(jaunty organ music)
How did you enjoy being my little helper?
- Great.
-  I just love
being with you, big girl.
Look what came in the mail.
- I'm guessing my new glasses.
-  Well, put them on, let's see.
I'm so glad that you don't
have broken glasses anymore.
- Just for safety.
-  Alright.
-  Does it look normal?
-  I like 'em!
- It fits perfectly.
-  Well, now we're
gonna have to get used to it.
-  Yeah, I like the new ones.
- Feels loose.
-  Do those feel nice and tight?
- It feels like--
- They stick on?
- Yeah.
- I wanna try these on.
-  You just want
to see what it's like?
-  You can keep them.
- (laughing) What'd I--
(Jeremy laughing)
- (giggling) I can see.
- Looks perfect with your blue eyes.
Goodnight J House out.
- So, today is Jeremy and I's anniversary
and we are out together celebrating.
I am going to go have an
eye doctor appointment.
The kids are helping.
See what kinds I'm gonna be looking at.
- So, we know how to live
it up anniversary style.
- Oh yeah, eye doctor, board game.
-  Kendra's trying contacts.
-  And then you grab it.
(upbeat instrumental music)
