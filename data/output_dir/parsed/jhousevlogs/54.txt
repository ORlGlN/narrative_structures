- So we're headed out hiking today.
(adventurous guitar music)
- So they found a crew
for the treasure hunt.
Eat a lime?
- Oh!
(adventurous guitar music)
-  The kids are
just snuggling with Mom!
(adventurous guitar music)
(light guitar music)
- Well, we're so sad.
We're saying goodbye to
Papa and Mugga this morning.
-  Another one? Two hugs huh?
- I'll see you in February.
- I'll see you in February.
-  How old will
you be then, Laura?
- Four.
- Gotta hug Papa.
- Oh, you definitely need a hug (laughs).
My little girl.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for inviting us.
-  We're gonna be home tonight.
(light guitar music)
(kiss smacks)
- Party wave, remember, like this?
Woo! Party wave!
- Bye.
-  Bye, guys.
-  Bye.
- Have fun!
- Drive safe!
- See you soon!
(car horn honks)
- I'm sad about them.
- Me too.
-  It's sad when they go away.
- It's hard to say goodbye, huh?
Well, we just had a really
good experience as a family.
All of us were pretty sad
to see Grandma and Papa
leave this morning,
and I don't know if that's what it was,
but the kids were just going nuts.
And I started getting irritated with them,
and so I called them into the family room,
and we had 'em sit down,
and I was planning on lecturing them.
And somehow when I saw them
all sitting there on the couch,
something changed, and I felt like instead
of telling them all
about their misbehavior
we should focus on the
positive as a family.
So we grabbed some tennis balls,
and we started tossing 'em back and forth,
naming things that we
loved about our family
and things that we were grateful for
and things that were
going well in our family.
And it was amazing to see
how focusing on the positive
cheered all of us up and reminded
us of how we should behave
instead of focusing on the negative
and just getting everybody more upset.
I don't always remember
to do that as a mom,
but it's what I'm trying to do.
We ended off that activity with
Jeremy juggling for all of us.
And I think it's kind of reset our mood,
so hopefully the day can move forward with
a little bit better behavior
and a lot more happiness.
(exciting guitar music)
So we're headed out hiking today
to a place called Annie's Canyon Trail,
-  Looks awesome.
- Yeah, the pictures
online look incredible.
We're excited.
We're actually gonna meet up
with some friends there, too.
- So we're here at the trail,
and they have a pole with wet paint.
We stopped and told the kids
all about this in the car.
- Before we got out of the car.
And we're like, "don't touch it."
It was the very first thing that happened!
-  Without even
trying, it was an accident,
Laura touched it, but your
hands don't look brown.
So I think we're okay.
All right, we're at
the start of the trail.
(adventurous country music)
So this goes right up to a lagoon.
And Kendra--
- I'm very grateful that we
are in California, not Florida,
because I am terrified of alligators,
and California doesn't have alligators.
At least I don't think.
- Alligators eat you.
-  Yeah, alligators
are not friendly.
-  So we don't know what this is
or what these cones are,
we're trying to figure it out.
(adventurous country music)
- Look there's a cactus!
This is feeling very Arizon-ness.
-  Arizona-ish?
- Arizona-ish.
(adventurous country music)
Kinda tired?
- Yeah.
-  We're almost there, come on.
(adventurous country music)
I'm loving she's keeping her hat on!
- I tricked her- I gave
her a water bottle to hold.
-  Oh, she doesn't
normally like hats or hair bows.
(singing)
- You singing?
Good song.
- So we thought about getting
one of those hiking backpacks
because we're hoping to hike a bunch
while we're here in San Diego,
and then we realized, wait a
minute, Jeremy has shoulders!
(Laura singing)
- Yay.
(harmonica music)
So there's a strenuous
way, and a moderate way.
I'm wanting to try the strenuous.
Anyone else want to go with me?
- Me.
-  Me.
-  You might have
to be climbing cliffs.
- Deal.
- Deal.
So we are meeting up
with The Ohana Adventure
- Hi guys!
- and their family.
They're doing a treasure hunt right now,
and we're joining them
for the end portion of it.
- That's right, we are looking,
and hopefully we'll find
a clue or a treasure or something here.
-  This is so cool!
-  Wow!
- Yeah!
(adventurous country music)
-  Keep going!
Coming through?
Laura, I think it's gonna be good
that you're so short and skinny!
I don't know if I'm
gonna fit through here.
(adventurous country music)
Kendra! Can you fit through here with her?
- We're gonna fit.
-  Okay.
- We're coming.
-  She likes it!
She loves the adventure!
(adventurous country music).
What do you think, Caleb?
We gonna fit through?
- Yeah.
- Laura is a little nervous,
but she's being brave
and continuing up this
skinny, narrow path.
-  Whoa!
That's always comforting
when you're hiking in cliffs.
(laughs)
(adventurous country music)
Caleb!
You climbin' up?
Good job!
- This is kinda crazy, I've
never been in this place.
-  Nae Nae, you climbin'?
- I'm gonna get it
-  Keep coming.
(adventurous country music)
(light guitar music)
-  You like hiking?
- Yep-a-dee-yep.
-  Yep-a-dee-yep.
(laughs)
(adventurous island drum music)
What'd you guys think of the hike?
- I loved it!
-  Wasn't that cool?
- I did it two times!
- Yeah, that was fun.
- We went on a hike, we found a treasure!
- Woo!
(adventurous island drum music)
- Well, we were excited to hear that
The Ohana Adventure was in town
and to be able to have a
chance to meet up with them.
After our hike, we are craving food,
and so we're going to a taco stand
that is conveniently
called The Taco Stand.
(wooden clave music)
- Look at these trees, I love them!
I don't know what kind they
are, but they're gorgeous!
-  And they're good for growing.
Yeah, they are good for growing.
-  The Taco Stand.
- So when we're traveling,
I love to hear tips
for good local food,
and so we're trying this
Taco Stand place and we
hear it's really good.
(exciting drum music)
So we've heard about
this California burrito,
which is a carne asada burrito
with french fries in it.
So Jeremy's gonna give that try.
- I mean, I love a carne asada burrito.
Adding french fries to stuff
normally only makes it better.
-  They have amazing
Mexican popsicles here.
-  Our food!
- Check this out.
-  Oh this looks
so good.
-  Yum!
(exciting island music)
-  Whoa.
- So this is the California Burrito.
-  Did you get the fries?
- Yep, we're trying it.
(bouncy guitar music)
-  Eat a lime?
- Mmhm.
- Oh!
(laughs)
- Wow.
-  You want more?
You don't have to eat it,
obviously.
- Maybe.
Why did you decide to eat a lime?
Were your friends doing it?
- I really like lemons.
- Wow, that's...
-  Sour.
- That really good.
(Mexican guitar music)
-  Do you see what she's making?
- Tortillas.
-  What kind?
- Wheat?
-  Corn.
- Corn.
-  Corn tortillas.
(Mexican guitar music)
- This is really good food.
Tickle torture time!
-  Get the toes and the arms!
-  Oh no!
(screeching)
We got her!
They're like lining up for the torture.
- Wait, you want to be tortured?
That's it!
(laughing)
- This is how we help our
kids grow and get longer.
- Well, we decided to come
back out to the beach.
(Maraca music)
- We're trying this today.
You put baking powder,
- apparently.
-  Baby powder.
- (laughs) Baby powder.
On your feet and stuff
before you get in the sand
and then apparently it makes the sand
not stick to you so much,
so you don't take half the
ocean home in your car.
So this is our experiment, guys,
we'll let you know how it goes.
-  And you have
it all over your face.
Put it all over your--
- Our family has some
interesting traditions.
-  The Ohana
Adventure has a little more
expertise with the ocean.
- No, she hasn't tried it she said.
- I have never tried the baby powder.
Jackie was just telling me about it.
-  Yes.
- We just--
- We just do it after.
-  After. Afterwards.
- So they're saying baking
powder is for after.
-  Baby powder.
- Baby powder.
Man!
-  And then cook at
- I can't get this right!
-  350 degrees
for 20 minutes.
- I give up
Go play in the ocean.
-  Go get in the ocean.
(adventurous music)
Do you see all the rocks?
- Yeah.
(island music)
- Whoa!
(screaming)
-  Hop. Bop.
There we go.
It's mesmerizing.
Are you wet?
- Yeah.
-  It's inevitable.
- I just love it!
-  Set, hike!
Caleb!
- Did you get wet, dude?
-  You all wet?
- Mommy said I could.
-  Okay.
If Mom said, you go get crazy.
(fun island music)
You gonna go in and get wet?
- Yeah.
(fun island music)
(screaming)
(laughing)
- So our plan was just have
the kids play in the sand
and not get wet.
-  Yeah, that's
never gonna happen.
- Yeah, guess how well that plan worked.
- It's just too much fun.
It's too alluring.
(wave crashing)
- Janae loves the seagulls,
she's saying hello to each one.
"Hi, hi!"
-  Hey, seagull!
(light guitar music)
- You see that? "Hi!"
-  It's a doggy!
(baby squeals)
"Let me touch it!"
- So we've decided that
for Janae's first birthday
instead of inviting humans
over for a birthday party,
we should invited dogs.
(baby squeals)
-  Come back!
-  Don't go!
(baby gurgles)
(laughing)
- Yo!
- I did this.
-  This is awesome.
(light guitar music)
- So this has been a fun
stage with each of our kids
when they're getting just
old enough to really start
connecting and
communicating with all of us
and learning how to walk and talk more.
It's just a really fun time.
She's clapping!
-  Yay!
-  Look, she's wanting to stand.
Oh!
(baby babbling)
-  Now she's saying "brother."
(family cheering)
- You see her? Clap, clap, clap.
(laughing)
(family cheering)
-  She dancin'.
-  Yeah!
(Jeremy beatboxing)
- Janae just makes us so happy.
(family cheering)
She stood for a while
- Yeah, I clapped.
-  without touching anything.
- Isaac!
- Hi.
-  The kids are just
snuggling with Mom. (laughs)
What's fun though is Nae
Nae started all this.
She was just rolling around and
playing with Mom.
- Hi, Nae Nae.
(laughing)
It's 'cause I just showered so I'm clean.
(laughing)
- Good night. J House out.
-  Sometimes
you gotta get a picture,
you gotta climb with
your family down a cliff.
(bouncy music)
- Getting a family of seven
ready for family pictures.
It's not a joke.
(bouncy music)
- You can't be in California
without going to In-N-Out Burger.
(bouncy music)
