some good dance moves.
(upbeat piano music)
This morning it is my turn to host Laura's
preschool group and we are focusing on
learning the ABCs.
Close your eyes and I want
you to think of your name.
-  Close your eyes Laura.
-  And I want
you to think of the first
letter in your name.
And then when I count to
three, we're gonna all shout
the first letter in our name.
Ready?
One, two, three.
(shouting)
Today we are going to learn about letters.
Raise your hand if you
know one of the letters.
Does anybody know one of the letters?
What's a letter?
- N.
-  N, that's a great letter.
-  A, B, C, D
E, F, G.
- While Kendra's doing singing time,
our bigger kids are
hiding eggs for the kids.
(piano music)
- It's pink.
-  Good one.

You want me to do it again for you?
Ready, there it goes.
-  Throw it up and catch it.
-  Throw it up and catch it.
- I caught it.
- You caught it.
-  Good throw.
- The eggs downstairs do
not have any candy in them.
But we're gonna work together as a team
to find all the eggs.
We're gonna bring them upstairs
and have a snack at the table.
These eggs are special eggs.
Do you know what makes them special?
- [Child What?
- They have the letters
of the alphabet on them.
-  That's better than candy.
(upbeat music)
- Ready, set, go.
Good job.
-  I found one.
-  I found one in the _.
-  I found one.

we see if we got them all?
I spy with my little eye one that's blue.
- Found it.
- A,
B,
C,
everybody pass them on.

An egg, are you excited about those eggs?
(upbeat guitar music)
A told B and B told C,
I'll meet you at the
top of the coconut tree.
Skinny D and stub toe E.
It's parachute time.
(rock music)
Teddy bear, turn around.
Teddy bear, teddy bear, touch the ground.
Teddy bear, teddy bear say goodnight.
- That was too fast.
- Do you think we can do it faster?
Teddy bear, teddy bear turn around.
Teddy bear, teddy bear touch the ground.
Teddy bear, teddy bear show your shoes.
Teddy bear, teddy bear that will do.
Teddy bear, teddy bear say goodnight.
If only it really were
nap time, but it's not.
-  It's nap time for this girl.
So all of Laura's friends are gone
but now our kids are
still wanting to play.
- And stop.
One,
two,
three.
(laughter)
- Two,
three.
Let go.
Wait no.
(laughter)
-  She got it right that time.
- We're proud of myself
because I remembered
to put a freezer meal in
the crock pot this morning.
So we're gonna be having
honey sesame chicken thighs
with rice and veggies tonight.
I wish this was like smellevision
because this smells so good.
- Yes.
- Isaac is doing an online Spanish class.
- Isn't that banana?
I know _, watermelon.
I see banano.
(speaking Spanish)
- I'm doing letters with this lipstick.
-  Are you gonna
write with lipstick?
Okay, let's take it out.
Let's see what color it is.
Somebody's pretty excited.
I want you to write the letter L.
(orchestral music)
- Can put some on my lips?
-  Sure.
That is a very pinky pink.
So honestly Laura has
not been super interested
in learning her letters yet,
which I'm not worried about.
She's only four.
But when I was at the store, I saw this
and it was only $1 and I
was like, you know what,
I might as well speak Laura's language
which is makeup and see
if that might get her
interested in learning her letters
and writing them a little bit more.
- That is beautiful.
-  Very good.
- Can I put some of this
lipstick on your lips?
-  When we're done.
- Okay and Elise's?
-  Okay Laura, we're gonna
try to learn a new letter.
What's this letter?
- I don't know.
-  Do you recognize it?
- No.
-  It's a J.
- J.
-  What's J at the beginning of?
- Jump.
-  Jump is a good one.
How about J House?
- J House too.
-  Are you ready to
put some makeup on me now?
Wow, that is some pink.
(orchestral music)
-  I don't think
we're gonna get one that big.
We're wanting to get a bunch of PVC pipe
so that we can make PVC
forts with the kids.
(orchestral music)
- It's like an adventure.
(orchestral music)
-  Whoa, someone has lipstick on.
Four of these we wanna
measure six feet long
and then make a mark.
(rock music)
Push down.
Push down.
Alright, how'd it go cutting them?
- Really smooth and it wasn't too hard.
- It is funny when Kendra
talked to me about doing this
I wasn't sure at first
how I would cut the pipes.
It just sounded like it might be a pain.
Then once we went and asked some questions
and figured out how to do
it, it really is pretty easy.
- So many things in life,
they sound intimidating
but then once you do them and figure out
and ask the right questions,
it's not that hard.
-  Alright.
-  It's so easy.
-  How in the world?
That's crazy.
- And feel it.
-  This is so
smooth, that's crazy.
- That's the hardest part.
-  That's what
he uses his muscles for.
- Alright, who wants to try?
- Me.
- Try to do it all by yourself.
(groaning)
You gotta have enough weight.
So maybe-
- All my weight.
(laughter)
-  Was that hard?
- Yeah, watching Daddy it seems like that.
-  Easy?
-  Push a little harder.
Harder.
-  Can I help him?
(laughter)
- Well I'm feeling really
grateful right now.
I haven't been doing great
recently at menu planning,
but I'm trying to get back
into the groove of it.
And today I successful
had our dinner all planned
and cooking when I heard
about an older couple
from our church
congregation that's just had
a rough day and I was able to
offer to bring them dinner.
It felt so good to be able to offer that
and have it not be a big
deal because we're ready
and there's more than enough to share.
I just want to do a better
job at preparing myself
so that I'm in a place where I can serve
and give to others.
That's where I want to be.
-  Alright,
here's all of our pieces
for our PVC building kit.
- Can we make one big fort?
-  Yep, make
whatever you guys want.
-  Our thing is
gonna be exactly six foot.
I need a corner piece everyone.
(upbeat music)
- Strongest Dad on Earth.
-  Good job Nae-nae.
(laughter)
- We're going to make a tube
system between the hallways.
-  Like a telephone?
(upbeat music)
- Six foot.
-  Oh is the phone gonna
go all the way up to your bed?
I love it.
- It's not gonna be able to,
it's not sturdy enough.
Talk to me again.
- Oh hey dude.
- I can hear you perfectly.
(upbeat music)
- So right now we can talk to everybody.
(upbeat music)
- How's it going yo?
-  Good yo.
(giggles)
-  How's it doing yo?
(piano music)
- No I haven't seen it.
- I'm gonna show the kids something cool
Watch.
(piano music)
-  That's beautiful.
-  Do you hear the music?
Whoa, you can hear it like really good.
-  I know.
I can blow to everyone and
it'll be like air conditioning.
-  Try it.
- I hear ya, I can feel it.
We're giving you guys air conditioning.
(laughter)
- I'm gonna see if I
can blow strong enough
to get it over to the girls.
(giggles)
Mom, if you want we could
have one right here for you.
We'll make it-
-  I wanted it to
all the way into our room.
- We could do that.
Kids, wake up.
We'll just do it from here.
-  No, it's more
like kids, go to bed.
- We thought about doing that.
- Everybody could talk to
each other in the nighttime,
the whole time.
-  Uh oh, this
might not go with bedtime.
I'm crazy impressed.
I thought for sure Jeremy had
helped the kids with that.
But the kids apparently
did it all on their own.
That's amazing to me.
Anyone that can hear me, go to bed.
(laughter)
-  Goodnight, J House out.
-  Goodnight, J House out.
- Bye
- Bye.
-  What are you guys doing??
- Vlogging.
(upbeat music)
- I decided when I'm older,
I'm never gonna grow up.
-  Laura, you're doing awesome.
- Thanks.
- Isaac's doing the coolest
thing, you gotta see this.
