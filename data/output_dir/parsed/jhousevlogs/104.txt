(light music)
- Yeah!
- This is what I'm talkin' 'bout, baby!
-  So much pumpkin spice here.
- Could we buy some?
- Never shop hungry or you'll
buy really yummy stuff!
Whoa!
That is a huge nest.
Did you guys see this?
- You spent all my money!
(he laughs)
(light music)
(baby making noises)
(laughing)
(baby making noises)
-  The laugh that's almost a cry.
-  She's tired.
-  'Kay, ready?
Stand up!
- Come on.
Come on.
Yeah!
(Kendra laughs)
- You're walking!
You're walking!
- What are doing?
-  You're walking!
-  (laughs) She loves it.
So Jeremy's pulling just a little bit
and she is takin' steps!
- Yay!
Yeah, she was giving me five this morning.
-  She does everything.
She's like a full-fledged kid.
She's like, I may be eight
months old, but I'm a human.
-  She reads already.
(Kendra laughs)
Gimme five.
-  Well, time to
start helping with the chores.
- You walked.
(piano playing)
- We're headed to the grocery store.
Check it out.
I got the best parking spot!
Front row, it's amazing!
It's amazing how a little thing
like a really good
parking spot can get you
really excited and pump
you up for the day.
That's our van!
Isn't that the best parking spot ever?
It just feels great.
We are making dinner for some neighbors
that are sick tonight
and so I need to pick up
some stuff from the store.
You don't want any bruising on 'em.
You don't want 'em too green.
(happy music)
Those are really green.
- I know.
I just like 'em.
-  It does look
cool but I don't know
if you'd wanna eat 'em.
My favorite salad's on sale.
We're gonna get this one to
go with our dinner tonight.
You wanna grab another one, Lisey?
- So with having five kids,
we know it's so important
to find time one on one with each kid.
So right now Caleb and I--
-  Are gonna build--
- A dump truck kit!
-  That's right.
(energetic music)
(tool drilling)
Good job, buddy.
(energetic music)
(tool drilling)
So Caleb, did we make a little mistake?
Yeah.
Right at the start, our
very first thing we did,
we did wrong, but we've fixed it.
How did we fix it?
- We took it off and
put it on the right one.
-  That's right.
(energetic music)
- This is what I'm talkin' 'bout, baby!
-  This is a toy for
eight year olds and older.
- I guess I'm a good builder.
-  I guess you are.
Is that the dump truck?
-  Mm hm.
-  Alright.
Let's go finish our dump truck.
-  Look how
cute these cookies are!
-  I want to be a pilgrim.
- You like the pilgrim one?
So Jeremy and I have been watching
the British Cooking Baking
Show and so I feel like
all these fancy things, I'm
just wanting to try them all.
Oh, my goodness, guys!
Look at these!
Look at them!
Oh, they're beautiful!
Look at this baklava.
Look it's a pecan creme tart.
Ooh, look at these caramel apples.
Look at this red velvet one!
Oh, look!
These are little pretzels!
-  I like all the donuts.
- You're a donut dude?
So I've been doing most of
my grocery shopping online
so we haven't been coming to
the store as much with my kids
and it's been a good review
today to be here together
because we're remembering our
manners at the grocery store
and we are also remembering other things
that you learn at the grocery store,
like how to tell when fruit is ripe
and how to look for the
best deal on something.
For example, this can
of black beans is $1.28
but this can of black beans,
how much is that one, Lisey?
- 79.
-  79 cents.
- Hey, that's cheaper!
-  Yep.
What does this remind you guys of?
-  Pumpkin spice challenge.
-  There is so
much pumpkin spice here.
- Could we buy some?
-  I think we
have enough pumpkin spice
to last us forever.
(peaceful music)
- Shhhh.
Drop.
(sanding)
-  You're trying to sand it?
(truck rolling)
(objects dropping)
There we go.
It dumps.
- Let's go pick up some more trash.
-  So we're
teaching 'em how to look at
the dates on the milk.
The bakery gives out cookies
to the kids while we're shoppin'.
Are you excited that you're still a kid?
- Mm hm.
- In not too long, you're
gonna be a big person
and then you're gonna be
like me and not get a cookie.
I'm in a moment of weakness and I got
one of these sugar cookies.
It's decorated like pumpkin pie!
It's so cute!
This is just a friendly
reminder, never shop hungry
or you'll buy really yummy stuff.
Mm.
- Have a good day.
-  Thank you, you too.
- When you're shopping with
Mum, you buy a ton of sweets
because she has a sugar tooth.
-  Is that true?
- Mm hm.
- I also bought lots of fruits and veggies
but here's the thing.
This is why I shop online because then
I can't be tempted by
everything in the store
and this cart's getting heavy to push.
Pineapples are only 99 cents.
That pretty much means we have to get one
and they look good.
- I felt like I needed
a treat after building
so we ate chips, salsa, watched a video.
-  Whoa.
Thanks, Lisey!
Thanks for helpin', bud.
We missed you at the store.
Did you have fun with Dad?
- Yep.
- So after I had Janae,
I lost a lot of hair.
That's kind of a normal thing that happens
after you have a baby
and then you're bald,
which is kind of annoying
and then your hair
starts growing back and
it gets really annoying
because it's this perfect
length that it can't,
do you guys see this?
My hair right there is
too short to fit back
into my bun and things but it's too long,
so it sticks out oddly.
This too shall pass.
And it was still worth it for Janae.
Thanks for helpin'.
-  Yeah.
- Thanks for buying us stuff.
-  Thanks for payin' for it.
- Dad, how much do you think this is?
-  How much did it cost?
- Yep.
-  I don't know.
Caleb, you wanna give it a guess?
How much money did all this cost?
- I'm guessing like 104.
-  104 dollars.
Alright, Laura has a guess.
- 80.40.
(Jeremy laughs)
- 8,040 bucks.
- I'm gonna guess 120 dollars.
-  Dun, dun, dunnn.
- What is it?
- The actual retail price is--
- 198.
-  198?
-  Yup.
- I was way off.
(sad trombone playing)
You spent all my money!
(he laughs)
- Alright.
It's time to assemble dinner.
I'm gonna make chicken
tortilla soup in the Crock-Pot.
It's one of my favorite
meals and it's pretty easy.
So we have two Crock-Pots.
So we're gonna make two batches.
(peaceful music)
So the boys have been
outside playing sports
and bird watching and they
just discovered this huge bird.
Oh, my goodness.
-  Black Bird.
-  That thing is huge!
-  We named him Black Bird.
We were playing basketball
and I just saw that.
-  I wonder what
kind of a bird it is?
-  I think it's, I
think it's a golden eagle.
-  It's kind of hard
to see with all the leaves.
-  Yeah.
It's camouflage.
- I'm guessing it's a golden eagle
but it could be a lot of other things.
Like a falcon?
- Mum, is it a giant?
-  It's not a giant.
It's just a large bird.
So it's definitely a bird of prey.
Whoa!
That is a huge nest!
(she gasps)
-  Or hawk.
- Oh my goodness.
So this nest is ginormous.
Check that out!
I mean, so there's the tree.
There's the nest.
That thing's huge.
Oh, this is a good view of the bird.
(peaceful music)
- Just go up that bridge
and then there it is.
-  So what's your guess?
- I guess he's a hawk or a golden eagle.
-  That would be amazing.
- I just hope that that's its nest
and he's gonna have like 20 kids.
-  You think so?
- Now I see him!
- He's big.
I really like the fall.
It's pretty out here.
-  There's a bubble.
(laughing)
- It's floating.
- The kids are very excited.
(giggling)
-  Let's get the thing.
-  There's the bubble.
-  Maybe it'll float forever.
Janae, you see the bubble?
Is it going up again?
-  Yeah!
-  It survived!
- This guy is a survivor.
-  The bubble popped.
It went to bubble heaven.
- Mm hm.
- So sad.
(Jeremy laughs)
Mom, can you please wash your hands?
-  I did.
-  In memory of Survivor.
- No, they want more bubbles.
So the soup that I made for my neighbor
and our soup, they're right here.
They're almost done cooking.
I just put the cornbread into the oven.
This is our favorite kind of cornbread.
- Uh huh.
It's like a cake but if
we put frosting on it,
then it'll taste more like a cake.
-  It's true.
But we'll just call it cornbread
so we can eat it with dinner.
Sometimes the hardest part
of taking dinner to somebody
is trying to figure out
how to get it over there
without spilling it.
Transporting dinner can be a challenge.
What are you doing?
Your little face looks so innocent
but look at the mess that you have made!
So I know that for about the next year
my house and my floor is going to
perpetually look like this.
There's going to be stuff everywhere
and it's because that is how
this age learns and discovers.
They have to take everything
out and look at it
and turn it around and touch it
and put it in their
mouths and that's okay.
Mess just goes along with the territory.
I'm glad that she's
learning and exploring.
I love her little curious mind.
-  Good night.
J House out.
(energetic music)
- My name is Queen Esile.
- All of my dating Mom is in this journal.
-  This is the recommended way
to dry your nails, right?
- So she's graduating to this toy.
(energetic music)
-  So you're writing
about your Disneyland trip?
(energetic music)
