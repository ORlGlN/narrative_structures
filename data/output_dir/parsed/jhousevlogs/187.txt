look at that thing
he did it he writes love okay this is
really good I haven't played the piano
in two years can't and she's like whoa
wow she looks freedom at all she's done
no word I'm doing a camp a ballet camp
it's going to be every single day and
I'm really excited so we're sitting here
at the kitchen table eating watermelon
you craziest bug I'm going to see if I
can go outside and get a closer look
without it flying away look at that
thing it looks like a sugar snap pea
that is so cool
what do you think it might be it were
asked author of the conversion of a
grass what do you think I was it looks
like a praying mantis but it's not
paying I know it looks a little
different than a praying mantis I mean
it looks just like a sugar snap pea but
it's a bug why did just climbing around
well look at its antennas it's like oh
my goodness what are you
so one over to the window and totally
bring dealies and amber out okay if you
know what that bug is let us know in the
comments below I'm going to try to see
if I can look it up online because I'm a
nerd like that and I love to do that
kind of stuff there goes the bug
goodbye bugs all right so I think I
searched large green bug so it's not a
praying mantis it's like this one which
is apparently a giant katydid so that
looks like it came up what do you think
is that the kind of bug we're dealing
with so I think gasps look at the mouth
the antennas are alone and psychology so
it says it's related to a cricket and a
grasshopper so you guys are right so you
figured out you can still braid your
hair oh my goodness that's awesome
does janae like it you're trying to do
your hair do you like your you can't
work it we're going to a Royals baseball
game tonight and we put some water in
the freezer to try to freeze I saw us on
Pinterest where you can't move it but
you let it create for like an hour and
it just gets really cold but when you
sew it's just water right now like when
you drop it it turns to ice so it's just
water
now I guess you can say I don't know
a bunch of people from our church
congregation are getting together and
tailgating before the game tonight
because they're loyal
I asked Laura on the way here we want a
baseball game if she does play
basketball so I'm pretty excited it has
