-  Is your room really messy?
What?
Did you clean your room this morning?
- Yep.
-  You are awesome.
High five.
- I deep cleaneded it.
-  You deep cleaned it.
- Look, there's nothing over here.
-  What?
- And then there's nothing
on the side of that.
And I made it so that it's.
The thing's not like on the ground.
-  Oh like you
made it nicely?
- So then you wouldn't trip.
-  Oh it looks so nice.
Lise, way to go.
(upbeat music)

I only have a chair body.

Isaac's up.
♫ I'm taking my time on my ride
-  One 10 is larger, right?
- Elise's new math book came in the mail.
How are you liking it?
- Really good.
-  Yeah?
It's starting off with some
review, which is always nice.
We're doing some place value work today.
Alright, what number did
you build for me today?
- 336!
-  Got it.
Elise and I are pretty excited.
We figured out how to
pull her hair back today
into like a ponytail.
- Not going.
(bright music)
-  Football math?
- Yep.
-  Question, is football math
better than regular math?
- 10 times better.
-  10 times better?
(upbeat music)
-  Is this the
material that Laura chose?
-  Yeah, is this your blanket?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
-  How fun.
- Okay, keep pressing the pedal.
-  Good job Laura. (laughing)
- Okay, we gotta take out the pin.
Can you do it?
Pull it inside out.
Grab the edge and pull.
-  I can't remember
what her material is.
I'm excited to see what you chose.
- Read, grab it and pull it out.
- A pillow case!
- Yeah, it's a big blanket.
We have to turn it inside out first, huh?
They're ladybugs.
-  Ladybugs.
- Hey, here's your blanket.
- Can you hold it out?
- Yeah, we gotta finish
pulling it inside out.
- Can I hold it out, all by myself?
- Laura wants to do every
step all by herself.
-  You gonna
give it to little kids
who need blankets?
- AT the hospital at...
That people are sick.
-  Yeah?
- I just love them.
And I wish it could be mine.
-  Sometimes it's
hard to give stuff away, huh?
We're proud of you for
being will to share.
Is it a cape?
- No, I'm just messing with it.
- 
You're just snuggling in it?
- It could be my blanket every day.
- Hey, we gotta iron it
so we can sew it again.
-  So what are you working on?
- I just finished my dream home.
-  You designed your dream home?
- Yeah, and I wanna try
to make it sometime.
-  Alright, well tell me about it.
What's it like?
- There's a front room just
like a normal front room.
But just bigger.
It's like when you come in,
when you're checking
into a hotel, the lobby.
And then, there's a mother's
area and nursing area,
just for like the moms.
Then there's a water
park right next to that.
-  Kinda like Great Wolf Lodge?
- Yeah.
There's a lotta bedrooms.
-  These are
the bedrooms over here?
- Yep.
There has to be bathrooms.
There's a big theme park and a playground.
And a football stadium.
♫ If I could turn back time
♫ To the good old days
♫ When my mama sang us to sleep
♫ And now we're stressed out
Cubby you're gonna need the hammer
for what we're doing next.
-  Two hammers?
-  Yeah, why don't
you give one to Elise?
Laura, you can help us too,
you're gonna hammer too.
- I don't really get what we're doing.
- I know, I've seen that thing
in the garage for a while.
- So Kendra and I recently
picked up croquet.
And I know the kids have tried it,
but we've never really
played it as a family.
- What is it?
-  Do you wanna try it?
Okay, check this out.
(bright music)
-  So excited.
-  Are you excited?
- Yes.
It's like a little.
-  It's a fun game.
Okay, so we first hammer in a stake.
- I got it.
-  Ooo, good spot.
Alright, do you guys wanna play?
- Yeah.
- Yes yes.
-  Pick a color.
Elise is blue.
- Because I'm wearing blue.
- Yeah, that makes sense.
Alright we're starting
our first game of croquet.
(happy music)
Good job!
(laughing)
- That counts!
-  Oh, good try.
Oh, almost.
Alright Cub.
(laughing)
Try to hit that stake.
No! (laughing)
You got it!
Okay, go ahead Caleb.
Now you're trying to hit her,
but Caleb, if you go
through one of those gates,
then you're out.
He's trying to get you.
Oh he just barely missed.
She has to, yeah there you go.
If he goes through the gate he's out.
Oh he got it!
Caleb wins this game.
Good job Caleb.
(playful music)
He makes it through!
(all cheering)
Whoa!
- Oh, too far.
Oh!
-  Mom wins!
- Alright, can you jump us?
Whoo!
(laughing)
She's like, what's up?
-  She's loving it.
- I'm on my tummy, so then I won't jump.
-  Double trouble right there.
-  We doing a
simple dinner tonight?
- Uh huh.
-  Macaroni and cheese.
- Yep, it's my favorite.
Cub doesn't like macaroni and cheese.
Can I stir it?
-  Sure.
- So there's a funny
story behind the shirt
that I'm wearing today.
I bought this shirt months ago,
like back in July, which is like what,
three months ago at this point?
Anyway, I bought it, I brought it home,
I tried it on and I was like
I don't know if I really like it,
so I put it back in the bag
and decided to return it.
But I never got around
to actually returning it.
So I was cleaning out
my closet the other day
and I found it and I was like
oh, it's been too long to return it now,
I guess I'm gonna have to keep it.
So I walk out of the bathroom
and Jeremy's like, "I love your shirt.
"Where did you get that?
"When did you get it?
"How long have you had it?"
And I'm like oh.
So it's just funny because it's a shirt
that I didn't intend to keep
that now I actually
kinda like and he likes.
So it's like a happy accident
that I have this shirt.
And I, yeah, that was
kind of a long story.
I got dressed today, yay!
-  Alright we just had
a break through with Janeanea
that we wanted to share.
- We actually wanna test it
and see if it was just a fluke.
-  Yeah.
- Hey Janae, gimme five.
Gimme five.
She totally gave you five.
-  Yeah, she did it.
Let's see, maybe she
wants to give Dad a five.
(all laughing)
That was the most adorable.
- Let's try.
Everybody give me five and
then maybe she'll gimme five.
-  Yeah!
(all laughing)
-  Goodnight, Jhouse out.
(upbeat music)
- What?
Was that awesome?
That is so much candy.
And then I hear Jeremy say "I
feel asleep on the toilet."
Who wants some more baby
peas, raise your hand.
- Look at these dresses.
-  First hot
chocolate of the season.
- Yep, it's a real pumpkin.
