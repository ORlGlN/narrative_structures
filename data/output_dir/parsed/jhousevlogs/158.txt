-  Janae's learning a new game.
- Peek-a-boo!
(perplexed music)
So this morning we have a panel
that we need to go to,
and we wanted to eat some
breakfast before we go.
And we did room service this morning.
- And it's so cute, look at it!
- Look here's our cute little jams
and jellies come in these.
-  Look how cute it is!
-  Why does that make me so happy?
It's a little Tabasco serving size.
- Granny Jo just got here.
- Well, we got here at one
o'clock in the morning.
-  Yeah.
-  And so this is
what we're gonna use, okay,
to make our waffles today.
- My cousins are gonna be coming over.
Eeeek.
-  Dumping in batter!
(laughing)
Laura burped!
-  Laura burped?
- And there's the grin!
We're headed into our first panel now.
She's the star of the show.
- Yeah, you can't go wrong on
a panel when you have this.
Nugget of joy!
-  So Laura,
what are we gonna do today?
- So, we're gonna go
on a trampoline place.
- We're gonna go to Skyzone
and then go to a fun pizza place.
- When I was a little,
Grandma, I didn't like Skyzone.
But now I do.
-  What are
you doing with your paper?
- I'm cutting the top of it.
-  Janae's learning a new game!
-  Peek-a-boo, yeah!
Ha!
Ha!
Hey!
(giggling)
Hey!
(laughing)
We've tried to play this
with her so many times
and she's never done it and
now she's doing it on her own.
-  Janae you
learned to play peekaboo
in Washington D.C., let the record show.
Where's Janae?
- Peekaboo!
- We are at SkyZone.
(fun upbeat music)
- So something about me
that Jeremy obviously knows
is that I love trying new things.
Like, whenever we go to
a new state I wanna try
food that they are known for
and what's special about them.
And so we came over here to,
we're on M Street somewhere.
It's like the--
- It's really nice.
- It's like the shopping
district but there's a pizzeria
that we heard we had
to try, so we did that.
And now, a cupcakery.
Apparently they were on TV
guys, so we're gonna try that.
But there's actually a line.
(soft upbeat music)
-  13, 14
-  It's so hard
to decide which one.
This is it, so we ordered their
Chocolate Ganache cupcake.
Which, they said, is one
of their best sellers.
And then we also ordered a
Salted-Caramel chocolate chip one
which we're excited to try.
- Tastes like a cupcake!
- I think it's a really,
really good cupcake!
-  It is good!
-  Woo!
(fun music)
Woo!
- So we're doing a meet-up in the lobby.
And we're meeting up with people here.
And Katie's birthday is today.
She came out from Virginia.
- Happy birthday!
Signing a Jay house on
a ukulele that's cool!
- One of our favorite
things is getting to meet
with people on the other
side of the camera.
Ya know we stand around and we
talk to this little machine.
But connecting and seeing
the people and hugging them
and talking to you, that's what
makes it real and valuable.
So we love getting to meet with you.
- We are with our family
and we're eating pizza!
(instrumental music)
-  So you
like to dip that in there
and then you eat it?
Woo hoo!
- One time, I was a big girl
and I knew how to tie this.
-  Okay, well
who made this crown?
- Ali, I'm queen and I'm a little bit,
and I'm pretending to marry
to Michael, pretending.
-  Oh, you're just pretending?
So is this kind of like a wedding crown?
- We're trying an ice cream roll place,
which we've never done before,
so I'm excited about this.
Because, basically, I like ice
cream, so it has to be good.
And we're with Sam and
Nia, there they are!
(bright instrumental music)
So this one is mine, I
got an Oreo cookie one.
Oh my goodness.
How cool is that?
-  It's like it does taste
like regular ice cream, but.
- So they actually used a blow-torch
to get the texture on
the top of my cream here.
How cool is that?
It's a meringue.
- [Kendra[ Jenae really likes Sam.
- You love my beard?
- So we found a book
festival and I'm so excited.
I'm like giddy.
- She's super excited about.
- Kate DiCamillo is here
and Chris Van Dusen is here?
Oh my goodness, hey, we
gotta go find the elevator!
- We're such nerds, really
Kendra's more of the nerd
in this category than I am though.
- So, how do I get to
the children's table.
National Book Festival.
- So Jack pulled up next to
John head and sat soundly
under the stars.
- See there's a book signing?
You can, like, buy books and
have the author sign them
and you can meet the authors.
That would be so cool.
Yeah, mama?
Mama.
- It's funny how many
different things are going on
right at the same time that
attract different crowds.
You have the playlist YouTuber people.
The National Book Fest
for people like Kendra.
- And people that fit in everywhere.
We all fit in everywhere.
- And then there's a college
football game going on.
West Virginia is playing a
game, like, within a mile
of where we're at right now.
So there's all these different people
going their different places.
(instrumental music)
- Do you guys wanna hear a
sad story, I know Jeremy does.
- Woe is us!
- So, maybe this is an embarrassing,
we're not super smart smart, story.
Anyway, what happened was,
we got to the Supreme Court
and the Capitol Building two
minutes after they closed.
And we're so bummed about it.
So we're not going to get to see
the inside of these buildings at all.
I'm feeling kind of silly
because we prioritized eating,
but I really was starving.
And then Janae was hungry,
and it just took a long while.
But you know that feeling
when you're so excited
to see something and then
you arrive two minutes
after it closes?
Yeah, it kind of stinks!
- Isn't it ironic?
-  don't you think?
(trumpet music)
- So this is the spot I've
been wanting to come to.
Look, behind me is the Capital
Building and in front of me
is the Washington Monument.
I was excited to stand right here.
So, here I am.
You having fun with Daddy?
- You have food all over
you, don't get her dirty.
Just like a far-away hug, aw!
-  we had so much fun hanging out
with Paul and Katie.
We were on a panel together,
and it was just fun to be with them.
♫ That I'm not
♫ And I just wanna be
a little more something
♫ I love you like I've never been afraid
-  So, they have a really cool
green room here at Playlist.
My favorite thing,
though, is that they have
ping-pong and foosball.
Me and Jacob from the Ballinger
family are going at it.
- So these guys have been
going on the foosball table
for a long time, they just keep at it.
They are so excited.
(fun music)
(cheering and clapping)
So everywhere we have
gone and every person that
we have seen on this trip
has just loved on Janae.
She brings so much joy.
It's just amazing to
me to see how much joy
one little human can bring to the world.
She does it.
-  Everyone loves her.
- Stick out that tongue.
It's funny though, whenever
we get anywhere near kids,
she like starts freaking out.
Like, she's getting all excited
and she starts screeching.
She definitely misses her
big brothers and sisters.
- For sure.
- Who are you, what's your name?
-  Say, I'm Janae.
- And she's so cute, you're
coming on my channel.
Is that okay?
Yeah, you part of the Zam-fam?
- This is Rebecca Zamolo.
She's been doing a prank
all over Playlist about
dropping a fake baby.
And so we're showing that
she really does like babies.
- Yeah, I really don't drop
babies on a normal basis.
- Not real babies.
(instrumental music)
Strollers at the Lincoln
Memorial, it's awesome.
- There's how many steps, not a problem.
Look you can see the Washington Monument.
(piano music)
Well, Playlist was an awesome experience.
We loved all the people that we met.
There were other creators.
And the viewers that we were able to meet.
That was probably my favorite part.
And then being on panels and workshops.
That was a fun experience,
we hadn't done that before.
At least I hadn't done that before
and it was fun to be able
to hear people stories,
and answer their questions
and share our thoughts.
So now, we're excited to fly
home and see our little kids.
I am so excited to see Janae
see the big kids again.
Like, I think here eyes
are just gonna light up.
She has missed them, and so have we.
(bright music)
We have the whole train to ourselves.
- That's what happens when
you're flying in the middle
of the night with a sleeping baby.
- That's the good part of flying
in the middle of the night.
Here I am, I bet it echos
pretty nice in here.
What should we sing for you today?
-  The Sound of Music.
♫ The hills are alive
You woke up the baby.
- No!
With the sound of music, la, la, la.
I'm gonna hold on tight!
(piano music)
-  Goodnight J House out.
- J.
- J.
-  J.
- House.
- House.
-  Out.
-  Out.
- J.
- House.
- J.
- House.
- J.
- J.
- House.
- House.

- Bye Dad!
(laughing)
