Mackey
looks great I did it as fast as I could
because Gil was like we wanted to catch
you yeah awesome you just don't see that
every day when you're driving down the
street
these motorcycle guys are just doing
tricks on the freeway excited we're
heading up
the Chiefs fans get a little excited
so what was going through your mind when
you first saw this dude pretty cool
so warm when when the flames went out I
saw that it that the whole thing would
just catch on fire
so I know a preseason game isn't the
same thing as a real game but it was
still a lot of fun there was still a lot
of energy and excitement and it was so
great to be that rep Isaac
so we're here in the Kansas City Chiefs
Hall of Fame section during Hatton and
Isaac is working up stats on some of the
players so one of my clients that I have
represented actually invited Isaac Nye
to go to the game tonight and they were
just so nice bill and his son were a lot
of fun because his son loves football he
knows all the stats and so we thought
that Isaac would be a great combo and
the two of them were really fun talking
about the game together so we had some
friends come up and say hi thanks for
saying hi to us we love it
with five minutes left we're winning 16
to 6 they scored a field go so the nm
game is 16 to 9 with about with like one
second Plus and then they threw a Hail
Mary
all right that play was with no time
left there's no time and they just want
to touch down on the last one
you want to go to another one
so Isaac would you think of your first
NFL game what was your favorite part the
very end because it was so intense I
mean you didn't like that we lost though
right - losing dad rather win hmm good
night Jay house out how does it feel to
have dyslexia uh sometimes we write like
words backwards alright I have a
confession I'm a super nerd fireflies
don't get another one
