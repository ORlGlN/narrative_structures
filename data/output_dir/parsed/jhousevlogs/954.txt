hi my name is Allen and I'm going to
tell you what I do for make up each
morning hi my name is Elise with Dan and
and I'm emceeing you know how I do me
very hard to find
um oh there it is right there we open
the eyeshadow and you just put on your
eyes so it pops out it makes your eyes
stand out a little more it's just very
hard to open it so we take a while do it
quickly
okay let's do something different
put in this jar add oh yeah
careful base reddit careful man he
didn't rub it oh what a nice brother but
it's under I'd sometimes I like putting
it places other than my eye just to make
it seem out in the world
so yeah okay just to stroke it doesn't
know
basically what you do I just let it all
out with a finger painting session on my
face and hope for the best
it's a quick little back and forth on
the cheese herbs too
