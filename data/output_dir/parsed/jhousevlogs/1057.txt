- So of April of this year, it's 2014,
I stumbled across my first family vlog.
It was Sam and Nia.
I was like, well these
are just family videos
and I was kinda surprised that
1000 people had watched it,
but they were a fun family and it was fun
to watch what they were doing.
And then I stumbled across
other family vloggers,
the next one I found was the Shaytards
and they had five to six
hundred thousand people
watching every single day,
and that blew my mind,
I was baffled and at
first really confused,
like why are people watching
these 15 to 20 minute
home videos every day of this family?
As I kept watching, I
realized that you really
start to learn, you learn the family,
you learn their inside jokes and you start
to feel like you're building
a relationship with them.
- It's very similar to when
you're watching a sitcom
or when you're watching a reality TV show,
except for this is more
casual and in some ways,
that makes it feel more
intimate environment.
- And you can interact with
them, you can tweet them,
you can follow their
Facebook page and they might
respond to you, which
happens occasionally.
That led me then to a
bunch of other family vlogs
and I realized that this is
a whole genre of YouTube.
- Jeremy and I just have
been really impressed
with several of the vlogs
that we've come across
and watching their families in action.
- A lot of different family
vloggers have done and said
things that have been inspiring
to us and have motivated me
to wanna go forward and do a family vlog.
- We're excited to have a
family vlog channel of our own.
- So I put in the links
below a lot of the channels
that we love, some of the family vloggers
that are some of our favorites
so you can look through
and check our their channels
and see what they're doing.
- What is a family vlog?
Alright, Jeremy.
You better share his
head cold up high from me
so I don't have no double chin.
Thank you, hi.
(laughs)
- Yeah, so.
There it is.
- Okay.
And that concludes this episode
of What Is a Family Vlog?
- So I'm gonna just try it one more time.
- See ya there.
