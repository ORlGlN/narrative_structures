- Laura woke up super early this morning,
and so I was going to attempt
to try to sleep on the
couch while she was awake,
and so I created some barricades,
see I put her down there with some toys,
and I like blocked off everything,
I moved the couch over here
so she couldn't fall down the stairs.
Now that I'm waking up a little bit more
I realize this might
not be a very good idea.
(lighthearted, upbeat music)
- I get asked a lot
about how I home school
different kids at different ages,
because their abilities are all different,
and this morning as we
were doing our activity
I thought I'd grab the camera to show you
because this is an activity
that worked really well
with their different age levels,
so what we did today is we
went shopping as a family.
I have these alphabet cards here,
and the kids would just
pick an alphabet card,
and then they would take
their letter downstairs,
and one at a time they
would pick out a toy,
so for example with B you could do
a ball or a bandana or whatever.
Elise did you just buy a princess outfit?
-  Mm hmm.
-  What letter did you have?
- P.
-  P, what sound does P make?
- P-p-p princess.
- And I just did T.
-  You just did
T, what did you buy?
- These, um, these make trails.
-  Those make trails, very nice.
Caleb, I would ask him to count
a certain number of
coins into the container,
so I didn't ask him to
differentiate between any of them,
I just asked him to be
counting, and I helped him.
Elise, when she paid for things,
I gave her a number and a specific type,
so we talked about the
difference between these,
so she would find six dimes,
or she would count,
y'know, seven quarters,
so she was differentiating between type
and talking to me about them,
and then with Isaac I could just tell him,
that costs a dollar and 17 cents,
and he would count that out.
- Four quarters, one dime,
one nickel and two pennies.
- So my other favorite
thing about this activity is
because I have them shopping downstairs,
I got to teach them one at a time,
and so I was here counting with Elise
and teaching her about the coins,
and then I would instruct
her on her next letter,
and she would go downstairs to find
something that represented
that letter's sound,
and by that point Isaac
was coming up or Caleb,
and it ended up being a
really great activity.
It probably only took us about 20 minutes,
and I think they each just
did four things maybe,
but that was reviewing letter sounds,
it was playing, and it was also
working on money and numbers,
so now we're gonna go
in to our reading time.
But that's just one example
of one of the hands-on activities,
we'll still be doing
Isaac's math book later,
but this is just a kind of
morning interactive activities that we do.
Uhm I just noticed in the
background this awesome sauce.
- That's so Kendra.
Kendra will have seven
cups in the bedroom,
like all half full.
- Hey, at least two of
those are in the bathroom,
and then there's like
three on the counter,
I just, apparently
really like to have cups,
and they usually all have
about that much water in them.
Guess I'm just not a
finisher, can't do it.
We got the crazy thing.
- The Mesh Eater.
- The Mesh Feeder Eater.
It's got 'nanna in it,
whaddya think big girl?
-  She's like ehh.
- Yes, you are a recorded child.
Does it taste yummy?
-  Oop, she's going for more.
Oh, sick, try again, try again.
-  That was classic.
Great face there Laura.
(Laura gurgling)
Oh, buh, buh, buh, buh?
Say goodnight.
- Say nap time, nap time.
- After a long morning,
nap time is delicious.
(lighthearted, upbeat music)
