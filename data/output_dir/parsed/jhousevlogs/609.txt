so we're going to Legoland today and
Kendra and I didn't want to be late
we're late for everything normally so I
set the clocks 10 minutes fast
Kendra told me that we needed to be here
15 minutes earlier and we actually
needed to be here and we're here thirty
minutes before we need to be here
yours are locked no one's in line yet so
we're the first in line there's a
limited amount of tickets we're really
excited too because Julian Landon are
with us they have the YouTube channel
Julie Giroux
yeah
but the drags
alright thanks for saving the Frances
so in this room they're showing us how
they make Legos how they mix the plastic
granules and then they melt it down at
446 degrees Fahrenheit and then they use
a mold to mold it AK into a Lego ring so
this is a scale that shows how much you
weigh in Lego bricks so Isaac you a
almost seven thousand let's see how much
I weigh oh it takes almost 40,000 Lego
bricks to weigh as much as I
yeah you get to hide yellow right with
you anchor that's right
I salute those things I was always short
Sylmar was so bummed that she's not tall
enough to ride the ride she ran over to
the ruler sign and she like stretched up
and she said yep big enough and she went
running in I guess she really wants to
ride I'm sorry
at least what did you think you were
fired
so this place is really cool you know
it's cool when the parents are having as
much fun as the kids all right so the
boys are building a tower and by boys I
mean the dad
it's awesome they get Kansas City places
and so to see all the places we're
familiar with this is where we go to the
cheese paid back and come on
the boys are racing the cars
so I've never been to a 4d movie before
I'm excited apparently you wear 3d
glasses and then also like if there's
mist
there's like really mr. if there's snow
I don't know I'm excited
so cover you tried to leave the theater
what do you ever sit out there yeah the
little bubble maker up there is gonna
turn on and it's going to come down on
that bubbly camera because then they'll
get bubbles on it yeah we don't want
bubbles on the camera fine did you like
it it can be so hard with kids to leave
a fun place like this
not yet not yet
so Legoland ends in a Lego store I think
my kids could get lost in here alone
Legoland was awesome we had a fun lunch
and we had so much fun with these guys
it's real bad though buddy yeah it was
great so now we're gonna go home and
have quiet time and nap time
let's give me lovey except for you what

people all right so we're home from
Legoland Laura's napping Jeremy went
back up to work and Caleb is helping me
get ready for his birthday party which

get a whole scoop you want to fill it
all the way up that yeah that's great
you're being so careful oh good job let
me squeeze it together Hey look I'm very
impressed so we're hanging out playing
play-doh and Caleb said something that
all I can say and I don't know where
they got it from
he said easy peasy lemon squeezy I'm
aware that comes from does that come
from a show or a movie or a book like
how think Jeremy are I either say that
but I think we've started saying it
since the kids have started saying it
but does that ever happen to you guys
where there's expressions that you can't
quite place like where did that come
from
let's see what you made down here boom
it looks like poo right guys right
Caleb built like a play-doh monster
creepy soul or I just woke up from her
nap and I was pouring her melt into her
bottle and a little tiny dribble like
spilled on the edge of the bottle and
rolled down the side and she goes milk
crying mom milk crying if I was so cute
I love looking at the world through a
kid's perspective like they just see
things different and make interesting
connections
I was snuggling both my babies
even laying there smuggling love it
drunk though eat some dinner watch too
good wine
any special steps that's how we need
three special steps and you'll succeed
okay it's Friday night P tonight we went
with chicken topping and green pepper
I'm going to sandwich my two together to
make one because I like the flavors
together and I was wondering if you do
anything weird with your pizza some
people eat pizza weirdly either with
dipping or folding or different things
so let us know if you're one of those
weirdos and what you do so Kendra just
came and put a whole bunch of perimeter
and cheese on her pizza do you guys how
about you guys Parmesan cheese do you
add it onto your pizza or any other
add-ons I don't really like the texture
of Parmesan cheese I feel like I really
like the cheese on pizza and I don't
like the powdery stuff on top of my
pizza so that's just me but I think I'm
in the minority we're talking about some
of our favorite parts of Legoland did
you sit and watch a movie yeah what was
the movie right it was scary
did you wear glasses yeah you did hey
Malia was there snow yes man is good boy
oh yeah it was so silly
okay so we're cleaning up for Caleb's
birthday party tomorrow it's a superhero
party there's going to be obstacle
courses and a villain
