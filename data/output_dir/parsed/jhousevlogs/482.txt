So guys, guess what.
We have had four beautiful
babies in our family
and we are going to have another baby.
- Another one!
(gasps)
- We are having a new baby.
(gasps)
- It doesn't look like you're
gonna have another baby.
- I know, it's 'cause
the baby's really little,
it has to grow, but
there's a baby in my tummy.
- Oh, are you pregnant?
- I am, I'm pregnant.
- Laura, you're gonna have a little baby.
(gasps)
- I hope it's a sister,
I hope it's a sister.
- That is not a surprise.
- Oh, it's not a surprise?
- Your tummy's a little bigger.
- Thanks.
- I wanna feel the baby laugh.
- You can't feel the baby yet.
Do you know how little the baby is?
- Like probably that big?
- This big!
- I can show you guys how big
it is, do you guys wanna see?
- Yeah!
- Do you guys see this
little tiny poppy seed?
- Yeah.
- That's how big our baby is right now.
- What?
- Can I get it?
- Yeah.
- If it's a she, I'll call it a she.
- Good plan.
- But how is it so small?
- Because it starts so small
and then it gets bigger
and bigger and then we
will go to the hospital
and get the baby, and
we'll bring the baby home.
- Where's the baby go?
- I think she thinks the
poppy seed is a baby.
- Did we lose the poppy seed?
(laughs)
- Laura, the baby's inside my tummy.
- There's a baby in mine.
- There's a baby in your tummy?
- Oh.
- You wanna feel it?
- Oh sure, you have a
little baby in there?
(laughs)
- No, can you feel it in here?
- I feel it right here.
(laughs)
- Tummy.
- Is that your tummy?
- Does anyone else know yet?
- No, do you guys wanna tell people?
- Yeah!
- For sure!
- For sure, do you guys
wanna call and tell somebody?
- Yeah I wanna tell
everyone in our family.
