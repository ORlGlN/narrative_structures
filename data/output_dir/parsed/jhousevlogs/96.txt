-  I weigh 189 pounds.
- That's a lot, that could break a house.
(uptempo dance music)
(yelling)
- Look at her.
-  She's lovin' it.
Come back.
(laughing)
Oh wrong end.
(uptempo music)
(gentle music)
- Well I'm spending some time alone out
on the lake this morning,
and it is beautiful, just breathtaking.
I'm loving this chance to
just think and daydream
and kind of clear my head for a minute.
There's something about
being out in nature
that is profound, even if it's cold out
and I'm really wishing I had gloves,
because my hands are going numb.
And I just came across
a house that's for sale,
right up against the lake.
Check out this beautifulness.
What do you think?
I think that's beautiful.
- Alright, hop on in bud.
-  Isaac's becoming a pro.
- Be gone.
(water lapping)
(lively music)
Rowing speed.
- Well the sun is out today,
but it is colder and windier.
-  We haven't seen the
sun on the water very much.
Laura's going out (laughs).
Laura look, you're doing it.
- She really wanted to go,
and now she's a little nervous.
(playful music)
(laughing)
-  I weight 189 pounds.
- That's a lot, that could break a house.
- Yeah, it could probably break a house.
That's the response.
I'm trying to lose some okay?
(jazzy music)
Laura, we're at the swimming pool.
Come on.
- So while Jeremy and
the guys have the kids
at the pool, we are taking care
of the little girls,
who are mostly napping,
which means that we're having girl time.
We are watching a movie
and eating some cookies
and just hanging out and
laughing and chatting.
It's awesome.
(lively music)
(Janae cooing)
Hi.
Hi.
(Janae cooing)
Hi.
(bright music)
- Well I've always wanted to try this.
And they have it here.
We had no idea.
Everyone's watching.
(water gushing)
♪ Lift off ♪
Whoa.
(funky beat music)
(laughing)
(laughing)
So I just tried the wave rider thing,
and Isaac and Elise want to try it.
- I'm excited.
-  Elise, are you nervous at all?
- Um kinda.
(gentle music)
- I'm like just at the height
to be able to stand up and do it.
(water gushing)
-  Try to get on your knees.
Yeah!
- Yeah!
-  Good job bud, oh!
(Jeremy laughing)
You got it Elise.
Good job!
You're doing awesome!
(Jeremy laughs)
(uptempo music)
(splashing)
(water gushing)
That is so much fun.
We got the ping-pong table set up.
(girls screaming)
(uptempo drumming music)
- Ah.
- Ah.
- Hi.
- Ah.
-  Hi.
- Gimme five.
(punch)
Yeah.
-  She did it, she gave it.
-  She was going for it.
- So Michael has some sweet cameras.
And he's doing an impromptu photo shoot
that everyone requested.
- Totally planned this out,
scouted the location.
(playful music)
- Get together, look together.
-  Okay everyone look at me
and think about
marshmallows and ice cream.
(yelling)
- Woo!
(gentle music)
But we need Melanie.
-  They're getting
a picture of the family.
-  Okay one two three.
- Wait.
- My smile's messed up.
- Get your face in.
One two three.
- Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey.
- Well we made dinner,
which is a special leftover
Thanksgiving dinner casserole,
that I absolutely love,
and now my mom is whipping up
some brown sugar cookie dough,
so we can roll out sugar
cookies with the kids.
- And we have matching
pajamas coming soon.
- Yes, so we're very excited,
there's Christmas PJs on the way.
The turkey's on the bottom.
(bright music)
It's so yummy Caleb, I love this meal.
It's called Thanksgiving
leftover casserole.
Here it is.
So it's got stuffing,
gravy, mashed potatoes,
turkey, all together.
- So Mugga has a surprise
for all the grandkids.
- We don't very often get to be together
at the holidays, okay?
And so Grandma decided to
do something really silly.
("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy")
- What is that?
Stand up.
(Elise gasps)
- Matching footy pajamas.
-  Yep.
- Are we going to Christmas together?
(laughing)
- And all the other big kids are gonna
be wearing these.
-  This is awesome.
- So you guys are gonna get to,
I'll give you the one that's for you,
and then you need to go and put 'em on
and we're gonna have a picture.
(enchanting music)
-  What did you get?
What is it?
(gasps)
Those are so cute.
Are those Christmas jammies?
-  Go put 'em on.
What do you think?
- I like it.
-  Look, you and Lily match.
Look guys.
- This is amazing!
- Caleb and Isaac, can you
-  Well Lily's
coming in too somewhere.
- Sarah, so
- Ya'll gotta squish in.
Oh my goodness.
- Okay, start taking pictures.
-  Mommy!
(baby crying)
- It's part of the luster, guys.
-  Can everybody look
at me and do a silly face?
-  Silly face!
- Got it.
So our family's never
done the whole Christmas
matching pajamas thing,
but I saw a video a few years ago
by the Holderness family,
it's called Christmas Pajamas.
It's on YouTube.
- Are those Christmas jammies?
(dance music)
- They are Christmas jammies.
- It's hilarious.
- We had the chance the
Holderness family at CVX Live,
and they're really nice.
- So I'm gonna show them all this video.
-  Grab those
jammies on the back.
(choo chooing)
(laughing)
-  Nae Nae's going.
She's lovin' it.
-  Nae Nae's in.

-  Uh-oh.
Come back.
Hey, one in.
- Emma, get in there.
(laughing)
Christmas jammies for the win.
