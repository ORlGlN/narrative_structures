so Caleb just came and told me mom it's
so clean in my room so I'm falling in to
see Oh joking
Caleb I am so proud of you high-five it
dude
so he's had a little bit of a rough
morning and he was in timeout and I told
him he needed to clean up his books
while he was in timeout in his room and
I didn't like even shut the door I just
told him he had to clean up his books
and his books were everywhere and the
Legos were everywhere look look how much
I pay to clean up his room
whoa and look how nicely he cleaned that
up I mean I wish I had a before picture
I mean this place was a disaster how old
are you dude so we are in the car and on
our way again guys where are we going
you got some bizarre feet to the farm
with our friends with some friends we
are going out to a working farm and
we'll see what it's like we've never
been before look how pretty this is
and telling you Missouri is gorgeous I
mean if the whole green lush rolling
hills things works for you
what animal are you excited to see and
which one where the sound you were just
making hair you want to see yeah who
makes that sound Burger air but what
animal makes that down what are you guys
doing down there you're picking tomatoes
to get did you pick up you go find one
Caleb
Isaac what do you think of the farm
almost kind of Maccabee as a hip but
really I like the chickens it does smell
kind of yucky true story
so getting around and cleaning the
kitchen it's probably been like seven
minutes and we haven't heard the
children so we know they're up to
something so Kim is okay you'll figure
it out we know what that one's doing
she's hanging out with that so we
decided to grab the camera and go see
what's up please ignore her messy house
they locked the door
um I'm glad it's dark in here because
Caleb just pulled my pants off
