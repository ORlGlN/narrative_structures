- Need to be strong.
- I just want the floor to
be safe for me to explore
and I spit up.
That's all.
(kids giggling)
-  Good job.
- I don't wanna work hard.
-  You don't
wanna work hard, why not?
- Because I'm a little girl.
-  You're a little girl.
- Yeah.
- I think you can work hard.
We're gonna teach you
how to work hard, okay?
So this morning some of our kids
were complaining about doing chores
or some of the things we ask them to do.
And I had recently watched
a motivational video
talking about what leads to success.
And they were saying that it
takes discipline and hard work.
Doing the things that you may
not love to do consistently
is what can make you great.
And so I think sometimes as
kids it's hard to understand
how practicing the piano
or doing daily chores
is gonna make a difference.
But it does.
Having that attitude
of being able to do things you don't love
makes all the difference in the world
to some day be your best self.
(kids laughing)
She likes it.
(Janae babbles)
There she goes.
-  What is this?
-  I want to eat it.
You gonna try to lead her to your bedroom?
- Yeah.
(Janae babbles)
-  She's coming.
(upbeat music)
Thanks for helping you guys.
(Laura exclaims)
- More vegetables.
We have too many vegetables.
-  Mom does like vegetables.
-  That's not good.
-  It's really good.
That means we get to eat healthy.
- Yeah.
- And that's what we need to be strong.
-  Are you feeling hungry?
- Yeah,
I want a banana.
-  You want to eat one?
- That's why I wanted it open.
-  You want it
open so you can eat it?
- Yeah.
- So one of our kids' favorite snacks
is bananas with sprinkles.
They have requested it.
And that sounds like fun.
(bright music)
Banana and sprinkles.
I made yours into a smiley face.
- Umm.
- You made mine into a football.
- I'm so proud of Elise.
She has just discovered that she can read
the verses in the Bible,
the King James version.
Listen to this.
- Let your light so shine before men
that they may see your good
works and glorify your father
which is in heaven.
-  Good job big girl.
- I'm so proud of you.
-  You're reading so well.
-  So the boys have
set up a sports station.
(dramatic music)
- I'm gonna teach him
about all the stisticks.
-  That's a hard word to say.
- Statistics.
And then.
- Statistics.
- And then RDFs.
- Staticsticks.
-  Statistics.
- I'm having him write down
what the abbreviation is
and dash, and then write
down what it means.
But like for a completion percentage,
I just had him write down catch rate,
like just how often people catch it.
- I am not a sports person, really.
I probably can't name a
single player of anything.
And so I don't really understand
Isaac's passion for it.
But I love that he's
passionate about something.
And I love that he digs deep into it.
And that's cool and I
wanna learn more about it
so I can support him in that.
It's interesting with kids.
Sometimes they get into stuff
that you don't really know much about
or maybe care a lot about.
But that's a great opportunity
for me to show my love
and dig deeper into it.
So something I always want
to remember about baby Janae
is that she has this one long hair.
-  The Alfalfa hair.
- And it looks like this
little tiny ponytail.
And sometimes it sticks up
and sometimes it sticks out more
and sometimes it blends in.
But she's gonna grow up and
she's gonna have even hair.
And I'm gonna forget
that when she was little,
she had this one long hair.
It's been there since
she was a brand new baby.
-  Her comb over.
- It's nap time.
I'm gonna go put her down.
You look nice.
- Thanks.
-  Did you do your hair?
- Yeah, it's made out of a lot of bows
and me and Elise wanted to do a bow party.
-  Oh, so you put
some bows in your hair.
Well they look really nice.
- How is it so hard?
-  They're frozen rolls.
We're gonna bake 'em.
- But why are they hard
when they're frozen?
-  'Cause that's
what frozen things are,
they're hard.
So dinner tonight is the
meal that Laura and I made
at freezer club last week.
And it is delicious.
It's the chicken pesto casserole.
With our favorite salad and frozen rolls.
-  Did you make this?
- Yep.
-  Good job ma'am.
- Me and Mommy did.
-  Was it easy or hard to make it?
- Hard.
-  Yeah, well you did a good job.
-  Ooo, you didn't
get a big enough bite.
-  (snickers) Daddy's joking.
Hi, did you want some food?
You guys notice that Janae
is moving around a lot more?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she's really starting to crawl.
Hey, have you guys also noticed
when Janae gets stuff,
does she like to touch it?
- Yeah.
- And then what does she do with it?
- Put it in her mouth.
- She puts it straight in her mouth.
That's how babies discover and learn
and explore about things,
but it can also be dangerous.
So it's really important,
it's all of our jobs
to keep our house safe for Janae.
So I went around the house
and I picked up things
that were on the floor.
So we're gonna take turns
grabbing something outta here
and saying why it is or is not safe.
Alright Laura, grab something out.
So what is that Ms. Laura?
- Scissors.
-  Are those safe for babies?
No, so where do we need to keep scissors?
- In the pencil drawer.
- In the drawer.
Next up, Isaac.
That is a wet diaper.
- I didn't know that.
- Why is that safe or not safe?
- Because it has germs.
And she could bite on it and
get bad things in her mouth.
- Would you like to suck on this?
- No!
(kids laughing)
- Why can't she play with this?
- Because it might have
germs on it from blood.
- Yeah, that's disgusting.
They are dirty socks.
Ms. Laura, show us yours.
- It could get germs on
her and make her choke.
- Do you wanna suck on that?
Dude, that would cut you.
Metal things with sharp edges
should definitely be away from our baby.
She loves the sound of plastic.
Why can't she play with this.
- Because she can breathe inside it
and she won't be able to breathe.
- Suffocate.
It's called suffocation and
we don't like suffocation.
How about this one?
-  She can.
- This is one of her toys.
And they make baby toys safe.
Do you see, does this
have any sharp edges?
-  No.
-  Does anything come off?
Does the head pop off?
- Nope.
So this is a toy that she can play with.
There you go Janae.
All of us have shoes all over the house.
Can Janae suck on our shoes?
- No, there's a ton of
germs from the ground
and other people's.
- And if you're at public places
at those bathrooms, and lick 'em.
- Yeah, that would be disgusting.
What I need is a bunch
of safety inspectors
who are on my team
to help make sure at all times
that our floor is safe for our baby.
- I just want the floor to
be safe for me to explore
and I spit up.
That's all.
(kids laughing)
-  Goodnight.
J House out.
(Laura laughs)
(bright music)
(kids laughing)
- She got the biggest one.
-  Good job Isaac.
- J House store, right here.
Come to the J House store, it's
the best store in the world!
