Will we be having another baby?

J House Vlogs for you.
And then once I'm finished J House Vlogs,
I'm gonna pass it over to Elise and
then she can keep on going.
- A singer, a dancer, an actor.
- Pass it to Laura.
- A dress upper and makeup person.
- And then while that's
happening I'll be getting fat.
(laughing)
(baby talk)
- I wanna play the NFL
and I know it has a small
chance of happening and if it doesn't,
I could be a lawyer, or
maybe even a Youtuber,
And just like do J House
Vlogs and then it could
go down the generations.

it's just the longest time ago.

the story about back when
you were a little grandma?
- You know one time when
I was cooking macaroni
and cheese I burnt myself.

were a little grandma?
- Yeah.
-  How has Janae impacted your lives
since she was born?
- Well, she's cute, I
think she broke the record
of most cutest person ever.
- I think life is more
happier with a baby.
- She just makes us happy
and she makes fun sounds
and I like watching her learn.
-  What's it like being a big sister?
- I like it but I used to be two.
-  And now what are you?
Three, awesome.
She brings us so much happiness
she's so fun and adorable
and reactive and smart.
If you could repaint your room,
what color would you choose?
- Red for chiefs.
- Rainbow.
- Light blue because
it's my favorite color.
Or with like little swirls on it
or hearts or flowers or something.
(baby talk)
-  If you could
repaint your room any color
what color would you choose?
- Pink.
-  That was tough.
- What is my favorite chore.
I actually think I kinda like chores,
that's probably weird.
I hate wiping off the
counters and sweeping.
I really hate that one.
But you didn't ask what I hated,
you asked what I loved.
I like doing the dishes, mostly because
I like how I feel when
the kitchen's clean.
I also really like
vacuuming and making my bed.
Definitely that's my favorite.
- I would say, folding laundry.
- We basically don't like chores,
I think my favorite one is cleaning
the bathroom cause for some reason
I like cleaning the toilet and the sink.
It's weird.
- I don't like chores.
-  Are there any of them you like?
- I like putting on clothes.
Clothes chores.
-  That's a good chore.
- I don't like any of them
I would choose an easy one
so that would be starting a
load of laundry or practice
basketball for 20 minutes.
-  Is that a chore,
practice basketball?
- Yeah.
- I've actually really
started liking washing
the dishes, but only if I'm blaring some
of my favorite music at the same time.
That's fun.
Janae, Janae, who do you
like better Mom or Dad?
(baby talk)
-  If we could have a pet
what would you want as a pet?
- What's the fastest animal?
-  American Falcon.
- Yeah I would have him.
So I can and it's big so I be on it's back
and it would fly.
Or I would have a cheetah.
-  Why do you want a cheetah?
- So then it can teach me how to run fast.
- A puppy.
You can teach him tricks
and you can train 'em.
But I would also like a
bigger dog that's trained.
Our dog would basically protect us.
(baby talk)
(laughing)
- I wanna a dog.
-  What kind of dog?

That is named Sally.

Green.
- Pink.
- Red and blue.
- Blue.
- Light blue.
(baby talk)
- I like teal.
-  What's your favorite holiday?
- Christmas.
- I like Halloween.
But Christmas is good too.
- To be honest I really like
Thanksgiving and Christmas.
- Christmas.
- Christmas.
- My favorite holiday is Thanksgiving.
I really love the pretty
Fall weather, I love
the good food, the
family time, it's kind of
a low key holiday with
not a lot of expectations
which means it's lower stress for me.
I also though really love
the Christmas season.
I feel like the magic is
in all the weeks ahead
of time when you're baking the cookies,
and reading the stories, and snuggling
up to Christmas music, so I love Christmas
season but Thanksgiving
is probably my favorite
actual holiday.
-  Madeline asked
how long do you think
you'll continue to vlog?
- Until we feel done.
-  When do you think we'll feel done.
- Maybe in like 20 years, I don't know.
- I think maybe two years.
- I think when I'm like married.
I want if I'm like a grandma,
I want to remember what job I had.
- You know there's time when I think about
how fun it would be if
the Vlog could continue on
for generations like
after we're done vlogging
with our family it goes
on and we did like a day
each day with one of
the kids, and so through
a week you saw what was
going on in their lives
and our grandkids were
able to be a part of it.
But who knows, I mean, I think
it's to the point where it's
something that we aren't enjoying anymore,
or it's something that we
feel like we should stop
because that's what's best for our family,
we could stop tomorrow, so it's really an
unpredictable thing.
-  What do you like about Isaac?
- He's really encouraging and I really
like having a big brother.

playing pretend a lot.

What do you like most about Isaac?

-  What do you like most about Isaac?
- He's pretty nice.
Caleb is actually a little bit mean to me.
-  What do you like most about Elise?
- Elise is a little bit nice.
-  What do you like most about Janae?
- Like Janae is a lot more nice.
-  She's the nicest.
It helps when they can't talk.
What do you like the most about Elise?
- She's fun to play with and she is older
so she understands me more.
-  What do you like most about Caleb?
- He's my only brother.
And we can play sports together.
-  What do you like most about Laura?
- She's cute.

(laughing)
(baby talk)
- Andrew McVie asked an
important question he said,
do you guys do stuff so you
can film it for the vlogs?
- The short answer is no.
We try really hard to
think about what is best
for our family, what is
it that we're wanting to
teach our children this
week, what experiences
do we want to have with
them, to try to raise
them to be good human beings.
- And the vlog is a secondary
consideration instead
of the primary motive
for what we're doing.
- And so that's how we
choose what we're gonna film.
We obviously film challenges
and things like this Q&A.
Just for the vlog.
Cause they're fun.
- LeeAnn Marie asked do you
ever feel silly or awkward
while vlogging yourself in public?
I am an extrovert so this
isn't super hard for me.
When you know that there's a lot of people
watching you in the camera.
I get that there's maybe 30 or 40 people
here at the restaurant but I'm talking to
a lot more people here on the camera.
- Yes, yes, I feel silly
and awkward vlogging
in public all the time.
I feel silly and awkward vlogging in my
own house it's worse when I'm around like
my family or friends like people who know
what I'm doing then I feeling the most
awkwardest which I don't know why that is.
Sometimes people look at you pretty funny
when you're done, some people know what
YouTube is and they're like is that for
YouTube like they get all excited.
And but I think the most common reaction
is did you want me to take your picture,
like they think we're
trying to take a selfie.
But we're not, I'm like,
so that's kind of awkward.
Cause I'm like oh thanks,
but no I'm just gonna
keep talking to my camera
cause that's what I do.
I feel awkward even
right now, I don't know
what it is about me and
camera's I'm just not super
comfortable with them I guess.
Which is funny because we've been flogging
for three years now so I can say this,
it has gotten a lot a
lot easier, and it's much
easier to film the kids in public doing
something than to film myself.
Cause that's kind of
normal, everybody films
their kids, so I think
people are just like
ah wow that mom's really excited about all
the stuff her kids do.
It's when I turn it around and talk to it
myself that that's awkward.
-  This question
is from Jane Hubbard,
will you be having another baby?
- I don't know.
- Honestly after our last two babies I was
feeling done but then over time and with
prayer I opened my heart and we made the
decision to have another
baby and I've been
really happy with that and so
when we had Janae I
thought I was done, but
who knows what's gonna happen.
- Alright the big
question, will we be having
another baby?
I wish that I knew the
answer, I really do.
I wish that I knew
whether our family ends up
having any more kids or
not but I don't honestly
know right now, Jeremy
and I felt really lead
to have Janae and we
were both really nervous
about having a fifth
kid, five kids is a lot
to take care of and so
we were overwhelmed,
but it has worked out to
be nothing but a blessing.
That Janae is an absolute
joy and privilege
to have in our home, we
are so blessed to have her.
We just love her so much
and so while we thought
she was going to be our
last there's definitely
been some moments where
Jeremy and I are looking
at each other going, should
we have another baby.
So I think we're both
open to it but we're both
very aware and want to
be careful and do what's
right for our whole family.
So whatever decision
we make will be a very
prayerful decision we
definitely felt inspired
and lead to have Janae
and I feel like that's
been a huge blessing in our lives, and
so we'll see.
It's sad to me to think about being done
having babies I really really love being
a mom and I love having babies and so
to think that chapter
of my life is closing,
is very sad to me.
So if I had the privilege
of having another
child I would welcome that with open arms.
But I also feel a lot of peace with where
we're at with our five, so I don't know.
- J House Out.
- Good night J House.
