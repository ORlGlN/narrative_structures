to give to little babies.
- Thank you!
- Big present.
- Yeah!
-  Guess what Isaac?
- What?
("Jingle Bells")
- So the craziest thing
has happened this morning.
None of our big kids have woken up yet.
It's past seven o'clock
and Janae is the one that
woke up Jeremy and I.
We are just stunned.
They're sleeping.
How is that happening
that on Christmas morning,
our kids are sleeping in.
They're usually really early risers.
(Janae babbles)
Can you say hi?
Hi.
- Gave us presents.
-  Let's go see 'em.
- 'Kay.
-  Janae has never
seen a present before.
She's like, what's this.
Can I eat it.
- Boys, time to wake up.
It's Christmas Eve.
-  No, it's Christmas.
- No, it's Christmas morning.
- Yeah. (giggles)
- Wake up boys, it's Christmas morning!
We heard Santa.
He needed to go poo.
(laughing)
(playful music)
Or did you need to go poo?
-  That wasn't Santa.
That was me!
- Oh!
-  I thought it was Santa.
- So this morning at like
seven a.m. I came out
and went to the bathroom.
In the kids bathroom out heer.
Apparently they thought it was Santa.
Going poo.
(Kendra laughs)
It was me.
Why did you take me away
from all those presents?
- Boys, I can't believe you
guys are the sleepy heads.
- This is the moment
I've been waiting for,
'cause then we get to open our stockings.
♪ Come all ye faithful ♪
♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪
♪ Oh come ye oh come ye to Beth ♪
So our family tradition
is that when we wake up
on Christmas morning,
we watch a video about
our Savior, Jesus Christ.
Then we sing songs, we pray together
and then we go into the stockings.
Here's the set up.
