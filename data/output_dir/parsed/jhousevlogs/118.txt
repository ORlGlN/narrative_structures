- So in Arizona apparently
they rake rocks.
And where I come from we rake leaves.
(upbeat music)
Well Papa is home from the hospital
and he's all showered up and looking
like himself again, you playing with papa?
(girls laughing)
-  (mumbles) for bed.
(upbeat music)
What are you grateful for?
- I'm grateful for, Papa.
-  That's a good one.
- I'm grateful for that Papa,
is safe and that he's out of the hospital.
- I'm grateful for Janaenae.
- I'm grateful for family and that
we can get to be together, you know,
that we can have close
relationships with them.
- I'm so grateful for all of you
who have donated to our upcoming
service celebration and
that means so much to us.
We have the goal of raising $18,000.
For all these (mumbles) kids.
And we just so appreciate all of you
who are participating, thank you.
-  Good morning, Jenae
and I have been playing
peek-a-boo in my bed this
morning, who's there?
(Baby coos)
- So because of the time change
between where we live in Kansas City
and here in Arizona Jenae's
been waking up early.
So she and I get to spend the first
hour or so of the day,
just hanging out together.
Yeah, so it's fun to see her playing
with toys I played with growing up.
She's been learning how to
clap since we've been here.
I haven't been able to catch
it on camera yet though.
Okay, definitely got to lick all the toys.
Check them out, I can tell
she misses the kids a lot.
We headed out on a walk?
Well my dad's home from the hospital
and he is healing up
and doing really well.
He's adjusting to his medications
and still resting a
lot, he's really tired.
And there's still a lot of
unknowns about what's ahead.
We found out that there's some
more blockages in his heart that
we're gonna have to deal with.
With further surgeries
and the recovery period.
And risks that are ahead so, there's
still a lot of unknowns and so
I think we're all dealing
with that emotionally.
But physically he's
recovering really well.
Oh you clapping your hands?
It's funny how different it is
to go on a walk in different
parts of the country.
Here I'm seeing cactuses and palm trees
and at home, that's not
so much what we see.
(upbeat music)
So I hear from Jeremy that it's
pretty cold in Kansas City right now.
But it is not cold here, it is gorgeous.
You blowing bubbles?
(fast music)
- So the kids really like this restaurant
they have trains that
actually deliver the food.
- Can we eat in the train?
-  Come sit down you guys.
So this place is cool, when you order,
you actually order on the phone.
You call and make an
order, there it comes.
You got it.
Whoa, it's our food.
- Yeah we have a ton of fries.
- So I got a cheeseburger
that has hash browns on it.
It's gotta be a good combination.
-  So today is this
girl's eight month birthday.
My parents have a stash of water bottles.
And we all know that Jenae likes
water bottles 'cause they crinkle.
But they even have the lids, she's
in like heaven over here exploring.
Well Papa is home from the hospital.
And he's all showered up and
looking like himself again.
- I'm feeling really good, I.
I'm a little bit surprised
at how good I feel.
And I felt like I bounced back right away.
- What's funny is, in the ICU
he was up like walking, like pretty
much the next day after his surgeries.
He's up walking the halls, they're like
you just had a heart attack, but
Papa's hard to keep laying low.
So what we've also been doing
is reading up about what in
the world happened to him.
He had some plague build
up in his arteries.
And they came in and put in a stint.
- That's an actual stint, I got three.
-  You got three, and we've also
been learning all about new medicines.
He gets to like have a pill bottle
and figure out what to take when.
- Yeah, it's like an
old fashioned computer.
With a lot of different
things that move around.
- It is, it is, what's interesting
is with several of these medicines
he has to take his blood
pressure beforehand.
And so he's been taking his blood pressure
and kind of charting that so I feel
like we're kind of figuring out how
to adjust to all of this right now.
So dad's decided to become an expert.
He's gonna learn all about
the heart, and everything
that's going on, ooh that
one doesn't look good.
-  Yeah that's the bad one.
-  That's the bad one, this is
what you want, this is
what you don't want.
(baby cooing)
You tell it to me, oh you're clapping.
You playing with Papa.
-  Yes, hello.
-  Alright, Maga is making her
homemade spaghetti sauce.
- And we're making it low
sodium so we have to adjust.
- With my dad, he's recovering
really well, we did find out that
he has more blockages in his heart
and he's gonna need future procedures.
And they've put him on a special
low-sodium diet and so we've been
going through the cupboards and we've
been amazed at how much
sodium is in somethings.
And what it's in and we kinda went
through and we were adding up
like what his normal day would look like.
(peppy music)
So I'm in charge of chopping the onions
and it's not doing to bad on my eyes
yet but I keep wanting to like
rub my nose or something and I'm
nervous about getting all the onion
greases near my eyes 'cause
then I'll start sobbing.
(upbeat music)
Here's the spaghetti sauce,
doesn't that look amazing.
So, it looks like over the next
several months there's gonna be
a lot going on in our family but
I'm just really impressed with my dad's
attitude about it all and I
just really love that man.
I would love it, if in our vlog today
we could flood the comments with some
love for Papa, please share what
you love about Papa if you've been
watching our vlogs for very long
you know that he's a
very hands on grandpa.
He's always out running and playing
with the kids and he's been that way
my whole life, that's what
I remember as a child.
And so, he's just an amazing man.
My whole life that I've known him
he's been so, kind and loving
to others, he's always serving
and so disciplined and obedient
and faithful, I just and I could
talk forever about my dad
and how much I love him.
Except my arm is getting sore
holding this camera, see
this arm, totally sore.
(upbeat music)
So my parents have had some plants
in their front yard die recently
and so they've been wanting to dig
them up and replant some fresh plants
and kind of clean up
some of the rock work.
So my sister's family is over
here helping them with
that project right now.
Raking rocks, that's an Arizona
thing, we don't do that where I live.
I know it's hard for my dad not
to be actively doing this work.
But he's always the one helping all of us
and so to be able to see us turn
around and help him,
it's really kinda tender.
This thing is being stubborn.
They're getting the holes ready
to come plant plants another day.
This thing was way in there.
- Oh, Jake got it.
-  Jenae's having fun
playing with her cousins.
Thank you guys for hanging out with her.
- Are, are you gonna open?
(Mom laughing)
-  Here's our yummy dinner.
We are having the best dessert tonight.
This is the best cake ever, it's
four different kinds of cake in one cake.
So we have chocolate, we have pumpkin,
we have caramel and we have carrot.
Which one are you guys gonna go for?
Papa which one do you like?
- According to the sodium content.
-  Uhoh.
- I can have anything but the carrot cake.
-  My guess is he
kinda wants chocolate.
-  Yeah I'm sort of a chocolate guy.
- My vote is that we cut each piece
into eight different pieces and we have
like a sampler platter
and we eat all the cake.
-  So what're you reading?
- Wonder.
-  Can I see the cover of it?
How're you liking it?
- I'm liking it.
-  What do you like about it?
- I like that it's just
about a normal life.
-  Yeah.
- And that, everyone has problems, so.
- So Kendra encouraged me
to read Wonder as well.
I'm about to finish it, I'll
probably finish it tonight.
And I don't normally read
these types of books.
And I have loved it, it's
very thought provoking.
Makes you appreciate
things, makes you think
about other people's feelings.
What they're thinking
about and going through.
And wanting to give love to
people who have a hard time.
I mean some people are born with things
that they can't control and they get
judged or treated poorly because of it.
And it makes you wanna
give extra love to them.
And so I have loved the book and I'm
excited to take Isaac to the movie.
- Yeah.
-  And to talk to
you more about it so.
(girls laughing)
You girls are goofing off,
you need to calm down for bed.
- We were going to put stickers
on your Spider-Man shirt.
-  Oh yeah, they
put stickers on my back.
- I did not.
-  Well I love you girls.
I hope you sleep well tonight.
- I'll be scared, is it gonna
be a storm in the nighttime?
-  No storm, no
chance of rain tonight.
- Goodnight, J House out.
-  What does it smell like Laura?
- Poop.
-  Poop, poop, get that sock.
(kids laughing)
Here we go, one, two, three.
(kids laughing)
