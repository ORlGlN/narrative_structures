("Deck the Halls")
- Okay, we're gonna try out
this magnetic blocks toy.
-  Ooh.
-  Wow.
-  Good job.
You could put it on top of Mom's blocks.
You would have a house.
Look, you built a house!
-  Somebody's discovering magnets.
-  Awesome.
You could lay it right up there,
and then do another one on the other...
- I know, you're super impressed.
- Good thing I can make another one.
-  Good thing.
Good attitude there, sissy.
Cubby, this is such a cool house!
- Can you hold this one for us?
-  So, they're working
together to build a fort.
- Here, Dad.
- Perfect!
That'll be the blanket we
put on top of it, okay?
Um, we want that connected.
Yeah, that would be great,
that would give it some stability.
-  So, this is the
toy they're playing with.
It is a Build and Play Construction Fort.
- Hey, are you guys ready
to put the sheet on top?
-  It's like a
doggy door in the back.
- Yep, it's the back door.
-  All of it covered
up except for the big ones.
-  Okay, we'll open up the door.
Did we build a fort?
- Yeah!
- Isaac, what are you doing?
You bringing your pillows in?
So, doing a nice Christmas
dinner is an important
part of Kendra's Christmas tradition.
- It is.
And we're doing it!
We're sitting down to a nice dinner.
And we're all gonna behave super nicely.
-  And we're not gonna spill
any of the yummy drink everywhere.
- Alright?
- We'll see how it goes.
- Wish us luck.
Alright, in my family
we always did cheers.
Are you ready?
- I don't see this going well.
- So, how you do cheers
is you touch your cups gently together.
Let me show you, watch.
Oh, so gently, watch.
Okay?
- His bottom fell off.
- Well, not his bottom.
(giggling)
Okay, ready?
-  Elise, do you wanna
touch yours against mine,
really gently?
- To family and Christmas.
-  Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
(giggling)
You have to be so soft
when you do it, Caleb.
- Why?
- So that your thing doesn't spill.
-  Dad, cheers.
-  So soft, bud.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Caleb, cheers!
-  Cheers.
-  Cheers.
- This will be a lot easier in 10 years.
- Jeremy?
- Yeah?
- Every meal I ever sat
down to with my grandparents
they would do the toast,
and then my grandpa, he
always sat at the end,
he would walk all the way around the table
to where my grandma was
and cheers her glass
and kiss her.
-  Aw, how sweet.
- Every meal.
- Don't open 'em yet.
This one is to Daddy.
-  Thanks, man!
- Lisey.
- Mommy.
- It's a ball!
-  No no no, you don't
wanna tell her the present.
- It's okay, look!
Oh, it's a ball!
Laura, can you say thank you?
- Thank you!
- (babbles)
-  (laughs) That
almost sounded like thank you!
Thank you, Caleb!
- Laura, give Caleb hugs!
Say thank you.
- Okay Ike, it's your turn.
- Wow!
I love this!
-  Caleb, did
you give that to him?
- What does this do with it?
- It has a motorcycle!
- I know!
-  What do you say, Isaac?
- Thank you!
- It's salad tongs!
I love them, thank you!
Caleb, thank you.
Oh, they're red.
- That's my favorite color.
- That's so fun.
- Wow!
-  What is it?
- Cars.
-  Three race cars.
-  Awesome!
- I got a purple one
so both of us could
play with them together.
-  And the orange
one could be for me.
- Yeah!
-  Whoa!
- And the green one can be for me.
- Yeah, that's why I got three.
-  That's awesome!
Caleb, can you say thank you to Lisey?
- Thank you.
- Squeeze!
- A football!
Oh, I love you.
Thank you.
- Two cars, again!
- You have so many cars!
You have a bunch of
different colored cars.
Look, now you have yellow
and red, your favorite color!
Say thank you, Isaac.
- Isaac, thank you.
- I got some cars.
- Show me!
-  Did they
get you the same thing?
That is fun.
Alright, let's see it, Miss Magoo.
- Whoa!
- Wanna tell you what it is?
- What?
- It's a Sophia The First whistle.
- Whoa!
-  That's so thoughtful.
Lisey, what do you say?
- Thank you!
-  I'm confused,
that's like such a weird shape.
- I know.
- It's not too heavy.
What could it be?
It's a dustpan!
- There's nothing that could go with it,
so that's all I could get.
- That's okay.
Who doesn't need a dustpan?
-  Who doesn't
need an extra dustpan?
- And a blue one, though,
I really like blue.
- Wait a second!
You got me the same thing, I love it!
Now we can play catch
where I throw it to you
and then you throw it.
- And we don't know whose is whose.
- No, we both throw it back and forth,
let's try it real quick.
-  What?
-  Go! Go! Go!
- Jeremy's so happy.
He's always wanted a permanent
football-playing buddy.
- Whoa!
- Wowzers!
This is cool!
- It's fruit snacks!
Wow!
- Fruit snacks?
- Elise, you got Elsa and Ana!
- Well, I got Dora!
- Elsa and Ana fruit snacks?
Oh gee, thanks Missus Laura!
- And I got Super Mario!
-  Coolio.
-  Get your
thanks going on over here.
Oh, be soft, be soft!
-  Don't rip her head off
when you say thanks to her.
Isaac, do you wanna say
thanks to Miss Laura?
- Thank you!
-  Can we eat some today?
- So, initially, I thought
that the Let it Go microphone
that sang Let it Go over
and over again was annoying.
It's nothing compared to the whistle.
(whistling)
It's been 20 minutes,
non-stop, whistle-blowing.
-  I got that for Elise.
She said it was her
favorite present from me.
- I'm just glad it makes
such a pretty noise.
What are you doing over here?
- I'm not snitchin' nothin'.
-  Mom doing, Lisey?
- Curling my hair with curlers.
-  Ooh, it's gonna
be so pretty tomorrow.
- Just like Granny Jo has.
-  Yep.
-  ♫ Oh come all ye faithful
♫ Joyful and triumphant
♫ Oh come ye oh come ye
♫ To Bethlehem
♫ Come and behold Him
♫ Born the king of angels
♫ Oh come let us adore Him
♫ Oh come let us adore Him
♫ Oh come let us adore Him
♫ Christ the Lord
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
- Wowzers!
- Wow!
- I love it!
