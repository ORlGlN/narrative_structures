Remix)" by DJoNemesis & Lilly)
- So after the bike ride we
picked up some Mexican food,
and we're heading home to devour it.
-  Hey Caleb, come here, buddy!
I just checked the mail,
and look what you got.
- Yay!
-  Who's it from?
- Luke.
-  Cousin Luke.
- The kids had some of there cousins
write them letters while they're here.
They have a really good breakfast burrito.
- This is so good, the California burrito.
-  Here's the
carne asada soft taco.
- So when I was researching
fun stuff to do in San Diego
before our trip, I knew
that San Diego had a zoo.
I mean, I think everybody
knows that San Diego had a zoo,
but I had no idea that they
also have a safari park.
And our family has never
been to a safari park,
so that's where we're headed today.
(playful bongo drumming)
- So when we went to the San Diego Zoo,
there was one animal that
Isaac really wanted to see
that we didn't see.
- A giraffe.
-  So we're hoping
today to make that right.
(lighthearted instrumental music)
-  There's the giraffe.
(lighthearted instrumental music)
- I kind of feel like we're
entering Jurassic Park.
(lighthearted instrumental music)
-  We found a log.
-  Is this a real log?
-  What do you think?
-  Yeah.
-  You think so?
Feels awful smooth and shiny to be real.
This place is beautiful.
(acoustic guitar music)
-  We're exploring
in the Tiger Trail.
(acoustic guitar music)
-  Do you guys see the tiger?
- I thought it was something in the water,
and why do they have
water? Can tigers swim?
-  Probably.
I'm sure he can jump high. There he is!
There's the tiger!
-  Hey! Hey!
- Back in the Tiger Trail
there's a really nice
shaded play area, and we're
crashing here for a few minutes.
-  Looking in there, Laura?
Climb up!
- There's people under!
-  There's people under?
That one's kinda slippery, buddy.
Hey (chuckles) do you like that area?
Teaching her how to climb?
- Yeah.
-  She's trying. She wants to.
This park is so well-shaded,
at least the tiger area was,
and I love that because I
hate being all hot and sweaty
at a park, I mean, a zoo.
So while we're here at the safari park,
the little kids and I are
doing a wildlife workshop
where we get to meet some of the animals.
- Geronimo is an armadillo.
So let me show you his back.
So see here, he's got
one, two, three bands.
And these bands back here,
they help him to roll into his ball.
And you know when he likes
to roll into his ball?
When he's scared of an
animal coming after him
that's gonna eat him, called a predator.
Geronimo, you're gonna be surprised
when I tell you how old he is.
He is 18 years old.
- Whoa.
-  He's
kind of an older armadillo.
- A little small.
Like a cat with a shell.
(armadillo instructor laughs)
-  He looks like
an armored rat, to me.
What do you think of that?
- So we, of course, wanna be
really soft and nice to him.
Good job!
-  What is that, Laura?
- Bug soup
-  This is bug soup.
- We're going on the safari.
-  Yep, the caravan safari.
Are you gonna take some pictures, too?
-  Yeah.
-  Do you wanna feed a giraffe?
(tribal drumming)
- I took a picture of a giraffe.
(tribal drumming)
- Can I feed it?
-  Yeah, you can feed it.
- Okay, so I'm not touching her,
but notice that the leaves,
she wants to come into the leaves,
but we don't feed her in here,
we feed her right here, okay?
I'm reinforcing positive behavior.
-  Hide
it from her, and then one leaf
at a time, as high as you can, reach up
like you're asking the teacher a question.
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Can you feel her tongue?
- Yeah.
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Perfect!
And see how well he did?
He did not feed her when
her head was inside.
(Jeremy and Isaac laugh)
- Okay, I don't have any more.
(crowd laughs)
-  Good job, buddy!
- It felt kind of sticky
but I really liked it.
-  Yeah, they said
their slime is like hair gel.
- Yeah.
-  So lift it up high.
Pick one out and lift it up high.
(Elise shrieks)
(crowd laughs)
-  So lift it up
high, just one at a time.
Hide the other ones.
(Elise shrieks)
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Oh, and then
hold the other one up high.
So hold it up high, high above your head.
You were very brave.
- He looks like a porcupine, huh?
What other guesses do you
guys think he might be?
-  So it's not a porcupine.
-  Not a
porcupine. He's kinda tricky.
He has a really funny name.
He's called an echidna.
-  Whoa!
- Can you guys say that?
- Echidna
-  Echidna, can you say it?
- "N-kih-nuh"
-  Echidna, how 'bout you?
Can you say "echidna"? No.
-  His name is Chinby,
and he likes bugs just like Geronimo.
-  Do you see
how long his tongue is?
-  How does he eat it?
-  He slips
it all up with his tongue.
Good job, guys! Not too bad, huh?
-  So gentle!
-  So he's
not related to porcupines.
We take really good care of
our animals at the safari park.
- He's a sleepy one right now.
-  Oh! Oh my goodness!
-  You're holding him like a baby!
-  Janae's so excited.
-  So
this is an anteater, you guys.
His name is Fernando,
Fernando the anteater.
This one's humongous.
He stays on the ground.
He's quite a big anteater.
Look what he's doing to my arm!
-  Oh my goodness.
It's wrapping around.
- Look what happens when
I hang him like this.
His tail holds onto my arm
the way it would hold onto branches.
'Cause he climbs around up in
the trees in the rainforest.
(laughing)
So he's still really young, you guys,
'cause he's kinda like
a teenager anteater.
He's a year and a half old.
-  He's a messy eater.
- 
Look at this picture.
-  Whoa, look at this!
- 
That's how long the tongue is!
-  So soft, good job, Miss Laura.
Does he feel like a dog or a cat?
Does he feel similar to that or different?
- I would say he feels
a lot the same as a dog.
-  The
other great thing he does
is dig up the ants. He'll eat
other bugs too, like termites.
- Laura just asked the cutest question.
She said, "Does he have
a mommy or a daddy?"
He does, huh? All animals have mommies
and daddies, Miss Laura.
Hi.
So Janae didn't really know
what to do with the armadillo
or the echidna. She kinda
like just looked at 'em,
but then the anteater came
out and she said "dog"
and she's lookin' and waving
and she's very excited.
(uplifting soft rock)
-  That's gonna be a good picture.
Did you hear the name of that rhino?
It's Rhinoceros Unicornis.
- Yeah, that's its scientific name
because it only has one horn.
-  Wanna try?
-  Elise just tossed it in.
-  Dad, it's horn is like wood.
-  So they said
that most of the time
when they do this tour
that they aren't able
to feed the rhinos so we got really lucky.
So as they were driving us around
they were talking and educating us about
so many aspects of the animal's life.
Their habitat, them going
back into the wild and mating.
It was just super
interesting and informative.
- I'm so excited.
-  What are you excited about?
- The cheetah run.
-  The cheetah run.
How fast is it gonna go?
- 70 miles an hour
-  So let's
give it up for Rillo!
- So before they have the cheetah run,
they have a dog run to
help the cheetah out.
-  Everyone,
enjoy Bayati's run.
(crowd cheers)
Bayati just ran our 100 meter track
in 5.02 seconds.
Yeah!
(whistle blows)
Fantastic! 5.13 seconds.
(acoustic guitar music)
-  Look at that
baby on its mommy's back.
-  It's just like
you're being held by your mama.
(acoustic guitar music)
- Whole question trivia. What do you call
a, for a better word, flock
of flamingos? It's not flock.
- Herd?
-  Is it a herd?
- (boy) No.
- Is it a "flih-fuh-negger"?
-  A "Flih-fuh-negger?
- (boy) Nope.
-  Do you know the answer?
-  Yeah.
And the answer is, a flamboyant.
-  Look at how
skinny their little legs are.
No offense, flamingos.
Here's what's funny to me.
Why do they not just
sit down in the water?
Look at that one right
there closest to us.
He's on one leg in the water.
Why doesn't he just, like, sit down.
("Landra's Dream" by Anders Baldwin)
-  Tell me if you
can find the animal in here.
-  Is that real?
-  What is it?
- Found it.
-  What is it?
- It's a frog.
-  It's ginormous!
It looks like a painted rock
that we would put in our front yard.
Are you sure that thing's real?
-  Yeah. African bullfrog.
- (gasps) I just saw it move.
Okay, African bullfrogs are huge.
-  What's in there?
-  Leave him in
peace. He's meditating.
("Landra's Dream" by Anders Baldwin)
- The parrot is talking.
-  Yeah? Say "hello".
-  Hello.
-  Hello.
- Hello.
(all gasp)
-  J House, out.
- (laughs) That might be a
little advanced for the parrot.
We're really grateful that the safari park
invited us out to come do some of these
behind-the-scene tours today.
It was a great learning
experience for our kids.
- Their head is so heavy
that their head is 20%
of their weight, and their
head weighs a thousand pounds.

(excited talking)
-  You guys playing with Nae-Nae?
(Isaac roars)
(Janae and Elise laugh)
(Janae yells happily)
(Elise shouts happily)
- Tonight we are finishing our read aloud,
"All of a Kind Family", we
just have a few pages left.
-  And then, what are we gonna
read next for our read aloud?
- "The Whipping Boy"
- That's what I just read.
-  It's a good one.
- He read it, and I
thought it would be fun
for the whole family to read.
