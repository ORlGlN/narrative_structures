-  New pajamas.
(bright music)
- We thought it might
help her for her audition
to practice in front of all of you.
-  There he goes.
- We're playing copy Janae.
(Janae squeals)
(family squeals)
-  You look a
little bit fancy today.
What are you wearing?
- Well I'm wearing my jammies
because I have jewelry on!
-  So you look a little
bit like a princess today.
What should I call you?
- Um, I'm a flower princes.
-  Flower princess.
- Look at this toy Janae.
(laughing)
-  I think Janae wants to eat it.
-  Find the round pink.
(Janae babbles)
- In our family we love
play based learning.
I feel like my kids learn so well
when they're engaged in play.
It's what we do with our big
kids when we're homeschooling
and with our little kids.
And so I was really excited
when LeapFrog reached out
to offer to sponsor this video today.
We've used their toys with all of our kids
from the time Isaac was
born all the way down.
And they've got some fun new toys
that we're excited to show you today.
- So if you press this button.
-  There's a song.
♫ All animals have homes
♫ All animals have homes
- You can play games by moving this.
-  Let's play a find it game.
Find the key.
K.
Find the apple.
- Where's the apple?
Good job!
- A says aa
as in apple.
-  Whichever color.
-  Black.
-  I love this little
clock they have up on the top.
- Look Lise, you can change the time.
- Awesome.
-  One o'clock.
- It's one o'clock.
- Yeah.
- So you may have noticed,
Laura is getting really
interested in letters.
What's the letter for your name?
- L.
- L.
She has been finding Ls everywhere.
Whether or not they're really Ls.
Anything that looks kind of like an L,
she's like, "Look Mom, it's an L."
And so this toy is perfect for her.
- Hello.
-  What would you like?
- Mint and strawberry.
I would like caramel on it.
- How many squirts?
- Six please.
-  Yes.
-  One, two.
- Now I need to pick.
Three, four, five.
- Five.
- Thank you.
And here.
- Thank you.
- You have five coins.
- So Caleb, on these cards,
there's orders from different animals.
So you can fill their orders.
And on the back there's different
games that you can play.
Like stacking, colors.
Ooo, that's one's creativity.
-  Put a card on the register.
- What do you want?
-  Do you have
any strawberry ice cream?
- Yeah.
-  Whipped cream!
-  Can I have
three pumps of blueberry?
- One, two, three.
- Three.
- I also love
that this toy is encouraging
play and taking turns.
Like the kids aren't fighting over it,
because they're taking turns
being the customer and the server.
So, that's awesome.
- One.
- Here's your ice cream.
Ah!
(kids laughing)
Next please.
- I'm gonna choose all my favorite stuff.
- Thank you LeapFrog for
sponsoring this video today.

- Oh my.
-  Holy cows.
Whoa.
- Oh my gosh.
- Look at our tree.
No, look at our tree!
I can't believe it.
You guys, our trampoline just.
- Our trampoline.
-  Oh my goodness.
It moved everything around.
(melancholy music)
- Whoa.
-  This fell off.
-  Yep, we lost part
of the trampoline for sure.
- We might have to rebuild it?
-  I don't know,
we're gonna have to see
if it's possible to fix it.
What do you think of the trampoline Laura?
- Sad.
-  It's pretty sad, huh?
- Yeah, but that tornado watch was so bad.
-  It was crazy, huh?
- Yeah.
-  So guys look.
It actually flipped it again last night.
During the storm when we were sleeping.
'Cause it used to be on its head
and then it flipped over
again back onto its feet.
- How did it flip again?
-  Just more wind
came and did it again.
- I'll just watch you guys.
-  You just wanna
watch us pull it out?
- Yeah.
- We're gonna get a new--
- Dad, we could just pull on
that branch.
(bright music)
-  Nice.
Oop, you're getting all wet.
-  Ms. Laura, are you
still nervous about the storm
the other night?
- Yeah.
And look!
- It was a pretty big storm.
- That tree fell down.
-  Yeah, that tree
fell down a few years ago.
But it was a big tree when it fell down.
- Let's flash back to that.
-  When that tree fell down?
- It's hailing guys, it's hailing.
Our tree just fell down.
Do you guys see that?
Our tree just fell down in our yard.
- Dad, don't pull that tree down.
-  Okay, he's just
gonna move the trampoline.
- Okay, you guys ready?
Okay everyone, stand back.
I'm gonna pull the trampoline out.
-  Oh Jeremy, I
think maybe pulling it
is gonna actually destroy it.
I think we may have to lift it.
-  Because of the branches?
-  Yeah.
There we go, there we go, that's good.
There he goes.
(dramatic music)
(clapping and cheering)
(happy music)
- It looks like we can repair it.
It looks pretty easy.
- Let's see.
-  Go Daddy, you're amazing.
Do do do, boop boop!
(kids cheering and clapping)
-  Uh oh.
-  This is the harder one.
'Cause it's bent.
I'm not seeing this ending well.
Oh babe.
- If you'll hold that down
there and I'll bend it.
-  Okay, everybody hold
the other side of the trampoline.
- You guys ready?
Hold on three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Okay.
-  Hey!
That last one seemed to do something.
- Yeah, but I think I
might've weakened it.
(kids clapping and cheering)
(triumphant music)
-  Dad's testing it for us.
So the actual mat of the trampoline
did not get torn or
ripped, which is amazing.
- Or the net.
- And the net is actually good too.
So Laura's really nervous
about Jeremy trying this
and I don't think it's
honestly gonna work.
I think we're gonna have to get a ladder
and a chainsaw.
But Jeremy's gonna give pulling a try,
which you know, you gotta try.
You pull that thing right down.
(playful music)
I just think it's still a
little too much attached
to be able to pull it off.
But Jeremy's trying!
(laughing)
- (growls) I think I'm
making a difference.
-  You just stay out here babe.
You give it a couple hours.
- I'm gonna get it.
I'm gonna wear it down.
- I love that with this vlog,
we now have records of some of
Jeremy's awesomely inventive
ways of solving problems.
My favorite is when he
throws socks at wasps.
(squealing)
- It's going down.
Victorious.
I killed the wasp.
That worked.
- It did.
It did.
I'm not denying his methods.
I'm just glad we have them
chronicled for posterity.
We vlogged about the story
when he got stuck on the roof
with the baby pool.
(laughing)
That was a funny one.
- Wait.
He got stuck on the roof?
-  Yep, with a pair
of pants and a baby pool.
-  That's true.
-  That's a good story.
-  Shall we begin?
(upbeat music)
Let's begin now.
-  You doing drills?
- Yeah.
-  What you
guys doing this morning?
- Oh, we're playing house.
I'm pregnant and she's my daughter.
And we're at the library.
- And she's my mom.
And I'm pregnant.
- This is slash, phone, slash tablet.
It's gonna be a girl
and Caleb's my husband.
- And mine is gonna be
a girl too. (laughs)
-  So what are you
gonna name your baby girl?
- We don't know, but.
- I'm gonna name mine Scary.
-  You're gonna
name your baby girl Scary?
- Yeah.
-  Awesome.
- And she does not like that name.
So I'm gonna name her Nice.
-  Nice?
- Um hmm.
- Nice is a good name too.
- She didn't like that name
so I'm gonna name her, Aly.
-  Aly.
Scary, Nice or Aly, which one?
- I'm gonna name her Aly.
- Hello?
There's a tornado watch.
(Elise imitates tornado siren)
- Come on, we gotta go somewhere safe.
This is the best place.
Is there any place for shelter?
Okay.
They said it's over here.
-  I looked up
this thing for you guys.
-  Really?
-  They said it's
coming to the library.
- Where is it?
-  It's by our destination.
- Okay.
-  We have to go.
- Ice cream break.
(sighs)
- Guys, we better move!
-  Is this the ice cream break
during the tornado watch/warning?
- Um, look where the tornado is.
-  Uh oh, better
put the ice cream away.
- Bye.
-  Oh, she
still's got her ice cream.
- Isaac and I are doing logic
puzzles today for school.
It's awesome and tricky.
Like some of 'em he gets quicker than me
and some of 'em I'm like oh I got this
and so it's fun to
figure 'em out together.
The current one has Isaac stumped.
But I know you're gonna get it.
- Oh it was an early sell out.
- Let's see.
So you changed your job, huh?
- Um hmm.
-  What's your job now?
- Make movies.
- You're a movie maker.
And is that how you make movies?
With your hand doing that?
(laughing) Somebody's
been watching Daddy edit.
It's time to go through the kids' clothes
and figure out what fits
them and what doesn't.
And I was going through
Caleb's this morning.
He didn't fit any of
his long sleeve shirts.
So we're gonna have Caleb
try on these old clothes of Isaac's
and see what fits him
and what else we need to go buy for him.
- Star Wars.
-  Alright, what do you think?
Does the Star Wars shirt fit?
- Uh huh.
-  How about the
pants, do the pants fit?
- Um hmm.
- What do you think
of the shirt?
- I like it.
Namaste.
-  Namaste!
(laughing)
You're fun to do this with.
- Completely orange.
Namaste.
-  It says football fever.
- Like it.
I'm gonna go show Elise.
-  I like that one.
- It has a hood.
-  Do you like that?
- Um hmm.
I think it fits me.
Namaste.
-  (laughing) Turn around.
Shake your bummity bum.
- Feels like a real basketball.
How did they do that?
-  I think it's on backwards.
Turn it around.
Is it too big?
- No.
-  New pajamas.
- This is a good one for building.
-  You think so?
You're so good at keeping
this entertaining.
This is Janae's new favorite spot.
Hi, you playing with your big brother?
Laura said she has something
she wants to show me.
-  Hello, my name is L.
-  Oh, is this an L?
-  Yeah, but I'm having fun.
I'm playing with sprinklers.
-  What else can you make?
- A bended L.
-  Is it a bended L?
Alright, dinner tonight is
chicken penne pasta casserole,
rolls, grapes and veggies.
(Janae babbles)
(family babbles)
(Jeremy laughs)
(Janae squeals)
(family squeals)
- We're playing copy Janae.
It's a super fun game.
And she loves it.
-  See if we can get her to do it.
Ready, arms up.
(all clapping)
- Having a baby and four other kids,
like each kid make it
exponentially more fun,
when you start just
playing games with them.
It's really fun.
- And exponentially louder,
with a little bit (mumbles).
- So, Elise has kind of an
exciting opportunity tomorrow.
What are you doing?
- I'm auditioning for a solo.
- She's been practicing this
week and she loves to sing.
She's always going
around our house singing,
so she's been practicing.
We thought it might help
her for her audition
to practice in front of all of you.
So here we go.
Sing it for us.
♫ I adore you
♫ Tiny baby
♫ I adore you
♫ Blessed son
♫ I adore you
♫ Lord and Father
♫ I adore you
♫ Holy one
♫ You are my hope
♫ You are my life
♫ You are my everything
♫ You are my peace
♫ My all in all
♫ My savior and my king
♫ You make me want to sing
- That was amazing.
Good job.
I'm so proud of you.
We're gonna keep working on it
and Elise is gonna do
her audition tomorrow
and we talked about how I remember for me,
I auditioned for plays and stuff.
And my first six or seven, I
didn't end up making the show.
But auditioning was such a good practice.
And such a good thing to
eventually where I did get to be
the star of shows and
singing solos and stuff.
And so--
- This is my first solo.
- Audition?
- Uh huh.
Oh my whole life.
- Well I think it'll be good for you,
regardless of what happens,
and go in and keep taking
deep breaths and be
confident and do your best.
And we'll see what happens.
Thanks so much for helping us out
and watching our family.
We love you guys.
J House out.
- Oh my.
-  Whoa.
-  Oh my gosh.
No.
Is it a tornado?
You guys go downstairs.
Go downstairs and.
- I hope our house doesn't break.
- Our trampoline.
(Kendra gasps)
- Oh my!
