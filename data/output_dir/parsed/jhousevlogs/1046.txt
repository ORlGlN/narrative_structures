we're reminiscing and we're talking
about our first kids what I decided to
do right before I met him was to swear
off boys and then I met mr. Jeremy
how can you swear this point anyways so
um it was July at the time of 2004 and I
told myself that I was not going to kiss
boy until Thanksgiving yeah so we
started out just as friends which was
really good because I I actually liked
somebody else and he was just playing
hard to get you like me the whole time
yeah it's true okay there we go one
record it is written you like me the
whole thing what happened is when I told
you that I wasn't going to kiss anybody
until Thanksgiving you said you're gonna
ask me to kiss you before Thanksgiving
and I was like no I won't no I won't and
anyway that was pretty cocky so he call
me of you does that surprise anybody
Jeremy cocky where did that come from so
um this is the story's getting all
jumbled well we've never told anyone
this story that's part of why we wanted
to record this as so that someday our
kids can know about our first kiss
so what I remember the first time was
that we went to Denny's there's one
antek place and then the only place is
open it was late at night it was super
late at night it was open it was pretty
cold it was getting cooler outside and I
remember sitting in white-trash
our car my car at that time and instead
of kissing we would just talk really
close like this and every once while
maybe we would accidentally
but wasn't it kiss it was just and every
once in a while while I would be talking
to you there might be this accidentally
bumped no I didn't get the first but I
think it was like three weeks of us not
kissing but never anything we would have
I would not ask him to kiss me and he
would not kiss me without me being
located but we would have full-on
conversations about like this very thing
cheesy to tell but that's true that's
actually Z and I wish I remembered the
date I don't remember the date
so probably the end of August yeah I
really held that really long there today
I met him in delight I kissed the man
dogged hold off too like we were outside
in the parking lot of the Denny's and he
leaned in to talk to me and I told him
if you kiss me and that was our first
kiss
that I kissed ur good the first of many
big I might add that's true fact we're
going to turn this off so that I don't
have to kiss in front of you
