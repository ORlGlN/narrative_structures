So my sister in law
Michelle just came up with
the most genius thing for bike riding.
Dad sometimes I call you Jeremy
and sometimes I call mom Kendra.
Snuggle season.
-  Crunchy.
I saw you in the first place.
So Nae Nae is doing the cutest thing.
There's a new deli.
And I got a big nasty.
Nae Nae.
(piano plays)
(baby coos)
(piano plays)
Here it goes.
Wee.
-  Woo (laughs)
So, Nae Nae is doing the cutest thing.
When she crawls right now,
she keeps this hand as a fist
and that hand open and
she does that every time.
What are you doing?
Look at that.
Ken and I were saying,
that's one of those things
that she's doing that
we don't wanna forget
'cause she's gonna grow
out of that any time soon.
Who woke up from her nap?
Hey, hi.
She's saying hello.
Okay, so where are the rocky mountains?
There's the rocky mountains.
The continental divide.
Yup, the continental
divide means that the water
on this side goes to the, which ocean?
Pacific.
Pacific.
And the water on this side goes to, where?
Goes to the Atlantic.
Yep, so that's why it's
called the continental divide.
It divides our continent
with where the water goes.
I love how she crawls with
the one fist and the one hand.
-  She wants you.
But then on the wood,
she opens up that hand.
How interesting.
So it's only on carpet that she does it.
Little tongue sticking out.
Yeah watch, woo, woo.
(baby coos)
(soft music)
(crunch)
Crunchy.
Mm hmm.
So this afternoon, I am
going on a bike ride.
Like a legit real bike
ride with some friends.
We're loading up the bikes on
the back of my friend's truck
and we're gonna ride out to this fun place
and Jeremy is getting me all set up
so that you guys can see what's going on.
I don't know if that's perfectly
straight but it'll work.
That looks legit.
There it is.
Is that angle right?
I think it'll work but it
might be a little bit down.
It might be a little bit bouncy.
So, the kids have some friends over
and although it's freezing
outside, they're out here
playing in the woods with tools
and Isaac is gonna go up
and spy on Caleb and Gary.
Lot of leaves fell today.
Okay, so I'm out with my friends.
We're gonna be biking.
Here's all the bikes loaded up.
And there's the trail.
I am layering up.
I'm not one of those people
that has cool winter clothes.
I just never have, so
instead I'm just layering.
So I'm starting with these leggings
and I'm gonna put on
an extra layer of pants
and I've got my uh, what's
this thing called, headband?
So, hopefully I stay warm enough.
This is smart, get warmed up.
(energetic music)
-  What are you guys working on?
I didn't want the table anymore,
so we chose to take it apart.
They're back there.
They're trying to spy on us.
You know I can see you.
Yeah, I saw you in the first place.
-  Sneaky.
They caught you.
It was a good hiding spot.
It's hard to sneak up on
someone with the crunchy leaves.
So apparently we went four miles so far
and now were taking a little break.
It is gorgeous out here
and loving this trail.
My knees and my bum are a little bit sore
but I think that just
comes with riding a bike.
But the weather, I thought
it was gonna be too cold,
but it feels awesome.
So my sister in law,
Michelle, just came up with
the most genius thing for bike riding.
You like that?
Basically it's a diaper,
you're looking at.
So extra padding.
(laughs)
Michelle this is awesome.
The funny thing is, I'm kinda jealous.
I wish I had one of those
so I could do that too.
That looks way more comfortable.
Killing two birds with one stone there.
(adventurous music)
So one of our neighbors
is using a wood fire.
I love the smell of the fire place.
It's kinda cool.
It's starting to feel
like Christmas in here.
(adventurous music)
(mischievous music)
(adventurous music)
Well, we survived.
It started raining so I'm like pretty wet.
But we did it and it felt
great and it was beautiful.
The leaves falling from the
trees and crunching on the path
and just being able to visit.
And anyway, I think I'm
gonna be sore tomorrow
but it felt good today.
Have a good time Isaac.
We're getting hot chocolate at QT.
-  If you can run the
machine it's quite tricky.
If I can run the machine, let's see.
Stop before it gets to the
top 'cause it keeps coming.
Oh, yum, hot chocolate.
So my friend Kate had a genius tip.
You put some frozen hot
chocolate in the bottom
and then fill it up with
regular hot chocolate
so it's not too hot.
Because I'm always such a wimp.
Like it's always too
hot, it burns my mouth.
This is perfect.
I call you dad, but
normally I call you dada.
But Janae calls you dad
and I call you daddy.
-  What other
names do you call me?
Sometimes I call you Jeremy
and sometimes I call mom Kendra.
Because mom's name is Kendra.
Yeah.
(upbeat music)
How was the birthday party?
Good.
What'd you guys do?
So we went down a zip
line, it was really fun.
And it was pretty far.
Then we played capture the flag
but it was in their version
so literally, they had it
so, to get our present,
you have to do a duel.
(samba music)
It has been so long since
we've been on a date night.
It has.
At least, it feels that way to me.
We don't have Janae, that's crazy.
It feels weird.
There's a new deli that we're gonna go to.
Because I like delis.
So it's kinda hard because
we've never been here before
so to pick items, we're
just kind of guessing.
So I went with one of their classics.
Like, apparently, they're
known for their clubs,
so I'm gonna try their club.
And I got a half of a
spud and a big nasty.
We'll see how that turns out.
This looks so good, my only problem is,
I think I'm hungrier than this.
Well, we might have to go eat
more later, somewhere else.
We're buying clothes for Jeremy.
It's fun.
It feels like we just did that,
but it was actually like a decade ago.
So my biggest thing, is
I wanna get some jeans
that are a little bit more fitted
but I can move in, so that
they're comfortable to wear.
All right, now I'm gonna
try on all the clothes.
Definitely trying to lose weight right now
and so it's hard to go
shopping when you feel
a little bigger than you want to be.
Kendra wants a mug.
We own two mugs and I think
we might need another one.
Time for another mug.
But which one?
Don't quit your day
dream, wifey, like boss.
Snuggle season.
Kendra likes to snuggle.
I do, I'm a snuggler.
Cup of happy.
Oh what fun.
When in doubt, buy toilet paper.
I can't remember if we're out or not,
but if you think it, buy it.
We've been out of cereal.
It's been tragic.
Nothing ends a good date night like -
Cereal.
-  Goodnight, J House out.
So Janae just said her very first word.
That one looks pretty cute.
Thank you.
So I have my hair down today.
My whole family's a little confused.
(cheerful music)
