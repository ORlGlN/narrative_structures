-  She likes that makeup.
She wants to eat it.
- I know.
- I'm putting on makeup on
her and this is the lip part.
-  I love your
makeup choices for her.
- Thank you.
And I know how to drive.
-  Wait, you know how to drive?
When did you start driving?
- Um, 12,000 years ago.
I used to drive back when I was a grandma.
-  Obviously.
- So, when I drive, I relax,
and then when I'm done relaxing,
and I see a stop sign, I stop,
and hold onto the wheel, and then I rest,
and rest, and rest, until I see something.
(upbeat music)
- We're training to go all the way around
our, like, whole cul-de-sac.
- Because dad's training
for going on a big run.
- Are you actually gonna
be running with us?
-  I have no idea
what you're talking about.
- We're gonna ride around the neighborhood
while you're running right by us.
-  Who decided this?
- All of us.
(laughs)
-  Wait, but
that means I have to run?
- Yeah.
-  Did you find a worm?
- We're trying to save it.
I'm putting my shadow on it.
-  Get it in the tree's shade.
Now, Caleb, get it down there.
- Think that's enough shade?
-  You wanna
make sure it stays alive?
- I'm gonna put my shadow over it.
I don't know how to keep it alive.
- So, I have the kids helping
me with the classic project
that a dad gives to his kids: moving dirt.
(rock music)
So, we're having a
problem that when we get
a lot of rain, we're getting big puddles,
and some of those puddles are coming
up against the foundation of the house.
- Are there any wasp's nests?
-  If there are, they're
typically right under here.
Come check and see if there are any.
- Whoa.
-  Is there any wasp's nests?
- A ton.
- I can't see anything.
Whoa.
-  Is there a wasp nest?
(whimpers)
Do you see it?
(rock music)
Isaac, what do you think
of this kind of work?
- I like it.
Well, it is hard.
-  It is hard work.
Thanks so much for helping us out.
- Mm-hmm.
-  You having fun?
- Yep.
-  Yep.
-  Is it tilting towards the slope
and away from the house?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Okay, that's what we want.
Do you wanna test it with some water?
- Yeah!
-  You can see if it flows down
the way we want it to.
Okay, Caleb, turn on the water.
Will it flow down the hill?
- It's coming down, literally.
I'm gonna climb up so I don't get it.
-  It's going
where we want it to be.
It's like a mini-waterfall.
I love this.
We're gonna make a pool!
-  Nope, we just
want it to flow down the hill
and not towards the house.
I'm sure glad you like to work, buddy.
(upbeat music)
- It feels good to mow the lawn.
I haven't mowed it for a while.
Bit out of practice, I think.
(gentle music)
So, we've had our van for a while,
and we bought it used initially,
and we definitely can
tell that it's about time
for us to be thinking about a new vehicle,
and so we're headed to dealerships tonight
to see which van to get.
(rock music)
Our current van is a Toyota Sienna,
so we want to check out
the new Toyota Sienna,
see what the new features are.
So, I'm trying to see,
like, little details.
Like, how the seats move and stow, like,
what kind of of a, what's
that thing called in the back?
Trunk space?
Like, what kind of baggage
space, what is that called?
-  Trunk space.
The trunk, what kind of--
- How much storage.
How much storage there is in the vehicle.
This one has a sunroof.
The kids loved that before.
-  Automatic seats.
-  So, we have
a 2006 Toyota Sienna.
-  Oh, do you?
Okay.
- And it doesn't do that.
(laughs)
So, Jeremy's super happy
right now in the show room,
because they're showing a football game.
And it's not just any football game--
- It's a BYU football game.
- Yeah, that's true.
- And we're winning.
And that's almost over.
Which is a good thing,
because I don't want to go
look at cars when there's a game on.
-  You have something in your eye.
- Thank you.
-  I got it.
- Go BYU!
Yeah!
It's not much of an eight seat.
-  Oh, that is totally lame.
You couldn't anchor a car seat there.
- I couldn't put my butt there.
- TMI.
So now, we're gonna check out the Honda.
When we were buying our Sienna years ago,
we looked at a Honda and a Toyota,
so we'll see which one
we think is better now.
-  And these
here, you can move them.
And this one here.
- So, another option for our family
would be this Honda Pilot.
-  We would look
way too cool in this thing.
- So, what I don't like about these
is it has a real door,
and I feel like my kids
would always be opening it into things,
and also, then, you can't
have an automatic door.
Well, unfortunately, my takeaway from this
is that I think I just
wanna keep our old van.
I really like it, and, like,
there's some cool bells and
whistles on these newer ones,
but there's also things that
I prefer about our old van,
so why go through that
hassle and pay more money?
I think we should just keep our old one.
What do you think?
- I don't know.
-  That was profound.
- I would love to know, on the whole,
which car company is your favorite,
between Toyota, Honda,
Nissan, Ford, and Chevrolet?
She's so tired right now.
-  She's been a trooper.
- "Get me out of here."
-  Wanna go take a nap?
And go out to dinner with Mom and Dad?
- Let's go.
- We currently own two Toyotas,
but it's actually not because we're, like,
only Toyota people, that's
just the way it happened
when we bought the newest years ago.
I don't know if I have
a favorite car company.
Do you have a favorite car company?
- I don't.
- We are not big car people.
we like them to go, and, ooh,
I'm a big fan of air conditioning.
For dinner tonight, we're
gonna eat at Abuelo's.
I think we both love that they'll bring us
chips and salsa the minute we sit down.
That's, like, the best
part of Mexican food.
(festive music)
That is her first time in a high-chair.
-  At a restaurant, yeah.
- So, Janae is having a super strong
reaction to the parachute.
I can't tell if she likes it
or if she hates it or
if she's scared of it,
or if she wants to join in on the fun.
Here, see what happens.
- Let's put Janae in here.
- No, we're not gonna put Janae in here.
Ready?
Go.
(kids laughing)
Oh, there's the baby.
Say hi.
Hi.
♫ Let's put the oil in a pot
♫ And make it real hot
♫ Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle, sizzle
♫ Sizzle, sizzle, pop
(squealing)
Do you like it?
Do you like it?
I think she likes it.
I think she wants to play so bad.
Or she's scared.
-  Or constipated.
(kids laughing and squealing)
(screams)
- J House out.
- Good night.
J House out.
Oh, is that a kiss?
Yes, big girl.
Nice one, Lise!
- Alexa, make a fart noise.
-  I've never, ever broken wind.
(all laugh)
