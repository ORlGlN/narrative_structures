eight pants how you feeling good ready
for tonight let's do this yeah
for we're in the car all ready to go and
we're heading to Isaac's at baptism and
this is a really special day for our
family Jeremy I were both baptized as
children all of his grandparents fill
out to be with him today and to be here
and support him in this in our family
baptism is a commitment it's dedicating
our life to Christ and saying we want to
follow you we are grateful for the
atonement in our lives and we're going
to keep trying and I'm just excited and
proud of Isaac taking that step and
grateful that he's setting such a good
example for our other kids to follow as
they get older too so this is a special
day we're not going to vlog the actual
baptism but we are going to show you
guys you know the the pictures and these
special memories surrounding it
don't you feeling about being baptized
today why are you excited about it
because Jesus set an example for us and
I want all of his example well we're so
proud of you buddy we love you everybody
smiling Uncle Fred already
after the baptism we decided to come out
to Pizza Ranch and we actually have a
room reserved for a bunch of our family
and friends to come join us and it's
great because it's the base style and
the kids are like contained in one room
and it's just kind of mass chaos but
it's a happy chaos and that's all that
matters to me tonight groups one of the
most fun things about the buffet is the
dessert and Elise is going to try doing
the ice cream on her own for the first
time okay pull it down
when happening it's just that's the
sound of it getting going you have to
pull it down
okay now push it up push it up all the
way good job
you did it so here's the real reason
that Isaac picked this place to eat
they have basketball
Oh
so some of our family is starting to
take off and I guess that we all want to
see him win the treasure hunt ends zip a
trifle late
