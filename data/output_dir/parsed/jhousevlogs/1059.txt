-  Caleb did
you offer to feed baby Laura?
- Yeah, she see my nipples?
- 
Yeah, do you have milk.
- Yeah, see them?
-  Where's your milk?
- In my nipples.
-  In your what?
- In my nipples?
-  In your mipples?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- So far three out of three of our kids
have been scared of the vacuum as babies.
This little girls just crawled from all
the way down the hall
and she is booking it.
(vacuum running) Now she can play.
Is it fun to drive with the windows down?
-  Yeah.
-  We don't get to
do that very often do we?
- And we're even playing.
- Cause I'm.
- We're even get to putting our hands out.
- I got some in my mouth.
-  You got some air in your mouth?
So Elise are you catching any more air?
- Uh-Huh.
- Look how much air I got.
- Just a regular drive home
with these two crazies.
I have to be honest though, I absolutely
love it when the weather is nice enough
to have the windows
down when we're driving.
-  Mom just realized
that I forgot the floaties.
That would've been a disaster.
- Well you know, they would've
just drowned, not a big deal.
-  Yeah, you're looking hot.
-  I can swim just
a little bit, like about.
-  So we're at the party.
Cubbie's feeling a little bit nervous,
what are you nervous about bud?
- (Whining), I don't wanna go.
-  He's traumatized by the
big Jake and Neverland Pirates balloon.
He had a recent experience though right?
- He's nervous it's gonna pop.
He's not actually scared of balloons so.
He had a recent experience
where a balloon popped.
-  It scared him?
- It was traumatizing, ever since
then every time he's seen a balloon
he's like this, he's like
gripping me, he's got a good grip.
(children yelling)
- Dad's are so much more fun in the
water than moms, at least in my family.
(guitar music)
(children yelling)
(upbeat music)
-  That's so cute.
(upbeat music)
(yelling)
-  Cubbie did you get some treats?
- Yeah.
- It's date night, yay, do you hear
that, it's the sound of silence.
-  There are no kids back there.
-  Just empty car seats.
- Well and for the last five months
or so, we've had to
take Laura on our dates.
- It's true and even now when we do leave
her, we leave her for like an
hour and a half, so it's a.
- And we try to stay pretty close.
- But still, it's the beginning.
It's a little taste of freedom.
- So one of the things that Kendra
loves to do on a date and I enjoy
as well is going on walks and so we
found a beautiful neighborhood up by
one of the golf courses here.
And we're just walking and talking
about what's going on in our life.
And what we're wanting to do, what do yo
love about walking on a date?
- It's really relaxing and I like to see
different places and see different things.
I have always really enjoyed
different architecture
so walking through old neighborhoods
and new neighborhoods and
different things I really enjoy.
- We've never walked in this neighborhood
and it's been really fun to
see the different houses.
- And especially if the weather's nice,
I think there's something
about moving and holding
his hand and just it's
just really relaxing to me.
- So, this is what
we're doing for our date
and I'm enjoying it, this is way better
than just going to dinner
or getting a movie.
And especially if we're not fighting.
Kendra is doing an ancient
folk dance from Austria.
- (Laughing) This is the don't get eaten
by a bug dance, bugs,
I've been eaten alive.
Like I love these lush beautiful places
but we go there and I come home
with 72,000 bug bites, it's true.
-  It's true.
- And Jeremy has none.
- I can't figure that part out.
Maybe we use like the same soap
and stuff, do you use like a
special lotion or cream or something.
- No, even if we both use bug spray.
I just get eaten alive, what I've decided
is that the bugs know that I'm.
- Sweeter.
- Sweet.
- Look, it's pretty.
-  Nah, the camera's just really
not capturing it, ah there
we go, isn't that gorgeous.
-  And I love the little
flowers here in this roundabout.
- Ah, it's so pretty,
this is why I love walks.
Because I love being outside,
truly I'm a nature girl.
I am, I'm a nature girl in my heart.
I'm just not a camping
girl and not a bug girl.
