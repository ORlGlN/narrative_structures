- I mean I had to like really bend down
and push with my legs to walk.
If only you could find a
jolly man with a beard.
- He's downstairs.
(bright music)
(gasps)
- Here it is.
- Beautiful.
- The last step is the star.
(bright music)
Good morning friends.
I am so excited today,
because we are going to get
all set up for Christmas.
We don't decorate too much,
but just that little bit,
it makes a big difference.
I'm really hoping it'll make it feel
more Christmas-y around here.
I'm smiling because our
house is cleaned up.
This is way better than before.
I'm feeling super accomplished
because I cleaned my room.
My room has been the dumping ground
for all sorts of things and check it out.
Ahhh.
(enchanting music)
This is as close to clean as my room gets
and I am really happy with it.
I'm hoping by the end of today
that we feel a lot more
ready for Christmas.
Poll question, are you
ready for Christmas?
("Flight of the Bumblebee")
- I'm putting my baby to sleep.
-  Good job.
- So we usually decorate
our tree in the evenings
and so it feels weird to decorate
in the middle of the day,
but we have time in the middle of the day
and we're busy tonight,
so we're gonna decorate our tree.
Do you guys want to see the lights?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas")
(gasps)
- There is it.
- Beautiful.
- Cool.
-  Alright, we need to start
adding ornaments and stuff.
This is Nae Nae's first time
to decorate a Christmas tree.
She's like a little bit hesitant.
- She doesn't know what it is.
- She touched it.
-  You did it.
-  I'm out of here.
(laughing)
This is crazy.
- This is our tub of ornaments.
I'm gonna take 'em over
to the kitchen table,
and you guys can carry them over.
(bright music)
- There's a certain
ornament that's my favorite.
- Which one is it?
- Ooh.
- It's like that moose one.
- It's probably a reindeer.
- We'll have to find it.
- There's not too many moose
decorations at Christmas time.
- It's that one right there.
-  It's this one?
- Yeah.
- This one's Isaac's favorite.
- It's legs move.
- My favorite is this one.
My favorite one is the star,
because it glows.
- So this one's my favorite.
I got it when I was younger.
- Where's the one's we actually made?
- Ooh, they're in this box.
-  The J house.
- Here's the J house.
-  Do you guys
remember who made that?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Jeremy's brothers made this for us.
Isaac, 2014.
(bright music)
Elise you made this one in 2013.
- Yeah, I didn't know
where to put the scarf.
-  Caleb, check it out.
You made that one.
(laughing)
-  A Picasso.
-  Here's Isaac.
You did that one.
- Oh yeah, I made both of these.
-  Lise, you did that one.
- Which one did I do?
- This one's my second Christmas.
-  Caleb.
-  Is that Caleb?
-  That one's Caleb.
-  The wrapped baby Jesus.
- I remember him making that one.
- Laura, we made some of these
when you were really little,
and so you didn't make 'em yet.
This year you can make one, okay?
You know what?
I made this one,
but we can share it.
(bright music)
- I'm gonna do this one pretty high.
- Mine right here.
-  You're tall enough
to get them up there pretty tall.
- Yeah.
- Our tree decorating
strategy is a little different
this year, with Janae.
-  Nothing on the bottom.
(laughing)
- So the stuff on the bottom has to be
not breakable, and also,
not able to hurt Janae.
We're just starting up
a little bit higher.
- We need to put some more
over on this side.
- This is one of my favorites.
See Nae Nae?
There's baby Jesus.
That's baby Jesus.
You want to help Nae Nae.
Can you put it on the tree?
I'll help you, we can do it together.
Oh she wants it back.
Look we leave it on the tree.
-  But I want that, it's my toy.
It's a whole tree of toys
to taunt you all season long Nae Nae.
(bright music)
- The last step is the star.
- Stick it up right here.
How does that look?
- Yay.
- Yay!
(clapping)
- We did it.
-  Yay!
-  Okay we'll
have to wait until tonight
to see how it looks all glowing.
Laura look at my nose, Caleb.
Laura.
(Kendra laughs)
Got out the girls' Christmas hair bows.
- My favorite one is this one.

-  Somebody's feeling Christmas-y.
The kids found the Santa hats.
The kids are discovering
all of the goodies
in the Christmas bins.
We have three Christmas bins
and I'm working my way through each one,
getting out decorations or ornaments
or just other stuff.
Check this one out
that a viewer made for us.
I love it, it looks like a
little J house gingerbread house.
Did you find the Christmas socks?
- Yeah.
(playful music)
- Christmas socks.
- Look at mine.
-  Did you find
your Christmas socks?
Oh but you're putting them on.
-  It's time to be elves guys.
-  Are you gonna be elves?
- Yep.
- Uh-huh.
-  If only you could
find a jolly man with a beard.
- That's Daddy.
- He's downstairs.
-  He's working though.
Janae does not know what's going on.
-  Nae nae.
(laughing)
How was your nap?
Laura, how did you get in there?
- From Mom.
-  She put you in?
- Alright, you guys let us know
when you are done playing in there, okay?
-  Say that again?
- Negativity.
- Nativaty.
- Nativity.
-  Nativity.
- I want to sign up for it.
-  What's a nativity?
- It's where kids get to act
when Jesus was born and other stuff.
- Which part would you want?
- I'd want to be a shepherd
or maybe Joseph or somebody.
- Or maybe baby Jesus?
- No.
- What you talking about?
(Kendra laughs)
- That would be Janae's job.
-  I was joking Cubby.
- I would be Mary
and I would be holding Janae.
-  Yeah?
- I want to be the baby.
-  You'd want to be the baby?
I think you might be a little bit big
to be baby Jesus.
- I would be like this.
-  You'd kind of crouch up?
So Isaac, if you were
gonna be in the nativity,
what would you want to be?
- Wise man.
-  You are very wise.
Nae Nae, you're sitting on the books.
You're supposed to read the books,
not sit on them silly.
(Kendra laughs)
One of my favorite things
that we've been doing
is spending a lot of time
reading our stash of Christmas books.
Comment below, what is your
favorite Christmas book to read?
Reindeer's Christmas Surprise.
Reindeer sat in his
armchair humming to himself.
He looked at his tree,
its branches glowed with lights,
all the presents were
wrapped up and ready.
(chill jazzy music)
We are headed out.
It feels like it's super late at night,
it's just after five o'clock,
but it's already getting dark over here.
So we are headed to a children's nativity.
The family that we're friends with
in our community puts this on,
and what an amazing effort and endeavor
to put on a whole community event.
It's amazing.
-  We're trying
to bundle up Janae.
It's cold out here.
- She doesn't the hat.
-  It's windy and cold.
- It was warm today,
but there's a strong wind coming in.
(bright guitar music)
Everybody's layered up
with a couple of jackets on,
a couple pairs of pants on, and some hats.
It's still kind of cold.
-  Because there was
no room for them in the end.

-  Look you guys there's a donkey.
Do you want to pet the donkey?
- Oh my goodness.
-  It was windy.
- We had children literally
crying as we walked away,
because they were scared they were gonna
get blown away by the wind.
It was intense.
- And they were being blown away.
- I know, we kept losing our hats,
and there was a point I
had to really bend down
and push with my legs to walk.
Woo.
- One, lights.
-  Ta da!
- Yay!
-  Isn't that beautiful?
Who's hungry?
- Me.
- Me!
- So we're watching the
Great Christmas Light Fight
that's one of our favorites,
and Janae has learned a new trick.
(Janae smacking)
Oh that's a good noise.
- Does she want a kiss?
(smacking)
-  She did it, but what oh--
- There it is.
- There is is.
(smacking)
(Janae shrieks)
(laughing)
- Yay, we're so proud of you, yay.

- They said I'm gonna
have a sugar rush soon.
- We had a really rough morning.
(lively music)
- Is this a flower?
-  It will be.
- I've seen this in movies, so I'm trying.
-  Oh no, is it burnt to death?
