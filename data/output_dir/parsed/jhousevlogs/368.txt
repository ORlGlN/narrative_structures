one how did they get all the way over
here
ha yes sitting well they actually didn't
first come to Kansas City about 10 years
ago it was so dangerous in Congo that
manga had to take him and his family and
fleet they had to leave their home
because it was so dangerous because of
war so for 10 years manga and his family
lived in a refugee camp in Burundi
before coming here to Kansas City
I don't be scared for a lot of refugees
this is their first Christmas in America
and what we wanted to do with manga and
his family was share with them some of
our favorite Christmas traditions what
do you guys think about that
we are going in to find a Christmas tree
and a wreath and a nativity set
well the girls and I are getting ready
to make some homemade Christmas baked
