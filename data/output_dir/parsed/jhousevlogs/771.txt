sad but true the reunion is coming to an
end we are all packed up and driving
away from this gorgeousness Caleb what's
the matter
are you sad that we're driving away from
granny Joe
you know buddy we're actually going to
see granny Joe in a couple weeks
you think we're never going to see her
again are gonna see your buddy I'm so
glad you love your grandma it's been
hard to say goodbye to family
you
okay so while we're traveling we're
going along with Britain Michelle we're
caravanning so we just stopped an eight
makes it a lot more fun for the kids and
they help us out we're trying to
convince him to take caleb but they
haven't decided - yeah he's pretty
exciting on a road trip back there he
needs a lot of help through most of the
drive because things fall huh
your little cubby falls this falls you
love road trips I really wanted to get a
nice close look at all these mountains
so we're going less than five miles an
hour right now it's gonna be a long trip
home so it looks like instead of an
eleven and a half to 12 hour drive home
because of road work I'm thinking this
to me about 15 hour plus Drive crazy
this is so painful
so when life's painful you have two
choices you can laugh or cry caleb is
choosing to cry right now and I am going
to choose to snort what's she doing ah
you choose to burp let's hear it
what are you choose Lizzy
Berbers so we decided while we're
waiting along the drive to do a funny
face challenge with retina show so we're
texting them pictures of ourselves
that's a really unattractive picture all
right we're at a rest stop and luckily
we found one Elise had to poo that's not
something you want to have go wrong when
you're stuck in traffic so to try to
make this traffic more entertaining
we're now trying to beat Brent so we're
in one line one lane and he's in the
other we're gonna see who gets there
faster um and we switched kids yeah
Blake with us and Luke you're cheering
for your dad oh here we go
we gotta we're gonna beat you guys gotta
yes uh are they covered
so I think we found out we moved about
30 or 40 miles in the last three hours
we did not ago we haven't even gone that
far
we didn't we're still I'm about 20 miles
it's been painful but in other news I
did a new hairdo and I think that's
really flat so can do he's been getting
a little loopy it's it's fun
and we sold 10 hours left I'll be here
all night cold
nothing changed we don't know what
happened but suddenly we're going 55
we're great elephants 65 65 oh hopefully
it's not a fake sometimes it's a fake
you know
we're starting to daydream about dinner

triple-decker chocolate cake slice
