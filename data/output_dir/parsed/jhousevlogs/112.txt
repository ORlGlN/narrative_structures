-  Well, we got my sister
Tiffany from the airport.
- And Laura's pants, check!
- What?
Do you want to go swimming?
(upbeat music)
Holy splash.
So, our swim time ended
with a scary moment.
(upbeat music)
(gentle piano music)
-  Baby claps, those are my hands.
- Down the line as far as the river.
The river and over...
(gentle piano music)
-  It is cold out here.
(cheerful upbeat music)
-  So what are you doing, Dad?
- I'm making some Cream of Wheat.
-  Yum, good thing it fills you.
(cheerful upbeat music)
- How is it?
- Good!
- I love Cream of Week.
- You love Cream of Week?
- Yeah.
-  It's, uh, Cream of Wheat.
- Cream, Cream of Wheat.
- There ya go.
- So something fun is happening today.
My sister is flying in to
visit us and I'm really excited
to get to see her and spend time with her.
The kids are thrilled to see their aunt.
I've been running around
like crazy this morning
trying to get the house all
clean, and it's not all clean.
So I'm kinda bummed, but,
I mean, she's my sister.
Houses don't have to be all the
way clean for sisters right?
- Right now we're going to the airport
to pick up Tiffany, my mom's sister.
I'm really excited to see Aunt Tiffany.
Alright, well we got my sister
Tiffany from the airport
and we're stopping at Target
on the way home to get some
fun things for a little activity
we're gonna do later today,
and maybe some food because I
haven't gone grocery shopping
recently, but it's been
so fun, the kids are
chattering nonstop to
Tiffany, filling her in on
everything that's happened
since we last saw her.
So I'm picking up some veggies and fruit
and some yummy stuff for lunch,
we're gonna make some sandwiches at home.
Yummy sandwiches, with
all the fixins on 'em.
- There we go, good work!
- Well we found all sorts of fun stuff.
We're gonna go home and eat well.
Tiffany even got us some
flowers, aren't those gorgeous?
It's gonna be a fun day.
(cheerful upbeat music)
- It's for Fuzzy, who's not there.
Time for dinner, help get ready!
Carry dishes, hold them steady.
- Aunts and uncles hold such
a special place in our lives.
In the comments, I
would love to hear about
an aunt or an uncle in your
life who just has really
made a difference, who
you look up to and admire
and who you enjoy spending time with.
Whatcha doin'?
- I'm trying to get my swimming suit.
-  Did it fall behind the washer?
- Yep.
- Well, can you reach it?
Oh, so close!
Oh, I know what, I could get
you some like salad tweezers.
- Yeah!
- We're headed to an indoor
pool today and I was trying to
round up all of our swimsuits
because we haven't used them
in a while, and Isaac's we're
gonna try to get with this.
Okay, you think that'll work?
- Yeah.
- What else is down there?
- Eh, a pack of wipes,
one of Laura's dresses,
a church shirt for Caleb,
and some soccer, like--
- Cleats?
- No, not cleats.
- Shin guards?
- Yeah, shin guards.
- You got it!
- Better get some more.
Yeah, and Laura's pants, check!
Salad tweezers are really
useful, they should be
like a real tool, like to get binkies.
-  No, don't try to get your sister
with the salad tweezers.
- Or to pick up bouncers.
- So apparently, salad tweezers,
they're not just for salad.
Those things aren't called salad tweezers,
what are they actually called?
Tongs, tongs, is that
what they are called?
So I was holding Janae, and
I leaned over to tell Elise
something about her math problem,
and Janae just like bleh.
When your little sister is
helping you with your math work,
you might end up with
spit-up on your pages, sorry.
- That's so funny!
- I'm sorry.
- It was just like, "Elise
do this" and then (laughs).
- You thought it was funny?
- Yeah!
- Did it surprise you?
- Yeah!
- The perils of doing math
with your little sissy!
So I have the best surprise
for Laura right now.
Every single morning she wakes
up and she crawls into my bed
and the first thing she says to me is,
"Mom, can we go swimming today?".
I'm gonna wake her up from her
nap and tell her we're going.
(gentle music)
Hey, Laura.
Do you want to go swimming?
- Sure.
- Sure, look what I'm wearing!
- Swimsuit.
-  I am wearing my
swimsuit, do you want
to get on your swimsuit?
- Sure.
-  Do you want to go to the pool?
- Sure.
-  Let's go get your swimsuit on.
- If the others are.
- The others are, let's go!
Well it's cold outside,
but we are going swimming.
So we're gonna be freezing
going into the pool
and freezing coming home,
but I think it's gonna be
really fun to swim while we're there.
Swimming is just awesome and we don't get
to do it enough in the wintertime.
(cheerful upbeat music)
Haulin' all the stuff.
We were just walking in and I looked back,
car door completely open,
we're losing our minds.
- So I think every day for the last month
Laura has asked us to go swimming,
and she normally has on a
swimsuit underneath her clothes
because she wants to go swimming.
-  Well, here we are,
this is your big moment, yes!
There it is!
- But we got in the van
and Laura said "I don't like swimming."
(Mom laughing)
That was what she said.
- And that is a three-year-old for ya.
(laughter)
(upbeat music)
-  Laura, are you swimmin'?
Look at you!
- Janae is mesmerized by all this water.
-  Are you gonna get in?
Whoa, yeah?
- Aah!
(splashing)
(cheerful upbeat music)
(fun playful music)
-  Holy splash.
- So the secret on the
slide is to arch your back
and go up on your toes so you
have very little surface area.
-  That's how you get a big splash?
- That's how you go fast.
- Have you tried that?
-  Did you see how fast I was going?
-  Jeremy is teaching Isaac.
Are you gonna try it?
- Yeah.
- I had to kinda show him
all the important stuff
you learn as a kid, to your children.
-  That was good!
- Did you go faster?
- Yeah.
- I told ya!
- Thanks!
- You can practice and get
better and better at it.
Janae, Nae-Nae!
What's that?
(laughter)
- So there's this whole pool
area that we've enjoyed,
and now we're all just in the hot tub
because it's nice and warm.
Are you playing with your Daddy?
I think aunts and uncles are
just cooler than parents.
- It's true.
-  But parents are
pretty nice, too, huh?
Huh, huh, was that a blowing a kiss?
- Watch, I have taught her, I'm starting
to teach her to kiss, Janae, watch.
She's getting it!
(laughter)
(fun upbeat music)
- So, Laura does the cutest thing.
In the middle of swimming,
she gets out, she dries off,
and then she gets back in the water.
And she always says the same thing,
"I'm just gonna dry off a little,
"I'm gettin' a little too wet."
- I get a little too wet.
- Do you get a little too wet?
Are you ready to keep swimming?
(fun upbeat music)
We all fit in the hot tub, yay!
Maximum capacity is eight,
and that's exactly how
many we are right now.
Well, it's just fun and novel to go
to the pool when it's cold outside.
The kids had a great time
and now we're gonna go home
and watch a movie and eat dinner.
So we came out shopping
tonight, we're at Nickel & Suede
checking out some
earrings, we had to get 'em
while she's in town,
so we're looking at all
the different varieties, yes.
- Trying to decide.
So many good options.
- But it's so cozy in here.
(cheerful upbeat music)
It's a cute hat.
- I like it a lot.
- Me, too.
So our swim time ended
with a scary moment.
I was out of the water
and I was changing Janae,
most everybody else was out of the water,
I had already gotten
Laura out of the water,
her floatie was off and I'd
dried her, all of a sudden
I hear Elise say "Laura, Laura!"
and I spin around and Laura
had decided to get back in
the water and play some more.
Was it scary?
So she ended up in the
deeper part of the water,
is where she had climbed back
in, and when I looked over
her head was just above water
and then I saw her go below.
I ran to the edge of the pool, jumped in,
shoes on and everything, and grabbed her.
She said "The water, I
just didn't know the water
"was so tall," and sometimes, you know,
kids just don't realize things.
It's crazy how fast things
can happen around water.
Just be so careful, we
always try to be careful.
We always try to have
plenty of adults and wear
flotation devices and keep
an eye on them, but you know,
that split second you turn
around it can be really scary.
I am feeling extra grateful
for this little one.
(upbeat music)
- Goodnight, J House Out.
- Today we're gonna do
the 100 Layers Challenge.
We're gonna be putting
100 shirts on Caleb.
(upbeat music)
