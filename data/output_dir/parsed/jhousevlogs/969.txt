-  All right,
what are you thinking?
- It was such a big surprise.
Like I thought it was some
kind of toy or something.
And now I'm so surprised.
(Kendra laughs)
(fun, energetic music)
-  So Isaac and
Elise are making cards
for the families that we deliver
Meals on Wheels meals for.
- Kendra, there's a toy in the toaster.
Look at that.
- It's my toy.
- No, it's mine.
- It's melted, it's like--
-  I wonder who did that.
- Probably Caleb.
- I wonder who did that.
- Oh, it was me, maybe.
It was me maybe.
- We have a little over two hours
to deliver Meals on Wheels,
have Jeremy and I both
shower and get ready,
and get this entire house ready.
- Check it out.
(Elmo talking and laughing in background)
They don't know about this.
- Done.
-  Laura is a climber.
(Laura squeals)
We got another climber, yay!
Trying and trying and trying to get up
onto this fireplace nook.
Did you do it?
-  Her try to get down.
(gentle music box music)
-  Come on, come on.
(Caleb grunts)
All right, can I take a turn?
-  No, not yet,
because I want to do this.
- Okay.
So, today I was talking to Kendra,
and we're trying to
get the house all clean
for our exciting surprise today.
And I was like, "Maybe we shoulda just
"got a substitute today
for Meals on Wheels."
But I'm really we didn't.
It was fun for the kids to get to
see the people that we see every week,
give them Christmas cards,
and now shovel the walkway.
So our house might be
a little bit messier,
but I'd rather have a messier house.
- I felt happy.
-  What, you felt happy?
- Mm-Hmm.
-  Why were you happy?
- Yep, yeah we visit every week,
this wonderful woman
who's older and alone,
and her health is continuing to decline.
And I think you guys really made her day.
- So we're cleaning up,
and we're down to the wire.
We only have about 15, 20 minutes left.
So I go to check on him,
he's supposed to be napping.
But I hear a funny sound.
-  I'm nervous.
(Caleb laughing)
-  Triple
antibiotic ointment tube,
completely squeezed all over the window,
and everywhere else.
-  Mm-Hmm, and
now I'm putting a book.
- Is it on the carpet?
-  Oh, now he's
trying to put a book on it.
Anyway, and this is why--
-  Don't touch it anymore, Buddy.
- Nothing can be in his
room, except for his bed.
We forgot.
Laura and I are on our way to the airport
to pick up my Mom and Dad.
And I'm super excited.
The kids don't know that they're coming,
and it's gonna be just really exciting.
We don't get to see them very much,
'cause they live so far away,
so this is gonna be quite the treat.
And it's actually super nostalgic for me,
because when I was young,
I think somewhere between
the age of four and six,
my grandparents, my Dad's parents,
surprised us the same way.
(Kendra laughs)
- Hey, hi Dad.
(Dad laughing)
Hi.
- Hi.
All right, close your eyes.
Here comes the surprise.
Ready?
And you can open in three, two, one.
- Merry Christmas
- Guys, Merry Christmas!
- Hello.
-  They don't know what to do.
- Elise!
- Grandpa!
- Yay!
- Hi guys, hi, hi!
- We came to see you.
-  Did you know we were coming?
Did you think we were coming?
Elise, our glasses are matching. (laughs)
Are you surprised?
-  Yeah.
- Did you know we were coming?
-  You are so big.
- No, you didn't know that?
We get to have our matching
glasses, look at that.
-  Caleb.
-  You can play tickle monster.
-  Yes, we're gonna
play tickle monster.
- What do you think?
- (laughs) I thought it was gonna be
some like toy or something.
- Aw, it's way better than a toy.
(Papa laughs)
- Clean the floor, whee.
- Can we play tickle monster?
(Papa growls)
(everyone laughing)
- A little bit harder, oh...
- I don't know why the kids
like it when Papa comes.
(Papa laughing)
He's like a human gymnasium.
So I made dinner, and I'm cleaning it up.
Jeremy is putting Laura down for a nap.
My Dad is doing math with Isaac.
My Mom is reading with Elise,
and Caleb's just running around.
Apparently all I need is four adults.
All day.
And then I could be like sane,
and get stuff done. (sings)
- How would you count by threes?
- Well, three, six, nine.
- A boy party.
- Perfect.
- 12, 15,
- What was that?
- 18, 21,
24, 27.
-  And so every time you have two--
-  And I love you, and.
There you go.
- So my Dad is Mr. Fixit,
and every time he comes to visit,
I conveniently have a few things
that maybe he could look at.
So he's fixing a towel rack.
- Yes, that's right.
- Apparently there's some sort of
an indoor snowball fight going on.
(Papa laughs)
(kids scream and laugh)
These are bean bags.
-  No!
(screaming and laughing)
-  Caleb, no, oh.
-  Incoming, incoming. (screams)
(everyone laughs)
- Holy cow.
There's four.
There's five.
There's six.
There's seven.
There's eight.
Yay (claps) a new world record!
Isaac has just done
eight bean bags in a row.
How do you feel Buddy?
- Happy.
- Wow, we're excited as well.
Back to our regular scheduled programming.
-  How about you blow up a bed?
- That's a great idea.
Why don't we do the blowup bed?
- Okay say, "Goodnight Papa."
- Goodnight Papa.
- Thank you.
That's a great idea.
- Say goodnight.
- Love you Cubby.
- Goodnight.
- Say J House out.
- J House out, bye.
(fun active music)
-  Ooh, nice snow angel Lisey.
