- All of them are beautiful.
-  I'm making a house.
(lively big band music)
-  What is going on?
- I'm gonna make a pumpkin patch.
I got my first eye done.
- We're ready for the show now!
-  Is that clapping your hands?
Hi.
(sweet music)
Hi.
You're doing it, you're doing it.
(Kendra laughs)
Hi.
(funky upbeat music)
- Phew, that makes me tired.
(rolling wheels)
-  Thanks for doing your chores.
- Yeah.
-  Some screws came out and Caleb
was wanting to put 'em back in.
- Am I going the right way?
-  Righty tighty.
Thanks for taking care of the piano.
- Guys, I'm so happy that
the trampoline is okay.
Yay, can we get a thumbs up on this video
that the trampoline is alive and well.
Well it looks like Caleb
is doing something cool.
I love seeing him out exploring
in this kind of weather.
Let's go see what he's up to.
(chill twangy music)
How's it going?
- I'm making a house.
-  You're making a house?
- I'm gonna put four of these down
into the ground in a square.
Then I'm gonna get more sticks,
and build them up on every side
and on the roof, I'll
just set them on the top.
-  That's a good plan.
What tools are you gonna use?
- Shovel and hammer.
-  Yeah, that is a big stick.
How big are you wanting this house to be?
Like the size of our house?
You're gonna build like a
three bedroom, three bathroom.
- It's gonna basically be for only me.
-  Okay.
- So one bedroom, I'll
make my own king-sized bed.
-  Nice.
Maybe I can come out and
sleep out here with you?
- Yeah.
- That'll be fun.
You're working hard, good job buddy.
- This one is gonna take me a few hours.
I'm gonna be working on
it as long as I can today.
I just need another stick,
like this one.
-  Alright,
well I'm excited to see
what you come up with buddy.
♫ I adore you
♫ Tiny baby
♫ I adore you
-  Are you singing to Janae?
- Mmm-mmm.
-  She's so tired, I
think she's gonna go to sleep.
- (whispers) She fell asleep.
- Kendra and I a lot of times feel like
we don't have any time to do things
that are important or
that we want to get done.
And we really want to focus
on not making that excuse anymore,
because we have time,
we just have to choose to
use it in the right way.
(rousing beat music)
You guys gonna help me?
-  Okay.
-  Good job.
♫ 525,600 minutes
♫ How do you measure
♫ Measure a year
- How about
♫ Love
♫ You took the midnight
train going anywhere
♫ Strangers, waiting
♫ On and on
(bright music)
- So Kendra's been having a rough morning
and I thought this would cheer her up.
- So I'm struggling today
and it was really tempting for me
to not share with you guys
that I'm struggling today.
Sometimes I feel like my struggles
don't fit in in our happy life
and sometimes I feel silly
and embarrassed to share it,
because I do, I have a really good life,
there's a lot of beautiful things in it,
but in spite of that, I struggle.
I struggle with depression and anxiety
and it's a battle every day
and some days that battle is hard
and today that battle feels like
it is beating me up inside.
So what I'm picturing in my mind today
to try to help myself, is a rollercoaster.
And rollercoasters, they go
up and then they go down.
And then they go up and then they go down.
And when you're on a rollercoaster
and you go down, you don't go oh no,
the rollercoaster's broken,
this is terrible, get off the ride!
I mean you might be scared,
because it's going down,
but it's part of the ride
and you know that.
You know the ride's gonna go down,
you know the ride's gonna go up
and it's all part of the ride.
And so with my daily life
or with my anxiety and depression,
when I feel like coming down,
I try to picture that it's
part of the rollercoaster,
like it's gonna come back up.
It's going to,
and that it's part of the experience.
It's part of my human
journey here on earth
and that it's okay.
It's okay to have times that go down
and just because it's a
time that's going down,
doesn't mean it's not gonna come back up.
It sounds like a cliche at this point
but the struggle is real
and if you're struggling, you're not alone
and today I'm going to do my best
to enjoy the rollercoaster.
Nobody can be sad with this
little chica around, huh?
Whoops.
(Kendra laughing)
What is going on?
Oh my goodness.
She pulled herself up to the fireplace
and now she wants this piece of paper.
So Jeremy and the kids came home
with a smoothie for me
and I just thought that was so thoughtful,
like that definitely sounded amazing,
and I just thought it was sweet
that Jeremy did think of me.
And now I'm getting to do something else
that I love, which is snuggle
with my babies and read.
We're reading this one, The Cookie Fiasco.
Hey guys, cookie time.
(laughs)
Uh-oh, hold on, there are three cookies,
but four of us.
Someone will not get a cookie.
- We have time to exercise.
(rousing rock music)
-  She's loving it,
oh look at her smile.
- Ooh.
- I got to go on a walk out
in this gorgeous weather
and now I get to hold
and play with this baby.
And I'm doing math with Elise,
all things that I love.
(lively classical music)
-  You got it?
- We're carving our own pumpkins.
-  Alright we've
got all the pumpkins here.
What's different this year Elise?
- We're carving them, not painting.
-  So the kids
are going to get to use
these carving tools
with our help and supervision of course.
And they're going to each get to carve
their own pumpkin.
(enchanting music)
-  Alright, we
got to clean out the guts.
- That is super heavy.
-  Alright, start scooping it out.
- See you have to like scrape it out.
-  That's right.
-  So what are you gonna do
with all those pumpkin seeds?
- I'm gonna make a pumpkin patch.
That's not guts.
- What about this one?
- I have my own guts.
-  What are you talking about?
- I'm my own guts.
-  Where's your guts?
- In here.
-  That's where
your brain is dude,
that's not your guts.
There it is.
- There it is.
- One two three.
- Oh that's heavy.
There's so much guts in there.
- So much guts.
Alright, there's Lise's.
- Blech.
- Let me get you a spoon.
- Uh-huh.
-  Look what we got.
It's called a pumpkin.
- It just smells weird.
-  Yeah, oh she's eating it.
-  She's eating it.
-  Nice trade, good work guys.
(grunting)
What are you making there Laura?
- I'm just stirring it up.
It's gonna grow.
-  Oh a pumpkin's
gonna grow in there.
- Yeah, 'cause I told everybody,
one time I did that when I was a mom.
-  When you were a mom?
- Yeah.
-  What about
when you were a grandma?
- Because I did swirl
it, when I was a grandma.
-  Isaac is going in.
-  I'm doing good.
-  You're doing great.
-  Eyebrows done, I love it.
- It's almost done.
(Jeremy gasps)
-  It came out.
- I got my eye.
I got my first eye done.
-  So did you tell
them why we got a honeydew?
- So for Kendra and I,
our first Halloween, when we were engaged,
there were no pumpkins
and so we got a honeydew
and carved it.
So now we do it every year.
-  It's a tradition.
So Laura is in charge of
washing the pumpkin seeds.
So she's washing them, moving
them over to this bowl,
washing them again, straining them,
she's got a whole system down.
- I made eye lashes.
- Good job big girl.
- Who wants to come see mine?
-  I want to see yours.
You have pumpkin in your hair.
Right there.
It's on this side.
So this is going surprisingly well.
-  I don't know
if this is working.
- Well it's very romantic.
Remember the year that
you did the J House?
- Yeah.
- I remember that.
(spooky enchanting music)
- Okay we're gonna show the kids
the jack-o-lanterns with candles in.
Okay, come on.
(laughs)
-  They look awesome.
- And it smells good.
- It smells like smoke.
-  It does, the
smell does smell good.
- Guys they look great.
Caleb I love the teeth on yours.
And Laura, I love the big smile on yours.
Lise, yours have lashes,
I've never seen eyelashes on it.
Isaac, your nostrils are amazing.
- All of them are beautiful!
-  Good job guys,
we're gonna put 'em out
on the front steps.
- Did you do the heart?
-  Yeah.
-  It looks amazing.
Dinner tonight is spaghetti with veggies
and an apple and rolls.
So I'm cleaning up after dinner
and next to a certain
child's cup, I find this.
Did you see this Jeremy?
- The Lima beans
-  It's three Lima beans.
Apparently that child
does not like Lima beans
- Who likes Lima beans?
Let's be honest, in the poll question,
do any of you like Lima beans?
Let us know in the poll.
- This is making me laugh,
because I remember how much
I hated Lima beans as a kid.
Now they don't bother me,
but they're still not my favorite, but
it's a classic.
- So we've hearing some
really strange noises
from the kids, and a lot of laughter,
so we're not sure exactly
what they're up to.
- Ready for the show now!
-  Okay let's see it,
what have you been up to?
-  Three two one.
(violin stroke)
(slapping)
(laughing)
-  Do you guys have
a sound maker over here?
(squeaky violin music)
- Good night, J House out.
- Good night, J House out.
(lively music)
- Made it!
-  Is this your magic wands?
- Yep.
- The sticks chose us.
Those are very bad.
-  What in the world,
I've never seen this before.
Oh they're going that way!
