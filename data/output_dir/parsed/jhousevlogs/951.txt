- So after the kids go to bed tonight,
Jeremy and I are going to be doing
some serious resolution talk,
but before they go to bed
I want you guys to hear
their New Year's resolutions.
(bright orchestral music)
-  What is your
New Year's resolution?
-  You want to
go motorcycle racing?
Alright, what else do you
want to learn this year?
(Kendra Laughs)
-  Alright Miss Elise,
what are your New Year's resolutions?
- I want to go swimming without,
swimming without those things.
-  The floaties?
- Yeah, floaties.
-  Yeah? What
else do you want to learn?
- I want to learn to have a dog.
(Kendra laughs)
- To take care of a dog.
-  Alright Isaac,
what are your New Year's resolutions?
- Riding a bike without training wheels,
swimming without floaty.
I want to learn how to do
flag football, basketball, and gymnastics.
And to do stuff more nicely.
I want to be more honest
and not complain when other people
get do funner stuff than me.
-  Wow.
Those are some really good
New Year's resolutions.
So, since it's January fourth
this is not a New Year's resolution,
but I do appreciate this time of year.
Like thinking about kind of
where we're at with our life,
where we want to be at
this time next year.
What we, like, it's a good
time to kind of reevaluate
and be deliberate about who we are
and who we want to be,
and what it's gonna take to get there.
But, I really, I honestly struggle.
I'm a perfectionist
and I struggle with taking
small steps towards who I want to be.
I see the picture.
And I see so clearly in my mind,
the mother and the wife and
the woman that I want to be
and I just feel like trying to get there
is sometimes walking through quicksand.
And I start thinking about
like ooh, what should my
New Year's resolutions be?
And immediately my brain starts going,
"ooh, I want to run a marathon,
I want to decorate my house,
I want to be the best homeschool
mom I can possibly be.
I'm gonna be so nice to all of my children
and I'm going to be the best wife ever.
And we're gonna start clean eating,
and I'm going to do 50 weeks
of organization for my house,
and were going to declutter,
and we're going to
serve the world".
- I think they get the idea.
- Okay.
Anyway, I overwhelm myself
and so it's really hard,
but as I was thinking
a lot about this year
and what I want to really, really work on
is I feel like I want to work
on my relationship with God.
I believe in God and in
the busyness of my life,
I've allowed myself to be distracted
and be more distance from him
than I would like to be in my daily life.
And so, of all the goals and dreams
that I have for this year
that's the one I want to cling to
and focus on everyday,
is I just need to revitalize
my relationship with Him.
And I know that that will help
some of the other pieces
in my life fall into place.
- One of my major, like,
sayings that I love is
you know, I want to live
life for no regrets.
When I'm 75 years old and I look back,
did I do the most important things?
Did I take the risks
were important to take?
Or the decisions that led
to the outcomes that I want?
I really believe in the concept
that we reap what we sow
and at the end of this year coming up
will I be partaking of
the fruits of the seeds
that I'm planting right now
of the happiness that I want.
Anyway, we're thinking a lot about that.
We're trying to finalize,
like, what are the things we're gonna do.
- We're having a lot of good discussions
about where we are now
and what we honestly need to be working on
and sorry, you have an eyelash
- Oh, oh, oh
- Well, not an eyelash
that would be an eyebrow hair
- You have a (mumbling)
(laughter)
- I think now we're both ready
to kinda get into some good patterns
and a saying that I've heard before
that I really appreciate is,
"thrive don't just survive".
And I feel like we really need to
- Get out of survival mode.
- Get out of survival mode.
And find and cling to the habits
that will help us build
the life that we desire.
Because I really think sometimes,
like yes, the big things are
exciting to set goals for,
but a lot of times it's the little habits
that make up the biggest
difference in the year.
- Yeah, and fighting laziness.
Cause laziness, you know,
- Or distraction
- Yeah
- Fighting distraction, like
(sighs)
- I was just gonna say
I think on at least one
or two of our big goals
we wanna let you guys know about it
and that help motivate us.
It's been amazing.
- That would be awesome
to have accountability.
- Yeah so, we'll carefully consider
which goals we want to let you know about
because I think that'll help us feel
the excitement to get it done
and you can help keep us honest with it.
So, we'll let you know about
that when we figure it out.
Thanks so much for being
part of our YouTube family
and I've loved this part of our life
and we have a lot of
things we're thinking about
and talking about with the vlog too
that we're excited about
for 2015. So stay tuned.
