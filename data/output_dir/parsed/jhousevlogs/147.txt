(crickets chirping)
-  Good morning.
So it's funny how it gets darker earlier
in the morning as we move into fall
and towards winter.
It just feels earlier and
more painful to get up.
In our family, Janae
and Laura are typically
the first ones up.
Let us know in the poll,
how about for you?
Are you the first one in your family
or do you wake up later?
What do you want to eat
for breakfast this morning, big girl?
- I want to eat cereal.
-  Cereal?
Alright, let's do it, come on.
(sneezes)
Bless you, bless you.
♫ I wish I could be perfect daughter
♫ But come back to the water
♫ See the night in the
light of the sea sea sea
♫ Hi me
- I spilled.
-  How did that happen?
- I was pouring it, when I
put my arm in and it spilled.
-  Alright, let's clean it up.
(uptempo music)
(Janae squealing)
- So we have a bunch of
laundry to fold this morning.
Some of the laundry is
because I just went through
the growing box for Janae,
and got out a bunch of the new
clothes she's growing into,
and we're washing those and folding those.
But as I'm folding,
she's crawling around me
and she is going from
crawling to sitting up.
You gotta decide which way.
Oh you're coming this way.
Oh, back to the sitting.
Come on, come over here.
She's coming.
She's coming, oh, you
almost got that foot out.
Yeah.
(laughing)
Yeah.
Come this way.
Come on, Caleb's over this way,
He's the cool one.
Yes, you did it.
You did it.
-  Come on.
-  Are you doing it?
Oh, you did it!
- Ready go.
(piano playing)
- So Anne Michelle is
such a good piano teacher.
She found curriculum
that is related to Elise having dyslexia.
I thought that was really awesome.
- Dun da!
- Yay!
(clapping)
- High five.
- Woo!
- Good job.
- For lunch today,
we're basically cleaning
out the fridge and all
eating different leftovers.
And it's so hard for me sometimes
to finish leftovers.
Like they get stuck in
the back of the fridge
and then we end up throwing them away,
but that's wasteful,
so I'm trying really hard
and we are eating all of our leftovers.
Waste not, want not.
-  What are you guys doing?
- We're raking.
- We're raking.
(bluesy rock music)
-  We'll have
to get the leaf blower
out here soon too.
Do you remember that?
- Yeah.
- When we made one big pile over there.
-  That was really funny.
- That was two or three years ago.
- Three years ago.
- Remember when we built like
- this humongous pile,
and then you blew it on us.
-  You were still in a diaper,
you were just two years old.
(sweet piano music)
(leaf blower whirring)
(yelling)
(laughing)
- One, two three, waaa!
-  Let's make a leaf angel.
(yelling)
(Kendra laughing)
- Three ahhh!
(leaf blower whirring)
(yelling)
(majestic classical music)
- I started this game this morning
with Dad and we've just been playing this
through the day.
- Unfortunately Laura
moved one of the pieces.
-  Did she?
- I don't know which one though.
- I moved it back.
-  Okay good.
- It was the king.
(Jeremy laughs)
- We'll have to see who wins.
- I think I might win
for the first time
because I got a chess book
from the library.
-  You've been
studying up on what to do?
-  Yeah.
- It's getting intense.
Check mate.
Alright, you're gonna
have to read the book
a little bit more.
And let's keep playing, okay?
What do you think you
did wrong on this one?
- I went too aggressive.
-  Too aggressive, too fast,
you got to think through the moves.
-  So Janae is starting to drink
out of a sippy cup.
(laughing)
She grins while she's doing
-  Do you want a
hug from your big brother?
- You want to hug Cubby?
(screaming)
- I want more water.
(laughing)
-  Now is not the time.
The sippy cup is fun.
(laughing)
It's fun.
She is so cute.
(laughing)
- So Caleb just barely
wrote a new lullaby.
I want to share it with you guys.
You want to show us Cub?
(piano playing)
That's so pretty, how did
you come up with the song?
- So at first, I looked at one
that actually was almost
exactly like that one.
-  Very similar.
- It's actually the exact same thing.
-  Oh.
(piano playing)
So you didn't make up a song,
this is just one of your songs.
- But I made up this.
(uptempo piano playing)
Where are you guys heading?
- Gymnastics.
- Have fun.
- Woo!
- So these kids are heading to gymnastics,
I'm taking Isaac to his soccer practice.
Who are those cute people?
You going to gymnastics?
- Yes.
-  Have fun.
- Bye!
- I think we're both gonna
be about three minutes late,
but we're really close.
You're gonna be on time?
We might make it on time.
Bye.
- Bye!
- Bye!
(uptempo music)
- So the gym is doing a fundraiser today,
where they're selling old leotards
and the girls were both so excited
when they came in and saw all the leotards
and they're really cute.
I would like to get one,
but they are only selling
them for cash or check,
and I do not have cash or check on me.
Bummer.
This one's cute.
(uptempo electronic music)
(atmospheric music)
-  How was soccer practice?
- Good.
I was about to drink this,
and I realized it wasn't screwed up.
-  You're a little wet.
- Just a little bit.
-  Whose right behind us?
That's Mom and the kids.
We're at the exact same intersection
that we were at before.
How was gymnastics?
- Good.
- Good!
-  Did you have fun?
- Her, Lise's tooth fell out.
-  Your tooth fell out?
- It's a joke, she's teasing us.
-  I thought you were serious.
It's just a piece of the sucker stick?
- Yeah.
-  How did Nae Nae do?
-  Good.
(violin picking)
-  So let the fingers stay
just barely above the string.
There we go.
-  Good night, J House out.
- And that's what we need to be strong.
- I just want the floor to be safe
for me to explore and um,
I spit up, that's all.
(laughing)
