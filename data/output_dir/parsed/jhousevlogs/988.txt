- Laura, can you say hi?
(babbling)
Say Hi!
- Hiiii
(laughing)
- Good morning friends, guess what?
Laura is crawling!
-  On her knees!
- Yep, she's been scooting forever but she
I've seen her, yesterday and today, crawl.
Hey come on I got out the camera
hey you, come here you! Go get 'em!
Look! Look!
(cooing)
(♫ Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy ♫)
(rattle shaking)
-  Come on, Laura.
Come on!
(joyful cheers)
Put these toys right here. Come get 'em!
Come get em. Ahh look at it, I saw that!
So she's been doing tons
of this up on her toes
like downward dog yoga pose, it's awesome.
(laughs) Hi, Laura!
(drum solo)
This may be a really bad idea,
but for some reason I really wanna try it.
We are gonna try sewing
Christmas ornaments.
I know, with my kids right?
They're all little, but
I really wanna try it
so we'll see how it goes.
-  Mom, look what happened.
It fell off.
- That's okay.
And then you go down...
- I'm getting a lot faster.
- I really appreciate the
kids being able to learn
and do something that's
kinda challenging for 'em.
- I'm done!
- You finished it!
- Yeah!
- Oh, that's just beautiful!
Yes! He did it! Very nice.
And Elise is ready to start another one
and Caleb and I are in negotiations.
He wants to make a gun.
I would actually call
that activity a success.
I was really actually
kind of nervous about it,
but here's the ornaments the kids made.
There's one from Elise, I guess
those are both from Elise.
That's Caleb's, there's
Isaac's is the diamond,
I made the Christmas tree and
Isaac also made the stocking.
And I'm going to hot glue on this ribbon
like at the top so that
they'll hang on the tree.
- Caleb made a manger, he's very creative.
For little baby Jesus.
-  He told me it was
a present, he wrapped it up.
- Present (Laughs) Perfect.
- Caleb is asleep--
- Hi
- Hi, and so we are getting
some schoolwork done.
Isaac set a goal at the
beginning of the school year
that when he reads 100 chapter books,
he wants to go to Texas
Roadhouse with Mom and Dad.
And I said, "Sure!" So he's keeping track
of how many chapter books he's reading
and so far, how many have you read?
- 75 and I have to get to
100, only 25 more books.
- I was drawing me and I was the princess
and I got scared from the dark.
-  Oh let's see it, this is Elise
as a princess getting scared of the dark.
I have to show you guys
Elise's copy work today.
She was learning to write Merry Christmas.
After Isaac is done with
his calendar notebook,
we are going to start working on a book
that we're going to be
working on all of December.
It's called 'Christmas Around the World'
and today we're going to
be learning about Australia
and what Christmas is like in Australia.
I'm headed in to pick up
Elise from ballet class
and I'm hoping to catch
some of it on video.
(cheery classical music)
Hi, Elise! How was it?
- Good!
- Good. Hi, Charlotte!
Let's get on your jackets, huh?
So I just picked up the girls from ballet
and we're headed into the
grocery store because I
because we ran out of
diapers, can you believe that?
That's kind of a lie, we have six left
but anybody who knows babies knows
that six diapers is
completely insufficient.
We also ran out of wipes,
so I've been a parent
for six and a half years and I've never
ran out of diapers and wipes.
So this grocery store
gives out free cookies
and I think Elise has
some ideas in her head.
What are you wanting?
-  Cookies
- Uh oh, alright we'll see how nice
of a mom I feel like being right now.
- Because I have a friend!
- Is this your friend?
- Yeah!
- Cookies (silly talk)
(bubbly orchestral music)
- This is the type.
- So Miss Laura has been
kissing me a bunch today
Come on, show me kisses!
(smooches)
- Camera shy. Wanna kiss daddy?
(family cheering)
- I'll hold you, I'll
hold you, I'll hold you!
- I wanna do it again.
- You wanna do it again?
- Yeah.
- This could go all day long.
- Oh man, I could not
do this all day long.
- He could.
- Ready?
I'll hold you, I'll
hold you, I'll hold you!
- Kendra won.
- I crushed Jeremy.
- Okay so--
- I crushed him
in our Disney Side Contest awesome-sauce.
- She did, you guys love her
which is great I love her too.
So my video of the Disney
Side Contest got 36 likes.
And two thumbs down, and
then Kendra got 54 likes
and definitely the comments,
more people liked her.
- And no thumbs down.
- There is some consolation though,
because I did participate,
I was the fairy godmother
in your video, so--
- It is true, starring role
And true disclaimer, not only did he edit
my entire video, but he
also came up with the idea.
- It's her video
- But it was really important
like, he came up with the idea.
I'm not a creative genius,
he's a creative something.
- Clearly! You guys saw my video right?
- Well the time has come
for us to say goodnight.
You can always tell when it's time
because my arm gets tired
of holding the camera.
Ah, relief!
- Goodnight!--
- Anyway, J-house out.
