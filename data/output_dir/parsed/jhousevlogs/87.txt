- Do they know where we're going?
(lively jazzy music)
-  We'll be back soon.
- It's really kind of fun.
- Laura!
- Love you.
- Bye guys.
- Bye.
-  So we're at this
crazy awesome house for a party,
and they said we can explore.
-  How'd you
sleep last night buddy?
- Good.
I slept until 7:10, I kept track.
-  What did you do to your hair?
- I braided it last night.
-  Very nice.
-  Nae Nae doesn't have any food.
- Do you want some food Nae Nae?
-  Yeah.
-  Let's get her something yummy.
- So basically, nothing about
today is going as planned,
and I'm trying really
hard not to lose my mind.
I don't know why I make plans,
because nothing ever goes
according to those plans.
So Jeremy and I are flying out today.
We're going on a little trip
and we're really excited about it.
Jeremy's Dad, we call him Poppy Rod,
is flying in to watch the
kids while we're gone.
They're really excited
to see their grandpa,
but Jeremy unfortunately had some stuff
come up at work and he's busy busy working
all this morning, and so instead of me
being able to take a shower
while he goes gets his dad,
I'm taking all the kids to the airport
looking like this.
Awesome.
Do you want to go?
(Janae vocalizing)
Let's go get Poppy Rod.
Get in the car, baby.
- Da da.
-  Oh, Dada,
did you just say Dada?
- So we got here at the airport,
so now we're looking for Poppy Rod.
It's really kind of funny.
- I'm excited that
Poppy Rod is gonna come.
- I'm really excited to see him.
And also I'm excited to talk to him
about Fantasy Football.
- I'm really excited
that Poppy Rod is coming,
because I can also talk to him
about Fantasy Football,
even though I'm not
doing it this year, I can still keep
on track of Fantasy Football.
- I see him.
- Poppy Rod!
-  I see him!
- I see you guys.
- Get out, Lise unbuckle it.
- Hi buddy.
-  They're all excited.
- It's cold out here,
I need to get in there.
-  It is cold, get in here.
There he is, Poppy Rod.
- Yay!
-  They're all excited.
- How are ya?
Ahhh!
Laura!
Lise, you can't sneak by me, no way.
Ahhh!
-  Who made this mess?
(bright music)
-  Thanks for cleaning up.

- Yay.
-  So Isaac, what's been happening
with Fantasy Football?
- Well, I barely made the
playoffs by .3 points.
-  Yeah, we had
to take down Poppy Rod.
- .3 points.
- It just barely happened.
-  But Isaac is in the finals.
- Yep.
-  There's only four teams left,
and we'll keep you updated on how it goes.
- And one of them is Isaac.
-  And Caleb just can't
wait to do this next year.
- Yeah I'm doing it next year.
- He's so excited.
- I'm already playing.
- I'm gonna miss you.
(groans)
- Give me a hug!
- See you guys later.
- I don't want you to go.
-  It's a short trip kiddos.
We'll be back soon.
- We'll be back soon.
-  And you guys
are gonna have way more fun
with Poppy Rod.
Well there's the real reason
they're gonna miss us.
(Janae coughing)
- Let me hug the baby.
-  Oh (laughs),
that's how she says goodbye.
- Okay, one kiss.
-  Can I hold her?
-  Bye!
- We're waving.
-  Have fun, bye.
- I forgot my jacket.
-  You're gonna
need it, it's cold.
Bye kiddos.
Thanks Lise.
- Love you.
- Bye guys.
(gentle music)
Well the sky is beautiful
and that is a beautiful
reminder to chill out.
We had a really honestly stressful morning
and then it came down to crunch time,
you know, trying to shower
and pack and get out the door,
and the kids were kind
of jumping off the walls.
And I'm so grateful for Jeremy's dad
that he's here.
It was just stressful
for me to say goodbye,
but it all worked out.
I need to get better at that.
I need to get better at finding peace
during the chaotic moments,
because I tend to feel the chaos
and the anxiety and then afterwards
I'm like oh it all worked out.
I just need to get better
at feeling that peace
in the midst of the storms.
- Do they know where we're going?
- I don't think I told
them yet where we're going.
(playful suspenseful music)
- Jeremy's excited.
This is like a bucket list item for him.
- You know how sometimes there's people
you watch on YouTube, and you're like,
it'd be fun to meet them.
That's how I feel right now.
- He has been wanting to hang out
with these YouTubers for a long time.
This pre-dates most of our YouTubeness.
Where we're going.
- Oh yeah, before it was even on YouTube,
I was a fan of this.
- Yes and long before we were on YouTube.
This is like years before
we were on YouTube.
So Jeremy's gonna be a little
bit of a fanboy this weekend,
- Yep.
- and I'm along for a crazy ride.
(funky beat music)
She's ready to go.
-  We're at B-10.
I never forget where we're at.
- It's always good to
have a little reminder.
(playful music)
-  So they have little heaters,
where we're waiting for the bus.
- Thankfully because it's cold.
We made it through security.
And we just have about five minutes
until we start boarding and
poor Jeremy is so hungry,
so we are going to try to find some food,
before we get on the plane.
He found a salad.
- I was hoping for like a Whopper
or a big hamburger and
fries, but this will do.
- I just freaked Jeremy out,
I'm like do you have the camera?
He's like no, and I'm like
well I don't have the camera,
and I'm looking all over for it.
Guess where we found it?
- In Kendra's hand.
- Not even in my bag,
- She was holding it.
- it was in my hand.
- Nope, in my hand.
- Anyway, okay Janae, are
you ready for a flight?
Say, I'm gonna sleep.
(jazzy festive music)
So this flight was actually a little rough
for Janae, she is tired.
Our plane landed and there's a problem,
with, is it the jerry?
- The jetway?
- The jetway, like the
thing that you walk through
to get off the plane,
there's a problem with it
and so we've been waiting
for a little bit, like maybe 20 minutes.
- There's gonna move us to a different--
- So now we're all sitting
back down and packing back up,
and moving to a different gate
soon to get out of the plane.
Not a big deal, unless you're a fussy
nine month old baby who's tired.
- But this is gonna make
us more late to the party
that we got to get to.
- 'Cause we're going to a party.
Yay, we're getting off the plane.
-  Nae Nae.
Hey (laughs).
Hey little stink bug.
(enchanting music)
- So the most important
thing you guys need
to know right now is about
this little button right here.
My bum is nicely warmed, toasted perhaps.
- I have a warm seat.
- So we are headed to a party.
Guys, we are so excited.
We are in Utah,
and we are going to be filming a video
with Studio C, which
Jeremy is a big fan boy of.
(upbeat music)
- I love Studio C.
- So, we're also gonna be hanging out
with some other YouTubers,
it's gonna be an epic video,
and tomorrow's the shoot
and tonight's the party,
so we'll see you there.
(uptempo music)
It's dark out and it's freezing,
but we are at the coolest place
for this party tonight.
This place has like a moat.
- Wow.
A climbing wall.
They said we could go look
at the master bedroom.
- So basically I get
to go on a house tour,
which I love.
- We're coming into the office.
Wow.
(atmospheric music)
-  Is this the master bathroom?
-  I think so.
The toilet has magical
powers it looks like.
(Kendra laughs)
- Those are the weirdest toilets.
-  And I think the
toilets are warming up the seat,
because they know we're nearby.
I don't know, I'm guessing.
- Whoa.
- So I just had the best experience.
The hotel receptionist made my day.
Like she was just so nice and friendly
and sometimes I think we
have to do like these amazing
things to make a difference
in peoples' lives,
but we just have to be nice to each other.
- Thank you nice receptionist lady
for making our day.
- It's the little things.
J House out.
- I had to really bend down and push
with my legs to walk.
If only you could find a
jolly man with a beard.
- He's downstairs.
- There is it.
- Beautiful.
- The last step is the star.
(bright festive music)
