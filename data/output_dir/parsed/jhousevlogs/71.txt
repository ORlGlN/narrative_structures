Well it was awesome to get
to visit with my friends
and they're so sweet and generous.
They brought all these donations for
the pregnancy resource center,
and it's just fun to see
cute little baby items
and to know that they're going somewhere
where they're going to be needed.
-  We've never had four out!
-  Alright,
have fun little chicks.
(giggles)
- Oh they have a certain dance.
So they jump, and then peck at each other,
jump, then peck at each other.
- They're kissing.
Well I'm really glad
that we had the chicks,
it brings out like a softness
and a tenderness of your heart
to have a pet that you're caring for
that you want to survive,
that you wanna take care of,
and it's really fun to see
the kids interacting with them
and seeing them grow.
- Do you wanna play fetch buddy?
Go get it!

and before we left we had
a chance to take a picture
of all the kids together

travel with a kid before.
Jeremy and I had such a hard time
with just like the car
seat, and the stroller,
and like one extra bag,
it makes me a little
nervous about traveling
with all five of them.
We're traveling, with
all five of our kids.
-  In two weeks.
- Yeah!
(upbeat instrumental music)
Going on your first flight?
-  Yeah.
- You say, will you marry me?
That's what you say.
- Brothers and sisters
can't marry each other.
- Yes!
- No.
- We are all loaded up in the car
for our last day of school celebration
in our pajamas.
We are going out to
breakfast in our pajamas
to one of our favorite
restaurants which is Ginger Sue's.
(playful guitar music)
What do you think of your french toast?
(playful guitar music)
Ooo getting some syrup?
Jeremy and I ordered a veggie
scramble over potatoes.
Good morning, today is
Sunday here at the cabin,
and we are headed to church
with my whole family.
I love that experience.
You know, we're enjoying
all of our cabin time
out in nature, and then
we get to get dressed
and go in and worship together.
Today's an especially
special Sunday for us
because we're actually going
to be blessing baby Janae,
that's something that we've
done with each of our kids,
is we give them a special baby blessing,
and they look so cute in
their little blessing gowns,
and we decided to do it
while we were here in Arizona
because my family's here and
so much of Jeremy's family
also lives in the area,
so it's a special Sunday for us.
So my parents have created the
coolest play area out here.
(upbeat techno)
Good job Laura.
Oh, so close!
(upbeat party music)
You wanna write the check?
- Let's do it.
-  Today is the last check.
- The last check to the bank.
We're grateful for the
ways that this world
opened doors in the future
for other opportunities
for serving and doing
charities in other ways.
We really feel blessed.
- Well we've been having a
good discussion with the kids
about paying off our house,
and what that means and what a loan is,
and trying to teach them all
these complicated things.
I'm excited that this house is ours,
and I'm really proud of Jeremy,
he's worked really hard and
we're paying off our house.
- Say happy birthday mom.
-  Hi!
- You made me this year!
-  Hi!
- Thank you!
-  33 was a good year.
- I cut my hair all by myself.
-  Are little girls
supposed to cut their hair?
- All by ourselves you mean mama?
-  Yeah, are we supposed
to cut it all by ourselves?
Why did you cut your hair?
- Because I wanted to all by myself,
cause I'm a big girl!
-  We have our little
cheering crowd over here.
(cheering)
- Go Janae, go Janae!
- Go Nae!
- Go Nae!

It actually went pretty well.
I was really nervous,
but when the kids came up,
they just sparkled and shined.

and although we didn't film it,
we had some friends who caught it,
so you gotta check this out.

and see that is amazing.

- It's so dark and it's
not even two o'clock!
It's moving!
It's moving!
-  Everybody,

(Kendra laughs)
(smooth techno)
- Now we're going to try
to find the White House.
(presidential music)
I don't know why I have to take a picture,
like there's a million pictures,
I could just look at the
picture, but it's cool
to be able to take the picture yourself.
(national anthem instrumental)
I think they're gonna have a great day.
