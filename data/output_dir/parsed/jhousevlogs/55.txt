-  Sometimes you
need to get a picture,
you gotta climb with
your family down a cliff.
- Getting a family of seven
ready for family pictures,
it's not a joke.

- You can't be in California without going
to In and Out Burger.
(upbeat music)
Well Janae and most of the kids got up
very early this morning.
(upbeat music)
There you go.
-  That's so cute.
-  What are you girls working on?
- What we did yesterday and then
writing things we're thankful for.
-  So every morning the kids
are writing in a gratitude journal.
- Lights, food, lunch, dinner, breakfast.
-  So you're grateful for meals?
That's a good one.
Some people don't get a meal at breakfast
and lunch and dinner.
- Sometimes they get one of these.
-  Or none.
(upbeat music)
Family snuggle.
- Mama's still tired.
-  But we're snuggling.
- It's a good thing this
is a king sized bed.
- Just lay on top of us.
(upbeat music)
- It's been so fun having my parents here
and today's their last day with us.
They're headed home tomorrow morning.
(upbeat music)
- Well today is Martin
Luther King Day, MLK Day
or a national day of service.
So our congregation here in San Diego
for the last 10 years does an interfaith
service project with
several other churches,
Muslims, Jews, Christians,
they all get together
to serve on MLK Day.
Today we're gonna be beautifying
and cleaning up Balboa Park,
which is a famous park here in San Diego.
(upbeat music)
- I'm allergic to onions and wood
and oranges since I don't like them.
-  Oh so you're allergic to onions
and wood and oranges?
- Yeah.
-  How do you know you're allergic
to onions and wood?
- I don't know.
-  How can you tell?
- Because.
-  You're crazy.
I like you.
So while Jeremy and Papa have the big kids
at the service project at Balboa Park,
Grandma and I are taking the girls
to get some errands done.
First I obviously have
to get ready for the day,
which by the way, the
injustice of the universe
we are taking family pictures today
and check this out.
Yep, zits on family
pictures day, it's a thing.
-  As Dr. King said,
keep moving forward,
fly, walk, crawl, do something.
Don't be passive and
there are so many things
that we can come all together
and work all together on.
(applause)
- Now is the time to lift our nation
from the quicksands of racial injustice
to the solid rock of brotherhood.
Now is the time to make justice a reality
for all of God's children.
(piano music)
-  Yes Mommom, that's me.
So this is Jeremy's toothbrush.
Don't tell him I gave it to her.
I rinsed it out really good first.
But it's on, like the power's on right now
and so it's vibrating.
She does not know what to do with it.
What do you think big girl?
- Dad, I found chopsticks.
-  Maybe we should keep those.
Alright, so we're cleaning up leaves
and then we're gonna spread this mulch
all through this area of the park.
(piano music)
I think that this is one of those moments
when humanity is at its best.
When racial, ethnic,
social barriers are dropped
and we're all working
together for our common good.
Just really excited that we heard
about this opportunity while
we're here in San Diego
to help make a difference in
one of the parks that's here.
So they were a little short on rakes
so we're getting creative.
The park looks a lot better.
- That's what we did.
(upbeat music)
- I need to talk to Moana on my phone.
She can't come with us.
-  You want Moana
to come with us to Target?
- Yep, yep.
- Well my least favorite
part of family pictures
is trying to figure out
what we're all wearing.
For some reason it stresses me out.
But I've got it mostly figured out,
which is a good thing
'cause it's this afternoon.
I just need a different shirt for Isaac
and a little bit of something for her.
Hi, hi guys.
So when we came home from
the beach the other day
and were covered in the sand,
in the comments somebody
suggested that we put baby powder
on the kids beforehand and then apparently
the sand will come right off.
So we're gonna try it.
(upbeat music)
- You can't be in California without
going to In & Out Burger.
(upbeat music)
Good bite.
- So from my bed, I can
see out onto the patio
and I keep watching the birds out here.
They keep flying into
this one light fixture.
Upon closer inspection there's a nest.
And I'm wondering if there's
any eggs in the nest,
so I'm gonna try to check.
- Anything in there?
-  I can't tell, it keeps,
the bird keeps flying
up here so I'm trying to
see if there's like eggs
or something up there.
I'm trying to get all the way up in there.
-  Alright, we decided after lunch
to play some Monopoly, Disney version.
You guys excited, this is your first time
to play real Monopoly.
We've done Monopoly Jr.
Elise has castles and
if Papa rolls a three
or a five, he owes a ton of money.
- Eight.
-  Oh he made it.
- One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.
Oh, I'm on my own property.
-  Elise is
trying to make it through
all of Papa's castles.
You did it.
One, two, three...
So after playing Monopoly,
what do you give it as a game?
- I loved it.
It's kind of like Life.
Basically you have your own experience
and decide what you wanna
do and you can trade
and stuff like that.
- Poll question, do you like Monopoly?
Let us know in the poll.
So Laura, what are we getting ready for?
(laughter)
- Family pictures.
-  Family pictures.
- On the beach.
Getting a family of seven
ready for family pictures,
it's not a joke.
-  Serious,
it's a full time thing.
- It's a lot of work.
(upbeat music)
I really don't like doing
strip family pictures.
It super stresses me out
and either does Jeremy,
but I did a poll for an Instastories
and the majority of people
like doing family pictures.
I think maybe we need to figure out
an easier way to do it.
- Family pictures while eating donuts.
- There we go, that's
actually not a bad idea.
While we're driving, I'm trying to decide
which earring I'm wearing.
I have studs on this side
and my fun big earrings on this side.
So I decided to do a quick Instastory
to get people's opinions and guess what?
It's like 51%, 49%.
So that's really no help.
So now I'm just nervous I'm gonna forget
and accidentally wear
two different earrings.
(upbeat music)
(orchestral music)
- Sometimes you need to get a picture
you gotta climb with
your family down a cliff.
(upbeat music)
So Shawna was a friend from
college that Kendra and I knew.
And she lives here in the area
and is doing our pictures,
we're really excited.
-  Caleb, you taste like pizza.
- Everybody look at Shawna.
-  You're so gorgeous.
- Spin around.
Spin around again.
(upbeat music)
One, two, three, no, no.
- Well I learned that you don't need
to do your hair before you
come take pictures at the beach
because it's so windy.
But it's gorgeous out here and I'm excited
to see how our pictures turned out.
Check out this seashell.
Oh my goodness.
- Can I see?
-  Look at it.
-  They've wandered off.
(upbeat music)
-  Goodnight, J House out.
-  Where are we at?
- The beach!
-  Were you keeping watch for us?
(laughter)
- This is so fun.
- Donut with cookies and
cream ice cream and sprinkles.
(upbeat music)
