-  It moved on me! It moved!
(Jeremy laughs)
It moved!
-  Is the tide coming in?
(orchestral music)
So our kids are so
exhausted from all the fun
that we've been having lately.
I'm actually having to
wake them up this morning,
which is crazy, that never happens.
Well, not these two, they're still awake.
Good morning, Caleb.
Oh man, they're like sound asleep.
Good morning, Leesie.
Hi sweetheart.
- Good morning.
-  Ready for a day of life?
- Mm-hmm.
- I walked a lot.
-  Yeah, we have.
Well then you're in
trouble, 'cause we're going
on a hike today.
- Uh oh...
Puh-zyeti-oh.
(Kendra chuckles)
-  Dude, that kid is out.
There he is, good morning.
- What time is it?
- It is so late, you slept so awesome!
High five for sleeping!
So this is a huge deal in our family,
because usually Caleb is
one of the first kids awake,
and so he is learning to sleep!
Good job, big guy!
I'm so proud of you!
(Caleb chuckles)
(light piano music)
Well, it's so sad because we're coming up
to our last week here in San Diego,
and my list of things
that I want to do here,
we haven't done it all.
And so I'm trying to
start, like, packing it in.
So the kids are getting up early
so they can get their schoolwork done,
and their chores done, and
we can get out and play.
(classical music)
We made breakfast cake.
-  Who wants some breakfast cake?
-  Me.
-  They're,
like, already eating it.
- Birdie!
Birdie!
Birdie, I'm down here.
I want the bird to land on my finger.
-  You want it to swoop
down and land right there?
- Yeah.
-  Did it fly away?
- Yeah.
-  I'm so sorry.
- Maybe the parents can yell out loud,
and it will go to you.
-  Maybe if I yell
at the bird it might come?
- Yeah.
-  You know, birds out in the wild
rarely come and land on your finger.
Unless it's a seagull and
you have a granola bar.
And a seagull flew by and took the whole
granola bar out of her
hands, and flew away.
-  And flew off with it.
-  You remember that?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah. (chuckles)
(jazz music)
-  Caleb is working
so hard on his math today.
He is writing the
numbers from zero to 100.
And it's the best
handwriting I've ever seen
him do with numbers.
How far are you?
- 39.
-  Do you think you
can make it all the way to 100?
- Mm-hmm, I've done it before, wanna see?
-  So here's--
-  That's a lot sloppier.
-  Yeah, it is.
Now show us today's.
Boom. Way to go, mister
kindergarten pants.
(Caleb giggles)
(Janae pants)
You are getting so close!
Oh, look at her go!
(Janae giggles)
(keyboard tones)
So while we're here in San
Diego, we do not have a piano,
and so the kids have been doing this app
to be able to do some piano practice.
It's not the same at all,
but at least they're like,
thinking about notes and
rhythm and music and beats
and then we'll get back
into piano when we get home.
Whatcha readin'?
- Percy Jackson.
-  Nice.
Laura's in her happy
place, playing with water.
Do you know how to use that one?
-  Mm-hmm.
(laughs)
-  What'd you find?
(Janae grunts)
- No shells!
- I'm trying to finish
a thumbnail for a video
that we're posting,
and I'm just struggling
to make it all work.
-  YouTube life, back at it.
And I'm on dish duty, I've
unloaded, I've reloaded,
now I'm washing the bigger stuff.
♪ This is the job that never ends ♪
♪ Yes it goes on and on my friends ♪
♪ Some dishes, we get 'em started ♪
♪ But then we make some more ♪
♪ And then we keep doing
dishes forevermore ♪
♪ This is the job that
never ends (woots) ♪
♪ Yes it goes on and on my friends ♪
- Both Elise and I were
in here, just hoping
that you were vlogging the
goodness that was being sung.
♪ This is the job that never ends ♪
♪ Yes it goes on and on my friends ♪
♪ We do our dishes everyday ♪
♪ We load them, and unload them ♪
♪ Then wash and dry and put 'em away ♪
♪ This is the job that doesn't end ♪
♪ Yes it goes on and on my friends ♪
So the kitchen's finally
all the way clean,
and I turn around, and
I look at the clock,
it's almost lunchtime.
It's life, the circle of life.
Dishes, food, dishes, food.
I'm grateful to have food
to eat and dishes to eat on,
and hands to clean with.
- Dad, I'm gonna get in my office.
-  'Kay.
(bouncy music)
- First stop on our itinerary
today is the post office.
We are paying our taxes and sending off
those postcards to friends.
-  Are you my helper?
- Yep.
We're next in line.
-  Yes.
And then I was wanting these also shipped.
Thanks for helping.
(Caleb giggles)
- We happened upon a fun
pizza place for lunch today.
(bright music)
Is it bright and sunny out?
This restaurant has a really cool setup.
We're eating right here, and our kids
are eating right there!
Cool kids.
-  Wuh-wuh!
- So we bought pizza by
the slice and chose a bunch
of their fun gourmet pizzas.
-  So we get to try them all.
And they have amazing breadsticks.
-  How's the pizza?
- Really good.
- So this place has stuffed garlic knots.
This has ricotta, spinach, and mozzarella.
It's really good.
-  And their
marinara sauce is very good.
- Mm-hmm.
Can you say more? More?
How do I say more?
She likes the crust.
So we just discovered that
Laura was sneaky today.
Ah! (laughs) Did you decide
to wear your swimsuit?
(Laura giggles)
I am not going home.
I am staying here in the sunshine forever!
(harmonica plays)
-  This is awesome!
-  Do you guys know
what instrument that is?
- It's a harmonica.
-  Yeah.
So this nice guy just stopped
and started playing for us
as we were walking to our car.
- Hey, do you guys wanna clap for him?
Awesome!
(energetic music)
Tide pools provide a
home for many animals.
Tide pools are created by the
changing water level or tides.
The high energy waves
make this a harsh habitat,
but the animals living here
have adapted over time.
(relaxed music)
-  Hey, Laura.
Good thing you got your swimming suit on.
So one of the things
Kendra most wanted to do
in San Diego was go tide pooling.
It's when the tide is way out,
and you come to the pools of water
that are left to look for creatures.
It's like a treasure hunt.
And we brought our galoshes
from Kansas City for this day.
- Oh yeah we did.
-  Isn't that cool, you guys?
Like, it's its own little
pool of water here.
-  Do you see it grows
all the way along the inside.
-  What's this?
- Coralline red algae.
Oh, is that a snail?
'Kay, so feel that right there, so softly.
That is called coralline red algae.
So do you guys see all of these?
These are called gooseneck barnacles.
(pleasant music)
Yeah, there's seaweed and seagrass.
I had no idea there was seagrass.
-  It's green, it
must get a lot of water here.
-  Let's go over there.
Here's some more red algae.
-  What is that?
-  It's a starfish.
-  A starfish.
-  It's so cool.
-  Do you see how
it's wrapped around the rock?
-  Mm-hmm.
- It's like a rock.
-  Yeah. Laura's comin'.
(Laura laughs)
-  Do you see right there?
That one is called sponge
weed or dead man's fingers.
- Laura got some water in her boots.
-  Some of them are actually stuck.
-  So we're finding
bunches of little snails.
Ah, I can feel it!
Put it back in its home.
- A huge shell! We got to show Mom!
-  Look at it.
So a big wave could come and knock us.
I have a bad habit of trying
to get too close to the waves.
(laughs)
Are we gonna get all wet?
It definitely could happen.
(laughs) That was close.
What I love about this kind of an activity
is the adventure of it.
It's like a treasure hunt,
trying to find what's out here,
trying not to get hit by the waves,
trying not to fall in the
water, climbing down the rocks.
I love that our kids
are getting adventurous,
and it's educational.
You guys see that?
-  Yeah, I see it.
-  What is it?
-  It's soft!
-  And it moved!
-  It moved!
It moved on me!
It moved! It moved!
(Jeremy laughs)
There's so much!
- So these circular shaped
creatures are sea urchins.
(Elise yelps)
- So tide pooling was on my must-do list,
but honestly, I was a
little bit nervous about it.
I didn't know what to
expect, I've never done
anything like it before, and so I kind of
subconsciously was procrastinating it.
Like, I'm like, oh
we'll do it another day,
and now our time is starting to run out,
and so we decided to come out here today,
but I still was like, I
don't know what to expect.
And it is so fun, and it
just makes me really grateful
to come out and, you know, be brave,
even when you don't know exactly
what you're getting into, give it a try.
Here's the tide, coming in.
Janae just wants to get
down and I obviously
can't let her down, and so
she's getting a little fidgety.
(Janae cries)
Naenae's not too happy, so
Jeremy's taking the girls back.
- We traded. Come on.
- Laura needs to go potty
and Janae's just done
with this experience for now.
So I'm gonna bring the
big kids in a minute.
Is the tide coming in?
-  Yeah!
-  Is it time to go?
-  No!
-  Check out this seashell!
Oh my goodness, it's beautiful!
What'd you find, Isaac?
- A squid.
- A squid?
So we learned that the
sea anemones are open
so that they can eat and
defecate, which is poop,
and that they eat phytoplankton,
which is microscopic plants.
Do you guys wanna go see the
lighthouse before we go home?
-  Sure.
- I love how, when we
first arrive somewhere,
the kids are all timid and cautious,
and then by the end, they're
like scampering about,
so excited and I just
love seeing that progress.
So we're done tide pooling,
and now we're gonna
drive up to the lighthouse.
- What is that?
-  It's a house
that has a big light on top.
So we were at the tide
pools near Point Loma,
and so we had to come over to the Cabrillo
National Monument, which has
a beautiful view of San Diego.
Check this out.
You can see everything.
So this is a monument of
Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo,
and he was the first European to discover
the California western coast back in 1542.
The first three sailing vessels to enter
San Diego Bay came from the
direction you are facing.
Wow.
San Diego's first lighthouse
guided ships along the coast
and marked the entrance to
the harbor for over 30 years.
I'm not taking a picture,
sweetheart, I'm taking a video.
(laughs)
This is a real lighthouse, guys.
-  So at the
lighthouse, they've blocked off
getting up into the top
room, but we can see it.
- Beautiful.
-  So this is what
the light looks like up there.
They had to magnify the light so it could
shine out super far.
I'm guessing, I don't know it
all, I have to read about it.
- Like a fire, they had to
have lenses and mirrors.
-  So we're learning about
the history of lighthouses.
They used to be very complex.
Now, this is like a modern lighthouse.
Very simple.
Most lighthouses aren't
even staffed nowadays,
and they said that
sailors still rely on them
as they navigate, even
though they have GPS
and all the other technology
that we have today.
- Does anyone have a penny?
-  Mexico over there.
You can see all along.
Well the ranger just came
and told us they've closed,
so we're gonna head to dinner.
(pleasant music)
(Laura laughs)
- Keeping it real.
We have some tired and maybe
grumpy children. (chuckles)
And so we had planned
to go to a restaurant
and try out something
new tonight for dinner,
but it's time to come
home, so we're eating
deluxe gourmet peanut
butter and honey sandwiches
for dinner, and then we're
going to put the kids to bed.
- Goodnight, J House out.
-  Who puts
ice cream on a burger?!
So we have something important we wanted
to talk about with you guys today.
When we compare ourselves to
others, it brings sadness.
Check out this s'mores milk shake.
