("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)
- Tonight we wanted to do
our Christmas favorites.
Hashtag Christmas Favorites.
We're picking four categories where
we're gonna share with you our favorites.
Our favorite Christmas
movie, song, treat, and
favorite Christmas tradition.
Oh and in the comments if
you wanna share some of
your Christmas favorites, we'd
love to hear them as well.
- We would.
- Alright, we're doing our
favorite Christmas movie.
I'm trying to write down
what I think Kendra's is
going to be and she's
gonna try to pick mine.
We'll see how we do.
So for Kendra's favorite movie I guessed,
White Christmas for the traditional
and Elf for modern.
How'd I do?
- So there are two categories for me
and he got one of 'em right.
White Christmas is
definitely, I mean definitely,
hands-down favorite movie.
We watch it every year as
a family, we sing along,
we dance, it's magical.
- Yeah.
- But my favorite modern one is not Elf.
I like Elf, don't get me wrong.
But it's not Elf.
- What is it?
- You have a second guess?
- Is it one of the ABC Family Originals?
'Cause I know you're a sucker for those.
- No, my entire family
can quote this movie.
- Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Oh for sure, I know this,
but I don't think of it
as a Christmas Movie.
- I'm Sorry.
- It's While You Were Sleeping.
- That is my other favorite.
Okay, I went with It's a Wonderful Life.
- She's right.
- Really.
- See how hard was that?
So yeah, It's a Wonderful
Life is my favorite movie.
When I watch a movie the
things that I look for or
I want in a good movie
is character development
and it inspires me and It's
a Wonderful Life does that
so I watch it every year.
- Alright, favorite Christmas song.
- I know yours.
- Good, 'cause I don't know mine yet.
Can I have a lifeline?
- A lifeline, she needs a lifeline.
-  Hello?
- Troy?
-  Jeremy?
- Hey hey.
- Hi Troy.
-  (mumbles)
- Hey you're on the vlog right now.
-  I watch the vlog every day.
- So Troy, we're doing
like a newly-weddish game,
asking questions about
each other and I'm using a
lifeline and I'm calling you
to help me answer a question.
-  Okay, let me put you on speaker,
we'll have Emily's help too.
- Hi Emily.
- Hi Emily.
- We love you guys.
(Troy and Emily bickering)
- Is that your final answer?
Wait, you're a lifeline.
(laughing)
-  The First Noel,
it's gotta be The First Noel.
- It's gotta be The First Noel?
I should have known that one.
But...
-  It's my final answer.
- It's true, it is, it's The First Noel.
Yes.
- Good job Troy, you did it.
- We love ya.
-  Love you, see ya. Bye.
- Bye.
- Alright, what's my
favorite Christmas song?
I'm excited to learn what it is.
- This is Kendra's
favorite Christmas song.
- Okay, it says O Come All Ye Faithful,
and that has been my
favorite Christmas song
for the bulk of my life.
- Until this year?
- No, up until a couple years
ago I would have for sure
said O Come All Ye Faithful.
- What happened?
- But I've just been...
- What?
- Starting to lean Joy to the World-ish.
- What?
- â™« Joy to the world.
- Oh when did that happen?
I think it's this one still.
She's wrong.
Okay.
- Alright what's our next topic?
- Favorite Christmas treat.
- I have a guess, but it's just a guess.
- Alright.
- Do you know your answer?
- Yeah.
Okay, Kendra's favorite
Christmas treat is her
brown sugar cookies with
pretty frosting on top.
- That's a really good answer.
It's not the one I had in
my brain, but I think your
answer might be more right than my answer.
- Just like O Come All Ye Faithful.
- No, that one you were just wrong on.
So, umm, I was gonna say pumpkin cake.
Okay my guess, but then
I went with pumpkin roll.
- You know, I just don't
associate pumpkin roll
with Christmas though.
- What is wrong with you?!?
- My favorite Christmas
treat or candy is divinity.
- What?!?
- Okay, so my grandpa,
who recently passed away,
would make it every year
and we used to have a
Christmas Eve party with
that side of the family
and he would bring the
divinity and I just love it.
- Favorite Christmas tradition.
Ready to see yours?
- Yeah.
- 12 Days of Christmas.
- It's true and my...
- Hands-Down I got it! Whoo!
- Yeah in my family we
would pick a family that was
either a family we were
wanting to get to know better
or a family that was in need
and we would drop something
off at their door 12 nights
before Christmas every night.
And we would knock and run
and try not to get caught.
- Okay let me see what yours is.
- I just put going one at a
time to the Christmas tree.
In her family they would line
up in a line and they would
each kid by age order
would go and see Christmas.
- So it's funny, I don't even
think of that as a Christmas
tradition, because that's
just the way you do Christmas.
Anyway, okay, favorite Christmas
tradition, we go caroling
in the back of a pickup
truck around just like the
neighborhood and we're all
snuggled in blankets in
the back of the truck, I love that one.
So, I think there's a
clear winner, look I won.
- Good job.
- Ah, I won!

Christmas favorites,

- Goodnight.
