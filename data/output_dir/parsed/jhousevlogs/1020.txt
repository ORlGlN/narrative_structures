- Hi, guys.
This is Kendra from J House.
I'm here with another library haul.
This one's a fall haul.
Oh, so festive.
I realize this is more
of a pick of the stack
set up that I've got going
on rather than library haul
because I'm showing you our favorite books
from the library, not just
everything that we brought home.
So let's get to it.
This is called Sophie's Squash,
and it is the story of a little girl
that falls in love with
this little squash.
Essentially it's her little baby doll
and she takes care of it, and takes it
everywhere with her,
and she just adores it.
I mean to see a little
girl playing with a squash,
it's just beautiful to
see her imaginations.
It makes me want to get out a potato
and hand it to my kids and see if they
will enjoy playing with it.
- It was snowing
and it growed a big, big, big bush!
And it had two squashes, see?
- Let me see.
Anyway, the next one is The Ugly Pumpkin
by Dave Horowitz, and this is the story
of a pumpkin that is
sitting in the pumpkin patch
and nobody will choose him
and he feels different and weird.
It's an Ugly Duckling story essentially
because at the end of the story,
he realizes that he's not an
ugly pumpkin, he's a squash.
So I guess it's actually kind
of a gearing from Halloween
to Thanksgiving book.
It's a nice crossover one for that.
This is Fletcher and the Falling Leaves
by Julia Rawlinson, and
it's the sweet story
of a little fox, who
it's his first winter,
and his favorite tree
seems to be getting sick,
and the leaves are changing color,
and they're falling off,
and he tries to save
the leaves and hold them on tight,
and he learns about fall and what it is.
- But the wolf said, "Don't
worry, I'll catch you."
-  Aw, the wolf said,
"Don't worry, I'll catch you?"
- Yeah, and the different
one's changing different colors
and they did it super colors
and this how it did it.
- The other one that I have about leaves
is called The Little Yellow
Leaf by Carin Berger.
So this is the story of a last leaf.
It's a tree that's standing there
and it's got one little leaf hanging on
and it doesn't want to go,
it's not ready to fall off
and have it be wintertime yet.
And what I loved about these leaf books
is that they inspire so many activities.
We went out and we did a leaf hunt,
and we did leaf rubbings,
and we made a leaf collage,
and we were driving along in the car
and we would look at the
trees, and we would notice
how many leaves were left.
There was one particular
tree that only had
a few leaves left on it,
and Elise squeezed my arm
and said, "Look, mom, that little leaf
"doesn't want to let go yet,"
and I thought that was so sweet.
Another fall theme that
I really enjoy is apples.
So we have The Apple Pie that
Papa Baked by Lauren Thompson,
and it is a very fun repeating text.
"This is the pie, warm and
sweet, that Papa baked.
"These are the apples, juicy and red,
"that went in the pie, warm
and sweet, that Papa baked."
It's the story of
recognizing kind of where
things come from.
Your apple pie is warm and delicious
because it came from the apples,
and the apples came from the tree,
and the tree grew because of the roots,
and the roots grew because of the sun.
Another apple book that
my kids really like,
it's oddly simple, but my kids love it.
So it's Apple Farmer Annie
by Monica Wellington.
- This is applesauce.
-  Woah.
- And she's busy making it
and that's the apple pie.
- My boy Isaac loves football,
so we have The Family Huddle.
It's by Peyton Manning, Eli
Manning, and Archie Manning.
If you have a child that's into football,
it's definitely a must-read.
- I like that it has my
favorite football player,
Peyton Manning.
-  This is your favorite part?
- This page.
-  Why?
- Because they score a touchdown.
- And the last book that
I just couldn't leave out
is not a seasonal book at all.
This is called The Looking Book
and you guys need to check it out.
Is the story of some
boys that did not want
to go outside and play.
I'm sure all of us moms can relate.
"Turn off that TV, go outside and play."
And so to solve the
problem of them not wanting
to go outside, she gives them lookers.
See that?
Special glasses that
they can use to go out
and see the world with.
With the glasses on, all of a sudden,
the world is interesting and they discover
all sorts of fun things outside,
and I just love that it was a good example
of getting kids into
nature and helping them
notice things that they
didn't notice before.
I keep meaning to go to the
Dollar Store or somewhere
and get some glasses like that,
and give the kids the
glasses, and read this book.
That would be a great activity.
You should do it.
So there we have it: our library haul.
Coming up we have the Thanksgiving haul
and I'm super excited.
I've been getting the
books on hold this week,
and so I've been looking through them.
Thanksgiving is my
absolute favorite holiday,
and I just love Thanksgiving books,
especially Thanksgiving picture books.
There's some real winners in there
that I'm gonna tell you
guys about next week,
and then you have to put on hold
and take them home and
read them to your children
because it is just magical.
