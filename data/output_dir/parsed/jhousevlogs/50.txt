- You wanna make something amazing?
-  Isn't it crazy soft?
Did you make a hammock?
- Yeah.
(lighthearted music)
-  It's really fun.
It's this amazing fort.
-  Mango tart for dessert.
(lighthearted music)
- So in the mornings we've
been having our kids do
a gratitude journal
before they eat breakfast
and I've decided recently
to do the same thing.
And I'm sure you've noticed
every morning that I'm like
showing the sunrise out here, but
I'm just so grateful for that.
Like, it's amazing how much peace and joy
it's bringing me and being here right now,
I'm just taking the time
every morning to watch it.
And same thing with the sunset.
It's just a really
beautiful and amazing thing
that I'm grateful for.
I would love to hear in the
comments some of the things
that you are grateful for.
- Bag, clothes,
planes,
curtains, baby.
That's what I'm grateful for.
I wanna test out my workout clothes,
so we are going on a run.
-  We're gonna do a whole workout.
- Yeah.
(energetic music)
(laughing)
(energetic music)
-  Work it!
Push it!
Running uphill is such a good workout.
So what did you think of running hills?
- It's fun,
and
tiring.
-  It's hard work, huh?
- Yeah! You can get up!
You can get up!
-  This is Elise's
first time climbing up
all by herself.
Good job big girl.
- So you can learn all the skills.
Like if you don't wanna
get poked in all the
prickly stuff, you can go over them.
-  All right, who
wants to go somewhere awesome?
- Me!
- Me!
-  Okay, let's go!
(lighthearted music)
- So today we're headed
to the Children's Museum
in San Diego.
We love visiting new Children's Museums.
They're always so interactive,
and just really great
for all the ages of our kids.
(lighthearted music)
Whoa!
-  Do you see that?
-  That thing is floating!
-  Is it helium?
-  It's a balloon sculpture.
I don't think it's helium.
(lighthearted music)
-  Let's see how fast you can go.
(chimes playing)
-  Laura's teaching Jenae.
There she is, she's following you!
There she is!
You did it!
I'm so proud of you!
(energetic music)
(lighthearted music)
-  Just ropes
everywhere, climbing,
and it's really fun.
It's this amazing fort.
(lighthearted music)
-  Okay, what's going on in here?
Sensory madness?
(laughing)
-  He's gone.
And he's back,
and he's gone.
(laughing)
-  Come here, I
wanna show you something.
It's a magic trick.
-  Where'd he go?
- It's a whole circle!
- I know.
- And here I am.
(fun music)
(excited yelling)
-  Ah!
Two of 'em!
Oh, it's Elise is in there!
Well apparently we could have
fun all day with just that.
(energetic music)
-  Hi Elise.
- Hi.
- Did you find a house?
(energetic music)
-  Did you make a hammock?
- Yeah.
-  I hope it holds you.
(energetic music)
Can I see what you drew?
Awesome.
- I think these are the best things
that I've drawn in a long time.
-  It's fun that
you can trace it, huh?
(classical music)
- Queen
Laura
of Kansas City.
(classical music)
- We got paint on our shoes.
-  Yeah, luckily
it's washable paint.
(energetic music)
- What are you making?
- Stuff.
-  What is the Raiders?
- Stuff?
- Pretty stuff.
(energetic music)
- Hi!
- You wanna make something amazing?
(energetic music)
-  Have you found yours?
- No.
-  All right now, look for it!
-  Is that mine?
-  Nope, that's Lisie's.
Do you see it?
Oooh, no one's in here except one person.
- Wow!
- So they have this sand box here that is
super fine sand that the kids can play in.
Isn't is crazy soft?
- Yeah.
(relaxing music)
- It's not real sand, but
it's softer than real sand.
-  I did it!
-  Nay-nay!
She loves it.
-  Yeah!
The colors change.
- Do you like my elevations?
- This is really cool sand.
I'm not a fan of sand,
but this is so soft.
- Whoa, that's a volcano.
- Uh-huh.
(lighthearted music)
- Thank you Miss Laura.
(lighthearted music)
- So after leaving the Children's Museum
we found a park across
the street that looks fun.
(lighthearted music)
(energetic music)
- Quack!
(energetic music)
- So our side of the freeway
is flowing great right now.
We're driving quickly.
The other side of the
freeway was all stopped up
and I always feel bad.
Like I feel guilty when that happens.
So we're headed to a fun place to eat.
It's called Urban Place.
I've actually been there before,
but the kids haven't,
so we're gonna let them try it.
(lighthearted music)
So we are sharing this
mango tart for dessert.
- What's a tart?
- A tart is this yummy,
thin pie crust right here.
- Mmm!
- And then it's got
mangoes and this cream.
-  Goodnight.
J House out.
-  All right, we're
jumping into the presents.
Is this the present you got for her?
- Thank you!
(giggles)
(gasps)
-  We've had a
frustrating little bit.
