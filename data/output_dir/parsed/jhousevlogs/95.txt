(drilling noise)
- Santa Clauses are going in.
-  This is for J House vlogs.
- This is awesome.
(upbeat music)
(upbeat music)
- The lake is perfectly still
this morning, like glass.
But we're saying goodbye.
So we've been doing
all those final packing
and getting everything ready to go.
We're heading to Kendra's brother's house
and then off to the airport.
(techno music)
- Something I love about
staying in rental places
is that you get to
experience what it would
be like to live somewhere else.
It's different than a hotel.
You get to be out in the
towns and in the area.
What would it be like to live up here?
And I think it would be amazing.
I'm gonna miss this drive, it is gorgeous.
Any last words?
- Goodbye Oregon.
(laughter)
-  Where do you think we've been?
- Goodbye Washington.
-  How's your breakfast Laura?
Well we packed up and
left the rental house.
So now we're joining my
family for breakfast.
The kids are still in their Christmas PJs.
Did you have a smoothie?
I see that, we found a straw for her
but first she was digging
in without a straw.
You can see how that worked out.
- She told me, it's
okay, it's a healthy one.
I'm really glad it's not a dying smoothie.
-  A dying smoothie?
- Like _.
-  What are you doing?
- Making cookies.
-  Christmas cookies.
(Christmas music)
Flour.
(Christmas music)
- I'm next.
-  Okay, let's flip it.
There we go.
-  Nice job Cubby.
-  This is for J House vlogs.
-  Is that a house?
Good job Jenna.
- Okay, can you put it on there.
Push on it, push it.
-  These are looking good.
Santa Clauses are going in.
- Caleb has had the chance
to work with Michael
on fixing a cabinet
that they're putting in.
Thus far it's been his
favorite part of the trip.
So they're finishing it up right now.
- Stick a screw driver
in there and lift up.
Can you do that around the edge?
Yeah, a little bit further
and it should come off here just a second.
-  Nailed it.
-  Yep, all
over the carpet, good.
So what you did is we're
just gonna rub it on
'cause we want it to look more like wood.
So this isn't the exactly right stain,
but it's good enough for what we need.
So what we're gonna do is
these little blocks right here,
they're gonna fit right
here to hold this up.
See how it's all wobbly.
Can you tell me when it's level.
-  It's off.
There.
-  That's level?
Can you make a circle right here
like the size for a target
for where I should drill?
(drilling noise)
Does that fit good or
do I need a bigger one?
- It fits good.
- Cool.
Does it wobble anymore buddy?
-  He fixed it.
How are the cookies?
- Good.
-  Say goodbye Cub.
-  Hugs,
hugs,
hugs.
Hey I'm staying with you.
- I'll see you next year Mom.
-  No, I'm staying with you.
- I'll see you in the summertime.
- The kids are pretty sad about leaving.
We've had more than one
request to stay here forever.
-  Goodbye Jenae.
Cousins.
- She's not letting go.
-  She's not letting go.
- We're going on a plane ticket for two.
She sits on my lap or I sit
on your lap, which way is it?
- I sit on your lap.
-  There we go, then she'd fit.
- Bye everybody.
- Bye.
-  There they are.
Our sending off crew.
Alright, climb in, we've
gotta buckle big girl.
Buckle up kiddos.
Bye.
She's waving.
It was sad to say goodbye to family,
but I have to document this happy moment.
Laura is almost asleep,
Jenae's quiet or asleep.
I don't know which one,
but I'm happy either way.
And the three big kids are actually
playing really nicely in the back.
They're not teasing each other
or whining or complaining.
Jeremy's behaving well.
- Yep.
(upbeat music)
- For the first time in
our life, we left early.
- Like super early.
- Because we didn't
want to run into traffic
and we wanted to make
sure we were on time.
And we ran into no traffic
so now we're just here super early.
- Take that world.
I think we should never do that again.
- Nevermind, we're
going to reform our ways
and go back to being late everywhere.
(upbeat music)
- We did it, phase one complete.
Now we're gonna jump on the
shuttle to go to the airport.
- Can Isaac sit by me?
-  You want Isaac to sit by you?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah sure.
We do the buddy system when we travel.
Jenae's my buddy
and Jeremy gets all the
luggage as his buddy.
- Hey Momma.
-  Yeah.
- Can me and Elise be buddies?
- Yep.
We made it on the shuttle
which is one small
step for most people,
but a giant step for us.
- A giant leap for seven in a family.
It's cold huh?
- It's cold.
It's cold.
- We decided to go to the bathroom
this time before going
through the security line.
Isn't that right?
It was a good idea.
(techno music)
We decided we wanna eat something
before we hop on the plane.
(techno music)
That's our plane coming in.
- The big one?
-  The big one.
- That one.
-  That's the one.
They're trying to check us all in.
It just takes more time
when you have seven people.
- This is cool.
-  It is cool.
- Can I tell you guys
the best part of my day?
-  What?
- I just checked the
weather in Kansas City
and the forecast is
sunny and gorgeous out.
It's gonna be in the 60s.
(upbeat music)
-  Look in there you guys.
Whoa.
-  Caleb, what
do you see in there?
All sorts of buttons.
(upbeat music)
Almost ready to go.
You ready to be home?
Are you looking forward to the flight?
- Looking forward to the flight.
-  Ready to be home
or looking forward to the flight?
- The flight.
-  Yeah, what are you
excited about for the flight.
- It's fun.
It's better than school.
- I must be the only one, but
I'm ready to just be at home.
Preferably on my bed.
- We're going super fast now.
- Laura made a friend.
Now it's our turn.
- We're going.
I know.
(upbeat music)
No way.
This is awesome.
(upbeat music)
-  Do you have a friend?
(cheery music)
- I'm coming.
-  You got the baby?
Say goodnight.
- See, see the little hand?
-  J House out.
I weight 189 pounds.
- That's a lot, that'd break a house.
(techno music)
-  She's _.
Come back.
(techno music)
