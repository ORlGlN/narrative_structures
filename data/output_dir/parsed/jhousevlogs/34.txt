- Well we are packed up
and getting ready to say goodbye.
-  What was one
of your favorite things
that happened here?
(bright music)
(out breath)
- Do you see that, that's my breath.
It is cold.
-  How does it
feel to be home, you guys?
- Good morning.
-  This is what we're
doing at 6:50 in the morning.
- Why not?
- Snuggle time.
- Stretching.
-  You guys, come
check out the sunrise,
it's amazing today.
- Whoa.
Oh my.
That is awesome.
(uptempo electronic music)
It's like the sun is
like, makes a volcanoes
inside of mountains.
- I'm walking backwards.
- You can walk backwards?
Ooh that's fancy.
Well I am sneaking in
one last morning walk
before we leave this morning.
I'm soaking up the last rays of sunshine.
And what's on my heart this morning
is I've been thinking
about how I've honestly
been super sad about leaving San Diego.
And yesterday, I realized
how much my attitude
was rubbing off on my kids.
And that is always a good reminder to me
that I need to change my attitude.
So I was thinking about it last night
and I want to focus on
gratitude and contentment.
Instead of being sad that we're leaving,
being grateful that we were able to come,
being content with the
experiences that we had.
And going home with gratitude
for our beautiful home
and our beautiful life
in Kansas City.
And all the wonderful
things that there are to do
in cold weather and with our
friends and family there,
and so that's my focus today,
is on gratitude and contentment
and hopefully, that can
rub off on my kids too.
(lively music)
Well we are packed up
and getting ready to say
goodbye to this beautiful house
that has been a house of so many memories
and so much joy and some stressful moments
and amazing views and sunsets
and good food and memories, so.
Goodbye beautiful little house.
- Bye.
- Ah.
=  This is where you
had your fourth birthday.
- Yeah.
-  And this is where you took
your first steps Janae.
(Janae vocalizing)
- And Lise's birthday.
- And Lise's birthday
and visits with grandparents.
So our last thing before
we load up the car
is to gather the family
and just pray in gratitude
for this amazing trip that we've had.
- So I want to just go over some of
our favorite memories
while we've been here.
What was one of your favorite
things that happened here?
- My birthday.
-  Your birthday?
- My birthday cake.
(bright music)
-  It's your birthday.
- Yay.
-  Our little mermaid.
-  You could probably
disappear inside that thing.
(laughing)
- Thank you.
(bright music)
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
- Renting bikes and Legoland.
- It's a little teensy tiny.
(upbeat music)
(yelling)
(laughing)
(laughing)
(yelling)
-  Woo hoo!
- My birthday of course.
Getting ice cream cones.
(bright music)
(gasps)
A camera!
-  Yep.
- Clip on earrings?
Thank you.
- You can share 'em with me.
-  What flavor did you do?
- Lime creme.
- So I think one of my favorite things
was just the normal life
things we were able to do.
We were able to go to church here,
we were able to get flu shots,
we were able to play around,
climb the tree,
play in the backyard,
I loved those moments.
- Climbing the tree with Isaac and Elise.
(soaring music)
It's awesome up here.
-  Remember do the pose.
- Oh.
- V.
-  Good job buddy.
- I think my favorite
were the hikes we went on.
(lively rock music)
-  What do you think Caleb?
Are we gonna fit through?
(in high voice) I liked the ocean--
-  And the dogs.
-  And playing on the beach.
-  And walking.
(waves rolling)
- Woo!
-  I think she's a little nervous.
-  She does
not know what to think.
(Kendra laughing)
What is this?
(uptempo electronic music)
And so it begins.
♪ Tomorrow I love ya tomorrow ♪
♪ You're only a day away ♪
- I wish we could skip
the rest of the day.
(uptempo electronic music)
-  Jeremy's making sure
we didn't leave anything behind.
- Ooh, a binky.
-  Ooh we need that.
- Good find.
Minnie Mouse.
(Kendra laughs)
-  And we're off.
(lively tropical music)
(Janae laughing)
- It's a longer wait than I expected,
but I think we'll still make our flight.
- So we are finally on the plane.
You're on a plane.
-  She likes sitting on the seat,
looking like a big girl.
-  Hey Laura,
where are we heading?
- Kansas City.
-  Did you hear what
the temperature is there?
- I think it was like 18 Fahrenheit.
-  From 70 degrees to 18 degrees.
- Is it warm?
-  That's cold.
- Oh.
-  Yeah.
(laughing)
- You laugh like me.
Yeah, oh my gosh.
- Ahhh.
She's tired.
Hopefully she naps.
She napped on the way out here real well.
Elise is reading the
safety information card.
I'm proud of her.
- Look at all those cars.
- It's gonna start.
(lively music)
- It's 20 degrees at home.
(Announcement on PA)
-  Why is it white?
- Snow.
-  It's snow.
There's snow down there.
(gentle music)
- That part was cold.
- I know.
(out breath)
- Do you see that, that's my breath.
It's cold.
Well that was honestly
probably one of Janae's hardest flights.
She's just getting big enough
that she doesn't want to sit still,
she wants to get down and she can't.
She was pretty fussy.
But we made it and we're here
and I'm excited to get
home and get unpacked
and settled in and see
our friends and family.
Nae Nae's on the look out.
Uncle Brent is coming to pick us up
from the airport.
- I got it all.
-  We've got it all.
Here it is.
♪ I just stick out my
chin and grin and say ♪
♪ The sun will come out tomorrow ♪
Same song, different state,
different car, same kids.
(lively music)
-  Alright you
guys, unpack your backpacks.
And we gotta get ready,
you have school tomorrow.
- Yay.
My make-up!
-  Is your make-up here?
-  Uh-huh.
-  How does it
feel to be home, you guys?
- I like it.
- My room is just like a new place
I've never been before,
but I've been in it a thousand times.
- Chi Chi!
I'm glad you're here,
I'm glad you're safe.
Soon it will be safe and not lost.
-  Goodnight, J House out.
♪ Try to make friends ♪
(drumming)
(upbeat music)
-  Thanks for helping Elise.
How's it going dude?
