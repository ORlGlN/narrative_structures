- We've been having babies for 10 years
- That's true.
- By the way.
- Like we've had someone in diapers
- We were talking about that.
- For 10 years.
- It's been a decade.
(Upbeat music)
(Buzzing)
- What are you guys doing?
(Guitar)
- So I'm having some spinach
and eggs for breakfast.
- And I am on day five
of my juice cleanse.
- It's the last egg.
- And I want eggs but I'm going to hold
out strong and finish
off and then tomorrow
I will eat more normal food.
As a side note though, I'm about to lose
10 pounds, we'll see, I have one
and a half more pounds to go.
- I just did three days of the cleanse
and so yesterday was my first day back
to kind of normal food
and I've been really
appreciating how my body feels.
I did this cleanse because I wanted
to kind of reset my taste buds
so I didn't crave junk all the time.
And I am craving healthier foods
and healthier foods are tasting
sweeter and better to
me, which is awesome.
I have a terrible sweet tooth,
I always want sweets, and I've gone
four days now without any sugar,
and so, that's a big triumph for me.
So, it's been a good experience.
- (Jeremy) Sweet NayNay wants to play.
- She's doing it.
(Violin music)
- (Jeremy) You did it!
You're a violinist! Okay, Isaac's turn.
She likes watching Isaac play.
(Violin music)
- Too long.
Too long.
- Oh look, castle, so when the castle
is complete, look what letters you see
over here, big C, little C.
- I've been feeling a little bit
lost in life lately,
like, just a little bit
drifting, like I don't know exactly
what my purpose is or kind of what
some of my next steps are
with different things.
And that's always a great
reminder when I have that feeling,
that I need to be spending
more time with God
and so this morning, I
got to spend some time
reading in the Scriptures and praying
before taking care of the kids,
Jeremy gifted me that moment.
I put in ear plugs and just really
tried to focus on that and I feel better.
- Cut across
- (Jeremy) what are you guys working on?
- We're making a fake country.
- (Jeremy)Sounds, normal,
what's the name of your fake country?
- We don't know yet.
- Saturday City.
- No, that's just the main city.
(laugh)
We're going to have football teams in it.
Okay, Caleb, that's the shape.
- Looks kind of like.
- She wants to play basketball.
She doesn't know what's going on.
(laughs)
- She saw me playing and she
was like, "I want the ball".
Okay, watch, NayNay.
- She wants the ball, she doesn't want
to let go of the ball, look at that.
- She sees, she's like "I want to shoot".
(baby talk)
- Get me up there.
Come on. Come on.
So, yeah, the other thing she loves
is the kids made this as a little
like hideout, play place for her.
Woo.
- She wants to see the
snake I put up there.
- A snake hanging from
the rafters, awesome.
(laughing)
- Good one NayNay.
So, I'm headed to the gym this morning
to work out with my friend,
which I love doing, but
I'm looking all over
my house for my shoes,
looking, looking, looking,
my kids are all loaded up in the car,
'cause they're coming with me, finally,
I go out there to tell them
"sorry, I can not find my shoes"
guess where my shoes were, in the car.
(upbeat music)
- Post work out smoothie time.
(upbeat music)
- (Jeremy) I love your creativity.
- Thanks. I'm done. Ta da.
- (Jeremy) A pineapple.
- Yup.
- (Jeremy) We're doing
frozen pizza for lunch
and she took it and
- I randomly asked dad if I
could have a circle cardboard.
- (Jeremy) Yeah, that went with the pizza.
That's a great idea.
- And I cut it up and ta da!
- I'm really excited because
I'm heading right now
to get my hair cut and it is long overdue.
I haven't had my hair trimmed or anything
for a while and so I'm just excited
to have it feel healthy and kind of
just fresh and taken care of.
I haven't decided how
much I want to cut off.
I might cut off just like
some, I might cut off more,
I don't know, we'll see.
So, I didn't do my hair
today, so, I know it looks
kind of terrible in the before
but this is how long it is.
- They're taking all my string.
We're making a pattern.
- (Jeremy) A pattern?
- Isaac, help me, pull this way.
- (Jeremy) What are you guys doing?
- We're having fun.
(upbeat music)
- I feel like she worked
her magic with the curls
but this is what it looks like,
so, it's still long but
it's more manageable.
What do you guys think?
(All answering at once)
It's somewhat shorter but not drastic,
like, I still have long hair.
- (Jeremy) It looks good.
- It's because she
curled it, she has magic,
she knows how to curl hair just right.
So, I did a before, here's the after,
which, obviously my
hair is done this time,
so, it's not a fair comparison,
but I got 7 inches cut off.
While Jeremy has the
big kids out shopping,
Caleb wanted to stay home with
the little girls and play.
What are you guys playing?
- Magnets!
(baby talk)
- Yeah, that one's green.
(baby talk)
- It's a green square. It's pretty cool.
(baby talk)
- I know, another green one.
- I made a pizza.
- Ooh, a pizza, what kind of pizza is it?
- Marshmellow.
- A marshmellow pizza?
Caleb, what are you building?
- A house.
- A house.
(upbeat music)
- Whoa, that's a blue square.
So, these three are starting
to play together sometimes.
And for the most part, it goes okay.
Then we have some, like, sharing,
you know, grumpy issues
but it's really fun
for me to see them playing together.
(rock music)
- We're getting new shoes because
- (Jeremy) That's a hole.
- I can feel the carpet, concrete, tile.
- (Jeremy) And yours don't
fit you anymore, huh,
just a little too small.
- Yeah.
- (Jeremy) Alright.
(rock music)
- Now these, are pretty
but they're a bit too big.
- (Jeremy) You gotta find em in your size.
(rock music)
- Okay, so, this toy is called Playmags
and we really like them,
we got them for Christmas,
like as a big family gift for Christmas.
I love these toys because all of the kids,
all the different ages of
my kids, play with them.
And the magnets are inside of the plastic,
and so they're safe.
- NayNay is forcing our
rule, if you get something,
I have to put it back.
- Yep. So, since I told you
guys how well they were playing,
there's been several crying episodes,
it's hard to work with Janay
because she'll just take apart
what you're building
without her knowing it,
I mean, she's not doing it on purpose.
And then the other two
have to, you know, share.
So, lots of learning going on,
sometimes it's painful to learn stuff.
(upbeat music)
- I tried on size two and size three.
Size three feels a lot better.
- (Jeremy) Cool, well,
they'll last longer too.
You grow, which you probably will.
So, with Isaac's sports playing,
he just beats up shoes.
(upbeat music)
- This is it right here,
Revolution 4, try em on.
What do you think, do they
fit or are they too tight?
- Tight.
- Do you want to try a size two?
- I feel taller.
- Alright, let's pack it up and go home.
So, Kendra came in here with Janay,
the other day and she said Janay was just
freaking out about all the shoes.
Get back on those old shoes,
let's go buy these ones.
So, they have a huge deal right now too
where it's buy one, get
the other one half off,
or something like that,
so, we like to save money.
- So, it's been a long time
since I've cut the boys' hair.
I used to cut it all the time
but they've been going to
a hair place for a while.
We don't have time today for that
and their hair is driving me crazy,
I don't know if it's hitting home
with my own hair cut but
I'm like "oh my goodness"
their hair is so long, they need it cut
so, I got out the clippers,
we'll see how this goes.
- Ready for this magic?
- Yeah.
- Alright, you gotta hold still.
(laughs)
- Some hair!
- (Jeremy) You guys have so much hair.
- They do have so much hair.
- More hair! It's like
raining hair. Literally.
- Good job being still.
(laughs)
- (Jeremy) That's pretty good.
- I think you're good, high five.
My second victim, muahahaha, you nervous?
- A little.
- You have thick hair, dude.
- For some reason my hair
grows really fast. Hey!
- There's some hair.
It's funny, I always
think of Caleb as blondish
and Isaac as having darker hair
but I think Caleb's hair is
just as dark as Isaac's now.
- (Jeremy) It's the same.
- It used to not be.
Crazy how long your hair was.
(rock music)
- (Jeremy) Do not laugh.
- That's like Isaac's special talent.
(Jeremy laughing)
- (Jeremy) Do you remember
the try not to laugh challenge
where you started laughing every
single time we did anything
- Ready to make Isaac laugh?
- Knock Knock. Interrupting chicken.
(laughing)
- You look like someone different.
- (Jeremy) Haircuts can do that.
- So, Isaac's hair is a lot thicker
and it's proving to be a little
bit of a different beast.
- (Jeremy) He is a beast, a hairy beast,
with a hairy back, gross.
(Isaac laughs)
- So, you might be wondering,
since I cut the boy's hair,
why I don't also cut Jeremy's hair?
So, I tried that one time in college
and we decided that marital bliss
was more important than the
money we saved cutting his hair.
Meaning, it didn't go well.
- (Jeremy) Gotta sweep you off, buddy.
(Kendra making noises)
(Jeremy laughing)
- Turn around.
Go take a shower, good job, buddy.
No wonder I cut these
boys' needed a haircut.
(playful music)
- (Jeremy) How's it feel
playing in your new shoes, guys?
- Awesome. I can jump way better.
- (Jeremy) Your haircuts look great.
- (Isaac) Thanks.
- (Jeremy) Sometimes, I have to stop
and ask, how did I get this
supermodel to marry me?
- And it's the few times when my hair
and make up's done at the same time.
(Jeremy laughs)
- (Jeremy) We've been
having babies for 10 years.
- That's true.
- (Jeremy) By the way. Like,
we've had someone in diapers
- We were talking about that.
- (Jeremy) for ten years.
- Its been a decade of
awesomeness and tiredness.
We're boiling some potatoes for dinner.
- (Jeremy) Whoa.
- And then
- (Jeremy) Not me 'cause it's my last day
of the cleanse still,
so, I've been watching
the kids and family eat and the
ending of the juice cleanse,
I'm super excited to be
moving back on to normal food.
- He's been eating salads every day.
One salad, one salad.
- Here's our simple dinner tonight,
it's just baked potatoes
with cottage cheese,
strawberries, carrots, and bread.
(light music)
- I've now finished the
last juice of my cleanse.
J-House out.
- This is so cool!
(playful music)
- He's making a baby gate.
