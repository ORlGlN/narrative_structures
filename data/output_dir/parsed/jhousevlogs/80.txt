- I turned the car off
without putting it in park.
The car started to roll
and I was out of the car.
(festive music)
- This girl just wrote her name
for the first time ever.
I go and I put the tape
in the refrigerator.
I'm losing my mind just a little bit.
Well poor Caleb and
Laura still have fevers.
They are low grade fevers
and today they were acting just fine,
but now this evening, I can
definitely see it in them more.
Laura's been wanting to be held a lot
so I've been cuddling her
for a lot of the afternoon,
and I can just see it in their eyes,
they're just not feeling good,
so I've put on a show
and they are relaxing.
(enchanting music)
Hopefully they get better soon,
because we were sick last Christmas
and we have a lot of
plans we're still wanting
to get done before Christmas.
And hopefully, you and Isaac and Elise
and Mom and Dad stay healthy.
(gentle guitar music)
- Well I'm loving the sound
of all the birds out here
and watching the squirrels run by.
Unfortunately we had a ton of plans today,
of fun stuff and Caleb and Laura
both have a fever, so
we're adjusting our plans.
Some things we still have to do,
we'll just have to do them without them.
(gentle guitar music)
How are you feelin' this morning bud?
- Sick.
-  I'm sorry buddy.
I sure love you.
- I love you too.
-  Yeah like Laura actually
got unmatching socks past Mom.
- Since I don't have
the match to this one,
I lost it.
-  Oh so you're just gonna wear
unmatching ones today?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah Laura,
she woke up acting normal,
but her temperature's
up above 100 degrees.
- So I have a fever.
-  She has a fever.

- The best part of puzzles.
So we wanted to make sure our kids knew
how to read these kinds of clocks,
so we got one for each of their rooms
and Cubby and some of the kids
are gonna help me put it up.
Okay bud, grab the stud finder.
Mom wants it on this wall right here.
So see if there's any studs over here.
(buzzing)
Right there?
- Uh-huh.
-  So we know
there is a board right here
on the wall.
We can put a nail there.
So yeah, we can put a nail
there and it will be sturdy.
So Isaac marked the wall.
Nail it in Cub.
(hammering)
Alright oh that's good, perfect.
Alright, now hang it up.
- Right there?
- Yep.
-  Good job.
Alright, how does that look?
Alright, now in your room.
(buzzing)
- Right here?
- There we go.
(hammering)
- I like that when we're in our desk,
we can just say like what time is it,
and then just look backwards and
there it is.
- Benjamin Rabbit found it then,
just outside the fox's den.
Look he cried, see the tree I found.
With that, he called his family 'round.
The kids are working on an art project.
We are using oil pastels
on black construction paper.
And they're doing Christmas
trees and Christmas lights
and I just love how vibrant
the oil pastels show up
on the black construction paper.
So Caleb's using a little stencil.
So Caleb you just do
around the outside of it,
so you can kind of see it glow.
Hey Laura, what are you coloring?
- You'll see when I'm done.
-  Okay.
Isaac, what are you working on?
- I'm making a Christmas tree.
-  Lise, what are you working on?
- Um lights, I'm gonna have it like
kind of in a circle basically.
-  Nice.
- I haven't really decided yet.
- Yeah, they're called oil pastels.
They're kind of like crayons,
but they feel so smooth, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Almost like markers or paint.
So smooth, huh?
Here's Isaac's Christmas tree.
Now you're using a different style
to make a Christmas tree.
Caleb, that looks awesome.
Poor Lise and her glasses,
we've ordered the new ones.
We're just waiting for them to arrive.
So Elise drew a house with
Christmas lights on it.
- Uh-huh.
-  That is so fun.
That's the man on the moon.
I love it.
-  I made our house with lights.
-  Here's one I'm working on.
The wind is blowing the
tree, very creative.
I think I'm like doing
okay with the holidays
and all the business of it,
and then I go and put the
tape in the refrigerator.
Losing my mind just a little bit.
(playful music)
For lunch today, we're gonna
make Christmas tree rolls,
which is just rolls filled
with cheese and turkey,
I think we're gonna put in it
and then baked in the
shape of a Christmas tree.
I've been trying hard this year
to find festive holiday foods
that aren't just desserts.
That way it can feel more festive,
without us eating desserts constantly.
Well I did it,
it successfully looks kind of like
the picture that I saw on Pinterest.
- Presenting the amazing Christmas tree.
-  Oh thanks Cubby.
Alright so these are
cheese and turkey filled
and then I just brushed them with butter
and Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese.
Okay, let's hope it
comes out looking okay.
Well the Christmas tree
took a little bit longer
than I expected to make,
because I ended up holding Janae
most of the time I was doing it
and one-handed, everything
just goes slower.
Alright, well the Christmas tree rolls
are all ready to go.
(bluesy upbeat music)
- Today Isaac and Elise are helping me
with Meals on Wheels.
It's where you take food
to people in the community
who are needing support, needing help.
We used to actually do a
route every single week,
a couple years ago and
some of those early vlogs
are some of my favorites.
Do you know why we're
bringing food to some people?
- Because they don't have enough money
to buy some food at stores
and it's a lot of money.
-  Mmm-hmm, so
do we get to help them
by bringing them some food?
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmmm.
-  Do you guys
like taking people food
who need it?
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.
-  Okay who wants
to carry the food in?
- Me.
- Me!
-  You guys ready?
- No me!
- We're all gonna do it.
Let's all go in and take the food okay?
(uptempo music)
So I just did a very scary thing.
The car was on and the keys were running
and I was making sure we
found the right place.
And we're on this big hill right here,
and I turned the car off
without putting it in park
and the car started to roll
and I was out of the car.
I jumped in, put the brakes on,
the adrenaline is pumping,
so that was just a little
bit scary, but we're okay.
(bright music)
So what did you guys think
of doing Meals on Wheels?
- I liked it.
- I liked it.
- I liked it too.
-  What did you like about it?
- It's just fun to deliver and--
- Thanks for helping me guys.
So this last house we delivered to
is out on a dirt road
and it's pretty far out of town.
I grew up in the big city but then my mom
married a rancher and
we lived on a dirt road,
so for the poll question today,
do you live off of a dirt road?
Let us know in the poll.
- This girl just wrote her name
for the first time ever.
What's it say Laura?
- L-A-U-R-A.
- You are a speller.
- Yes.
- So she's been writing
L-A L-A on everything
and today we taught here the U and the R,
and then it ends with what?
- R.
- Another A.
- Another A.
- I'm so proud of her, this is so awesome.
Can you do it again?
-  L-A-
U-R-,
-  Yes?
-  skinny A.
- Good job.
You did it.
-  So proud of you.
- It was so fun watching
her earlier today,
because she was writing
L-A L-A on everything,
and then I taught her the U,
and she did it for the first time
and her face just like lit up,
she's like I did it.
So it's been fun to
watch her learning today.
-  Especially when
she's not feeling good.
- Yeah.
I just took her temperature
and she still has a fever.
It's 100.1.
(lively music)
- Every year Aunt Michelle, who does piano
with the kids sets up
a little concert here
at the retirement home.
It's a great tradition
and Caleb was so bummed,
this was gonna be his first time
to get to play the piano in a recital.
And he's missing it, he's really sad.
