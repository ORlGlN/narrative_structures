-  So how do you
feel about the dentist
lookin' at your teeth?
- Scared.
- Gets a little bit
nervous making it looks
under construction.
- Can you open your mouth?
(upbeat music)
(tranquil music)
- The leaves are falling.
-  You see the
leaves falling out there?
- Yeah.
-  Crazy huh?
- Yeah 'cause it's
winter!
-  Almost, it's fall.
- Fall!
- We're excited to have Osmo
sponsoring our video today.
And we're even more excited to share Osmo
with our kids,
Here it is.
So this guy is called Mo the Monster.
He's a fuzzy, orange creature.
- Is he gonna eat me?
- He's not gonna eat you.
This is a game.
Let's see what's inside.
- That's the eraser?
- Yep.
It's also a bag.
- Cool.
- You guys wanna go check it out?
-  Yeah!
- Should we set it up at the table?
-  Yeah!
- And you set it up
and it works with
iPads, or iPhones.
(upbeat music)
Click on the Osmo Monster App.
Caleb, you wanna play for us?
- Hello new friend, I'm Mo.
What's your name?
- Caleb.
- Isaac.
- Elise.
-  Pleased to meet you.
- Laura.
(laughing)
- To land of imagination.
(triumphant music)
To create something here,
you need to draw something down there.
Let's give it a try.
Draw a balloon.
Draw it down there, then
tap here when it's ready.
Okay.
Now to pull it in.
Stand back and cross your fingers.
- Look!
- That's my
actual balloon.
- Ah, it worked.
(laughing)
- It was red!
Oh my!
- We can put on a magic show.
- The magic!
- Magic.
- Do you guys wanna do the magic show?
So Caleb is drawing our
stage for the magic show.
- A magnificent stage.
(gasping)
On with the show!
- That's your stage!
- I think I should've drawed it bigger.
-  Oh no, that's perfect.
And I love that you got
some marker on your cheek.
- Let's do the show together.
-  So erase the
stage and draw a wand.
(screaming)
- Ha!
- Lets make the burger.
Perfect.
- Mm, I can't wait for later.
(slurping)
This is so cool.
Watch this mom.
- I'm never sure what's on the other side.
- A cauldron!
- Let's see what's
inside this time.
-  Those are your drawings buddy.
You drew all those things.
- Ta-da!
Good show!
- So guys that was the magic show.
But there's actually 10 different games
we can play with this.
- Wow.
- That's cool.
- You guys wanna try more of 'em?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- So the Masterpiece
App has a cool feature
where you can take
pictures of toys or items
and then it puts it into drawing form
so you can color it in.
There you go.
- Wow.
(tranquil music)
-  You did amazing.
- I love that Osmo has different games
at different levels.
So that all my kids can enjoy it.
(upbeat music)
- So I wanted Isaac to
try the Newton games
because it combines physics
with problem solving.
So Isaac has to draw the lines
that will make these darts hit the balls.
There you go!
He got it!
- I love this.
- What does this thing do?
- It's awesome.
-  It's physics.
- It's so amazing.
- Thank you to Osmo for
sponsoring our video today.
If you'd like to buy Monster,
you can get it at playosmo.com, Target,
Amazon and Best Buy.
And there's information at the link
in the description box below.
(tranquil music)
Well this morning, the kids are claiming
that they're hearing Janae saying dada.
So, she might be saying dada and mama.
I just can't believe it.
She's growing up so quick
and I know that's like cliche to say that
but I really feel like
she's growing up faster
than our other kids.
- She's learning from our example.
-  You think so?
You think that's why Janae
is learning so quick?
- Yeah.
- I think Naenae's gonna
actually be walking
about at the time when she turns one.
-  You think so?
- Maybe even at like 11 months.
- Maybe just one more
month, she could do it.
- Poll question.
When will Janae start walking?
-  Right now she's--
- So we'll do like--
at eight months.
- You know.
Nine months, 10 months,
11 months, 12 months.
- Now important data for this question.
All of our kids have been late walkers.
Laura was our earliest walker
and I think she was 14 months old.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
We do have videos of that.
But Caleb was 15 months
and Isaac and Elise
were both 16 or 17 months.
So this is way early for our family.
Well now we're on our way to the dentist
for the kids' checkup.
Hopefully there's no cavities.
(tranquil music)
- Whoa!
It's a little bit nervous making it looks
under construction.
-  Come on buddy.
You're gonna take the stairs?
- Caleb and I are gonna take the stairs.
-  They're a
little nervous about this.
- Two?
- Yeah.
- Oh maybe they were just
moving something really big
and they wanted to protect the sides.
(tranquil music)
- I lost my front tooth.
- I see that,
that's pretty cool, huh.
- And another loose tooth.
-  What flavor
did you go with Caleb?
- Bubblegum.
- Bubblegum.
How 'bout you Laura, what flavor?
- Bubblegum.
- I chose grape.
-  Grape?
Let's see what you think of it.
- 
Have you tried it before?
- Yeah.
I always do cookie dough,
grape or birthday cake.
-  Birthday cake.
The grape's the best though I think too.
(upbeat music)
-  So birthday cake,
strawberry, watermelon,
grape, bubblegum and mint.
- Grape.
-  That's the
kind Isaac went with.
- Really?
-  Yep.
-  Somebody
dressed your socks today.
-  Yeah your
socks aren't matching.
What does it taste like Laura?
(mumbles)
(laughing)
- I'm filling out paperwork for every kid.
It takes a while.
-  Yeah it'd be nice if they had
a copy and paste button.
- Yes.
I'm just really grateful
the kids are healthy,
Makes it easier.
And this little girl has no teeth.
-  We think she's teething though.
- Somethin's goin' on.
(upbeat music)
- Okay close.
- Our kids like going to the dentist
and I think it's 'cause
they get to watch cartoons.
(upbeat music)
-  You did great.
-  So how do you
feel about the dentist
looking at your teeth?
- Scared.
-  What are you scared of?
- I don't want them to
pull out this tooth.
-  You don't want
'em to pull your teeth out?
-  He's not gonna
pull any of your teeth out.
He just pulled out Elise's tooth last time
'cause it was wiggly.
But your teeth aren't wiggly yet.
So he's not gonna pull
out any of your teeth.
(machine beeping)
- Can you bite down on
this yellow right here?
There's a little indention,
can you put your teeth
right in that indention in the yellow?
(upbeat music)
- That's your skeleton.
- Are these just
all of the gums?
- Yeah.
These are teeth that you're
gonna get when you're 12.
These teeth right here
are gonna get loose,
and those teeth--
- And those are my
permanent.
- Yep those are
your permanent.
- So which one's
closest to being a loose tooth?
- Probably these top ones right here.
You see that?
It looks like they're about
to fall out on the X-Ray.
- So these ones?
- Mhm.
(laughing)
- It's so cool that--
- It's pretty cool
isn't it?
-  Tell her what to do.
- Lay down and open your mouth.
-  Have you ever
smelt gross breath before?
No?
Well that's good.
I am so glad.
- I do my dads all the time.
- You do your dads--
- That dude has
gross breath.
- Does your dad
have gross breath sometimes?
(laughing)
Oh man.
What a bummer.
- In the morning.
- In the morning?
- It's called morning breath.
-  Morning breath.
Lots of people have morning breath,
especially kids.
All right, let's check out these
awesome teeth.
- And dads.
-  And dads.
Moms don't though.
Open really big.
Moms breath always smells like roses.
You don't have any sugar bugs,
(mumbles) yeah!
Can you open really big buddy?
I'm gonna check and see
what we've got here.
And you'll kinda feel it
click when it goes through.
- The day when it came out,
it was like bleeding.
- Oh whoa.
- But it wasn't coming out.
But then when dad wiggled it,
and then it came out.
I didn't want it to come out,
but I wanted it to come out.
-  Oh I understand.
It's like, ugh, this would
be so cool if it comes out
'cause the tooth fairy can come.
But will it hurt?
And you don't know.
- But it didn't hurt.
- It didn't hurt?
Oh, good.
And you're six, your
molars are poppin' through
down there too.
Are you excited for Thanks Giving?
Are you guys gonna travel
anywhere for Thanks Giving?
- Yes.
- Oh where are you
gonna go?
- Spoiler alert.
(upbeat music)
-  Sometimes you
get a whole bunch of plaque
and sometimes you don't have any.
- Laura's gonna show Janae how it's done.
-  You're gonna teach her?
- Here you go Naenae.
- You're gonna tell 'em
what you were for Halloween
and then you're gonna open your mouth
and then you get a token.
- I was Moana for Halloween.
-  Oh boy, I bet that was great!
Moana's so nice!
- Even I got makeup on.
- Yeah you had makeup
and everything?
- Even I got my hair curled.
-  Oh little miss,
you know that song?
- Even I got shampoo on.
-  Wow!
Do you know that song that Moana sings?
- Yeah.
-  Can you sing it for us?
Do you know it?
- I'm still practicing it.
-  Oh you're
still practicing that,
it's okay.
(laughing)
- Good job brave girl.
- Just like Moana.
Yeah, wow!
- Good job.
You can watch the show.
- I wonder if you
have the same number as Moana.
-  Yeah, let's see.
I wonder how many Moana has.
Do you wonder?
Let's see how many you have.
All right, open really big.
Good job.
Miss Laura, you have 20
teeth and they are beautiful.
High five.
- Good job Laura.
-  Way to overcome
your fears little miss.
That was awesome.
Five for five today!
- No cavities!
Extra tokens.
(upbeat music)
-  I got these two.
(gasping)
- A ring!
- Did you get a ring?
- I got a ring!
-  You got a ring.
- Go in the elevator.
- We're gonna see which one's faster,
the stairs or the elevator.
On your mark, get set, go!
-  Let's go fast Laura.
(dramatic music)
- Surprise!
(cheering)
-  It was faster.
- We got you.
-  The stairs were faster.
-  The boys are
working on the pinewood derby.
- But we initially had some sandpaper
that was like 400 grit.
It was pretty rough.
And Isaac thought we were done.
But what did we do since then?
- We went to a thousand then two thousand.
- So it's super, dee-duper smooth.
- It's like metal or, a car.
It feels amazing.
- A new car.
-  All right, good job.
- I have literally never
felt wood so smooth.
This thing is like, so soft.
I didn't know wood could even do this.
So I'm pretty impressed
and excited to see how
this turns out.
- That is so soft.
- Isn't it amazing?
- Can I?
-  Didn't your
brother do an awesome job?
She's so proud of you.
All right, dinner tonight
was a crock pot meal.
It's called a HuliHuli chicken.
And there's rice and veggies.
- Can I say it, HuliHuli chicken.
HuliHuli chicken.
- I like Janae's new bib!
-  You think
her new bib is so cute?
- HuliHuli chicken.
-  Isn't it fun to say?
- HuliHuli chicken.
- HuliHuli chicken.
- HuliHuli chicken, yay!
-  Somebody's got some energy.
(baby babble)
-  Yeah.
There's your water.
And Jeremy doesn't get to be
with us for dinner tonight.
He's working.
- Well I feel bad.
I was working late tonight.
I had some unexpected things come up
and I wasn't here to help
Kendra at all with dinner.
And with five little
kids, dinner by yourself,
is hard and it leaves a mess.
All of them are gymnastics now.
So I'm wanting to have them come home
to a clean house.
(upbeat music)
Sometimes mid-cleaning, I
need an ice cream break.
(upbeat music)
-  Goodnight, J House out.
-  Yeah!
- This is what I'm talking about.
Baby.
-  So much pumpkin spice here.
- Could we buy some?
- Never shop hungry.
Or you'll buy really yummy stuff.
Whoa, that is a huge nest.
Do you guys see this?
- You spent all my money.
(laughing)
