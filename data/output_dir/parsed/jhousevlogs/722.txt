good morning we are headed out on a
nature walk this morning and it's funny
the forecast today said windy and I was
like how is that a forecast but it is
actually windy out here I'm not sure if
you guys will be able to hear me very
well
so who may we're just at a nature
sanctuary and we're gonna enjoy the walk
and then I think what I do a park we're
meeting up with some friends which
always makes it more pleasant
look how big Laura is she's just running
on the path with the kids
and I'm just pushing an empty stroller
I assume though at some point Caleb or
Laura will want the stroller
they'll get tired out somebody loves
flowers
she keeps stopping and looking at all
the flowers
krei you see the Cree
what's in there this is a snake
here let's see it says it's a corn snake
you see the turtle so we brought the
kids to the park afterwards and it is
alright well we had a good time in the
park and we brought popcorn as a snack
which I don't usually bring but it was
just really easy like I just popped the
corn at home and I brought some cups and
the kids don't really liked it so I need
to remember to do that in the future so
when we get home from field trips I try
to have the kids do an entry in their
field trip journal and so this is what
the kids are doing today
Isaac decided to make a list of the
differences between frogs and toads and
check this out look at that froggy drew
way to go and this Elyse can we see your
page and Kalle needs your coloring and
stuff so here are her artistic
renditions there's a water turtle so

her song and she was singing it with me

reaches a point where she decides she's
in destruction

how quickly she annihilated this flora
the floor was completely clean when we
started vlogging that she's passed all
