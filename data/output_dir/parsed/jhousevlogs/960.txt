-  We're gonna go see Granny Jo.
We're gonna go see Papa Keith.
It's gonna be so much fun,
you just can't believe it.
We're gonna go see Granny Jo.
We're gonna go see Papa Keith.
It's gonna be so much fun,
I just can't believe it.
(upbeat music)
- We are on our way to
the airport to pick up...
-  Granny Joe and Papa Keith!
-  And whose Mom is that?
- Dads!
- So we are on our way to the airport,
in case you didn't catch that,
to pick up Granny Jo, and Papa Keith.
Which is Jeremy's Mom and Step Dad.
And we're so excited.
They're gonna be here for
a few days visiting us.
We're gonna have lots of epic fun.
Here they are!
We're pulling over, yay!
- Hello!
-  Thank you for
coming, we're so excited!
Where's Mom?
Guys who's here?
- Granny Joe!
-  Granny Jo, yay!
We're excited to see you!
-  Look at Papa Keith,
look at Elise has cowgirl boots.
- Those are cool.
-  And she curled
her hair with curlers
to be just like Granny Jo today.
For some reason.
She was so excited.
- Did you remember that
I had my little curlers
that I always put my hair in?
Hi Caleb, this is the first
time I've got to hold you.
-  Hi, mom.
- Hi.
-  It's good to see ya.
- I like your beard.
-  Thanks.
- It looks good on you.
-  Thanks.
- I mean, all your, all of your brothers,
"I wonder if we could do that?"
-  I know.
- It's gonna be the trend now.
- Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man.
Bake me a cake as fast as you can.
You pat it, roll it, mark it with a "L".
And throw it in the oven
for Laura and Belle.
Whoever that is.
- And we're playing a bunch
of different games here.
(rock music)
We're gonna get Brent this time.
Go!
(screaming and laughing)
(sped up high squeaky voices)
(slowed down low tone)
(rock music)
- That was close.
-  You're on it, you're doin' it!
You're flying!
Kay, I wanna try it, here.
(rock music)
-  You're gettin' a drink?
-  My turn.
- Not yet.
-  When you
get some good exercise,
you gotta get a good drink huh?
So, Granny Jo was the one
who sent us this fun toy
that the kids are playing with again.
-  Whatcha eatin'?
-  Lucky charms.
- Lucky charms.
-  Mmmm, what
do you like about it?
-  They
have yummy marshmallows.
-  They have these, see?
-  I see them.
- Look, a rainbow!
-  A rainbow?
- These are marshmallows.
-  Whoa.
- Oh, now I find it.
This is the present.
-  I can see how
it looks like a present.
It also, I think it
might be a shooting star.
What about you dude?
- I like this one.
-  What is it?
- A moon.
- My mom never bought
sugary cereal growing up,
which is great.
I think that's awesome.
But um, I loved Lucky Charms.
It was like a highly coveted treat so,
these are some pretty lucky
kids havin' this snack.
- Must not have been that good of a book.
Keith has the ability to fall asleep
in the most interesting positions right?
Okay, Isaac is the judge.
What's the word?
- Cozy.
-  Cozy. We gotta look for cozy.
- Okay, I think the most coziest
would probably be Panda Bear.
(yelling and screaming)
-  You got it, you got it!
She wants to play.
She just wants to play.
-  Pick another red one Luke.
-  Just let me play.
(baby crying)
Just let me play.
Here she comes!
-  What in the heck?
-  Stand up tall, Cubby.
Balance, balance.
Whooo!
So Caleb was just begging for a pet.
Guess what pet he's begging for?
He wants a pet Alligator.
Is that what you want?
- Did you know it's name it had to be?
-  Oh what would
you name your pet Alligator?
- Carson.
-  Carson, good one.
Carson, the pet Alligator.
So, we're playing a crazy
game where you're trying
to not let the ping pong
ball get blown off the table.
- It's all about form.
(blowing)
(laughing)
(blowing)
(laughing)
-  Did you hit the
camera, it was right on.
-  You're gonna start gloatin'.
(blowing)
(laughing)
-  It's all about placement,
you gotta go bottom of the ball.
-  Bottom. Yeah.
(sped up high squeaky voices)
- I think I'm gonna pass out.
(blowing)
It can enhance the game.
(laughing)
Kay, so this one time, Jeremy
and I were playing Clue
with a bunch of friends.
On the first round, he guessed
everything and it was right.
It was the boringest game ever.
-  Really?
- They didn't invite us over again.
I missed the vital rule.
Which means that I'm likely going to be...
-  Pooh head.
- Pooh head.
- Hopefully, I got really bad luck,
and had to pick up the whole deck,
and so now, it's lookin'
not so great for me either.
-  Oh, oh, oh,
yeah this means Im gonna get..
-  Ooh Jeremy, do you
get to play your first one?
-  I'm gonna get a free play.
-  A two, a ten, or an ace.
This was me last time.
Maverick.
(laughing)
- Not quite what I was hoping for.
-  Bummer.
(laughing)
-  Wait, so
there's nothing out there.
So no matter what you do...
- I don't know which
one has the right aura.
-  Kendra gets a
little freaky with cards.
-  Two!
-  Two, yeah!
-  That was a bad
one. That was the worst.
- I know, dang it. But it fake-ied me,
'cause it's a little card. Leave me alone.
(laughing)
- This is awesome.
-  Backfire.
(laughing)
- It kills me to not
know what's under them.
-  I know.
-  Yes!
(cheering)
-  Wow, she got
the three last time.
I almost won the game, but then I lost.
- Second to last!
(laughing)
Two games in a row.
-  But babe, you got
Pooed two games in a row.
