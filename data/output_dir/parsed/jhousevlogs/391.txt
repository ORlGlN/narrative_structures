we get it
thank you so much for all of your love
and concern on yesterday's video it
really means a lot to us so I know that
sounds cheesy but thank you
I'm feeling really grateful today to
know that baby girl is doing okay and
that I'm not dilated when I got home
from the hospital last night I still
contracted through a lot of the night
but I'm feeling better this morning and
I'm hoping as I continue to rest that it
will go away so I'm doing well today as
long as I'm not up and doing stuff any
time I get up and I'm doing stuff the
contractions come back so it looks like
I get to lay low for a few days and
Jeremy gets to have a lot of fun with
again
like the water weather on our front
court so much water huh
we decided to do a pizza buffet for
dinner tonight your sprinklers
dianna sprinklers up there in case of a
fire
I think it's if there's enough smoke in
here it automatically goes off
why does it make why smoke it causes if
there's a fighter there'll be a lot of
smoke in here so then the sprinklers go
up
Oh DITA ton yeah you're gonna finish
your brownie I know wow you must be huge
yeah it was that's really before
all right so funny she loves to just go
up and talk to strangers be careful so
we're coming up to the library with this
crazy brain and I can't help but
remember the time we came here during
the tornado siren we were trying to go
to the airport
that's the tornado so we're headed to
the airport but the tornado sirens are
going off so I don't really know Jeremie
up here to the left is the library can
we pull in there maybe when you're
driving you're supposed to take cover
okay let's uh play on the Left there's
this is insane so we have the family all
in the library and they have everyone in
a shelter well I'm very grateful that
they have a drive-up window at this
library because hauling all the kids in
in the wet right now would be very wet
thank you don't go inside it's pretty
wet up no I guess let me go you guys
want to go inside you're willing mm-hmm
Laura maybe we'll go inside
and now we're in the way did you get wet
yeah I'm in the way it was a little
rainy I got a little bit because I was
running so fast it wasn't too bad here
is really attractive
we lost Laura we're trying to find her
it's like playing Marco Polo right now
they're screaming up in a library and
she's responding did you run away from
us a little stinker got away
so Caleb built a hiding spot wait your
bum is your bum is sticking out
goodnight
Junior Seau I've been keeping track of
her contractions anytime there is the
possibility of complications of
pregnancy it's really scary
