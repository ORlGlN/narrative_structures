♫ You had a birthday
♫ Shout Hooray
♫ We want to sing to you today
♫ One year older and wiser too
♫ Happy birthday to you!
- Sam, Happy birthday!
We baked you a little
cake that we're gonna eat
in honor of your birthday.
Sorry we can't share any of it with you.
How is it, Cubby?
- Good.
- Your arm is sticky?
- But that's okay.
- What are we gonna do if
your face gets all sticky too?
(family laughs)
Uh oh, Elise!
(Elise screams)
(children giggle)
No!
At me?
(family laughs)
No no no!
I have a baby, I have a baby!
No!
At me?
- I don't think I got any of that!
(family laughs)
Whoa!
Good throw!
Good shot!
-  Happy birthday, Sam!
