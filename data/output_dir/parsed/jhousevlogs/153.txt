(kids laughing)
(upbeat music)
-  One, two, three.
(upbeat music)
Hello.
Why are you doing that?
- I don't know.
Excuse me.
-  That looks
like a little mouth now.
(kids laughing)
You look like you're a vacuum.
(kids laughing)
You guys sure make life interesting.
- Can I have my nose back?
-  Caleb, are you sure
that doesn't hurt your nose?
- No.
-  That really
looks like it would hurt.
- I didn't know noses could move.
-  It's 'cuz your nose
doesn't have a bone in it.
It's made out of wiggly cartilage.
(kids laughing)
Your nose can move.
Can your nose move?
(upbeat music)
(singing without words)
(upbeat music)
- You guys wanna help unload it up now?
- Yeah!
(upbeat music)
(paper crinkling)
-  What are you making?
- A old sheet of paper
for a little notebook.
I'm making a story of the Oregon Trail.
-  Is that like a pioneer journal?
- Uh huh and this is the outside,
so I can make it old.
-  So, it's gonna look really old?
- Mmm hmm.
(upbeat music)
-  Whoops-a-daisies.
(baby squealing)
-  Wanna try it?
Put it in your mouth.
What do you think?
So, today Jenae's trying
out this mesh feeder
for the first time.
I put some carrot sticks in there,
which I know are not super juicy,
but they're really cold and I thought
that might feel good on her teething gums
and you can still get
the flavor through it.
She's unimpressed.
Aw, man.
Teether down.
(kids laughing)
(upbeat music)
- So, we're here at the
library for Elise's tutoring
and the boys are checking out books.
(upbeat music)
- So, today is my once a month
freezer cooking club that I go to.
I go for two hours and
I make tons of meals.
I think this time I'm making 18
different meals to take home.
That should feed us for a month,
which I'm really grateful for.
Laura is my helper for today.
We'll see how that goes.
Miss Laura, where are we going?
- To bake.
-  To cook?
We're gonna go make dinner, huh?
What did we bring with us?
- Our aprons.
-  Our aprons.
- Yep, so that we can
keep our shirts all clean.
-  Yep.
All right, missy, count out 12 bags.
- One.
-  Make a pile.
- Two.
Three.
-  Laura's putting
smiley faces on all the bags.
There you go.
(upbeat music)
All right, we're gonna grab the cheese.
Look for some big bags of white cheese.
(upbeat music)
Good job.
Way to go.
Okay, carry it to our table.
I'll shut the door.
- She's so tired,
but Elise is gonna be
done in about five minutes
and I want her to fall asleep in the car
on the ride home, not
in my arms right now,
but I don't know if I can keep her awake.
Jenae, hey.
Hey.
Yeah, you're sleepy.
Whoops-a-daisies.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
- Okay, we're finishing up.
We made 12 batches of this
pest chicken casserole.
It's one of our favorites.
So, how did you like cooking club?
- Good.
- Laura's been a great helper.
Well, we did it.
I've got now 18 homemade
meals that are delicious
and wonderful and will feed our family
for the next month.
-  How did it go?
- Good.
- Are you ready to go
take a nap, big girl?
(upbeat music)
- So, this morning I had a little bit
of a rough start to the day.
Here's what happened.
Last night, when I was going to bed,
I set a goal.
I was like, I'm gonna
get up 15 minutes earlier
and I'm gonna get going and
it's gonna be this great day
and I had this vision in my mind
of all this awesomeness
I was gonna accomplish
early in the morning and it didn't happen.
And it's easy for me
to feel like a failure.
Like, ugh, Kendra, you should
have pushed yourself harder.
Kendra, why are you so lame
and you can't get up in the morning?
Like, it's easy for me to let that
kind of self-talk creep in
and just feel like a failure
and feel like giving up,
but I'm aware that if I let myself
sit in those feelings,
it's just gonna drag
the rest of my day down
and the day is still young.
We're still just getting going.
So, I'm trying really hard to choose
to have grace with myself and say,
you know what, Kendra, you're trying,
you're moving in a good
direction, you know,
you can keep trying tomorrow, you know,
a bad morning doesn't make a bad day.
Keep going, you can do this.
So, Laura is deeply asleep.
I can't seem to wake her up.
So, we come home after our cooking group
and she wanted to take a little nap
and I was doing school with the kids,
so I was like, that's fine,
but I can't let her sleep long
or else she's never
gonna go to bed tonight.
So, after she was asleep for a little bit,
I came in and I opened the blinds,
then we vacuumed her room,
then I sent each of the
kids individually in
to try to wake her up.
Now, I'm sitting on the
bed with Jenae and her
and I'm like rubbing her back,
I'm like taking off her blankets,
and she is so asleep.
Hey, Laura.
Do you wanna come play?
No?
Do you wanna come have a snack?
Do you wanna come help me cook dinner?
So, poll question for the day,
are you a heavy sleeper, a light sleeper,
or somewhere in between?
I am a really heavy sleeper.
I could probably sleep through
people vacuuming my room
and people trying to wake me up.
In fact, I have.
Jeremy, on the other hand, he's not.
- So, for dinner tonight,
Kendra made some meatloaf and potatoes.
It smells really good.
-  I couldn't wait.
I took a bite of the roll.
- What is meatloaf?
- Meatloaf is like ground beef
mixed with other stuff and then cooked.
-  Like this.
- Mmm.
- I want more bacon.
-  You mean meatloaf?
-  It's called meatloaf.
- Meatloaf is one of
those foods that's hard
to cook just right and
this is cooked just right.
You nailed it.
It's perfectly cooked
'cuz it's not too dry.
It's good.
- I love it.
- You love it?
- Look at my plate.
Right here.
-  Already gone.
- I guess it's time to
go bye-bye, meatloaf.
-  Hi.
You playing with your sister?
(kids laughing)
What are you guys playing, Laura?
- Tickle monster.
(upbeat music)
(Jenae squealing)
- Is Laura making you laugh?
(Jenae and Laura squealing)
I just wanted to tell you guys,
in our vlogs right now,
Jenae is exactly the same age as Laura was
when we very first started vlogging.
So, if you want to see
how much they look alike,
which is absolutely incredible,
you need to go back and watch
one of our first couple of vlogs.
I think the first one's called first vlog.
There's a few of them in there
right at the very beginning
and they just look so
much alike, it's crazy.
- Today, I heard a touching news report
where they were talking about how
before the hurricanes that hit,
we've been so divided in our country
over things like race,
or income, or politics,
but with the natural disasters,
with this focus on
surviving and the emergency,
a lot of those differences seem to go away
and the focus becomes on loving each other
and helping and giving for support
and how, if you were stuck
on the top of you roof
with water all around you,
you wouldn't care what
race or how much money
the person had that came to save you.
I just hope that that's
something we can carry with us.
That's such a beautiful
message and a reminder
that we can love more than fight
and that we can focus on our similarities
rather than so much of our differences
and come to understand each other better
and love each other more.
- This is my book.
- It looks old.
- Yep, it is old.
Hi, my name is Mary
and my brother is 17 years old.
Then, here's her.
- Does she have boots on?
- Yep.
- Looks really old.
Super old.
(upbeat music)
-  You coming
to play some soccer too?
Good thing.
Those are your soccer socks?
Ooh, good try.
It's Jenae, she's walking.
- Hi, Nay-Nay!
Hi!
Nay-Nay!
- So, I don't know if Jeremy
already told you guys,
but he was driving Isaac to
Isaac's first soccer practice
for the season tonight
and on the way there
I checked my email and I called Jeremy
and I was like, hey, it
actually got canceled
and Isaac was obviously disappointed
and so, Jeremy came home and instead of us
just being, like, hey, bud, it's canceled
and not doing anything,
Jeremy got all the kids
outside and geared up
and they're all playing soccer.
These are some of the moments
when I love Jeremy the most.
Like, I absolutely love
watching him out there
playing with all of our kids
and he has tons of work to do right now
and I know he's stressed about it,
but he saw that Isaac was discouraged
and the weather's gorgeous
and this is so great for all of our kids
to get out there and be playing with him.
Anyway, it means a later work
night for Jeremy tonight,
but I'm so grateful he's
managing that supportive spirit.
(kids laughing)
One, two three.
There they are!
(upbeat music)
- Oh, I almost made it!
I almost made it.
-  Good job.
Good job, Laura.
You made it.
(cheering)
- So, Jenae was absolutely screeching
inside from the window.
Like, she wanted to be outside so badly,
so I brought her little high
chair out here onto the deck
and she's happy as can be.
You watching everybody?
(upbeat music)
Oh, so close!
(cheering)
(Kendra laughing)
- Yay!
We won three points!
-  What you doing?
- Squirting.
-  You getting clean?
- Nope, I need to clean
my Barbie with soap.
(babbling and laughing)
- There's just a lot of
silliness around here tonight.
-  Apparently, it's bedtime.
- They're gonna go right
to sleep, no problem.
-  So, Kendra
just read Harry Potter.
- Yeah, the chapters are kinda long,
but we made some progress and it's good.
So, we're getting there.
-  They're ganging
up on their brother.
(kids laughing and screaming)
- Come give Jenae-nay hugs.
-  Kendra was
just saying to the kids,
can they remember what life was like
before we had Jenae in our family?
It's hard to even imagine it now.
- I know.
And it was wonderful, but
it wasn't quite as wonderful
as it is with her.
- And point them.
And flex your toes.
Now, lift them again just
six inches off the ground
and drop them.
Now, take in a deep breath
and let it out.
Take in a deep breath
and let it out.
Now, turn your fingers into
a tight fist and release.
- We are attempting some yoga before bed
to help calm these kids down
'cuz they are a little wild.
Goodnight.
J-house out.
So, today's a big day for this girl.
Who wants to help feed Jenae?
- Me!
-  Do you know
what's happening here?
She likes it.
-  Elise is gonna try some
of what Jenae's been eating.
- Everybody get in the wagon.
(kids screaming and laughing)
-  I got you a surprise.
(Jeremy gasping)
