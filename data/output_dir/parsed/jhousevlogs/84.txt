♪ This is the best tortellini ever ♪
- That's beautiful Mom.
How did you do it?
- It's like stars.
- I'm on a kind of emotional
rollercoaster right now.
(upbeat music)
(vacuum)
You like the vacuum?
Thanks for doing your chores buddy.
(upbeat music)
- Present?
-  Nope, the box
had our new camera in it.
I'm still bummed that we lost
our camera and that footage.
But it's good to have a new camera here.
(upbeat music)
- Well we finished up our morning chores
and so now the kids and I
are gonna sit down and read.
I love at Christmas time that
there's so many fun books to read.
So it's nice to just spend some
time cozied up and reading.
Land at the tree a long
time before Alec was born.
Digging carefully he moved the
little spruce from the shade.
Today we're making paper snowflakes
that we're gonna hang up on
the windows to decorate with.
What's the first step Isaac?
- Make it into a square.
-  Make your paper into a square.
- Perfect.
(upbeat music)
(laughter)
-  Did it cut in half?
- I'm ready to open mine.
-  Okay, let's see the reveal.
(piano music)
I love it.
-  It even has hearts.
I tried to, I cut it like that.
-  Nice, do you
wanna make another one?
- Oh yeah.
(upbeat music)
-  Nice work buddy.
That looks fantastic.
That is beautiful.
- I've never made anything like it.
- Wow.
A snowflake.
-  It's beautiful Laura.
- Can I hang it up?
-  Sure.
I love how you did this.
(piano music)
- It looks like the star.
-  Did you make a tiny one?
That is so fun.
So Elise made a little, tiny one.
I like it.
- It's not really the
shape of a real snowflake.
-  That's okay.
- It looks like a car.
-  It does look like a car.
Okay, let's see it.
(piano music)
That's awesome.
- Well I made like a carousel.
-  Would you like
to open this one Miss Laura?
(piano music)
Opp, did I accidentally cut it in half?
Does it work even?
- You can just tape it.
-  I accidentally cut it in half.
(laughter)
Okay, Mom's snowflake fail.
Well mine didn't work,
so I'm gonna try again.
This one's mine.
Will you open it for me Elise?
So gently.
-  Whoa!
(piano music)
- That is beautiful Mom.
-  How did you do it?
-  I just made lots of cuts.
Isn't that so fun?
Got the snowflakes all put up.
(piano music)
How's your baby?
- Good and a got a phone.
-  What are you working on today?
- I'm working on getting the basement
ready for a light show.
- I'm making lunch.
I like making tortellini
and mac and cheese
and stuff like that.
-  Good job.
- Thanks.
- I love letting my kids
work in the kitchen.
So are the noodles ready?
- Yep.
-  Do you want me
to help you drain them?
- Yeah.
-  So this pot is really heavy.
Even though I love having Isaac and Elise
helping in the kitchen, I still help
with a lot of these
parts because it's safer.
Good job, should we add some sauce?
- Yeah.
-  Do you like tortellini?
- Yes, I love it.
I like it more alone than with the sauce.
-  Here's how
Isaac's meal turned out.
Thanks for cooking it Isaac.
- These are really good cooked.
♪ This is the best tortellini ever ♪
♪ It is so good ♪
♪ Fa la la la la ♪
-  I heard you made it.
Thanks man.
- So good.
-  You singing too?
- A big blessing in our life
is the fact that since
Jeremy works from home
and the kids are home schooled,
we get to enjoy lunch
together during the day.
It's a real treat to be able to sit down
and talk about school and talk about work
and kind of reconnect.
(guitar music)
Hi baby.
- The last couple of weeks have been
really tough for me at work.
There's some situations going on that
are really impacting me
personally with fear and anxiety.
I'm trying to be optimistic and positive
and sometimes that hard to do.
I'm on a kind of emotional
roller coaster right now.
What's really been helping
me through this hard time
is I've been watching a
documentary on John Adams.
Looking at how difficult things
were during the Revolution
and just some of things
that really inspire
me about people from the past,
seem to put things in perspective
and help me realize that my
problems aren't that huge.
I just find a lot of inspiration from
how they dealt with tough situations.
- Caleb is reading books
to Laura, it's so cute.
- Made one of his boots
usually gave him _.
The _ did not take back _
so he was ready first.
You have one hour _
whoever matches the most
children with a gift wins.
-  You're a great reader,
thanks for reading to Laura.
- Thanks.
- Yesterday there was
just a lot of bickering
between the kids, it felt like,
I felt like all day I was dealing
with one argument after another.
Today, the kids are doing so well.
I keep finding them
playing nicely together
and doing nice things for each other.
I don't know what was in the air
that was different yesterday versus today.
It's just a good reminder that sometimes
when I'm having a bad day or
the kids are having a bad day,
I'm like oh my goodness,
everything is wrong in life and the world.
Some days it's just a day.
Today's a good day and that's nice.
So the kids are playing in their fort.
What do you think Miss Jenae?
Are there lights over here?
Here, crawl in, show
Jenae-nae how to go in there.
You see the lights, you're pointing to it.
So the big kids and Jeremy
built this light fort yesterday
and Jenae didn't get a chance to see it
because she was napping.
So this is her first time crawling in
and seeing all the lights.
She just keeps pointing at them,
she doesn't really know
what to do with it.
What do you think?
- It's like stars.
- Looks like stars in here?
- Isn't it hot?
- Yeah.
-  What's your favorite color?
- Red.
-  Which one's
your favorite Laura?
- Pink.
- Our family loves reading Christmas books
so I thought it would be fun this year
for the kids to write
their own Christmas book.
Today the kids job is to brainstorm five
different Christmas book ideas.
Then they're going to write it up,
type it up as they
revise it, illustrate it,
and I found these books.
They were at Target in just the
cheap dollar section I think.
I got a bunch of them.
They're really smooth
and nice on the front.
They're just these blank books.
It's gonna take several days
for this process to happen,
but I'm excited to see the
kid's creativity come out
as they create their own
children's Christmas books.
The kids are researching
all the Christmas books.
Is looking at the Christmas books helping?
- Kind of.
Just looking at the frame,
it gives me a big idea.
-  Did it?
- And I can only have five ideas.
-  You can have
as many ideas as you want,
I said you have to come up
with at least five ideas.
- Oh.
-  Caleb, do you have an idea?
- Yeah.
-  What's your idea?
- Instruments come to life.
They play theirself.
-  You got an idea too?
- It's my last one.
It's called Santa Spies.
They're trying to find Santa.
-  The kids are
working on their ideas.
It doesn't happen often,
but when both little girls
nap at the same time,
the house is eerily quiet
and I'm crazy productive.
We get so much done.
It's awesome.
Come is C O M E.
- C O
M
E.
-  Which number
are you working on Lise?
- Two.
-  So Isaac, you've
got all five of your ideas?
- Yeah, I'm thinking of what
Santa's son name would be
if he's something Claus.
You get trained to be Santa.
-  Oh, like a family business?
- Yeah.
-  Let's see it.
That's awesome.
Are you trying to come
up with another idea?
Keep looking, look at some more books.
Alright, Leesy, do you
have a favorite idea?
- The number two, it's about a
duck going to the North Pole.
Since he didn't have a
Christmas tree where he lived,
so he went to the North
Pole and he's a duck.
-  And he's a duck.
And usually ducks fly south.
- Yeah.
-  So it's gonna be kind of funny.
- Yeah.
-  Sounds good,
I can't wait to see it.
Alright, Mr. Caleb, do
you have a favorite idea?
- Santa changes his job.
-  What's Santa
gonna change his job to?
- A cleaner.
-  What's he gonna clean?
- Fridges.
-  He's gonna clean refrigerators.
- Yes and then they
don't have any scratches.
-  Interesting.
This is a fun idea.
So Caleb, who's gonna deliver
the presents instead of Santa?
- The elves.
-  Laura, do
you have any book ideas?
- So Santa had to go to the North Pole
since they needed him right now,
right, right, right, right now.
-  Then what
do they do when he gets
to the North Pole 'cause
they needed him right now?
- Then they rided the
sleigh with reindeers.
Then they got to the North Pole,
then a reindeer was coughing a lot.
-  Oh no, what happened
to the coughing reindeer?
- You couldn't use it.
Then the dogs could.
The dog sends their magic.
-  So then the
magical white dogs helped?
- Yeah.
-  Wow, great idea.
Alright, here's what Laura's handwriting
looks like these days.
Have you ever wanted to
write a book about anything?
Let us know in the comments.
(upbeat music)
-  Is that your jacket?
- Yep.
Can we have one?
-  You want some ice cream?
- Yeah.
-  Sure.
This looks festive.
Candy cane.
So tonight, Caleb's teacher from church
is coming to do dinner with us.
(rock music)
I almost checked out,
but I forgot one thing.
How was shopping?
- Good.
(rock music)
-  There you go.
- Very light.
Light.
(rock music)
- So I'm making taco
meat and I usually always
use just a taco seasoning packet,
but I've been wanting for a long time
to learn how to do it homemade.
So I decided to try today.
It's fun, I've heard it's like
healthier and lower sodium.
We'll see how it turns out.
What's something that you would like
to learn how to make homemade?
'Cause taco seasoning was on my list.
It looks like taco meat,
it smells like taco meat.
- But does it taste like taco meat?
-  That is the question.
In other news, Jeremy bought
holiday tortilla chips.
- Kendra's like I don't know if I can eat
tortilla chips that are red and green.
-  I think it
might mess with my brain.
- They were on sale.
-  No, that's awesome.
It's very festive of you.
- I wonder if they taste different.
-  Merry Chipsmas.
-  That's a good question.
Merry Chipsmas.
(guitar music)
-  Do you like the Christmas tree?
- We finally got all
the other kids to bed.
-  We think.
- We hope.
I just heard Laura.
We're almost there, thanks for watching.
- J House out.
- You know in real life I
wouldn't want to eat a camel.
-  Definitely not.
I'm going to try to do Jenae's
hair for the very first time.
- It's a new wonderland.
(screams)
(upbeat music)
-  Good morning
- Good morning.
-  We have
breakfast ready, come on.
