-  Okay, Isaac.
Where are we heading?
- To the World Series, the last game.
(playful orchestra music)
- We're coming up to get our parking spot.
See this, Isaac?
So people do what's called tailgating.
All right, so we're waiting
in line to actually go inside.
(upbeat rock music)
What do you think?
- And I see Jeremy Guthrie there.
-  Do you see Jeremy Guthrie?
- Yeah.
The number eight for the Giants.
-  Do you see him?
- He's my favorite Giants player.
- So I have butterflies, I'm all excited,
like Christmas morning or something,
when I was a kid Christmas morning.
Isaac, what are you feeling inside?
How are you feeling?
- Excited.
- So Kauffman Stadium has a
lot of cool stuff for kids,
and there's not a lot of kids
here at the World Series.
So the lines aren't long.
You ready to go out there, bud?
Whoa!
(upbeat rock music)
He's running.
(laughs) Look at you.
- We are so high, look!
- (laughs) Right.
We really get the best view of the game
from up really, really high, so we wanted
the seats in the very back.
You dancing?
This was a really good $30 hot dog.

Banner" by Joyce DiDonato)
(crowd cheers)
We're about to have the first pitch.
What do you think?
- I'm really excited.
- You're really excited?
(crowd cheering)
We scored, buddy, we scored, woo!
(crowd booing)
-  ♫ Let's go Royals
♫ Let's go Royals
♫ Let's go Royals
- So Isaac needed to go to the bathroom.
It's always such a fun atmosphere.
Everyone's giving fives with everyone.
We decided to just take
a fourth inning break,
come out, hit some balls around.
Good shot, buddy.
For me as a little kid, I would go
and watch my dad play softball.
And I would go back
and forth from watching
the whole game to going and
playing with other friends.
And so I'm glad that
Isaac wants to come play.
(crowd cheering)
-  ♫ It's a shame
♫ 'Cause it's one, two,
three strikes, you're out
- All right, we're going
into the ninth inning.
We're down by one.
It's intense.
- Daddy, is this the last inning?
-  This is the last inning.
-  ♫ Let's go Royals
♫ Let's go Royals
- It's two outs, last inning.
Alex Gordon is up to bat.
-  ♫ Let's go Royals
(crowd cheers)
- Yeah!
So there's two outs, we
have a guy on third base.
Pérez is up to bat.
(crowd cheers)
No!
So we lost.
We lost the World Series.
(crowd claps)
Good job, Royals!
Let's clap for 'em.
(crowd cheering)
How are you feeling, Isaac?
- Kinda sad.
-  Why are you feeling sad, buddy?
- Yeah, we lost.
-  It could be
a bummer to lose, huh?
Yeah.
But it was still a really good game, huh?
They played hard.
Did you have fun?
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought it was so cool
how the Kansas City Royals
fans responded after the game was over.
They were cheering for the team.
They were chanting, and people still
had smiles on their faces.
And it's neat with sports in general
just how it does bring
a community together.
I mean everybody was excited about it.
All right, little man.
-  I'm glad to
have you home again.
-  It's almost morning.
We need to get you to bed.
- What?
What time is it?
- Check out this face paint.
This is awesome.
Did you have fun?
Are you gonna remember it forever
and tell your grandkids about it?
- Well, yeah, probably.
- I remember back in 2014
when my dad took me to the World Series.
- I definitely could have sold
the tickets that I bought,
because I bought 'em straight
from Kansas City Royals,
which means they were a lot cheaper
than most people are buying them.
But today, I could have sold the tickets
for more than three and
four times the amount
that I bought each ticket for.
But I'm still glad that I
went, because it was fun.
And I really do hope that you do remember
that we went to the World Series
and had a good time together,
and that it was just
you and me and it was a special time.
Because I am always gonna remember.
I love you, bud.
(Isaac mumbles)
