- Stop, stop.
Stop, stop.
(children giggling)
Caleb.
(children giggling)
And there went a roll of tape.
Okay, what happened?
- I just putting the tape on all over us.
Now we're stuck together.
-  Can you walk?
- Whoa! (giggling)
- I'm not!
Oh, yeah!
- (Giggling) Oh, yeah!
- What are you guys doing now?
(children giggling)
Caleb, what are you?
- A (mumbles).
- My turn!
My turn.
- I am making dinner at lunch time.
Later this afternoon I have
a hectic afternoon time,
and I was worried about how
I was gonna make dinner work.
And then I realized
we're all home together
at lunchtime anyway, might
as well cook it then.
So we're gonna have creamy
chicken taquitos for lunch.
It is one of my favorite freezer meals.
Like, by far, hands down,
I haven't met anybody
who doesn't like it so
you really should try it.
And if you're new to the
idea of freezer meals,
it's a super-easy one to get started with.
So, um, I guess I'm making
a plug for freezer meals.
Go freezer meals!
Miss Elise is videoing for me.
Here I've got our bag of taquito innards
that was already cooked ahead of time
and it's just been sitting
in this bag in my freezer.
So I just got it and I snipped the top,
and then, come over here,
Leesie, and show 'em.
All I'm going to do is squeeze it
like that.
Into
(child calls out)
there.
And then I'm going to,
just a second, cubby.
And then I'm going to roll it up
and put it on here.
- That's it.
That's it!
- Usually I use smaller tortillas,
this is what we had in the freezer,
so that's what we're having for dinner.
To finish these off, you
just spray it with PAM
and sprinkle some sea salt
or kosher salt over it.
And then you bake it for 20 minutes,
and it gives it that
nice, crisp, fried taste
without actually frying
it, which is awesome.
- Ding dong!
-  Who's this?
- I'm Santa Claus.
-  What do you say, Santa Claus?
- Ho, ho, ho.
I'm saying, I have presents.
-  Oh, you have presents?
-  Can I have a present?
- Sure.
-  Okay, whose turn to pray?
-  Caleb's turn.
- No.
I'm Santa Claus.
-  Oh, Santa
Claus is going to pray.
- Can you pray for us, Santa?
And we're talking about Santa Claus,
and Elise thought that I
would make a good Santa Claus.
- Because he has a beard, and he's fat.
- I think!
- I didn't say it.
- That we should trim off all that beard,
put it on Caleb,
and color it with crayons.
- Well, we've had kind of a crazy evening.
Our internet has been out
for the last 10 hours.
And that's had a little bit of an impact.
All of our kids are in
bed, Kendra's in bed,
and I'm just finishing up some stuff
before heading off to bed
and getting ready for
another day tomorrow.
So every night there's
certain things that we do
before going to bed.
And one of them is going in
and checking on the kids.
They seem to always have their
blankets all over the place
and so we're gonna go in and make sure
that their blankets are on 'em.
(soothing, upbeat music)
