(upbeat music)
- Today we're gonna do
the 100 layers challenge.
- We're gonna be putting
100 shirts on Caleb.
(upbeat music)
- So we got 20 shirts from each
person in our family,
except Jenae of course,
that we're gonna put on Caleb.
Okay take your shirt off
so we can get this going.
Alright our first shirt ready, go.
(peppy music)
Caleb has to start with wearing Laura's
shirts 'cause that was the only
way we could get 100 shirts.
(kids laughing)
- Come on.
-  One shirt, two shirts.
(kids laughing)
(peppy music)
Oop there's a button.
-  You look so.
(kids laughing)
-  Oh my.
-  Okay we'll just
leave that one (mumbles).
- You look so beautiful.
(peppy music)
- I am the weirdest.
Oh wow.
-  It's almost like football pads.
(kids laughing)
Nope not to hard, okay.
(peppy music)
- Shoulder pads.
- This is the last one from Laura.
- Finally.
(upbeat music)
- I think you're gaining
a lot more weight.
- Yeah I'm gonna weigh myself
once we're done with this.
(upbeat music)
-  It looks so nice on you.
(kids laughing)
- Yeah I'm stronger than I used to.
- Arm wrestle.
(kids laughing)
-  He's having
a hard time standing.
-  Is it hard to stand?
-  With your funny arms.
(kids laughing)
(fast music)
So this is Caleb with all of Laura's
shirts and all of his
shirts on, how does it feel?
- Good.
-  Can you dance for us?
(Jeremy laughing)
Help him up, help him up.
-  Thanks.
-  Pretty big shoulders and back.
And you've lost a neck.
Alright you ready to go
on to Elise's shirts?
-  Yeah.
- First my favorite.
(soft music)
- So I think we're gonna stop
doing Elise's shirts 'cause
it's gonna stretch them all out.
So here's Isaac's shirt.
(fast music)
- I'm a safety.
-  Alright try to tackle Isaac.
(Jeremy laughing)
-  Help here.
-  He's stuck.
(everyone laughing)
'Kay so now we're gonna start
putting on some of the bigger shirts.
I don't think we're gonna
get all the way to 100.
There's just not enough Caleb.
(upbeat music)
Well I think we're gonna be done.
We didn't get to 100 but we put
a lot of shirts on Caleb.
So Caleb wanted to weigh himself.
What do you normally weigh buddy?
- 40 pounds.
-  About 40 pounds,
'kay step on the scale.
Let's see what you weigh, 47.8.
So that's about eight pounds of shirts.
- Wow.
-  Well he actually.
(upbeat music)
(Caleb yells)
(kids laughing)
- Well you did it.
So we're gonna have Isaac and Elise
see how many shirts they
can put on in one minute.
The world record is 31, you guys ready?
-  Ready, set, go.
-  Alright how
many shirts, in a minute.
(upbeat music)
She's going fast, that's gonna
be hard with glasses too.
(Jeremy laughing)
-  Oh, oh oh, where is it.
-  Isaac where are
you, that's my arm sleeve.
(upbeat music)
Nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.
(Jeremy laughing)
Oh I love it, 'kay let's count them.
How many did you guys get?
(peppy music)
- (mumbles) and instant win, yeah.
-  Good job and you didn't quite
have that last one all the
way on but it was close.
- Yeah four and a half.
- Poll question how many shirts
can you put on in a minute I know
some of you might be in a public place
and so you can't try this out.
But if you're at home and you have
the chance time yourself
and let us know in the poll.
We'd love to hear in the comments
any other challenges you
would like us to try.
And thanks so much for watching.
-  J House out.
-  Take a step.
(upbeat music)
Separate them out.
-  Candy.
- This pillow is perfect for me.
- Dad look (mumbles).
