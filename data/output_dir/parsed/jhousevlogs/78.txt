- This is actually a big deal,
we've never shared our
last name on the vlog.
- 26, 27, 28, 29, 20, 21!
- 26, 27, 28, 29, 20, 21!
- 26, 27, 28, 29, 20, 21!
(yelp)
(upbeat techno)
-  Janae has a new trick.
(baby scream)
She has learned that
she can push the chair.
(baby scream)
She says I can go anywhere I want now!
Come on.
(baby scream)
(laughter)
Oh you gonna dance now?
(baby squeal)
(Kendra laughs)
- Now when we have dance
parties she can dance with us.
-  She can join in.
- When we first started vlogging,
we had a lot of footage and
data to try to keep ahold of,
so I got external hard drives,
and the first ones I got broke,
and we lost months of footage
and it was devastating.
- It was really scary, you know,
these precious pictures and videos
that you have of your kids,
they're literally irreplaceable.
So we did a lot of research
and we decided to use product by WD
and we've been really happy with them.
Just makes me feel better to feel
like my photos and videos
are in a safe place.
- WD has the My Cloud Home,
and the My Cloud Home Duo.
What I love about the My Cloud Home Duo,
is that it can save everything
twice in its mirror mode,
and Caleb is gonna help me set it up.
Are you gonna be my helper?
- Yep.
Lock this into here.
Lock this into here.
- Yep, and this is gonna go
right into our wireless router,
and then put this into the outlet.
- What is this?
-  What do you think it is?
- Is this a cloud?
- Is this a cloud?
Does it get out clouds?
-  Does it get out clouds?
- Uh huh.
- No it doesn't make clouds.
- My Cloud Home Duo is a central place
where you can keep all our files.
So these could store your
pictures, your movies,
your videos, all from your home,
and there's no monthly charge for this.
And you set up, you can run
it all right from your phone.
I'm gonna make an account for you.
- My name's Kendra.
So this is actually a big deal,
we've never shared our
last name on the vlog.
We've been really
thinking about this a lot,
and we think it's time.
So here it goes, we are entering
in my first and last name
to create our account.
(suspenseful music)
(trumpets)
-  Johnston.
- Now we can finally tell you
guys the story behind JHouse.
- We get questions all the
time of what does JHouse mean
and what's our last name,
and they link together.
We were initially gonna be The Johnstons.
- Very creative.
- That's what we were gonna call the vlog.
- Very creative.
And we knew what kind of a logo we wanted,
we wanted a house with a J in it,
and our awesome brother in law, Sam,
designed our JHouse logo,
and Jeremy and I were
trying to design a page,
and we kept saying like, oh
let's put the JHouse over here,
let's move the JHouse over here,
and all of the sudden
we looked at each other
and we're like oh my goodness,
our vlog should be called JHouse,
that sounds way cooler than The Johnstons.
We liked having our last
name be kind of private,
but over time, you know,
different things have happened
where it's now time for
our last name to come out.
Jeremy and his brothers
started a law firm.
- Johnston Law.
- And, there ya have it.
So with Johnston Law being where he works,
we knew our last name
was going to eventually
come out, and so there you have it.
We are the Johnstons.
-  Let's finish
setting up your account.
So we're just downloading
the app from the app store,
and your photos are now
automatically backed up.
-  Already?
-  So you can see your
photos are now downloaded in
and if you wanted to take
one of these pictures
you can share it directly from here,
and so I can share to Facebook,
I can send it as a message or email.
-  Look how cute little Laura is.
-  She's all chillin'.
-  Yeah.
- Just wanna thank WD for
sponsoring our video today,
and you can look in the description box
for a link with more information.
So it's overcast and raining
this morning, and just cold,
and so actually feels
like a really good day
to like cozy up and stay home and do some
stay at home things, so
that's what we're doing.
This looks awesome.
- We want it taller than you.
-  What?
(playful guitar music)
That is huge.
You guys are making a legit skyscraper.
- It's taller than you!
- It's taller than me, you did it.
- We're making it taller now.
- It's kind of leaning a little bit.
Like it's, it is.
(crash)
-  No!
-  It was a cool skyscraper dude.
- Yeah.
- Dad look.
-  Did you guys do a puzzle.
- Yeah.
-  Who's on the puzzle?
You kind of look like Cindy Loo.
- I know.
She has blonde hair and I do.
-  Yeah.
Is this the puzzle you're working on?
- Mhmm.
-  Awesome, have fun.
- A kiss, and gets a hug,
happy holidays for Lama.
- So I ordered this off of Amazon
for the kids to play with and decorate.
-  Laura look what Mom got.
- Christmas tree!
-  Christmas tree.
- Christmas tree toy?
- So it's fabric so we can
put like stuff on it to make it decorate.
- 25, 26, 27, 28,
- How long are you
supposed to hold it for?
- 29, 20, 21,
- I think like 30 seconds.
22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 20!
26, 27, 28, 29, 20!
21, 22
(chuckles)
-  You're a great counter.
- We did it!
- Now let's decorate it.

-  Yay!
(baby squeal)

(laughter)
(baby groans)
-  You guys, Janae's helping
so you guys can do it again.
-  What do you guys
think of the Christmas tree?
- I like it.
Where'd it come from?
Awesome.
- You can take off everything.
-  Mmm candy
canes in the stocking.
Very clever.
(playful Christmas music)
- Lacy finished the puzzle,
doesn't it look great?
- Yeah.
(baby squeals)
A baby named Jesus.
- Yeah, our baby's name is Janae huh,
that's baby Jesus.
(baby squeals)
- So today I was preparing a lesson
that I'm teaching for a church,
and it just got me thinking
about things in my life
that I have regretted and
times that I didn't apologize
when I should have.
And I actually reached out
to a couple friends today
and apologized for things,
and it really felt good,
like it was a weight
lifted off my shoulder,
so that's just something to think about,
like, if you have regrets
or times when you haven't
said you're sorry,
like, life is too short to not reach out,
and to apologize, it felt really good.
(inspiring superhero instrumental)
So while we're eating dinner,
Janae has learned a new game.
(laughter)
- Uh, oh!
(baby screams)
(laughter)
- Uh, oh!
Uh, oh!
Here you go.
- Keep it!
(laughter)
- Caleb's hurt so we're dancing for him.
(fast paced Christmas music)
-  Nice.
(fast paced Christmas music)
-  Joseph went to Bethlehem,
and think he took great care along.
- So this Sunday, the kids are singing
in church in front of
everybody in the congregation,
and I'm excited, but they're
practicing right now.
(all singing)
(baby screams)
Do you wanna sing too Nae-Nae.
(piano notes)
- I'm keeping it really simple tonight,
we're making Gingerbread
cookies from this mix,
but I'm really excited because
we're actually gonna cut em out,
and I got some new cookie cutters,
that are actually called
like cookie cutter stamps.
Anyway, lemme show you these.
(yelps)
I just dropped it.
Now it's not for that!
The double drop.
No don't risk it.
- It's like a normal cookie cutter,
and then you press the
stamp function, like so,
very hard to hold onto.
- Is it glass?
Can I try doing this.
-  It's not glass,
it's plastic, thank goodness.
So you push on it.
- How?
-  Just like that.
And then it makes it look
like a Christmas tree.
You just need the cookie
dough, should we get it out?
Laura just handed me the cookie cutter
and I dropped it again.
-  It's true.
Like these are apparently
very slippery cookie cutters,
here I'll show them to you
without picking them up.
This is the kind that I got.
I'm using the infamous Christmas tree.
(soft jazz)
(all cheering)
-  Nice, that turned out great.
-  I'm so excited.
-  What'd you think Laura?
- I like it.
-  That is a pretty cookie.
-  Okay, now we're doing frosty.
(Christmas jazz)
(all cheering)
These are cute!
- These cookies are super duperty cute.
I really wanna eat them.
- Wow they look exactly
like a Christmas tree.
-  Isn't it cute?
- Yeah.
-  They're cute.
-  Not just super cute.
- Superdy duperty duperty cute.
- Superdy duperty duperty cute.
-  Whoa.
- So growing up, my mom had just a couple,
like maybe three or four cookie cutters
that also had the imprints,
-  Stamps.
- the stamps on the
inside, and I love them,
and I just thought people
didn't make them anymore
cause none of my cookie
cutters are like that,
and then I discovered they're
called cookie cutter stamps,
so I'm excited, I'm gonna
have to get more of these.
First you push down
the cookie cutter part.
And then you push down the stamp.
Op, that's enough,
and then you pick it up, and
now you push out the stamp,
there you go, good job.
So you put the cookie cutter
in first and then you stamp it.
And then we pull it out.
(gasps)
There it is.
-  The Rudolph one is pretty cool.
-  It's hard to get
like all the antlers out.
Okay, there we go,
then we push it out.
(gasps)
Oh, there it is!
Should we cook them?
- One question,
which is your favorite
design from the cookies?
We got the Christmas tree, the candy cane,
the snow man, and the reindeer,
so let us know in the poll.
(Christmas jazz)
(ticking)
-  Kinda hard to tell if
gingerbread cookies are done or note.
Ooo, I'm not sure.
- I'm gonna get dough rash.
-  Why are you
gonna get a dough rash.
- Cause I just have flour on me.
-  So you think
cause you have flour
on your hands you're
gonna get a dough rash?
- If I have it on after
bed time then I will.
-  Oh so we gotta wash your hands?
- Yeah, right now.
(pounding)
-  You better not pout,
I'm telling your why,
Santa Clause is coming, to town!
We just got white frosting right now,
so you can use white frosting
and sprinkles to make little designs.
-  Looks good.
(Christmas techo)
-  Help.
-  Did you put a
little too much sprinklers?
The key is to kind of pour it lightly?
-  How's decorating going?
- Good.
-  Standard for Laura.
-  Ugh, I'm done.
-  Glasses.
-  Glasses, a
snow man with glasses!
(baby grunts)
-  You wanna do it?
- I wanna eat it!
-  Sorry, baby, next year.
(baby screeches)
- We've been watching videos of Laura.
Janae looks just like
Laura did at this age.
-  This is your future Janae.
Nae-Nae you can help daddy decorate one.
-  Stop it!
-  I've done all mine.
(baby squeals)
(laughter)
- They're good.
-  You like gingerbread don't you?
- It's good.
-  You like it?
It's a lot of frosting there dude.
So I'm putting Laura to
bed, and I found this.
- I put it to bed.
-  You put her to bed?
- Mhmm, it's my baby.
-  Was she hard to put to bed
or was she pretty easy?
- It was pretty easy.
-  What did you
do to put her to bed?
- Just carry her, then I
took off the blanket off her,
then I just literally just made this bed,
cute for her.
-  Nice, it is very cute for her.
- Then she can have
this and this and this.
-  Oh she's gonna
have lots of covers on her.
- Mhmm.
-  Are you gonna
sing her some songs?
- Not really, she just
goes to bed all by herself.
-  What a big girl she is.
- She is like, um, one year old.
-  What's her name?
- Rose.
-  That's a pretty name.
- She knows how to say mommy and daddy.
At night she has
(mumbles inaudibly)
-  This was disgusting.
-  Hey Luce what
happened to your glasses?
- Oh Janae broke them.
(laughter)
(baby squeals)
(upbeat jazz music)
