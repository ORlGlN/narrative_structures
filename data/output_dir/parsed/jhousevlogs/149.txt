(laughing)
- She got the biggest one.
-  Good job Isaac.
- J House store, right here.
- Come to the J House store,
it's the best store in the world.
- So with our AC still not working,
we slept with all the windows open,
but it's still 80 degrees in our house
and the guy is coming this morning
to try to fix it.
(happy music)
Janae's staying here,
but the rest of us are
going to Isaac's first.
- Soccer game.
(upbeat music)
- Good job Isaac.
-  Good pass.
-  Good job, good job Isaac.
- Laura, can you see?
So the sun is out, but
it's raining right now
so they're playing in the rain.
-  Come on sir, get up there.
Spread out.
-  Do you need to go potty?
- Yep.
To the port-a-potty.
-  Port-a-potty time.
We went right before
we left though, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- But I need to go right now.
-  That's right.
I'm glad you told me.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
♫ If you need to go potty
♫ Stop right over there
(playfully pensive music)
-  There it is.
- Wow, it's so big.
-  Did you have fun?
- Yeah.
- Did you get some Gatorade?
- Yeah.
-  So Ms. Elise has
moved on to subtraction today.
How's it going?
♫ It is awesome
-  Laura are you feeding Janae?
- Yeah.
- Whoa.
She got the bowl.
(laughing)
Loaded nachos for lunch.
-  Elisy, what are you doing?
- Our J House store.
-  So you have a J House store?
- It has everything and a refrigerator.
(playful music)
-  Nice, the J House store.
Who's working at the J House store today?
- Me and Caleb and Laura.
We're people that will help you today.
-  So am I just
supposed to buy stuff?
-  Yeah.
-  Okay, so can I
choose some of these books?
- Yes.
- Any recommendations?
- This book is the goodest book to read.
-  Ma'am, here's what I've got.
I picked out a book.
And I picked out a baby toy
and I picked out some wipes.
Did I buy it?
-  Um hmm.
There you go.
-  That's quite the receipt.
- Beep.
-  Well thank you ma'am.
- You're welcome.
-  Thanks.
- And here's your receipt.
-  Awesome.
Have a good day.
- Okay.
(thunder crashing)
- Well Jeremy was just getting ready
to go out and mow our lawn.
And I don't know if you can hear or see,
but it's definitely raining.
Like pouring.
There is no way we are going
to be able to mow today.
So I guess our lawn will just get longer
and we'll move again soon.
- The forecast said it
wasn't gonna rain until 8:00.
I was supposed to mow the lawn.
- Is it done?
- That was a lot of
rain in that short time.
- It was.
- The sprinklers
are still going over there.
-  The neighbor's
sprinklers are still going.
- J House store right here.
- Come to the J House store,
it's the best store in the world.
-  What can I
get at the J House store?
- You can get whatever you want.
There's couches, there's a refrigerator.
-  Anything?
- Yeah, we have a swingset.
First I need your dedification.
What's your name?
-  Are you talking to me?
- Yes.
- (laughs) My name's Jeremy.
Do you guys have
Worcestershire sauce here?
- Um, I think so.
-  Okay, I was
really hoping to get
some Worcestershire sauce.
Can you say that?
- Wurshershire shauce.
- We are out of it.
-  Oh you're out of it?
-  I know where it is.
It's in the back.
-  So how much
is this gonna cost me.
- $80,000.
-  Is that my receipt?
- Not yet.
-  There's more?
Alright.
- That's how much a million
thousand dollars is.
- And some people just come
here to get more money.
-  Whoa, could I
get more money instead?
How 'bout instead of me
getting Worcestershire sauce,
what if I just buy a million dollars?
From you guys.
- Okay, go get that.
- How much would that cost?
- That would cost.
- Two million dollars.
- No.
$2.
-  $2?
Okay, let me grab my money.
- You can hand that back.
-  Okay, here ya go.
And here's the $2.
No I'm just kidding.
I'm not really gonna give you money.
She was so excited.
- The mountain of soap is this.
-  Is it a mountain of soap?
- Yeah.
- Oh my goodness.
You guys ready to get in to
Mom and Dad's big bathtub?
- Hey, wanna see a magic trick?
-  Yeah.
- Without dying?
-  Oh without dying?
Yes, I wanna see one without dying.
-  I do want soap.
-  Whoa, you can go under water.
Whoa.
That was so long.
-  Introducing
Elise from Kansas City!
(crowd cheers)
-  You decided to join the fun?
-  Yep.
-  She's like what is this?
- I think Janae wants to come.
But Mommy's gonna hold her.
-  Alright, let's
all see your best beards.
(playful music)
(kids laughing)
Oh I like 'em.
-  Caleb has a pony tail.
(laughing)
Did you create a slide?
- Yeah.
- Let's see it.
Do your slide.
Whoo!
Alright, these have not
been working all the time.
So we're hoping it works.
Nothing.
(laughs)
-  We might need Dad.
-  What would Dad do?
-  He's stronger than you.
-  Oh, so then
he could push the button?
- Yeah.
- But he will break it.
-  See?
Give it a try buddy boy.
- Got it down.
-  Your pony tail is funny.
- Okay, let me.
-  Push it down, give it a try.
- Got it?
- I will go down in history
as the man who pushed a button.
You guys ready for this?
-  No, it doesn't work.
-  Okay.
(jacuzzi rumbles)
(kids cheer)
Hey guys!
Dad got it, yeah!
The bubbles are gonna start bubbling.
(kids squealing)
- I knew you could do
it, I knew you could.
- So how did you get it to work?
-  I pushed the button.
- No like really?
How did you get it to work?
'Cause I pushed that
thing and I pushed it.
Did I like prime it for you or something?
-  Yep, you got it ready for me.
-  There we go.
(Caleb laughs)
- This is my first time
putting a baby in her pajamas.
-  You did it?
- Uh huh.
- Alright, so I'm just
cleaning up the kitchen
and look what I found.
All of these cups.
Those are Jeremy and I's cups.
And this is for my children.
It looks I have like
eight kids, which I don't.
I only have four kids
that drink out of cups.
I have tried everything to
pound it into my kids' head
that they use their one cup each day.
But it never works.
If you have any great ideas
for how to teach kids just
use their one cup a day,
or I don't know what to do.
So if you have any ideas,
let me know in the comments.
I bought this for a
dollar at a garage sale
a couple years ago.
It says ages eight and up.
But I think you just
have to be able to read.
And I think enough of our kids read now
that we we can play this game.
We're gonna try.
- So during each round someone's it
and everybody else has to
look at their four cards
and decide which one they
think I will like the most.
Then I rank them and whoever gets the card
I like the most wins that round.
- You have to choose this one or this one.
-  If it's nacho cheese,
you know that's the one to go for.
Got it?
-  So do you
like any of the things?
- I like some of them.
-  Nice.
- Your choices are
wrestling, Super Bowl Sunday,
hip hop and room service.
That's amazing.
Well room service is my
favorite one of these.
-  I did room service!
-  Did you?
Caleb, what is room service?
- I think it's helping
somebody with their room.
-  Nice.
- Like service.
We'll just let them believe
that that's what I love the most
is serving other people in their bedrooms.
So room service is when you're at a hotel
and you order dinner or ice
cream and chocolate cake,
or other yumminesses and they
just bring it to your room
and you eat it right there.
(dramatic music)
Ice cream time!
So the funniest part of that game
was that Laura dominated.
Like I think she picked
the right one three times.
(kids laughing)
- She got the biggest one.
- That's okay.
I like green too.
- You might just have a ton of weapon.
-  And a cookie and a cookie.
So it's family date night tonight,
which is also known as we
couldn't get a babysitter,
so we'll stay in and play with them.
- He was now eating
dead rats by the crate.
Who I've never met.
But the way Henry goes--
- Goodnight, J House out.
- Janae had a big poo and it's
very disgusting and yucky.
- Did you guys see that?
-  So it's getting
hotter and hotter in our house
and I just called about getting it fixed.
And they closed 15 minutes ago.
