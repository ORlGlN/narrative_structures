you
so cubbies feet were all covered in mud
I told him to come out and hose it off
buddy
you're completely wet now right for part
of our date night tonight Jeremy and I
decided to come out to the parade of
homes here in Kansas City which
basically it just means that you get to
come tour amazing and beautiful houses
it's really nostalgic for sue because
when we were in college we would do this
all the time and we loved analyzing the
home together they save that tree it is
huge I just want to climb it the shower
the shower room so these are made like
shoes so people like me that have like
five pairs of shoes what do you do with
it the u.s. feature Buddha Judy and okay
what
you can fall no this is my favorite
feature in this room it's kind of random
like a built-in hamburger
it's a secret passageway for passageway
but it's a laundry chute
I love laundry chutes when we were
little we lived in a house of the
laundry chute and it was a short wide
laundry chute and I do remember sliding
so it's interesting oh there's a bug
there's just I roll down the window and
let it out anyway what I was trying to
say is that when we go to these homes I
mean look at these beautiful homes I
feel like we're really just admiring the
beauty of them like I feel like homes
are a kind of art and it's fun to see
the creativity in the different ways
that people design and do things and
what's funny is when we leave we don't
feel like envious envious like those are
beautiful homes but we love our house
and I don't want any more space than we
currently have and I love our yard and I
love our garage and I love the placement
of the room so it's time to come and see
different things and then it's fun to
walk away feeling just really content
and grateful for what we have which I
mean don't get me wrong like it's not
like I'm never envious in life but
it's nice to feel that way so we want to
eat it Cheddar's we put our name down
and got one of their little buzzards
buzzers we had 30 minutes so we're just
like checking out restaurants in the
area you know Jeremy was joking he's
like apparently now we're doing the
parade of restaurants but there's a
bunch of new ones I wanted to go in and
see what the ambiance is like and look
at their menus just kind of fun
okay
do yourself
