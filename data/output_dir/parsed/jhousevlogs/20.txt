- So the boys were just
looking out the window
and they think they
see a bobcat on a tree.
(bright music)
There's that noise,
stop making that noise.
- Hey.
I miss you.
She's walking so much
in just the little time
I've been gone.
- Good morning.
I don't feel good this morning.
I have a headache.
I think I'm just tired.
- I helped Mom since she has a headache,
I made her bed.
-  That was so sweet of you.
- Today's a great day,
because Jeremy's gonna come home.
(lively music)
So I'm a big fan of hot yummy breakfasts,
so we're making French toast this morning.
Poll question, do you like
to have a hot breakfast
or just a quick and easy
cold cereal breakfast,
let us know up here.
French toast.
Alright Elise, what's your
favorite breakfast food?
- Breakfast cake.
- My favorite is French toast.
-  You like that one the best?
Okay how about you,
what's your favorite breakfast?
- French toast.
(funky beat music)
- So I came to breakfast this morning,
got some French pancakes
and I'm getting ready
for my last day here in San Diego.
So I'm actually here at
the Children's Museum,
in San Diego, walking by it.
This is where the kids were painting,
and making Play-Doh.
Seeing all these places
brings back such good memories
from our trip in San Diego.
(upbeat jazzy music)
- So the boys were just
looking out the window
and they think they
see a bobcat on a tree.
- We don't know yet if
it's our neighbor's cat
or a bobcat.
It's huge.
It's huge.
- It might be a wild cat,
but it could be like a
lynx, a bobcat or something.
-  What if it's a bobcat?
-  So there's the
cat they're talking about.
Guys I think it might
just be a neighbor's cat.
-  Well then it has to be huge.
-  It is a pretty big cat.
Janae do you see any animals out there?
So now that you can see it up closer,
what do you think?
- It's bigger, so I bet
it's not a neighbor's cat.
I bet it's probably just a wild cat.
-  Do you think it's a bobcat?
- Actually not, because
bobcats are more dark,
in my opinion, but it could be.
-  What do you think it is,
do you see it out there?
- I think,
It's really big because
it might be warning us
and it might be excited.
-  Yeah?
(bright guitar music)
So where's Daddy been?
- At San Diego.
-  Yeah?
- I miss him.
-  What do you think
he's doing in San Diego?
- Going places to eat with friends.
- So we are at the restaurant.
I'm here with Dan from What's Inside.
- How's it going guys?
- And we're at the restaurant
where Tom Cruise sang
at the piano in Top gun.
It's just kind of a side
bonus of being here.
- Have you guys seen Top Gun?
A lot of our audience
probably is too young
to ever have seen Top Gun.
- There we go, poll question for the day,
have you seen Top Gun?
Let us know in the poll.
♪ Goodness gracious, great balls of fire ♪
- We finished the puzzle.
-  I loved doing one,
it was really fun.
- But there's that one bad thing.
We lost a piece.
- Yeah.
-  We lost one piece.
So the very first day
when we were sorting the pieces,
from edges and middles,
Laura helped us.
And I have a sneaky suspicion.
Do you know where the puzzle piece is?
- No.
-  This was such a fun puzzle,
because there were so
many different patterns.
So it was a lot of pieces,
but it wasn't super hard.
- I think my last piece was that one.
-  That's a good one.
Feels so good to put in the last piece.
- I put in a few of these pieces.
-  Yeah you did.
So this is our next puzzle Elise
and I are gonna do.
She's kinda my puzzle buddy.
Are you our puzzle buddy too?
- Uh-huh.
-  I think the sand
could be really challenging.
I'm a little bit nervous about it.
- 'Cause it's the exact same.
-  Yeah.
What are you two working on?
- Well just the tree house.
-  You're sanding these branches?
- We have to make wood,
since we don't really have
any long pieces of wood,
so we decided to do this.
-  Working hard.
- So see how I made the top a little flat?
-  Yeah.
- And then see how I made the sides flat?
-  Yeah, wow,
that's a lot of work.
- So that's why tree
houses take a lot of work
if you want to make it from scratch.
(laughing)
- So the reason I come
to these conferences
on social media is that this space
is so new, it's like the wild west.
To be able to get together
with people who have experience
and are learning things,
I just love learning all the time,
it makes a business, what
we're doing on YouTube,
and with the law practice
and the relationships that I build
are probably the most important thing.
- So I feel like Janae has transitioned
from a baby to a toddler
in the few days that Jeremy has been gone.
When he left she was crawling
more than she was walking.
And now she's walking
more than she's crawling.
She also just committed
her first act of mischief,
check this out.
She grabbed a pencil,
climbed up on the fireplace
ledge and colored.
I looked over there and she
was so proud of herself.
She was grinning, like check me out,
I'm such a big girl.
And I'm like, oh my goodness,
I'm tired already,
thinking about everything
that she's gonna get into this year.
Yes, you colored right there.
Should we clean it up?
Should we get a rag and clean it up?
Uh-oh, we're pooping, we're busy.
Oh, do you see shoes?
Oh she saw a shoe, she's coming for it.
(Janae vocalizing)
Oh there's the jackpot of shoes.
It's the shoe bin.
- I had a great time at the conference.
It was fun to get to speak
and to share some of the
experiences we've had.
But I'm excited to get home
and see the kids and Kendra.
(upbeat music)
- So to be honest, today
has been quite a rough day.
And the problem today has been me.
I'm struggling with a lot
of anxiety and grumpiness
and I'm just easily irritable.
Like I feel all of my
sense are heightened.
I'm like oh my gosh, that noise,
stop making that noise kids.
I'm feeling really grateful
that Jeremy is coming home tonight.
He's actually been gone for a couple days.
I didn't film all the
days when he was gone.
We just miss him,
so we're really excited.
He's getting home in the
middle of the night tonight
and tomorrow morning it'll be so nice
to have him here with us.
(chill atmospheric music)
♪ Eh eh eh eh ha ha ha ha ♪
-  Are you guys
staring at each other?
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna try to make
it so I don't look down.
- Oh boy.
-  You're doing awesome.
On days like today,
I'm so grateful for the pretty weather.
'Cause when the kids can get outside
and I can feel the sunshine,
it feels like everything
just that much better.
Hi Nae Nae.
(wind chimes clinking)
So Isaac just ran inside and was like,
Mom, I just invented a new sport.
And I'm like oh, what sport?
And he said swing dancing.
And I'm like that's actually a thing,
I've actually swing danced.
And he's like really?
And I said yeah, like you have a partner
and you're dancing.
And he's like no Mom, dancing on a swing.
So I'm gonna come see what they
have created as swing dancing.
(playful music)
A synchronized swing dancing routine?
- I did it.
I did it.
-  Whoa, that's complex.
- Yes, I did it.
Whoa.
(Kendra laughs)
I did it.
-  I think you
gotta go all the way
from one side to the other side Lise,
let's see your best cartwheel.
Laura, stand to the side.
-  Ha good job.
- Did you just say good job?
- Mmm-hmm.
- So I'm ordering pizza for dinner tonight
and I just pulled up one on the screen
and what did you think
it had inside of it?
- Worms.
- Do you really thing that
I would order a worm pizze?
- Yeah.
- No I would not.
- It actually was worms.
- I had a pizza up on the screen
that had peppers on it.
And apparently she thought in the picture
it looked like worms.
Lydia are you painting her fingernails?
Well the kids are having
fun with their friends.
They're exploring in the woods,
they're playing sports,
they're doing all kinds of silly stuff.
And Janae just wants to get down
and do it all with them.
(Janae vocalizing)
yeah.

- So this is the pizza that
Laura was talking about.
These red peppers are the worms.
We finished off the night with pizza
and a movie.
The kids are all in their pajamas
and just relaxing and it feels so good.
(upbeat atmospheric music)
Jeremy's home and I'm so happy he's home.
- I'm so tired,
but I'm happy to be home as well,
I really missed the family.
- He's losing his mind a little bit.
- Let's go to bed.
- Goodnight.
- J house out.
- J house out.
- I'm so excited.
(dramatic music)
- Happy birthday!
-  Whatcha doin'?
- Sanding.
- Janae is running.
