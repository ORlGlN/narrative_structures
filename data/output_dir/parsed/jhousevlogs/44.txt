-  Oh! (laughs)
So since the kids saw that
there were rattlesnakes here.
-  They've been a little nervous.
You got it, girl!
(gasps) Woo!
Oh my goodness!
The best way to pass the
time and keep everyone sane
is to sing.
(baby vocalizes)
- I'm just feeding Nae Nae.
-  Yay!
Thanks for making your bed.
Thanks for doing the dishes, buddy.
So what'd you write this morning
in your gratitude journal?
- Things that keeps me safe in my room.
-  Like what?
- Door, bed, blanket, fan.
- Hi.
-  Hi, well good morning.
So have you seen how there's
fog all down in the valley?
Hopefully it clears out as the day goes on
and we can have a clear day.
- Yeah.
- Hi, Da.
-  Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Da.
-  Hi, Dad.
(light music)
- So while we're here in San Diego,
we're still needing things,
you know, normal things,
like paper towels and toilet
paper and dishwasher detergent,
and also fun things like
sand toys and beach balls.
And we don't want to
spend a bunch of our time
running around shopping, because we want
to spend our time playing
and enjoying family time.
So we were really excited
when Google Express
reached out to sponsor our video today.
Through Google Express, you
can shop multiple stores
with one easy checkout, and you can use it
on your desktop, mobile, or the app.
Let's get some stuff.
So one thing I've learned
is if you're going
to the beach a lot, you
do a lot of laundry.
Laundry detergent.
I'm also out of this makeup.
Mmm, popped right up.
So when you find the
product that you like,
when you come back the next time,
it's really easy to reorder.
So which sand toys are you interested in?
- That one.
- Hey, Laura.
- Hey.
- Do you wanna help us shop?
- Yeah.
- We're looking at these,
do you know what these are?
- Kites.
- So which one do you want
to play on the beach, Laura?
-  This one.
-  You like that one?
- I like that one, I
think it's the best one.
- Me too.
- You like this one, we agree on it?
- Yep, yep, done.
- Done.
We got a kite.
I don't know if you're helping
me shop or distracting me.
(Laura giggles)
All right, Laura, which
trash bags should we get?
Trash bags.
So that's from Target.
So there's free delivery
and no membership,
you just have to meet
the minimum requirement
for each store, which we did.
Oh, paper towels!
Done. All right.
- In the cart!
- In the cart, yep didee yep!
(both laugh)
- Thank you so much to Google Express

Go use it, it's in our

So we came out to a new park today,
and it's called San Dieguito County Park.
- I think this one is the stage.
-  Did you find a stage?
-  Do you want a water, Daddy?
Here, water.
-  You're performing on the stage?
- I'm tap dancing.
- And we're right here, so
we're gonna go this way.
You guys ready?
-  Whoa!
-  Check it out, we
made it to the hawk's nest.
-  We should've
brought our binoculars.
- Yeah.
'Kay, so there's also
quail here, and rabbits.
This is gonna show us
what a red-shouldered hawk
sounds like.
-  The red-shouldered hawk.
(hawk screeches)
-  So since the kids thought
that there were rattlesnakes here.
-  They've been a little nervous.
-  They've been a
little concerned about it.
-  Southern Pacific rattlesnake.
(rattler rattles)
-  Hear that noise?
-  That's what a
rattlesnake sounds like.
- That's a good thing to know.
-  Yeah.
-  It is.
- 
The most important thing
to do is call 911.
- So there's these
activities all along the way
the kids are trying, it's funny.
And by kids, I mean Jeremy.
They're a bunch of monkeys.
(laughs)
One, two, three.
-  She's so cute when
everyone's smiling at her.
(rock music)
-  Lizard!
-  'Kay, try to catch it.
Get it, Leesee.
-  Leesee, you're so brave.
-  Oh! (laughs)
-  Good try!
-  What did you hear, Laura?
- I heard a woodpecker!
-  Let's go this
way, is that another lookout?
-  It's another lookout.
- 'Kay, so look, this is
a Lemonade Berry bush.
(pleasant music)
There they are, wave!
- It's actually kinda hard.
(Jeremy laughs)
(Elise grunts)
-  Good, put your arms up there.
Put your arms up, ready?
And pull!
- No.
- No? (laughs)
-  I think my gymnastics teacher
would be so happy for me.
-  Ready? There we go!
Go!
-  Nae Nae's helpin' ya.
(Elise laughs)
- Well, we successfully made it back out.
- (laughs) I laid on my belly.
-  Yeah you did.
- This is like American Ninja Warrior.
-  Reminds me of your birthday.
- One, two, three, go!
She's like what was that?
Janae did not want to be held.
Janae wants to swing.
Da-da.
You remember how to
pump, don't you, Laura?
Move your legs like Leesee.
-  You guys making a restaurant?
- Laura, grab more leaves, okay?
What is this called, Laura?
- Barf.
-  What is it called?
- Barf.
-  You want me to eat your barf?
- No, just for pretend.
-  Just for pretend.
- It's called bark.
-  Bark? Not barf?
- Barf is when you're mad.
-  No, I think it's gross.
-  These things are cool.
-  Getting your workout in?
Mom wants to try.
- Should I crank up that resistance?
-  Go all the way.
- I'm scared!
Oh, that's a good workout.
-  Practicing your basketball?
-  Is Dad trying
to steal the ball?
(rock music)
-  Come get stuck with Mom.
- Kids make this look so easy.
I can't get up.
(Jeremy laughs)
Momma needs to work out more.
-  End it with the gymnastics.
Boom.
- Check out these roots!
These two just invented a game.
You give them a ball, and each other,
and they're just busy playing games.
This girl's cheering, she's excited.
-  Da da da da.
-  She's going for Dada.
-  'Kay, Laura's turn.
-  Laura, do the whole thing.
- I'm gonna shake out right now.
-  Shake out those hands.
- They're really sore. (gabbles)
-  Shake it off.
Laura, who's your teacher?
- Caleb.
-  Yeah, he's your teacher.
- Really good teacher. (laughs)
Ow!
-  Oh, ow!
(all laugh)
Bonked her with your bum!
-  Look at him go!
-  'Kay, Laura, let's see it.
-  So hang, put
your first hand there,
other hand, other hand.
-  Good job.
You got it, girl!
Woo! Oh my goodness!
Oh my goodness!
Laura you got it, you got it!
-  Get it.
-  Good job, Caleb.
-  'Kay, your other hand.
-  Yay!
-  Good job, you did it!
-  That was incredible!
-  Laura, you did it!
I have never seen a
three-year-old do monkey bars.
- I know, it's really hard.
- So we're trying a new
burger place for dinner.
Looks like we tired out at
least one of our children.
But not the other ones.
- No, you got us more energy.
-  We got you more energy?
- Yes, yeah.
-  That looks good.
- So this place does chicken on a stick.
(upbeat music)
So this salad looks really good.
Jeremy and I are splitting
the burger and the salad.
Little tip, when you're
stuck in traffic with kids
at night, the best way to pass the time
and keep everyone sane is to sing.
Sing it loud.
♪ Open your eyes, let's
begin (Kendra laughs) ♪
♪ Yes it's really me, it's Maui ♪
Goodnight. J House out.
When you eat this cake
tomorrow, you're gonna be
eight years old.
- Welcome to our hotel.
- It's so good to see you.
(upbeat music)
- And a seagull flew by and
took the whole granola bar
out of her hands.
