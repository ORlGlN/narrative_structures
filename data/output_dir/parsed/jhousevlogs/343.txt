how are you gonna reach it I'd like to
live with this school well the kids have
been helping me round up Christmas stuff
from all corners of the house and now

Christmas and this is all they're like
kids puzzles and books and games now
we're going to take the ornaments off
the tree you guys want to help me yeah
all right go take them and I just want
you to lay them right there in front of
the fireplace and then I'll pack them up
we lost a Wiseman and our nativity this

this looks like it's really cool so I
just found the third Wiseman I'm really
excited about it
where was it yeah in the dream you see

I'm getting dizzy time to go the other

suite yeah go get a broom

buddy
poll question when do you put your
Christmas tree away let us know in Nepal
well I think there still might be some
pine needles in here but we vacuumed
many times trying to clean up all of the
tree stuff and now we're heading out for
some adventures so our community has a
Christmas tree recycling program where
you take your old tree and dump it in a
big pile and then they come through and
mulch all the trees and then they use
that mulch in like our city parks and
walkways and different places so it's
nice skill to feel like we're not just
throwing away the tree Oh somebody left
their lights on it bungee cords off once
angels
goodbye Christmas tree
I know but you can do it
crazy
look at that
we want to go in
yeah I think so we're driving back home

was a little kid we would make homemade
confetti we would bang pots and pans and
I have really good memories of that so

probably have just as much fun here
