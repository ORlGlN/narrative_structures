- Let the games begin.
(triumphant music)
-  There it goes.
(triumphant music)
-  Making it beautiful.
- Trying to make it look different.
- And so we're doing a little photo shoot.
-  Um... (giggles).
(triumphant music)
(cereal crunches)
-  How'd you sleep last night?
- Who got the flowers?
- Good.
-  Laura picked them out for mom
when we went shopping.
How'd you sleep?
- Good.
(laughing) Come on, we're
all eating breakfast.
(cereal crunches)
So what happened to your finger?
- I sprained it while playing dodgeball.
-  And then at school
they wrapped it up for you, right?
- Yeah.
-  Well, how's it feeling today?
- Normal, just be as it's under this.
-  Do you wanna take that off?
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.
- So I can wash my hands.
-  Just try and move
it and how is it feeling?
(Caleb sighs)
Does it hurt still?
- Yeah.
-  I'm sorry it hurts so bad.
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
-  Good job folding, team.
You dancing?
Yeah.
(Janae exclaims happily)
-  Do you want a ponytail?
- Sure.
But that'll come out in
a little bit, right mom?
-  Yep, at the end of
the day, we'll take it out.
- Yep.
- So it's back to out
routines this morning.
The kids are at piano lessons,
and then they have gymnastics tonight.
But we're not sure what
Isaac's going to be able to do
with his pinky, it's really hurting him.
-  Is Granny Jo showing
you how to play the guitar?
- Yep.
- Kind of.
(playful piano music)
- One, two, ready go.
(slow piano music)
-  I love that you're
playing the piano, buddy.
That's a pretty song.
He plays with the pedal.
- It is so cold out here.
The boys are getting their hair cut,
and us girls are headed
to the grocery store
'cause we need a few things.
We actually leave on our
trip in just two days,
so I don't wanna get a bunch of food,
but we still need food.
We are running into the
grocery store to keep warm.
Oh my goodness, you are so big.
(Granny Jo chuckles)
-  Girl party.
(upbeat music)
- So today for lunch, we're
having a chicken noodle soup
and some salad, and some of this bread,
which is an Asiago cheese
bread and they slice it for us.
This is not a good thing.
I just discovered that the grocery store
sells my favorite kind of
cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory
which is, I know I'm a
very exciting person,
Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.
Oh that looks so good.
Check it out.
Lisi, it's a football inside
of an end zone marker.
(Granny Jo laughs)
You see the outline?
-  Look at that.
-  That is fun.
It's so fun having Granny Jo here
and having a extra set of hands to help
and it's just fun to have family around.
Elise loves loading up.
(upbeat music)
Ready to go home and eat lunch?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- So with the new year starting,
I've seen lots of motivational,
inspirational quotes
circulating around the internet,
and one of 'em just keeps
going through my mind,
and it says something about,
do more of what makes you happy in 2018.
So I read that, and I was really thinking,
like, what is it that makes me happy?
And honesty, I think the
things that make me happiest
are the little moments.
Those little tiny moments with my family
that sometimes I'm too busy for,
or sometimes I push it
aside, or rush through,
and so I'm really trying
to savor those moments.
So, I'm gonna take this moment
to read a book to Laura.
Ooh, Good Night Gorilla.
Is that the one you want me to read you?
- Yeah.
-  It's a good pick.
Good Night Gorilla by Peggy Rathmann.
(kiss smacks gently)
Oh no.
We're doing some math today.
Caleb just started math using algebra.
So we're working on place value.
What's this number?
-  481.
-  Good job.
-  You guys playing Rack-O?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
This is a game I played when
I was growing up in Iroplain.
Okay, so you take a card first.
- So, for Johnston Law, we
are here doing some pictures.
We have Gillian, she
does all of our pictures,
And so she's helping us out.
We wanted to get stuff for our webpage
and the Johnston Law Facebook page,
and so we're doing a little photo shoot.
We're trying to get some candid
shots that are really cool.
(upbeat music)
So we keep trying to do candid shots,
and Brett and I just
can't take it serious.
Gillian's like, "Don't smile."
(Gillian giggles)
I can't do it.
-  All right, point
at something on the computer,
like it's interesting.
(camera shutter clicking)
- (chuckles) You gotta point.
-  Not you Brett.
- I wonder if we should switch these.
It's a funny thing with pictures.
You're trying to make it look like,
totally casual and natural,
but it feels awkward.
-  Yeah, stand
there for a minute.
Do hands in pockets.
- Looking at you?
- My back pocket.
-  Um, yeah (laughing).
- You're so stupid.
-  Okay, don't smile.
(laughing)
- Okay.
- Okay.
- This is why I wore
my short sleeve shirt.
- Are you flexing your forearms?
- Yeah (laughing).
-  Okay, now look at each other
and you can talk, no I
just mean, like talking,
like have a conversation.
- Yeah, that's good.
(men laughing)
-  Fist bump, high five.
- Someone just woke up from a nap.
Did you have a good nap?
(Janae gurgles)
Yeah.
- That is so cool.
-  So this is Isaac's team jersey.
And what do you love about your jersey?
- It's reversible.
-  Show us how it works.
Isaac went to his first
basketball practice last night
and he's going to have to miss
some while we're on our trip.
But he's gonna come right back, nice.
Looking good.
- So this isn't sponsored,
but we got an Osmo
coding game for the kids
so they can practice coding
in a real hands-on way.
What do you think about it Isaac?
- I love it, and I'm doing well.
-  Good job.
So it's kind of like playing a video game
but you're coding, right?
-  It's that.
-  Ah, there it goes.
Four, one, two, three, four.
So you coded him all the
way through the whole thing?
-  What?
-  Good job buddy.
You playing with the play dough?
-  Mm hmm.
- I made a perfect cupcake.
-  Let's see it.
Yummy.
(gentle piano music)
This is cool, is this a fire hydrant?
-  Mm hmm.
-  And you have
water coming out of it?
-  Mm hmm.
Well basically,
- This is genius.
You playing with your Granny Jo?
-  This little
piggy went to market,
this little piggy stayed home.
This piggy had roast beef,
this piggy had none.
This piggy went, "wee,
wee, wee, wee, wee,"
all the way home.
-  Yeah.
What's crazy is I can
actually remember my mom
doing that game with me as a little kid.
-  Patty cake,
patty cake, baker's man.
Bake me a cake as fast as you can.
Pat it, and roll it, mark it with a J,
and throw it the oven for Janae today.
- Yay.
- That's fun.
- So we're doing our very final
undecorating of Christmas.
-  That's right.
So we're taking down the
wreath, and the lights,
and Elise is my little helper.
- Yep.
-  Let's do it.
(triumphant music)
- Laura is challenging Granny Jo.
- 'Kay, what do we say?
Let the games begin.
Ah!
(pucks clacking)
Oh!
Oh!
(pucks clacking)
- C, E flat, A flat, G.
C, E flat, A flat, G.
(slow piano music)
Yeah.
- This is awesome.
-  So you do that part,
- Yeah, it's called fute.
- Now watch,
watch Caleb, watch what
Granny Jo's gonna do.
(playful piano music)
- This is awesome!
- It is awesome.
(playful piano music)
(basketball thudding)
-  This is awesome.
-  Yeah, so we're gonna go...
-  (laughing) Yeah!
How's your pinky feel?
- It's feeling fine,
but it's still a sprain.
- So I have these cute sandals,
and since we're going somewhere warm,
I was thinking we could try 'em on her.
She doesn't know what to do with them?
-  Have we told
them where we're going yet?
- I haven't.
Have you told 'em?
- No.
- Have you told 'em?
-  No, don't tell 'em Nae Nae.
She's thinking about it.
- She doesn't know what to do with it.
Okay, I got 'ya.
Jeremy's family is over
here for dinner tonight
and we did pizza and it smells so good
'cause I am so hungry.
- We have pepperoni, supreme,
bacon, chicken and tomato, and cheese.
(gentle whipping)
And Kendra's, we're hiding
it over here for Kendra.
- So Isaac recently had a growth spurt,
which we're really happy for him,
but unfortunately, it
feels like overnight,
he outgrew all of his pants.
And so I am headed to the store,
because in order to pack clothes,
I need to have clothes that fit him.
So hopefully I can find some pants for him
and a few other things.
It's cold out.
(upbeat music)
-  How's your pinky feeling?
- Good.
- Okay.
- The only the only hard part
was the around the world.
-  How did it go?
- Good.
-  Hey, what are you guys doing?
- Making her hair look nice.
-  You're making it beautiful.
- We're trying to make it look different.
- I did like a twist.
-  Maybe we should
cut those bangs off.
(Granny Jo laughs)
-  (laughing)
Gotta cut them bangs.
Princess Leia hair.
- Oh there you go.
-  How was violin?
- Good.
-  I'm so glad
you're doing violin, bud.
- Good night.
J House out.
- Some of our pipes are frozen.
-  Get him!
(Jeremy laughing)
-  Laura is
getting ready for the den.
(upbeat rock music)
