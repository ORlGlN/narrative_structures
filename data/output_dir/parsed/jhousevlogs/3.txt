- I think this next one is gonna get 'em.
(funky music)
(running water)
-  April Fools!
- Okay for this next prank,
I'm gonna have Isaac and
Elise to help me out.
Nae Nae, you wanna help me with the prank?
I'm trying to put this upside down
on the table with the water inside.
Okay, here we go.
(playful music)
(babbling)
So we've pulled a lot of
fun pranks on the kids
over the years.
We have a special breakfast
treat for you this morning.
(children gasp)
- What?
- What?
- It's April Fools.
It's a onion.
(Kendra laughs)
- I'm glad I didn't eat an onion.
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.
-  So what happened?
- I don't know.
- We got mustached.
- You got mustached?
(Kendra yells)
Today, we are celebrating April Fools,
but it's not actually April Fools.
This year, Easter falls on
the same day as April Fools
and we didn't want to do both of them
at the same time
and we didn't want the kids to know
that all these pranks were coming,
so it should be a fun day.
Hey Elise, your chore this morning
is to clean up the table.
- Okay.
How will I do that?
-  Just make sure
to clear off all the cups
and wipe it down.
(playful music)
- Whoa.
-  Just clear off the table, okay?
- Okay.
(cascading water)
-  What happened?
You made a mess.
- It came all the way around.
-  Okay, well get
the other cups off the table.
- How did that happen?
I'm kinda afraid to do this one.
-  Well why don't
you see if the other kids
can help you with it.
- Okay.
-  Yeah.
- I'm trying to clear off the table
and get the cups off.
-  What do you think Caleb?
How can we get the cup cleaned up?
- I though about turning it around.
- I don't know.
Try turning it around.
- But then it will make a spilled mess.
- Maybe not.
- See?
- It's dripping everywhere.
What should we do?
- How did this happen?
- This is so cool.
And hard to clean up.
-  Well, clean it up,
get the cups all cleaned up.
- Okay.
(splashing)
-  That was pretty good.
Thanks for cleaning up the table Elise.
- Mmm-hmm.
How did that even happen?
-  I don't
know, what do you think,
how does that happen?
- Surface tension?
-  Surface tension?
- Did you turn it over?
- How did you get it on there upside down?
-  I don't know,
if you want to try it,
you can try to figure it out.
Who wants to try it?
- Me!
- Me!
- I got a little.
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Very little.
Cubby, you want to try it?
(splashing)
- What the heck?
-  Taking your socks off?
-  Yeah.
-  Nope.
Here comes Laura.
We are making a big mess peeps.
There's water everywhere.
Nae Nae, what's going on?
Alright, you guys want
to see how I did it?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

(playful music)
-  Alright everybody.
Whoa, I almost dropped it.
- Do we have to stir it up more?
-  No I think it's good.
It's just a little frothy on top.
(Janae babbling)
-  It smells like cheese.
-  Do you like it?
- It takes like water with powder in it.
- Did you use the cheese
stuff inside of this?
-  What do you think Laura?
- I hate it.
-  Give it one more big drink.
- Gross.
- Is today April Fools?
-  April Fools.
- Yay, I go it.
I knew it, I knew it.
-  Yeah, Caleb caught us,
there's no question about it.
- When I first tasted it,
I was like Mom fail.
-  This is gross.
Lise's first drink, she
was like, it's pretty good.
Get some water.
-  Can I pour it out?
-  Sure.
- They did something to the water.
(running water)
(funky music)
- What happened?
- What?
- What?
How did you do that?
(running water)
- What happened?
- Caleb's is regular.
-  How does it taste, is it gross?
- No, it's just water.
- It tastes like water.
-  April Fools!
(Jeremy laughs)
Do you guys want me to show you again?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  We just took food coloring gel
and put it up there.
(laughing)
(babbling)
- Toothpaste!
- Toothpaste.
- Right here.
- Toothpaste.
(spitting)
-  Mom, they're super good.
-  One two three.
(laughing)
- You guys got me!
You got me.
- It's a--
(splash)
(screaming)
(laughing)
- You got a little wet buddy.
So with the kids getting older and wiser,
it's getting harder and
harder to prank them.
But I think this next one
is gonna get 'em.
Check out what Kendra bought.
We're gonna have fun with these.
- Alright, so I know we've been having
a lot of discussions about
iPads and technology use,
and your dad and I have been
really thinking about it.
And we decided that for today
we're going to give you unlimited use
of the eye pad.
(cheering)
Oh shhh, Janae's sleeping.
So we actually got a new
eye pad for each of you
and you guys can use it as
much as you want all day.
So what do you guys think of that plan?
- It's so awesome.
- I'm really excited.
- But would it be only for today?
-  Well, I mean
you can use it tomorrow too
if you want to.
- Forever let's use it!
-  Forever?
- I'm gonna do lots of
iPad time, can I Daddy?
- You can sleep with it at night.
This eye pad, as much as you
want to, it's yours to have.
- Here are your new eye
pads for each of you.
- Oh it's a pad for the eye.
-  An eye pad for
you, an eye pad for you,
an eye pad for you.
(Kendra laughs)
You can use them as much as
you want all day, every day.
- It's an eye pad.
-  It's an eye pad.
- I can use this.
- I can't open it.
-  Have fun with your eye pad.
-  April Fools!
You can use it as much as you want today.
Alright, do you guys want
some real iPad time now?
-  Yeah.
-  Let's do it.
- Oh my gosh, there's even pickles in it.
- Yeah.
- Is this a prank?
-  Those are chicken nuggets
from McDonald's look.
McDonald's put a pickle
in your chicken nugget?
So there's a restaurant you guys
that makes fried pickles.
And we thought we would
prank you for April Fools.
- April Fools!
- April Fools!
- Okay so it's a new recipe,
so I'm gonna want you guys
to all try it together.
- I can't eat it.
(playful music)
- It's foam.
- It's a bread!
-  Kendra cut up these sponges
and then put chocolate frosting on them.
-  Thank you
Mom for giving us foam.
-  It's real chocolate frosting.

special cake for tonight
I'm really excited about it.
It's a new recipe.
- Alright, here we go.
(pop)
(slow mo pop)
- It's a--
-  What do you think it is?
- Like a balloon.
-  What?
Oh they're still going at it.
-  Everyone get some smoothie.
Okay on three, one two three.
- Tastes normal.
-  Guess what we did to it?
- What?
- Nothing.
- Try to guess,
guess what we actually did to it.
-  You added ice?
-  We put a little
bit of dog poo in it.
- In real life?
- Dog poo?
-  Just a little bit (laughs).
- In real life?
-  No, not at
all, I'm just kidding.
It's a normal smoothie.
- Good.
- I think they're trying to prank me.
It's not obvious at all.
-  They asked Jeremy
to carry this large bowl
of water outside to the swing,
so they could feed the worms.
- Very thirsty worms out there.
(playful music)
- Right here.
- Yeah, we're gonna push you.
Hold on.
(Kendra laughing)
- Ah!
It's so cold!
(laughing)
Okay for this next prank,
I'm gonna have Isaac
and Elise help me out.
We picked up some pizza for dinner.
Do you remember what we did to you guys
a couple of years ago,
where, we--
was it donuts?
- With the donuts?
-  Yeah, with the donuts.
Do you remember what it was?
- Broccoli in it.
-  Yeah, we're gonna
do that to Laura and Caleb.
I'm gonna take out one of these pizzas
and put in just a bunch
of carrots and vegetables
and we'll put the camera in there
and then we open it, it's like what?
Okay, help me out.
(lively playful music)
-  Well we put it in the oven.
-  Any carrots and
vegetables, grab 'em up.
And carrots.
- And this.
-  Yeah here, this one.
- Use this one.
-  Do a couple of these.
Okay, so we'll just set these up.
Go get 'em, go get 'em.
- Time for dinner.
-  Dinner's ready.
Dinner's ready.
- Dinner!
-  Go ahead and grab your pizza
and then we'll say a prayer.
-  April Fools!
- April Fool.
- They don't even care,
they're like, we just want pizza.
Not every prank went
exactly as we had planned,
but we had fun today.
-  What?
What did you think Laura?
- I liked it, I liked it.
- You like celery and carrots.
- Did the store do it or you?
-  We did it.
- Tricky tricky, does that mean
here's another pizza somewhere?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah, it's in the oven.
- Awesome.
Goodnight, J House out.
(Jeremy gasps)
-  Oh no.
- Uh-oh
(playful music)
-  Yeah.
Brown, gray and yellow.
- I got pink, my favorite color.
