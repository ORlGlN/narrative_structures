-  This is quite the project.
- I was wrong!
- I'm just sitting here smiling.
- A ice cream cone.
- Woo!
- One more visitor coming
to stay with us tonight.
- What's waiting for us in the house.
- Good morning.
The best news of my morning today
is that I miss the sunrise.
Our kids have been waking
up so early this whole trip.
And Laura came in this
morning and she's like,
the sun's already up.
And Jeremy and I are like, yes! Thank you.
When I was at Trader Joe's I saw these.
They're called scallion pancakes.
You're supposed to flip
these halfway through.
They smell so good.
And then they said to squeeze them.
He caught me.
I'm taste testing the cinnamon toast.
-  Yummy.
- So good.
- It's good.
- (babbling)
- Nanae's a fan.
-  What do you think Caleb?
- Not my favorite.
-  Not your favorite?
- Yummy.
- Yummy.
-  You like it?
- I like it.
-  You're hanging out
while they're doing yoga?
- Let's try balancing lower. Like this.
- Well it looks beautiful out here.
The neighbor's are doing their roof,
so it's been a little bit
loud with construction.
- Yay you like out tree?
Waahh.
(upbeat music)
-  Elise, what you doing?
- I'm writing a note to
one of my best friends.
-  So the other day the
kids picked out postcards
and they are writing
letters to their friends.
Oh, who's this one to?
- Lydia.
-  You gonna tell
her how much you love her
and miss her?
- Yeah.
-  Is that to Luke?
- Mhm.
- I'm gonna do another one.
-  Who do you
wanna write to this time?
- Um, Michael.
- Now I need to know that
we're at Coronado island
so I wanna give him this one.
-  Okay.
(upbeat music)
- Dad would you like a ice cream cone?
-  Why thank you.
- On a hot day?
-  What flavor is it?
- Chocolate.
-  Yummy.
- I'm gonna go ask mom.
-  So check out
these seashells I found.
- They almost look like a butterfly.
- Yeah they do. They're still
connected to each other.
Look, I love how shiny they are inside.
- I actually found a broken one of those.
- Yeah, it's hard to find them together.
- I love hunting for seashells.
It's probably my favorite
thing to do at the beach.
Jeremy's joining in the fun.
That's when you know
it's gonna get serious.
- I'll get you some water after I'm done
building my sandcastle.
-  She's trying.
Yeah you're doing a great job.
Didn't work?
We'll teach you how to do it.
Watch dad. You gotta pack it in real good.
- Yes! My first sandcastle.
-  It is awesome!
You got it, dude.
Oh, that looks yummy.
- Yay!
-  You did it.
Oh, are you making a mote around it?
You did it, nice work dude.
- Okay I'm gonna find a seashell.
- I'm getting dirt over
here but I'm also gonna make
shark indentation.
-  Shark.
- Gotta show the kids that you
can do art out of digging too
-  Ah.
Janae is so content at the beach.
She just its here and touches the sand
and tries to shovel.
Oh that was good!
She gets the idea.
Nanae's on the move.
What did you find?
- Seashell!
-  Found a seashell.
You're pushing real hard, I can tell.
(gasps)
(screeches)
Is this your secret?
- You gotta add water appropriately.
- Yay!
Oh.
-  You just need more.
You just need more,
guys, run run, get more.
- Woo!
- You did it!
- That was amazing. I
didn't think it would work.
-  Feeling pretty triumphant?
- Yeah, that's pretty good.
- Apparently Janae is
known as the destroyer.
Yay!
Janae's getting more and more brave,
adventuring further and further.
Jeremy's recruited all of the children.
They're all helping.
We're not professionals.
Apparently there's an actually
sandcastle building contest
here in San Diego.
- Oh that was terrible.
-  And we're not part of it.
- Yeah.
-  They're getting water.
So we're in La Hoya today,
which is the same place
where we saw the seals in
the sea lions recently.
So if you haven't seen that vlog,
it happened just over here.
See where the land goes
out that direction?
That's the little seal rock.
And we're up on La Hoya shores.
I'm really enjoying being
in a place long enough
to kind of get to know the general area.
Like the names of all the different cities
and the beaches and
kind of the coast line.
It's just fun to me.
- Hi dad.
- Caleb.
-  He's got some
serious sand going on.
- Everyone's gonna bury me.
- Her head is gonna stay like that.
And we're gonna bury in the rest of her,
so come get her feet buried in.
-  Teamwork,
they are burying Elise.
- Push it in.
-  Elise!
- Don't step on her.
- Look at her!
(laughing)
- I'm gonna get Elise buried completely.
-  I think she's a little nervous.
-  She does not know what to think.
What is this?
You ready to get out of there?
- No.
-  Is it comfy?
- Yeah.
-  All right Elise
is ready to emerge.
- She emerged from the dead!
- She's alive.
-  Maybe go clean off in the ocean.
- Yeah.
- This little girl loves the water.
-  Put me down.
- Woo!
So I didn't put her in
her swimsuit this time,
cause I didn't think she'd get wet.
Mom fail.
You see that happy face?
Woo!
Jeremy and the big kids are
headed out to the water.
The water is so cold.
That seagull is on our
blanket looking for goodies.
This is quite the beautiful hole.
I like how you can see
all the different layers
of the sand.
- I'm gonna make it as tall as you.
Maybe deeper.
-  You think you can do that?
- I thought I was gonna hit cone.
-  Nope, we are at the beach.
You can just keep digging.
- Forever?
-  Well let's
see how far you can go.
Oh that's a pretty rock.
So these kids have been
working on a big project.
They're building a tunnel.
So it goes down,
and it actually goes through.
- Hi!
-  This is quite the project.
So are you guys just making it deeper now?
We wanna try and get it where
a person could go through it.
We might run out of sunshine.
- While we're here, Isaac and Elise and I
are going for a run.
The big kids and I ran
down to the pier and back.
That was a good run.
Unfortunately, the day
is coming to an end soon.
Okay, there we go.
All right, they wanna show
you how the tunnel goes
all the way through. Hi Caleb.
That's quite the tunnel. Good work.
I think I'm gonna go rinse off.
You are covered in sand.
- Yeah, it's like in my fingernails.
-  It's in your beard.
- Yeah.
-  Well we are getting
a little bit tired out.
I know. Too much beach.
You ready to go home?
Well we are covered in sand,
and headed home to take showers.
And we have one more visitor
coming to stay with us tonight.
- Move out. Hut two three four.
Hut two three four.
- Using baby powder to clean
off the sand totally works.
I just used it on Janae,
and I put her into her car
seat all like silky smooth
and I just used it on my feet.
- I've been mocking Kendra, so.
-  He has, he's been mocking me.
- I'll give it a try. Let's see.
-  Oh wow.
You're gonna be really smooth.
You don't need quite that much.
Okay good job.
How's that feel?
- Oh, some of it's coming off.
-  Smooth?
- Its better.
-  Thank you for the tip.
- Well I have to admit,
my feet feel way better
the the baby powder. So I was wrong.
You were right, Kendra.
- Thank you.
- I was wrong.
- I'm just sitting here smiling.
- So we're taking the scenic drive home.
Partially because it's rush hour,
and the freeway would be busy,
but also because Jeremy and I both love
finding new ways to get places.
- Like look at that house.
- Look at that view.
We love exploring, and
luckily, GPS navigation
has made that a lot easier.
Okay, this one's called
La Hoya scenic drive.
Look at that.
Well Elise just offered
to donate all of her money
to help us buy a house here in San Diego.
Apparently she really likes it here.
We just got word that our
visitor already arrived.
He's waiting for us at the house.
You guys, who's coming?
- Poppy Rod!
-  Who's Poppy Rod?
- My dad.
-  He's here.
-  We're wet, and
we're covered in sand.
There he is.
- Hey!
- There they are.
- Whoa!
Let's get rid of that sand.
Get rid of some of that sand.
Get rid of that.
Football manager of the year.
Look at you.
And I see chap.
Come on out. Oh.
-  Nanae's super excited to see you.
- So for dinner tonight, we're
having carne asada burritos.
They look amazing.
- This for her birthday
that I missed. Mwah.
- She just had her birthday here.
-  Just barely.
-  And what's coming up tomorrow?
- My birthday!
- Your birthday.
Warning.
- Warning. This birthday surprise.
I love you Elise.
Happy birthday.
- That says tickle me.
(card meowing)
- What?
- Thank you.
- Oh you're welcome.
- I like it.
-  Nanae loves animals.
This card is her favorite
thing in the world.
- Yeah it's a kitty.
Well we know what to get
her for her birthday.
A card. That looks like an animal.
- Thank you.
- Oh you're so welcome.
-  For your last day
of being a three year old,
you wanna give us a J House out?
- Goodnight J House out.
- So these shirts are dyed in chocolate.
- Donuts.
-  Should we go get some donuts too?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- Pop-Tart donuts.
This is half of it.
- Y O!
