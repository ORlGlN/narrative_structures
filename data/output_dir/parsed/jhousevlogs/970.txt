-  Elise?
Elise, it's snowing, look.
- Wow!
-  It's beautiful, huh?
- I want to play out there right now.
-  Should we go
out and play out there?
- Yeah.
-  We gotta eat
breakfast first, okay?
("Dance Of The Sugarplum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)
- It snowed.
-  Did it snow?
- And now we're gonna
build a snowman, a big one.
-  You ready?
- For the snow!
-  Lets see your little outfit.
- So...
November was a little bit of a crazy month
and I neglected the ever important chore
of figuring out the winter stuff.
So here we have our first snow
and I have all of this stuff (laughs)
and I have no idea what fits who
and it's kind of a mess.
Thankfully we've been
donated a lot of stuff,
like people gave us hand-me-down's,
and we love hand-me-down's,
but it also means there's
no order to the chaos.
I have no idea what we have.
So we'll see what happens.
Finally have all the kids dressed.
Caleb, show me your outfit!
There he is.
So we found something for everybody
but unfortunately Elise fits
Isaac's boots from last year
and Isaac fits Elise's grow-in
boots that somebody gave us
so they're barbie boots.
But he's being a good sport about it.
(gentle acoustic instrumental music)
- Snowball fight!
-  Ow!
(giggling)
Oh, good shot!
Ooh, nice snow angel, Lisee.
So good.
Did you feel like you were left out?
(laughing and yelling)
Woo!
Aaaaah!
(laughs) Did you trap me?
-  Are you just eating the snow?
- Camera fight?
Oh, at the face, Jeremy.
You're going brutal.
Okay let me have the baby,
let me have the baby.
No, mommy gets the baby.
- This snow is amazing.
It only takes one hand
to pack a whole snowball.
Oh, good shot!
We were taking a picture...
(thump)
(laughing) They're slammin' me!
No, no!
In the face!
No!
(laughing and squealing)
I'm gonna go into the fort.
I'm gonna go into our
fort and really get 'em.
My secret hideout.
- I'm hunting.
-  You're hunting?
- I'm hunting Dad.
Ow, no!
In the neck!
The back of the neck!
(laughing)
(jazz version of "We Wish
You A Merry Christmas")
-  Good pushing,
you push that snow.
You helping, Cub?
Where's your gloves, dude?
You can't get it big?
- Come help Isaac.
-  Lisee, you helping dad?
(grunting)
- It think this is a good spot.
Two, three, let's roll it up.
Alright, here's our snowman.
What do you think, Isaac, was that fun?
-  Yeah, can we do
a snowball fight some more?
-  Sure.
-  Good job, boys, good job.
What a helper!
(sniffles)
-  So not your
typical snowy weather activity
but when you wanna ride a tricycle,
you ride a tricycle, right, Caleb?
- Uh-huh.
(wheels squeaking)
- So what we've told the kids
is that the house has to
be super clean this weekend
because Christmas is coming.
But really the house has to be super clean
because a surprise is coming.
- It's exciting.
- So, short story, our house
has to look really good...
By tomorrow.
- So one of the things that we did
is go through all of our paperwork.
-  There's a mountain.
- This entire room was covered in paper.
We had every mortgage statement
of the last eight months,
because we've had it stacked
up in our to-file pile,
which was this growing lump of death.
-  It's been a disaster.
- It's funny, we would have, like,
a Skype going on with someone
and the lump of death would be back there.
Like, "Let's move it."
So we'd carry (laughs) the to-file pile
out and lean it up against a couch
and then we'd have to move
it back and it keeps growing.
- We've had times in our life
when we stay super on top of filing,
and we have a great filing
system, but it's a slippery slope
and once you start down the slippery slope
it gets overwhelming, and
it grows, and it grows.
And anyway, we finally did it!
We've got, like, three bags of trash
that we're throwing away.
We're so close.
These are like
the "I don't know what to
do with these" papers left.
- I mean, every month
I go through the mail
and we make sure that we're--
-  I go through
the mail when it comes in.
- Yeah, we go through the mail
so that we make sure that we're
paying bills or whatever needs to be done
and honestly most of my
bills are just auto-pay.
So with getting the filing done
and trying to clean the house,
it's going to be a little
bit of a later night for us
but it's gonna be an exciting weekend.
J House out.
(disco music)
-  Everybody to the back.
(thump)
- Oh, my stomach.
-  (laughing) What was that?
