(water bubbling)
(bouncy instrumental music)
- Sorry, we're closed.
- Well, this morning, I was
able to reunite with the kids.
They were excited to see
me, but they are much more
excited to see this little nugget of joy.
(excited giggles)
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
(excited giggles)
- Mwah.
- She missed you guys.
So you guys, there were times
that she would be crying
and really upset, and we
would pull out a picture
of you guys, and she would
just laugh and giggle
at it and calm down.
You reading the "juh-naenae?"
- Yeah.
- So while we were gone, my
mom was here with the kids.
And she taught them some more piano stuff.
(Chopsticks)
(piano plunking)
Pretty good.
-  Bum, bum bum.
- So growing up, my mom
was a piano teacher,
so we always had piano
going on in the background
of my house.
(piano plunking)
-  One, two,
three, four.
-  Nailed it!
- Wait 'til you hear Isaac.
He can play this other part.
(piano plunking)
- One, two, three,
four, five, six
One, two, three
four, five, six.
(piano plunking)
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
One, two, three--
- Hello, good to see you boys.
We missed you.
-  Patty cake, patty cake
baker's man,
bake me a cake as fast as you can.
Pat it and roll it
and mark it with a J
and throw it in the air
for Janae today.
-  Yay!
- Ready?
This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed home.
This little piggy had roast beef--
- So, we're doing a little hike
with Granny Jo this morning.
(gentle guitar music)
This is so cool.
(water bubbling)
(gentle guitar music)
Can you skip some rocks?
(splash)
- These ones make big splashes.
-  Yep.
- Okay, so a small, thin one.
Perfect!
- Yep, that's perfect.
(splash)
- This is flat.
- Yeah, that's perfect.
-  Good job, it's
just like throwin' a frisbee.
That was close.
(splash)
- I hope this works.
-  Hey, it did
a little bit (giggles).
(upbeat instrumental music)
That was like five.
Be very careful, Isaac.
(screams excitedly)
(upbeat instrumental music)
- Bye bye.
- Well, it's time
to say goodbye.
- Mwah.
Goodbye Isaac.
-  I don't wanna get out.
- Okay, you guys gotta
practice your piano, right?
- Mm hmm.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- And you're gonna work
on your violin, right?
You're gonna work on your gymnastics?
- We're so grateful to have
grandparents that can watch
the kids when we're gone because
it just makes it so lovely
for the kids and for us.
(lawnmower puttering)
♫ I see you
♫ I see you
Nothing says "Welcome home
from vacation" like doing
four loads of laundry, but
that's what I did already today.
We, as a family, are now
going to fold four loads
of laundry.
The question is, how
long is it gonna take us?
Put your guesses down
in the comments below.
We are gonna time ourselves.
Let's do this.
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!
-  J House!
-  Let's do this!
♫ I got that sunshine in my pocket
♫ I got that good song in my feet
(upbeat instrumental music)
Well, the boys are pretty excited today.
- Tell 'em what we're doin'.
- We're doin' Fantasy Football.
- This is Isaac's first time.
We're doin' the draft right now.
-  It's gonna be a fun season.
How many weeks is it?
- It's 13 weeks until the
playoffs, and then you
do a play off round.
-  Well, go team.
Did you get your top player?
- No, you have to get the
first pick because everyone
was goin' for him.
-  Got it.
- So, there's 12 teams
and it's all my family.
My brothers, my dad,
my family,
- Nephews.
- yeah, nephews.
So it's super fun.
We're all trash talkin' each other.
- They're goin' down.
-  Caleb, are you on dad's team?
- He's my helper.
- It's my turn.
I'm gonna go with Derek Carr.
- Derek Carr?
- He's gettin' a quarterback.
Good choice.
(computer chimes)
- Daddy it's our turn.
- It's my turn.
Let's see, so I have like a
cheat sheet that I can look at
that kinda shows me the value of people.
I don't have it all memorized.
-  Like Isaac.
- Yeah.
(computer chimes)
Did you just draft a player?
- Yeah.
- Good job.
So we're getting pictures in from all over
the different places where our family
is doing Fantasy Football.
It's just fun to see that
we're all doing this together
and being able to interact in this way.
And Isaac was really the
one who spawned this.
He wanted
- Yeah.
to do Fantasy Football,
he's been asking for years.
And so everyone agreed to do it
because Isaac really wanted it.
- Yeah.
-  So I bet you
wish you could do a draft
every single day.
- Oh yes!
-  That would be pretty cool.
(chuckles)
Check out this hat.
I got it at Playlist and
Jeremy actually got it,
and then I tried it on
and I really like it.
And he was so sweet,
he's letting me wear it.
- I think that you're hot with a hat on.
I hope you wear it every day.
- Make videos every day.
So it's a YouTube hat.
We are headed to Lelo's
which is the shaved ice place
that we've been going this summer.
It's the last day that they're open.
-  Boo.
- They're closing.
So we have to go and get our last fix.
So Jeremy forgot his wallet
and I don't have my wallet
in the diaper bag yet from
our trip that we just went on
'cause I don't take it on trips.
So we pull up, we unload
the kids, we're like,
"No, we're gonna have to go home!"
But I dug down to the bottom
of my purse and I keep
an emergency 20 in there
for just such times as this.
And then we found a
few dollars in the car,
so we cannot go over $24.
- They don't have shaved ice.
-  What?
- They don't have shaved ice.
-  They don't have any shaved ice?
Laura, you're right.
So Makayla says they really
don't have shaved ice.
- Yeah, we ran out.
There was so many people.
-  Oh no!
Do you still have soda?
- Yes.
-  And ice cream?
- Yes.
-  Yay, floats it is!
- Yay, I can have a root beer!
- Well, with it being closing
day today, it was so crazy
busy that they did run out of shaved ice.
But they have sodas, which was
my favorite treat all summer,
so I'm actually still
really thrilled about this.
So, we're gonna do root
beer floats with our kids.
But root beer with
coconut flavoring in it?
- The thing I love most
about Lilo's though,
we just talked with the
owner, and the husband is
in dental school, the wife is a blogger,
and they're just entrepreneurs
and they have that spirit
of creating something.
And I wanna support that.
- And they did it
so well.
It's just been wonderful.
Okay, we better order our
food or we're gonna lose
our place in line.
(happy instrumental music)
-  I love this soda.
- Mm mm mm.
-  So, last day of work
at Lilo's.
- Yeah, kinda sad.
- But she's busy with high school.
(grunts)
-  Now pull it out.
-  This is like the
opposite of a ribbon cutting.
You're shutting 'em down.
- Sorry, we're closed.
- J House out.
-  Janae's learning a new game.
-  Peek-a-boo!
(percussive music)
