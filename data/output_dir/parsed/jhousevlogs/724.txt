good morning so the kids are getting
ready to head off to their home school
Academy and Kendra last night did a lot
of the preparation she made their little
lunches and I just found these little
notes insane how fun is that all right
so on the drive to school this morning
it's been raining and what did you guys
see in the sky rainbow a rainbow
let's see I'll see if I can show it to
you guys it's not gone it's right there
oh it's kind of faint in the camera but
it is so beautiful I'm so grateful for
pretty rainbows anyway you guys excited
for school today yeah we are our
families early must be a miracle all
right well the big kids are dropped off
which begins my day of adventure with
these two you're gonna do now we're
finger-painting with shaving cream a
very brave library
so I had to dive in and try it - it
looked like too much fun and it was
really like really fun I can see what he
does want to stop all the other kids
have cleared out and caleb is still
still working on cubby one didn't help

insisted on carrying it can I help you

in the crock-pot Hugh hot mama
alright let's put in a crock-pot up here
oh I had a really good time at the park
it was with a newer group of friends
that I don't know super well and so I
come home and I don't know if you guys
do this but kind of like second guessing
things like I'm like blue I don't know
if that story that I told was really
that funny arrow I kind of laughed too
hard when that person said bad or anyway
I just feel kind of self-conscious like
making your friends as funny as I'm like
watching and trying to teach my kids how
to cultivate new friendships and then as
an adult like it's still something
you're working on and gaining confidence
in and knowing how to interact normally
with people so anyway that's in my mind
are you learning heads dance from your
mother yeah yeah there we are hurt at
the Garden Club yesterday the kids
picked the green beans and then they got
sent home with us for free and so we're
just going to go through and pick out
the ones that are really good and you
know get them ready to eat with our
dinner tonight all right the kids are
getting pretty good at sorting the green
beans oh I love it when there's simple
ways to involve the kids with dinner
it's always a ton more work for me but
it's not learning
okay I never really good one
Caleb what are you doing I'm trying to
plant oh you're just trying to plant it

while my friends it was amazing to see
how many people eat chips and salsa
cereal that was really validating so
thanks for sharing and many of you have
been asking about my trial how it went
last week unfortunately we don't know
yet the judge hasn't decided
he took it under advisement but it went
really well it couldn't have been much
better on cross-examination what we were
able to get the other guy to admit to so
