- It's too fun up here,
everybody had to join.
(upbeat music)
-  So that was all
found inside of a bird.
That's so cool.
(upbeat music)
So we're coming up this
morning for a service project
of cleaning up the beach.
(upbeat music)
- What do you think we got this from?
- At the beach?
-  At the beach,
that's a great guess.
You know what, this was actually
found inside of a baby bird.
-  Oh no.
-  Inside of a
bird called the albatross.
Unfortunately, they sometimes
think that trash is food.
It ends up being pretty small.
-  That was all
found inside of a bird.
(rock music)
- Oh look, it's a green Kiss wrapper.
-  Good find.
- Dad look.
What is that?
-  That is trash.
It was someone's inside of their shoe.
(upbeat music)
- Today we're coming out to Broadway Pier
and we're gonna take the
ferry over to Coronado Island.
We're running a little bit late
and so Jeremy dropped us off
and he's gonna find parking
and then just run to catch up with us.
So I'm trying to manage the five kids
and find tickets for the ferry.
Luckily the big kids are super helpful.
Elise is holding Laura's hand,
Isaac's pushing the stroller,
Caleb's keeping up and I
think we wanna go on the pier.
So this is the boat
that we're looking for.
We're trying to take the noon one.
We found the place and
we bought the tickets,
now we just have to hope that Jeremy
and Poppy Rod make it here on time.
- Thank you.
Please watch your step down there.
(upbeat music)
-  She's all eager.
- This is gonna be fun.
(upbeat music)
- Wow, that was short.
- No, we haven't left the pier yet.
We're not there yet.
- They're just turning around.
- She's like, was that Coronado Island?
Not yet.
(upbeat music)
- I can see that we turned like that.
- Is this the beach?
-  Well there is some beach.
This is Coronado Island.
(upbeat music)
- I took a picture.
-  Awesome.
- There's a seal
or a sea lion.
- So we found a place where we could
actually rent bikes for all of our family.
It was not an easy thing to find.
That's the coolest helmet I've ever seen.
- Perfect.
-  You all set?
Oh my goodness, you look so cute.
-  That one won't fit will it?
- No, I have a big head like Daddy.
- That's where all the brains are.
-  That might be a little too big.
You are set.
He's hooking up a bike carrier.
Is that where you're gonna ride?
Who are you gonna ride with?
- Nae-nae.
-  Caleb, you watching?
That is it.
- Alright, Raoul's got you going there,
Brian's got you going there.
(upbeat music)
- Good job Cub.
- Yeah.
-  I can't get over
this cute crew in front of me.
Tandem bikes, there's so
many people biking here.
Janae fell asleep.
Oh, maybe she's not asleep.
(upbeat music)
- So Kendra's loving looking at all
these houses as we drive
through Coronado Island.
(upbeat music)
Well I'm so happy that
riding the bikes worked.
Kendra and I had talked about it
and I honestly didn't
know if it would work.
But it did and that was
a really cool experience.
- That might be one of the favorite things
that we've done so far.
I enjoyed it so much.
I really want one of those pina coladas.
We found a pizza place and we are hungry.
Check this out.
Yum!
(upbeat music)
How it it?
- Yummy.
-  She's a dipper,
she likes to dip it.
-  She's eating too.
- Well the sun is starting to set
and the wind is coming up
and it is getting chilly.
We saw this and Jeremy wants it.
- Let's pick a caramel apple to cut up.
-  I've never seen
a Reese's apple before.
That makes a lot of sense.
- That has to be good because
peanut butter apple is good.
-  That makes a lot of sense.
(jazzy music)
- Oh this is good.
-  So the kids are sampling
the virgin pina coladas.
- That's delicious.
-  What about me?
-  You have a sharp knife.
-  We decided to
try the Reese's apple.
(jazzy music)
Wow!
That's so cool.
(jazzy music)
-  Pineapple.
You like the pineapple?
Kinda messy.
How is it.
- Sometimes I splurge.
This is a splurge item,
but it was worth it.
I'm very, very happy about this.
-  How often do you get to drink
a pina colada out of a pineapple.
- It's very good.
- In other news, Reese's
caramel apple was amazing.
I don't know why they
don't make more of those.
It was really delicious.
(upbeat music)
Getting on the ferry.
(upbeat music)
So what do you think of Coronado Island?
- I would love to spend time on the beach.
It looked really nice.
-  It was a beautiful beach.
So with the wind, it's
kinda chilly right now.
So most everybody wants to be below deck.
But Elise and Caleb want to go up top,
so I'm taking them.
We should have brought our jackets.
You're coming too?
I love my little adventurers.
So the kids just discovered that
we can go up around the front.
What?
Don't loose your shoes.
(slow guitar music)
Oh look at the kites.
People are flying fun kites right there.
- I'm as tall as you.
(giggles)
(slow guitar music)
-  I'm touching
the very edge of the boat.
-  Caleb's on the
very edge of the boat,
you holding on tight?
I love how excited Caleb is
and I'm not taking my arms off of him.
- We're in the very front.
- It's too fun up here,
everybody had to join.
(slow guitar music)
- Well that was a lot
of fun and I'm tired.
Say goodnight, J House out.
- Goodnight, J House out.
- Goodnight, J House out.
(slow guitar music)
- This is not a good place for me to come
and learn about what's lying in the ocean.
-  Right where we were at.
(upbeat music)
-  This is a shark
egg, this thing right here.
