(laughter)
(orchestral music)
-  We doing oatmeal this morning?
Nae-nae, you wanna try some oatmeal?
So we were supposed to be
cleaning up the front room
and the basement all together.
This is what ended up happening.
♪ Pocket full of posies ♪
♪ We all fall down ♪
She's like, I'll just stand.
(giggles)
Show me your new trick.
We have moved her little
baby gate that we had here
'cause she is just flying down the stairs.
(laughter)
- See what I mean?
-  Good job Nae-nae.
- I can't even do it faster than her.
(laughter)
(upbeat music)
We have the amazing Nae-nae.
-  Did she put it on herself?
- Yeah.
-  Hey.
-  It's a football helmet.
-  She likes that hat.
Good job cleaning up down here you guys.
(upbeat music)
- So I am so sore today.
My workout yesterday must
have been more intense
than I realized because every movement,
every time I bend or step
up a stair, I'm like ahhh.
(upbeat music)
- Fancy Nancy and the
Fanciest Doll in the Universe.
Do you have siblings?
That's Fancy Nancy for sister or brother.
(piano music)
We scheduled a field
trip to the local water
treatment plant to learn
how water comes out
clean from the faucet.
The nerd that I am, I am super
excited to learn about it.
- I think it's amazing that
we live in a day and age
where we don't know what
happens to our water.
And we want to know what
happens to our water.
We just take it for granted.
We turn on the faucet and it comes out.
But what's the processes behind that?
We decided to figure it out.
(upbeat music)
-  So this is
what makes it possible
for us to turn on our
faucet and have clean water.
(upbeat music)
Whoa.
Look straight down you guys.
That's the water right down there.
(upbeat music)
So five miles away, there is
an underground water supply
in wells and they pump
the water from there
five miles away in pipes
up to this right here.
So the line comes into
the water in the middle
to help separate the
calcium out of the water.
(upbeat music)
So then the cleaner water
is gonna exit right there.
It's leaving.
(upbeat music)
Then they add chlorine
into the water here.
- I'm making dinner right now.
We're having some people over tonight
and I'm keeping it really simple.
We're having pasta, red and white pasta,
which is one of our favorites,
rolls, salad, veggies, done.
Here's the red and white
pasta before the red's added.
It's a creamy sauce on the noodles.
Then I pour the red sauce on top.
- So for the community we live in,
this plant pumps over nine
million gallons a day.
You think of a gallon of
milk, nine million of those
run through here everyday.
(upbeat music)
So the filtering that they use is really
just sand that the water distills through
and that pulls iron and other materials
out of the water that we don't want
until it trickles at the bottom
and distills into more pure water.
(upbeat music)
That holds some of the chlorine that gets
pumped into the water.
(upbeat music)
So this is where they add the
fluoride to help our teeth.
So you don't have as many cavities.
- The more you drink, doesn't that mean
the more your teeth are better?
(upbeat music)
-  So after the
water goes through all that
it sits here underneath us as clean water,
the type that we would
drink out of our faucet.
So Isaac, Elise, why do you
think they've covered this one?
- So air can't get into it?
- So it stays cleaner.
- Yep, keep it clean.
So in this building they
have pumps that help
take the clean water and
pump it to the water towers
that are here in our community.
Then once the water is
sitting in the water tower,
gravity allows the
pressure to get the water
into the homes of the community.
So Laura, where does the
water come from that we drink?
- From God.
-  How did God get it to us?
- I don't know.
-  He just made it come out?
- He has power to create everything.
-  So when Janae
is going down the stairs,
her little skirt rides high.
It's so funny.
There we go.
There we go.
How's the ball?
(upbeat music)
Did it land on your foot?
There we go.
(upbeat music)
- It's so much different to drink water
than it used to be
after learning about it.
-  Do you taste the
chlorine and the fluoride?
- Yes, because now I
know that it's in there
so I was like looking for
it and I can taste it.
-  Making snow balls.
- Or mud balls.
Tomorrow they're gonna be all crunched up.
- So before everybody
wakes up in the nighttime,
we're gonna come out here with-
- Laura, I thought you were
not supposed to tell them.
(laughter)
-  You guys were
planning to come out
in the middle of the night?
- So right now I'm going to ballet
and in ballet, we are
practicing our performance.
(upbeat music)
- The weather is absolutely
amazing out today
and so while Isaac and I
are waiting for Elise's
ballet class, we decided
to find a nice trail
and go on a walk together.
So we're just kind of exploring back here.
There's a whole network of trails
and we're trying to find some fun places
to come back and ride bikes as a family.
And also we're looking for places to creek
as the weather gets warmer.
- There's a waterfall on that big creek.
-  You think that
would be fun to go creeking in.
I wonder how you get down there.
I mean I think we just hike.
This looks like a super
fun spot to go creeking.
(guitar music)
I think we found a spot to go in.
Whoa, that's steep.
Okay, we'll have to find
a different spot to go in.
(guitar music)
I'm relieved, it's starting
to finally feel like spring.
(guitar music)
-  Goodnight, J House out.
- Ready, set, go.
(upbeat music)
(speaking Spanish)
- Wow!
(giggling)
