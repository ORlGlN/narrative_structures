(energetic music)
- I think I have a heart attack.
(kids screaming)
(energetic music)
(peaceful music)
- So I'm out at the gym this morning
and it was cold outside,
like below freezing.
(energetic music)
(balls hitting wall)
Good morning, Nae Nae.
How'd you sleep, buddy?
- Good.
-  You're just waking up?
(kids clapping)
(peaceful music)
- Mwah!
(kids clapping)
-  She's clapping.
She's clapping!
One, two, ready go!
♫ Twinkle twinkle little star
♫ How I wonder what you are
♫ Up above the world so high
♫ What you are
(girl giggling)
Family band coming out on iTunes soon.
(whooshing)
-  Where's your body hurt?
- Throat.
-  We've got
some sympathy sickness
over here, I think.
- And my heart is feeling--
- I'm sick.
-  And your heart's feeling weird?
- Mm hm.
- My heart is sick too.
-  Your heart is sick?
- Yeah.
-  How did your heart get sick?
- I think I have a heart attack.
-  Yeah?
Are you worried about that
'cause Papa had a heart attack?
- Mm hm.
(yelling)
- You know what?
Caleb, you're not gonna
have a heart attack.
- It's common for kids.
- It's not common for kids.
I can still tell that the
kids are pretty affected
by Papa's heart attack.
Just that they're concerned about it,
worried about it, they've
still been talking about it,
asking if Papa's better.
And then today when Caleb
said his throat was hurting,
he also said his heart was hurting
and he's worried he's
having a heart attack too.
These things that we go through
affect each child so differently.
Well we'll keep a close eye on you, okay?
(whooshing)
So when my sister Tiffany came
for our big special event,
she brought stuff to do a
fun activity with the kids
and we ended up not having time for it.
So we're gonna do that activity today.
So this morning, we're going
to make homemade lava lamps.
Step one, empty the bottle.
-  Keep going that
direction and you'll get it.
(soft music)
- Do you really expect
us to drink all this?
-  Yup.
I'm just joking.
You're almost done, you're almost there.
Keep going, keep going!
- Pour a little out.
(water pouring)
- Step two, fill the bottle three quarters
of the way full with vegetable oil.
- Is this three quarters?
-  I think so.
Alright Isaac, where do you
think three quarters is?
- Well, that's about half.
I think it'd be about right here.
-  Perfect.
(soft music)
- Stop!
Whoa.
(soft music)
- Stop!
- Step three, add water.
You want to leave one
inch open at the top.
- Watch what happens with water and oil.
What's gonna be on top,
the water or the oil?
-  Oil.
- Let's see.
- Oil.
(fun music)
And then the water's down here.
(fun music)
- Ooh!
- There it is.
- Look!
It's like a, water.
It's beautiful.
(fun music)
- I'm getting nervous the kids are gonna
knock these over while they're open.
I don't want to clean up oil all over.
-  That would be a big mess.
- Yep.
- So everybody be careful!
This morning, I'm wearing my
very first pair of Lu-La-Roo?
Is that how you say it?
Leggings.
LuLaRoe?
I don't know how to say it.
But I'm wearing my very
first pair of those leggings
and I've been like, what is the big deal?
And now I'm like, oh.
Oh, this is the big deal.
They are so comfortable.
I never want to take them off.
So if you notice in the
vlogs that I'm wearing them
all the time, that's why!
It's because they're so comfortable.
Jeremy, I think you would honestly
really enjoy wearing the leggings.
- I've already worn 'em a couple times.
(Kendra laughs)
I'm just kidding.
And this isn't sponsored, by the way.
- Step four, add 10
drops of food coloring.
(clapping)
Food coloring.
Right, Laura.
What color did you choose?
- Red.
- Red?
What color do you think it's gonna turn?
- Pink.
- Yup.
That's what we're hoping for.
-  One, two.
- Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten!
- Good job!
Look at 'em floating!
-  Look, it's
all just sitting there.
- That's awesome.
- That is so cool.
-  There it is!
-  It broke through!
-  It's beautiful.
-  One broke through.
-  It looks like a tornado.
-  Yeah, it does.
- No, that looks like a neck.
I think--
(techno music)
- I'm gonna do green.
Nine, ten.
(techno music)
- Step five, add glitter.
So Aunt Tiffany got us a
fun variety of glitters.
What color glitter?
- Pink.
- It's about to go!
(techno music)
(Elise laughing)
- 'Cause I love glitter.
(techno music)
(family cheering)
- Whoa!
- The last step is to
add Alka-Seltzer tablets
broken up into pieces.
Who can say the word Alka-Seltzer?
- Alka sester.
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Alka sester.
- Alka sester!
- Alka-Seltzer.
(violin music)
-  Guys, look what it's doing!
Oh my goodness.
They're like bubbling up from the bottom!
-  They're like glitter balls.
-  They are.
It's like glitter balls.
- What are we gonna do with the lava?
-  When you shake
it up, it does it again.
(violin music)
- Oh.
-  Oh.
She's processing.
- For Caleb's, we're gonna put
in two instead of just one.
(violin music)
(tablets dropping)
- Look at it bubblin' up!
- Whoa.
Going into big chunks and then coming up.
- Oh.
My.
Goodness.
This is awesome!
(kids giggling)
- Can I have the lid?
-  Are you nervous about the lid?
- Yeah.
(soft music)
(truck running)
(bin rolling)
- I'm gonna put in four!
-  Four tablets.
- What do you think's gonna happen?
- It's gonna explode!
(fun music)
(tablets dropping)
Oh my!
- Look at that!
Look at it go!
- Whoa.
-  Whoa!
(kids screaming)
(energetic music)
-  This is awesome.
-  Well that's what
happens if you put a bunch in.
- No, don't get two!
-  Does it make
you a little nervous?
(Laura crying)
- Sweetheart, sweetheart.
Look.
Look, it's just fine.
It just made a little tiny bit of a mess.
-  It's gonna be fine.
-  That is a lot.
- We can clean it up?
- Of course we'll clean it up.
(techno music)
-  So pretty.
(techno music)
- Thank you, Aunt Tiffany!
- Thank you, Aunt Tiffany!
- Thank you, Aunt Tiffany.
-  Hi, Janae.
Hello!
Oh, we missed you!
(Jeremy kisses Janae)
We're glad you got a good nap, though.
She's like, I want you to hold me.
- Gimme milk.
-  How do I get to Mum?
- Hi.
Mwah.
There's Daddy.
(Jeremy making baby sounds)
The kids are gettin' going
on some more serious school.
Isaac is studying volcanoes today
and he's gonna give a little report
to our family about them.
Caleb is back laying down on the couch,
which lets me know that he really
is not feeling 100 percent.
But he's reading a book
about the Statue of Liberty.
(soft music)
- Root beer is very cheap.
It's one dollar.
- For math today, Elise is
doing the coolest thing.
It's called Menu Math and
she literally has a menu
and then she's doing orders.
So here's the menu, and
then she takes the prices
and fills in the orders for people.
By the way, I love the way
you did your hair today.
- Thank you.
-  So apparently
Jeremy grew a tail.
(kids laughing)
I don't know why anyone
would want to put their heads
that close to Jeremy's bum!
(kids squealing)
Aren't they so funny?
She's gonna be so confused about
what people are supposed to do.
- What are normal people like?
(kids yelling)
- So we're having soup,
chicken noodle soup
for dinner and rolls.
Smells really good.
(peaceful music)
The soup is way too hot for the kids.
So poll question for today.
To cracker or not to cracker?
Do you like putting crackers
in your soup, yes or no?
- Yes!
-  You like it?
- I'm with Elise.
-  Is everyone yes?
Maybe it's a bad question.
Does everyone like crackers in their soup?
- I don't prefer crackers in my soup.
-  There we go.
I do.
When I was younger, I
didn't like it as much
'cause they got all soggy and
I thought that was kinda gross
but now, I like it.
- Mm hm.
Now you put corn bread in it.
-  Yeah, I do all
kinds of weird things.
- You put everything in your soup.
-  It's true.
(dance music playing)
He's just standing here.
(dance music playing)
You feelin' a little bit better, Caleb?
- Yep!
- Hi, you!
Ah!
This girl's just happy all the time.
-  Well, not all the time.
- Well, most of the time!
- But a lot of the time!
- Just most of the time!
-  She's so tired right now.
- She's tired.
-  I love you, girl.
-  Boo!
Hi.
Please say, ma ma ma ma ma.
-  You got a tongue.
- You're so fun!
Oh!
(Kendra kisses Janae)
Oh, we love you!
(kissing)
-  Good night.
J House out.
(dance music)
- Hi guys!
Guys, there's a line outside!
(kids yelling)
-  Look, they made J House shirts.
How cool is that?
(dance music)
