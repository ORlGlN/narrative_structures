- Good morning friends.
Three years ago today,
September 18th, 2014,
was the first time we ever
posted a J House vlog.
So I'm gonna put in the description box
some of our favorite vlogs over the years
and I'm gonna start today's video
with our original intro.
Enjoy.
(bright music)
(happy music)
-  Good job.
Did you get all the laundry hampers?
- Yep.
One, two, three.
-  Three?
Not two, how many are there?
Three.
- One, two, three.
Good job.
Thanks for helping with the laundry.
So this morning I am spontaneously
cleaning out my pantry.
There wasn't enough room to
put some of my stuff away
and so I was like what is going on here.
I just found three different open things
of goldfish crackers.
And I also found four different
open things of pretzels.
Clearly it's just a disorganized pantry.
It's not that I don't have enough space,
it's that it's not organized well.
So we're working on that this morning.
Yep, there's the mandarin oranges.
We found peanut butter.
Everybody was telling me
we're out of peanut butter.
And in the very back of
the pantry, there it was,
a whole thing of peanut butter.
- Whoo!
-  Work out.
Working out with peanut butter.
- Whoa, it's actually kind of heavy.
-  Yeah, don't drop it dude.
(upbeat music)
-  Perfect.
(Laura babbles)
Thanks for helping.
- Janae has been really fussy today
and I found something that she likes.
-  She likes going
around in the laundry hamper.
I like that you're going
slow enough to keep her safe.
- I also put some toys in there.
She (mutters).
And I also made a little track.
-  He's loving it.
Thanks buddy.
Hey Janae.
(gasps) Are you playing with Caleb?
- All aboard!
The Caleb Happy Baker is on his way.
-  Are you helping too Laura?
- Yep.
- Yep.
(Janae babbles)
-  Yeah.
And she's got more toys.
- Yeah, I actually gave some to her.
- Good job team.
Janae's actually been super fussy today.
I don't know if she's teething
or getting an ear infection
or something, but,
since Caleb and Laura have
been playing with her,
I haven't heard a peep.
- Max is inviting friends
to watch a movie today.
- Alright, so we've got
out sand play dough.
And what we're gonna do today
is we're gonna build our own Oregon trail.
So you wanna build some
plains and some mountains.
And then I want you to
make your own wagon tracks.
(kids talking all at once)
Is that your Rocky Mountains?
- Uh huh.
- Okay, so while you guys are doing that
I'm gonna read you guys
real journal entries
from real people that
went on the Oregon trail.
So back then they didn't
have vlogs or cameras.
And so they wrote in their journals.
Which you can still write in journals now.
This is a little girl named
Katherine Sager Pringle.
And she crossed the plains in 1844.
"The motion of the wagon made us all sick
"and it was weeks before we got
used to the seasick motion."
But this time the wagon wheel
ran over the little girl.
- (gasps) Did she die?
- No, it looks like she broke her leg.
- How did the dad die?
- The daddy died 'cause he got sick.
- Oh.
- It was sad, huh?
- It's so sad.
Did their family cry.
- I'm sure their family cried.
Now we're reading about how sad they are.
The mommy is so sad, she is sick too.
- Aw, because of her daddy?
- Yeah.
"One night the captain
heard a child crying
"and found my little sister
had got out of the wagon
"and was perishing in the freezing air,
"for the nights were very cold."
They were orphans 'cause their
mommy and daddy were dead.
They died.
- But why?
-  Because they got so sick
on the Oregon trail a long time ago.
- Aw, that was so sad.
-  It was so sad.
- Are we gonna get to
meet those, those people?
-  No, this happened
a long, long time ago.
- Oh.
(happy music)
-  You created the
man of horn roller coaster,
Oregon trail.
- This is the start.
You go here, go over a
hill, go over a mountain,
then you're here.
-  This is my Oregon trail.
- Your trail actually looks
a lot like Independence Rock
where the pioneers would go up
and write their name in the rock.
- So our library does the coolest thing.
It's called like Food for Fines.
So when you have library fines,
like overdue fines on your book,
which happens to us quite frequently,
instead of just paying them money
you can bring in donations of canned goods
and then they give that
to the local food bank.
And I just think that's awesome.
It makes me feel better about
accumulating library fines,
which happens.
(jazzy music)
Since I've just got the boys with me,
we decided to bring some school work
and so some school work
here at the library
while Elise gets her tutoring session in.
She's so cute in there working hard
and she's really enjoying
her tutoring sessions.
- Hey.
Hey.
Who is there?
Janae can see her image
in the view finder.
She's so curious.
Who is that beautiful person?
I just love her.
And I want to eat you.
-  Do you like
doing school at the library?
- Yeah, I like it.
It's a lot more quiet.
-  I think it's mostly quiet,
'cause Laura and Janae aren't here.
These two are checking out
the books for me today.
Even though we now come to
the library twice a week,
we still always get a lot of books.
We're kind of addicted to the library.
- When we were at CVX
Live, we had the chance
to meet Evie Clair.
She's the 13 year old that's
on America's Got Talent.
And it's been so sad
because her father's been battling cancer
and he just recently passed away.
I just was reading his obituary.
And thinking about what
an amazing life he led,
it's amazing how hearing about that story
of Evie's father passing away,
does so much to soften my heart
to think about the way
I'm talking to my kids,
the way that I'm living my life
and how I need to focus more
on loving and caring, the
things that matter most.
And so I'm just grateful
for that perspective.
And the great example that
Evie and her family have been,
right now, when they're
under so much of a spotlight.
Good catch.
- Why my head is still hurting.
-  Oh good try.
- Dad, my head's still hurting.
-  Is your head still hurting?
- Yeah when I bonk.
-  Bonk, did you bonk your head?
- She's hit her head twice.
-  What are these called again?
-  Hawaiian sliders?
- Yummy.
So we're in a rush for dinner tonight
because we have soccer for this guy,
gymnastics for these guys,
and then we have your first
violin lesson tonight.
Are you excited about that?
-  At seven!
- All during dinner our
kids have been training
to wink with each eye and
it's pretty entertaining.
There's one eye.
Okay, wink with the other.
Oh, that's just closing your eyes.
Okay, now
the other eye.
- I can't.
(laughing)
- Pretty good.
There's one eye.
Janae can you do it?
-  She did it!
-  There it is.
(dramatic music)
- We are going to gymnastics.
I just love gymnastics.
And I'm really glad that
mom signed me up for it.
- Knock knock.
-  Who's there?
- Interrupting cow.
- Interrupting cow--
- Moo!
(Kendra laughs)
-  Classic.
- Today we are on time.
So weird.
(Kendra laughs)
(laughing)
-  Look at that sunset.
- I'm going to violin lessons, my first.
-  I'm excited for ya.
- Try to learn a new instrument
other than the piano.
- This is called the bridge.
(playful plucking)
- The pad, the scroll.
-  Let's pluck the bottom string.
That's G.
-  Goodnight, J House out.
(Isaac laughs)
-  One, two, three.
