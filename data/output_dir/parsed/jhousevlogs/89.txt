- They said I'm gonna have a sugar rush.
- We had a really rough morning.
- Will flower.
-  It will be.
- See this in movies so I'm trying it.
-  Oh no is it burnt to death?
(techno music)
-  Guess what we did today?
- What?
-  We finally got a merch store
with J House shirts, iPhone
cases, pillows, sweaters.
Do you guys wanna check it out?
- Yeah.
-  Look at it.
So if you guys wanna check this out,
it is in description box.
We have been asked by viewers
for over a couple of years now
to finally do this and we finally did it.
What do you think?
- J House stuff.
- J House stuff.
- Can we buy some and have them for us?
My favorite is that one 'cause it has-
-  My favorite is that one.
-  You like the pink one?
- Yeah.
-  I thought you would.
Okay so again, in the description box
is the link to J House merch.
- The weather is amazing so Isaac and I
are heading out on a bike ride.
Ready?
- Yeah.
-  Let's go.
(upbeat music)
And it's really fun to have
a kid that's big enough
to not only keep up with me,
but it's almost hard for
me to keep up with him.
I'm like, that was a big hill.
Slow down Isaac.
You enjoying it?
- Yeah.
-  What do you see over there?
- I saw a robin.
-  You saw a robin.
- Yeah and there's a _ .
There it is.
-  Oh I see it.
Lots of birds.
Let's go, do you wanna lead
or do you want me to lead?
- I wanna lead.
-  Awesome.
(techno music)
We found a creek.
It would be so awesome to come back here
and go creeking with the
kids in their rubber boots
like we did the other day.
Might be fun.
(upbeat music)
So we're headed right now as a family
to go pick out our Christmas tree.
Every year we get a real Christmas tree.
Unfortunately, we're not able to go to
the tree farm this year
but we're still gonna have
a good time picking one out.
And even more unfortunately,
we had a really rough morning.
If you've ever argued
with any of your siblings
or disobeyed your parents
or not wanted to do chores
or teething.
Yeah.
Family life is hard sometimes.
But it's worth it and
we're gonna recover from it
and we're gonna have a great
time picking out a tree.
Here goes nothing.
(We Wish You a Merry Christmas)
Smells like fresh
Christmas trees out here.
Obviously but the smell's really strong.
-  Santa's boot.
-  Santa's boot oh.
- This one's basically my size.
- I wanna find one for Caleb.
One for Caleb.
Hey, I found mine.
-  Hi Nae-nae.
I think it would work.
- I think this one's growing on me.
- So we've narrowed it
down to four options.
We have option A, which
is our roundest one.
A skinnier, taller one and
we have these two over here.
This one and this one.
The one thing I like about this one is how
tall it is off the ground for Jenae.
- So now all we have to do is
have all six of us agree on one.
That'll be easy.
(laughter)
(cheers)
We decided.
-  What should we name our tree?
We already have a tree named George.
(Christmas music)
There we go.
- The top is spinning.
(Christmas music)
-  Did we get a tree?
- So apparently it's
the right time of year
to plant bulbs for flowers
to come up in the spring.
I've never done that before,
but I've always wanted to try it.
So I think we're gonna try it this year.
- This one.
-  You think
that one looks so fun.
- Or these.
- This United States one.
- I think these ones are pretty.
-  I like red shine.
- I like red shine.
- I like those two.
-  I think we
should get these ones.
(Christmas music)
I already have sap all over my hands.
It's fun.
(Christmas music)
- It smells so good in here.
I love the smell of real trees.
Can you guys smell it?
I think that they should invent
scratch and sniff YouTube
where I can video this
and you could scratch
your little screen and it would smell like
amazing Christmas tree.
Patent pending.
Alright, tighten them up.
That looks pretty straight to me.
- Sour.
-  Is is sour?
You're actually getting juice.
- I see this in movies so I'm trying it.
-  I think people
do it with coconuts.
What did you make?
Sticky thing?
- Can I see how you made that?
You used this.
How'd you get pink on it?
Cool.
-  So what are you making?
So beautiful.
- I am sorting my clothes.
-  You're folding
them up real good?
Did your drawer get a little disorganized?
Time to fix that up.
(rock music)
-  Caleb, whatcha doing?
- We are gonna be planting bulbs.
-  What is a bulb?
- It's a thing that sprouts.
-  It sprouts,
what does it turn into?
-  A flower.
- A flower.
- You wanna help move
some of this top stuff?
We don't want it to come
on the grass though,
we just want it to scoot to the side.
(rock music)
- I see the flower in it.
-  A flower will grow.
Go ahead and stick it facing up.
- Is this the flower?
-  It will be,
that will be a tulip.
- This is fun.
-  Cover them up.
Get some dirt over them.
You guys planted flowers.
(upbeat music)
This fell out of the fridge.
Kendra was grabbing something like this
and I went to pick it up
thinking the lid would stay open, no.
The lid opened and all the
spinach is on the floor.
-  What were we gonna use it?
-  I thought we would just
let it hang out on the floor.
-  What's happening?
- The tree is getting cutted open.
-  I know it's opening.
Here's the funny thing Jeremy,
it's such a skinny tree,
it's like not even really opening.
There you have it.
Kind of anti-climatic
because it's a skinny tree.
- It'll spread its wings a
little bit more than this.
-  I actually really like
that it's a pretty skinny one.
It's the softest pine tree I've ever felt.
- It's like fur, but
it's not a Douglas Fir
it's like a-
-  Great Frazier.
- Great Frazier tree.
-  Oh no, is it burnt to death?
- Just bubbly.
It's a little, I like crispy.
-  Okie dokie.
- It's a little crispy around the edges.
-  I definitely forgot about it.
Hey!
-  Just there so-
-  We can just cut off the edges.
Apparently today is the day
for mishaps in the kitchen.
Salad and tortilla pizza crisp.
- So we're trying to leave
but Kendra can't find her shoes.
So I guess that doesn't
just happen to toddlers.
It also happens to Kendra sometimes.
She found shoes.
- They're a little bit of a necessity.
-  Good job.
(upbeat music)
- So the kids are gonna
play at Uncle Brent
and Aunt Michelle's house tonight.
And they have animals.
I just realized I don't
think Jenae's really been
around animals before.
-  And we love
the Christmas sweater.
- Ivy's looking really cute.
(upbeat music)
Seeing Ivy in this sweater
makes me really want a dog
and to put my dog in a sweater.
That's just adorable.
(upbeat music)
-  Go get 'em.
-  Oh she's on it.
-  Go get the kitty.
She's like, wait a minute.
Come on Mom, help me out.
-  Ivy, Ivy.
That's a doggy.
Doggy's give kisses.
-  Close encounters
with puppies with sweaters on.
-  Oh nice doggy.
-  You guys eating cookies?
- They said I'm gonna
have a sugar rush tonight.
I have some red frosting.
-  Oh, I wouldn't have
been able to tell otherwise.
-  Yeah, look at his face.
-  How is the cookies?
- Good.
-  Yeah.
She's still looking over at the cat.
There you go.
- So soft.
What was that?
-  I got hair on my hand.
-  Oh she wants to do it again.
It seems like Jenae likes animals,
but I'm a little bit
nervous about having one
of our own because she
would attack the animal.
-  Goodnight, J House out.
- Gingerbread houses.
- Butter cookies.
-  Butter cookies?
Caught ya.
So you guys get to build a device
that can safely carry your cookie.
-  One, two, three, drop.
-  These pajamas make me so happy.
