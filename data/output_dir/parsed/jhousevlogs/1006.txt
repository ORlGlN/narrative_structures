ha-hey
the morning our morning is kind of off
to an off kilter start Laura had a
doctor's appointment this morning her
nine month checkup and that went okay
ish she hasn't gained any weight since
her last appointment and so that's
concerning so we're having to do some
more things to work with her on that I'm
gonna check on what Isaac Leeser doing
what it is doing where we're gonna sleep
under here so in case you can't see that
very well they made a fort underneath
Isaac's bed and they're making a
schedule for tomorrow and they have a
whole bunch of books under there that
they're reading by flashlights so I
think they'll be okay for a few minutes
while I try to rest
so look who just woke up he's hey hello
yeah what did you do Oh
taking that Oh
how does it feel good good job did you
have any fun dreams now would you dream
about oh like where mom's ha ha
your grandma and papa well those are
great dreams all you want to snuggle
your mother for a minute all right we're
just gonna sit here in snuggle and can't
get enough of these moments don't grow
up a little guy okay you know you're
married to a drummer
if this is
so the kids are already in bed
but it's because they're sleeping in
their fort all right let's see what's
going on in here what's down there the
rail door good night good night good
night you guys
we'll see if this works
all right so it's 9:40 and Isaac and
Elise we just heard them and they're
still chatting it's so cute like I know
we should make a goat event you have
cheerio breath I was eatin Cheers
hey Cheerios oh yeah you make she was
fed a lot of Cheerios as a kid in now
Leigh overdosed to be I do I'm sure your
breath I don't know why I hate Cheerios
I just hate Cheerios but that's a side
note I wanted some cereal
for my like 9:40 snack okay that's the
matter at hand the kids like these are
like magical memories to remember
sleepovers with your siblings I mean I
remember sleeping with my siblings in
the same bed most of my life we would
have liked sleepovers where we'd like
sleep on the same phone it was really
tender like I want them to have these
they sleep
if they're asleep they probably can't
fart the best way to find out if kids
are sleeping tell a funny joke and if
they laugh alright yeah
generally we didn't succeed or week by
using a real card sorry that just stinks
we had to check to see if they were
awake
I'm telling Isaac and you least why they
have to go to bed now because it's so
late and Isaac said that's not on this
schedule the schedule says that we don't
have to go to bed till 11 9 o'clock Reid
11 o'clock go to bed so he asks you know
what time is it like well it's 9:40 and
he's like whoa what's the problem
we're reading Isaac who authorized this
schedule really this make it ugly
so Willa say good night right now yeah
they're not gonna like this I'm probably
gonna have to like pick them up out of
the fort
yeah Jeremy I can agree just fart in the
fort they will come out for sure smoking
out
