- We are headed to the
thrift store tonight.
Isaac, we just dropped him
off at community choir,
and so we have an hour to kill.
- So I've been invited to some
ugly Christmas sweater parties.
And so I was hoping to find some goodies.
(upbeat music)
Come on.
- Some of this stuff.
- Gotta find the diamonds in the rough.
-  Oh, I want these kind of gloves.
- Sweetie, those are socks.
- So it's been way too long
since I've done a thrift store.
Growing up, this was like the only place
my mom would bring us
up until I was like 16.
So I always kinda despised it, but
this is fun.
I'm super excited about it.
- A one, a two, a one, two, three, go.
(upbeat music)
- This is my favorite section.
It's the book section.
- That looks weird.
That looks like Bert.
-  Bert from Mary Poppins?
- Uh-huh, you have to wear it.
It looks good.
(Singing)
- Kendra just gave me the
very embarrassed wife look.
- You're gonna get more of the
very embarrassed wife look, too.
All right, here's the short list of books.
Now I'm probably gonna
actually go home with like one,
because I have a buying problem.
- If any.
Kendra will have everything
in the cart ready to go,
and then we get up to the cash register,
and she'll just decide
not to get anything.
That's a common occurrence.
- I'm not a great shopper.
But let's go see if
there's some pants for you.
-  Wait, what books did you get?
- Let's see.
-  Which ones are
you most excited about?
- We've got Across Five Aprils,
Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh,
A Long Way from Chicago, Johnny Tremain,
Hello, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle,
Anne of Green Gables
and The Best Christmas Pageant Ever.
- Ooh, Anne of Green Gables.
Which one are you most excited about?
- Probably The Best Christmas Pageant Ever
because it's a classic and it's
Christmastime right now, so.
-  Nice.
- Bonus.
- Yes, yes.
Wait, there's like a whole section
of ugly Christmas sweaters.
Oh, they're all female ones.
Maybe that's even better.
Better.
Okay, I'm gonna look.
Thank you.
We found the ugly
Christmas sweater section.
It's in the girls' section.
(upbeat music)
What are you thinking, ladies?
- It's pretty.
- So he just ran into the dressing room
with a whole bunch of jewelry.
Oh, are you so proud of yourself?
Let's show it to me.
That looks so nice.
Okay, can you show me where it goes back?
Show me where it goes.
Show me what a big boy you
are that you can put it back.
- I don't want to take it back.
(yelling)
- Okay, you're gonna have to
take her so I can take Caelb.
So as we were getting ready to leave,
Caleb threw a massive tantrum.
And it ended up, like I
tried to talk him down,
I tried to like listen to him.
And eventually I just picked him up
and walked out of the store, so.
Classic, where you going, Jeremy?
- Yeah.
-  Did you wanna stay?
- Yeah.
Ready to do it.
- Is he crying most about
the necklaces that he wanted?
Why didn't we just buy him the necklaces?
He looked so cute in them.
- Because that's what we do.
We buy our children
whatever is upsetting them.
- No, instead, the entire
store is like looking at us
as our baby screams.
-  Who you talking to?
- It's Sam on Samica.
I finally got in.
To a live chat.
- Hi, Samica.
- So it's so fun, I've
like asked questions
and they're responding
and there's interaction.
- While he's doing that,
I wanted to show you
what we ended up with
from the thrift store.
So in total we spent $15.
We got two pairs of pants for Elise,
one shirt for Elise, a sweater for Jeremy,
a hat for Jeremy and a book.
So that was our night at the thrift store.
- Today is our two-month vlogiversarry.
Can you believe it?
Two months.
Yeah, September 18th, 2014,
was our first post on this.
Hey.
(laughter)
So it's been a crazy two months.
We're so glad you came along for the ride.
We've had a steep learning curve.
If you haven't already, we
would love for you to subscribe
and leave comments and be a
part of your YouTube family.
We've loved this adventure,
and we're excited about
some of the fun stuff
coming up in Month Three.
We've got Christmas and Thanksgiving
and the holidays,
and we're just having a lot of fun.
Okay.
J House out.
