-  Who puts ice cream on a burger?
(upbeat music)
- So we have something
important we want to
talk about with you guys today.
When we compare ourselves to
others, it brings sadness.
Check out this s'mores milkshake!
(upbeat music)
(flamenco guitar music)
-  How did you
sleep last night big girl?
- Good, I didn't sleep in this.
-  No, you slept in your bed huh?
- Yeah.
-  But you wish you
could sleep in this every night?
- Yeah.
(flamenco guitar music)
- Keep you warm.
(laughter)
- Good girl!
-  Well, I'm out of here!
- So we have something
important we wanted to
talk about with you guys
today, and that is... reality.
We've heard kind of a
buzz going around about
what is real and what is not
in the social media world,
and we just wanted to share some of
our thoughts on this topic.
- We talk about this a lot together...
- Oh for sure.
- And we're very deliberate
about what we share in the vlog,
and that's also what we
want to talk about is
what it is we are sharing,
and what we're not.
- So I guess what's really
important to me is you all know
that we are not trying
to display the ideal.
We're not trying to display
perfection by any means.
We've tried to share that Jeremy and I
have gone through marriage counseling,
that we're having behavior
issues with our kids.
That I struggle with
depression and anxiety.
I'm really struggling more with
anxiety and depression lately.
We wanted to tell you about
our first year of marriage,
which was actually really crappy.
- Does marriage just not go well,
or am I just so messed up that I can't
love the way that I need to love,
or I can't be what I need to be.
- You don't see my whole day,
you just see these little pieces,
and I feel like I'm really
truly failing as a mother.
I just want to reset, start over,
or just go to bed now, wake up
tomorrow, and try again then.
- I think it's overwhelming
as parents because
we often feel like...
- We have no idea what we're doing?
- Yeah we don't know what to
do, we don't know how to help,
each kid has a unique different challenge
and we feel inadequate.
- So I'm having a down day,
a day when I'm struggling with depression,
and those down feelings, those
feelings that I'm not enough.
I also struggle after each baby
with some postpartum depression.
We decided to have me do some counseling
before this baby is born.
- I've been really
stressing about finances,
we just ended another quarter.
It's hard to not have as much money
as you thought you were going to have,
and all the worries that come
with that, and the anxiety.
- Well this morning Jeremy and
I got in quite an argument.
We got mad.
I so desperately want to be
this amazing mother to my kids.
I get that you guys see the
good that happens in our world,
but there's a lot of moments
that don't get filmed,
or get edited in of me
snapping at the kids,
or my house is a complete wreck,
or I'm in my pajamas all day,
or I'm just grumpy and irritable,
or I'm on my phone too much that day,
or I'm distracted and
not focused on the kids,
or I just yell, or I'm just
impatient and get so angry.
Marriage in real life, is hard.
It's beautiful, but it also
kind of sucks sometimes.
But we're also trying to
be respectful to our family
in the way that we share those things.
We don't want to share our
kids really rough moments,
when they're learning, and growing,
and going through phases,
and the internet is going to stay forever!
We also want to be respectful of things
that need to stay private in our marriage,
so we can have the strength
to work through them.
Jeremy and I have also learned
through this YouTube adventure
that it feels better,
to share good...
We don't want to be whiny and complaining,
and spreading negativity,
we want to be reminding
ourselves and each of you
of the good that exists
in our flawed lives.
We don't want to remember
the terrible moments.
Jeremy and I often talk
about how someday we're
going to be sitting in an old folks home,
watching our vlogs on repeat.
- And forgetting about
all the terrible things,
this is great!
- Jeremy said the most
ironic thing the other day.
He watched one of our vlogs, and he said,
we were talking about this
comparison game, and he said,
"My life, isn't as good as our vlogs."
- Like we watched the Lego Land vlog.
It was more fun to watch the Lego Land one
than to go through it.
I mean we shared in the Lego
Land vlog that one of our kids
threw this mammoth tantrum,
and that really put a damper
on the day for me, that was really hard.
- We've had a great
day at Lego Land today,
and we also had a really rough moment.
One of our kids threw quite the tantrum,
and honestly I was super
embarrassed, but it happens.
- And we talked about it in the vlog,
but you can't experience
it, so like the vlog itself
was so fun to watch and so awesome,
but it skips all waiting in
line, it skips all tantrums,
it skips all disobedience,
it skips everything.
- It skips all the decision making.
Like oh where should we go
next, looking at the map.
- It just includes fun moments to music,
so the Lego Land video was more
fun than going to Lego Land.
- I love being a mother,
and there's days that
I want to pull every hair on my head out.
And it's hard to have five little kids,
and to home school, and
have Jeremy work from home.
We are always in each others space,
and that doesn't always go really well.
It's hard to have different
opinions and Jeremy and I
are both super opinionated,
and super stubborn.
- Speak for yourself, I
don't think that's true.
(laughter)
So another thing besides
people comparing...
- I love you!
- Did she just say I love you?
- I love you!
- Did she just say I love you?
- Or "I poop".
- Hello!
- Hello!
- So the other thing I'm nervous about
for our younger viewers who watch,
saying that they want to
have a family like ours.
We want to be inspiring
but we don't want to create
false expectations of what a
family is, or what it's like.
- And we do love having
the family that we have,
but we just wouldn't
want people to grow up,
have their own five kids,
and be like "wait a minute."
- "My husband is not like
Jeremy who never lost his temper
and was always good humored and kind."
- Or "how did Kendra stay patient
through all these moments?"
Spoiler alert... didn't.
- Nothing has made me happier
than seeing people comments
that they just came home
from a hard day of school,
or they're home sick,
and the videos brought
a smile to their face.
That makes me so happy, we're providing
a form of entertainment
that brings people joy,
or inspires them to want
to go out an do something
with their family, I
love those pieces of it.
- By sharing the good parts of our day,
but just because we're sharing
the good parts of our day,
which are completely real,
we don't want you to
assume that there's not
the hard and bad parts of our day,
because those are completely real as well.
Wherever you are in
your own imperfect life,
in your own imperfect
family, you're not alone.
That's what all of us are going through,
we're all just doing our
best and trying our best,
and you have beautiful
moments of your life,
and you have really
annoying parts of your life,
and so do we.
We just wanted to remind all of us,
Jeremy and I need this reminder too,
of social media and where is stands.
It's the pieces that people want to share.
- And it's interesting because
we have a responsibility
for ourselves, to not be
comparing or feeling lesser
when we see the great things.
I mean just the other day,
one of your good friends
posted something that
she was doing as a mom,
and you were kind of feeling like...
- I'm the worst mom ever!
- But it like Kendra,
we know those people,
we know that they also
have really rough times,
and it is a responsibility
on the participant,
on the viewer of social media to try to
put those things in perspective,
because otherwise it
can lead to depression,
anxiety, and feeling lesser as a person.
- Now, we're going to go back to our
regularly scheduled programming.
(orchestral music)
- So this morning Jeremy
and I were talking about,
you know not comparing ourselves to people
that we see on social
media, whether it's on
Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, whatever.
But we didn't talk about
why... and here's why.
When we compare ourselves to others,
it brings sadness into our lives,
because we fail to see the
goodness that's in our own lives.
Comparison is the opposite of gratitude.
Comparison is like an entitlement.
It's like "man, they
have this and I don't,
that stinks I should have it."
It just robs us of our joy.
So here's my challenge for all
of us today, myself included.
I want us to think of five
things that we're grateful for.
Five unique things about your life.
Ways that you are truly blessed,
and as we stop and pause
on those gratitudes,
it helps us feel joy, and
then we can share joy,
and just recognize how
blessed our lives are.
(jazz music)
- We're headed somewhere
fun for dinner tonight.
I actually read about it
online before we came.
And it's a burger place
called Slater's 50/50,
but they have a very unique burger that
at least one of us will
be brave enough to try.
- No.
- I'm going to try it.
-  You're going to try it?
- It has ice cream, and
peanut butter, and buns.
(laughter)
-  We knew the hamburger
was going to have buns.
(jazz music)
-  So I keep
videoing all our pretty views
while we're driving, and
this is driving me crazy.
We got pooped on! Need to
go wash our windshield.
(jazz music)
I feel like every time
we go into a restaurant
with all our our kids, I
kind of brace myself...
like please please behave, please!
-  Check out this burger!
(upbeat piano music)
- Parenting pro tip, when you have six...
we don't have six kids.
- When you have five kids,
and everyone is inside eating,
and there's an option for outside,
we can't bother anyone out here so,
and they brought little heaters for us.
- It's nice and quiet, it's
warm, it was a good idea Jeremy.
So look at this they have
this amazing milkshake,
which reminds me of the place
that we went in St. Louis?
-  Fitz's.
- And the place we went in DC,
which had a marshmallow
milkshake, so this is mine.
-  Do you guys
remember what happened
when we were trying to go to Fitz's?
- Yeah, we were soaked.
(raindrops hitting pavement)
- Completely wet!
(laughter)
-  No, this is the wrong way!
- That was awesome!
- Was that fun? This
place better be amazing.
-  So we ordered an appetizer,
do you want to tell them what it is?
- It's a mac and cheese roll
with cheese on top of it.
- So this place is known for their
fried bacon mac and cheese balls,
so we're going to try
that as an appetizer.
- I love it!
- So good!
(funk music)
-  Salad.
(harp strumming)
-  Okay, who wants to try some?
-  So this burger,
has a burger, and bacon,
and strawberry jelly, and
peanut butter, and ice cream.
- Can we try it?
-  Does everybody
want to taste it?
- Laura's like "whatever."
-  Who puts ice cream on a burger?
(funk music)
- That's really good.
-  No way.
-  It's so big it's hard for them
to get their mouths around.
- Mmmm, that's good!
-  Mac and cheese,
french fries, she's in heaven.
Alright poll question.
Do you like bacon, because
I know this is terrible,
but I don't, I don't actually love bacon.
I'm liking my food here, but a bacon
restaurant is kind of wasted on me.
-  Elise is
currently feeding Janae.
What's up there?
She's been seeing the airplanes,
she's like "what's going on?"
- So this is my third time to go to the
bathroom with kids during the meal.
I changed a diaper,
which they had a diaper
changer in the bathroom.
It's on the other side buddy.
I've taken Laura to the bathroom twice,
and now Caleb and Isaac. Okay let's go!
- Alright guys check out
this s'mores milkshake.
Marshmallow milkshake.
(feelgood music)
So this other dessert
is called the Coco Karma
and it's supposed to be like
the Samoa Girl Scout Cookie.
- It's delicious.
- In total it was seven
trips to the bathroom,
during the meal, that's
more than normal though,
that was weird.
(echoy signing)
(running water)
- Good night, J-House out!
- What do you think the moon feels like?
Ready to head to the ocean side?
(orchestral music)
(cheering)
- So what do you think,
was that a first step?
