it nicer because our gonna fix it up

excited because we get to go to the
drive-up window and use those little
like tube things that go down into the
ceiling and that's for some reason

hiding behind me with his presence so I
can't see it oh I can't see it
Isaac will not me what long is checking
out keeping it a secret
smart boy my point is Isaac she's got
your total right here

long so Laura got Isaac the baby doll
but we made it look like a ball to try
to tricking only problem is that Laura I
really want this one
is it like a ball rapping is an art form
some people have it and some people
don't seem to be for me I'm so excited
for Christmas oh not yet
when do we get to open it uh when you
baby cameras roll oh this is one of my
favorite parts of Christmas
Isaac asked me to go upstairs so I won't
see what he got me
you're a great present rapper I kind of
don't remember how to do like the
bedding part and then play it over I
tried with Isaac now but if you look at
it takes practice now that's a little
harder to rap well I can do it yeah you
can next year you'll have another baby
sister to shop for yay poll question
do you enjoy wrapping presents Jeremy
and I both really enjoy wrapping
presents we just have a completely
different approach to it I love wrapping
them because I like to make them look as
nice as possible
I'd like all about the creases and you
know the fold then Jeremy likes to get
as creative as possible so you can
always tell on Christmas morning who
wrapped your present because yeah rgeous
yes yeah I could tell who did it you
couldn't Jeremy's presents are just
wrapped as creatively as possible like
you might get Laura's wrapping and
Jeremy's wrapped and confused but he's
having fun with it so it doesn't matter
now I gotta go mom why do I have to go
because you have to go because I'm
wrapping your present and whatever when
I say come now I will be almost done
okay it's crazy how grown-up an
independent the kids are getting we've
been doing this tradition for a long
time and I remember when we were taking
you know just Isaac any lease and they
couldn't really pick out the presents
very well themselves and they couldn't
wrap the presents by themselves at all
and now Isaac and he lease are great at
it and Caleb is learning fast and I just
can't believe how old they're getting
Caleb's pretty much a rapping
professional he knows just what to do
how do you take I showed Caleb how to
measure
