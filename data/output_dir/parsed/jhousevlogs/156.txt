- We just had a really,
really scary experience
in the parking lot.
(upbeat music)
One, two, three.
-  Isaac,
gotta get up, we have school today.
(guitar music)
Elise,
come on we gotta get up.
Let's come do breakfast.
So the first thing this morning
before anyone was awake,
Caleb climbed up into our bed.
He had his hair done, his clothes were on,
his bed was made and what did you tell us?
- That I was excited for school
so I wanted to get ready quick.
- He is super excited for his
first day of kindergarten.
We homeschool our kids but one day a week
they go to a homeschool enrichment program
which is like a day of school.
They have their teachers
and their classmates
of about 20 kids in each class.
They take their lunches.
And we love that they get
to have that experience
of going to school for
that one day a week.
(upbeat music)
(indiscernible singing)
- What are we having
today for lunch at school?
-  Do you wanna
help me put it together?
Okay, come on over.
(upbeat music)
So Elise how are you
feeling about the first day
at school?
- I feel very excited.
-  Which class are
you most excited about today?
- Spanish, it's my first class and art.
They do something cool.
- This is my own backpack.
-  Did you do your own hair Laura?
Let's maybe go talk to Mom about maybe her
just tweeking it a little bit.
- Okay.
- Getting your hair done.
Yep.
You excited to go to your
preschool class today?
- Yeah.
Hey that looks pretty.
- Do you have your shoes on?
- Yep and yep.
Even I got my backpack on.

(guitar music)
- You mix it up with the dry hair?
That is so cool.
- There you go, all set.
You all done?
You get some pigtails.
Turn around, let's see 'em.
She was so excited.
Oops, they're not super even.
They look great Laura.
- I like my hair down.
-  So we just
curled it a little bit?
It looks super nice,

- Yep.
-  Let's do this.
- Me and Isaac actually

and lunchbox but mine is a girl version
and Isaac's is a boy version.
-  So they're different colors.
Cool.

about the first day of school?
- I'm excited, it's fun
and I like to meet my new classmates.
-  So what classes do you have?

science, music, PE, and art.
-  And which class
are you most excited about?
- Computer because it's my
first time doing computers.
I am really excited to see my
friends from class that
I knew from last year.
-  Alright, we're
headed into classes.
How are you guys feeling?
- Great.
- Excited.
- It was hard for me
to get out of the car.
-  Yeah, with your big backpack?
- Yeah, I'm not used this big backpack.
-  The drive
over the kids are just
chatting all about their
teachers and their classes.
I think they're gonna have a great day.
Isaac, what's your first class?

High five.
- Bye Isaac, see you some other time.
(piano music)
-  You excited

- Yeah.

- Right there.
-  Good memory.
- So when it's time for lunch
you'll come to your backpack.
- Then my snack is right there.
-  What letter are
you learning about today?
- A.
-  The letter A.
- Because that.
-  Okay buddy have a good day.
Can I have a hug before I go?
I'll miss you buddy, have a good day okay?
- Okay bye.
- Listen to your teacher.
Alright, what's your first class?
- Spanish.
-  Are you excited about it?
Say something in Spanish for me.
- Adios.
-  Adios.
Bye.
- I need a hug from Jenae too.
-  You need a hug from Jenae.
- I'm gonna miss you.
-  Oh you got it.
Were you stuck?
- Yeah.
-  Laura couldn't get outta the
bathroom stall for a little bit.
Okay should we wash those hands?
Well dropping them off
I feel nothing but joy.
It's interesting I mean this is our
third, fourth year homeschooling
and I'm just so grateful that
they have this opportunity.
I'm grateful that they're
home most of the time
and we'll get to do so much as a family.
I'm really grateful they get to come here
and experience this as well.
It's a really great mix for our family
and it just works.
I know other years when I've left I felt
a little bit emotional leaving them.
But this year, I feel great about it.
They're gonna be having
such great learning
opportunities with friends and
teachers who care about them.
I know they're in a
safe place where they're
gonna be loved and
nurtured while I'm away.
I just had a really, really
scary experience in the parking lot.
I was walking with just Laura and Jenae.
I have my diaper bag and
I'm holding Jenae in my arms
and I was getting the
keys outta my pocket.
So my hands were very full.
I tripped on a stick, it was a
big stick in the parking lot.
I couldn't see it and
it was so scary and I know
tripping doesn't sound scary
but I was holding my baby.
Anyway, I fell over and my
ankle rolled pretty badly.
The way that I stumbled, I
was able to keep Jenae safe
and kind of regain my
balance at the last minute.
I could have dropped my baby.
It makes me wanna just use the stroller
when I have that much in
my hands or something.
Or wear better shoes.
You ready for preschool?
Well the car went from being super loud
and mass chaos to just really quiet.
So Jenae's sleeping and
we're gonna go home.
I'm gonna try to get some stuff done.
I can't believe it, I just have one kid.
Oh my goodness, you're trying so hard.
Good job, you did it.
Okay so she can kind of
get around a little bit
and I don't know whether to call it,
I mean she's obviously not
crawling but she's moving.
Was that a first knee forward?
I think I might have to watch this back
in slow motion, zoom in.
(epic music)
It's so amazing to watch the process
of a kid learning how to do something.
To see each little movement forward
and to see what she's learning
and she's experiencing it all.
It's fun to watch kids learn.
Here you go, you've tried so hard.
You've been working so hard.
So Laura insisted on having a lunch packed
even though her preschool
ends before lunchtime.
So now she's bringing her lunch box home
and she's gonna do a
little lunch date with me
and Jeremy if he has a
moment free from work.
-  Is this your lunch?
-  We're gonna all get to sit down
and eat together.
-  Our little independent miss.
- I put it one and I did it one day.
-  And now you can just do it huh?
- She's like a Capri Sun prodigy.
I can barely do that.
Are we having a little date?
- I'm so happy to have you as my daughter.
You make me so happy.
(piano music)
- Cover up the batter,
hide the wooden spoon.
Did it fall on her?
Brush away the sugar, whistling a tune.
Nope, it isn't Mama, it's only Mrs. Sheep.
So we're washing Laura's sheets today
and I forgot about that and it's nap time.
So she's just laying on the
mattress pad with a blanket.
Alright, tuckidy tuck in.
- Lay those head down, close that eyes.
- L A U R A, Laura.
- That's your name.
Have a good nap big girl.
- Okay.
Can we read only one book?
- You want me to read you one?
Alright let's do it,
There's a Bear on my Chair.
Do you like that one?
There's a bear on my chair.
Alright I'm here to pick up the kids
from their first day of school.
How was your first day of school?
- Good.
-  Alright, let's
go find the other kids.
- Isaac guess what?
I got a new meter stick.
-  So how was
your first day of school?
- It was good.
-  Did you have
any friends in your class?
- Yep and I made new ones too.
(giggles)
(piano music)
(upbeat music)
- Sorry we're closed.
