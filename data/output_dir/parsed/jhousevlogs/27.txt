- Backwards day and forwards day.
(upbeat music)
(cheers)
- Hidden drawer up here.
-  You wouldn't
even know it was there.
(upbeat music)
(guitar music)
- I'm getting ready.
- My job is to protect everyone.
- Laura is becoming the
queen of this kingdom.
- We're gonna have Elise go first.
(orchestral music)
Now we're gonna have Laura.
(orchestral music)
- Now we are going to have
Prince Charming dance.
(techno music)
- That kind of reminded me of River Dance.
(Irish music)
- Now the ball may begin.
(upbeat music)
- We're going to the ball.
- So I was just sitting
over here on the couch
and I was like, man I'm thirsty.
I didn't even realize
that I said that out loud.
A few minutes later, Laura
shows up with this cup
and it's got ice and water in it.
She's like, here you go.
I'm like, what in the world.
It was just honestly a
really tender surprise to me.
I get my kids water all the time.
I'm always taking care of their needs.
So for her to without even being asked
bring me a glass of water, I
was like oh you're so sweet.
It was just really tender
and oh Nae-nae has
something to say about that.
- I am getting ready for
crazy hair day for basketball.
-  So all of the
players are doing crazy hair?
- My coach is even doing it.
I'm done.
- Backwards and forwards day.
-  Is today backwards
day and forwards day?
What's the backwards part?
Show me the other side of her shirt.
And what's forwards day?
Nice, great outfit.
So are you gonna do your
hair forward or backward?
(upbeat music)
(laughter)
So Janae has not been herself
at all today or last night.
She's extra cranky.
She's still distr actable,
but mostly she won't nurse.
When a baby that breastfeeds really well
all of a sudden stops, it's
called a nursing strike
and it usually means they're teething,
maybe their ears are bothering them
and it usually just resolves on its own.
I've been pumping and reading
about what I'm supposed to do.
It's kind of sad 'cause she's more cranky
and I'm like come on, just nurse.
You playing with Miss Laura?
- I'm painting.
I need the color...
what color did she use?
Pink.
Alison let's me borrow hers.
You ready for a nap little stink?
Hi Dad.
♪ Let's get ready to rumble ♪
-  Alright
moms and dads, let's _
the court to the away team the _.
(cheers)
(techno music)
- So before the game, Isaac made a chart
that he wanted me to keep stats
for how he does in the game.
How many points he
makes, how many rebounds.
I'll be trying to fill
that out through the game.
(techno music)
(cheers)
(techno music)
(cheers)
(techno music)
Alright, Isaac is one
rebound away from his goal
of a double double.
There's two and a half minutes left.
(cheers)
(techno music)
Good job buddy.
You did awesome, you got your goal.
-  So Isaac,
you played great today.
You shot the ball well,
you dribbled the ball well.
We don't count baskets,
I don't know how many
baskets your scored.
You probably counted didn't you?
That's okay, that's alright.
After a little while,
what did I ask you to do?
- Start passing.
-  Almost every single time
you made a pass what happened?
- We ended up scoring.
-  We ended up scoring.
Your teammate got a cool shot.
- Well I'm really proud of Isaac.
In the last game, it had
been 13 or 14 minutes
into the game before he shot a ball.
He didn't have any rebounds at that point
and he just wasn't playing aggressive.
So we worked on that, we talked about it.
He set goals and he had
22 points this game,
19 rebounds and he had a lot of passes
and a lot of assists and steals.
I was just really proud of him.
The only goals he didn't meet I think
were things outside of his control.
They asked him to not
steal the ball anymore.
- I couldn't find two
of any of my flip flops
but I found one of each and
they're on the right feet.
So I figure I'm pretty good to go.
It's warm enough out for flip flops.
(guitar music)
So this morning while
Jeremy was with the kids,
I went to a women's
conference at my church.
I absolutely loved it.
I went to different workshops
on different topics.
There was one on improving
your personal prayer,
one on different ways to get
more from your scripture study,
one on strengthening my
relationship with my savor,
and one that was on
finding the joy in life.
I just come home feeling so inspired
and just rejuvenated.
I just absolutely love it.
It does help that there's
also lunch at the end
and I got to sit and
visit with my friends.
I feel like I've had
just a lovely morning.
I'm excited to try to
apply a lot of the things
that I learned about and
talk to Jeremy about.
Just some little changes
that we can make in our home
and in our family and in my life
so that I can feel closer to my savior.
Smells good.
- So we're wanting to put
something in our basement
that the kids can do down and read on.
We thought maybe a big bean bag,
but a couch would be really nice too.
(upbeat music)
It's so hard right now because
we're looking at houses
and considering the possibility of moving.
So it's hard to be upgrading
and doing other things
to our house that we're currently in
if we're gonna be leaving.
If we buy furniture for the
house we're in right now,
but then we move-
We're kind of in a limbo state right now.
- So this dresser has a
little hidden drawer up here.
-  You wouldn't
even know it was there.
- I'm super excited about that.
I could put all my special things in here.
-  We no longer need a safe.
We'll put all of our money up here
so if we get robbed,
no one would ever know.
- This drawer right here that pulls out.
You just open this drawer,
you lift up this latch here,
and tada!
-  Then it goes back.
-  To the hidden part.
- Then you close it and
then it stops right there.
- I had no idea dressers
could be like hiding spots.
-  Then if you push this knob,
it opens up to the bat cave.
We were looking at dressers
'cause we've been married 13 years,
we still don't have a
dresser and nightstands.
- You have to really get far in life
before you can have those things.
Look at these paintings.
I actually really like them.
So the kids are with a babysitter tonight
and I'm really excited about it.
She speaks Spanish so
she's gonna be speaking
Spanish with our kids.
I'm interested to see how that goes.
She also speaks English, don't
worry, they're gonna be fine.
Apparently Jeremy's a little bit tired.
- This couch is very comfortable.
-  It's super comfy,
it's like a marshmallow.
- We would like to pause the blog for
an official moment of silence.
This restaurant that gives
free nacho cheese is closed.
- This is probably Jeremy's favorite.
Is this one of your favorites?
- Free nacho cheese.
They just come out with nacho cheese.
- They also give sopapias
when you're done eating.
So this is a Mexican restaurant
and we just decided for
our date night tonight
let's go there and it is closed.
It closed while we were in San Diego.
I'm really said for Jeremy.
- They must have given
away too many free things
to stay open as a business.
-  Why don't you go read
the sign to see what it says.
- Maybe they just moved
to a different location.
-  Maybe.
(disappointed music)
Well I honestly feel
pretty sad for Jeremy.
It is sad when a place
that you really love closes
and it is, it's just closed.
- So where should we go now?
- We came to Chilis.
(guitar music)
So we still ordered some caso for Jeremy.
This has avocados and spinach and pico
and all sorts of goodness in it.
-  Whoa.
-  So good.
-  I love how it's sizzling still.
- Here's our problem, our food just came,
but we're already full.
We filled up on chips and salsa
so lunch tomorrow I guess.
- But there is nothing
better than Sunday at lunch
eating all of this tomorrow.
I'm excited.
- Well we just got the dreaded
call that Janae is fussy
so we are hurrying home.
We took the rest of our food to go
and we'll eat it later.
Time to get to baby.
-  Goodnight, J House out.
- I got kids.
-  How many kids do you have?
- 16
(upbeat music)
- So I got a text that
I'm really excited about.
Here it is, do you know who that is?
(upbeat music)
