a little bit of snow there this is my
sister baby
I dressed stranger you put her in that
yeah who's on the phone man oh can you
tell her hi for me
Oh looks like you're getting all dressed
up today I just got this plan in the
nighttime what's the plan oh that I'm
going to work with you oh I'm not going
to work today it's the weekend
power so Isaac and I are down here in
downtown Kansas City to do the college
basketball experience
you
Highschool Weissach i had a ton of fun
that is a really cool place and we're
back home now when you come over I'm
making my own March Madness for you I'm
gonna play the game when you need to I
guess you will win the game
you guys have fun with Mikayla okay
thanks for babysitting Mikayla well I
don't think I've even seen you guys
today so hello a happy day um we are out
on date night tonight it's cold out
that's why we look like whoo are you so
we live in Kansas City and I actually
very rarely crave barbecue but I'm
craving barbecue tonight and this place
smells amazing
check out that feeling
it's nice huh so in Kansas City some of
the barbecue places are like at a gas
station and then there's nicer barbecue
places and everyone has a strong opinion
about what their favorite barbecue
places since I wasn't like born and
raised in Kansas City I actually don't
have a strong opinion about it which
makes me a little weird and we order
water every time we go anywhere we're
cheap like here it is my burger it's
kind of not a burger oh it's not I keep
calling it that if you call eat a burger
I asked for cheese on it and she was
like I don't really do that it's a
barbecue sandwich it is it's a barbecue
sandwich I have to do it I have to press
it nothing wrong here's the first hair
looking good hair just one size smaller
and take the side which fits better and
that's always hard because no one's
little to lose one's a little bit too
tight like I need this size right in
between so I'm looking for some shoes I
don't actually own any heels and I was
thinking it might be cute to have some
heels but then you can't walk in them
dancing is definitely a dangerous
situation
so heels are just not comfortable like I
think I don't have the shoe gene a lot
of girls like shoes and I just don't
Plus these ones are a hundred and thirty
dollars that's ridiculous
tgd next my price range is like $9.99 or
$14.99 yeah they're on sale seriously
these ones are more comfortable and
they're $19.99
that sounds good much better we still
think they'll get uncomfortable but can
you dance in them there it is
you guys it's snowin mystery weather is
so interesting I know it's like the
other places too but like it was so warm
just a day or two ago because we're
writing shorts and t-shirts and
flip-flops and like the forecast for
Monday is gorgeous but today snow
my clothes are okay a little bit of snow
there it's like it's snowing snowballs
it is the flakes are huge tonight
yeah
