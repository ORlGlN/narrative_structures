- There is a world record for the person
who can snort the most
times in 10 seconds.
(snorting)
(playful music)
(screaming)
-  How do you feel?
You just broke a world record.
- Awesome!
(gentle music)
(upbeat music)
- So, we got a box in the
mail today from Amazon.
And I'm excited to show
the kids what's inside.
(upbeat music)
- What is it?
- Yeah, what?
- It's Amazon Rapids.
- So, Amazon Rapids is a reading app
that you can get on a tablet or a device.
And it reads you these
stories and you can read them.
- Can we read this story?
- You wanna read this one?
- Yeah.
-  So this is called
Niko and the Sword of Light
and this story's called Danger and Eggs.
These books are from
shows on Amazon Prime.
They're Amazon original
shows that now also books
on Amazon Rapids.
- Can we read this one?
- Yeah, does it look cool?
- Do you wanna check out the app?
Okay, go ahead and click on Amazon Rapids.
Alright, we're gonna set up a profile.
Do your age and you get
to create an avatar.
-  Oh, choose a fun one.
- That one's so cool.
- That is a good one.
The ninja.
- As a mom with several
young, new readers,
I'm always looking for ways
to sneak in more reading time.
So I'm excited about this
reading app Amazon Rapids,
because since it's on the
device, the kids wanna
be on their devices anyway.
So this is a way that they
can turn their device time
into reading time.
And we're grateful to Amazon Rapids
for reaching out and
sponsoring our video today.
Okay, we we're gonna scroll through here
and this shows you all the
stories that are in here.
Look, they add new stories all the time.
So here's where they post the new ones.
Here's Niko and the Sword of Light.
Do you wanna hit that one?
We're going to read along.
Ready along.
-  I am Niko and
this is my sword of light.
I'm here to free my people and
defeat the darkness forever.
- So Caleb, these voices are
the same voices from the show.
- Can I read this one?
- Yeah, go for it.
- Gimme the rundown, Phillip.
-  Hit that one.
According to my notes, with last week's
Park World Record for
most detailed grass angel
combined with yesterday's
longest oboe blow,
you have set,
-  We have set.
-  Aww, thank you D.D.
We have set a grand total of
54 official park world records.
-  We will be
sitting, what's that word?
-  Touch it and here it.
-  Awesome.
- Awesome?
We will be sitting awesome.
-  Are you injured?
- My spleen is fine?
- Do you know what a spleen is?
- No.
- Okay, hold your finger down on it
and it'll tell you.
A spleen in an organ
located near your stomach.
-  I'm very familiar with the
official park world
records rule book rules.
When attempting the park world record
for most bikes ridden by
one person at one time.
-  Right here,
this is the glossary
and it shows us all the words
that we've learned about.
-  Like this one.
-  Awesome.
- Phillip, that's it.
- Really?
- Well sort of, I challenge
you to a staring contest.
- So they're gonna try
to break the world record
staring contest.
Do you wanna try it?
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna try a staring
contest with me right now?
- Yeah.
- Ready,
set,
go.
My eyes are already burning.
(techno music)
Come on, come on.
I blinked.
- I won.
- So there actually is a world record
for the longest staring contest.
Do you guys have any
guesses how long it is?
- Six minutes.
- An hour.
- An hour.
- I looked it up and the
world record for staring
is 40 minutes and 59 seconds.
- Caleb has it.
-  Caleb was close.
-  You were close dude.
So as we're looking into
the world records that are
out there, there are world
records for the craziest stuff.
There's a world record for
the person who can sort
the most times in 10 seconds.
Go!
(snorting)
Nice job Leesy, that
was a ton of snorting.
Ready, set, go.
(snorting)
Go!
(snorting)
(laughter)
It's hard to snort and
laugh at the same time.
-  No, it's more than 12.
-  Time's up.
(snorting)
-  Stop.
That was a ton.
-  She's focusing her chi.
- On my nose.
-  That was one.
(snorting and laughter)
Seven, eight,
nine, ten.
Your first snort was three seconds long.
- I was going for most unique snort.
(laughter)
Did I get longest snort maybe?
-  Go.
(snorting)
(upbeat music)
Stop.
(laughter)
- There wasn't enough oxygen coming in.
- Alright, well we need to look up
what the world record is for
most snorts in 10 seconds.
But first we want you to pause this video,
snort for 10 seconds and let us know
how many you get in the comments.
Alright, we looked it
up and the world record
for snorting in 10 seconds is 58 snorts.
- At least we did win
one world record today,
cutest baby in the world.
-  There she is.
You did it Jenae.
- We did it.
-  Alright, but
here's what really matters,
how many times can you snort?
- Can you snort?
-  Wait, I think I heard her.
(laughter)
- The next world record
we're gonna try to break
is on the trampoline.
It's how many times you can
go from your bum to your feet
in one minute.
42,
43,
44,
45,
46,
Stop!
You were only three away from the record.
Good job.
You were only three away
from the world record.
- Yeah.
-  You were working hard.
(laughter)
- Our next contestant, Isaac.
(cheers)
-  Go, one,
two,
three,
four,
(upbeat music)
45,
46,
47,
48,
49,
50,
51,
52,
53,
Stop!
53!
The world record holder, Isaac.
How do you feel, you just
broke a world record.
- Awesome.
-  That was
amazing, did you have 53?
- Yeah!
(upbeat music)
- Well I got 48 which was just
one short of the world record.
I don't know how they're
counting a seat drop though.
Maybe we're getting the wrong technique,
but if not, Isaac is
the world record holder.
- Alright, you guys see what I have here?
- Chocolate candy.
- Chocolate candy.
So here's the world record
we're gonna try to break.
We're gonna see how many
chocolate candies you can eat
in one minute using chop
sticks, blindfolded.
(upbeat music)
- I'm gonna do it backwards.
(giggles and cheers)
(giggles)
-  Disqualified.
-  Whoa.
You got two of them, good job.
For the world record is 20.
-  Will she get
one is the question.
- Use the other side.
- I'm trying to use it the way it's-
(giggles)
- Mom, use it like a spoon.
(cheers)
- I'm not trying to break the record,
I just want a chocolate candy.
-  You didn't get one.
There you go.
(cheers)
- I don't want my sleeve to get wet.
-  So you pulled the sleeves up?
(upbeat music)
So I wonder what the world record is
for the longest time to brush your teeth.
- I'm going for that.
-  You're going for it?
- So Jeremy and I try to be really careful
about which brands we
work with here on J House.
We know it's a good fit
when we are genuinely loving the product
and excited to tell our friends.
Right now our kids are in the other room,
I can see them, sitting over there
and they're all snuggled up reading some
of the stories on Amazon
Rapids on their own.
Not because we're videoing them.
Today, every friend that I saw,
I had to tell them
about the Amazon Rapids.
-  The fake cough.
One other cool thing about Amazon Rapids
is that it connects to the Echo,
which you've all seen that we love to use.
The story time skill can be used
with the books Danger and Eggs,
Niko and the Sword of Light
on Amazon Rapids by
doing this simple thing.
You guys, watch this.
Alexia, read me a bedtime story.
-  Resuming, The
Swamp of Sorrow Part one
by Patrick _.
- I read this one.
-  I'm here to free my people
and to defeat the darkness.
We have set a grand total of 54 official
park world records.
- We wanna thank Amazon Rapids for
sponsoring our video today
