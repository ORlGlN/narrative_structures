-  This is gonna end bad.
- Laura made me a necklace.
-  Lise's cartwheel.
- I forgot my uh, shoes.
- Shoes, 'kay?
No shoes.
So I was looking at this
amazing sunset this morning
and saw this rocket shoot into the sky.
We live in such an amazing time.
And I get to go play racketball.
("I Saw Three Ships")
- We're missing Joseph.
-  Where do you think he is?
- Well Laura took it in her room.
-  I like your new jacket.
- Thanks.
It's basically a vest.
-  It's cute.
- Thanks.
- Well I'm at the grocery store, again.
And it's just funny.
There's some weeks when
I'm super organized
and I meal plan and I online grocery shop.
And there's other weeks
when I am not that organized
and I have no idea what
we're having for dinner,
even though it's right before dinner time.
And those are the weeks when I find myself
at the grocery store over
and over and over again.
So, it happens.
I have a super fun craft
that I want to do with the kids
tomorrow that includes food.
And especially lots of fruit.
So I'm having fun buying
all the yummy stuff.
(bright music)
(Janae babbles)
-  Here we go little ma'am.
-  Umm.
(Janae and Jeremy babbling)
("Silent Night")
- And one, two, ready go.
("Joy to the World")
Keep going.
-  Nae Nae, you dancing?
There she's going.
You dancing too?
Nice.
Yeah!
Oh!
Yeah!
Nae Nae's dancing brings
us so much happiness.
(singing in foreign language)
You are so adorable.
- I think your name could be Granny Kay.
-  Like how you got Granny Jo?
- Um hmm.
- I could be Granny Kay?
- What about Mommy Kay?
- Mommy Kay?
- But you have a mom.
- Okay, so in the comments, I wanna hear
what do you call your grandparents?
I grew up pretty traditional.
We had Grandma and Grandpa
and Grandmom and Grandad.
Our kids call their grandparents
lots of different names.
They've got Granny Jo, Poppy Rod,
they've got Grandma, Mugga, Poppa.
So there's lots of names out there.
I think it'd be fun to have
a cute little pet name.
I'm gonna have to think about this.
But luckily I've got some serious time.
The favorite grandparent
name that I've ever heard
is Mema and Pepa.
That would just be really funny.
Like oh Mema and Pepa are coming over.
-  So Nae Nae is
starting to open cupboards.
And it is gonna be a problem.
Look, this is the puzzle drawer.
Look, do you see all the puzzles in there?
-  See the puzzle?
(Janae babbles)
- We're trying to rememorize everything.
- Let's go to the next one.
- These two are spending
more and more time
looking at sports stats, analyzing them
and talking about it.
It's pretty fun.
- In between yours I think,
Cameron Jordan my favorite that.
You're only by Barrett.
- Do you like my earrings?
And my necklace and my barrette?
I got from this toy.
-  It's a pretty cool toy.
- You can build earrings with it.
-  Can you make me some jewelry?
- Well, you're too big.
I'm getting my bracelets on.
(bright music)
My sleeves up.
I look pretty.
-  So pretty.
-  What are you guys working on?
- We're making it long.
- Really longest.
- Super long.
- Super duper long.
-  How are you gonna make it long?
- From getting all of those, the beads.
-  Whoa?
- Look how big it is?
It's bigger than me,
almost bigger than me standing already.
Putting it up right here.
-  Whoa, it is
already bigger than you.
- Get it bigger than you.
- Than me?
- Yeah.
- 'Kay, good luck.
Keep building.
- This is where we are.
-  Yep, that's where we are.
Laura, what does this say?
Where do we live?
- I don't know.
-  You don't know?
-  The United States of America.
- Yep, that's where we live.
So Caleb, do you remember Brazil?
That's where the last Olympics was held.
So a friend of mine recently
was getting rid of this.
It's just a piece of fabric, but it's map.
And I thought it'd be so cool
to have a map that's large
and that I can just lay out on the ground
and we can look at stuff.
So I'm excited to use it.
Laura made me a necklace
and some earrings.
- Um hmm.
-  She wouldn't make me any,
she said I was too big.
- Aw. (laughs)
She said you were too big?
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
I got a pretty necklace though.
You look so nice.
- Thank you.
And I brought her some earrings.
- You did, you made me earrings.
Do you wanna put something on 'em?
- Sure, I'll get it.
-  Right there.
- Is it hurting?
- In that spot.
She's trying to put it like
all the way on to the inner.
-  Okay, put the jewel on.
There we go.
'Kay, then Mommy'll put it on.
-  Fancy.
- So Elise and I are working
on the outline for her story.
Do you remember what it's called?
- The Christmas Duck.
- Isaac is typing up the
first draft of his book.
-  So how many
words do you have so far?
- 281.
-  Keep up the good work.
- Yeah.
- So I taped it
so that nobody can get into it.
-  But we need
to put the toy back in.
We need to get it all cleaned up.
- Okay, then you guys
can take off the tape.
- Do you think you can rip it off?
Parenting tip.
Tape does not come off of tables
as easy as you would think.
(playful music)
(Kendra laughs)
Just don't cut yourself man.
Laura's obsessed with tape right now.
I don't know how she gets ahold of it.
Like we put it up, we hide it places.
And then boom.
Tape, everywhere.
Sometimes you just can't get it off.
Problem is, is she
can't get it off either.
So it's always Laura,
- I take it off.
- you have to clean it up.
She can't do it.
Did you get it?
Yeah, no.
-  No, I can't.
(Isaac laughs)
-  Good save.
This is fun.
-  And then I land like this.
-  Is that the end?
- Um hmm.
-  My show is so long.
(playful music)
-  So what are you guys doing?
- We're seeing who can go the longest.
- Be careful.
- But it has to be going fast.
-  This is gonna end bad.
Oh my, okay now, everyone
try to walk straight.
(laughing)
It worked pretty good.
How does it feel?
(laughing)
Nae Nae's just like walking
along the wall here.
(laughing)
Be careful.
- We're gonna play basketball.
-  Yeah, we are.
- That's weird.
It used to be over here.
- It's been crazy windy
here the last couple days.
And it blew over the basketball hoop.
(happy music)
Hey!
Hello.
It's getting pretty dark out there guys.
We have to get ready for
gymnastics soon, okay?
Oh, you're out Isaac!
Parenting fail moment.
We just drove here to
gymnastics and Laura announces
once we get here:
- I forgot my um, shoes.
- Shoe, 'kay?
No shoes and we're here.
So I'm gonna carry her
into gymnastics now.
Alright, let's go.
(upbeat music)
How was gymnastics?
- Good.
I learned tuck jumps.
- Tuck jumps.
- Yeah.
- You got a sucker though.
You getting sticky everywhere?
- No.
I just got water.
So Elise is showing us some of the things
she's been learning in gymnastics.
-  She's been working hard.
- Whoa.
- What?
- And then watch what
I can do with my split.
-  Whoa, very good!
Hey, show us your cartwheel.
-  Lise's cartwheel.
(Kendra cheering)
Good job big girl.
You have made so much progress.
- Uh huh.
-  So proud of you.
- My turn.
-  We're really proud of you.
(Kendra cheers)
Round off.
How was violin?
- Good.
Goodnight, J House out.
♪ The is the best rolini ever ♪
- That is beautiful Mom.
-  How did you do it?
- It's like stars.
- I'm on a kind of emotional
roller coaster right now.
