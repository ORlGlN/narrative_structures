proud of them for trying something new
it's uncomfortable to try new things you

and to stand up and know that you might
make a mistake in front of everybody and
I'm just proud of them for trying like
this is a new experience for them and it
didn't matter to us whether they won or
live won or lost
we just wanted them to have the
experience and they were both brave and
even though they were feeling nervous
they stood up and they did it and I just
know so often in life like I don't want
my fears to hold me back from having
wonderful new experiences and sometimes
I'm scared of things and it's hard to
try in the face of failure but I think
that's true bravery and so I'm proud of
my brave kids and we're going to go
