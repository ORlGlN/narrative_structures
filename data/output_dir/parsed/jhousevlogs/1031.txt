(Mother and Kids singing Happy Birthday)
(exhales through nose)
-  Oh sick!
I guess you didn't want to have to
share those cinnamon rolls!
- I guess my nose was clogged.
-  That is sick.
- I was gonna try to blow
it out with my nose air,
but I wasn't able to.
-  Very nice,
and no one can taste
daddy's cinnamon rolls.
- That's embarrassing.
(upbeat violin music)
- I love my daddy.
-  Did you get a sour one?
- Cracking a egg!
- So you do this.
Good job.
- Alright Isaac let's see it.
Heeeey, nice work.
Okay, I think we got the Sprite in there.
What are you guys plugging your ears for?
- Yeah it, it makes a pretty cool sound.
-  What's it gonna do, Caleb?
- Make a esplode.
-  He thinks it's gonna explode.
- Alright guys then you're
gonna be pretty excited
to see what happens, are you ready?
(Jeremy mimics explosion)
- Yeah.
It wasn't loud.
- It wasn't loud.
- So for my birthday my family came over.
So this is my brother Brent.
So over the last month I've
introduced Brent a couple times.
I'm not gonna edit you out this time,
I'm actually gonna keep this in.
So we'll keep being at different events
that I end up not throwing in the vlog.
-  Hi Brent and Michelle.
- Hey guys.
- So this is my brother Brent.
I've introduced him like seven times
but then I edit him out every time.
This is Brent.
-  We'll edit him out.
- Yeah we're gonna edit
you out this time again.
I'm gonna keep the birthday in.
- I'm just not up to par I guess.
- You guys.
- I'm so excited!
- I'm finally gonna be in the video.
- We have to, we can't
cut him out this time.
So tell us what you did.
- So I was informed after
my son went to the bathroom
- Number two.
- That this toilet was out of commission
because somebody had previously flushed
at least three toothbrushes
down the toilet.
- We've been wanting
to like tape it closed.
- So since my son was
responsible for using it,
I felt I should help plunge it,
and fortunately while I was plunging.
- Wait let's see, let's see what happened.
It's been so hard to not have
a bathroom toilet for the kids.
- So I was plunging and
plunging, I was almost done,
and then all of a sudden
one of those toothbrushes
floated back up into the toilet,
so then I just kept going,
the other two came up also.
- There might be more,
y'know who knows what else is down there,
but at least we have three.
- If attorney-ing doesn't work for me,
I've got plumbing in my future.
-  Yell.
Jump rope.
Monster.
- Beast.
-  Cup, football, hike, center.
You're the center.
-  Pocket knife.
-  Jackknife.
-  Sleeve.
-  Calculator, calculate.
Secret, whisper.
-  Rumor, gossip.
-  Nailed it.
-  Poison.
-  Cubby you guessing?
Bird!
-  Fly!
- Yes, fly fly fly.
- C'mere.
Bigamist.
-  Well that
would have been tough.
Dance, he's dancing, we got it!
Baby!
Good job, hit it again bud.
Snake!
-  Animal!
- Hee haw.
-  A donkey, a donkey!
Ballerina, ballet.
- It was ballerina.
-  Whale, air hole.
-  Airplane, shark, fin.
-  Oh, harpoon.
Oh a sting ray!
-  What?!
Sassy.
-  Stripper!
-  You should have pointed at Caleb!
-  I should have pointed at Caleb.
- I think we just went to PG-13.
Brent, this is why we
edit you out every time.
You're so gross and immature.
- Is it time to eat cake?
(singing Happy Birthday)
(clapping, cheering)
- Why do people have candles
and have fire on them
and blow them out, why do they do that?
-  What do you think, Caleb,
why do we have candles and fire
and blow 'em out for our birthdays?
- And so we can make a wish.
-  Do you understand now?
- But there should be another reason.
Like why do we blow it out to make a wish,
why would we do it?
- We're gonna have to
work on teaching them
not to talk while they're eating.
