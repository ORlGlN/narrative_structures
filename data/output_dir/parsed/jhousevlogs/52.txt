-  When you eat this cake tomorrow
you're gonna be eight years old.
- Welcome to our hotel.
-  It's so good to see ya.
(cheerful music)
- And a seagull flew by and took
the whole granola bar out of her hands.
- Good morning.
We woke up today to the best text ever.
Granny Jo and Papa Keith
have landed at the airport,
and they are on our way
to come to our house.
We were a little bit surprised,
because we thought they
were coming in later today,
so I come out to the kitchen and I said,
"Red alert! They're gonna be here soon!"
And the kids jumped
up, squealing with joy,
and we all hurried and cleaned the house
probably the fastest that I've ever seen
the house get cleaned,
so that's a good thing.
It's amazing what motivated kids can do
to clean up a house.
- So this is what I made. (chuckles)
Isn't it beautiful?
-  You made it for Granny Jo?
- Mm-hmm.
-  It is very beautiful.
- And I need these seashells.
-  You're kinda just designing it?
- Yeah.
- So everything looks super nice.
I like how you used seashells
and plants and my car keys.
Can I actually take those car keys?
- No.
- I had to rescue the car keys,
but the rest of the design
I'm letting her work with.
So why are making this pretty design?
- For fun.
-  For fun.
Well it looks really nice.
I like your dress you chose today.
- Oh, thank you.
- Welcome to our hotel.
-  So this is the room where
Granny Jo and Papa Keith are gonna stay.
- And then this is some stuff.
-  Tell us about it.
-  So this says,
"Welcome to J Hotel."
-  So we got some Peanut M&M's
and all the kids wrote notes.
Thank you for coming to our
house, from Caleb, to Granny Jo.
Dear Granny Jo and Papa
Keith, thank you for coming,
I'm excited to have you here.
Welcome to J Hotel, love, Isaac.
Laura wrote her name.
So Elise, what do you call today?
- Elise Eve!
-  Why is today Elise Eve?
- 'Cause tomorrow's my birthday.
-  Tomorrow's her birthday!
How old are you gonna be?
- Eight!
- And I'm gonna be four!
-  You're gonna be four?
- Mm-hmm!
-  When are you gonna be four?
- Four days, I think.
-  It's six days.
- Oh.
-  Six days.
-  You've got six
days 'til your birthday.
- That's a lot.
-  They're here!
-  What do you guys see?
- They're here!
(excited chatter)
- It's so good to see ya.
-  It's Granny Jo and Papa Keith!
- I've grown!
- You are.
-  All by myself!
- All by yourself, that
is amazing, look at that.
Oh my goodness.
-  J Hotel. (laughs)
- And we helped, and we helped you share.
-  Jeremy emerged.
- (chuckles) Hi.
-  Thanks for coming.
- So what we're doing is we're assembling
our dinner, we're making shish
kabobs for dinner tonight,
so we're getting it all done this morning
so we can go out and
play, and then get home
and just pop them on the
grill and eat dinner.
And everybody's helping.
(latin music)
What happened?
- I started crying.
- 'Cause you're working with the onions?
It happens.
Laura just came running in to me,
"Papa Keith's in the tree,
Papa Keith's in the tree!"
-  Come see!
-  Come see?
Papa Keith is in the tree!
- Hey, we're just a bunch
of monkeys in the tree.
- Elise is wanting to
try to climb the tree.
One, two, three.
-  Oh, hey, way to go, Elise.
-  You can do it.
-  Yeah!
-  There she is.
How much are we gonna
try to put in this tree?
- It's a little bit awkward.
Do I jump and try to lift myself up?
-  There's nothing,
this can't go wrong.
- (laughs) Do I do the leg lift?
Or do I lift myself up, or--
(both laugh)
-  Jeremy has a lot of strengths,
but he's not super flexible,
he's not super flexible.
There he goes, oh!
Oh. (laughs)
- I'm laughing too hard.
It's too funny. (laughs)
All right, there we go.
I am a tree climber.
-  How many
people are we gonna fit
in this tree up here?
-  Hi, Dada.
-  Hi, you want in?
- Hey!
- Hi, Da.
-  Hi, Dad.
(beat music)
So today we're bringing
Granny Jo and Papa Keith
out to La Jolla Cove, we
haven't been here before,
and it is already gorgeous.
We hear there's some seals,
so we're hoping to find them.
Look at how the water crashes, guys!
Is this gorgeous?
- I could just watch the ocean all day.
- I don't see any seals.
-  We're not
in the right spot yet.
Do you see a bunch of seals?
- Yeah.
- Right there, they look like rocks.
(bouncy keyboard music)
-  Do you see the birdies?
(Janae vocalizes)
(relaxing music)
Careful, Laura.
(laughs)
I got soaked!
Completely wet. (laughs)
The waves all of a sudden came
in and I got completely wet.
I hope the camera's okay,
I kind of bashed it.
So I was down pretty close to the water,
but no waves were getting
me, and then out of nowhere,
two huge waves combined, and I got soaked.
It was really funny.
- I saw him, and it was funny. (laughs)
(light guitar music)
-  Here I am again!
(squeals)
Jeremy has to just walk. (laughs)
Hi, Nae-Nae.
(Janae verbalizes)
- So we gave all the kids granola bars,
and I had Laura up on my
shoulders and she was eating it,
and a seagull flew by and took
the whole granola bar out
of her hands and flew away.
-  And flew off with it.
- It was insane.
- Poor Laura, it was pretty sad.
Luckily we have another one.
- That looks like a Dr. Seuss tree.
-  You're right.
- Dr. Seuss lived here in La Jolla,
and he got the inspiration for the trees
in The Lorax from these
trees at this park.
-  That's really cool.
-  Here, you
just take a little bit.
I will watch for the birds.
She's a little traumatized
about granola bars.
Here they come.
Eat it quick.
(Kendra laughs)
-  We'll stand around you.
- Poor Laura's a little bit
nervous about the seagulls,
but she wants to eat a granola
bar, so Dad's protecting her.
- Don't mess.
-  Shoo!
-  Just keep eatin'.
- They're like flying around,
they're all circling in.
- Oh, 'cause there's one right there!
(seal barking)
All right, what's your guess?
How much does an adult harbor seal weigh?
- He says maybe 400, for an adult.
-  400, you thought 100.
- I said about 110.
- I thought, like, 55.
Isaac thought 25.
-  No, no--
- Caleb, what do you think?
- 25.
- 25 pounds?
- I thought that they weighed 250.
- I think about like 560?
- It's hard, 'cause there's baby ones,
and then adult ones.
- Well, I think it depends
for a male versus a female,
but my guess is 150 pounds.
-  What's the answer?
- Males weigh up to 375 pounds,
and females weigh up to 330 pounds.
(groove music)
- So we were hoping to find
a playground on the beach,
but I think this is cooler
than a normal playground.
The trees.
Do you feel the mist on your hair?
- So it's starting to
mist, and Laura asked me,
"Mom, what kind of a storm is this?"
It's just the fog coming in, I think.
There's a cave down there!
I wanna go, but we're done and we're tired
and we're ready to go.
Another time.
So we're headed home, and it turns out
this wasn't just the fog coming in.
It's definitely raining, so we walked back
to our car in the rain.
But the good news is, as we were driving,
we drove past a
Lamborghini, so we actually
circled back around 'cause
the kids wanted to see it.
So here's the question,
how much do you think
a Lamborghini costs?
- I thought $300,000.
-  $300,000.
- 441.
-  441 from Laura.
Caleb, what do you think?
- $20.
-  $20.
- I would say $700,000.
-  All right, Leesie?
- Um, $1,000.
-  $1,000.
I can't guess 'cause I
looked up the correct answer.
The starting price for
Lamborghinis is $200,000.
- So tomorrow is Elise's birthday,
and the kids are starting
to wrap their presents
that they got for her.
All right, the boys combined
to get a present for her.
Go ahead and cut it up, Isaac.
She's gonna love this.
-  So what are we making?
- My breakfast cake.
I always--
-  For what?
- My birthday.
I always have it every single time,
on my birthday.
-  And Granny Jo's gonna help her.
You guys are gonna work
together and make it, right?
- And how many of the teaspoons
are we supposed to have?
- Four?
- Four, mm-hmm.
- Four.
- Four, okay, excellent, so we've got
our baking powder in now.
-  Hey, Laura, you know what the
number four reminds me of?
- My birthday!
(piano music)
- Now take your thumbs and
pull the shell apart, yeah.
You know what, I think you did--
-  Good job!
Nice.
Are you guys playing with some Legos?
-  Yeah.
- It's like our, it's like us.
-  It's our Lego picture?
- Yeah.
-  Nice.
- Dad and Papa look so
much alike, kind of.
-  You're right.
-  One, two, three.
-  Seven, eight, nine.
-  Caleb, that is looking awesome.
- Sugar.
- Yep, this is the best
part, this is the topping.
Janae wants some and I
won't give it to her.
I'm a mean, mean mom. (Janae screeches)
There we go, mmm.
So Leesie, when you
eat this cake tomorrow,
you're gonna be eight years old.
- I know.
- These shish kabobs smell amazing.
(bright music)
What's our new read-aloud?
- All-of-a-Kind Family by Sydney Taylor.
I think we should end the day
with a good night J House out
from a seven year-old who
will never be seven again!
- Good night, J House out.
-  Do do do doo!
- Nailed it.
-  Laura, how does the seashell
let us hear the ocean?
- I don't know!
(bouncy music)
- (gasps) She just did it again!
It's so cute, and I'm losing my mind.
I'm making some last-minute purchases
to get ready for Elise's birthday.
