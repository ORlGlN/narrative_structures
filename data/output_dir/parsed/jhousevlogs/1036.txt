-  Alright,
lazy mom cooking today.
We're making sugar cookies.
And we are rolling it out
and patting it out and
we are gonna get ready to cut it out.
Caleb, what shape do you wanna cut out?
- Um...
A pumpkin.
-  Ooh, you're gonna do a pumpkin?
- It's a heart so I can love everybody.
Because there's a friend
that had a baby and we are
making cookies for them and
I want it to have a heart.
-  Oh, that's so sweet!
Isaac, what shape are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna do a football
because it's football season.
-  She wrote it herself.
"I love looking at your
new baby, from Elise"
(upbeat string music)
-  What's going on, Laura?
(children giggling)
So she totally just climbed
over that bar somehow.
It was so funny to look
over and she was dangling.
She couldn't touch on either
side and I ran for the camera.
I just decided to shower and get ready.
And uh...
Hair fail!
Am I right?
(Laura cries)
I know!
-  She's pretty sad about it.
-  I come out and
Jeremy's just looking at me like,
what happened?
-  It looks great!
(laughs)
-  I diffused
it with sea salt spray.
I don't know what happened but...
-  Something happened.
- Something happened.
We're gonna have to fix that.
- We're going for the
wild and crazy foofy look.
-  Lioness, rawr!
What do you guys think of my hair?
- Crazy!
- It looks crazy but still nice.
-  Awww.
-  What a nice boy!
What do you think?
-  Crazy and funny!
-  Wow, your voice
sounds just like Elise!
-  Oh, yeah.
Yeah, mom.
I think you look good.
- What do you want to say
about your sister Elise?
-  I love her and I kiss her.
(Jeremy chuckles)
And I tickle her!
-  Why are you
chewing on your thumb, Laura?
-  Because I like to.
-  What about your brother Caleb?
What do you think about him?
-  He stinks!
- Is it so bad, should I just
go jump back in the shower?
Am I just done?
- No, I have to go back to work.
You can't jump in the shower.
It looks good.
This is like when it's time
to go and we're late and
they put on something and
you don't even look and
you're like, it looks good, let's go!
- Alright, so we're
running late somewhere.
But I had to come back in
the house to get duct tape.
Caleb has learned to undo
his car seat buckle and
he won't stay in his car seat.
I don't know what to do about it.
So I'm going to try duct
taping my child's belt shut.
So hopefully he can't get it open.
I'm at a complete loss.
I have to go somewhere and I can't have
a two-year-old just running around my car.
So I buckled just around there.
I don't know, that can't be
safe in case of an emergency.
But what are you supposed
to do when your child
won't stay in the car seat?
He took the duct tape off his buckle
and put it on his mouth.
-  And he was unbuckled.
- And he unbuckled again.
Speechless.
So I just had a really
sweet moment with Lisie-Loo.
I went to a women's meeting
at church tonight and
I tend to get really shy before
those kinds of meetings and
I just get kind of nervous.
And I came home and I
told Elise that I felt
a little bit shy at the meeting.
And she was so sweet and
she held me in her arms and
she gave me a big hug and she said,
"Mom, let me tell you about
a time when I felt shy."
And then she told me
about a time when she was
shy the first time and
then she tried again and
she felt better the second time.
So then she told me, "Mom,
you'll just have to try again
and maybe next time it will be better."
And then she asked me
if I met any friends.
This is a really tender
motherhood moment for me because
I feel like so often as a mom,
I don't know what I'm doing
and I'm just trying and
sometimes I feel like
everything's failing and
it's all falling apart.
And I feel like this was
one of those nights where
there was this little glimmer
that something is working.
I guess it felt really good to feel like
all those times of trying
to validate and understand
and share experiences
with her when she's having
a hard time, that when she
saw me having a hard time,
that was her first thought
was to try to comfort me by
validating and connecting with me
and I just love this little goober.
This little girlie is
one of my best friends.
I love her.
