look at her
look at that phase okay so one other
thing we have to fit into our plans
today is we have to go back out to the
golf course because they found my brain
that is like you guys were praying for
us right yeah it was on the eighth hole
the one where I crushed it and hit it
really far and I was running down around
the hill so one of their maintenance
workers found it out somewhere on the
eighth hole yeah so we're gonna have to
go get it all right let's do it
so for Christmas this year my parents
gave our family a membership to the
Kansas City Science City which is the
children's like science museum but the
coolest part is that it has like a
connection to 300 other children's
museums around the nation and so we can
go visit those as well and so we're
actually going with my parents today to
the Arizona Science Center
is it making music
you know you're at a good place with
your kids when you're having more fun
than they are
their tools the section we're in right
now is all about homes and how they're
building like what's underneath the
walls and how everything's constructed
it's really cool to be here with Papa
because that's something that Papa's so
good at and he can explain so other the
kids do you see all the studs and the
pipes you connected it now our sink will
work the kids are learning why the shape
of a toilet goes that way and it's
because why Isaac your nose
because of your nose if it went straight
down I'll be stinky creates a water trap
come down the stomach when you come out
it makes noises so you sliding noises is
awesome hey look that's beating the drum
every time your heart beats
she's spinning
Urmi is laying on a bed of nails oh
she's doing it you're laying on the
nails oh this is your work did you get
the fan to turn on can I turn it back on
whoo well it's definitely nap time for
the kids
hopefully they fall asleep on the drive
back all right so the museum wasn't far
from the golf pro shop so I got the ring
and my hand doesn't feel naked anymore
I still just can't believe that they
found it out on the golf course so it's
a huge miracle
what are you doing down there
we're getting ready to take Tiffany and
Jimmy and their family they're our
Christmas gift for them yes it's really
late but there's one more element that
we need to make the gift usable today
she won't keep any of her hair rubber
bands or hair pins in and so she always
looks like kind of a crazy person
it looks crazy yet but she always takes
out her hair things maybe she is just a
crazy person when you go to the grocery
store for kids you just get used to the
stairs

ponytail is that right
