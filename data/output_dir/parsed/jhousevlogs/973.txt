- So it's Monday morning
and it's been a rough Monday morning.
We're recovering from
the family being sick
and we've had several
tantrums this morning.
We're trying to get things going.
I've got to head off to work
and I think we're just
feeling kind of like weak
and Monday's winning so far,
but we hope to catch up.
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy from The Nutcracker")
- We all know my favorite way
to get rid of a bad Monday
is to dance it off
and I love that I was dancing
and then I got out the camera
and no matter what I do,
they're just doing that.
Like, they don't even notice.
They don't even care.
They're like, "Crazy Mom is at it again."
Anyway, I've got to dance
off some steam this morning.
Gotta kick Monday's butt.
That's what I gotta do.

Is You" by Mariah Carey)

After several days of sickness,
I am so sick of cartoons
on the TV being on
and so I was determined today, no TV,
but honestly I'm still not
feeling back to normal.
Laura's super cranky and Caleb won't nap.
So I'm letting them have one show
and I'm choosing not to
feel guilty about it.
They're watching "How The
Grinch Stole Christmas."
- I want to watch The Cat in the Hat one
when this one is done.
-  Nope.
We're just watchin' one today.
- But I want The Cat in the Hat one
because I like The Cat in the Hat.
- And that's how that's going,
but I wanted to show you
guys what Isaac was up to.
He is reading a book, a
biography of Walt Disney
and so I turned around and
this is what he's up to.
- He was a artist so he colored the stuff
for the movies, so I'm wanting to do it.
-  So he wants to be an artist
and so he's creating
pictures to make into movies.
What's your movie gonna be about?
- The haunted house.
- Laura is totally becoming a human,
as in an interactive part
of our playing experience.
She's getting into things
which is an adjustment for the kids
and the kids are actually
playing with her more.
It's really cute.
(toy siren)
(piano music)
(crying)
- Caleb, I need you to share with Laura.
Caleb, let's share with Laura.
(piano music)
Caleb, be so soft to her.
- But Laura gonna bonk into these bumps.
- You don't want her to go in those spots?
(mumbles)
So Caleb went down for
a nap, a super late nap
which I may regret later,
but I'm really grateful for at the moment.
Isaac and Elise are playing
downstairs in the basement
which is a complete wreck.
Like it's a disaster zone down there,
so I'm just letting
them play at the moment
because I am getting one-on-one
time with little Laura.
So, I'm ignoring my laundry.
I am ignoring the fact that I have no idea
what we're doing for dinner
and I'm ignoring my dirty kitchen
because I want to play with my baby.
She is growing up so fast.
So here we are.
Let's play, huh?
- Dah.
- Dah?
Oh, you are precious.
Oh, you want to sit on my lap?
You want to sit right here by me?
(tapping)
(mumbling)
Oh, you gonna stand up?
You gonna stand up?
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.
Oh, look at you.
So, we are headed into
Elise's parent watch day
at her ballet class.
-  So you have
to put your legs very...
Melts like you're a snowball who's melting
and sit up very tall.
Now, turn to the side.
Yeah, good ladies.
Toes.
Alright.
Sit back on your knees for...
Turn the corner, Elise.
Good.
Backwards.
Keep comin' all the way to me.
Up to the top of your point.
Close first.
I love your legs today.
Up to the top.
And close together.
Now this foot we're going
to put our heel down.
And jump.
And land, but you still have to jump.
Plie.
Jump.
(clapping)
Nice job.
Front.
Open side.
Point to the side.
Tuck your toes.
And curtsy.
Close first.
-  Lise-ee, how was your class?
- It's fun.
-  It's fun.
What's your favorite part?
- All of it.
-  Are you being silly?
Did a Google Live hangout tonight
with some vlogging friends.
Super fun.
- Yeah.
It's a lot of nice people
that we like to hang out with.
They're all vlogging right now too.
We're a bunch of weirdos.
- But we're all weird
together and that's nice.
(keyboard music)
-  The haunted house
by Isaac.
Once upon a time, in Kansas and Missouri,
there was a mysterious
house that one day a year
there would be a haunted day.
Their names were Ella, Michael,
Abbey, Walter, and Jordan.
Out of nowhere ghosts and bats appeared.
To be continued.
