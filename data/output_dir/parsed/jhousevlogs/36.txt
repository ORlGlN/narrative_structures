- My baby just took her first steps.
(happy music)
Come on do it, come see Mama!
- You guys!
(excited squealing)
- It is early, it is like 6:30 right now.
And we are getting ready
to go back to Kansas City,
and so I'm trying to start waking
the kids up a little bit earlier
each day, so that hopefully
the time change difference
isn't as big of a deal when
they get home, because it's time
to get ready to go home,
we're going to spend the day
packing and cleaning and
kind of getting things
in order for us when we
arrive back in Kansas city.
- So this morning I'm
going to yoga at the beach.
I'm really excited about it,
it's a little crowded though,
so hopefully I get a spot.
(happy music)
- So while Kendra is doing yoga,
we are playing at a nearby park.
(happy music)
- Dad, this can be our house.
We're making a house,
an underground house.
I get the villain is trying
to, guess we'll just jump it.
-  Wow.
The fort's getting bigger.
- I know.
See how good that is?
-  Looks great.
(reggae music)
Looks great buddy.
All right?
- It was amazing to do
yoga, feeling the sun
and the breeze, and hearing
the ocean and the seagulls,
it was, beautiful, and
I wish I could bottle up
all these feelings and save
them for when I get back
to Kansas City, because I
know it's gonna be cold,
and I'm gonna be wanting
to experience this again.
(rock music)
-  You helping me clean up?
- Yeah.
Tearing this down so
then we can take it home.
- So we actually still have
a couple days until we leave
for Missouri, but we wanted
to start getting everything
ready so it wasn't super stressful
on our last day or two here.
(happy music)
(Laura laughing)
-  Does it have instructions?
All right, we found some
folding instructions.
(nylon folding)
- And the coils come together.
(Laura laughing)
-  Bow in frame to form a coil.
Your right hand under your left hand.
And this will form --
(Jeremy laughing)
-  But you got an extra one.
That's the one I always
have still hanging out.
Like I can get it except
for that last little one.
You don't wanna break it!
Op!
See daisies.
- Right hand under your left hand?
-  We tried that.
You still have some hanging out.
- Oh!
-  What?
- I did it!
-  How?
- I honestly don't know.
We're just gonna --
-  You meant too.
- Pretend that was on purpose.
-  Good job.
- Okay, open it up.
Easy peasy squeezy.
- So all Jenae wants to
do this morning is walk.
She wants us to hold her
hands, and walk her around,
all the kids are taking turns,
and she is going to town.
- She'll be whining, and then once
we do this, she's like, ah!
- Let's see what happens.
- Come on do it, come see Mama.
- You guys.
(excited squealing)
-  She did it!
She did it!
Oh my goodness!
Come see me!
Come see me!
(excited squealing)
(excited squealing)
-  She walks!
-  She's a walker!
-  That's our girl!
(excited squealing)
- My baby just took her
first steps, and I'm feeling
all emotional about it,
because I don't think I'm ready
for her to be so grown up, and
big, I feel like I'm trying
so hard to cherish all these
little milestones with her.
And they're so precious,
so it's fun to enjoy them
as a family, and I'm so proud
of her, like she's so happy
about it, she's been
wanting and wanting to walk.
So I'm excited to see her
progress, but I know that soon
she's gonna be running, and
keeping up with the big kids,
and I'm just like, where's my little baby?
She's growing up.
I feel like that sounds
so cliched, but having had
several kids, and seeing
how quickly they grow up,
I feel like I get more
sentimental each time.
Like, it's just going by so quickly.
They're, pretty soon gonna
all be grown up and out
of the house, and I'm gonna be all alone.
With Jeremy.
Okay Jeremy's pretty cool.
I'll take him.
-  I love you.
So he just finished Percy Jackson.
What'd'you think?
- I loved it.
-  How would
you compare it to some
of the other books that you've read?
- Well, I think it starts
kind of like Wonder,
and then it ends like Star
Wars-ish, mixed with Greek Gods.
-  So kind of fantasy?
- Uh huh.
-  Would you recommend it?
- Yes, I'd recommend it, for people
that are like my age or older.
-  Do you want
to read the next one?
- I'm going to, and totally beyond it.
- Kendra checked it out from the library,
but first we had to pay
our library fines, of over 35 dollars.
Apparently we didn't get all of the books
back to the library before
we left to San Diego.
(happy music)
-  What flavor did you pick?
- Pineapple.
-  Awesome.
What flavor did you do?
- Brown sugar.
-  Brown sugar.
- There we go!
-  Yummy!
- Laura's is lychee cream.
-  What flavor did you do?
- Lime cream.
- Okay so, I ended up getting
what's called a flight here,
and it's where you can get
several different
flavors, on little cones.
- They're so cute!
And yes, this is Jeremy's.
- Yeah.
So I gotta peanut butter
Snickers, and cool bean,
coconut banana macadamia
nut, black cherry chocolate
something something,
sorbet, and toasted coconut.
- Let's just say that it's
a good thing we didn't
discover this place at
the beginning of our trip.
-  What flavor is that?
- Brown sugar.
She really went for that!
Our current favorite to listen
to in the car is the Annie soundtrack.

(reggae music)
- We're up in Oceanside,
walking along the pier.
(reggae music)
(happy music)
-  There' a ton of clams.
(happy music)
-  Please stand back.
We are wild brown pelicans
and we bite stupid people.
- This is definitely the
longest pier I've walked
out on, and it's just
amazing to be so far out,
into the ocean, to look back on the shore,
and it's just really
peaceful and calm out here.
It's beautiful.
So how do you think they built the pier?
How do you come all the way out
into the ocean and make a pier?
- No idea.
-  We're gonna have to look it up.
Scuba divers out here.
As always, Jenae is happy to
see any dogs and birds here.
Here comes another bird, Jenae!
Look!
- Ah!
- Ah!
- I'm glad Laura's not eating
a granola bar right now.
-  Yeah.
She'll never eat a granola bar again.
Traumatized.
(happy music)
- Yes.
Jenae is cheering for the surfers.
(laughing)
- Yay!
I'm so glad we made it down
to the pier during sunset.
And it's gonna be beautiful tonight.
(bells chiming)
(tranquil music)
-  Good night.
(rock music)
(Jenae laughing)
