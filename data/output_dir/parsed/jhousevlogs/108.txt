-  Super Laura!
Not a poop your pants face.
- No, you give me mad and then
I'll show you my mad face.
(dad laughs)
(upbeat Latin music)
- And there's not just one of them,
there's more than one.
Is this a thing and I had no idea?
(upbeat Latin music)
-  What did you just do?
- I put Honey Nut Cheerios
with my apple sauce.
Mmmm.
-  So, it's okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- We're running really low on milk,
and so, I got apple
sauce for them to have,
not with Cheerios, but she
wanted to combine it so...
Whatever.
-  Caleb is teaching Laura today,
how to help unload the dishwasher.
Laura is working hard.
- Work!
- Good job.
And just make sure you
don't like throw 'em,
make sure it looks more clean.
-  Line them up, so they're nice.
- That looks super nice.
- Thanks.
-  Hey, there you are.
I'm over here, come this way.
She's like, "I don't fit."
Looks like Janae wants to help.
- You're so good, Janae.
Laura, you're doing a great job.
- I hand it to you and
you put 'em right there.
-  Good teamwork.
Nae Nae wants to play.
Hi!
I'm folding my friend's
laundry this morning
and it's amazing how much more fun it is
to do jobs for other people
than just for yourself.
Folding laundry, our own laundry,
not really my favorite,
but for some reason
doing it for other people
is really more fun.
- All right.
Super Laura!
Super Laura!
(epic music)
- I'm Super Monster!
-  Super Monster?
What does Super Monster do to people?
- They save people.
-  They save people?
Okay, show us how to save Leesie.
- Oh hello, monster.
Ahh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
-  Thank you, Super Monster.
- You're welcome!
-  Unloading the groceries
is pretty much like
Christmas at our house.
You sound so excited; what is it?
Watermelon.
(excited squealing)
What is it?
- Yay, spaghetti!
- [Mom} Spaghetti, Yes!
- Apples!
(gasps)
Cheese!
-  Thanks for the help, kids!
- Boo.
Boo.
Boo.
(snorts)
(laughter)
Boo.
(both laughing)
(blows a raspberry)
Love you.
Nothin'?
Do you see who that is?
Look who that is.
Who the booboo?
Who is the pretty one?
I realized that I hadn't cuddled
with her enough today.
(smooching)
♫ Bom diddy bom, bom diddy bom diddy bom
(gasps)
It's Mom!
- Hi.
- ♫ Bom diddy bom diddy bom diddy bom
The boys have been making
some noise in here.
I'm gonna see what they're up to.
- Your goal is higher than
here and hit the door.
-  Okay.
Does Caleb's face ever get kicked in?
- So far not yet.
-  Oh, he did it!
A block!
(urban music)
Oh!
That was a little low.
- Hike!
-  Oh, he got it!
'Kay guys, it's time for lunch.
Let's go eat.
We're doing leftovers for lunch.
- They're good.
- Mm-hmm.
-  Thanks for being troopers.
- Laura, can you show me your mad face?
-  Is that your mad face?
- Yeah.
- That's very mad.
- I know!
I know, it's really, really, really mad.
-  You never know when you're
gonna need your mad face.
Oh, there's Leesie's mad face!
You guys all look too cute for these
to be mad faces.
(fart noises)
Not a poop your pants face.
(laughs)
Mad face.
Nothing.
- I don't know if I can do it to a camera.
-  Your mad face?
- Oh yeah.
-  No, it goes like this.
-  Oh yes, she kind of like...
It's like she's sucking on something.
Oh, there's the mad face.
- No, that's not my mad face.
You get me mad and then I'll show
you my mad face.
-  (laughs)
There's Isaac's mad face.
-  It looks like a
little bit of a smirk.
It's hard to do it without
a little bit of a smirk.
-  Do not laugh.
(laughs)
(Dad laughs)
Okay, here we go.
It is hard when you're trying to do it.
Okay, on three: One, two, three.
-  You're allowed to scream.
(fart noises)
- I'm a rock.
(laughing) I'm not
entertained by gas sounds.
That would never make me smile.
- (blows a raspberry)
-  So I keep finding the kids
laying in the warm sunshine spots.
- It's funny how outside it's freezing
and in here when you're in the sun
it's so good.
-  It is.
Teaching Laura how to fold?
- Uh-huh.
And then you go across,
and then you put it away.
-  We're so proud of Jeremy.
- I was bored and tried.
I was like, "I wonder if I could do it."
We have had a lot of people
ask about J House shirts,
and we're working on that.
- If you think it would be
fun to get J House shirts,
give a thumbs-up to this video
and we'll keep working on it.
(Classical music)
-  Caleb wins!
-  Go get it!
Why is that so cute?
(child singing "A Whole New
World" from Disney's Aladdin)
- All right, we got the
laundry all loaded up.
And now I'm going to go deliver this
to my friend and I'm hoping
to take her a little treat.
(urban music)
-  Nice!
Woo!
- I decided to pick up a smoothie
because that just sounds
yummy and delicious.
It's like a treat, but you still feel
healthy after you eat it.
I'm gonna grab one of those now.
And I'm getting one for myself,
because as long as I'm
here might as well, right?
- Hey big girl, it's time to get up
from our nap, okay?
I'm time to get up, big girl.
If Laura's nap goes too long,
she's practically
impossible to get to sleep
around bedtime.
So we're trying to get her to get up.
It's not working.
- I made it to Bed Bath and Beyond
and I'm immediately remembering
why we don't have curtains, even after
we've lived in our house for four years.
It's because it's such a hard decision!
I would rather have
curtains than no curtains.
I think we're gonna do
a double curtain rod
and we're deciding between this one
and this one.
We wanna put white, sheer
curtains on the back rod
so that we can pull those shut
and it won't be such harsh light,
but we'll still have
some light in the room.
And then we also want to
have hanging curtains,
but I can't decide on those.
I'm walking around checking
out all these curtains
and I think I'm gonna FaceTime Jeremy
to get his opinion, but what I really wish
I could do is FaceTime all
of you at the same time
because I have no idea what I'm doing.
(peppy swing music)
Jeremy and I prefer blues and greens,
so I'm just looking at everything
that's blue or green.
I don't like the way that
these kinds of curtains
attach to the rod.
I prefer the way these attach.
I don't know what that's called,
but I like how they slide easier.
- Hi, Mom.
-  Hi, guys.
I'm just shoppin'.
-  We're just missin' ya.
I want Mom.
- No, she's just getting sad.
I didn't love any of those options
so I think I'm gonna hit another store
but I want to show you guys
something that I found here.
So apparently these are
called mermaid pillows.
I think they're really cool.
They're mesmerizing!
I think my kids might like these.
These might need to go
on their Christmas lists.
Look at that.
So as I'm out and about shopping
I'm definitely starting to think
about Christmas list items for my kids
and I'd love to hear what's
on your Christmas list.
(Christmas music)
So this store is covered
in Christmas stuff.
This is the most unique thing I've found.
It's like a mannequin
dress Christmas tree.
What?
And there's not just one of them,
there's more than one.
Is this a thing and I had no idea?
Check it out, here's the other one.
I was talking to my sister Tiffany
and she says we really need an area rug.
That would pull in the color
of the curtains together,
and I trust her because
she was a beautiful house.
I don't know if I can
make that many decisions.
I like this white one cuz it's super soft.
This one's too fancy
for me but it's pretty.
Well, I didn't have much
success out shopping.
But I have a better idea
of what I'm looking for
so I'm gonna keep shopping for
those things another night.
And for now I got to come
home and hang with her.
Did you have fun?
Can you say "Ahhhh?"
- Ahhhh.
- Say goodnight, J House out.
♫ It's time to say hello.
(all laughing)
And Laura sits down next to me and picks
up a giant booger.
(baby squeals)
Yeah!
That's my desire, just to raise kids
that know their mother loves them.
