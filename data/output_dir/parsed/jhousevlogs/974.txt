- We are starting to feel better.
Yay!
We are returning to the world of humanity.
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)
-  Here's the kids.
They are playing.
They're not just like
zombies in front of a TV
that are sick.
(slow violin music)
- So it's a sad story, but
we're returning the MacBook.
We had a problem with our van
that cost about as much as a MacBook did
that we just had to get fixed yesterday.
So Kendra and I decided
we would just return this,
keep working with what we had working
and maybe later, get this
when it makes a little
more sense, financially.
- For the past two days, I
haven't let these two touch
and that's a big change for them.
They usually play a lot together,
so I think she's happy
to see her sister again.
- Our city that we live in
helps out different families
during Christmas, with giving food
and our work adopted a
couple of these families
to buy gifts for.
Isaac is helping me out with delivering.
Alright, here you go.
So it's warm enough to just
be hanging out outside.
We're looking up at the trees.
You can hear tons of birds out here.
We have squirrels all
over out in our backyard.
- And bunnies.
- And bunnies?
- And sometimes we have
white-tailed deer and coyotes.
- That's true.
So, we're just enjoying being out here.
You know, I feel like
we've been cooped up,
with everybody else being sick inside.
It feels so nice to be outside
and smell the air out here.
I spend so much of my day
just going from the house
into the garage, into my
office at work, back home
and never have any time outside.
That's a really hard
thing about the winter.
- Yeah.
(giggles)
- Love you, bud.
You wanna go play some more?
- Yeah!
- We're gonna go play some wallball.
- Okay, someone is
definitely feeling better.
I can tell because her
sense of style is back.
Come show us your outfit, sweet girl.
Alright.
- And I'm gonna do
exercise and wash my hands
and eat fruits and vegetables.
-  Why are you gonna do all that?
- So I can feel much much better.
- Good catch.
That's another point.
If he gets three points, he
has to stand up here, like this
and I get to throw it right at him.
-  This looks like
a game you would've played
evily with your brothers growing up.
- Oh, I got a lot of welts
playing with my brothers
growing up.
-  Uh oh.
- So I got three points, so he gets
(ball thuds)
Hey, wait, wait!
I wasn't ready.
I gotta brace myself.
-  Is it time?
- Yeah, go ahead.
(grunts)
-  What do you find out there?
What do you see, huh?
She's watching da-da.
(ball thuds)
No wonder she likes this spot, huh?
We are making a Christmas treat.
I bought these ingredients a few days ago
and I've been dying to make it.
It is called Ooey Gooey Chex
Mix or Christmas Happiness
or Christmas Crack.
Those are all the names for it.
My sister, Tiffany, has been making it
forever with her family
and we're not gonna see them
this year for Christmas,
so I wanted to learn
how to make it myself.
In this bowl, we have six cups of,
the Rice Chex is at the bottom,
and then six cups of Golden Grahams.
Now we're adding two cups of coconut.
And two cups of slivered almonds.
In this container, we are
going to put one cup of sugar.
This is called corn syrup.
-  Oo, corn syrup.
- I love that kind of syrup.
- So it's boiling.
We're going to set the
timer for two minutes.
 Five,
four, three, two, one!
-  Alright, it's cooled down.
- Happy New Year.
-  Yay!
- Gooey, gooey.
-  So gooey.
- Gooey, gooey. Gooey, gooey. Gooey!
-  It's like, I
wanna eat it. I wanna eat it.
-  No!
- How long is it?
- Ah ha.
- Okay, so the ooey gooey Chex Mix
has to cool down for a second.
And while it's cooling, we
heard about something fun
from our friends, the
Canadian family vlog.
- I think it's called the Cupboard Vortex.
- Oh, yes. The mysterious Cupboard Vortex.
So apparently, we take our camera
and we put it in a cupboard
and you guys are like magically
-  Transported.
- Transported to somewhere else.
So we're gonna give it a try.
Safe travels.
Bye.
