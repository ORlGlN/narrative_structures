thank you very much buddy thank you
well the daffodils are starting to bloom
and it's just really feeling like spring
the forecast for the whole week is like
in the 60s and 70s which is amazing for
us this time of year like this is a very
early spring so I'm kind of holding my
breath assuming it's going to go back to
cold again but it hasn't yet which is
really nice and in other news I my voice
is weird today I actually have a pretty
bad cold it's one of those colds it's
like in your head in your throat in your
chest
oh sorry about that Laura like tripped
and fell over but she's totally fine not
even a scrape so that's a good thing and
the kids wanted to go on a walk they
climbed themselves into the double
stroller and buckled up and so I guess
we're going on a walk I'm in myself
you guys ready yes there we go
that's how it works
ha you're doing it you're doing it big
girl
well that was Laura's very first time to
try riding a tricycle and it's just
crazy seeing her grow up like she's my
baby and seeing her do these big things
it's just crazy to me but it's also
really fun like I think that's when my
favorite parts of motherhood is watching
the kids learn and experience new things
and like seeing their excitement and
their joy

to Geico while I'm waiting here in the
car line for Isaac and Elise if you
remember they go to school one day a
week at a homeschool enrichment program
so anyway while we're sitting here I
wanted to tell you a story about
something that happened this morning so
this morning I dropped the kids off at
school and we're driving home and I
randomly decided to take a different
route home and then I randomly decided
to look down at my gas which if you know
me very well you know that I am terrible
at remembering to check the gas gauge
and anyway so I randomly look down and
the lights on empty and I was like oh
dear and our car has a function where
you can press the button and see how
many miles you have left before you run
out of gas and so I press the button and
it says - and then it sticks down to one
and I'm like ah anyway I'm so grateful I
looked at it when I did and I'm so
grateful that I had randomly taken this
other route home because that route like
one route takes me kind of through the
country where there's not gas stations
for like long stretches and this route
was on the freeway and so I just he left
him back there loora loora - did and she
thinks that's funny funny hi video - it
certainly I am feeling really grateful
today for these little tender mercies in
my life I'm so grateful that we didn't
run out of gas and I'm so so grateful
for car line because it's raining and
I'm grateful that I don't have to get
these two unbuckled and walk them
through the rain instead we can just
drive up and I scream at least hop in
awesome hi guys I just got back
from school and I just wanted to tell
you how my day was at school
and we did this craft she gave us a
balloon and we and they had a mixed glue
up on in the string we couldn't be able
to like pat have it because it's still
drying and I like
and we played outside before it rain
it's raining outside so my favorite part
of the day was probably PE and in
science we have made cars and race then
talked about incline frames then Spanish
Hui and learned about weather and art we
made like many
and it was really fun and I'm gonna show
you one of the minis
okay then we're not gonna go to high hop
today we're gonna go another day no and
I feel he can help me get the dinner up
guide you guys well guys I am exhausted
it has just been a long day lots of good
stuff happened but I'm just really tired
I made like a chicken noodle soup for
dinner and now I'm drinking some orange
juice and all I really want to do is go
soak in a hot bath and then go to bed so
