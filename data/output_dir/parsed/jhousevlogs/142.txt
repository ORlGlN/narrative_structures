- Laura's instructions, exactly.
We have been challenged
by the Ballinger family
to do the Exact Instructions Challenge.
(dramatic music)
You guys are gonna give me instructions
on how to do something simple,
like make a peanut butter
and honey sandwich.
And I'm gonna follow your
instructions exactly.
- Like put a ton of honey on it.
- If that's what you instruct me to do.
(yelling)
But the goal is to try
to give me good enough
instructions that I can complete the task.
- And eat it.
- I would like that.
(laughing)
-  So I have a question.
Do you guys think this is
gonna be an easy challenge
or a hard challenge?
- Easy.
- Hard.
- Easy.
- Easy.
- He thinks easy.
Alright, are you guys ready
to give me instructions?
-  Yeah!
- You're gonna do the
instructions one at a time
to get it started.
I'm gonna follow your exact instructions
to make a peanut butter
and honey sandwich.
So here was your first instruction.
- Get a plate.
- Okay, I will get a plate.
Your second instruction.
- Put the plate on the table.
(laughing)
- Third instruction.
- Open the fridge.
Get the bag of bread.
- Next instruction, open bag of bread,
put pieces on the plate.
(laughing)
Next instruction.
- Open the pantry, and get
honey and peanut butter.
- Alright, okay next instruction,
put peanut butter on the bread.
(laughing)
This next instruction, you asked for me
to use a knife.
(laughing)
- Then put honey the same way
that you put on the peanut butter
and do all that with a knife.
(laughing)
Put one piece of bread
on top of the other.
(laughing)
And give it to me, so I can eat it.
- Have at it.
Does it taste like a peanut butter
and honey sandwich?
- No, okay.
Fail!
-  What do you think now,
is it an easy or hard challenge.
- Hard, and especially
because it's my dad.
-  So how are you
feeling about your instructions?
- Really good, I did it very specifically.
-  Very nice.
- I will now follow
Elise's exact instructions.
- You get out the bread.
You take two pieces of bread
and then you spread them
out on a paper plate.
And then, you get out the
honey and the peanut butter.
You get out a butter knife.
- Get out peanut butter and spread
on a slice of bread.
(lively music)
(laughing)
Put honey on same side
as the peanut butter
and put them together.
(laughing)
That's the end.
-  So Caleb, do
you think your instructions
are gonna work?
- You get out some bread.
- And then he told me to get the pieces.
(laughing)
- And then put some peanut
butter on both sides.
And then put on a little bit of honey
and then close it.
(laughing)
My turn.
- And then you're done.
- I'm so excited.
-  So do you
think you're instructions
are gonna work?
- I don't think so.
- Then why are you excited?
- Because I like it.
- I like it.
Laura's instructions were
pretty basic and simple.
- You have to put on the
butter and then honey
and then you eat it.
And then you wash your hands
and then play.
- Laura's instructions
were to put on butter
and honey and eat it,
then wash hands and play.
(playful music)
(laughing)
Now I'm washing hands and I'm playing.
(laughing)
(water running)
Laura's instructions exactly.
- Alright, now we're gonna see
who wants another chance
to try to beat Dad.
- So for round two, we're
letting the kids team up
and they're gonna write
down their instructions
and try to get it right this time.
Lisa and Caleb against Isaac and Laura.
(dramatic music)
- Get the plate and put
it on the table smoothly.
- I think we're gonna win,
because you're a better cooker
and I'm better at explaining stuff.
- And you get the pieces.
- You've got to say get the bread out.
- And then the dot, good.
Should we get a butter knife,
because we didn't say get a butter knife.
- I think we're gonna win.
- Let's have our first one be get a plate.
What do you think we should do.
- I think we should do wash
our hands and then eat,
and then you come home.
-  You getting all this Isaac?
- And then brush our teeth and
then watch what we all want,
and then go to bed.
- What did you say?
(Jeremy laughs)
- That.
- Alright, this is round two,
I'm gonna follow the
instructions of Elise and Caleb
and let's see if we can make
a peanut butter and honey sandwich.
Get a plate and put it
on the table smoothly.
I'm gonna see if this is
smooth enough for you guys.
(elegant jazzy music)
Was that smooth enough?
(laughing)
And get two piece of bread.
Put down the pieces of bread.
You want to bring 'em back.
Open the peanut butter,
get a butter knife,
scoop up the peanut butter
and put it on the bread.
- But we said get a
butter knife, excuse me.
- Alright this was my favorite
instruction of theirs.
Squiggle a tiny bit of honey on the bread.
I don't know how to squiggle,
but I'm gonna try this.
(uptempo dance music)
Squiggle a tiny bit.
Spread the peanut butter
and honey together
on a piece of bread very smoothly.
(elegant jazzy music)
(laughing)
Put the two pieces of bread together.
Alright.
- So bad.
- And that's the end.
Did we get a peanut
butter and honey sandwich.
- Hey it actually tastes pretty good.
- Get a plate and put
it on the table flat.
Get peanut butter and honey.
Put two pieces of bread
on the plate flatly,
but don't push on it,
just lay the bread on the plate
and put the plate face up.
Get the butter knife
and put it into the peanut butter
and move it so it gets
peanut butter on it,
but don't use your hands.
(uptempo rock music)
(laughing)
With the side of the knife that has
the peanut butter on it, put it down.
(laughing)
Move it
Hey (laughs).
Move it gently across the bread,
on the side of the
bread, but not the crust.
Move it gently.
- Yeah like
No but on top of it yeah.
- Open the honey and turn it upside down
over the bread.
Let's read a little further.
And just put a little bit of honey.
Squeeze the jar just once
for a little bit of time.
(laughing)
Get a piece of bread,
like a pan of pizza if
you were a waitress.
Like this?
And put the piece of bread gently
on the bread with the
peanut butter and honey.
Alright, is it a peanut
butter and honey sandwich?
Not quite.
Round two was also a fail.
This time I'm gonna let
all the kids work together
and see if they can give
me exact instructions
to make a peanut butter
and honey sandwich.
- Okay we're ready.
- Okay you guys ready?
Instruction number one.
Are you feeling nervous?
Get the place and put it
smoothly on the table face up.
I guess I could lay down on
the table with my face up,
but that's getting crazy.
I'm gonna do this smoothly face up.
(laughing)
Number two, get two pieces of bread
and put them flat and
gently on top of the plate
but not on top of each other.
- We're figuring out your secrets.
- Yeah!
(cheering)
- Yes Yes!
- Alright, open the peanut butter.
Grab the handle of the butter knife
and put the butter knife in
with the sharp side down,
then scoop some peanut butter,
and spread it all over
one side of the bread,
not on the crust or the
back side of the bread.
- Ahhhhh.
- Pretty good instructions, honestly.
Oh I got a little bit on the crust.
Open the cap of honey and put some honey
on top of the peanut butter.
- No!
(laughing)
- You did it.
- You're the one who did it,
I just followed the instructions.
You guys were so close last round.
Do you think you got it this time?
(melodious music)
Now you've made some changes.
Open the cap of the honey,
and put some honey on top of the bread
that has the peanut butter on it,
and only spread it on the peanut butter
on the bread.
(dramatic music)
- Yes!
- Let's see if this final
instruction is there.
I don't know if you're gonna get this one.
Get the two pieces of bread on the plate
and put them together with
the peanut butter and honey
exactly in the middle
of the pieces of bread.
- Yeah!
- A peanut butter and honey sandwich!
- Thanks, now I'm hungry.
- How do you guys feel that
you were able to conquer me
in the Exact Instructions Challenge?
- Good.
- Hive fives.
Boom.
- Boom
- Boom.
Boom.
And one more time, we'd like to thank
the Ballinger family for
challenging us to do it.
It was a lot of fun.
-  J House out.
-  You guys want to see what came?
It's all of your Halloween costumes.
-  Yeah!
