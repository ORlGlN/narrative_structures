- Daddy said we have to run,
and Garrett was trying to get us.
(upbeat music)
- (Mom) Whoa, what are you?
- This is Caleb.
- And I found two shirts that I like.
(upbeat music)
So Miss Laura has set
up a store this morning.
What kind of a store do you have?
- It has this money and
this is a check mark,
and you put it in this.
(beeping)
- So your store just has money?
- Yeah.
- Can I buy anything at your store?
- Yeah.
- Did you do your makeup this morning?
- Yep.
- It looks nice.
All right, well,
my little baby would
like this little lamb-y.
(baby coos)
Aww.
- That's fine with me.
- So how much money is it?
- Uh, this much.
- OK, lets see what that is.
Oh, that's a penny!
Awesome.
OK, here you go, here's your penny.
- I'm going to Lydia's house.
- Today?
It's gonna be fun.
Good morning.
I have been thinking a lot
this morning about vlogging.
When Jeremy and I were in San
Diego it was so easy to film.
We were doing so many new and interesting
and exciting things, and
what we both realized
is since we've been home
we're both kind of feeling
out of the groove with filming.
We're not doing anything
new or interesting
or exciting here, and so we kind of feel
like we don't have anything worth sharing,
and we were just discussing that feeling
because we never wanted, like
we didn't create our vlog
to share like the biggest, most
exciting things we ever do,
like we started it to
share our daily life,
and our daily memories
and like the good stuff
that happened every day.
I guess like I feel like our life
is not interesting enough
when we're just home,
which is just ridiculous because
we filmed for three years,
just our daily life at
home, but when we go
on this big adventure,
all of a sudden I'm like,
"Oh, our regular life is lame."
Our regular life isn't boring.
It's just kind of routine.
You know, we've got basketball.
We've got gymnastics.
So the moral of the story is,
Jeremy and I were talking last night,
and we just decided to focus
again on why we have this vlog.
What is the purpose behind it?
And really there's a couple reasons.
One of them is we want
to preserve and remember
our family memories, and the other one is,
we want to see and look
for the good in each day,
and remind all of us of the beauty
that's in daily family life.
It is cold and rainy today,
so I'm grateful that we have gymnastics
to get us out of the house,
and get the kids to get some energy out.
(energizing music)
Can you say yay?
Yay.
She's cheering.
She really just wants to get out there
and just play with them.
(energizing music)
OK guys,
I'm a little embarrassed
because I've been struggling
since we got home from our trip.
I have not gotten back into
a good grocery shopping,
meal planning groove, and I
just need to and I haven't,
so today we are out of food once again,
but we are headed out to
eat at McAlister's Deli.
They have a 99 cent kids meal option
that's actually pretty good,
so that's why we're here,
and?
- I forgot her clothes.
- (laughing) Jeremy forgot her clothes.
- So we're just gonna keep
her in pajamas all day.
- It's warmer.
It's warmer.
We're also back in the car
because we already went in once,
and we all struggled
to behave appropriately
for a restaurant, so we came out,
had a little chat about how we behave,
and we're gonna go in and do it again.
(laughing)
- They were looking at the funny mirror.
(yelling)
- Who wants to go try
again at the restaurant?
-  Me!
- Let's bring the tone down a little bit.
A little quieter and respectful-er.
- Who wants to go back in?
-  Me!
- Oh, I would like to mother.
So just after we walked
into the restaurant,
Aunt Ashley and Elizabeth
came in at the same time.
Elizabeth, hey!
(soft upbeat music)
I don't think Nae-nae
has had a pickle before.
You want to try it?
She loves it.
- She does!
She likes it!
All right, so help me out
with getting back on
track with meal planning,
and in the comments let me know
what's one of your favorite dinners,
and bonus points if it's easy
or if I can use my crockpot with it,
because that's more likely
to get actually cooked.
- We thought we would head to Petco.
Janae likes nothing more than seeing pets.
(yells)
And as a side note, it was
61 degrees this morning
at seven something when
I took the trash out,
and it's a lot colder.
(upbeat music)
Do you see it back here on the corner?
Uh oh, they're sneaking around.
(upbeat music)
- (young boy) I want a mouse.
It's only four dollars.
I'll be willing to pay for a mouse.
- And everything that goes with it?
-  You'd have to take care of it,
but how much is the cage?
- And if you get it out of the cage
and it runs away in my house.
What do you see?
Yeah, you see the little animals, huh?
Those are mice.
Do you like the mice?
So this one is the chameleon,
and this one is the iguana.
(happy music)
- I love goldfish.
I like the green ones
because they stand out.
-  You like the green ones?
- They don't have food.
- They don't have food?
- No.
- No, they feed them.
(soft, upbeat music)
-  That is a pet I don't ever want.
- It's a snake.
- It's a snake.
- Oh, here's the bearded dragon.
- Mom, are you picking up Isaac and?
- He can't see!
- I can pick him up.
See him?
Look, they have little crickets in there.
They're gonna eat them.
-  Is that what bearded dragons eat?
- I wouldn't think they'd just happen
to put those in there with them.
Hello.
How are you doing today?
I'm doing all right.
(upbeat music)
So apparently a new cat was
just brought into Petco.
(jazz music)
- I made an Olympic torch.
So it's 20 inches tall,
and it's not breakable.
It's made out of like plastic, kind of.
To keep it going it's kind of electric.
- So we're getting to play
with some of our really
good friends today,
and I was going to video the
kids running up to the door,
and I didn't get out
the camera fast enough.
They are already inside
playing with their friends.
They haven't seen them since
we came home from San Diego,
and they're really excited.
And Janae's gonna be happy here too.
There's the doggy.
There's Hannah.
Hi, Hannah.
Hi, Hannah.
Hi.
So Hannah is the nicest dog in the world.
Aww, so nice.
Dog, woof woof.
Hi, dog.
Whoa.
Be careful with that thing.
What are you?
- A gecko.
- See, we're not allowed
to play until (mumbling).
-  Hi, bunny.
That's a bunny.
Hi.
Oh, is this your makeup?
That's quite the costume.
What are you guys playing?
- House, where there
was a really bad storm.
- Oh dear.
- With bad guys and stuff.
- A storm with bad guys?
- So we had to run!
And Garrett was trying to get us.
- Oh, did you guys get away?
- Yeah.
- Lacey, where you guys headed?
- To the woods.
And we brought water bottles,
and an extra water bottles.
- And walkie talkies?
- Uh huh.
- Hello, Michael.
This is Caleb.
- So the kids are going
in the backyard to play,
but they're packing up
like they're going to be gone for a week.
I think the packing up is part of the fun.
(soft music)
There they are, headed off.
(piano playing softly)
- So we did our freezer meal tonight.
It's been awhile since we did that.
We put sesame chicken in
the crockpot, had some rice,
and when I mix it up when
I'm doing it for the kids,
I just stick it in big bowls
and mix it all up at once
so I don't have to do it
individually for each of the kids.
- I'm trying to clean up after dinner
and load the dishwasher, and
I have a little helper here,
who's being a little too helpful.
She keeps pulling all of the utensils out.
Luckily she's not eating them.
Those are supposed to go
in here, little Missy.
See?
There we go.
Yeah, what is this?
Oh, no.
Looks like I'm gonna need to
find something to occupy Janae
before I finish the dishes.
She's so cute though.
- OK.
All right.
So that was Kendra.
I'm gonna be meeting them for lunch.
This morning I've really
been thinking a lot
about my life.
My decisions that I've made
in the last couple years,
and I'm wanting to make some changes.
Specifically I've been thinking
about my own willingness
to submit to God's will.
Like, when I think of Jesus
Christ in the scriptures,
that may have been one
of the most important
and significant things we can learn,
if we're wanting to be like him,
is to submit to the will of the Father.
I think that's maybe one of
the most important lessons
to learn from the scriptures
is that we need to do God's Will,
above our own needs or
desires or selfish ambitions.
And I was just thinking, like,
about all the time that I put
into my businesses, you know,
I mean 10 to 20 hours a day sometimes.
Sometimes I'm not even willing
to give a sincere prayer to God,
and that's heartbreaking,
and embarrassing,
and needs to change.
And what if I was willing
to give an hour a day
to really thinking, and
praying, and meditating,
and pondering, like,
God, what do you want me to do today?
And then being willing,
and have the courage to do those things.
I really want to make that change.
And I think even more is I
don't want to make that change
for a day or a week, but really
make that change in my heart
so that it can last forever.
So there's been times of my life
when I was more focused on that,
and felt that power and the
blessings that come from that,
but life gets busy, and I get distracted,
and I fall back into
more selfish patterns.
The question I often
ask myself is, you know,
when's that last time I really thought
I got inspiration from God,
and I think another good question is,
when's the last time I really
sought for that and wanted it?
And I know from times in past that
when I actually am
looking for that from God,
and I'm following
direction and inspiration,
I'm so much happier,
and I'm doing so much
more good in the world.
I need help in being a better
father, a better husband,
better in my business,
better in my church setting
and in my community.
Side note, I was supposed
to pick up clothes for Janae
and bring them here
and I forgot because I
was thinking about this,
but why would I think
that I can do those
things better by myself?
Because I've seen my life
over and over and over again
that if I have God's help,
and I'm willing to reach out
and follow inspiration,
it all goes better.
So I want to make another
attempt, another try,
a do over, which is what's
great about the gospel.
It's all about this opportunity
to keep trying again,
and to get help from God.
You know, that by grace we
can be clean, and be better,
and have another chance to do the things
we've been asked to do, and
be what we're meant to be.
So I'd love to hear in the comments
what you're working on right now,
what's something you're
wanting to improve on
and change in your life?
Let me know in the comments.
So Kendra went to the store today for,
I think it was 20 minutes, 15 maybe.
- It was pretty short, and I
found two shirts that I like.
- They are cute.
- There's this one.
- I like it.
- And then there's this one,
which I rarely wear yellow,
so that was really exciting to me.
-  And the sleeves are fun.
- And there was a sale going on, so,
I, if you don't know,
absolutely hate shopping.
One of the big problems
is that I only shop
when I absolutely have to buy something,
and so one of my goals was to
just try casually shopping,
and it worked!
- And you didn't have to?
- Yeah!
-  Good night.
J house out.
Backwards day and forwards day!
(intense music)
(cheering)
- Hidden drawer up there.
-  You wouldn't
even know it was there.
