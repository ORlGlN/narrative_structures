- Isaac, I have a very
good piece of advice.
Don't listen to your dad.
(lively rock music)
-  Woo!
That is the cutest thing ever.
Caleb and I are working
on his blanket today.
He's helping me iron
under very close supervision.
Did you get me more water for the iron?
Thanks bud, I'll hold it steady.
Okay that's good.
Good job buddy.
- I did mostly every spot.
-  We're working
together, aren't we?
- Woo!
- By the way I am terrified of irons
and getting burnt or other
people getting burnt,
so I would never let
him do this on his own.
I'm right here with him.
We're doing it together.
We're being safe.
(uptempo bright music)
-  Caleb's helping me
straighten out all the edges
and pin it.
Be careful.
- That's good.
-  Good work.
-  One right here.
-  We are almost done.
So here's some of Caleb's sewing.
Line it up straight.
(sewing machine whirring)
- I just tried like
-  Are you turning it inside out?
It's fun, because you get to start seeing
what it's gonna look like.
I love the football fabric dude.
You made that.
- Now I need to iron it one more time
and sew it again.
-  Then we'll be done.
What are you working on?
- Lunch, pasta salad.
-  What's this?
- The seasoning basically.
-  The sauce?
- Or like, you know, when
you're making mac and cheese.
-  The sauce?
- Yeah the sauce.
- Yeah it smells really good.
-  Cooking the noodles.
Alright so we're having pasta salad
and apples for lunch.
How do you guys like it?
- Good.
- Good.
- I made it.
-  I know we saw you made it.
- And chicken.
-  It's got chicken in it, huh?
Rotisserie chicken?
- And we can choose
how much we want in it.
- Hey Laura, how's the pasta salad?
- Great.
- These are so good with it.
-  Yeah they are.
- Having lunch with Jared.
- Hey how's it going?
This is like crazy.
We just met Gary.
- Yeah.
It was fun to meet him.
- It was a lot of fun.
I'm so glad you're here,
I have so much to tell you this time.
- This is the best part
of every conference
is hanging out with friends
that we don't get to see all the time.
- Yeah really.
- One, I've completely
given up on getting ready
for today, and Caleb has decided
that he prefers the hand wheel.
Is it just easier?
We are almost done with his blanket.
Alright, here's the baby blankets
that we've already finished.
- This one is Elise's
and this one is yours,
and this one's Caleb's
and this one is mine.
-  Yeah, we
just need to do Isaac's.
Can you pile 'em up?
- Yep, first mine.
-  This girl has the
cutest little yoga stances.
That one was good.
She hears the kids.
Somebody's trying to escape.
(suspenseful music)
She's trying to figure
out how to navigate this.
Are you coming outside?
You did it.
And you found a ladybug.
You should probably
leave the ladybug alone.
She's only seven months old.
We are so in trouble, like
the way she moves around
and she just has so much
control over her body,
she's gonna be such a busy little girl.
Is this what you wanted
to come outside for?
Look at 'em, they're all here.
(playful music)
- My name is Ariel.
-  Your name is Ariel?
- You want to see my handspring?
-  Sure.
Woo!
- Stay focused.
-  Stay focused.
Woo, you got it girl.
Whoa, the belly flop.
I'm glad you focused.
Woo!
Your name is Ariel, so you're swimming?
That makes sense.
- It's kind of hard, because
of the stuff on the ground.
- Yeah, let's show 'em
the stuff on the ground.
So we actually had our lawn aerated today.
-  What does that mean?
- I think it helps the yard,
because it gets the air down into it more.
Like that's why it's called aeration,
I have no idea if that's right or not.
If you know what aeration is
and why we do it, leave that information
in the comments below.
(lively music)
(laughing)
Whoa, good catch Cubby.
Two hand touch, you guys are tough.
- One time we were practicing and it went
-  Oh did it hurt?
- Yeah, it kinda did.
I cried for two milliseconds,
then I stopped
and kept on playing.
- Nice.
-  Elise, what did you make?
- A leaf skirt.
-  I love it.
That is the cutest thing ever.
(growling)
Janae liked it doing it agan.
My ear fell off.
-  Your ear?
Your ear fell out?
- Someone took it.
-  No, it fell somewhere.
It disappeared.
- It's on your shoulder.
-  Good find, Laura Lu.
(tender music)
Thank you Laura.
- You're welcome.
- So I'm over there stirring
dinner and Janae's squawking,
I'm coming, I'm coming
Janae, and all of a sudden
she's quiet, and I turn around,
and Laura had come in from outside,
and was feeding her, I just
thought that was so sweet
that she noticed her need
and was taking care of her little sister.
We love you.
- So I'm getting to do
a one on one sit down
with Gary V to talk about the industry.
How cool is that?
(groovy beat music)
- Alright, he's a nine year old,
entrepreneur at heart,
he's always talking about
how someday he wants
to buy a sports franchise
or build these things
and he's drawing things.
- I love you Isaac.
- What advice for Isaac would you give
as a budding entrepreneur.
Oh and real quick, Isaac,
this is like one of the
world's greatest entrepreneurs
so listen up.
(bell dings)
- Isaac, I have a very
good piece of advice.
Don't listen to your dad.
(laughing)
- Alright let's hold off
- Isaac on a serious kick,
here's what I actually mean.
Entrepreneurship is very hard, my man.
And I hope you watch this today
and I hope you watch this in 10 years,
and I hope you it in 20
and 30 and 40 and 50,
but I'm making a joke,
'cause you should listen to your dad
and your dad's a good guy,
but I'm kind of not,
because entrepreneurship is lonely.
Following your intuition
is unbelievably important.
And as long as you're
not hurting anybody else,
it's an awfully good
way to live your life,
a.k.a., build the biggest building in town
by building the biggest building,
not by tearing everybody
else's buildings down.
You follow that road-map,
you'll win, brother.
- And to all those other
entrepreneurs out there,
check out Gary V in the description box
below we'll have for you.
Thank you, I appreciate it.
- Thanks.
- Thanks for coming to
VidSummit, what did you think?
- They've found a basketball.
I wanted to tell you real quickly
about something that I've been doing
different today and it's
made a really big difference.
Before Jeremy left on his trip,
he told me about this marriage
book that he was reading.
And it talked about not
criticizing each other,
which is obviously good advice,
but it says something specific to do
when you feel inclined to criticize.
It said instead of criticizing,
replace it with the words, I wish.
And so instead of saying
the negative like,
oh my goodness, why do you always leave
your socks on the floor,
you replace it with the positive.
Like I wish that we could work harder
to keep our room clean together
or something like that,
but that's not a great example,
because Jeremy doesn't even
leave his socks on the floor.
But I've been trying to do
this with the kids today
and it's made a really big difference.
It's amazing how just a positive tone,
like say things like, I wish
we could speak more kindly
to each other, or I wish
we could stay in our seats
at the breakfast table.
They respond so kindly to it.
You know it's the little things,
and it's sometimes hard
to remember to do that.
So I've been really working on that today
and I've been really
happy with the results.
I feel like it's affected
the feeling in our home.
So I also told the kids this morning
all day long we were gonna play a game,
where I was gonna try to catch them
doing good things, and
it's been really fun,
like I'm like, oh I
caught you doing something
nice to your brother, oh,
I caught you encouraging each other,
oh I caught you doing
that with a good attitude.
(bright music)
(lively rock music)
- So it's so sad, we're here with a bunch
of creators at the racetrack
and I feel terrible,
like I didn't sleep enough last night,
I haven't eaten enough,
I haven't drank enough.
And so I'm just heading
back the the airport to
to the airport, I'm
heading back to the hotel
to head to bed.
J House out.
-  Laura wants to try the blanket.
(laughing)
- I'll be back in a few days.
- Nobody makes Play Doh, but God does.
-  Oh he does?
- They are our best friends.
-  You guys are gonna
be on the five o'clock news?
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.
