- Bye Dad.
(rock music)
- We have to have a lot of time with Jenae
because Jenae's leaving too.
-  Yep, we're leaving today.
Mom and I are heading to DC.
- Yeah!
-  Caleb's all let's celebrate.
Who's coming today?
- Granny Jo, Granny Jo, Granny Jo.
- She's coming tomorrow?
-  She flies
in at midnight tonight
so you'll see her tomorrow.
(rock music)
- My first baby is named Jenae nae
and my other baby is named Ally.
-  Those are
some great baby names.
- And my Honey died.
-  Your honey died?
- I'm four years old
- You're four years old?
- And I'm gonna be three
on my four birthday.
-  You're gonna be
three on your four birthday?
- Yeah.
My other baby is almost
coming out of my tummy.
I have to go to the hospital.
-  Well good
luck getting your baby
outta your tummy, you're such a great mom.
- Even I can do this.
-  In high heels no less.
- I don't take care of myself.
I need parents.
-  Yeah, you do need parents.
I help take care of you.
- And you have a parent too.
-  I do, Grandma.
Are you gonna miss Jenae?
- Yeah, but I'm still
excited because I get to
spend the whole day with friends.
-  You get to spend
the whole day with friends
and then who's gonna come watch you?
- Granny Jo.
-  Life is good.
(piano music)
Nice.
Piano Guys Isaac.
(piano music)
You're doing it.
How are you liking piano so far?
- I like it.
-  Is it hard or easy?
- Pretty easy once you know how actually.
(piano music)
-  That's a cool song.
You are doing awesome.
- Then I have one more.
-  Nice.
(piano music)
- Jenae come here.
-  You go get him.
Are you gonna go get him?
Isaac did you know that
you wore that sleeper
when you were a baby?
- No.
-  Yep.
She wants to.
Oh, I saw that leg move forward.
She wants to go forwards, but
she keeps going backwards.
- I'm gonna miss Jenae.
-  She wants it, she wants it.
- I'm kind of excited and kind of sad.
-  Yeah that we're leaving.
- Yeah because I won't see Jenae nae
and I won't get that many snuggles.
-  With Mom and Dad.
- Uh huh.
-  But what's the good part?
- I'll get to see Granny Jo.
- So the kids are staying
at a friend's house
during the day before Granny Jo gets here.
So they're getting picked up right now.
- Bye Dad.
- I'll miss you guys.
- Bye Dad.
- Bye you guys.
Come here.
I'm gonna miss you.
- Okay, you guys be kind.
Goodbye Miss Laura.
One more big squeeze.
I love you.
-  Have fun at
your friend's house.
- You have so much fun okay?
Well the big kids are off.
They're gonna have a
great time with friends
and with Granny Jo, but
now we only have one hour
until we need to leave for the airport
and we're not packed at all.
Luckily it's a lot easier to
pack for just the three of us
than for the whole family.
But I've still gotta get moving.
(techno music)
- This is so much easier than
having all five of the kids.
- It's a relief when you're running late
to see that the line is
short if we're gonna make it.
(techno music)
-  There she is.
- So we're headed to
Washington DC to Playlist Live.
I have not been to DC since I was a kid.
I mean it's been a long time.
So I'm excited.
(banjo music)
This is what Jeremy does on planes.
This is what I do on planes, hi.
(upbeat music)
What's going on?
-  She's being very still.
(upbeat music)
I've never had to do that before.
(upbeat music)
-  Doors are about to close.
Please hold on, this train is departing.
- We're all loaded up.
- Alright, now we're heading to the hotel.
(rock music)
- Well we made it.
We arrived at Playlist in Washington DC
and we're going out exploring.
We'll have to show you
guys our room later.
Right now we're gonna try
to find the White House.
(Star Spangled Banner)
I don't know why I have to take a picture.
There's a million pictures,
I could just look at the picture,
but it's cool to be able to
take the picture yourself.
(Star Spangled Banner)
So I think what I'm loving
about being in DC right now
is I'm like, hey look,
there's the capital building,
hey look there's the Washington Monument.
The stuff that you read
about and you see online
is right here in your face.
♫ The rockets red glare
♫ The bombs bursting in air
♫ Gave proof through the night
♫ That our flag was still there
- That's that Supreme Court.
It's the building I'm
most excited to see here.
- So a Kansas City friend of mine used
to live in Washington DC
and she said that while we were here
we had to come to Good Stuff Eatery,
so we're trying their
burgers, fries and shakes.
(upbeat music)
So they have a mango fry sauce.
-  It's good.
- It's actually really good.
-  And it's sweet.
(upbeat music)
- So Jenae's been fussing in the car
and I put on a video of
Laura and she stopped crying
and started smiling and laughing.
She totally recognized
her and was all excited.
It was so cute.
You miss your big sister don't ya?
-  Goodnight, J House out.
- There is someone in
our community that is
working very closely with Houston
and is going to be taking
some supplies down there.
They were asking for donations of diapers.
- Excellent job.
- It was fantastic.
-  You ready for this?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
