(lively music)
-  That is so ready to come out.
(gasps)
- What if Mama Llama's gone?
- Mommy!
(laughing)
- Today is my last day with my family here
in Arizona, I'm getting all packed up.
See that suitcase?
It's about ready to get closed,
and we are going to be heading out.
The first stop of the day
is at the cardiologist,
which is the doctor that
did my dad's heart surgery.
(bright guitar music)
(groans)
(laughing)
-  Mom is coming home today,
so we gotta fold all the laundry
and get the house clean.

(bluesy upbeat music)
-  Here at my mom's house,
she has the coolest picture corner
and it's just full of all
these family pictures.
Some of the pictures are older.
See that girl on the left,
that's my Grandma Kris.
There's my dad, when he
was a baseball player
in his youth.
That's my other grandparents
on their wedding day.
There's Marla, graduating
from high school.
There's my parents.
And this is the one I
wanted to show you guys.
This is my older sister Tiffany,
and I, and I am like two and a half
or three years old in that picture,
so I'm about Laura's age.
This little girl is my mom
when she was a baby.
I kind of see some Janae in there.
(twangy bright music)
Here's what a normal
artery should look like.
Here's what an artery with
heart disease looks like.
My dad had a 100% blockage.
That's what happened, blocked artery
leads to myocardial infarction.
Wow that blockage is so little.
Well we made it to the
doctor's appointment
and they just took an EKG on my dad.
And we're gonna hopefully
get some answers.
Janae's here supporting us.
She's been clapping for Papa.
(Janae gurgling)
Good job Papa, good job.
We're hoping to learn more about some
of the medications
- Yeah, the restrictions
- that he's on.
- Sort of, what happens from here forward.
- Yes.
Papa wants to know when he can get back
to doing stuff.
- Yeah.
- Are you feeling well enough
to go out and like ride a bike.
- Yes.
-  No.
- Well that's how I feel.
- Right.
- I feel good enough to do that.
I don't know if
- You're supposed to.
- If I did it,
- it would cause a problem or not.
- So that's the questions
that we have for the doctor,
and Mom's feeling worried about him.
- Yeah, if we can get
these questions answered.
-  Yes.
-  There's a loose loose tooth.
- Uh-huh.
And it's been bleeding today.
-  It is so ready to come out.
- I'm scared about it.
I want it to fall out,
but I'm just so scared.
-  It can be scary
to have a tooth come out.
I totally understand.
- And to have it pulled out.
-  But how can I help you?
- I don't know.
-  If you want,
I could put a paper towel in your mouth
and wiggle it a little bit,
and see if it comes out.
Do you want to try or do you want to try
to do that yourself?
- I want to try to do it myself.
If it doesn't work, then I'll do it.
I want you to do it.
-  Okay.
Wiggle it a around, wiggle
it a little bit more.
Pull on it a little bit.
You're being so brave.
- I wish I could have a loose tooth.
-  You wish you could have one?
How come?
- Because I'm a little girl.
-  You want to be a big girl?
- Yeah.
-  It's bleeding.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Alright, Elise wanted me to
try to pull her tooth out.
You ready?
(suspenseful music)
(laughing)
It came out!
(yells)
-  Is it out?
- Yep it came out.
It didn't need much.
You were so brave.
Do you want to see the tooth?
There it is.
- Can I see it?
- Yep, come see it.
- Can I see it?
- There's that tooth?
- Hello.
-  All you want for Christmas
is your two front teeth.
- Mmm-mmm.
-  Mom's gonna be so wierded out
when she sees you tonight.
- Smile.
- Let's see it.
- What?
- I like my new smile.
-  It's totally different.
Dad how do I eat?
-  It can be hard
to eat without that tooth,
yeah just figure it out.
- Ah.
- Well the appointment went really well.
I'll fill you in more on that later.
Right now we're gonna
go eat lunch at Zupas.
I wish I could take this
whole restaurant home with me,
because I just want one
of everything, to go.
(elegant jazzy music)
Dance it sister.
(laughing)
We're at the airport
and I'm saying goodbye to my mom and dad.
And I'm so glad I got to come out here
and just hug them again and be with them.
It's hard to live far away sometimes.
And Dad, I'm so glad you're doing well.
- I am doing a lot better.
- I'm so glad.
It's a bummer, they had tickets
to come out and visit our family
in Kansas City this weekend.
They were gonna come to our one million
subscribers Service Celebration,
and the doctor doesn't feel like
they're ready to travel quite yet,
so they're not gonna be able to come
and meet all of you
and hang out with us for that,
so they're bummed about that,
but we'll see them again soon.
Wherever your family is that you love,
call 'em, hug 'em, squeeze 'em,
just take a moment to do that,
you definitely won't regret it.
The Phoenix airport is really big
and I've got some extra time,
I'm here early.
And Janae's sleeping,
so I'm gonna do some window shopping.
(twangy bright music)
So this is a morse code necklace
that says sister.
That's awesome, I want to get one for me
and all my sisters.
Um, these are adorable.
Okay that's enough to make me want
to have another baby boy.
Seriously?
Okay these scorpion suckers?
That's crazy.
Would you eat one,
because I definitely would not.
That's kind of cute.
(bright upbeat music)
So I found a bookstore
and I'm just loving walking around
looking at all these titles,
and this one title caught my eye.
And I'm looking at it,
and I'm like this is the
book that I want to read.
Here's the problem,
it's in Spanish.
So back in college, I took a couple months
of Spanish, enough to
understand what the title
and the cover of this book says.
I even was able to mostly
understand the back cover,
but there's no way I could actually
read the cover in Spanish.
I just thought it was so funny
that I accidentally was browsing
in the Spanish book section
when I don't speak Spanish,
so I'm gonna have to find
that book in English.
This is the store Isaac would like.
(groovy upbeat music)
- So Elise is coming for her
last tutoring class today.
- Uh-huh.
-  It's so different
without that tooth there.
- I know.
- It's crazy.
- I like it.
- I love it.
So we may be way overdue
on a lot of books,
so we're getting them
checked in to the library.
(bright uptempo music)
Look and see, where's the Phoenix one?
-  Phoenix.
- Trick or treating.
-  So Elise, what
are you excited about?
- To tell Mom about my tooth.
Well it's gone.
- Mom's here.
-  That's Mom's plane.
- I love Mama.
-  I love Mom too.
(sweet music)
- Mommy!
(laughing)
- Hi girls.
Hi.
Oh my goodness, what
happened to your tooth?
Do you want to hold her?
Awww.
(kisses)
(laughing)
-  Did you guys miss Janae?
-  Yes.
-  Yeah we did.
-  Aww, you missed me?
Thanks Cubby.
Well Janae is pretty popular.
Well she remembers you.
- I know I was nervous.
-  Yeah.
- And we did Face Time a lot.
- We did.
- To make sure.
- She's excited.
Well we've got the whole
crew together again.
They have a lot of energy.
- Ya think?
- There's a lot of energy at our house.
- A little bit more than Papa and Mugga?
- Yeah, just a little bit.
Janae's gonna be really happy to be home
with all of them.
- Yeah.
- Jeremy's being really sweet
and letting my have his jacket,
because it is cold here in Kansas City.
- I knew that you would need one.
Because when you left, it was warm.
- Yeah, I didn't even pack one.
Thanks Caleb.
- Or two, I don't know.
-  Do you
remember where we parked?
- You know
- Uh-oh, do we need to go back to two?
-  No.
- Or is it on three?
- It's definitely.
- You parked at level one.
- Okay, now press two.
- Go to two.
- Three?
- Two.
- Two.
-  Please, I don't want
to be in the cold so long.
-  There we go.
-  So I think
it's actually that way.
- We're hunting for our van.
If we can't find our van guys,
we're just gonna have
to get on an airplane
and go back to see Grandma and Papa.
We tried level three,
definitely not level three.
We tried level two,
(playful suspenseful music)
and Jeremy's like clicking our van button,
no luck yet.
- I think it's over there.
- I see it, I see it.
-  Did we find it?
- Yeah, so I saw it,
but it wasn't responding
to the clicker because I was out of range.
-  Hey Miss Laura, I missed you.
- I missed you too.
I'm not gonna let you
leave ever ever again.
-  You're not gonna
let me leave ever again?
Come here big girl.
- That's a clap.
- Yay!
(laughing)
- Janae's so happy to
be back with her people.
So Laura told me she wanted me
to read her a book.
I missed reading to you.
What is Mama Llama doing?
Baby Llama starts boo hooing.
Eyes wide open, covers drawn,
oh what if Mama Llama's gone?
Llama Llama red pajama
Gets two kisses from his Mama.
Snuggles pillows soft and deep,
Baby Llama goes to sleep.
Are you ready for bed?
If only it was that easy.
It's gonna take awhile to actually
get the kids to bed.
J House out, goodnight.
So in Arizona, apparently they rake rocks.
And where I come from, we rake leaves.
(bright music)
Well Papa is home from the hospital,
he's all showered up and
looking like himself again.
You playing with Papa?
Yeah
(laughing)
-  Arms cuddle for bed.
