- We don't if that
means we're moving soon?
If we found the right place, we could.
(upbeat music)
What do you think is inside the box?
♪ Oo-Oo-Oo ♪
- What'd ya find?
I forgot the Jell-O salad.
- So the girls and I are out
doing something interesting today.
We are looking at houses with a realtor.
I don't exactly know what that means
so I don't know exactly
what to tell you guys.
We're feeling like it's time for us
to start looking at some other homes
and kind of getting a better picture
of what we want in our future.
We don't know if that
means we're moving soon;
if we found the right place we could.
We just honestly don't know.
We just feel like it's time for us
to be thinking about
what are next step is.
And so, yeah, we're gonna
look at some houses today.
(soft music)
So we're looking at a
variety of homes today.
We're looking at some new
construction, we're looking
at some older homes on more acreage.
And I'm just trying to figure
out what exactly we want.
(soft flute music)
-  What are you doin' buddy?
- I'm tryin' to find
what kinda bird this is.
- It's been so fun to have
that bird-feeder there.
Do you think you found
what kinda bird it was?
- A Smith's Longspur.
-  Yeah, it does look like it.
Hey, look up and see if
(toddler screams)
that kind of bird is in this area.
- That one eating is a
male common Yellowthroat.
-  What's this
that you have goin' on?
- It's a fort that I read in and can look.
I found there nest because they build it
with dry weeds, grass and leaves.
That's it right there.
-  So there's a
woodpecker trained to peck in.
It's tryin' to break in.
The seeds are right there buddy.
- Oh, we see him.
-  He's actually pecking in.
- I love this.
It's like my favorite.
- Oh look the little chickadees
are just right there eating.
(upbeat music)
- So Janae has been
sick, she's had a fever.
And last night the
scariest thing happened.
At 3:00 a.m. she woke up
screaming like she was in really bad pain.
She was arching her back
and she wouldn't be soothed.
For 20 minutes we tried: she
wouldn't nurse with Kendra,
she wouldn't stop crying.
And it got to the point
where we were so unsure
of what was happening
and not able to help her
that we drove to the ER.
Right before we were going into the ER,
and this was just Kendra
with her, I was home
with the kids sleeping.
She finally calmed down.
And Kendra decided to bring
her home and we were then
able to nurse her and
get her back to sleep
about an hour later.
But it is just so scary to see your baby
hurting like that and not
knowing how to fix it.
And feeling out of control.
And it just made me hold her different
and think differently about
how precious she is to me.
She just wants to go jump
on the tramp with the kids.
It's really warm right now, we're up
to 65 degrees right now.
- I'm making Jell-O salad for
the blue and gold banquet.
(upbeat music)
-  So what flavors are you making?
- Strawberry, banana, and berry blue.
Some people will think it's great.
-  They're gonna be surprised.
This will cool it off quicker.
So Kendra hasn't seen my law office.
- It's a cool office.
-  This is our office.
Uncle Brant's here.
- Best.
- We just got somethin' in the mail
that we're excited to open up
because we think we know what it is.
Our you excited?
(baby moans softly)
Yeah, you're super excited.
(Laura screams)
You're just excited because it's a box.
- Yes.
-  What do you
think is inside the box?
- I don't know.
-  Give it a
guess, what do you think?
- The walking animal.
-  Oh a walking animal?
That would be a pretty exciting box.
- I think it's like a reward from YouTube.
-  Ooh!
I think you know.
- I do.
- Who wants to help me open up it?
-  Me.
- Do you guys know what it is?
NaeNae doesn't know.
- See what it is.
-  It's a box.
- You guys ready.
-  Uh-huh, yes.
♪ Shh-Oo-Oo-Oo ♪
(laughing)
♪ Oo-Oo-Oo ♪
-  Yeah.
- The Gold Play Button.
- Yeah.
-  Do you know what it is?
What's a Gold Play Button?
- It's like an iPad, you play on it.
(laughing)
- Wow.
Look at this you guys.
- Can I touch it?
-  There it is.
-  Is it actually gold?
- J House Vlogs.
Congratulations on passing
one million subscribers.
- Wow.
- Wow.
(family laughs)
- You can see yourself.
It's a mirror, it's like
the fun house mirror.
- My face is a triangle.
-  They thought we would use this
as an art decoration.
-  It only works if you're moving.
(animated monster sounds)
- So getting the Gold
Play Button, it reminds me
a lot of the milestones
along our YouTube journey.
(upbeat music)
(laughing)
- Happy one thousand subscribe (laughs).
-  5,000.
(Family member shouts)
- And to celebrate 20,000
subscribers we want you
on J House Vlogs.
-  Thank you.
(screams of enjoyment)
- We decided that we wanted
to try to do 150 candles.
- It's so exciting that
today, on my birthday, we have
hit a huge milestone.
We decided today to celebrate.
By getting 500 food items
that we could take to the local food bank.
To share with those in the community
who are in need of food.
And then of course this
reminds me of when we
did the million subscribers
service celebration,
not too long ago.
That was just an amazing experience
of meeting so many of you.
This is a milestone in our
family and in our journey
that wouldn't be possible
without each one of you.
We love you, we appreciate you.
And thank you for coming
along with our family
on this journey.
And I'm excited for what lies ahead.
We know that this milestone
wouldn't be possible
without each one of you.
So thank you for coming
along for this journey
with our family; and we're excited about
what lies ahead.
- Somehow it changed from like really cold
to really warm.
So it's like the perfect amount of degrees
to go out far in the woods.
-  Let's go exploring.
-  Yeah.
- So a lot of times in the
wooded area here, there's
a lot of ticks and bugs, but
since we're in the middle
of winter and it's warm we
can go exploring in here,
without all the bugs.
(fiddle music)
- I find all the stuff
we don't use anymore.
- I love exploring with our kids.
Look the water is frozen down there still.
You wanna go ice skating on the creek?
- Yeah.
-  Just kidding,
I don't think we can
but we can try to find a way down there.
It's standing alright Caleb?
-  It's gonna break.
-  What'd ya find?
-  Fort.
- The fort we found.
-  Wow.
-  Can we go in?
-  Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, there's animals out here.
(animated music)
- I love exploring because
you get an adventure
and find new things.
It's amazing how sometimes
the best adventures
are right in your backyard or beyond
the fence of your backyard.
- Can we keep going?
-  You wanna keep exploring?
- Yeah.
-  We probably better go back.
We're going to Isaac's blue
and gold banquet tonight.
- Ooh, let's get back.
- But we can hear Laura
belting out tomorrow
at the top of her lungs.
(ball bouncing)
-  Gettin' some breakfast in.
-  So Elise, where
are you heading tonight?
- To ballet.
-  It's been a while
since you've been to ballet, eh?
- Do you wanna stand up?
-  Yeah.
- Stand up and practice.
(baby mumbles sounds)
-  She likes practicing walking.
Oop, she's like I just wanna crawl.
- I learned of a spin
that my teacher hasn't taught me yet.
-  'Kay let's see it.
Whoa.
(laughter)
- She was right behind me.
- I'm crazy.
-  Yeah you are.
- You are too.
-  What are we making?
- Food frost and (mumbles).
- So we made some chicken
taquitos, some rice and some corn
and we're taking it to a family
that we're good friends with
and their mom just went through surgery.
So we're gonna cook 'em
dinner and it smells so good.
And we are snacking on tortilla chips.
Yum-de-de-yum.
- Yummy.
(upbeat music)
- Na, Na, Na.
-  Those are bracelets?
So we came for the blue and gold banquet
and I forgot the Jell-O salad.
So we're gonna go to get that.
- Is it at home?
-  It's at home.
(upbeat music)
Alright let's do this.
- So I just gotta text
from my brother Michael
that my sister-in-law is in labor
and I am so excited for them.
They're having a little boy and that means
that some time tonight,
hopefully, the baby will be born
and I just can't wait.
This reminds me of so much of last year
about this time when I was
getting ready to have Janae.
And babies are just so precious.
I can't wait to see a
little picture of him
and hear his name and updates.
Anyway, that's what I'm
thinking about tonight.
Goodnight, J House out.
So I put Janae in shoes
for the first time.
- Today I'm getting baptized.
- 10 up. Whoa!
