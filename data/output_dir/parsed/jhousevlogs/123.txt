- I'm going on a date with Daddy.
-  Okay are you guys
headed out on a bike ride?
- Yep.
- Yep.
(bright music)
(sneezes)
-  Oh bless you.
-  Finally.
(sweet music)
-  Hey.
(laughing)
- She is crawling so
(Janae squeals)
-  Hey.
- So here in Kansas City,
we are in that gorgeous
time of year when it's nice and cool
in the morning, and
then it's nice and warm
in the afternoon.
And that's fantastic,
I absolutely love fall.
The only problem is I
never know what to wear,
because I get up in the
morning and I'm cold,
so I want to put on like
nice snuggly warm clothes,
but then by the afternoon, I'm roasting
and I want to be in shorts and a t-shirt.
Lise what are you doing tonight?
- I'm going to my first ballet.
-  A real ballet?
- Uh-huh.
-  Who's taking you?
- Dad.
- Dad, so you're going on a date with Dad?
- Uh-huh.
-  And what are
we working on right now?
- Choosing what to do.
-  There this dress
- With this.
-  with that headband.
- Or this dress.
Or this skirt with this.
This with this.
-  Yep and then
this is your little jacket
that you can wear with any of them,
since it'll be cooler out.
-  Yep.
-  Alright, so
you've narrowed it down
to the top four options.
Do you know which one you want to do?
- Yep, this one.
-  This one?
It's a beautiful dress.
Whatcha playin'?
- So this is the kid and this is the mom
and this is the dad, which is silly.
-  Is the dad silly?
- Yeah.
These two are the characters
who goes to this family.
-  Oh very cool.
So what's gonna happen in the story?
- I'm gonna pretend that she's bad.
-  Uh-oh the
ballerina's the bad guy?
- Mmm-hmm.
-  And the characters
are gonna protect the family
from the bad guy?
- Yeah.
-  Do yo have
a little bit of a cold?
Your nose sounds a little bit stuffy.
- That's because I blowed my nose.
-  Did you blow your nose?
- Yeah, that's why I have a cold.
-  Well I'm sorry you have a cold.
I hope you feel better.
- Thanks.
I want to change her outfit.
-  This looks
like a football game.
- I'm defeating him.
- What?
- No, not anymore.
- So some days I have
great self-discipline
with my eating and some days,
not so much.
We're not gonna talk about how many
Oreos I've had today.
Just not gonna talk about it.
(bright music)
That's a cute outfit for Elsa.
You're gonna change the bad guy's outfit?
- Yeah.
-  Oh no, are
you gonna make it scary?
Boy that is a scary looking bad guy.
This is one of our favorite games.
There's a bunch of different kinds,
the game is called Timeline
and this is the American history version.
We also have the world history one
and the inventions one.
We like Timeline, don't we?
- Yeah.
-  Every round of the Timeline's
a little bit different.
Who won?
- You won by one card.
-  Barely, usually
you beat me at this game,
so that's quite the triumph for me.
Oh no.
(enchanting music)
The end, is that your story?
- Yeah.
- That was a fun story.
Isaac has a friend over
and we are having Chick-fil-A.
I love Chick-fil-A's sauce, ya'll.
- That is good.
-  How's Chick-fil-A?
- Good.
-  Doing a little dance,
a little Chick-fil-A dance?
Laura, what have we been doing?
- Puzzles.
-  Puzzles, just you and me, huh.
How many puzzles did we do?
- One two three four five.
-  Five.
- Yeah.
-  Which one's your favorite?
- This one.
-  Yeah, what's that one gonna be?
- Firetruck.
-  (whispers) Firetruck.
- Here's the fire!
- You found the fire for the firetruck.
So we're just hanging out on the floor.
(violin playing)
(piano playing)
(bluesy music)
- Walmart didn't have any of the shoes
we were looking for for Caleb,
so we're trying Target.
(groovy upbeat music)
So we're looking for shoes like this
in Caleb's size.
We're trying another place.
-  Finally.
- So this store only had one pair
that is in his size range, too,
so we'll see if it works.
Those work?
- Mmm-mmm.
- Okay let's get 'em.
Mission accomplished.
You got 'em.
Your Harry Potter outfit is complete.
(sneezes)
-  Oh bless you.
Hi.
(Janae shrieks)
(Kendra laughs)
- Then you go.
-  So Caleb is
starting to learn to type.
How's it going so far dude?
- Good, I want to learn
how to do the games.
-  You want to learn the games?
So he's got his position.
Is this kind of like playing the piano?
- Yes.
(lively playful music)
- He's pumping up the new tires.
So Jeremy and I got a new bike.
We're rally excited about it.
The kids have been riding
around the cul-de-sac
a bunch, and we want to be able
to take them on longer bike rides,
but neither Jeremy or I had a bike,
so we got one that we can share
and Jeremy's pumping up the tires
and getting it ready.
- Yeah, I just love our tree.
-  I know.
-  It makes me so happy.
-  I'm so glad it
didn't break in the storm.
- It was just a little
twig when we moved in,
and as it grows, it's like this memorial
of the growth of our family
while we've been here.
-  Isaac, how are you feeling?
- I'm excited.
-  Usually you just
ride around the cul-de-sac,
this is gonna be different.
- Yeah.
-  There's gonna be hills.
- Yeah.
-  Okay, let's
be safe, let's do it.
-  You look hot as a bicycler.
- Oh yeah I do.
-  Of course, we gotta
get you some of them Spandex.
- We're off.
-  Alright, have fun.
(stopwatch ticking)
- Oh my goodness.
- I'm tired.
-  How was it?
- Tiring.
- But what'd you think?
- I really liked it a lot,
especially when we went up the big hill,
because we started with
the really big hill,
down, so then it went down really fast
and went up.
- It was awesome.
Okay, so here's the embarrassing part,
unfortunately as we were
riding on the last hill home,
I was like man, I'm so tired,
I'm so sore, I forgot how
exhausting it is to ride a bike,
and that's when I realized
I did the gears wrong
the entire time,
like I did it the exact opposite.
And I've done that before.
When I did the triathlon
years and years ago,
I did the entire bike portion
in the complete reverse of the gears,
like when I should've gone into high gear,
I went in the low gear.
I don't know why bikes and gears
are so hard for me with that.
It's like my brain can't figure it out.
So I'm excited for Jeremy
to get to take Elise
on a bike ride and that way
he can feel this worn out too.
Hydrate hydrate hydrate.
You want to hear something funny?
- Yeah.
- I did the gears
- Did you forget?
- backwards.
- Again?
-  Again.
- Did you tell them about this?
-  Yes and I didn't figure it out
until we were on the hill coming home.
I am so sore.
- You just have to do it a lot more then
to figure out the gears.
-  My legs,
these legs are so sore.
You need to go on a bike ride
and you need to do the
gears in the opposite
then they should be,
that way you'll get a really good workout.
- Okay.
- Some are pink and some are green.
Some are the ugliest you'll ever see.
Some might be stripey or polka dotty,
but we can all pajammy
in whatever we gotty,
it's pajama time.
Oh yeah.
Jammy to the left, jammy to the right,
jammy jammy jammy pj.
-  Hey are you guys
headed out on a bike ride?
- Yep.
- Yep.
-  Good luck.
- Thanks.
-  Keep them all alive.
- We will.
You want to come with us?
(lively music)
- Hi Dada.
-  Hi big girl.
You wanna go on a ride?
- Sure.
- I'm gonna take these
little girls on a walk.
Come on.
-  Hey Laura, how was your walk?
- Good.
-  We're having fun.
-  Are you glad
you're wearing your helmet?
- Yeah, to protect me.
-  I've been curling her hair,
we're getting all ready.
- And I put, what's it called again,
deodorant and perfume on.
-  Ooh aren't you grown up.
-  You look
beautiful, I love your dress.
- Thanks.
- We're gettin' her all dolled up.
- She's gonna put on perfume.
-  Perfume.
(lively big band music)
- That's good.
Wow, they do it different.
-  Are you so excited?
- Mmm-mmm.
- So Elise is the perfect date.
She's so sweet.
I think she's told me
she loves me 15 times
in the last hour and she's
so excited to be here,
so it's really fun to be with her tonight.
What do you think?
- I like it.
It's almost like in Cinderella.
(enchanting atmospheric music)
This is tall, wow.
-  Would you like
to be in a ballet someday?
- Uh-huh.
-  Okay go on in.
(laughing)
- Please turn off all
-  Cameras and phones.
- Wuh-oh.
- Once the show starts,
we aren't allowed to film anything,
so I think we're gonna end it right here.
- Good night J House out.
- She's just fun, hi.
(laughs)
Caleb got kneed in almost his eye,
it's already swelling up.
-  This is hard.
-  My body hurts
just watching you guys.
- Pay me, you owe us two dollars.
How's the cookie?
- Good.
(bright music)
