(upbeat music)
- Behhh!
-  Is this your magic wands?
- Yep.
Good sticks chose us.
It's not very bad.
-  What in the world!
I've never seen this before!
Oh, they're goin' that way.
Girls are coloring this morning.
What are you drawing Laura?
- My Mom book.
-  Are you drawing Moana?
- Yep.
-  Elise, what are you workin' on?
- I don't know, I might just do a ton
of squares that might fill.
-  Mmhm.
- Like a different shapes
that would filled up
in the squares, with colors.
-  It's kind of different
to draw on graph paper, huh?
-  Uh huh.
- Well, enjoy seeing
what you come up with.
So Laura designed this
little necklace today.
It's cute.
So obviously, I haven't
gotten ready yet this morning
but Laura came up to me this morning
and she said Mom, I
wanna look fabulous today
and she like did her little necklace,
and she picked out her outfit.
It's just so cute.
So miss Laura wanted this little tie
on her outfit today.
- 'Cause I wanted to look pretty!
-  Well you do look very nice.
Can I see the one in the back?
Turn around, there it is.
She's got one in the back.
What in the world!
I've never seen this before!
(babbling)
-  She is totally standing up!
-  Yeah, we watchin' standing up!
-  Is she standing up?
Janae, you did it.
You did it!
You're standing up.
- She's standing up.
- She's standing up in
no time.
-  She's standin'.
She's standin'.
(laughs)
Oooh, you okay?
You are a stander upper.
She's like, I just wanna
stand back up again.
Such a big girl.
(upbeat music)
Nice!
- Made it!
(laughing)
- Go Isaac, go Isaac!
-  Jeremy doesn't know
I'm filming him right now.
He's trying to just put the tree limb
in the woods, which is not a bad idea
as long as he doesn't get poison ivy.
What we really need is a ladder
and a chain saw, so that
we can just cut it down.
He's so cute in there.
You're so cute!
- Go team.
-  Watch out for poison ivy.
- A wand a cadabra,
a wand a cadabra
- Push (mumbles).
-  Is this your magic wands?
- Yep.
Good sticks chose us.
-  Oooh, very interesting.
Hey Caleb, you need a wand
for your Halloween costume.
Can that be your wand?
- We need to carve it and paint it.
-  How 'bout we
just nave it be a stick?
- No.
-  That would be so much easier!
- No, lets carve it and paint it.
- I think, even Harry's
would just look like a stick.
-  You can use a
real stick that chose you!
- No.
- Dang it.
- (laughing)
Dang it.
(laughing)
-  The kids are playing one
of their favorite games.
Catching leaves.
When the wind blows, they get a big gust
of the leaves
and they try to catch them in air
before they hit the ground.
Get it Elise, get it!
Oh, so close.
It's like catching a snowflake
on your tongue, except for much harder.
Oh, they're goin' that way!
(laughing)
Oh, Oh, Isaac, that was so close!
- Ah!
-  Oh!
(laughing and screaming)
So close.
Here comes, here comes.
-  Oh, there's two!
-  Here comes, oh,
get it, get it, get it!
The kids are cleaning up the big sticks
that have fallen down
so that Jeremy can mow.
(tapping)
(laughing)
Did you find Daddy out there?
(laughing)
(baby laughing)
(tapping and knocking)
(laughing)
-  Boo!
(laughing)
- Janae is so beautiful.
I love her so much.
-  Who was that?
(squeals)
- Daddy.
(laughing)
-  She's like, where'd it go?
-  Where'd he go?
-  Oh, do you hear that?
That's the mower!
Oh my goodness!
You are standing up!
- Yeah!
-  Are you so proud of her?
- Yeah!
(upbeat music)
- So we have a severe
thunderstorm warning going
on right now.
It's still sunny but the
clouds are comin' in.
Hopefully it's not too bad.
What're you guys doin'?
- Playing Harry Potter.
- Yeah!
I'm the big sister now.
- She's her (mumbles).
- Yeah!
I'm (mumbles).
- I'm (mumbles).
-  Cool.
- She's Ginny.
- And my sister died for a few weeks.
It's just hertend.
-  Oh, just pretend?
Will she come back to life?
- No.
- Oh, okay.
Lunchtime!
So every four to six months Kendra's like,
we need to clean the garage
and I feel that too,
so I did a little cleaning
and we have bulk trash coming up,
so I'm wondering if we
should get rid of this toy.
- (mumbles)
- Oh, my turn. My turn.
- It's an old gross toy that
we got from a garage sale.
The kids really love it
every once in a while
but it's big and bulky
and so I think we might get rid of it.
(upbeat music)
Maybe we shouldn't get rid of that toy,
the kids love it.
So this is our donate pile.
It will feel really good when we get rid
of all this stuff.
Alright, so this is the
shoe you were talkin' about?
-  Yep.
-  I see a green like a mint green
and a gray shoe.
That's what I see.
-  Me too.
-  What else is there to see?
- What do you girls see?
- Why do we have to see?
- What color do you think that shoe is?
-  Mint color!
- Gray and mint.
- Okay, our family only
sees gray and mint.
That's what I see too, is a teal gray,
but apparently some people see a pink
and white shoe when they
look at that picture.
- Alright.
- Ahh, I see
some pink!
- I mean, I can see that
there might be a haze of pink.
Like I do see that, I see.
- No like they see it's
like a pink shoe with white.
- What?
- What?
- That's insane, okay
and the poll when you look at the shoe,
do you see the green and gray
or do you see pink and white?
I wouldn't call green, I
mean it's like teal or mint.
- It's like a mint.
- Yeah.
- Let us know in the poll.
- I wish we could ask Janae what she saw.
-  What do you see?
-  I see (mumbles)!
(squeels)
(gives raspberry)
(laughing)
- What color is that shoe?
- Turquiosed?
- What do you see Caleb?
- I see, light blue
and light gray and.
-  No one sees pink.
- No, so apparently some
people when they see
the shoe picture, they see a pink
and white shoe.
-  Isn't that crazy?
So we are only seeing it like this
but apparently some
people the pink and white.
- You'll hear it from a long ways away
as those storms approach.
This is all part of a huge line
of thunderstorms that
will eventually catch up
with the Kansas City metro.
Looks like the metro area will
be impacted just after sunset.
(upbeat music)
-  Barbequed
chicken, potatoes, salad.
-  Looks good.
- What's for dinner?
So I'm making some really
quick pumpkin cookies
and I just wasn't sure if
we had any pumpkin spice.
- We have a little lifetime
- Just kidding, we have.
- Supply.
- Yeah, more than a lifetime supply.
- (laughing) I have a (mumbles).
- The drivers are very bad.
- So we're ending the night with popcorn
and a movie.
(piano music)
-  Thank you.
-  You're welcome.
-  Night Mom.
-  Good night JSL.
I'm going on a date with daddy.
-  Okay, you guys
headed out on a bike ride?
-  Yep!
(sneeze)
-  Oh, bless you.
-  Finally.
