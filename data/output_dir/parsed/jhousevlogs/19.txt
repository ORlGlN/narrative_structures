(upbeat music)
-  Peak-a-boo.
(Janae making noises)
(Jeremy laughing)
-  You guys want to go exploring
in the fort in the ice?
-  Yeah.
(family cheering)
(upbeat music)
(baby laughing)
-  Peak-a-boo, where's your mommy?
Peak-a-boo, ahh you found me.
(baby's laughter)
She makes me feel like I'm like hilarious
cause she laughs so hard.
(baby's laughter)
I'm gonna get you.
So we have another ice storm today.
The ice is thick and
beautiful but also dangerous
on the roads so we are
stuck at home today.
Thankfully, we have something fun to do
and hopefully with the weather forecast,
it will clear up later today.
- So Kendra found a book at
the library about Rube Goldberg
and he was an American
inventor, cartoonist.
When he was 11 years old he drew this.
- What?
- So he knew he loved to draw.
- He's a really good artist.
- I bet his teacher was impressed.
- They like said that they posted it up
and it shows what he was most famous for,
it was making these
cartoon chain reactions.
This cartoon is supposed to show
how someone can get orange
juice in the morning.
- Alright so this one
is how to get a haircut.
Okay, so Rube Goldberg
invented these on paper.
Would you guys like to actually build one?
- Yeah.
- A Rube Goldberg machine.
-  Uh-huh.
- Thank you to Spin Master for
sponsoring our video today.
I was really excited when they reached out
because I've seen these
Rube Goldberg toys around
and I've wanted to try them with the kids
and today's the perfect
opportunity for that.
Hey Caleb, we've got the
speeding car challenge,
the acrobat challenge and the
rocket challenge, the big one.
(upbeat music)
-  Which piece do you need first?
-  Looks like this one.
(upbeat music)
-  This might
belong to somebody else.
Then that's the last step.
Okay, now all you do is
roll this ball into that.
- Yay!
-  I think we skipped some steps.
- I just have five more steps.
- Let's try again.
- Yes, it worked!
- Yay!
-  I'm interested to see
how this chain reaction comes together.
Issac's almost got it.
(suspenseful music)
-  Ohhh.
-  Ohhh.
- Hiccup.
- It's a hiccup.
-  Woooo!
-  Let's keep working on it.
I love that these toys require
the kids to problem solve
and they get to see STEM
principles in action.
They get to see the gravity and the cause
and effect that each action has
on the next action and I just love that.
Educational toys that the
kids enjoy, thumbs up for me.
- Ahh, that was the last one.
- Ohh.
- Yay!
- We were one step away.
- I know.
-  Almost there.
Caleb just wants to keep doing it.
Janae woke up from her nap
and is loving what the kids created.
- Uh-oh.
-  Uh-oh.
(Kendra laughing)
We keep accidentally
setting these things off,
it's hilarious.
Wooooo, the egg even
came out, good job buddy.
- Yay!
-  The acrobat challenge is set.
-  It worked.
(family cheering)
-  We did it.
Thanks again to Spin Master
for sponsoring our video.

(electronic music)
- This is ice.
-  You're eating it?
-  Uh-huh, it's delicious.
- Look what I got.
(upbeat music)
-  It's like you're
walking on ice chips.
- Uh-huh, ohh these things are ahh.
-  Do you guys
want to go exploring
in the fort in the ice?
- So in this crazy, cold weather,
I am so grateful to have a garage
because our car is not
freezing or frozen shut.
(instrumental music)
So I absolutely love my local library.
It has a drive up window
so I can pick up holds
without even getting out of my car.
Here's my stash today, have I mentioned
that we're trying to learn Spanish?
Wow, our driveway is like solid ice.
- So the kids really wanted to come out
and see what the creek was like out here
with this ice freeze that we've had.
Surprisingly, the water is running here.
The little creek isn't frozen.
(funky music)
So when I was a kid
going over barbed wire,
I slipped and was dangling
hooked on to the fence by my leg.
-  Like, was it in your leg?
-  Yeah, I was stuck
to the barbed wire fence.
-  Who got you?
-  I think my brother came out
and helped pull me off and then we had
to clean it out really good.
- Oh.
-  But I bled quite a bit.
So you gotta be careful
when you're on fences, okay?
- Okay.
(upbeat music)
- So it is cold out but the little girls
and I are headed to the gym.
I'm going to work out with a friend
and they're gonna hang
out in the daycare center.
- Hi.
- I think this might be
Janae's first time here
so I'm not exactly sure
how Janae is going to do,
I don't usually bring her
so hopefully she'll stay
with the babysitter and let me workout.
(electronic music)
-  Thanks for coming
out adventuring with us.
(electronic music)
(Jeremy laughing)
There it is, there.
(Jeremy laughing)
So Issac and Elise's
roller skates can convert
into roller blades and they're
wanting to try that today.
(upbeat music)
-  Are you
playing with the big kids?
Yeah, there's lots of toys.
Will you help take care of Naenae?
- Yeah.
-  Are you going
to help too, Britney?
Okay, you guys have fun.
So my favorite thing to do at the gym
is just to get on the elliptical.
I like it cause it's gentle on my knees
and it's not too hard cause I
don't really like working out
too hard but I love that I have a friend
that I come with and so we
just talk the whole time
and I don't even notice
that I'm working out.
(upbeat music)
Well Janae did awesome.
I came in and she was just smiling away.
Did you have fun playing?
- Yeah.
- Well that felt great.
It's so much easier for me to work out
when I have a workout buddy,
makes me be consistent
with like getting in and doing
it and not just being like,
oh it's cold out, I don't want
to go today and so, felt good.
(Janae making noises)
-  Janae loves this,
Caleb you're such a nice brother.
- I'm glad it's not like.
(Janae laughing)
I'm glad it's not like 10 pounds.
-  She probably weighs
more than 10 pounds, Caleb.
-  Issac, you
picked it up pretty quick.
(funky music)
-  She's like crazy hair.
So how was roller blading?
- It was really fun.
-  Yeah, so which one do you think
you like better roller
skating or roller blading?
- Roller blading because
it just feels more hard
and looks awesome.
-  It does look pretty awesome.
So the reason we wanted
to switch them over
to the roller blades was
so you guys could get ready
to learn how to ice skate.
- Yeah, so I'm glad when I
get on the ice rink, zoom.
-  Yeah, you're gonna go crazy.
We're hoping to go ice skating soon.
- That's gonna be fun.
- Poll question, do you like
roller skates or roller blades?
Womp, womp.
- Womp, womp.
(upbeat music)
- (speaks in Spanish)
- So in college, Kendra
actually did a study abroad
in Mexico and we want to make sure
our kids are familiar with Spanish.
- Well it's bedtime, we're in our pajamas
and we should be getting into bed
but Caleb wants to try his
chain reaction one more time
and Jeremy has a crazy idea up his sleeve.
- I just want to see if we can get his car
to hit this one and make
bigger chain reaction.
-  Caleb's got
his speedy car challenge
all the way hooked up,
all loaded, ready to go.
That ball's gonna be getting it all.
Laura, do you think it's gonna work?
- Yeah.
- I feel like the mark of a good toy is
when the adults enjoy playing with it.
- Alright, we're gonna
see if it will work.
(upbeat music)
(family cheers)
- Now it didn't do everything just right.
-  But it worked.
- But it shot the acrobat.
-  The acrobat flew.
- Yep, so that was fun.
- It just like everything
went down and bam.
Goodnight J House.
(Laura humming)
- So the boys are just
looking out the window
and they think they see bobcat on a tree.
(upbeat music)
- What is that noise,
stop making that noise.
