- So today is Jeremy and I's anniversary,
and we are out together celebrating.
I am going to go have an
eye doctor appointment.
The kids are helping.
(lively music)
Let's see what kinds
I'm gonna be looking at.
- We know how to live
it up anniversary style.
- Oh yeah, eye doctor, board game.
-  Kendra's trying contacts.
- And then you grab it.
(playful music)
(Janae cooing)
-  Yeah.
Whatcha doing buddy?
- Um, play.
(classical music)
-  Is that for me?
(dramatic music)
- I'm strong.
-  Strong enough to do the dishes.
You puttin' on some make-up?
(classical music)
- Uh-huh.
-  Can you go (smacking).
(smacks)
How did it turn out?
Thanks for doing the trash you guys?
- Yeah.
- It's stinky.
-  Yeah, that's
what happens with trash.
- It's so funny, like I just keep thinking
about that this morning,
because Jeremy and I are getting
a bunch done this morning.
And it's because we're motivated.
We have a deadline that
we're working towards
and we gotta get it done,
so we're just doing it
and it's just amazing,
like, how to get stuff done.
Do it.
The kids are helping undecorate the tree.
So yo have to follow the right lines.
If you're pulling on the wrong part,
then it won't come off.
So you just kind of unhook
it from the branches.
Good job.
Now Caleb and Laura are helping.
What are you guys up to?
- We're getting all these.
-  Yep, all the little
branches that fell down.
- It's time.
-  It is.
- But after Christmas,
my birthday is coming,
so Christmas has to go away,
right Mom?
-  Yep, Christmas
has to going away
so we can get to Laura's birthday.
How old are you gonna be?
Four.
So today is Jeremy and I's anniversary
and we are out together celebrating.
- I can't believe it's been 13 years.
- 13.
That makes me feel old and maybe wise,
like maybe we've gathered some wisdom
in these years?
Anyway, we're starting by eating.
(funky bright music)
So I ordered a pesto chicken quinoa bowl.
-  She went healthy.
- I wanted to.
-  I went with biscuits and gravy.
- Well we're a pretty normal couple.
We just like to do kind of classic things
for our anniversary.
- Yeah.
- So we went out to eat
and now we're going to Target.
It gets better than that,
we are not just going to Target.
-  No.
- I am going to have an
eye doctor appointment,
I'm hoping.
- I was hoping for the
anniversary special,
you know 'cause so many people come
on their anniversary for eye appointments.
- Yeah, that's the thing to do.
Anyway, my eyes have
been really bothering me
and I just haven't had time.
- So we were able to get an appointment
in 20 minutes.
So we're just looking
at glasses now to see--
- Let's see what kinds
I'm gonna be looking at.
- Yeah.
(mellow music)
So poll question.
Do you wear contacts or glasses?
Let us know in the poll.
- Check out this shape.
What do you think?
-  Neato.
- Neato?
(Jeremy laughs)
He's not feeling it.
- No they're fine.
That's the funny thing about styles,
because they completely change.
Where one thing that
was like a grandma style
is now apparently cute,
and I don't keep up
with all the styles.
- What do you think?
-  You just look good
no matter what you have on.
(bell dings)
- So I think I kind of like the cat eyes.
What do you think of these ones?
- Kinda different.
- They look good.
- Kinda different.
-  So we're
looking at different games.
This one's like an air hockey board game.
That sounds fun.
But the one game that I would dominate,
and would love is this right here.
-  That's embarrassing.
-  The Saved by the Bell game.
I would know every answer.
- Check it out,
there's also the Bob Ross game.
-  And a Super
Mario Brothers game.
And an Oregon Trail game.
- Scattergories, you can't go wrong.
- We know how to live
it up anniversary style.
- Oh yeah, eye doctor, board game.
(Jeremy laughs)
And we're also considering
a different ring.
What would that be like?
-  So we decided
on Exploding kittens.
-  And show them the other one.
Pucket.
He's gonna win, but I'm gonna try.
So I don't know much
about exploding kittens,
but I know I've heard about
it a lot of different places,
so we're gonna give it a try.
(bright music)
-  I can see it.
-  That's your eye.
-  Whoa, that's your eye.
-  So open both real wide.
- Woop!
(laughs)
-  Happy anniversary hon.
Happy anniversary.
(Jeremy laughs)
Kendra's trying contacts.
-  Look down.
-  For the first time.
-  Awesome.
-  Nailed it.
- Is it in my eye?
-  Yep.
-  Cured.
Kendra's trying to figure out
how to put in the contacts by herself.
-  Just try to get as
close to the eyelid as you can,
because the more room
you have to work with,
the easier it's gonna be.
And so what you're gonna do,
is you're gonna use your index finger
and your thumb on the bottom hand,
and just reach in and just pluck it out,
like you're trying to pick
something up off the ground.
So you're already really
close right there.
So you just have to apply a little bit
more pressure than you think.
- Awesome.
- Got it.
-  That was great, yeah.
And then you just place it right in there.
And so that's what you're
gonna do every single night.
- Where did it go?
-  It's still in your eye, yeah.
- Okay.
- Awesome.
- Nice.
- Got it.
- Man, nice.
-  Kendra's a gifted student.
- I feel like I'm going fishing.
- Yeah exactly.
Alright and then put it
right near your pupil.
- Ah!
-  You almost had it there.
Real quick I would pull
your finger back out.
You might want to dry
off your index finger.
It's gonna cling to whatever is the--
- Most wet.
-  Most wet, exactly.
- Ah!
-  Try to keep
looking straight Kendra.
-  And blink blink blink.
Awesome yeah.
- Is it in there?
-  Yeah, you got it right in there.
Hey high five.
You're doing it crazy fast.
-  We have a movie
we're trying to get to.
-  Yeah true.
- So the next really
romantic thing we're doing
is coming home to nurse Janae.
Here's what the kids are doing obviously.
- Ready.
- Green light.
Red light.
You guys all have to go back.
-  Yeah, you can't keep riding.
You gotta stop.
Do you know how to stop you guys.
- I don't.
-  Yeah, you just
lift your foot forward.
- Just one foot.
- Green light.
Red light.
(Jeremy laughs)
- Now we're headed to a movie,
which is a much more normal
anniversary thing to do.
So we're gonna see The Greatest Showman.
Sounds good.
- I think it's a musical.
-  Thank you.
-  Let's do it.
- We made it on time
and we found seats together.
(rousing music)
(stopwatch ticking)
So I just told the kids
that I got contacts today.
Can you guys see 'em?
- No.
- No.
(enchanting music)
- It's like little tiny
circles around my eyes.
- Can I see Mom?
- Now you can swim--
_ kind of.
- Now you can swim with your eyes open.
- Wow, are you sure, or
will the contacts fall out?
- When you you have to take them out,
do you have to like touch your eyeball?
- I do.
It's kinda weird.
-  She's getting
pretty good at it though.
- So what you do is you open your eye
really big like that,
and then you grab it.
-  Nae Nae!
We missed you.
- So I'm supposed to wear 'em for a week
and then I decide if I
want glasses or contacts.
- Daddy is it your second anniversary
or your third anniversary
or your fourth anniversary?
-  It's our
thirteenth anniversary.
- I was way off.
- Can you believe that?
- We've been married for 13 years.
- Wow, I was way off.
Goodnight, J House out.
-  Nae Nae, what's
your New Year's resolution?
(Janae vocalizing)
- I think she wants to learn
to speak more words.
-  Maybe walk?
Can we go for potty trained
or is that too early?
- No we're not gonna
go for potty training.
- Okay.
So my New Year's resolution
is to limit fear's power over me.
When I see opportunities
or when I feel like
I should do something, I don't want fear--
