- We're doing the no thumbs challenge!
-  She's going in. She wants it.
(laughs)
- What?
- Hey dad?
-  Yeah?
- Will you even be able to take it off?
-  Yes, for sure.
- What will happen if
you won't be able to?
-  Then we'll just, not
have a thumb forever, I guess.
All right so we have a fierce competition
between Isaac and Elise,
and how about this,
whoever wins, gets to dump a bowl of ice
down the back of the
shirt of whoever loses.
- Like actually like, you are like this.
- Yup and the ice goes down your back.
What do you guys think?
- Good.
- Okay.
All right you guys ready
for your first challenge?
- Mmmhmm
-  Is the first person
to write your first name.
(playful music)
- Done.
-  Good job! Elise you're
so close look, there it is.
Try to color without thumbs.
- A person.
-  Here's Caleb's drawing.
Pretty impressive buddy.
I'm amazed, that was good.
- Here, here's mine.
-  Oh, look at Laura's drawing!
Laura, that is beautiful.
First person to cut your paper in half.
Be careful, don't hurt yourself.
Those are big cuts for both of you.
She's using gravity. She's using gravity!
She's so close.
He's so close.
They're both right there.
Oh they've won it!
She got it!
I don't know. I'll have
to go back and watch.
I was looking at Elise
because she was so close and then I turned
and you got it, so maybe Isaac won.
We'll have to do an instant replay.
- I'm guessing I won but Elise could have.
- I kind of ripped it.
- Yeah instant replay, that'll be good.
(slow motion instant replay)
-  All right now let's
see if you guys can glue
one piece of paper on to the other.
- It's hard without a thumb.
-  Who can do it first?
Oh Elise got you on that one.
- Look at blue.
- All done.
- Peanut butter
- And jelly
(laughs)
- Peanut butter
-  Your next task
- Make a peanut butter and honey sandwich?
-  That's right, ready go!
- That is a really hard thing.
- Ah, I can't do it!
-  There you go.
- I don't know how to open these.
-  You got to turn it
in the right direction buddy
to get it off.
- Done
-  Oh she wins!
It's now two to two.
- Could I finish because I
like peanut butter sandwich?
-  Sure!
- Made a sandwich!
Awesome taste!
- Mmm good.
Best peanut butter sandwich ever.
-  How's your sandwich?
- Good.
I'm going to put honey on
the top so it's a little big.
-  All right this next
challenge is going to be
whoever can drink all of this milk first
wins!
- Good thing I'm fast at drinking.
-  Ready, go!
(fast music)
-  Elise wins again!
- Drinking breaths, breaths.
-  The score is Elise 3, Isaac 2.
- I don't have a napkin.
-  You guys have milk mustaches.
- How about the next challenge?
-  Ice cream
- Ice cream!
-  You've got to get
the ice cream lid off,
you got to scoop the
ice cream into the bowl
enough to cover the bottom
and then eat it
and whoever does that first,
wins this one, okay.
Ready, set, go!
(grunts)
- This is a hard challenge.
-  You guys get enough to eat it now.
- Okay, got it.
Just have to use my tummy.
(laughs)
-  Very creative.
Just had to use your tummy.
(laughs)
You might need to use your
finger to get that off.
Good job.
(laughs)
With her hands and her fingers.
All right, that's enough
ice cream now eat it.
- Mmm good, it's really good.
-  She's going in.
She wants it.
She wants this win!
(laughs)
He wants it!
You guys are going to
get brain freeze bad.
(laughs)
All right Isaac's almost done.
He only has one more scoop left.
Elise's going for it!
She wants it!
(laughs)
You done?
- Mm-Hmm.
-  And Isaac finishes the ice cream!
Good job.
- I'll just eat the rest.
- I loved that one.
That time you were like,
I just got to use my fingers.
(laughs)
Hey could I scoop some more?
Now I know that I'm good at
scooping ice cream because I
could do it without a thumb
- Well I know that I know
how to scoop ice cream out
because I can use my tummy and my fingers.
(laughs)
- Mmmmmmm
- If you use your tummy and fingers
you can get an ice cream.
If you use your tummy and fingers
you can get your ice cream, oops!
- All right you are tied three to three,
so this is the final event and
determines who wins it all.
You have to put toothpaste
on your toothbrush
you have to brush five times,
one, two, three, four, five.
And then spit in the bowl.
Whoever's spit is on
the bottom of the bowl,
wins it all.
You ready?
You can't touch it, hands on your lap.
(guitar playing)
On your mark, get set, go!
- Oh, too much. But it's all right.
-  One, two, three, four, five!
Oh, Elise spit!
- Woohoo!
-  Good job Elise!
(slow motion replay)
(laughs)
(spitting)
- More
(laughs)
-  So Elise did you think
that you would be able to
beat Isaac?
- No.
-  I'm so proud of
you, you worked really hard
and you were really competitive.
Hugs!
And now, because Elise won,
she gets to dump the ice
down Isaac's shirt.
- Only do two at a time.
(laughs)
- Okay you dump it down all in his shirt.
(laughs)
- Who wants to eat some ice?
- Not me!
- J House out!
(classical music)
(laughing)
