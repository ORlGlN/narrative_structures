- We have been vlogging for one month,
and we wanted to step aside
from just showing our
normal, everyday family life,
and show what our YouTube life
has been like this last month.
I know a lot of you watch family vloggers,
and I had no idea that this month
would be like what it was,
and the emotions that we had,
and the experiences that we had.
We wanted to put some of that out there
to give you a little sneak peak
into what it's been like to
jump into the YouTube world
with both feet.
(energetic bouncy orchestra music)
Is it going?
- Yes.
- Is it going?
- Could you zoom into our different faces?
-  Yeah.
- Not zoom, but come closer.
We are family (mumbles).
I got all my sugar to me.
(everyone laughs)
Okay, the photo's napping.
- We are family.
We are recording.
- We're live.
- Under a camera for the first time.
I'm about to make my
first J House vlog public.
This is an exciting moment.
Look how excited Kendra is.
- I'm super excited.
- It happened.
We did it.
We have a vlog.
We have a video on our vlog.
We have a video on J House Vlogs.
I think you're up to
six Instagram followers.
- Yes.
- I'm up to five Twitter,
Tweeter, Twitter followers,
but we do have 28 subscribers
on our YouTube channel,
so that's good.
Not all of them are family.
We can't see several of 'em.
- Only two of 'em are us.
- That's true.
You keep turning the camera away from me.
- You said you would trust me.
I think he wants to make love.
- Here's Kendra videoing.
(laughs)
- That's why I keep turning it,
'cause you're holding it like this,
and I'm not even in that video.
- We don't have one of the cameras
where you can see the picture.
- There we go.
- Hopefully we're in it.
- We'll just hold it like this.
- That's funny (chuckles).
- How are you feeling about it?
I am feeling a little bit scared,
a little bit vulnerable,
like this dream that was like,
well this'll be fun.
It is becoming more of a reality,
and even though I knew
when we were filming stuff,
that I was taking an
inside portion of my life
and putting it out there.
Now it's actually out there.
- When you were just
getting to know someone,
you don't always put out all
of your most vulnerable things,
and I can see that we're doing that
with our YouTube channel too.
As we're editing,
sometimes we're taking out
some of the more vulnerable parts.
I think we'll open up more,
and be authentic, and
allow more parts of us
to be seen as we feel
more comfortable with it.
I'm excited.
I wish I had more time for it.
It's hard because we still
have four little kids.
I still have clients who are calling me
and emailing me all the time.
- Caleb, what did you way in your prayer?
- That mom's not losing her brain.
- He said, "We're thankful that
mom's not losing her brain."
Your family is amazing.
I'm 20 years old, and I see your family,
and I think this is where
I one day want to be.
Your videos are so inspiring,
and I love the attention
you give your children,
and make them all feel special.
-  Caleb, go to the (laughs)-
- Thanks for taking the
time to make these videos.
You guys are awesome.
We have a fan.
- Wait, we have a fan
who's not our family,
or someone who's obligated to like us.
- It's awesome, he
doesn't have to like us.
Yay.
- I got the tricycle, but
once again I'm chasing Caleb.
Cue more footage of us chasing Caleb.
Kendra right now is Skyping
with another YouTuber
that we met.
-  In duck lake.
- No, don't film us right now Jeremy.
-  Can I vlog you, rip a crick?
-  Sure.
-  Wait, let me see if I did this,
from Japan.
- Hi.
-  What's your channel?
- Mint2Be.
-  Okay.
-  We'll show your channel.
-  Well there we
go, sorry, I'll let you guys
get back to your conversation.
- Okay.
- I think I embarrassed
Kendra a little bit.
This little bundle of goodness.
(gurgles)
(baby laughs)
- This is kind of embarrassing.
The embarrassing part is that
we just had a whole discussion
about this, but the memory
card wasn't in the camera.
The other embarrassing part
is that it's 3:00 a.m.,
and I just finished editing.
-  At around-
- Are you okay if I show you?
That just is funny.
- Hello (chuckles).
- With the growth, and
the newness of the vlog,
Kendra and I had to commit today
that we wouldn't look from
the time that if left to work
until lunch.
What happened while we were gone?
- Well, we jumped from
87 to 96 subscribers,
and we got loads of comments.
Now, just since we've been home,
anyway, we're up to 98.
I think we're coming up on the 100 mark.
- It's a big deal.
It's a milestone to hit 100.
- You have to look at the camera.
- It's a big deal to hit 100.
It was 10 minutes ago.
We think we might be at 100 now.
Let's see.
- We're so eager.
- I can't see it.
- 99.
-  There it is.
We're so close.
- So close.
Shall we refresh it again?
-  Yeah, let's do.
Okay.
Let's see.
Okay, go ahead, refresh it.
-  I did refresh it.
-  Refresh it again.
-  Dang it.
All right, go back to work.
- Oh, I have to go work now.
-  Caleb.
- We found him with the razor.
He had already taken one swipe.
-  Luckily no blood.
Caleb, how'd you even get up here?
- I climbed right there, right there.
- How'd he climb up here?
- We're having some growing pains
trying to figure out how to make this work
in our daily life, and with our family,
'cause we definitely
don't want it to take away
from our kids and the
attention we can give them,
in our lives that we have.
Anyway, just being real about the balance
that we're trying to learn,
and ooh, wanted me to be real smart.
Here's my bathroom.
Oh, what a mess.
Okay, so Jeremy and I are having a contest
to see who's the better camera holder.
I feel like I do a pretty good job
of holding the camera.
- I think your finger's
over the mike right now.
- Aah, dang it.
All right.
- Jeremy's turn.
- Now it's Jeremy's turn to try.
Where are the mikes on the camera?
- That's right here.
(quiet scream)
- Jeremy, come here, 150.
Yes.
70 have subscribed to us.
(quiet scream)
Look, Sam and Nia.
- Sam and Nia are the
first family vloggers
that I ever started watching.
I started them the day
before their day one
of vlogging, which was
their April Fools' one.
- I can't believe they subscribed to us.
- Let's see if any of the
comments are from them.
-  That little
spider of yours is adorable.
- It's so funny, 'cause I
mean, I know that Sam and Nia
aren't celebrities, but you
feel like you know them.
These are like friends, but
they didn't know about us.
Do you know what I mean?
That's one of the things is, I mean,
I feel like just know them
and they are friends of mine.
They didn't even know who we are,
and now it's like they're meeting us
now for the first time.
It's kind of exciting too.
YouTube is so cool.
- We're not like crazy stalkers.
- Well we already know where they live,
and we're coming.
We're going to show up
at the door at 2:00 a.m.
We're here.
You shared our video.
- We got the memo.
We knew you wanted to be our friends too.
- Kendra was wearing
these super sexy pants.
Am I allowed to say that?
- No.
- It's just PG.
She was.
- What do you think you should do
to be obedient?
-  That's a great question.
-  Kendra's nursing.
I almost accidentally got
some of that in there.
-  Okay dad, what
do you think you could do
to be more obedient?
That was the question of the lesson.
-  To be more obedient,
I need to pay attention more
to what the rules are.
Sometimes I ignore the rules,
or I forget about them, and
to try to remember the rules
would help me out.
-  I think sometimes for me,
what I need to do to
be more patient is to,
not patient,
to be more obedient is to-
Jeremy, what just happened?
- We made money.
We're up to four cents.
We end on the 11th of
October with 204 subscribers.
That's pretty exciting.
-  Wait, you didn't
capture my enthusiasm.
-  I think I hadn't
turned off the camera yet,
so I think we caught your enthusiasm.
It's because it's like-
-  It's really October 12th.
- 1:30.
- Nope not is what we're doing.
- Here's the best part of
our behind the scenes footage
is Kendra in bed at two in the morning.
Thanks for following us.
We hope you don't leave
now that we've scared you.
- The next day we're go refresh is
there's going to be they
haven't subscribed to us.
- Like dead silence.
We don't know where they went.
- Foiled.
- Sorry.
