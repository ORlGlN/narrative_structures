- Good morning, so this morning
I am going to a workout group.
There's a women's workout
group at my church
and it's once a week
and they get together,
and it's supposed to be pretty intense.
And I have been kind of dragging my feet.
I'm like oh I don't think that works
with my schedule,
but really I am scared
of working out that much.
Like I am not in good shape
since having Janae, and since
being pregnant with Janae.
It's like I love working out,
but when I work out by myself,
I can just kind of, you know, take it easy
and not sweat too much.
And here, if everybody
else is working out,
I'm gonna feel ridiculous if I'm like,
mmm, I'm gonna take a break.
And I know at the end of it,
I'm gonna be glad I did it,
but I'm honestly scared,
so I'm sitting out here
in my car, just kind of stalling.
- You can do it Mom.
- Let's do this.
(funky dance music)
Well I did it.
I made it through the entire workout
and it actually felt really good,
I'm really proud of myself for going.
I'm grateful Jeremy encouraged me to go.
And now it's time to start
working out like that regularly.
Elise, can I see your picture?
- Well I'm not exactly done with it,
but I'm done with the main part.
And I have a vampire.
-  On the back?
- This is a little fan for my teacher.
-  Well did you make it?
It's beautiful.
- Lise helped me.
- Dad's having a hard day,
because his computer's not working.
-  So Jeremy got a new computer.
- I've had a lot of problems
with the transition.
Like for some reason my monitor
won't plug into it,
and there's all these
adapters you have to have.
When I tried to get the vlog up,
there was no audio on the vlog
and so I'm struggling a little bit
with the computer today.
-  It's been a frustrating day.
Alright well good luck,
We'll spread fairy dust
of like happy computer
thoughts your way.
- Thank you.
-  And I'm just glad
you have a diaper down here.
- You need that sometimes.
-  You do.
- Janae's down here often, so.
- Right.
So I decided to show some of the kids
some of the stuff I did
in my workout group today.
20 jumping jacks go.
One.
(uptempo dance music)
One two three.
Everybody make it look like a table
and then you kick up.
Ready?
- Hee haw, hee haw, hee haw, hee haw.
- Those are called donkey kicks.
- Is that why we're
making the awesome noise?
So we're all together eating lunch
and Laura announced that she
had some bad news for us.
What's the bad news Laura?
- One time I fell on my back
and I broke my head.
-  When did that happen?
- When I was a grandma.
-  Back when you were a grandma?
- Yeah.
- That's really sad,
I'm glad you're better.
I gave Janae one of these pouch thingies.
It's apple and sweet potato.
Is there food in there?
Yeah, that's fun, huh.
(squealing)
Squeeze it up.
Whoa, a little much.
-  It's so yummy.
-  Look at Janae.
I love that the kids can feed themselves
from such a young age with these.
Okay so I've been trying
for about the last hour
to get Janae to take a nap
and Laura won't take a nap,
and so I'm dealing with both of them
while trying to manage school
and I haven't decided what
we're having for dinner yet
and it's stormy outside,
so it's just kind of overcast and blah.
I did finally get Janae to go down,
so we'll see how long she stays down.
So last night when I went shopping,
I bought myself some
amazing dark chocolate,
like the kind that I can
put away in the cupboard
and just eat a little at a time.
It even had like a dark
chocolate ganache inside.
Apparently I paid for it,
it's on the receipt,
but I lost it somehow,
it's not in any of the bags,
it hasn't been unloaded
in my house anymore,
so I'm kind of grumpy about the chocolate.
And I know something else went wrong.
What was something else that went wrong?
Oh, since I went to workout this morning,
which was awesome,
now I'm still in my workout clothes,
and I can't find time to actually shower
and get ready for the day.
So there we go, Kendra rant.
Kendra rant over.
Caleb's doing some math.
Isaac, what are you working on?
- I'm working on my spelling test.
-  Number one, tomorrow.
I picked this little book up
in the dollar bin at the store yesterday
and I think somebody's gonna enjoy it.
What is it?
- It's a Halloween one.
-  Yeah it's a coloring book,
let's get out some colored pencils.
What's this?
- A pumpkin.
-  Yeah.
- I love it.
- With a mustache.
- Thank you Mom.
- You're welcome.
(atmospheric music)
Spelling test number three, he aced it.
You aced it dude.
- It's so creepy.
-  Did you make that face?
- Yeah, it's a witch one.
-  Is that a witch one?
That is funny.
(rain falling)
Well you've got to admit
that is a gorgeous view,
even in the rain.
(laughing)
They are loving this Lise.
Woo.
-  So Elise told
me she could hang out
with the girls while I take a shower.
And everybody's doing great?
- I sit like this.
Like this with Janae Nae on my lap.
- Ready set go.
- Janae Nae on your lap.
-  You going slow for Janae?
- Yeah.
- This is about as fast
as Laura and Janae like.
-  So the girls are up here
and the boys are down here.
Are you guys playing football?
- Yeah.
- He's trying to get me.
Touchdown.
Gotcha.
- I was able to get the
video up with audio.
(bell dings)
-  Yay, we're so proud of you.
- Two hours later.
- Dad, do you want to play with us?
-  High five.
- Yeah, I'll play with
you, that sounds fun.
Okay the plan?
You score a touchdown.
- Yeah!
- One two hike.
Get open.
-  Oh so close.
- Sut hike.
(laughing)
I'll block for you.
- Oh he didn't get it.
-  Go Caleb go.
Go Caleb go.
- Touchdown!
- Woo!
-  Dad was doing
some great defense.
- That's like MC Hammer block move.
Can't touch this.
â™« Oh oh
-  Oh good catch, good catch.
You guys are all doing great.
- You gotta block me.
(laughing)
-  Woo!
- All I did was stand here.
Well I think the kids are
in a really goofy mood.
(laughing)
So what inspired the madness?
- Laura just had one on,
and we just
-  Took it from there?
- Yeah.
Something's coming out.
-  This reminds
me of our first vlog,
do you guys remember that?
- Yeah, we had diapers.
(laughing)
-  What's so funny?
- I have a diaper on.
Diapers!
- Diapers!
-  You had diapers on your head.
- That gives me an idea.
(laughing)
- Three years have past,
and we haven't changed one bit.
-  So check out this cute note
that got left on my door.
(tender music)
Dear Mom I love you,
I know you're having a hard day,
I know that you're tired,
love and kisses, your secret friend.
You know, today definately
had some just frustrations,
just those little daily
irritations of regular life,
but it also had a lot
of really good moments,
and so I'm gonna choose
to celebrate the good.
And tonight, we're gonna literally go
celebrate the good.
Elise has worked so stinkin'
hard on her math program.
To we're gonna celebrate
Elise and her hard work today,
we're gonna go out to dinner.
- Yay!
-  Well I graded it.
Do you want to hear the results?
- Yeah.
-  You got 100%.
- Yay!
-  I'm so proud of you.
Do you want to go celebrate?
- Yeah.
(upbeat atmospheric music)
-  Good job Elise.
- I got some too.
-  Like a fork?
- Accept the next proposition you receive.
-  Uh-oh, will you marry me.
- Yes I will.
-  Nailed it.
- Avoid unchallenging occupations,
they waste your talents.
- You and your spose will
be happy in life together.
- You and your spouse,
- You and your spouse
-  that's about
you and your wife someday.
(laughing)
You'll be happy.
-  There you go, do
you want me to read it for you?
If given a penny for every kind act,
you'd be a millionaire.
(laughing)
- Especially when you count back
when you were a little grandma.
- No kidding, that's when
it really starts adding up.
-  She's thinking about that.
- Lady luck will soon visit you.
-  Lady luck will soon visit you.
- That's supposed to be for a boy.
- No, it means you're gonna be lucky.
-  Really?
- Yeah, something lucky's gonna happy.
- I wonder what's gonna happen?
-  Something lucky.
Last one.
- You are extremely generous
and always thinking of others.
I have no response to that.
-  I agree, I agree.
- That was my cookie, give it back!
(lively music)
Some day they'll get
friends and get married,
and their friends and
family will tell them,
that it's not normal to
dance in restaurants.
- Alright, we're gonna head to gymnastics
and go to bed.
Good night.
J House out.
- You know Harry at Hogwarts.
He talks in British.
(boing boing)
- Hi.
Say goodbye.
Parade of Homes.
- What, what?
-  What did you guys find?
- Get the door, Elise!
- Arms up.
(laughing)
