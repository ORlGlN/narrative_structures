- Thanksgiving is my
absolute favorite holiday.
And it was really hard to narrow down
my favorite Thanksgiving books.
But I did it, so here they are.
My five favorite children's
Thanksgiving books.
First up we have
"Thank you, Sarah. The Woman
Who Saved Thanksgiving".
And this is the story of Sarah Hale,
a woman you lived in the 1800s,
and petitioned and campaigned for
Thanksgiving to become a national holiday.
- Zachary Taylor, he said no.
And Pierce said no and
then James Buchanan.
But then Lincoln said yes.
-  What do you
like about this story?
- Her secret weapon, a pen.
-  Her secret weapon is a pen?
I had never heard of
Sarah Hale's story before,
but when I read it in this book
I found it so compelling and
empowering and inspiring.
This woman single-handedly
did amazing things
for the women's movement in America
and for Thanksgiving as a holiday.
But as soon as I finished it
I had to find a biography
about her and just read more.
And I may or may not have sat Jeremy down
that night, the very first
night I read this book,
and read him the picture book.
Next up we have "Thanks for Thanksgiving".
This is a simple, short book
that just talks about things
that we are thankful for.
The illustrations are gorgeous
and for the age of my children
I just always have found
it a little bit magical.
It's definitely up there in my
favorite books for children.
The next up is called
"Balloons over Broadway.
The True Story of the
Puppeteer of Macy's Parade".
This is the story of Tony Sarg
who is the man who invented
and came up with the idea
of the balloons in the Macy's Day Parade.
And I don't know about you guys,
but the Macy's Day Parade is definitely
one of my family's
Thanksgiving traditions.
And one of my life-long dreams
is to go to that parade.
- This is the parade part.
-  This is the parade part?
-  Yeah.
-  Oh my goodness.
What do you like about it?
- I'll show ya.
This part.
-  This part?
What do you like?
- That man.
- So I loved hearing the story
about how that parade came to be
and how the puppets and
the balloons came to be,
and kinda the different problems
that they had with them.
Just a really fun biography.
Next up are two silly ones
that my kids just laugh and giggle about.
The first one is called
"One is a Feast for Mouse".
And it's about this little
mouse that, you know,
scurries up on the table
after Thanksgiving dinner
and he finds all these little crumbs.
And at first he's content
with one little pea
but then he wants like a little olive,
and a thing of mashed potatoes,
and some gravy, and a pumpkin pie.
And it's all a leaning
tower above his head
that comes crashing down
and eventually he runs back into his hole
and barely escapes capture by the cat.
He ends up with just one little pea again.
And he just says, one
is enough for a mouse.
Anyways, so there's like
a little subliminal theme there
about not trying to be too
greedy and ask for too much.
The next silly Thanksgiving
book that my kids enjoy is
"I Know an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Pie".
She swallowed it whole the entire roll.
She swallowed the roll
to go with the cider
that rumbled and mumbled
and grumbled inside her.
She swallowed the cider
that moistened the pie,
the Thanksgiving pie
which was really too dry.
Perhaps she'll die.
-  Alright, Lis, what
did you like about this book?
- I like it because whenever she comes,
she eats a whole thing.
See?
-  What happened?
- She swallowed the pan.
-  She swallowed a whole pan?
- Aha.
- Anyway, it's just a silly book
about all these things
that this woman eats.
But you can actually
kind of resonate with it
because on Thanksgiving we eat so much.
Anyway, there are loads of amazing
Thanksgiving books out there.
But I highly recommend these ones.
They're definitely worth your time.
And I hope you guys have
a happy Thanksgiving.
Happy reading.
