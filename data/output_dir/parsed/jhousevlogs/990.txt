- Alright, so I don't know if any of you
have ever had this experience, but,
it sometimes feels like, when
you're trying to do something
that's like, a family tradition,
and it's like a happy memory,
and you're getting ready to
go, and everyone's screaming,
and everyone's fighting, and
somebody's throwing a tantrum
and nobody can find two
shoes for the life of them,
and you're running behind, and,
then the parents start
like, snipping at eachother,
and then you're all packed up in the car
then you forget something,
and you run back up,
and then you actually
- I need to go back and get my sunglasses
(laughs)
I'm serious, I'm actually
- Then you actually
drive away and of course
you have to go back and
get something inevitably.
- Why does that happen every time?
- Your entire car is
like, loaded to the brim.
Somebody's whining in
the back about something.
- I need my other book.
-  You need a different book?
-  No, I need my other baby.
(sigh)
- I wish we were faking all of this.
(laughs)
- Ya that never happens to us either.
(nutcracker theme song)
- So this is the
Christmas tree ranch farm.
Check out the cute barn!
-  It's a fun place.
Ya, I think this is our fourth year
to come here to get our Christmas tree.
- So you come and you cut down your own,
and you go on a little sleigh ride,
and you drink some hot chocolate,
and you spill the hot
chocolate on yourself,
and your kids cry.
It's really just magical.
- We have enough negativity
in today's vlog, Kendra.
(voices in the background)
-  Who's that?
We can go say hi.
-  Merry Christmas.
Hi, how are you doing?
(jingling bells)
- Is her eyes covered?
-  Ya (laughs).
Shes' totally covered.
There she is!
I think she was sleeping under there.
You drinkin' hot chocolate?
- Ya.
(background voices)
(singing "Dashing Through the Snow")
- That one!
-  Oh!
She likes that one!
-  We'll take it!
-  Ya!
-  Do you think
it'll fit in our house?
Where do we put it?
- This one!
-  Is that one just right?
- Ya!
-  Do you love it?
- I don't know!
This one!
-  That one?
- Ya.
-  Why do you like that one?
- This one.
-  This one?
- No, that one!
-  There's so many choices,
which one should we get?
Alright, we've narrowed
it down to two trees.
It's either gonna be this one,
or that one over there.
-  Hey guys, which one?
Let's let the kids vote!
-  Laura, what's your vote?
- That one!
-  Oh no!
It's a tie, Mom, you're the tie breaker.
-  That one!
- That was convenient.
- Dad, you can be the tie breaker.
(sawing)
-  There he is, manly man!
Cutting down the Christmas
tree for his fam.
("Oh Christmas Tree")
-  You picked one?
- We're going with shorty.
- We're debating, ya!
-  Shorty McGee.
- Took us a while, but we
found a good Christmas tree.
What should we name it guys?
Leaf?
- Ya, so our Christmas
tree's name is Leaf.
That was Elyse's idea.
(singing "Dashing Through the Snow")
- So we're heading home
from our family outing,
and I'm kind of reflecting
on the experience
in my mind, and,
it was not a picture perfect outing,
but there were beautiful moments,
and that's something that
I've been trying to learn
in motherhood, is that
it's not gonna be perfect,
but just because it's not perfect,
doesn't mean that there's
not magical moments in there,
and today the magical
moment that's gonna like,
live on in my mind,
is the singing the christmas
carols on the sleigh ride.
Like, that's beautiful,
like that's what wonderful
family memories are made of.
Look for the joy 'cause
the joys in the moments.
("Oh Come All Ye Faithful")
