-  Who's here?
- Daddy!
(screaming and laughter)
-  You watching your big brothers
goofing off on the other
side of that window?
Why do you think we're making a skeleton?
- Because it's almost Halloween.
(upbeat music)
Leese, what are we making today?
- A skeleton.
-  Oh, why do you
think we making a skeleton?
- Because it's almost Halloween.
- Time out, you guys
we finished the details
for our upcoming one million subscribers
service celebration and
we want you to come.
Come eat cake with us, dance with us,
serve with us, be in the vlog
and have a big party.
Bring your family and friends.
All of the details are
over on our Facebook page.
It's gonna be November
4th from two to four pm
at our church here in Kansas City.
We would love if you would RSVP.
If you're not local, we're gonna have ways
for you to participate as well.
So stay tuned, we're gonna
give more details about that.
We're partnering up with
Heart to Heart International
to make hygiene kits for people who have
been devastated in Puerto
Rico, like what's happening
in Texas and Florida and
California with the wildfires
so that people can be taken care of.
We can't wait for this coming up
and we'll have more
details about that party
as it gets closer, so stay tuned.
Time in.
-  We're going to
color it and then assemble it.
- There needs arms.
-  It needs arms?
I think the legs might
be a little bit long.
Caleb's working on the face.
Isaac, which part are you doing?
- The ribs.
-  Hey Laura,
what are you working on?
Hey the leg bone has a face.
Is it a girl skeleton?
-  Yeah.
We decided because there's
a lot of boy skeletons.
We wanted it to be different.
- So a friend of mine actually
made this project for us.
So all the parts are
cut out of paper plates
and then you tie it together with yarn.
- I learned in art
class that it's smoother
when you color in circles.
-  Show us what you mean.
- This is in circles
and that's in zig zags.
-  Got it, so it's
smoother to color in circles.
Somebody's making fussy sounds today.
What's up girlfriend?
- I made toenails.
- Jenae has had a fussy last little bit.
I'm hoping she's tired but she hasn't
been awake from her nap for long.
I've tried feeding her,
all the normal stuff.
- She's missing Dad.
-  Maybe she's missing Dad.
Luckily he'll be home soon.
He's gonna be able to see this.
You guys think you can finish
this before Dad gets home.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, everyone draw quick.
- So we're here at the airport
just finished _ Summit.
It's like five in the morning
and luckily Brent and my brother,
we're also here with Johnny from the _,
Davy from Eighth Row and _.
(rock music)
-  We're starting
to assemble the skeleton.
(guitar music)
You guys almost done?
- Yep.
- It actually looks like a skeleton
and it's about as big as me.
-  It is, it's
about as big as you.
Oh my goodness, you guys
that skeleton looks awesome.
- It looks pretty actually.
-  I really like it.
Who's coming home today?
- Dad.
-  We're getting our
chores done, hanging out.
Hi.
Good morning.
Caleb, what's for breakfast?
- Breakfast cake with yogurt.
-  I substituted some of the sugar
for some vanilla yogurt.
Hopefully it tastes good.
Oh my goodness, look at this girl.
You watching your big brothers
goofing off on the other
side of that window?
Say hi big brother.
Alright, today's the day.
Jeremy is coming home.
(techno music)
- While I was on the plane,
I was sitting next to Mickey.
We had a three hour flight
and I think I spent most of the time
being completely inspired by her.
She was sharing with me
experiences in her life where
God inspired her and
where miracles happened.
I'm super inspired, I was really touched.
- Thank you, it's a
pleasure meeting you too
and I'm inspired by what you do.
You stay encouraged.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- So it's just exciting how
you can meet total strangers,
know nothing about them and
they can change your life
forever for good.
Thank you for that Mickey.
- Mine too.
(techno music)
- When the baby's fussy, but
life still has to get done.
I usually just use this
carrier as a front carry,
but it's able to be used
as a back carry too.
I'm getting lunch ready right now
and I can't have Jenae
grabbing at all the food
and it's gonna be warmed up.
And I don't want her
to be by anything hot,
so we're doing the back right now.
Hi Sweet Pea.
Leftovers for lunch today.
They are chicken ranch enchiladas.
We tried them for the
first time last night
and they're pretty good.
- We need to name our skeleton.
-  We need to name our skeleton?
- Yeah.
-  What do you
think we should name it?
What do you think we should name it?
- The Creepiest Skeleton in the World.
- Girlnae.
-  Girlnae?
- Yeah.
- Girlnae.
- Instead of Jenae-nae,
we could do Skanae-nae.
Like a skeleton nae-nae.
- Scarenae-nae.
- Scarenae-nae.
My vote is Molly.
- Sounds like Mommy.
-  Oh no, let's
not do that one then.
- Girl Party.
-  Girl Party?
How about Mrs. Bones?
- Yeah.
Mrs. Bones.
- Alright, clearly
we're having a hard time
coming up with a name for the skeleton.
Please leave us your suggestions
in the comments below
and we will use one of those
for the skeleton's name.
- The other name was Pumpkin.
-  Pumpkin, that's
a fun name for a skeleton.
- Yep.
-  You hanging her up?
Have we decided on a name?
- Nope, not yet.
-  Maybe we'll let Dad choose..
- Yep-a-dee-dep.
-  Looks great.
- I'm the so glad when Dad comes home.
As glad as I can be.
I clap my hands and shout for joy
and climb up on his knee.
-  Who's here?
- Daddy!
(screams and laughter)
-  Oh guys, the door's locked.
Somebody has to go let him in.
There it is.
(screams and cheers)
- Get over here.
I missed you guys.
- I missed you too Dad.
- So good to see you.
Jenae,
hey, do you remember me?
-  Jenae, do you see Daddy?
- Hey, I missed you.
-  She's been a fussy guest today.
- Oh that's okay.
♫ I'm so glad when Daddy's home-
- It's good to be home.
♫ Glad as I can be
♫ I clap my hands and jump for joy
♫ And climb up on his knee
- You said you _ when you went to work.
- We made a skeleton.
- You did?
-  I made the hand.
- This is so cool.
-  Do you guys wanna tell him
the names we've been considering?
- Oh for the skeleton?
I was thinking about Herman.
(laughter)
-  It's a girl.
- Sherman.
-  That's not a girl's name.
- That's what you wanted to name Jenae.
- Sherman, that's right.
30 minutes later.
We're still snuggling.
(screams)
- Give me space, Jenae's like.
I think she got some hair in her face.
-  An hour later
and they're all still
within arms reach of Dad.
I think you were missed.
- How's that combing going Bud?
- Good.
- You combing?
-  Let's see it.
- Can I put some salt in it?
-  No, we're not
gonna put salt in our hair.
- This is the kiddos and
this is the Mom and Dad's.
-  Are you eating them?
(laughter)
- I'm the Mommy, I'm
the Mom in this family.
- There's the kiddos, can I have a kiddo?
-  This is a creepy game.
- Like Hansel and Gretel.
- I'm thinking today's probably one of
the last warmer days of the year.
So I left Laura come out
and play with the ice
because it's one of her favorite things.
You're melting your ice like a drink?
What are you guys playing?
- Football.
(calming music)
-  So close.
Today we are doing my absolute
favorite math lesson with Elise.
- Greater than and less than.
-  Alright,
introduce us to our friends.
- This is greater than
and this is less than.
-  Here's greater and less than.
- I made her teeth special.
-  You are an alligator,
which one of these piles
do you want to eat?
That one, so which one do you need?
Very nice.
-  One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.
-  Seven is greater than two.
Is that true?
- Yes.
-  Seven is greater than two.
- So do I eat them?
-  You get to
eat the less than pile.
Alright, which pile do you want
to eat if you're an alligator?
-  One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
-  How many are over here?
-  Four.
-  So which one does
the alligator want to eat.
- This, wait this is less than.
-  Correct, put it
on there and let's read it.
Say four
is less than 10.
We always read this direction.
It was like four is less than 10.
-  Six is less than eight.
-  Correct.
Laura showed up, she's
never far from marshmallows.
We're getting it.
You ready to start doing it on paper?
Without marshmallows?
-  11 is less than 21.
-  Good job.
Okay, let's do number five.
-  Oh, we're having
a marshmallow toss break.
(laughter)
Nailed it.
Did you get it?
Whoa!
Nice.
Okay you guys I'm gonna
throw it above the house.
I'm gonna throw the
marshmallow above the house
and catch it.
Here you wanna video it for me?
Don't worry about following
the marshmallow up okay.
Isaac, you make sure it
goes above the house.
-  Yep.
-  So close Dad.
Good job Dad.
- So the kids are all
having a friend over tonight
so we're doing pizza for dinner.
Laura requested candy, but no.
We'll just do pizza.
(upbeat music)
I'm cooking up the pizza,
our house is now full of kids
and fun.
I really, really love when
the kids have friends over
and they're all playing so nicely.
It's just the best.
It's like this happy kind of chaos running
around my house.
They're playing all sorts
of different things.
I see a crochet game,
there's been some soccer,
some football playing,
there's playing house,
there's jumping on the
trampoline, everything.
- So we're making eggs.
-  You're making eggs.

-  So ice and eggs, yummy.
- For dinner.
(guitar music)
- And yes, I already stole a slice.
I couldn't wait, I'm hungry.
Let's eat.
(guitar music)
- Kendra and I were inside
and we see Lydia and Laura
like sitting down like
they're watching the kids
on the trampoline.
We thought that was pretty funny.
(giggles)
Are you girls watching them?
- Yep.
- Goodnight, J House out.
I love watermelon.
