(light playful music)
-  'Cause you put
those in the washing machine.
- Oh.
- And then Daddy made the fatal error of
putting stuff in the washing
machine and starting it
without checking it first.
- And, what is in here?
- It's a bunch of pieces
of paper that got washed.
Anyway, moral of the story:
if you have a toddler and
a front-loading machine, always
check the washing machine
before running a load of something.
(children shouting)
- Good job, good job.
- Kick, kick, kick.
Go, Elise.
Go, Joshua.
Go, Kaylee.
Good job, yay!
(boy screaming and clapping)
-  On three,
we're gonna do 'Thunder'.
-  One, two, three, Thunder.
- Alright, good job, you guys.
(overlapping chatter,
children screaming, clapping)
Good job, big girl.
Can I get a hug?
I love you.
- Wait, I need a picture.
- Picture.
Thought that this would
be good for our kids
to look back on the vlog and
hear more about our story
of how we met, how we fell in love--
- Awwww.
- And all of that stuff.
(Jeremy laughs)
- So, we wanted to give
another story from our past.
- Our apartment complex held
a dance the last weekend
of May, on a Saturday night,
and we were both there.
And Jeremy is a mighty fine dancer.
- Well I mean, they've seen
these moves already on the vlog.
(classical opera music)
- Anyway, so he definitely
caught my eye at the dance.
- Kendra, she had these pants on,
she looked really good.
It was really, she was really--
- Guys, I was wearing pants
and that's what it takes.
I looked incredible.
- She looked really good.
Like, I remember the
outfit she was wearing
so she just looked really cute.
- Oh, so he asked me to
dance, but only one dance
and I remember kind of
feeling jibbed about that.
- Like, come on.
- It was very intentional.
- You should dance with me more.
He was, not in like a player
way at all, but just in a
super-friendly way, he was
dancing with everybody and
so I kind of was bummed.
I kind of wanted some special treatment.
I mean, come on.
Like, notice me.
- If I would have noticed
her and given her the special
treatment, she would not have
paid attention to me, so.
- You know how it goes.
- Anyway.
- The dance had ended at
midnight and we were about ready
to part to go our separate ways.
Jeremy lived on the third floor
and I lived on the first floor
of the apartment complex.
So we were about ready to part
our ways and I was asking him
if there was any chance he
was headed down to Arizona
anytime soon, and--
- But I wasn't.
- And that's kind of how, I
was looking for a ride to go
visit my family over a long
weekend that was coming up and--
- At least that was what she was claiming.
- That was legitimately
what I was looking--
Anyway, so we started talking
and he just super-easy
to talk to and conversation
flowed really easily and
we ended up standing outside
of the door of my apartment
and just chatting for a few minutes.
And I looked around
after a few minutes and
it looked like everybody
else had kind of gone inside
and I was like, "It must be getting later.
So it was good to say
hi. Well, see ya later."
So I went inside and my jaw dropped.
It was 4:00 AM.
We had stood on my doorstep
and talked for four hours
and it literally had felt
like maybe 15, 20 minutes.
And I walk into my bedroom
and my roommate kind of
rolled over and she's like, "What?
Where were you?"
And I told her I was
outside talking to Jeremy.
And then, the next words, which
I would always remember is,
what I said to my roommate was,
"Man, forever with that guy
would go really quickly."
- So now, we get to be
up at 3:00 and 4:00 AM--
-  Every night.
- With our babies.
- But, it feels like 12:30 PM.
- Yeah.
- So what were your thought after that
stay up 'til 4:00 AM talking?
- I was happy that things had progressed.
I thought you were beautiful
and it was good to get to
know you and it was fun to talk
to you and I could see that
we had a lot of the same
interests of what we wanted.
'Cause we were already talking about
what we wanted out of life.
We were having some deep, connecting,
philosophical-type conversations.
- If you know this guy, it
doesn't take long to get to--
- Deep conversations.
- It wasn't--
- It wasn't just surface-level discussion.
Like, we were getting into
some meaty stuff and so
I was impressed with who she
was and I was excited to build
that friendship and...
- It was good.
- So that was our first dance.
- Our first dance.
