- You know those sick days
when holding your head up off the pillow
is absolutely exhausting.
- Good morning.
So little Jennay and Kendra
are feeling very sick this morning.
- A tired and sick mom laying on the floor
next to baby playing.
It's like a classic right
of passage of motherhood,
like every mother has been
here taking two second naps
on the floor next to their baby.
This little girl is playing
so contently right now.
How's the toy game going on?
I swear her hair looks longer today.
- So I made a family.
-  That's a family?
- Mm hm.
-  Tell me about them.
- So this is the teenager.
This the mom.
This is the dad.
And this is the baby.
She's about three months old.
And this one's about like my age.
So yeah.
-  So what's this?
- This is the campfire,
and they're roasting marshmallows.
-  How fun.
(inaudible)
- Oh.
- Ready.
- Whoa.
-  Buddy, you're
still in your pajamas.
- I know, I'm fine.
- Yeah me too.
-  But you haven't
done your chores yet.
- We know.
-  We can come and jump on the tramp
after our chores are done.
Come on inside.
Caleb, your chore today is the dishes.
- What's mine?
-  You need to help
clean up the front room.
So I'm back at the store because Kendra
had several things that
she wanted us to pick up
because she was feeling sick.
So I just got a text from Kendra
saying that she's feeling worse.
More of a fever, she's having chills.
So hopefully this soup
and stuff will help.
(banging)
- We're playing football.
-  It's in overtime right now?
(laughter)
Next score wins.
You've been touched, he got you.
(laughter)
So we're at the library
again for Elise's tutoring.
We're so proud of how
hard Elise is working
to try to master reading.
It's hard for her with the dyslexia.
- I'm very sad for Mom
and I hope Mom feels better pretty soon.
-  Hey.
- She's pretty excited to see you guys.
But I think I'm more excited.
- Hi.
- She says mom's been boring.
Mom just sits here.
-  Are the boys outside?
Not quite. (laughing)
So it's step in front.
And then behind.
And then in front.
And then behind.
There you go.
What are you training for?
- I don't know.
Being in the NFL?
-  Yep, if you're going
to be in the NFL someday,
you're going to have to get
really good at these drills.
So Isaac talks a lot about how he dreams
of someday playing in the NFL.
And it's so hard, because
I know that I've given him
pretty lame genetics for that goal.
He's going to be small, short,
and probably not the fastest guy,
but I love that Isaac wants
to keep that dream alive,
and keep trying and
practicing and doing drills
and trying to get better and better.
As a father I want to encourage
him to chase his dreams,
but I do also try to help
him find those things that
suit what he has been
naturally given as gifts.
(soothing music)
The human body is amazing.
So when a mom is sick, her
body sends stuff into the milk,
that the baby's going to drink,
that helps the baby fight
against the sickness.
Just think of how amazing that is.
Like that's a crazy super power.
She's almost asleep.
- Isaac that's a big one.
Don't they smell good guys?
So Jeremy's on a business call.
And Jennay is sleeping
and so the kids are
having a snack outside.
Oranges, gotta boost up the Vitamin C,
so nobody else gets sick.
(laughter)
- Look how big I got mine.
-  Yeah, thanks for
helping her out Isaac.
Hey question, is the orange
pretty sweet or is it sour?
- Sweet.
- It's sweet.
- That is a really good mix.
-  A little bit sour for you?
She's finishing up her math.
Elise is almost done with her math book.
I'm so proud of her, she's
been working really hard.
We just ordered her next book,
it should be here any day.
She's only got two more lessons
and then she's ready for it.
How are you feeling about
subtraction and addition?
- Easy.
I think subtraction is actually easier.
- I think it's because
you nailed addition first.
You really understood it.
You know those sick days
when holding your head up off the pillow
is absolutely exhausting,
I'm like oh, I'm tired.
Like it's just, it's just funny.
Today makes me so grateful
for how healthy I usually am
and I'm just hydrating and trying to rest
and Jeremy's being amazing
and taking care of me.
He is working at the moment
while the little girls nap.
So we're doing some math.
I did some school work
with the boys earlier.
It's nice even from laying on the couch
we can get school done.
Home school's pretty flexible.
-  Where we going?
- Gymnastics.
(peppy music)
What was that?
- Dad there's a sunset.
-  Isn't it pretty?
- Yeah.
-  I love sunsets.
- So a sweet friend of
mine just stopped by
and brought us dinner.
She heard that I was sick.
I have no idea how she
heard that I was sick.
I got a text from her about 30 minutes ago
and she said I'm bringing dinner by
and I was completely surprised
and just so grateful.
It's a really great feeling
to eat home cooked food
when you're not feeling well.
So look what she brought.
This is a cheesy rice, chicken casserole.
I already dug in and ate
some and it's so good.
And some salad.
Broccoli.
And chocolate cookies.
The kids, Jeremy and I all are
going to enjoy this so much.
I already did.
It's really humbling sometimes
to be on the receiving act of service.
I'm more comfortable
sometimes taking people dinner
than receiving it, but it was
really, really thoughtful,
and yummy and delicious.
Thank you.
-  Aren't we so lucky
that someone brought us dinner?
- It is delicious.
-  It is.
So, are you feeling any better?
- Um, I feel a little better
than I did this morning.
It's probably mostly because I'm in my bed
and I know I get to sleep
for the next few hours.
But I'm hopeful that I'll
feel better tomorrow.
- Have you told everyone
about your special blanket?
- This is my weighted blanket.
- It's like 40 pounds.
How heavy is it?
- It's not 40 pounds.
- It feels like it.
- It's 15 pounds and it's
supposed to help with anxiety.
And I love it.
It feels like a nice hug.
- Huge blanket.
- I love it.
So I sleep with my weighted blanket on me.
- I hope you feel better.
- Me too.
And I hope all the kids
and you stay healthy.
Good night.
J-House Out.
(laughter)
- Laura's instructions exactly.
