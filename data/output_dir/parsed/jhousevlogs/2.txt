- This one's gonna be perfect!
Wah-ha-ha-ha!
(Disco music)
-  How'd it turn out?
- Really good.
(Disco music)
-  Good morning.
- Good morning.
-  Time for breakfast.
It's time for breakfast,
big girl. Come on.
(Acoustic music)
- Whoopsie daisy!
-  Did you spill some?
What are you doing Kalen?
- I'm putting this up.
-  Dude, this is awesome!
- There's four rooms
for all the four kids.
-  You were awake
before anybody else.
- I know.
-  And you're just building?
- Yep.
-  Hey buddy, let's
go eat some breakfast.
- Okay.
-  You excited about school today?
- Uh-huh!
-  So why are you all dressed up?
- Because at school it's dress up day
for the kindergarteners.
-  What are you dressing up as?
- Thing one.
-  Is this from Doctor Seuss?
- Yep!
(Happy music)
-  Hey! Did you wake up happy?
She's off!
(baby laughs)
-  Hop in!
-  Do you you see who it is?
- No!
-  I see aunt Ashley!
- Michael!
-  Yeah, we're coming to play
with Michael and Elizabeth today!
- Yay!
- So after we dropped off
the big kids at school today,
I'm taking Laura and Janae
to a really fun place
called paradise park. Are you excited?
- (giggles) Michael's here!
- Our cousin-friend, that's the best kind!
Here's the funny thing, I didn't
look at what time it opens,
so we're here early, so we
have 15 minutes to just wait.
Hi!
-  There's Michael!
We're gonna have a dance
party to kill the time.
(Music)
You seem them out there? Wow!
So come on in!
(Music and kids screaming)
(Laughing)
-  Good morning Elizabeth!
-  Oh, yeah! (laughing)
-  Hey Laura!
(Cheerful music)
-  How's the ball pit?
(Child screams)
-  Are the balls
dropping from the ceiling?
(Cheerful music)
-  Janea, there's so many new things
to make messes with!
Are you dancing?
- Here you go!
- Thanks!
(Jazz music)
-  Oh, thank you! That's a great one!
Let's see what you got.
Did you get me some bread?
Mmm, bread.
(Children talking)
(Tropical Music)
-  Janea just splashed
herself, she's so confused.
You got it!
What is going on?
What is that?
- Turtle!
(Motorboat noise)
-  So Janea loves this
and keeps splashing herself.
What's going on?
Are you okay?
(Splashing)
(Baby laughs)
-  What did you make
for us? You made pizza?
- Uh huh.
-  What did you
make? Can you say a mess?
(Plates falling)
Crash!
That makes a loud noise.
Did you find a piece?
Are you gonna serves some over here?
Good job Miss Janae! (Laughs)
Laura found the face paint.
(Silly music)
- Is that okay?
-  Yup.
Nice!
We had a great time
playing with our cousins.
We came full circle, we
started in the ball pit
and now we are ending in the ball pit.
This is a place I'd come when
the big kids were little.
But I haven't brought the little girls,
so it's kind of fun to relive
those moments with them.
-  Alright, everyone.
Grab an egg and dry it off.
And get ready to color it.
(Funky music)
-  Sorry Isaac,
this is the only apron
we have for you, bud.
Smell what I put in the bowls.
What does it smell like?
- Vinegar!
-  It's pretty strong huh?
- It looks like water.
-  It does, but
it smells like Easter.
- Whoa!
-  Isn't that fun?
Okay, Laura, go ahead.
- That is mesmerizing.
-  It is quite fun.
What color is that one?
- Green.
- It's blue.
-  If you want to,
you can use a crayon
and color on your egg
before you start dying it,
it's your choice. Go
ahead, you guys can start.
You can do whatever
you want with your egg.
(Hip-hop music)
-  I actually
want a plain yellow one.
(Hip-hop music)
-  Hmm, Laura, I love this one.
- Thanks. I made it for you, daddy.
-  Thank you!
What happens when you mix those two?
That's pretty.
- I'm doing red and blue. As a mix.
- I love mine!
-  Isn't that fun to
be creative and make stuff?
How'd it turn out?
- Really good.
-  You got a football?
- Uh huh.
- You're doing my orange?
- How can Laura do this?
-  Isn't it amazing?
-  Yes!
-  It was by doing
it in two different colors
and it just turned out that way.
She's an egg designing protege.
- I'm gonna do the, mix
yellow and green together.
-  Oh, cool.
Alright, Elise is wanting
to do one more color.
So Kendra picked these out
and I wanted to give it a try.
You're supposed to be
able to paint the eggs.
You guys want to see if it works?
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna do one.
- So if I snap this, oops!
I don't know if I was
supposed to snap it that much,
but now I can paint with this.
(Funky music)
I have it like this now I'm gonna try
to stick it in the orange.
-  Oh!
Got in my eye.
Got it on your face!
Got it on the camera!
- Laura tried to dry
it off when it was wet
and now it looks super cool
and now she wants to paint the top.
-  Alright, let's paint on it.
Here you go.
(Classical music)
- This one's gonna be perfect.
Wah-ha-ha-ha!
- Whoa, Elise! Elise's is good.
-  I love the drawing that you did.
That's, like, perfect.
Did your hands get dirty?
- Yep.
-  Laura, let's see your
hands. A little bit dirty.
-  Good night. J House out.
-  April Fools!
- Okay, for this next prank,
I'm gonna have Isaac
and Elise help me out.
