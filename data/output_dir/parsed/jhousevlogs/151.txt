-  Two.
(gasps)
-  Two boxes.
- I'm excited about both of these.
-  I know.
I'm so sorry buddy.
- I did it, I did it, I did it.
I figured it out.
I know the answer, and
Jeremy doesn't bahaha.
(lively music)
- The toothpaste is all dirty.
-  How does that even happen?
What do you got your backpack on for?
- For the trip.
-  What trip?
- I don't know.
-  Are we going
on a field trip today?
- Yeah.
(running water)
(piano playing)
♫ I'll be there to save the day
♫ Superman's got nothing on me
♫ I'm only one call away
- I'm gonna keep working.
- So today we are going
on our first field trip
of the homeschool year,
and since we've been studying
Oregon Trail so much,
we found out that there's
actually a national trails museum
right here in the Kansas City area,
so we're going there to check it out.
(upbeat music)
- Well we drove out here
to where we're doing
the field trip and Caleb
just isn't feeling very well.
We're not sure what's going on.
- So he has no fever,
he ate well this morning,
he did his chores,
and was running around
and then all of a sudden,
he's not feeling good.
So we'll see how long
this field trip lasts.
We might have to cut it short.
(bright country music)
- I love mink.
- A squirrel.
-  Is it a squirrel?
-  That's a big squirrel.
-  That one's called a beaver.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- And we're walking and
walking and walking.
- Here's St. Louis and
here's Independence,
and then here's where the
trails went from there.
You could come down here
to Santa Fe, New Mexico.
-  Cub is not feeling good.
I'm so sorry buddy.
- Well this isn't
exactly going as planned.
The museum is lovely,
but Jeremy is with Caleb in the restroom,
which means I've got to
get all the other kids
and this little peanut is excited
to not hold still or cooperate.
This is one of those moments as a mom,
when you're like, do we just bail?
Do we just say, you know what,
well do this another day,
let's go home.
Or do we push through.
(jangly uptempo music)
Okay here are the rules,
you guys get to fill up your wagon,
packing it with what you think you need,
and then you're gonna
see if it's too heavy.
-  If they go
over the weight limit,
this light will turn red.
- Rice is good.
-  Load up the wagon.
-  Dried apples or dried peaches?
- We need a lot of flour.
Two things of water.
-  Let's see what happens.
(record scratching)
- Red.
- And orange.
Yeah, we don't need that.
It's just because it's
(record scratching)
(yelling)
- It's too heavy.
We need to take out a few things,
like one bed roll,
um where's the canteen oil.
That's the gunpower, we need that.
- Yeah, we need gunpowder.
-  It's still on.
- It's off!
I think this is good enough.
(tropical beat music)
- So they used all the
parts of the buffalo,
when they shot and killed the buffalo.
These were the buffalo bladders.
And it said, buffalo
bladders like this one
often became canteens for water.
- What are buffalo bladders?
- It's the part of the buffalo
that holds their pee.
- Is it buffalo poop?
-  Buffalo poop they used to cook.
(wheel turning)
Make it to the gold fields,
but die in an accident.
(wheel turning)
-  What's he gonna get?
-  Aww, you found gold,
but lost it all gambling.
-  You and Elise did it together.
(wheel turning)
Janae loves it.
- Janae likes the toy.
Okay, this one'll be for Dad.
-  What's gonna happen to me?
- Aww.
-  What happened?
- You found gold,
but just enough to meet expenses.
Guys I'm our last chance.
-  Wait, is there one
on here where you can get it?
- Yeah, you get filthy rich.
-  Filthy rich, can Mom do it?
(wheel turning)
What happened?
- I found gold, but other miners stole it.
Oh what happened to Janae?
- The California gold rush
was not good for our family.
Let's press on.
(bright guitar music)
- Do we want the mule or the oxen?
- Oxen.
- Oxen.
- Well let's listen to the pros and cons.
So for the mules, they
pull faster than oxen.
They can be trained in a short time.
They're stronger, they
ate less than horses.
There we go Isaac for the ox.
Alright Elise, mule or ox?
- But these eat less.
- So all the boys voted for oxen,
All the girls voted for mules.
- I want to get there fast,
that was my primary motivation.
So this is a very famous picture
their shaking hands,
because they're connecting one side
of the country's railroad,
with the other side of
the country's railroad.
So that now people could
go straight across.
-  These are buffalo chips.
- So the gift shop has
buffalo chip Frisbee's.
- I didn't realize they were
Frisbee's, that's awesome.
- Yeah that is.
I'm glad Caleb seems to be feeling better.
- We're getting ready
to go on a wagon ride,
we're just waiting on
the wagon to get here.
(epic pioneer music)
(laughing)
(playful babbling)
(horses clip clopping)
(laughing)
- Are we going to die?
-  Are we gonna die on the wagon?
Nope, this one's just for fun.
- This one's just a little short ride,
like we're just gonna go
around the town a little bit,
so we can see what it feels
like to be in a wagon.
- Whoa Bill, we have some
rough enough pioneers here?
-  Yep.
-  Climb in
pioneers, around the back,
the trips only gonna take
us five and a half miles.
- Oh goodie.
- Okay.
-  This is the original motor home
right here, young'uns.
Come on up here so I can
tell you a tall tale.
- Wagons ho.
-  Are we going fast?
-  Yeah Bill, giddyup yup.
- This is right where the wagons went.
-  What do you want
to do when you grow up?
- I don't know yet.
-  You don't know yet?
Well you gotta find a dream,
do you know why you do?
- One time, one time I had a scary dream.
- Did you have a scary dream?
(laughing)
Yeah well we're not
talking about those kind.
You gotta find a dream,
because without a dream,
nobody can help you.
Children, you gotta find
something you're passionate about,
or called to and go after it.
That is what made our nation great,
people that followed their dreams.
-  Do you guys see that,
the mules have diapers?
They have poop bags.
-  Yeah, those are
actually where I keep my M & M's.
-  One, two, three.
(camera snaps)
(lively guitar music)
Oh.
-  Here it comes.
- It's going faster.
-  It's going
through another tunnel.
There it goes.
- Did you guys see these?
These are telegraphs.
- Let me show you how one works.
See this one's hooked up,
and they used to send messages.
They didn't have telephones
back in those days.
- One after another,
the laden wagons rolled
from the crowded square
We're headed out to find
the real wagon ruts.
They're called wagon swales,
because they've been grassed over,
but they're supposed to be
right here on this property.
I don't know why that's so cool to me.
It's just crazy to think 170 years ago,
what was happening right here.
Basically I'm a history nerd.
- I'm amazed with how fast
our technology's changing.
Like I think it's important for our kids
to see what happened and to
learn the lessons from history.
We shouldn't forget.
We should remember these things
and learn from them.
- Things that helped shape our country.
- Yeah.
- In and out of town,
the heavy and continuous
wagon traffic left its mark.
So right there, if there was a wagon
it would've been going up.
- Wagons ho!
- So on the way home, we found this park
that we wanted to stop at
and play with the kids.
(bright music)
(yelling)
- Whoa.
(clanking metal)
- See if you can recognize this song.
(playing xylophone)
(Janae cooing)
(playing xylophone)
(lively music)
(yelling)
(Kendra laughs)
- She likes when I whistle.
(whistling)
-  She likes
that you're feeding her.
Elise likes to feed Janae
and Janae likes to be fed by Elise.
- That's all.
(yelling)
- So we're eating lunch as a family
and we're playing Scrabble
that is on the back of our Cheez-It box.
So check it out, these
words are scrambled up.
And we figured out all of them,
except for the first one,
and we cannot figure it out.
It's funny when I got the ones
on the bottom, it's like
you feel so accomplished,
you're like yeah, I figured it out,
and then I can't figure out the top one
and I'm like, oh.
Any luck boys?
- I think that's rotator.
- Did we crack the code?
-  Okay, so what's this one?
-  Toy.
Boat.
Jump.
Play.
-  Jeremy and
I both know this one,
the boys haven't figured it out yet.
But Jeremy and I cannot
figure out this one.
What is it?
Do you guys like word games like this?
I really enjoy them,
until they drive me crazy
because I can't figure them out.
Jeremy's getting serious about this.
- It's wierd that there's
just a U and an E.
This is rough.
Wait, I gotta figure this out.
-  Oh man, we're
gonna feel so silly
when we discover it,
because it can't be that hard of a word.
It's on a Scrabble Junior box.
I did it, I did it, I figured it out.
I know the answer and
Jeremy doesn't ba ha ha.
I literally was like screaming
and jumping up and down,
when all of a sudden I saw it.
I was like, I know the word!
- Lutter?
Like butter, but with an L.
Ret letru
(laughing)
There's two T's an R and an L.
-  This is hard, huh.
(laughing)
Isaac got it.
- He said it loud,
so I only had to feel the shame
of not figure it out.
-  What's the word?
- Turtle.
- Turtle!
- Turtle!
-  Kendra did you
see what just arrived?
Two.
(gasps)
Two boxes.
- I'm so excited about both of these.
-  I know.
- This is the best mail day ever.
Okay, so one of those is
going to be our new bench
that is going to change our kitchen table.
I'm so excited,
and the other is my Stitch Fix,
which you guys don't know what that is,
but it is a box of new clothes for Mommy.
-  Not sponsored.
- Not sponsored at all,
I'm just so excited to try it.
New clothes without shopping, I'm in.
Caleb, I have some bad news.
We have to build the bench.
It doesn't come already put together,
so we have to open the box and build it.
- We're gonna need someone who
can put it together for us.
- Ahhh.
(laughing)
- How tall is it?
-  It's the
right size for a bench.
-  To go to our
table, our kitchen table.
So we were considering
getting a new kitchen table,
'cause now we have more than six of us
in the family,
then we realized we
could just get a bench.
Kendra found a bench for
like 58 or $60 dollars?
-  Yeah.
- Problem solved.
- Yeah.
So now we can have three kids
sitting on the bench and it'll fit.
It's funny the things
you get excited about
when you're a mom.
Like I'm so excited
about this kitchen bench.
Woo!
What are we having for dinner?
- Pancakes.
(jazzy upbeat music)
- So last month, I got into a bad habit
of us eating out more.
I just was having a hard
time with meal planning
and grocery shopping
and it just felt easier and simpler,
but I'm working really hard on that,
and so I've been trying
really hard to plan ahead,
but I don't always do that,
so I always have some back ups,
super fast meals that I just know,
if I forget to plan ahead,
I can do last minute.
Like tonight, so we're doing pancakes.
Which I know is not super healthy
or an amazing dinner at all,
but it works, and I can get it
on the table in like 15 minutes,
and my kids actually eat it really well.
So pancakes for dinner it is.
♫ The sun and the rain and the apple seeds
♫ The Lord's been good to me
♫ Dun dun dun
- So when I'm feeding a lot of the kids
something like pancakes or waffles
or anything that takes
individual preparation
for each one, I tend to
just use a Tupperware,
rip it all up, stick the
syrup and peanut butter
or whatever I want, inside the Tupperware,
shake it up and then it's ready to go
for everyone all at once.
(uptempo dance music)
Is it good?
- So during Janae's nap,
I opened my Stitch Fix box
and I tried on the
clothes that came in it.
While I really liked some pieces,
other pieces are just okay,
and overall, they were
all just much pricier,
than the clothes that I usually buy.
So I'm glad I tried it.
I'm definitely going to try it again,
but I don't know if this is gonna be
a long term solution for me,
just because of how
cheap I am about clothes.
(laughing)
-  Lise, you
getting ready for ballet.
- Yeah.
-  Goodnight, J House out.
- Good morning friends,
three years ago today,
September 18th, 2014,
was the first time we ever
posted a J House vlog,
so I'm gonna put in the description box
some of our favorite vlogs over the years
and I'm gonna start today's
video with our original intro.
