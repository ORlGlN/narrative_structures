- Good morning.
Alright so I've got a
little pimple right there.
Trying to decide if I
should pop it or not.
Normally I do but I don't
know that that always helps.
Cause then like, 30 minutes later
it'll still be pestulating.
And I'll be at a meeting or something.
Anyway, so I think I'm going
to try to just leave it.
And I know that that's annoying.
People are going to
look at it and be like,
"I want to pop it."
Are you one of those people where you like
want to pop other people?
Anyway.
So, sorry about that.
It's there today.
Hopefully it goes away soon.
(upbeat music)
(children giggling and playing)
- We're doing the jump challenge.
- I don't know what they're
doing downstairs but I guess
they're doing the jump challenge.
(upbeat hip-hop music)
(children shouting)
He hit his head really hard.
Like, I could hear that.
But he's just laughing so
we're just going to go with it.
We'll check his pupils afterwards.
We have been chatting for over an hour.
Because these guys are awesome
with the Canadian Family Vlog.
There it is.
- And then you guys are just like.
(laughing)
- Yes, you guys should go to
their channel, they're awesome.
We love the Canadian Family Vlog.
- Just what you all wanted,
an update on Jeremy's adult acne.
(laughing)
- I thought when I grew up
the pimples would go away.
- Sweetheart, but your
hormones didn't go away either.
(smooching)
- That's for sure.
(laughing)
- Take good care of it.
Aw, I didn't think we were in the camera.
- Kendra and her filling.
(laughing)
Hey you guys.
- Alright so the topic
of discussion tonight is.
- Should we have another baby?
- It's honestly something
we're really talking about.
Our kids are all about two years apart.
And so, when a baby turns
one, is when we talk about
"Hey, should we have another baby?"
And so far the answer's always been, yes!
And Laura's getting older,
she's like 10 months old.
- Okay, I'm honestly a little bit scared.
Like it's so overwhelming, and.
- Our four keep us very busy.
- You know you have the
little babies and then,
but they keep getting bigger and older,
and complex issues and
I'm just nervous about
getting in over our head.
We both are really close to our siblings.
And they're some of our best friends.
And we want to give that to our kids.
- And we both come from big families.
So I come from a family of four,
he comes from a family of six or 18.
- That's not a joke.
I'll tell you about it another time soon.
(laughing)
- So, we both come from big families.
Like when we were dating
and engaged, it was like
oh we're going to have a big family.
I think we both figured like
six, eight, something big.
- Yeah I always was like,
"Why would I have less than six kids?"
and it's funny now you know,
growing up and having my own
it's like, "Maybe four
is a really good number."
- We have two boys, two
girls, it's perfect.
And we love them, like they're so fun.
And they also exhaust us.
- Since we've has Isaac,
so that was six years ago.
- There hasn't been a break
in nursing and pregnancy and,
- Diapers.
- We've had two in diapers
over and over again.
- You know,
putting into the car seats.
And again, we really aren't
wanting sound complaining.
- We're go grateful for our kids.
- We struggled with
infertility for a couple years
before having Isaac.
And so we realize that
any time you have a baby
it's beautiful.
- And our kids are
such a wonderful blessing.
- I just want to make sure than
I can coach each of my kids
and have enough one-on-one time.
And so making a decision for
what's best for the family
is tough because any time you
bring a child into the family
it seems like that.
- It's a big blessing
like it's going to be,
- A miracle.
- a great thing.
- But,
- We also want to be really
deliberate about it.
- I don't want to take away
from the other kids.
- Doesn't it also sound like so much fun
to have another little tiny one
that just, like lays on your shoulder
and is so cute?
- But that little tiny one
could grow up to be a Caleb.
- So I have, we love Caleb by the way.
- But the baby could turn into a Caleb.
(laughing)
- So adorableness.
That's what you're scared of.
You are frightened by adorableness.
So we want to make sure that each child,
like we're able to not only
fulfill their physical needs,
but their spiritual and emotional needs.
And make sure that they
have the one-on-one time
that they need with us.
- Well and our marriage
to make sure that it's
not being, you know.
- Stretched so thin.
- And what our family
goals are and our dreams
of what it is we want
to do with our family.
- There's so much to consider.
- So much to consider.
- Like really up until
this point it's been like,
"Yeah we want to have another baby,
"we want to have another baby."
And I love babies.
I'm like permanently baby-hungry.
Obviously it's going to
come down to a decision
between Jeremy and I.
And a prayerful decision that we feel like
God knows what's best for our family.
And that's why, like,
we totally don't judge.
Like you have one kid, you
have 20 kids, that's awesome.
That's great, we're just
trying to figure out
what's right for our family.
And we honestly don't know
what's right for our family right now.
- Yeah, so we'll be thinking about it,
and discussing it and praying about it.
And we'll keep you posted.
