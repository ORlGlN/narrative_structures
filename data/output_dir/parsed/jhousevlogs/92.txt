-  She broke her leg.
- Mmm-mmm.
(lively music)
-  You have to go to surgery?
- Oh, we forgot to put you asleep.
- Good job.
- And I can't find it
and it makes me mad.
(enchanting music)
(Janae babbling)
-  So how did
you two sleep last night?
- Good.
-  Did you have
any good dreams Laura?
- I always have the best dreams.
-  Is this your
hairdo for this morning?
Can you turn around, so I can see it?
- Her friend Lucy had this hairdo
and she wanted it just like Lucy.
We're just resurrecting
Lucy's curls from last night.
- Yeah.
I like curls.
(playing "Away in a Manger")
- I love piano lessons this time of year,
because the kids are all
learning Christmas songs.
Good sharing.
(piano playing)
That looks pretty fun.
Are you happy with that little piece?
Does your Mr. Potato
Head have a lot of hands?
Whoa, that is an awesome design.
How many hands does he have?
- Two three four.
-  Four hands?
- One two.
- That's a cool Mr. Potato Man.
Can you make that face?
Okay Janae update,
she is now nine months old.
How is that even possible?
She is crawling all over,
pulling herself up to a stand,
she says hi Dada and she says mmmuh,
when she wants me.
She's adorable.
And we love her.
- Keep going.
(piano playing)
♪ Peace ♪
Good job.
♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪
Good job.
(hand slap)
-  She broke her leg?
(playful music)
- Mmm-hmm.
- For pretend.
-  Oh, just for pretend?
-  Uh-huh.
-  This is quite the cast.
How are you feelin'?
- A little bit sick.
- A little bit sick.
- We're just pretending.
-  Oh good, I'm
glad it's just pretending
and you're really okay.
Who's your doctor?
- I am.
And I'm trying to find as much things
on the computer as we can.
Caleb's our helper.
-  How are things on
the computer gonna help her
fix her broken foot?
- We bought hamburgers
and banana splits,
(Kendra laughs)
with no bananas of course,
and an elephant and it's gonna come here
in one minute.
-  And how's that
gonna help her broken foot?
- Well the cast will.
Since she can't get up,
we're bringing her food.
- I'm checking her bones
and seeing if it's okay right now.
-  Oh are you looking at an x-ray?
Well get well soon little girl.
- Okay, I have this to remember.
-  Oh, Caleb made that, huh?
Are you signing her cast?
- I just do hearts.
-  There we go.
Isaac, do you want to sign her cast?
Janae wants to sign her cast.
Did you find the problem?
- Yep.
-  It's just she rolled her ankle
all the way to the other side of her foot,
so then it cracked.
-  Whoa, can I see the crack?
Whoa.
Uh-oh.
Nae are you trying to get it.
(Janae shrieks)
She says I want to play.
(Janae laughing)
This is really nice, can I sign your cast?
- Sure.
- Mom.
-  That looks like a W.
-  It does, because
you guys are upside down.
-  Hi.
- Write Janae.
-  Hi, look at that little hand.
-  Time for surgery.
- Whoa, you have to go to surgery?
Good luck, I hope you survive.
- Because we're considered
the best doctors ever.
-  Oh, you guys
are the best doctors ever?
- Yep.
-  Alright,
good luck with surgery.
(playful suspenseful music)
How's the surgery going?
- It's super bad.
Does this hurt?
- My job is to look at it
and see if she's good or not.
-  So then who's the surgeon?
- I am.
I'm the nurse.
-  The nurse?
Are you also the surgeon?
- Yeah.
-  Does this hurt?
- Yeah.
- Okay, so I think it's like right there.
(Kendra laughs)
- Oh, we forgot to put you asleep.
We cut it open.
-  You cut it open?
- Uh-huh.
(Kendra gasps)
-  Eww.
Now you're taking
pictures like ultra sounds
and x-rays and things?
- Uh-huh.
-  How are you doing?
- The bone is twisted.
- Are you holding up okay?
- The bone is twisted totally.
-  You're doing really
well for your surgery, Laura.
Are you being so brave?
- Check her other foot.
I think her, hey does that hurt?
- Let me put you back together.
- Oh that, this one hurts she says.
Let me look at it.
-  This one is also cracked?
Oh dear.
- This one says that it's broke.
- I love seeing the kids playing pretend.
- I think she might have brain problems.
- What?
Okay, let me check.
-  You have brain problems?
- I think it's probably a bad headache.
- The confirmation is that you might have
to stay in the hospital for
about 10 weeks or a year.
Six years.
-  Whoa, this is
getting worse by the moment.
- Now it's my turn.
- Until she's six.
- So they said there might be
something wrong with your brain.
- I know.
I'm just sick for pretend.
- For sure, for sure just pretend.
Really you're healthy, huh?
I'm so grateful you're really healthy.
Yay!
- The brain problem was
actually not that bad,
because you know, only
when she's four years old,
it will stop.
- Oh good.
So we're finishing a family
read-a-loud during lunch time.
I love reading to my
kids during lunch time,
because they're quiet and
they're a captive audience.
So this is the book we're finishing up.
Tom Eversole picked up
his basket of groceries
and walked out.
Then Shan walked softly
inside and listened
to Mr. Conley count the
Emmanuel Greene had brought.
(lively music)
- How did the flour come out of the bag?
-  Because there
was a hole in the bag.
- He didn't know that.
- Yeah.
(dramatic beats)
Well I'm really frustrated right now,
because I've told my kids
like a million times,
don't touch my computer,
and one of them went in there,
and they took the mouse
and now we can't find it.
And my computer isn't a computer
that can function without the mouse,
and so I'm just looking all over my house
for this mouse, and I can't find it,
and it makes me mad,
because when you need to find something
and you can't find it,
doesn't it make you frustrated?
So deep breaths.
Well I've looked and looked for the mouse
and then I troubleshooted
with the mouse I did find,
and then I called in the
expert, the big guns.
He's going old school.
What is this thing?
-  There's a cord
that's connected to the mouse.
Hey.
- Does it work?
- There you go.
-  That's why we
keep old stuff around.
Jeremy you're magic.
You make all my problems disappear.
- That's why you need to have a husband.
(Kendra laughs)
(Janae babbling)
-  Hi.
There we go, there's a car.
(Janae crying)
Do you still hate your car seat?
I know, I know.
-  Here's a binky.
Here's a blanket.
- Still hate it.
So the last couple days
have actually been
pretty hectic around here
and I keep forgetting
to go grocery shopping
and so it's dinnertime and
I've got absolutely nothing,
so we're gonna go to Chick-fil-a.
(enchanting music)
-  Do you see the
Christmas lights twinkling?
- I saw, I saw all of them there.
-  That'll happen.
-  Yeah it might hurt your--
- Woo!
-  No, it's not,
it's not, it's not.
(Janae cooing)
(Laura singing)
-  Hey Laura could you sing
a little bit louder for us?
(Laura singing)
Laura, go get in the car, and you need
to get your shoes on and a jacket.
It's gymnastics time.
(upbeat dance music)
So how was violin?
- Good.
-  Okay, get your jammas on.
So we've started reading
with our kids in bed
to kinda calm down before we actually
have them go to sleep.
What are you reading, Laura?
- Christmas book.
-  Christmas books.
So what are you reading Cub?
- Boxcar Children.
And it's a 150 page book.
-  Is this your
longest book you've ever read?
- Yeah, but the second is 120.
-  Are you liking the book?
- Yeah.
- Well tonight I went out shopping
and I attempted to finish up
our Christmas shopping,
but it didn't work out.
Different stores were out of things
that I was hoping they would have,
some things looked different in person,
and so it didn't really work out.
It was a little discouraging.
I meant to vlog when I was out,
but I just honestly
wasn't feeling up to it.
I'm feeling really tired today,
but more than that,
I'm feeling emotionally depleted.
I'm feeling anxious,
(gentle music)
and I can feel even my anxiety in my neck
and my shoulders.
Maybe tension or stress
is a better word for that.
But I can just kind of feel
that with the traveling
we just did, and some of the big decisions
that Jeremy and I have been making,
and just, you know, the hustle
and bustle of everything,
I can tell that I'm needing
to take some time for myself.
I need to get a good night sleep tonight.
I need to ignore whatever work stuff
I need to be getting done,
and instead, make a big
cup of hot chocolate
and sit and watch one of those cheesy,
predicable Christmas movies.
And that's what I need tonight,
so that's what I'm gonna do.
I hope you guys are having a good night.
Be sure to take care of
yourself this season.
- So Kendra just showed me
the coolest thing she just bought.
So they look like normal
everyday winter gloves.
- I just bought new gloves.
-  But,
- Check this out.
Swipety swipe, swipety swipe.
So they're actually advertised
as phone friendly gloves,
and the difference is on this finger
and this finger.
The other fingers, you
can't operate your phone
with those fingers.
I can totally use my phone
with my gloves on.
-  It's amazing.
- Maybe this is old
news to everybody else,
but I'm feelin' pretty snazzy.
- Poll question, how much do you think
the gloves cost?
I'll put some options in the poll,
like zero to five, six to 10,
11 to 15, 16 to 20, and 21 to 25.
- And comment below, if you think I should
become a hand model,
because that's the thing.
-  You're already there.
Look at that.
And the answer is
- Four dollars and 88 cents.
(bell dings)
-  Nice.
-  Say bye.
Bye.
There's the bye.
- Goodnight, J House out.
- Alright, the big question,
will we be having another baby?
