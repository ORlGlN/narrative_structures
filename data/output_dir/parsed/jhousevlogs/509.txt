and it's just gorgeous to be out here in
nature and the kids are all so happy
here in other news I did eat Lisa's hair
this morning and that's a really big
deal because I don't know if you've
noticed but her hair is always either
down or just in a ponytail and that's
because that's all I know how to do I
literally don't know how to do hair but
after watching my niece amber do
wheelies in Laura's hair this weekend I
felt a little inspired so I decided to
try something new so I did like the
inside out French braid which I've never
tried before and then with the little
hair at the end I decided to try to do a
little bud it worked I'm so excited you
enjoying your oatmeal gloves just always
have too many fingers I think that's
true I think you're in alright you're
gonna pick up the pinecones yeah those
are cool work gloves so the kids are
helping Papa with a project this morning

pinecones good shot good job
