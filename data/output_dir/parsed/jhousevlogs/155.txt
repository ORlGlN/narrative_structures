- It's like a dream come true.
(upbeat music)
-  Here we go.
-  So how did you
guys sleep last night?
- Good.
I didn't have any dreams.
-  No dreams?
- I had two bad dreams.
- I had two good dreams.
-  What was your dream Caleb?
- A transformer was trying to get me
and I was at first beating her.
I climbed up a rope and
she couldn't get me.
So then she started kicking the rope.
It started bouncing up and down.
I was just going up and down too fast.
Then I flew off and eventually won.
It was still scary.
-  For sure, I'm glad you won.
- Yeah.
-  You doing the laundry?
- Yep and Jenae nae's in there.
-  Jenae nae's in the laundry.
- Why is Jenae in there?
-  She just wanted
to help with the laundry.
(upbeat music)
Good job.
- Two, four, six
eighth, ten, 12,
14, 16, 18, 20.
- So with some of the
testing that we've doing
recently with Elise, we
found that her dyslexia
is affecting her math a lot too.
So we're just trying to make
her math really hands on
and engaging and help
with learning with that.
- One, three, five, seven
nine, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19.
- We'll keep working on it.
- I could only find one shoe.
-  Was that
only one you could find?
So you just decided to go with
the flip flop on the other?
Perfect.
How does it feel to have
one shoe and one flip flop?
- Feels like you
might hurt your ankle.
-  Stretch that ankle out.
- I want you to write down.
- Knob.
- Does knob rhyme with no?
- No, Mr. Snow.
- There you go, that one rhythms.
Laura's working on scissor
skills on paper thankfully.
I just got her this new sweatshirt.
It's super soft on the inside.
I got it from Walmart
'cause we're cool like that.
-  It was like three bucks.
- Isn't she so cute in
her little fall clothes.
-  This morning's a little chilly.
- Yeah it's in the 50s this morning.
Like 57 which is still gorgeous out.
But I just wanna make sure she is warm.
- We're going to a
homeschool party at the park.
(upbeat music)
- They're excited to meet new people
and see old friends that they haven't
seen during the summer time.
It's like a back to school celebration.
- I'm up here with some friends.
-  Alright,
y'all have a good time.
It's so fun to be able
to feel this community
and to know that there's other moms
that are going through
the same things as I am
with trying to get into the
groove of the school year
and get their kids to do
their spelling homework.
And keep it fun and anyway.
So it's been fun to be with friends today.
Brixton, break your back,
bend your knees with lifting
please, clap, clap clap.
Are you enjoying reading with us?
Two, four, six, a million, billion bricks.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  What do you think
Caleb, what are they building?
- Looks like a castle of some sort.
Look at there.
- So what do you think we need
to be able to build bricks?
- We need clay and then we
need um, that's all we need.
Well Mommy, I wanna
make bricks and then go
and build a house.
-  Do you know who did that?
Poppy Keith.
He built his whole house outta bricks.
- The mud house, that's why
we call it the mud house.
-  He did the
whole thing out of adobe.
- Bricks that he made out of mud.
This is Jenae's first
time in a shopping cart.
Hi.
So Laura, what are we shopping for?
- A wreath.
-  A wreath,
where's the wreath gonna go?
- On our door.
-  On our door, here we go.
This is a Home Good store.
I've actually never been
in a Home Good store before
so I'm hoping they sell wreaths
because that's what I need.
I need a fall wreath, we
have a Christmas wreath
and we have one that worked
really well for the spring
and summer, but it
doesn't work for the fall.
So we need to switch it up.
- Oh a pumpkin.
Flower.
-  See these are fall things.
- Can I smell it?
-  You wanna
smell the flower, sure.
We are looking for like
Halloween and fall things okay.
I'm letting myself get
distracted and I found this.
Wouldn't that look nice
next to Jeremy and I's bed?
What do you think?
- Good.
- So this outfit that
Laura's wearing today
she chose and picked out herself.
This is actually Elise's shirt
but she's wearing it as a dress.
- Because it's too big on me.
Too big on me.
-  So you wear it as a dress?
- Yeah.
-  Well it looks really nice.
- That is so creepy.
Wreaths.
-  There they are.
It's pretty.
-  So pretty.
That is not pretty.
I need it like this.
-  So you don't like
the one that Mom picked?
I don't know I think this one's pretty.
I'm trying to decide how
fallish I want to go.
I don't think I want
pumpkins hanging on my wreath
but I'm not sure.
(upbeat music)
Well Laura is surprisingly
very opinionated about wreaths.
She is saying the funniest things
as soon as I turn off the camera.
She's talking about how
all of these wreaths
are not nice except for this one Momma,
you need to buy this one.
She's very attached to the wreath she has.
This one's Laura's pick.
Hi Jenae.
So I told Laura not to touch
the wreaths but to point
and she's pointing with her toes.
This girl is so entertaining to shop with.
I am loving this shopping trip.
How are we doing?
- Good.
- So now I'm second guessing myself.
Maybe pumpkins are fun on a wreath.
I don't know they look pretty cool
especially with the hay.
I've narrowed down the wreaths
to three final choices.
Let me know in the poll which
one you would have picked.
I still don't know, I haven't decided yet
which one we're getting.
- This one.
-  You like that one?
- Yepidy.
-  So there's the white one
that Laura is in love with.
Then there's this
floralish one that I like.
Then an orange one.
(rock music)
- I made a football field
with yards instead of my feet.
I made it to 10 yards for each cone
and this is a 40 yard football field.
Two fifths of a football field.
-  Set, hike.
(rock music)
Good catch.
- I'm loving having audiobooks being part
of our homeschool routine this year.
It's going really well so far.
Elise is listening to Little
House in the Big Woods.
And I saw on Amazon the other day
this little set of paper dolls
that are Little House in the
Big Woods paper doll set.
So she's sitting in there
cutting out the little dolls
and the dresses while
listening to the book.
It just makes my heart happy.
I actually used some paper
dolls when I was a kid
and I remember my mom
telling me about paper dolls
and my grandma and I
just think that's cool.
I love old stuff.
- I finished the book.
-  Okay so here's how
this paper doll set works.
In the front there's the dolls
and you just pop those out.
You don't have to cut them.
But then all the clothes
you have to cut out.
Leesy's already cut out
two pages of these clothes.
- But I don't know what
these thingys are for.
-  You mean the stuff
that sticks up at the top?
That's what attaches it to the doll.
- Oh so you fold them back.
-  You do.
In Little House in the Big Woods story
did they have paper dolls?
- Yes.
-  Is this cool to
have your own paper dolls now?
- It's like a dream come true.
I never had real paper dolls in my life.
-  Yeah, look how awesome
you're doing with these too.
There it is.
- I had a few mistakes on some
but you can not see them.
-  Yeah, that's totally okay.
Did you know we're actually gonna
read the next one as a family read-aloud?
- Yay!
Yay, yay, yay!
(laughter)
- I made this picture, it's a house.
-  What's the house made out of?
- Bricks.
-  Oh, how many
bricks do you think
it would take to build a real house?
- Let me see how much this one has.
-  You counting all those bricks?
- It took me 43.
-  43 bricks to build that house?
I like your design.
-  Hey big girl,
it's time to wake up.
Did you have a good nap?
-  Alright, well here's
the fall wreath that I chose.
It's not perfect.
It's actually nothing like
what I expected to buy
when I went to the store,
but I only had time
in my schedule to go to one store.
And I only had 15 minutes
to be in that store.
It is perfect because it's done.
That is something that I am
trying to learn in my life
as a perfectionist.
A good fall wreath is
better than intending
to go out forever and never
actually getting it done.
So here it is, our fall
wreath in all of its splendor.
How was ballet?
- It was good.
-  I missed you wreath shopping,
I could have used your opinion.
- Yeah, I'm really good at shopping.
-  You are.
- So tonight Isaac's
scout troop is getting
together for a cookout, a
big barbecue at the park.
It smells really good.
(rock music)
- Ignore my messy house behind us
and just focus on these awesome boys.
They are watching football together.
- It's the Chiefs.
Who they playing?
- The Patriots.
- We're losing right now
but there's still hope.
- Seven to 17.
-  You tracking the data dude?
- Good night, J House out.
- I just had a really, really scary
experience in the parking lot.
(upbeat music)
One, two, three.
