- So Kendra was just telling
me that she has a close friend
who thinks they might be
pregnant when they weren't trying
to be pregnant and they're
concerned about that.
Let's just get your little face in here.
And I told her it reminded
me of this time recently
when Kendra, well you
tell them this story.
- I played such a good joke on him!
- Oh my gosh, it was not...
- I played such a good
joke on you! I got him!
So, what was it, a couple weeks ago?
- We were painting the deck.
- Yeah, so it was relatively recent.
And I tend to feel sick
even before I get a positive
pregnancy test in my experiences.
And I had had a few days of
just, like, not feeling great.
So I was getting worried. Right?
- Oh no, well and I was like...
- Anyway...
- "Have you done a pregnancy test?"
And she was like, "I probably should."
- So, anyway, that was at
the point he's out painting
the deck and I go in.
And, um, anyway.
I pulled an old positive pregnancy test...
- Oh my gosh.
- From Laura, I had stuffed
it in the side of a drawer
and I still had it there.
And I didn't know if I did
still have it so I pulled it out
and I kind of laughed
to myself. I was like,
"this is gonna be good!"
- So I'm out painting, I'm
you know, painting the deck.
- And, anyway, I hand the
pregnancy test to Caleb
and I say, "go tell daddy that
mommy has a surprise for him"
'cause I knew if I went out
I would just bust up and
it wouldn't work.
So I come in and I'm working
on something in the kitchen
where I can see the deck, and
Caleb goes out and he says...
What does he say? I wasn't out there.
- He, you know, "Daddy, this is from mom,"
something like that, you know.
And I grab it.
And I take a second to read it
and I'm analyzing and I'm like, "no way!"
And I turn around and
Kendra is in the kitchen
but she's not watching me,
she's like doing something.
- And I turn around and I
see him and he's just still.
Just staring at it.
- I'm not expecting
currently to have a baby.
That's important to the story.
- Right now.
- Yeah, I don't want a baby right now.
So I was pretty surprised
and pretty shocked.
- We feel like our four
little babies keep us
busy enough right now.
- Yeah, and if you've been
watching this, you can see that.
- It's true. Caleb alone, Caleb alone.
- So, I came in, I don't
remember what you said.
- I don't remember either.
How do we not remember the punch line?
- The punch line was, oh
my gosh, and then you--
- And, anyway, I think Jeremy
said something along the lines
of "this is positive!
"This is..."
And I'm like "yeah, it is!"
Because it is a positive pregnancy test.
It's just not from this moment in time.
And he was like "oh my
gosh, oh my gosh..."
And I said, "gotcha!"
And he was just floored.
Anyway, twenty minutes later,
he's still standing out on
the deck, like zoned out.
It's like, "I got you so good!"
Anyway, every wife has to
pull that prank on their
husband at some point and
I got such a good time.
It was so believable. I got him!
- Yeah.
- I got him.
- It confirmed, though, that I
currently do not want a baby.
Like those emotions and feelings.
Like I was trying to be super positive.
But I was just like, "Hey,
yeah. Another baby..."
- And when I asked, he's like,
"well I was happy but..."
- Yeah.
- Anyway, and I, what was I
gonna say? It just left me...
It was just really funny. Later that day,
like multiple times that
day, and the next day
I was just remembered it
and I just laughed so hard
and I just, I got you! I got you!
- Maybe it's still to close
to home, like it was...
She got me really good.
- He actually believed
me. It wasn't just...
Like I effectively
pulled the prank on you.
- Oh completely. She got me.
- Yes! Nailed it!
- Not cool. Throw away
those old pregnancy tests.
That is not cool.
(Kendra laughs)
-  So Caleb was out
of our sight for how long?
- Seriously, was it two seconds?
-  Two seconds.
This is what happens.
It's so difficult!
So we leave him alone for like a second.
He's been into everything this morning.
Oh, he's gonna get green
all over everything.
- Say "goodbye daddy".
- ♫ Twinkle, twinkle, little star
♫ How I wonder what you are.
♫ Up above the world so high,
♫ Like a diamond in the sky.
♫ Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
♫ How I wonder what you are.
