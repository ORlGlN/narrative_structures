- Tommorrow's my birthday.
-  It is.
- I got cupcakes, and I
decorated it all by myself!
-  Ahh, they are so cute.
- I got one from Brittany.
-  Wow!
-  Look at that face.
(laughing)
-  Oh my goodness,
look at this temperature.
(light-hearted piano music)
(baby squealing)
Well Jenae has a new favorite
spot, now that we're home.
She learned how to climb, huh?
She knows how to get up there,
but not how to get down.
(baby talking)
Here, Nae Nae, let me show you.
Let me show you.
You gotta turn around and climb down.
(kids laughing, baby talking)
She's off, and immediately
trying to get back on again.
So I haven't gotten Janae out of her
warm footie pajamas today.
Because she just looks so warm and cozy,
and I don't want to get her cold.
She just might be in
pajamas for the next month.
As soon as I turn the camera
off, she was up there.
Up and back down.
-  Uh oh.
-  Uh oh.
(light-hearted, piano music)
-  So you guys excited to go back
and see your friends at school?
-  Yeah.
(melodic music)
-  So how are you
feeling about going to school?
- I'm so excited.
I get to see all of my friends,
which is basically the whole class.
And I'm so excited to
see my teachers again.
But the time change has
a little bit different.
I woke up and was just like...
-  Yeah, it would've
been 5:30 in California.
- Yeah, because I slept in in California.
-  Nae Nae,
did you find your toys?
Yeah, there it is.
Hey Laura, what are you getting ready for?
- A birthday party.
-  A princess birthday party.
- Mmhmm.
-  So fun.
-  She really wanted
a braided side ponytail.
-  I know it was
harder with shorter hair.
-  It is, we're doing our best.
-  Let's see it.
(royal music)
You look beautiful and warm.
Very nice.
Last night, when we got
home from the airport,
we unpacked everything,
and so that took some time,
but we did it, and then went to bed.
And we're up super early
because of the time change,
for the kids to head off to school.
We homeschool our kids,
but one day a week,
they go to a private homeschool co-op.
It's really cool.
Trying to find the bag that will
fit the present for Brittany.
Good job.
- Some tissue paper now.
(paper crumpling)
(baby talking)
-  You did a
great job, it's perfect.
- It's a little heavy, but I can carry it.
(playful music)
-  Beautiful!
(playful music)
-  Bye guys!
-  Bye!
-  Have a good day!
You gonna miss them?
- I like them.
-  You like them?
-  Mmmhmm.
- Me too.
Well, I'm absolutely amazed
that we're on time to school today.
Just because of the time change and
everything that was
going on, but we did it.
Now, it's off to a birthday party.
- (cheering) Uh uh oh!
-  Excited to see your friends?
- Yeah.
- So a big load of groceries was
dropped off last night at our house,
because I did online grocery
shopping before we arrived.
But of course, I forgot a few things
and Caleb had a few special
requests for his birthday,
which is tomorrow.
So I'm at the store picking up some stuff
and Janae is my buddy.
She and I are having a good time.
Boo!
We're just kinda loving
life at the grocery store.
Yeah, look at the pretty flowers.
Which ones do you like?
They're all so pretty huh?
Pretty flowers.
And I decided that's
what we need this week
to make our adjustment to the cold weather
a little bit sweeter, we're
gonna buy some flowers
to put on our kitchen table.
How was your party?
- Good, I got cupcackes,
and I decorated all by myself.
-  What color did you decorate it?
- Um, white.
-  White?
- Uh huh.
-  Were there any sprinkles?
- Um, yeah, and several of them, too.
-  Whoa, that's fancy!
Let me see what you got in your hands.
A princess bag, and
what kind of a necklace?
- Candy necklace.
-  A candy--
Are you cold?
- Yeah.
-  Let's get in the car.
Oh my goodness. Look at this temperature.
That's so cold!
Are these the little goodies
you got from your birthday party?
- Yeah.
-  It looks like it
might be a pencil sharpener.
Yeah, that's cool.
- Two pencil sharpeners.
-  Ooh, but they
look like high heels.
That's fancy.
- Oh, I think I wanted...
I got two, one from Brittany.
-  Wow! This is awesome.
-  How was school?
-  Good!
-  Was it good
to see your friends?
-  Yeah.
- So being home is very different
than being in San Diego.
I just met with my accountants.
We're already scheduling appointments
for all kinds of things.
Getting read to drop the kids off
at gymnastics and violin,
and just all the day-to-day normal things
that are here in Kansas City.
But what I want to do is try to
bring the spirit of
adventure with us back home.
There's a lot of things
there that we've wanted to do
or places to go eat that
we haven't tried before,
and so I think as we look
for those things and plan
like we did in San Diego,
we can keep the spirit
of adventure going.
(high energy music)
Look at that face.
Look at that face.
Good job.
(laughing)
Uh!
Did you miss your basketball hoop?
- Yeah.
(high energy music)
(piano music)
- So our family has been
really wanting to get a pet.
We would love to have a dog.
But that's a big decision,
and so we have some friends
who are going out of town
and they need a dog sitter.
So I figured that'll be
a great chance for us
to try the responsibility of
having a dog for a short time.
We need to go meet the dog
to make sure it's a good match
before they go out of town.
So that's what we're doing right now.
We're going to meet Max and Molly.
And he has nothing to say.
(barking)
(laughing)
They like the camera.
-  Technology!
-  So this is Max and Molly.
Ah, they are so cute.
-  For some reason,
our other kids are feeling
a little nervous about the dogs,
which is why we wanted
to do some dog-sitting.
Janae is the brave one of the children.
-  Where did the dogs go?
Hey, you gotta go get them.
- So we're back home.
Poll question: Do you think we should take
Max and Molly for five days?
What do you think?
- So I'm really excited about it.
They are very energetic.
I know they would be a
lot of work, but I think
it'll be a good experience for the kids
to be able to kinda get
more used to animals,
and for our family to
see if it's something
we're really interested in
having a pet of our own.
- I wish we had a fence,
'cause it would be a lot easier.
I'm very open to it.
See, it's coming up in a...
Week or two.
- That's very soon.
- We'll have to decide.
- We'll have to make a decision.
Laura is asleep,
and I'm getting ready
to put this one to bed.
But the big three kids are all reading,
and it just makes me happy
when the house is quiet,
and they're all reading.
- Tomorrow's my birthday.
-  It is.
♪ Happy happy birthday. ♪
♪ Happy, happy birthday. ♪
♪ Tomorrow's your birthday, birthday... ♪
- I've got a question for tomorrow.
-  What is it?
- What will you like the most
out of all of my presents?
-  Ooh, that's a good one.
(soft piano music)
Say "goodnight".
Say "J House out"
(baby babbling)
- Goodnight.
J House Out.
- Well, we are packed up and
getting ready to say goodbye.
-  What was one
of your favorite things
that happened here?
(uptempo guitar music)
- Haaaah, do you see that?
That's my breath, it's cold.
-  How does it
feel to be home, you guys?
(guitar music)
