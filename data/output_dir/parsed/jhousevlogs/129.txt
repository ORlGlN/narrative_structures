It's kind of unbelievable how many things
you can make pumpkin.
Here's the secret sauce.
So they have a whole pumpkin
sectio here at the store.
There's pumpkin bread, pumpkin streusel,
pumpkin cake, pumpkin
donuts, pumpkin party mix,

a pumpkin spice flavor at the store?

The answer is no, we weren't able to find
any pumpkin spice at our store.

of pumpkin spice on there.
Ranch pumpkin spice.

what you think on this one.
Let us know in the poll,
does it pumpkin spice?
-  What do we think?
Will it pumpkin spice?
- No.
No.
- Well I don't like it but I think it is.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- No.
-  Alright, the answer is no.
We didn't find any deviled eggs
that were pumpkin spice at the store.
- That is odd.
- As normal, I didn't not like it at all.
- Me neither.
- I did not like it but
I thought it would be.
- Soda, will it pumpkin spice?
-  Give it a drink.
-  What do you guys think?
Is there really pumpkin soda at the store.
Yes?
- Yes.
-  Alright and who says no.
- No, no.
-  And the answer is
that at our grocery store,
no they do not have pumpkin soda.
- So we thought we found some
pumpkin soda at the store,
but we were wrong.
So they had to do an ID
for this pumpkin ale,
we thought it'd be
really fun for the kids.
Like ginger ale, but pumpkin flavor.
But it's alcoholic, so we won't take that.
- Butter.
- I don't like it, but I think there is.
-  Is there really pumpkin butter?
- Yes.
- Yes.
-  Alright, the answer is yes,
there is pumpkin butter.
- Real pumpkin butter.
- Can we try it.
- We found pumpkin butter.
It seems more like a pumpkin jelly
than a pumpkin butter.
Popcorn, will it pumpkin spice.
- Handful for me.
This looks good.
-  Alright, put
on the pumpkin spice.
- It's good.
- Yum.
-  Alright,
what do you guys think?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
-  The answer is no.
(buzzer)
We weren't able to find it at the store.
Now we do have to say you guys,
just because our store doesn't have it,
doesn't mean there isn't
pumpkin spice popcorn out there.
So we realize that is a real thing
but it wasn't at our store.
- When Jeremy and I were
at the grocery store,
we were completely surprised by some
of the pumpkin pie stuff
that we found there.
So let us know in the comments below
what's the craziest thing
that you've ever seen,
heard of, or eaten pumpkin spice.
-  Goodnight, J House out.
- Isaac, I have a very
good piece of advice.
Don't listen to your dad.
(rock music)
-  That is the cutest thing ever.
