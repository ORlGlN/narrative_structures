-  Today's a
big day for this girl.
Who wants to help feed Janae?
- Me.
-  Do you know what's happening?
She likes it.
-  Elise is gonna try
some of what Janae's been eating.
- Everybody get in the wagon.
(yelling)
- Wagon ho!
-  I got you a surprise.
(gasps)
(bright music)
So Caleb is moving this string,
by having it wrapped around the banister.
- Almost done.
-  What are you
doing with the string?
Oh, so she linked her
door handles together.
Way to go.
You did it the same as Caleb,
you were inspired by him?
- Yeah.
-  This string is going up here,
around this banister,
around that banister,
back up and over this knob.
- This is mini-me,
but her name is Emily,
but soon I'll have long hair
-  Yeah.
- and do a big bun.
-  Do you miss your long hair?
Yeah.
I love your short hair,
but I know you've been
missing your long hair lately.
- Mmm-mmm.
-  And luckily hairs grows.
Before you know it, you're
hair's gonna be long again.
Today's a big day for this girl.
Janae, you ready to eat food?
- We know that she's ready.
For the last two or three weeks
she's been just looking at
our food and wanting it,
grabbing at it.
-  Who wants to help feed Janae?
- Me.
- Me!
-  Who wants
to taste her baby food?
-  Ooh.
- Me!
(Kendra laughing)
-  There's a few takers,
and a few not takers.
-  Isaac, do you
want to try some peas?
-  I love baby food.
-  You love baby food?
I don't know if you're
gonna like this one.
This one's rice cereal.
(Janae sneezes)
(Kendra laughing)
Hey you.
So for her first food,
I mixed together some rice cereal
and some water, and just a
touch of baby sweet potatoes.
And I wanted to make it really runny.
Do you know what's happening here?
We're gonna feed you food.
(baby cooing)
Who thinks she's gonna like it?
Okay, there's some votes for like it.
Who thinks she's not gonna like it?
(baby cooing)
Okay here it goes.
Here it comes.
What was that?
- Like a pro.
-  What was that?
-  She swallowed it.
- You want some?
(laughing)
-  She's full on eating it.
- She's so into it.
Hi baby, we're ready.
Did you like it?
Do you want some more?
This is the best response to a first food
we've ever had in our family.
Alright, are you ready for another bite?
Here it comes, oh you're
already helping eat.
-  She's like Mom, I
can just hold the spoon myself.
(laughing)
- Give me more.
Somebody likes eating.
-  Can I?
-  You want to try feeding her?
Okay.
(Janae yelling)
-  Give me more!
(laughing)
- Yep, you can try feeding
her all by yourself.
It's coming, it's coming.
She likes it.
(laughing)
-  So Isaac was our
first little baby to do this,
and he had a bad reaction to food.
You would gag and you didn't
like the texture in your mouth.
-  I was too young
when you guys did it.
-  We did not
know what we were doing.
She wants to do it herself.
- Come on, come on.
(laughing)
- I'll open my mouth so wide
if I was a baby.
-  When you were a baby?
That's a good plan, not
when you're a grandma?
- Now she's sucking on it.
(lively music)
-  What do you think Isaac?
How does the food look?
- Grotty.
-  I just
remembered how we did this.
Here Janae, here, you hold this one.
Okay, now you feed her with that one.
(laughing)
-  She's too smart for that.
She's like wait a minute, this red spoon
doesn't have anything.
- So when some of our kids did this,
we would just give them
another spoon to play with,
but she's just putting it in her mouth.
(baby cooing)
You want more?
-  She ate the whole thing.
- So now we're gonna
give her one of these.
Okay.
What do you think?
-  Dissolvable cardboard.
- Yeah, basically.
Sp this is an organic teething wafer.
It's sweet potato and banana flavored.
Who wants to try this?
- Me!
- Me!
- Alright.
-  Give it a try.
(crunching)
- It's good.
-  My turn.
-  It's good.
- This may backfire, letting them test
the baby food, if now they
want to eat Janae's baby food.
(crunching)
- Whoa, this is actually good.
(loud baby cooing)
-  The incredible hulk.
(laughing)
(crunching)
- I like it.
-  Cheer for Nae Nae.
(clapping)
-  You did it!
- You did it.
I'll give you this spoon as a reward.
I'll try eating this end.
-  Alright, Elise is gonna try
some of what Janae's been eating.
- Okay.
Hey, it's actually pretty good.
- I'm just gonna watch.
-  It's not very good?
- It's good.
- Just a little bit good.
- Would you want to eat that for you
- Breakfast?
- Breakfast?
-  No (laughs).
- I want one more taste.
-  Yeah, you can
have as much as you want.
- Okay.
- You can eat the whole thing.
- It's more liquidy.
Caleb I really want you to try some.
That much.
- I don't like it.
It's weird.
- I guess I'm just a
person who likes baby food.
-  I guess so.
(mock gagging)
(laughing)
-  So here's
our library book stash,
the books that we've been
reading about the Oregon Trail.
Alright, a true book, the Oregon Trail.
(twangy uptempo music)
Isaac is playing Oregon Trail.
- Our family is not doing that well.
-  What happened to your family?
- I have the weasels.
- Caleb has the measles.
-  The what?
- Measles.
- Oh no!
- Caleb has died.
-  Caleb you died.
Okay, so the weather is hot,
your health is very poor.
Do you think you're
gonna make it to Oregon?
- No.
- Can we restart the
game, so I'm still alive?
- Poor Isaac, he's made
it halfway to Oregon
on the Oregon Trail game,
and everybody in his family has died.
They got measles, they had fevers,
they lost all their food,
when the wagon tipped over on a river.
It's been a sad game.
-  Me sad.
-  Isaac you did a great job.
I know everybody died and
you didn't make it to Oregon,
but you can try again.
- All the people in your party have died.
(lively music)
-  What in the
world are you guys doing?
- Go that way.
- Making a wagon.
-  You're making a wagon?
- Yeah.
-  Cool.
-  Laura, you
help push it down, okay?
Alright, so how long is
this side of the wagon?
- 10 feet.
-  And how wide is it?
- Four.
- Alright everybody get in the wagon.
(yelling and laughing)
so what if we had to fit everything
we wanted to take on
our trip in this wagon?
- Food, a lot of food.
- I'm actually gonna
take a whole pack of food
in my lunchbox, and yours
and yours and yours.
- I would take a gun and
bullets to have protection
and to hunt, if you run out of food.
- I would pack a gun,
the same thing as Isaac,
but then I would also pack a computer.
- A computer, nowadays that
would be a great choice.
So this book is a comparison of a family
that moved from Independence, Missouri
to Oregon City in 1846 on the Oregon Trail
and a family that did it now.
And so it's interesting to see
the side by side comparison.
1846, we take a raft across the river.
It's exciting, but my
brother Ned is worried
we might tip over.
Look, that's the Kansas River, guys,
that's right by us.
Monday, we drive over a bridge to Kansas.
So it was scary for them.
They would come to a
river and then be like,
oh my goodness, we have to cross it.
But we just get to drive over it.
-  Are you guys trying
to make a covered wagon?
-  I'm getting some.
(laughing)
- I've come with the oxen.
Let's get packed up guys.
- I brought flour for our journey.
We can use it for a pillow.
- And you guys remember,
we're gonna clean up
after this, right?
- Yeah, we're fine.
-  Yeah?
Are you sick Laura?
- I'm just pretending.
-  Okay, you're just pretending?
- So I never surprise Jeremy.
I cannot successfully surprise him,
because I am a can't
keep a secret from him,
because I am just a chatterbox,
and I get so excited about surprises
that I tell him right away.
So inside this box is
a surprise for Jeremy.
It's something small,
but it's fun to be able to have
a little small thing to surprise him with.
I'm gonna let him open
it up in just a second.
What did you make Lise?
- My bonnet.
-  Did you make
that all on your own?
- Uh-huh.
-  You totally did,
I'm so impressed with it.
That's really cute.
So they are playing
Oregon Trail together now.
- I used to play this as a little kid
during computer time in
first, second and third grade.
- I think April
- This is like nostalgic.
It's almost like playing
original Nintendo.
Wild fruit.
Woo!
- And we can hunt,
we have a lot of ammunition.
- We have a lot of ammunition,
I bought a lot of bullets.
- It's amazing how exciting
these old school games are
for all of us.
- We've looked around at every fort,
(digital music)
at the awesome graphics.
-  Are you guys almost there?
- Yeah.
-  I don't think I've ever seen
the ending of this game.
- This part of it's intense.
-  Look at that.
Oh no, here comes the rocks.
Get us there safely babe, you can do it.
- Good job Daddy.
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
-  There it is, Willamette Valley.
- We only lost one of the people.
Congratulations, you
have made it to Oregon.
Very nice.
How did you make that?
- I used paper and string, tape and a
-  Is that a paper plate?
- Y eah.
-  Genius.
-  Janae has joined
the fun in the wagon.
You driving the wagon?
- Wagon ho!
-  You pulling
it up the mountains?
- Where's the gun?
-  You gonna go hunt?
How's the wagon?
(baby cooing)
I have a little something
I wanted to show you.
I got you a surprise.
- You did?
-  Yeah and I actually
successfully surprised you.
You do not know
- You haven't told me yet?
-  what I have for you.
- What could it be?
-  You want to see?
- Yeah.
And you wrapped it for me?
- Yes I very carefully wrapped it for you
in an Amazon box.
- Do you guys know what it is?
- No.
- Let's see.
(gasps)
A whole stack of these
little cookie goodies?
-  Yep.
- Oh my goodness.
So I thought of them today.
I was gonna look 'em up and get some.
I seriously was.
On our flight, they had
these little cookies
that they were giving that
had caramel in the middle,
they're waffle cookies.
- And they are amazing.
And Jeremy fell in love with them.
Before we left the plane,
he actually asked for,
he's like can I have one or
two of these to take home?
I got on Amazon and found them.
- They're filled with caramel.
- So the ones on the airplane
were individually wrapped,
so we may have to go through
these a little bit quicker.
-  Can I try?
- These are like warm and softer.
Here, try one.
- I want to try it.
-  These are a lot
softer than the other ones.
-  They are super soft.
-  You went in for a big bite.
Good job.
- I'll let you guys have
whatever I don't finish
in this next bite.
-  He's gonna eat the whole thing.
I know where this is going.
We ended the evening with a movie
and some snuggling that turned
into a lot of silliness,
so now we're gonna try and go to bed.
- (whispering)  Goodnight.
J House out.
- It's like a dream come true.
(bright music)
-  Here we go
