-  You might win the whole league.
-  Is it cold Princess?
How could we ever use this much salt?
Are you guys excited for our trip?
- Yeah.
- We're gonna be there for a long time.
-  Happy New Year!
(techno music)
-  I love you Mom.
- X,X.
-  Is that for kisses?
- Yeah.
- Awesome.
So this morning the kids are playing
with this toy Zoob that we got.
It has been a big hit, I love
that Janae can't choke on
the pieces so that kids can
just have it out and playing.
I love how creative it is.
All the kids are doing different
things with it right now.
I'll show you.
What did you make Isaac?
- A person.
-  I love it,
can he actually move?
Cool.
- But then his head that just-
The splits.
-  Nice.
- Look at mine, it's almost done.
-  What is it?
- I just need one more.
-  Nice.
Well Laura, this is really cool.
And what did you build Caleb?
- A fire.
So I basically just made a circle
and I put all these up and then
I put yellow and some green.
-  I love it.
So here's the toy, it's
called Zoob Builders.
We got the 250 piece set.
This is totally not sponsored,
we just really like this toy.
It was a big Christmas hit.
So Isaac's made two robot little people.
- And I've named them.
This one's Rover and this
one's either Gary or Gandalf.
-  You guys came
up with the coolest idea.
- It was a big success.
-  I can't wait to
see the finished product.
- Now we will present the
America flag.
-  You guys did awesome.
-  And we're gonna
have a band after this.
-  So they
combined the Zoob pieces
with the Dublo blocks with paper.
Very creative.
I love your new glasses.
- Thanks.
They show rainbows.
-  Yeah, when you
look through the frame?
I love that there's flowers on the side.
I love 'em.
- In his first ever.
Pass it to Allen Robinson, tackle.
- So I love how deliberate
Kendra was with a lot
of the presents that she
got the kids for Christmas.
They aren't the kind of
presents that almost take away
imagination because
they're overly processed.
These are just building blocks
and then the kids get to make
of them whatever they want.
She was very deliberate in those decisions
and it's paying off.
-  It is third and five.
Down, set, hike.
He passes it.
-  They lose their heads.
(upbeat music)
Here's another one of the presents
Kendra got me that I love.
Mmmm.
So good.
These are little Danish waffle
cookies filled with caramel.
Apparently a breakfast item.
So on the picture of these Stroop Waffles,
they show it over a cup so I took some
hot apple cider and I'm gonna
put the Stroop Waffle on top.
It warms up the caramel.
I'm excited.
So our entire marriage we've
used this little salt shaker
and this one now feels like a giant.
-  Again, we got this
one at a white elephant party
otherwise we wouldn't have
a salt shaker probably.
- How could we ever use this much salt?
-  You don't realize how often
I add salt to that little thing.
- I feel like it's like
when you have a new baby
and you bring your new baby home
and all of a sudden your
toddler looks like a giant.
I'm a giant salt shaker.
-  Laura, you
getting ready for church?
- So it's so cold outside today.
-  Is it like negative 12?
- With the wind chill
it's like negative 12.
I think it's really like maybe
seven degrees is the high today.
So I didn't want the girls to have
to go out with their wet hair.
What is that?
What is that?
Do you wanna see what it does?
(laughter)
-  Yay!
- She's like, what was that?
If you go outside in
this kind of cold weather
with wet hair, your hair turns to ice.
It's so crazy.
-  Lunch for today.
Black olives.
Poll question, do you like black olives?
I'm a big fan, Kendra not so much.
-  How are you
guys feeling back there?
-  Cold.
- It's colder in here than out there.
- The kids are talking about
how they have goosebumps
all over their body.
Laura, where's your goosebumps?
- My nose.
- On her nose and her lips.
It is so cold here and we
love living in Kansas City,
we really, really do.
But because we home school
and Jeremy works from home,
we have complete flexibility
and so we've decided to escape.
During this winter we are
going away for a whole month.
We found a great deal on a rental house
because it's off season
and we are going to be
staying somewhere and I
am just giddy about it.
Every morning when I wake up I look at the
weather app for here and
then I swipe to the side
and look at the weather app for there
and I'm like, okay, I can do this.
Five more days people, five more days.
- So I'd love to see in
the comments your guesses,
where are we going?
- And we're gonna be
there for a long time.
Are you guys excited for our trip?
-  Yeah.
- It's gonna nice and warm
and we'll need to bring our swimsuits.
- My favorite part is
that it's gonna be warm.
A lot warmer than here.
-  It is cold.
Short walk to the church doors.
Is it cold Princess?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, okay let's go.
What a gentleman.
Well we just go home from
an inspiring church service
and what I loved is
that they focused today
on the fundamentals and how
as we move into the new year
focusing on those simple habits
like prayer and studying from
the scriptures and serving
that those are the things that will
bring the real change into our lives.
I just really like that.
Now we're getting ready to
party for New Year's Eve.
We are hosting Jeremy's brother
and sister-in-law and
their family for dinner.
We're cooking dinner and
getting some fun treats ready.
Elise, what are you making?
- The apple dip.
-  It's berry cream cheese.
- Berry cream cheese.
-  Then what do you mix it with?
- Marshmallow creme.
-  Yeah, that's why it's so yummy.
And Caleb, what are
you gonna help me make?
- Chex Mix and golden grahams.
-  It's a chewy,
gooey Chex mix for dessert.
- I'm doing mashed potatoes.
Kendra made a chicken
cordon bleu casserole
which is really good.
-  Let's see, it's bubbly.
Caleb's adding butter to the saucepan.
So here's the ingredients of the Chex mix
and now we're just getting the sauce
ingredients ready before we boil them.
- The sauce is the best part.
-  Yeah, that's
where all the sugar is.
Are you watching?
What's that dance?
Oh okay.
Now we need one and a
third cup of Karo syrup
and one and a third cup of sugar.
Where's one cup?
-  To there.
-  There's one cup,
so one and a third cup.
-  There.
-  Yeah, that's it.
Who's here?
- Cousins!
Cousins!
Cousins!
- Come on in.
-  Come inside.
- This stuff is so good and addicting.
You don't wanna stop.
-  There's coconut,
almonds, Golden Grahams
and then Rice Chex in here.
-  And then sugar goo.
-  Yeah, sugar
goo, that's where it's at.
Dinner is done.
We've got chicken cordon bleu casserole,
mashed potatoes, rolls, chopped salad
and apples with dip.
- I'm so hungry.
-  Are you really hungry?
- Yeah, I'm really hungry.
- So we are unfortunately
out of paper plates
but we're gonna pretend that it's because
we're super fancy and
since it's New Year's Eve
we wanna have a festive occasion
so we're actually using real plates
which is kind of a big deal
when we have guests over.
-  Getting ready for the party.
- We are going to do a balloon drop.
-  It's gonna be epic.
(techno music)
I got ya, she's playing
with them balloons.
Nae-nae hasn't really
engaged with balloons much
so this is a first.
Good job Elise.
- I tied my first balloon!
-  All by yourself?
- Yeah!
-  I still need Mom's help to do
that most of that time, that's hard.
Balloony.
It's not allowed to hit the ground.
- So this is Janae's first new years.
She's trying to walk away with it.
Here you go big girl.
-  Bang the pot and pan.
Or eat it.
-  Eat the spoon.
(cheers)
I think Janae's too tired to stay up
and celebrate with the rest of us
so this is her Happy New Year.
-  Happy New Year!
(cheers)
- She's like, I don't
know what's going on.
We're about to get out some family games.
First is Zingo.
-  Train.
-  Train.
-  Do you have a train Laura?
- Yes look.
Does anyone have clock?
-  Now we -
- Uh oh, for the cup.
- Whoever gets panda first.
- What was your favorite thing from 2017?
- Disneyland.
- You like Disneyland?
Did you like getting potty trained?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause that was a highlight for me.
Janae, what did you like?
- I did two math curriculums,
well I'm going to.
-  Yeah, you made a ton
of progress in math this year.
Well I graded it.
Do you wanna hear the results?
- Yeah.
-  You got 100%!
- I really like school.
-  School?
-  Caleb found his seat.
(upbeat music)
-  You learned
how to read this year.
-  You read,
you are reading books.
- I really like going
on the trip to Seattle,
I've never been to Seattle.
- Goodbye my son.
-  There he is, oh my goodness.
-  There he is.
Michael.
-  Alright Michael,
what was your favorite from 2017?
- Caleb.
-  Caleb.
(laughter)
- My favorite from 2017
is an easy one.
It's Janae.
Guys, I had a baby.
-  You did amazing, good job.
(upbeat music)
The top highlight of the year
for me was Janae being born.
But other huge things was
we paid off our house,
we have no debt, and I started a law firm.
-  Today's the last check.
- The last check to the bank.
We have a huge announcement.
Brent and I,
we're starting a law firm.
So those are really big things.
How about you Uncle Travis?
- In 2017, I published a book.
-  That's awesome.
- My own book.
-  I read it.
It was good.
Yeah, Isaac read it.
- Orion is the best book
ever, I recommend it.
-  There you go.
Nine, eight,
seven, six,
five, four,
three, two

- I am!
- Let me see it.

- Everybody's doing-
-  You might win the whole league.
- Look at the bar.
- So what's so fun with fantasy football
was we did the league because of Isaac
and he ended up winning the
whole thing out of 12 of us.
- I won fantasy football.
-  You won it.
-  Goodnight, J House out.
-  That was kind the face.
- Let's take down the tree.
