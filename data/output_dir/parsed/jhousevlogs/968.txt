-  Mary, where's your baby Jesus?
- I need baby Laura.
- (Laughing) Baby Laura's gonna fill in?
Apparently baby Laura
is gonna be baby Jesus.
- Hey!
- Who decided you guys were
going to do the Nativity?
- Us.
- Who came up with the idea?
- Me.
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)
- I'm actually Joseph.
-  Oh, you're Joseph?
- Uh huh.
-  And you're Mary?
- Umhum.
-  Okay. You guys are married then.
Go get your wife.
Tell her you love her.
(Christmas piano music with sleigh bells)
- No, we need to do the rest of it.
So we need to knock on
one of the stable's doors.
With the baby!
- I'll hold the baby.
- You put it --
And they said no.
- I'm the wise man.
-  And what are you on?
- My camel.
-  And what gift are you gonna give?
- Frankincense.
-  Why did you choose
that to be your frankincense?
- Because it's a kind of oil just like it.
Okay! Coming!
(silly, high pitched voices
with Christmas music)
-  What are you guys doing?
- We're cleaning up Jesus' poop down here.
Because he pooped in here.
- Um, Baby Jesus need a diaper change.
- I'll do it real quick
when I get this ready.
- I'm gonna do it.
-  We're ready.
- Diaper.
Baby Jesus is back.
Done.
-  You're gonna be
such a gentle father.
You Joseph?
- Um, yeah.
- It's time for Caleb to take a nap.
Oh, do you want him to come
sleep with you during nap time?
- Yeah.
- Because I think Baby Jesus
wants to sleep with Joseph
for nap time.
- And Mary.
-  I think Mary already took a nap.
So Joseph is just going to
sleep with Jesus so that,
I think we're gonna have
Joseph just sleep with Jesus
so that Mary can go get some --
- Groceries.
-  What are you gonna get?
- Groceries.
-  Oh, she's gonna
go get some groceries.
You're just gonna put
Jesus down and lay with him
so that he'll fall asleep, okay?
