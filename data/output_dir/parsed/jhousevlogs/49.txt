- So these shirts are dyed in chocolate.
(kids laughing)
- Donuts!
-  Should we go get some donuts too?
- Yeah!
(upbeat music)
- Pop-Tart donuts, this is half of it.
(family yelling)
- So we're getting ready
to head out this morning
to do a little shopping
and I asked the kids
if they know what a souvenir is.
-  Well first you
asked us how to spell it.
- I did.
-  And we all tried
and all got it wrong.
- I knew how to spell it but nobody else.
So we're learning how to
spell the word souvenir.
- Paul question, how do you think
is the correct spelling of souvenir?
I'll put some answers up here.
Don't google it first, that's cheating.
And the word of the day is -
- Souvenir!
- Like Sesame Street.
- So let's ask Laura first.
Laura, what is a souvenir?
- It is a pretty elephant.
- A pretty elephant,
Caleb what's a souvenir?
- I don't know.
- Lisey's raising her hand.
- It's something that goes
under water that people
discovered new animals.
(Paul laughs)
- That's a very specific answer.
- A souvenir is something that you, like,
can get in places like
a picture from San Diego
or something like that.
-  It's like a memento
to remember the place by?
- Mmhmm.
-  Like our San Diego Zoo
picture with the Bellingers.
There's a souvenir.
- So that's a Legoland souvenir.
What would you guys think of
learning how to spell the word
souvenir and going to
get a souvenir today?
-  The I, R at the
end totally threw me off.
- Donuts!
-  Should we go get some donuts too?
- Yeah!
-  So Mom had
everyone write souvenir,
and even Laura is writing
her version of souvenir.
♪ Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, ♪
♪ Connecitcut, doo doo
doo, Delaware, Florida, ♪
♪ Hawaii and Idaho ♪
(singing sped up)
(holding note)
-  Well this is getting.
- (holding note)
-  He's gonna pass out,
good thing we weren't driving.
Well I can't escape, but I'll put you guys
out of this misery.
So we heard about a legendary donut shop
here in San Diego so we had
to come down and try it.
Apparently they have bacon donuts.
(upbeat music)
- These are serious donuts.
- I want a pink one.
Like these ones.
- She got the pink one.
- I'm gonna do the strawberry split.
That looks amazing.
- I want coconut green.
- Mud pie.
So now we just have to pay.
- I want creme brulee.
- You guys made some great choices.
- We all want to try all the flavors,
so we're gonna cut them up.
-  Who's excited?
- Me!
- Hard caramelized
topping on creme brulee.
- Mhm.
- I thought it would be like soft caramel.
- So they're known for
these huge Pop-Tart donuts.
This is half of it.
Somebody knows what the good stuff is.
I'm a little embarrassed
between the six of us,
well seven of us,
we completely finished off this donuts.
Jeremy's actually ordering
a few to take home
because donuts, if you didn't know,
are one of Jeremy's love languages,
and these are good donuts.
They're like little ducklings
following behind Jeremy,
it's really cute.
Yesterday I was honestly really grumpy.
I just, grr, everything was irritating me.
And this morning I woke up still
feeling a little bit grumpy
and I prayed.
And I said, God, take these
feelings from my heart.
Like I don't wanna be
irritated with my kids.
I want to be able to enjoy this.
Like life is good.
I just feel irritated.
I just felt immediately this calm,
that just said Kendra,
remember to be positive.
Look for the good. It's there.
And I've been really focusing
today on being positive
and it's helped so much.
- You're a cute one.
- So we came down to Seaport
Village where there's just
a bunch of fun shops.
We're walking around.
- So here's one from the zoo.
This one says La Jolla.
- Is there any that says Pacifica?
- Look, there's sand castles.
- Whoa.
- Three, four.
So the kids are picking
out post cards to send
to their friends.
-  Seeing snow globes.
- I love it.
So this place is Cupcake Wars champion.
We had to come admire their cupcakes.
-  Smellable shirts.
- So these shirts are dyed in chocolate.
- Are they kids shirts?
- Yeah there are kids shirts.
Oh so when they get wet designs show up.
Whatcha playing?
- Solitaire.
-  It's a good game, huh?
- Left. Left. Right.
Those are opposites.
- Well the kids and I are headed to a park
to play with some friends this afternoon.
And Siri was taken me to two wrong places.
First we ended up in a neighborhood,
and I tried Googling a different location,
and now I'm in the
middle of a parking lot.
And its says, you've arrived, I'm like,
this is not a park.
This is a parking lot. So.
Hopefully my friend
can give me directions.
- One of the amazing things
about owning your own businesses
is that you can work from wherever.
And so we're not really on
vacation here in San Diego,
we're just doing the work that
I normally do at home, here.
Because I'm mobile.
But for example, today, while
the kids are at the park,
I earlier had a phone call
with a nonprofit board
of directors and I'm
advising them about terms
of service and some fair use things,
and so I'm preparing a response to that.
- we successfully found the park.
It was hidden behind the grocery store.
It was like you had to drive
through the parking lot
and it wound around.
It was unique.
- So the best part about
coming to the park today
is that we're meeting up with friends.
My friends name is Heidi.
Her YouTube channel is
While They Were Napping.
And she had four little kids
and they home school.
So I'm just excited that the
kids get to play with friends
and we get to chat, makes for good days.
- I actually got a really
sad email this morning
from a family who watches our vlogs.
And they were in a very
serious car accident.
How to be life flighted.
Her boy was thrown from the vehicle,
she was pregnant at the time.
They had other children in the car
that were taken by ambulance.
The mom was reaching out
about some legal advice.
And so I'm gonna be contacting her today.
One of the things I love
about being a lawyer
is being able to be a friend
and to listen to people and to help them
when they're going through
a really hard time.
I honestly don't think I would be happier
if I didn't have any work to do.
Because I love working. I love my job.
- Just relaxing. This is cool.
She loves dogs.
Woo!
I realize that they're fountain is a lion.
It's a drinking fountain.
- I love these kinds of climbing things,
they are so fun.
Dude, you're a monkey up there.
So Isaac is all the way at the top.
Good job Caleb.
You saying hi?
So this thing is cool.
Wow, that balance, you're
doing awesome, Caleb.
So Jenae just let go,
and I thought for a second she was gonna
take her first step,
and then she held back on.
But it was so close.
She's gonna start walking any day, guys.
You are so stinking grown up.
- So I'm doing this color mix sample.
And I'm making black things.
It's ready to get it
all black for tomorrow.
So then it can dry, dry, dry.
- So when we decided to
come stay in a rental house
for a month, at first I
was a little bit nervous
that the kids would get bored
because we wouldn't have
any of their toys with them.
But I've been surprised at how
well it's been going so far.
We purchased a few small things.
Things like paint and
colored pencils and Play-Doh.
Stuff that you can like
really get creative and do
a lot of different things with.
We also had to get a
football and a basketball.
And with just those few things,
the kids have actually done really well.
It also helped that the
house that we're staying at
had a few games,
so we had like chess and checkers.
It kind of makes me wanna go home
and clean through our stuff because
we really don't need as much as we have.
Anyway, it's actually
gone surprisingly well.
The thing that we miss the most from home
is our library books.
Woo! So close.
Did you find your way outside to play?
You just think you can just dance.
Here's dinner tonight.
We're having pulled pork, corn on the cob,
salad, and french fries.
You guys hungry?
- Yeah.
-  Lets eat.
You're praying?
Okay, you don't wanna
wait for everybody else?
-  She's so spiritual.
- This is Janae's trick.
And we find it hilarious.
- But that's what Caleb did.
-  Caleb did
this when he was a baby.
- So we recorded some of the NFL games
that happened this
Sunday and we're finally
getting the chance to watch some of them.
So who's going to the Super Bowl you guys?
- Eagles.
- Patriots.
-  Patriots and Eagles.
- Elise and I have been playing
some card games together
in the evening, and she is getting good.
- And good at shuffling.
- Yeah, she's been
practicing shuffling. Ready?
Jacks. Twos.
- Threes.
- Good job.
- Ten.
- Oops.
- Queens.
- Goodnight, J house out.
- Wanna make something amazing?
- Isn't it crazy soft?
Did you make a hammock?
- Yeah.
- It's really fun.
It's this amazing fort.
- So mango tart for dessert.
