(Elise giggling)
- Growing up my family
lived in Cincinnati, Ohio
and downtown there was on
outdoor ice skating rink.
And we went every year as a family.
So this is like a really
magical family memory for me.
I'm glad to be able to take Elise today
and we're gonna have to bring
the other kids another time.
Alright, we are slowly
getting the hang of it.
- Whoa!
-  You got it?
-  Uh huh.

but she's not hurt herself
yet, so that's good.
- Best day of my life.
-  You think so?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Now let's go skate!
-  Some more?
- Yeah!
(bright Christmas music)
-  Thank you!

is seeing everyone's faces.

and just walking by,
they just love seeing the kids out here
ringing the bells.

- So one of my family's
traditions growing up
was to have a nice
dinner on Christmas night
and so this is our dinner tonight.
I kept it really simple
just because we're traveling
and so I just needed something easy today.
But we're having roast and potatoes.
This is fruit: kiwi, pineapple,
strawberries, grapes.
Some veggies and some rolls.
Daddy for all the hard work
he does for our family.
To Isaac for being a wonderful brother.
And so loving and kind.
To Elise for being a
wonderful friend and helper
and having a tender heart forever.
To Caleb for keeping us all busy.
And for Laura for being as cute as can be.
Merry Christmas.

Holy cow.
Do it again.
- Well three of the
kids were sick yesterday
and then Elise was sick this morning
and was finally feeling
better this afternoon
and I'm so glad that we
waited to open presents
until everybody was feeling better,
because now everyone is loving
getting out their presents
and just enjoying them.

I love dark chocolate.

for chocolate in our house.
And I like my chocolate, don't I?
- I always see you do it.
- (gasps) A vase.
Buddy that's awesome.
Thank you.
- I've been wondering if it was a vase
or something you drink out of.
(Jeremy and Kendra laughing)
-  He got you a big cup.
- You didn't know if
it was a cup or a vase?
- I kind of more thought on the cup side.
-  So you have to drink out of it.
- Wouldn't that be kind of a painful cup
to drink out of?
-  Nope, you not
have to drink out of it.
- Thanks for the cup Isaac.
(laughing)
-  Multi-purpose.
(Laura yells)
(kids laughing)
- A football!
I think every year I get
a football from Isaac.
-  It's tradition.
- Last year I got it.
- Go deep, go deep.
- Last year I got you a Snickers.
- Well that's true.
- So growing up, us kids
gave my dad black socks
every year for Christmas.
And every year he acted surprised.
And now, our kids have
given Jeremy a football,
like every year for Christmas
for the last several years.
But he loves it.
So I just, I love that.
Do you guys have a gift
like that in your family
where somebody gets it every single year?
-  J House out.
- Since Jesus is Mary
and Joseph's daughter.
(all laughing)
(bright music)
-  God loves you.
