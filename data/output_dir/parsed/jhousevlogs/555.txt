times easier so thanks Michelle you're

you learn the notes on the piano and all
sorts of other fun stuff and you're
going to put them right on the keys see

neglecting it I think every other
neighbor and the neighborhood has

yeah
so this morning Jeremy and I got in
quite an argument I think we're both
grumpy and annoyed and defensive and
this like little issue that's been part
of our marriage for a while popped up
again and we got mad and anyway he left
for work I just was sitting here just
mad and grumpy and we decided that
that's not how we wanted to feel a day
like that's not how we wanted to feel
towards each other and so we both
separately decided to take some time and
read from the scriptures and pray try to
like really soften our hearts and then
we wrote an email to each other and an
email that was trying to share our
feelings in are like really raw emotions
about the topic without being defensive
or attacking the other person and I
think that's what really stood out to me
today is like we didn't obviously solve
this issue like it's not gonna be solved
just in a day but it was a good reminder
to me that all marriages have problems
like issues pop up and people are
annoying and you annoy each other but
when those issues arise we can either
have it divide us as we attack each
other or can we can be more unified and
solid together and try to attack the
problem together and oh I'll be here
so Kendra and I are out walking again
looking at homes it said really just
have conversation time and just talking
I love there's so many fun neighborhoods
to explore look at this purple house
that's fun it's purple hearing the cool
maybe lavender anyway there's so many
different styles and the weather's
gorgeous we're talking about our systems
and routines in our home and trying to
be more unified in what we're doing
that's good
okay good deal
just one offering it's such a bad idea
to go shopping when you're starving like
we're both so hungry
there's something about springtime that
just makes me want flowers in our
so I was summertime deciding like some
of them are brighter but these are just
like soft
that was a little mercy we have to buy
it now you ate it I was trying to spell
this one in that woman

these flowers to a lease because we
think shown glow
