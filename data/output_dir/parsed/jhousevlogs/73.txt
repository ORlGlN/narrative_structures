- Is it a hint 'cause of my bad breath?
- Yeah.
(all laughing)
- Whoa!
- Double.
Different wrap.
She wants.
- Dad, here you go.
- Yes.
This is too embarrassing.
(upbeat music)
- We're really excited
because it's time for our
favorite holiday tradition,
which is the kids' gift exchange.
If you missed it in our other videos,
the kids worked hard and earned some money
and then we took 'em to the store
and they got to shop for each other.
And so now they're giving the
gifts that they worked for
and got for each other and
it's always really sweet.
- Alright, Laura's up first.
Who's this one for?
- Caleb.
- Go give it to him.
-  Pass 'em out.
- Laura I like it, it's huge.
- To Nae Nae.
There you go.
Yours is really little.
- That's okay.
I bet I'm gonna like it.
- Yeah.
-  Janae's coming
after yours Jeremy.
- You want mine?
- She wants it.
- Is this one Lise's?
-  Let's see, let's read the tag
and it'll tell us.
To Mom from Laura.
So that one's for me.
'Kay.
- There it is.
-  Take it to Lise.
- Thank you.
- You will not know what it is.
- I do not know what it is.
- It's really shaped
like nail polish I think.
-  Uh oh. (laughs)
It's shaped like nail polish.
- Oh.
- But it's not nail polish.
It's, we stick it on--
-  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Shhhh!
- Don't tell her.
-  Don't tell her.
- I didn't tell her what color.
-  Okay. (laughs)
-  Let's just have
Elise open hers since we
might have a guess as to what it is.
- (gasps) This is beautiful.
So you stick them on your fingers?
- Yeah.
- Fake nails.
- I've wanted these,
like I wanted to put them on my fingers.
Thank you Laura.
- You're welcome.
- It's a really good gift.
It's like springy.
- They're beautiful.
So I love that Laura
helped wrapped her presents
and she even wrote her name.
L-A-U-R and another A.
-  Nailed it.
- Here Nae Nae, you ready?
-  I found one already.
I'm good.
That one's for you.
(Janae babbles)
- There you go.
(Laura gasps)
There you go.
- A baby book.
- What's in there?
It's a baby.
- She really.
- She likes it.
- She likes it very much.
- She does.
-  Caleb's turn.
- A golf thing?
- Yep.
It's for two of us.
We can play together.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you know what is it?
- You've told me like 10 times.
(Jeremy and Isaac laughing)
- But you don't know this time.
-  He forgot.
- Okay.
- Lise wrapped this.
- Wow, she did a good job.
- Yeah, a ball.
- It's for me and you to play with.
-  Here.
-  Boom.
- Whoo!
-  Hey Isaac.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- I love it.
- That's a great present.
-  My turn, my turn.
-  Mama's turn.
- Okay, one, two, three.
(gasps) They're flowers.
I love 'em, they're white
and they're so pretty.
I should put those in my bathroom.
- You should, with water.
That would make it grow bigger.
- Yeah, with water to make it grow bigger?
- Yeah.
- Daddy's turn.
- It's very cold.
- Cold?
- (gasps) Mouthwash.
- I know.
- Is it a hint 'cause of my bad breath.
- Yeah.
(all laughing)
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- I always needed and honest little person
to help me out.
- Yeah.
- Thank you Laura.
- I thought you would like it.
- I do like it.
I love it.
- I really thought you
would like it at the store.
- Thank you.
(Kendra laughs)
- I absolutely love the
gifts that the kids pick out.
That was awesome Laura,
you did a great job.
- Thanks.
-  Whose turn is it next?
-  Caleb.
-  Caleb's up.
-  So Laura is opening
her present from Caleb.
- Three, two, one, open!
- Gum!
Yeah!
- Yeah!
- You love gum!
- I know.
Thank you.
-  'Kay, go ahead Lise.
-  Hey Caleb.
- Whoa!
-  Double, different wrap.
(parents laughing)
-  How 'bout you help her?
You can see through it a little it.
-  Okay.
- That was the problem.
- You get to color this.
And then there's more pages.
- Thank you.
I like it.
- You color only those things
that are white, you can tell.
- Um hmm, yeah.
-  Oh that's awesome.
- There's more you can color.
- Ready, set, open!
- It's the new NBA sticker collection.
This is awesome.
-  2017 and 18.
- Thank you!
I love it.
- I'm Cubby.
- Okay, here it comes.
-  She wants.
She wants the mouthwash.
That's all she cares about.
- What's inside?
- It's things on top of her person.
- (gasps) It's so pretty.
- It's for to go on top
of her car seat I think.
- It's Cinderella.
- You can play with it.
- Say thank you Caleb.
- I like that it's so.
(Janae fusses)
- Where's my mouthwash?
She then calmed down once we
got her the mouthwash again.
- So apparently Janae loves the mouthwash.
But this is so cute Caleb.
Thank you.
She's gonna really love that
when she gets over her mouthwash phase.
Is this for me?
- Yeah.
- For me?
- Yeah.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Did you wrap this one?
- Yep.
- You did a really great job.
And you wrote to Mom, from Caleb.
(playful music)
- It doesn't shake.

I've been wanting one of those.
Oh thanks buddy.
So there's the Christmas mug.
I love that.
I've been really enjoying
apple cinnamon herbal tea.
This is gonna be perfect for it.

this tradition alive with this one.
Go long.
(laughing)
(growls)
Whoop.
- What?
- The football.
- Look how cool.
- 'Kay, go deep.
Aw.
- So close!
- I knew you'd get one.

kids gets Jeremy a football.
And it's a tradition and he loves it
and they love it.

(Janae babbles)
(all laughing)
Isaac.
- It's like why is that
hanging in your nose?
-  So one cute thing about Nae Nae
is she says Isaac all the time.
- All the time.
And it sounds like Isaac.
-  But she'll say Isaac.
(Janae babbles)
- See, she said Mama.
-  Say Isaac.
Hi Isaac.
- Can you say Isaac?

(Kendra gasps)
What did Elise get Mom?
- It's makeup!
- Uh huh.
- This is really pretty.

It should give me a shnazzy look.

Thank you.
I can always use an

'cause I'm always losing mine.
- That's true.
I told them to get me this one.
Thanks!
It's an extra cord so that
we can listen to music
like when we're driving.
- You've been listening to,
you've been making
playlists a lot recently.
- It's true.
And so it's a cord that
helps us listen to music.
-  Yay, that means
the whole family benefits.
- Thank you man.
-  You guys ready
for Janae Nae's gifts?
- Yeah!
- You give this to Lise.
Lise.
Give it to Lise.
(kids laughing)
Give it to Lise.
-  Yay!
- Alright, give it to Laura.
(all laughing)
-  No, give it back.
- Now give this one to Caleb.
She still wants Laura's present.
-  She's like I was
just able to shake that thing.
And it made noise.
Can you give that one to Daddy?
We're gonna open this one first,
'cause Janae's holding it.
-  What did Nae Nae get for Mom?
- Hmm.
-  Hopefully you like it.
- (gasps) It's salt and pepper shakers.
-  Yay!
- That's perfect, we need those.
- Big time.
We're still using a salt shaker
that we got at a white elephant party
in 2005?
- It's like this big.
Yeah, it was a long time ago.
- It's too small.
And so we always run out.
- It's like this big so you pretty much
pour out salt and then it's empty again.
-  What did Janae Nae get Laura?
- She choose which one.
- Cards?
- It's not cards.
It's a puzzle.
Who's on the front?
- Elana of Avalor puzzle.
- It is.
- Thank you Nae Nae.
- It's Elana of Avalor puzzle.
-  What did Nae Nae get Elise?
- Nail art.
See, a nail art?
-  Perfect.
- Oh my.
Yeah!
-  He got a
football sticker collection.
- I needed the 2017 one.
Thank you!
I wanted it.
- It's a FIFA sticker collection.
Yes!
Yes!
Thank you.
(parents laughing)
You tricked me Mom.
- I didn't trick you.
Dad tricked you.
He wrapped it like that.
- That was good.
-  Gotcha.
- 'Cause every time it's a
sticker collection I know.
- Yep, but not this time.
Last present.
Envelopes, normal ones.
So, we sometimes need envelopes
and we haven't had 'em for like a year.
And we'll only have the
little, gift size envelopes.
So I'm sending like a legal letter,
this is too embarrassing.
-  He sends like
legal documents in these
like party invitation envelopes.
- I had to send something
to the Kansas Supreme Court
and it was like, it
was like in an envelope
that was a square, like here you go.
So thank you.
I really am happy about this.
-  Good job Janae.
What do you guys say?
-  Thank you.
- J House out.
-  You know it's a good toy
when Jeremy wants to try.
(playful Christmas music)
Whoa!
- I could live in these.
I can do everything.
-  We all go a
little strong with the makeup
when we start out.
