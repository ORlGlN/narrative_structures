- I think I'm in quick sand.
(horn music)
- I was kind of shaking
through the whole solo part.
-  That looks pretty good.
(horn music)
- Somebody's been practicing
standing up this morning.
(laughter)
-  Yay!
- She's like I did it, I did it.
-  She's clapping.
Yay!
(clapping)
(laughter)
(clapping and cheering)
- Stand up.
- She said Laura.
-  There she is.
Hi Dad, hi Dad.
You just walking along?
Hi Dad, hi Dad.
Hi Dad.
Well it felt really good to
sleep in our bed last night.
And we're trying to
clean up and do laundry.
- It was so comfy.
I love my bed.
-  It is nice.
Is it good to be home you guys?
- Yeah
- Yeah.
- No.
-  Oh you miss Seattle?
- It's nice to see sunshine.
I really like Seattle and I get that it
doesn't rain there all the time,
but it rained during our whole trip there.
So seeing sunshine I'm
like, oh what is this?
-  Yes, it is nice.
Okay, it's time to pull
out our Christmas stuff.
We're gonna be putting up the lights.
(rock music)
Now I just have to find
which of these tubs
has the lights for outside.
Set it up.
(rock music)
My Christmas vest, how wonderful.
(Jingle Bells)
Now I'm ready to decorate.
So here's all the lights.
Just wanna make sure they
work before I set them up.
(Jingle Bells)
Check it to see if that one works.
- It works.
I'm gonna make something
this afternoon I bet.
-  You gonna fix one?
-  I fixed the others.
-  Just pull it out.
-  That made it a lot darker.
(Deck The Halls)
-  You guys
got the Royals matching
outfit on today.
- We also have the same pants.
-  And the gray shoes.
You guys are just jealous you don't
have a Christmas sweater like I do.
The first thing we gotta do
is straighten out the lights.
At least we kept them separate.
I'm so grateful, it's so warm
and beautiful weather today.
There have been times in the
past when it was pretty cold.
- Well, it's back to
life in reality today.
I'm knee deep in laundry.
I think we're gonna have to do four
or five loads of laundry today.
And the kids are getting
going on their school work.
What ya doing?
- Doing my math.
-  Laura, what are you doing?
- Paint.
-  Paint.
Do you know what kind
of paint this is called?
- What?
-  It's called dot painting.
There's an L.
Here's how you spell your name ready?
-  L
A
U
R
-  And then back to A.
- A.
-  You have two A's in your name.
So you turn it upside down
and then you put the dots in the dots.
(upbeat music)
What letter is that?
- A.
-  You did it.
(upbeat music)
-  Well it's time
to take our fall wreath down
and we'll put up the Christmas one.
(upbeat music)
Isaac wants to climb the
ladder to nail in a nail.
Is it higher up than you thought?
- A lot.
-  You tall enough?
You can come back down if you want.
He's coming down.
(upbeat guitar music)
You guys ready for this?
Alright, so we just stick it on.
(applause)
Perfect.
How do you like our wreath?
- I like it.
Pokey grass on it.
-  It has pokey grass on it.
That's a good description of our wreath.
Is that a Christmasy shirt?
It's Christmas now.
-  It's beautiful.
I like it.
- It feels like the day after Thanksgiving
it's Christmas all the way
until the day after Christmas.
-  You're right.
It's called Christmas season.
(rock music)
- I'm getting used to this.
-  Okay, start pedaling.
(rock music)
- So it is so hard for
me to feel Christmasy
with how warm it is out here.
It is warm, like I might
not even need my jacket.
But I do like listening
to the Christmas bells.
I'm running into Walmart right now
and I'm hoping to get
some rain boots for Isaac
and for myself.
We are going to a creek and
we should have rain boots
to wade in the creek, but we don't.
So it's warm enough, we could probably
do with just flip flops
but I'm hoping that they
have something here.
Alright, here's a whole
bunch of rain boots.
I don't know if they
have kids ones though.
So they go down to size five,
but Isaac's more like a size two.
So I can pick up some for me,
but I hope they have some
in the kid's section.
Jackpot, look at all of these.
Why are rain boots or galoshes
or whatever you wanna
call them so adorable?
Oh my goodness.
Well I can't believe that
worked, that never works.
I came into the store and they
have exactly what I needed.
I think we're all set.
- I feel like penguin or duck.
-  You feel like a duck,
are they awkward to walk in?
Let's see them Isaac.
(piano music)
So it's in the 60s today in Kansas City
and the sun is out so
we had to hit a park.
We're here with some friends.
This is a new park we've
never been to before.
- I can do stuff in galoshes.
-  How's it going Caleb?
- Good.
(piano music)
-  Is it harder in boots?
- Yep.
(piano music)
-  Caleb, I'm so impressed.
Oh, so close.
(horn music)
Watch our Isaac.
Whoa!
(horn music)
(laughter)
Did you almost get wet?
Be careful dude.
Whoa.
How deep are you gonna go Leesy?
(guitar music)
What do you think Laura?
Is it so funny that
you're not getting wet?
We're walking in the water
and we're not getting wet.
She's getting more brave.
She wanted me to let go of her.
Look at you walking.
(guitar music)
- I think I'm in quicksand.
-  Does it look like that to ya?
-  Yeah, watch.
Look at all those clouds I've been making.
-  Clouds of dirt in the water.
The kids are in heaven down here
and I'm really grateful
for the time of year
that we're down here
because there's no bugs.
That's a big rock.
- I can barely even lift it.
-  Alright, what
are you gonna do with it?
- Throw it in.
-  Throw it into the water?
-  Chuck it hard.
(guitar music)
-  Did you get all wet Leesy?
- Yeah.
-  Did you get in there?
Let's see, lift it up.
Cubby, are you in too deep?
Oh no!
Is it full?
Oh no!
I can see how much water
you've got in there.
Is it so cold?
- I can't feel my foot, it's so cold.
-  Yeah, 'cause of the water.
Good one.
I think Jenae's liking it.
She's not complaining.
So we just made it all the way down here.
It was a little bit challenging.
The kids are awesome at this,
I think I'm a little bit more of a wuss.
Laura, you're doing great.
(guitar music)
This is so pretty down here.
Poll question, have
you ever been creeking?
Let me know up here.
What do you think of getting in the creek?
- I like it.
-  How about you Caleb,
what do you think of exploring the creek?
- It's fine.
-  Leesy, what do you
think of exploring the creek?
- I like it.
- So apparently the water in
the creek is pretty low today.
Sometimes this is a big or long waterfall.
Sometimes this whole ledge
right along here is a waterfall.
We'll have to come back and try it again.
We're heading back up through the woods.
- We should have just gone that way.
-  Kind of an adventure,
I don't know where this path goes.
We did it, we found our way back.
(guitar music)
So the kids all got a little bit wet.
Thankfully, before I was leaving
Jeremy said, hey are you taking an extra
change of pants for the kids?
I was like, no, they'll be fine.
He's like, let me grab you some.
So smart Jeremy, he knew
what he was thinking.
I'm gonna have the kids change
into dry pants in the car.
- There's a sunrise right now.
-  There's a sunrise?
Are you sure it's not a sunset.
- Yes, a sunset.
-  There we go 'cause
it's almost dinnertime.
The sun rises in the
morning and sets at night.
-  There we go.
What do you think?
- I love it.
-  That looks pretty good.
- I love it.
(orchestral music)
-  We have lights.
- The kids have their
Christmas concert tonight.
Elise is doing her special solo
so it's time to get us all cleaned up
and into nice clothes and ready to go.
(piano music)
-  So Elise, how are you feeling?
- Good.
-  You have your part coming up.
You nervous at all?
- Not exactly.
But I hope the little
what's it called when
the microphone doesn't go
down while I'm speaking.
Then I won't have to do this.
-  That would be nice.
You made one of these?
Awesome.
So the kids are showing me all the artwork
that they've done thus far over the year.
What did you name it?
- Caleb Jr.
-  Obviously.
- That's what I always name it.
-  Alright, here's Isaac's.
That's cool, is that watercolor?
- Yep, it was actually my silhouette.
-  That's you?
Is that yours?
- Uh huh, I made it.
- I love it.
- It's a lot of yellow.
(kids singing)
-  Good luck.
(kids singing)
♪ You are my hope ♪
♪ You are my light ♪
♪ You are my everything ♪
♪ You make me want to sing ♪
♪ I adore you tiny baby ♪
♪ I adore you ♪
- I was kind of shaking
through the whole solo part.
-  You did great.
That sweater looks great.
(kids singing)
(applause)
-  Goodnight, J House out.
-  Cool.
- Santa Clauses are going in.
-  This is for J House vlogs.
-  Is that a house?
- It's awesome.
