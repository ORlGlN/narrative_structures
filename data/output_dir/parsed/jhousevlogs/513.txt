I guess I'm beautiful you just read down
from the house of the water bottles I've
already tired so we're going on a hike
this morning in the family so the kids
are looking on the rocks to try to see
think of my Native American parking zone
I found Prairie doc ooh good job
Michelle
prairie dog food she's a native old
ruler she knows her way around so this
hiking path is just behind the candy
creek house that we're staying at it's
gorgeous
Hey yep it's right there do you see it I
don't know maybe it's a picture of a man
eating a Big Mac hey let's helping me
down this part
what's fun is that when I was a kid I
would come and play in this Canyon
there's a creek down here that we would
go in and try to catch fish with our
hands right here and but now my mom
bought some property that is right on
top of the canyon and so we're right off
of her her property here serious so you
own this so my mom actually bought
property that is along the creek bed so
that's exciting there's a beaver dam
apparently we can get closer to the
water going down this way you found a
trap you guys are like in a fort kind of
area so we discovered a trap what kind
of a trap is that I set for coyote and
is tied here to the willows but it's
been sprung because this these two jaws
come up I don't try to spread the jaws
apart it's always nice to have Keith
with us

love being outside and doing this kind
of stuff with our kids and with our
family like it just feels good we're
attempting to take a family picture

so I grew up in the city when I was
younger but then when my parents got
divorced my mom married a rancher and we
moved to this small town in northern
Arizona and I'm so grateful that a part
of my childhood was just playing in the
canyon and exploring and playing in the
creek and climbing around these cliffs I
had so much fun exploring and building
and making forts and so I'm excited to
give our kids at least a taste of that
when they come and visit I climbed up
over there through the trees and over at
the pond and then we're at the creek
again dad I love the sunset
isn't it beautiful today teaching me how
to trust and obey and these days
crystal love is spoken here I cannot
feel that save me tonight Junior Seau
