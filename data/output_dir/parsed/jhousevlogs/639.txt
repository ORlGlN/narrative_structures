good morning friends
we are safe and warm and dry in a hotel
in New Mexico but unfortunately we're a
bit stranded with the snow there's quite
a blizzard all right so we started going
crazy and so we decided to have some fun
she got killed by a one-year-old well
clearly this is the J house blizzard
Olympics all right now it's the
basketball challenge okay let's do this
is the awesome shot sock Hotel
straightener blizzard challenge
- - good lord my boy what yeah okay in
the New Mexico Winter Olympics our next
competition is the balancing the tre
competition obstacle obstacle course we
have a lease from Kansas City Missouri
going next so she has to balance that
Trish she goes through an obstacle
course so here's our car you can see
though they haven't cleared out this
parking lot I try to find some food
this line is moving really really slow
okay hopefully they don't like run out
of food by the time they get out there
so we decided to let the kids get their
wiggles out for a minute so we came out
here while dad goes and tries to pick up
some dinner or lunch I guess for us at
the gas station because that's what's
open the problem is we got left out of
our room so now when we just get to wait
for dad out here this day just keeps
getting better and better
or get stuck just trying to go in and
out of our hotel so I don't mind the
snow or being in a hotel with my family
but the saddest part about this for me
is that I'm missing all of the fun times
with my family like every time we get
together we are playing games and we
stay up late talking about life and I
just love hanging out with them and so
they're all together doing all those
things and I'm missing out on it and my
kids are getting to interact with their
kids that's the sad loss of what's going
on here can you pet her oh so good
say hello doggy hello doggy the kids are
getting really stir-crazy and Caleb and
Laura wouldn't nap at all and so they're
just like but we're tired going nuts hmm
you crawlin we're trying to use the
hallway we are oh you two boys huh
when she does and then
and point your toes and back okay arms
it did you chose aren't yet where I fell
off the bed a little bit ago so she's
got a bump and a bruise on her head
Laurie want to show us your alley and
it's showing us show him your alley
hey you need more eyes yeah okay the
weather looks like there's a chance you
might be able to leave tomorrow morning
but we might still be camping out here
so I'm trying not to get discouraged
about that and yeah we're doing all
right where we going to see how long
this lasts here whole-body did it he's
stuck don't lose a shoe so remember in
Scouting there were a couple times we
went out where you actually build a snow
cave like you dig into snowdrifts and
you sleep at night in the snow cave I
did that a couple times really fun
dive into it I dare you yeah you got a
little bit snowy looking it lives hot
chocolate playing in the snow you guys
are living the dream we've all been
together in this room too long I think
I'm gonna go shovel some snow Caleb was
just been crying crying this is the boy
this day and we're kids there's a pretty
big snowdrift right behind our car so we
have this one car here that's stuck in
the parking lot and the big snow plow
that's coming isn't gonna be able to
clear it out for everybody else if we
aren't able to get this car back in so
that's what we're doing right now trying
to get it ready to push back in hey
ready 1 2 3
we got it Ilyas pushing the car in
there we go the job team here comes the
tractor oh we might have to push the
tractor so one of the crazy things about
this trip is that we keep hearing about
people who weren't able to get a hotel
room they're still like either stranded
out on the road or they just found their
way into town and so although it's been
frustrating to be stranded at least
we're in a hotel that's a lot better
than some people situations
you drive I could drive all night we're
gonna get there without a right we can
have we can drive with your driver
every one of our road trip videos has
bedrest singing some insane song
