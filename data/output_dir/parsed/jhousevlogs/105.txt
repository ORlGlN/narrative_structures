(energetic music)
My name is Queen Esile.
All of my dating Mom is in this journal.
This is the recommended way
to dry your nails, right?
So she's graduating to this toy.
-  So you're writing
about your Disneyland trip?
(energetic music)
(kids yelling)
-  I'm the king of the world.
I'm the queen of the world!
(Laura singing)
(kids laughing)
Sprinkles!
So.
My name is Queen Esile.
My name is King Peter.
Princess Elena!
Pepper.
This is Pepper.
That's Alice.
-  So what are you guys writing?
We're writing people's names so that
it's a thing that we do every year.
And every year, for my birthday party
we have 1,100 people.
Is everybody here yet?
-  Not yet!
Two hours more then they will all be here.
Take a nap.
(Laura singing)
(peaceful music)
(bin opening)
So I'm sharing a lesson in church
and there's an experience that I remember
in one of my journals that I wrote
when I was about 19 years old,
and I can't find it anywhere
so I'm starting to dig through the boxes.
(energetic music)
So I've looked for over an hour.
I went up and talked to Kendra
and she was like, have you
prayed for help to find it?
And I hadn't so I got the kids together
and we knelt down and we prayed.
I think that's an interesting
concept of how we look to God,
like I always want to
feel really independent,
like I'm gonna try to
do everything myself.
I can get things done.
But then, there's also
that principle of humility,
like I'm willing to turn to
a greater source for help.
I realize I have limitations,
I can't do everything.
I don't know everything.
And I think that that
is a powerful reminder
and that there can be divine help.
Even with something that can
seem really insignificant,
like finding a journal.
I have a sense it's gonna be in that box.
So it looks like you guys
turned your throne into a bed.
Yeah.
Today's a day of rest for us.
-  And you got a dress on!
(Caleb yelling)
(energetic music)
(kids running)
Ooh.
(box slamming down)
Yes.
So here's my journal
from before that time.
This is a journal I
began on Christmas, 1994.
Today was Christmas.
It was awesome!
I'm so glad that I kept a
journal during this time.
So this journal was right during the time
that my parents got
separated and then divorced
and I was bounced around
from different schools
and different houses.
It leads all the way up
through the third of December,
fifth of December, 2000.
So up through high school.
So this journal is from the time
I was about 12 years old until 18.
That's a big deal.
Poll question, do you keep a journal?
So the experience I'm
wanting to share in church
is about a time where I felt
like God had really led us
to connect with someone
and to meet with someone,
and that it wasn't just a coincidence.
So this journal was just of
my senior year at high school.
I wanna go through and read these.
(majestic music)
You painting fingernails?
Uh huh.
-  Oh, fun.
We have stickers to put them on.
(majestic music)
-  What are you girls doing?
Trying to get our nails to dry.
-  Drying 'em off?
This is the recommended way
to dry your nails, right?
Kind of.
Looks like I painted them but I didn't.
-  Put little stickers on there?
(energetic music)
So Laura, why do you like
getting your fingernails painted?
Because it's so fun!
(energetic music)
(Laura yelling)
(record scratching)
In the poll, do you love
to dance in the kitchen?
(Jeremy laughs)
So poll question, do you
love to dance in the kitchen?
Good question.
(hands clapping together)
Boom.
Laura reminds me of Miranda Sings,
with how she moves her body sometimes.
Are you kidding me?
Well this morning, we are
packing up the baby jumper.
Janae's not using it
anymore, she's not interested
in being stationary in a jumper.
She wants to be crawling
around and exploring
and pulling herself up to stand
on everything that she can.
So, right now it's just taking up space,
which means it's time to
pack it up and put it away,
but it's kind of emotional doing that
because every single one
of my kids has used it.
We bought it for Isaac when
he was about six months old,
and then we've packed
it away and stored it
between every child, and
so to pack it away again,
it just kind of tugs at my heart strings.
I love watching my kids grow up,
I love seeing the new things they do
but it's also always a little tender
and it gets me emotional
because I love my kids fiercely
and while it's beautiful
to watch them grow,
it can also be a little
bit painful sometimes.
(soft music)
Well we discovered that
our niece, Elizabeth,
can actually use this toy and so now
I feel much better packing
it up because I know
it's going somewhere
special and purposeful.
Now I feel really good about it.
Is this toy fun again now
that it's on the floor?
So she's graduating to this toy.
I don't even remember
what these are called.
She's gonna love it.
Hey, 'Nae, what's this?
(playful music)
It's the perfect size for her!
(playful music)
(baby making noises)
(toy playing music)
-  Are you dancin'?
(toy playing music)
(laughing)
She's dancin'!
She's dancin'!
(laughing)
She's serious about this one.
So this toy is something
that we've given to our kids
usually when they're about a year old.
She's just already ready to be
standin' up and walking around.
I think it definitely is that she wants
to keep up with the big kids.
Nae Nae has the best dance moves ever.
She dances like Elvis
Presley but even better!
Shake those knees!
So since I was digging through
and found all my journals
and my baby book, I wanted
to show it to my kids.
That's me in the hospital.
(smooching)
-  That doesn't look like you.
(baby crying)
(Jeremy laughing)
I got a little chunky.
-  There it is.
Look, that's my mum and dad.
That looks like Papi Rod.
That is Papi Rod and Granny Joe.
-  There's baby Jeremy!
Hey, you guys, look.
Those are my hand prints right there.
Look how much bigger my hand is now.
Whoa.
Who's that?
That's Julie!
And me!
All of the pictures of me
were pretty not smiley,
I was just like.
Really?
Julie is older than you?
Yeah, Julie's my older sister.
Oh look!
There's one of me smiling.
'Kay, so now I'm getting
a little bit older here.
-  I always loved this one.
So Jeremy was very blond as a child.
So we often get asked how
Laura has her blonde hair.
It's because Jeremy was
really blond as a kid.
I liked to play with hammers.
What were you doing with the hammers?
And I liked to be in cars and fix things
when I was little, just like you, Cubby.
I liked to play dress-up.
I loved football even as a little kid.
With the football hat!
Why do they show you in
the bath all the time?
My mom wanted to show a
picture of what it was like
when my body was covered in chicken pox.
-  You got chicken pox
when you were four years old?
Four months old.
This is when I moved to
live at the mud house.
And then in high school I
wrote even more, in here.
And then when I lived
in Canada for two years,
I wrote about that.
When I went to college and I met Mom
and all of my dating
Mom is in this journal.
-  Oh, I wanna read--
I wanna do the same thing
but where do I get all the paper?
We could get you a journal.
Woo!
Dude, you have a journal.
-  So last Christmas, Granny Joe
got you guys all journals.
I got so much!
So you have one.
You just need to start writing in 'em.
Is this one mine?
Yup!
That's yours.
In my family growing
up, we had a tradition
on Sunday evenings where
we would all sit down
and write in our journals together.
It was like family journal time.
In other news, I got new earrings.
Check these out!
Apparently they're called ear crawlers.
-  I think it looks good.
I like 'em!
And it goes with the choker,
at least I think it does,
'cause when I wear a choker I never know
what earrings to wear so.
Feeling excited in my new earrings.
One of the things that really drew me
to YouTube and vlogging is
that it is a lot like a journal
and I love that we can go back--
Dad, this is my eraser.
And watch stuff that happened.
Is that your eraser?
You writin' in your journal?
-  Yeah.
How about you tell me what to say
and I'll write it down for you, okay?
Alright, what do you wanna put?
Uh, I love you, Dad.
Right here.
 Love you, Dad.
(playful music)
(fridge running)
Our fridge is making a concerning noise.
I am seven years old,
and I am seeing, seeing,
singing in a choir and I got a group solo.
I am happy.
Caleb.
This is when, this is
about when I was five.
My Dad told me about when he was
four months old to two years old.
-  You know, one of
the things with a journal
is you can put in the
journal stuff that happened,
but it's also important
to write your feelings.
How are you feeling about
things in your life.
No, I don't like that.
Okay.
(joyful music)
Our kids are talking to
Granny Joe on the phone.
Uh huh.
(voice speaking through telephone)
In like a singing choir.
-  It's Papi Keith!
Hi, Papi Keith!
-  So, tell us
what's in your journal, bud.
I had no idea, we opened a box.
They told me we are going to Disneyland.
I freaked out.
We went on a plane.
On the plane, we watched
movies and ate some food.
We had fun.
It was fun at Disneyland.
We did rides and ate treats.
It was fun.
-  So you're writing
about your Disneyland trip?
We had a lots of fun.
-  That's awesome, buddy!
Yep.
Abra cadabra!
Abra cadabra!
Huzza pu--
Hocus pocus.
Hocus pocus!
What is your car?
-  I love you girls.
-  I love you too.
-  Have a good night, okay?
'Kay, good night.
J House out.
♪ Good night ♪
♪ J House out ♪
♪ J House ♪
Out.
So my sister-in-law Michelle just came up
with the most genius
thing for bike riding.
Dad, sometimes I call you Jeremy
and sometimes I call Mom Kendra.
Snuggle season.
(taco crunching)
-  Crunchy.
-  I saw you in the first place!
So Nae Nae is doing the cutest thing.
There's a new deli.
And I got a Big Nasty.
(energetic music)
