(Janae cooing)
- Hi guys.
-  Hi guys.
(bright music)
(hammering)
- I wanted to weigh this.
- Tonight is bring your
parent to ballet night.
- What if our house was made out of candy?
- Hello.
- Yeah, he's right over the corner.
- Isaac and Elise,
what are you really doing?
- I'm playing with Janae.
- I'm keeping warm with my dress.
-  Aw, I wish I could do that.
-  Did you guys hear that noise?
The chirping?
- The fire alarm.
-  We have a fire alarm
that's battery is chirping.
Luckily it didn't happen
in the middle of the night,
but we need to fix it this morning.
- In real life, in houses, do fire go on?
-  Sometimes
there are fires in houses.
- When do fire alarms don't go on
in these kinds of houses.
-  Well if we don't have a fire,
then a fire alarm doesn't go off.
So I'm trying to figure
out if it's the smoke alarm
in the boy's bedroom
or the one right here in our hallway.
Which one is it?
(battery beeping)
- That one.
-  You think it's this one?
(crying)
- I need a new battery.
-  Are you
feeling nervous about it?
- Yeah.
-  We're gonna
fix it right now, okay?
(lively music)
- So Laura, the fire alarms are just there
to help keep us safe.
- But when fire alarms go on
in these kinds of houses?
- Yeah, if there's a fire.
So the fire alarm just
watches all the time
to make sure we're safe.
- I want to move today.
- Yeah, you feeling nervous?
- Yeah.
- Since the bad storm when the trampoline
got thrown around, Laura's just been
a little bit more nervous.
She's been pretty
concerned about our house,
how strong it is.
But Laura, we're safe.
- What happens if there's fire in houses?
- If there's fire in houses,
then the fire alarms go off
and they make a really loud sound,
so that you know, they hey,
there's a fire in your house somewhere,
get out, get out, so you stay safe.
So then we leave our house
and we call the fire department,
and the comes and takes care of the fire.
And then we say, thank
you fire department.
- But is there gonna be fire in our house?
- Nope, there's not gonna
be a fire in our house.
- When are we gonna move?
- We're gonna move someday.
-  Probably.
- Maybe today.
- Probably not today.
-  If we go to another house,
it's gonna have fire alarms, too.
- What kind of house do you want?
- I want a new one to build far away.
- Do you think it'd be fun to have
a house with pink inside of it?
- Sure.
- Oh, what if our house
was made out of candy
and you could eat our house?
(playful piano music)
- We could get candy
and just put it inside.
- Candy inside the house, great idea.
- But don't put fire on it.
-  No fire.
-  We love you Laura.
We're keeping you safe, okay?
-  Alright, we're to the point
of the Pinewood Derby for painting.
(tropical beat music)
- Wow, the tape really worked.
-  Alright, so
now you can paint the top.
(lively music)
- That really looks good.
- Oh that does look good.
-  There you go.
- I think it looks pretty good.
-  You did a great job.
So Isaac is cleaning out the paint.
(drill humming)
- Hi.
-  Hi.
(Janae vocalizing)
- So Isaac and Caleb and
I have been sitting here
across the room from Janae,
waving at her, saying hi,
and she's putting her
arm up next to her head
and going, hi.
It's so cute.
I'm gonna see if I can
try to get her to do it
in front of the camera.
-  Hi.
(Janae vocalizing)
-  Can you say hi?
Hi.
She's on the phone (laughs).
- Hi.
-  Oh I heard it.
-  Hi.
- Hi guys.
- Hi guys.
Well we've run into a few stresses
with the Pinewood Derby car.
And of course, today's the day it's due,
and so we're running out of time.
They're doing a really great job,
but there's been some frustrating moments,
which that just happens
in projects like this.
- This is just so small
that the wood actually broke
when I was putting in his wheel,
so we're gonna have to fix that.
And we're running out of time.
-  Do you think we can do it?
- Yeah, we have like over four hours.
(lively music)
- I don't know if this is gonna be
a car that works at all.
There are several things
we made mistakes on,
but it was fun to work
with Isaac to make it.
- Yep.
-  So what are you guys doing?
- I'm gonna build this.
And Elise is gonna build one.
And I'm gonna have friends build one,
and then after that, I'm
gonna have my friends
help me build a track.
-  Build a Pinewood Derby track?
- Yep.
- We still have a lot more work to do.
(bright music)
I like how bananas in
smoothies make it creamy.
-  Yes, it's very good.
Do you guys want some?
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
(whirring)
(laughing)
-  Zero.
I already got mine.
-  You already got a straw?
- Thank you Dad so much,
I really appreciate it.
-  No problem.
-  Is it creamy?
- I like creamy things.
- 21, 22,
-  Oh, everybody's joining in.
- 25, 26, 27,
- It hurts my tummy.
- That's the idea.
- It can.
-  Here we go.
- That hurts.
-  Do a push
up Laura, you go down.
- It hurts so bad.
Let's see if I got stronger.
I think I did.
- What she makes us do, is you have to go
(laughing)
- They always make
exercising more effective.
Your arms need to come
to a right triangle.
There you go.
- 12, 14, 15.
-  Nailed it.
- Welcome to my shell store.
You can pick whatever
These ones are baby ones.
These shells will get an animal soon.
- Can I buy this one?
- Sure.
Thank you
- How much dollars is it?
- Two dollars.
- Here you go.
- So it's Janae's nap time right now,
so I'm in serious multi-task mode.
I'm cooking dinner, I'm
making dinner for a friend
that just had some surgery.
So I'm making a big double batch tonight.
And I'm also baking cookies
to take to the same family.
So hopefully in my attempt to multi-task,
I don't burn the cookies or the dinner.
(shattering dish)
(gentle music)
This is really sad.
It was in front of this,
and I was trying to pull this out and
So this bowl actually
was really special to me.
Jeremy and I made bowls on a date
sometime in our first year of marriage,
I don't remember the exact time,
and we went to a ceramic studio
and I'd never been to one before
and we painted them,
and I really have enjoyed it.
Jeremy and I usually,
in the evening after the kids are in bed,
get out these bowls and have
a scoop of ice cream together.
So, it's just kind of sentimental.
But it is just a bowl,
that's all it is, is a bowl.
And Elise had a great idea.
She said, Mom, let's go make new bowls.
And that would be really fun,
we've never done that with the kids.
What's the matter?
- Dad is 35 and that's too big?
- Dad's 35 and that's too big?
Too big for what?
- What's going on?
-  You're too old Dad.
- I'm too old?
-  You're 35 and that's too old.
- Aww, I know (laughs).
(Kendra laughs)
I'm sorry it's happening so fast.
Oh so pretty.
(hammering)
(edgy rock music)
- I did it too tight.
(rolling)
-  Nice.
-  Daddy?
(rolling)
- I put a wheel on and a fourth wheel on
and put some weights on.
-  Nice, did you use
Play-Doh for your weight?
- Mmm-mmm.
-  That's smart.
This is a fantastic
Pinewood Derby car, Caleb.
It's so smooth.
I absolutely love this kid.
He's so determined, like he
puts his mind to something,
and he just does it.
He's creative and hard working,
boom.
(rolling)
The girls are working together,
what are you guys making?
- Cornbread.
-  Are you helping Laura?
- It's a special recipe
and it tastes like cake.
-  It's amazing and it's a mix,
but we like things from mixes.
-  Woop!
-  That's okay.
There's an old saying that says,
don't cry over spilt milk.
(groovy upbeat music)
- Just a little bit like that.
-  You still
have one more ingredient,
Lise, which ingredient?
- Egg, one egg.
-  What temperature do
I need to put the oven on to?
- 400 and F.
-  400 degrees Fahrenheit.
Elise, you did amazing.
The family we're taking this
to is gonna really like it.
Alright, so should we
put these in the oven?
Well the meal that we're
taking over tonight,
we call Frito Pie.
It's a recipe from Jeremy's mom,
and he loves it and all my kids love it
and I love it.
You top this with cheese
and then you also top it with lettuce
and tomatoes, and I got
some fresh cilantro,
so we're doing that with cornbread
and what's that thing?
Chocolate chip cookies.
So this is super embarrassing.
(playful music)
I just was snacking on a cookie
and I was sitting here thinking,
wait, I've already snacked on a cookie,
why am I snacking on another cookie?
Then I counted it up,
I've had five cookies.
Now mind you, those are little cookies,
but still five.
And I was like, why do
I keep eating cookies?
And I realized why.
It's because I forgot to eat breakfast
or lunch, like I've been go go go all day,
and I'm starving,
and so I kept nibbling
on what I was making.
Ah, I hate that feeling.
Like I hate how that makes my body feel.
I got out some salad,
and I'm gonna have some salad right now.
So when life gets really busy,
don't forget to take care of yourself.
Don't forget to feed your body.
Alright, these are all
ready to go in the oven.
And now they're out of the oven.
It's time to go deliver the food
and guess what, I'm on time.
(applause)
-  Thanks for doing that Kendra.
- This friend of mine,
the day she found out
I was pregnant with Janae,
without even asking,
she brought dinner to our family.
And I was really morning sick at the time,
and it was the first homemade
meal we'd had in awhile,
so I owe her one.
(upbeat electronic music)
- I'm going to ballet
and we can bring a parent.
- Tonight is bring your
parent to ballet night.
- And the parent gets to watch.
-  And we get to dance, too.
- Really?
- I hope so.
I brought my dancing shoes.
(upbeat electronic music)
(slap)
(lively classical music)
So what'd you think of that?
- I liked it.
I'm doing the skip turn
that I wanted you to do.
- Well that was so fun.
I love dancing with you.
Maybe I should stretch more.
That's the takeaway from that.
(lively rock music)
So Caleb, why'd you come tonight?
- Because I wanted to weigh this.
-  Seeing what it weighs?
- Mmm-mmm.
-  Let's see how much it is.
You gotta hang it upside down.
- Two.
-  Okay, so we
need some coins on there.
So how'd the weigh in go.
- Good!
- The most you can get is 5.0
and I got that.
-  Yep you did, well once we added
a bunch of change.
- Yeah.
- Goodnight, J House out.
-  You are editing a vlog.
Do you like it?
-  So my awesome
Aunt Kay sent us this kit.
So Jeremy and I are trying to make
an important decision today.
I'm just, I still don't
know what we should do.
- All my kids are hiding.
- How did you know?
(bright music)
