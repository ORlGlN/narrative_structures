so I know what this makes a little bit
hold for me in exciting and scary well
it is 11:30 at night and I am
contracting and we're currently trying
to decide if it's time to go to the
hospital or if these are going to go
away my contractions started about two
maybe three hours ago I went shopping to
Target with my mom we were just picking
up a few things and I had a few
contractions and the last one it was
pretty hard and I said let's just go
home I'm going to put my feet up so then
we come home and the contractions aren't
super consistent but they're really
intense when they come and so I can't
decide how long to wait on that so I
wish I had a magic crystal ball that
could tell me when this little girl's
gonna come so with the contractions I'm
getting a warm bath going to try to help
tender
contractions seem to be really intense
for Kendra I think she might be
progressing the labor well it is mental
1:00 a.m. and my contractions are
becoming more regular there about every
10 minutes apart all right well it is
definitely time to go what's good
we just kicked into hospital and seven
centimeters and the contractions are
definitely strong so until the emotional
because my last several ladies from
seven to baby at them really fast and so
I know what this next little bit holds
for me and as exciting and scary one of
the three persons of the doctor is in
here in between contractions I can smile
and
hey bit unnerving the job
it was Emily Larson successfully oh my
life like mine looks perfect
you're on the outside of me kickin me
now it's a little bit rough huh
he's got the magic touch spell calm down
I'm so proud of Kendra and I love our
new little baby girl the kids are gonna
love her
Kendra was just making sure that she had
all of her he knows everything
oh are you thinking about having some
Munich we've gotten to get a little bit
of bread and she so far has been a
really good years but we're looking
forward to a day of snuggling and
sweeping and feeling together okay
