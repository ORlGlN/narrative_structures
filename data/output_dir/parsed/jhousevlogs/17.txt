- I'm so glad that we vlog to document
important life moments
like this one right here.
-  More.
-  More.
(upbeat music)
Hi.
-  Did you move
all of these yourself?
-  Yup.
- This morning, when she saw me
for the first time she was so happy.
She made the cutest little face.
I missed you big girl.
(baby noises)
Who's that?
Who's that beautiful baby?
A Birthday for Cow.
(kids laughing)
- She's like ah!
-  She's all over the place.
(girl laughing)
(Jeremy laughing)
-  Baby signing time.
- She's learning.
Janae is starting to
wanna communicate more
but she doesn't know how to so were gonna
be teaching her more and
more baby sign language.
- Shoes!
-  She knows this one.
Shoes.
- Shoes.
-  Shoes.
- Like a pair of shoes.
-  She's doin' it!
-  You're turn.
-  She's looking at everybody.
- Shoes.
-  Yeah, they're all doing it.
Shoes.
Yeah.
- Shoes.
- (laughing) She said shoes.
-  Socks.
Yeah, socks.
- Socks.
- Socks.
-  Sign socks.
-  Janae's gonna have so many
little teachers growing
up, maybe too many.
(laughing)
- Donuts?
- Donuts!
- Here's the donuts and
I got some donut holes.
I don't know why I like
donut holes so much.
They're just donuts, just
smaller, but I like them.
They're just, like, cute.
- Wow.
- Mmmm.
- Poll question, do you prefer donuts
with cream inside or just regular?
Is there a big bird out there?
- A robin came.
-  Oh cool.
- It's a big deal.
Robins are a sign of spring
and robins are starting
to show up at our bird feeder.
We just ate donuts, but I've actually been
spending the morning thinking about
some of the health goals and fitness stuff
that Jeremy and I want to get into.
We're feeling like it's
time to reset our bodies
and just feel healthier inside.
I'm making a smoothie which
has got some great ingredients
but I was looking at that
donut and eating it like,
"Okay, this is like a last supper."
I need to get ready to move
on into some good new habits
that will serve my body
and my mind better.
But, oh man, donuts taste good.
(Kendra laughing)
- Shoes.
Shoes.
-  These two have a special bond.
-  What did you do out here?
Is this your little barricaded fort?
- Yeah.
-  Did you move
all of these yourself?
-  Yup!
-  These are big pieces of wood.
What are you gonna do
in your fort all alone?
- I'm gonna let all my friends in.
-  Alright, have fun.
(cheerful music)
- See this one's good.
Now I need to keep nailing in this one.
So no one can just walk
right through here.
(upbeat music)
- Caleb, you wanna come step on it?
- Mhm.
-  Then what do you want
to do with that to make it smooth?
- Sand it!
-  You can sand that down.
- I wanna saw more.
It's so fun.
-  Just remember
if you ever wanna do sawing
who do you need to ask right now?
- You.
-  Yup, I'll help you out, okay?
(rhythmic music)
-  Returning
books, returning books.
Did you find some books?
(baby noises)
Hi!
Doesn't she look so grown up?
Oh my goodness.
- Hi!
- Hi piggy!
Hey!
The library is like a
whole new world to Janae.
We haven't been with her in a little while
and with her learning to walk
she's just experiencing it
in a whole different way.
We're headed to Isaac's basketball game.
- Oh yeah!
Pump the bass!
-  You need to
get your head in the game.
- (kid singing) Get ya,
get ya head in the game.
Ya got get ya, get ya, get
ya, get ya head in the game.
(upbeat electronic music)
-  Today they
had all of the players
invite their teachers from school
and Isaac invited his PE teacher.
(baby noises)
Go get mom!
Get her!
- Peek-a-boo!
Hi! (laughing)
-  Hey.
-  Who's that?
Go get daddy.
-  Hey! (laughing)
(Janae laughing)
A goo goo.
- Go!
(girls screaming)
With the weather just starting to warm up
this is one of Janae's first times
on a slide and she loves it.
One, two, three, go!
(girls screaming)
-  Oh!
-  Go!
-  More.
-  More.
-  More.
- More?
Again?
(girls giggling)
-  That's a big step.
- Janae is truly becoming a toddler.
She's just barely 12 months.
She thinks she's a big girl.
(cheerful music)
- Yeah!
-  Whoa.
They are swing dancing.
(boys laughing)
- We invented swing dancing.
Well I did.
- And I'm the second inventor of it.
-  Awesome.
You know it's funny, there is actually
a style of dance called swing dancing.
- I know, there is.
I was like, "Mom, I invented
something called swing dance."
"There's something already like that."
(Jeremy laughing)
And I was like, no we do it on swings.
(Jeremy laughing)
- I'm working on swing dancing.
I'm way better at the other kind.
-  Normal dancing?
- Oh look dad!
- Last fall we planted some bulbs
for tulips to come up this spring
and so we've had enough warm days in a row
that I had to come out and check
and see if they're growing.
They're not yet, but I wonder how many
warm days in a row we
need before they grow.
Jeremy and I went on a drive as part of
our date night tonight and we've just been
taking a ton and now we are
at a restaurant, Corner Cafe.
We're having some dinner.
We both ordered salad so I guess
that's our first attempt
towards healthiness,
but I'm mostly just hoping that
a motorcycle doesn't
fall on Jeremy's head.
See?
It's just there.
- I don't know that this is
very healthy but it tastes good.
-  It has the word salad in it.
and you're drinking water,
that's worth points.
- We both decided we're just gonna
eat half of it here and
take half of it home.
-  For lunch tomorrow.
- Yeah, so it's easier to put it
in the to-go box before we start.
-  Because look
how big these salads are.
They're huge!
This is half of my salad, what?
-  That heavenly smell.
Going into Bath and Body Works.
- It's pineapple mango.
The problem with this
one is I wanna drink it.
This would be an amazing smoothie.
- We were just saying how
there's something magical
about a really good smelling,
high quality hand soap at a bathroom.
It's special.
My feminine side is coming out.
- Is that just us?
- Bath and Body Works.
- They have a soap testing station.
At least that's what we hope this is for.
(Jeremy laughing)
Hey, that coconut one's really good.
You know you found a good
husband when he's willing to
come smell all the things at
Bath and Body Works with you.
Smell it.
- Mmm, I don't like that one as much.
- He's so cute.
I'm so glad that we vlog to document
important life moments
like this one right here.
I, Kendra, have made a
decision before Jeremy.
I'm the more decisive one.
I'm ready to go.
My stuffs ready at the counter
and he's still deciding.
(squeaky voice) Oh look at him!
- There's so many good smells.
-  I know, what are
you gonna do? (laughing)
Classic Jeremy move, pick up some
random one that you haven't even tried.
- Love it.
(both laughing)
-  He's back at it
washing his hands some more.
- This is the cherry blossom,
it's like a classic smell here.
The random one that I
picked up to leave with
is my favorite one of all of 'em.
It's like a really strong cherry smell.
-  It smells so good.
Let's show 'em the one.
-  It's right here.
Cherry.
That was fun.
- Are you following me?
-  I'm your date.
-  Goodnight.
J House out.
-  Happy birthday big girl.
Here they come, the main event.
-  Whoa.
(cheerful music)
-  Yay!
Happy birthday to you!
