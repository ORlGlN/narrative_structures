so if there was a war between a cat and
a cucumber who would win
why why would a cat win because they
could you see yeah do you think cats
would be scared of cucumbers so I put
work yesterday someone showed me the cat
verse cucumber video and I knew that I
had to show my kids this and get their
reaction
what was eating and then it looked
behind it and then it jumped up onto the
big comfy chain Heidi he wants to watch
it again alright guys so who wants to
give this a try
I just want to go see how a cat feels
about a cucumber yeah
Kimmy you're not scared of cucumbers are
you all right so what happened they
didn't react they didn't do anything
yeah yeah wrong with these cats
it's okay lebar all cats scared of
cucumbers no no just some of them huh
all right so we decided to have some fun
this afternoon and imagine what it would
be like if humans were scared of
cucumbers
