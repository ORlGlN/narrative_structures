(singing, drumming)
-  Thanks for helping, Elise.
How's it going, dude?
(energetic music)
- We sleep in our costumes, right, Caleb?
-  Mm-hmm.
- But not in your blanket, right?
- Mnm-hmn.
(Janae vocalizes)
-  Hi, little boy.
-  She likes tapping it.
(children giggle)
- So today is our last
full day here in San Diego,
and I am so sad about it,
I feel like I'm leaving
a little piece of my
heart behind in the city
and in this house, it's just been a really
special and wonderful trip for our family.
So, we're doing our best to
fill today with wonderfulness,
I'm starting off the morning
with a walk with my big kids.
You guys enjoying the tree this morning?
-  Yeah.
-  Do you wanna get down
and go on a quick walk with me?
-  No.
-  Sure!
-  Isaac doesn't
want to go on the walk,
he just wants to stay in the tree forever.
So my goal for today is to
stay outside all day long.
See if that works.
Let's go.
- One, two, ready, go!
- A B C D E F G...

- So what kind of bowl is this?
-  It's a pitaya bowl.
- Pitaya bowl, it's so pretty.
-  It is, it's really gorgeous.
- It's really good.
-  I think pitaya,
it's a dragonfruit I think?
Oh, I might be wrong.
So we're having one last acai bowl. Yum!
This one's called a Lotta
Beta, so it's got beets in it,
and spinach and all sorts of goodness.
- Beets taste like candy to me.
-  Do they?
- Uh-huh.
-  Yours has beets
in it, too, do you like it?
-  Uh-huh.
-  You like it buddy?
- Uh-huh.
(funky twangy music)
-  Magnetic!
-  So even our sand,
if you look at our sand here.
-  The sand is picked up.
- It's got magnetite in it,
so it picks up the magnetite.
- The magnetite, that's amazing.
- So we're spending some time this morning
at the Torrey Pines Nature Reserve.
They have some beautiful hikes and views.
Oh, head down.
(relaxed music)
Anytime I'm on a hike,
it's my natural feeling
to try to run to the end.
Kendra does a better job of, like,
looking at each plaque along the way
and talking about the
different plants and animals.
Yeah, I need to do better
at enjoying the journey
and not just running to a destination.
But it's so fun!
- So Janae will not
keep her hat on at all,
so I'm trying to block her.
-  With the paper.
- With the paper to keep her in the shade.
(energetic music)
-  I think my
favorite is looking down
at the water and seeing
all the different colors.
- Dad, come on!
- Although we went to
the bathroom right before
we started the hike,
Caleb really has to go,
so we're gonna quickly
get back to the bathrooms.
- So this reminds me
of Annie's Canyon Trail
that we hiked earlier in our trip.
Oh, this is gorgeous.
The sandstone is just amazing.
So I just had an interesting
moment with Laura.
She keeps getting really
close to the cactus,
and I said, "Laura, stay
away from the cactus.
"Stay away from the cactus."
Over and over again.
Finally, she turns around, she says,
"Mom, what is a cactus?"
And I'm like oh my goodness!
I didn't even realize that
she didn't know what that was.
So then we stopped, and
I pointed out a cactus,
and we talked about the
needles, and anyway,
it's just funny how sometimes
kids can seem disobedient,
but really we just maybe haven't explained
our instructions well enough.
Good job.
Here it is, a Torrey pine.
That is amazing.
So apparently, Torrey pines are a special
kind of pine tree that only grow here
and in an island that's off of
Santa Barbara in California.
Their roots grow so shallow and spread out
that they're able to capture
moisture from the fog.
So Caleb's trying to
match the different skulls
of different local
animals to the pictures.
-  I think these can go here.
-  Good job.
And the bobcat only eats animals.
-  Oh, so this
one's probably the coyote?
And the raccoon probably is here.
-  Yeah,
the raccoon will eat--
-  There.
-  Yup, yup, perfect.
-  You did it.
So when we first arrived
at Torrey Pines today,
I was nervous because
it was super crowded.
The line to even get to the entrance booth
was like down the road.
It worked out, and we
had a great time hiking.
("The Greatest Show" playing on stereo)
-  So it's interesting,
Kendra and I had planned
so many fun things for the kids to do,
but I think what they've enjoyed the most,
or the thing that they
most look forward to
is just being home,
playing around the yard,
climbing the tree and playing.
And that makes me really happy,
and that's interesting as we
continue to plan adventures
for our family, to always make
sure that there's enough time
for just playing around the house,
playing in the yard, climbing a tree.
- Well, Elise and I came
down to Balboa Park,
there's an organ concert
at the organ pavilion
that we're wanting to go
to, and we want to sneak in
to the art museum for just
a minute and check it out.
- I'm excited, 'cause if
we go to the art museum
then I can be more inspired
for what art things to do.
(organ music)
(applause)
(organ music)
- So this is the largest
outdoor organ in the world,
and that concert was magnificent.
Did you enjoy it?
- Mm-hmm!
- It's amazing to me that
when people play the organ,
they play with their hands and their feet
at the same time.
That amount of coordination is amazing.
We're going behind the scenes.
- We're gonna get to see the organ!
Whoa.
- So this is just the
outside of the organ,
there's actually 5,017 pipes that are part
of this outdoor organ.
So what did you think of the performance?
- It was good.
-  What was your favorite part?
- The movie time.
- The movie music? That was fun.
I'm so grateful that I have
the chance to come back
and explore Balboa Park a little bit more.
I'm glad Leesie came with
me, that was nice of you.
It's just beautiful, I just want to see
all the little spots.
(bright music)
Leesie, look, this is Mary Cassatt.
She's an artist that I really like.
That is beautiful.
(classical music)
That's beautiful.
(classical music)
So it's got layers to it.
So then you can add
back the ones you like.
- The reason I like this
picture is because the grass
looks like its waving around in the wind.
- It does look like that. It's beautiful.
I think that this one is
my favorite from today.
I love the vibrant colors
and the movement of the sky
with the storm, it's awesome.
Well, time to go home to
the rest of the family.
Tonight, we are meeting some
friends here at Waterfront Park
to eat some dinner and enjoy the view,
and let the kids run around and play.
Hey, guys!
-  Hi, Mom.
-  Hi!
Hi, Leese.
- Hi!
-  This climbing
section is awesome!
How's it going, dude?
Oh my goodness, you are way up there!
-  Are you scared?
-  Yeah, I'm a little nervous.
Well, I wish that I had come to this park
at the beginning of our
trip so we could come
a couple times.
Like, this play features
are so unique here!
And with the fountains
on a hot day would be
so fun to splash around in that.
Looks like we're gonna have
to come back to San Diego.
Did you just climb that whole thing?!
- Yeah, I went around there,
and I also did that way
and I did that one.
-  What?!
- So we're down at the
Waterfront Park with friends,
Chick's Life are some of our friends
we've known for a long time on YouTube,
and Heidi with While They
Were Napping and her family.
And it's just a beautiful
sunset, with this old
pirate-style ship that is beautiful.
- And then watch this.
-  He's goin'!
Elise really flies down there.
(both laugh)
- Let's go to Daddy, go to Daddy.
(pleasant relaxed music)
-  Janae found a dog.
So this is Nacho,
Nacho's never really been
exposed to babies, so I think
he's about as interested
as she is, like, what is this?
The dog is leaving.
She's going for the dog.
Elise took a picture at night.
It turned out really good!
We're trying to get a picture.
-  Come on, we gotta take a picture.
-  Oh, you got her?
(adults cheering)
-  Wow, that's a lot of kids.
-  Goodnight, J House out.
- My baby just took her first steps.
(bright music)
Come on, do it! Come see Mama!
-  You guys!
-  Ah! She did it!
