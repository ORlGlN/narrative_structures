Kubby we feel the goats

come
so my mom married a rancher and I
actually raised pigs for a couple years
when I was in high school that's how
cool I was I actually ended up making a
couple thousand dollars doing it and
learned some really great life lessons
about waking up early in the morning to
feed pigs and to clean out their pen and
stuff do you guys want pigs yeah yeah so
how did you learn the art of life so
field trips with Kendra are super fun
because she's like crazy interested in
wherever we're at she yes just a nice
way of saying I'm a big nerd
she asked the best questions and she was
way more excited about that than the
kids and I think that's important
because it helps the kids be excited
about what we're learning about we were
at the blacksmith for at least 25
minutes asking every question we learned
everything it was awesome because the
kids and I read a book a while ago that
had a blacksmith as part of the
storyline and there'd been some things
that I hadn't understood so it was
interesting yeah there you go Caleb

waiting oh oh a fish tried to get the
worm it looked like it got pulled down

so I represent a family where their
mother passed away and today I was going
through the file looking at documents
and I found on one of the back of the
records a handwritten note from the
daughter to the mother and it was really
sensitive and just said you're the best
mom ever I love you mom and and of
course it was written to the mom before
she had passed away and I made a copy of
it and emailed it and sent it to the
daughter because I know that they've
been going through a really hard time
with the loss of their mom it was just a
good reminder to tell people that you
love them because life is uncertain all
right guys
it is leftover night and that is my
favorite night you ready the leftover
dance with me that means good food
