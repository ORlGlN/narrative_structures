(Kendra makes silly sounds and laughs)
(Laura squeals and laughs)
-  Poor girl,
she's the fourth child,
the neglected fourth child.
Uhhh! Spit-up!
(collective noises of disgust)
(cheerful introductory music)
(bell chimes for each name)
(loud vacuuming)
-  Hi, Mister Caleb!
- Hi.
- Look at this. He picked
up every single toy
and put it away. Then
he got out the vacuum
from the closet, plugged it in,
and started vacuuming.
My two-year-old did that.
While sometimes I think he's a terror,
a lovable terror of destruction,
and wow, busyness,
really, I think he's just
insanely independent
and focused and driven,
and those are going to be great attributes
that serve him well in this life!
As long as he makes it to adulthood.
(loud vacuuming)
So, Little Miss just woke
up. Can you say good morning?
She just took her nap. I
finally got my makeup on.
Lovely. Caleb, what did you make for us?
(Caleb starts to cry)
Oh, Buddy, I'm so sorry! Come here!
Let Mama help you up.
You alright, tough guy?
- Yeah.
-  Tough little guy!
-  Yeah? Here, climb
back up! Climb back up.
That exact incident happens
about seven thousand times each day,
doesn't it, Caleb?
- Yeah.
-  All right,
show me what you made.
-  And look at the back!
-  Airplane!
-  It's an airplane?
-  Look at the back.
-  Ooh!
(loud music)
- Wow!
-  What are you doin'?
- Whee! I made it into fun soap. (shrieks)
I have (laughs loudly) a hat!
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Silly goose!
(delighted squeals and giggles)
-  I'm over too far!
-  That's enough soap, okay?
- I put some on you!
(Elise yells)
-  No, don't get it on me!
-  Now we have to "grr".
-  I put some on me.
(children roar in unison)
-  Whoa!
-  Forehead,
forehead, forehead, forehead.
(Caleb laughs)
(children laugh)
- Guys! I'm covered with tons of bubbles!
-  So we have this light.
-  It's awesome!
It's my favorite light in the house.
 You're pushing it,
but if you don't hold it just right,
(laughs) it worked! It was flashing
on and off, and on and off.
-  It did it twenty times
before pulling out the camera.
-  Hey, that's a good thing.
If turning on the camera means
that the light will work,
I'm totally fine with
that. How was your evening?
- I hate shopping. Shopping
is the bane of my existence,
and I have decided I'm
never going to shop again.
(chuckles)
- We're gonna start a
garden, and hunt a lot.
- It's such a waste of time.
You drive to the store,
you get out of the car,
you get in the store,
(laughs) you look at stuff,
you look at stuff you
didn't know you needed.
And then you pick it all up,
and then you go to the cash register,
and you decide, "Just kidding,
I didn't really need all of that!"
And then you put it back.
- This is what most people's
shopping experience is like,
right? Okay, good, keep going.
- There's not a piece of
the process that I enjoy.
I don't enjoy going, I
don't enjoy looking at it,
I don't enjoy deciding on it,
I don't enjoy paying for it,
and I don't enjoy taking it home
and either having to organize
it or do something with it.
I just hate shopping.
I do not want to purchase anything else
for the rest of my life.
-  All right. I'm
glad you had a good day.
(Kendra laughs)
- My favorite part of my day was:
So I was putting up
the storm drain outside
that we had taken down
when we were painting,
-  You don't have to
selfie it. I'm right here.
- Huh?
- You don't have to
selfie it. I'm right here.
- Oh, you can hold it?
- Yeah.
- Well, you're lower than
me, so I double chin.
- Yeah, you might want to sit down
so you don't have a double chin. (laughs)
- There's a reason people hold it up,
because.
- It makes 'em look not.
- Yeah. Okay, so I was putting
back up the storm drain,
and it's a pretty basic process,
but I don't do a lot of manual labor.
- Side note: it was dark out. (giggles)
- By the time I was finishing up,
it was completely dark outside.
And I don't have all the proper tools,
which makes every kind of project harder.
- Side note: he has a
hammer and a screwdriver.
(laughter)
- You end something like
that, and it's done.
You can look at it, and it's finished,
and the type of work I do,
I'll be working on something
for over a year before there's completion.
And even then, people still
aren't happy about it.
And I put up a storm drain and it's done,
and it looks good, and it's finished,
and it was rewarding. It was super fun.
(gradual cymbal cues cheerful end music)
