- You know Harry at Hogwarts?
He talks in British.
(door stop vibrates)
-  Hi.
Say goodbye.
Parade of Homes!
- What? What?
-  What did you guys find?
- Shut the door, Elise!
-  Arms up!
(giggling)
-  What are these on your arm?
- This is my energy.
-  That's your energy?
- Yes! If I need princesses, I just, this.
-  Cool.
- This is my family.
This is my pet.
This is my brother.
This is my dad.
This is my mom.
-  So, Caleb,
you're doing something
a little different today, right?
- British accent.
-  You're talking
with a British accent?
Let's hear it.
- Hello.
-  Was that with a British accent?
- Uh-huh.
-  So, why are you wanting
to practice using a British accent?
- You know Harry at Hogwarts?
-  Oh, Harry Potter? Yeah.
- He talks in British.
-  So you're going
to try to be like Harry?
- Uh-huh
-  Is this for Halloween?
Are you going to be Harry Potter?
Can we hear the Pledge of
Allegiance in a British accent?
- I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America.
-  Well, good luck working
on your British accent.
- Yes.
-  Where you going?
- I'm going to Nolan's house for school.
I don't know what I'm
gonna learn about today.
-  And the other kids are going
to their homeschool enrichment program
that happens one day a week.
- I'm excited!
(lively rhythmic music)
- So all the other kids are gone
at either school or their preschool.
(baby coos)
And we've been having so
much fun with Miss Janae.
Remember when we only had one kid?
-  Yeah.
That was a thing.
So we're just starting to do some
baby sign language with Janae.
-  I think she's
signing milk sometimes.
- Yeah. I think she is, too.
So, we usually start with milk and more.
More.
(baby squeals)
More.
More.
Are you all done?
All done.
All done.
-  How was preschool?
- Good!
I learned about leaves!
-  Leaves?
- Hi, Nae-Nae!
Hi!
-  Come on, Laura!
We have a little date.
- Him and you.
-  Oh. Him and me.
- Yup.
- I made an L with my crackers.
-  You made an
L with your crackers?
You're getting really
great with the letter L.
So, Laura, an L looks like this.
Straight, over.
Can you do it?
Good job.
(tinny children's music)
(vibration)
(vibration)
(vibration)
-  Hi.
(Kendra laughs)
Did you see me?
(upbeat dance music)
-  Alright. There you go.
(children talking quietly)
(slower guitar music)
♫ Happy all the time
♫ Since Jesus came in
♫ And blessed my heart from sin
♫ I'm inright, outright,
upright, downright
♫ Happy all the time.
♫ I'm inright, outright,
upright, downright
♫ Happy all the time.
♫ I'm inright, outright,
upright, downright
♫ Happy all the time.
-  Look what
came in the mail today.
- So, our current vlogging camera
has been having some problems
and so we just got a new one.
This is only our fourth camera
in the three years of vlogging.
And these cameras go through a lot.
They get dropped.
The get gnawed on by children.
We're excited to have another new one.
- Here it is.
Say goodbye.
Goodby little camera!
-  We'll probably
still use it occasionally
when we're both two places at one time.
- Probably.
This afternoon Elise and Caleb and I
are going to the Parade of Homes.
I'm really excited!
I love the Parade of Homes!
I just love touring homes.
I just think it's really exciting.
I know that someday we'll move and
be moving into another house and so
I love to get ideas of the things
I'm interested in and the things that
I don't love.
In Kansas City they do a Parade of Homes
in the spring and another one in the fall
and it's free and you can
just go tour the homes.
So, we're going!
Let's check out this house.
(lively double bass music)
- I've never seen a
fireplace without a mantel.
-  Wow.
-  Well, that's
a beautiful kitchen.
One of the things I dream about having
in a next house for us is a half bath.
Right now any guests just have to go
to the kids' bathroom,
which is totally fine,
but it's really hard to keep that clean
and, you know, guest ready.
So a nice, simple half bath.
Now we're headed upstairs.
-  I love the floor.
-  You like the carpet?
- I want this room.
-  You like this room?
How's the closet, Caleb?
- Here's more for practice bars.
-  No, those
are not for gymnastics.
The master room's in here.
-  It might be a guest room.
- Look, this is, like, a bathtub.
-  Ohhh. It's a nice bathroom.
- Hey! A Jack and Jill bathroom.
-  Yeah.
Whoa! This is a huge closet!
And it goes into the laundry room
and then it goes back around.
- Yeah! It's like a whole circle.
-  Think this would be your room?
-  Yeah.
- I actually think I want this one.
-  You like this room better?
Oh! Look how cute that is.
-  Hi! It's like a playhouse!
(giggles)
It even has air conditioning.
-  Does it?
- Yeah, come on. Look!
-  Nice.
There you go.
There's a light.
I think we could live in this one.
- We could sleep in here.
-  So that house right there
is another Parade of Homes.
Let's go!
(upbeat jazz music)
(delighted giggles)
It's huge!
So, this is a walk-in pantry.
The floors are beautiful.
You guys going to explore upstairs first?
-  Yes!
- Now, this is beautiful!
-  You think this is beautiful?
- The closets are big.
- And then it comes into
another beautiful room.
-  It's a Jack and Jill bathroom.
(upbeat keyboard music)
- Look. And then lookie, lookie here.
-  Wow!
This bathroom is big enough
for a legit dance party.
(Kendra laughs)
Almost. You guys are getting close.
Let's see the master closet.
-  What?
- What? What?
(giggles)
-  It keeps going?
It keeps going?
- I'm king of the world!
-  This is where
the king of the world sits?
- In the closet.
-  In the closet?
Well, this is an absolutely
beautiful master bedroom.
Check this out.
Did you guys realize you look alike today?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
We purposely did that!
-  Oh, you guy tried to match?
Matching.
You know you're an adult or a mom
when you look at new houses
and you're most excited
about the closet space.
You're like, this would be awesome!
I could store so much stuff in here!
Should we check this one out?
-  Yup.
-  I love the double door entry.
That is fun.
And these light woods.
Wow.
Are you interior designing it?
- Oval table.
-  A soft carpet
and a table right here?
- And then a couch right here.
-  Ohhh!
This deck is really pretty.
And there's trees back here.
Is this the master bedroom?
Oh! That's so pretty!
I love it!
-  I can see a picture.
(giggles)
- The interesting thing about coming out
and doing the Parade of Homes
is that there are things
I love about each of the houses I see.
Like, they're beautiful and they're new
and they smell clean and some of them have
a lot more space than our house.
But, at the end of the day,
like, as we're heading home,
I'm just sitting here
thinking, I love my house.
I really, really do.
I love the space is just
exactly what we need right now.
And that's how I know it's
not time to move. Yet.
-  A door!
-  What did you guys find?
-  A secret hiding spot.
(giggles)
- Shut the door, Elise!
Bye.
(sizzling)
-  Dad made dinner.
-  Yay.
-  Thank you, Daddy.
- Mmm-hmmm.
-  Some day
we'll feed you real food.
- Tonight Kendra picked
up a S'mores pie for us
before we go to bed.
- This is so good.
The toasted marshmallow
with the graham cracker
and the chocolate.
- What did you want to show us?
-  I wanted to show you the moon!
It's a full moon tonight,
or an almost full moon,
and it's beautiful.
The clouds are in front of it now
but it was so beautiful.
-  It still looks beautiful.
-  Ready? Set? Go!
(giggles)
- Ready? Set? Go!
Ready? Set? Go!
(giggles)
Ready? Set? Go!
Growl! Growl!
-  What is that?
(Kendra laughing)
-  It's, like, a swan!
It's a duck!
Can we disappear into each other?
(laughter)
-  Ready? Set? Go!
-  One ... two ... three.
Arms out!
(laughter)
-  We're trying to make a J House.
-  And my head's the chimney.
Did it work?
Did we make a J House?
-  We're a J House.
-  Goodnight. J House out.
-  What did you find, Janae?
- Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
(upbeat music)
-  Touchdown!
(excited yelling)
