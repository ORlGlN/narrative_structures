(Deck the Halls)
- Happy Christmas Eve,
do you guys wanna say happy Christmas Eve?
-  Happy Christmas Eve!
- And Merry Christmas 'cause
if you're watchin' this
it's Christmas morning!
- Aw, Merry Christmas guys.
We are headed downtown
Kansas City right now
to go to the Ronald McDonald House
that is next to Children's Mercy,
the children's hospital downtown,
and we are going to make and serve lunch
to the families that are
there, and I'm really excited,
we're going with a couple other families
and the kids are gonna get to be hands on
and helping in the
kitchen, which they love,
and it just really makes my heart
feel really grateful today that
all of our kids are healthy,
and I'm happy to be able
to help these families
that are going through this tough time
during this holiday season.
Alright here we go.
-  Kendra we need a picture of you
holding everything and filming
the vlog at the same time.
- I'm holding everything!
- That's some advanced-level
vlogging right there.
She's got her hands full of
this and she's trying to vlog.
So here's the kitchen, they
have it set up really neat,
there's four identical
kitchens here that are set up,
and I really wanna come here some night
with four friends and play Chopped.
- So we're making Hawaiian haystacks,
we've got the rice going,
and the water boiling for the chicken,
and what are you guys helping make?
- Brownies.
-  Brownies, the favorite part,
we're all hard at work.
Liesi's holding while Isaac
stirs, and then we switch.
K Isaac you hold it and let Liesi stir.
What'cha doin' Liesi?
- I'm cutting.
-  What is it that you're cutting?
- I don't know.
-  Oh it's green
onions is what it's called.
It's one of our toppings today.
So Elise has it going strong right there.
With a real knife, you bein' careful?
- Yes.
-  Good job.
And now cleanup duty.
- We have a little assembly line goin'.
-  Loading the dishwashers.
Cleaning up, bud?
- This is the spray spray.
- That's the spray spray,
k wipe the table for me.
Show me how you wipe the table.
No no no not the salt, no.
Well that was a really good
experience, we really liked it.
- Yeah the thing I loved
about it the most was
actually getting to talk to the families
who are having a family member
in the hospital right now,
we met this one couple, they
have a three-year-old girl
and a five-month-old baby
boy, and the five-month-old
just went through his
second open heart surgery,
he's been in the hospital
a month for this last time.
They live two hours from the hospital,
they're hoping that their little boy
is able to come home
for Christmas tomorrow,
and they were so kind, like
they were showing pictures
to Isaac, and Elise and
Caleb of their baby boy,
and telling them about the
surgery and what it's been like
and I really hope that for our kids
that as we go and do these
things that they're able to
understand that there are people out there
going through a hard time,
and that there's things
that we can do to try to
help lift their burden
in some small way.
- I am totally on top of things
and finished my Christmas shopping about,
at least 30 minutes
ago, which is very nice.
So now we are headed to
Brent and Michelle's house
for a Christmas Eve dinner spectacular.
So we have a great feast over here.
Ham, cheesy potatoes.
- So one of the things that Brent does is
he makes these Italian sodas with dinner,
he's gonna surprise me
with some awesome flavor.
Woah, it's good.
- Yeah it is.
- I'm gonna go with,
goodness, I don't even know.
- It's cinnamon vanilla coconut.
- Woah.
-  Can I try it?
- Yeah, cinnamon vanilla coconut, festive.
- Woah.
What are you guys watching?
- Santa is in London,
England in five seconds.
-  Is this the Santa tracker?
- Yeah.
-  The virgin's name was Mary,
and Mary was a little
bit scared of the angel.
-  And then
Joseph randomly showed up.
-  And the angel said
'blessed art thou among
women, fear not Mary.'
And it came to pass in those days
there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus.
-  He ran away, he ditched her.
Oh there he is, fakie.
Stay with Mary.
-  To be taxed with
Mary, his espoused wife,
being great with child.
And Mary kicked the donkey.
(adults laughing)
And Joseph kicked the donkey.
(singing Silent Night)
- We just finished
watching the world record
largest Nativity video from YouTube again.
It's amazing, it's really good.
Anyway we're eating our dessert,
Michelle made apple crisp
and this cream cheese pie
with strawberry topping on it,
what'd you think Ms. Elise?
- MMMMMMMM.
- 'Twas the Night Before
Christmas, by Clement C. Moore.
Do you guys wanna see when
this one was published?
In 1822 a New York clergyman--
- That's my age!
- Oh you're a little
bit younger than that.
-  I think he
heard the number 'two.'
'Twas the night before
Christmas, is that tonight?
'Twas the night before Christmas
when all through the house
not a creature was
stirring, not even a mouse.
And as you guys are
falling asleep tonight,
I want you to think about Jesus
and how grateful you are for Jesus, okay?
-  I will dream about
Mary and Joseph and Jesus.
- That would be a fun dream.
Alright, ready?
(singing Joy to the World)
-  Merry Christmas!
- J House out, ho ho ho.
-  J House out, ho ho ho.
