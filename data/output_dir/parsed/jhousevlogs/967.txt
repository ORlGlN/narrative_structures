("Deck The Halls")
- So I've never worn lipstick in my life,
like never.
I don't own any lipstick.
And recently, Jeremy very kindly was like,
"So, I wonder what you would
look like with lipstick on."
And I was like, "Hmm, maybe
I should try some lipstick."
So I was at this store, and I
bought two different colors.
This is one of 'em.
I went with like a super cheap brand,
'cause I just had no idea
if I was even gonna like it or not.
This is, what's it called, red carpet.
But guys, I feel like a clown.
Like I feel like this looks ridiculous,
and I don't even know if
I'm staying in the lines,
and I have no idea how to get it off,
like I tried it on last night
and I couldn't get it
off for the life of me.
It like smudged all over my face,
so I guess I'm asking
for some help, all you
fashion conscious ladies out there.
First of all, honestly,
can I pull off this color?
'Cause I feel like I look like a clown,
but maybe that's 'cause
I've never worn it before.
Number two, how do you stay in the lines?
Do I need to be using lip liner?
Or is there like a technique I'm missing?
(chuckles) And, oh yeah,
the third question is
how do you get it off?
Like effectively in the evening or,
I don't know.
I know nothing about lipstick,
but anyway, I'm kind of excited to try
even if I do feel like a clown.
Alright, we are headed out
to one of our favorite places
to eat breakfast, lunch, brunch,
as a family this morning.
Anyway, we don't take the kids
to sit-down restaurants
very often because honestly
two on four doesn't work very well,
so when Grandma and Papa come into town,
that's a great reason to
take 'em somewhere fun,
'cause four on four is
much more easily managed.
-  She's just happy to be here.
-  She is just happy to be here.
- It's a great day
for this fun restaurant.
-  Is it a fun restaurant?
- Yeah.
- A super fun restaurant.
- This is a farmer's
scramble, so it's eggs,
seasoned potatoes, lots of
veggies, and goat cheese on top,
which I never eat goat
cheese, but in this,
it's amazing.
-  How's your pancake, man?
- Good.
-  What flavor did you get again?
- Apple cinnamon.
-  And what flavor did you get?
- Chocolate chip.
-  You guys makin' stuff?
- Uh huh.
-  Can I see what you made, Cub?
-  Show Daddy what you had too.
-  So pretty.
-  Yeah.
-  And you guys painted
your fingernails and toenails?
-  Yeah.
("O Come All Ye Faithful")
- We're trying to get a Christmas picture
with the family.
- It may be too much to ask for.
-  Ice cream!
-  OK, see if Mom likes these.
- Pickles!
- So we'd be taking the picture,
and one of the kids would
be lifting their dress up,
and the other one would
be picking his nose.
- We are finishing up
these brown sugar cookies,
and I'm just so glad
that we got to make them,
especially with my mom.
This is definitely a great memory for me
for like every Christmas ever growing up.
And I love that we made
brown sugar cookies
instead of regular white sugar cookies.
The flavor is so much more
rich.
I don't know, they're just amazing.
You have to try 'em.
I'll put the recipe in the description box
so that you can try them.
Isaac, you excited to
make cookies with Grandma?
- Yeah.
- K, then we're gonna
flip, just a second here.
OK?
This is the fat part.
You gotta roll that fat part.
There we go.
This side is the cutting part,
so we stick it on the edge, OK?
You'll leave it sitting right there.
OK, now get the next
one that you wanna do,
and we'll put it on the edge--
- A snowman!
- Gotta turn it over.
This is the cutting edge,
so we've gotta turn it over this way.
OK, now leave it sitting there.
OK, get another one.
OK.
OK, just gonna have to go right there.
Push down really good.
Now squish 'em.
-  Caleb, what are you doing?
- I did it.
- You did it?
- Yay!
Look at that!
Isn't that cute?
- What did you make?
-  And now
you wanted the snowman.
There you go.
- And a socking.
-  A what?
- And a socking.
-  A socking?
- And a socking.
- Aw, he calls 'em sockings.
- Like your sister used to
call 'em wait 'til laters
instead of elevators.
-  It's just so cute.
- They're puffy, aren't they?
You see 'em get kind of puffier?
- Are they mine?
- Yeah, which one do you want to frost?
Pick one.
("Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer")
Good job.
-  Are you frosting?
- Uh huh.
-  See when you frost a cookie,
you rub the frosting on the cookie, see?
(giggles)
(laughs)
Yeah, that's how you put on that frosting.
You're doin' good, Cubby.
- I farted.
(giggles)
- So back in the day, we would
like have all these different
toppings and colors and piping bags
and we'd decorate these
super ornate cookies
and at this phase in my life,
we just put on the frosting
and put on the sprinkles
and call it good.
-  That was a snowman, I think.
-  Lisey, it's great!
(microwave beeps)
-  Ready to eat it?
-  No, you're
gonna decorate another one.
- And then eat one?
-  Yeah.
- Oh.
(festive piano music)
-  Woah.
Woah, OK, OK, that's enough.
-  OK.
- That's enough, and there is
the finished gingerbread man.
-  So it's a Christmas J House.
-  Woo hoo! Merry Christmas!
-  Merry Christmas
- This is actually
inspired by Sam Mendias.
Sam made us a logo one time
with a house cookie cutter.
It was pretty cool.
I'll show you a picture of it.
So that inspired the J House cookie.
- Thanks, Sam.
So my brother and sister and their spouses
are together in Utah right now,
and so we're Skyping with
them, so come join us.
- We're so far past tired.
-  Hey guys, you're on J House.
Can you guys wave to J House?
-  Hey!
(loud baby laughter)
-  He can make a
ping pong ball levitate.
-  There it is, there it is!
There it is, oh.
(laughs)
-  We're so impressed.
What a talented family we are.
♫ Wish you a merry Christmas
♫ And a happy new year
(festive Christmas music)
-  J House out.
- Out!
(laughs)
