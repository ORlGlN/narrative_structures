-  How should
we take the fire sticks?
- Maybe I should hold them on the drive.
-  Are you cheering
for the other team?
Uh-oh.
-  Hey.
(laughing)
Oh, they scored!
(birds singing)
(gentle music)
- It's a note.
-  From who?
- Mom.
-  Did you just wake up Cubby?
- Who is this?
-  Mom sent you a little note.
- Whoa.
This one's mine.
-  Yep, Mom wrote
you a love note, too.
Do you want me to read it to you?
-  What does that say?
-  Dude.
- First it says that if I didn't read it,
you die.
- L-A-U-R-A.
(Jeremy laughs)
- That wouldn't have been
a very good love note.
- Dad, Dad hear this.
L-A-U-R-A.
-  There it is, do
you want me to read it to you?
- Mmm-mmm.
-  I love you.
You are so fun to chat with and play with.
You are very helpful and kind.
I love you.
Mom.
- Dude you are awesome.
I love you.
Thanks for being my friend.
You are super fun.
I hope you know I'm glad we are
to have you in our family.
Love, Mom.
-  You read that so well buddy.
We sure love you.
- So last night when I
was getting ready for bed,
I was thinking about the kids
and I thought, you know,
I should do little things
for them more often,
like write little love notes.
And then I was like,
yeah I'm tired tonight,
I'll do that another time.
And I was like, no, I had the thought,
I should just do it right now.
So I used little post-it notes
and wrote those little notes to them
and stuck them on the kitchen table
so they'd see them when they woke up.
And sometimes I have good intentions
and then I never make 'em happen.
And so I'm trying to
learn to seize the moment
and a good something is better
than a perfect nothing.
Like I didn't have to write
elaborate notes to them
and draw pictures.
Just little simple things,
'cause those are the things
that I can actually get done.
(uptempo rock music)
Good job Isaac!
I'm headed out to Isaac's soccer game.
Jeremy's working this morning,
and so I've got all the kids with me,
and we are coming to cheer for Isaac.
And I'm excited, because
I haven't actually
been out to a soccer game.
We're all set, ready to cheer.
- I don't know why I'm
all dressed in blue.
-  Are you cheering
for the other team?
Uh-oh.
- I'm not cheering for the other team.
-  Are we all dressed in blue?
- We all have blue chairs.
-  Uh-oh.
So this is Janae's first soccer game.
She's out cheering for Isaac.
Where's Mama?
There she is.
Good save Isaac, good block.
- Good job guys.
- Alright, good job.
Next Saturday, we have team pictures.
-  Did you guys win?
- Yeah.
-  Awesome.
Good job.
I loved watching you play.
- Can we bring fire?
-  To go camping?
- Yeah.
I mean fire sticks.
-  How should
we take the fire sticks?
- Maybe I should hold them on the drive.
-  Would they burn you?
- No.
-  Why not?
- Because they are not on.
-  Are you talking about a match?
I think she might be
talking about a sparkler.
- So I'm gonna hold it
carefully at the park,
so I won't make fire.
I want to make a fire right by
Big fires burn people.
- Are you talking about matches,
what we use to start a birthday candle?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we might have a fire
when we're out camping today,
but we're not gonna
let little girls do it,
because fires are not for little girls.
- No no, I'm just saying that
I can hold them on the drive.
- But what if you held
something else important,
like a water bottle?
- Um,
I want to bring the snack.
- You want to hold the snacks?
-  Yeah.
- That's a smart girl.
- We'll see what we can do.
-  I want to hold the chips.
-  I made a game.
-  Can I play?
-  Yeah.
-  Okay, so do I just pick one?
- Yeah, you pick a picture.
-  Let's go with the scissors.
- One two three four five.
-  Number one.
- One.
Now pick a number.
-  Three.
So now I get to find out what happened?
- Your family got in a car crash.
(record scratching)
- What kind of game is this?
(laughing)
- Well it's like a game
where you go like this
and you see the future.
-  So is that the game,
just my family's gonna
die in a car accident?
So what happens next?
- You just see if your
day gets better or not.
-  It could get worse,
than my family getting in a car crash?
- Well try again.
- Okay.
Let's go with the scroll.
- One two three four five six.
Okay.
-  I'm curious to
see what happens this time.
- Your Mom made you do a hundred chores.
-  What?
Is there anything good,
or is it all bad?
- No, there's like a few things good.
-  Let's go with number eight.
- It's your birthday, happy birthday!
- Yay!
That's a fun game Elise.
Alright get ready, we're going camping.
- Yay.
- So two of my brothers and their families
are out camping.
We aren't able to spend
a couple days out there,
but wanted to go out and
have some fun with them.
(twangy upbeat music)
- We're on our way out
to see Jeremy's family
who's camping, we're gonna
join them for dinner tonight
and we're reading on the way.
We're reading our new read aloud book,
which is Frindle.
What do you guys think of it?
I like it.
- It's good.
- I like it.
-  Remember?
The really fortune thing
said we'd get in an accident.
- Yeah, my family would
get in a car crash.
-  You better
drive safe mister man.
-  Daddy.
(gentle country music)
-  This is way
better than an outhouse.
(flushing)
- Yeah.
- What is this?
- We're doing tin foil dinners tonight.
It's a family classic when we're camping.
(groovy beat music)
Good catch.
Ooh.
Oh, they scored!
So we decided to take a scenic stroll
down to the lake.
(gentle music)
- Blake, thanks for helping.
Thank you.
-  Hello.
Do you guys see the jet skis?
So they have a park up here the kids
are playing at.
Have fun Allie.
(yells)
(upbeat music)
Hey.
(Jeremy laughing)
Yeah.
-  You two sharing the stroller?
- Yeah.
-  Heading back to the camp site.
- This is a rock store.
Would you like a rock?
- Did you make a rock store?
-  Yes, thank you.
- We're giving everybody rocks.
-  Is that what
you do at a rock store.
Give away your rocks?
- Well we just made it up in our mind.
We just wanted to make a
rock store, because we did.
Now let's start making rocks.
-  Oh no, who's under here?
(laughing)
- We're making a fire.
-  Obviously.
(knocking rocks)
(enchanting music)
- Let's give it some water.
-  Did you guys plant a flower?
- Mmm-mmm, we're gonna plant it.
-  And you're watering it?
- Yeah, we're watering it.
- Let's get some more dirt for it.
Now I have to water it.
-  Oh here's another flower.
- This is gonna be a
beautiful flower for somebody.
And it's gonna be Mommy.
-  You gonna make it for Mommy?
- It's gonna be beautiful for Mama.
That was too much water.
-  Laura, do you
want to go get some dinner?
Let's go.
- Okay, we have to go get dinner.
(tender guitar music)
- Okay, let's see, where's
the other cooked one?
(arm fart)
-  You got a flashlight?
- Uh-huh, it's my flashlight.
-  Fun.
-  Apple pineapple.
-  Is it apple pineapple?
-  Yep, that's what this one is.
-  Cool.
(guitar melody)
How's the cobbler?
- It's good.
It's just hot.
So I'm gonna let it cool off right there.
Tell everybody that's mine.
-  Okay, okay.
How's the cobbler.
- Good.
- It's really good.

♫ My backyard, my backyard
♫ School
