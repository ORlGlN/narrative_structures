- This is not a good place for me to come
and learn about what's lying in the ocean.
-  Right where we were at.
(upbeat music)
-  This is a shark
egg, this thing right here.
♪ Happy Birthday ♪
(upbeat music)
- Happy birthday to me.
I feel like this was eating me.
(upbeat music)
-  You're doing
a tour of the ship?
(upbeat music)
- This is the size of a penny.
These are the size of these organisms
that are so tiny and
they're called plankton.
So now what we wanna do is try to match
some of these to some of these.
See if you can figure out which
kind of plankton they are.
These are little tiny organisms
that live in the ocean.
- Found a match.
- You did, you found a match.
-  Those are supposed to be krill
and we're looking at little tiny plankton.
- Are they alive?
-  Yeah, they're still alive.
And this is what they'll look like.
-  Just looks
like saltwater kind of .
-  So every little dot that you see
is one of those animals on the screen.
So they're really, really tiny.
The microscope just makes them look large.
-  Do you see it Laura?
(guitar music)
-  There he is.
You're in Laura.
(guitar music)
It's kind of like a cow.
That's pretty good.
(upbeat orchestral music)
- It's so weird, it's not like real sand.
-  What is this?
-  This is kinetic sand
and we get to shape our own seafloor.
Are you digging a ditch?
-  Yeah and now it's purple.
(upbeat music)
- Whoa, it's so fast.
- I'm setting it in a trap.
-  Uh oh, did you trap it?
-  Yeah.
-  Oh there it is Caleb,
you're turning on the light.
So he is making waves
to power a lighthouse.
(upbeat music)
So this aquarium overlooks the beach
that we played at yesterday.
That's just really fun.
Caleb just looked out on it
and he said, do you think
my tunnel's still there Mom?
Who knows?
Leesy's turn, can you
light the lighthouse?
- Oh, I'm lighting it.
-  Good job.
Laura, you wanna try?
Gotta push hard.
They are still going at it.
Whoa!
That thing is fast.
You guys made a super fast track.
(upbeat music)
As a family, we're doing an experiment.
We're trying to figure out
if a straight path is faster,
or the curved path goes faster.
So what's your guess?
Who thinks the straight
path will go fastest?
Who thinks the curved one will go fastest?
Okay, you guys ready?
(epic music)
So the straight path was clearly faster.
- Sting ray with the long nose.
- So I have a question, these
are called leopard sharks
and when a mommy leopard
shark is pregnant,
how many babies do you think she has?
- Five.
- You think five?
How many do you guess Isaac?
- Two.
- Two.
- 35.
- Caleb how many babies do you think?
- Three.
- Three?
-  I think one.
- They can have up to 38.
-  Whoa.
- 35.
(upbeat music)
-  Okay, the leopard shark is one
of the most common sharks
along the California coast.
Leopard sharks typically
stay on or near the bottom
and they favor warm, shallow
water near the shore.
-  Right where we were.
- This is not a good place for me to come
and learn about what's lying in the ocean.
-  Right where we were at.
-  So this one's called a bat ray.
-  It has lips.
-  It looks like
the cutest little face.
-  Well hello.
I like your lipstick.
(upbeat music)
- This is so creepy, we're
never going to the beach again,
ever.
-  There's so
many fish that are like
right under the sand.
- Okay, now everybody find
a gray, smooth hound shark.
- Up there.
-  Yep, you found it Elise.
-  So guys look,
this is where we were yesterday.
You see there's the playground
and the parking lot.
We were like right there.
-  Oh, we're right there.
-  Yep, now we're
here and there's the pier.
-  We ran there and back.
-  We did.
And where were the seals
and sea lions we saw?
Do you guys remember?
- They're on here.
- Yep, right there.
Well Isaac luckily read the fine print
and it says that leopard
sharks come in the summer.
So looks like we came to San Diego
at the right time of year.
Thanks for holding the door.
(upbeat music)
-  This is the Infinity Cube.
(upbeat music)
-  So now pull it up.
There you go, now you can see it up close.
-  Look at this.
You guys, that's not a rock.
Do you guys see this?
-  There's just rocks.
-  No, that's a crab.
-  At the bottom.
- I see it.
- It's just like finding Dori.
And look at that.
-  Do you guys see it?
-  All the tentacles.
-  Look at those tentacles
with all those suction cups.
Seahorses are masters of disguise
that can change color to
blend with their surroundings.
- The dads have the babies
instead of the moms.
-  The dads carry it.
(upbeat guitar music)
Let me touch the water.
- So some sharks lay eggs
and this is a shark egg.
This thing right here.
-  Wow, it looks like a shell.
(upbeat guitar music)
So Janae got a little wet out there
and we're trying to dry her off.
(upbeat music)
Good job.
Okay, try to make it.
This is the advanced level monkey bars.
Whoa!
(guitar music)
(laughter)
- So it's really chilly here at the park
and Elise comes running up to me.
She says Mom, I know it's
gonna make you smile.
And it sure did.
Do you guys see that rainbow?
- It's a rainbow.
-  It's a birthday
rainbow for you big girl.
- There's more of the rainbow, look!
-  There's more of
the rainbow, you're right.
(upbeat music)
They make cute little
shaped loves of bread.
These are sea turtles.
- Can I eat it?
-  Yeah, it's a bread fish.
-  How cool.
(jazzy music)
- So Laura requested
a strawberry ice cream
and white cake, ice cream
cake for her birthday.
So I'm here at Baskin Robbins
picking one up for her.
(jazzy music)
It's really convenient for me that my kids
like ice cream cakes
more than regular cakes
'cause we just pick them up and buy them.
And it's easier for me.
It's a strawberry and
vanilla ice cream cake.
- Are these stickers?
-  They're not, they're rings.
- Can we take off?
-  Yeah and
then you can wear them.
(piano music)
Oh can you look pretty like a princess?
(laughter)
That is fantastic.
Oh yes.

And what are you gonna use for a blanket?
