- Jeremy had to go to
work early this morning
and so I'm doing morning duty.
We all know how much I love that.
("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy")
Isaac wrote this Post-It
note and is wearing it today.
It says "I eat healthy, what about you?"
- I eat healthy the whole...
The whole December.
-  Why do you want to eat healthy?
- So I can have a good diet.
So I can play good at
football and baseball.
-  There's Miss Laura!
She needed a bath, Laura!
(Laura vocalizes)
Laura, can you say hi to Mama?
Laura.
(Laura vocalizes)
So I didn't get to video
this, but I was bathing Laura
real quick, maybe like two minutes.
All of a sudden, I was
like "Wait a minute,
Where is Caleb?"
So I had Elise run to see where he was
and he was on top of the
counter, having unwrapped
a bunch of gum and
chewing and swallowing it.
So I had to grab her out
of the tub and run out
and grab him.
So, yup, the morning's
off to a normal start.
- Baby Jesus.
-  Yay, this
is our Baby Jesus toy!
Okay Caleb, let's dump all the pieces out.
Let's see what we got.
("Away in a Manger")
(Laura wails)
You like that, Laura?
(Laura wails)
â™« Old McCaleb had a farm, E-I-E-O
Baby Jesus.
-  Why are you
putting Baby Jesus in there?
- (shrieks) I can't put the lid on.
-  Why are you trying
to put the lid on Baby Jesus?
- Baby Jesus die.
In a field...
("Away in a Manger")
Aah!
Whoah!
(Caleb vocalizes)
-  Cubby, Cubby.
You gotta give one to Laura.
(Laura cries)
Caleb, which one's for Laura?
Give Laura one.
(Laura wails)
Give Laura one.
Give Laura one.

Yesterday, I got out these cupcake liners
and I challenged the kids to make
a Christmas tree with them.
And they were super
creative, I didn't give them
any more direction than that.
And they all went
three-dimensional and were trying
to make Christmas trees.
- Hello.
-  (laughs) You have
a talking Christmas tree?
Well, I'd actually seen a
craft doing this on Pinterest.
They did awesome on their
Christmas trees yesterday,
but I think they'll
also enjoy making these.
(children vocalizing)
That looks awesome!
I had such a hard time getting the glue
on each individual sequin.
He just put the glue all over the tree.
Genius! Genius!
Genius (laughs)!
Oh my goodness, your tree is so circular!
It's lovely!
Are you done?
Oh. Awesomesauce.
So here they are!
- So our internet was out
most of yesterday and today.
But look, it's getting fixed!
We're so happy.
What's your name?
- Tina.
- Tina is fixing it for us!
-  Yay Tina!
- Aw man, we are so happy
to have internet back.
It's amazing how much you use something
and you don't realize it until it's gone.
- Everything shuts down.
We couldn't watch Netflix,
our printers, our Wi-Fi.
So I couldn't print anything.
And then there's of
course the whole YouTube,
vlogging, uploading.
("Away in a Manger")
-  This is where we (mumbles).
(Caleb vocalizes)
(Elise vocalizes)
- So I accidentally brought
the camera in to work with me.
At lunch time I was videoing
something, and I put it
in my pocket and I just came up to work.
And Kendra called me
and she was like "Hey,
I can't find the camera anywhere.
"I've been looking and
looking, where is it?"
It was in my pocket.
So sorry Kendra.
So we're eating and
Kendra wanted to put on
a dinner show for our guests
who are eating dinner with us.
Alright.
-  Ready?
(silly instrumental music)
(children laughing)
-  Okay, who's dancing was better?
- You! Yours!
-  Yeah!
- What?
(children cheering)
Ready balloon, ready?
(everyone blows)
(children vocalizing)
(everyone blows)
(children laughing)
Alright.
- I was helping at the church.
We have our Christmas party tomorrow
and we were setting up
325 chairs with tables.
I think that's going to
be enough, but we'll see.
It was a little bit of a task.
("Deck the Halls")
