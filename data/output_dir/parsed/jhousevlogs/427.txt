you were so great buddy good morning we
had a lovely morning at our rental house
this morning and now we are headed into
downtown st. Louis to go to a museum
that's called the city museum we've
heard great things about it so we'll see
what it's like there's the arch it's our
first sighting of the arch I never came
a large
what is this place I've never been to
any place like this a plane yeah and
there's a bus on the roof this is a cool
place I'm excited
yeah there you go
so for what I've seen so far this is
basically a big human pinball machine
and the creativity in the art with fun
for kids is just a cool combination
you won't fall
I'm gonna try the Train
was it good
all right we're heading to the rooftop
ruthless incubator
this is the longer into this whole place
feels like Willy Wonka s it's really
cruel you guys are you okay
bust things out over the top of the roof
we can get worse all right everybody
dude I'm a little scared it's awesome
you can share this thank goodness this
is padlocked Oh to the Kay let's press
oh my gosh okay I'm too scared
you're jumping Wow
you're there all right what do you think
Isaac time we'll see you down there okay
buddy that's insane
there goes Isaac a little bit of a rug
burn what do you think it wants to do
the ferris wheel
kind of rocks up here
the rocking it always is a little creepy
look how high we are you guys look how
pretty it is so honestly I'm scared of
heights but I force myself to do stuff
that I'm scared of to know that I can do
it like I went skydiving after I
graduated high school and it was really
fun and it was scary but I'm glad that I
faced my fear and did it but even being
on this right now I'm still scared so I
don't know if I'll ever overcome it but
it's just facing it and embracing the
fear whole question for today are you
afraid of heights let us know in the
poll Caleb is yelling that we need to
lift our hands up because it's really
fun his hands lifted
yeah that was awesome you guys are so
brave
I love this place you're gonna climb
across
good job
good job cub
you
Wow
so a big part of this is what material
you wear when you're going down the
slide caleb is wearing khakis which
don't get you going too fast but Troy is
wearing stuff where he's flying
that's death
all right so there's a bridge from one
airplane to the other airplane on the
wing of one of the airplanes you're
gonna fly move everyone in your sheets
you're a pilot
mm-hmm me too hi Lennie Lise
uncle Troy to the rescue Caleb got
scared
you were so brave buddy out who puts
indents into your body
there's Elise right down there to your
hand okay so I forget how much more
scary it is with huh because his feet
are so small they can actually go right
through these holes
you're like a tightrope walker so part
of the magic of this place is that you
have to climb up and through things to
get to certain parts of the magic for
example we're getting ready to go up to
a slide that goes from the rooftop all
the way down to the third floor
there's 11 or 12 floors up here but
their only way you can get into that
section to play is if you go down the
slide this is so cool I think it's
getting ready to go down the 10 story
slide you ready okay good
whoa
all right so my camera stopped working
so I'm using my phone we're now in the
cave section so there's no map of the
place you don't really know where you're
going you're just guessing trying to get
out this place is amazing we've had so
much fun because my camera is not
working Jay house out all right so
here's the official rental house tour
this is like Kendra Happyland I love
cute little places
