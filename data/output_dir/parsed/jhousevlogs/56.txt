-  Where are we at?
- The beach!
-  Were you keeping watch for us?
(laughter)
This is so fun.
- Donuts with cookies and
cream ice cream and sprinkles.
(guitar music)
What are you guys doing?
- Doing pedals.
-  Doing the rose pedals?
You found those on the ground right?
You didn't pull off the tree?
What should we do with
all these rose pedals?
- We should plant 'em in the back yard
so then they can grow again.
-  Laura look, there's more pedals
down the ground over here.
See these beautiful pink ones?
Hand Laura one and you guys
can put them in the bowl.
(easy piano music)
- Nae-nae's standing.
- She's doing it!
She's doing it!
- I just had to give her my Fitbit
because she wanted the pencil.
Then she put both hands on it
and she just like held it.
-  Let's see
if she'll do it again.
She's doing it.
So I think today is the clearest day
that we've had here in San Diego.
So we're busting out something
fun for the kids to do.
We're just gonna do it
one at a time with them.
Do you know what's inside here buddy?
- Binoculars.
-  Do you wanna look out
and see if you can find
a boat on the ocean?
Have you ever used binoculars like this?
- No.
(upbeat music)
- Surfers, there's the surfers.
-  It's warm enough to surf.
Janae's doing this thing
lately where she starts
slipping down into the splits.
Sometimes she gets stuck on her way down.
(easy music)
Pretty cool huh?
What have you seen out there?
- I've seen a boat.
I see an _ over there.
-  Awesome.
- I told Grandma to take me
way out in the deep water,
but not too far out.
- You can come here for lunch.
Yeah, bye.
-  Who's coming over for lunch?
Moana.
- Well it is bright and
sunny and warm out today
and we decided to go out for a walk.
Oh that biker, that's a hard thing too.
(piano music)
It's fun to walk through the neighborhood
and just see all the different houses
and the gorgeous view.
Anyway it's actually a
very hilly neighborhood
which of course we need so that we
can have the view that
we have up on the hill.
But it's giving me a very good workout,
especially pushing the stroller.
Are you getting a good workout?
Caleb, are you up in the tree?
Were you keeping watch for us?
What do you have?
- Flower pedals.
-  Flower pedals, let me see them.
- Me and Caleb did it.
-  That's beautiful,
what a great idea.
(upbeat music)
-  So we added some tap water into
one of these that we had already used
to drink water out of to
just let Laura play out here.
You can add rose pedals into there too.
(upbeat music)
-  Hi.
What are you making big girl?
- Flower pedals.
-  You're making flower pedals?
- Yeah, they're gonna be clean and soft.
-  Oh, that'll be so nice.
Janae, are you helping?
- She's helping splash the water.
-  Yeah she is.
Laura, what are you having for a snack?
- L A
U R A.
-  You spell your name?
You guys looking for your letters?
-  Oh here's an A, that's a V.
-  E J.
- Caleb.
-  Nailed it.
I bet you're wishing
your name was super long.
Then you could eat a really long one.
Is this eight because you're
turning eight next week?
- Eight, E J.
-  Eight, Elise Johnston.
(upbeat music)
Before we hit the beach,
we're getting a treat
from a place called the Baked Bear.
Apparently they make really good
custom ice cream sandwiches
and ice cream sandwiches.
- Hopefully it's good.
-  Ice cream's
almost always good right?
- Well, it doesn't mean if
it looks good it tastes good.
-  That's a good point.
- So they actually take a donut
and do an ice cream
sandwich out of a donut.
(techno music)
I'm just gonna sample everything first.
(techno music)
- That looks yummy.
-  Did you see how they made it?
Oh, the snicker doodle one looks so good.
- Thank you for more than anyone on Earth.
It looks so good.
-  Thank you.
-  Go ahead.
What flavor is the blue one?
- Cotton Candy.
- It's so good.
-  What is it?
- I don't know what it's-
- It's like cotton candy.
-  It's good?
Oh you put a brownie on bottom.
- This is the way that
I like to eat ice cream,
with cookies and brownies,
so this is awesome.
She was just reaching for it so cutely.
That's her first bite of a sweet.
- Donut with cookies and
cream ice cream and sprinkles.
- I don't know if you guys know this
but cookies are absolutely
my favorite treat.
They're pretty much my
love language practically.
I really adore a delicious cookie
and those cookies were good.
I like the ice cream sandwiches,
but really I just wanna go
back and eat all the cookies.
Where are we at?
- The beach!
(guitar music)
- We made it to the beach
and we couldn't find parking
so Jeremy dropped the kids and I off
and all of our gear, so
we're gonna go get set up
and then he'll join us.
- I wanna go down there by the water.
- I'm feeling a little
bit like Super Woman now,
I've got five kids alone at
the beach and we're alive.
I told the kids not to get in the water
until Jeremy gets here to join us.
We've got a little beach camp all set up.
What'd you find?
- Sea shell.
-  That's not a
sea shell, that's sea weed.
- I found it in here.
-  Well good job.
What did you make?
A Spanish hat?
Very nice.
Boys are playing football.
(cheers)
Nice one.
What do you think?
She's sitting on the blanket,
but she's reaching over
to try to see what in the world this is.
What is that?
So Janae, all on her own,
reached over and shoveled some sand.
Oh, this water's cold.
(upbeat music)
- I'm collecting sea shells.
-  Fun.
- Sea shells and cold legs.
(screams)
- I'm flying!
(upbeat music)
- So it was hot today
like over 80 degrees,
but that water is still freezing cold.
(upbeat music)
- Look at these sea shells.
-  Let me see them.
Good ones.
Janae, you playing with the sand?
Digging.
Oh that's a cool shell.
Oh, eat the sand.
Eat the sand.
You're wet.
What happened?
- I fell.
- But he's going back in.
(upbeat music)
(screams)
(upbeat music)
- Poll question, what
is your favorite thing
to do at the beach?
Let us know up here.
- Making sandcastles.
- Janae is into it too.
-  She is, she is.
-  She is all in,
she came scooching down
more and more.
My parents both grew up near the beach
and they took us kids to the beach
every chance they had growing up.
So it's really special to
have them here with us today
because I know how much
they love the beach.
So to be able to see them sharing that
with my kids is special.
Time to Boogie Board.
(cheers)
(upbeat music)
-  Hey Elise, good job.
You rode it all the way in.
-  You did it.
- Such a good workout and
it's really nostalgic for me
to be out in the ocean.
There's just nothing quite like it.
The waves are so powerful.
-  What were you doing?
- Just like body surfing out there.
Really fun.
(upbeat music)
What do you think of Boogie Boarding?
- I like it.
-  It's a good one.
(cheers)
-  Ride it, ride it.
Touchdown.
- We're gonna put Janae's
feet in the water.
-  She's anxious.
She wants in.
That's sand.
Isn't that fun?
- Let's stand up.
Stand up.
-  She's walking on the sand.
Oh my goodness.
(laughter)
(upbeat music)
Looks like down at the pier,
there's clams all on the poles.
Laura, what do you think of the pier?
(upbeat music)
(laughter)
- This is so fun.
(upbeat music)
So Muga made us her
amazing spaghetti sauce
and we have spaghetti squash
and it's already to go.
-  And we're doing
grateful raspberries.
- I don't have a raspberry at the moment,
but I'm grateful for the really
warm weather that we had today.
We got to really enjoy the beach.
- I'm grateful for showers
'cause if we didn't shower,
then we would be all sandy and yucky.
(easy music)
-  Bumped against the boat stairs
and Jack was the first out.
- Goodnight, J House out.
- It's a little teeny tiny.
(upbeat music)
