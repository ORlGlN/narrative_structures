- You are editing a blog.
Do you like it?
- So my awesome Aunt Kay sent us this kit.
Roll it up.
So Jeremy and I are trying to make
an important decision today.
I'm just, I still don't
know what we should do.
- All my kids are hiding.
- How did you know?
(exciting music)
- Laura, do you have footie pajamas?
- Yeah!
- Are they warm and snuggly?
- Yeah.
- You look so cute.
- We're going to put the
Christmas tree right there.
- We are gonna put a Christmas tree there.
- Yeah.
- Pretty soon.
What things are you looking at outside?
- Leaves and trees.
This is Jenae in her footie pajamas.
- She has footie pajamas, too.
- I love Jenae.
- Me, too.
- She's so cute.
- Laura, what are you doing?
- Making his bed.
- Making Cubbie's bed for him.
Why are you doing that?
- Because, I'm his sister.
- That is really nice of you.
Thanks for making his bed.
That's good right there, you
can just pull the blanket up.
Alright, thank you.
- You're welcome.
- That's a good way to
show people you love em
is to do nice things for em.
- Caleb is a little bit mean to me today.
- Then why did you do
something nice for him?
- Because.
- Because why.
- I like to play with
him and sing with him.
- Even though he's mean sometimes?
I think that's what it means
to be a brother and a sister.
Sometimes we're mean to each other
but you still like em.
You like to play with them.
I love you big girl.
- I love you, too.
- I don't want to delete that part.
- You wanna delete it?
- Yeah.
- Your in and out point.
Isacc, what are you doing this morning?
- I'm editing.
- We've been wanting a long time
to like teach our kids how to edit.
So today I taught Isaac and the kids
a couple basic skills and
they're trying it out.
- He cut something out.
- Speed it up.
- Or slow mo.
- So the kids are looking at music now
to put with their clips
that they're editing.
So, Isaac, what kind of music
do you want right there?
- Happy.
- Happy music, so you
can pick emotions, too.
Here we go, happy.
- Oh, actually, I think bright.
- I like this one.
(snappy music)
- Alright, so now you're
going to download it.
So you drag the song down
on to audio level two.
Now you have the song there.
Alright listen to it with the
edits and see what you think.
(baby yelling)
- You like it?
(feet stomping)
How did it look?
- I like it.
- I love how the music is lining up
with the noises from the toaster.
Do you see that?
- Yeah.
- You are editing a vlog.
Do you like it?
- Yeah!
- So editing takes a lot of work,
you put a lot of time into that
and then you only get to
see like 10 seconds of it.
- Let's see this clip.
- She can always push
undo, too, which is great.
Alright, so you pick
the color you want it.
Did it work?
- Uh huh.
- Good job.
Okay so now you can start
making your edits on that scene.
- Can we make a time lapse?
- Is the camera still enough for ya?
- Oh, for sure.
- We have a lot of apples.
So my awesome Aunt Kay sent us this kit.
And it has everything that we need
to make some caramel apples.
So we thought we'd give it a try.
I've honestly never made
caramel apples before.
I have made caramel onions
which the kids reminded
me of this morning.
Did you like caramel onions?
- I liked the caramel.
- So now should we make
real caramel apples?
- Yes!
- So Caleb and Laura are
removing the stickers.
I love caramel apples so I'm
really excited to try this.
- So I just got home from the office
and all my kids are hiding.
She jumped out and surprised me.
Should I go find Isaac and Elise?
I found Nene, let's see
where they could be.
He he (laughing).
- How did you know?
- I found you!
- Yes!
- Alright, let's see, under the bed.
Trying to find him,
could be in the closet.
You never know, he's not in the dryer.
- I don't advise hiding in dryers.
- No, don't hide in the
dryer, that's not safe.
Or the oven, he's not under here.
Let's see, this is kind of suspicious.
(laughing)
Found you!
- Take out those two.
- That was a good spot.
Don't tell me where he is.
- I have no idea where he is.
- Not in there.
- He can hide in the basement.
- Let's see, nope.
Where can he be?
Where is he?
There he is! (laughs)
Last one!
- I know, that's like
my favorite hiding spot.
- It's a good spot, good job, you guys.
I found all of them, what
are we doing now you guys?
- Making caramel apples.
- Did you get it?
- Not all the way, it's
like when you pull a weed.
- You got the stump left?
So we got out the needle nose pliers.
- I mean that's pretty good.
- That's good, it'll work.
Good idea, Caleb on
the needle nose pliers.
Then we have to wash
all these apples next.
(folk music)
- We gotta lot of helpers.
- Jeremy is now going
to use his brute force.
- To stab apples.
- It's gotta be in there pretty good.
- I think it's pretty good.
(folk music)
- Yay!
- You add sweetened condense
milk to the caramel.
- Cause it needs a little more goodness.
- This is going to be pretty good.
(upbeat music)
- The caramel's ready.
- I think we did it, I
think it turned in caramel,
you guys see this.
- Ooh.
(upbeat music)
- Ooh.
- What do you think?
Roll it up.
Whoa.
- That is mine!
- Spin it, spin it, good job, pull it out.
Woo!
(upbeat music)
You did it!
Now before they dry, we
have to add the toppings.
- Decorate 'em.
(upbeat music)
- It's already not sticking.
Maybe I should just have
done these one at a time?
- Great method, Isaac.
- Nice.
- We're first timers.
- Eyes, nose, and a smile.
- Very cool, it's like a person.
(tinkly music)
- This is my brain.
- Did you do your brain
for your caramel apple?
- This is the math area,
this is the reading area,
and all the rest of it is
stuff that I know and do.
- So we're going to cut up
a few of these to share.
(upbeat music)
- Does it hurt to eat it,
Elise, without that tooth?
- I'll have another tooth.
- You got a little bit on your face!
- This is so good.
- That's awkward.
- So Jeremy and I are trying
to make an important decision today.
And it's stressful, it
deals with some money
and some time and time and
money are stressful things.
And I've made pros and cons lists
and Jeremy and I have talked about it
and talked about and talked about it.
And it's so hard, I feel like
there's no clear decision.
Usually when you talk about
stuff and you make a list
and you really think about it.
Like one decision kind
of rises above the rest.
And this time I still don't
know what we should do.
And what matters most is
what lasts the longest.
And what lasts the longest is family
and memories and relationships.
And becoming the people
that we need to become.
So I'm going to try to prioritize that
and see if that makes
the decision more clear.
What do you think we should do?
- Make caramel apples.
- You think we should make caramel apples?
(mellow music)
- We're at Isaac's basketball evaluation
and they're trying on their uniforms,
seeing what size he'll be
and we've been in line
for over 30 minutes.
There's ton's of people here.
We're almost getting to the point
where he gets to play basketball.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Go.
(exciting music)
- Well you did a great job.
- Thanks.
- I'm done.
- Good night, J House out.
- So how do you feel
about the dentist looking at your teeth?
- Good.
- It's a little bit nervous making,
it looks under construction.
- Open your mouth.
