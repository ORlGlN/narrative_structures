- He just bumped his lip.
- It's bleeding.
- Is it bleeding?
Should we wipe it off or do
you just wanna go back down?
- Go back down.
- Do you wanna go back down and play?
- It hurts right here.
See, it hurts right there.
- Can you smile?
It's okay.
He doesn't mind when he's bleeding.
Well, let's just rinse your
mouth out real quick, okay bud?
You just wanna go play?
(fun Christmas music)
Here, Caleb.
(screaming)
(laughing)
-  So what are you guys up to?
- We have water balloons.
-  You made water balloons?
-  And we're coming in
the bathtub to squish them.
-  Here's the pile of
water balloons that they made
and Caleb, what are you doing?
-  I'm stomping on it.
-  You're throwing them.
You're trying to get 'em to break?
- Mhm.
-  Thanks for
trying to get 'em to break
in the bathtub, guys, that was nice of ya.
Okay, time to get ready for church.
- It's Sunday?
-  It is Sunday.
Elise, get it out of your mouth.
- It's Sunday, it's Sunday, it's Sunday.
It's church, it's church, it's church.
- Okay, let's go get ready for church.
We bribed them that when
they got in their car seats,
we would give them each
a piece of Hi-Chew during the drive.
- It was very effective,
we're gonna need more Hi-Chew.
- We're on our way to church
and we are running a little bit late
but we are all clean, we are all fed.
We all brushed our teeth.
We're dressed.
I'm counting it as a success anyway
but we were in a hurry as
we were getting ready to go
and I was the last one to get dressed
and so I put on my skirt
and then I grabbed the nearest shirt
and I was like eh, this will work
and it was the shirt that I wore yesterday
to the Christmas concert
and so immediately it runs
through my brain like,
okay, it's not really dirty.
I only wore it for the
Christmas concert yesterday
but will anybody see me yesterday,
today that saw me yesterday?
And I was like no, I'm
good and I put it on
and then I was like, wait a minute.
I daily vlog, everybody's gonna see.
The shirt was on the video yesterday.
I have to wear a new shirt so
thanks for keeping me honest.
Issac, do you wanna hang one up?
'Cause we're gonna take turns.
This one says Our First Christmas.
-  Mom, is it my turn?
- Every year growing up, my
mom and dad got each of us kids
a special ornament and
so my name and the date,
the year that I was given it
is on the back of all of our ornaments
and it's really special
just because I have a specific memory
attached to all of them.
- This little girl knew she
was missing out on the fun.
She did not wanna go to bed.
We having fun out here?
- This ornament is super special to me.
It is from my grandparents'
tree and I love it.
They both passed away in 2010
and so it's special to have something
from their Christmas tree.
This one is from my grandmother.
She got it when I was born
and it says my birthday
and how much I weighed
and what time I was born.
This one my sister got for me
when she went to Jerusalem.
These are some special ornaments
that we made last year.
Let's see, I think I wrote on 'em.
Isaac.
Elise.
- There.
- Right there?
That's a great spot for it.
♫ Like a diamond in the sky
♫ Twinkle twinkle little star
-  Uh oh, this
looks a little dangerous.
- Good job.
Fail.
-  Okay, ready?
Put it on together.
- There we go.
-  Yay.
