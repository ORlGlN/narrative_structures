- So we were invited out by one
of the local news
stations to come and show
the kids around to see what
happens at a news station.
(bright music)
- What?
♪ Say goodbye, say goodbye ♪
-  No, that'd be
a good anniversary gift.
- And he got the curtains hung up.
So the boys are supposed to
be doing their handwriting
and their spelling work right now,
but they figured out
something that's way more fun.
(playful music)
- Ah! (laughs)
-  What?
- Awesome.
-  What did you guys create?
- It's a canapault.
- It's a catapult.
- Catapult.
-  I thought
you said a cannonball.
- I hold it like this
and then he launches it.
Isaac, can I have a turn to launch it?
- So we're gonna do this for a minute,
and then do spelling and handwriting.
What?
(lively rock music)
Whoa.
-  Our second time.
(laughing)
It went--
And a sock this one.
-  Whoa.
Whoa, good one Isaac.
Whoa.
Whoa.
It's Jeremy.
- Hey.
- Hey, it's me and my camera.
- Hi camera.
(upbeat music)
So we were invited out by one
of the local news stations
to come and show the kids around
to see what happens at a news station
and answer some questions
about our service celebration that we did.
- Elise,
right?
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.
Laura, is that your name?
- Yeah.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
And Janae.
- Yes.
- This is Cody.
He's the one who invited us out.
(lively music)
- So this is where we
get all of our stories
for the day and then we go out
and we put 'em together.
And there's a map of the different areas.
Do you know your--
- Is that the red like
where all the storms are?
(lively music)
-  Guys look,
they're filming right there.
- So this is the assignment desk.
You see all the scanners over there,
all the green lights?
If you look at all the TVs up here,
they all have something different on them,
so you can see the forecast.
This is Greg.
You've probably seen
Mom and Dad edit, right?
- So they use the same program in editing
that we use and it's been fun for the kids
to see that, because they've
been learning how to use it.
-  We've got a junior editor here.
- Well I have a couple
of computers at home.
- They've been learning.
- And you hear the reporter talking,
you don't see him on
camera a lot of times,
-  Oh.
- It's a voiceover.
- Record here,
- it's kind of a old
microphone, but you can--
-  It's like the sound studio.
- Breaking news.
- Just recorded it, see?
- Oh they recorded it.
-  Breaking News.
- Did you hear yourself?
- Hey, cool.
- When we record something,
then Greg will take that and go edit
it up on the computer.
- These are cards?
- Yeah, they have to store--
- No, so this is from a long time ago--
-  Those are DVC tapes there.
- So you see that red light
that's hanging up above?
That means that they're on TV right now.
(bright music)
- Thank you so much sweetheart.
What are your names?
- Caleb.
- Caleb.
- What's your name?
-  Laura.
- Laura.
- Isaac.
- Isaac, I love that name.
- Elise.
- Elise.
-  Janae.
- You're too little to tell your name.
- She says I'm Janae.
- She's smiling at me though.
(bright music)
- This is Rob and Rachel.
Say hi.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- We never get visitors.
- You guys want a picture up here?
- Sure.
- Oh absolutely.
-  So Caleb, what's
going on in the news?
- At least it's warmer than it use to.
-  There you go.
-  Hey you're better
than me, my friend.
- And iPads.
Those have our scripts too sometimes.
- And you see the white
letters on the screen there?
-  Is that what you say?
-  A lot of times, yeah.
(bright music)
-  It's on TV now.
-  And then the cold air
just comes down to the south.
(bright music)
-  So he goes through
that and then he tells--
-  You're
directing today's show,
get up in there.
-  Caleb's the director.
- Stand by camera one.
-  Ready one.
- Ready one.
- Ready one.
-  Take one.
- Take one.
-  Good job.
-  And then that
means they're gonna go
right to that camera or
right to that picture.
- Take camera two.
-  Alright.
Yeah.
(clapping)
- Stand by to roll 61.
-  And roll 61.
- Roll 61.
-  And take it.
- Take it.
- Alright, good job.
- Awesome.
- Stand by camera one.
Ready one and take one.
-  Do you guys see
all those buttons down there?
(bright music)
- Once we get home, I'm
gonna be the news director.
-  You're gonna pretend?
- Mmm-hmm.
(lively enchanting music)
- Oh yeee! (laughing)
(laughing)
-  Try to look at the camera,
so you can see the camera while looking.
-  Cover your ears
when you're talking about the traffic.
- So we're getting run into by traffic.
(laughing)
-  Is there a
traffic jam or it's the--
- No, it's perfectly fine,
- It's just completely good.
but we need a little--
- Good.
(lively enchanting music)
- The reporter comes in,
and I see some of the screens over here.
'Cause you probably remember
when Dad started this thing.
- It's kind of changed,
like at the beginning, I
didn't think it was a big deal,
but now it's a lot different
than it used to be.
-  See ya.
-  So what did you guys think
of seeing the news place?
- That was awesome.
- I liked it.
- What I liked about it
was like we looked on the TV
and it was the people you
normally see in the desk,
then we looked straight the other way
and it was the real people.
-  That's so cool.
-  Look at all those satellites,
so those are for receiving the shows
that we watch on TV.
(bright guitar music)
- Well that was really cool to get to see
the behind the scenes of a news station
and now we have one problem,
and it's that I'm starving
so we decided to go somewhere fun to eat.
We're gonna take the kids
to one of our favorite
spots, Ginger Sue's.
So we're here at the restaurant
and this might've been a really bad idea.
Jeremy has already had to
take two different kids
out of the restaurant,
just to remind them how
we behave in restaurants.
Everybody's back now, and
I'm hoping that we can have
some good behavior, because
it can be really fun,
but maybe the kids are just too tired
from already behaving
well at the news station.
- You drinking out of a straw?
(sweet music)
- I forgot her bib.
-  It's gonna get messy.
- It's gonna get messy.
-  I have a good idea.
You could use that.
- You could tie around her neck.
- Do you guys think this would
make a good bib, like this?
Got one.
I am prepared.
-  It was in the bag.
- Of course Mama's--
-  Those look good.
-  These kids are getting good.
I remember when I had to
butter and cut all of these.
- Elise is my helper.
We're gonna go and try to get curtains.
(jazzy bright music)
So before we put our Christmas tree in,
we want to put some blinds up
in our front room.
Elise is here to help me pick 'em out.
- That's one that I really like.
-  I think that's
one of my favorites too.
I'm just not sure how white
would look in that front room.
Maybe Mom would like that for Christmas.
No, that would be a good anniversary gift.
Just kidding.
So this bright light just comes in.
- And it's super hot.
-  Yeah.
- Is it kinda like that?
-  Yeah, for sure.
I think it needs both sides though.
- So the challenge will be
opening and shutting them,
-  Yeah.
- 'Cause I can't really climb
up like this all the time.
And I still want to see my pretty view.
I think that's why people have like ties.
I like how it blocks the light,
I don't like how it blocks the view.
You dancin'?
(upbeat music)
-  Come on.
Do do do--
Alright, we're seeing what it looks like.
How are you feelin' about it?
- I'm not sure yet.
-  Nae Nae hates 'em.
-  Do you have enough
help to hang the curtain rods?
- I think I need a couple
more kids, little ones,
little itty bitty kids to help me.
-  Janae?
- No, she is not--
- So since we went to
the news this morning,
the kids have wanted to play pretend,
that they are putting on the news.
So they've been researching
and they're getting ready
to put on the news.
So what do you have there Caleb?
- It's the Earth is getting bigger.
-  Where did you
get this information?
- From it's news for kids.
-  And you wrote
up a little summary of it?
- Yeah.
-  And you're gonna present it?
Awesome.
And what's your topic gonna be Isaac?
- Sports.
-  The sports stuff,
what are you gonna be doing Elise?
- Weather and traffic.
-  Alright, you guys ready?
-  Yeah.
- We're gonna try to put on the news.
I've just set up some lights for fun
and I'm gonna run the camera.
No laughing, you're gonna
be doing the news, okay?
Three two one,
(dramatic news music)
you're live.
- Welcome you all to J House Action news.
(playful music)
(laughing)
(Jeremy laughing)
-  What comes next?
- The big story for today
is that the Earth is getting brighter.
So now we're gonna cut to the weather.
-  And action.
(lively music)
- I'm so glad I can tell
you about the weather today.
Today it will be sunny,
as you see over here.
And tonight, there will be a tornado watch
and in Seattle, it's
gonna be sunny and rainy
over here, and this week,
it will be warm and sunny.
And I hope you like it.
We would like to go to sports.
-  And action.
- Today I'm gonna tell you about
what's happening in college football.
Last week the top two teams got defeated
and they were both undefeated.
There's only room for four
teams in the playoffs.
I think those teams are
the Wisconsin Badgers,
Auburn Tigers, Clemson Tigers,
and Oklahoma Sooners.
I think the Sooners will be the champions,
because they have an awesome quarterback,
Baker Mayfield and they have an awesome D.
Back to Elise for traffic.
- I'm so excited to see you again.
The road is pretty cool,
(bright music)
and you can see, there
is a few car crashes
and the police have been driving crazy
with all the car crashes.
Now as you can see, they're
all pretty good now.
And now we'll go back to Caleb.
- We all welcome you all
back to today's top story,
about the Earth getting brighter.
(laughing)
(Jeremy laughing)
Ah!
(drumming table)
So why the Earth is
getting brighter is because
all the builders--
(laughing)
(Jeremy laughing)
-  Okay cut.
And action.
(laughing)
And--
(laughing)
-  Okay.
- So why the--
(dramatic music)
(laughing)
Do it again.
So why the Earth is getting brighter,
is because the builders
keep building more houses
and the Christmas lights
make the Earth brighter,
and it's a blue planet.
So it's amazing.
And if you want to explore it,
explore it with your telescope.
And we will end the day
with a saying goodbye song.
♪ Say goodbye, say goodbye ♪
(laughing)
This is, we will say goodbye,
because, (yelling)
♪ Say goodbye, say goodbye ♪
♪ To the pain of the past ♪
-  What?
(laughing)
- 
Traffic is shut down
in the meantime.
-  Do you see where
the news anchors are laughing?
- What was the question that stumped him?
(Anderson Cooper laughing)
-  He's laughing.
Real news casters breaking into laughter
and unable to stop.
(laugh-crying)
(laughing)
So we held off on putting up the curtains.
We're gonna wait until
a little bit later this evening.
(sizzling)
Look at what Kendra is making for dinner.
- Chicken quesadillas.
-  It's kinda like
Mexican pizza at Taco Bell.
-  What are they?
These are chicken quesadillas.
-  Inspired by Thanksgiving.
- Yes, I ate a bunch of these
for lunch at Thanksgiving.
What do you guys think of the
grilled chicken quesadillas?
- I like 'em.
- Look at this.
-  You already ate it all?
It was so good, huh?
Here's my plate.
- I love love love it.
- I love it.
- Well I'm really proud of Jeremy,
he got the curtains hung up.
You are Superman.
- Is it really that big of a deal
to hang up curtains?
-  Dude, we have
been married for 13 years
and we've lived in 10 different houses,
and we've never hung curtains.
- I mean we've done it in the kids' room.
- Well that's true, good point.
I think Jeremy did a
great job hanging them up.
My big question is if I like 'em or not.
I think I was thinking
something a little more floral,
I don't know how I feel about the blue.
- I remind you of the paint color.
- Yeah.
- Kendra really didn't like
it, when we got it painted.
- Like really didn't like it.
- Like we almost redid it.
And I was like give it some time.
- And then I ended up liking it.
So we're gonna give this some time.
We're gonna wake up in the morning,
see what we think of it.
But in the comments,
let us know what you think of these.
- I think you need to see
'em in the sunlight too.
-  I don't think it'll show
hand prints on the kids very much.
It's kind of a nice blue.
- J House out.
-  She broke her leg?
- Mmm-hmm.
(bright music)
-  You have to go to surgery?
- Oh, we forgot to put you asleep.
- Good job.
- And I can't find it,
and it makes me mad.
