- Can our neighbors hear us?
-  Pretty good.
There's our pallets.
- We need a forklift.
-  What's for
breakfast today Mono?
Did we do cream of wheat?
- Hum.
-  You guys nene has
a pretty bad cold coming on,
she's all snotty.
She didn't sleep super well.
(fast upbeat music)
- Whatcha doing cub?
- I am getting ready for scouts.
-  You want to be just
like your big brother huh.
Is this your scout shirt?
Right here, wearing it inside out?
- Yeah, I could just couldn't
find anything blue so I just
did something inside out.
What are handkerchiefs?
-  People used to
use them to blow their nose.
And scouts use them as ties.
- Cool.
-  Are you a boy scout?
- Yep.
- I used to know how to do this
when I was a scout but I can't remember
exactly how it works.
-  So why are you
all dressed up this morning?
- For the pine wood derby.
-  Pine wood derby.
Whatcha making?
- I'm getting ready for
the pinewood derby today.
-  Are you putting stuff
on your shoulders like a boy scout?
- I have to be ready for boy scouts.
(upbeat music)
-  Alright, I think we got it.
It's pretty good, pretty good.
Looking good.
Did Elise help you out?
- Presenting Caleb the scout.
Kid.
- Thanks for helping him.
Well I'm feeling really bad,
we tested it out.
And the car is barely able to make it down
the track so we might
lose every single event.
(fast music)
-  Three, two, one.
Go, and in the
lane number two takes the victory.
Oh, that's close.
Lane number one.
Ladies and gentlemen, judges are ready.
- Well Issac's car did terrible.
We lost every race by a lot.
We barely made it down the track
and I feel terrible as a Dad.
Because I wanted to help
him make a good track
and it's a lot more fun
when you win but it is
important to lean how to lose.
And Issac was pretty upset,
he was really sad.
But he took it really well,
and he wanted to come back in
and cheer for his friends and I was really
proud of him for choosing to do that
and being a good sport.
- That was fast.
-  Good job buddy.
So how are you feeling
about the pinewood derby?
- Pretty disappointed.
-  So what do
you want to do next year?
- Do a wedge.
-  Yeah, a simple design.
- Uh huh.
-  I think
that's a good idea.
(classical music)
-  Where we going?
- To heart to heart.
(upbeat music)
- Oh, there's a dog.
- So we're here at the headquarters
for Heart to Heart
and they have a dog in their office
which is like the coolest thing.
So we initially drove
to the headquarters
of Heart to Heart
but their operations hub
is just up the road so
we're heading there now.
-  Whoa.
-  This is your safety equipment.
-  Oh good.
- And we have some
equipment for Issac okay.
-  There you go.
Issac.
- Cool.
- There you go.
-  Gotta keep it safe.
-  You're welcome.
- It says Heart to Heart.
- Since Laura's gone, I'm using hers.
- Now do you guys know
where Puerto Rico is?
- Yes.
- No.
- Let's go look and see alright.
- So we just heard that one
of the pallets that we did
at out service celebration
has already been sent off to Puerto Rico.
And a couple of them are
getting ready to leave soon.
- There.
- Very good, that's
excellent so Puerto Rico
is way down here where my finger is okay.
You know it as Pico de Gallo.
Here's a map of the island.
And you see anything familiar on there?
- The J.
J house.
- That's right.
So it's called Carolina.
That is were your palette
of hygiene kits are today okay.
- So we're going to try
to find our other
palettes today in the warehouse.
(upbeat music)
- This box weighs eight pounds.
It's 2.1 cubic feet.
For such a little box.
- I've written down every place
in this entire warehouse
where your hygiene kits are.
-  Be looking for it.
-  Just be looking okay.
-  We were in row 51.
But what row is she in?
- 52.
-  Let's see if we can find 52.
And then it's 15.
- Found it.
-  Way to go Elise.
-  We found it.
-  Let's work together
on the others okay.
-  Three and four.
- Found it.
-  Good job.
- Found it.
-  Hey, good.
-  You got it too!
There's our palettes.
- While Jeremy is on his errand,
with the big kids I'm home
with Laura and Janae.
And Janae's napping so Laura and I
are getting to have some
special one on one time.
We're working on puzzles
and I'm doing lots
and lots of laundry because
we are getting packed
because we are going to be
going somewhere on a trip.
Our friends don't know where we're going.
Yep, that's where we're going
but they don't know that.
- I know.
- It's a secret.
Shu.
So in the comments, I would love to hear
your guesses.
The only hint that I'll give you is we are
going to see people who you've already met
in our Vlogs before.
Alright, so poll question.
How do you think we are
going to be traveling.
Up here let us know.
Are we going to be
traveling by plane or by car
or by boat or by train
or by bike.
How do you think we're going to get
to where we're going?
Where do you think we're going?
And who do you think we're going to see?
And we'd love to hear
if you're traveling for
Thanksgiving and where you are going.
Alright Laura is dying and
she has to tell the secret.
Where are we going?
So Janae is actually not
feeling very well today.
She's got lots of boogers going on,
we've been wiping her nose constantly.
And suctioning boogers out.
She hasn't been too fussy
but she has been pretty clingy.
So we'll make it through today.
-  So this is like
a mobile hospital or medical place
and they took this down to Houston
and Florida during the hurricanes.
If there is a huge storm
and all the hospitals are closed down
or there's problems with
the hospitals, where do
all those people go?
- Here.
-  What happens to their medicine?
There's just a need there and
so heart to heart is trained
to help people with their medical needs
when there's a disaster.
Hopefully there's no keys in there.
-  No there's not.
-  You guys off to
take care of people in trouble?
- Yep, we're gonna drive away.
Wee.
- I'm glad I weighed all of you,
now I know exactly.
- So we're gonna radio for
a forklift to come and move out palette,
wrap it and get it ready
to ship out to Puerto Rico.
- Mr. Rick are you there?
-  Yes, go ahead.
- We need a forklift.
- 418 B and 318 B.
-  The forklift is coming.
Oh.
- Can we weigh and wrap it?
- Alrighty, I'll go over to the wrapper
and you can follow me over there.
We're gonna spread it over the top there.
Put some tape on there.
- Could I get wrapped up?
-  And we'll ship
you off to Puerto Rico?
- Yes.
-  Perfect.
- Give a hug to the palette.
Okay, poll question.
How much do you think it weighs you guys?
Don't look first, what do you think?
- 200.
-  200 pounds?
- Maybe 46?
-  46 pounds.
- Well if there are 30 boxes, 1,200.
-  1,200 pounds?
- Let's come and see how much it weighs.
I didn't hold one of the boxes so that
is a disadvantage.
I'm gonna go with 1,500 pounds.
So it was 550 pounds.
- Hi Don.
- How's it going yo.
-  Laura's been really
getting into puzzles lately
and I love that she can sit
quietly ad play with them
for a little bit.
Did you do it?
- Yes.
- Good work.
You did all four of these.
-  We're playing
follow the leader with Nene.
Do it with her.
(baby gurgling)
(kids gurgling)
We've done this with all of our kids
where we play follow the leader with them
tapping on the table.
It's so fun.
- Can our neighbors hear us?
-  I don't think they can hear us.
- Good night, J House out.
- Hi guys.
-  Hi guys.
- I wanted to weigh this.
- Tonight is bring your
parent to ballet night.
- What if our house was made out of candy?
