- Ooh
- Oh no!
- Uh oh!
(upbeat music)
-  Yeah!
Brown, gray and yellow.
- I got pink!
My favorite color!
(upbeat music)
Today we're doing the
three marker challenge.
(upbeat music)
-  Okay, who's ready?
-  Me!
- This is our first drawing.
We have three minutes to draw
it with only three markers.
-  Alright Caleb,
pick your three markers.
(upbeat music)
Three.
- Ooh.
-  What do you got?
This is gonna be hard.
-  Okay, go ahead Elise.
(upbeat music)
Look at the three colors.
-  That's pretty good.
-  Those are pretty.
- I'm excited. (laughs)
(upbeat music)
Oh!
-  Ooh, look at those colors.
-  You got good!
- One...
-  What?!
-  Nice, good colors.
-  Alright, shall we see how it goes?
-  Yes!
-  Alright, three
minutes are on the clock.
Ready, go.
(energetic music)
Isaac's taking advantage
of having a green.
Laura, I like your blue water.
(energetic music)
- My marker's going dead.
-  Well, just keep doing
the best you can with it.
So we initially gave
you guys three minutes,
but that's almost up.
So we're gonna give you a
couple more minutes, okay?
-  Okay.
(funky music)
-  Does the fish have turquoise eyes?
So we're going to have
about one more minute.
Is that okay, everyone?
- Uh huh.
- Yeah, because I'm gonna
finish my fish tomorrow.
-  Yeah.
If you can't finish now
you'll just do it tomorrow.
- I need yellow.
-  Did you grab a yellow?
- Nope.
-  Aw, man.
- Can you give me a yellow?
-  No, you just get to use
these three that you picked.
It's hard, huh?
- Yes.
-  Alright everybody
finished their's up.
Here's Caleb's
and Elise
and Isaac
and Laura.
- Let us know in the poll
which one is your favorite.
-  Caleb, I think the
black was a hard color to have.
- Since I had a bit extra time,
I added some, like, makeup.
-  And you decided
not to do the water,
which worked out just
fine leaving it white.
- Yeah.
-  That looks really good,
and I like the makeup addition.
- I really liked my colors.
They were pretty easy to work with,
but I was going pretty
fast on the water and stuff
that I just decided I could
do the sky, the water,
and the snail.
- I liked my colors,
but I wish I got yellow.
-  Yeah, you wanted yellow.
That is hard, but to only use three.
- You did really well with those colors.
I wouldn't be able to even
think of lipstick on mine.
-  Okay, who wants
to try another one?
-  Me!
-  Alright.
- This is our next drawing.
-  Alright.
- It's kinda difficult.
-  Yep.
(peppy music)
(squeaking)
Alright, good colors.
- I got pink!
My favorite color!
(peppy music)
- Blue, battery charge blue,
that was one I got last time,
green.
(squeaking)
- Ooh
- Oh no!
(laughing)
- Uh oh!
It's actually a different yellow.
-  Is it?
They look exactly the same to me.
- No, this one's a little brighter.
(peppy music)
- Green, orange, and pink.
-  Okay.
-  These are gonna be
some funny-looking rainbows.
-  On your mark,
get set,
go!
And Elise begins with yellow.
(both laughing)
I really like how you're doing the tree.
Looks good, buddy.
(peppy music)
That's a beautiful color, Laura.
- Thanks.
-  Janea just woke up from her nap.
- Ah!
-  Yeah.
Yeah those are fun.
- Oh.
-  Lisey had the two color challenge.
- (laughs) I'm done.
-  You're done?
- Yep.
-  You finished
that in like a minute.
(energetic music)
-  Laura, I love it!
That's your name!
- I made thunder.
It's his eyes.
I just need connect them
which will make it look like thunder.
- Thunder! Boom boom!
- I should make some thunder.
-  Here's Laura's three colors.
And her finished project.
Isaac with the blue and the green.
Lisey with the two yellows.
And Caleb with the
orange, green, and pink.
So Lisey, how was that to
only really have two colors.
- Um, it was okay.
-  Laura, I love that you
added rain there at the end.
- I like how one cloud's
pink and one cloud's white.
-  Yeah.
- I like the yellow, and the green.
(dad laughs)
I like the light blue and the dark blue
enough together that I
didn't even add the green.
It looks nice.
- Let us know which one's your favorite.
- This is our next one!
(upbeat music)
-  Brown, gray, and yellow.
Not very exciting.
(upbeat music)
-  Yellow, black,
and a light mint green.
- That's really good.
-  Black is hard, because
what do you do with black?
It's a tough color.
- I'll just color it lightly on.
- Okay, this would be chocolate,
and these would be the sprinkles.
-  Good colors!
(laughing)
Blue, green, and pink.
-  You're the only one
who didn't get a dark color.
(energetic music)
- First, my fav--
my two favorite colors.
Pink and green and blue.
(energetic music)
-  Your cherry has blue and green?
- And pink.
-  Obviously.
Laura your creativity is a lot of fun.
- I am done!
-  You keep finishing
way before everybody else.
(Elise groans)
(upbeat music)
(baby growls)
-  So what color are you
gonna color the ice cream?
- Nothing.
-  Just leave it white?
-  Yeah.
-  Vanilla.
Instead of a cherry it's a green apple?
-  Yeah.
-  Okay, I'm done.
-  You did good
with the gray, Isaac.
-  Laura, yours remind
me of a rainbow sno-cone.
Alright here's Caleb's,
Elise,
Isaac,
and Laura.
- In the poll, let us know
which one's your favorite.
- I love it!
-  I would like to eat that.
- I'm always gonna do pretty
drawings.
- Out of all these
I would want to eat this one.
- I'm gonna eat this one and that one.
- And that one and that one.
(upbeat music)
-  Thanks for watching!
- Thank for watching!
-  J House out.
(upbeat music)
-  Now we're headed
to an escape room.
(energetic music)
-  He's going!
