- So I put Janae in
shoes for the first time.
-  Uh oh.
- Today I'm getting baptized.
- Oh, whoa!
(upbeat music)
-  Elise, what's
special about today?
- Today I'm getting baptized.
-  I'm so excited for you.
And we have some special
guests who came in to see it.
- A lot of special guests.
-  Who?
- Grandma and Papa,
Grammy Jo and Poppy Keith.
Oh, and Poppy Ron.
And all our family,
but some couldn't come.
-  All right, go
get your baptism dress on.
(pleasant music)
-  So someone is
adventuring up the stairs.
We're still standing close by, though,
because she falls a lot, still.
(Janae vocalizing)
Come on, up to here.
Good job!
Keep going! Push those legs up.
So Elise picked out a baptism dress.
I absolutely love it.
- Thanks.
-  You look adorable.
- Thanks.
-  How do you feel about everyone
being here to support you
for today's special day?
- Just makes me feel
happy that they're coming
to my baptism, it's a
really special thing.
- So one of the things we believe is that
baptism is an opportunity
to show the world
our faith and belief in Jesus Christ,
to follow his example, and
to make a promise with God,
a promise to try to follow the path
and the teachings of Jesus Christ.
- And I'm glad that I'm doing it.
-  Really proud of you.
("When I Am Baptized")
- I love her dress.
- She glissandos so well.
-  Oh, good job, Laura.
(piano playing)
-  It sounds so good!
- (laughs)
It's called improvisation.
- Laura's really good at the piano.
-  Are you excited?
It's your big moment.
♪ I like to look for rainbows ♪
♪ Whenever there is rain ♪
- Well it's really special to have so much
of our family with us here
today for Elise's baptism,
and it just reminds me of my baptism
when I was a little girl.
I was baptized when I was eight years old,
and through my life, it's
just been a great reminder
of choosing to try to follow
Jesus Christ's example.
So we're here at First
Watch celebrating Elise.
Whatchya gonna order?
- I'm gonna have french
toast and hot chocolate.
- They had something called the Bacado,
and it's like bacon, avocado,
scrambled, it sounds good.
- You can't go wrong with
the word bacon and avocado.
And I can't decide.
I'm hungry, and I want to
eat everything on the menu.
-  Thank you.
Hot chocolate.
-  Jeremy ordered
a Morning Meditation.
- It's good, it's orange,
lemon, ginger, and guava.
-  Does it feel very--
- Ahh!
(Jeremy laughs)
- What do you think of that?
- Awesome.
-  It's a fun time
when you're at a red light,
and your mom, my wife, is sitting
over there.
-  There she is.
- It was actually funny,
we were just like,
staring at her creepily,
and she didn't notice
for like 30 seconds, it was...
It was a good time when
she realized we were here.
Next on the agenda is Isaac's
first basketball game.
He's super excited.
So the hardest thing for
Isaac about being in San Diego
is that we were missing all of his games
and practices with basketball.
He's so excited to be back into it.
(energetic music)
We made it!
- So I put Janae in
shoes for the first time!
-  Uh oh.
- And she's been mesmerized by them.
(energetic music)
-  Woo!
- I'm dressed in all
green to cheer for Isaac.
-  You're the best
little cheerleader ever.
- Oh yeah.
- Go!
-  Except for maybe
this little nugget of joy.
Go Isaac!
Those are so funny, what are those?
-  Go Isaac!
-  There she is!
We need to get her some
of those squeaky shoes.
- Oh, that would be good.
Woo! Good job.
(beat music)
- My favorite part was the
part that most surprised me.
The first part where they had us run out.
-  That was awesome,
I did not expect that at all.
- It shocked.
-  Yeah! Well, you
played really well, good job.
-  They're doing
the luge with Papa Keith.
(Caleb yells)
(Papa Keith grunts)
So we've been having so much
fun watching the Olympics,
and we're having some family over tonight
for some pizza, and the
figure skating is on,
and we're gonna watch it.
Let us know in the poll,
have you been watching
the Olympics, and do you like it?
-  The only one
that plays the black keys.
That's it!
(piano playing)
- So Caleb's bike has
been having a problem,
and since Papa's in town,
we're having him look at it.
So what was wrong with it?
- Um, there was two of these, these...
-  Oh.
- On this side, and there's
supposed to be one on both.
- Interesting.
So back in the day,
when Papa was a teenager
and a young adult, he
worked in a bicycle shop.
And so he's always our
resident bicycle repairman.
-  Did you ever do stuff like this
when you were working as a bike man?
-  Yeah, pretty much.
Folks would have problems.
- Cool.
-  I want to be a
scientist when I grow up.
-  That's a cool
thing to be, a scientist.
Caleb, what do you want to be?
- Maybe like a builder, NFL player.
-  Great jobs.
- For dinner tonight, we're doing pizza.
We did bacon and pineapple.
Like actual bacon, not ham.
What do you think?
- It's very good.
-  You did the chicken one?
(upbeat music)
So for a long time, our kids
only wanted cheese pizza,
and I'm so happy that they're
graduating out of that,
where they want to try the other pizzas
with other fun toppings on there.
So we might not get a
cheese pizza next time.
(laughing)
(rock music)
So you've been watching the Olympics.
- Yep! We're gonna be ice skating.
-  You ready to get out there?
Go do it.
They're doing figure skating.
Very nice.
(laughing)
Is that your figure skating?
Oh, are these the moves? (laughs)
All right, so first up for the
United States, Elise and Luke.
(chuckles)
Nice!
(laughs)
Oh!
(Elise laughs)
That will be a deduction
of a half a point.
The heart ending!
From Korea, Isaac and Allison.
With their, oh, whoa!
(laughing)
There it is.
Very good.
Oh, onto the knees, whoa!
Is that the end? Woo!
- We are playing the game
Timeline in partners.
This'll be fun.
- This is like the nerdiest game.
You have to try to put, in order,
when things were invented.
And put it correctly in the timeline.
-  All right, Jeremy,
which one do you want to do?
The invention of the combustion engine,
the invention of the Zeppelin.
This game is oddly intense.
Oh, I'm getting nervous!
-  They got it.
- They got it.
We are on our last card.
-  We're about to win the game.
- Hopefully, don't jinx it!
-  Will they win it?
- But you need electricity to pull it.
- All right, 1837.
(cheers)
-  You won! Woo!
-  They won it! The winners!
Looks like the kids made
a short track down here,
and they're working on
their speed skating.
Isaac's coming around on the inside,
trying to make a pass on Caleb.
Can he do it? He comes in!
So we're ending the night
watching more of the Olympics,
and we hope you have a wonderful night.
J House out.
(Janae vocalizes)
-  You guys
wanna make giant kisses?
- Yeah.
-  All right, Caleb has his
treasure hunt ready for us.
