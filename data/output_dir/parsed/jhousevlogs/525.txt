especially lately we've been shopping a
lot more online it's just so convenient
so that's the poll question for today up
here do you guys prefer to shop online
or in stores in real life let us know
and I wonder what it is I don't even
remember like I know we've ordered a
couple things recently but I don't know
what's in this exact box all right you
guys want to see what's inside
Isaac's next piano book this is a
surprise that we bought for the kids for
our trip that we're going on soon we're
going to be flying in an airplane in
like a couple weeks and I thought that
this would be a great thing for the
plane
done her hand son and hi so what is this

wants to it's so so you guys have your
own vlog yeah so what are you going to
call it hi see bros i see bros like it

edit them me there's not a way to edit
them so this is a scan how I make it
scared yes so you guys are gonna do
scary vlogs I don't want well I'm
excited to see what you guys create so
we just recently started the kids on a
new math curriculum printer for the
summer time is called reflex math and
it's supposed to really help them get
the math backed down like they
understand addition and subtraction then
Isaac does multiplication and division
as well but this helps them like learn
the facts so they just like quickly like
reflex good job of these oh that was
scary
well they don't
oh good morning Laura did you have a
good nap hmm well can you go put your
pinkies in your bed who got you dress so
cute oh so beautiful
hey Massey is it messy over here
alright dinner tonight is spinach pesto
mushroom lasagna I'm gonna go ahead and
put that together right now you want to
walk me lacy yep
where you going today I'm going to a
first um what is the common what we call
master class which is a really a recital
practice but so we're running late as
usual leaving the house and for some
reason it is so hard for kids to find
shoes one of our kids as we're getting
ready to leave like could not find any
shoes I'm like crap shoes they're like I
can't find any socks I'm like fine
flip-flops or like it's raining out I'm
like find any two items to put on your
feet I don't care if they match I don't
care about it all like we just have to
go how did you like your first day
working in your home office it's a
wonderful space yeah the funniest most
random thing I didn't expect about it is
that if I pass gas in my office I can't
escape it it's such a small space I
didn't anticipate that so the only
concern about the space size is the
airflow problem airflow we need to get a
ventilation system where at spray spray
it really shouldn't make me so happy but
to gas up for 62 cents with my little IV
gas card makes me happy
we're continuing our search for the
dressers for the kids no do you see it
Sparkle
we're not gonna sleep in here
for Laura got the boring ride come on my
knee and rank we were just going into
Walmart playing you likey
we're not actually shopping for a dress
we're shopping for Kings for daddy's
office so the kids weren't cooperating
Kendra had to take them out of the store
to the car shopping with a two-year-old
and a four-year-old is not a super easy
thing
there's the spinach pesto mushroom
lasagna how's your food good Laura what
do you think what are you eating it so
Laura was just getting ready to go to
bed and she just threw up all over the
ground I won't get too close because
it's it's gross do you feel that well
you sick so cleaning up throw up and pee
and poo and carpet is one of those
things that you just do a lot when you
have four little kids so whenever one of
your kids get sick it raises all kinds
of questions and issues is it contagious
is does this mean all of our kids are
going to get sick was a food poisoning
what did she eat that the other kids did
or didn't eat is it just a fluke like
they're sleeping around it's been sick
yeah so there's so many she seems to be
acting so normal now oh yeah my mom
she's going bed but where were you going
hey if her being sick means she puts
herself to bed every night well I'm not
cleaning up the carpet not pleasant
but nice behind below I'll see you in
the mornin well we just started throw up
around 2 for Miss Laura J house out
hey John Kaelyn well Jeremy got his
office all set up I'm excited to show it
to you guys let's go
