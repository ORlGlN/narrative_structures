-  Take a step.
(Children cheering)
Separate them out.
- This pillow is perfect for me.
- Look, they have cookies!
- Well, I'm headed to
workout group this morning,
and I don't want to go at all.
My body does not want to move.
It does not want to exercise, but I know
on the other side of it,
I'm going to feel better.
So, off to workout group.
- Ja doesn't like taking naps anymore.
She'd rather just hang
out, but she's so tired.
(Kissing sound)
(Soothing guitar music)
She's all smiley.
Look at her; she's so happy.
(Kissing sound)
You want to sing her to sleep?
- Said the night wind to the little lamb,
do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancing in the night
with a tail as big as a kite.
With a tail as big as a kite.
- Every year, we deal with this.
When do you start listening
to Christmas music?
I'm fine with it as soon as possible.
Kendra, she likes to wait
until after Thanksgiving.
So let us know on the poll.
When to start Christmas music.
-  You were supposed
to be going to sleep.
- High above the trees, with
a voice as big as the sea.
A child, a child, shivers in the cold.
Let us bring us bring him silver and gold.
- I accidentally put on makeup.
-  Accidentally?
- Yeah.
-  How did that
happen accidentally?
- Because I wanted some more makeup on.
-  That doesn't sound like
- For a day.
-  Doesn't sound like an accident.
It sounds like you did it on purpose.
No?
Just an accident?
What is an accident?
- It means that
you have to wash off makeup.
That's what makeup has to get off.
-  If you want to
use makeup in the future,
you need to ask us, OK?
- Mmmhmm.
(Rock music)
(Children cheering)
-  Separate them out.
Work together.
- First candies go right here.
-  Airheads and gum and Twizzlers
all go together.
- I have a ton of Tootsie Rolls.
-  One of my
questions for you guys
is if there's more chocolate-based candy
or more fruit-based candy?
-  We might have
to chart it, graph it.
- I love how Kendra can
take a normal activity
and turn it into an
amazing school opportunity.
- Another question I
have is, if each member
of our family got the
exact same number of candy,
how many candies would we each get?
- A hundred!
-  You'll have to calculate it.
- Yellow, yellow, yellow,
yellow, yellow, yellow,
brown, brown, brown, brown, brown.
(Ominous music)
-  All done.
-  Alright, did you guys sort it?
-  Yep.
-  Okay, now we
need to inventory it.
- What's that?
-  Inventory is when
you write down what you have.
-  6, 8, 10.
-  So you want to do
Tootsie Roll and then short.
Tootsie Roll, mini.
Tootsie Roll, fat.
Does that make sense?
So that when we alphabetize
it, they'll all be together.
- I did 5+5 and I was right.
-  So you did some math?
- Three and two, three and two.
-  Hey guys,
how many pieces of candy
do you think we have?
- 200.
-  200?
What do you think, Elise?
-  I think 500.
- And I'll take the middle with 300.
-  300, what do you think, Mom?
- 426.
- I think that there is 501.
I'm going to take the highest number.
I think it's above 500.
- Okay, let's add it up.
So you guys had over 60 kinds of candy.
62 different kinds, and I
can do auto-sum right here
and the number's going to spit out here.
You ready to see it?
-  Uh-huh.
- Okay, and the total
is 645 pieces of candy.
- That's a lot.
- You guys did good trick-or-treating.
Some of those were packs
full of other candy, too.
So now that we have the data, Excel lets
us move stuff around.
Like we can organize it alphabetically.
We could put it in order
from biggest to smallest.
We could create types,
like chocolate or fruity.
Hard candy or soft or chewy, and then
we can categorize it and see how many
there are of all the
different types of candy.
-  And we could make graphs.
- Or, we could just eat lunch.
-  Haha.
- You guys hungry?
-  Let's eat lunch first.
Are you such a big girl?
Look at you just standing up.
This is her new favorite
place, because it's
the perfect spot for her to stand up.
Hi.
One handed, you're a big girl!
-  Go on and get it.
Look at those little steps.
Take a step.
There we go!
She's so happy.
So, Isaac is sharing with
us his earliest memory.
And what is your earliest memory?
- It's, well it used to
be a nightmare for me,
and I still remember a lot of it.
Bob the Builder, turkeys and
kangaroos were chasing me.
-  I hate when I have that dream.
- So I remember, he was
about three years old,
and I remember him coming
running into our room
in the middle of the night, crying,
"Mom! Turkeys! Mom! Turkeys!"
What?
-  And Bob the Builder.
- So I'd love to hear in the comments
what your earliest memory is.
Let us know in the comments.
- I remember yours.
-  You remember
my earliest memory?
-  How do you know that?
- You were like kind of, you've told us.
Like, you're in the
swimming pool kind of like
a bathtub and you told
your grandma that you
looked like him, because of the raisins.
-  Basically, we're doing all
of our school with candy today.
I figure, once a year, it's just more fun.
Your handwriting is awesome!
We work hard, my kindergartner dude!
Can I have a high five?
Are you going to eat a Twix to celebrate?
Ealey's just finished alphabetizing.
Isaac's list and his rankings.
So number one, Swedish Fish.
Is that what you're eating?
Trying to eat those buckles?
Haha, she's standing up!
-  She's like a tiger.
-  She's like a tiger?
Isaac is working on a
creative writing assignment.
You've gotta see what he's writing about.
The Perspective of A
Candy on Halloween Night.
So what kind of a candy
are you writing about?
- A Starburst; his name is Cherry.
Doesn't even know why.
They just put it on his wrapper.
-  Yeah.
Are they excited to get
eaten, or nervous about it?
- Well he's excited because his parents
and ancestors are in the belly of someone.
-  Uh oh.
- So he can go and join them.
-  Uh oh.
- And not be lonely.
-  He must not know about poop.
(Fart noise)
- Ah!
- Ah!
-  Haha.
- I think the kids might
be enjoying the popper toys
a little more than the candy
they got for Halloween.
-  What are you doing?
- Ah!
- So, in the past, our
family has taken our
Halloween candy and, a day or two
after Halloween we donate
it to Operation Gratitude.
At least I think that's it's name.
It sends the candy over to US soldiers
that are stationed in
different parts of the world
to make them smile and
help them feel happy.
I wanted to talk to the
kids about it today,
because they are getting
older and I want to see
what they are feeling up to.
-  So, Isaac, how are you feeling
about the idea of donating your candy.
- I like that we get to
give it to other people.
Like, I want to give some,
but I do like having candy,
so I want some for our family.
- This much to donate
and that much to keep.
- If we ate too much
candy, we would get sick.
-  That is an issue.
-  They're just
going to take all of it.
- If a whole new family got this candy,
we would have to go trick-or-treating
and Halloween again.
-  Yeah, tonight we'll have to
go trick-or-treating.-
- So we'll have to do it again
if we give away this candy.
Hey baby girl!
So it's interesting to get the kid's
input and ideas about this, this year.
Like, I don't want to force
them to donate their candy,
I'm just bringing it up.
What do they think we should do
with this amount of candy?
I think what we've
decided is that each kid
is going to get a bag to
put their own candy in.
The things they want to keep,
and then we are going to donate the rest.
How does that sound?
- Good!
- Good!
- All in favor?
-  We just haven't told
them how big the bag is yet?
- Hahaha.
-  It could be a tiny little bag.
- Gotcha.
- More of the Reeses Peanut Butter Cups.
-  9, 10, 11, 12.
-  That's the donating pile.
Put it in the bag.
- So there's a dental practice in our area
that accepts the candy and
ships it off to the soldiers.
-  Let's go!
-  We're donating our candy!
-  Wow!
-  We decided
it would be smartest to
divide the candy into four different bags
for each of them to hold.
- Over eight and half pounds of candy.
-  That's a lot of candy.
-  Good job.
Thanks, man.
- It's Christmas in here.
-  It happened.
-  It's Christmas!
-  Didn't you hear?
Halloween happened;
now it's Christmastime.
("Jingle Bells")
- We always skip my favorite
holiday, Thanksgiving.
-  Yeah, I talked about it today.
- Did you talk about that already?
-  Caleb was
singing a Christmas song.
- You're like, "You better
not do that around Mom."
This pillow is perfect for me.
-  Kendra's pillow.
-  Look at these sugar cookies.
- Pumpkin!
-  Look at these
peanut butter cookies.
Oh my.
- Caleb, look, pumpkin cookies!
-  There's turkeys.
-  Hey, that's Thanksgiving.
-  I know, way to celebrate!
- I'm heavy.
- You are heavy.
-  Dancing?
- Dancing?
-  Look at that.
-  Laura's
dancing, Elise is dancing.
- You know, we're just that normal family
with five little kids at
the restaurant, dancing.
- She's dancing.
(Baby screaming)
(Jeremy laughs)
-  Good night.
J House out.
-  Do you remember
when you auditioned?
(Upbeat music)
- Look!
- It's for test flying.
-  It's for test flying, Caleb.
