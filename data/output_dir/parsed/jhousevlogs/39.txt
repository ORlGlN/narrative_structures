-  It's gonna be a little loud.
Whoa.
(upbeat music)
- Oh, wow.
-  Yeah, show
us your best fish face.
(upbeat music)
- It looks like a castle,
and you can go in it!
(upbeat music)
- So this morning we
are going to brunch at
The Marine Room, which this
place, when Jeremy and I
were researching like, fun
and unique things to do
in San Diego, we heard about it.
And it's a restaurant that's
out like, on the water.
Like, the waves crash against
it while you're eating.
And we found out that
just a couple times a year
they do a high tide
breakfast, and it is happening
while we're here.
So we made reservations,
and we've been really
looking forward to it.
Unfortunately, Jeremy
doesn't get to join us
'cause we don't have the baby
sitter situation figured out.
Instead, I've got Isaac, and Elyse.
You guys ready for this?
-  Yep!
(classical music)
-  We are right on the water.
This is cool.
(classical music)
So you guys look at what
you wanna have in it, okay?
(classical music)
- I never had a omelet before.
I'm really excited.
(classical music)
-  French toast.
(classical music)
It's kind of a big plate, huh?
You're doing a great job.
You always use the outside fork first.
(upbeat music)
Was that one pretty good?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- So we decided to all try
something new from the buffet,
and this is definitely new.
This is an Eggs Benedict, this
is a Goat Cheese Frittata,
and this is called a Stone Fruit Blintz.
Isaac went with the Smoked Salmon.
- And that salad.
- Yeah.
- Potato salad.
And, then...
I don't know what that is.
And this is egg plant.
-  Egg Plant Escabeche.
- Mm.
- Pretty good?
(upbeat music)
I'm full.
It's always so sad to be
full at a buffet because
there's still so much good food out there.
- So the ocean looks like
there's nothing in it,
but there's actually a whole world in it.
-  Isn't that amazing?
- Uh-huh.
- Cheers!
Cheers.
- Can we get dessert for this round?
- Yes we can.
So there's brunch, and
there's dessert, and I was
telling Isaac, I don't
know if I can eat dessert
this early in the day.
And he was so smart.
He said, well Mom, we ate
three rounds at the buffet,
so pretty much that's
like three meals, so now
it's time for dessert.
Isaac chose a Passion Fruit Bar.
Elyse chose Dulce De
Leche, and Mystery Dish.
We don't know what's in it.
So we each picked two desserts
so we can taste them all.
- This is so good.
It's almost like vanilla ice cream.
-  So it's called Panna Cotta.
(classical music)
Well the High Tide
breakfast was really fun.
Unfortunately, the waves
weren't very strong today,
and several people were
commenting on that.
They're like, the waves are just low, so.
We've seen online and heard
that like, the waves crashed
against the window.
We didn't see too much of that,
but the food was wonderful,
and I was really impressed with
how Isaac and Elyse behaved.
It was exciting for me
to be able to share that
with the kids.
Now we are home.
We're stuffed, and we're ready to begin
our day's adventures.
(dramatic music)
So, we can't find the house key.
I know I had it.
-  Not here.
Okay you guys, we're looking for the key.
Anyone know where it might be?
-  No.
-  I think they're ready.
- I found it.
-  Where was it?
- In the dark crevices of the diaper bag.
We got it, dude. We found it.
Ready to go?
- Let's do it.
(upbeat bluegrass music)
- I brought my potato rock and it's safe.
-  Such a good
job. You keep that safe.
(upbeat bluegrass music)
Today's destination is
the Air and Space Museum.
 Whoa.
- By Ryan Aeronautical.
It was a...
-  See this actor?
-  Hi!
- Boom. New York City.
How 'bout FRA?
-  France.
- France, oh, it's Frankfurt!
- Frankfurt.
- You think that one's Seattle?
Toronto.
- Toronto.
- SJD.
San Jose, Del Cabo, Mexico.
The story of flight begins
with Leonardo Da Vinci.
Adventures of the airplane.
Orville and Wibur Wright.
(upbeat music)
- What's a glider?
-  That's where
it doesn't have an engine,
and it just glides in the air.
(upbeat music)
- Look, this is what flight
attendants use to look like.
Pacific Southwest Reservations.
(upbeat music)
- So they have a movie
theater here with seats
that move and vibrate.
You nervous?
- Mm-hmm.
It's gonna be a little loud.
- Whoa!
(laughs)
That was like a roller coaster.
-  Elyse isn't quite tall enough
to reach the pedals.
- I figured out how to make it start.
-  So there's foot pedals.
(upbeat music)
- It's harder than it looks.
I'm not a very good pilot.
- You're just in training.
- Oh look, I got an airplane.
(upbeat music)
- Put it back up there.
Look at that Nae-nae
(upbeat music)
- Hi Nae-nae. Hi big girl!
Ooh!
Amelia Earhart.
So Elyse just finished reading
a book about Amelia Earhart,
so she was excited to
see a plane replica here.
(bright music)
- So they have some
documentaries going here about
World War Two, and about
space flight, and I could
watch those forever.
Like, I am the biggest nerd.
I love learning and I love
watching about the stories
of things that happened.
Let me know in the poll if
you also like documentaries.
- So apparently, flaghoist
signally is a thing.
I had no idea.
So there's a whole international
code where they use
different flags to send
different messages.
And so the kids are
looking at the messages
that are out here, and
trying to decode 'em.
- Messages are sent by varying
the relative position of
the flags on a flag hoist.
- I think that one's it.
I think it's...
-  Jenae was gonna be done, so.
Kendra made a roller coaster for her.
- I'm getting dizzy though.
(babbles)
(giggles)
(squeals)
(squeals)
- Oh.
- A flight simulator.
(bright music)
- So while we were in the
museum, we met a World War Two
vet who was a medic at
the Battle of Normandy.
And it was just an honor
to hear his stories
and to thank him for his service.
There's just not a lot of
World War Two vets left.
And I think that there's a lot of lessons
that need to be learned from then.
- So we're taking a break
from our adventures,
and we're eating some waffles.
I heard that there was a
really cool like, Belgian
street waffle place really
close to Balboa Park,
so we're gonna eat there.
- So we couldn't find this
place when we first drove by.
It looks like a total hole
in the wall, but I think
it's nicer than it
appears from the drive by.
(upbeat music)
How did we miss it?
(upbeat music)
It's good.
Lemonade with pineapple and strawberry.
- How did you guys like, make all that?
- Everything was made by hand.
So we made all the tables.
(upbeat music)
- Oh wow.
- Is it good?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Hi.
She's waving.
(upbeat music)
- So this place has definitely
been a happy surprise.
It's so unique.
See their chairs?
So, how's seat number four?
- Good.
-  Just for four year olds, right?
(upbeat music)
(upbeat country music)
Who wants to go in here?
-  Yeah.
(upbeat country music)
- So we found a Japanese
friendship garden here
in Balboa Park that we're checking out.
(gentle oriental music)
- That fish was going mwah.
-  Was it kissing?
- Yeah.
(kissing noises)
-  Show us your best fish face.
- There it is.
- Let's see Isaac's.
- I just lost it.
-  Don't smile.
(laughs)
- Okay, my turn.
(laughs)
(bright music)
- They have bonsai trees here.
These trees are very old and very special.
Be very careful with them.
Whenever I see bonsai trees,
I always think of Karate Kid.
- Hey, look at that.
It's gonna make it, huh?
- Ay. Make it because have strong root.
- These are like miniature trees.
- These would be good
climbing trees if they were
just a lot bigger.
-  This one is my favorite.
It's just beautiful.
-  I think this one's my favorite.
It reminds me of an overgrown broccoli.
And the Karate Kid.
- Bonsai Danielson.
- Eh, bonsai!
- Bonsai!
- Bonsai!
♪ That one is my favorite
of all my heart. ♪
- This one's my favorite.
-  Why do you like it so much?
- Because it's big.
(upbeat country music)
- It must be very old, but
they had to cut it down.
It is an interesting thing
that they cut it down.
-  Yeah, there
must have been a reason.
It's really pretty.
(upbeat country music)
- I typically would never
stop and read plaques.
Kendra almost always does.
And while it takes longer,
we learn a lot more stuff.
- So this is a stone
lantern that used to be
used in Hindu temples.
(upbeat music)
- Well we made it outta the
garden and then realized
that Jenae was missing
one of her transparent
flip flop slipper things.
Sandals, I think is what they're called.
So I'm gonna try to find it.
(gentle music)
Well I guess Jenae is gonna
grow out of those sandals
before we find them.
Bummer.
(gentle music)
- This place is beautiful at night.
(gentle upbeat music)
- That reminds me of the Arc De Triomphe.
- In France?
- Yeah.
-  It's definitely an arch.
The one in France is much bigger.
(gentle upbeat music)
- It looks like a castle,
and you can go in it.
-  Let's go see what it is.
(gentle upbeat music)
-  Good night.
J House out.
-  It moved on me!
It moved!
(laughs)
It moved!
- Is the tide coming in?
- Yeah!
(dramatic music)
