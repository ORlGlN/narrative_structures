- Bye!
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.
- Alright, we find where the balloons are.
-  You guys snuggling up?
- Yeah.
A hot air balloon!
-  They starting to blow up?
- Yeah really.
Look it's a show.
- They're glowing!
(giggles with excitement)
-  Look at them
guys, look at 'em glowing.
(cheers)
- Yeah, and the subway is
coming up to the first leader.
- We have some announcers here
at the hot air balloon festival.
-  (Chuckles)
- Look at that,
United States on go, it's
going up really fast.
And the lighthouse, it's
glowing and it's way up.
-  Oh look guys,
look up at the top!
Look at that! Look at it!
(excited chatter)
-  You guys
remember how hot air rises?
-  Um, yeah.
- We stayed up the whole night?
-  Almost.
- Not the whole night,
but a lot of it.
That's the sun rising over there.
(relaxing horns music)
- Alright, now as the sun is coming up,
more balloons are going
up, and there's some
right in front of us
getting ready to set up.
- There's horses!
-  There are horses.
So the police are here riding
around on beautiful horses.
(happy acoustic music)
-  So they're taking off in waves.
So the initial wave went
off when it was still dark,
and now there's a whole line going.
(happy acoustic music)
(happy light rock music)
-  Caleb, what's your
favorite shape you've seen?
- Darth Vader.
-  Oh, Darth
Vader, what was yours?
- Mine is the water drop.
-  Ooh, over there?
-  Uh huh.
-  There's the water droplet.
- Mine is the frog without a head.
-  (laughs)
You're right, it doesn't have a head.
-  Yeah, maybe it'll come up.
-  Hey Laura,
what's your favorite shape?
- Uhhh...
... uhh ...
... the ...
(upbeat chill music)
-  Hey, look at that bug!
-  This really pretty one up here.
- It does have a head.
-  You're right,
it was just backwards.
(upbeat chill music)
-  So cool that
we get to be right here
where they're setting them up.
Do you see it?
It's so cool.
-  Yeah.
(happy acoustic music)
-  Is it loud?
You can see the balloon
hovering off the ground
as it gets ready to go.
- Ready to go.
(adventurous music)
(applause)
- I could just look
into the sky for hours.
-  Well, you're in good company.
- There are so many
people here, it's awesome.
- Look at that adorable butterfly!
Hey Laura, what do you see?
- A butterfly!
-  A butterfly.
(relaxing classical music)
- Well, this is magnificent,
I have seriously never seen
this many hot air balloons in my life.
(relaxing classical music)
(soft fast-paced piano music)
- So on both sides of the freeway,
you can see hot air balloons landing.
What a blessing it didn't
land in the freeway.
-  You're welcome.
-  Who's ready for a nap?
-  Me!
- Alright, well, we have a
seven-and-a-half hour drive
to Oklahoma City, so
we'll see you guys there!
(music box)
-  Good night, J House out.
