for this morning we're heading out for
our first field trip of the school year
which we're really excited about we've
tried to leave now three times we backed
out the driveway and remember Jeremy
sunglasses then we backed back out and
remembered my cell phone
so hopefully the third time's a charm
and we actually leave
we are out here at Powell gardens and
we're here with my brother Travis who
just moved here to Kansas City his wife
Ashley and their little kiddos
so what's fun about this place is it's
actually our first field trip from our
first home school year and it's one of
our first vlogs and so it's kind of fun
to be coming back here again and
thinking about how little they were left
in and just in case you didn't know when
we are referencing videos from the past
the little I card comes up you can click
on those and it'll show you that video
from before so that's the I card right
right there that's right
right here I'm a little scared what are
you scared of I'm scared

you should go pretty well with two of
them side by side it looks like Owls

right now close so it looks like a
difference no way that's the same kind
as the blue ones it looks like that
okay mothers being so brave
so here's the butterflies that just came
out of their chrysalis and their wings
are still drying their wings have to dry
off before they can fly all right get
this one yeah that's it
Wow look it looks like it has I see the
good vibes so what do you think of the
butterflies bug aren't they beautiful

something Kendra is wanting us to pay
attention to nature as we were out
walking around and I guess it's still
