(techno music)
- So today, for ballet, it's
bring a friend to ballet.
I guess you already know
who I'm gonna bring.
Zeda.
- Hi.
- I'm really excited
to have a friend there
because normally I don't
really have a friend.
(ballet music)
Hi, hi.
-  Are you a fairy?
- Princess.
-  Let's see that hair.
- Three buns.
- Three buns.
- One, two, three.
-  I love it.
(rock music)
So how are you feeling this morning?
- Much better.
-  Good, you look great.
- Much, much better, thank you.
(giggles)
Human bridge.
-  This might not end well.
-  If 100 monkeys
go across one big-
- That was awesome.
-  Okay, Dad's turn
to be the human bridge.
Let's do this.
-  One at a time.
That was Laura, that's the easy part.
You don't have to step on his head.
- That's a good workout.
-  Is that a good workout?
You're basically planking.
- It's like intense core
yoga, focused workout.
- Maybe I should be a bridge.
I think Jenae wants a turn on a bridge.
(laughter)
(upbeat music)
- Hi.
- This is such an intense stomach workout.
-  Well if you let
go, your children fall.
Jenae's trying to come.
- Come on Jenae, come play with us.
-  Jenae wants to join the crazy.
-  I want in on this.
-  Jeremy, is this like
a full body workout machine?
- Yeah I'm doing crunches
down here with my legs.
(giggles)
I'm doing stomach-
-  Alright, all done.
Mom declares give Dad peace.
So I'm starting my morning
off with some herbal tea
and reading the scriptures.
I've been just needing to
get back into that pattern
of doing that first thing first so I can
kind of fuel myself up for the day.
This herbal tea, I wanted
to tell you guys about it,
'cause this is my favorite herbal tea
I've ever tried before,
cinnamon apple spice.
So good.
- I'm the playground mom.
-  You're playground mom?
Of course, you wear a cape.
- We actually have a baby named Sarah.
-  That's a great name.
Alright, shall we go see your playground.
You coming to Leese?
-  You should come to
Caleb and Laura's playground.
-  Sounds pretty official.
It's a cool idea to have a
playground in your basement.
They kept a house in the blue
misty mountains, up high.
Here and there and wherever,
the prettiest quilts
anyone had ever seen.
The whites from the northern most snows.
Some said there was magic in her fingers.
Very hot, so you're just gonna hold
onto the handle with Mommy.
This is the quilt we're
gonna help make today.
- What happens if you press on this?
- That one does some steam.
- I can't believe I'm doing it.
Normally I can't.
-  So if you
go too fast, it doesn't
get the wrinkles out.
If you go too slow, it burns it.
So you have to go at just the right speed.
Sometimes you have to kind
of press a little bit.
Do you feel how we're pressing into it?
So to sew this blanket, the
first step we need to do
is even it up and pin it
together so we can sew it.
So we're gonna even it up by cutting it
and little disclaimer here,
I'm not a quilting expert
and I haven't quilted
in like a decade.
No claims to doing this correctly.
Why do you guys think this
is called a rotary cutter?
- Because it is like on a
wheel, it's like a wheel.
- It rotates.
This is a rotary mat.
(upbeat music)
Alright well we got
the blanket all cut out
and pinned before Jenae woke up.
So I was able to put all
the sharp things away
and the iron away so it can be
safe for her while she's awake.
Then when she's sleeping next,
we'll probably try to sew.
- Chicken salad sandwich.
-  Dishing out
leftovers for lunch.
- Soup.
- Let's start with Laura.
- Soup.
- Laura wants some soup.
- By about the middle of the week,
leftovers start loading up in the fridge.
So we have a few leftover lunches.
We take turns with different kids
getting to pick what they want first.
Everybody usually ends up happy
'cause all the food's good.
- Caleb, what would you like?
Okay, you're gonna eat it
with this and the veggies.
Elise, what do you want?
Alright, Isaac.
- Lasagna.
- Lasagna.
- Alright, Jenae's down for her next nap
so I'm going to attempt
to sew with my children.
Do I have enough patience
to sew with my kids?
That might be the ultimate test.
You can use just the hand piece
so that you can get it in
there where you want it.
Guys, see I'm following the edge of the
presser foot with my fabric.
- Poll question, have you ever
used a sewing machine before?
Let us know in the poll.
- Look at that thing, it's just like-
This is how they make tiny stitches.
-  Caleb's pushing the button.
So Elise is pushing the pedal
and doing the feeding with the hands.
- Oh my goodness, I just sewed.
- You did, can you put the
presser foot back down.
Okay, good job, now you keep going.
- That was awesome, now I
can just sew whenever I want.
I can sew a pillow sheet,
I can sew whatever I want.
- He's doing the foot pedal right now.
Alright,
we sewed all the way around
so now we're going to turn it inside out.
You guys ready for this?
- For somebody else right Mom?
-  Yep, we're gonna give it away.
Alright, well here's the finished product.
We made a blanket.
It's the easiest kind of blanket to make
but I wanted to teach the kids.
(rock music)
- I want somebody to play with me.
-  Can I play with you?
- Yeah.
Whoa.
(giggles)
- Whoa, maybe we could
shoot Isaac from here.
Watch this.
(rock music)
- It's so hard having a little sister.
She wants to do everything you do.
It's just so exhausting.
-  You're trying so
hard to play nicely with her,
but she has a hard time
taking turns and playing.
Hey Laura, how is it
being a three year old?
- Good.
-  Good?
Who do you like to be just like?
- I want to be just like Leesy.
-  You wanna be
just like your big sister.
Okay.
So they settled on me joining the play
and I'll carry my baby with me.
She's just trying to
keep up with her eyes.
She's like, where are they
going, what's going on?
Gotta keep up with the big sisters.
- The kids have some friends over tonight
so we ordered pizza.
And we're trying this new
Philly Cheese steak Pizza
from Papa Johns.
Looks good, not sponsored.
Kendra just loves Philly Cheese steak.
- I love anything Philly Cheese steak.
The sandwiches, the pizzas, the calzones.
If it's Philly Cheese
steak, I usually love it.
So I had to try it.
(upbeat music)
-  Have fun Isaac.
So we heard in the comments that you guys
want us to do more challenges.
We like doing challenges, they're fun
and so we're coming to the store
to pick up a couple
surprise for challenges
we're gonna be doing coming up soon.
(upbeat music)
- The guy broke the head.
-  They didn't break
the heads, those are manikins.
- Oh but some of them broke their heads.
-  Yeah, they're
missing their heads.
- Those aren't real people Laura.
They're just trying to show you clothes
that you can find for boys clothes.
- Thought number one, it
is pitch black outside
and Jeremy is mowing the lawn.
It is cracking me up just
walking around the house
hearing the lawn mower outside.
It's pitch black, how does he
even know where he's going?
We have a really busy next few days
and he really wanted the lawn mowed.
So he started when it was
like the sun was setting.
I was like Babe?
He's like I gotta get it done.
We have all the lights in the house on
and all the blinds open so hopefully
that's helping him see somehow.
Do you hear that?
There he his.
Out there mowing.
(laughter)
You can't even see but he's waving.
He's waving.
I'm proud of him, that's
determination right there.
Alright, well our busy day had
a bit of an unfortunate ending.
We had to run a few last errands
and a couple of our kids really struggled
and really misbehaved while
we were out running errands.
So we had to cut it short, come home.
They both got chores
and put straight to bed.
You know, it's just hard.
There were tears, there was frustration.
Parenting and life and kids,
it's just hard you know.
One of the kids was in tears
at the end of the night
just crying.
They were sad that they disobeyed.
I hope that they learn those lessons.
They also cried and said
they were just tired.
That's something that they
need to learn how to deal with,
still behaving when they're tired.
We need to learn how to better know
what kind of situations
we're putting them into.
J House is tired
and now they're sleeping in their beds
and hopefully we'll have
a better day tomorrow.
I love that about life, that
there's always a tomorrow.
And we'll begin again tomorrow.
I'm gonna go put this one too bed.
Goodnight, J House out.
You know those sick days
when holding your head
up off the pillow is like
absolutely exhausting?
(upbeat music)
