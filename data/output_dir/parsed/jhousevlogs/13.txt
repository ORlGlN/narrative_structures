- The treasure hunt is ready!
(joyful instrumental music)
-  Oh!
(air whooshing)
-  You normally make
your bed in the morning.
- Yeah.
- But as soon as he wakes up
every day, he makes his bed.
We'll see if we can
somehow have that rub off
on all the other kids.
(happy guitar music)
(cereal falls into bowl)
(baby coos)
-  Did someone just wake up?
She's just saying good
morning to everybody.
- Da da da.
-  Hi.
♪ It's a hard knock life for us ♪
♪ It's a hard knock life for us ♪
♪ Instead of treated we get tricked ♪
♪ Instead of kisses we get kicked ♪
♪ It's a hard knock life ♪
- Bye Mom, bye Addison, bye
Jennae, bye Elise, bye Caleb.
-  Bye Laura, have fun.
- Mwah.
- This morning Laura is coming with me
to run an important errand.
(fun electronic music)
-  t.Loft.
- Weee.
-  Finally today Kendra
and I are picking up something
we've wanted to pick up for a long time.
You got it?
Thanks for helping.
(fun electronic music)
Isaac, what are you doing?
- I'm making a treasure hunt.
The treasure hunt is ready!
(fast instrumental music)
- The first clue is fun, swish!
(feet hitting floor)
Nope.
- Just a drawing.
-  Uh, let's go.
- Right up there!
My favorite show is on the... TV!
(baby laughing)
- I love apples.
I want one.
Can you find one?
-  Maybe it's on an apple.
Oh, right there!
(clock ticking)
- Nope.
(gasps) Yeah!
- Wait, wait, wait.
You found it.
Everyone gets something.
- Yeah!
Thank you!
You are the best brother ever!
- It's my candy from Chuck E.
Cheese, but I have too much
and it's taking forever.
(joyful music)
-  Wah!
(man laughs)
- Wah!
(kids screaming)
- Mmm.
-  Do you like it?
- I like it.
-  Did you put some makeup on?
Looking good.
We're giving the kids our
leftovers of an Indian restaurant
that we went to.
So this is your first time
you guys to try Indian food,
like from India.
-  I love it.
-  We got the tiki marsala
- I love it.
-  and butter chicken
which is like a coconut
- I'd say it's--
- tomato with Indian herbs and spices.
- I'd say it's a little bit spicy.
-  Is it a little bit spicy?
- Mm-hmm.
- But it's good.
-  Okay.
- I want to go there.
- So let us know in the
poll if you have had
and like Indian food.
- So over the last couple
months Jeremy and I have fallen
into some less healthy patterns.
Just eating more sweets and
treats, more french fries,
eating out more and so
we're really excited
to start, kind of jump
start our health goals
with doing a cleanse this week.
For the next two days,
we're gonna drink these awesome juices
and eat these healthy salads
and I'm really excited
and a little bit nervous.
We want more energy.
We want to take care of our bodies better
and so we're doing this for two days.
Hopefully it goes okay.
So the cleanse comes
with this cleanse guide
and it tells you when to drink what.
So we're starting off with Juice 1
and that's the mean and clean.
So we just find Juice 1.
(shakes juice)
So this is really good,
it tastes like a carrot orange juice,
which is one of my favorites.
- So Kendra and I have done this before,
but it was a long time ago,
like a year or two ago.
- It was before Jennae.
- This is a good one.
- So with the cleanse we're also supposed
to drink a lot of water, hydrating today.
(air whooshes)
-  Are you on the trampoline?
- Yep.
(baby laughs)
(tongue clicking)
-  You thinking about a doggy?
Nae Nae when she thinks
about a dog, oh you signing?
Dog, dog.
She'll make a dog noise.
(imitates dog barking)
That's her bark.
(girl laughs)
Nae Nae is watching her
brothers play basketball.
So I'm on drink four, I get one more drink
and I have a salad coming up.
- Well I'm snuggling Jennae this morning
and she is doing so much more signing
with her baby sign language.
It's so cute to see it.
Let's see if she'll show
it off for you guys.
All right, Nae Nae, can you sign hat?
Hat, good job!
Can you say please?
Please, aww, that's so sweet.
So, so far Jennae signs hat, dad,
although I think sometimes she
gets those like interchanged,
cuz they both are on the top of her head.
She signs please, eat, more, shoes.
It's just really fun to
see her start signing.
I've loved this stage with all of my kids
because all of a sudden you get
to see what they're thinking about.
- Try to stop him.
(smacks)
(laughs)
- No, Caleb, get it!
Get open.
(smacks)
(laughs)
(gentle guitar music)
-  These boys are
playing basketball all the time.
(chimes ring)
Ohh, good shot.
- I'm gonna quiz Caleb
on some of his Spanish.
La manzana.
- Apple.
- Apple, are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, pig.
- La cerdo.
- Is it el cerdo?
- Somethin' like that.
- Bread.
- El pan.
- El pan, how bout milk?
- La leche.
-  How bout taco?
- I haven't learned that yet.
(laughs)
- It's just taco.
-  Or maybe
it's ticky-toe. (laughs)
- He's like what?
(air whooshes)
Elise and I are going to
my freezer group today.
So in two hours we are
gonna try to make 19 meals
to put in our freezer,
so that we can eat them
on all of our busy days.
That's the goal.
This is the recipe we
are working on first.
- Toe-kitos?
-  Taquitos.
- Taquitos.
-  Yum, kay, we
need the jar of green salsa.
Can you open it?
-  Oh shoot,
I forgot to buy red peppers.
I just went out--
-  Gotta twist it, twist it hard.
- Which way?
-  Do you want some help?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, this is on really tight.
Ahh, got it.
(calm music)
So we're chopping three
bunches of cilantro
with the food processor.
Ready, press pulse.
(grinding)
- It's such a strong smell.
-  I love it.
Do you like it?
- A little bit.
-  Now we're
adding the cream cheese.
You ready for this?
Go for it, yeah.
(cheerful instrumental music)
Are the gloves a little too big?
- Yeah, totally.
I like this job.
-  It looks disgusting,
but it tastes really yummy.
We added pepper jack
cheese and now chicken.
(cheerful instrumental music)
So we're shredding the
chicken in the mixer.
Super fast and easy.
- It's a mountain of cheese and chicken.
-  It is, it is truly a mountain.
(cheery violin music)
I'm really stocking up on meals this month
because my freezer is almost
empty of freezer meals
and because I like to have a few on hand
that if someone needs a
meal, like a neighbor,
I can take them something that's easy
and I've got the stuff.
So I got three of these
red and white pastas.
We'll eat some and we'll
probably share some too.
Well we did it in two
hours, we made 19 meals
that we can go home and put in our freezer
and I love that because then on busy days
when I don't have time to
make a home-cooked meal,
I can pull it out and I
know it's a yummy meal
for my family.
Anyway, the average works out
to be about eleven dollars
per meal which is so much
cheaper than taking our family
to eat out and healthier, too.
(air whooshes)
- Last night we watched
Singing in the Rain.
-  And that's making
you want to tap dance?
(feet tapping)
(delicate music)
Good shot.
- What?
-  Good shot.
- So we just had our first
family lesson about how
to conjugate verbs in Spanish.
It actually went really well.
It's just the very
beginning, I mean conjugation
is such a big thing.
Which verb are you working on?
- Nadar.
-  What does that mean?
- Sing.
-  Not to sing.
- Um, swim.
-  Swim.
Good work, good work.
- Now tu would go like this.
-  Very good, very good.
Don't forget tu, the u has an accent
on top of it, like that.
-  You working on your Spanish?
You're probably gonna know
Spanish better than any
of us if we work on it with you.
(happy guitar music)
(laughs)
This girl is so helpful.
She helped us clean up dinner
and she got her jammies on real quick.
Isaac's helping us out right
now, putting away some food.
So we've done dinner,
we've cleaned up and Kendra
and I are going to eat
our salad that is part
of the cleanse we're doing
and then we'll continue
on with this tomorrow.
Thanks for watching today.
J House out.
(upbeat violin music)
-  Eight, nine, ten.
Here I come.
