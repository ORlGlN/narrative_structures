- Shake it out.
- Ah ah.
(baby laughing)
- There it is.
- Let me guess who didn't
take a nap today.
- This the winner.
- Ah. (girls screaming)
- Yum!
-  Three, two, one.
(fast upbeat music)
- We're starting the day off
with some family yoga.
-  Lift one leg
and place it as high as you can.
Bring the palms of your
hands together and your foot.
-  Good job.
-  Now you're
balancing like a tree.
(slow music)
(Caleb yelling)
- Apparently this one's
called the lion pose.
-  You gotta roar. (child roaring)
- This one's the snake pose.
-  One, two, three, strike!
(children hissing)
- Shake it out, shake it out.
-  Everything everywhere,
let your body move.
- That's a great yoga pose,
you guys are awesome at this.
You're an athlete what
do you think of yoga?
- It's okay.
- I love yoga.
It's amazing how good
it feels on your body
and what a great start to
the day it is with the kids.
(children laughing)
- Okay, okay, I'm gonna move here.
-  What'd going on?
- We're playing a game.
-  And it's come down to
- Yeah.
-  Kings and one pawn.
- We're saying he can move
anywhere now, the pawn.
-  I don't think you can
change the rules dude.
- Yeah, you can only move this.
- Okay.
- So only one thing sounds really good
for dinner tonight and it's
chicken tortilla soup,
but luckily I have a good recipe
I haven't made for awhile.
And I found it, it's slow cooker
chicken tortilla soup.
So I just dump everything in the crock pot
and let it cook, yum.
(upbeat music)
- So this morning around 4:30am
Janae woke up, Kendra fed her
and I laid her down
and then I couldn't go back to sleep.
My mind has just been racing
about this thing for work that's coming up
next week and I laid in bed
for over an hour and a half.
Finally I just started to get up
and start working on it.
But I was wondering if
that ever happens to you?
Where you can't sleep because
you're excited about something,
or you're working on something
that keeps you up at night.
So let me know in the poll,
do you ever struggle with sleeping?
Do you see the spider?
- Uh huh.
-  Shush, wow.
- It moved.
-  It moved.
That big old spider, crazy.
- It stopped raining so we
had to sneak outside and play.
(fast electronic music)
- Oh ho.
There it is.
- Ah ho. (baby laughing)
Peek a boo. (baby laughing)
Peek a boo, peek a boo (baby laughing)
-  Did you find Sissy?
- Peek a boo.
Peek a boo.
Ah ha.
- So this is a tradition
that goes all the way back to Issac
when he was a baby.
When the kids had a poppy diaper,
I didn't like to just
take it out to the trash.
I'd like to try to make an
amazing shot into the trash.
So lately Janae's been providing us
with a lot of ammunition.
(bell ringing)
-  Great, first shot!
That was amazing.
Okay, cubbie, you want to scoot up a bit?
(bell ringing)
Oh!
He has natural skill.
Oh, here she comes.
Here she comes.
(bell ringing)
Whoo! (girl cheering)
Alright let's go wash our hands.
(fast upbeat music)
- So something we often do in the car
is we do read alouds,
this is our current read aloud,
we just started it today
and we're liking it.
Any guesses who didn't take a nap today?
-  Well not till now.
- That's rue, she just fell asleep though
it was a short drive.
Laura, Laura.
- So we're at Joann's Fabric
for all the kids to pick out
fabric for a blanket they're gonna make.
They're each gonna make their own,
then we're gonna donate
them to a local nonprofit.
(slow upbeat music)
- So you've narrowed
it down to these five?
Looks like Apps on our phone,
- Ah.
-  That's kind of cool.
Then you got this soccer,
basketball, football and tools.
Which one do you want to take out?
Okay, you've narrowed it
down to the final two?
Which one you gonna go with?
This is the one?
- This is the one.
-  You went with the footballs?
- Yep.
-  Hey Laura,
do you want to pick out
some fabric for a blanket?
- Yeah, I want pink.
-  Oh, you like pink,
there's lots of pink options.
Okay, let's see if we can find something.
- Oh yeah, I choose that one.
-  You like the lady bug one?
-  Uh huh.
-  Whoa look how pretty
that one is.
- This is not heavy at all.
-  Oh that one
has unicorns and castles.
How are you gonna decide?
- I choose the lady bug one.
- I choose black.
-  You're gonna choose black?
- Uh huh, because my
favorite color is black.
- Your new favorite color is black huh.
Sometimes as a mom it's
really hard to let go
of control and actually let them pick out
the things they want to choose,
not the ones I want to choose.
But I love that they're decisive
and they know what they want.
So Jeremy we were walking to find you guys
and she shreeks at this aisle.
She's like wait stop.
- It's all sparkly.
- I want mermaid.
-  I want mermaid.
-  You want to be a mermaid?
- Uh huh.
- Kind of looks princessy over here.
Have you seen this one?
-  Issac found a section
he could get excited about.
Sports teams.
-  I love this section.
- We found Royals fabric.
-  I love this.
-  So I think that's
a really cool color
to put on the back of that one.
Good pick.
So do you know what you want?
- I have no idea.
-  Uh oh, that sounds familiar.
You nad I are pretty similar.
- Yeah.
This one.
-  You like that one, it's pretty.
- Yeah.
Ah, I want that one.
- You like it?
- Uh huh.
I think I need to narrow it down
so then I won't come home with a ton.
-  So many choices, huh.
- I know.
-  And they're all cute.
- Uh huh.
Oh it's so hard.
-  'Cause they're
all great choices.
- Alright so we're needing
a yard of everything.
There we go.
So she's measuring it
out to be exactly a yard.
(fast guitar music)
-  It'll be 36.25.
- So the fabric store is really close
to one of our favorite parks,
so we had to stop.
Who wants to play?
-  American Ninja warrior!
(fast guitar music)
- Go! (girls screaming)
- I climbed up all by myself.
-  Good job big girl.
- Did it.
-  Good job.
- Ah ha.
- I'm so grateful that dinner is cooking
in the crock pot because we can stay out
and play all the way
until dinner time and then
go home and dinner's ready.
I love that feeling.
(slow music)
- Wo, wo!
-  You've gotten so
much better at cartwheels,
you're doing awesome.
(upbeat music)
- Together so that none of it falls out.
-  What are you making Elise?
- Cornbread.
-  For dinner?
- Ah huh.
-  It's gonna be good.
- I got it perfectly.
I know.
-  I'm just helping it.
- Not yet.
- Yum!
- It's looking perfect.
And it even says 400.
-  Yep and you
only have 15 seconds left.
Should we get it our and test it?
- Seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.
Your foods ready!
-  Alright,
let's open it up and see.
Looks good.
-  Here's our
chicken tortilla soup
that cooked in the crock pot all day.
How's the cornbread?
- Good!
-  Nice work.
- So after dinner, Elise
is heading to Ballet,
Issac he has scouts and then
we're gonna head to bed.
J house out.
(kids screaming)
-  Hee haw, hee haw, hee haw.
