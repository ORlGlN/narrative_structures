- That was so clever, it was right here!
-  In your jacket pocket?
(upbeat music)
(laughs)
-  Oh my goodness, you guys.
- There!
-  Oh, she's getting two at a time.
- Excited.
-  What are you so excited for?
(upbeat music)
-  Good morning, Namy.
(gurgles)
Did you find eggs?
It's Easter.
(gurgles)
- Good morning and happy Easter,
we're starting our Easter Sunday off
with opening some special glitter eggs
that have different scripture verses,
and songs, and things to help us remember
our savior and the purpose of the holiday.
-  Alright, Laura, you pick an egg.
Open it up.
(upbeat music)
- Follow him, Easter video cartoon.
-  You guys want to
watch an Easter video?
-  Jesus Christ
spoke these simple words
to his closest friends,
and his invitation.
(upbeat music)
- Matthew: 20.
-  It's a scripture
from the new testament.
- And behold one of them
which were with Jesus
stretched out his hand.
(upbeat music)
- So I really appreciate
this idea that Kendra had
about thinking about Jesus
in a fun way as a family,
before we do anything else on Easter.
- I'm grateful that Jesus set
a really good example for us.
- I'm grateful that
Jesus died on the cross.
- I'm grateful for him dying on the cross.
- I'm grateful that he
healed people from the dead.
- I'm grateful for the comfort and hope
that our savior Jesus
Christ gives us during life.
- I'm grateful that what Jesus did
makes it possible for us
to have second chances.
To be clean, to be better.
(upbeat music)
- Easter morning breakfast
is strawberry milk,
cinnamon rolls, strawberries,
and hard-boiled eggs.
The decorated kind.
You guys did a great job on these.
- Do you want some
strawberry milk, pretty girl?
(laughs)
-  That's her first time.
("Eine kleine Nachtmusik" by W.A. Mozart)
- And look at my one.
-  We're peeling
and eating all of our eggs.
- This year, for the egg hunt,
each kid is looking for their own color.
This made it possible for us to hide
Isaac's and Elise's a lot
harder than Jenay and Laura's.
(shrieks)
-  Da da. Come on!
Let's go, whoa!
-  This is her first
real Easter egg hunt.
- Go get some eggs.
-  Look, an egg.
Put it in your bucket.
Yay!
(claps)
-  Yay! (claps)
Oh, she's getting two at a time!
-  Yay!
(claps)
(cheers)
(gurgles)
- She's like, get it in there.
-  Good job!
She's like, look at her hair go.
She's going.
-  She's on a
mission to her next one.
- Jenay has accidentally
gotten a couple of yours.
(rattles)
(laughs)
- So Laura you're looking for
pink and purple eggs, okay?
(classical music)
Whoa, she's on it!
-  Good find.
- Hey, one right there.
-  They're going
to get harder and harder.
Oh, that was a hard one!
-  Good find!
- Caleb you are blue!
- Is this mine?
-  Yep.
-  Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- There!
-  Yeah, Olin found one.
- Is there anymore? (gasps)
- Elise is up and she is yellow.
- (gasps) There one is! (laughs)
-  Someone has a yellow one. (laughs)
- Naynay has an egg, yellow one!
(shouts)
- One more.
- Isaac, you are green.
Good luck.
- They are not easy to find, friend.
(rattles)
-  You're gettin' really close!
(claps) You found it, don't open 'em!
-  So what's funny, Isaac,
is you have passed by several of the eggs.
Where you looked in the place
where the eggs were, and didn't find them.
You keep going right by them.
(laughs) Good one.
So you already went
down, touched the ball,
and didn't see the egg. (laughs)
- (gasps) Is it inside of there?
(laughs)
-  Okay, how many more
do you need now, Isaac?
- Five more?
-  How many more do you need?
- Four.
(upbeat music)
-  (whispers) good find.
-  Oh my, that one.
-  You're really
warm, oh colder, colder!
Warmer, warmer, you are so hot!
You are so hot.
(laughs)
So all the toys down here actually
make it really hard to find all the eggs.
- (laughs) That was so good!
-  Earlier you
went right by that one.
- That was so clever, it was right here!
-  In your jacket pocket?
- Uh-huh, I only have one
more and it's so tough.
- So Elise has one egg left,
and she and I both can't find it.
Like, I'm looking with her.
I have no idea where this egg is.
Well I finally found Elise's last egg,
and so we're gonna do hot
and cold while she finds it.
Warmer, warmer, warmer.
Colder.
Warmer.
Colder, colder, colder!
Warmer.
Oh your feet are on fire!
(shrieks)
(laughs)
- It was hard, but I got it!
-  You got it,
the yellow on yellow.
- It's the exact yellow.
-  It is, yes,
you found all your eggs!
Are you ready to come play?
- Uh-huh.
-  So what's
inside your eggs this year?
-  Legos!
-  Alright, open 'em up.
(upbeat music)
So this is gonna be Laura's
very first lego set.
- Where's the destruction?
-  The what?
- The destructions.
-  The instructions?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, I'll go
grab the instructions.
Here's Laura's, you got
a snow white castle.
You're gonna build that.
Mister Caleb,
- Oh yeah!
-  You're going to build
whichever one of those three you want.
Leesy,
- Oh, a race car.
-  There's Isaac.
- So I can build any of them?
-  Yeah.
- This is so cool!
-  Did you put
snow white together?
Good job.
Okay then, you read the
instructions for the next one.
So Isaac, Elise, and Caleb all got these
creator three-in-one sets.
So you can make three different things
with the same set of legos.
- I think this is bringing a lot more joy
to the family than, like, candy.
-  You think so?
We did not tell you to say that.
So we decided to do no candy
in Easter eggs this year,
and I'd warned the kids about that,
that there wasn't going to be
any candy in the Easter eggs,
and they've been a little
concerned about it.
So I'm glad to hear that
they're liking this.
(upbeat music)
- Excited!
-  What are you so excited for?
- For a new dress!
-  We're getting
new Easter dresses,
so the girls haven't seen
their new Easter dresses
yet, but guess what?
We did something that
we've never done before.
We got matching for you,
and Laura, and Jenay,
you guys all have matching dresses.
- And you!
-  Unfortunately, I don't.
Shall we do that some time?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, that's
some real excitement.
Okay, I'll go get the dresses.
(classical music)
And open!
(shrieks)
- It's so cute!
- So cute!
-  You guys wanna wear 'em today?
What do you guys think of your shirts?
- They're not,
- Awesome.
- I didn't expect it.
-  They're pink.
- So the girls have navy dresses
and I thought the pink
went really well with it.
- I'm okay with it, I like pink.
- We're hosting Easter
dinner tonight for our family
and for Jeremy's brother and his family.
And we're having ham, and
usually I cook our hams
in the crock pot, but it doesn't fit.
It's too big.
I read online and online has
lots of truths in it,
-  It must be true.
- (laughs) right?
I read online that you can
actually cook a ham in a paper bag.
Like, just drop the ham in
the paper bag and bake it.
And they say it's really
good so we're gonna try it,
but it's always a little
bit nerve-wracking
to try something new when
you're having people over.
- Bring it on.
- I think Jeremy's a little bit skeptical.
- I feel like we need to put it
on a cookie sheet or something,
so that if the juices come out
it doesn't get all over the oven.
-  So this is the
very technical technique
of sticking the ham,
I think you have to take the plastic off.
- I will, I'm just gonna do it in here.
Now I'm going to de-plastic it,
and get juice all over my feet.
- So this is the very first year
that I've successfully
done Easter outfits.
Like the girls are all matching,
the boys are all coordinated,
like this is really exciting for me
so I'm gonna attempt a picture.
Oh my goodness, you
guys this looks so cute!
Okay, ready?
One, two, three!
(gasps)
-  She's like what the heck?
(laughs)
- Now what do we do?
I want a picture of all of us.
-  Maybe we should
-  Try a selfie?
-  invite the neighbors over?
-  Invite the
neighbors over? (laughs)
-  Hey
could you take a picture?
-  Naynay!
-  Oh my goodness, Nay!
-  Jenay, Jenay!
Time for a girl picture.
- Can you scoot over?
Ready, set, cheese!
- Cheese!
(laughs)
- One, two, three!
- Cheese!
- Cheese.
-  So we feel like
nature's April Fool's joke
to us today is snow.
It's snowing.
-  Caleb's finishing up his
second creation of the day.
- I finished my car and
now I'm gonna test it.
(laughs)
- Now it's time for an Easter basket.
This is the second year that we've done
a family Easter basket,
and I'm excited about it.
It's fun to just do a simple thing
that we can celebrate and
enjoy together as a family.
(laughs)
(squeaks)
-  Yeah.
She found the binkies!
(screams)
- Starburst!
- Starburst!
-  The first thing they notice.
- What are these again?
- So these are two games,
Qwirkle and Hoot Owl Hoot.
- Boom Chicka Dop?
- This is popcorn.
- Cool, but I don't know what it's like.
-  We should play it as a family.
- Yep, and eat some
jellybeans and popcorn.
(cheers)
So Jeremy was right, I was wrong.
I'm totally okay with
that, Jeremy's a genius.
I didn't think it was
gonna make any juice,
I didn't we needed the cookie sheet.
He's a smart man.
Okie-dokie.
- For this guy,
- Put that one,
- I'm gonna put down blue.
- No, keep that one.
(sings)
(laughs)
- So I had to dig through a box
to get my snow stuff
that I had packed away.
I want to make a clear
path through the snow
for our family that's coming
over for dinner for Easter.
So I don't know if it's the snow,
but we've seen a bunch of deer
in our backyard, and a fox.
And obviously there's a lot of birds.
It's always fun when
there's wildlife around.
(upbeat music)
- I'm grateful for Michael and Elise.
-  (laughs) And Isaac, Caleb?
- I'm grateful for Laura
and Elizabeth and Jenaynay
and Elise and Isaac.
-  You made it! (laughs)
-  Good night, Jay house out.
- This one's going to
be perfect! (evil laugh)
(upbeat music)
-  How'd it turn out?
- Really good.
