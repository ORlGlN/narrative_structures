-  So Mom, how's
Halloween morning been?
How's it been?
- It's been a little chaotic so far.
I think I only threatened
to take Halloween away once.
(Jeremy laughs)
I'm kind of joking.
I didn't threaten to take Halloween away,
I said maybe we wouldn't
carve our pumpkins
because we were having
some lack of cooperation
over chores and schoolwork.
But I think the morning's turning around
and I think we're gonna
have a great afternoon.
And, hey can you say hi?
Hi. (laughs)
- There it is.
Alright, it's Friday
which means Meals on Wheels
but it's a little bit more
exciting on Halloween.
You guys excited?
- Yeah.
- Come on, Cubby.
Go ahead and knock.
(knocking)
- Alright, thank you, Pinterest.
We're having a festive food morning.
Actually, we've made these mummies
every year for several years.
And here's their lunch.
We're having mummies and ghosts.
And what are you drinking, Lacey?
What is it?
- Apple cider!
- Alright, so every year we
let the kids paint pumpkins
instead of carve pumpkins.
It's just a lot of fun
and it's pretty easy.
So, Jeremy does the pumpkin
carving at our house
because I am not allowed
to play with knives.
- We've learned by sad experience.
Kendra and knives do not mix.
-  So I also don't cut watermelon.
Pretty much anything that's large or
requires a large knife.
Woah!
Cool, Isaac!
Lacey, I love your polka dots!
Cubby, let me see!
(babbling)
- Woah!
How did he do that?
- Woah! Wow!
- That's a cake?
- That's not cake, that's pumpkin!
- No!
- Did you like it, Isaac,
the square eyes like you said?
With a little eyeball in between?
-  Caleb, are
you admiring the pumpkin?
- Mm-Hmm.
-  So guys, I totally
don't have any other candles
so we've got these little
tiny electrical candles.
-  From last year.
-  From last year.
Anyway.
-  Can I see?
-  We can make fire in
there, we'll get it to work.
-  We'll figure it out.
But I don't trust Caleb
right next to it at the edge.
-  Why?
-  Okay, guys, what
should we name our pumpkin?
-  Kiki!
- Orangelicious!
-  Orangelicious?
-  Orange-alicious?
Orange-alicious it is!
- I know!
Michael! Michael!
- That's a little boring.
- Or Michael.
Let's go with Orange-alicious.
-  Orange-alicious or Michael?
That's funny.
- Orange-alicious.
Here you go, welcome to the
family, Orange-alicious.
Nope, no touching.
So, Jeremy is cutting open the pumpkin
that we're going to eat for dinner.
And, beside him we have
the Halloween honeydew.
- Obviously!
Doesn't everyone have
a Halloween honeydew?
-  So we have another
story to tell you guys.
Don't cut yourself
while we tell our story.
- I might not look at the camera while--
- So, when Jeremy and I were dating,
we got engaged in October.
And we were both busy
working and going to school
and anyway, Halloween night came
and we were spending it
together and we said,
"Hey, you know what would be fun?"
- A pumpkin!
- "Carving a pumpkin!
"Let's go!"
So we hopped into our car
and headed down to the grocery store
and there was literally
not a single pumpkin
in the grocery store.
- Yeah, nothing.
- None.
- So we were like, "Well
we wanna carve something."
So we grabbed a honeydew.
- And we carved a honeydew.
- And it was a pleasant experience.
- It really was.
- It was sweet to the taste.
- It was soft and easy to cut.
- It glowed green when
we put a candle in it.
- Which was the coolest part!
Anyway,
- So we've continued to
carve honeydews for Halloween.
- It's really fun, we
totally recommend it.
- Yeah.
- And, so that's the story
of our first Halloween.
