yeah
which we sing Cayman is boredom Jesus -
such a pretty Sun but just some
she's like can I put it in my mouth
she seems happy about those binky she
wants what she loves did she want to
brushes oh there she goes
no need open it all gifts are measured
by their value to gnaw on
she's like socks
who cares about sucks I already know
that it's an innate understanding it
smells like ranges in here and cinnamon
rolls bread monkeys we're heaven here's
our bread monkeys when we call it monkey
bread
so it's so easy you just take the frozen
rolls and you stick them in a bundt pan
and you dump the goodness in it and then
it rises overnight and then you cook it
in the morning it's awesome so they all
have new toothbrushes so they're super
excited about brushing their teeth
awesome it's 8:25 right now and all
they've done so far is open their
stockings and eating our breakfast a lot
this is the first gift to be opened this
is her first Christmas see it what am I
supposed to do you guys what's all the
fuss open your present you get to rip
that paper out all she wants to do is
eat the paper let's be honest
what this can be a long Christmas what's
in there she's like I have that paper
part was fun great address where's the
paper again it's Caleb's turn I can open
it in a minute but look on the back do
you see what it does yeah it's a fire
truck that shoots play-doh
so these are like football cards but
they're stickers and so you collect all
the people and you put them where they
belong on the team so I may not be the
best at getting gifts for camera but I'm
definitely the best at wrapping the
gifts for you I don't think Laura's
interested so Caleb you know me and they
ready
