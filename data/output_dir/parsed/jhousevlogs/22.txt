- The sun is out, and it feels so good.
(upbeat music)
- First time on the chairlift.
-  Ready to go home?
- Yeah.
-  So Janae
has been signing shoes.
It's been so fun to know
that she understands what that means.
I don't know if those will
go well with her jamas.
But look, she's like, "Put it on!"
oh, it's slippery over there.
(children cheer)
Shoes, shoes.
♪ (mumbles) ♪
- We're running late to
gymnastics, but I don't care
because the sun is out,
and it feels so good.
(upbeat music)
The kids are doing an obstacle
course at gymnastics today.
- So one of the most important chores
that we've included for
our kids is decluttering.
We bring everything from
all of the countertops
and all of the ledges that is clutter.
We put it all on the table,
and then we work together
to put it all away.
It's amazing how clutter can
just accumulate and accumulate
if it's not dealt with.
Can you go put the hammer up, bud?
-  Mm-hmm.
-  Thanks.
- We're going skiing.
-  You're getting
all the snow stuff ready?
-  This one's mine.
-  Awesome.
Alright, and you got yours.
- Mm-hmm.
(upbeat music)
I don't see how we'll be skiing here.
Like I don't see much snow.
- I'm surprised too.
-  So Isaac, how are you feeling
about going skiing for the first time?
- I'm feeling excited and a little scared.
-  What are you
feeling scared about?
- Just since it's my first time.
- I'm feeling a little bit
scared and a little bit excited.
(upbeat music)
- It's really weird to walk
because it's like completely
flat on the bottom.
- It's just like tap dance shoes.
It's perfect.
- So we're starting off with the kids
doing a ski lesson to
learn how this works.
- Shoes!
This little girl likes shoes.
(upbeat music)
Success.
Not only is it sunny,
but the weather today is warm and amazing.
And it's just (sighs), it
makes a big difference.
I am so grateful for spring.
God knew that we couldn't
handle winter all year round,
so spring is a glorious thing.
(upbeat music)
So these kids have all grown so tall
that the swings that we hung
years ago are now too low.
(Kendra chuckles)
They still play on 'em,
but Jeremy and I need to
figure out how to raise these.
Hmm.
-  How do you raise 'em?
-  We'll just
have to untie that knot
and tie a new knot that makes
it up a little bit higher.
- So the kids are trying
to use this rope lift
to get up the hill.
It's going!
-  Stand up tall!
Stand up tall!
Yeah, just slowly grab.
Let go, let go, let go!
-  Good job.
Good work, Ms. Laura.
-  There you go.
(Jeremy chuckles)
Good job, Elise.
You guys are skiing.
How was that?
- It's really fun.
- You're gonna just sit
down when it comes up, okay?
And lean back.
First time on the chairlift.
Elise is coming up.
The key is just don't go too early, okay?
So you wanna wait until we can stand up.
Not yet, not yet.
Don't go yet.
So you wanna start
standing up and push off.
Good job, Elise!
Awesome!
That was great, first time.
(whimsical music)
- Well, we're going on a bit of a walk,
and I've got Janae in the stroller.
Laura's walking with me, and
Caleb is riding his bike.
But I should have grabbed
the double stroller
because Laura wants to ride.
Then I'm holding her, and
then it's hard to push.
I'm holding my baby.
Are you ready to walk?
- Yeah.
- Oh!
She lost a ski.
Mastering the ski lift is
a big part of this journey.
Have fun.
-  What happened?
You lost a ski.
-  I don't know.
-  You got this, Elise.
-  Alright, now.
Oh, no!
(upbeat music)
-  Well, the snow is super slushy.
That's good for learning.
It slows you down.
Good job, Elise.
You're under control.
That's great!
So what did you think of your ski lesson?
- It was really fun.
Now I know how to ski.
-  You really
started to control yourself.
I'm proud of you.
Snap it in.
There you go.
- It feels so good to relax.
I'm a bit afraid of heights.
-  Well, I'm proud
of you for doing this.
Hey, Isaac.
- Can we go up the top?
- You wanna go to the top of the hill?
You okay, buddy?
Are you alright?
So we came over.
We're going off the top of the hill,
and it was a lot steeper
than we were ready for.
Isaac crashed, but he
gave the big thumbs up.
So I'm glad he's enjoying it.
(upbeat music)
This is our last run.
So let me know on the poll
if you've ever skied
or snowboarded or both.
Let us know.
Do you wanna keep going?
- Yes.
- Okay, let's do one more.
It's just so fun.
(upbeat music)
- I wanna come do this on my birthday
even though my birthday is in the summer.
- I just don't think
there'll be any snow, buddy.
We'll have to go to the North Pole.
Well, I look forward to
the day when we're able
to take them out to the Rocky
Mountains and do some skiing.

- We are running into the grocery store
with these little people.
We just need a couple of things,
one of which is ice cream because
we're having a family over
for dessert and a game night tonight.
And dessert is gonna be ice
cream so it's super easy.
- This is my favorite (mumbles).
I wanna try cinnamon roll.
- Caleb is a big fan of
oatmeal, so we're stocking up.
It's always hard for me
when I'm buying ice cream for a group
because everybody likes
different kinds of ice creams.
And I looK at it and
I'm like, "I don't know
"which kind everybody's
gonna like the best."
So what are your favorite
kinds of ice creams?
Or what do you think are
go-to crowd pleasers?
What do you get when you
need to get ice cream
that everybody likes?
What's that one?
-  I'm voting for it.
-  You're voting for it?
How's it going?
- Good.
- We got more than we needed.
- We did get more than
I planned on getting.
Janae's enjoying looking at everything.
We did it!
I survived with the three kids.
I can't believe I used
to do this with four.
Five isn't harder for some reason
because the big kids are so helpful.
Thanks for your help, Caleb.
Oh, it's getting dark out there.
How are you?
- Good.
-  Ready to go home?
- Yeah.
- So Jeremy and I have
people over on occasion,
but not super often.
And one of those reasons
that I've been nervous
about inviting new
people over to our house
is I think I'm a little
bit self conscious.
I'm self conscious that our house
is not maybe large enough to host people.
Like maybe there's not seats for everyone
or things like that.
And also, my house isn't decorated at all.
It's a very simple home.
It's a beautiful home, and we love it.
But I think when new
people are coming over,
it kinda makes me look at it
through different eyes and I'm like,
"Uh, I don't know if we should
really be hosting anybody.
So while we have, you know,
good friends over regularly,
it's always a little bit
intimidating to me to invite
new people over, especially
people that I don't know well.
And I really want to get to
know my neighbors better.
You know, these people we
have lived near for so long,
and you drive by and you
wave, maybe say hello
in the summertime when
people are out and about.
But I've thought many times
about inviting neighbors over
for dinner, but that just
feels intimidating to me.
So I decided that I want to change that.
And so Jeremy and I have
already started extending
some invitations, and I'm truly excited
to get to know the people
of our church community
and our neighborhood community
better simply by trying to be
more open and open the doors of our home.
And it doesn't have to be
this deluxe amazing dessert
or this phenomenal dinner.
And it can just be ice cream,
or it can just be pizza,
but it's just sitting down
together and visiting,
even if it's over paper plates.
That's a goal that Jeremy
and I are working on,
and I'm really looking forward to it.
-  So Kendra loves puzzles.
- I do.
-  It's a fun thing.
- This one's a really cool one.
It's a bunch of flip-flops.
So we are chatting about their day skiing
and putting in a few pieces before bed.
-  The kids have been so cute
telling you their excitement about it.
- It's been awesome hearing about it.
- Well, I was really proud of
how courageous the kids were.
Good night.
J House out.
So Elise has a pretty loose tooth.
(Jeremy laughs)
(Kendra chuckles)
-  I'm just doing my squats.
