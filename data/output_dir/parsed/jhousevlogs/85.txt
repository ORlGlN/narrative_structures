- You know in real life I
wouldn't want to eat a camel.
-  Definitely not.
And I'm going to try to do
Jenae's hair for the very first time.
- It's a new wonderland.
(upbeat music)
(screams)
- Bye.
(upbeat music)
-  Good morning.
- Good morning.
-  We have
breakfast ready, come on.
- Yay, yay.
Hello?
How you doing?
- Our camera is still lost.
We were really hoping it would
turn up somewhere, somehow
and it just hasn't.
We're filming with an old camera today,
hoping it'll show up.
But if by the end of the day, it hasn't,
we are just going to
have to order a new one.
I feel like whenever we lose something,
there's this inner struggle of
how long do you wait
before you replace it.
There's the fear that as
soon as you replace it,
you'll find the old one.
Tonight, we're having a family movie night
and it is a classic.
Do you wanna tell them
which one we're gonna watch?
- The real Grinch.
-  The real Grinch.
- The real Grinch day.
- The kids have watched
the old animated Grinch
a couple times, but they've never seen
the what's it called, live action.
They've never seen that Grinch.
So tonight, we're going to
have a Grinchy celebration.
So I'm putting the roast beast
in the crock pot right now.
- How about the Who Pudding?
-  Who Pudding and Who Hash?
- Uh huh.
- That's what we're gonna do.
Well we just do simple
stockings at our house,
but I needed to go buy
an new stocking this year
because Jenae needs a stocking.
So we're getting ready to hang them up.
I use these, what are these things called,
Command Stripe hanger things.
Isaac's helping me put them up.
So we're putting those up.
- It's on pretty little.
-  Let's put up a
few more of those hooks.
What do you think?
- I think I wanna try one.
-  So now we've
got these little hooks
that just come from underneath our mantle.
Isaac's doing a great job
helping me get them up.
Then when we're done with
them, we just pull them off.
Do you wanna hang up the stockings?
- Sure.
Tada.
-  The official
hanging of the stocking.
The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,
except for the girl that was hiccuping.
(bell music)
You wanna get the toys out?
- Trees.
- Let's get out Baby Jesus.
(piano music)
I have a hard time knowing
which one's Joseph.
- The shepherd holds a baby sheep.
(piano music)
Do you see Mary and Joseph?
It's an angel.
The angel goes on top.
Just push it right there.
- This one matches with that.
- That's a thing for hay for the horses.
- How ago did we get this?
-  We got this
when you were a baby.
(piano music)
It's doing it.
Isn't that the coolest toy?
I love this thing.
- This isn't safe to sleep in.
-  You don't think stables
are very safe to sleep in?
- But I think inside of it is safe.
-  Yeah, it'd be safe,
but would it be very warm?
- No.
-  What did you find?
Did you find a toy?
Jenae just woke up from her
nap, so it's her first time
seeing the little play nativity toy.
You like the camel?
She's a fan of the camel.
Why's that funny?
- Because Jenae's sucking on that.
- You know in real life I
wouldn't wanna eat a camel.
-  Definitely not.
She's standing up, this is the
perfect spot for her to play.
(Away in a Manger)
She's excited.
It makes noise!
So we bought this nativity
toy back when Isaac
was like two years old
and Elise was just a baby.
So I just have fond memories of each
of the kids playing with it.
One of my favorite memories was when Isaac
was like four years old
and I looked down and
he was playing with this
little toy school bus.
He had Mary and Joseph in the school bus.
I was like, what are you doing?
He said, oh Joseph's taking
Mary on the bus to Bethlehem.
I was thinking, I bet Mary
wished there had been a bus.
We're getting ready for church
and I'm going to try to do
Jenae's hair for the very first time.
She's never had it done.
-  It's getting longer.
I think she does-
She loves it.
- Well I think that was a fail.
-  There it is.
- She did not like it and I don't know
if she has quite enough hair yet.
-  It's like a comb over kind of.
- There's not much there.
Okay, we'll take that out.
Do you like that.
-  There we go.
- Do you like getting your hair brushed?
-  She's like why
are you messing with my hair?
-  You ready to go buddy?
- Yep.
-  Looking good.
- Well Jenae clearly
did not like the attempt
at the ponytail, but I
found this little clip
which looks like it's just
balancing on her head.
But it's actually attached
to hair and it's working.
Do you have a little bow on your hair.
-  Yeah, first hairdo.
- First hairdo attempt.
(bell music)
- So we're just trying to go into church.
Kendra wanted to take a quick picture.
- They all look so Christmasy.
One,
two,
three.
- So last year Caleb took some lights
and he decorated a box.
And the kids were wanting
to recreate that this year.
But we're upgrading it a little bit.
We're gonna make a light fort.
You guys ready?
-  Yeah.
- Can we grab our supplies.
(rock music)
-  So Elise, what are
you gonna put your lights on?
- This right here.
-  That's gonna be fun.
- I have a plan, but
I'm gonna start the plan
with something that you don't know.
-  Okay, it'll be a surprise.
How about you Isaac, what
are you gonna be decorating?
- I'm gonna be decorating the soccer goal.
-  The soccer goal in there.
Laura, what are you decorating?
- This.
-  The crate?
Cool.
- Daddy, I can't do this one.
-  You need a little help?
(rock music)
You guys connected it together?
- Got it.
-  Okay, connect it to Elise's.
- Almost ready.
-  Almost.
- Just one more loop.
-  You're doing great.
Sticking them in?
Awesome.
Okay, the kids have all the lights set up.
We're gonna turn it on
and see how it turned out.
Okay, we got all the lights off.
Go ahead and plug it in.
(screams)
-  It's a new wonderland.
It's a new wonderland.
- It went from dark.
- This tunnel is amazing.
-  Do you guys
like putting up lights?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
-  I think, no look
it's like a tunnel with lights.
-  Mine went to here.
- I wish we had more lights.
We could win the light-
-  Do you guys think
Nae-Nae would like it down here?
-  Yeah.
(Christmas music)
- Somebody's here.
-  Yeah, go see who it is.
Go see, who is it?
-  Justin and Ashley.
-  It's our cousins.
(screams)
Hey Elizabeth.
-  Look who's
here, it's Elizabeth.
What you guys doing downstairs?
- We're just playing house.
But we're pretending in 10 days
there's gonna be 10 hurricanes.
-  10 hurricanes in 10 days?
- Yeah
-  Oh you'd better be safe.
- This is my baby doll.
-  What's your baby doll's name?
- Rose Alice.
-  Oh I like it.
Are you playing with Elizabeth?
Hi girls, hi.
- So we're planning on
watching The Grinch tonight,
so Kendra made some
roast beast for dinner.
Got all the kid's plates ready.
And we're calling this Who Hash.
It's all in the marketing.
It's really just potatoes.
But it feels more fun to say you're having
roast beast and Who Hash.
So the internet and especially Pinterest
is full of all these creative
and cool Grinch desserts.
And I just wasn't feeling
up to doing anything really
overly creative or difficult today.
So we're doing something
easy, which is mint ice cream.
Everything's more fun
with whip cream on top.
(screams)
Laura's kind of developing a high pitched,
shrill shriek and it like gets in my ears.
There you go Laura, you ready?
- Yum.
- Bye.
-  Bye, she is waving at you guys.
Thanks for coming to play with us.
Bye, bye.
-  Bye you guys.
- Bye.
- I don't think so.
- Doubt, another unmistakable sign-
-  Goodnight, J House out.
(laughter)
- I found our first Geocache.
(upbeat music)
