- Hey!
I'm vlogging here!
Phwoo, woo.
What's more Disney than that?
Alright, my two favorite
YouTubers, Lindsey Stirling
and Shay Carl are gonna be
together in Walt Disney World
for Disney's first Creators
Conference in January.
When I think of my Disney
side, I think of dancing.
I think of breaking out into song,
and just having a lot of fun!
I think of frolicking in
the woods with a violin.
And I have four little kids in my family,
see those cute little faces?
And they have not gone
to Disney World yet,
and we wanna take 'em there!
What would you guys think
about going to Disney World?
