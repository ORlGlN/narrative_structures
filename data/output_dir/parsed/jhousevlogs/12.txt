-  So Janae is shall we call
it helping fold laundry.
- Destroying.
(upbeat music)
-  Did you find some bowls?
Good find.
(upbeat music)
Good job.
Well I'm really bummed.
All winter long we've been wanting
to take the kids ice skating
and we just haven't made the time for it.
Anyway, with it being March we were like,
we've got to schedule this soon.
So we scheduled it and today's the day
we're gonna go ice skating.
I just called and the
rink is not open today
because we're having one
of those crazy warm days.
We're in the type of
springtime when some days
are cold still and some days are warm.
So today the ice rink is closed.
Lesson learned though, if
something's important to you,
just do it, don't wait.
Janae are you helping with the laundry?
Are you gonna fold that one?
So Janae is shall we call
it helping fold laundry.
- No, destroying.
- So I don't really have a laundry day
but today I'm doing like
four loads of laundry.
So I guess today is laundry day.
The kids are helping fold and Janae
is wanting to be involved.
Go for it girl, fold it.
You folding sister's pants?
Good job.
Bring me another one, I'll fold it.
There we go.
Nope.
So we decided to take advantage
of the pretty weather today
and hit up the park.
(upbeat music)
Apparently the kids have made some sort
of an obstacle course.
You watching everybody?
Yay, you're cheering for them?
She's like, how do I do that?
(upbeat music)
Janae does not know what
to make of the wood chips.
What is this?
Climb on up here.
Going up.
Whoa!
So we're playing with friends at the park
but the main attraction
isn't the playground.
It's the tree with the sticks
and the dirt and the wood.
- Good job, how about this one?
You know these two notes.
- One, two, three, four, five.
- It's a fifth.
- It's a fifth, exactly.
(piano music)
-  This girl is such a big girl.
She eats real food these days.
She's having some leftover
pasta, grapes, veggies.
- Exactly what we had.
-  Exactly
'cause she's a big girl.
So at lunch today we had
an interesting discussion
as a family about
expectations and happiness.
And how our expectations of something
can affect our happiness.
Like if we have these
really high expectations
then we might be easily disappointed.
But if we have really low
expectation, we're easily happy
or do we go into it with a bad attitude
'cause we're just expecting
it to be miserable.
We've just been talking
a lot about expectations
and healthy expectations and hope.
And kind of how all of these
affect our happiness in life.
(rock music)
Blow kisses.
So Laura just walked by
getting a drink of water
and blew a kiss to Janae
and Janae blew a kiss back.
It just melted my heart.
- So I did my own ponytail
for my first time.
-  Oh, let's see it.
That looks really nice Laura.
- Thank you.
-  Where are you going?
You're dressed up so nice.
- I'm going to the gym with Mom
to play with Brittany.
-  To play with
your friend at the gym.
Well you definitely look nice for the gym.
(jazzy music)
- I thought I'd bring the kids with me off
to work today while
Kendra went to workout.
- I am doing stuff.
-  Are you lawyering?
- There's a secret drawer under here.
-  You found the secret drawer?
What did you find Isaac?
- I found an 1994 road atlas.
-  That's probably the
most exciting thing we have.
(upbeat music)
So are you lawyering?
- Yep, okay let's read this.
-  So after spending
some time at the office,
I wanted to bring the kids on
a little business field trip.
(upbeat music)
- What's Facebook advertising?
-  We are gonna go
learn all about it okay?
Alright, so this is Tom.
He's a friend of mine
from church actually.
He does some Facebook advertising
and he's gonna teach us about it.
- So it looks like you
already have a business page?
(upbeat music)
You comfy over there Elise?
- Are there any sports websites stuff?
- Absolutely.
-  There's all kinds of
advertisements in social media.
So we're talking to the kids about how you
can start a business over
anything you're interested in.
You can make a product and
then you can create that thing
and get it out through marketing.
Well there's legal sides of it
but really the most important thing is
that you have something
of value that you can sell
to people who wanna buy it.
That's a company.
- I wanna make a company.
-  You wanna make
a business or a product?
I was grabbing something out of the fridge
and a whole thing of
potatoes fell on the floor.
So I gotta try to clean
it up before Nae-nae
tries to eat it all.
So I'm doing more days of this cleanse.
What I really like about it is that
it's not a starvation plan.
There's still a lot of
calories, there's salads
and a protein ball.
It's just really, really healthy eating.
(baby screaming)
We're at the point where it's hard for
any of us to communicate with each other
'cause Nae-nae has something to say.
(rock music)
- Oh boy.
-  What are you kiddos doing?
- We're doing gymnastics.
-  Just working on your skills.
- My gymnastics is belly flops.
(rock music)
-  Goodnight, J House out.
- The treasure hunt is ready.
(orchestral music)
