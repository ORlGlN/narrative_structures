- One of the saddest, hardest things
when you have little
babies and little kids
is when they're feeling
sick and this little girl
will not sleep, we've tried
to put her down several times.
We've tried all the go-to's,
we nursed her again,
then we tried feeding her,
we changed her diaper,
we cuddled her and rocked
her for eons of time.
- We've come to the conclusion
that she's congested
and so we have to use the bulb syringe.
- This Evil Kievel.
See her little eyes,
doesn't she look so tired.
- But she's still so cute.
(laughs)
Alright, so Laura was a
trooper for the face-sucking
treatment, we decided
that we're also gonna
fill up the humidifier and put that
in her room to help with the breathing.
We hope this helps.
By the way, Laura sleeps in our closet.
- Have we ever mentioned that?
So this is our walk-in closet.
And this Laura's shelves and
back here is Laura's bed.
There's a vent in here.
- Most people do the
whole baby room thing.
- Nursery decorate thing.
- We thought it was more
convenient for her to be close
to us but still in her own room,
and not be too close to the
other kids to either be woken up
by Caleb or to wake up the other kids.
- We live in a three-bedroom
house which is awesome,
and we really like that
our kids share rooms,
but it's a little bit
hard when they're little
and they're taking lots
of naps to keep the kids
out of the rooms and so
it's actually really nice,
she's just off of our room
in her en suite nursery.

Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)
So we had a long night last night.
Anyway, she actually ended up throwing up
and she had a fever and you
should see these boogers.
So I couldn't get her to go to sleep
and so I held her while
she slept until like 3:30
and at 3:30, I was like, Jeremy.
- It's your turn.
- It's your turn
and he's like, "I'm gonna
try putting her to bed."
He lays her down, she
immediately goes to sleep
and then she slept for
the rest of the night.
- My shift was pretty rough.
(laughs)
- Anyway, so, what are
you clapping those hands?
- Say, "Yay, Dad!"
- Dada.
- We were all excited about this Monday,
you know you get all motivated.
- Let's start fresh!
We're gonna in some good routines.
- I'm gonna get off to work super early.
But then, when you're up through
most of the night, it's tough, so.
- One of the hard parts
is that then after being
totally sleep-deprived,
you still have to function
as a mother or a lawyer all day long.
- Yay.
Elise, can you put that way?
Is this the long stare-down?
Oh, she blinked.
- So I'm wishing that I
could blow-dry my hair,
and I'm trying to get
sick baby Laura to bed
and look what I come out to see.
What ya doing, Cub?
- Taking all of them off.
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting them all off.
- Caleb, we're supposed to leave them on.
No, buddy, stop, stop stop stop.
Update: thankfully Laura has been napping.
I'm so glad, she
definitely needed the rest.
We read some Christmas books
and Caleb un-decorated the tree
again and here is Isaac
re-decorating tree for me.
Alright, bud, what ya doing?
- I'm playing football outside.
-  You're headed outside to play?
- Mhmm.
-  So why'd you tuck
your pants into your socks?
- Well it's so my pants
won't like go crazy
so I'll have to pull them down.
- Oh, to keep 'em from going crazy.
That's a good idea.
Cool.
- And I tuck my shirt just
like football quarterbacks.
-  Are you gonna go outside too?
- Uh-Huh, and today's my ballet class
and I'm not going to
ballet and it's canceled
because I'm going somewhere fun.
- Caleb comes back.
-  Alright bud,
you've sung to the trains,
you've told them a story,
you've put 'em in their beds.
It's time to go now, okay?
- No, the trains are gonna cry!
-  Sometimes trains
have to cry, but we have to go.
- No, they are gonna cry.
- A bunch of friends of our put together
this live nativity that we're going to,
you guys excited to check it out?
-  Uh-huh.
- Alright we wanna go get a
good seat, so we gotta go.
-  And she brought forth
her first-born son and wrapped him
in swaddling clothes and
laid him in a manger.
(vocalizing)
-  Alright, Isaac, what was your
favorite part of the nativity?
- I think it was when the Wise
Men came and the shepherds.
- My favorite part was baby Jesus.
-  You liked baby Jesus?
How about you, Elise, favorite part?
- Mary and Joseph, because Joseph
was the person that I know.
-  Does he babysit us?
Yeah.
So we were driving home and
on the radio was the song
Feliz Navidad, and.
- Elise Navidad.
- Last year for Christmas, Elise always
thought that it was a song about her.
♫ Elise Navidad
Anyways, she loved that.
♫ Elise Navidad.
- Well it's actually Feliz.
(festive music)
- There.
- Right there?
That's a great spot for it.
