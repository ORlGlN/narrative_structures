waitwait today all right we are going to
be feeding the lorikeets
if I'm out of this hole I'd like to just
pop it out of there bunches of them
I don't want dropping the water
we found and identified all three
different types of penguins and I
ridiculously excited about I'm like a
kid more maybe worse
that looks fun I've got a stroller you
go
so we come out to the zoo and the kids
are excited about a slide go figure
right anyway it works out nicely my
friends at the bottom I'm at the top and
we're just cycling through
you wanna go see the polar bears yeah
awesome all right
I put Laura on my back well I meaning my
friend Pilar on my back I can't figure
out how to get her back there but she
seems to like it or where are you
piccaboo anyway it's been a really fun
and busy day at the zoo
I'm tired but the kids are excited we're
gonna stop by the polar bear and then
we're leav but I've been here with my
friend Michelle there's no shell and
it's so nice to come with friends it's
way better more fun for me too
cause
do you like the polar bear very cool I
see him coming in
it's so pretty to see the blossoms I'm
at her with the kids Kendra's getting
dinner ready okay Caleb what do you try
in you rollerblade in alright let's see
it
baby frosty don't hit the baby okay
so I've been preparing for an argument
in front of a judge on my most complex
case and I've done that a lot of times
it's just crazy the mix of emotions that
you feel getting ready for something
like that you know I'll be confident and
excited and at the same time there's a
huge weight and a burden to make sure
that you know every aspect of your case
to be prepared for anything the judge
might ask or any weakness in your case
that the other side might bring up and
it's also just overwhelming how big of a
deal it makes I mean if we lose the case
just how big of a deal that is to my
clients and making sure that we do win
so I've been really stressed and busy
with that a lot but it's exciting to
come home and spend some time with the
kids it's funny because at work I'm
always just a serious focused
hard-working guy for the most part and
it's fun to get to come home we with the
kids
