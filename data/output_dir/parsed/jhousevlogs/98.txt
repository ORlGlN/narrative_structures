(screaming)
-  Caleb's helping me paddle.
(laughing)
I'm a little bit nervous.
The graceful dismount. (laughing)
- I got all dirty.
-  Whoa, that's a pretty big one.
(bouncy pop music)
-  It's kinda cool out here, huh?
- Yeah.
- It's amazing how being
in a different landscape
than what you're used
to is so awe inspiring.
Like to everyone who lives here,
it's like, yeah, it's
the lake, no big deal.
But to us, it's like, look at this lake.
This is beautiful.
Whoa, whoa, hey.
Try again.
When you fall--
-  This floor's slippery.
-  Try again.
- I don't know how to play.
- So, the kids still haven't
adjusted to the time change.
So, at 5 a.m., we were all up.
We were like just snuggling
on the bed together.
And we have a couple of hours where we're
just like playing until
everybody else is awake
so we can go hang out with family.
It's kinda funny.
So, I'm not a coffee drinker.
I have never used one of these.
I'm tryin' to figure it out because
they have some hot chocolate here
and that sounds kinda nice this morning.
Who's the beautiful princess?
That's you.
All right, mug I'm guessing goes here.
Looks like this, would it come
out the bottom or the top?
Does it go in this way?
No, this way.
All right, let's turn it on.
- Big kids think that I'm little.
-  Why would they
think something like that?
- Because they think
that I'm gonna get hurt
with the things, with the
toys that are in the garage.
So, they think I'm little.
- Do you wanna play with me out there?
Let's go play some games, okay?
- But first, I need my hair done.
- Yeah, let's keep workin' on that.
All right, Nae Nae, it
says it's ready to brew.
I'm tryin' to hit one of these buttons.
That's not really workin'.
Let's do this one.
Go.
Nothing.
Hot chocolate, it's happening.
That's nice.
Should we try it?
That is super hot.
The sun is finally coming up.
We've only been up for
three or four hours already.
- We woke up at five.
- What do you see out there, Laura?
- There's a lake.
- So, it's not raining right now,
what'd you say we go kayaking on the lake?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- But, Dad, I know how
to go kayaking myself.
-  We're gonna go together.
-  This is the coolest thing ever.
(gentle acoustic music)
Can it hold all of your legs?
- I don't know.
I don't know if this is
gonna work very well.
-  Go.
(laughing)
- Okay, whoa.
This is just really, I mean,
I can't believe the water.
It's just perfect.
-  And you didn't fall in, yet.
- We have to get out, too, right?
-  Oh, that looks so fun.
Who wants a turn kayaking?
- Me.
- Me.
- Can I do it by myself?
-  We have to get life jackets.
Can he get out?
- I'm gonna come to the side
just in case we lose it,
it'll be a little bit easier.
-  I'm a little bit nervous.
Good job, Isaac, good job.
(laughing)
- I'm all about grace.
-  The graceful dismount.
(laughing)
- I mean, I could've stood up slowly
and done it, but I was just like, go safe
and roll over to the side awkwardly.
(bouncy orchestral music)
-  Where do you wanna go?
-  That way, into the fog.
(bouncy orchestral music)
-  There they are.
- Good job, Caleb, I think
you're the kayaking man.
-  He's doin' good, huh?
How was it, Caleb?
- It was fun, now I'm gonna go with Elise.
- Our entire trip
(crying)
is worth it.
This is amazing.
We need to move here and live on a lake.
I would do this every single morning.
This is amazing.
-  Hopefully, it
doesn't rain every morning.
-  Look, there's some sun.
I see sunlight.
-  There's the blue sky.
-  I'll hold the boat.
All right, Elise, pull this out
without whackin' anyone.
All right, Elise, you goin' in?
Wait, you gotta get a life jacket on.
She's in.
- Woo.
(laughing)
(bouncy orchestral music)
- Okay.
- One, two, three, four.
bouncy orchestral music)
-  We're putting the kayaks up
but we're hoping there'll be another day
when we can use them.
I'm gonna watch Jeremy
gracefully hang this.
(laughing)
Nice.
You made that look so easy.
- So, they had it the other
way, so water was getting in it.
- Well, I've seen my family,
and I've kayaked on this amazing lake.
My trip is made.
Everything after this is just bonus.
And there's a lot of bonus coming.
Look at this view.
This is amazing.
Did you wanna go out on the lake with me?
- No.
-  Not today?
Maybe another day?
- Yeah, a short one.
- A short one.
So, we realized we never
actually introduced where we are.
So, in case you were
curious, we flew to Seattle,
and we are north of the Seattle
area in a cabin on a lake.
And we're staying here,
it's a little rental house,
not too far from my
brother and his family.
And my whole family is coming into town
to have Thanksgiving
at my brother's house.
Today is a day that we get to
play here at the cabin a bit,
and then we're gonna go help
with some Thanksgiving prep.
And then we're actually gonna host
a little get together
at this cabin tonight.
-  You guys, look at that.
-  This is the driveway
to the rental house we're staying in.
(bouncy orchestral music)
- Wave, oh, no, let's just wave.
-  Hi.
Hip, hip, hooray.
(laughing)
- We're on our way to my brother's house,
but first we're making a
stop to pick up some pies.
Snohomish Pie Company.
Let's do it.
- Are we gonna have two pies?
-  We're gonna have three pies.
- Three pies like me.
-  Okay, thank you.
Now, home to make Thanksgiving rolls.
So, my awesome sister-in-law,
Melanie, is super organized.
She has everything planned out.
What people can eat at different times.
And this is the most
important, snack options.
- I'm probably like overly organized.
- No, it's a good thing.
We have like what, 20 people?
How many people are here?
- 21.
-  21, so she's organized.
She's ready for us.
A fully-stocked pantry.
(laughing)
Good job, what did you find?
- A Brookie.
-  Those are available?
Where's the hiding spot?
-  They're not readily
visible to the munchkins.
- Brookies are the best dessert ever.
I'm definitely gonna be
checking some of those out.
It's so organized and
look, there's a menu.
-  Cut 'em across like this,
it's like a finger between
them 'cause they raise.
- When we decided to come
and spend Thanksgiving
with my family, I was so
excited about these rolls.
These are my grandmom's recipe,
and my mom's made 'em every Thanksgiving
that I've ever had with her.
And I don't make them myself.
They're so much work and I'm scared
that I'm not gonna get 'em right.
I'm gonna have to learn someday,
but I'm glad my girls get to help Grandma.
- We're making these today, not tomorrow.
-  'Cause they take so much time
that we're gettin' it done today
so we'll have more time to
do other stuff tomorrow.
- The other reason is,
is because the turkey
takes up the oven all day tomorrow.
- My mom was having all
the little girls help her,
and I'm like, I wanna do it.
And my sister's like, me, too.
- I wanna do it.
- So, we're in, we're helping.
-  Laura, what are you doin'?
- Making rolls.
-  You making rolls?
- You fold it down, and
then you fold it again,
and then you cut it.
You did it.
You made a roll.
-  Oh, that's gonna be so yummy.
- Now, we cut it and and
then you hand it to Grandma.
You can work on that side.
In the comments below, I want to hear
about a family recipe
that's in your family.
Something that's amazing and just it feels
like family to you, let us know.
- I got all dirty.
-  Dirty, did you
get flour all over you?
Thanks for helpin', big girl.
You gonna go wash your hands?
Now, we have to let the rolls rise.
Yum.
- So, we're just going on a little tour
around Michael's house.
They live in such a beautiful area.
- Do you wanna see, look,
here's our back yard, Laura.
We're gonna go down there in a minute.
- We are?
-  Uh huh.
-  Are we allowed to go catch it?
-  I don't know
exactly where it is,
but we hear frogs out here all the time.
- This is a trail, too?
- It's a trail right by his house.
(bouncy guitar music)
So, that's Michael's house right there.
And they have this path back in the woods.
He said that there's blackberry bushes
right along here where they
can come and pick blackberries.
- You see all these little
pine cones all over the ground?
Which trees do you think these come from?
Is it a little tree or a big tree?
- A big tree.
- Yeah, it's from this
big one right above us.
They make these little tiny pine cones.
-  These are big maple leaves.
Let's see who can get the biggest one.
-  I think I got it.
-  That's pretty big.
-  Look at mine.
-  Oh, that one's big.
-  Look at mine.
-  Whoa, that's a pretty big one.
-  Did you get
some mud on your bum?
What happened?
- Well, I fell.
- You slipped?
- Well, I wanna see it.
Oh wow.
- It's pretty dirty.
- They had a greasy tree.
-  Did they have greasy trees?
- Yes, it was all green.
-  Yeah, is it green
stuff growing on the tree?
- Yeah.
-  That's called moss.
- Oh, moss, it's moss.
- Check out the moss on that tree.
We had an awesome time
at my brother's house.
We're now bringing the whole gang back
to the lake cabin for some fun there.
(bouncy orchestral music)
The sounds from the game room tell me
there's something awesome
going on in there.
What in the world is going on out here?
- We're playing rock.
-  Rock? I don't know this game.
- It stopped.
- Yeah, we're just figuring out right now.
We've adapted it to
make it a little easier,
'cause it's slick in here.
- Yeah, so we're modifying it.
-  Keeping it safe?
Who all knew this game?
- My brother is, I
called Jeff, my brother,
and I'm like, hey, how do you play rock?
- Hi, the rest of the party arrives.
(bouncy guitar music)
So, the forecast for while
we're here shows rain
pretty much all day every day.
So, even though it's kind of drizzling,
we decided to venture
out and try the boats
because I absolutely love kayaking.
And kayaking right here on the lake,
oh, it's just gorgeous.
Jeremy's trying to get the
water out of this other kayak.
- There's just a little bit left.
-  Isaac's going out with me.
-  Do you want
me to give you a push?
- Yeah.
- Goodbye, my son.
(laughing)
-  There he is, oh my goodness.
-  There he is.
- So, we have to vlog my graceful entry.
-  Goodbye.
(laughing)
- Okay.
Oh, thanks, I do want my oar.
Are you comin' with me, buddy?
-  You wanna hop in the front?
-  Sure.
- You gotta go right into the very center
so we don't tip over.
Ready?
I'm loving seeing all these pretty houses
right along the water.
How's it goin'?
- Good.
- Stay close, okay, dude?
Caleb's helping me paddle.
(laughing)
Luckily, kayaks are
kind of hard to capsize.
I'm gettin' a little wet.
This is so beautiful.
I've never really been outdoors
up here in the Northwest.
And it is breathtaking.
I can't wait to come back.
We need to come in the summer time.
That would be amazing.
All right, Isaac, time to turn
around, it's Lisie's turn.
All right, Caleb, can you paddle us home?
- Yep.
- Good job, is it hard?
- Yep.
-  We're goin' in
a little bit of a circle.
- Okay.
- You're fixin' it, good job, buddy.
Lisie joined us, she's back
there learning how to kayak.
Come this way, Lisie.
She's gettin' the hang of it.
She pulled ahead of us.
Oh, I think we're gonna bump into you.
Ah, bumper boats.
(laughing)
Good save.
Poll question, have you been
to the Pacific Northwest?
My family is here and it's not raining,
so we're taking another
moment to get out on the lake.
We dried off the paddle boat.
So, some of the boys
are headin' out on that.
Look at that grin.
- This thing's pretty efficient, actually.
-  All right.
- My legs are tired, honestly.
- Yeah.
- Already.
- I think the kayak's might
have a slight edge on us.
(laughing)
- This is really tiring.
And you don't go very fast.
Like in the kayak, you can really move.
- The water sure is nice, but it's cold.
-  It is cold.
-  Are you sinking?
- I know I weigh a
little bit more than Sam,
so the water's coming in on my side.
-  We're thinking
maybe there's a plug
that we don't know about.
-  Yeah.
- Let's see what we can do.
Papa fixed the paddle boat.
He found the problem and we fixed it
as soon as we got it out of the water.
- There was a rubber gasket
problem that needed tightening.
-  And Papa saved the day.
- It had an interface issue.
(laughing)
-  Papa's the
next one headin' out.
Whoa, don't fall over.
- Whoa.
(screams)
(laughing)
- Whoa.
(screams)
(laughing)
-  Do you like
hanging out with Uncle Jimmy?
- Yeah.
(laughing)
-  Whoops-a-daisies.
Ooh, good shot.
They did a puzzle.
- When you land on that one.
-  Goodnight to yourself.
(singing)
- We're pulling up to the airport.
(crying)
(bouncy pop music)
(laughing)
