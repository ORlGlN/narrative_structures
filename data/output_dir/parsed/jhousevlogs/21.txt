- I'm so excited!
(lively music)
-  Happy birthday!
-  Whatcha doing?
- Sanding!
- Janea is running.
(upbeat music)
(playful music)
Miss Laura, what are we
having for breakfast?
- I don't know actually know the name.
-  It's called German pancakes.
- German pancakes.
-  How's breakfast?
-  Good!
-  What do you think, Laura?
- I like it, I want more after this.
(upbeat music)
- Well, it feels good
to be back in San Diego.
I was up early this morning,
flew out here for a YouTube conference.
- Good morning, so Jeremy is gone today,
but there is something else
really special about today,
and that is that it is
Janea's first birthday.
Oh my goodness!
I have been so emotional
with this day coming up,
like I'm just not ready for it.
She's grown up so fast,
and it's just been such a joy
to have her in our lives this year.
Like, I look back over the year,
and everything from that first moment
seeing her and holding her
to her first smiles and
her learning to crawl
and her learning to roll over
and her learning to walk,
and it's just been a really magical year,
and so I think it's kind of bittersweet
to see it coming to an end.
We're not celebrating her birthday today,
because Jeremy's not here,
and we want him to be able to be here
for that whole celebration,
but it's just kind of
fun to be thinking back
to what was going on a year ago today
and everything that's happened this year
and kind of snuggling her
extra close this morning.
It's your birthday!
- Oh uh!
-  Uh oh, she's like,
I don't know what that means,
but I'll keep playing. (laughs)
Look at that grin!
- Oop!
-  Up, yep, what's over there?
You'd better go find out.
Are you going on a ride?
- Uh huh!
-  She's loving it.
Lise, you're so nice with her.
- Turn around, shoom!
We're winning the race!
- So I'm at a conference called
Social Media Marketing World,
and it's a bunch of people in the industry
who are wanting to learn more about
how to use social media
in their businesses,
and specifically, I've
been asked to speak about
how brands and businesses
can work with influencers.
-  We're playing
Bingo in what language, Lisey?
- Spanish.
-  Ooh, Spanish!
- Espanol.
-  Who won the last round?
- Caleb.
(speaking foreign language)
-  Round two, doo do-doo do-doo!
(speaking foreign language)
-  I got it!
-  What does el ojo mean?
-  Eye.
(speaking foreign language)
-  Let's see what comes up next.
(speaking foreign language)
Laura, where is
(speaking foreign language)?
Good job, you got it!
(speaking foreign language)
So Lisey is helping out
and making lunch today!
- I really like it.
-  What are you making?
- Turkey sandwiches with Cheez-Its,
broccoli with ranch, and grapes.
-  Nice, it's a great lunch!
- Thank you, I'm making mine right now.
-  Well, thank
you, this is a big help.
(playful music)
- So Kendra's calling.
We're going to sing
Happy Birthday to Janea.
I'm so sad I'm missing her birthday today.
I'm sure Kendra has said this,
but we're gonna celebrate
it when I get back.
Hey!
Happy birthday!
I miss you!
Hey, I miss you too.
(kissing)
- Mwah!
-  Hey, buddy!
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
I can't believe you're one years old!
- Well, today's actually going really well
with school and the house and the kids.
I just haven't managed
to get out of my pajamas yet today.
This girl's ready for another nap,
and look, this is a new
outfit I just got her.
Here, show 'em what it says!
It says happy little one.
I love it!
Look at those tired eyes.
Oh, Janea, you're tired.
Let's go take a nap, okay?
She's like, "But walking
is so much more fun!"
Look at her walking around!
- On bellies, miss blankets,
and slings snugly tight.
- So in math today, Elise is
learning a whole new concept,
which is subtraction with renaming
or subtraction with borrowing,
whatever you like to call it,
and I've been a little bit
nervous to tackle this,
because it's a complex topic.
I remember being confused
by it when I was a kid,
but I love the way her
curriculum is presenting it,
and it's very hands-on.
There's a whole story that goes with it.
I'm enjoying it, what are you thinking?
- I like it.
-  Is it confusing?
- A little bit.
-  A little?
You're gonna get better and better at it.
So we've got 22 minus 13.
What do we start with?
(learning music)
- Hello, do you have any fours?
No?
But I really, really need a four!
Stay right here.
That one, that one.
-  Write it over on the side.
Draw what you did.
- Six.
-  Where did the 10 go?
What's 13 minus four?
- Nine.
And three.
39.
-  Good job, you got it!
That's her lipstick?
-  Mm-hmm.
-  That is some
good-looking lipstick.
Laura, I love how you wrote your name
in all different colors.
- Mm-hmm, this is you, Mommy,
the one that I just did
with the big mouth and lipstick.
- Oh, thanks!
- This is Daddy.
Smile.
-  It's so nice that you drew
a picture of Mommy and Daddy.
- And me!
-  I'm glad you're with us.
We like it when you're with us.
- I'm going on a date, but we're inside.
-  This is Laura and
Mom and Dad on Halloween.
Oh, that little one's Janea?
(soft music)
So I invited some friends over
for a play date this afternoon,
something to keep us busy and distract us
with Jeremy being out of town,
and I'm feeling a little
bit worried about that
at the moment, because I
still haven't had a chance
to get out of my pajamas today,
and my house is a little bit trashed,
but we still have an
hour, so there's time,
and they're good friends.
Like, I know they'll love us regardless,
but I really would like to try
to get this place cleaned up.
Caleb, what are you guys doing?
- We're just organizing
this drawer here (mumbles).
-  Deep cleaning
one of the disgusting
bathroom drawers, it was bad.
-  Yeah, it is bad.
-  But it's gonna get better.
Good plan organizing it, team.
This looks so much better.
It didn't take that long
to clean it, did it?
Good job, boys.
(sanding)
Whatcha doing?
- Sanding!
Feel it.
-  That looks so soft.
Oh my goodness.
You're an amazing sander.
- Thanks.
-  Caleb's really excited.
He got some composite wood scraps today.
- It never goes bad.
-  Never goes bad.
It never rots, huh?
He wants to build something with it.
- So right now, we are
heading to gymnastics,
and I'm really excited.
I've been getting really
good at my back bends,
and the coach, when he puts
his arm out, it's lighter,
so I basically do it all by myself.
-  Good job, Lisey!
- Today I'm so excited.
-  Laura, where is Daddy?
- At San Diego.
-  Have you
ever been to San Diego?
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
- With my whole family I have.
-  Yeah, did you
get to talk to Daddy today?
- Not that much, I miss him.
(yelling)
- Well, I'm over here
watching gymnastics tonight,
and I swear Janea is running.
She is so excited!
I haven't been able to
capture it on camera,
'cause I'm too busy watching her,
but it's like she went from
walking to really walking.
Oh, did you find the stairs?
(exploring music)
(squeals)
Do you feel stuck?
(babbles)
Yeah?
(squeals)
Happy birthday.
She's, like, all nervous or something.
(exploring music)
Look at her go, oh my goodness!
Well, Janea is going
crazy here at gymnastics,
running around and crawling
around and climbing around
and trying to get into everything,
and she found the bin of shoes,
and she was so excited!
I can't keep her out of everything, so.
Anyway, I'm grateful that
usually Jeremy's home
to help me with the, you
know, running around things,
and so she doesn't usually have to come.
Well, my kids are all in
bed, and I am so tired,
but it was a really good day.
I was really grateful,
because Isaac usually has violin lessons
at the very end of the evening,
and they got canceled today,
and so I just was glad to not have to
run anywhere else and to focus
on getting the kids to bed.
As I was tucking Laura into bed,
Isaac came and delivered me this note,
and it just warmed my heart.
Check this out.
It's a note from Elise and from Isaac
saying thank you.
I am now going to do super fun things
like clean the kitchen and go to bed.
Good night, J House out.
The sun is out, and it feels so good!
(upbeat music)
- First time on the chair lift.
-  You ready to go home?
- Yep.
