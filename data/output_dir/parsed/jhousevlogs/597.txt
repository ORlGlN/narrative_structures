I see evacuate the restaurant good
morning friends we are starting our day
off with pancakes and scrambled eggs
Jeremy was the egg scrambler
think he nailed it and I was on pancake
duty so there's the pancakes but I'm
taking pancakes it's perfect color
they're fluffy they're fluffy I added
water to a mix it was really intense
that um Isaac I'm taking him his first
two pancakes to start off and last time
he ate pancakes he 15 pancakes like the
kid just downs pancakes but growing up
my family ate pancakes on Sunday nights
for dinner a lot and it was like a
contest like every week to see who could
eat the most pancakes and anyway so in
your book you didn't he easily laid
three need you honey
really jam - I don't know what it is but
I'm not a pancake it's the money don't
you experience it we've got that an M
here we're gonna play more today so it's
gonna be a fun day so in our family it's
a major rule to keep the bathroom door
closed because of Laura this is
constantly how we find her if the door
is left open she comes in here climbs
into this part and then she gets all wet
you wanna wash your hands oh yeah what
was so okay you just combing your hair
over there buddy
good job big girl so laura has a similar
personality trait to Caleb that she
wants to be doing everything she sees me
doing and the older kids doing all on
her own and we want to encourage that
kind of independence we just want to
keep her alive
and love heart isn't it fun I give you
funny books on
yeah
at all that you daddy
you guys ready
again
all right we've decided to do a football
game with everybody and our first play
is super secret give the ball to Laura
and let her go you're gonna go keep
going keep going keep going
Emily you're letting this down
we scored with a pass from Elise to mom
well done and now it's the other teams
turn he's going he's running
get up cubby get up Gabi all right so
Matt is showing us a game that they
invented with these balls what did we
call this game haha Kayla you might want
to watch out
Isaac you might want to scoot away ooh
this is a game I is that while he pushes
it no that was in Dedham kook
Wow I think that they've been practicing
for the Olympics on this one for way
done and we captured it how you doing
dude nice nice form on that one are you
ready for a babysitter yes are you only
using one hand can you do no hands at
all dad like your neck that's why I put
the head whoa there he goes you'll see
him in the circus awesome alright well
we've got all the kids here and our
awesome babysitter Makayla she's my
niece if you're newer to her channel and
she watches the kid regularly for us and
she's great all right sweets date night
and we excited to come down to the plaza
and we are going to eat at this place
which it's a Brazilian steakhouse where
they bring it out and cut the meat on
we'll show you that's not really cheesy
like mr. Rogers like let's go inside
anyway there's music out here the
weather's gorgeous like this just makes
me so excited for spring
this is like a cheese bowl like the bowl
is made of cheese and there's a whole
bunch of Jesus
so I don't think I've ever seen Matt
this happy like he's living in it again
so they just keep coming around with
different kinds of meat and they are cut
it off and give it to you
even asked to evacuate the restaurant
because of a fire but we were right by
the door so the lady came running by and
opened the door and there's a fire
and there was going to be a fire free
free free room let's just go it's a no
take the napkin
we're being asked across the street so
they have had a restaurant that blew up
because a gas line leaked
so nothing that's what's going on
I can't believe that just happened well
I was able to return my napkin which was
important to me and I feel really bad
for the restaurant like it's definitely
closed for tonight so just to clarify we
did go up to the manager and talk to
them about how we just ate there and
they said not to worry about the bill
tonight because the restaurant wasn't
going to be opening up back again so we
are excited to not have to pay for
dinner but we didn't just eat and run
so the plaza is a really fun place with
live music and dancing so since we
weren't able to get dessert at the
restaurant
we're here at Dairy Queen on the drive
over here we were talking about other
times where we've been in situations
where the fireman had become a policeman
so let us know in the comments below if
there's a time where the firefighters
had to come in a place you were at so
this is really neat it's not a temple
they actually have like a lounging couch
set up here well I think we've had
enough excitement for the night so we're
going to end it here yeah
