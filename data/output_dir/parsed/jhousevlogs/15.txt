(laughing)
(bright music)
- Tyrannosaurus Rex's real tooth.
-  Laura, are
you gonna do some art?
-  Uh-huh!
(cheerful music)
- So we dropped Laura
off at an art preschool.
She was really excited about it.
And I'm taking the older kids
to the Museum of Prairiefire.
Kendra and I have wanted
to take the kids here
for a long time.
- That's dinosaur bones.
-  Is that real?
-  (excited laughter)
Thank you, sir.
There it is.
That's so cool.
So this screen shows us, and then it has
dinosaurs come through.
(chuckling)
(dinosaur roars)
Uh, you just got toasted.
- I got eaten by a T-Rex.
-  I hate when that happens.
- So Laura's at a preschool art program.
Jeremy has the big kids at a field trip,
and so I'm just home with Janae.
We've been enjoying our time together,
I've been getting a lot
done, but also trying
to force myself to not get very much done,
and just enjoy my time with Janae.
She's growing up so
fast, like I just want to
sit on the floor and play
with her, and read with her.
And it's been funny though,
because she's so confused.
She keeps, like, walking
up and down the hallways,
and looking into the room.
She's like, "Dada?"
She stands at the top of the
stairs and she screeches,
she's like (screeching),
is anybody down there?
So it's just kind of
funny, 'cause she's not
used to not having the big kids around.
- Hey, Dad, is this real bones?
-  I don't know,
let's read about it.
It's really the bones?
-  It's from
Big Dry Creek, Montana.
-  Wow.
- This is nearly the first
T-Rex bones put together.
-  Right here.
(rock music)
You discovered a fossil in Wyoming, Elise.
Ooh, it lets you pick
how you want it to look?
Elise did the head of hers.
Lisey?
What are you gonna name yours?
- Flapper.
-  Flapper?
- Or Flopster.
-  Flopster?
Caleb, Jr.?
Well, the dinosaurs that
we made are showing up
in the great hall to play with us.
- That's mine.
-  There's yours, Flopster!
-  Flopster, come here!
-  Lisey, you've made it!
(chuckles)
Here comes Nice, this one's mine.
Caleb, Jr.
- It bit him.
-  Did he eat you?
- Yeah.
- All in to the Discovery Room.
- You see all those circles?
-  Mm-hmm.
- That's where earthquakes happen.
Do you see the red ones
up here, like that one?
If we touch it, that happened this morning
up in the Gulf of Alaska.
See that one there
happened on March the 6th
over in Puerto Rico.
- Oh, wow.
-  So you can look
up all of the earthquakes.
- Yup, so if you look
at all these purples,
you can see that's called,
this here is called
the ring of fire, because that's where
a lot of earthquakes happen.
-  Whoa.
-  You see this type of rock?
It's a mineral, okay?
You can't see through that.
But look, if I put it down that way,
you can see right through it!
-  Transparent rocks.
- Whoa, this one.
-  We're allowed
to touch everything.
-  Oh, that is a
really big one, right?
And that's how geologists and things
can identify what it's made out of.
Look at this rock here, real close.
Look at it real, real close.
What do you think it's made out of?
-  Sparkles?
-  Hmm, have you ever had a penny?
-  Yeah.
-  That's what
penny gets made out of.
That's a copper ore.
-  It's copper.
-  Feel this.
-  What is it?
-  It's a rock.
-  Smell that one, it stinks.
-  Is that a stinky rock?
-  That has a lot of sulfate in it,
so that's why it's smelly.
- It's fun that they have it set up here
where the kids are supposed
to open every drawer
and play with everything
inside, I love that.
-  We brought
the laundry hamper over.
Now things are getting interesting.
Good one!
Oh yeah!
(laughing)
It's lunch time.
How's your strawberry?
Pretty good?
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
More? More?
I'm feeding Janae these
tiny bites of ice cream
after she's finished her squash
and black beans and strawberries.
Mmm.
Say more.
(gasps) Good job!
-  Those are skins.
-  That's an African civet.
(pleasant music)
(Caleb laughs)
-  They seem really distractable.
Look like they're paying attention.
- Found the woodpecker.
-  Oh, there's the.
You guys gotta try to find the animals,
you might need your binoculars.
Did you guys see the racoon?
All right, so they're
all looking for the bee,
don't give them any hints.
(Guide laughs)
- Found it.
-  I found it!
-  You guys found it?
-  It's inside of that hole.
-  Oh, that's tricky.
- This is a Tyrannosaurus
Rex's real tooth.
-  T-Rex tooth?
-  Can I hold it?
-  It doesn't feel that sharp.
-  It's supposed to be white.
-  Imagine, though,
if it was crushing down
at you with 1,000 pounds of a bite.
So is this a puzzle?
-  Right.
-  Bathroom break.
When you look left and
right, it'll be like
you're looking left and right.
Elise, you ready to try virtual reality?
No response. (softly chuckles)
So remember, you are
just sitting on a chair
in a room, and so at any
time, you can take it off.
Thumbs up if you hear something.
It's just like a ride, kind of.
Isaac, what do you think of that?
-  Whoa.
-  Whoa.
Spin slowly.
- I liked it.
-  You got to
see a volcano blow up.
-  I loved it.
It was awesome.
-  We were the
first people to watch it.
- It felt like I was upside down.
-  You'll see, if you
stand back and look at it,
you'll see the outline of a lion.
A shooting star is really a nickname
for something that is called a meteorite.
So you're gonna get to hold something
that came from outer space.
- So the kids are getting
to hold a meteorite.
This is Apollo 13.
So they flew up to go to the moon,
and then their rocket
kind of had an explosion,
and oxygen was leaking.
And they had to try
and get them back home.
-  Did they get here?
-  Yep, they survived.
They made it back.
So we ordered our pizza,
but we wanted to check out
this toy store right next door.
(energetic music)
Look at this robotic arm, you guys.
Code Gamer, you can actually build games.
So this toy store is focused
on, like, educational stuff.
That's just K'Nex, right?
-  How'd they make it just like go?
Oh they have a wire.
-  Plugged in.
- Pesto?
-  Yep. We just
gotta make sure to save some
for Mom, okay, you guys?
And we have another pizza coming.
- 'Kay.
- Hot.
-  Yeah, it just
came out of an oven.
It's gonna be hard to bite
pizza without any teeth.
- Yeah.
-  So Kendra was
saying that Grimaldi's
is like a famous pizza place,
Brooklyn style type pizza.
It's really, really good.
You can tell that they use
the real mozzarella cheese.
It's yummy.
What do you guys think?
- It's good.
-  You're trying so hard to eat!
-  It's amazing.
-  You gotta like--
-  I just eat from my sides.
-  Eat it on the side?
Good job.
I just like walked
away, and left the pizza
sitting on top of, in a
box that was ready to go,
like, it was all set.
And I just forgot.
So I'm mourning the loss of the pizza.
Kendra, like, really wanted to try it,
so we'll have to back there sometime
and have some more yummy pizza.
So Laura, how was your time
this morning doing art?
-  Good.
-  You cleaning up the noodles?
- Can you hold this for
me while I sweep it up?
-  Sure.
So what did you make today?
- I did paint.
-  You painted?
Can I see it?
- And I got this.
-  Ooh.
- I made it.
Purple, pink, blue, blue.
-  Hey!
- Somebody took a good nap.
- We missed you this morning.
I have been super forgetful today.
I left the pizza at the restaurant,
and then we were gonna do tacos tonight,
but I forgot to get out the
taco meat to defrost it.
So as a result of my absent-mindedness,
we have picked up some
Panda Express for dinner.
-  Which is a pretty good result.
The kids are all pretty happy with it.
- That's true.
Maybe I should lose my mind some more.
Who wants Panda Express?
-  Me!
Goodnight!
J House out.
(laughter)
- Goodnight, J House out.
-  Gonna make a cake?
-  Mm-hmm.
There's soap all over us!
- This is so yummy, I'm having so much fun
tasting all the things!
