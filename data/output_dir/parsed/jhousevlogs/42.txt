- What do you think the moon feels like?
Ready to head the the ocean, Zac?
(electronic music)
-  You can do it, Nay-nay.
- So what do you think,
was that our first step?
(electronic music)
- Good morning.
-  What time is it?
- Breakfast.
-  This morning we're having
yogurt and granola with some apples.
It's a new kind of granola
we haven't tried before: maple pecan.
It's delicious.
I taste tested it.
- I'm sore from riding the bike.
-  From riding yesterday?
We rode far, that was
six and a half miles.
- I'm sore too.
-  So what did you think
of the bike ride yesterday?
- My butt did not hurt at all
but I really wanted to go on the bike.
-  Yeah, you were
in the bike carrier, huh?
- Mama.
-  Mama.
-  Who did your hair today?
- Me.
I put gel, made it kind of
crazy with the gel, the water,
and then I comb it to the
side and then bring it up.
- I'm really proud of you,
I'm sure glad I don't have
to do you hair anymore.
Looks great.
On another note, I'm having
kind of a bad beard day today.
It's a thing, sometimes the
beard just doesn't work.
(energetic piano music)
- This is beautiful.
So for church today, we decided to
come worship at the oldest
church here in California
which is the mission in San Diego.
(church bell ringing)
- Nay-Nay?
Hey.
(energetic piano music)
I really enjoyed mass.
It was fun to do that
with our whole family.
- Our family is not Catholic,
but I have good memories of
going to mass with my grandma.
Just a few times when I was a little girl.
Those memories and being
here at the mission,
which is the oldest
church here in San Diego,
it's just a really special
morning to spend with our family.
I really want to raise my children
to respect and honor all religion.

-  Grillin'
some hot dogs for lunch.
So what are you guys watching?
-  Jared wrestling.
-  How cool.
That's my half-brother Jared.
- He's giving me the same
move he did last time.
That was so much fun.
-  We are sad we're
saying goodbye to Poppy Rod.
- Goodbye buddy, I love you
Good seein' ya.
- Yeah, thanks for comin'.
- Bye, bye!
- So, Genae is getting so close
to taking her first steps.
I keep getting nervous
that I'm gonna miss it.
Jeremy and I are going
to her practice walking
between us right now and see
if she'll take her first steps.
-  You can do it, Nay-nay.
(laughing)
(cheering)
(cheering)
- You got it, you ready?
Come to Mama.
- That was so close.
- Oh, that was close.
- Come to Mama?
Come on.
- Oh, she's taking off.
(cheering)
So what do you think,
was that our first step?
We're gonna do a poll,
was that her first step?
-  She loves this little spot.
(baby babbles)
- Hi.
-  You have to get
those little feet walking.
- Walk to Daddy.
Oh, so close.
I'm going to have to wait
and see the replay as well,
but I don't think that
was her first steps.
I think she got really, really close,
but I think we're still waiting.
- She does great holding my fingers.
- I remember when Laura
took her first step.
-  I do too, that was fun, huh?
- Yeah.
(laughing and cheering)
(light electronic music)
- So we came to a fun
part of San Diego today,
it's called Mission Beach,
and there's a thin long peninsula of land
that has the bay on one side of it
and the ocean on the other.
So we're at a bay park first
so we can experience that
and then we're gonna
walk over to the ocean
and kind of see the difference.
(light electronic music)
- This sand right here is so soft
it feels like what I would kind
of imagine the moon
feeling like, it's nice.
- I never imagined what
the moon feels like.
Personally, if I've
ever pictured the moon,
it felt more rocky and
definitely less wet.
This is a pretty wet sand.
What do you think the moon feels like?
- It always looked like
kind of a baby powder.
- So it's interesting how the bay beach
and the ocean beach are so different.
-  One has waves and one doesn't?
- You guys want to walk
over and see the ocean?
- How will we do that?
-  It's right there.
- Over there?
-  Yup.
- Ready to head to the ocean side?
(light electronic music)
So from right here you can see the ocean.
It's hard to see, but you
can see it, and the bay.
- On our way to the ocean
there was another park
that our kids wanted to go play at.
- Why not?
- Riding on my horsie,
riding on my horsie.
(light electronic music)
- Because it's such a beautiful day,
it is really busy out here but that's
kind of a fun part of the atmosphere.
I'm sure it's way more
busy here in the summer,
but for January this has been
the busiest we've seen it.
(reggae music)
So after spending some time at the beach,
we decided that I would
go back and get the car
and pick everybody up.
I got all the way to the car
before Kendra and I realized
that she had the keys and I didn't.
So, we're dealing with that.
There they are.
Do you have the keys?
- No I don't.
-  I thought it'd be
better if we all go to the car.
- I agree.
- Yeah.
- Let's do that.
- Let's do that.
(soft guitar music)
- I'm getting dinner
ready, we're keeping it
really simple tonight with
just some frozen lasagna.
I couldn't decide what type to get,
and because our family is big enough
that we actually eat a lot of food,
I got several different ones to try.
Let me show you.
I got this one, this one, and this one.
You gotta cook 'em.
- What are these?
-  It's lasagna.
- Can I look at 'em?
- Nope, they're still
frozen, we're gonna cook 'em.
So we're ending off the night
with a family movie night,
we're watching this movie.
It's an IMAX about the ocean.
We've got lasagna,
broccoli, and bread sticks.
- And hungry children.
-  And a hungry daddy.
- Thumbs up, thumbs down.
If you don't like it, that's fine.
And if you do, you can't eat it.
- Hey!
(soft acoustic country music)
-  Good night.
J House out.
- It's too fun up here,
everybody has to join.
(upbeat music)
-  So that was all
found inside of a bird.
That's so cool!
(upbeat music)
