- If you watch family vlogs
then I'm sure that you've heard
of the candy "Hi Chew."
I was giving my kids some
today out of the cupboard
and there was this lone
chocolate chip that was
laying around in the cupboard.
And so as I was eating
my Hi Chew, I grabbed the
chocolate chip and was eating
it at the same time and,
it was really good.
And then I had the idea
like, well why don't I try to
melt some chocolate and do
chocolate-covered Hi Chews?
So I just stirred some chocolate
chips in a cup, melted it,
and threw the Hi Chews in
there and stirred them around
and, uh, voila.
Chocolate-covered Hi Chews.
And it's really good.
Kids, you want to try some?
- Yeah!
- They're pretty excited about this.
(fast playful music)
- And so I am heading to
a board meeting for our
local chamber of commerce.
Our chamber of commerce
here is really cool.
They do big activities through the year
for the whole community,
like a huge parade and a
fall festival and a July 4th event.
They give out scholarships.
I, uh, I'm not sure if I'm
gonna show you any footage
in the actual meeting, we'll see.
(woman mumbling)
(meeting chatter)
We had a really great meeting.
It was exciting to rub shoulders
with some great people, you know,
there was a representative
there from our local
school district and from
the hospital and just a lot
of really neat business
owners there and as you bring
all those minds together and
their experience, it's neat
to hear the discussions that happen.
It's just fun to be a part of it.
- So we're continuing
our study of Texas today.
We're actually going to
be studying all the states
that we're driving through on
our trip to Arizona and then
we're gonna be studying
Arizona when we're in Arizona.
So I'm really excited about that.
But we're just starting
with Texas, so tonight
we're having a Texas dinner.
We read that their state food
is chili, so we're having
some chili, their state
tree is the pecan tree,
so we're having some pecans,
and their state fruit
is grapefruit, so we're
having some grapefruit.
What do you guys think of pecans?
- Yummy!
- Yummy.
-  Yeah Caleb wasn't sure
at first, he wouldn't try 'em
but now, what do you think?
- Good.
- They're good?
And you?
- I, I love them so much
that I ate too much that now
my tummy's kind of hurting.
- Uh oh, you ready for some grapefruit?
Let's see Leesie take her first bite.
- Wow, it's really good.
- What does it taste like?
- It's a little sour,
it tastes like lemon.
- Ah...
It kind of tastes like lemon
but a little bit more spicy,
and kinda more juicy.
-  Hmmm.
- And a kinda more like..
Strawberry-flavored.
-  Strawberry-flavored
lemons, awesome.
Okay Caleb, you ready?
Let's see what Caleb thinks.
- Good.
-  (laughs)
Do you like it?
Oh no, don't choke.
-  Do you like it?
- We're braiding.
-  Braiding, braiding what?
- It's my first time doing it.
- We're making a friendship bracelet.
- Yep.
-  Oh, cool.
-  So, she's been wanting
to have some time to do this,
and we're working on it.
- And it's (mumbles)
- So we're getting some
special time together.
- And we're, and it's making a braid.
- It is making a braid.
-  (mumbles).
- We are stirring up the chili.
- Hopefully it doesn't fly off.
Our city has a cool Christmas
tree drop-off place.
They recycle the Christmas
trees and then use the mulch
for the city walkways and parks.
Kinda cool.
Christmas is officially over.
- (Kids screaming)
(Kids screaming)
(Kids screaming)
- (Mumbles)...last time.
- Gee that means I have
to kill all of you.
- (Mumbles)
- (Mom makes shooting sounds)
