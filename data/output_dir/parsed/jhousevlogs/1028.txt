- So we're in the room and Kendra said.
- Uh oh, my internal
Caleb meter went off, run!
- Yeah, we have an uh-oh meter, like,
"Oh we've been talking
for three minutes together
"and we don't know where Caleb is."
I can hear him, let's see.
Buddy, what are you doing?
- I'm making some paint.
-  You're making paint?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Putting some soap in toothpaste.
-  You cleaning
up the counters in here?
- Yeah.
-  I'm just glad
that the toothbrushes
are all on the counter.
Do you wanna come do something else now?
- No.
But I'm still painting.
-  Do you need to
help us clean up the paint?
- No.
(cheerful music)
-  Caleb, what happened?
- I wanted to say goodbye to daddy.
-  You wanted
to say goodbye to daddy?
- Yeah.
- Jeremy was leaving for
work and Caleb was standing
in the window waving
and jumping and smiling
and screaming, "Dad, Dad, bye Dad!"
And Jeremy was driving away and in his car
and didn't hear him and so
Caleb was a little crushed.
So now he has the best daddy in the world,
who just came back, who just came back
from the end of the street to
wave goodbye to his kiddos.
-  I love you, buddy!
- Bye.
- Bye.
-  You guys have
a good day, alright?
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- Good to see you.
- Say, "Bye, Dad!"
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
-  Love you.
-  See you at the pumpkin patch!
-  See you at the pumpkin patch!
-  Wave your hands real big!
-  Bye, see you
at the pumpkin patch.
- So we're on our way to the pumpkin patch
and we were just at a
stoplight and as we were parked
at the stoplight, an ambulance
and a firetruck and everybody
came by with their sirens on
and we tried to pull over,
but it's really hard when
you're at a stoplight.
Anyway, every time that
happens, I get emotional
and I cry every time I see
sirens or hear sirens, I cry.
- And I make fun of her every time.
- I don't know why, but I
do remember the first time
it happened and the first time it happened
was when I was pregnant
with Caleb and I was driving
somewhere with Isaac and
Elise and the same situation
happened where the sirens
came by and we pulled over
and Isaac asked, "Mom,
why do we pull over?"
And I started explaining, and I was like,
"Well, Isaac" and I got
all emotional, I was like,
"We're a community and we love each other
"and we care about each
other and these ambulance,
"they're going to somebody
who needs them, and they need
"them fast and so we all
have to get out of the way
"so that they can get
to where they need to go
"because we care about each other."
And I started crying and
of course, I was pregnant
at the time, so I had a great excuse.
- We blamed it on the pregnancy, but now
there's no pregnancy, well wait a minute,
is this a pregnancy announcement?
- No, so every time now I
see them and I pull over,
I just remember that experience
and I get overwhelmed
with emotions of, I don't know,
what would you call those emotions?
- Emotional?
- Craziness, maybe?
- No, is it empathy or gratitude
for the community, part of it?
- It's this feeling of
caring about the people
they're headed to and
just wanting to make sure
they're gonna be okay and so happy
that our whole community
follows the rules and, anyway,
I'm gonna turn this off
before I start crying again.
I really like ambulances.
It's free to get into
the pumpkin patch today
and it's because we're bringing
donations for harvesters.
(gentle music)
-  Thanks so much.
-  There you go,
put 'em in there, guys.
(laughs)
- Whoa, you got it out of your hand!
(cheering)
(laughs)
- On a hay ride.
- Yeah.
This is fun!
-  Did you find a pumpkin?
You like it?
- Can you hold it?
- Is it heavy?
- Is it too heavy?
- So I'm watching the World Series,
and it's looking much better tonight.
We're in the bottom of the
sixth inning, it's three to two,
we have runners on second and
third, Perez is up to bat.
This is a big deal.
Oh, base hit, base hit!
Boom, that's two more runs!
(laughs)
He's gonna get to second,
too, it'll be a double,
so we can score again or I
think we only have one out.
Alright, I think we're gonna win this one.
Five to two, Royals!
(gentle music)
