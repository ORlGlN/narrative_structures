we did it good job guys hey guys and
welcome to the first ever wasabi
2016 Black Friday Paul I didn't know
this was the thing
they make us on YouTube until my
girlfriend informed me that a lot of
people do it I thought while she's
shopping
I'll go shop for my stuff and I'll make
my own video but doper so let's get
started this year after Thanksgiving I
went to the mall and I purchased socks
socks are very necessary because my feet
stay cold all day all the time forever
and always so you always need a good
pair of socks something else that's just
as important is Christmas underwear if
you don't have Christmas underwear then
you're doing it wrong
hey next most hauls are mostly just
closed I didn't really get close but I
guess this one kind of counts us as
clothing cuz you'll hear it now these
candles are really cool because I saw
them on the shelf and they start white
and they burn down to different layers
of colors so it starts dripping red blue
green yellow go as you can see most of
these things are random and they were
colorful packaging and that's why they
were bought handy corn I'm just a
unicorn walking around a room and oh
