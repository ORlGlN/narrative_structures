I pick up you one Hey Oh
my sleep schedule is so bad I'm gonna
sleep at three after day in the morning
watching up at 11 a.m. I'm trying to
fall asleep around like midnight now and
get a bit like eight that's hard to push
my schedule around and I'm just I mean I
got bun bun in my room now the reason we
got bun bun in my room is because
something happened Erin came home one
day they called me and he was like oh my
gosh somebody bit bun bun or I'm like
why do we what Letty went away but we
were really confused because how could
she be bitten if she's in the cage and
nobody else is in there
so we're keeping her in my room for
right now because we heard that they're
easily frightened so maybe she got
frightened maybe guppy accidentally
scared her maybe chichi accidentally
scared her we don't know so we're going
to keep her in here for a while in the
quiet calm she's in her little wheel
right now well come on say hi oh my gosh
it got worse wonder what did you do are
you biting yourself okay we're going to
a hospital come on here to use it
this isn't normal okay welcome to the
end of vlog talk I'm going to keep this
short because I have to take bun-bun to
the hospital because she's bleeding
again I don't know what's going on I'm
freaking out we've never had a pet do
this we I just I just called like five
different hospitals and vets and they
don't take chinchillas they won't look
at your child because they're exotic
animals apparently so I finally got
ahold of one it's a small animal exotic
hospital so we're going over there right
now I really have no idea what's going
on but don't worry guys I'm sure she's
going to be okay I'll keep you updated
in tomorrow's vlog but for right now
I'll see you guys tomorrow and until
then do me a favor and don't forget to
remember if you're not
you're doing it wrong okay bye
Oh
