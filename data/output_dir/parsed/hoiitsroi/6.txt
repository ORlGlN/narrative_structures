and I got a massage we had some
masseuses come to the house and give us
a massage and I don't like being all
oily and stuff so I said hey do you
happen to have lotion and they said yes
we can use lotion instead because once
your oily from a massage you have to go
take a shower and it's annoying so I
like just lotion me up I'll get
moisturized and I'll get a nice massage
it'll be great but apparently they use
dog treat scented lotion because this
