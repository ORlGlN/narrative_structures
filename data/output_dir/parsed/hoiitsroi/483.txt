guests we a special guest we have riot
this we're going to do different tasks
and we're gonna see who can do a cuter
or uglier mmm that's all you need to
know let's get it started
we're definitely other side yep so I
feel like because it's appropriate the
first challenge should be plugging in a
lamb hmm that makes sense because lambs
are cool yeah
that's the only reason Tsukiko all right
action
judges this I don't have to say that
really we want a team effort
we need synergy from both of you we
can't just have one person be cute we
needed people here to be honest
yes we give a 2 and a 3 so you guys have
5 points total for this round
scene ugly yeah the main thing is that
you have to do the scene
we then ugly you can't just shove
something in a booty hole all right you
give you both a 2 and a 2 so the first
round goes to Ryan and Greg Timmy gay
what ends so round 2 is mowing the lawn

all right we both gave you a 4 4 foot it
we feel like you guys really really set
the butt-ugly

great you guys completed the task I just
I really want to see not just Greg beam
I wanted to see a little bit of Ryan
Ryan being overly - yeah yeah I think
MIT so so fun we gave you guys a four
and a 4.5 yeah excellent they actually
mowed the lawn dawg they did mow the
lawn you guys have been doing an amazing
job so far the next action is riding a
horse riding a horse now team he goes up

five why's it have you now so good so
cool
alright so because this is the final
round maker we're gonna have a crazy
typewriter with layering so we're gonna
start off with something simple such as
riding a bicycle and as you're going
through the scene we're gonna throw and
stuff and you have to add on flour
remaining either cute or ugly physically
throw stuff or work more like a scenario
yeah all right all right
the basis for this one is going to be
fishing okay all right oh you want you
guys to do ugly ugly ugly you guys are
born to be ugly
we are born Popeye
ha ha jumping out of a plane
your parachute doesn't work
you guys you guys you guys lag out up on
an inflatable bouncy castle at a
birthday party the fish started to talk
and walk and walk it was so ugly
hey so ugly the commitment was there
they went through I went tire admitted I
mean the way Greg flopped onto the
ground was midnight exactly so the score
we decided to give you was four and four
point five oh nice score it could have
been better had you continued fishing
while falling out of the plane yeah
action

fishing should be interesting alright

fantastic yeah but in the middle when
you became a rock band it wasn't cute
