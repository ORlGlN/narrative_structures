my face is getting chub chubs my tummy
is getting tub tubs and my butt didn't
love them nice - looking good but good
but everything else is getting out of
hand
and it's because of things like this I
order too many desserts why do you do

fat why can't you be healthy why why so
I've made a decision and I'm sticking to
it
no more desserts breakfast lunch dinner

with it oh good I might eat some candy
every once a while but with my meals
no more desserts because usually the end
of my meals I'm super full but I have
such a sweet tooth that I get a dessert

create this pipe but after that I'm
