and here's a little montage to show
just wanna be
same old thing the same a theme keeps me

I feel like I'm doing a really good job
of standing out of the Sun on this rest
Ned Ned what did I tell you I told you
never come back but you're back
you're lucky let's take a picture you I
would kick your butt out of here okay
Ned calm calm come on we let you poop
here sometimes cooperate with us Domino
oh he pooped stay stay stay
okay you can sing just don't fly oh
don't you do it Ned you look at kind of
cute today Ned I'm not gonna lie mr. a
where are you I know you're around here
somewhere
waiting to jump out in the middle of the
night
we are currently out here because you
guys want us to jump in this water and I
went inside to grab my vlog hammer I
said be right back just in case some
crazy fish jumps up and lauren says
maybe 20 feet in front of us huge I am
fair I saw one too but it didn't go that
high there's lights under our houses so
it attracts bugs then the big fish go
under it and get the bugs and they jump
out of the water get the bugs okay let's
throw some bread out there just to see
what we're dealing with
throw some bread right here so you guys
can see cuz you can't see out there yeah
you're gonna get eaten girl you would
put your feet way toes look like minnows
okay oh oh he's fast oh there's another
one over there he's coming why are you
guys not asleep you have to school
tomorrow all those three there's three
four whose idea was it throw a whole
loaf of bread in right before you jump
in oh yeah that's not a good idea
I want to test something out on a splash
of water and see if they are attracted
to it or if they get scared away from it
because if we simply scared you think
I'll be here hold this
you big if you splash yeah definitely
what do they think I'm a big loaf of
bread you do are big loaf of bread
there's 10 no 10 right there no I'm not
yes I see one 20 was 20 good job you
distracted every single fish in the
ocean you see them on the camera yeah I
could zoom on the camera who's 20 at
least got the smallest little fishies
let me fast care to these guys I'm
scared of their friends this might be
our last vlog ever but we're gonna do
this we're gonna do this we just had an
incident all 20 the fish started flying
through the air I think they're like
jumping fish and it was like like flying
across the water but my theory is that a
bigger fish came and they got scared of
the bread 50 not even exaggerating yeah
good job you tried it every single fish
in the ocean to our dock right before we
swim in it congratulations we just have
to get in and get out oh my glider look
at all of them why are they just sitting
there - that's what's freaky
they're waiting they know we're gonna
jump in they watch the vlogs can you and
your friends please go away we need to
jump in this water real quick and touch
you Oh touched it he didn't move I did
touch it what oh I touched some boat
what they don't care they don't care
this is the end of Lawrence this is how
we we our story ends right here can we
try to like figure out what kind of
fishies are I just looked up these
species of fish and we cannot get in
their face or needlefish and they have
teeth and they can bite and their people
have been attacked by them I looked at
needlefish and what popped up on Google
was needlefish attacks and look what
else we found two giant jellyfish right
there I've never seen a jellyfish before
those are cute look how long the
tentacles are really outside the
aquarium I've never seen a jellyfish
did you realize that this is exactly
where you'd be jumping right now these
are definitely a needle this long
slender bodies and they have needle
mouths and they have serrated
teeth in their mouths they're also
called garfish yeah knocking into these
guys what and I put my feet in there I'm
sweating
we almost jumped to her death we did
these guys are vicious apparently
there's at least a hundred surrounding
us now okay guys we would love to hang
out with you all night long but it's
time for the end of vlog talk everybody
misses bear bear we were 100% about to
jump off the deck that's why we went out
there we're gonna jump we're checking or
using our flashlights just check if
there's any fish around I really didn't
wash my hair in preparation to jump off
tonight so I could wash it after we were
gonna jump in even after seeing all
those fish I was like I'm still gonna
jump in and then while I was searching
what species fishes were we saw to use
jellyfish it's just fish decided to come
to the party and we're definitely not
jumping with jellyfish but they said
that though jellyfish and stingrays
stingrays yeah search on YouTube
needlefish attack you'll see this guy
got bit by one needle fish in the face
and he has this big like gash in his
forehead that would have been us times a
hundred I'm honestly scared to go in in
the daytime after seeing all that maybe
it'll eat all the friend they'll be gone
hopefully some people might say I threw
the bread in there so I would attract
fish so that I didn't have to jump in
but I didn't know dangerous fish would
have came by and even if that I didn't
throw the bread in that means they were
nearby
so sorry about it but we're not getting
in the night time see you guys tomorrow
for some more Bora Bora adventures and
until then don't forget to remember that
bear bears can fly especially in the
ceiling fans and if you're not smiling
you're doing it wrong
okay bye
