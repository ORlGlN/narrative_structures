it's that time of year again time for
the holidays love is in the air presents
cuddling weather mistletoe make sure you
spend it with someone special not no
scrub I don't want no scrub here's how
to tell if it's love a gentleman always
keeps his girl warm really cold out here

he will always write songs for her I
like your face I like your hair I know
when I star you down I don't care
we should get married we make it good we
should I can't create
he names everything he likes about her I
like your eyes I like your hair I like
your teeth
I like your scoliosis
I like your multiple personality
syndrome
I like your muscles true love never
leaves his girl's side hmm I think i'ma
go take a shower

the seconds till you return
