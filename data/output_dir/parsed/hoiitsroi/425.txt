a video but everybody's late Lauren's
getting her hair done and she's not even
in it she's not part of it she just
wants to watch it go down because it's
gonna be dope they're gonna be here a
little bit so I thought me and Kyle
would do a little experiment what I
didn't know you're a baller shot caller
follow shot caller um for your amusement
and my knowledge seeking urges we are
about to put some soap in the microwave
there's a bunch of videos online of
people putting soap in the microwave and
there's a really cool reaction and I got
a seat for myself I don't believe it
now Kyle if you want this to work you
have to use ivory soap why I breathe
I'll tell you I'm glad you asked and
ivory soap there are little air bubbles
all up in the soap like chillin they're
like yo what it is would it be what a
dude oh those air bubbles expand and it
does something and it like it breaks the
soap but it does something it's gonna
explode anything that yeah it's like
what everything does in the money that's
why this is your second year in my class
Kyle it's not going to explode is it
gonna melt easy melt and technically I
think it's gonna melt at first using it
that right I think it's gonna explode
that's my first guys six-foot let's see
what happens why so many you do one
first this packaging is delightful yes
isn't it yeah it almost makes me want to
bathe
one minute and so it begins
I wasn't so cool if I could see that
where the star marry up this is take a
full minute I don't know how long it
takes
what's a doing it's not Oh what is it
growing ah yeah I don't know it's
expanse of all those bubbles are
expanding its turning it into a foam
it smells good too I want to be in there
I wish
now they've done you there oh they're
good you're gonna put all of them in
there no we are gonna put all of them in
there it's gonna be breezy what oh gosh
touch it
it didn't you all know that that is
crazy this is one bar of soap oh now
it's hot we had to take a little break
from the silk experiment because it's 9
feet chichi that's a fact
yeah you're in the food spot ha ha ha
Judy's a funny legume now back to your
regularly scheduled programming there
you have it folks the ivory tower
come on what's happening to the bottom
100 they're not all gonna explode he'll
think so
that'll be insane something cooler
ah it's now spinning its own guys carry
on uh I was like everything's blue feel
this so is good oh I can make it so
again so that's what happens I guess you
had to put it in there longer oh my gosh
shoot put in longer yeah haha experiment
over oh my god I kind of love ready
no yeah well do you want this yeah I
need to pack some of this up okay I need
to take it home it's a pretty shirt
pocket okay yeah okay
okay go thank you
oh oh it's real likes so it's so warm
feeling of my life warm soap in the
shower would be amazing but it wouldn't
last it'd break apart I know but what if
they put some kind of chemical to keep
it warm
well then you just came up with the idea
but that is hot oh my gosh nobody burst
if I see my idea on Shark Tank I'm gonna
be so upset yes Oh is it hot whoa
