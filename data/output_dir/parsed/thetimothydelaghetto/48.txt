this is not clickbait this is a real
thing
I don't even clickbait oh y'all I'm
talking about but this is the vlog where
I get the ring obviously I can't live
blog that I can't put it up as I'm doing
it so I you know this is this is footage
from what month are we in this is May we
are in the beginning of May and this is
what I'm getting the ring and what you
may not know is um I've been looking at
rings and discussing details of the
Rings with the jeweler for four months
now and what you also may not know is
like I want to say almost even two years
ago Chea came to LA with her friend Ida
I'm not sure what vlog it is but they
were in town and she was like hey babe
I'm gonna go get my nails done at this
spot in LA can I take your car and I'll
make sure baby do you think they went to
LA and then that night she was like okay
babe I have a confession to make I'm
like what's good she's like okay I
didn't go get my nails done what I
actually did was there's a jeweler that
I saw online in Beverly Hills that I
really liked and I set up an appointment
to go talk to them and she's like no
pressure but whenever you're ready you
know they have my details they have your
details they know who you are I just
kind of discussed what kind of rings I
like what Styles I like what cut I like
so whenever you're ready babe you can go
in there tell them your name they know
about us and then you can kind of choose
from there from the information that
they have and you can and you can pick a
ring out and that's and maybe like a few
months ago earlier this year is when I
started setting up meetings with them
and yeah you know they have all the
information they were basically
expecting me even though like it's been
at least a year maybe even two years
that she came to LA to
set up that appointment about the Rings
but even before that you know she would
be leaving me she's like she would leave
me little pictures of the type of
she likes or send me little pictures of
the type of ring she likes you know she
knows what she likes you know
Sam and some people might think that's
kind of a weird experience like the
isn't the guy just supposed to go ring
shopping and pick some that he
hopes his chick will like but she's not
stupid um she knows what she likes and
I'm not mad at that like if I'm gonna be
spending this type of money on something
she better like this you know she
made this hell of a lot easier for
me this whole process is been mad smooth
so I'm not mad at all now I'm just going
to walk up in there pick this up
and yeah yeah so royal penis is clean
your highness Thank You King
