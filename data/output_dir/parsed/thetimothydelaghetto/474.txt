DeLaGhetto right yeah man now I know
that I'm gonna get a lot of comments
from people saying why are there so many
Asians why is it only Asian performers
well here's the thing concerts like I
say is basically the Asian community
stepping up and saying look we've built
our own audience we've built our own
buzz independently we found our way to
make ourselves known make ourselves
heard and we're making money now you
know I'm saying we are a bankable
product although the mainstream media
wants to shut us out of radio of TV you
know I'm saying like we are real we are
talented we are real we are filling
stadiums we are making money and like
look man we don't need the mainstream we
don't need the help of the Whitey's
although I love you white people but I'm
just saying this is us doing it on our
own because no one wants to help us out
this is why you see agent shows put on
by Asian people filled with Asian crowds
because no one's always loved so we show
love and we're doing it this is our time
to shine this is our time this is our
time this is our time
Asian people word the Royal penis is
clean your highness Thank You King shit
