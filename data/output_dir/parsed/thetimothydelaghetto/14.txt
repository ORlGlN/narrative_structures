what Thai custom when you gonna be among

supposed to be among for couple months
three months okay and you start out with
you are elderly member of your family
you know tact a little bit

month since you use it halfway there
then I shave my eyebrows well if I was
gonna do that what would I do you have
to shave your head in an hour and you
have to stay at the temple and study but
how long the way of you know Buddhism
before she used to be three months oh my
but now now they can do it for one week
two weeks and they said after one week
oh I've seen Buddha respect bullshit
they said all right I become a new man
and after one week come on
and some people start out a week or two
weeks and keep on staying where because
of the serene and you know peacefulness
and they never feel like that before
they get addicted
well no worry you know just simple life
because our Wi-Fi yeah
but one one one Buddhist thing I learned
a long time ago it was like all
suffering comes from desire right it's
like if you don't want anything
spend your up and you're happy it's like
that and that only comes from you know
you seen in the way a design is saying
right because you I mean like you don't
really you don't want a car until you
grow up seeing people with cars you know
Creed yeah you want it and you become
you greed for it and then you do
anything for it and it's been bad thing
happens but the Bodhi dad how can I say
