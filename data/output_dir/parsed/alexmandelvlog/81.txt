walking down York belt right now up
there actually like houses right there
that was actually our condo and I lived
there for short periods of time when I
was doing the show scare tactics I was
regular on that for a few seasons so
they would film it here in Toronto and
that's where I would live while we had
that but we don't have anymore if I
forgot to bring anything is definitely
gloves I can't feel my hands right now
and it's hard to block last time serious
Pete was in town he actually gave me a
pair of his period wrapped so that's
been helped me a lot because I've been
doing a lot of heavier lifting
unfortunately I know a lot of you guys
have an app to see what I do with the
gym but I'll tell you right now that the
gym that I workout at Equinox a and if I
pull up my camera so absolutely that's
the type of gym they are on push maybe
I'll find a gym where I could do the
same kind of stuff but I'm allowed to
film I think to set in LA there's like a
youtuber gym so I could go do that I
keep trying to drive a sweat off my face
and it just keeps coming back which is
totally fine except for the fact that
I'm about to go out into the freezing
weather hot right now
