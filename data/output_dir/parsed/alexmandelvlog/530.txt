hey guys I am taking my little boy here
mr. Harvey he's going over to the vet
they watch him for me
well I'm done I'm not leaving right now
but I'm going to go do something fun
tomorrow you guys will see what we're
going to do I have meat and a bunch of
friends but just for a day and then I
pick him up Saturday but as always like
I said before I hate leaving this man
just hate it but I would rather him have
someone to play with him at the vet they
don't keep in a cage or they that they
have like a playroom he gets to play
with other dogs and they take him out a
few times a day so at least he's happy
he always seems happy there
and yeah you did it go man but I'll pick
you up soon yeah but uh you'll see what
we're doing tomorrow it's it's pretty
cool just got to my parents house now I
get to see my doggies over here
I hate Harvin was really excited he
loves to people work there though so he
was like jumping around already playing
with other dogs
let's see hello hi hey Lola I've won
little ones the 30 face for both your
birthdays huh yeah Abby Abby Abby Abby
yeah look you jumped up with your all
the dogs want to see ya she wants to
fight I was looking through drawers at
my parents house and I found my very
first airsoft gun I ever had when I was
younger look at this
but the thing is is you could tell that
it's old because when I first got it
no airsoft gun had an orange tip that's
how old it is so literally just yeah it
looks like a real guy literally
literally looks like a real gun but in
all these shoots airsoft so that's cool
I don't know I'm sure a lot of people
would love airsoft guns right now
without our tips but I don't recommend
it because you don't want the cops to
shoot you make instead of it making the
best in the bicep pastry style see now
it's melting there that's not supposed
to go oh this looks good
yeah I'm not throwing a bad job I don't
know they did they seem to be cooking
when I do this this thing was hot still
he doesn't really like to fully cook
them as he likes to mr. Zito does

is melting yeah I would eat this stuff
