hey guys it's a new day today I am
currently in Malibu with with us with a
friend hi I was talking about pepper oh
yeah well pepper is actually not feeling
too well today so we brought her out
here mm her vet is and the vets that
she's doing okay she just has to take
care of herself yeah you had occasion to
happen that's why I'm carrying her
because she will walk yeah she's being
lazy a bit lazy right now she doesn't
feel well pepper you're actually not
that light pepper doesn't look too bad
she just looks like she just wants to be
held right now that's not working it I
think you're faking it I think you just
want to be held yeah I got a call from a
representative that works at Honda and I
actually was talking with them they
helped me find the other bike that I
have my Honda Shadow Phantom and he was
like hey we're going to be in the area
today I was wondering if we can stop by
your place we have something for you
and I was like okay but you can come by
probably something really cool for my
bike like maybe a new part or something
or a trailer I don't know I don't know
what that I didn't even blog because I
was kind of in shock and had to fill out
paperwork for this but you have to see
what Honda just came I don't even have
words to explain it this is so easy look
at this they just dropped off the 2018
honda grom okay this is like Honda's
smallest street-legal motorcycle it's
only it's a 125cc bike but it is just
pure fun this thing is tiny but it has a
license plate and everything you can
ride it on the street this is legal
this is brand-new no miles on this
what sit on it
I want them to see how big this thing is
it's a little it's the perfect bike for
this is what I could teach you on I've
been saying I want to teach you on the
other one and then other ones kind of
scary what this one like you're so big
is that what the joke goes inside Oh
could you fall like this is that did you
just make a batch okay look I have this
key tag I just put this key tag on I
think launch key is perfect for the bike
but just maybe probably doesn't
necessarily watch but come here there's
a dog let me out now
Hondo y'all go do crazy
yeah you know wake up the neighbors I
think oh my god I love how quiet is
though because now I could take those
places where lots of a motorcycle
because this tube it places where I
can't put a buzzer buzzer all right
let's get a full 360
oh yeah shake it that booty of it
I'm definitely going up to grab my
helmet and everything and I need to go
for a ride now unfortunately I don't
have a helmet cam or anything to record
that yet which kind of sucks because I
wish I could right now which means I'm
going to have to rush extra fast to get
that so we could see some motovlogs -
I'm just shocked
I already bike number two I didn't even
know it was happening
guys I got to tell you I'm officially in
love officially in love with a
motorcycle that thing is so much fun it
doesn't have an insane amount of power
but it's it honestly it feels like a toy
and I know that that's not maybe not the
best thing to say but on the road it's
just you definitely be careful you're
smaller than another bike but it's
amazing
she's not feeling too good this is like
so the opposite of I don't want to have
to go but pepper will poop all over your
house at my house
Richard yeah you got to see what I just
got where did you hear I'm going to show
you it's a surprise ok just come from ok
I'm not going to surprise you here it's
in the garage
Oh
all right keep walking to see what's in
front of this I think around cosmos II
remember yeah y'all get up and ride all
across China
oh my god Lily I would write it I want
to try and do it you take the camera
okay
I
that's such a cool play it's so small
it's easy around this
anything I love it man it's a yeah
but I decide to do the other ones you
guys to resolve my snapchat you try to
do this I think you know what I'm
getting at
Richard I don't well I think this
elevator and Prevention to take this
little Park

value it yeah I was just riding it in
the apartment inside isn't that where
you ride a bike this size gentlemen you
bring it in your Hall you shouldn't be
riding a bike inside and you know your
mother's always taught you what size
doesn't matter does it
you lent me to bring it in are you
coming in
yes really when I'm free of my camp I
don't know if I could fit through your
door no I don't think so why do you have
to bring it in here what are you doing
what what Alex what every person spiders
now excite we like that you come and
visit but don't bring the bikes in that
yeah I didn't want anything oh there's
no such thing as an apartment by Alex
don't leave don't why you mad at him
look so for the fun what are you doing
what are you showing me Alex you
starting it no Alex it's not allowed you
don't ride motorbikes in a house
Alex get out of the kitchen Alex get out
of the kitchen Alex get out of the
fridge what are you doing Alex Alex
don't ride a motorcycle into the fridge
really Alec
really you don't do that where you going
out I'm going to take it back downstairs
or upstairs huh you said you didn't want
me riding a motorcycle on the road
I listened that's a good night anyway
guys I am beyond excited I'm going to
definitely order a helmet cam so that we
could do some moto vlog soon because
that will be extra fun especially on the
Gras I could ride the other one around
here as well but I think the Gras would
be fun to like take a PlayStation like
in an apartment but with that being said
that's all I got for you so I will see
you guys again soon goodbye
