some time to actually say goodbye to you

gonna be it's only ten days it's gonna
go by fast promise and right as I
stepped out of the car
I forgot my blog camera was on my lap I
dropped it and broke my vlog camera so I
actually had to charge I'm now using my
old camera charged the battery all night
so that I can vlog it so I can finish
this that's why it kind of just that it
went from straight from there to look
it's just me look at this I this is like
kind of stuck out here I could push the
button whoa that it does that and then
nothing works on it I tried taking out
the battery doing everything ah it's
screwed I went to Best Buy
right after yesterday so I can go pick
up a new cameras like I still have a
charged battery and that one everything
but apparently Best Buy doesn't even
sell that one yet
so I have to order it so I guess what
might be on this one for a little unless
I can find a store today but with that
being said I'm gonna go ahead and end it
here I actually would have given you
more yesterday I just didn't have a
camera so I hope you guys understand
that and you guys get me for ten days
and we're gonna have a good time so I
hope you guys are ready for that and I
will see you guys again soon bye
