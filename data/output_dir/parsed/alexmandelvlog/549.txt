very similar but hey guys
like a little people before I even start
this vlog I would miss Massey and we
just grab lunch at Whole Foods
something healthy yeah and then break in
the store uh and yeah so now she's
shopping then I gotta get some work
clothes and then I don't know what we're
gonna do
I gotta say we've been stopping in a few
different stores and it really goes on
goes on sale signs like 40% off 50% off
those really suck you in
she's like oh well this store it says
everything's up to 50% up
okay we go in we don't really find
anything so she has a funny thing but
those for sale those on sale signs work
so I'm thinking about getting like an on
sale sign to put on me that way I'm just
going to suck people in and they're
going to want to be like let's go there
it might work but it's a good strategy
yeah I'll try it
we just finished shopping around I
actually I bought t-shirts that are not
black I got one black t-shirt but Macy
was helping me we got into other good
ones yeah like a week we can show them
yeah I got this color look at this it's
like a blue it looks really light on
here it's not it's not as light as it
looks
and then what's that one we got this one
it's like a burgundy yeah like a very
dark burgundy type of thing and then a
lighter blue one and then just a white
and a black black yeah black and and the
white because I could always wear the
white one too like underneath that
blazer I got and I think that look nice
