always is and oh all right someone very
special is here what'd you say and get
someone very special is here oh that's

some of you new ones won't know but some
of you who've been here for a long time
know that one of my best friends that I
grew up with since like second grade
moved to China years ago and he comes
back to visit every so often and I just
picked him up there's there's the
Chinaman Richard yeah an old school a
team Sharon when I had the mustache if I
grew the mustache back she would punch
me in the nuts she's like you better not
wait for the gate but yeah we got to
make new shirts we have them learn the
words made you happy I wouldn't be in
very happy for you go back
never look you in the face a lot happy
you could look me in the face now you
brought some cool stuff one of the few
gifts that he brought from China are the
coolest shoes I have ever seen
they're like rocks but they have closed
their clocks look at this you got you
actually got them in Thailand and we got
a Thailand right you got these in
Thailand and brought it back there there
mmm Klaus and you guys remember this at
least a lot of you remember this this is
the blue laser super-powerful
I mean this stuff this burns like paper
and everything he brought me a black one
you know it is like just like this blue
laser except it's cooler because it's
black and everything that's black is
cooler to give you guys an idea of how
powerful these lasers are this is just
like a bag I can hold it any distance
I'm just holding it close so that you
guys could see it but look so if I aim
it there see that can draw stuff in it
Wow pretty cool see I was drawing the
line down it you can like burn holes and
things I picked up Richard in my Jeep
what were you going are you laying on
okay well I picked up Richard in my Jeep
and I told him I said I could take all
the doors off the roof off everything
but I haven't done it yet he's like why
don't we do it okay let's do it which is
exactly why I have this movers Matt I
have another one over there and then I
have another one over there just so that
nothing we had to scratch try to take it
off so I've never taken everything off
so we will let's take it off
power to the windshield wiper remove
that squeeze these side things we had to
set it down and crawl out of that we're
good now there you go right there
doors off all flanges it is officially
naked look at that I feel like we're
going Jurassic Park even though they
didn't have this in Jurassic Park but
it's still sick there's a lot of stuff I
want to do to this so it'll be a
continuation obviously I'm not going to
keep it like this this is just so that I
can go for a drive probably put it back
on today a little bit later
but I think it looks sexy like that and
there's a lot of things I want to do so
I'm excited I don't know if you guys are
but I'm excited for all the additions
I'm about to put on this thing
whoo I think I have enough trunk space
right there

I only went one exit I kind of didn't
even realize I was going on the freeway
with no doors probably not the safest or
smartest thing at all that idea Alex bad
