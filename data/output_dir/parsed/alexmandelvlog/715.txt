canned foods some good some weird and
then we're gonna take off all labels
match them up with numbers and if we
pick the corresponding number we have to
eat that can not knowing what it is

the cans some are great and other ones
are not so great so some you can see
mandarin orange that's good there's a
dog food some cans sauerkraut German
potato salad chub mackerel I don't know
what that is but I know what happens
when I get a chub whole green chillies
green porn and sliced beef as some of
you may be like oh well I would eat that
and I would eat that everyone has
different tastes
Katy won't eat anything seafood at all
so I was like I gotta get that chub
mackerel because she she will love that
I hope that she gets that and then
someone's gonna get that dog food and I
do like sauerkraut but I don't know how
can our kraut and canned creamed corn I
don't know I love corn but out of a can
things aren't always as good so let's
see how this goes okay so just so you
guys know I am unwrapping these cans
I've been unwrapping them Katy don't
look I'm looking at the ceiling
there's the cans we made sure to try to
get like similar kinds of cans and that
way I can uh they can be a secret you
guys may see what I'm having but as you
can see I have no idea
these are all make sizes and now I'm
going to mark them and I'm going to put
corresponding numbers into a bowl so we
can pick them out and randomly get these
cans okay so we got these we got these
numbers going here on paper we're going
to fold them put them in my giant jigger
and then we got these cans here all
marked I have no idea what they are I
know that katie has no idea because she
was peeing while I was unwrapping and
then she came to so a lot of these are
actually all these I have no idea so
this will be interesting

who's going first and that's with a
