eminent I don't know that was sarcasm by
the way she's has been really close like
hate all this I've been to e3 once
before absolutely loved it
she has never been so she's been really
excited about this we have officially
got our badges and I actually thought we
were getting general badges I had no
idea we didn't actually buy the tickets
Nintendo provides them so thank you so
much antenna this is super awesome and
the lady at the desk goes oh by the way
these are upgraded badges she goes go
moves if you get no copy though there
was no doubt they're a thousand dollars
each I'm like oh okay I won't lose it
probably gonna stay on my neck
thank you
now come out
don't think I'd like
the benefit
and shoot them down
vaporize them

go check out but maybe check out the
most important part of the convention
first that would be so far

they're so big you I have found you
final you're really hard to miss you
know yeah except yours is like stuck
open arms the mark one and I drop you
like this miss this year's is open to
the public and not only industry
professionals it is just really packed
out it's out really busy instead of
waiting in line stay to play games we
decide just to walk around show you guys
the floor show you can clue there's a
bunch of cool selfies we didn't get to
as well but since there's three days of
it we figured today would be more
exploring and want to see what we want
to do and tomorrow we'll actually
waiting some of the line we didn't have
to wait in line at Nintendo because my
friend may see who you guys see many
time works there and she hooks it up
hold in there because there's so many
people they try to overkill it does the
body features and gets too aggressive I
like it finally cooled oh yeah let's say

up I've got the game rules the dude the
score card and the I guess charade cards
the cards that you play with

and your mom are going to play alright
and the way it goes is we'll go around
in in in turns and we get to pick these
from this palette cards okay so it's
it'll say and you can't talk it's like
charades but I can give that the like
say I'm going first
okay I give the clue who's the dude and
then somehow with the dude and I can't
say anything he's spider-man right if
you get it then I get a point for
getting you to get it and you get a
point for getting it does that make
sense to you yes it says of the
instructions that the youngest one goes
first and both my parents are a little
bit older than me so I'm going to go
first and I have 45 seconds on the clock
to get as many of these cards down as
possible go
