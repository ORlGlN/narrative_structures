hey guys it's a new day today and I'm
hearing my buddy Greg ah we decided to
get some food I was looking my
refrigerator because I realize I still
have some sandwich meats I also I have
this thing about a lot of people say how
come you don't stock up your
refrigerator how come you just go out
and eat the thing is is every time I
stock up my refrigerator I end up
wasting food I hate wasting food I
absolutely hate it Jake convinced me to
stock up he was like if we get sandwich
meats and stuff we'll eat it that's not
true because I like to eat so many
different things so now I went in to go
get and sandwich me thinking like oh
yeah we still have it I don't know if
this is still something I should eat or
not you know it's just green and hairy
and I think that that's fine right I
mean it doesn't doesn't smell bad does
it I know it smells bad huh I also had
to just throw out two other things that
were in there I'm just this is clearly
no women live here because men can't
take care of themselves
no I just that was not not a good smell
that was not something I should eat that
I just pulled out some turkey breasts
and it doesn't expire until the 23rd so
that looks okay except for the fact that
let me open it it sounds like a seal all
hairy and nice oh is that a word no okay
that's that's got to go away too
see this is why I hate this because I do
you know how terrible I feel throwing
away perfectly
I'm not a perfectly good it's not good
anymore but throwing away food that we
never had to buy because we didn't ruin
gonna finish it so now I'm making sure
Jake is gonna watch this so he sees how
much we are wasting trying to save money
by buying pre wised up it just doesn't
work I like to buy whatever I'm gonna
eat for the day sometimes I do pretty
buy like the night before just the stuff
eat the next day but too much goes to
waste if you try to bulk by for only
like two people the house we're passing
a mattress store what that's amazing
I don't even know what that is I barely
ever do that onto my bed really good
died with sheep I like the other eyes
are just bulging well mean that I have
heard that sheeps have like one of the
closest related vaginas or human like
it's supposed to go to goat that's a
sheep there we go a goat yeah is it
sheep or goats you guys do the research
oh yeah I just got a call from Megan
actually a text I didn't get a call I
read like cause I like texts better so
it's good that she texted you a text
from Megan the you guys know cuz she's

place cuz they're like eat it now yeah
you have to eat it
and sugar fish they tell you every time
they bring you food they tell you how to
eat it so they go eat it well it's at
this temperature or else it won't be
good and the rice is warm which I get is
like the right way to eat it but it's
okay I'm gonna eat it how I'm paying for
this use mid-conversation and you and
who's gonna when you order food who's
gonna sit there and be like I'm not
