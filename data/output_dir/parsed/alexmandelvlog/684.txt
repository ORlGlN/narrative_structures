on the block like I just did my friend
Brandon's coming up you guys know
Brandon if you've been watching my vlogs
but I think he's coming up the elevator
right now I see him there he is
I love that I could see people in the
elevator caught people dancing and
everything like that that's the best
part about being able to see into it oh
you are getting big you are getting big
hey guys someone's here that you haven't
seen the last few vlogs for the week
Jake okay he's actually been here he
just got here after I was done vlogging
and already editing so that's why you
didn't see him so some of you were like
you should have Jacob well he's been
here just not during the day he works he
works he is work he does exist I exam I
want to show you guys saying though I've
been I've been I like I like my drinks
made well and you guys already know that
so a great cocktail has great ice so
look at this I've been seen like those
molds are making more but these ice
cubes here these ice cubes are Gigantor
the size of this so this I'll just grab
it see how big this ice cube is and the
reason why the reason why you make it so
big is because the huge surface area
makes it melt a lot slower and you won't
water down your cocktails
that's another bartending tip for you
yeah we're about to drink that's why I
figured I'd show you we just found out
something what do we find out try it
it doesn't exactly fit that that damn it
damn it
ah well I guess we'll use Regulus
let's use regular ice guys I want you to
check this out this is what my mom just
got me to drink with and I didn't do my
mustache today so that's how you're
going to drink oh yeah man you sick this
side and the drink like this it comes
straight up here it goes through these
glasses pass the wonderful mustache and
into my mouth
let's drink Oh got me that kid alone
yeah buddy good let's make this another
screwdriver
