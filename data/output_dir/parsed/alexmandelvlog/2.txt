right that's my favorite too
this is my buddy Joe you guys know my
friend Brandon he doesn't want a
training in Krav Maga and jujitsu and
he's like a master at all of that well a
lot of people he trains with our police
officers what did his friends that he
trains with his for join the area
currently he asked him to stop by just
say hi but I have other plans
uh-oh that's not a good sign hey dad dad
that neighbor called the cops on you Oh
why I don't know but they weren't talked
to you so I want to get this on the vlog
if it continues going on right and also
what if there's DJ said whatever is
coming home we take that as a okay I'll
tell you exactly what it is a bouncy
thing with balls it's all gonna end just
for little children and we're
it's out back okay so we'll try to keep
it down a lot of them it's bedtime
right yeah I'm getting I'm not getting
information of who the opponent is his
name is actually Alex except this time I
have a real they trained together ready
funny
okay well the things also
okay thank you so much okay look at this
fog that just came in this is rolling in
I'm just going home last night and
heading to bed not much happen but I had
just a great time yesterday I was
driving so I was I'd like one drink that
you guys saw that was it but I still had
a fun time a lot of good food a lot of
good fun and I'm so happy that we were
able to pull in another cop right
on both my mom and my dad and I was
actually not shocked that they fell for
it because he literally pulled up in a
cop car the lights shining in the
windows and then he's in full uniform
and everything so I knew he would fall
for especially since the neighbor
typically called the cops anyway so we
got him again
that was funny and it was totally spur
them on with Brandon's like my friends
in the area I was like tough to come
down with that being said that is all I
got for you I hope you guys enjoyed
watching and I will see you guys again
soon
goodbye
