Andrea it's a little cold that's a pool
it's actually just getting cold on it
baby says the pool
I'm sure wait I was totally fine and I
got some fucking freak I really want to
get like cool shots at me underwater but
I can't open my eyes
Oh your contacts and contacts we went in
the pool but we decided that we wanted
to do something a little different okay
know what is right there the ocean the
ocean in which is really cold right now
it's gonna be really cool but you know
what I think that we should take
advantage of the fact that we live in
Santa Monica we never go to the ocean
ever I was like right down the street so
we're gonna we're gonna go jump in the
ocean
we're gonna take advantage of it Oh
who's gonna be cold
so with some sharks I don't know how
well you can see it because it's dark
but we don't do it oh my god in the
ocean at night
how cold it is what she got
it's so nice in the ocean
oh my god I miss it in here yeah
don't walk to too far yeah because it is
feeding time
sunset is when they be
well you don't be shark food oh really
push it back you delicious how good what
was that oh my god it was so okay I have
always hated California beaches there
sandy they're itchy you can never tell
what's underneath you because you can't
see anything okay but that was so nice
it was so nice and actually felt warm it
was so warm and like comforting and I
honestly was about to like swim into the
depths of that ocean until so she
realized it was sharks and so no I love
sharks you want to swim with them Ali
Hashi yes swim with them but now it's
told me that their feeding time was
right
they feed at sunrise and sunset and we
were swimming at sunset so that made
that turn me off a little bit but maybe

like not a shark feeding it was really
nice though it was super nice yeah where
