hey guys it's a new day today now that
our second day on the ship and we are in
a very familiar place that you guys have
already seen on the vlogs I got to show
you I got to show you this the reason
why I say its familiar is because look
at where we are
that is the Atlantis we are in the
Bahamas that is where we stayed when you
guys saw us on the vlogs I think was
last month it was not that long ago at
all we are back in the Bahamas but we're
going to stay on the boat since we
already went to that hotel and today
we're going to be exploring the water
slides and surfing everything we
possibly can as long as as long as it's
open we can get to it and and we could
do it we will oh look who's here
she was just getting ready you stuck
your toe oh shit stamina oh you ready
yeah why this woman yeah good add some
slides yeah go surfing yeah yeah you
know what you know what
cuz it always it cuz it always is
exactly I wanted to tell you guys
something awesome if you have ever been
on a cruise ship you know that the worst
part of a cruise ship is the internet
because it goes so slow and it's usually
like what is it two three dollars a
minute something crazy like that so part
of the reason that I was so excited
about this is I was like I can't really
blog on the cruise because I can't
upload because the Internet's just so
expensive to use and it bloats like one
website in like 20 seconds yeah so lucky
that Royal Caribbean now on all of their
ships have this new internet thing new
Internet service called voom which is
yeah v-- oom2 / crazy fast you don't
have to pay by the minute you pay like
daily so that you can use it unlimited
on your phone on anything and what are
you looking looking at
oh I look I just I just saw this on yeah
but yeah so that's boom high-speed
Internet the reason I'm saying it is
I am currently uploading my vlog right
now and it's already at 42% which is
great we're gonna let it finish while we
go to the pools and stuff like that but
it really doesn't take that long it's
super fast so if you guys are worried
about doing any work on cruise ships at
least you can do it in Royal Caribbean
sorry no more we are about to go on
which is on the abyss right yeah that's
slide that goes all the way down ten
stories
ten story
