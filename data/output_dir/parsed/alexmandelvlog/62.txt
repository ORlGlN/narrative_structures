struggling a little bit we wanted to
sleep in and I tried to get late
check-out but they said no that that's
not an option and we have like five
hours of sleep I think we have less than
five hours sleep yeah less but
definitely less afire it's like we don't
have a room to sleep in so we decided to
sleep out here by the pool we're at the
pool area but it's really really hot and
we don't have our bags we put our bags
and we're like in jeans and everything I
think we just need to go like in the
coolers right you know we are super
