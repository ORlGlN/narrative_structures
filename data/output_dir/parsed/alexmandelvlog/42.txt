Mitali helped me here because I told him

style idea my rope here and we could
tell him good builders I have extra PVC
laying around so this is a good grip if
you want to like hold on to how long
should it be that long by day not a
little shorter for one yeah
well cuz you're going to be on a
skateboard like turning sideways so
maybe like you want it
oh yeah up good so right here why would
you go it's always talking this map they
cut through it slowly Wow
there you go this is perfect like what
better way to tell the skateboard I
don't know really know where to attach
it I want to tear these off but no these
will rip right off so I'm not going to
attach to there this is all plastic
right here so we figured right here
would be good it's not I'm just going to
pull slow at first so it's not going to
rip this leather thing off but I think
that's the riffle push it check this out
are you tied on here well we have no
other place that I just thought you did
you chose there's nowhere just overall
it's kind of ripped right off I don't
think so you think so this is an are
gonna root ball I guess like a oh shit
handled so I remember like us back here
if you attach it to any of these go
break off and this whole these are prior
but I got the perfect spot right here
see these spokes just tie right right
there with my fingers all the way around
okay kid is it a round thing
look at this oh yeah we could do that I
thought that way makes it shorter now
