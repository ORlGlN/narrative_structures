hello all right me and Joe decide to do
a video today you may notice that I have
very minimal make-up on I've basically
just got concealer and foundation and
this is because somebody suggested that
we do the your brother does your makeup
I think it's technically people do this
where their boyfriend does that make up
but I think we've got interesting to see
how you do my makeup to be honest I'm
more clear I've got a little box of
stuff I just I pin that I'm not told
what it is I've not explained to him
which bit goes where I've literally just
put it all in there on your face we can
be that famous have you ever seen a girl
before but nobody think they gave you
this do you put all this on no I'm
giving you a selection you'd have to put
it all on me to ever okay she warms like
people do the same thing
they're nice bad times have you ever
seen a girl do their Mayfair how have
you gone 21 years of life and never seen
anyone pick make one oh yeah looks like
Ted television stuff but what channels
do the vehicle traffic QVC
let's get started then what do you want
to use first you have to show them what
you picked and what it's cool this is a
pencil case I missed it fell out try to
thing come on right please put what do
you need to put on my face first on
like your face of that okay quick
yeah let's wipe some on life make
it cheap is a cheap way to stand out
they're all close you know hoping for a
more open that's what girls have to do
every day this is looking good show them
what it is it's brown stuff a brush to
play on this is like it's like the paint
brushes you get a primary school you use
Stirling's paint yeah that's probably
what's lately going on is it also look
do you want to go for your decided we're
going for the slightly going out on the
town look this all the girls it like
when you go out yeah I'll make you look
like the girls you see all the night now
safe a stone method you sure I said I
felt on the for
it just goes that's like the biggest
part of the face on some people may be
age rise wipe a bronzer on my eyes right
now establish a school bronzer okay look
like as you see doing a bunch of meth in
the forehead but whatever your face you
just look like you got tunnel right okay
so you finish with that make sure that
that was good success now what do you
think you need to do right is what do
the girls and nights out have on our
saffron their eyes right so I want some
what's up underneath I make slightly got
black eyes jumpin up you're right
show me what it is no you won't want red
you want like a dark color yeah
this stuff looks like is God gives and
drives under these little ones are the
noise brush to use see I get this one
that's like secondary school up our
brush size okay shading the brush this
one just that brush there right what you
gonna do put it on my eyes on your eyes
okay Jay than what you're putting on my
eyes which colors are you gonna go for
brown to brown for it this one
business have been used a few times okay
show them right we're going for this and
which color is it the one in the brown
right okay go on then is that good idea
I'm not telling you anything go wish I
did know which one I was going for
doesn't matter really does it just put
some of my eye Egan's I'll just starting
off for the dark brown and let's
get this wearing so right phase right
yet whiteness is very on top is this
good top you either okay how did you
like any undue like go back one you
can't no oh donut eater I use
another brush to wipe it away of it is
how it does please rise
J let you know maybe like up in punch
that's no I've ever been in a fight is
it come on
yes come off okay okay guys yeah yeah
the pattern colors yes then what we do
is probably like a shade on top oh gee
nice mix it up so I'm going for this
dusty color dusty color I'm just gonna
give this dusty one y-you see Wes muslin
smells all right you're literally gonna
put my eyeball out if you do it anyway I
know your face of ye yes but my face
yeah but maybe oh someone wanting some
eye watering up some food it's like
painting with powder paints that are too
powdery school eyeshadows I think of
this thing is that my eyes finished oh
those little freaky happening to the
side
thinking this no it's just you need one
of these serious ooh goodie gay yeah cuz
you're doing a great job
still it's harder because I gotta reach
cross this side of the face yes I
usually have to go one side than the
other side doing yourself only night
left hand because I can't do the point I
would once i fisting look alright once i
zoom look out she's shy
alright okay alright yeah done
I think you think it's done actually
that bad do my eyebrows these are my
more orange on you what you put on
eyebrows what's this that's the top for
the lid for the pencil just use the
tenser shopkins shopping eyebrows kit oh
you got to fill my eyebrows in it's
trying to help you know always I never
knew one or you could use that if you
want off your eyebrows you can use
anything you want
oh yeah and the Troy eyebrows are stable
bloated you need me scales bro tell you
what's known as cows brow
firstly worried it's not bad scalp
rubber wise do a bit of like your real
eyebrow in it so you can sort of give it
a brown so what it does is it shows you
still got real eyebrows but it's to now
go think bit different which shows that
your experiment in which shows it it's
just sure it's the same height and width
as the other one
how do I look that's eyebrows done okay
like a shawl you never know
am I gonna have some mascara yes if I
knew I was there's too much be careful
because two things on this boy you've
got your blink first if he put on first
is at the top of the thing
don't use that right I do min ya put
this on first now what holds up I'm
a little bit scared right now
where's it going eyebrows or eyelashes
whatever you out that like Gemma -
I like your eyebrows Keystone shutter
flick these up go so you look you can
see the eyebrows flicking up underneath
the fake one to zoom in quickly just
going min you might not notice but it's
a fake eyebrow but if it's drawing on
with a drawing eye on eyebrow pencil if
we zoom in I've just used the what's it
called what's it called eyeliner no the
thing I used despite your eyebrow up
I've used the most are air to give it a
child look keep keep still to make it
like his jugular see that compared to
the other one now it looks like combed
down on the right it's spiked out so it
makes you look more real I'm zooming
back out now just my eyebrows eyebrows
first before I ashes okay hey please I
try and do it alright very difficult
won't leave it once you get this in your
eye
nothing problems right uh Jo
it's very difficult not to blink when
you're so else is doing it
Cho I'm gonna clue this work
what does him do is anything what be my
gosh is it yeah I got real eyelashes in
thank you for you're not going to use it
lip but now I'm going to use a second
bit which is volume tarmac on stick
what's this dude's making a bigger yeah
that is an absolutely rank I think on
your rifle sorry they've got marks on
your face it's definite makes your cheek
stand out yes blusher run geez well I
think no orange one orange one that one
hasn't really come out very strong so
you probably better off with one of the
others yeah right similar to what these
are like in that no that one definitely
wrong use a fat brush again for this
okay I go shop then we've got that one
with a Primus no actually I'm a school
paint brush put someone out of this
slapdash D to be a dating
make sure you better all lines got polio
going on me she's not mine plagiarize
close my eyes
why do you dab it with stroke it's up to
you J I might go first what's known as a
stroke dad whereas if a mixture of both
sometimes it's always good put on the
chin as well why just meet his chin
stand out why would you want to make
your chin all blank still lovin big chin
do that sometimes just get out of the
brush now is the hard part we doing next
1/8 Phillips stick it all way out would
you put a little bit out or we do have a
pencil ease were you trying do it a
little bit out because if you get a
press hard it might snap off oh yeah
I've already scary feeling that you're
making a good like Frida Kahlo I find
you that was it pull you out so question

you're trying I'm trying to apply it
like this pink cashmere coat Ronnie got
