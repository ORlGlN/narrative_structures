it's some of those issues in the icing I
wouldn't want to risk you out they
that's good let's good try
so the icing isn't aged like that or not
I don't want to try it it's your
decision really hard super good this has
been the hardest week of Jughead that
I've had up or why we use of judging why
aren't you going for a second bite of
that one well I don't think you can
physically pick that up anymore
sleeping up a layer it's disintegrating
one just by little back yeah start by
