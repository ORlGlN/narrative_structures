one I'm making with Louise hello um I'm
actually staying with us so I've just
done loads of loser videos that we can
just bottom I'm going to be sick of us I
know on your channel so no good I'm
sorry you're sick of us or they might
really like it I hope they do I'm going
trying to spread these out a little bit
so you might be watching this another
time in the future for us but in present
for you and it will be the past for you
but this is a present for us we
currently have zilch makeup so I'm sorry
if we look a little bit stark stop so
when that little bit naked facially
facially naked because today we are
going to do the blindfold makeup
I guess challenge it will be quite a
challenge I've actually got this idea
from Gracie who did the blindfold makeup
challenge tag and she is the ugly face
of beauty I'll leave a little link to
her channel below because her video was
quite amusing I thought I thought so too
yeah she was like I don't know where to
look
this is weird where but we are actually
doing slightly different because like we
did that one on one yes we did it
Gracie's version on Luiza channel but
I'm actually going to blindfold Louise
and she's going to do my makeup
physically blindfold me yes I am if
right I'm gonna actually blindfold you
right now
okie dokie can you see no that's so
tight yeah quite work over okay quick
like for the pressure all right begins
feel around okay you give a start with
some concealer that's super okay
up I could see you on your hands
thank you do you prefer a bit more
concealer do you like em bottom stuff at
seam it looks okay to me
what said you know we have a bit of hair
yeah a bit on the nose yeah
okay Oh God
didn't even get round your nose right
just do your eyes this is so hot right
right now some foundation ah okay you
you don't even know the back of your
arms it should feel like one before
I'll just get the hair all out of the
foundation you need more
yeah because really just one squirt okay
Mike yeah okay right okay
this it yep right that's not the pen
part which I
good thank you
I don't know we're slides contouring
which slides not or feel I can't feel
yeah cuz one part is bigger than the
other I don't know okay I think this is
probably the brown but that's a lot
please
all right carry on can you smile movies
yeah I am right no I'm squeezing my
features do I really chuckles oh my
handle it all you doing the highlight
now are you yeah okay I get quite a lot
I don't know how much it picks up a lot
okay carry on
just another bridge of your nose
I usually do it on the chest of
highlight you want to know because I've
got a high neck t-shirt oh it's a
blusher must feel like an arse but yeah
good right now
eyeliner Oh God
liquid eyeliner okay okay making like
problems concentrating noise it haha
okay Proctor right I don't know which
colors which do I know okay I'm going to
use this color for the for the inner
corner okay yeah
oh sorry though no you should do it
under the eyebrow bone like highlight
where's your eyes on this side the same
it seemed to be being a lot more
forceful than he had eyes mascara Oh
nope okay good to you I never find it
otherwise
oh that felt like it got it because I
feel the bristles going ah okay oh I got
I'm very scared
alright you can like feel like Alex with
the eyelash that wasn't going through
yeah going to your eyebrow it's a
freaking window
what is that even turned up enough yeah
is it this is a special me we'll make it
wobble II okay would you like to remove
your blindfold yeah I think we do
as you can see perfect fact Louise my go
you
okay blindfold on you go okay you sure
that's concealer yes oh oh this is weird
it's hard to anything is that yeah
okay where's your foundation here it is
and here's a brush
oh how do you know where the back of
your hand it yes it is very hard okay I
think I might ask we start with too much
their lips oh I think that was a lot of
it yes
don't know where your facial features
are just gonna smear it yeah mmm lovely
hmm okay
oh come that's your cheek right yeah
it's easier to squish the cheeks I found
Duffy forehead yeah that's perfect
bronzer on the forehead the firm hand
you got it is weird isn't it yeah you're
pressing really hard on my face it's
like when you can't see you lose a lot
of your like senses you send some depth
Lister probably should just be more
gentle I don't mind I think it all adds
to the to the subtle look that I've got
going on okay either liquid or coal
liquid and then cold smudge mmm feels
good jelly eyeliner King sexy over
wearing my hair it's ridiculous fit is
loop stuffing which I my eyes open or
shut shut first Yeah right look at how
cute
mmm the lungs but you can't tell them is
hey look up this is terrifying
Oh a lot of these wait
okay yeah
luckily we want to talk a bit otherwise
it's just I know but I'm concentrating
so what okay then your eyebrows so you
have look nice oh by hurting you don't
have to you just have a set you know as
a firm with that brush aren't you it's
really weird because I feel like I'm
being really light I didn't I thought
like I really had to stab to get
anything on oh you've done it for me as
well yes okay
okay keep your eyes shut
don't worry I will okay next one
and then what I'm doing right now stick
or maybe I'll try a bit of lip liner
over it for sure he'll run it by there
mm-hmm what I think of is like a
marmalade for your top lip all right
this is so hard
okay okay without me to smile or poker
oh just keep your mouth closed last ones
she'll talk
okay think of it then can't we just quit
looking at me finder mmm-hmm are you
ready to look yeah okay
