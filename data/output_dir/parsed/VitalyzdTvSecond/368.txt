talking about gold-digging and to be
honest a lot of times on this this show
a girl will say he took me to Applebee's
on my first date and I'm gonna be like
dumped in more you didn't pay and it's
like dumping this I just found out
there's a hole in my dress okay anyway
what sorry people I need to find a rich
man to sew that up so the point is there
are different levels I mean I'm in you
know women women wanna guys buys them a
nice ring and it'll talk to their
girlfriends if it's not nice or that
type of thing I want to show you the
video that's very telling and I'm
curious what you all think what's up
cutie what's going on hey I was looking
at you and I thought you were really
pretty and I wanted to get your number
is that too much to ask for or let's go
out to dinner oh yeah will you go to
dinner by yourself Wow
um I don't usually ask twice but you
sure you don't wanna go out with me

goodbye
there's one oh now you want to too bad
I don't like gold diggers
in general you feel like women are
extortionist you only being played by
them yes it happened to me a lot the
reason I did this video is because I
have a lot of friends with girlfriends
and they use them for money
they can't see that but from my point of
view I can see that so I went out to do
this took me 30 minutes before the show
ends have a little present for her you
