that lesson of the day let's have a
discussion of the day
you ready why you're not ready yeah
she's doing something shy you get it you
don't know how to talk to the camera
talk to the camera
okay so I have a lot of viewers that are
watching this that are probably young
men teenage boys some older guys and
everything I want to start it like a
beanie serious where I ask girls how
what do guys need to get girls what guys
need do you have any advice
I guess that works everywhere but I need
a little bit more energy please oh
really
no I'm serious it depends what is your
goal
are you trying to date this girl no if
they just tried to smash sex
yeah oh the pants I mean you just need
to make sure that the girl was the same
thing oh girl I think she wants the same
thing but confidence is the key left the
money the thing body money is that
money's not too cheesy money is that you
don't expect you to do whatever it is oh
so like yeah you don't go up to a girl
hey you're beautiful you hear that all
the time I tell guys they should go up
to a girl be like you're ugly it's a
little too far
so you wouldn't work if I came up to you
like your ugly
ha I'm just kidding you're cute oh
really
because y-you get self-conscious then
what this is the worst hangover ever
letting supposed to drink last night was
supposed to have a nice casual dinner
and Netflix and chill not freaking I
told you the collabing chill so she's
like I'll go to the club Thank You us so
why because I told you if I go to the
club I'm gonna go when I go drinking
guys I go drink all the way I don't just
drink just to have one drink to put the
extra calories and it's like me
basically inspiring kids to go and do
one-night stands
no not healthy okay so okay what if they
want a serious girlfriend what if
there's a girl right now they really
like her and they don't know how to
approach her what is the best way to
surprise her with what Oh surprised
that's a good one so you guys have to
surprise so unzip your pants book
surprise bring your flowers I guess
that's not so lame
I mean it's like a most common surprise
I don't know take her skydiving in it
but are we talking about like if she
later 20 seconds of impression what
you're gonna do
make her laugh but make a girl laugh so
don't be in the common guide be like hey
this is how you you guys see my hut to
pick up girls videos I think I was
getting numbers successfully not because
I was walking up to girls and going like
like serious it was just like I told
this girl I'm like hey your hair looks
like a broom we can I wipe my floor with
it and like she was laughing and then
she ended up giving me her number
yeah so cuz it's like it was a little
off it's not like you're beautiful like
is she like hear this like so many times
a day okay so we should do three advices
on how to get a girl
we did we discussed being funny
surprising one more well you you know if
you're gonna have talking divided period
of time then if you're gonna keep you
have to keep surprising me again just to
reduce what if he keeps him but why
don't the girls surprise me what what
did you surprise me
but seriously what is the what's the
what's the third one
confidence no I mean it's a common
something that people is something that
people don't know something people don't
know that confidence is common being
funny is common if you like
what's like uncommon I don't know if
you're bored of watching this right now
surprise surprise surprise funny and be
a gentleman
those the worst advice is over one more
advice to my face one more advice from
our Russian fellow girl woman advices
what was that lice a man should be in
the control of the situation that's an
example that's a really good an example
is which I didn't do yesterday that's
funny that you said that if you go take
out a girl for dinner and she's like
where we're going you say don't worry
about it I'll take care of it she says
that's very sexy if you say that so
here's an advice but I didn't do that
