want to go out so when we were Italian I
traveled a lot we went three three
months bunch of countries and got to
know each other quite well through this
experience and there's a trip I realized
that you look like an animal and at
first I was like oh this guy looks just
like a slob like exactly like a slob but
then maybe in this face which we've got
to get from the side you got to get to
the side give me that face I'm like no
way vitaliy is Steven

do it again back-to-back a pumpkinette
of bitch feet
my buddy
yeah so he looks like a slob he looks
like Stephen what are the animals in
Cataumet look like that's a good
question of the day the question of the
day is what animal does Vitali look like
and I think number one sloth
the way to their face it looks like
demon
sometimes looks like like a cockeyed
raccoon if you get a fish I like really
close to the states so what we have here
is called an oyster shooter I've never
had it in this type of wine glass but

quail egg there's a noise stir and among
few other things like chopped onions and
