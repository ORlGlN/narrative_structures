now as per usual the vlog was late today
so I can only apologize it was a really
long blog so I was like catching up with
everything plus nothing to deal with the
whole car crash incident so if you
didn't see yesterday's vlog make sure
you go check that out but more
importantly if you are here watching
this video right now are you live
streaming on twitch.tv for such sin to
keep playing for that pretty much all
goddamn night so if you guys wanna check
it out the link in description so much
which come and tuned that in but for the
sake of this people understand what this
is and this is basically where I live
stream the vlog to the channel and then
it turns into a full video afterwards
it's more time effective because I don't
yet have my 500 up five down Internet
and I know people get really confused by
it but it's a really simple concept
rather than me spending three hours to
upload the vlog I just simply livestream
it to youtube and it's there straight
away for you to enjoy rather than as
being super super super super super
super duper late so without further ado
I hope you guys enjoy the vlog it's a
very simple concept and goodbye
good like if you don't come on
Bulls ooh surprise look who's outside my
house busy no no obviously no you miss
coins no just video yeah I could see a
clip from the granddad because we have
to go I feel but I feel bad I always
tell my video this you always turn up as
I'm going you're a little sausage you
know is here one looks so happy with
that and by the way this may be the best
Mother's Day card you've ever had in
your life off me give it a listen
give it you always you always bowed
about what can I do what kind of what
card wait till you see this
well I don't think I'm gonna look at
that you prefer then break until mums
going to the zoo she's got her hand
sanitizer on as if I are ready to rock
and roll get out there we go all aboard
the defender experts
next stop blackboard you got stopped a
woman just stopped toes and said you
can't stick it out of it ooh yep know as
well as a thought but still no wonder
people were staring at the car me
bumpers up hoodie off so I need a new
bumper so I could add that's my list of
purchases bought all right I need a new
side panel new full side panel new
bumper this plastic panel looks alright
and let's just hope you didn't break
anything back here I don't know I think
I can say I think I can take this off
and just replace my bumper let's be
honest so time for a new time for a
bigger stronger
all right Mother's Day Lady Penelope
this is clearly a safety hazard for the
road so I'm gonna do what I could do
best
I don't think the steering was effective
I think your defender can handle the
massive rock being thrown out it can
handle the truck hit my baby
so I've no I just defend along and she's
had some stories antsy she's had a
accelerator power train ha spike gon
know whatever she nearly crushed in the
snow once not for my driving just cuz in

fire oh my god they're Birds mom that's

the police giving a different account of
God on and you were saying we were
driving erratically stealing stuff
phoned in to the police what they've
said is you have to go down to hide
police station tomorrow you can do it
there and then and they'll review the 40
suite we have for monies mobile phone
speak we limp the defender home bumper
stick you know and I'll try my best to
push it in book Manus that's the way it
is yeah well we'll take it to the shop

did you have a great Mother's Day that's
great
all right to summarize a good day at
least thank you very much for organizing
it you're amazing great sister and mom
oh you awkward thank you very much
Remington so if you try Mike experience
it your drivers but you know what
Norma's hurt so that's the best case
scenario great
a new car for tickets and oh my goodness
me what a day a very eventful day you
saw in yesterday's when I get one of the
footage of like the whole defender thing
but I wanted to keep the defender
incident separate from the Mother's Day
vlog so if my mom ever looks back she
can just enjoy the vlog of her spending
the day with each other and to everyone
in the chat he was and kind of smart
even with a one brain cell he
understands what's going on and that
sounds like a really mean in celebra
it's pretty common knowledge what I've
done this has been the several times
I've done this but a rather led me up
loading the vlog like rendering the vlog
with all like my clips like I usually do
daily and uploading it and the vlog
ended up being uploaded it say like 10
11 p.m.
yeah the vlog could be uploaded deadly
so rather than that why do is when I've
edited the vlog together I just live
stream the video but not as a random
file so it just plays all the clips and
then basically it gives the vlog to you
guys instantly rather than in like 6
hours so to everyone who understands
that you are indeed geniuses and to the
people who didn't get it
you better know I named and shamed you
in tomorrow's vlog some people really
struggle with the concept of it but to
people who don't struggle with it you're
all amazing now more important guys I'm
gonna be shooting right now on twitch.tv
I'm switching from this stream over to
twitch if you're watching this right now
but like well Tom I just missed half of
it don't worry in like a couple of
minutes and whatever this will be a full
video on youtube so you'll be able to go
back rewind and watch the vlog so enjoy
that but if you guys will join me on
twitch.tv forest to syndicate
I'm replaying for tonight that will be
down in description yesterday I got four
wins the day before that I got seven
wins and yesterday I got three wins
back-to-back so we're gonna go on that
far night grandpa
yep tomorrow's vlog should be like
normal as usual I just like live stream
it sometimes because it rather than it
like take up my entire night just
waiting to upload and then I'm like
streaming on Twitch and so far it's
quicker to do it this way so
to people who got it thanks for to
standing you're all absolute legends
I'll see you over on the twitch stream
honestly if you understand it you have
common sense if you can't understand it
some people were like I don't understand
how is this vlog but it's got jump cuts
in it I pray for you I pray for you but
nonetheless guys you're all amazing
thank you so much more importantly for
all like the love and support you guys
said it over about the incident that
happened yesterday we're going through
the river with the police to get that
sorted out and you know I'll take
whatever time it does more importantly I
reckon it's gonna come down to a thing
of he'll go you don't have any evidence
of me crashing into your business this
but I do have evidence of him driving on
his phone in the middle lane of a
motorway which should not be done so if
anything can be done from that I want
that guy I a pretend it for that more
importantly and I am pursuing the ruse
to get that done so so guys thank you
very much for tuning honestly I'm really
pretty sure you love the support
