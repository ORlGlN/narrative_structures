I definitely feel like this is a
familiar situation with me sat in the
best car ever from getting to a to be
what you choose add some vodka I'd all
right I thought you choose Harvick so my
dad came in and woke Wilkes I just got
the new iPhone six at my live for some
reason she didn't wake me up whatsoever
like it's the first time I've used it
since I've got the fall on my knees but
Ken's just come what we all is like I'll
throw in tamerica and I'm like I have is
all the time to fly one for me what time

four minutes past 1:00 so we're now
using the swag mobile to hold for try
and get to the airport as fast as
possible I have no bikes to check in I
have checked it online and I should be
able to just like cruise right through
fingers crossed but all we can say is
fingers crossed so if I miss it I miss
it but all six two fingers crossed
thanks Ken you've not everyone everyone
down in the comments legend Ken as
always as Tom Hollis in the fuser it is
actually quite nice day Cratchit Jessica
what was it like seeing other people
that the and then it'll good yeah very
interesting yeah it was so nice friendly

quick quite cute ah ah 69,000
and oh yeah he's a Twitter famous guy ga
da dun Twitter go and show him some love
that's my way of making him happy - so
he doesn't kick me out the cowl right
now just saying there is no way that I
just managed to get here in time there's
the line for the frigging plane my dad
flew to the airport
there's taxi driver ever so honestly go
show my dad some walk but like I got to
the check-in and he said who won but now
you've missed it I was like I've got no
bikes to check I carry hand luggage and
I've got my ticket already actually
you're okay
we're about the author of the ABBA songs
about food
I've met
number versus another
yes
they really cripple
big fun
if kids can take photos being sighted
here so can I fish
what an awesome set of stuff I was just
like is there any chance I could get a
photo in the cockpit and he said yes and
I was like yes so that's obviously do a
bit of a bug in there but then I was
just like thanks guys anybody want a
selfie with us like yeah sure why not I
took a selfie with that as well
she's look at that kids face that was so
I've always wanted to do that I'm so
glad I have so you do as a kid but I was
like it have a grown-ass adult I'm
doing it
gate departing at c64 is going to be
beautiful it's gonna take me to LA in
business class yes
Toula don't stop the video again
nice so awesome as Joseph's book number
two the DFA horses huh yep come on Joe
that goes there that's what it's
supposed to be good job good job
Oh totally abided that there's OLS as
well so sings of a bloomin sister they
can go next to each other just like that
I think one of those difficult things
about flying is trying to pick the
snacks for the flight there's so much
options so many options but so little
time over like 20 minutes to pick so
it's gonna be a toughie but I'm thinking
chocolate and breasteses there's a
Starbucks at the airport so if you can
take a wild guess of what I'm doing to
get soon as I'm heading to LA and I
always get it in LA oh my god I've just
remembered I get to use my floor down
again like tour like yes
take a guess right now as to what I'm
having
is what I'm talking about chocolate milk
with ice that's like a pound right hell
yeah I'm fine I'm a plane I usually get
on his name is Lee I always get on this
plane so I know it's gonna be the
brand-new modern one with like USB ports
and all that
sweet Oh
that's me sweet I'm a business class
flight this time so it's going to be
successful we take care of me you son of
a bitch and this guy you take care of me
as well okay sweet oh there was a lot of
chocolate syrup in that set
exactly I filmed 36 times in normal
economy out of write-up at miles and
finally in business yes
subjects of the success as you already
know filming off ball is the new white
one it's the exact same as at six
there's no different things about at all
and this ladies in general is what you
call perfection and that's beer salad
a random block of cheese don't kid this
is just an actual cheese well this is a
star I'm chilling out watching an
advertisement for like mobile book
called torture soft egg film so good job
so far
ladies and gentlemen dinner is served
we have a beautiful looking steak here a
nice fillet steak some potato carrots
whatever the hell that is and some
pastors are thankful not bad glass of
water plus a bit chill out and watch
some terminator
so I just woke up after now for hours
which is pretty good for on a plane for
me I usually don't sleep I just ever
watch forums but got myself a nice cup
of tea
salmon circle whatever that isn't some
fresh fruit
not bad not where that Sabbath was like
a starter was kind of went for this is a
roast chicken dinner it's currently 2
o'clock in the morning in the UK so this
is like a really weird late supper
yeah
they're nice
you just look at it Oh still tasting I
am ready to dig in and have a delicious
last British meal before I get to
America about an hour and 20 minutes
away so I'm very hungry check out how
cool this is yellow toothbrush
No
well I tried to use this machine for the
first time in LAX and I got a massive no
cannot do they got canceled on UK time
right now it's 5 a.m. in the morning
some plug at my UK phone which is like
oh this is the airport sighs that screen
so I basically came down came down to
the check-in I run to accept aches
forever I've been stood in line for
about an hour and a half went through it
got right to the front they said that
then said like oh we've got this new
machine you can try was like now I'll
just stick with that a new light
no no go try it was like do I have to
say hey cuz I find wait and tried it
machine didn't work for me I was like
Forge okay
it's crazy it's like for fuck's sake I
knew I should have gone to a person
rather than a machine and then
once I got that out the way and then I
took you again for an hour got through
and they were like you're absolutely
fine you've got a visa you can just walk
straight through I was like thank you
that's what I was expecting
nonetheless my us phone isn't working
right now because I didn't change my
credit card details on it so it didn't
fall or reduce so I can't use my phone I
can't order a taxi I have to go and try
and find one on the streets which is
totally fine
