a nice way to start the day a beautiful
man in a piano by that a men a man
playing a beautiful piano that kind of
sounded weird dungeon in New Zealand
Here I am
that's what I'm saying the fuck is shown
over there you're saying what the burger
shot it's not Viking over there
something so weirdly enough on my way to
Nando's I bumped into these fine fellows
although lads under they were like do
you want to go in an abandoned building
photography so the obvious answer to
that is fuck yeah
ah this is what I need in my life
Nando's immediately so I walked in I was
like I want a medium but by chicken meal
and they don't have medium but why
chicken look good but this is what they
have like beasts and they're like
grilled livers what the heck is this
stuff nothing you would know anything
and we don't have medium it's called my
own what I like how yesterday we were in
it ice cream power and there was a
pigeon and we're now in Nando's and
there's a fucking pigeon sweet what is
it with you guys in pigeons you're
scared of pigeons yes okay New Zealand
you melted my mind I went I there's a
totally different menu at Nando's I'm
going to show you because it's nothing
like it were like this was supposed to
be like a chicken breast I'm pretty sure
these bones in it you try to sneak in my
blog yeah I'm on to this guy doesn't he
look like he's like 25 or some
hallelujah
look at the size of it either way
peri-peri chips and then this boy behind
us four ribs check our places and you've
got chicken ribs what the actual fuck
that's so will you stop no just right
get out no damage no no no no all right
time to see what New Zealand's chicken
tastes but I can't see it being any
different unless it's a goddamn pig or
something but
I thought the sauce would have been the
exact same but it kind of tastes
different and it's not called medium
it's called my old nonetheless tasted
amazing boys will have to go in that
abandoned building a later day because
we need fuel get some stuff for the
matter oh we don't know what it is with
New Zealand people just obsessed with a
bit wait
Amazon not gonna lie that is kind of a
creepy mask yep ooh we got some fresh
new DCs don't like them don't like them
by the high-tops man I need to make some
like this than some high tops
I don't think he's a clothes things
about Spartans I want Spartans I'm not
gonna lie I'm not too sure what that
instrument is either way it's amazing I
feel like life is against me right now
I'm like stupidly tired and then hung
over at the same time and I'm we can
even drink that much last night so I'm
up dude I'm having like a Angelo leave
me alone I'm having like a confessional
on the couch it's not it's it I'm in a
therapy class right now cook come and
ask me questions I'll just be like life
is so hard I don't know how to exist
right now

in the store you know for the amount of
money I just pay for those shoes I
expect to be able to lie down in this
chart that's the really effective
restore we walk into they shop I sit
it's like the way this is happening
I measure the shoes and expand a t-shirt
to Ã¤ra sure to go out for this man

we have to see how this pans out no no
for me I'm just smart guy I don't waste
my energy stood up
I'm efficient I'm gonna fish in trouble
I sit i wait i prey on the weak odds
this is so run and there's just like a
like this is a big-ass financial
building and there's just like a toilet
attached to the side of it how weird I
may have been lying to you guys the
entire time we're not meeting the prime
minister of New Zealand we're meeting
the mayor of Los Angeles in New Zealand
weird I know we could've just met him in
LA but fine no I'm fine into bed fly all
