every day after a guard drinking it's
always bad day this is like heaven right
now and I got that chick-fil-a deliver
what you know what you know I'm also
watch your film called dope on Netflix
it's got like five star rating so giving
that a watching chilling out waffle
fries nuggets and a sandwich oh I got
sick of lying in bed all day so now I'm
in the path I'm so lazy today I've
literally done nothing apart from just
watch Netflix that is it I am continuing
the potato hair today
I've white showered twice just to be
freshened up put everything like yeah
I'll spike immensely but I'm just like
have all that these kind of days where
I'm just like Saran lay around doing
nothing just watching Netflix and
there's nothing for me to vlog I don't
know what to be like one minute longer
just nothingness so I'm thinking of
maybe throwing in like a Q&A throughout
it like not all dead professional or
anything like that not with it popping
up on the screen but just like literally
answering you guys questions is to find
out like check the tweet then reply to
you guys if you guys want that leave
like a bad Chinese food yes I always get
salt of chicken and in this town I've
got half a dog have the fucking dope to
myself I don't know how I'm gonna try
and eat this book thanks thanks thank
you wait thank you thank you
the very best I'm fine with this so I'm
gonna take this food get in my apartment
and I go continue watching that matrix
when I was on the plane flying over here
to LA I realized that I'm like the
classics section they had the matrix the
second one I don't really care about the
first time I've seen that much times I
was like yeah I watch it and I watch it
and I really managed to understand what
the hell is actually going on in the
matrix because most of time like you
know you watched movies a kid just like
cool action shooting yeah but I never
really realized quite what the matrix
was and like how in-depth is like the
Smiths of viruses and all this sauce
shit you know whatever the proper
terminology but it was like I really
have an understanding of what the fuck
is going on
so now that I'm going back through
watching him I'm watching this the third
one now I'm just like this is fucking
amazing so yeah that's basically what my
days consisted of sat in a very dark
room just watching The Matrix
with my razor
shit chroma just looking fucking dope
I'm probably gonna do a recap in about
like five minutes of how good the food
is and then again at the end of the
matrix so I will catch up with you
homies then also Casey nice cuts in
sound I really want to try and get
together with him and do something I
want to go to a beach more like and I
really really want to get to a beach
show I got try and see Ellen cases in
town fly probably tomorrow after the
Oscars because he's at the Oscars and oh
my God if I could organize something
with Casey to sneak into the Oscars like
somehow he slips his by Java window and
I sneak out sneak in another window like
I don't know if we could pull something
off it'd be fucking sick I'm trying to
work out what to drink
naked it's gone off sure it can go off
that fast
March away oh yeah I'll drink that
Chinese food and a naked drink I'm not
too sure that's a good combination
Paul's the fucking movie literally sat
down for five 14 seconds and Tom the
tear rip the bag open in the dark
thinking it would be in there and boom I
shot myself
shit myself I drop the fucking ducks
awesome this looks so wrong it looks
like a fucking murdered someone what a
waste as well it was nice warm hot sauce
on side no my my reground buying so many
donuts is quite high because I love
Donuts and the fact that I'm not going
to eat all then it just depresses me
like what a waste of fucking doughnuts
no one will waste the sauce I'm just
wasting my life away huh whoa whoa whoa
I was not expecting this at all this is
good
smells like crusty tea stains why are
your but my English is getting better
and better as the vlog goes on but I
always order pretty much two dinners cuz
in case one no you always pick the
didn't like like I know that's gonna be
good so he was getting one then I try
something new like that that fucking dog
guy and I hoped for and it was shit so
now it's to get to eat some good food so
some chicken pieces okay this looks good
but what the mother of tears is going on
with Madrid

gone off oh that math Davis is just not
going well for me is it spill the muddy
sauce drinks gone off I didn't like the
doc what else is gonna go wrong please
no fucking earthquakes or something I've
lived in this apartment now for about
four months and it took me falling over
over a suitcase that I had here into the
sink to realize that when I fell into
this and grabbed it this happens I had
no idea I had that built in not but I
need it or it's an advantage already saw
