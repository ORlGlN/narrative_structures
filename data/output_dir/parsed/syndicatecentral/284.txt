trip to doctors I've ever had in my life

time man

to drive you down there you go alright
let's get us home I was really not
expecting that to be that fast I even
saw it before I could even get my bump
on the seat on the chair I was done

pills there you go
in detection limit like this it licked
some strips of paper so now is day I

mom this morning because I was look till
5:00 a.m. watching house of cards and lo
and behold thank you
lo and behold she rang me 15 times to
wake me up outta bed like Tom Tom can't
get out of it and I just kept clicking

doctors if you miss it could be Palatka
listed from your doctors that's looking
great so I got up I like got a flowers
look at him he's like the best taxi
driver ever I guess it's time for some
breakfast it's a whopping 10:30 in the
morning
now that is it some
food and drink if I've ever seen hey a
guy looks like some out the army I hate
21 so much dust I'd stock up on a
sandwich we can also get a frame to
attach to the back of it it is now
half-past ten in Mon I'm strolling along
in the Sun if that terribly supposed to
be a beautiful day England write this
you me are not meant to be friends
I'm clearly destined not to eat this
damn sandwich but I do have my sandwich
and orange juice and chocolate bar in my
pocket and I'm starting today I might
just sit in the Sun and just bathe sorry
this is like a reservoir in here and
there's kids we all used to sneak over
the fence and stuff like that but I was
small enough so I could sneak underneath
that or maybe that I could squeeze
underneath there and go and play on the
river own facts with Tom we didn't try
no breaking an entry like these fools
have done oh no no I was Tom the ninja
is small midget next full fight with Tom
this is slay take a road where you
deliver my newspapers to this house all
these that house that house and that was
it this room every Sunday without fail
even if I was up till 6:00 a.m. playing
video games my friends on a Saturday
night having a sleepover or something I
would come for an hour deliver I think
140 to 160 newspapers get 15 quid and be
on my way and it was like I was like the
highest-paid newspaper delivery boy in
the entire area
whoo-hoo next on my tour I'm on high
craft I believe it's called high craft
but I'm gonna show you a job that the
Builder that me and my dad hand paved
brick paved block paved a drive to and
here it is every single one of those
blocks and that drive every single one
of them I took out because someone did a
bad job I took everything all of them
out with my dad stacked them there and
then replace them true story and 3/4 of
the way through the job my dad broke his
back so I could go back and help out
even more because he broke his back
and it couldn't like do all the bricks
himself so the guy I think it was Steve
Villa a Dave Miller seems to even or
super nice guy totally understood and
let me and my dad do the jobs in our own
speech if my dad's watching this is like
no no no did not well that was my
interpretation of a next film story
before I actually bought my house
that one right there I believe I think
it was that exact one I almost bought
mmm
almost bought it was going to extend it
over the garage and backwards because it
had a field on the backside loads of
room and stuff obviously the private
field but things would be attacking me
but I was going to buy that house then
the next day me my dad and my sister
were walking along my road and then
that's where we found my house before we
decided to buy it knock it down and
build a new one and alas I set off at
