was supposed to wake up this morning and
wake wake up and get get the day going
positive and end up waking up about like
1 o'clock late stuff walk up in a long
time in the States because the cleaner

coming up no it's like why don't you
clean yourself but we live in a house
before were people it's a lot of mess
and a lot of people OTT of time most the
guys don't like it mostly guys don't
like cleaning up after other people's
messes and right now as you guys know we
have a dog toca has a dog it's not my
dog I refuse to have anything to do with
it anymore and I stand by that thermal I
know it sounds mean but we have a dog in
the house you can see all in the corners
all on the floor this thing right here
this dog apparently is not supposed to
share it that right there is a big ball
of fluff from the dog and it's just in
the corners everywhere so the cleaner
was supposed to come but I don't even
know why I came down says oh they're
upstairs damn I just took clue well go
back upstairs or trouble or you can see

charges you get entered into an a
Playstation 4 or an Xbox one now we
don't know if they cut the console get

it's sold out everywhere pretty much and
the reason why I got this Xbox is thanks
to work 80 bongos from Xbox from
Microsoft so thank you very much for

reason why I'm saying this guy's is
because if you bought one already you're

right now I'm just rocking this this is
brand-new brand-new absolutely brand new
don't wash before Friday prior to me
have a little tag on the army I take
this bad boy but yeah guys I've been
busy I've been so busy I've been over to
MLG oh by the way if you're wondering
why about the dog and what this is
around my face this is a dog bite this
is why I said I don't like Griswald
Griswald is a Chow Chow right and a Chow
Chow is known for being a very wolf-like
dog to the point of where they don't
like other people they'll attach
themselves to one own and that trains
them that sort of thing are very very
few select people and you know we wick
said we accepted that fog in fact the
dog Oh is back to me didn't like me or
anything like that so it was like okay
we understand I'll try and win him over
so I was when him over with treats and
play with him with his toys and when
he's playing with me toys I ended up
getting bit you can see my nail looks
fucked up with a red dot on it yep
he bit my bitmap but that was like only
an acciden that was really only an
accident and yeah it's that getting
really friendly one night like he slept
on the end of my bed and it was just
like this is insane cuz truck wasn't
here I took it was away I think seeing
his girlfriend or something and he just
slept on the end of my bed I was like
this is brilliant the dog is really
adapting like whatever I walk around the
house he'd follow me around if I shout
at him he'd come down to me or anything
like that I'd tell him to like sit down
but that's it like pops two fingers
towards it likes it and he go sit down
you asked for a para get his paw that's
why I put the Instagram video unlike
look what he can do he's like a really
nice
now and then all of a sudden man like I
came back one night and I was talking to
Tucker and the dog dog growled at me the
top of stairs cuz it oh it always grows
like you walk up stairs it'll growl like
right now he's throwing a strop he's in
I think he's on the on the landing just
being loud but he'll always growl yeah
so I I walked to upstairs he grounded me
I was like oh stop growling anyway I
went into his room start talking to took
her the dog started playing with me I
was picking up the dog I held him like a
baby and he was just like that comfort
like chilled out anyway I left him
walked out the room and went sat down on
my phone outside in the hallway like
over heels reenact it so I came over
here and I was just sat here and I was
laying down just like just like this
I was just lay here like this and the
dog literally came from in Tucker's room
came and sat next to me and just like
sat in my lap and just let me and it was
just like looking at me for attention so
I just stroked him that gosh so cute and
I was there for about 10-15 minutes she
stroking him and I was just like looking
this way like looking out like towards
my room and I was just like daydreaming
about like what's going on because I
started took a like I've been doing so
much stuff and been so busy that like
I'm happy to be visit with the same time
like god I need to get out and have some
like serious serious fun soon and which
I did at weekend which was awesome
except you know energy Columbus but
anyway the dog just kind of like felt
like he's shifted I just like had my
hand on the back of him
and then he just like you kind of look
like he was like a maneuvering like to
shift and when he went to like shift he
just like a crocodile just like so I was
like this so you imagine my face here he
managed to like flick up his face
sideways almost and just go chump on the
side of my face and like just the front
teeth of them just went like that and
just dug into me so you can see I've got
these teeth marks in my face and this
one like this is healed now and that's
it nicely but this was like a little bit
longer so imagine if that would have bit
me like there and like dug into my shit
could have been seriously bad but
luckily it was okay so you know but
anyway I gave Tucker all the dogs treats
back Iram of I've got it on the dog it's
an untrustworthy dog in my opinion it
backs that strange is it back so you
know people it knows it doesn't it's
just not a friendly dog which which is
the breed of a type plus I've got
fucking pubes in my
fucking butt bedroom every which I don't
want and the pisses on my dog you know
he's just a troll is it patrol but
unfortunately I just I just had it with
him so I kind of just gave took all his
treats back his toys and was just like
listen I've given up with a dog maybe in
the future but right now I just don't
want to don't have anything to do with
the dog I'm not looking after it not
even anything like that
your dog your responsibility I'm having
nothing to do with it because I've got
two dogs in the past all of them super
friendly look after him I think we've
even kind of heard of a dog right now
called Milo and he's super awesome he
said Jenna energetic as fuck but he's
just a really cool dog and unfortunately
the Griswold just isn't is just a really
negative nasty dog really and you know
he's really can be nice but at the end
of day he's an animal
he's a dog you can't you can't trust him
dogs can just snap like that and just go
fucking haywire rip everything to share
bought home I've given up with him yes
he is still popping six months old I
like seven eight months old now listen
to my eyeball oh no we've had him that
long now without him can't be can't be
six months all I'm I always think he's
got be like ten and told us in four
eleven but we weren't in that long now
that he stars and adapted to us in the
house a lot me even oh just what I did
though the poem was he adapted to us and
then he just flipped again and just like
being like whatever but then yeah guys
I've been keeping busy and what can I
say about the Xbox one it takes a hell
of a long time to install games on it
different playing four so far looks
amazing ghost just seems really bad to
be honest like not the game itself the
quality of it I don't know I know he's
the whole 720 1080 P thing but the game
just doesn't look good it doesn't I
don't understand that swear it looks
better on Xbox 360 than it does an Xbox
