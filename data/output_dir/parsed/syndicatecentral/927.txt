all right well we have news and things
that's gonna happen you guys have been
asking for ages is that a dick on the
fridge yes it is made at my craft box
and going swiftly on to Michael block
see how did that transition I've decided
I want to play Minecraft there's been so
many times where I just jump on and I
quickly make a little house or I'll piss
about something like that and it's you
know it's fun and I love it and I'm like
what's the point in this it's just it's
just stupid I shouldn't be doing it not
because any other reason but it makes me
feel like I should be recording I should
be live-streaming but there's never a
point to me actually recording it you
know all like what am I gonna do with
that I've done so many of a little
miniseries because I just want to play
and do something to have fun but the
most thing I've realized at the moment
is that like playing Minecraft with
other people it's as simple as that
I love playing Minecraft with others and
right now I'm in America and I'm living
in a house with toker and was a poser
who loved gaming and they like Minecraft
and they were to play it so what I'm
gonna do and what I decided is that
we've created a server and the world is
called my night like that that's the
realm we're gonna live in the realm of
my and I and I've said this a long time
like I was gonna make like a Minecraft
project that was gonna be you know
multiplayer people now what you kind of
see like that but at the same time don't
because the problem what I was doing the
micro project and why I was getting
bored of it is because they had a
20-minute slide that was how long the
video is supposed to be like 10 to 15 15
to 20 minutes long and when I was trying
to do is I've trying to cram everything
into that one section and it just took
too long you know and I had to rush and
I didn't have to do crazy edit until I
do I wanted to make a fun episode I do
that so what I've decided is that and
we'll try and stream deley which will be
8 p.m. in the UK which is kind of a
little bit late but it means it's 12
noon in that way so we're going to try
and do and I know it's a bit late
standing now but it's really stream me
and took a plane on this and we'll be
doing I like our own commentary and we
can speak to each other we'll just have
push-to-talk so if we're close to each
other we can chat we can a fun weekend
adventures and what I'm gonna do is in
the stream on you know twitch.tv for
which the syndicate me just playing
minecraft they'll make a house and make
a realm and you can just do whatever you
want so if I wanted to come with
Tucker and destroy stuff I could go and
destroy this stuff now he could get
pissed up about it and he can come and
destroy my stuff and we can then just
make it so it like a war like a routed
between us and stuff like that and that
could just happen but I also brought the
fact if you know not just being me and
took not just a series because it's not
a series it's not so let's play it's
just guys having fun or you know playing
on a server and playing Minecraft which
is an awesome game
just messing about with it you know
coming up with new and fun stuff to do
in it and you know when I'm streaming I
get to take yours guys suggestions and
tell me what I should do what I
shouldn't do and all that sort of stuff
you know it should be really cool and I
brought a pizza car today to scene and
as I was like listen I just want to play
games on a plane a server you know a set
time nearly every day and if I can like
stick to a schedule of every day you
know how jobs are played you know I've
taken as an everyday schedule jumping on
it and playing and just have fun with it
and Adams said I'm totally down for it
so like we could have Adam see now
there's him come and join in on him
streaming from his twitch perspective
and then him turn is you know what items
content like he turns it's like a
three-minute video of like the best bits
and stuff like that now whereas people
prefer on my channel like the long haul
of it which you know it's perfect and if
people prefer I cut mine up then we can
cut mine up as well but the way we see
it is streaming then putting the content
on YouTube for people to be enjoy
afterwards if they haven't seen it so
people get to interact with the stream
have fun you know just really enjoy it
and then the concerts on YouTube
afterwards so that you could have me and
Jericho we're gonna play you know took
it all over that moment and that's how
we're gonna do it but then like you'll
have Adam seen on as you can come and
play like you know if he's not playing
Minecraft in forever and it's changing
he could literally play it like a let's
play I used to do in the past but he
could also look at this another thing is
you can just mess about and see how
things go and create together and make
content for his channel which you will
do you know he's good understand like
YouTube people want content for the
channel and that makes sense but I wanna
be able to play but I also want to keep
people happy on my channel now the way I
want to keep people on my happy on my
channel is by live streaming as well I
want to be able to tell them to come to
Twitter to watch my content and be like
I just watch the stream because it's
still me it still comment still
syndicate and just want to play games I
really do but the thing is I don't want
to play these games and be like I'm
doing the same thing over and over again
I don't know minecraft you do the same
thing over again you go get back to do
this but every game you know you go kill
something you respawn you do that you do
the same thing but I want to just play
that the sake of playing that's what I'm
getting sick of doing not you know it's
sick of not doing playing for the sake
of playing cuz the end of the Micra
project like I was playing so I was
having fun at the start of it and even
when to feed the beast up and like it
was new stuff it was fun and I had new
stuff to do but then it was like I'm
gonna go and bake make a bakery why am I
gonna bake a bakery what's the point
that I'm not gonna do anything to it or
is if I made Baker a key then Trey took
a like a you can buy something okay -
give me some diamonds I'd be hooked up
and we can use it like an actual proper
currency or something like that or if we
use two emeralds or whatever but you
know it could actually work if we're in
if we wanted to are eventually we could
work with the the guys from what's it
called Mali cube and week
get like mods built into the service or
like we could actually create a currency
sorry you'll need to buy this you can
buy this for this much and make a shop
for it and stuff like that like stuff
that I've always where it's doing a
minecraft server and with your guys if
it you know like comments and
suggestions in the stream week it up you
know potentially put it into this you
know like will that we played and it's
like vast and wide we can do what
everyone so mean took we're gonna start
that today I'm gonna start streaming
like maybe like a few minutes our thing
with Tucker like your BL two heroes
talking together it start and if you
don't he was talking not just black you
know me just put on my arm because
people want it you know not just hear
someone talking over them at the same
time so that's why we live push-to-talk
so I face close to Mac and it's like you
know Daisy when I go up someone I can
press talk speak to and then go and do
my own thing so we can just interact
with our own streams at once and then we
don't actually hear like if he's
planning something I can't tell he's
like oh yeah I should go and do this to
Tom because I can still hear in the
inside time whereas push-to-talk can so
we're gonna start playing today I'm
going to play for about an hour two
hours you never know we might even play
for like six seven hours and then I post
this up on my channel like one big video
if it gets too long and you know I have
to cut it up then I have to clear up but
I'm not going it up into 20 minute parts
I'm gonna make him like if I see you for
a long amount of time I'm probably gonna
put it up for a long amount of time now
I know that everyone's gonna go watch
like a seven hour video on YouTube in my
blog what's the point book we want
people to kind of see it as a journey of
like you know the minecraft project like
how that was like people tuned in
watched it and stuff like that and they
never really watched it live but when I
watched it live people loved it so what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna play
games I'm gonna play minecraft stream it
at a set time which is hopefully gonna
be 8 p.m. in the UK and 12 noon in the
US that's for LA time so if you know you
have to work out what that is for you
so in LA it's could be 12 and just go
stream it have fun and then post it and
maybe if I'm back in the UK I can then
you know adjust the time so saying we
were streaming 6 o'clock or I find
another server whereas like when I'm in
the u.s. we'll play with the US guys if
we're playing the UK play with UK guys
doesn't matter we can work it out you
know we can work out these details and
see what you guys say but that's how I'm
seeing this happening now what I'm gonna
do is just play minecraft stream it and
then post the content on my youtube
channel I still got a new series that's
coming with optic and that will be a
consistent series if you want to watch
it you can do it'll still be there for
you guys but we just need to get around
to doing it whilst this has been made
the reason why there's been no videos is
because I've been waiting for this
game-mode to be created to me and you
guys to play but it's get a bit complex
a bit like ok this is what we got to do
but when I'm playing Minecraft not just
if you have to play it like a game like
do this go to do that go fight dragon
that's the end of it when I'm just
playing half bunny like this often
youtubers that like keep series going
forever where they play with other
people and because they've got other
people to play with they can incorporate
more fun random adventures it's like
saying go and play you know Garry's Mod
on your own you want as much fun if you
go and play with ten other people so
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna play
with other people on the server and just
have fun shenanigans and that's gonna be
that so if you guys wanna join me on
this go to twitch.tv forward slash
syndicate make sure you click that
folder button make sure you stay tuned
with the content that's gonna be posted
there and I'll stream it and the way
we're gonna do it if you know like
content wise but if you want to stay
interact with it is will stream one day
and then that day's footage will be
posted on the YouTube channel the next
day so I've got a stream know video that
day content you know the next day after
that and then after that's that contents
gonna I'll immediately stream after that
so it's polite okay so as soon as a
video hits your soap box is basically at
12 you know straight below it that I'm
streaming so you can catch the next
episode so like if you want to watch it
live you can watch it live every single
day but if you don't want to watch it
live that you can just watch the VOD
whenever you want you know like the next
day or the day after that day after that
and hopefully it should be really fun
then we can bring in some of your
favorite youtubers if you want I know we
both like bring son on the island people
can leave you know it's whatever it's
not like a strict you must play on this
server you must stream every day but
we're gonna try and hopefully stream
daily and stick to a routine where you
guys can tune in interact because I want
to be going like doing honey Nazi
imagine if we the opposite guys say they
want to come on the server the optic
guys can come in jump on the server it
gives them space they can go and do
whatever you want and Ravel is having to
hunt each other down we can just have
fun on this server bring in really fun
personalities together and just play
Minecraft and playing games for the sake
of playing games that's what we want to
do so you never know I'll speak to the
up two guys now and see if they wanted
you up on the server as well and just
stream have fun and enjoy it and you
never know people might do it but the
way William took we're gonna be doing it
is that content is gonna be you know
light ball play posting tight content
because even when we did the 2v2 is way
back with ops if people wait the entire
video on their channel so that's pretty
much what I'm gonna do so if you want to
like your favorite youtubers to jump on
this then hopefully down the line we can
do it but for now we're gonna keep it
small and see how it progresses and
that's how things are gonna roll so guys
wanna thank you for watching if you
liked the idea of it then come and watch
me on Twitch or leave a comment below
and yeah I guess I'll see you guys when
I'm streaming and we'll just have some
fun
gets crate in your house crate New World
 like that and we can just
around if my house gets burnt down then
 it gets burned down and you just go
deal with it and hopefully we won't get
too mad at each other like if someone
steals our diamonds and I probably go
upstairs and fight took her about it boy
that's what I'm gonna do guys so I hope
you support me but with this if you do
leave like rain subscribe and I'll see
you guys on Twitch see you later
