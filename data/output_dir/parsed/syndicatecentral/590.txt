right there with you Han I'm right there
with you my love and pleasure
it'll happen Hey get home safe guys much
look to the homies Oh a great night out
with the homies I still can't believe
that when I come home I've got a ray gun
like a real rope okay I didn't even know
that it would we work I thought I was
like a prop it's utterly real so I'm
even more impressed oh my god I don't
know how but for some reason I fell
asleep in my bed after getting back at
my alarm on my phone went off at like
four o'clock in the morning oh my god I
am so tired like how's it like deep
sleep time to the point where I could
wake up like 12 hours later but
nonetheless guys I'm really really
really tired I'm going to bed I'm sorry
things seemed all over the place today
we're vlogging both it was really really
really really weird day I woke up at
like 7 o'clock in afternoon instead my
day but yes it's 4 o'clock in morning
because I woke up at 7 p.m. today I
decided that it was a great idea to get
in bed watch Game of Thrones and he
noodles fuck
don't worry time with Tom all right so
you see this light we're gonna go close
to it and you're gonna listen you hear
it can hear
some of fun because it's like circulate
in the air in the bathroom to keep the
air fresh or moving or something or
other there's a scientific reason for it
or there's the reason for it in general
but it's annoying the tits out of me and
I found out a way to stop it
now the way to stop it is to flick off
this switch here tada
it turns off but by doing that yeah I
killed all the power in the entirety of
my apartment you might be like just
switch it back on well yeah let's go
ahead and switch this back on real quick
that light turns on but we're gonna go
in here real quick
real smooth and we're trying to enter
the light on in my apartment oh my god I
have completely balls drop my part oh it
works laughter admit I just did this one
second ago and it was like fuck it's
broke I'll record this and show my
failure but I guess I guess I didn't
break the entirety of the building I
just wrote my kitchen fuck wait one way
or another this one switch managed to
flick itself are the lights on oh they
wait what the are kind of on with the
light dimming and warming themselves
I was actually genuinely worried that I
like short fuse my entire buildings like
electrical supply somehow by just
flicking a circuit breaker but other
than that I think it fixed it now and
again it's 7 o'clock in the morning I'm
going to bed so this is probably the
best birthday gift I've ever been given
in my life just to realize that this is
a 100% custom-made now I know we said in
weather that it's a prop from one of
their live shots they did and I didn't
realize how custom 8 was because it like
it shoots and makes noises I was like oh
it looks legit seems legit but then if
you pay attention that like focus that's
like a board pin that you stickings like
a cabinet or something and everything
else is just bits and pieces stuck on to
it I genuinely thought this was a real
real Raygun suite to be a genius and to
help solve my sleeping problems by
watching TV shows I was gonna watch the
entirety of the new season of Game of
Thrones season 6 but instead I decided
screw it I just watched the last episode
and ruin the entire series for me I know
I miss out on a lot but I just cannot
commit to another TV show like I
don't Vikings because I will never be
able to sleep so I watched episodes
episode sex fuck I watched the season
finale of season 6 it was awesome it was
cool it was badass
great story gamer friends awesome I just
cannot commit to any more TV show so I'm
going to bed
thank you very much for watching I hope
you guys are awesome and having a great
day and I'll catch you guys tomorrow for
my next daily vlog where am i doing
anything tomorrow I don't think so I
think I'm going to try and make gaming
videos all day so main channel videos
there might be more on the way soon
