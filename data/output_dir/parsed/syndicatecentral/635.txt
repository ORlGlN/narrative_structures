it is a new dawn it is a new day we were
going down thank God there was no one in
there otherwise that we've been very
awkward it is the day where I think I
actually have another make-a-wish thing
to do I'm about to confirm it now with
Hilary but I'm pretty sure I'm doing
another make-a-wish today so that's
gonna be absolutely epic not too sure
what we're doing who on me in all it's
about Bohr it's gonna be a pleasure
nonetheless we meet again again two days
in row what is this shit
not acceptable Hillary Hillary you can
tell the world what's happening with the
Make A Wish yes we're gonna speak to him
today on the phone just to say hello to
his face yeah and then we're gonna
reorganize the trip and we're gonna make
something epic happen yeah fist bump
yeah she's like the the wish fairy fish
the fish fairy what I will definitely
agree to that fact Hillary just pointed
something very important how there is no
traffic right now you jinx distillery
this is all you but you know what sin is
though oh my god Wow amazing actually do
a big shout a bunch of people right now
cuz citizens stuck in traffic I got some
shoutouts that I need to do for the

mainly the prize your campaign so thank
you so much much look this this is the
love heart you need to fill in the rest
of it
then we can become one together ah
emotions and we're back at Universal
where they plant as many flowers as they
can in a city that has no water and is
in a drought Universal City I so badly
want to go to the Wizarding World of
Harry Potter hmm do we know anyone at
Universal even let me sneak in do we
know anyone do I want to see it we
finally made it in it to Universal
Studios I don't know what we'll see I
don't know what I won't be able to film
but I haven't signed any contracts that
says I can't so we got our stage three
over there and we're heading to a Stage
four I I know it's a weird counting it
goes 20 to 16 three no four so maybe we
should just steal a golf cart and just
explore who made it Warcraft global
junket here we go we're going in here
Stage four I guess oh my goodness sake
okay I totally don't know what to expect
while we're here I feel like a kid he's
like going into another universe oh my
god oh my goodness this is all so badass
that is quite possibly the coolest ever
I've ever seen in my life the King's
armor is it real I'm not supposed to
touch upon their touch it Oh sick well
this is like nerdgasm Central right now
damn Daniel this is why things like this
are awesome because you want chocolate
bats we got chocolate you wants to have
this we got it sweets food fruit popcorn
what is this you got everything
wait what is this what is underneath
this damn it alright I filled up but you
know a lot of stuff and now I'm just
gonna show you like a cool montage of
everything even though I don't edit so
it's not exactly a montage of editing
it's like here we have horses here we
have shields we have swords here we have
a big-ass dude it's how I do thumbnails
ready I could point the camera I stand
still when I'm at that click the photo
button in the bottom right hand corner
and there's my thumbnail for the day
pretty sick right not sure if I can pick
these up or not I'm gonna do it anyway I
got so much merchandise coming out for
it look at ah these are gonna be in my
collection look at this one this one's
definitely the best one but without a
doubt it's my favorite character it was
it was emotional to say the least like
come on look how realistic this oh this
makes sense could be Madame Tussauds but
look look at this holy snap that looks
so realistic right in the movie it
looked it looked uncannily unreal like
it was kind of freaky really really
freaky but seeing this in person now is
just like someone could actually know
you know when the room item two sides
and to pretend they're fake but then
they're actually real I'm expecting this
to jump out at me and scare me it's all
good I'm gonna be very disappointed if I
can't walk away from this event without
stealing a set of armor at least I was
just saying this right now I should have
brought like one two three I should have
brought six people with me and I could
have just got drunk up here and thrown
like the most amazing party of friends I
we could have had TV in the middle or a
land so up everyone's like these epic
gaming seats but no can I sit on there
yeah I was expecting like an epic throne
chair not gonna lie
instead I get this wooden little uh
little chair you know you just ruled the
castle from up here it's quite kind of
lonely kitty right now he's just
sneaking me into every but oh no what is
this okay that that is see that is what
I was expecting in there I was like the
where's the throne drink that that is
what you call a throne
this was the chair I was expecting
earlier in the other room this oh man
this record spend my life this oh this
is cosy we got today what is it what is
this wait why have I got a microphone no
I was gonna say thank you very much
that's how we do it you don't go in
there and do proper interviews you go
there and just go behind the scenes
sneak you to places you're not supposed
to be in and then hopefully not get
caught so I think we're gonna get away
with this one boys I blinked for like
one minute and Hillary comes back with
is this mine
keep it taking this with me I'm taking
this a sword and a shield and no wait
the guys from walk off you're gonna see
this okay maybe not alright now we've
sneaked into the next set well this this
is where I'm supposed to be sat like I'm
suppose we sat there interviewing people
from the movie but instead I was just
like I just want to sneak on the set and
just film it you've got the beginning
all the swords I was trying to work out
what the hell this is right yeah got
sword thought was cool but like what is
this is it a toe is that the foot or
something itself like a peregrinus um I
don't know even quite sure
now you got all the spoils in the
background as to what's going on in the
film hopefully it doesn't give anything
away outside yet all plastic weapons and
inside here
these ones are metal what I can't sit
down I'll interview Hillary whilst I
hold my big ass
actually really heavy and just like that
were wrapped at the Warcraft set
obviously took a free t-shirt they
wouldn't let me steal any swords and
they wouldn't let me steal any armor and
then they wouldn't let me steal any
props so that's quite upsetting so you
know what fuck'em I'm stealing a stone
awesome pleasure checking out the walk
upset I'm a movie just look at that way
she was ridiculously good-looking woman
just throw that eye right now you guys
want to check out the film it's coming
out May 30th in the UK because we're the
best we get things earlier from the US
June 10th
so they go for your faces that was
awesome and I will definitely be back
picking loud noses I'll definitely be
back sneaking around some more sets in
the future so bring it up whoa
turn right up to Vine Street the land of
the stars well I just decided now guys
because of the travel arrangements and
plans and stuff that I've got doing in
Zealand I was supposed to be going over
to Australia but what I'm gonna do is
we're just gonna go to New Zealand for
10 days not mess about we travel and we
just can't stay in New Zealand for 10
days and travel all around New Zealand
and then go back to Australia a later
date and want to go back at a later date
then travel around all of Australia
because we'd only end up up in four days
in Australia like due to the plan so
sorry to my Australian homies but
hopefully we can raise the hype to me
returning next time so I'm sorry about
that but New Zealanders I'm coming and I
think the first place I'm going to is
Auckland so I'll see your faces there
and I'll announce soon the details of
the meetups we're gonna be doing so
looking forward to meeting your faces
because I fly tomorrow it's good to be
back with good people but the best
person in the world
good buddy dude have you been dude's
been like surgery he's gonna get in
laser eye surgery so it changes yeah
we're taking a step back from all that
craziness and meet trouble in the world
and still just kick back together and go
and watch Civil War I'm thinking of nine
I'm thinking nine it may get a 9.5 I
hope so I just have to try it this seems
like the most dangerous thing are we if
they put anti-slip stuff on it don't
works just very very slowly known as
dramatic as I was expecting round two
let's do this all right yeah they put an
e on each slide stuff on it it doesn't
matter it will still work just think
like thoughts
think like thoughts it's like taking a
really slow escalator what the fuck
right okay so Avengers Civil War I'm
giving it a 9 out of 10 just because it
was such a nerdgasm film so many epic
points it was just really fuckin badass
the airport fight scene was insane the
stuff that happened was insane hey what
was that for you what's that for
Deadpool for me that was like a 9.5 dude
Deadpool was so far what do you give it
weight you give that film said aha eight
seven okay okay I'm going that way dude
holy shit like it's just the ending of
it was a bit like a yeah and then the
after scenes credit if I had to be fair
the after scenes credit should have been
in the main film and it brings it down
by point so I would actually give it an
eight point nine I want to get it I
solidly will give it a nine if they
didn't fuck up that end credit because
that end credit should have been the
movie hands-down
so yeah good movie I definitely
recommend seeing it like if you're into
all them sort of films and fuck yeah so
I think Spiderman was a fucking best
Spiderman was hands down the fucking
best Oh single thing yeah I like totally
did it like a new twist on it like I'm
sick of seeing all the origins shit I
like
yeah that's wrong one of the things
wrong with Superman versus Batman oh my
god the entire origins I thought was
fucking terrible so yeah there you go
eight point nine point nine that's good
I'm giving it then all right
that's my wrap and hey I'll see you in
about two weeks cause I'm going to New
Zealand whoa
these two are having a fight down here
sir with a they're having a fight with a
chair and a stick okay
just another day in Hollywood just walk
it to me but I was like it's someone
like joking here and like this guy I
think he started to tuck it in with a
fishing rod and a chair I'm not quite
sure I'm not gonna sit down there and
