hello from everyone in the vlog hello I
was like hello hello and this person
over here syndicates boss thank you very

not even watching the suit looks I don't
really care about football and American
football and I'm just opening cases and
wish me luck for a knife listen to how
stoked I sound right now Mike yes we're
gonna get knives and knives and knives
but most likely I'm going to open to
June 8 cases and not get a single knife
so I will see you guys probably halfway
through but I'm extremely disappointed I
haven't got a knife and I've wasted
probably about 400 British pounds this
is a terrible idea
yo this could be a knife no at least we
got supernovae look at this hi Paul holy
shit do these subscribers giving the
height wallet there's me down there
about 26,000 people up in here and this
height wall is so stronk this is for the
army of armies were spinning it and
let's hope middle pretty share that
month let's hope this could be a knife
oh my god it's just serenity but look at
this look at this hype wall still by the
way still streaming up in streaming now
for light and I've been opening cases on
csgo for nearly two hours how many keys
have I got left I got 55 keys left I
think I've got by like another 50 to
actually open all of them but just look
at this pig bit that you've ever
subscribing and this height wall is just
beautiful this is what being part of the
- look at this kneeling on 2.4 million
followers this is what being part the
twitch community is all about the height
wall you know what I'm gonna make get a
whole list of emoticons I'm gonna get a
an eyes I'm gonna make like focus on

get some good Reds however I'm now gonna
try one of the berry bus drinks what's
inside this one five black bridge for us
bridge four strawberries three apples
and half a banana this sounds pretty
good damn tasty however combining it
with a chocolate doughnut and chips and
the fact that this has how many grams of
sugar 49 grams of sugar is pretty
fucking ridiculous so either way high
stream high chair I hope you all doing

put my gold and this is just the
weirdest Mack Nolan's I think I've ever
drove through like the guy on on the
other side of the operating thing was
like what would you like to drink at to
eat I was like named it did he not sound
like he was high yeah we just didn't
even know what was going on right now is
just weird as fuck so also I guess no
one works here we just have to go in
there ourselves and make the food hello
the wizard I would totally right now be
love to be like oh my god I'm so drunk I
just like can't even handle this boy
once at ichinose can't even Ovilus right
now but I'm so sober it's fuckin eat she
knows what's goin on
it's ridiculous I've got my goals I'm a
dr. pepper because I'm just really
really hungry I've got food in your pump
I could cook I was like yeah let's go
there I was like it's fast food they
took 45 minutes 45 minutes to order the
food I can eat chinos again what is
going on to order the food through the
drive-thru and get it mean the uber
driver could not believe it like we were
having a go of it the McDonald's what a
fuckin Dhulia life but either way it's
been a it's been a good night it was
really really random I really appreciate
the guys letting us up to the house and
stuff but it was just really random yeah
there might be asked me like Tom why was
it really random it just it just felt
really odd because like I'm used to
hanging out with like people like my age
I'm 22 I'm not olden likes any fucking
aspect of that but like out tonight if I
had to like categorize an age group of
people being around us it seemed like
young girls who were like 60
into 18 year olds they might not have
been might have been all that I don't
look like Oh like a 12 year old but it
just felt really odd I just can't put my
finger and I like it just felt kind of
uncomfortable like you know speaking to
people I was like you look like you're
about 12 can I see your ID
before I even get speaking to you not in
the in a weird sense but just it was
just kind of odd so that's how the night
kind of progressed for me to be honest
like it was nice to hang out everyone
nice to meet Joe nice to be cast the
first time Casper is a fucking great guy
absolute love that guy and yes I'm
totally getting unchanged whilst I'm
vlogging here boy yeah you just can't
find out kind of strange I've oven not
really been in many situations like
where I go to a pint I'm just like this
feels weird
I actually felt too old to be somewhere
even though the people who hosted the
pie were like my age and the people I
knew were at my age but everyone else
who was random they're just like like 12
year old even though they were they were
like of age but it just felt kind of
running so kind of felt bit out of place
tonight strange but true and yeah I'm
gonna get some food in me and just die
in bed success either way in was German
I'm going to bed it is currently hmm 4
o'clock in the morning Jesus Christ I
need to get up early tomorrow as well
it's 4 o'clock in mind I'm going to bed
thank you very much for watching today's
vlog if you enjoyed it clear that like
button subscribe you see more random
chitchat Hannigan's from my face did
