out and then we need to cue the high
school musical we're all winners
together all right this is happening and
cleaning out this room and then I'm boot
using this desk and I'm setting up we
got a spare screen get up my laptop I've
actually got to raise a laptop so we
should be good to go but let's do this
all right all right so this is the
sketchiest setup you've ever seen we got
this plastic ass desk that I'm probably
gonna break separ up this last time I
was here and we've got this monitor
rock-and-rolling I've got my laptop
which is factory setting because I did
something too I did something to the
same so we just won't talk about that I
have a standardized microphone because I
left my razor mic at home and that's
just what it is and I need to find a
mouse mat because I forgot to bring mine
you know what I don't think I did a bad
job I found everything I needed to be
able to livestream okay like the cables
and stuff lying around the house
perfectly made up to make a streaming
cell so this is my laptop over here
which I use for my screen to light read
my twitch chat read everything that I
need like my OBS then I play the video
games on here
I found a webcam lying around I found a
microphone this is my mouse found a
totally non different sponsored mouse
mat sponsored by Razer by the way and I
found this bad boy and then I run out a
USB in my laptop so I was like oh my god
the hell I'm going to try and use like
my webcam my mouse my keyboard you know
so I could extend it away because the
fan does make quite a lot of noise
comply to this microphone so I was like
right and need to find something to
extend it and as I was looking for a
pile of wires
I found an extended baby so you know
what my setup for the next like 10 days
at the optic house ignore the blowtorch
is looking pretty good one more time I
spend in this room the more and more I
want to create the ultimate gaming self
at this house like the ultimate gaming
self it was so goddamn cool so imagine I
can be able to livestream on a projector
like house sick but trying to fly h1z1
and I want to play in like full-screen
windowed mode something so I'm waiting
for a ginger ninja to come running
through this door any minute now and I'm
in it now I'm gonna sit here waiting
with a blowtorch on fire oh hey what you
doing man you know how to do this your
champion I won't i won't i won't burn
your life blink 10 times thank you very

just up still at it in the grind is real
a test livestream turned into a two-hour
h1z1 session I came highs plate 10th
with 5 kills hich has disappeared so
much human he's gone to bed I'm tempted
to just stay awake like I know it's
really not good for me but seeing as oh
I fell asleep at 4 o'clock till 11:00
I was supposed to stream the DLC from
the PlayStation you know for the new
college Yui but unfortunately I just
couldn't do it like absolutely good that
it didn't work I was just really I was
really really angry and pissed off to be
honest because like everyone was
expecting out at all the wrong is going
to do it and then I tried it just failed
so it's nice to have my setup now I've
got like a mini set up streaming H ones
you want it's perfect for just streaming
each was you want no console games or
anything like that but it's perfect for
that so I'm going to keep it like this
stream whenever I need to stream and we
should be ready to rock and roll so
