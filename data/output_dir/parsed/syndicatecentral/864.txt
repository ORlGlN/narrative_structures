it is a dastardly find day today in the
world of England
my dad has cleaned up the outside area
for me to be able to have my friends
over tomorrow and this is looking great
finally got the back garden leveled out
and yeah just looking like less bumpy
and stuff and then I'm gonna get all
turfed so it just looks nice and clean
and fresh and awesome and this is all
looking nice the hot tub now is stupidly
hot and toasty so that's gonna be epic
forever and it's just perfect absolutely
perfect this is exactly what I want you
in the house this is exactly exactly
what I wanted so happy you see that
glass banister there that's getting
installed there as well so it's gonna
look proper proper kimball supposed to
be recording until dawn but I just
couldn't resist getting in and this this
is why I put the hot tub here because
this may look this is exactly what this
is about right now Zen as fuck
call me right yesterday if you're not
saying but would you just look look
ah that's exactly what I needed
now I just want to go and get better and
fall asleep from that relaxed let's play
so it's time to find some hidden energy
inside me cuz I'm so relaxed sent me a
package
regardless what's inside you open
yourself no energy
Dave felt like the day to get a Couric
now I was gonna start recording the
let's play but I've kind of put it on
pause just because I'm here waiting for
it to get nighttime because I don't
start the recording in the daytime and I
will really get into the zone with
playing the game and I'm really happy
that my hair is growing back and I sound
like I went totally bald which is not
the case but now I'm just really really
happy so don't worry I'm not driving on
the public road
I'm currently my driver I bought well
going as I'm curious let's go
I told you it was occurring that tonight
and I'm back with this guy again always
I always see him every time today and
did I speak to you on the phone yeah he
knew I knew it was him and he thought it
was me and now I'm here
well yeah you know this whole daily vlog
do you think I'm supposed to vlog if
wanted daily vlog and it's now currently
two o'clock in the morning and I have
not recorded anything I got in the hot
tub I came upstairs and I've played
until dawn I'm gonna all rendering out
now and when I say all of it the thing
with a let's play is I don't want to try
and make it like I record like a few
episodes and then I leave it for like
two long everyone's like where's the
next pot like I want to get it all done
and then post it on YouTube so if it's
in parts it doesn't matter this
pre-recorded it doesn't matter I bought
oh my god until dawn is epic I get the
shit scared out of this if you guys are
looking forward to something awesome
but let's play my channel will be Stine
probably like next week so stay tuned
for that
side note this may look like I'm just
watching the video about some little
kids filling some work but no wait for
this track to drop the beat my friend
just send me this and
pretty damn Incredibles called cranes
okay
that's the Vimeo link there you want to
go to it and like he just once come on
come on
I'm gonna make the decision of it's not
a good thing when you're fucking Sonier
inch TV is spastic 18 it's it's tough
right now oh god please tell me it's
just all these teach tomorrow goo boo
aha
oh wait no is it is it no cable no HTML
cable fixed problem solved problem
solved problems are you look at this
domestic Thomas domestic Tom don't worry
about the squeaking I'm not like choking
your hamster that sounds like a sexual
term I don't like that but no I've I'm
like being domesticated and cleanly
doctor all the shit around my house I
had my cleaners come like two days ago
and my house is already filthy oh I
could tell you at least one thing Tom
does indeed recycle her swaggin I
actually find it very fitting for
today's vlog to be much shorter than
yesterday's because yesterday's was like
23 minutes long which is pretty good
down ridiculous for a vlog book
it was a super long gap from 6 a.m. to
like what what was it like - Pete 2 a.m.
in the morning so it makes sense for
yesterday to be a stupidly long vlog
whereas today I only got out of bed at
like 4 o'clock away what time it was so
it makes sense for today to be a shot
boy but I'm gonna put this out to you
guys right now if anyone knows that
artists of that song I was just playing
called King right anyone knows them on
the off-chance happens to know someone
who knows someone oh no someone to get
in touch of them and ask them if I can
use their music like just tell them to
hit me up on Twitter mother it's the off
chat I don't think it's gonna happen but
if we can make this happen and we can
get in touch with them because I would
love to use their trap to live my live
streams and in my videos but I just need
permission off them otherwise I can get
trouble but go check out the shit
absolutely love that music and I am now
going playing splatoon at 2 in the
morning because that's the responsible
adult
I am like OMG is ally a totes forgot
that I'm supposed to be unboxing this to
show you guys what's in it I just have
no idea what it is and I've always
enjoyed unboxing stuff and I don't know
what it is wide in front of you guys the
specific something
stupidly pathetic then you get to see my
genuine reaction and if it's something
epic you get some a genuine reaction so
let's take a look it's probably
something that I just completely forgot
I ordered but let's take a look anyway I
genuinely don't know what it is I I
opened one box today and it was my a via
media saying I had one guess I had one
guess what it could be you guys now
decide in the comments what it could
possibly be guess anything and a clue
it's gaming related oh my goodness it's
Christmas come early we have got a
Deathstalker chroma keyboard we have got
a chroma Firefly mousepad we have got a
razor Mamba chroma tournament edition
and we have got what I've been waiting
for for ages by ages I mean like three
days a dar√≠o wireless speakers now a
headphones because headphones remember
than ones that I wear to my PC like the
big knives company ones like I was from
the phase a website and I was like they
do a wireless version so I made them
sell me right while I was virgin I just
like I go on the website and I'm I I
wrote that one that one that one and
they're like okay so yeah I got myself
hooked up with these if I can ask them
I'm gonna be cool about this and I'm
gonna see if I can give a set of these
away I'm gonna give them a fair test if
I like them I'll use them if you don't
like them we'll use them that's just
basically how I knew everything in my
fault the the wide ones are epic so I
can't see why these ones wouldn't be
good and a Bluetooth so I could hook you
guys up with some swaggy swaggy swag so
if I could hook you guys up with some
swaggy swaggy swag and I will hook you
up this which might be swanky swagger to
win up we're gonna try this on for the
first time ever this is a live headset

the quality I've already used all that
stuff before I've I've already got it
