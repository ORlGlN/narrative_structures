oh right we'll try I'm gonna try and
ride around this slight little field on
my bike and try to this is something
I've always done you know bikes and love
bikes or something my dad brought me off
riding bikes all of it and doctors like
all across country so forth and he tries
to get me into but I'm too lazy really
am too lazy for my own good and I can
really do about it just because I don't
enjoy like riding 40 minutes up a hill
or something like then to ride down it
for 30 seconds I'd rather rather travel
all the way to France and get a cable
car up a hill for about 10 minutes of
them ride down a track that takes like
15 minutes that's the kind of stuff I
prefer to do when I've got the energy of
course otherwise I might absolutely
bored out my skull and doing the
oversight cross country stuff but then
again exercise is always good it always
makes you feel dead positive so when it
actually comes to me making a video a
lot of people don't know it's like when
I'm not in a like I really like
productive mood I'll go and do like a
little bit of exercise even if it's not
much even it's like I just like screw
this and going doing like freaking 60
press as many Precint my dad always did
this who's like how impressive do you do
in a minute it was like he do 60 you can
get like 85
oh no probably sounds that's probably a
stupid amount but like proper hammer it
out that fast and it's like really good
because it gets you like your body and
your blood flow in and you know I just
went okay I'm so not used to this bike
come on
but yeah I'm on a different bike now
holla show you what bike on this is a
specialized vignette this used to be my
bike and I asked my dad's I hate to have
my own you don't want mine is Manton
orange so this is the black one at the
moment you could tell looks pretty sweet
and yeah just I love the bike I wrote
this when I went to France for the first
time my first ever downhill in trip I
went on this and I absolutely loved it
it was a bit of a slug though because
you know like going from place to place
on a if you're a biker and you can see
look at the tires and I think absolutely
beast you know it's like how it works
around and so I was just like oh god
dammit I need to get a new bike so I
ended up getting an orange patriot and a
16 inch frame it's just like absolutely
perfect for me and so yeah it's not
working the moments got no pedals on it
but you did say I got some new pedals
for Christmas so I'm gonna put them on
and yeah it's my old primary school it
actually is this is Dalton primary
school I used to come here as a kid and
got in trouble all the time
and this is something to talk about more
a lot of people I know what I was like
at school and stuff like that and I just
summon up every parent's you know I got
in trouble for talking go figure
and now and now you look it now and go
like what's my job it's basically like
play video games and do vlogs and like
talk so it's kind of like a
contradiction but I love it and I
wouldn't change this job for anything in
the world I appreciate all the support
you guys give me a hand yeah this just I
do a vlog you know just check things out
probably go see some family in a minute
like I think I'd really do need to go
and see my grandma cause if you all know
my grandma's not actually well I'm
pretty sure it's motor neuron disease
she's got so like a muscles are actually
dying in the body kind of sucks and like
I said you know you might be like why
tell is this a lot of people know like
about a year ago she was diagnosed with
it is that really sudden and yeah you
guys were all supporting for it I was
like real upset if I was gonna lose my
grandma so I should riddled I've seen
her like a million times book that
looked really cool then and so yeah to
go and see her to see how she is and
hopefully she's not too bad
because there's no getting better for
unfortunately but you know I can always
be that to support her and stuff wow so
that is that's what the best thing you
can do with anyone who's really ill and
I don't know which way I'm gonna go now
