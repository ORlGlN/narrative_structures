out he likes exploring those oh
it's almost like a hard opinion once
today but no I'm going watching
transformers have you made this is what
I call tying and warped and I just
started seeing the new Transformers film
all I have to say is if you thinking
about going watching it go with the
intention that it's terrible it's fun
it's really fun I can't remember the
actor's name right now the main
character in Wes world really fun he's
hilarious but the storyline for two and
a half hour film thanks I'm almost
confident that Thom McAn car I could be
wrong I'm hoping is here because I
bought him a place of two games bowling
together today
stenographer ball so what exactly went
over the names everyone get an initial
and I get a name great
HS ppl tiny Tom and we do know I'm going
to suck the most right because I brought
my own bar I'm 250 times like these
