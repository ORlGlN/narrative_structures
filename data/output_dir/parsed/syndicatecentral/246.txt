I've got to be honest the monkey is the
best thing I decided to do in such a
long time for my phone however I always
end up leaving it on so I probably
switch out my phone case twice a day so
that means I've used the charge in my
phone from putting a knife that I've
used the entire phone case and then I
swapped out twice more that's a lot of
energy for always having the phone
charged man which one's gonna place
called junkyard golf
