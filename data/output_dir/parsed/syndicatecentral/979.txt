well to be honest I feel like I'm doing
a confession camera smell I like because
I've got like a rig set with a light and
the me not moving around the phone but I
thought I'd come back at the end of
today and this is get up vlogger doing
just a somewhat Monday and how things
have been going and walking up to and
yeah just I'm pretty good all right I'm
pretty good I'm tired you can probably
tell with these weight lifters I've got
but yeah but I'm pretty tired because
after I went to bed last night like 4:00
a.m. because at 4:00 a.m. I went to
sleep and after like getting all the DLC
videos ready and I got it out and I was
happy I upload a lot of videos I was
like right I'm gonna get up 11 a.m. you
know download DLC packs and know
everyone's gonna be up from like 9:00
a.m. or earlier waiting for it but I
knew dropped to 10 and therefore like it
won't properly be available to 11 so I
was like I'll get at 11 as soon as I get
it 11 I was she me let's watch what I
did I played it for half an hour and did
my first run I always do like my first
live ruin recorded and post as a video
and then a live stream for four hours
and that's probably where most my
Energy's going like I had no energy
drinks the entire time I was absolutely
boiling in my house it was just it was
insane I was so hot and yeah I enjoyed
the new map it's a lot of fun book
something just doesn't feel right like
this is why I feel like I'm doing some
sort of like confession curve like to
people who don't do I am if you're
watching this video you'll be really
confused so it was probably like kind of
put a passion well a new DLC came out
for ecology black ops 2 zombies and for
the game in total zombies is what I play
and I usually like really get excited
and cover any little bit of information
to do with the zombie map pack because I
have a huge passion for it I'm like dead
stoked for when something comes out like
yeah I need to cover but like with this
new DLC one the game was so much
information like Easter eggs and hints
and this and clues and this and that and
just so much that I kind of was just
like I feel like the story is just being
told to us now instead of it being made
for ourselves because in zombies there's
a hidden story line
and then the story line was what you
make of it like you piece together the
puzzles how you wanna piece it together
and your theories make what's a
you know what it could possibly be but
Trek have known turned into this light
set storyline of it being like cinema
and stuff like that and like proper
narratives and stuff which is cool but I
just think I'm losing don't know why
she'll be really stoked that zombies
like doing all these new improvements
and the gameplay feels awesome but just
getting like stoked up for like the
actual like covering like the dlc in
stuff like I just don't feel the need to
because back in the day if some DLC
drops like people like where does this
mean I don't know explain it so I used
to explain excitement the knowledge I
had on zombies but now everything is
pretty much explained for you so I'm
like I'm just put out a video for the
sake of making a video of it like I'll
bow you know tutorials on gameplay that
people you know search like go to look
I'm a pack-a-punch video from I don't
know trans it's like five million views
is in the lab because people want to
know how to do things in zombies unlike
teach them because that's what I do
zombies and what this new one mile it's
just over still July the what's it
called the Astro hair heads ahead it's
called but this new ones just got me so
like damn like I spoke to some of the
track guys like the zombie guys now is
just like dudes I'm just not feeling the
energy for this map like I don't feel
like I need to play or I need the energy
to do that like I'm still playing it now
I played it for like four hours in like
bubbling told about seven hours that
I've played it and but like I don't feel
the need like I have to make video isn't
it that's all thing I know that's weed
though and I know I do like a lot of
Minecraft now my channel is probably you
could say at this point more per known
Mon Mon now no more known for minecraft
at the moment is my hunting optics
series doing really well and zombies was
just good and stuff at work
zombies can only go so far and like it
limits your creativity you can make a
challenge and stuff but you can't be
creative anything like it locks me in
and it was fun at first but then after
doing it for like what since World War
black ops posting concept a black ops
one mainly Co posting comes in like two
nearly three years and it's like it's a
jet engine you're doing the same thing
over and over again and every day I'll
see like I've covered it like crazy and
crazy and crazy and then it's got to
this one I'm like you know are there
like I think I can take a backseat I can
chill believe it to other people you
know I like to do the most the main
I like to do but all the little tiny
things and doing the huge Easter egg
hunts is too far that just isn't my
thing like I used to love running run
them up for like seven hours just
looking for one radio but now like you
can find a radio and it's there and
it'll tell you the entire thing so many
people are lost right now if you don't
want zombies is but yeah I just thought
I'd drop in and just let you guys know
what I've been up to like I'm pretty I'm
pretty tired and I did want to vlog
today I'm just I were so happy I'm just
so stoked stoked about life and stuff at
the moment that's where I'm at this is
like a confession coming I did it I've
murdered the chickens I'm like hi I'm
think I'm sleep-deprived that might be
what it is and I've got a green thing
which and well yeah I just was like
proper just wait to drop it and I hope
you date you guys on my house like a lot
of people always want Frank in need of
Twitter just for my house because I want
to keep you guys involved in it just cuz
it's big part where the hell's that
noise vibrations just goes it's a big
part of my life it's going pretty good
dude just the the walls are up in the
house like the last video showed you
guys like there's gonna be a wall and
the next video I probably tomorrow I'll
be like look there's a wall in the wall
some walls are up now which is crazy
like progress of moving on to the future
is happening now - it's a bit scary like
I keep thinking about it and something
that keeps going in mind I watched this
video and it was about like how quickly
are we running out I'm not gonna like
this from depressive state but it was
like it's weird cuz you know when your
kid you the co-ed group you want this
when you're that and you know people
don't tell you about the Earth's like
we're never don't even care but now like
if I like I looked about it and there's
only about a certain amount of years
until we use up all the earth's
resources and stuff this is how deep I
go sometimes they should be sad like you
know one day the earth just gonna run
out fact yeah so it's bitch it's just
weird to think that that can actually
happen hopefully not in my lifetime and
like the shit in Siri that's going on oh
my god like this fucking stupid I can't
Lee this still happens like how and then
like the u.s. is like threatening to go
to war with Syria and the UK it's like
bitch while her back you fuck that
fucking Syria and I'm just like whoa
dude
cam tips why don't we all just shake
hands and stop it but I know they've
done things that
needed to react to since I don't get to
deepen my politics or anything like that
but yeah my mind's been thinking about a
lot recently and uh honey an optics
gonna come to a close soon spoiler alert
well that's good come to a close and
it's gonna come to a fun close but when
I'm back in America I can start back on
my series on my next series that we were
working on which should be really fun
and I hope you guys are looking forward
to it
I'm pretty stoked for it and it should
be good I've got two shows that might do
and like I said you know I was gonna do
one like 6 p.m. UK time and then more
maybe 10 p.m. you came
UK tan like two different series because
then the 10 p.m. is good for like
American time people that saw stuff so
that's kind of cool but yeah I've got to
go there might be a pause in between
wen-hung anoxic ends to the new series
just cuz you know I need to be back out
on the states to record with the certain
people I'm gonna record the series with
so yeah I should be good because I know
what that lag mothertrucker that work
might lag what yes why everything guys I
just want to say I'm happy I'm stoked if
you want to get your hands on one of
these about Boris I mean I meant to do
the whole pitch before that by the way
the riot line was trending on Twitter
last night at like 4 o'clock in the
morning which was just so weird cuz I
didn't even do it like you guys did so
if you want to get one of these guys if
you're not seeing it this money clearly
didn't learn it's it's the wrong oh my
god it looks sick as a bun time mmm this

stoked about it I'm gonna make them
sunglasses and just say that Orion
