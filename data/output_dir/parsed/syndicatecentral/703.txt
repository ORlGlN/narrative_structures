well it's six o'clock in the morning I
just woke up and this is what the view
from my apartment looks like
what is happening with the world no word
of a lie
I've only just got out of bed and is
4:32 in the afternoon
why breakfast today I have to help your
choice overtop of Nutella pots with a
water you can tell I'm all about them
gains in that healthy lifestyle I have
read oh I'm trying to catch the last
rays of Sun that I possibly can I
probably got about 30 minutes before the
Sun actually goes down so I'm just out
here
topping you up and I had a guess there
was a woman up here with a kid so I was
like hi I just looked really awkward cuz
I walked up to the roof stood here and
randomly a Nutella part nope
stood up I didn't sit down cuz I
wouldn't be in the sunlight and then I'm
drinking a bottle of water so I looked
really really random I look like
I was like plotting a terrorist plots in
a while so that was kind of weird it was
hands down the most depressing amount of
Sun I've ever got on my self at one
point I feel like I was like milking a
dusty nipple but because I was a Jeep
Wrangler I'm gonna try and rent one
first to see if I even like the way it
drives because if I just hate you then
what's the point in having it so I'm
ringing up a bunch of places try and see
if they've got any for rental right now
through the companies that rank don't
have it in stock so it's not looking
good I finally made it back cause places
I'm going trying the Chinese food so I
hope this is damn good open oh yeah
10/10 so far I haven't even ordered any
phone and I got a random plate whenever
the house is okay the guy works here
such a good guy
I went to wall it up a lot of footings
like that's what food you want here
I don't recommend that self
is advising me and giving me some super
knives so okay soup on the house I'll
tell you how it tastes of course I got
salt and pepper chicken oh my god that
looks good this is so good this food is
so good I would say the one thing is I
like all the chicken is so thin Oh super
then Oliver said like no chicken now but
it tastes so good it's pretty much just
don't look to be fair a camera they
complain well for originality of name of
Chinese restaurant I give it a 10 out of
10 but for food I give it a six out of
10 it was good but that chicken pieces
was just so dry it was like ghandi's
flipflop actually you know what it was
like milking a dry nipple again I don't
know why that statement is a thing for
today but it's like milking a dry nipple
alright just look at this Jeep Wrangler
oh my god there's so nice I'm
trying to ring up a bunch of Jeep
Wrangler companies to see if I can
test-drive one for a day just so I can
want vog it and then maybe get in touch
your Jeep and see if I can borrow one
for a week to see if I like it and then
fingers crossed
let them progresses to me buying one and
just roaming around in the sand dunes of
California the perfect one
just randomly shopping for random share
and I just realized there's a pigeon
that is being kept in captivity inside
the shop you see on top of the shell
not cave there's a inside I
you not fun find it I'm gonna try and
show you he's going I was like I was
just started like looking for stuff I
then was like sure I saw something
