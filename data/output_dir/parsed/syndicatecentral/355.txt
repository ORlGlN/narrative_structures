supposed to be 70 degrees outside today
according to the weather nope fog and
rain Oh bumboat achieve today but I can
hear someone still shouting I went to
sleep eight hours ago and he's still
streaming you're still soon for eight
hours hold on oh crap Gavin avoider dear
fellow and frostbite over here how long
have you been streaming for I'm at 15
hours and 36 I hope I cure you still
contend to go well geez good luck man
blue I have done 24 hours streams before
and that shit is brutal absolutely
brutal
no thanks I'm gonna shower and record
some h1z1 myself hell yes TJ had the
monitor I needed and you might be like
why do you need this monitor in
particular there's all those ones out
there but none of them have a headphone
socket in the side of it like this one
does and for some reason using OBS to
record and stuff I ate I just need this
to work so we have it let's plug it in
gameplay my setup has returned wait a
minute what what okay where's my check
on what you doing out here
normal game everything about the setup
is perfect a part of this fun won't stop
staring at me
ah you better know I got some h-1b blood
well why'd you forward it so let's throw
it over you guys what I'm trying to take
what alone I'm trying to say is I got
some solid h1z1 video see your guys
faces oh oh you guys eating good food I
like that I'm hoping mind going to do a
step if it's not a pigeon stole it and
really do who more Foods on the doorstep
mate because my phone's not working and
receiving calls right now and I asked
them to deliver food and yes that's a
special moment of truth what those
playing h1z1 for like an hour and a half
I ordered some food deliver to the house
and well breakfast it's like 10:30 right
now so this is to consider breakfast and
there you go it does look like a pile of
mush and mat but it's scrambled eggs ham
sausage bacon and then what
this is a pile of water but no it's
actually pancakes are getting maple
syrup did I get ya get that major that
made mr. oh I got that mate make sure
that's got a mixer Oh screw break well I
got like cream butter or whatever it's
all but wait a minute I know pamaj has
the best orange or is it what is it like
this Canadian just Canadian your guys
will see it before me but the Canadian
syrup in here somewhere that we're
allowed to use so for now I think I'm
just gonna have to stick with I'm Jemima
but uh yes my boys that
stuff is it Canadian yeah yeah so are
killing my breakfast I can get my videos
made I think today I'm going to try and
get like four h1z1 videos made and likes
to push my shit on the pack then I'm
going to try and set up the Xbox one
downstairs in that room and record some
modern warfare it matters if I can do
that and I can get the new guns and shit
we will be set so I'm pretty excited so
looking through done do today's not sure
this was done on purpose or someone left
it here by mistake so I'm going to
assume this was by accident because I
need to get myself fork and a knife oh
it's nice to see some spoons in this
house mmm mm-hmm
I just need to reform this again this is
so so good I might actually set this to
deliver to the house tomorrow good my
breakfast as well I usually use like a
24 but they don't have it out there for
a lot of things so I used to think all
group hug with jolly ups you guys use
and what you can do is you can schedule
food to be delivered so if I would just
breakfast delivered here at like 5:00
a.m. tomorrow I could do it wake up
shower and then at 10:00 a.m. get a
knock on the door and have my food shot
I might do that
shocker so much breakfast time is all
bollocks I just remember what time this
shit to learn the clock I haven't edited
my blog from yesterday yet so I quickly
have to do that look how small my h1z1
screen is because I change the settings
to make it like window minimized I can
just do like that so if I wanted to I
could actually play it on a screen
that's more how things go this is not
what I was expecting today the new
webcam that I was talking about in like
I don't know whether it is in the movie
I'm a blogger something is arriving
today out for delivery so I've mentioned
it before I ordered one in the UK bought
it is a 4k webcam so the live streaming
stuff this thing could be absolutely
beautiful these like the c920 s which
are like like 1080p sort of thing but it
does 1080p like 30fps if that sort of
thing but this new one you could do
1080p 60fps and you might be like what's
the point in that
but when you're doing like a full face
like webcam sort of thing having 60fps
like when you move in and be like taking
screenshots like videos or something
that is really really really really good
so fingers crossed that comes today I'll
do a bit of a tech review of it and
we'll see yeah well she'll stop oh my
gosh I remember that phone that I was
going to review monster energy drink I
put this in the opposite downstairs
fridge right last time I was out here I
just remembered it was there because the
only reason I got it you see it's got
that on it so that all is fucking sick I
just tried it dies one of the most tasty
refreshing drinks I've ever had um no I
am NOT sponsored by monster oh my god Oh
have you ever tried it
really do we even have this in England
juice Monster Energy I think it's I
guess it's just called juice Oh pipeline
punch damage - oh yes I got diamond
place in h1z1 it makes it we go sigh I
think bronze bronze silver gold or
platinum diamond then the top one that
you can be um nice second from the best
now this is like only 3.5 percent of
players in the world add this so beyond
new um I'm so excited just recorded one
of the sticky takes on to your gameplay
as ever it's like three minutes long
super good like if you're gonna watch
these videos like if you do enjoy gaming
videos watch all they don't just skip to
the end and see what happens because
it's more like just watch the entire
thing you just see that participation to
be like but I'm loving gaming again like
that like playing zombies I got so much
high-threat look Dave want to just play
play play play play and I also it dies
down like the hive dies which is like
anything you can overkill anything but
this game and I'm so hooked on it I'm so
hot that's why I'm posting YouTube
videos because I want to not to have to
I feel the need to because I want to I'm
so happy this
anyone it was oh good
it's even a song please Armitage for I
grew up I used to live in a little road
quad Armitage closed it was home sweet
home until I grew up and moved out when
ligament or matters weird-looking
capsule book okay I feel like when they
were designing this store they
accidentally left the piping man and
then swim was like oh my god it was
great so they did and also shout out a
fellow out a cheeky driver so obviously
it's a fucking woman
all right this is the whole challenge
turn into the mayor is pretty nice this
is like a stupid shit was like oh my
they could use like 100 quid for a night
but it's like a the second best rated
hotel in Chicago there is something
painful I need to point out though and
we'll get to that in a second you may
have just seen a sneak peek of it but uh
yeah it's a nice big bed pretty small
room but it's comfy and all this and the
only reason why I'm vlog in this hotel
resort is obviously to give it a review
which for looks is honestly like okay
today bought the bed what is the
comfiest thing I'm either one of the
computes beds other sluts in in quite a
long time I'll lay in in such a long
time sell the bed is easily a nine so
you know we're looking about an eight
point one right now but then there's
this lay in bed you go to the right you
go to the window to look at the view I
will certainly turn this light off for
reflections and then all of a sudden
boom there is staring the Reiner face
Donald packing Trump's I know actually
got a really nice view down the river
and the Sun is same right now so c'mon
there you can see like an eyeful of you
a lot of pollution in the background was
great but you can see all the river
it's so nice but yeah he's in a way so
go ahead shut these I don't have to
stare at that and run hotel room without
of you 8.1 8.2 hotel room with a view
