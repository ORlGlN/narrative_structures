you're getting off when you start
wearing sandals around your apartment 11
a.m. that's a cookie that's been there
for way too long and I guess I was drunk
and made noodles to the night boy hey
the wait time started a by going inside
and playing video games so I've decided
to commit to the cause Pokemon go is my
life I want it to be my life but I'm
struggling because I don't have like the
official UK version so it's obviously
out in the United States right now so
that is exactly what I'm going to try
and grab this is my UK phone which I've
reset basically so I can make the US
account by using my US address boy it
says I need a US credit card which I
don't have and what I do have and which
you can use to smae be sign up with is
like a gift card so I'm going to walk to
a shop get an iTunes gift card like a
$10 gift card use it to create an Apple
ID and then hopefully download the
official version and just log into my
account so if that worked
oh boy the mini labs and Luke are going
pokemon run in tonight from a distance I
was like that's a weird-looking car and
until I got closer I realized that that
person is having a really bad day okay
this is one of the things there it is
that's exactly what we need okay that
works
ten thirty dollar ones I don't need the
money it's just to try and create the
account and then if they've got like a
MasterCard like you know a gift credit
card then I'll use that three different
cards didn't make any sense I just got a
$15 one this will be fun got the card
finally there's the code
obviously I'm would have used it before
you guys even try and snag it I'm gonna
try and put this in the phone and see if
this will work I actually managed to
sign up and create an iTunes account and
there is the official Pokemon go oh my
god I managed to get it to work holy
 there's the official
Pokemon go and download it right now and
I'll be able to play on my hopefully
existing account and level up tonight
yes I need a monster energy or an energy
drink at an ice-cream and then once my
apps downloaded I'm going
bitches so my boy who disappointed me I
thought we were going out at 4:30 to go
like catch a Pokemon but turns out
doctor's appointment so he can't so I'm
gonna walk down to the local bar to get
a beer on my own I'm care mini
lads in towns I might hit muppets even
once to Johnny but I'm going out testing
out the new Pokemon app that downloaded
see if that worked and run smoothly so
let's get this show on the road ago Trek
sure now this video is going to take
another hour and a half to render out so
at least I've got a gameplay video for
tomorrow would work trying to get that
daily gaming video hi pop I might
actually do a run of the new map like
like doing different challenges and
stuff like that each day flag oh no next
couple weeks because people want to see
me playing on the new map I want to play
let's make some gaming videos but
nonetheless a little more
sandshoes appeared on my new American
version which is like apparently bug
free so let's turn off AR mode let's see
if oh it's 125 let's see if I can catch
one on my first go I was actually
perfectly okay only hear some sounds oh
yeah boy yes oh wait should watch out
anymore and we should be good to go now
Luber he said be fixed so many books so
they should be pretty smooth for us from
now on
oh look at this down I don't need to
catch like I think if you catch one you
get three rare candy or whatever but at
least if I just catch a few more I'll be
able to evolve and get Sandshrew haha

how's it feel oh you're so not mad right
now I hey guys
ok scene I start here just doing a daily
vlog you know the thing is you're gonna
figure accent when you're crazy like
that this is the ultimate vlogging setup
and I just stick to using an iPhone why
it's just so much more convenient
you can't take this into a strip club
car you could but you'd probably get
punched in the face
isn't that right many much you want
shout out give it here
boy look at that I got a look oh my god
I got another I got another lucky egg
yeah for the bear oh joke these guys are
walking around playing Pokemon go and
they've got fold-out chairs with them
and like so this is where we are
and they're looking for a place to sit
down in between the two look I'm just
play but everyone everyone who stood up
here is playing Pokemon girl this is
amazing okay so randomly on my phone a
ride on a page and the ride on is really
really good level right which so wait
does it ride and appear on your map
steps wait so I gotta go that way okay
yeah I'll try and fight it this way I'm
gonna get murdered in a bush
well I'm actually walking in the wild
grass so I'm gonna walk this way see if
it goes to two steps if it doesn't I'm
gonna go back there and go in the
opposite direction we're gonna
catch this bitch pretty far away from
the restaurant now and I've still not
got down in step so I'm assuming I'm
definitely walking in the wrong
direction I'm gonna walk to the end of
the road and then turn back round I
thinks I do not see myself getting any
closer to this whatsoever it kind of
sucks that it doesn't give you a
direction of like oh it could be
north-south east-west you have to walk
in four different random directions to
even find out whether or not it's there
so it fortunately came back disappointed
as hell we didn't catch it what that way
that way and that way still three steps
so kind of looking right on which I wish
it like gave you like north-south
east-west direction like that's too easy
right on hope Pokemon wants you to
exercise okay yourself whoo after
the first of all I only got it to so
close but another one another one
I know a four 24:18 or duties that was
420 and it was a flaming horse yes this
is about to be ridiculous like I've been

hooked and look I look good I just I
just spotted a wild CaptainSparklez on
the other side of the road with Sonya
just kicking back playing even more
no I think I need a break from this game

clearly just saying that cuz I'm tired
and I've run out of pokeballs so I'm
gonna have to get my hype on am i
walking on and try and catch as many
pokemon balls as possible I don't want
to spend money on the game the moment I
start spending money on the game I feel
like you'd like you give yourself that
edge that ruins the fun aspect of it so
like you know it's like games like
you're where you can pay to win I don't
wanna pay to win I just want to enjoy
putting the game for playing the game so
I think I'm just gonna play it and not
spend money on it not quite sure how I
