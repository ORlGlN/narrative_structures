two hours not so bad in England today
this is this is probably what you call
typical England gray overcast I'm called
in while I'm naked and about to rock and
roll the brand new syndicate shot for us
know if you liked the episode of mr.
bean when you get such things mm can't
get it off here it is wrong you should
roll justice probably feeling fresh
looking good because this shit comes out
next Thursday ish if you guys gonna get
one make sure you're ready not gonna try
and toilet wall again last time you did
some parkour yesterday we had an
unsuccessful mission of trying to find a
cabinet from a house so main grand that
are going to go to a place I got most
the furniture was from a house called
Stockton in Manchester really nice place
so we're gonna go down to that and most
likely get caught in traffic
well when you'll get some fuel first so
are you ready to advance your granddad
yeah you know where you going yeah
please please have something in here
that I like or I can use or anything
because otherwise it's a crime customer
service here Stockton's is absolutely
integral hey if you're going to sit on
that with a coffee you better not spill
it that's all I'm saying okay it's okay
you take great care of you I was like
that a drinks machine is what I have no
coins my Doris will give me a code and
they got my gun to the coffee Oh give
him it's just so cute so the reason why
we're here is because I'm looking for a
TV unit like this because I know I've
got a wall home TV but I want a unit
underneath it to be able to hide my
mic's sample the problem is the mixed
number isn't that big it's about the top
about sums to the bottom of the floor so
none of these fit what I need however
these units here I thought we're all
together but they're not the individual
and the wall hung so I might have to do
is get this unit but then hang it really
low to the floor and then pour the
amplifier in it if it your answer if
it's it and it opens quite nicely
no sleek modern hopefully not too
expensive now this is what I'm talking
about
look at this unit it's pretty insane but
that looks so sick
Paulito oh look at you yeah younger
Winston Churchill get yours at first
like I have a room wait I have a dream
Martin Luther King sorry run figure and
then what are you talking about I just
found him
let's clean but before I break that and
end up being like 10 grand
thank you just saying that is a sick
looking bar look at that leather stool
leather bar yo that's well fancy I'm a
fan of that and then also this how could
this a little champagne has more DL no
no put a little champagne
sucker champagne humper in it oh yeah
little champagne humper in your house oh
wow only the cup you missed like an
idiot but you cool something right hmm I
don't know how you popped out either
going down
oh there you go look at it Oh what
that's sick
Oh common is that Clavin just quit for a
rock okay whoa whoa wait a minute
what's going on here it carries the ball
to the top and it runs it what I like it
but it's one of those I'm used to
playing The Sims or a game you know
where you can build a house or design
something so if you if you think you
want something you put it in I don't
want to delete and put a new one in
whereas in real life you have to decide
to side to side find the one you
definitely want buy it and if you don't
want to eat have to regret because you
can't take it back
so which one do you think I should get
one was an old clock the one with the ol
top yeah three
so you ate three dozen oak table I like
that but we have to check if it can fit
and if not it might be the silver one
