Oh the morning duties of being the dad
of cats em together litter tray and food
yes
I'm stealing you poop of this this is a
breakfast to wake up to three o'clock in
the afternoon I'd like to thank
gladiator computers for this amazing box
my cats absolutely love it if you want
to get yourself an amazing box make sure
you buy yourself a computer best
sponsorship ever now we have not just
one cat but two cuts inside the box two
for the price of one you can't even make
this up well from what I'm seeing from
you guys the feedback on the new
computer is absolutely beast mode what
I've actually managed to finally get
rolling like rock and roll it is
everything I've got the Sony Vegas
install million program from a blogs
this is gonna be my first test to see
how long it takes to render out the vlog
I did do a clip test for gameplay
footage not not the vlog which is
gameplay footage and I could render out
like a 30-second clip in like 12 seconds
like 1080p 60fps and I was like that's
amazing so I'm gonna see how long it
takes to render out a 10 minute vlog in
1080 60 fps usually takes 12 20 minutes
1080p 60fps render on the brand-new
piece but yeah III click the rhomboid I
was like holy shit that was fast alright
this time let's remember to take render
loop region only okay that's good
and click render alright computer this
is an 11 minute video how long you're
gonna complete it in mmm I just closed
the thing that said it you stone
rendering but it look at the time it it
finished it in like five minutes 30
seconds holy crap that was fast it took
5 minutes 30 seconds to make the video
and it's taking 35 minutes to upload it
I ordered a stream Dex if you don't want
to stream decades while you're streaming
right you can change your OBS so it's
like you know me with the full camera me
with my gameplay all this and usual have
to click it with your mouse or like a
hotkey some up but they brought out this
like little box that you put by the side
with loads of buttons on it with
pictures of what like your your current
scene is so watch your streaming you can
press the button and it can light
trigger like a sound effect like you
know like say if you want to do like you
know big
like a laughing track if you made like
cheesy joke and impressed it it like it
could play a laughing track so it's
quite it's quite an interesting thing
and somebody uses it really rallies
Terrorizer now I've ordered it but I
don't see no boxes lying around for my
neighbor may have it so I'm gonna go
check my box to see if there's been a
delivery now even though all the postman
man throwing it at my front door again
look at that look at a train just look
at it beautiful absolutely beautiful all
right well no delivery note so guess
it's not been delivered no idea where
that thing's out but I've got a lot of
letters and one of these is from the
police so let's give it a ring and see
what it says our next update from the
police says dimmest excel thank you for
turning the completed road traffic
collision report to the clever Collision
Investigation Unit okay this matter is
now under investigation you may not hear
from the police for several weeks as the
legal process to gather evidence can
take time during this we'll be
contacting other partners witnesses and
securing any other evidence once part
once this has been completed and
investigate we'll be in contact and
update you with the progress of the
inquiry we aim to complete this process
within two months of the collision and a
finalized the investigation within six
months I hope the person investigating
it looked straight at the footage he's
the guy on his phone and gives him six
points and removes his fucking license
please use the reference number above
the unit can contact it will by yours
faithfully who and this is actually hand
signed hand side not actually just like
a printed signature hand signed and
wouldn't Southerland RTC records you
knew meant for everyone asking we just
continue to wait and wait and wait until
anything new happens it can be smart
asses realize this may go well this this
this you know find that loot loopholes
to get out of it but then did they the
police had really trying to push light
be on your phone watch your driving is
completely equal you get six points for
it you get fines you get your license
taken off and everything like that
like the really try to enforce it so
it's like that's the rules
that's that's what should be done we've
got evidence of it let's make it happen
but if we have to wait six months for
that to happen then sure but hopefully
in six months that guy loses his license
Bing pub G at like 80 90 frames per
second in ultra whilst recording it
streaming it and everything apparently
looks amazing and look at the sunset it
actually looks like a nukes gone off oh
my lord that looks crazy just
stop my first-ever stream on the PC and
it was magnificent first of all I can't
stream in any higher quality for the
picture of what people can see because
you know me still I say if I'm playing a
game in high settings people can see it
a bit better but everyone's like it's a
hundred percent better than what you
usually stream in and what I usually
streaming looks like like shit so the
fact that it's even better
