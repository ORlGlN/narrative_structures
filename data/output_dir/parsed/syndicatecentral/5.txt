today is the big day I'm risking getting
a haircut before insomnia like a normal
person you'd get your hair cut a few
days before so you make sure it looks
good you're all fresher already I'm
risking the fact that my barbers moved
to France I'm gonna try a different
barber and hope I don't look like an
extra potato the entire weekend insomnia
meeting you guys let's get this day
started I'd like to say I'm waking up at
a reasonable time that fix my sleep
schedule for insomnia and I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be perfect well that's three
o'clock in the afternoon whoops
I knew it knew it like I said my Barber
has moved to France and he's like
protege Scott has taken over but Scott
has changed it to rather than you know
just turn off but it being busy all the
goddamn time to bookings only but I
didn't know it moves to the booking the
only thing in the as done now so I just
need to get my hair cut before this
event so it's nice to turn up to event
nice and fresh with a fresh trim but it
looks like I'm going as a super potato
no I even rang my backup barber I rang
my backup bag bag bag I rang my backup
barber for a haircut and he was like
yeah we're an appointment song to make
sense you go there for a haircut then
you wait in three hours on average it's
so annoying and it just makes sense into
book people in oh my god I look like
this I'm watching ninja and he's just
like this song behind me this wannabe
onion is usually just bullshit when it's
on someone's dream but when you actually
look there's camera guys behind
I love ninja swordsmen he's such a
legend
Ken's gonna company you you'll take care
of you I love you I love you looking but
evil eye is giving me two hours two
hours were about to spend in this
vehicle
thank God I turn around when I was
walking out the door then I left old me
bloody shirts on the on the banister I
honestly can't believe we're driving to
insomnia Tom's BMW and you know we
speakers were working the other day but
we have to improvise
they're still not working
we have to do this for two hours two
hours hey Tom what uh what's because you
got built into this car army is got a
sickest what approved portable boats in
it mate

to be in it for two hours I don't get
wrong I love my defender and everything
but I'm glad of a driving in this yeah
I'm sure we're gonna be saying that when
you're doing 500 miles around yeah we
made it five minutes down the road
Tom McCallum needed the toilet so it was
like oh let's go to McDonald's we could
get out the car
Tom could use the toilet instead we went
through the drive-through part we're now
eating in the car whilst they've gone to
the toilet we've done this sell
backwards Tom's car is gonna kill me Tom
McKellen will not get over anything so

the bar okay so I thought I was actually
sharing a room with Cal which would be
awkward because we only have one bed but
I think I may have got my own room this
time which is good for me because what I
meant this event I need as much sleep as
possible and not to be woken up nice
room beautiful I love this hotel the
only thing I hate about this hotel is
this smell if I could put a smell add on
to this vlog so you could smell the
outside of like the hallways it's like a
weird like Ana CD Wow check this out

a messy place but i have no idea what's

for this hotel room as per usual

Molly Tom Paula Karen wait I was going
to say here we're missing you my
favorite lady in the whole world for the
most beautiful moment ever and a kind is
a person I've ever met
sometimes I'm pretty sure I'll be having
this internal debate that I'm not
actually going to drink and it's not
even day one yeah oh my god that is so
sour
here to take a massive sip of it massive
silly big mouthful you think it's sour
try it try it me yeah that is that that
is a killer of a drink that a mate I
wasn't I was not joking with a trashy
book you know my face inverted

Terrorizer is now flown to London where
frenzy is gonna be picking her I think
Prince is driving from Birmingham 200 to

in India and I can hear them from here
just an FYI I did say I'm not really
down to get drunk drunk at this event
they are so you've been warned well it
might be 11:46 but that means I have to
edit my vlog so time to get the files
off the phone onto the computer and get
it all at it up thank you very much for
watching I hope you have enjoyed today's
vlog it's just a taste of the craziness
that's about to be insomnia I've already
bumped into a load two people and
someone I have to say that I'm very
happy I bumped into it was face sensor
like I just run with bumps into him as I
was in the lobby and I was like I've
definitely spoken to online before but I
don't know if I've ever met me in person
and we both agree that's the first time
we've ever met super nice dude he's very
big
mostly fucking none like definitely the
pictures don't do many justice not
honest I'm really looking forward to
seeing who I'm gonna meet the rest of
the event because there's the call of
duty event here and all the optic guys
are here but what I'm really
disappointed with is that hex apparently
couldn't make it for medical reasons or
personal reasons or some other I get it
understand book I was hoping hex was
gonna be here and we could stay par a
drinker insomnia and then after insomnia
was over he was gonna come back up to
Manchester to my house but I guess he
hasn't done so if you guys want to try
and motivate even help you feel better
on Twitter then please go ahead and do
so but guys I'm gonna catch you guys
tomorrow at 6 p.m. for the next daily
vlog and I'm gonna really really try to
get my vlogs uploaded on time cuz you
know back in the day I used to have to
edit them on my phone and it was just
hell on earth for having to be able to
like try and do that in mobile upload it
so hopefully now if I can get it edit it
every night before I go to bed even if
I'm drunk edit in it at least I can get
it loaded no matter wall depending on
the Wi-Fi so alright I'll see you then
make sure to follow me on Twitter and
Instagram at Pro syndicate and just a
