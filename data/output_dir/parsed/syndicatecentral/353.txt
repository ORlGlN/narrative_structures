for the record I got in bed at the end
of yesterday's vlog but then I'm waking
up now at 4 o'clock in the morning
because I think something may have
changed my dad said to me have you
checked out your office yet so she spent
home the my answer was no so I'm going
to go into my office for the first time
now and see what's changed
boom oh well actually absolutely nothing
you might be like well that's
disappointed
I honestly thought my dad had taken out
the dead and built a new one I guess not
so what the hell changed in here he said
something new what happened I don't see
anything no okay so my dad didn't change
my dad I don't know what I was so
convinced to change my desk well what
could days he made a little solo album
and it's very shame you know actually
that's not Steve that's spike that's my
first and very
can am I'm awake yesterday I was like
wow it's so beautiful in England and
today it is miserable less displaced
however yo yo yo woah woah woah no idea
what is this but I do know it from
raising a tripod don't you dare show my
pants I'm going absolutely
nothing but let's open this box
um if actually guess what this is crazy
I really know because I don't think i
aspirated and I don't know anything new
they release usually I don't always
raise it in the US because you don't
write raised on the front of the package
or is this one of this though oh my god
I asked tonight know what it did please
leave do I think it is ah oh my god this
size box always the mean one thing oh
yeah this is it
I mentioned this at the airport but I
did not think I was going to get it
ladies and gentlemen if you ever receive
this box from Razer
this means one thing and one thing only
oh the brand new Razer Blade laughter
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes oh my freaking God Oh oh cool
it's actually good well I was expecting
three Coco but yes this is my new 2017
razor blade Pro laptop Oh
the first open oh hell yes weird
fact about this laptop every read lots
of I've ever owned the power bank has
always come with a u.s. adapter I've
never ever owned a UK adapter book
because I believe these are available in
Europe now we are UK powerful so I don't
have to keep carrying around that big
like transformer so you know I plug it
into another country so that's amazing
also the best thing about this laptop
even though obviously it's a lots of
itself thought this laptop comes with a
UK key keyboard sort of rather than a US
and I didn't go for a 4k monitor I went
for a full HD 1080p you might be like
why don't you go for 4k it's just
because a lot of games and Nala games a
lot of programs and stuff don't work
well with 4k red screens it's really
really strange but it just kind of
happens so I decided to go for full
1080p matte display so Matt rather than
it being like really really super shiny
I went for a matte display so I have
another razor blade a laptop and I
didn't even have to steal this one of
razor hey what's up it was not Vanessa -
yes I'm not even bother going to set in
York because got more important things
to do like dick a wall let there be
