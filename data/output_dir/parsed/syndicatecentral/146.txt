places head back head to the airport
while America with his license placed
the camp a great place these guys are
playing squash with their hands look
this is a squash ball smacking this with
like pure power
let's go round three
do you know what's really sick about
this bike not just its look look little
license plate is what is that about
that's gonna be outside to hell or legal
but still I can sing oh yeah welcome to
bike watch with Tom and Ken this is a
badass meanest looking bike
I'm too sure what going on with this rat
that's pretty terrifying
oh it's applicable scary I'm fine hand
sanitizers big deal
it's like 19 Cuba I look to this one and
I'm like oh it's a sleigh I'm a minute
there's a dubbing Santa a dabbing Santa
why we could go in the Empire State
Building right or we could go in the
Museum of sex now what would you like to
do oh dude I've actually been in there
and there's a big tour you can do it
it's kind of weird it's like a big big
vagina on the wall I don't know Ken's
just being a tourist he's so funny
you know he's not being a tourist my
dad's just over that have been laundered
really stars on YouTube channel just cuz
he films a lot of stuff I films it and
then just really do much of it
like puts on his Facebook whatever but a
lot the stuff he feels really good
talking about you being a youtuber
blogger you know a blogger blogger
so glad he came Tara is the one who's
where we're going there we go I'm past
eight buildin oh touristy kandi so
excited look at it with this phony
doesn't know what to take photos oh oh
oh my God thank God we beat this crowd
of people jeez
it's that futuristic now that even the
building has Wi-Fi look to say I'm
taking track of time happened but I woke
up this morning and my watch is
completely fogged over so like the seal
on it is clearly like gone and what I've
got into it so conversation is like
happened but never seen that happen
before
don't know how it's happened hopefully
it doesn't do too much damage and I can
go get it fixed it worked well I don't
know why it looks like that that is not
good
pretty good view right well they're
taking us 45 minutes to get there but Oh
Mallory can you see the Empire State
Olympus is it you're in it One World
Trade Center and then Statue of Liberty
there she is she's still standing
we made it to the 86th floor and now the
102nd Central Park all these buildings
big buildings fancy buildings rivers
actually don't like us the river where
you put the plane down in Italy you know
the Hudson River rush it that's the one
Hanabi to a guy called Villa came over
us before easily one of the coolest
places get yourself the one World Trade
Center over there looking nice and
pretty
I don't know what that big bridges in
the background but you're like the
Brooklyn Bridge and the what is it the
Brooklyn and the wop
the Manhattan Bridge over there and then
you've got the Statue of Liberty still
she's chilly she hasn't left yet she's
still that cool a city if I could live
anywhere here probably pick that
building and it just seems nice and
spacious and kind of cool we may we see
a wild photographer Kenny taking photos
this will be the moment on camera where
my dad drops his phone like the Empire
State Building and I just clean it
internally and cry on the inside and
heat cries then again he has got a new
phone so please don't don't
i'ts but it's dropping things from
where's my dad I think there is some
risky business you do in there Ken some
real ski business Oh
that's the kind of industry is panoramic
I've ever seen in my life look nice I'm
hoping this works you ready in it all
right well this turn into a good shot or
not look got it bit blurry but oh no
it's so far away
look boy oh yeah that's such a good show
oh my god and there you go Statue of
Liberty super far away with a bit of
magic
oh look if you zoom in through the zoom
my idea welcome Ken welcome it took us
like over an hour to get our tickets
upstairs and I'm finally get here just
to building how to do merchandise right
they can place they've built and placed
it with the most open you know what we
got empire steel for the wine we got
Empire State Building glasses we got
what you don't need I could do with an
empire state building or American shot

good
