welcome to the day of days well excuse
me where I am doing nothing that's it I
am doing absolutely nothing today apart
from sitting in this room pretty much
playing zombies and making videos all
damn day
now something on the terms of me playing
zombies I'm trying to get some perco
holux from these doctor Monty's
factories I actually had like 110 of
these and I've been non-stop spinning
them and spinning them and spinning them
to get hold on the new perks
in the map like straight away by using a
goggle machine so I'm gonna be sat here
clicking this button again and again and
again and let's see what we're gonna get
one last time but the new DLC for the
college you zombies came out today so my
main Charlie I'm trying to get as many
videos out or make as many good videos
as I can possibly and then store up some
for when I go to Utah the grind is so
real I finished through my first
playthrough on the new map and is a 28
minute video and it's currently taking
me over an hour to render it out so yeah
I'm kind of just like waiting for this
to finish until I can start making my
next video this slow match to so bad and
feeling good first gameplay is up I have
a video rendering and I have another
video going up straight after it and
then I'm about to play next video
through but if we here for a knock on my
door maybe my food is arriving just like
that bitch
mmm annoying fucking noise I'm trying to
chill out main videos I can all I can
hear is something sounded like a machine
gun going off by the side of man what
the fuck is pretty sure it might be a
helicopter which app isn't either an
insane crush oh there's the police chase
going on because they like three police
right now all facing in the same
direction they actually are please not

long this is gonna take boy because I
need to continue live-streaming this is

one o'clock in the morning a thing I
think it's pretty later than that and
that clock is actually just broken so
I'm gonna check yep two o'clock in the
morning and I just opened my door just
to some reason look outside of it I just
found a package so it's for me and I
have no idea what the hell it is because
I have not ordered anything and I do not
know of anything coming from raises so
literally me just saying that it's from
raisin I don't know what it is so it's
in a weird bag hoody and woody and what
else my god
another hoodie oh shit it's not hot it's
the brand new razor winter line setup
Oh razor what winter gear line clothing
so there's a like a bomber jacket there
and then this is like the full-blown
white winter jacket we try on oh my god
it is Comfort what as I say for gamers

make you a wouldn't a lot but I didn't
think I was gonna get you so suiting
well that's coming snowboarding with me
when I go to Utah
of which I need to go and book my ticket
I fly and I fly pretty much tomorrow the
day after tomorrow
and stole my book my ticket so that
would be a pretty pretty good idea and
while at this one hour and ten minute
video took at all
two hours 30 minutes to render out so
yeah try it world back to YouTube's yeah
okay now it's been an hour please tell
me my and that's working okay it looks
like down there it is doing
please let this render finish and then
we can go to bed or how long do I have
to wait 17 minutes holy shit I've been
faced time this entire time with my mom
for an hour and 20 minutes okay that's
sweet
so once this is done rendering we could
upload it and we can go to bed
it is 3:17 a.m. but I even more still
cannot go to bed because this laptop has
got an hour and 10 minute video on it
that I have to upload as well because
mine I went down and I have to start
uploading all of it before I can sleep I
don't think I have been so tired in such
a long time it's half past 4:00 in the
morning now right so I think it's five
o'clock way to type but I without
editing this vlog and trying to get it
rendered sorry edited and uploaded for
you guys to be able to watch today so oh
my gosh the grind Israel on a positive
no I did indeed managed to find tickets
to get to Utah in two days and it's not
like expensive to fly over that's that's
pretty cool so if you guys are from Utah
I'm looking forward to me and yeah I'm
me I might well it might be it's gonna
be a weekday so I don't know if I'm
gonna see how many people but I'm gonna
be going too so like say I could wait
you go okay so anyway I have got one
hell of a busy schedule coming up
tomorrow again another day of making
videos live-streaming the new DLC that
came came out then that after that I'm
flying to Salt Lake City where I'm gonna
have to tune out days filming
snowboarding doing cool shit with Devin
Supertramp an shonduras cannot wait for
that then when I get back I think I'm
filming a show for like three four days
or I might even be hosting the show so
I've got to learn a script and stuff
what I wish you'd be pretty cool don't
really start on TV it's like a YouTube
show
then what's done with that I go to
England for my mom's birthday for a few
days and I think maybe my best friend's
engagement hi not even too sure if I've
got the date right but I think it might
be next one before maybe that and then
once I'm done with that back to the u.s.
to continue on filming for the show and
there
I could finally have a break for a bit
until it shall be a 57 so yeah it's
gonna be a long period but I'm a
