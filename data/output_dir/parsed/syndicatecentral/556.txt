what are you throwing I nearly threw
some pretty fun
my name is Jeff
but stop checking yourself out in my
volume shit right I've got like five
seven battery thanks to cars depth cars
Denton battery that's where my brains
going thank you to your counter alright
we're gonna watch a Suicide Squad I
probably won't even be able to review
exhibit no battery but we're finally
going watching it alright I'm leaving it
to dress up Tom to solve this because
for the past three hours past three
fucking hours I've been trying so hard
to get the UFC 202 working and I'm not
joking I'm driving myself batshit crazy
because it just hasn't worked bTW your
fucking system shit sky your system shit
like it's absolutely awful and Barclays
bank if it was down as well so I'm not
joking
this entire although it supposed each
other we dare can jet introduced
informal UK friends everything like that
I've spent three hours trying to get
this organized because everyone's around
my house to watch it so their systems
are all fucking boxed and I'm like
tweeting UFC themselves like please
fucking help me and I don't think I'm
gonna get response so I played myself in
different terms Suicide Squad finally
went and sorry definitely glad I watched
it if you liked it I definitely
recommend it because it's for that fun
feature I'd give it a 2 out of 10 just
cuz it's that fun feature and I kind of
like cool scenes it's like watching as
people describe it like like watching
YouTube video like trailers for a film
so it's really really weird but it's
really fucking good in a sense of that
but no storyline the fucking songs
around them everything about it was
random do I recommend it yeah but it's
absolutely diabolical story is absolute
shite because there isn't a story and
then when they attempt to make a story
there just isn't one so yeah it's a one
crackpot
oh my gosh the aussie laughing he got it
yeah yeah God go through much gotta go
for a third match I will definitely say
I think you're dealing for the third
match easily okay then it is now 6:15

a bed edit this vlog so I'm sorry it's
late but I just did not expect wake up
