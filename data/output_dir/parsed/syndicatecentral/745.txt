well good morning look at the state of
this hair today even more magnificent I
look like a goddamn crap yet today the
day we shred some gnar so I usually get
up about 9 o'clock and self at 9 o'clock
to get there for snowboarding bought
because I'm not taking a lesson today
and the slopes are open until 10:00 p.m.
I can go whenever the hell I want so
we're going to be setting off in about
20 minutes so about half past eleven and
we're going to do in that hour and a
half drive to get to snowboarding so get
ready for hopefully some GoPro footage
from today well it works
ladies gentlemen we are good to go ready
board ready it's time to rock and roll
to our journey let's go I've had
absolutely zero traffic getting here
today which has been a sham I dare we're
heading into the mountains right now
it's actually somewhat raining so the
science inside my head says if it's
raining down here does that mean it's
snowing on the mountain because the cold
and the altitude I don't even know but
we'll find out when we get there that is
a hell of a lot of cloud wrapping on the
mountains that's where I'm going the far
left side my god if it's no good if it's
rain which eye does he actually rain on
noise I don't fucking know if it is and
bollocks made load of bollocks
it's time I got my hair cut just let it
slide just one extra day at a time we
made it to the mountain pretty fucking
busy today but we warned that it could
possibly rain so if it rains it within
an hour that I can get my fast back for
another day so it's basically conditions
is shit then you have to waste your
money on wasted day so I did not know
that was the thing so pretty stoked you
would think this is melted snow and ice
and all up I think he actually did rain
like an hour ago someone was walking
past me saying so let's get up there and
get at it
oh boy it's just a little cut your faith
will be okey the chores his first time
but it's got rising so hard
I
first session of the day done with is
ugly chucking it down with the rain well
it was aware so my gloves are so quickly
brought about there you go swap it out
put my board in the boot go get some
food and then hopefully the weather
clears up set after an hour get back at
it now for some bad news I think my
GoPro batteries died I fully charged it
and will used it for like 25 30 minutes
in total worth of footage well I think
it's the cold
'inna wait the battery so I think I'm
going to bring like three GoPros on the
next time love to see okay dear GoPro I
need more cameras and batteries I would
bring spare batteries but the session
this that has an inbuilt box that you
can't take out you just have to charge
it so that fucking sucks rain rain go
away come back another day holy shit
it is really chucking them not not do
this right now
this civil flip that's quite ever
attempt someone just find out on a tweet
on Twitter like are you next to a zoo if
you didn't read this pest control it
says ants rodents bird spiders flies and
mosques you would be like they selling
it however nice and dry am right now I'm
absolutely starving so I'm just got the
brave the storm go out there and go and
get some nom noms nom noms I left my
naked drink in the car with a cell of
here so with today we're trying a naked
double buried okay oh my gosh the regret
I've got cheese out of machine
I could have even read shredded cheese
grated cheese all this regret I'm gonna
give you a taste test review of it
anyway so wish me luck
I do not have I helped to us at all
bought we'll see how it goes
now it's time to try a double berry all
right
it smells good
tastes disgusting well this weather
doesn't like it's improving it's
completely flood in this area but I'm
gonna go and swap out onto the stick and
do one more run down at least if it
doesn't clear up after that I think
everyone from what I'm hearing is just
calling it quits for the day cuz this is
just gonna this rain is just gonna wash
away the snow so riperoni pepperoni the
snow season out here usually goes to
April both members of staff in ever like
this rain is scheduled to be so bad that
it's got the chance to wash away the
stony washer weighs almost no then
they'll have no water to be able to make
loose now it's confused me books and it
was like yeah we won't be able to make
any more snow for the season about to
close down early rather than closing
down in April so I'm like what the fuck
I know the snow but you can't do this to
me Angie minutes later it's gone the
sun's out and before it disappears I'm
gonna go get my runner oh yeah thats
what i'm talking about that's the
weather i wanna see no rain all sun
maybe a few clouds but look at that and
the slopes are empty so let's go get it
food inside me would be smart to use the
toilet but yeah i just want to fucking
hit the slopes
i'm actually enjoying this so damn much
that it's just like I just want to keep
getting back up and getting back up and
get back up and if I fall I'll just get
back up yeah absolutely there's no one
anyway I'm gonna have the slope to
myself a few this is not Billa this is
legit walk look it look good look white
orange sooo nice and on the other side
it looks beautiful and then down here is
the view guy I know it's Owen he
probably can't hear me but just look at
okay how awesome the shit is at night
it's so dope nice no boarding for the
win now I should really put my phone
away before a fall I'm attempted just
two switches only I've eight down the
mountain flawlessly once the rest of
time I've even touched my hands like
gums like a stop not falling like a stop
just like a brake and then chill like a
frontside stop or an edge stop our heel
edge light break whatever you wanna
fucking card so oh like touching
anything without stopping down slowing
down on make it all the way to the
bottom then break so I Drive ice and try
it I'm gonna get there eventually

but I need to be doing it every single
time so just get out it get I work I
work it get it done get shit done and
before you know we laugh now but this is
fucking sick

going down with my goggles on the first
time as it got really dark but as the
type bites I got all the sort of
disappeared I went down was like
actually shit I would like that let's go
put them on what I love sliding down and
I just fucking like bail because I
couldn't see shit this is like an hour
