like to be a Sunday food relatively like
early-ish I don't know why I think
that's the thing but uh yeah that that
is not real you know I could eat I could
eat this chump chomping right
you
I could eat this chicken and dumpling
casserole but it's Olivia's favorite so
she may kill me if I do that this is the
thing there's probably a lot of food in
here that I could use or cook with or
something but then the bigger problem is
I can't bothered I'd rather just like
nibble on like a stick of celery down
here but I'm pretty sure that's good out

about that I want to say this is my
first time I've stepped foot outside
today but as you saw I came in at 7
o'clock this morning so that was a bit
random but you know what it's another
miserable day in England it's called
Lydia there's a family show it out with
her sister because it's her birthday and
more importantly what no actually that's
the more important thing but more
importantly they've ordered a cutting
now it's probably got sugar loads of
cilantro on it but I'm gonna absolutely
hate but I'm going on down there having
myself a curry and uh turn up for the
night down at Lydia so I don't see you
that update it's still really cold Oh
probably because I'm wearing shorts but
yeah forget about it I mean I'm wearing
shorts I mean May this is why I love
this house look at this take off the
issues straight in Timnath flippy
floppies oh these are the originals yeah
I only just walked in the room and
everyone's leaving these your shoes
right no joke I've got pairing they're
usually smaller than mine anyway I was
like I was just thinking to myself I was
like these are a bit tighter than usual
I'm so sorry but Nikki flip-flops so you
go sorry it's not awkward at all
I've never had this kind of code before
so I don't know what we've got what's
this
never I'm not I'm that looks good no
sure what that is not sure what that is
hell yeah man chops
okay this was an absolutely incredible
dinner very spicy
very nice that's focused focused focused
what do you think in a camera yeah do
you think of this then this is what most
of augers use it's heavy
runs outta battery all the time that's
the person's because like when they're
watching it
that's right looking them in the eye is
if you look that you look at it yourself
at the screen distracting because well
you clearly look like you're looking up
or as if you like you hold it further
away and you look straight it looks like
you're addressing the people people
that's what this this is the camera that
nearly every real body uses you think
I'm a big blue you know I realize I'm a
potato blogger okay with it
oh yeah just felt like I'd use this
today tap tap tap tap no how do I do
this stick to being a potato and see
that red dot there it's a brand corner I
just press this in stops call it what I
was gonna say why the hell is countdown
on it like 10 o'clock at night but if
they say out of 10 cats cuz Libya
watches TV all day

four comes along things do countdown

around people who were used to like a
camera like this all the time it would
be easy but I can just doesn't feel the
same
