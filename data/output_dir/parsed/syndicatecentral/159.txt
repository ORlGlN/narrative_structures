when my dad brought they took me and my
sister to London for the first ever time
he brought us here and out of anything
he could take a fall or with us with he
took a fall with us with this sign here
and every time I come down here with
someone

with the person that wins so you and me
are now gonna get fought on the second
side okay plan little blogger as well I
did ask my dad like I hope everything
you could've done it killed you like
Buckingham Palace so why did you choose
this sign and my dad said he went
because I know that signs never gonna be
moved which I say fair statement but the
same time I like really that's your
that's your landmark not like a phone
box or something

Joe what's there on the left
don't damn right it is good man that is
Downing Street right there on the right
foot to prove my point
Downing Street this is where our Prime
Minister lives
and this cop is reading from Venerable
gonna see a Royal Guard

of those in about six years they're
never there oh yes story time
once we were down here with my dad and
my sister stood into the horse guard
area where you're not supposed to go and
then noticed my sister I'm like get out
the guard just like get out the God my
sister ended up crying her eyes out
because one of them shouted at her that
much I thought it was hilarious
rumor has it these men have been studied
for 20 years and
any days and they're not allowed to
blink I'm actually not too sure if the
error lights blink or they're not
allowed to
oh wait look Kelly look straight at me

horse why she talked to the arms I can
you do I don't know you could touch the
hearts evident it just kicks up
brilliant there you go what a beautiful
looking so intensely staring we just
went if you watch the vlogs blink twice
and then he went I don't think inter but
we think he might watch the blogs you
might know your gun don't you ask him
for a horse ride
both right it was here it happened
my sister was stood a light looking at
the guy and she stood in there but
notice not allowed in and I was like cut

said would you like to in Spanish
granola it's like one of granola is
breakfast cereal so I said granola bread
no olives Spanish granola is olives
besides any bastards so again the really
cool thing about this place is that you
get a postcard that will send anywhere
in the world now me and Lydia sent ours
to Tim and Lydia's auntie but what my
granddad's doing is sending it to his
girl crush he's he's followed in love
with his queen so he's sending his queen

do you think that's a bad beer that just
poured do you think I did a bad job
that's the you gonna enjoy out of ten
won't you give it 9
I also agree 9 they was really good
really good the service was incredible
the main course was you know the one
thing that would stay stuck in the
dessert menu
none of us picked it anywhere we could
have had a dessert menu book just wasn't
quite wasn't nothing on the list took my
fancy so however without the dessert
it was probably a 9.5 from me I
absolutely would you come again yeah
yeah you want to next time you're bloody
sorry better ballroom dance gotta go
away in France spin around as all night
it's about 20 minute walk no go that's a
train station yeah that was an okay
response I like that you can't make it
up we're finally onto the last leg of
the entire holiday holiday adventure and
it started raining on the last minute on
it we work we almost as if we would have
got in that taxi we would have avoided
all the wrong but instead we go gonna
get the train so
that summarizing summarizes the moment
it's my grand going let's get going
we're nearly there they sell umbrellas
you want me
we're soaked but absolutely so wet
through sorry good dad you love war why
all this rain you'll be fine
nearly brought me kill me okay oh you're
so bad he's like look at our wet cow is
below it like literally this water just
came out of nowhere it was so bad Oh
Cory go nope we're almost there
that's not what approached me no mate
it's absorbing water it's not what Bruce
right we've made it to the underground
time to get the train to Euston it's
time to get all right Carl sure just
about I'm cold I'm a ninja of the rain
mate the race looks at me and goes oh
hell no and it runs away from me

yes all right I told Carl make sure you
look at obviously you did cool you think
he knows what he's doing but he still
needs a helping hand every now and again
yeah cheeky little bugger year I hear
every single train along these delay
delay delay delay delay delay delay and
Ozzy's at nine o'clock that train from
from 823 has been delayed all the way
over so that's not good thought the fact
that these people are going somewhere

I've ever seen it Nana Kakaako that
granda there's a faster than it how
