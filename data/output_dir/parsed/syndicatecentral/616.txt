completely empty it was just that
parking lot at the front that was full
now
look at it cause and cars and cars and

activities and a dancing group of people
position this is what I imagine America
to just be like all the time ladies and
gentlemen introducing the Hall of
Justice what wait what's it what's this
right actually about so album metropolis
understanding we think this is like one
way your shoe and stuff but also the
same time I think it's like transformers
at Universal in LA where like you ride
around it and like it throws you about
with a big-screen projectors all things
in 3d glasses so we go try and get in
the first pass second intention
platinium x concentrating and the woman
next to us was like ah well I guess I

and arrow archery range we're trying
this we have to fire an arrow with a
bigger rubber end at those balls and
knock it off first to win something like

this doesn't suck so I only hit one and
one I got scalped I thought if you hit
one get one of the big emojis you hit
eight it's my last shot
obviously my inner arrow
I taught you well come on you can do
this
just just be the arrow all right ten I'm
listening boom

win a big emoji but to be realistically
we can take the small emojis home so we
got love our eyes and a tongue face no
but Lex you've got a participation emoji
yeah I've won one she got one because
she she basically paying $10 Lebar yeah
yeah participation was like oh you came

basically what she got we were on
Goliath again hands that's power here at

so I'm at 105 and that means good good
what would be not normal um well I
they say not above 170 like 170 is see a
doctor but it's like 140 is like higher
I guess and if I drank a coke and then
checked it again the late 20 minutes if
