Lex is doing a panel and I'm going to
try and sneak into it and ask stupid
questions to a throw off an entire
because that's what good friends do real
quick I'm just going to dress this
everyone keeps saying in the comments
from our yesterday's videos and every
video me and Lex are in together and
ones like we ship it you guys should
date oh wow I just really want to stress
this guy's there's nothing going on
between me and Lex we're literally just
really cool friend she's amazing
what she does she absolutely loves video
games but the biggest video game
collection I love any person in the
world that I genuinely know it's
ridiculous and she's just super cool
that's what we hang out all the time
that's why I hang out with us at the
object house all that sauce stuff so
it's Road rest nothing's going on please
don't be spamming her asking if or
dating or if she's the I'm dating her
anything like that it's not the case
like goss's our office area space
nothing's going on between us we're just
friends so today's game we're playing is
spot how many people have Casey nice fat
cameras apps that means the gorillapod
the DSLR and the microphone on the top
they'll get half a point if they just
have the gorillapod but that's the game
I'm going to play today so let's keep
our eyes peeled
oh la together bat just in a bathroom
and it's random do so much this yep
so go so far today
someone bought me beer which is great
but then some bought my shots appeal but
I don't drink tequila because it
literally makes me blockage I just can't
really drink Luke who do we think it was
it was even Dennis come on pranksters Oh
which guy
which guy I think it hand revenge you
think it might have been the book guy
yeah I don't know if it could have been
done people who know me know I don't
drink tequila
he doesn't know who it was whoever it
was thank you for the shot unfortunately
I have to make Luke drink it rather than
me cuz it will kill me
why me thank you though oh my god so
many content creators everywhere
hey thanks the drink got you in the
vlogger game so many hey thanks
for the penis shot in the bathroom oh
you did I'll find it but I think we've
got another drink to go the Spaniards
have returned and get during the vlog
again but okay going down three games it
sucks as awful like the best game in the
world don't download it ever really hard
I look like an evil guy for my knowledge
bad they look like no you're not
promoting your damn game no no no I'm
guessing this is basically VidCon they
have a stage some food trucks I'm not so
 paper Lex it's dude a panel so
I'm gonna go in the front and be like
your channels correct the game
are started today of how many people
have Casey Neistat cameras show me your
camera there's one you're the first
person that I've seen today with that
rig
what's your name Nathan Nathan what's
your channel ng production
everyone going show them some love and
subscribe just for the random fact that
you're the first person if I gain that
say okay there we go
never give people shoutouts like that
for the only reason that I did is every
day
hey hold my rib I've got broken rib
that's aggressive okay what's your name
I don't know who you are
do you know who I am yeah I think so Who
am I
yeah there you go Oh many people
oh my but every time someone sees a
vlogger walk past like not like an
actual like known YouTube more just like
if someone else sees someone else
vlogging then they all just bombard the
camera so now let's try and find out
where hall 207 is a chaos that is VidCon
2016 as you'll notice it's 99% females
right she agrees on one percent males
nonetheless we're just gonna ignore all
this and good stead 0-7 a to set it
I don't have the three rooms
what the because realistically
you're both making videos about
something that you
silly love agreements complete polar
opposite channels or anything like that
one good way to like blow blow raw
closer with other youtubers and just get
to know each other it really makes like
a nice community and a nice and
friendship breaker the panels over it
was awesome great stuff know we continue
into the crowd of chaos going
down into the crowd of chaos continues
with children who have given up on life
and are sitting down with people who are
oh I know these guys they they work at
they once again was playing we never saw
him anyway yeah we made it to VidCon joy
succeeds he almost gets half points
because he's got the microphone and the
camera but no Gorillapod you know what
he only counts if they've got a gorilla
pod can I see any gorilla pods from here
they're like really really girl girl
girl girl I don't know yes I found some
he's got oh close oh I totally thought I
got a gorilla pod but you actually had a
stun so it doesn't quite class as a
Casey nice that's up actually thought
I'd see twice the amount I've seen
