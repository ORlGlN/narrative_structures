well it's six o'clock in the morning i
just woke up and this is what the view
from my fucking apartment looks like
what is happening with the world no word
of a lie I've only just got out of bed
and is 432 in the afternoon why
breakfast today i have the healthy
choice of the top of nutella pots with a
water you can tell i'm all about them
gains in that healthy lifestyle what i
have read oh I'm trying to catch the
last rays of Sun that I possibly can
I've probably got about 30 minutes
before the Sun actually goes down so I'm
just saw up here topping you up and I
had a guess it was a woman up here with
a kid so I was like hi I just looked
really awkward cuz I walked up to the
roof stood here and randomly a Nutella
part nope stood up I didn't sit down
because I wouldn't be in the sunlight
and then I'm drinking a bottle of water
so I looked really really fucking random
i look like i was like plotting a
terrorist plots in a while so that was
kind of weird it was hands down the most
depressing about a son I've ever got on
myself at one point I feel like I was
like milking a dusty nipple but because
I what a jeep wrangler I'm gonna try and
rent one first to see if I even like the
way it drives because if I just hate you
then what's the point in having it so
I'm ringing up a bunch of places try and
see if they've got any for rental right
now through the companies that ranked
don't have it in stock so it's not
looking good I finally made it back cuz
places I'm going trying the Chinese food
so I hope this is damn good open oh yeah
but they're cooking and putting beans on
that table over there 10 out of 10 so
far I haven't even ordered a new phone
and I got a random plate whenever the
Harrises okay the guy works here such a
good guy I went to water like a lot of
feelings like that's what food you want
yo I don't recommend that self
is advising me and give me some soup on
how so okay mmm soup on the house I'll
tell you how it tastes amazing of course
I got salt up chicken oh my god that
looks good taste test this is so good
this food is so good I would say the one
thing is I like all the chicken is so
thin huh super then Oh Oliver the thin
like no chick in there but it tastes so
good it's pretty much just don't look to
be fair I camera they complain it was
only twelve dollars they were young well
do well for originality of name of
Chinese restaurant I give it a 10 out of
10 but for food I give it a six out of
ten it was good but that chicken pieces
was just so dry it was like Gandhi's
flip-flop actually you know what it was
like milking a dry nipple again I don't
know why that statement is a thing for
today but it's like milking a dry nipple
all right just look at this Jeep
Wrangler oh my god there's so fucking
nice i'm trying to ring up a bunch of a
jeep wrangler companies to see if i can
test drive one for a day just so i can
one vlog it and then maybe getting
touchy jeep and see if i can borrow one
for a week to see if I like it and then
fingers crossed let them progresses to
me buying one and just roaming around in
the sand dunes of California the perfect
one just randomly shopping for random
share I just realized there's a pigeon
that is being kept in captivity inside
the shop you see on top of the shell
