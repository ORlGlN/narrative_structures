all right so not exactly the intro you
used to and I daily vlog and stuff like
that but it is Mother's Day today and we
were off to Blackpool zoo for a very
nice day out and on the way out a van
decided to smash into the side of this
van and truck whatever you want to call
it I decided to come around me and smash
up the front of my defender and a lot of
people were asking about it and seen as
though it's Mother's Day today I want to
wish you and your family and everyone
like that a happy Mother's Day if they
are with or without you hope your family
came close together no matter what but
nonetheless I said I was gonna put in
the footage from the incident because
the guy crashed into me failed to pull
over stop in any regards whatsoever
swara was and was on his mobile phone
whilst driving his lot like lorry in the
middle lane of a motorway that should be
doing 70 miles per hour and he was doing
30 and 40 and that several times swerved
into me to try and push me off the road
so enjoy this footage if anyone from the
police wants to grab all this footage
and take care of this guy then please
feel free here's the footage
hello pull over
dick
not luxray police clearly film
everyone's father
pull over Paul don't think about it
clarification indicated and again I'm
gonna try get attention to touch a
potentially go with your puzzle
Oh II just ignore the announcement we've
rang the police pull over
pull up
pull over pull over
thank you I get up at all
over
pulled over hey said two minutes he went
he looked at me said two minutes there's
a title there didn't dimple over money
he didn't hit me in father now for three
minutes
it's absolutely ignored
Oh Yankees oh he's on the phone to
somebody so quick Advocacy Committee
he's on the phone too so delicious
got the phone to someone
yeah he's lucky anything he knows his
dad Chikara he's looking at me Bob
he knows he's got me Shekhar it's just
not it
you can see all of the
absolutely not
this guy should not be allowed I'm
fuckin up
not even in the slightest Nate may
provide evidence where police are a
features
pull over
oh look at him he's often spoken up on
his fucking phone
why is he doing this guy's insane
he's insane what is he doing
I'm in a van with his boat in his hand
stupid crowd they've gone home
even kidding me now you know I know you
were expecting this but this guy was the
most insane driver I've ever seen on the
road the fact that he smashed up the
front of my car drove off immediately in
the motorway didn't expect me to follow
him because he fled the scene of an
accident there was more than enough room
after he smashed into me to pull over he
didn't do I indicated to let him know
like hey you've smashed into me
pull over he acknowledged several times
that like we didn't even get on camera
several times that he was gonna pull
over like you know give me one minute
like two minutes up all over even pike
that he was gonna indicate to move over
there was so much time that we followed
him flat thirty minutes like luckily he
was headed in the same direction we were
going so we still got to our destination
and every Junction he got on the outside
lane as if he was about to pull off and
slow down to the very last minute and
then quickly switch lanes as if we would
lose him or we would carry on going and
he would quickly take a left
and it got to the point where we were
going to Blackpool and it was like
listen we reported this to the police
he's clearly not pulled over within the
time of making the phone call and the
destination that we drove was probably
bout 3540 minutes
this guy had all the right time and like
opportunity to pull over like he should
have done and he didn't do now luckily I
was in a Land Rover Defender which
you'll see the damage in a minute light
wasn't luckily too bad because the
defenders an absolute beast and just
took the hit now if that was anyone or
anyone else's car they would have just
got shredded to pieces it was a massive
truck and luckily the defender took the
brunt of the hit now massive shout out
to Land Rover for making such a beast of
a car but this guy could have done this
to anyone more importantly even after
being in a crash decided to get on his
phone in his hand whilst he was driving
on a motorway where he should have been
doing 70 which have been 35 down the
central Lane and we just couldn't
believe it like that guy needed take big
up off the road if we would have just
pulled over straightaway we could just
handed exchanged details gone the
insurance room but instead he decided to
do this he completely disobeyed the fact
that he should have pulled over
Jerrica an accident he had more than
enough room after immediately crashing
into me to pull over and didn't do in
this circumstance I've been in a road
accident before not driving I have a
motorbike pair top and the
person reversed into my motorbike whilst
it was parked and then they came I was
like oh yeah sorry
that was me you know I'll take care of
it but then they like months down the
line they were like that wasn't me I
didn't drive it so the whole point for
me was to get this on camera make sure
I've got it filmed for the insurance
purposes for the police because this guy
it shouldn't be on the road it could
have caused more damage on the road
I give him more than enough time to come
off and he just didn't more importantly
had my sister and my mom in the car and
he could have endangered them even more
the fact that was on his phone I know it
might be a bit like when it was really
police might deal with it we have done
we're going through the process and
according to them
he's also reported as well which makes
me so thankful because I was assuming
this is gonna be a guy who's even gonna
say I wasn't driving a car I don't have
insurance or something and just managed
to get away but we got his face we got
obviously got his registration and to
anyone out there you can offer any
advice I really appreciate you can find
me on Twitter I will be dealing with
this through the police and that's the
way it should be done I'm not asking for
any like weird like you know here's
nothing like that I'm just saying to
anyone who here who like works for the
police this guy is evidently on his
phone if there's one thing as you guys
know like from my previous vlog I nearly
got run over by a car like a day ago and
that is no one should be on the phone
whilst driving they put out the new rule
that if you're on your phone you get six
points or like get banned and this guy
doesn't even deserve to be on the road
not only cuz he smashed into me but more
importantly the fact that he was on his
phone on a motorway I can't wrap my head
around if I usually see anyone on the
phone I will beat them tan to get off
the phone when I brought him a bike I'll
tell him to get off the phone so the
fact that this all went down and then he
jumped me phone afterwards just blows my
absolute mind I've got no words however
it didn't ruin the rest of my day I had
a lovely Mother's Day on my mum I know
it sounds odd you'll see that tomorrow
clever stuff from the day before the
next day but I just waited to get this
voyage online straight away saw some
action can be taken with it because it's
just absolutely ridiculous what he did
well I just want to put this out to you
guys just to be like stay safe on the
roads you know always be like like aware
of your surroundings and if this goes
down again you know always bring the
police if you've got a passenger in the
car recorded because so many times you
know experience of friends and stuff
that I know someone will crash into them
they'll play the good guy and then be
like oh I didn't do it I didn't do it so
if you've got that on camera then you're
absolutely set but more importantly the
next thing I'm going to be buying is a
dashcam nonetheless enjoy me eating a
potato and there you go how in your
right mind knowing you actually hit
someone's vehicle can you put not pull
over
that's what I can't see but like if I if
I go into a crash you know like I'm
gonna pour over
I wouldn't even in my mind not consider
not put over when that's like that I
could have smashed into like 20 other
people on the way not knowing this was
there every every caring for me I
could've been absolutely pinga don't you
like it could be unicorn in him I'm
gonna have to I'm gonna have to bend
this off now because that's just not
safe to drive though time for a new time
for a bigger stronger
all right Mother's Day Lady Penelope all
right I guess that's the best we're
gonna get it for now other than that I
don't think the steering was effective I
think your defender can handle the
massive rock being thrown out it can
handle the truck in it my baby I've
basically been surviving off crisps
sandwiches and all sorts of weird
somewhere geez just chicken strips of
junk I'm taking care of the bacon taking
care of the cheese and Lydia's why'd you
call that mush you're buying what you're
flying the potato adds a proper jacket
