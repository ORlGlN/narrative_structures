born in worlds of fluffy hair Tom I'm
waiting for my breakfast to get brother
to my front door boy I don't know
whether he's coming or not
you package to package package to
package package yeah thank goodness been
waiting for this like for so long I left
my back in the UK with you
Smash Bros Super Mario Bros a and I'm
assuming Mario cast inside there oh my
god did I know already Mario Kart oh my
god did that wait
Do Not Call Me Mario Kart Oh fuck's sake
I didn't order my own car about
everything else apart from Mario car
also sad no in England
these just got made illegal to drive on
the pavement you have to ride them in
the road because this is a motorized
vehicle how fucked up is that I'm kind
of glad that I didn't bring one all the
way over to the UK anymore and that all
minor in the u.s. bought still I correct
every Tim I quit every Tim like if I had
to think about it the amount of people
who got them that I know of for
Christmas cuz they're like oh christmas
is coming I want one of them now they
can't use it half the time so riperoni
pepperoni ah so on today's menu what do
we have what do we have we have we have
Mian I mean how do I get in this thing
we have a chicken Caesar salad with
Caesar sauce but I don't like Caesar
sauce so I got ranch on the solenoid mmm
they're nice y'all gonna like I don't
know why I do this to myself
orange cara drink hmm
Nullah phone
it tastes healthy therefore it tastes
like shit what do you know about that
coke panini when I ordered that food
before I also got Vinny any put it the
fridge and it's now like all moist and
wet but I literally have nothing else to
eat so I'm starving so I'm eating this
and now we'll play a bit of CS ago so
bring it the fuck on five and a half
hours worth of wives trimming done I
haven't even certain my Wii U yeah I
haven't even gone shopping for a new
desk yet so this room is still just
looking like a bombshell I need to go to
the shop and go and get some milk some
cereal and basically just supplies for
existing for here but I'm kind of like
do I want to go don't want to go it's
it's not exactly walking distance to get
the shot but it's not exactly tapti
distance so if I order a taxi the person
who just picked me up and drops me off
he's just gonna be insanely pissed off
at me and I kinda don't want to do that
so I think we're going on a walk and by
the way remember that orange drink that
I got today I left it on the side didn't
drink it and that's what came out of it
if someone cares to remind me why I
walked out of my building in a hoodie
and jogging bones I'd like now some
fucking boil in my tits off it's so hot
outside don't care if it's like 8
o'clock Anisha be cooler weather when
Ellen got some shit fucking sweating my
dick off so I just decided to go and use
like a normal store like ok so you know
like soups not like a Walmart at bonds
and Asda Morrison's but with them
they're everywhere here in LA and
there's one Dyke down the road for me
where I live so I was like oh yeah I
usually go to that place like go and get
stuff for the house and I thought you
know what today I'm actually go to like
the local market not like no like
healthy and just like you know a local
grocery store so I went there and I was
like yeah I guess in cereal I'll show
you what I got show up I got shot got
cereal you only this is not like
imported stuff cereal cereal some cops
and a bottle of coke $23 I will never be
going there again I'm almost tempted
just to leave that there for as long as
possible to see what happens to it I
feel like it might grow legs and evolve
both boys nonetheless we have cured
cured but quiets and kraid some so Cocoa
Krispies we will survive and by the way
if you're wondering what they are
curtains gonna replace them shitty lines
with some beautiful fashionable blackout
curtain so sit no sunlight yes and wakes
me up in the monic bitch I was supposed
to go to the cinemas with minilab booked
me that doesn't want to go so I'm all
alone by myself playing video games
alright boys this is gonna be a really
bad idea but I'm gonna be trying my
washing machine for the first time ever
today his instructions but I like I
never read instructions I just kind of
go with it plus like what I put it on
like say heavy like let's say yeah cold
I was watching cold like cold let's do
cold cold wait this cold cold this cool
cold this close called is warm cold and
hot cold I think I'll just go with cool
cold load sighs we'll say it's pretty
large
and yeah fingers crossed
ah okay so it would have been useful to
read the instructions cuz I just realize
that this is in fact the dryer and this
is in fact the washing machine protip
read the instructions god dammit I
already messed up again so this is the
hole you're supposed to throw it in I
already dropped his fucking sock down
the side and I can't move this to get to
my sock rip saw and got the socks okay
and then he goes and I am a grown-up
first time using the new washing machine
