them holy shit as all your on the Train
successfully and goodness but what I
definitely can say is this is an exactly
first-class meal book do the absolute
job every time I go to gaming events I
never eat enough food and by the end of
the day like shaking you can't see it
but like
shaking on the inside I'm dying oh it's
time to get me off this train I've been
on it for two hours playing a monkey
balloon tower-defense five for a full
two hours it was the best two hours of
my life but yeah I'm so tired
I just want to go to bed alrighty then
we've made it home back to my house in
the UK I got something to show you guys
I probably did show it in the vlog but I
literally can't remember so I'm just
gonna do it again anyway as you guys
recall I managed to get a world record
up here as you can see with dantdm this
is my first ever guinness world record
dantdm and we were playing rocket league
that was dead cool and then I got
another world record which was on burn
Bret is finally the case in another
world record which was it was me with me
and ali-a in black ops 3 dead dead
awesome
but whilst I've been away now the guy's
a Guinness World Record I spoke to in
the past they were like because I've
been the number one most followed twitch
streamer and a long time I know I
haven't streamed in like six months but
they gave me the world record for having
the most twitch followers to this date
on this day on the channel syndicate so
yeah pretty fucking awesome or this
probably like my most proud award out of
these two these three but now I have
three Guinness World Records so I might
end up just making this wall all
Guinness World Records sort of thing
like I want to do one that's like a
selfie train so like the most selfies
taken in a meet-up sort of thing and
that the fastest and then I want to do
something fast is the amount of money
raised in a certain time in like a
certain way or something so I know I
want to think of like some cool
challenge but yeah it looks like this
this one's come out with it so I'm gonna
try and pop that back in without damages
so let's just leave that to one side for
now but yeah got myself another Guinness
World Record I've had an amazing day and
the best way to finish an amazing day is
with many pancakes from Kings man the
rest of my night will now consist of
eating the potato can-can cakes can cake
pancakes with I chose pain above some
reason I wanted enough Telep I didn't
have any and watching the rest of Gotham
I'm dying to what the hell is going on
here dying to just finish the TV show
and the reason why is I know there's a
season three coming out and it's
supposed to be like amazing like
everyone's high opinion she'll ever
Gotham season
two is like 20 episodes long and it's
driving me crazy because it's really my
sleep schedule because I try and just
sit and finish like a series in one go
so I can get it get all the way I watch
it in like a day or two and then I can
enjoy the rest of my life like I love
watching the show but man it ruins my
sleep schedule so now I'm like okay I
watch this and I've been doing that same
process for like a week now and I've
been going to bed every night at 5:00
p.m. so it's not acceptable I mean 5
a.m. not acceptable went about saying
that and then addicted to the TV show
narcos was up to like 6 a.m. and now no
joke well it's an hour legs have been
editing the vlog but I woke up at 3 p.m.
in the afternoon so yeah another day
pretty much wasted because of TV shows
and Netflix luckily like I'm kind of
addicted to the TV show now cause at the
same time I kind of know the outcome so
it's like I because it's based on
history so my Carradine know what
happened so either way I'm gonna wrap up
today's vlog obviously the next day I've
done nothing all day like I've been
awake for an hour so yeah what can I do
within six hours of the rest of this day
you'll have to wait and see
for tomorrow's vlog so until then thank
