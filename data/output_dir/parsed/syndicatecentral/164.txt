Christ you scared me you man what on the
road I'm getting my bag and I'm going to
London and how am I getting to London my
own personal taxi service
aka can a person just hear this car
you're gonna crash into the wall you did
not see me with my house so when I see
people promoting films I always forget
the date they actually said so remember
right now
October 5th if the day bleh Runa Runa
nice Bladerunner 2049 comes out October
5th when is it October 5th leave a
comment down below October 5th
oh my god there's so many cars of
traffic but if there's one person who
can get me every time it was even you
were Tom McCallum but it's definitely
you today get off thank you I believe in
you Johnny but we can get there by train
is at 23 minutes past however witting up
to the train station actor 21st might
miss my train
that's the train I'm supposed to begin
on however there was a fire in London so
I spoke to a dude and he said your
ticket is valid to get you to your
destination no matter what train you
take it can get you to London
so I'm now getting on a train that's
going to take me to Doncaster and then
from Doncaster to Kings Cross I think
did it no time to eat this is from
Manchester to Doncaster and Ellen's
different Doncaster to London Kings
Cross which is on platform 1 on time
platform seven eight
I think I'm going up think I'm going
down this way yes wait because there's a
buck from zero what huh
this is the next train which I don't
know how long is it gonna take me I'm
supposed to be in London pretty much now
I'm supposed to be in London like the
next three minutes but I think this
train might take me an actually two
hours so this one came with a bit of
dinner instead will not say no to
potatoes covered in something and a bit
of chicken noise before I need to be
down in London I'm hoping that because
my delays I'm not actually late to where
I'm supposed to be going but I have to
ask is this door supposed to be open
I don't shoot no made it to London no
look at that little London buses around
little pieces of artwork I don't even
know what that is but you know what
there's buskers and everything and I had
to work out how to get from here to my
hotel probably a terrible day to come
into London because there's currently
been a fire in London and a bombs going
home and so this police this is my hotel
just gonna enter I'll take it that's a
hell just gonna need to put this in here
so I can reveal it ladies and gentlemen
welcome to my room
that's a TV that's a TV got a nice ass
chair over here bottles of water got a
fancy ice that looks company is it comfy
or that feels nice but it always
determines on the bathroom
it's got touch screen bathroom wide
phone on the wall built in by a speaker
this is very nice I like it you got some
robes on the back I have to admit I
don't think I have much of a view
you need a clean your room this is
pretty cool now I've seen this once
before in a hotel they give you this to
take with you so like say if you know
like you're tourists and you don't have
a date upon you can take this with you
and have internet everywhere free during
your stay that's so sick yeah we should
probably check the internet speeds on
this phone been here for five seconds
I accidentally factory reset the phone
broke jeans on my shoes on and get rock
and roll in to where I'm suppose to be
hating do they lend you a tablet oh no
sorry I think that I hit rebuff that's
just a thing to be able to control the
lights with when you open this cupboard
you're like oh that's nice look coffee
machine don't know how to use them ones
that struggle look at what they give you
in here look at what they give you no
one cares about the sweet and salty
popcorn a human series mini eggs gummy
bears is normal but millions in a hotel

Zealand until I get in bed and have a
shower and stuff this hotel right now is

stuffing and these guys are looking
sweet not gonna lie if I had the balls
to pull off this sort of fashion sense I
would that is looking hella fancy see

hipsters are part of the goddamn movie

aprox Bowie an array of crops using
different seeds of gray root of 2049 how

what are you alone I need your help
brings hi
I can definitely say that was pretty
damn dope big screen now it's time to
get back to my hotel guess they were
prepping for bad weather walked outside
free umbrella dear every company in the
world ever trying to advertise or
promote something this is how it's done
you put a beautiful man like Ryan
Gosling up there and advertise the
living shit out of it oh my god are
these beautiful gotta admit that was one
hell of an experience i watch the the
first ever Blade Runner on a plane so
the scream was absolutely tying it and
the quality therefore it was just it was
just crap so to be able to watch it like
that was just a true experience
especially to be the director and stuff
while that was absolutely we didn't get
to ask them questions who listens like a
little Q&A they didn't it was really
good
but we saw 15 minutes of the new film at
the end of this and Ryan Gosling's still
beautiful goddamn man I can't wait to
see the new film and hopefully I get
invited back here to watch it on the
same size screen again there'll be hella
nice can I tell you my massive fail from
today all right so it's coming down to
London you know like for promotion for
the new Blade Runner film which comes
out October 5th by the way just another
shot there but so yeah I am because no
big fail was I thought I was coming to
London to watch it and we didn't watch
it it wasn't a premiere thought it was a
screening with the director
we watched the old one because he was
like an original like it was a like
there was one before it and this is like
later on the table it's Blade Runner 20
49 yeah this was watching that but in
better quality like a remastered version
of it and then the show does 50 minutes
than anyone so I kind of failed yeah
really good I really want to go Ryan
Gosling Ryan Gosling look good it I said
like I walked out Sarah I was liked as
an attractive guy so I'm gonna have to
take you
at the same place because the screen was
like cuz I'm up so we would check here
