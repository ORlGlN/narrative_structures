good warded world oh you join we have
good news today
David the legend who found my wallet on
the plane
just text me back with his address so we
have to make him a swag package a damn
swag package and there's I make up of a
woman here dammit this is why I love
social media paiute like where do I buy
a bike in a lie and then Trek goats
which we got child with them but then
send me a picture of a bike with a bus
yard it was like guys what the fuck but
then basically the hook we will load and
then I found I found the bike that I
think I want it looks sleek it looks
sexy and I think I want it inside me
it is currently 249 if they have some in
stock then that we will definitely
trouble to go and get it
I'm feeling getting a bike today
hopefully I can just go in and get it
and like ride out so if we can then
let's get it done adventure type and we
are going to the mall to try and find
that sofa like I said we're not gonna
leave with it but we're gonna go check
it out measure it up see if it's the one
we won and ya think we are gonna get it
as exercise we got to get fit gotta get
done legs getting turned like a bird
this is where we're going to get horse
over there she is
oh look so damn comfy
so this oh my god it's on sale yes now I
really like this sofa it's really good
done nice it's suede which is perfect
and it has the electrical buttons on the
side which is perfect now this thing is
absolutely perfect I'd get it longer go
in this way and hopefully it'd be
perfect but the problem is sofa shopping
is I did just see another one over there
that I like somebody I'll check that out
and see what I think the good thing with
having one big sofa like wrap around is
that it's like cozy but at the same time
it's a bit too cozy if you're like a
party or is if you have individual ones
yes can sometimes better just kind of
like separate it but I want cozy
I want cozy this is the same cell friend
bro I just had a brain fart revolution I
was supposed to get sofa bed in case
people came and stopped over the house
oh it would be a very smart decision to
get sofa bed rather than as
because this is not a sofa someone could
sleep on it's way too small such the
really cool thing about the sofa you can
have these drinks holders like this
thing comes out so it looks like a
segment this comes out but the really
cool thing about it is the drink holders
and USB chargers in here obviously
storage for remotes and stuff I think I
would get one of these seats
additionally to make it longer that way
and then it would be a pimp-ass thing
but I just don't think people go be able
to sleep on it
that's my only downside there's me
thinking about other people thinking
about my friends and family go fuck
yourselves this couldn't be better
timing I don't think because I've just
found out that this is the sofa now
right and this is usually like four
grand but it's on sale for 1800 so what
if I would've bought it when I was last
out here it would cost me so much more
money like double but now it's not
bought these things recline look at
recline is that int anyway so someone
could literally sleep on that you can
actually weigh back enough to be able to
sleep on it and then I don't know about
this one I don't know how far this goes
out do you have to sleep with this one
does the same if I don't break this then
this could be there you go I didn't know
the place for someone to sleep look at
this so I've actually got two extra
places for people to sleep I could
totally sleep on this oh you could lay
across it I don't need a fucking sofa
bed there take finance classes to know
not to get a mortgage or a credit card
life skills my dad taught me well if you
don't have money don't spend it just
like that we did it I actually probably
came in on the best day possible
there was a damn sale on last day of the
sale managed to get it literally saved
myself 2 grand
just by going back to the UK and
returning and then buying the sofa for
Gia ok this looks a bit too fancy for my
liking but I like that that name is
called Vera Wang this is more like it
plates and plates and more plates I like
this this is good this is what again man
I came shopping on the right day 40% off
fuck yeah
now do I go square I do I go circular
square or rectangular I could not make a
straight decision right now one thing
this Christmas decorations everywhere
that's getting me excited hello
but - I cannot make a sensible decision
right now because I need the fucking
toilet I've done that swore again foot
that's not smashed oh okay so I thought
each one of these boxes actually carry
four things inside it wrong it comes
with one of each and you have to so I
need six or I need eight so I have to
carry eight boxes fuck this is where I
would just use Amazon and get it
delivered to my door but I kind of need
a bowl for breakfast cut through my last
paper one away today I totally forgot
about getting a toaster I might get a
little mini toaster like this one a
little cups toaster but I need to go get
some knives and forks
so let's fucking do it yeah well
realistically I don't need these little
Forks I don't need these little spoons i
flippin you like a few of these so I'm
not gonna get them I'm gonna get this
because this comes with 12 so it's four
of these just perfect for them so much
space in the bag that's so unnecessary
I need two of these so I've ate this and
now I have cups so I have sixteen cups
it comes with these Emmys exactly what I
need and then I get this one for wine
glasses and shit where are the shot
glasses
I came for some knives and forks and I'm
leaving with the entire goddamn store no
it's like halfway through November and
there's Christmas music on the radio
this is amazing
I'm so muffin yo snap my elevators got
wooden flooring what the hell I'm gonna
move all these all of these to my
apartment whoa Joey that was so much
hard work to get this all up here ah
uber driver you're a legend people the
shopping mall here help me move my bags
you're legends I need to get some food I
got a bowl of cereal this morning and
I'm not eating anything since so I think
we're gonna have to eat 20 for some food
immediately all may I finally got a
kettle for my British tea look I got a
see-through one so
so that's a bit it's a bit nifty and
Fundy look oh it's blue so I got that so
I can have literally cups of tea
Oh oh my god I have soup oh I want staff
- nothing this is gonna be like the
first thing I've ever cooked somewhat I
know it's not cooking but made in my
house apartment and it goes sweet three
minutes

like blew me off that I would not be a
fan of dead do it right it's making a
lot of noise it's done and it smells
great

basically getting everything washing all
the you know washing them all still the
ready a job a dishwasher but I'm washing
my by hand just so they can start like
drying off and get rid of all the dust

the room my office and eat my soup and
then just relax for a bit I deserve a
break

steal your fucking skins oh my god
reclaimer what did I win
what about win by Oh English I guess I
better get this all started and unpacked
wash a bunch of these put my way it's
nice to see my cupboard start getting
filled up
I'm tempted to not pop glasses in there
and instead put soups and put my glasses
in here closest to the sink but I don't
know I it develops over time but these
these are the most hipster glasses that
I've ever seen in my life bought all my
friends in LA like see Nana's all those
dudes always drink out these when we go
to bar so decided to pick some of these
up gonna go wash these ones I decided to
pick some up just like when they come
round it can help cells to a drink is
gonna be pretty cool and I've decided
that like my table but I'm gonna get for
the apartment I'm thinking of getting
some a really really cool so like my
couch is gonna go along there and down
which is I was worried it wasn't gonna
be big enough but it's gonna be more
than then obviously the big unit there
on the side which is gonna look really
awesome but then here like a circular
table like four chairs which I'm
thinking I'm thinking of having it as
like you know what on tables where the
top comes off and inside it it's a poker
table like a yeah a poker table for a
little bit like playing cards is the
fire so I go try and get one in front of
them online but if you guys have
suggestions for anything in this
apartment like any cool ideas and leave
it down below one of mine like I said is
I'm thinking of maybe getting rid of the
blot like they were they were blind then
I got curtains installed they're not big
enough so god we get in replaced but I
was thinking about getting them
completely taken down I'm putting up
electric wire so I could just press
switches and then like electric heat in
electric you know front door all that
sauce stuff because it's just just
better but I don't know we'll see how
things go boy yeah I'm getting
domesticated man it's like it's pretty
cool even though I got domesticated and

there they're drying there's nothing
like that I don't know I didn't use the
dishwasher I use that I use that instead
