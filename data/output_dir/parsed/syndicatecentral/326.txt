it's been beautiful there's one thing I
cannot forget about this apartment
ron's watch these ones today yes my
jeans are way too long but you know what
I'm going to wear these bad boys cuz I
think you look nice
ok apartment you have done me proud I
will love you forever and ever
and I should be back eventually sometime
soon we think oh this is the spot not
too bad my house called Oh magic I
soaked up the spot grill and I have to
say this right now it's out here or what
looks like a lemonade stand
which is great I'm firing this but these
chicken wings I got from there if you're
ever in Los Angeles go to this place
these are like a 9.5 to tiny but it's
like $6 for stick but he gave me crap
loads so I'm happy with that book oh my
god like a like a 9.5 really really good
getting a little bit of munch inside me
before I head to the airport and have to
fly away I got dropped off at the wrong
gate that stuff that doesn't mean I miss
my flight
but I don't have a confident feeling
about it being up to finer details we
shall see we shall push it I take it
back it works I thought my flight was at
3 o'clock it is now 152 and my flight
board at 220 up Oh Kate made it
through security and it is firmer busy
all I do is make it to gate 65 a-and I
should be fooled
that said I think it's 65 a that's not
sure sure San Francisco holy that was a
lot of San Francisco five good day with
Delta okay and then 65 800 yeah that
makes me so feel confident about my
flight 65 a and a loading screen has
crashed I don't know what's more
terrifying the fact that it crashed or
the fact that it's Windows 7 and not
Windows 10
area and tents and next up Wi-Fi
position
very down to the other question I
it's crazy we have less than an hour to
get to my International Terminal the
home going to manage this book if I make
my next flight
I will be very impressed I have to go
through all secure as well
and I've got about 50 minutes to go
goodness what I'm looking for all
terminals this way catch the train to
the International Swimming I'll try and
get through security and make it look
like thank God I'm not shaking the bag
I'm just carrying a carry-on and we're
trying to upgrade my flight as well so
leave a comment now if you think I'm
going to make it
what do you have this Airport an
absolutely massive
but there's virgin on it have now
exactly 25 minutes it's all my fight and
let's see if they'll still let me only
get me to Stuart's fastly whoo yeah

last person on the plane try to get up
grandpa slides closed like the doors
were closed and because it's why it's
closed
oh great okay I made my flight
it it's a win almost didn't make the
flight great but luckily usually like
British Airways when you on the plane
you can upgrade but thank God I could
such a pretty pretty money which is
grain bought it's like an empty fly so I
got to see for myself and I've got
change absolutely thought let's get my
boys out yes one talking about look how
big they are

incredible and a very very glass that is
that it's we're so complete but it's
time for a taste test of my writing must

good
uh between what passengers now collide

minds or kind of pilot wash they're so
damn good what a good feeling I have now

every award order disorder and this guy
is an incredible actor so I'm going to
give this score of 10 suza finished ok
so to be fair I have to watch my
because I fell asleep German it was good
up until what I saw up alack I really
cannot sleep on this plane simply

stealing I'm saying this now
whoever wrote the script for Assassin's
Creed was truth that was the worst film
I've ever seen the story in comes when I
lost closes blind they've gone from day
to night
two hours later
is the donater place on a in a mall
I just finished watching the film lights
out and it is terrifying it's a really
really good scare very accurate like at

en Washington pretty good so far so good
at L 3 o'clock game elemental is Eva
which we submit is 11:00 a.m. in the UK
relented in forgiving inside sphero's
jetlag and somehow lost my come well
that would have been absolutely making
her a tour grateful when I found out of
my theater talking to the girls on
foster halfway to the fight the guy came
in for able charge if you see of a
purpose your pay for the upgrade was a
lot of money fight nice today when I go
closest thing and but anyways at the end
when technology business communication
of my walk unless we're going to let you
upgrade for free but it's already on
turns machine we can't we can't give me
a reason for our oh no words the fella
by count so that would have been really
really cool if I were to go there's a
prison break
also I got one watch and don't forget
the best I've got runs watch which is
now successfully made it from Cayman
Island to Miami Miami to the UK head to
London London to Manchester and then has
gone from Manchester to London London to
New York New York to LA and then LA to
San Fran San Fran to Manchester England
get in there all the way around the
world I like I'll put my sunglasses on
when we're up in the clouds and then
we've come down into Manchester it's
completely miserable encryption and that
may be the fastest I've ever gone
through an airport in my life
