them there's 200 is exactly 200
is he right in that comfy chair there
you yeah movin s and then what we might
do is she was a college hockey geeks
geeks you little shit no they called pop
vinyls but what we might do is wear your
satya we might build another set of
bookshelves there so it looks like it
wraps around so it looks that cool and
then I could put even more up oh yeah I
went through and organized all of them
and it turns out I do have every single
one of them in number odd and now
reorganize look at this like you do have
the Allies like the change bonds the
original ends the baddies which was
absolutely amazing the vehicles which
was absolutely look at that Austin my
db5 I tell you what I'm gonna buy one of
them in my lifetime I'm gonna buy an
Aston Martin db5 like that that is my
dream dream cab the phone James Bond cat
and then I modified so a metal plate
comes out the back talking because
honest to God favorite car of all time
loved collecting these as a kid like
absolutely loved collecting them as a
kid so cool you are what's in this box
close your eyes keep them closed
I said keep him closed you little bugger
it's a katana like a fun gave me as a
gift called Antony good friend don't cut
yourself my god I had this that just
randomly found it in a box in there it
was from a 21st birthday
remember this got my Uncle Carl for me
21st birthday don't know where it's been
all this time but it's one of the first
ever arrived pistols that I use I tell
you what we could actually use it to try
and take out the crows she would kill
him
should we have them yeah skew it well
unfortunately we would like to say this
bad boy is capable of killing anything
but like you have to lift it off knock
it down for something to go in it and
then your fire and it's just like it
just kind of flops out the end so don't
think this is gonna be our weapon of
choice to go killing the crows the dew
looks muddled nickel Oh nickel-plated
cool sports market g10 air pistol oh it
does fire dance interesting
you better not just walked in we were
ghettos wet Oh goofy max you know coming
again you well coming again mm-hmm never
garage is looking much nicer and clean
and now got my dad to get rid of all
those like wooden cabinets not cabinet's
modern panels at the back and stuff like
that and then I'm thinking about maybe
sticker all in that wall like putting
posters up on it and stick Obama in the
shower that he might be dead cool but ya
got revolt pieces of crap wood on the
floor looking much much neater I'm
tempted to try and see like I've
actually managed to get the Audi TT in
here before but we drove it in words
then outwards then out and oh my god was
that a difficult task so I'm going to
quickly flip the Audi around Dada
flip the car around dead easy it is at I
tell you what it is a tight path this
like it's not crazy tight but like if we
would have just had like the house
raised because it's unlike the old plans
like say that was the front doorstep of
the old house the front door this new
step had to be in the exact same place
but if we could have raised the house we
could have made this Drive like gone
across the entire way
so much room it been so much better but
this tree has got preservation order on
it so you can't like remove the tree or
anything like that but it's a bit
unfortunate but one of the plans were
for this house is where this one set
where this garage is here we were going
to like get rid of the garage front door
there and having it be not against the
wall the guys are going to go from there
to there
at summer I could get done but it'd just
be a little more building work a little
more cost but then I could drive my car
in to here pack it straight forward
press a button and it would turn my car
around facing me so that I could just
get in it everyday there so I could
drive my bike my cars are in my backside
and everything so be cool or projects
have everyone do it a future bar gives
me plans for for the rest of my life
over there
you don't go TT done good I got a lot of
stuff that I need to do today I gotta go
like go shopping I've got to get my car
