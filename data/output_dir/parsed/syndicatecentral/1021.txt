Marlett yeah I decided to get up this
morning I was gonna make myself some
some cereals from Captain Crunch well
that's it and you know I've been fine
and happy dandy with that but then
something just clicked I was like nope
I've got feet I've got walking shoes
even I kind of didn't put the walking
shoes on and I'm going to take a little
hike to get to the nearest I hop so busy
road to try and find out where the
nearest I hope this go take me quite a
while but I don't really care because I
want some pancakes I'm not actually
creepy and I'm not even craving bacon
we've got bacon back home
great rainy background well it's been it
was raining last night itself everyone
dead moist and wet feels nice it feels
like it naturally this really does feel
like England so I just thought you know
what I looked about to pull the bag of
Captain Crunch I was like nope stopped
it got my wallet got my key got dressed
I'm heading to I hop now where
apparently there's a nick we said
there's another key breakfast and my
hair looks a mess everything looks max I
think but I'm a freaking shower anything
I was just like I wanna get up I wanna
go wanna go get some food I don't cook
it myself
so I guess that's the benefit of fast
food I think it's healthy you know okay
I can't see why it's not and I hope this
London walking on someone to walk across
field to field to field I hope this
isn't my private land otherwise I think
they have priority to be able to shoot
me so this is before me if I get shot on
video
I start getting shot or standing like a
lung mite or some shit LA or rattlesnake
well but then yeah with weird weird
sleeping schedule last night we ended up
what going bed like half 11 but we went
to bed on the floor we've had air
mattresses because we're waiting for the
bed to be
and I'm focused in case I do stamina
madness is Sunday as well so pretty
tight that be open he's open 24/7 I hope
but if it's no open a little bit bad bro
so I'm looking really busy till now
everyone just can't be asked cooking ok
that's why fast food exists that's why I
exist I think I'm the baby of fast food
well yes up to the fore I don't cake
just that this is really bad cough I
hopefully it clears up pretty soon but
it's not doing so Kate still taking a
medicine for a ears and a kind of flu
and I'm just wrap man up because she
kept coughing so much so she didn't want
to wake me up which is really nice and
respectful of her but I'm not too
bothered a rapper she would've stayed
with me but we need to get a bed ASAP so
that we can sleep like therapists it's
sleeping on a 4th I'm just gonna go to
like Walmart and buy a bookshelf bed and
so we get our actual bed in a week so
you can understand why I would well
because I know I've got a week to wait
for it have a bit like yeah yeah to find
out where got Google Apps you see I just
loaded Internet real quick before I went
and so you do your max fiii help and I
should be great baby will your faces and
tree stop
