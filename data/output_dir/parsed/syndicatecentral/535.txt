oh my god can we just take a second to
appreciate how amazing J is one I'm not
why did you go if you were about to
drive my car for me I didn't realize
that I was on the website you like look
for the gears to click I got down to the
per volume this time all right
okay so we're another day in England
we've done balls all today because it's
six o'clock right now we're about to go
get some Chinese food cuz we're
absolutely fucking starving hands down
without a doubt the best Chinese
restaurant ever if you're in Woodleigh
lots of the smell it's good we look like
we're having a party what yeah this we
did order a shitload retriever discount
Jay this is my favourite chicken of all
time called song pepper chicken pieces
why'd you grab a piece and try it shot
good Oh God thank you yeah
oh 10 fucking 10 bro tell me that's not
10 I gave Nick attends oh oh come on oh
yeah that's right oh my it seems I
cannot avoid drama now this is actually
the next day and I've already recorded
this entire story of what happened but
I'm just gonna go over again today just
because there's a resolve to the
situation but in summary I was getting
sued by Domino's Pizza yesterday because
one the colour MacGregor fight was going
on I ordered pizzas up to my house I ate
my pizza I pay for it by credit card
everything was absolutely fine cuz I was
thrown a pie at my house and there's a
bunch people round at my house
and those random people they all repeats
up to the house as well not by my credit
card nothing to do with me they just
ordered food to my house now the driver
who came and dropped off the food
chopped up the pizza but didn't take the
money no one I don't know what what
happened why I didn't get paid why I
didn't take his money on what what what
but anyway the next day like 8 p.m. I
get a knock at my door and Domino's
Pizza guy turns up is that I want my
money and I'm like I paid my card he was
like he's like no there's another order
that didn't get paid for now I'm like ok
I didn't order the pizza I don't know
who ordered the piece so I don't know
what I can do if he's like what you need
to owe me the monix it's your house and
I was like well it's someone ordered
like a thousand pounds worth a bit in
this house and it wasn't man I'm not
gonna pay for it you know I just doesn't
make sense
the guy was demanding and like
shouting that I gave him the money for
this pizza so explain to the guy like
listen I'd send a message to the people
around at the house if someone owns up
for adding the pizzas I'll make sure I
get the money drop it up and he's like
no I'm not leaving without the money and
I was like okay dude we're not going to
get anywhere get your manager on the
phone I spoke to his manager on the
phone and he was like it was like okay
I'll deal with this so the manager
disappeared and I was like I guess
everything is sorted I might get a phone
call just saying if I can get hold of
the money please bring it to the store I
would have no problem doing it whilst I
was at the door I had the guy ring me in
front of me he rang me twice my phone
went off and asked to deliver his issue
ring he was like yeah that's the number
I have on your account I was like yes
because it's my house my address that's
probably why the guy disappeared and
there's me thinking that is everything
taken care of so obviously that's not
the case about two hours later I'm
surely not watching TV and I receive a
text saying this okay we will go in
civil court I need my money and then my
full address and I'm like what is this
some sort of troll or something and then
I get another text saying I will see you
in civil court bye
I'm like some trolls got my number just
fucking me or something like that and I
realize the number of the top looked
familiar and I was like wait a minute
it's not the same number of the delivery
driver who rang me and it turns out it
was sunlight hang on a minute I've got
the delivery guy from Domino's texting
me on my personal number threatening me
with my address saying that he's gonna
take me to court over the pizzas that
wasn't paid for there's no way that this
is like Domino's procedure to get money
for this sort of situation so I was like
there's no point me dealing with this
driver I'm just gonna deal with the the
manager instead so the managers talk
just told me to ignore any text off him
and that you'd handle the situation and
that all you did was apologize can I
send him the message of all the texts
between us and I sent him everything he
was just like yeah this is outrage again
like if I could have just give him the
money I absolutely would've done but as
you guys saw in like the vlog today we
went and got Chinese food and I went and
got cash from the Chinese for the from
the cash machine to pay for the Chinese
food so I didn't have any fucking money
on me said just bloody spent it
so really shitty situation but Sammy the
manager was dead cool and hit me up from
his like listen sorry about the
inconvenience don't listen to what he
said just ignore him sort of thing and
next time you order we'll give you a
full free meal for your like you and
your friend saw things I was like
appreciate that sorry for any
inconvenience again if we do find out
who owes the money we'll make sure you
run it any because I appreciate that so
yeah that's the situation of me getting
sued by Domino's so me and Jeff we're
talking about
