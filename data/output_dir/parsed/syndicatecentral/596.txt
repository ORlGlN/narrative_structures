super disgusted but I'm doing it for
Alec because I promised you I would do
it as long as you do it so let's get to
the store and get the ingredients step 1
obtain the ingredients item number 1 - 2
for organic carrots
you can do this next item to organic
apples perfect the worst item of the lot
and organic beet I need to locate a knob
of ginger this is going to be difficult
I think hope you guys have realized how
it zoomed in my back cameras I haven't
got my case on that like zooms it out so
I'm sorry about out it sucks last but
not least a knob of ginger okay a ginger
root I guess is what I'm going to use
unless it's that but I'm gonna go with
that what I'm gonna do is go and pay for
this and then they've actually got a
juicing place here this might just try
and see if I can get them to do it for
me rather than happy to go out and buy a
juicer because I just need to know set
so I'll go and ask if not we're going
buying a juicer as well because alyc I'm
gonna get it done now Alex said to me
that he puts pineapple juice in his to
make it taste a bit better so I'm gonna
try and pick up some like natural panel
which is obviously just Pantages I'm
gonna struggle time finally brought so I
got that we're getting out and going
it's unfortunately won't blend it for me
because the machines turned on so thanks
a bunch Whole Foods
best photo is closed for target wasn't
too far away after 20 min Drive so go
into oxy the taxis waiting outside with
my bag of beets and carrots and shit and
I'm in the elevator going up there have
to hold you so I've got to be honest I
don't have a goddamn clue what a goddamn
juice it looked like I think it's one of
these aha found it okay so we don't need
blunders
we need a juicer and this one seems okay
yeah big mouth juice extractor perfect
how much better this wide-angle lens is
look if I take it off
get ready fruit to go from like this -
that looks so much more like viewing
angle it's amazing let's get this bad
boy unbox set off and get these beats
beat what these beats these beats
squeezed out but this is a random quick
plug I don't want to be sold out yet but
you guys do tell The Syndicate original
stealth hoodies that everyone liked went
crazy for last time we released them
there are now back online so if you want
to get one and go syndicate original
come and get yourself one as well as I
think these beanies so if you want
yourself a little beanie even though
it's summer but you want one because I'm
now wearing I mean you can see how
fucking awesome now this little thing

original calm and go check it out
sponsored this is such a professional
set up I'm using right now so basically
summarize how it in your being fuck what
am i doing this what why why am i doing
this the difficult way you're basically
being a Len against some peanut butter
and if the peanut butter falls my camera
footfalls on my phone will smash so yay
- Tom being the most organized I was
like the worst unboxing I think I've
ever done in my life
Wow well I think you might be ready to
go I should probably wash it off first I
can't be fucking bothered the goodness
in the beets carrots and apples I'm
assuming will outweigh any dust on the
bit on the machine so let's so that's
sort of Cooper oh there's one thing I'm
gonna do with this it's I'm gonna fork
no I don't read the instructions cuz I
do not want to mess this up whatsoever
it almost messed up so bad this is where
the juice comes out of and this is the
bin that catches it I thought that the
juice goes in there and this is the bin
that catches it so I was about to that
squash and shit and it was going to
score everywhere that would've been
amazing fail but I thought I think I'm
just I think it was going to give it a
go I don't know if I need to chuckle the
items like there's actually no
instructions I'm just going to look at
this it just
we'll just like you know chunking on in
so you know I'm just gonna give it a go
balls to it I'm I'm just gonna go for it
so are you ready for this I know this is
it oh my god what am I even doing
oh nothing came out but alright I
genuinely have no idea what I'm doing
but we're just gonna go for it I watched
one youtube video that was like fifty
seconds long that just says like you
just put everything in and hope it just
works oh um
wish me luck this will hopefully go
successfully
I never want to do that again guess we
just got to keep it going with the
momentum but it's so aggressive
okie-dokie Jones all right so will this
fit now yep Fitz Fitz
Oh

Oh
Oh
let's get going
I'm supposed to go with it
I've done
whoa
the juice is actually almost full that's
a lot of dumb juice in it but I got two
more pieces of Apple to go and we're
almost finished this is gonna be an
absolute bitch to clean them to half of
her hey Steph sup give it a bit more
yes moving
okay okay okay okay before before boys
were absolutely full we share this piece
in this this apparently is going to
taste the worst like when you saw me try
them naked drinks the worst one I tried
was a big one so go no it's disgusting
yeah
I'm crazy
I should turn it off what up by the next
piece that's better
no shit wait no why not touching my
hands they're gonna stain get in get it
alright keep going
Oh

okay this looks like a complete goddamn
mess alright last but not least a little
bit of ginger let's throw in pusher
Oh
that smells yes that smells like ginger
no man actually stinks happy super down
strong so I'm gonna open it up now and
take a look at what it looks like inside
like I'm getting birth to like an alien
of some sort right I'll just take this
to take this off
oh my gosh that looks disgusting there's
so much mess just to make a piece of
juice a piece of juice a drink of juice
other beats and ginger acquired stain my
kitchen side carrots and apples acquired
I plan to commit to the mix okay let's
do this over the sink and not be stupid
mother why did you like how my camera
angle was but I just attached that to
that and then put my put my camera on it
look at it it's so cool I just stick it
where I want it got that looks
disgusting alright so there's the bee
and here's the Kara oh oh the poor point
in the Pope went in oh I got up oh my
goodness looks disgusting that looks
absolutely disgusting hey time for many
regrets I have wall are ready to throw
up with I have chocolate milk to splash
down the mastication
oh I've got the pineapple that I'm
allowed to splashing it a little bit but
I'm gonna try and attempt to taste this
drink the first time just as what it
naturally is and the reason I'm doing
this if you guys didn't know is I didn't
make a wish and I met a guy called Alec
Alex 15 years old he's fighting with
cancer and is an absolute champion now
he's supposed to drink these like every
day and like lots of this like lots of
stuff but apparently it tastes like just
absolute vomit so he calls it this vomit
drink but I promised him that if he
keeps up drinking them I'm gonna drink
one today so that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drink the whole thing now it
may take me a couple of hours to drink
the whole thing because look how big it
is this is like a pint glass and it
consists of everything you saw me put in
it so I'm going to put Alex litter
Twitter down below guys for you guys go
and shown some lovin you know wish Myles
port on his journey cuz you know it's
been through like grueling process of
chemotherapy
operations all that sort stuff so if you
guys could show some love when he's in
this time of just like nastiness then we
can all be around him as a as a
community to support him and Alec and
your family absolute love you as a
pleasure to hang out with you but I'm
about to hate you for making me drink
this drink and for a first initial sniff
test fuck I don't even my pineapple
juice oh my god I like what are you
doing to me
let's let's give this a go so ladies and
gentlemen prepare for regret I'm gonna
take a big gulp not like a pussy drink
I'm gonna make this like a proper proper
drink so three two one
it's actually not about that mine oh
yeah okay this is gonna stay my lips
like crazy but my initial reaction to it
is the foam on top tastes absolutely
disgusting however the drink itself it's
not that like Alec what do you complain
about the six you know I'm gonna even
try it with some pineapple now I wait
just for Michael to prove that I'm not
lying
I see me drinking part in all that
starts to think like drinking shots like
there's no tomorrow
but this thing if that big that there's
no shot in this so I'm gonna kick back
orange is the new black I just knew but
is that the right shot yeah I'm just new
black season four I'm gonna watch that
and I'm gonna drink this entire thing I
could easily just go away and pour it
down the sink you guys wouldn't know but
I promised Alec that I would drink it so
I'm going to drink it alright if you
guys want to try this you saw the
ingredients I did post a video of your
reaction if you're drinking it we're
gonna call it the Alec challenge alright
screw cancer screw this drink
it's actually better without the
pineapples likes pineapple sauce and the
reason I say that is because now there's
like there was no bits in it whatsoever
and now there's pineapple bits that
floating around it so it just like
throws me off I don't like that texture
but say I'm going to kick back drink
this and again if you guys want to try
it that alec challenge I'll put the
description down below of all the
ingredients if you guys didn't pick on
pick up on it already sell we're Bon
Appetit I've been drinking this for
about an hour I'm still not giving up on
it it has got to a point where it
started to level off the thickness of it
and the density sort of thing but it's
definitely a struggle I like I'll give
you that man it is a lot to drink if I
did just neck it and drink it all it'd
be much easier like ripping off a
band-aid but it's a lot to drink bro or
a matter of respect what you do you guys
are gonna be able to see anything right
now but I just look up to the top of my
apartment to look out the sky to see if
you can see the wildfires because there
is massive massive massive wildfires
going on
right now and I can't tell her that why
in the distance is the fires in distance
because he like loads of helicopters and
stuff that could be dropping off the
water or whether or not it's just
pollution from the lights our thing but
during the day the smoke you can see
looks like a goddamn Ville kena went off
he said o'clock in the morning guys I am
still watching orange is the new black
I finished the drink my teeth I thought
they'd actually be very very discord
because of the beats but it not that but
I drank all the drink it did actually in
all honesty take me about two hours to
drink it just because one it was just
such a heavy heavy drink like the beep
portion of it which is so damn filling
but honestly I tip my hat to you Alec
you're absolutely incredible with it
like being able to handle that drink
something but it makes you better my
friend so make sure you get down you
every single day into Alex dad thank you
very much for the recipe for that and
yeah what a good day I'm gonna manage to
get that all together like I slept
throughout the entire day but then I
made it a promise to Alec that I would
drink that drink it did just that oh I'm
gonna fall asleep on the sofa from this
point on guys thank you very much for
watching if you enjoyed it make sure
leave a like great if you guys are going
