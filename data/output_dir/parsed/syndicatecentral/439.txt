alright ladies and gentlemen each let
you know before we start today's vlog
that on Black Friday we started the sale
at syndicate original and it's lasting
all the way to Monday so if you want to
get some crazy percentage deals off some
syndicate original swag make sure you
check the link in description to go to
syndicate ridge not calm see what you
can get and give me a tweet if you do
end up buying it and so get in time for
Christmas by ordering now pay close
attention pay close attention I'm here
swimming I looked up and what you
staring at me yeah salvation starting
today slightly tired it's done woke up
to the sound of scraping was like what
the hell is that damn noise and realize
my garden is here and he's scraping up
all the leaves obviously not in here but
he's doing it at the front of house so
it looks nice and clean oh shit I
accidentally my drone and oh fuck go
it's falling Oh bollocks a drone went
out of range I went outside into the
field next to her god Gary been a minute
since I've been in the girls on mop
bucket this morning I'm going through
him I'm really hoping that this iPhone
is waterproof we dipped in the wall
before like this and it still worked
I think it's splash proof not flowing
water proof but well you were right it's
taking me so long to get there
so this pushing what are you so you can
swim against it like in flow I can just
say brave yep and you'll never touch two
more it's great but also fucking a tight
shot in a sauna roasting my nipples off
for about another 10 minutes as you can
see I'm dying in here a time to cool
down
cool feel like seniors oh we're in the
water we need to do a fair test as to
whether or not this is actually fully
waterproof so this is like a five and a
half foot pool deep let's see what
happens good bye okay are you okay you
are finally leaving the house at 3
o'clock in the afternoon spin a
successful morning so far more Corp fed
Steve swam that's by it finally made it
to my destination Decathlon hopefully
where I can get bunch of nice waterproof
coats comfy ass gloves and thermals I've
not been to this place in like 10 years
and it's still as heaven as possible
just cool is that electric skewer no
it's not my god damn ledge obscura she's
got big ass break and I got way too
excited I've got a really bad feeling
that soon my phone has broke the
speakers and the microphone of my phone
so today's vlog sounds like I'm a
high-pitched child I'm sorry there's
nothing I can do about it I look great
right now and fixed there we go okay
yeah so I ducked out I completely forgot
my wallet
I drove like 25 minutes to get here as
well and then I have a while and now
it's give you traffic so by the time I
try and attempt to come back it's just
gonna be way too busy so I think I'm
gonna have to leave Decathlon for today
I did want to buy some gloves and some
thermal light top cuz I'm going down to
Manchester with the homies tonight but I
just guess guess I'm not good to do it
ok I just totally realize I fucked up I
just come through the McDonald's
drive-thru order to shitload of food and
then was like oh I don't have any money
oh yeah they're fucking useful fucka
sighs shit poor boy Steven B wrestles in
the variants I opened up the door and I
looked back down he's gone and I believe
I have a guest walk around my office oh
right we did all right you should be
really cozy because I've got wonderful
heat and all that sort stuff but I've
just got finished I think with modern
warfare remastered funny moments - I've
got bond I will be funny to go out with
the homies because we're going to
Manchester tonight and it's gonna be
really cool but were supposed to be
dressing smart so we can go out to bar
so don't know how I'm gonna work this
one but it's all thought up the app and
see what Steve was doing and I real
he was actually sat there looking at the
edge of his avaria and then I was like
is he gonna climb back in so we did any
climb back in I was like hey he's back
and the next minute he fucks up again
and I walk down it is chilling
underneath my bench what are you doing
have no idea what he's doing I don't
know he's gonna munch of the cables
which you shouldn't really do cuz I
don't think a lot like food to him but
he's just kicking the chill I think I
mean no way shape or form fucking around
with how cold it is outside today we're
going to the Christmas markets where
we're gonna be outside for ages so I've
blocked my thick ass with it's not time
I got normal socks and then these on top
of it so I'm hoping these keep my feet
nice and warm as much as I want to wear
the jacket my grandma bought me it's way
too thin for going out around Manchester
now I might wear this which if you've
been watching this YouTube channel for a
long time I bought this the first time I
ever went to America as you can tell I
haven't grown so it still fits me but
this fits fine so I could wear this
around Manchester tonight I'm not
impressed with the jeans but we'll
ignore that but yeah it is a bit of a
throwback but I could technically wear
this all night it would definitely keep
me warm but it's a bit too old and it
has odd memories with it so I don't know
if I wanna wear it I'm going out the
boys Steven alright I'll catch you later
hopefully everything stays safe you stay
safe and you've got a nice man food in
there I can see there's still a few of
these jumping around you usually yeah
you've usually eaten them by now on the
fact that there's three last I'll jump
in mate it doesn't make me very happy
you either don't like that they're so
small and active or you're just being
fussy today so I'm not too sure but you
are basking so you must have you in some
