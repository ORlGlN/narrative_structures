touch me well every time I see either me

literally a plate of raw meat and a bowl
with one mushroom in it what do we do

owed your veggies yep we put it all in

the bloody can come on you want to say
with this stuff it's a one carat and one
more Sharia okay then why don't I just
draw a piece of meat in that okay can

drink out of mason jars we do when if I
ever had a mason jar is that fucking
lawyer it's his pet gorilla what yeah

girl sitting there just dead sad with a
hipster hat on so that's disappointing
there's nothing fucking in there
I like how I just asked Adam if there's
a lot of bums around here and I look
around and there's just a pot of weed on
the floor

I told not I need I'm like a lost child
right now but as soon as that I'm not
drinking fizzy drinks anymore I'm gonna
go to the shop and get some replacement
beverages that's plan but no idea how
happy it makes me see no car park there
like I'm fine with it there but it makes
me so happy knowing that this place is
always empty success made it to the
store and this door doesn't work and
have to go and use the other door
awkward bones is open 24 hours whereas
subway I think that closes in like half
an hour I'm gonna get subways I'm gonna
get everything and put it on it's gonna
be beautiful
can I get that toasted please yeah
that'd be great yeah totally thank you
that is so American right there the Papa
John's on the top of it reminds me of
the the Toy Story pizza delivery truck
where is it piece of Planet truck it's
food shopping time and I need some stuff
too
sandwiches with some kinking ham ham and
more ham this is definitely just because
I got a subway and rather than going
buying more Subway's I just made my own
oh my god the food of gods this is
actually probably my most favorite food
in the world for shell cured ham okay
see these are what I'm looking at
getting it's a replace my drinks with
and these naked drinks I'm just gonna
get a few of each one of these and hate
all of them
I can tell you for a fact right now I'm
gonna hate all of them except the orange
juice one bought we're gonna try one
each day in the vlog in Jesse Owens I'm
kind of just getting some of the
essentials whilst listening to Wild West
music I guess in the store just get like
some my first aid sheet just in case you
know I ever cut myself on something and
I'm like why do I want to get these my
inner child wants to get Mike Wazowski
if I don't get out of there soon I'm
gonna go nuts
what the hell America mushroom swiss
burger chicken pot pie what else we've
got any anything else weird here
be a barbecue season pork well I'm not
to try all these as well went out for
drinks and ended up spending like over
$200 on food
so this is where Tom smart brain kicks
in love then Park it up I'm moving all
my stuff along what I'm gonna do is call
the hook when that's coming down I'm
gonna run all the way into it then pack
the car
fingers crossed no one Nick's on my
shears it's going to put down the
elevator if someone calls it and it'll
save me put your trips success it's
perfect
well no one nicked anything so I was
great so I may have had a bit of an
accident in the car when a little bit
too aggressively fast and my plan fell
over and spilt Syal in the back so
whoops
I'm nailing these parking jobs you guys
have heard me talk about it before
bought scratch my eye bro one sec okay I
got funds leaving loading a subway but
you've every talked about before I need
to get like a trolley of saws so I can
like don'ts my car put it all on the
trolley and then bring you all to my
room over once cause nothing to do this
trip like this so it's not efficient man
I just feel happier knowing that I've
got stuff in the fridge like I always
eat out or order food in so like I've
got all these fucking unhealthy drinks
but it's nice to see cool everything's
usually blank so Nats Cola got some
yogurts and stuff like that
another decided cuz I always eat Chinese
food I'm gonna try some of these they're
probably gonna be terrible but I'm
always willing to give something to try
one yeah this is shit snacks boy
whatever we've got a look at all these
soups and breads and stuff I've got I'm
happy by the way shout out again to the
two fans who gave me these mugs your
bloody legends I've got a nice scented
candle smelling the room out in Rome me
aging it what and I got a flat I forgot
a flower I got a plan I decided that the
building needed something too okay
there's a piece of trash I just think it
needed something to give it a bit of
life but a greenness in it you know
there's not enough razor green stuff in
here anyway so I was like I think it has
a little patent will be beautiful I
might even put it here or I might put it
on top of that you know just feels a bit
homey I have officially decided that the
arrow is one of the best shows and also
the worst shows because all the villains
never fucking die
burning I'm gonna bed chilling out and
just enjoying it for a bit bit of time
to myself
