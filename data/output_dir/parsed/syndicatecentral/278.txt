oh my god oh my god the violin great
well they're my feet
that feels great but I reclaim a limit
not what I how much of Colchis is 180
AED which translates into GBP was 37
pounds second that can't be right this
cannot be right in the slightest because
you said law a piece of 18 he said 180
yeah there's my bill 13 it was for a
bottle of water but he put through a tip
of 100 we put through a tip of 100 we
have entirely absolutely I'm pretty sure
I just busted someone to take an
advantage of guests because that now
cost me 18 not 180 and I think his
managers just kind of busted him for
charging people $100 180 extra every
single time actually how many people
would have just thought oh I guess it's
got much or you better know Jacques the
ferry zipline and refeeding oh I'm doing
half and eight the unit oh my god that
AC is so cool
magis no way they sell mermaid outfit

little bit of a wander and see if I can
make it happen

offered in plain crisp in his mouth well
Savage
I made a new friend that's proven is
from Sri Lanka and you can work out if
like two years top bloke asked him a
million and one questions about how did
this get made why is that power bigger
than that power we didn't have a reason
for that and just a bunch of all this
stuff it's just crazy how this is all
man-made and just crazy but oxo will see
him throughout the fuse next few days I
told him I do volume for job and he's
like well it sounds awesome
I was like alright well looks to me
literally a matter of seconds before
that miracles and humid I mid afire
early the way it is now
six the Sun is pretty much almost down
as you can see the stickers emptied
Platt from the few stragglers but only
that that's a little taxi Cerritos in I
was walking along there and as I got to
that I saw one at one of them and I just
went tattooing like it's a joke and he
pulled over like sick there's a free
shuttle to take us all the way down to
the actual thing this is pretty dumb
sick to be honest pretty damned sick for
that monorail Simpson look at it now you
can notice it's a palm tree
ready imagine imagine a plan for it
sticking out what see how it sticks up
and then branches out oh yeah
so this is how it goes it comes this way
and then branch branch
these are branches because branch branch
branch branch branch and then this is
this is on a circle going around the
entire thing protecting it protecting
the palm tree from the ocean incredible
absolutely incredible I like to rule
Dubai I like the rule I you not
I went to a restaurant that was like
really pumped and I was like I wonder if
I can get reservation here I don't like
what really smart from a nice tree and
put on everything out like that smart -
gene - boots all that sort of stuff and
then I went there was like absolutely so
we can take a reservation for you but
for you gotta wear shirt so it is one
hell of fancy restaurant oh yeah
romantic women oh you're BAE what is
that so the reason this restaurant is so
fancy is because the underwater place
over there you can eat eating the fish
free damn good I don't like a set five
course meal so I'm expecting good no
great things
our that's our unit this isn't even some
kiosk oh look at that I can always see
some food now this is a dining
experience so that wasn't a Shack but
notice a really fat fish I'm going to go
for leave the dock or scallops and then
the way it works with either lobster or
the clamorous black cod like a weird
fatigue system is how you do it but oh
my gosh I know there's a diver holding a
dementing happy birthday
Kevin I just got given a palate cleanser
for the start of the meal and apparently
if it's like a bubble with water I'm
going to show you what the pulsation
count like a bubble of water and wrapped
in raspberry are something because it's
like a drop worth of like actual water
he's very wrapped around it can feel an
internal pop in the mouth there's not a
bit of a
a flower on it or war I am going with an
ice there which is apparently sweet and
sour and yeah comes in a big ball all
the staff keep living from Target or for
like an idiot
there you go whoa that's a palate
cleanser but all made I can show it out
because my oysters melted and and I was
taking that ones out the appetizer that
is melted so that was weird
girl I was so weird alright so the
flavor in it was mad it was proper sweet
and sour but I did it like have a bit of
it touch my tongue because was a
swallowing straight down
okay aphrodisiac ice on my exhaling with
tip first and would like it wasn't but
things are asking for so I was
interested oh my gosh have to come up
with Anna made an amazing idea for
coming back to this restaurant and dudes
know pretty cool I just spoke to the
assistant manager about it and she
sounds pretty on board let's just pause
the fish in the shack and the manta rays
