today is the day do you know what's
happening
nope days the day we get the brand new
PC so without further ado this is a
sponsored video but you know what I'm
very proud for it to be responsive video
I'm Wonder I'm a class flight last night
I wonder I wouldn't know where it swiped
oh my god new heavy shotgun available
now a new shotgun with increased range
cat what do you think of that 146 at
7:00 in the afternoon
time to record a video first game of the
day I want to get W new heavy shotguns
available I won't try again win with it
let's go this complete mess of wires is
about to get even Messier and this old
PC is coming out and the new one is good
and it has been in the works for a
long-ass time and it was I know it
sounds odd to say but it was an easy
decision which PC company I like to work
with more importantly it's one o'clock
in the morning afternoon and that means
breakfast most important meal of the day
guys never forget your breakfast like
since I was a kid growing up and all
that my dad was always like the computer
guy in the family my mom was never
really bothered into it she always got
other people to take care of it whereas
my dad he always replace the past these
PC always went looking for new things
for his PC looking for new tech new
gadgets and all that sort of stuff and
one day my dad took me down to place
called area an area being the place
where I went as a kid getting on a PC
pass for back then is now the PC company
that's still absolutely smashing it is
based in Manchester I've met the owner
at the insomnia events or have been
there and he came over and just saw that
the madness which was like like the eye
61q summit we were just not and we got
Tolkien was like we should totally do
something together you're from
Manchester I'm from Manchester I want to
like help local businesses you know
you've been going for absolutely ages
your guy's reputation is amazing like
let's make this happen
so I gave him a phone call a few months
ago we got in the talks and you know
what we've got a beast of a PC on the
way boys how something we've taken into
massive consideration is not everyone's
got like thousands of pounds to just
throwing it like a high-end beast of a
PC so what we've done it is I've made
the high-end beast of a PC which I'm
gonna be picking up today to show you
guys what this thing is truly capable of
when you max out like you know that when
you basically go to build a car on a
website yo
best best best best best best just to
see like what its gonna be well that's
basically
I'm done with this PC we've done for the
highest tier build which I'm gonna be
picking up but then more importantly
we've built up a PC that's gonna be the
affordable PC that you can upgrade over
time to build up to the high end over
time rather than all at once so like I
was saying we built the two PC's now
this is the first PC that we've built
with the best price for the best bet if
you actually went out separately and
tried to buy all these parts and built
the PC yourself you would not be able to
get it for this price that's why
gladiator computers are absolutely
amazing and that's why we've partnered
with them so what you're seeing right
now is just rolling through with the
path picker going through and showing
you all the parts that are gonna be in
this PC that's available for you guys
straight away now from the get-go you
guys can immediately decide to upgrade
to the high-end PC that I've got but
this is more of your like I know it
sounds crazy but this is your entry
level like this is the right system for
you to jump into going streaming for
making YouTube videos for gaming for
doing everything that you need with the
room to improve so for everybody who's
been asking me on Twitch like Tom what
you think of this PC part what you think
of that the reason why I've not been
giving you an answer is because I've
been like right wait I'm in the works of
doing something now's the time if you
want to get a gaming PC to get your
hands on this let's go pick up a beast
you can't go in that you gotta go in
this down area which is in Manchester
and we're gonna go to gladiate where the
team ed and working on this PC for quite
some time I have not seen before like in
a sense of I don't know what the case
looks like so I said I want it to look
absolutely beast mode I know what specs
acorrea and it's gonna just run like a
charm we're gonna head down there
hopefully not hit too much traffic get
the PC get back set it up and start one
hell of a beautiful stream tonight
however I don't have my faster than that
yet ready steady let's rock'n'roll
next stop gladiator here we are ladies
gentlemen area PC where I came as a kid
this I honestly used to come in here
with my dad and whilst my dad was buying
the past I used to just sit on the
computers and dream of getting a build
high-end PC and to think that all these
years later I'm finally walking in and
going picking one up as a sponsor he's
just fucking mad and pick up all the
gear over here and used to stand on
these computers and just scroll through
the website like just custom building
the pcs and it was always my dream to be
able to buy one
obviously as a little kid I could just
never afford it but like the most thing
I could get was like maybe a megabyte of
RAM and that was it but to think that
I'm coming in here today picking up a PC
I don't even know what the case looks
like it's a surprise so I'm very excited
look at this
wait messing around this is basically
the land of dreams for gamers oh my
goodness me look at this can I just what
like I'll leave my PC behind and I'll
just walk out with all these graphics
cards bloody hell Morton a is Morton a
is oh my lord
she don't know what case I've got I said
like keep it as a surprise don't think
so I don't know ever it's beautiful
whether it's plain this one's beautiful
I like the sleekness and I definitely
like white and blue I should go on this
side it's like and it's a muster
surprise my PC is behind this curtain
which I can just look around the edge so
I'm going to ready but it's nice oh my
goodness
yo that is so goddamn sweet I'm in love
oh my lord I said I like black and I
said I like sweet I love that I really
didn't know how beasts it was gonna look
and that is just absolutely good
everything has chrome a nowadays look at
this it's just absolute tank
you better know got custom control here
look at this bit of blue vinegar it
raised a green well like that I like
that a lot I'm honestly so excited to
get this home I'm so glad it does look
nice and sleek because some PC cases
just like monsters it's a bit too much
but this is like the perfect size and if
I want to bring it back and like change
anything out for any reason in the
future that's exactly what I can do
right now it's time to show you guys
what parts we added to the PC to be able
to take it to the next level now this is
the PC fully specs out that I'm gonna be
taking home with me today so we
immediately upgrading from an i5 to an
i7 we then went from the Asus tough said
370 all the way up to the asus rog

the way up to 32 and you better know we
threw in that led we then went from the
Asus GTX 10 7 is to to ASA 610 80s in
SLI oh man oh d we didn't need to change
the storage so we left that alone but
the only thing we change from there was
the power supply and the cooling and you
know we needed to upgrade from that air
cooling to that liquid cooling Corsair
LED as well no
everything needs color this is perfectly
built as an affordable beast of a PC
