2:49 in the afternoon that is what I'm
talking about good night's sleep the
plant is still dying and I I'm gonna
read a book today my daily commute up
the stairs to get to the top floor so I
can sit in the Sun which is actually out
today so it's like super over class in
County but something's definitely out
here it's definitely over class but the
Sun is still shining in this direction
so I soak up as much soon as I can I
should be able to stay up here forever
because it'd be nice and cool and breezy
I'm not too hot eat my breakfast at 3
o'clock in the afternoon now and read Bo
Berman's book egghead are you can
survive on ideas alone um no actually I
said this before I really want to go up
the coasts of like California and just
look for hidden beaches and then like no
I go off-roading and like I want a jeep
wrangler out here so I can go
off-roading and go do cool shit and like
you know drive it on the beach and the
sand and stuff like that so I'd really
really like to do that cuz on my
weekends where I'm doing nothing like
everyone's either busy or you know
they're just recovering from hangovers I
want to be outgoing adventuring and just
checking out the world rather than going
like what activity can I do like you
know something you paid to do I want to
go and explore like mother nature like
when I go up snowboarding I could go
snowboarding but again the problem is I
don't have a car so I've got to work on
that and once I work on that then we can
go and do cool shit the Sun is just
about gone down I was a bit like two and
a half I was really good together soon I
don't know why I've got silly sickness I
just ever since I was a kid I'm British
okay and when I am British
I want a teaspoon to make cup of tea
with now this if not a teaspoon this is
goddamn spoon spoon and it's not
acceptable she is way too big to put
some fucking sugar on it to put in my
teeth and we fucking changing this like
time why are you so upset about this
subject and the thing is in my daily
vlog you see me go and do all this shit
like going out shopping going do this
going whatever get drunk you know
gambling all sorts of random shit you
guys saw me go out and buy like twenty
four spoons this is it this is a
genuinely serious topic right now
you saw me buy twenty four spoons I got
back here and the twenty four spoons
were gone
from when I managed to make it from
where I was to my apartment yes fucking
off of it I have been adamant that these
spoons are just gonna miraculously by
just go poof and fucking
appear but no there's no goddamn spoons
you know whom there's no god damn spoons
it's likely no DiCaprio winning an Oscar
he doesn't have one yet he might win one
today cuz it's the Oscars today and I
really want to watch it but I don't know
how you seem like it stopped abruptly
because it did cuz valise rang me we're
going out for some food and all so I'm
just gonna wrap this up real quick a lot
of people always asked like Tommy we
always see you out and like valances in
the background or something
why don't you vlog with him like I do
you know say CaptainSparklez I'm minute
loud on Nate shots and like that and
it's just it's just out respect some
people do want to be in the vlog some
people don't have be in the vlogs and
I'm never gonna force in my hair you're
in the vlog smile smile off the camera
perform one keep a farm not gonna do
that so when I'm around friends you
don't really be on camera I respect that
and I hope you guys understand that so
yeah we're gonna got some food and then
it's gonna quickly jump cut to me just
being probably back here being like
goddammit
Leonardo DiCaprio needs to win an Oscar
I actually feel bad for him like bad for
him I think he's gonna do this show
let's let's leave a bet right now leave
a comment let me know if you think he is
gonna win an Oscar because I think this
is his year the revenant was a dope-ass
film she said it really shit ending all
films I've seen teens latex and vintage
clothing the darkroom also known as the
dank we crush Nikki Nikki I personally
have no idea if that's where you smoke
weed or anything like that but wait a
minute isn't that a Philly to Franco
poster in that window right there
what it either is an either way me and
Evan have arrived to go get some food
just waiting for him his pocket open
Valley in and then we're getting some
grub I'm so fucking hungry me and Evan
fucked around with parking for that long
that we actually ended up bailing on
going out for food and because he needs
to go do some stuff I need to go do some
stuff we just said fuck it we're not
getting food and we just pied ways and
I'm coming get in the new plants vs.
zombies hoping that they have it in
stock I can't see it right now oh wait I
don't know that's the old one
shit how could you do this to me plants
vs. zombies garden warfare 1 I need the
new one where the hell are my god this
is disappointing ye
yes found it found this and I've got
some more credits so I can buy some more
liquid divinium razor super annoyed me
and haven't didn't managed to get food
today was just an absolute fuckup of
timings really so that kind of sucks but
nonetheless I've managed to rush Punk'd
it's the Oscars I am loading up my
computer as quickly as possible because
I want to see history get made I want to
see Leonardo DiCaprio win a damn Oscar
however I have an absolutely destructive
headache right now like a completely
annoying migraine so I'm gonna get
tablets in me gonna order some food and
I'm gonna watch win LLL watch winner
watch leo
come up with win Oh take home the Oscar
so wishing look I make decisions and
these decisions are so good ladies and
gentlemen I just got delivered half a
rack of ribs
mac and cheese calm breath and whatever
the hell that is to my front door oh my
gosh I'm gonna sit back down watch the
Oscars and just numb myself to death
it's all so good this might be one of
the best takeaway foods I've ever had
I'm pretty sure it's not that bad for
you rinse
that's not exactly fast food is it mmm
look at that as a chunk of me oh my
goodness this is ridiculously stupidly
good I'm gonna be straight honest with
you guys I don't really pumps on so
apologies for that the second of all Leo
Leo DiCaprio won an Oscar
yes that's it I totally didn't get to
see it because the live stream that I
was watching on the official website
crashed and I didn't get see I just had
to see the Twitter response of everyone
going fucking crazy so that kinda sucks
but either way Leo would have fucking
Oscar I think he can sleep well tonight
and if I'm right in thinking he is going
to a club called one oak if you guys
remember me doing there he goes they're
like I think every week and turns the
fuck up he's about to spend so much like
literally millions at a club turning up
getting completely drunk off his fuck
meanwhile I stayed in Ian's ribs and I
played plants vs. zombies garden warfare
2 for about 6 hours straight tonight and
you know what no regrets whatsoever it
was actually really awesome oh my
to tell you guys bad news we're clear
the camera angle wasn't too low there
for you to not be able to see my naked
bollocks hanging out but I've got some
bad news now you guys know let me grab
something as a prop just to make sense
know that I've been massively getting
into snowboard it might absolutely love
it and I've got the board
I've got everything I've got all the
gear went up to Utah snowboarding I've
been driving up to mount high and
basically this trip when I'm back I was
hoping to go out and pass my driving
test by a Jeep Wrangler and then I could
just go up to the mountains like
whatever one like I could if I rented
are just renting a vehicle and go
snowboarding like every weekend sort of
thing and like throughout the week a lot
more often than I have been doing but
unfortunately I can't do it anymore my
poor baby if you know the bags of
clothes that I'm supposed to be giving
away that song you know I apologize for
that but my poor baby is not gonna get
used for a full three weeks it's not
exactly the end of the world because
potentially in three weeks they say
they're gonna reopen and snows gonna be
available to snowboard on now I'm hoping
that's the case because they don't like
hopefully by then in the three week gap
I'll be able to pass my driving test and
get a Jeep Wrangler and then go shred
some now but until then I know you guys
have been looking forward to seeing some
footage unfortunately I just won't be
able to get a few guys unless we decide
to be badasses and fly out to Utah and
hang out with shonduras again like stay
at his place or a hotel and then just go
up in the mountains and destroy it with
that being said I might not be able to
do that either because I'm actually
going to South by Southwest I'm going
for the first three days of the event in
the last four days of the event so if
you guys are going to South by Southwest
I'm gonna be going I think valises we
can go in seen on is it gonna be going
and a bunch more other people so if
you're looking forward to that get ready
cuz 3bd jetpack all of us are going
there and we're going in style three
o'clock in the morning I'm going to bed
tomorrow is gonna be Monday I don't have
anything scheduled that I know of and
plunge so I'm gonna try my best to go
down to three BD offices head down there
and then head to a shooting range and
just try and have some fun shit over
there so thank you very much for
watching I'm sorry this like we can't
have not really done much I do really
want to go out and do mobile I really
think it depends on me in a vehicle that
would have my Jeep I can get out and do
shit and go and explore and do random
stuff so we've got to make that happen
so time to
get practicing how to drive in
California even though I kind of already
have before so wish me look with that
said if you guys have got any
recommendations for like apps to use for
California driving test passes I like to
revise the theory side on it please
leave the name down in the comments and
I'll try and download it thank you
