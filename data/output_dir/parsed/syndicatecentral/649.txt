there probably could have been a better
way to start the day than looking like
an absolutely shot myself
chocolate chip take a look at how the
weather shit in New Zealand is today all
right it's looking kind of cloudy kind
of overcast and kind of wet breathe away
go fly my drone
you
early another flight of the drone
absolutely successfully perfect really
cool a foot 2,000 feet army is that way
took some dope photos of Jeff stood on
the beach so it's pretty cool now we're
just gonna charge it again but she lasts
for about honestly 25 minutes it takes
about 45 minutes to charge it so it is
worth it but I'm gonna try to get like
four batteries that way I can just
charge it charge it charge to charge it
all of them and then just keep please
the batches like an ammunition guard so
let's get going on the road genuinely
camping
how many people go up saying yesterday's
vlog when I'm job has me a bowl of milk
and I put the cereal and afterwards I
didn't want to do it like that it just
was more safer and convenient to do like
that I always always put the cereal in
first then the milk geez you guys no one
cared about the crashing of the drone or
anything epic that happened throughout
the day it was just everyone crazy like
me my milk and my cereal
you guys are crazy this guy what are you
doing your suspect elite put it in a no
hot chocolate too damn hot dogs look
disgusting I don't think I met anyone so
New York like Jeff it's like it's like
hey a guy aids edible is evil
another day in paradise the clouds are
out the Sun is somewhat out and the rain
is out over there so it's got like the
mixture of everything the RV's ready to
rock and roll we've cleaned up the
campsite looking number 23 it's my day
of my birth and yeah we're heading to
some geysers now so let's go he's even
was just sunny all the time it would
honestly be like the best place on earth
really just it just isn't you know yes
it's one of those below always remember
this lake as well as Angela pesters
drawn over there
and crush these John over there I
managed to keep my nicest into the
geothermal locations jeff is dying to go
there because it's not like what foot
bird hair my gosh I got my window open
as well it smells like fucking get oh oh
yeah keep going to bear them she got to
turn into it oh my gosh I think this is
the geysers the smokes coming out of it
like what the bloody hell mate I have
extremely whoa they're everywhere look
thermal thermal thermal me I'm not
paying to go inside I'm just gonna go
jump in this lake over EXCI what the
hell's going on
quick quick quick before a fucking
landmine goes off and blows my legs off
what the hell whoa that's so random why
does this exist why is this natural why
is this a thing look what like I don't
understand what the hell it's actually
doing like it's so random I don't know
if you guys can see this but there's a
rainbow right there I really can't tell
if you can see on up alive that is the
clearest rainbow I've ever seen in my
life
you guys are probably seeing nothing but
it's beautiful oh I'm so excited
they have geysers they have arts and
crafts but they have Kiwis and an
enclosure uh-oh let's do this I really
thought we were just coming in to look
some smoke and mud splat around a little
bit but no no no if I see a Kiwi I'm
gonna shit myself also yes I brought the
British bobbing biscuits in it milli bah
bah
quality health someone's thumbs off in a
hurry I ain't bothering waiting for them
motherfuckers I'll take forever either
way I'm gonna go have a look at this
thermal I see what the hell is going on
it's basically just a big puddle of
water I believe that's just going hoof I
couldn't even begin to guess what that
said but we made it
oh looks so nice sorry I'm I'm still
eating the biscuits I'm like literally
no I'm joking
I've eaten half the packet and we've not
even got to the police yet we went to
walk like five meters as well but can't
wait I'm so excited
Wow look at that everything in the shop
looks pretty normal until you get about
here and it's like what the heck is this
guy looking at he's on the hunt for the
booty wait wait was what is going on
then some confused now I'm no expert but
this looks like these guys are all
praising this rock what kind of rock is
this gonna be end up being a meteor or
something like that and meat you're
right is it a meteorite you think so
yeah so to me that just looks like a
rock oh man it's no meteorites just a
rock it's the whoa I just touched a life
stone
yeah I feel feel good about that it's a
life stone yeah actually really enjoy
being educated about like what all this
is so I can come back and let go yeah I
know what that is it's so let's don't
we've made into the park that just looks
really really weird but this is a this
is a layout of the entire thing we're
looking at this bad boy
I hope you explode like hmm that Kiwi
house walk the size of all the eyebrows
right we're going in it may seem like
you can't see anything that's because
you can they're currently sleeping or
they're always in the darkness or
something so as infrared lights with
screens over here showing you what they
are so as a screen is a screen I'm up

now so it's really supposed to go that
high um yeah we definitely definitely
haven't sit maybe that's it going off I
don't know that looks that looks is
impressive it's gonna get if I have to
be quite fair in the two days you spent
looking at the glowworms and now this
we've spent two days and travelled three
hours out of a what total our trip 3131
our trip so we need to make some miles
up immediately Angelo immediately we're
so far behind schedule it's ridiculous
but hey it's what's down there
all right now we're at the mud pools
look at them doesn't do it any justice
until you see it whoa that is so damn
random like why is it just in this spot
right next to them as well the
I was never citruses reasoning for this
one from figuring here at mud pools like
this used to be treat various of
alignments ailment okay the thermal mud
to treat cuts and burns
mmm interesting these are also put them
on stamps oh I can take what tools off
the list we've seen them time to go what
we're gonna see you next geothermal
lakes look at us tourists this guy's
just gone seeing like geysers mud and
he's in the mood for a goddamn cheese
board whilst driving knowing all your
penis and you're fine we're not doing a
six-hour drive okay so far not in a
six-hour drive we found the geothermal
lakes which is what we were gonna go to
buy we decided no this way you see
multicolored mud so let's try and find
it we're gonna try and ninja a drone
flying over this area so let's see if we
can see from the sky
you
it was successful but the battery lasted
like Oh 12 seconds so we only got like
Charlotte fudge so we're gonna get out
the big bad boy drone I'm gonna fly that
bitch over using an iPad so let's see
how that goes okay so Jeff was like I
was like yeah I can see all the year the
dead flies on the window I was like look
at them are like look how many there is
he's like no no turn around I turn
around
um hi were you abandoned are you just
gonna kill me
can you not do that that'd be great I'm
not gonna touch you either cuz you look
wild but it's nice to meet ya okay
you're trying to be friendly you want
food and already food you look like
you're gonna slice my throat in the
night but either way it's nice to meet
you my name's Tom your name can be
Charizard hi jerez own oh here we go
again the time wookie fragile oh but
this thing has nine lives I actually
thought that was it done and dusted
yesterday but because he's got like
spare blades from his old drone each
managed to uh put them on it instead so
I don't everything's working so I will
try and film a bit of naught and a bit
of this to see if he crashes it my
chances are he'll crush it I missed it
the security came over I was like you
can't fly it over the park but you can
fly it in the parking lot that's guys so
we respect the wishes and look you'll
see the floppy dick again
just bit this bit yeah fortunately not
working so wat warm could be use is a
good good hedge trimmer
