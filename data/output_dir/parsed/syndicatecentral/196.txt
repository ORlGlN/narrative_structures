wake up it's a beautiful morning wake up
I think I might have a cold sore coming
on oh please say no oh no cool it's an
old yard it's a new day it's a Monday so
it's a new week I don't know where this
song is going so I'm gonna dig pool and
jump and Charu you probably could see my
poem the entire time as well fuck love
again love dere got my shirt syndicate
og slap it out and feel so fresh good
morning oh it's all right day of
weathering was not too bad not too good
obviously Alex crushed my car yesterday
it's completely drivable absolutely fine
but I'm thinking it could be weather's
not too bad we going out on the Triumph
no one else I'm trying to get saw a
GoPro footage of the tribes now not
gonna do no motovlogging like 6 foot
wonder with a microphone and talking and
stuff like that but we'll do little
clips of me ride around because people
have been demanding it like crazy so I
try my best to a feedback and works and
that like that out today
I've got charge my batteries and stuff
like that and get it mounted to my bike
well then uh we should be pretty good
world's most comfiest boots ever I do
actually have some really nice riding
boots like these are nice these are my
own mouth these are motorbike both boots
by job these boys bucket that I really
like we can tell where you can go into
any start building an e-2 tour just be
social and that wears these check these
out yeah they are very classy classical
looking for with no Genie little pretty
suave
mmm this is me trying to be organized
the homing device keys morning's kids
channel or my vlog on time it's
currently one point for needs to be up
by 6 o'clock it's going to take two
hours obviously not good might and that
goes down my internet goes down my
internet gun burner Palin I were you
doing in there so let's assess in the
daytime what Alex did so she reversed
into my car and dink it now you see this
bottom piece remember like oh you can
replace that dead easily hopefully
fingers crossed yeah but underneath
she's always scratch this a little bit
which is that problem and a special
license plate which isn't too bad but
underneath this bit here's cracked
because it's ripped off from the edge so
that's what we're worried that all this
is attached this one piece that
hopefully this could pop off which looks
like it can because all one can piece
together so if unfortunately this bit
can't just be replaced the whole thing
will have to be replaced again you know
I'm not a pro I don't work at Audi I
don't know the facts about this but when
my dad looked it he thinks the whole
thing might have took my cell let's hope
that's not the case either way not too
bad it's still drivable like there's
nothing wrong about stopping me from
driving that it's just unfortunate
really
oh and now going to the local juice bar
caf√© for breakfast okay

own kitchen like five minutes and worry
about that first appointment
