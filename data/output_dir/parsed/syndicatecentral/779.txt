welcome your faces to the adventure of
me going from here to England but before
we do that you can see me in a weird
reflection over here hello and we are
going to be dyeing my hair again so I'm
gonna jump from me looking like this to
a darker shade and boom darker much
darker than the last second you saw me
but you know what
does the trick it's exactly what I need
yes I am listening to Christmas music
and I've got some soup in the oven kit
microwave I'm nom nom nom
oh my god it's exploded everywhere
hahaha three hours before my flight bowl
of soup Bruce Almighty kick him back
saying goodbye to the apartment and my
beautiful couch in style I can
definitely say this has been the most
successful trip back to LA got out way
got myself a new apartment swagged you
out with a sofa with a unit with all
this like the television got myself a
dining room table go into the office I
managed to get myself tricked out the
complete off itself and everything's
done I woke bright light I could not
have had more successful trip I don't
think I'm just stoked to have it all
like falling into place and just you
know have everything going great but
everything is clean everything is ready
for me to return and when I do we're
gonna be in style and you - you fucking
lovebirds over there you better keep
yourselves to yourselves okay
now that's what you call it Hoover -
troubling stuff Sadie's alright we made
effort time
fucking got my phones film with again
I'm a sling three hours this is the
earliest a little bit ever probably my
entire life watch which gets the airport
large get some red food and one for the
fat that has actually employment so I am
so damn tired well if anything I could
just steal that go ahead drive around I
have some fun huh I'm just like that
we're through security time to do a
little bit of shopping at neither of
these Kung Fu Panda I mean it's a call
that was the name time to express but
that wine is ridiculous
I'm going to the airport lounge pocket
wait a minute I'm detecting something
going on here don't tell me
oh you dare to oh my goodness me wizard
Shh it's just a prank bro it's just a
prank the one thing you should never say
never I have found where I need it what
you mean no alcohol beverage beyond this
point I'm getting drink okay I think
this is what I'm supposed to be going
British Airways oh okay then I don't
know if there's enough room to fit me in
here
seems pretty busy now this is what I
call a buffet oh my goodness Moo got
some noodles some beef all sorts of shit
yes
so for start as I decided on noodles and
then I decided on curry and mix the two
together because why not taste us review
the this this tastes like shit this is
so condom spicy I must look like an
absolute dick because out of all these
empty seats I chose the one seat that
has the disabled picture next to it as I
take a break between my 25,000 cost me
all that I'm about to have a little log
in to the engine or a much bit of air oh
holy shit
would you just look at that this is a
swag you today this is an apple I
honestly had to make myself stand up and
just walk around look at this fucking
fireplace of a god damn area but I
needed to get a fun walk around I've got
about hours on my flight if I sat down
for any longer
watching arrow I will fall on fall
asleep so need to get about and do some
shit God damns like a maze looking for
the bathroom in this place look at it
you can enjoy this beautiful view of a
random window I've had so little sleep
it's too bright in this terminal but I
have fallen out of LAX 40 times and
always flown out that way for the first
time ever I find out down that way so
this is like a whole new scary thing for
me hopefully I'm in like the new British
Airways plane and it swagalicious with
Abed whoa whoa what the fuck that is
awesome yes that guy's got all the swag
these things are just for lazy people
that's why I take it every time I get on
it simple math yeah they're quicker oh
you see that guy that's a cup to right
there for you well this is home for the
next 10 hours nice well this is my bed
oh you pulled this put this down
footrest press this one television
perfect whoo
add Tahiti new I well the hell's up
flight time have an hour's wreck I
always do this when I get a plane try
and see which films I haven't seen
because most the time I've seen every
single one of them and I end up crying
so fingers crossed
there's some new releases I have not
seen before come on what'd you get
okay not see not seen keeper god no okay
what the hell I would happen to have the
glitched machine that doesn't work looks
so good I'm gonna go with some smoked
stomach first are some chicken maybe
some chocolate so the three cause we are
supposed to have a plane because I fell
asleep December I was in the mystic okay
this was nice the Vipers ice them up
great but I did miss the meal so like
you saw me pick my order menu and
actually getting
fell asleep about eight hours
super-happy got two hours remaining
gotta watch your film eat some breakfast
a tiger sir
one delinquent
goodness me it's beautiful
I kept looking out the window I was like
why can't I see it's because that's
nighttime and that's data example easy
first course we got myself some cereal
round two all it was breakfast still
watching us you are
this breakfast is so so good
- I was confused
pshh I'm sober ish
cup of tea
well this fight wasn't as eventful as my
Russia won because I just stayed up the
entire time on that flight played with
every toy button service possible but I
really enjoyed the flight super comfy
definitely make a recommend if you fly
business class to British Airways get
window seat that way you don't have like
the IRL at home walking posture so much
more private this is weird
this goes down
like your south facing each other like
shift wanted a smelly want space than we
really awkward but an that when that
goes up perfect so I'm just enjoying the
view
he's here and wondering internets we
have touchdown
bridges
I'm already happy to be back in England
there's Christmas music playing in the
shops and time to do this shopping now
that is what you call heaven ladies and
gentlemen nothing but oakley sunglasses
ah oh my god it's so Christmas wait a
minute there he is
it's that son of a bitch show your face
kid move oh you owe me so much stuff I
said I was gonna hold him hostage and I
was like that's probably not a good
thing to say at an airport buying the
whole Senate hostage you be like give me
all the presents well that was awesome
wet in that store just went looking for
some shirts and some clothes and stuff
and people behind the desk was like I'm
not supposed to do this in the store but
um I recognized you from my nephew
watching videos and I was like that is
awesome so he had to confer with him
under yeah it's just cool to see people
recognizing me from doing my job so yeah
well that is convenient I usually come
here and have to wait about 40 minutes
for a shower first time I've ever been
able to just walk straight in I'm
singing in the rain just singing in the
rain what a glorious feeling ever
oh happy again sooner from desk is
getting fired because you clearly let me
most effective hair dryer ever
oh man do I feel fresh let me go get
some hair gel some deodorant be perfect
this makes me so sad because they
changed or how they made that it doesn't
work as great anymore so don't use that
and then this is the wrong one so we
have to try something new for one
well objects obtained and now I'm just
wandering around shopping I am loving
having this one hour layover it's just
so Christmassy it's fucking perfect
overall not fun of that hair geologists
ride doesn't work I'm very very elitist
two hair gels I use item number two for
Russia's of Daisy so it straight gate a
eight to Manchester everyone keeps
saying you happy to be home I might he
take it a pass it's thrown it down with
rain however have just been in LA from
which is technically a desert so it's
nice to have a bit of a change of
temperature and it's toasty on this
plate that's the fatalist you dare cry
well back in COBOL a moment hold booklet
there's no traffic but the weather is an
absolute shit better get used to it I
tell you summer man is it good to be
home
