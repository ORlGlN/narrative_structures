I ended up getting deep fried fish what
fuck it does look pretty good but it
does look just like chicken in this girl
cheeseball
unruhe Bergen perfect I just came over
to see what they had and this is exactly
what I need oh my goodness me a little
stunned from my iPhone perfect came into
the Apple store to get one thing left
with six items seven hundred dollars as
well she she wasn't expecting that
well whereabouts what like it's about
fuck do what let's try that one again
before God started speaking to us okay
oh my buttery so low alright so we're
gonna look like thieves now because we
walked in the store and our bag went off
so you ready for this you go first you
go first you go first
oh no I look like a thief
no no no no no rude hoping no security
guy why does it have to be nice today
I'm leaving over like three hours before
I have to fly back home and I just want
to sit in the Sun and and Tom
two actually cracked into a lobster and
I could turn into a tan individual I
tell you what I actually have done not
that bad like when I compare my arms to
yours yeah this is a really really bad
idea before I go off to the airport
we're deciding to try a teeth whitening
kit
let's tried it and apparently it was
okay so I'm gonna try it and hopefully
not burn my face off what do we do then
what you're gonna do yep the whitening
stops right there so you don't want that
on the front of your teeth okay and this
is another tray inside of this so put
this against a cheese like so you're
gonna bite down there and this is gonna
go on your teeth and then go like that
Scott's got it yeah right forward a
little bit okay now suck it onto your
teeth go make that okay you got it
that's what your gums rate I gotta holla
higher
is it touching your gums no mom

your teeth close your mouth completely

on for 15 minutes he's not gonna leave
it on for long he's never white his
teeth before so don't you do like ah
thanks honey no you don't need you like
it absolutely that disgustin Oh quite a
little bit time later that my teeth do
not look any whiter not lyin so I like
trains
okay next flight to Los Angeles leave in
Chicago behind good to have left say
goodbye left in the family saying about
hex and the family it's been an
emotional day I love going to the optic
house I've seen them dudes and finally
got the collaboration between me and my
exile so that was fucking awesome you
guys seem to love it you don't seem to
be down description again for you guys
to be able to go check it out but I now
have to go and get in probably one of
the longest security lines ever oh my
god this Airport sucks testicles is this
some sort of sick joke
what the actual fuck now this is what
you call America holy snap look at all
these flags
damn son it's beautiful what wow that's
amazing okay
I'm massively failed like ridiculous
amounts I usually travel and when I
travel I take my phone my wallet and my
passport and I did exactly that I got
through security I've got everything
I've got everything I've got everything
well good
I then realized I don't have my English
phone I left it in Alexis's glove
partner and I was like glove compartment
I was like oh I'll just put it in there
cuz the battery's dead I don't need to
carry two phones inside me all right
have it in my pocket all day so just
I'll just leave it there let don't
forget to remind me
she forgot I forgot and she just drove
off now why is my phone in your glove
compartment she said yes and lo and
behold of Allah I'm just went off on my
phone what the fuck but either way yeah
I left my phone back
in the glove compartment so that means
that on the phone I can't log into steam
at all to play counter-strike to fight
any video games to do anything so I'm
pretty much boned in that scenario I
can't use my UK phone to text like
friends and family who don't have an
iPhone starting because I messages that
I use on this phone and pretty much I
don't give so I really really
successfully failed they're gonna have
to ship it to me we're just gonna cost
one a lot of money to get it like done
quickly and - it's just an inconvenience
I'm officially a duck either way I've
made it to the gate and if that baby
doesn't stop crying I'm gonna throw it
out the plane window joking I'm joking
I'm gonna flush it down the toilet
we have arrived back in Los Angeles and
I'm just gonna go home that's pretty
much it it's midnight I'm tired I'm
gonna bed but can we just take a minute
to praise the Lord for escalators and
also ground floor escalators look how
far that is to actually walk like that
is a ridiculous amount of distance to
walk so thank God for this moving
pathway also if that guy stood up
straight probably is that tall he might
smash his head holy shit I wanna say
it's good to be home but I don't have my
keys to get into my apartment and the
only way I got in my building was using
my phone to ring the front door to open
it like food delivery stuff so I'm gonna
go through my suitcase on my backpack
and the hope that it's there and if not
I'm gonna have to ring my landlord like
1 o'clock in morning yes in my pocket
thank God oh I forgot I left it a mess
before I left yeah oh god you all my
washing from that trip and now my next
trip so well I'll just do it tomorrow oh
my goodness is it good to be in my own
bed I feel like I haven't even had a
chance to relax and enjoy this thing
about a shower actually I lied I had a
bath and now I am in spend it crazy to
think that I went to New Zealand for two
weeks had one day's rest then when
always Chicago for a week and I've only
spent one day in the past like three
months in this bed so I'm extremely
looking forward to sleeping tonight
nonetheless it was a pleasure hanging
out with optic guys it was awesome to do
a little collaboration with Lex and
overall it was an amazing trip really
really enjoyed it I cannot wait to go
back because they've got a goddamn pool
table now which is not negotiable cuz it
turned up on the last day I was there so
really really annoyed that I didn't have
time to play against them guys but if I
go back I think I'm gonna do some wager
matches against the guys and see how
things go so I grew up up today's vlog
