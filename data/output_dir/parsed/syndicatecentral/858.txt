taxi for like 20 miles to get to the
hotel where I've got to meet someone to
organize my paperwork to get to the
embassy then at the Embassy hopefully go
there and get it all taken care of if
not then this was a completely wasted
trip but fingers crossed it should all
go smoothly
I believe I've been up since yesterday
and awake today I need to pass out on
there's a monument okay yo just shouting
out to Xbox they've put me in a fancy
hotel holy super fancy
whooping so my hotel check-ins not until

something different that I'm going to do
instead of going straight out now like I
said going to the touristy stuff I'm
just gonna get in the room and go to bed
for like two hours wake up go downstairs
to the hotel spa get a full-body
massage relax this just real chill
the out and catch up on some sleep
because I've had none at all and then
gonna meet back up with the dudes that
we were just with and we'll go out with
some food we're gonna check out
Washington gonna do some touristy share
and it's gonna be perfect
so bed prepare yourself for the master

joke or is it
exception no no sounds so wrong alright
so we went to bed like a past 11:00 it
is now 3 o'clock good good couple of
hours hopefully wake up I threw myself
out of bed because I had to dream I got
text saying I was going meeting Obama
I'm a lion but at least I woke
up anyway to go and check out the rest
of Washington so let's go
update my spa
got pushed back even more so ruin it eat
gone venture come back Spa then go back
out for the night eating but look at
this steak oh my god not bad for dinner
a New York Strip haha I'm sat here in
this restaurant
I mean lobby of the hotel and these
these fine gentlemen next to me are
talking about security who had to go yep

started with one person and now there's
like way you're surrounded right now
like I've done a mini meet up outside
the White House Obama I'm sorry man I
apologize that was crazy like I just got
absolutely super long but like 100 kids

overwhelming celibate which were the
teachers who came over and dragged him

got to meet so many funds and then I got
to see like the cat the cat was the
thing called where they all go a cockade
no I don't know why was God but I got to
see load of that if Obama was in that
and you guys saw him I just throw up a
minute to say I saw him I think it was
like the Koreans or something like that
but either way it was awesome awesome to
watch that like one guy be wounded out
you could see the stock of he's like I
think it's like an m4 rifle or an mp5 or
whatever it was I was like yo that
is awesome
so yeah but like so we saw the epic
mohawk aid and then he's on a pedal bike
