on how long I'm there for another quick
there's a goddamn peacock with the help
in the middle of nowhere like in the
middle of a desert there's just a
peacock what oh my god is a lush green
grass
I guess those guys are fancy rich mother
truckers like the security guard walking
over there where the hell are we going
like I said he said what shoot are you
here for and then he said avatar
so and it said it would tip number two -
I don't know I have no information
anywhere that we're going in the slice I
guess we just head up to like crew
parking or find out different shoes no

looks lost as well
yo you wanna know something interesting
we just pulled up and they said um what
shoot you fall I'm asked if we were
filming avatar what wait
yank Yeah right leak no Bhima not Bhima
took his Mercedes is looking refresh i
honest to god we're drifting yes right
so yeah obviously this is a cement work
and like stuff like that alright so this
is clearly a shoot
holy whoa dude I had no idea that
she was on this kind of scale all these
like for real for real for real I had no
idea this was anything like this we are
in the right place
I still don't really have a clue what
I'm doing I found out this not just
really badass stuff happening there's
consequences so if we miss I'm like I'm
still not spoiling anything
oh my god yeah no you guys absolutely
curse this look at this men finished
food no offence a food truck stop with
that that is I couldn't even cook that
 myself that's amazing yes food is
absolutely incredible
this is the guy I'm going against I
genuinely thought you were part of the
crew because all those guys were stuck
there with tattoos looking badass as
anything I thought you were part of the
explosives crew and I'm gonna like like
commenting tattoos like can't wait to
blow some up he's taking part of it
are you ready for this
yeah I still cannot believe how many
people are on the shoe this is nuts
oh look at all this equipment look at
all this rigging look at all these
cameras oh my lord
yo I'm gonna take a picture of this
tweet this out and the hype is about to
be so real
like seriously real oh my lord like one
of my number-one things are coming back
to LA was trying to get a suntan dude
I'm in the middle of a desert near a
concrete factory with cars filled with
explosives on this kind of weather
just to be cool it's driving around
supreme water to keep the dust down
these guys are packing down early I
don't know I'm not too sure what this is
I'm gonna be teeing off looking forward
to that yeah this lady needs to make
this disappear so I don't have a big
massive cold sore my face the tiredness
disappeared I'd you know if she could do
that you know she's pretty much a wizard
well she doesn't got like a massive
table of food so I'm gonna go see what
snacks they got over there oh my gosh
this snack selection is insane this is I
had no idea this was here
oh my going down now I've been here
since like 11:00 know what I'm doing now
because I've seen her rehearse the
entire thing everyone gone he's not even
started I think yeah I'm not gonna take
us about an hour two people start here
the hosts they've gone and my
Calafat who doesn't speak any English
she's down there so literally that is
the the entire way my things planned out
is that Tucker's had like a load of
chemistry with the guy he was like -
like interacting with him playing
against or with or whatever yeah he
doesn't speak English I literally have
no idea what you saying let's give you
guys a bit of scale of how big this
shoot is right so all the cards that
getting blown up are across this hill
like in this valley look look how big
this is but you've got like I don't know
any cameras okay but you've got camera
up there camera over there camera over
there you then obviously got like the
drone up in the sky the camera rigs the
cameras just stationary over here like
apparently this cost no joke two hundred
thousand dollars a day to keep this
production running and I think they've
been here for like three days so far
absolutely bananas and check that out
that bun down there with a massive
satellites on feeding all the
information to him yeah damn they can
probably hear everything I'm saying
because I got this microphone on and by
probably I mean tomorrow
legend absolute legend I love that we we
just did our like rehearsal of it and we
were like wondering how it was going to
plan out of like literally not
understanding each other so like when
he's speaking Spanish I have no idea
what you're talking about
really I just can't understand him but
it worked I have no idea what he said
but all I know I learn one word granddad

rising the sun's going down the light
the lights disappeared so it's kind of
close up shop no home the freshest
license plate ever thank you very much
