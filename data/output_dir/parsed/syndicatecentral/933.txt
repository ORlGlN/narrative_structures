AH to go down to London today guys I'm
going doing some secret stuff which I'm
giving quite a bit out if your backfires
at me then that shit sucked but yeah I'm
heading out to London today it's gonna
be fun I'm hopefully gonna try meet up
with some other youtubers I like drops
texts to all the guys

busy doing some other stuff but
hopefully we'll see if who wants to get
together go some much Nando's go for
some finger-lickin chicken and no racist
comments now JJ should definitely be
there for going to Nando's but hey I
know someone's gonna say it but yeah I'm
I'm just getting ready I'm only going
out for like a day so it's like a random
thing I probably do a vlog along with
them guys if they fancy just saying
hallo it's Cameron's stuff cuz then you
know I said I was gonna do a little bit
more vlogging stuff I'm the second
channel again when I'm doing some
exciting which is going down to London
now I don't think I'm going to do like
crazy day in life and we're traveling
down to London which I said I might have
done because I usually go down to London
I take all my cameras and all it's just
like too much stuff to take with me so
today I'm kind of just like I'm gonna
break I'm taking like no cameras just a
bag or a laptop and you know change your
clothes for the next day cuz I'm just
gonna go down stay there
probably wake up extremely hung go over
something like that and then go out so
that's my plan and I just thought I'd do
a quick vlog and just show or like look
how smart it's the first time like I've
wore like a polo shirt sort of thing I'm
not going impress anyone today don't
worry I've got no mysterious dates that
going dude nothing like that it's just
it's just a really boring meeting which
affects the rest of my future over the
next three years so yeah put all that
out there a little bit crazy but yeah
I'm gonna be doing that and what else
should I do I would Pat me was that God
doing have a look meet up in London or
something like that be pretty cool like
I've done it you're given before like I
could give it a day's no it was good
idea could we join me but I think I
think I just want to go down to this
trip just go there you know chill out
and not get too stressed about things so
we'll just see how everything works out
itself my papa is wandering around the
house and I've got trains catch in about
an hour so I've really it's a train
station could I get all the way over to
stop what train station by halle every
time I go there now I always had to bump
into
you guys because they I think people get
trainings like college or something but
it is a Sunday so you know that that
might not be the case but anyway I'm
gonna head off there now make sure I go
and get some breakfast because I'm
cooking myself some Weetabix that's
gonna be my journey I literally don't
have anything else to do like I've got
planned anything I've done all the
touristy stuff down in London so that's
it what you do here what's that

five-year-old I don't know why it is

is I don't know a good thing when you
get older but right now I feel like I
