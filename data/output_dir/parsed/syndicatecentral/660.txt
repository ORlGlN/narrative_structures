before
ladies and gentlemen I'm doing a few
errands we're going for cheeky nandos
and you will see the presence of a woman
alright that is it you'll see it
nothing's happening don't worry don't
panic don't be like I'm like at Toms Bay
no this is my bay and will always be my
baby this is exactly what I need for
breakfast holy fucking shit how's your
food yeah
oh no that's a really good job of hiding
your face they're the exact same fucking
thing
and well this is when you know having a
bad day when the fucking screen cracked
m67 finally just got yesterday's vlog up
late again I'm trying my best to get up
on time but like it blows my mind that I
could be in the middle of us fucking
forest in Scotland and still get the
vlog upon time but when I'm at my house
I have perfectly fine into that even
though it's slow as shit I still don't
want to shit get it up
either way I'm sunbathing hmm I am doing
this right now because for a long time
for the last three years like three half
years one man has supported me like
absolutely crazy and his name is boots
and I'm talking to him now on skype as
to thank you for donating the money for
the prize you know campaign for when we
went to New York and raised all that
money for motor neuron disease but I
just wait to say it boots thank you so
much I'm not showing his face we're
FaceTime this is this is a private
sexual meeting we're having right now
okay so you guys can't be involved but
please I just want to say a massive
thank you for all the support over the
years of YouTube and like the charity
stuff
but you've been incredible there you are
you shits what are you doing to my
windows man what a nice day
looking forward to go into New York
because I just will definitely miss this
green this is something you don't see in
California something you don't see in
New York just green green grass I'd love
to go jumping around when I but it rains
too much it was always dead money so
yeah boss I'm not gonna miss em crows
okay super under but you guys getting a
storytime with Tom now the story time is
about Kilimanjaro over here now this is
my Audi TT and the distance from the
floor to the right actual skirt is
perfect amount for this car to get down
that's the reason life before I bought
that car we brought it here and drove it
down it could fit no we did the exact
same with the Audi r8 and that has like
a plastic underskirt and it just kind of
catches it would just go skip like you
just it just scratched it that is about
it bought it could get down and it could
get up just fine now the Jaguar as you
guys saw in yesterday's vlog uh nope no
no no could not do it poor that was on a
Jaguar with 18-inch wheels and we think
me I already had 20 inch so it made it
down just fine now the Jaguar the how
much they're getting is gonna have 20
inch wheels so it actually might make it
down there so we don't ask them to bring
one round drive it down and see fall fit
so fingers crossed it does but let me
just give you it like this is how steep
this is this is level this is level and
watch the wine watch you go down you
just disappears it's like it's like a
fucking roller coaster most people can
get the cars down there so unless you
get driving a sports car but you can't
fit it down there
so come up with that idea I was like
write this what I'm gonna do you driving
through the gates there I used to park
my car here I'm just reversing well but
then you know made sense to go down
there but what I was gonna do is you're
driving here drive to the end and you
might be like oh yeah it's parking the
guys down there but it's got the
motorbikes in it and on my pedal bikes
and stuff so I don't want to do that
so what I did instead with this is what
I'm thinking is we take the door off we
extend the garage from this wall have
that wall yeah and put a garage door
there so then you just drive in straight
into it but there's a problem the
problem here is that de carril be facing
that way and you have to reverse all the
way back there all over round the corner
and up makes no sense
even better decision to fix that idea
was to put a turning circle so you know
like a train right when they packed the
trailer say that this is a train well
actually it's a cab or a train it would
drive there you press the button on the
wall and it go boom like that and you
could you travel quite literally the
best idea we could possibly think of for
the house white one I'd get a bigger
carriage because it completely extend it
from the carriage would still stay there
but then would extend it from there to
like to there so it'd be a massive gouge
of the massive door in it which look
amazing
raise the value of the house property
which should be sick but then I get
turning circle garage so like that was
something we're gonna do but I've only
just built the house so I'm like do I
really want to start ripping it apart
and doing more shit to it and the answer
is most likely yes
so yesterday's vlog was like four
minutes long he goes impressed with that
because I'm not I don't know what you're
talking about I did not forget to vlog
the rest of the day okay I didn't it got
late I was tired and I got in bed and
watch Netflix all night okay I'm being
honest that is what happened so yeah you
didn't really make Mitch mush mush mush
Bailey didn't miss much in yesterday's
day that was it like some days I
genuinely go through moments so I'm just
like I did fuck all day and then I said
fuck fucking all the way that's just a
day my life things happen things don't
we're going to New York soon then we go
to Chicago then I got a phone call
saying that do I want to go to Tokyo in
three weeks and I'm like yeah it might
be going to New York New York Chicago
Chicago LA LA Tokyo Tokyo New Zealand
holy fuck
what an adventure my life is gonna be
the next couple of weeks and I'll
probably manage to upload the videos of
me traveling all that craziness and time
on time rather than managing to get my
vlogs up in time in the UK I still don't
know how manage but I just want to say
thank you for yesterday slugger and the
end of yesterday's vlog I was like oh

people did I just would say hello it's

video you got coming like well but not
