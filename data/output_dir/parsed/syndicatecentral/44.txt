there's a clear day here today and there
is the I'm sorry today is officially the
big day
it's the big big day because today's a
day we're going me
Lydia's grandparents like we're on the
phones from this morning it's like okay
we'll be there so this seemed really
stoked it seemed really excited to meet
us and I'm actually genuinely genuine
say they're the key to finding out the
true recipe to salt and pepper chicken
it's been passed along the ages of the
family and have about to get it direct
from the sauce listen but more
importantly well not more importantly
actually but importantly this what's
happened today as you guys know like
when I stay at hotels and stuff I never
never really sure like the name of the
hotel the hotel room number I'm very
careful in Sao Paulo but we're we're in
Hong Kong so I figured like there won't
be many people in Hong Kong who watch my
videos anyway but more importantly like
I'm only here for a few days so that by
the time people work out where I'm
staying if people turn up at the hotel
but I just won't be there so it doesn't
just kind of how we do have privacy
reasons however we did bump into that
lad yesterday and he lives about like
half an hour away from here or something
like that near back near the airport and
he saw the vlog and saw the hotel and he
came to the hotel was waiting near the
hotel to see yours and then it was like
I'm giving up hope left and then we
bumped into him but it also seems that
even this is from him this is from
somebody else I'm not too sure where
this is come from poor I'm in a minute I
can already tell from instantly Douglas
that's the syndicate regional sugar what
which ones really weird because I'm
wearing that exact shirt right now and
I've just pulled it out of a bag so that

oh my god that thing is absolutely

he was picking his nose he lose his
defender points for them all right we're
on a mission
but we're walking through a back of the
shortcut what the hell is going on down
here
it's like a booking rave what's going on
this is soul cards I'm nosy boy DJ
there's a mini mus the smallest mutt
girls I've ever seen right I think or
maybe going this way seen signs we are
heading the right way we're trying to
get across this bridge to a ferry
terminal to get a ferry across to Macau
Macau Macau Liddy taught me you say like
McDonald's and Khao Macau so we're going
to Macau and then hopefully it's a
firework display
9:45 so if this guy's giving us the
correct information he's right but
hopefully they see some fireworks
tonight however we're not actually 100%
sure on the fireworks thing so it's a
bit like hit or miss we gotta try and
get through customs quick this will get
us in at 9:30 and the firework displays
at 9:45 Oh a beautiful place to get onto
a ferry you've got the city behind you
over there we got a ferry over here
tickets uh sure it's like we've just
ripped out playing seats and still come
on a boat that's kind of what a ferry is
do whatever this glass wasn't so murky
how beautiful as well so clearly it's so
nice was it
oh there's chicken yeah watching it I
was watching the Olympic ice fails so
kind of missed it sorry
welcome to Macau we're always a casino
into this Harbor it's we think the
firework display starts so we finally
arrived we have to go through
immigration which could be made you busy
could be dead no idea
get a taxi head there and try and see
some of the power if they're even on we
got in a taxi we're on the way we're
gonna try to get as close to tower as we
can even if it's
okay stop all of the skies light you
know literally see the skyline like you
know but we can't see the bio works like
milk see the red smoke we're just trying
to see them then this is the parade but
we're trying to see the fireworks which
are in the background right behind this
building walk don't worry
yeah it's gonna be like a 20 minute show
think about a 20 minute show they're
gonna write down a building movie
together they sound so big the thing is
like I'm saying this right now
the McHale Tourism Board did an awful
job of advertising it but no wait we
couldn't Google it we couldn't even
Google the ferry times to get over there
we couldn't find anything like it was
terribly terribly advertised terribly
even people we don't know don't know
don't know some people will like no
that's not no oh no yeah this this is
another poor it's just like Park if we
were definitely known like all the
details that we could have got it sooner
could would have known it wasn't it was
only because of the fucking doorman that
we found out we care to get you oh my
god who cares what the pilots were these
hotels
there's a massive cloud in the way we
definitely missed the big ones that's
for sure absolutely sucked but there's a
muscle pumping out literally a fog
everywhere so we couldn't even see them
from the car the only fireworks out
going up now or like people setting off
fireworks over here so have a shame
Bobby fuck it
may I can I'm good that we missed them
but you know what we tried and it's none
of us feel like just sitting in it we
were sat in the hotel room for ages just
like rested it's like yeah we'll be fine
we'll have plenty of time to get over
there and then we got to like the boat
station we'd miss the previous boat by
like 10 minutes or so so go ahead yes or
is it the end of the world truly just
couldn't see them there's too much fog
like you saw it on video there was just
too much fog they're just getting
covered and hid inside the cloud well
the only reason I'm walking down here
now is because there's like family
setting off some like crappy little
fireworks just gonna have a look you can
buy fireworks here and go and set them
off oh yes know where you can set up I
would like adults only and the fireworks
these people are setting off to the
fireworks set up here like you're wait I
heard on the time you're allowed 5
rocket person and then you just come
here backwards and samo
where's it
oh that's a little on his own we need to
do this in England that's going to walk
they sounded oh my god that was amazing
are they setting these up right now oh
my god um no that's the big one I said
everyone that's the big gun
that was me this is like don't get me
wrong the greatest firework display was
on but this is like the greatest
firework event amateur display yo wait

think we might be I think I might be
selling it rather than oh wait unless
he's selling it Oh is he doing it oh
hell yes I want to do this how much is
this very suiting first-aid this way
he's going for it make this guy's got

let off like a thousand
that just showing necessarily amazing
coke not with mastic don't someone's got
money

different kinds of fireworks but then
look at the size of the fire craft as
you can buy oh my god insane me and
Olivia may have found our own private
fireworks show some guy buy absolutely
shit loads of fireworks and they're
carrying it on this pallet now that you
may or may not be setting them off or
we're gonna follow it and find out that
this guy's their works are over here but
he's got some firecrackers watch
O'Malley put it off me this is the
biggest box you can buy and they cost
like 300 pounds for this role oh my lord
