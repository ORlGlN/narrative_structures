pocket not have to worry about the
scratching it this I'm getting one of
these
so dad got eggs on toast you've got eggs

got everything what the hell is that
just think he's gonna be my
brother-in-law
oh no I'm not people need to get this
out their hand we'll just stop with it
okay Becky sure I would have totally
just showing you guys my parking job but
it was actually that bad that I'm too
embarrassed to even show it to YouTube
however we're going getting some new
speakers I'm going it in speakers that
I've got in my la salle my U K sup cuz
they're fuckin temp good
well that is severely displaying they do
not have them at all
well I cry every time they don't have
the speaker's of one and then checked
another store and a bunch of actually
like building stores retail shops to see
if any where I had it installed and they
don't so I got water in my hands on the
thing is why I want to drive to these
places is because I own a vehicle yeah
sick parking Tom sick parking right on
the line like a ticket to be fair no one

and then I parked it cuz you've so much
space I didn't mean to park like this so

okay just don't care just okay
Ken's doing all the hard work do you do
the vote ah
anyway Ken's dieudonn√© hard work what
I'm sat in my pimp chair
that's so cool everyone always asked me
but this about this in my blogs and the
answer is it's for special occasions
that's why I put a lock on it it's like
none of my friends or people who come
round will write a pie just grab it and
drink it Oh Joel okay
the silicates ntral 1 million subscriber
button you put that on the wall there
and then this one over here this is my
first one syndicate project channel one
gonna grab that and put up a ball yeah
I love it I love the speakers around my
house I just blast music all day yeah
infuriates me because my account in
PlayStation 4 world is American I can't
buy using British credit card PayPal or
anything the codes and I can't go to
Amazon and buy the codes I have to ask
friends like Dino over here after
painting paint Pal to go on to Amazon to
buy me codes to be able to recover them
online so I can pretty much just gamble
with carbines fuck so random that
PlayStation will not let you change your
region so I made the account in America
and I'm living the usually account in
the UK it won't let me transfer it over
and it won't let me use a British credit
card paper anything to be able to buy
any sort of like add-ons anything so I
have to do this every single time right
I have to go and ask my friends like can
you or can you please comply me some
blue cut points because I'm going to go
do it so yeah please so yeah that's
that's basically what I've been doing
every time a by DLC shit the fact that I
found a way around dividing funds and I
got $100 on my account it then pops up
saying maximum amount of funds added
what is going on PlayStation okay okay
maybe I overreacted and you're only
allowed $100 on your account once bought
we be good I bought four of the 39 $99
packs these so I'm gonna have 20,000
card points to be able to spend on we're
going to do some liquid Davidians
I'm going to do some all that play one
so we'll see how that goes but I should
be able to tap now back into this and
then go into the factory and then spend
card points for liquid divinium
okay 600 Cod points gets me nine liquid
davidians you see wait what the hell you
have 200 okay I reset the game and are
you taking the piss that after I just
added two hundred dollars worth of cod
points okay it says I've only got two
hundred what the fuck why I hate things
that are never simple for the love of
tits be held only by three with the free
three ones it gives you and I get a max
fyz on nuke great this is great
five minutes later my playstation
crashed trying to get it working since
some reason just decided not to work but
