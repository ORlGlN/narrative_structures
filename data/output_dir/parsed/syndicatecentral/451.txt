JB's head Wow hello is in German welcome
to a new day a new dawn a new vlog it's
really early in the morning right now
but I got a notification say my dad was
live shooing on Facebook I watched it
this is currently a Saturday morning by
the way and he says I'm going to wit be
on the live stream while she's driving
along on his own I'm like can I make it
to Whitney with it might sound like the
most random challenge of events but
nonetheless I saw him driving on his own
just saying he was like going off on an
adventure I was like thank God he said
where he's going because if I if he's
driving a camper van which is in and I'm
driving my car surely I can catch up to
him and surprise him in the destination
that is going Whitby
of which by the way this entire
destination journey relies on him going
to Whitby if you change his destination
all the way goes yeah Whitby sucks I'm
going to Scotland well folks what other
than that I'm hoping I can catch up with
him on the motorway to Whitby and
surprise him so let's see how this goes
there was no way I was going to catch up
weekend with only like a quarter of a
tank
so I've topped up 34 liters in the tank
I think that'll catch me up scan if not
make it to Whitby we're good 39:57 for
the journey I'm okay with that
not gonna hide the hunt for Ken was all
fun and games until I can't see shit I
feel like I'm on my pedal bike driving
up the fucking hill looking for him like
this is awful I mean imagine the front
of a fucking car and I'm drunk foie gras
ninja jason blundell what the fuck is
this I think I'm getting closer to Ken
I've been following the road and I found
some Christmas lights that means one
thing ken must be close there's a I
don't know what the hell that sign is
it's a jigsaw piece a train truck a
fishing hook and an eye sign
he must be that way problem I have now
is trying to locate where my dad is I've
actually made it to the destination
where I want to be but I've now got to
try and work out where the hell my dad
is so this is quite a bit it's quite a
big place so I now need to work out
where a man in a camper van who love
sunsets would park oh wait one sec what
the hell what this road just knocked me
out again this is how this is how calm
believe is rounded it knocked me out of
god damn you oh the power of Facebook
I just sex his Facebook's the obviously
a live stream whilst he was driving on
the way it he puts following the
dashboard ball I just saw any facebook
that I tagged that he stopped because he
was making a coffee in the picture but
tag that was in Whitby harbour now
that's the coast
that's Whitby Arbor I went down the left
side of the harbour so I'm gonna go back
down and drive down the right side of
the harbour I can't think of anywhere I
could miss on the left or along the
coast
Oh Coast the Alba so I'm gonna go back
down that way and try and find him okay
we are in a win but a fail
cuz I've located several camper vans but
I don't know it's once my dad's I don't
know his license plate I know he's got a
bike rack on the back but I don't think
that is I really really don't think that
says I think I think I don't know I'm
not 100% confident I'm not an obscene
confident that might be him that might
just be him this is him this has to be
him there's no way it's not there's no
way this is not him I think I can
recognize this so it is a hat on the
wind show that's him
this is him this is him I've drove three
hours off a whim to try and find him
and I found him but the thing is he
might I think he's like fallen sleeping
so I don't want to wake him up I could
if you pissed off as hell he's like I've
come in to escape and so I might just
say my cat and sleep and when he wakes
with him on and you might see me in the
car so I I don't know we'll see well I
might I could ring given be like I look
out you would know and it's Eva but I
might just sleep in my car there so he
looked out the window in the morning
it'll see me that I'm like what the fuck
he's now gonna become the how comfy is
an Audi TT to sleep in challenge and
I've got a really funky jacket way I'm
rock clothes with me no joke at Sarat
clothes and like stuff to brush my teeth
with I brought a towel he goes women
curtains boxer shorts shoes syndicate
original merch toothpaste and a spare
hat for my dad what I do is I could
leave that on his whim only like Wimmer
oh he wake up with money like what a bug
and then I just park next to him and
would be sad because Ben complained
about he hasn't got a hat for yourself
all right oh I tell you what I use as a
bed cover in the off chance he waked up
and doesn't realize this is my car I'm
gonna park right next to him so when he
wakes up you'll see it definitely oh man
I managed to actually fall asleep
it was awful in the my own info like an
hour sleep I'd proper shit myself proper
proper shit was husband but that woke up
he saw me packed it I don't know how he
know if it was me oh he noticed I
thought that syndicate hat on his front
of his car it was a parking ticket
but he's invited me in anyway so I'm
glad to sleep what was your reaction
when I turned up I'm the first night
runway out the blue did you expect it
you weren't for the heart wasn't on
you'd have been there alone you'd been
there it's a good idea food on the
windshield then it was nice to see you
though Oh get out of here can you it
fix up to you Oh something different to
wake up to rather than crows pecking at
the window I'm not right dad
ain't that right this is where I'm in
the daytime it's a bit nicer more
interesting now don't it how the hell is
that Harbor and how the hell that these
boats get how I am pretty sure this this
tide rises them to escape because
otherwise I'm not seeing how this work
but that was definitely a comfy a nice
sleep in that thing this was a look at
how many character ah I drove around
every Kappa looking for every I found
him but look that's what I that's what I
was in last night kick him back until my
dad walked grew up in Latvian right up
get change on a silica wash it the
pleasure of owning a clothing line I
basically bring clean clothes with me
everywhere I'm such like a homeless man
right now it's great just shaving my bum
beard and believe run below my chin
gonna get some breakfast brush my teeth
and adventure round Whitney with my dad
I think I'll see what today offers am i
doing a good job here I'm using you as a
mirror the only reason I drove three
hours to get here is because I got your
art on and you sell me you didn't have
enough now we've both got a heart take
that off the benefit of wearing hats
when your hair's a potato you hide it
like a ninja
not exactly a full breakfast down but
it'll do
pick a good leg quick location a
location where you lay your head and
rest at night he takes look a good
location to be Whitby bridge beautiful
look at him look at him crazy but like I
just broke enough to go on an adventure
his own I was like screwed up I'm
joining whoa this is like proper proper
like British like oh no oh sweet
yes this is well retro was this wicked
you would be Jim no this is what woody
was famous for okay what make sense
make sense oh so graphite of course I
joined my dad and he's making me climb
that's nice yeah he's gonna make me
climb 199 steps to take me up to Whitby
Abbey thanks dad
the wait the the parish of st. Mary the
Virgin of Whitby an auntie donkeys
buried over Yeah right
punky don't get very good what do you
have a great this is very had a great
fall okay I'll turn Dean I'll tell you
this one not what you think it Oh
pumped you don't it yeah was a cannon on
the wall there all right and the reason
he called it on to dump the reasoning
it's all there
it was a cannon in when they were a war
yeah he said it was retreating yeah and
you said to leave me behind
so they could get used against them
through it there was dismantling it off
the wall and it fell oh so when it fell
it broke yeah
so when it broke we buried it there and
that's where the story really comes
together I probably put it back together
again though no optic juice until I -
this entire time you couldn't put Humpty
together again
yeah all the Queen's icing our Queen's
men couldn't put on to get something
together again Oh Dean Cain you ain't
just a good-looking man we've found a
smoker ring look at this it's a light
are dripping off the walls
they've got hand curing in it they just
set a fire in the middle and then they
just have the fish I think this is
mackerel just chilling in for me while
this loads whoa look at the wall is it
sticky
ooh I know my finger smells 140 years at
the Saffy yeah but we not never talk
come on boys yeah come on
Oh stuck on your fingers now grandpa
smells
what is going on here with wizardry
there's a fallen yeah we should go down
to it it's like a full-on car ever these
are guys are pretending to be wizards or
something or witches it's all I laughs
but nonetheless it's remember last night
when I was sailing my stay at a hotel
and when I stopped said I was looking
for my dad that is where I was stood
outside and I walked down to there
that's where I was all up yesterday so
oh they're nice we have no idea what's
going on no idea look at it place is
beautiful
yeah there's what you have that the
wide-angle iPhone lens for way onto the
dangerous clothes
um the closer I've got the less of
understood I think it's like a photo
shoot of the mall looking like Devils
and stuff that's what I'm going for
I'm assuming that guys like the local
photographer from the newspaper and then
that other River filming a scene for
like a show maybe I like how that
monster has babies in his back pocket
I thought oh ki ki Joon's not exactly
what I expected to wake up to see today
I still really don't have any idea
what's going on apart from one person
with the beard in the red be walking
around with a bag of candy see saying
I'm the good guy and handed out to
children so it makes lots of sense
this is the grave of Humpty Dumpty hence
the shape also we made it to top we
climbed all 199 steps but Dad run up
every single one so he's exhausted I did
want every three not good no try catch
our breath back is this altitude we're
at yeah and it will add a lot of grapes
and of course me and my dad have found a
microbrewery which says shop open I love
until 5 this homemade alcohol we're
gonna go check it out guess what
Smuggler's goal habiba this is where
they make it nice there we go we got a
microbrewery drink down it is actually
nice with the peristyle
yeah yeah
pressing the button of the bottle Ryan
Carla take a screenshot it's nice really
I didn't film in there drinking there's
only a small little quaint thing but
else my phone on charge in there so I
won't reviving ten percent to 41 Oh
though we're okay we might as well go
into the church are I think that's the
abbey this is the church we got my dad
Wow well is it a Christmas tree
decoration cosmo tree contest whoa
that's a lot of trees oh no this is my
kind of tree gingerbread tree whoa
mary antoinette pat pâtisserie I think
that's always it I actually can't
believe how many trees are in here like
I love Christmas stuff so it's easily
gonna be 100 right Oh what I know it may
have been impressed with that wooden one
but I found a toenail Christmas tree no
joke Oh fingernails fingernails
Christmas tree yeah winner winner winner
winner fingerling I'm not sure how but I
managed to make my way up here I was
like I need a better view of the trees
so I found the highest point I could
find look my dad is actually live
srimant by the world Facebook down there
so were just kicking back things he's a
pro stream in LA
first he was a vlogger than an
instagramer than a Twitterer now as a
streamer it's at this point I don't
think I'm supposed to be up here

no sign saying don't go this way so I
just kind of wandered I know now I'm
kind of lost
if you all if you don't see me again I
was kidnapped like this dog whore whore

probably have to turn it on by pressing
that button but I don't want to do that
I'd rather not get in trouble
thank you very much okay this time I'm
definitely lost
I don't know what's going on but I found
it really weird didn't garvik I feel
like Indiana Jones
what can I find ring oh my gosh look at
all this chocolate as a chocolate oh

see why kids and try and eat these can
hear battle on us look at him that looks
delicious if that was food I don't well
League that really not won't even be mad
about what oh we found the bakery shop
that it's attached to and I'm having a
gingerbread man and a cup of tea because
we're British and that's kind of what
would you eat pastries and shit last
kind of thing I was expecting to see him

the monsters on the beach they want to
kill them ah we found my lion but they
have pugs squirrels doctor who can't
over that's my juice or something snakes

same coat the same hat all right now
we're wearing different coats no hats
the same t-shirts
fashionable pair that's all I can say
you've picked a solid place to come
which is a good good shout good things
to do but this is a wellness restaurant
I thought it looking like a sketchy bar
from the outside but it's beautiful
what's wrong and now he wants to share
some muscles with the starter oh he's
trying to woo me it's because he had no
clothes that I have to give in my
t-shirt okay you can't come to the
seaside and not have muscles and to be
honest I've had one it's such a really
good chill out okay listen I went this
time because I'm at a seaside town and I
Roxy foolishly chose for such a good
decision

nun all right

meal so far has been incredible
incredible ignore the bad beard mustache
right now because we're going for a
review I'm gonna give it a nine we're
going for nine the reason why I couldn't
give it any higher any Lord is I
couldn't decide on the chips the chips
were proper chips they're really good
they weren't too crispy they were soft
but not too soft but not too hot but not
too cold which sort of a warm I know it
doesn't make sense

good I had a salad with it a really good
dressing so damn good they and the

tenth the so flavorful that's
