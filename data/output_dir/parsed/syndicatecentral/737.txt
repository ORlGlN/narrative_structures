oh my goodness me a my time but let the
record show is nine o'clock in the
morning and I got up to head to track to
go and record the DLC early okay you
might guys me like that's amazing it is
track thank you so much for the
opportunity before I decided not to go
and you might be like why would you do
that
I'll tell you the long story short
version of it is we get to go there and
cut the DLC early ready for the launch
day we don't get supposed to early or
anything like that but when we go there
the space has got loads of other
youtubers there that have been flown in
from all across the country to play the
game early record it you know that star
stuff it's really really cool and it's
an amazing opportunity from Treyarch but
what you can't do is have enough space
and privacy to be able to do like a live
face cam you know recording live view
first attempt so because I can't do that
and that's my favorite thing to do and
post on YouTube from the DLC that's why
I won't be going so once again track
