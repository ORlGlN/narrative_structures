after that London Fiasco I guess he
doesn't want right good to see ya I've
got to go to a dentist is gonna suck oh
man failure calm Lydia sent me a phone
number to ring for my appointment so I
did rang him up but she also sent me an
address
I thought the address was for the one
that rang gob but the address was for a
lack of dentists that could have gone to
instead of the other one so I went to
the wrong destination therefore I think
I've missed my appointment
and they stunned me I think I had to go
back for I think four fillings I have to
go back car dad damn expensive I'm
praying and hoping my car hasn't been
towed are given a ticket I think I was
allowed to park there but I guess I'll
find out I had it coming on like
dentists and stuff yeah you look after
your teeth and all that but the amount
of what do you spend on putting food and
drink in your mouth it makes sense to
have to spend like enough money looking
after your mouth so yeah for for
fillings and I've got a watch out to
make sure that one of my root canals
hasn't created a hole underneath my gum
