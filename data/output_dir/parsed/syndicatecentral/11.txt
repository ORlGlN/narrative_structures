cannot volume how happy I was when I
played the PC for the first time because
it was so good isn't that true me happy

cheek to cheek and live it the PCs so
good like just edit in the video
together of the PC it makes me so happy
like it's incredible
I can't believe I was up till 6 a.m. 6
a.m. and I've still got such a smile my
face think about how good pop G runs I'm
gonna download Rainbow six siege because
everyone's been telling me to do it's
truly 558 p.m. I had to re-edit the vlog
because I miss some stuff I love it I
forgot to put it god damn it
oh because I've got 2 pcs I can leave
that one rendering wait for well I've
gotta wait for it to render and then
immediately run down to the office to
get it uploaded I can leave that up
there I can walk in here turn on this
please PC and play poop G beast love it
I've now got fortnight installed pub G
installed I'm installing black ops 3
which has been downloading for 5 hours
and 45 minutes with 5 hours left to go
because it's 84 gig that's ridiculous
I've just absolutely scuttled my funds
this laptops been left there on charge
like all week like ready to go when an
idiot I don't here I've got the vlog
took Lola's gonna go down to the shop
and upload it but the battery's been
dead on it cuz someone plugged a oh ok
the Volta me major late that was like
half past 6 it would take about maybe 10
minutes to upload there with it bought
this isn't gonna be possible
well this is disappointing I know I
uploaded the vlog later than I usually
do anyway but it's been uploaded now for
over 45 nearly 50 minutes and it just
says processing 0 usually it shows a
time I estimated 30 minutes until it's
done and nothing so YouTube's really
messing me over and this is the most
stressful thing about the job fact that
that video took like over an hour and 20
minutes to upload if I had my fast in
and there I could have made me done it
in 5 seconds smaller but because my
Internet's so bad I'm gonna try and
delete the video go down to my dad's
house and use his internet because his
internet faster in the hopes that I can
get it to work because of right now
it's not in I'm supposed to be streaming
I'm Abed new PC today boy yes I can't do
that just yeah I've got go to my dad's
now trying to blow the vlog yeah yep
I'm screwed yes where it all began home
I gave up trying to use my laptop I'm
now using my dad's laptop wired and it
seems to be AB loading book this is
gonna be my fourth time I've tried
uploading yesterday's vlog and it still
just doesn't seem to be working
we managed to get the photos printed off
from gales birthday and oh yeah oh yeah

photos in my phone and I don't look at
any of them whereas this it's just
they're just so nice to go through
that's a good photo and that's a good
but that is the best though really
oh Father's Day right we birthday

like on a wind-up camera I looked so
terrible
Oh God and then this one's a Lydia
selfie taking skills much better than my
right I have reloaded the video it says
100% but it says processing again this
is the problem we found before and it's
not giving me a time of how long he's
gonna take the process but I'm gonna
wait patiently let's see if it works
just like that legend Ken saves the day
my internet my house was just not
working YouTube then decided to stop
working everything just went to shit and
legend Ken legend can save the day - get
the fuck up loaded three three hours
late yesterday you know I was like six
buckle the dogs there on time well it
should have been it should have been
there six o'clock on the dot I can't
believe we have to re-render it but I
was like I've got enough time to get
laughs a lot of time and then I had
enough time to get live but then what
happened
YouTube's broke so I was kind of screwed
- gonna so I need my new Internet the
wife was a let's oh the wife is a legend
but who actually won the 50 pounds be
fair this is bingo rules who shouted
bingo
y-you saw right through a scrap all this
food is amazing so thank you all right
it's moving time it's moving time for
the beast power off power act and time
to move upstairs damn it I just realized
this isn't kind as easy as it sounds
well it is but I've now got to get that
hard drive not that one but the one I
just recovered up to my dad's with the
videos on take off all the pictures all
the files all the sound effects
everything that I need off this computer
and onto the new one
I just wanna pop gene streaming well
then here's a problem that I've got now
is I can now run the games in like 4k
beautiful like I love it but I still got
extreme it more than 720 I cry I'm gonna
probably need to come back on this PC
for something but for now goodbye old
friend
look what a way for it to say goodbye he
fucking crashed that way together this
is I'm gonna whip this up so all the
cables are standing up nice and tall so
come on come on come on come on come on
electric desk for the win we going to
hear and start to unplug everything it's
mainly just us bees
goodbye goodbye PC it's dead mono man
did this PC do me proud over the years
it's super hella dusty and I should have
cleaned it out a bit more boy there's PC
to be very very very proud of the user I
have to admit Nvidia thank you so much
for it was a beast it's I never had a PC
so small and alive cuz I'm used to PCs
being like this not like this so if you
wonder why the panel is by the way it
just came off so just yeah with rocket
it was rocking a Titan in it to be fair
I probably will still use it I might
actually put it downstairs in the
basement as a guest a guest streaming PC
if I just put new graphics card in it we
should be okay for welcome home welcome
welcome home
ignore this cable management for now I
do have some my cable white sleeves
which I'm gonna try and slip them into
once I guess
longer cables however please still be
alive
moment of truth oh she's still kicking
it may look like she dies but she just
turns on that's just a startup technique
are you kidding me Oh everything is
undisplaced math pc facing this way
there's one thing i need to do though is
I need to have a few more USB ports in
it cuz I've got so many little random
things like well I even use the USB port
in the side of this I've got an extra
extended USB thing here for like these
USB so I need to get another USB of
alright you know a USB extender added
into the back of this I've decided on a
brand new background for my new computer
and it's this I think it looks very
beautiful and I've picked it and think
it's amazing I've managed to get
everything rocking and rolling on my
computer apart from one cyclist
let's just go to this real quick let me
yeah resume the download it's been
downloading for it's been downloading
for however long but it still hasn't for
yet downloaded and is still 40 gigabytes
to go I I cannot believe this I left it
on all day once that's downloaded then
got it download the DLC which is gonna
soak because apparently that's an extra
30 gig but I've got Sony Vegas install
I've got OBS installed all I need to do
is sort out my notifications for
streaming and then we should be good to
go like I'm ready to rock and roll this
new PC it has taken me all day to do it
like to anyone else who just like wait
to jump on this PC like if you just
buying it to play if you jumped on this
PC install the game you've got faster
than that you'd be up and running in
seconds like put G still runs amazing on
it
I finally got my recordings and all that
stuff side so like I said yesterday it's
like cheating it's not cheating it's the
way it should be played these games are
designed to look amazing and be amazing
but if you're playing out like goddamn
potato you can experience that but that
amazement like you just can't but when
you're playing on a piece like this
again I really take me that long to get
a new PC like I could have even just
easily just bought one like rather than
waiting for a PC company to work with
there's something I could have just got
bought one I had companies just saying
like hey we'll send you one for free
anyway but I wanted to work out a
partnership with a company instead so
it's like I could another PC so long ago
but I just never I was like no I don't
think I really need one I did from what
I'm seeing from you guys the feedback on
the new computer is absolutely beast
mode what I've actually managed to
finally get rolling like rock and roll
it is everything I've got the Sony Vegas
installed million program from my blogs
this is gonna be my first test to see
how long it takes to render out the vlog
I did do a clip test for gameplay
footage not not the vlog which is
gameplay footage and I could render out
like a 30-second clip in like 12 seconds
like 1080p 60fps and I was like that's
amazing so I'm gonna see how long it
takes to render out a 10 minute vlog in
1080 60 FPS usually takes 20 minutes
well let's find out how long it's gonna
take on this bad boy boy yeah I'm
absolutely loving the computer so far
I'm gonna do my first ever stream today
and it's still gonna be using my potato
internet so it's gonna be hard to watch
a show off the quality of the games that
I've got a mind to you guys buy a stream
but it is what it is nonetheless it's
five o'clock gotta get this edited
uploaded start my stream and then at 8
o'clock it is indeed Wesley B's birthday
and we're all getting together for some
surprise drinks for him now we usually
always just go to the pub and have
drinks so it's not exactly something
like crazy new and exciting but he's
texted I'll be like hey y'all come out
for drinks what birthday we've all given
it like I'm out in town we live in a
menial I'm off doing there such ease off
doing that you know everyone's busy and
he's kind of parently really
disappointed so we're gonna go in we're
gonna surprise him we're gonna wish him
a birthday and add some drink to them I
don't know if he wants to go to
Manchester or anything and then I end up
getting absolutely bleep blitz it tits
tonight so let's hope that's not the
case because I want to stream tomorrow
or I can just go out and you know drink
sensibly
but we all know that's never gonna
happen but I guess we'll see how the
night pans out so guys thank you very
much for watching you will be watching
this vlog hopefully on time issue you
know what I was in bed last night at
like 5 o'clock the money tossed in
telling me like Oh guys you know what
this 6 p.m. I don't think is I'm gonna
keep working out like it's never worked
out maybe we should really just change
the time completely what should I do
so the point where I was like we'll see
how it goes when I get my new Internet
and if I can get the vlogs out on time
if I can then sick but if I can't then I
may just change the upload time to no
time it may just be uploaded whenever
but you can of is anyway now so just I
guess nothing changes I think this is
gonna be hard to see on camera but can
you can I see that rainfall in there
that is amazing
but it's so bloody beautiful but I'm
going so thank you for watching
let you guys know in tomorrow's vlog how
long this takes to render out and
hopefully we'll be very impressed so
much love to you faces on her stop big
Hoss
