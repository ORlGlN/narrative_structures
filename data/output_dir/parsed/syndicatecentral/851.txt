good fuck I lied it's not filling up now
yeah I'm no longer for alone
you know legs are gonna speak to anyone
I'll fucking wish by this cook it was a
pleasure being inside you for a brief
time for a brief moment
it was very majestic I know you guys
love my swag but we're right now above
the clouds flag or just cooked whatever
hell it is we're five six and a half
hours
but the fuck was that in a nail just
come off but that way to Russia I mean
Moscow one Moscow second course it's
time to play some csgo I just watched
the film true story and it was pretty it
was pretty deep but I'm the trap low 60s
girl games extreme bombs and see if I
can increase my aim this is how it's
done boys this is exactly how it's done
oh yeah
crazy
so crazy
weird little frozen lakes I think is the
Lord
they've got hot chocolates on this play
and I'm much like cowboy fine it's
pretty it's called a policeman it's all
good so far cold but we're almost about
the wand in Moscow and then a twelve and
a half hour flight to LA yeah
guess Daisy did it update your fly
planes now but they keep giving me free
tea every time I fly give me free tip
the hell is going on that's kind of mad
are they washing it is
they might be sprayed without anybody
really
I say I say masters of fire then that's
just can't ski I just realized the
ecology map terminal
oh this isn't it this is it I can throw
a grenade for that one because it's a
glitch no Russian I just watch on the
airport for ages looking for an elevator
just to do that with you guys are
welcome
you're fucking welcome am I going to end
up finding pamaj hiding at the end of
this corridor we're getting ready to 360
noscope but fuck me for some reason it
just doesn't make sense that Moscow
being like Russia's capital has a TGI
Fridays in the airport
my brain hurts I've been waiting so long
for it
and the Wi-Fi sucks I can't get a vlog
up I need to try fi the business lounge
it's just randomly walking along and
then this guy says hello watch is my
YouTube video so yeah they got Maxime
pleasure to meet you oh my god finally I
found one looking for I found the Wi-Fi
connector I'm hopefully gonna try and do
a road okay I am that internet wasn't
working out for me so I found the
business lounge I didn't know they had
one but I found it so now hopefully
they're trying to get a fuck about it
this business lounge is fucking awesome
apart from the Wi-Fi the potato
yet all these beers were free and then
obviously yep vodka random and when in
Russia I have spent the last hour
frantically trying to get Wi-Fi moving
different locations connecting to
different internet spots and
unfortunately not had any look
whatsoever in a board in the vlog I got
to 22% uploaded and now I've got going
at the plane so it's not gonna be up
yeah I probably got like 16 hours worth
traveling now so I'm gonna have another
vlog late really upset about that kind
of bummed out but I'm trying for you
guys I'm trying unfortunately it's just
not paying off
there's the bay this is the thing that's
going to get us there alright 13 hours
worth of flying here we go
this guy keeps enjoying my vlog keep
standing like what are you doing
but this planes to onboard Wi-Fi and if
I try to upload my vlog it would cost me
four thousand five hundred eighty
dollars to public what that's not the
day across oh we in that business class
again with a window seat yeah hey
everywhere I look in my bag there's just
T everywhere
god dammit I'm not my British found the
goods there we go handle basically just
headache medicine put on my mom said and
I'm quoting my mom here that bully
medicine is actually just a load of crap
and it's just parsing it yourself she
said you take the eyes dead so mum for
once and listening to your advice and
hopefully I'm gonna get bad otherwise
I'm gonna come back to England and kick
you in your left breast it's kind of
weird I dropped my phone when did you
tell I'm just making groaning noises as
if I'm evolving this life
it's just worthy Bell hey being oh yeah
it's good I got some chicken noodle soup
yeah it's not phone
it's the basically it's the iPhone to
control do you made sweet I am so cozy
so so cozy
she Wilson she loves watching vlog every
time I talk she's like well time to
choose what I'm gonna have for food
he's get rid of that why menu we were
replacing that with their magic there
with medicine well
shit see I am smart I do not drink and
take medicine at same time it is not
safe but I will be doing now is having
hot chocolates the entire journey and
drinking liters and liters of whatever
but anyway and I see we're gonna have
for dinner today that sounds amazing
scallops fried rice and eggs yes I have
absolutely sweltering with heat right
now I've got this blanket on whilst
picking my food a hoodie just a t-shirt
and jockey Bob and I am boiling myself I
have such a fever it is not even funny
but I kind of sweat this shit out this
is the first time I've ever noticed that
it actually rather than it being a seat
belt sign and a cigarette it's actually
a seat belt
I'm laptop to the mobile phone on your
marks get set go and I just realized I'm
getting dripped on by the fucking aircon
units I'm being back at my fucking
apartment Jesus Christ and it's gone
that's a proper
it's like a weird combination when I got
on some flights the power outlet to
charge my laptop that works for the TV
isn't working so hopefully the reset
ones and it didn't start working on the
reset again so fingers crossed that fix
it but it takes like 50 minutes to reset
it so in between them I'm just gonna
Spotify offline and to attune and jump
in a California saw
that must be weird without hearing the
music
it was
episode I think
and I finally got this thing working it
broke through times the way I got it
working and cleaning that's what I tried
rubbing it nothing I got a way of coffee
was like a car and it worked success
okay so the Hobby episode three is
fucking crazy episode two really no
wonder it took it dies anymore anyway I
got hot chocolate and he gave me a
flower
that's a little bit random to give it a
play level
we're supposed to deal with it is it a
snack do I eat it
time for soup so much food I just slept
for nine hours
oh my gosh I just woke up 30 minutes
before about to land that is awesome
such good timing because now it's only
like 2 o'clock in LA so I've got my full
day ahead of me and it's like I'm not
going to be jet-lagged or messed up time
wise this is absolutely awesome this bed
was so funny so comfy look like glad I
look I got I woke up I woke up in time
to get more goddamn teeth at least this
one we haven't got collector's edition
shall continue my fucking Pokemon and
that's downtown I like ooh can you see
that bridge there a big one across the
road from that it's three BD offices you
this is quite possibly the worst place
on earth u.s. terminal lax Tom Bradley
security each person equates to five
minutes
therefore if there's a hundred people
per view that's 500 million she have to
wait so you get to security yeah I'm
gonna be a for about three hours Fogg
there's a dude stood over there safe
achievement undershirt boom they go
roosterteeth shout all right we made it
food security and for the first time in
about three and a half years I'm gonna
have to go and collect a bag from the
carousel which I'll show you is
completely terrible and these guys throw
up on me in the background but anyway
let's go get it done this is where I'm
going to believe because that woman took
forever in Russia to you know putting
all my information from my bag this way
I got feeling I've been here for about
half an hour that they've lost my bag
leave your bets now as I say that I'm
actually founded success we had a second
load of bags that got empty but we'll
count big the carousel is like how many
fucking bags around that's why I never
trouble with a bag
I always just take Hannigan's instead my
flue is clearing up but my next big
mistake is wearing sweatpants in LA I'm
about to drench and sweat I am so
looking forward to getting in that
shower and just getting cleans I've been
doing nothing booked sweating out this
flu for the past 24 hours
no more flu and I started to tell you so
if you guys remember I had all these
curtains over here in these bags
well basically these are the curtains
and if you know it's something they're
not quite big enough yeah you pull this
to here I need to sell it all back
because they're too they're too small
now that's one problem that's too small
cool story we go into my bedroom here oh
these ones fit and not quite and two -
sure so that that's awesome as well but
hey at least we managed to get one of
them working which is fucking awesome
but the problem in this one is that they
didn't put the second pole up so they
need to come back and put the second
pole on so yeah I think these may be a
little bit short but now they're kind of
perfect is whatever they look quite nice
actually I like these ones this one's at
least work and I finally I'm actually
just listen to Joe well as song again
I'm really fucking like it about to
asking if I can use in my videos and
stuff and then the new Cardew trailer
for giant just came out so I'm gonna
check the how fat very very hard but I'm
downloading the song and I choose now
playing it through my speakers through
my house so let's go shout and get today
don't got my trailer reaction uploaded
to YouTube oh shit
totally forgot about my vlog oh do I
skip a day do I skip a day knock I've
gotta get it up shit talks got finally
here is the vlog I've been trying to get
up all this time it's now seven o'clock
in LA which means time in London it is 2
a.m. or 3 I'm sorry so no one's gonna
see it but hopefully you guys are
watching this vlog go back and watch
this boy because it was fucking
epic this probably one of the best logs
have ever do again another benefit
Vaughn in the clothing line I go to put
on my hoodie and realize I've got shit
all over it from putting it on the
ground or something at the airport but
look I have a spare because I own the
building company yeah we're going on a
late night expedition and wait by late
night it's like seven o'clock or
something but we're going to in and out
again because the burgers are just so
damn good I would totally jog like I did
last time for one I'm sick and - I'm
tired so we're not doing the fuck
because it's just too hot so yeah we're
gonna go adventure we're going to in and
out going get a nice burger and we're
going to get back here and we're going
to get in bed I'm going to relax because
you know what we deserve it as a team
you and me we deserve a relaxing session
so I'm goes on some tunes walked in and
out and chill this place is about to be
so fucking busy
oh wait you can see inside it is fuck oh
this is gonna take about half an hour
but it's gonna be worth it I totally
just notice this guy's badge says he's
part of this crew on lip sync battle
show on TV package acquired bitches this
is killing me having the food and not
eating it well I'm kind of refusing to
bother eating it until I get back to the
apartment because I don't know I think
it might make the walk home more
difficult if I'm completely full and
just like I want to have a baby and a
shit a baby shit what it's like heaven
walking in my apartment because you walk
in from outside where it's like 80
degrees at night into a 68 degree
apartment oh I'm just stand-in with a
huge AC unit and just like freeze my
nipple up you can see the sweat on my
forehead but hey take a look we do have
a suntan but it paid off the the
instructor well sells out in Russia was
like make sure you put some cream on I
was like you don't understand I don't go
out that much cuz I'm always stuck
indoors playing video games um when the
Sun hits me and not stopping it in any
way shape or form so yeah there you go
oh I told them face bikes a fish a Sarah
but I'll follow on Twitter haha you got
here what's going on
that is a visit I treated banks ATO if
you go in to shave his hair off I'll
follow you on twitter and then also in
the background you can see bags just
sleep fast he was like he could in rain
didn't even see was like you fucking
there and he was there with a shaver
already banks fucking do it all for you

watching like a surprise attack like
straight down the middle Mohawk and then
I'll follow you and then some but of a
wife from you getting back from in and
out sitting eating and watching streams
I got onto the subject of looking at my
vlog of me like helicopters pretty cool
which I just emailed to companies about
me starting up flight lessons with them
I think you gonna do like around for is
something hours and it's like eighty
British pounds an hour but I think I'm
gonna do it I think the random but think
of how awesome the vlogs would be if one
day I just woke up it was like today
we're going to San Diego today we go in
San Francisco today we're flying here I
could literally just get up and go to
these places within seconds yeah we
could fly okay by catching a fly which
probably quicker bought helicopters not
fucking helicopters think of the views
we would see would you just look at them
it made that sound like there was a view
future look at but just think about
looking at them think about it that was
an angry cough I don't know I was going
to say that was gonna say as a had cough
a hash copper it turned out to be an
angry cough but anyway today's get
ruptal bailed out guys I am coughing my
face off my body doesn't feel like it's
