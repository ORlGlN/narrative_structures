Oh okey-dokey Jones this is gonna
confuse a few people you might be like
wait a minute this just does not seem
like Tom's daily vlog and the answer is
it is my daily vlog but this is actually
film the day you're watching it so what
is it this the third second I don't know
but whatever it is this is the the next
day and the reason for this is because
yesterday obviously I was hungover after
the night out where I went out with my
brother hung over his tits after that
and that's basically all that happened
between the past 48 hours I went to
bribery Hall where my brother had a
really good time and enjoyed part in
there and that was that came back next
day woke up hungover did nothing but
watch Luke Cage made a hot chocolate cue
the hot chocolate oh my god the most
exciting thing ever ever of the entire
day is happening right now yeah I'm
microwaving some milk at one o'clock in
the morning because I have involved
today and then after that that was
pretty much my dad who's genuine we did
nothing so when it turns around is like
a daily vlog I'm like well yeah that is
my daily vlog because that's what I did
but I did nothing so what the hell do I
actually vlog in in the actual case then
so I decided that I was gonna use today
as the opportunity to talk about this
subject matter of the hand a lot of
people in asking when are we gonna start
the charity stuff in memory that was
that in memory of Alec and that I'm
still trying to work on the logistics of
it hopefully everything can get rocking
and rolling soon I gotta get the text
number sorry that sort of can text in to
donate and if we can raise the hundred
thousand that would be absolutely wicked
and we'll be saying goodbye to the most
- in the bed yes you'll notice I got a
haircut today so you have to find out
what how that happened in tomorrow's
vlog which is also today's vlog which is
like what the hell this is confusing
subject that we're gonna be talking
about right now is daily vlogging on
this channel as you all know I daily
vlog on my phone upload through my phone
edit on my phone everything thumbnail
title everything I do all on my phone
which is perfectly convenient because I
use the app called YouTube capture app
it's I don't think it's on Android but
I'm pretty convinced it's only on iOS if
maybe I'm both hand me out here they may
have stopped it on that one but
basically I've used this app because
when I discovered I was like this is so
community just add a clip together add
another clip I don't have a clip upload
and it's done and it was just so
convenient the way to do it now I know
there will be other apps that I can use
but basically it got an email off
youtube to our MCM
jetpack which is you know 3bd company
they email then saying hey one of your
partners is using this device to upload
videos and we want to let you know about
in the next like 30 days it's going to
be stopped from like operating and
working so you're gonna have to find a
different way of doing it so basically
the way I make my videos is about to
disappear with that said I know I'm not
like panicky like it's the end of the
fucking world I feel like it is almost
but at same time I'm realistic to think
that okay listen there's several other
apps out there that I can use to make
videos everything will be fine don't
panic but I'm so used to using this app
it's like I've used it for 13 months
they're like nearly every vlogger thing
apart from one video I have edited
without that app I've used it for
everything it's so convenient it's
useful there's a shitload that I don't
like with it and my beg would be please
youtube let me like come on board with
the team and help improve the app so
more creators will use it and it's
worthwhile for you guys to have like I
don't understand why they discontinued
it because like I think you can you
could upload videos for like an iPod
Touch for goodness a like why wouldn't
they allow their own app to be able to
upload videos so unfortunately my method
of making content is about to get taken
away from me which leads me to the
question of do I actually go
professional on YouTube now you might be
like go professional what are you
talking about your sausage roll you
filled with a fucking iPhone there is
what I'm saying that is I fill my iphone
because the convenience of filming on my
iphone editing on my iPhone and doing
everything for my iPhone is so great to
me that I never ever want to lose that
but if they're gonna take away my way of
editing and uploading I might have to
say you know what maybe this is the time
where I say okay we're gonna move to a
g7x camera we're gonna edit on a laptop
we're gonna have music on the vlogs that
sort of stuff it does make it more
difficult for me to like you know edit
it every day I don't mean the vlogs will
be later it'll mean the vlogs most
likely will never ever fucking go up or
just like look they'll be even more
potatoes sometimes than me using an
iPhone plus is then the convenience of
filming on the iPhone compared to a
camera g7x like taking it into a club
and everything like that
and there is the iPhone 7 which has got
better cameras which I could still use
and I could still use the footage from
the iPhone
and the g7x but it gives me this
opportunity to go okay I need to create
a travel bag which has a laptop in it my
mouse keep it like you know not keyboard
it's not one of them built in the laptop
with that said I know I'm not like
panicky like it's the end of the fucking
world I feel like it is almost bullet
sent I'm a realistic to think okay
listen there's several other apps out
there that I can use to make videos
everything will be fine don't panic but
I'm so used to using this app it's like
I've used it for 13 months they're like
nearly every vlogger thing apart from
one video I have edited without that app
I've used it for everything it's so
convenient it's useful there's a
shitload that I don't like with it and
my bag would be please YouTube let me
like come onboard with the team and help
improve the app so more creators will
use it and it's worthwhile for you guys
to have I don't understand why they've
discontinued it because like I think you
can you could upload videos through like
an iPod Touch for goodness a like why
wouldn't they allow their own app to be
able to upload videos so unfortunately
my method of making content is about to
get taken away from me which leads me to
the question of do I actually go
professional on YouTube it gives me the
ability to go okay I get my laptop I get
my phone I get tons of camera batteries
and my SD cards and stuff like that
and I basically travel everywhere with
this backpack so no matter where I end
up or where I'm going I can edit the
video for you guys to have a daily vlog
because the convenience of using iPhone
is to go alright when out pie-eyed do
all this I'm gonna randomly go to Spain
and I don't need to carry my laptop all
that stuff of me all I need is my phone
like I don't take anything else just
this and then I don't have to worry
about like the bean plug sockets to
charge eggs I've got all these multi
charges for like my phone and stuff like
that there's so much convenience of
using an iPhone that if I do switch over
it's like a g7 X camera the quality will
be great but the consistency of the
vlogs may suffer even though the man
already may suffer if I try to do it
like that so I'm really really torn as
to what to do and I'm looking to you
guys to be like alright guys what do I
do this Way's been taken away from me
that I'm used to youtube if you do
happen to see this or anyone at YouTube
happens to see this like please send me
an email be like Tom you know what fuck
yeah we're gonna work on like developing
it up even further with you because it's
such a good app it's such a good tool
there's just a few up
something need to do to it and it would
be so goddamn amazing and I'll be even
more happier but it gives me this look
it's like a fork in the road I ever go
you know what we're gonna continue on
the way I've been using my iphone
everything standard potato is anything
and just use find a different app to
edit the videos with I'm sure there's
tons out there like I might just have to
use like Apple moviemaker and iPhone or
some like that and it'll be simple all I
do is add the clips together no music
normal Stan I just add the clips and
trim or we say all right enough is
enough we're gonna start using a proper
camera we're gonna start doing proper
edit in and commit to vlogging properly
GoPros that sort of stuff so I need you
guys feedback please let me know I know
this has been a lot of rambling but this
is what I was gonna do yesterday but I
just hung over so I didn't want to do it
and I'd really appreciate your guys
feedback and know a lot of people like
the potato vlogs because that's kind of
like unique to my carers characteristic
of being a potato with the hair and just
in general just being a potato
throughout life but there's never twist
a lie and I tip my hat like someone like
Casey who can like he'll go out travel
do all this stuff it's like all this
equipment all this you know and edit
this light basically a movie book that
kind of takes away the fun of like the
day for me like I don't want to sit down
for like three hours edit in a vlog or
something like that I want to try and
keep I want to find the balance of being
able to travel vlog have fun and it not
take up all my damn town that's why I
said at one point I wanted to hire an
editor and like someone to come with me
so I could film do the cool shit that I
want to show you guys and then at the
end of day just throw all my cameras at
someone and then they turn it into a
video so that end up may end up
happening as well but we'll just have to
see how things pan out but right give me
the feedback in the comments down below
I'm sorry that this was all there was
for today it's just it is what it is and
yeah I need to go and get some breakfast
now it's six o'clock in the afternoon
and here still my e'en so thank you very
much for watching I hope you guys
understand what I'm trying to get out
with this yeah look like a tail to us
until I think because there's so much
just weird light and but make sure you
like where and subscribe and I'll catch
you guys tomorrow at 6 p.m. for a new
daily vlog of which you probably won't
be uploading time so I'll just say I'll
see you guys around 6:00 okay so until
then thank you watching and adios
