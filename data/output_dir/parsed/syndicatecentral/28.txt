Oh another day England where it seems
gray a miserable because it is positive
thing from this is I have been sent the
new LG monitor and packages like this
usually from Razer who is this from mm I
did say this package was from raisable
I've opened it up just a little bit and
it's it doesn't seem like a razer
product up I'm pretty sure I know what
this is
I've wanted one for ages because I've
seen nearly every stream in the world
with them but it's not from Razer
it's a nano leaf if you guys haven't
seen these nano leaves you can basically
get these little triangles and they all
interlock with each other so like you
can put like connector and connect some
connective and you could just keep
extending them to the point where you
could fill an entire wall with these
lights now you can connect them to your
music so like you know the girl will be
are you music you can maybe make like
make it ambien you know all sorts of
stuff like fold you can change it to any
color you want as well so but look so
that's a style pattern you can have
that's the style of painting that you
have so that shows that like it's pretty
goddamn cool but I'm just a little bit
confused as to why raises any of me like
is this a company that Razer owns or
something cuz I'm not too sure about
that what I don't think it is but I'll
take it
because I was actually gonna buy one
nano leaves smarter by design welcome to
a smarter life and these these are the
light panels Wow actually quite big I
thought it was much smaller but you
basically connect them all together so
remove this and use these little strips
to attach them to each other and you can
have this big connection of the light in
sort of any pattern that you want so say
for example if I wanted you from the
wall just to have three like that I've
got three like that I could have you
know like a circle I could have like a
music know like you saw it's pretty damn
cool awesome gift raiser thank you so
much for that but I don't know where to
put it like yes I could put it on the
back wall behind me but then when I'm
streaming the light would be glaring
into the camera so don't want to do that
can't really put it on this wall because
this is where I've got my cameras or
putting it at all time so I can't do
that
I don't got any suggestions because I'll
need some was gonna be the day I get a
haircut but it's one o'clock in the
afternoon
right now I've done nothing with my day
so chances are I get it cut syndicate
regionals always so tidy a comb some
slippers a bag a bag a folder some
tissues have been some shoes - bears hi
Alice how are you doing good job you
back and I'm gonna be in the UK for a
while
you excited spend time with me you
followed a part of the bloody seams
woman old here 53 get it together what
is this called coordination brown boots
dark denim blue and a whitish scarf my
god Cameron get your fashion sense
together love you never do I've been
summoned here by Alice to talk about
Mother's Day plans so oh it's almost
like a recorded dish yes I think this
one's crease let's go do that one oh my
god what am i doing
March 3rd 2nd of April I 62 syndicate
yeah
hence you broke your word angle lens
before his awesome to me your days
burger hope you care why should you send
a patrol for awesome joy oh thanks man
this is the same packaging it was that
other one it's exactly the same what I'm
almost convinced that I tried this and
it doesn't fit it's the same just same
package no right look look
coz that shows though that isn't that is
an iPhone X camera setup I suppose put
it on sideways okay wait I'm gonna show
you guys the the reason why this phone
wide-angle kit doesn't work alright so
according to the instructions like
there's different ways you can attach
your own right obviously you can put it
on like this so it goes over your your
lenses right but look it doesn't fit on
properly but what I'm trying to show you
look you lose the top right hand corner
your phone now the important thing here
is on an iPhone X you need the top hand
corner of your phone to slide down your
like settings menu oh my god alright
then put it on sideways but even if you
put it on sideways like over the ones
you seriously how much battery did your
phone
when you handy to be 1% battery serious
I was filming one of those people who
collects these like some people have all
