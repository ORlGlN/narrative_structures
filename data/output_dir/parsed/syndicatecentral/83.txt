up just like I'm never here bitch I
don't know why I got into the whole
Starbucks like like I think I had one
vanillite a once it was like not that
bad after 20 minutes of drinking it the
caffeine kicked in and I was like no I
just drink it all the time so I think
the effect will wear off eventually but
I'm gonna get run over by one or two
cars so AJ you've got to name your car
right now give it a name give it a good
name it's gonna be a good name Vinson
actually then Vincent and look at that
he's actually got a bet on it you can't
afford that Alan it's a full bedroom

share a couch together do you guys
remember when we were all drunk that
Goodwood Festival of Speed and we all
stayed in their hotel room that was the
next Arace that was an experience right
brother thank you very much I'll see you
later what a good dude bye now that but
30 minutes later it's a problem in LA
Live so scarcely a part that takes
forever to get from A to B especially
there's traffic in between take two even
longer booked tend to get shower and
then for boosts you've been great but
you know what it's time for the DC's to
step back into place this is where all
my favourite DC's our and they're like
but my red ones the black and gold's
even on the floor dirt and I love my
blue and gray ones but you know what
tans whip up my grades and by the way I
do not wear my socks tucked in

day that we had I'm quite know about
these ones but name I love this guard

gonna be one of his new building it used
to be a ripped up apart destroyed
building and there's like 20 million
into it or something and it's absolutely
go
I'm going into Stumptown coffee for some
coffee obviously because they sell
coffee it's a coffee shop so let's get
it and get rolling so much cooler like a
Starbucks but it's just like I don't
think it's a big business it's just like
a sudden thing but look like a roast all
the beans in the background all these
cool last machines and stuff and I'm
gonna wait for my coffee the best thing
is it's actually cheaper and Starbucks
yes it is the essence of it looks
hipster as fuck but you know what oh
it's great by the way I haven't get this
one ton no I freckles this is the best
statement I've probably ever seen on a
bin in my life just a standard road but
a save a tree kill hipster this is where
it all starts this is a memory right now
but for the history books for us this
this right here is where it all began
yes the problem of three women blocking
each other in let's see how long this
takes their turn somehow all crash into
each other this is just sexist as hell
but it would be so I'm just gonna hide
and hopefully not get hit by a car but
yeah I was in there a meeting so I can't
really film the executive meetings not

my god dude there's so much space these
beam boats
whoa this is dope this fight I love
split face Oh beautiful good on you dude
this moment bro this this is like
absolutely gorgeous like so gorgeous but
it's like there's so much space
I'll just blogging to myself there's
just so much space like you know like
the thing up oh listen
that's a whoa this is a very revealing
shot oh yeah oh yeah I think this is the
one thing that I wait to do my house in
the UK and like I said from the get-go I
was like I want high ceilings just cuz
it feels so good it looks so grand and
my dad was like yeah but it's a waste to
work it's so efficient because so much
in here I was like that is a fair point
totally understandable I get it and if
my ceilings were high a problem about
three stories but like with this house
you could do three stories here these
three stories easy that's the one that's
the ones number one thing I would change
about my house my idea isn't wanna get
like that gray this Oh what you want to
get this wall gray dude anything
anything anything chrome and gray I like
your style it white chrome and gray so
my idea is I
no I get it I'm gonna make it feel like
a home
exactly yeah wait what the focus thing I
think it's a scroll wheel on the side
right oculus the screen spokes it Oh
push push and slide it's I can't see is
your eyesight that shot unit Yeah right
there
that was fucking perfect I can see like
that these are what some of my granddad
would wear hey glasses again my laser
eye surgery gone it's wore off man
well actually no no see save my laser
eye surgery put me 200% it fix me I'm
now down to about 55% I think yeah so
back down to that again oh we're in
we're in oculus dream deck a VR
experience well I can see what you're
seeing
I could see you soon bro give me
experience white um dude this app is so
know by the way I'm well impressed this
yeah very very nice it's not just off a
room you like space right like my
offices has always been like really
really tiny but I like your space
it keeps baking sound effects my god
look how much I'm sweating in the marks
from the oculus I got so into that then
the thing is like when I always say like
if if I can make a video into a video
that's sponsored I'll definitely do it
if it's a fun experience and oh my lord
I was supposed to record like a 10
minute video be oculus then and I was
probably plaintiff like 45 minutes
rather than 10 minutes so oh so much fun
like so thank you this guy is an
absolute beast I know everyone knows me
about devil boys like a description of
the boy I never put people in like a
description of all just because this guy
set your homie from you letting me do
this and using yourself otherwise I
probably would not have got a dumb boy

channel that was epic I'm sure if you
guys have oh my god video I thought
you're gonna scare me excited so I'm
come in and I was like you're gonna
