morning world it is 3 o'clock nearly 4
o'clock in the afternoon and I'm just
just got out of bed and there's my feet
great just great
I meant stop the video then but I'm
pretty but it like god damn it it's a
beautiful day and that bird is sat in
the same place every damn day I'm pretty
sure that that day when I heard it get
electrocuted I think it's stuck they're
dead but either way it's a nice day the
dead body is still there and the black
ops beta just came out I said I'm
complaining do you hear that noise
that noise you hear it is the most
infuriating sound in the world when
you're just trying to sleep and relax
all you hear is it's the walk basin or
whatever it's called just overflowing
with water sort of think I know how to
turn it off no one else in the house
does butl dick oh my god right okay I'm
throwing this away today that's going to
my book because today is the day I have
to say this real quick
Sonia got a fucking knife in a box and
so you guys go first one and she got
like a really good knife
like I guess $600 knife and it was
factory-new so I'm a little bit salty
about that but check this out this is
the PlayStation Sony sent me I'm gonna
plug it in after I have breakfast and a
shower and we're gonna download the beta
play it stream it and try and just you
know get good at video games again
because to be honest I am not good at
called Yui black ops the other Cod's
I'm good that one not so good just found
something so disgusting like I go to the
cupboard you know just to go in and be
like Oh what cereal am I gonna eat
I'm gonna be a Twinkie am I going to
Frosty's some cocoa pebbles and I look
up and I'm like why is this got moisture
on it
oh my god what's a living species but
that is not mine I do not eat dark rye
bread
Oh God coming over the PlayStation name
is like the most difficult thing in the
world right now it's driving me insane
oh you son of a bitch it said I was
gonna take two hours it's now on five
you joking I know I'm just checking my
blog from yesterday to make sure
everything was all right
and I keep getting DC ads for shoes
because I ordered a shitload of DC's
actually don't see four here but about
that like I realized that I kept taking
all my DC shoes back to the UK I always
go shopping here take the DC shoes back
with me boy I held it like 10 pairs of
DC shoes and I've just realized they're
not here yet and I paid for one day
shipping
don't tell your fact this is not a DC
shoes another package for Sonya cuz
she's staying here for a bit because you
know she lives in Canada and she's like
staying here a bit with took her for
like a month or whatever she's getting
so many boxes that are getting delivered
and probably in so many boxes as I have
experienced it when I first like came in
is that like they just lay everywhere
you're gonna collapse them like there's
boxes outside there that Tucker hasn't
collapsed and he got all that stuff like
maybe two three months ago and it's
still there and all these boxes out here
the Sonya and took a get what's it
called like it's awesome they get food
delivery service that comes like every
week drops off fresh food they put it in
the fridge and it's got like a cooking
instruction list with it but they don't
collapse the boxes so there's just like
a massive pile of boxes and I guarantee
one day I'm gonna lift it up and find a
spider which I'm not very excited about
so one day we might do a vlog of me
finding like a black widow or a snake do
even snakes exist in LA hang on fucking
now fucking shit throat's a good thing
when I walk into the kitchen at 9
o'clock at night
and I find an almost finish ly drunk
bottle of vodka
oh dear sucker I think he might be
getting on it tonight
well I basically got caught downloaded I
did - true because the dialogue did
actually take like
eight hours which was ridiculous I got
fast speeds booked some reason it just
took forever but I'm playing it and to
be honest give my impressions
I like it I like it but H Emma it's like
it is just another cop it's another code
all I care about is the zombies in it
and that's why I'm getting it but you
know what I'm enjoying it so therefore
I'm happy that's all I care about like
there are some guns that seem really
balanced some guns that seem some gays
some gay shit really unbalanced but like
you know it's in beta this is the whole
point of a beta but what I'm enjoying is
that usually when you have a beta
everyone just pop stunts like that means
everyone's really good usually planning
it's only youtubers bought actually
right now it's not it's like a massive
array of like noobs good players and
stuff so it's giving me a good run for
my money under my gonna lie you guys
don't know I used to play cod you all
the time
so I'm actually coming top of
leaderboard most of time so yeah let's
carry on playing yeah I story time okay
this is where we stand right now I
managed to get an epic kill streak okay
it wasn't that big but it was pretty
good to the point where I wanted it so I
felt like my facebook pages into my back
but I didn't my captured a card flight
plugged in so I was like no it's in the
world where am I gonna do
boy I realized PlayStation has a set
share function where you press it and it
saves the last 50 minutes a game player
whatever your screen was doing I think
and so I was like yo pressed it and it
saved the clip for me but then I've been
trying upload it to dailymotion and it's
failed four times so now I'm trying to
see if I can upload it to my youtube
channel but I don't really know if I
want to connect my playstation account
with my youtube channel sounds like a
bad idea and I'm probably not loaded it
and then D connect it straight away
because fuck that shit PlayStation gets
hacked all the time so attempting it now
can't wait to show you guys the clip
okay dailymotion cannot upload failed
four times YouTube
it's your time to shine no well I upload
so much quicker to dailymotion you reset
it take like 20 minutes to load but
uploading to YouTube
59 seconds white boy says it's done and
it's over here on my tubes of you this
is a video that I've got Chrome night of
the dead dirt
all right so there it is we've gotta
wait for it to process and upload to
YouTube before I can then download it
and put on my Facebook page this is such
a difficult fucking process I do this to
myself like I haven't managed to be able
to record any gameplay for like I've
been playing the new colored Yui
beta for the past five and a half hours
what the hell is wrong with me I don't
want to keep playing but I want to get
to rank 19 so I can have an extra
attachment oh my god this is why video
games are fucking addictive as shit I
think I've set myself a new record this
time it's six four in the morning the
Sun is officially rising and I am going
to bed I told you the bird is still
frigging there it's definitely dead
anyway oh you just flew off oh there you
go well guys thank you very much for
watching I hope you all stay awesome
with like rate subscribe to see more of
my face which you can't really see
because I'm naked now I'll see you guys
