that was talking about this is decide
this is the sound of wait what was the
story Doug you took me and Alice for the
first time from first time down to
London during the London Marathon and
I'm sideburns and why did you choose to
take a photo outside this sign than
anything you could have taken outside
Big Ben or anything but you chose I
chose to pick a sign that I knew would
be there for a long time how old were
the first time we went Wow were you a
job 2002 kind of us twenty seventeen
fifteen year ago no 15 year ago so I was
nine
yeah yeah nine years old the first time

London
Wow look at that fashion sense alice is
wearing DKNY and I'm wearing a oh can
you work out is it a dinosaur I really
can't look up without using my hand
Lucas so this is the first ever time
like we don't understand the point of
mean Alice of why we shouldn't spread a
sign but then how many how many years
later he's a monument two years or three
years two years later two years like
everyone to the same place grew up I
look no different now for some reason
alice is wearing all that mean denim and
I'm been rocking this wagon but then
every time I even made Hollis go down to
London with anyone we always take a
phone that's why we took a photo yes
Joey when I was nine years old compared
to when I was 24 years old oh we're
doing it my head doesn't even meet the
Whitehall sign hey are you out on the
road I'm alone oh oh he's so cute
