many cars so many gods are so excited
first Xbox all right we've made it where
the six we got the tickets now we're
going inside we've already bumped into a
bunch of people which has been pretty
fuckin so it's been awesome to meet you
guys if you hear you guys faces um I got
it so busy there's so many people
excited
Wow the flags of six are inside you so
now yes excellent all right so we got a
fuss fuss thing check this out changes
ok ticket do you have reserved where's
that
wait ok ok alright we're still going
we're still going the Express line so
far has been pretty damn useful look at
this we're just avoiding all this this
is I can't
don't be stupid I'll give you a writ
I'll give it a rating out of 10 I'm
gonna raid the roller coasters when I
get monster I'm stoked
alright XY it was good it was really
good I'm not I don't know how to judge a
roller coaster right out of 10 yeah I
need to do one more and then I'll
compare that one to this one and then
start giving at school we'll see what do
you give this okay now my hair looks
like it absolutely over G me look a gun
oh I look at me I don't know I think
aubergine is like a fruits and all of
that right so that's the second ride we
went on and we went on that twice I'm
losing my voice so badly that ride gets
a nine Oh
no I don't know it'd be difficult to
give it a temple that definitely gets a
nine that was really good were you given
yeah don't know if my change compared to
other rides I'm still gauging my latches
oh you are actually really really pale
but that was awesome I really need the
toilet and I piss myself on that ride it
was great 5:30 during the day and this
guy's got the right idea
I'm not gonna lie I need some food
eventually but look how cool this is
other Looney Tunes people and everywhere
we're gonna try and spot them all like
this we're gonna try and spot them all
but there's a wild ginger this is where
the UK theme packs go wrong we need
capes and lots of capes look at this
everything you can possibly think of no
you may not look impressed what was that
is the most impressive money I've ever
seen I've got to be honest that's a
pretty terrible Batman suit that felt
looks like a potato I'm not even sure
what's going on with his face Lex I
found a jumper but I don't think it's
gonna fit you're right just like
Superman yeah yeah okay
she's ginger it's just got a cool little
nose bye see you tomorrow
oh this is so good I've actually been on
something like this to Alton Towers in
the UK but
okay so the Superman ride I'm given that
a 9.5 that was that good like it also
dented like a backwards like foot sort
of thing and I was just like what the
fuck really really good roller coaster
that one might be my double might that's
my obviously my favorite right now we
weren't it twice I'm totally not sure
what's going on right now but this is
our next entrance - oh shit about Batman
show hoodie Harvey don't we know you're
a bastard I'm glad your face melted
spoiler alert by the way I probably
should've shouted spoiler before that
we're inside this is great
did you say is this an indoors one yeah
okay can i film
Oh so yeah I was like really excited for
that ride and that was a fuckin shit
absolutely I don't I don't even think it
deserves a point you know what I'm
giving it as arrow that's that shouldn't
even be here that shouldn't even be here
it should be flattened immediately so
Six Flags get your shit together and get
rid of that ride the first time I ever
ate something zero out of ten Oh
oh this is nice do you do we have fast
buses for the merry-go-round that's true
statement but if we have fuss buses I'll
totally going on okay Alexis choose
wisely I think this is the kind of one
that goes up going on two piggies I
don't want a pig on a horse go on a
nice-looking horse so these what these
are the ones that go right this one the
internal ones right yes America this is
Stan Stan the stallion look at him
retarded as fuck
good day he did good day
this ride hasn't even started and he
already gets a better rating and a
fucking then a better rating and then I
bat my want it was so bad
look at it though holy fuck
fast okay like how you just keep going
up and then much intense many
appreciation but can we take a second on
this ride to appreciate the amazing
sunset just look at it
six bikes I'm gonna read you out of six
flags earlier for overall all five out
of six you can get
nope
I give Six Flags full of likes why they
need fuckin signs is Twitter 15 days we
got lost
yeah we got lost so damn much book and I
really enjoyed it
time to go home but I still can do to
say the name City I'm just like vlogging
the sunset and I heard someone say
syndicate so they can pause the goddamn
vlog we're not leaving the thing to get
us on the rides Fast Pass totally forgot
we need to return it to collects his
license by the end of the day so could I
go and hand this buck here and get a
license and then we could go home don't
know why but I mean it's ok because last
time we came to Buffalo Wild Wings the
chipotle wings were insane besides to
get them again but this time with extra
sauce like seasoning on it it looks like
