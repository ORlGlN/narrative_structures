my oh my that is some fluffy ass hair
morning to your face is good morning to
the world was starting today off you
know whether at a reasonable time it's 2
o'clock in the afternoon it's fine I
feed my boy what are you doing what are
you doing that's not your usual killing
spot what you chilling on a rock hey
explain myself a long time since you've
eaten on camera you're hungry today hmm
oh yeah you're hungry today you're gonna
get it oh oh oh we got it oh that's a
munching I'm on it oh my new packages
have arrived but I can't open them just
yet that's probably a really bad idea
can't open them until yeah oh shit I
forgot my keys oh that crushes Charlie
cat over open the packages until I get
back from having my hair cut I'm pretty
sure I know what they are and you guys
can take a guess in the comments now it
look like I'm trying to rob someone
right now good fluffy hair suits you sir
well happy with the haircut not too sure
nice to spike it just how I like it
actually really really satisfied with
this one and Daniel damn Daniel look at
this wait what's wrong you they make you
sure no one's crashed into you no one's
crashed into the good old whip feeling
fresh really Rock gonna go home have a
shower because I don't want it yours
looks good man yeah you got some listen
text at your to it my friend
just log it back would you just look
so let's get in them now as usual we
want guesses as to what people think
it's gonna be I've got an idea
and I'm gonna guess it's when the modern
warfare remastered update came out it
wasn't working so take no offense this
women but like a woman okay I got
emotional and upset that it wasn't
working so I did some shopping and I got
some DC's now I actually did however buy
some questionable DC's oh what's wrong
around chili well let's take a look okay
well the audience liked my new shoes
I've already taken my old ones off well
let's take a look and box number one
right what have we got here what do we
got here what do we got here
boom ooh ooh Guilhem Oh kill them I've
gone for a different type of the waste
DC shoot what is this about what is the
world coming to these bad boys look nice
and fresh
yo these are the crabs bro these are the
clips okay box number two what do we got
Oh Oh goddamn
oh god damn oh damn son
oh damn so look at those okay so this is
not a total kind of shoe that I would
usually wear why these kind of remind me
a little bit of converse with this on it
but these are they new shoes I got one
these impact this shoe features impact I
look is impact at what but wait help me
fucking Shh listen Iraq got in the box
and nibbled it last but not least these
were the ones I was most cautious about
but bees and now definitely the ones as
most cautious about because these look
quite nice now so introducing the maybe
well not honest decision them other
color shoes I had were on but these are
questionable I'm ready are you steady a
boom black and gold looking at fresh as
fuck it's got like this very material to
the outside of it which is like kind of
odd but also cause it's sensor but then
the inside alike wintery boots so
maybe that new line oh I actually really
really like these surprising which is
kind of odd
I have probably changed my mind after a
while but like they're nice I like the
different laces that I'm going for now
rather than like the original a big flat
laces it's like these look nice nice and
clean nice and fresh we collect like
these like the same style shoe basically
you can see look boom
Spartans looking sweet as fog and then I
don't know what you cost these as in in
fact as bill but yes so these are these
are gonna be like me everyday ones which
are nice because it's weird like
pretending to be crocodile skin or
something look to them I don't quite
understand that and that looks like it's
been worn see I'm saying why does that
look worn and that one doesn't that
makes no sense
today's the day we cook some breakfast
oh maybe even four o'clock in the
afternoon and I have forget I have
fridge I have I can't believe it's not
butter on the man and down the Sun
cucumber on hand and I got that goddamn
cheddar cheese that motherfucker
