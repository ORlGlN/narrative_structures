takes flight I'm out all day I've been
talking about getting pooed on by a
seagull stood up walk two steps from
where I'm stuck and luckily didn't get
pooed on my head but got pooed on my
hand no joke here's the remnants of it
there was the tube there was a splat I
was stood here and it got me right on
the hand
I guess that's considered good look I
think the seagull decided to move from
over there - right there
kind of intimidated not gonna lie we
were sunbathing over there and then the
share he came in through some baby over
here and then shared came in we were
going to go over there it was too cold
