how to start a day I'm shaving 101 we're
looking fresh we look at clean look at
this is looking good it's looking good
no bald spot for me today but I have
found something else I don't know if
you're gonna be able to see this wafer
zoom in can you see that gray hair yeah
look at that didn't point off the bloody
wrong room achievement unlocked it feels
so good to be awake at a reasonable time
948 I tell you what my if you start your
day right but if you start your week
right then you start your mom's right
probably probably not but you know you
know I'm saying it just feels good to be
wake at reasonable time looking outside
and seeing daylight
how does it feel good the fact is yes I
do believe today is Pancake Day so Lydia
cooked up a bunch of pancake mix even
this morning or last night or something
like that so not only does the wife make
a ramen she makes pancake mix you know
what I got ain't no one else gonna put
these goddamn story away you don't I'm
gonna you know what cuz I'm goddamn
motivated it's only just turned 10:01
love it and I've just filled in Lydia's
mom's birthday card tell me she's not
gonna be impressed with that
quit Trudy hey boo twitch o-o something
about what's on the back what is on the
back oh the little glitch logo I don't
know if you know what that is actually
called the glitch logo for twitch ID no
I did okay
I know Twitter jackets a normally purple
which they did send me one but I'm a fan
of black you know my color scheme in my
house do you see any purple in here no
so this one I guess you can have this
she's officially a streamer she's done
streams and she's killed it so I think
this one's mine it's been in my fridge
since New Year and this was a gift off
the ultimate raving family known as the
Murrays I think I know what it is but I
haven't opened yeah pretty sure
should we have this on pancakes what is
it
selamat guess it's from the Maria pie
it's so hard I'll give you a
oh yeah you have this on pancakes
haggis thank you probably a new disease
somewhat alcohol the party has some
haggis oh it's out of date what is it
what a shame moving up this row no I'm
actually good because if you somehow see
this Adam are George from across the
road like I would have be in it I just
completely forgot it was in the fridge
you went traveling so I apologize that I
didn't eat it but I will try and go out
a way to buy some more myself just to
try it
I don't know how he's supposed to cook
it or cooking instructions your haggis
requires heating until piping hot that's
the only instruction with a spoon you
need to hold the pan in the other hand
so you can roll it round else it's that
fight it starts to cook as soon as it go
then stop
so what determines our cred is it the
recipe or how thick your baby recipe is
this the door go flip flip straight no
both sides this is a glorious looking
bang cake yeah yeah no no you need to
flip it over there you have to do both
sides
no I told you know CPR CPR okay
oh no it's Oh No no fail that's good
it's good
saved it watch okay so my soldiers died
you don't listen
that's so much potential as well
regardless of what just happened there
it's still gonna taste good
that's a good looking pancake let's go
call it panky let's call it it's a
good-looking folded CREP
it's a pre-folded crap wait what's this
what's that's that what's that step you
didn't tell me I could do that yo that
is a technique what's that about
oh yeah you you lose Maxim s yeah I'm
not gonna talk smack that looks pretty
good now that's my pocket oh no your gas
is turned off so because yours is
teenagers gonna be ready to flip sooner
yeah
Oh get lost Alan no pressure

that's two fails nailed it the job yeah
good job

double flip
Lydia let's have a competition
reveal plate number whichever as two
ladies and gentlemen this is play eight
let's decide to play a oh pretty good
luck your pancake the set feel the
detail that feels good
nice and thin beautiful not a lot of
folds in it so pretty depressing and all
that but let's reveal number two or
number B or whatever it is whoa
look at that have you ever seen a
pancake like not even cooked with so
many folds in it you pour your oil not
on your skin yeah why can't you see that
what is wrong when you just wasted by
say that save it save it
ah I can't believe I did that I just
shuffled the pirate just yeah because it
means just come in here it don't need
folded in on itself
yeah but I thought it was that gluts
with that it wouldn't move any judgment
yeah put a cream egg on it you know one
that's wrong thinking why don't you know
any massage come on well one BIOS that
you missed that last time I'm hoping
that the air gets in between the gaps I
can still see what you told you though
Tom both sides yeah but you didn't do
that
hey old eggs trying again how to melt
chocolate ball full of boiling hot water
with another bow inside it and then pull
the egg in it that's pretty good

guys know like when I've been talking
about me like oh bloody my vlog and
editing it take him for absolutely ever
well I realized something that this new
program that downloaded I always I
always said it my vlogs with Sony Vegas
but I got the latest one Sony Vegas 15 I
was rendering the video in the wrong
setting and look at this the video is
gonna be finished in 17 minutes so all
those times where I was like oh no my
video was gonna take hours to render and
I was surrender I knew something didn't
seem right with it he's because I was
rendering in the wrong sane they were
still like 1080p 60fps but I was doing
it in the wrong sane so it was taking
like hours to complete the video rather
than 20 minutes of video I'm an idiot
I absolutely love this do not try this
with dogs not convinced so the title
book what is it dangerous dogs deadly
ducks ducks will take over the world we
must feed dogs to keep them friendly
that seems like a pretty good tag
socialblade may not agree but I'm
telling you it is let's go stop this day
I've already started it let's start this
day properly if we would have just built
it like a bit more perfect know that it
wasn't perfect +1 perfect +1 it would
have stayed up and he would still be
alive but instead it's just a pile of
remains lit up and their defender here
and defended their hell yeah okay how
much what are you doing I can see you I
just can't express how much pride it
gives me to see another defender the
same is right now that looks absolutely
amazing
Morton chocolate tree oh what a
well-made Trafford Centre is absolutely
but more importantly and cuttingly my
mum and sister are here because the
whole point of coming here was to find a

Trafford Centre with my sister to get a

professionals at turning up as the film
starts goes like the judo hotels like
it's got half an hour trails if it's
IMAX but yeah we're going scene we're
going we're going seeing black panther
prepare for a very honest review by the
way very honest there's a large
controversy about whether this film is
good or not and I'd like to say that I'm
a good craic when it comes to movies
especially the Marvel Universe cuz
you've seen them all and people listened
to me so prepare yourselves loads of
people walking out of the Black Panther
IMAX movie now unfortunately we missed
I'm actually it sucks but everyone's
walking out of it now like talking about
and I'm like no no no don't listen to
listen we got finished with the film and
I know you can't see shit even though
Weis had just turned on but I definitely
have mixed opinions about this movie
Oh perfect that professionalism hey man
is everybody loafers em boney like ball
what did you give it out of 10 I think I
give it a 5 I think the story line was
put like boring like really boring
it was so crap like once you watch it
you understand how it's just so
pathetically put together like it really
is stupid like it's just made of stupid
decisions gadgets were cool the actors
were amazing but everything like that
was working but the storyline and just
chill on that were just notified 5 out
of 10 if if that the movie was bad and
the post-credits scene that both of them
were terrible oh no Hahn's you said look
you make like literally not even tired
in the slightest having you on my back
whatsoever
nope that was more hardware for you to
stay on me that it was to carry yeah so

Ashton is I see as anything and my road
