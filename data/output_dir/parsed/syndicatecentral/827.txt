okay doesn't like a penis no I am 100%
getting in this yes there was a reason
why I brought my swim shorts for this
right here Oh nature I love you
this is incredible honestly on the last
day I'm really tempted to skinny dip
into that and then dive straight back
out towel get changed and just go for a
run to warm up I know it's a terrible
idea but it being cool remembering you
see this rock face behind me you can see
these people up there see him that's
what we're going to be climbing probably
rupture sure if we're gonna climb it now
later but we're gonna be climbing it
sweet and the kids out in his element
right now like I've always loved the
outdoors my dad trained me well and
obviously like the idiot child that I am
now on the inside I'm obviously climbing
on top of rocks most likely abouts
following I did make a bet with everyone
like thousand dollars that I would be
the first one through the fall in the
water get salt wet through or do
something stupid so I'm off to a pretty
good start and I want to feel how cold
the water is by not falling in it but
that one right there is like at a
Russian Olympic athlete archery and
we're about to she's about to teach us
some Lara Croft Tomb Raider archery
skills well if you found is it deadmau5

I'm usually just a meet you guys are
used to seeing and it's a vegetable
sandwich

bridge in the world but fuck it we
survived wait where sure what one one
