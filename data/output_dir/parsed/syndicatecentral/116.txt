that was good timing we unfortunately
had to brush away from Luke and Brian
because they took forever like checking
into a hotel and constantly far
everywhere that we've now got drawn me
up with Tim and Lisa to go to an ice bag
get some drinks or whatever so let's get
on his train ah-yi much love and respect
to the people in our armed services love

cocktails he arranged to go into the ice

cheap but I didn't think it would be so
cold I know it's in a nice bar but I

we're gonna get the train on home it's
like right about this time the point of
the night everyone's got like Call of
Duty early this might sound really
wittle but everyone's got a call of duty
lit so they're all like streaming it and
posting it early and I'm just like
that's cool that you know early but the
embargo is not until midnight tonight so
it would be nice to go home and stream
the game the first time
ever ever ever ever ever but people are
just doing it so you know what they're
doing it it is what it is it would be
nice for everyone to have like the
college Yui fresh start everyone starts
at the same time but if you're not gonna
do it
they're not gonna do it whatever did you
have a nice night
what happened there you go
you know it's weird like I carry myself

I shaved y'all even though he's tryna
make out now like you I will never do

I'm growing my facial hair and I've
never shaving it off ever
and how old do I really look now like
this face if I walk to July 17 I said 17
as well
oh yeah oh so yeah my I had some shaved
after my girlfriend's trying to get rid
of me so
shit happens I guess you don't look
lucky Argentina goes from like New York
and might Nepal the smiling
right we were just talking to these
people about like how old I look and
they're like oh you know you look like
17 and this one guy was like but then
one person was like oh yeah 22 23 years
to buy that book I agree with the
seventeen-year-old statement I feel like
I look 70 years over she said he said
she said 27 and I went what
27 without facial and then with facial
hair she said I was 36 how nice was that
talking to random people at a blast by
the way the train was delayed like 15
minutes we made me sad try now
young lady you're not totally rushing to
get the train home we've got to get from
here to Green Park
we're impact a Victoria Victoria to
Houston than Houston to Manchester if we
can somehow wait like there's a push
yeah yeah that's like a pimped-out push
that looks like hey so we're now gonna
try and jump on the train both of these
no delays the train that we jumped on
was like delayed by 10 meters that
slowed us down so if we got the train
get to where we need to go over we're
gonna absolutely sad if not we miss that
train home and lose 200 quid all right
leave us to rub butter up the road this
is zero there's no good sir what's wrong
what's wrong
yeah why was I saying Buster Road and
we're already then okay okay way too
hard we run we read okay so we got four
stops should take us eight minutes which
trains get to next time carry on
traveling
nailing the timing nailing it early shit
we just rushed there I got here as fast
as I could it's rigged my stops they're
so dry down here
my lips are sticking to my teeth
oh my god
I'm ready are you ready to run
we cannot miss this train go go Bo
headin straight do something I can
this train if I do train
there's run out we're at Warren Street I
used to get enough and with two minutes
to catch a plane
otherwise we rushed but we missed it
partially so because the train was
delayed that we came on I've now got to
tell them that we were delayed train
that slowed us down so hopefully I could
speak to someone telling them from where
we came from of how we got daily trains
so I don't expect a refund or Cialis
give us we would have made it if the
Train wasn't delayed that we were on but
we start now cuz Google Maps that would
be fine anyway we thought we'd make it
but we didn't make it however we showed
the guy our tickets he could check on
his schedule in that there was actually
a train delayed and went yeah okay so he
gave was like what for that the next
think it's done the nine o'clock train
that would have been like two hundred
quid down the line so next up Manchester
Piccadilly clock on 12 a little bit a
bunch of upset tonight but we made it
all year we've got two first-class
tickets so trying to find hopefully T
sheets that have even taken made it we
didn't we didn't we didn't but we did so
