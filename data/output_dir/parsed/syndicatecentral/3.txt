Oh home sweet home but there's no
kitties that's right there's no kitties
where along the kitties written out
let's be like mom dad mom dad we poot
everywhere but it's a frosty day in
England me and Lydia have a total amount
of journey
did you enjoy Hong Kong ah I had an
absolute blast but as you can see it's
cold it is now currently three o'clock
in Hong Kong so I need to change that
time but it's like 7 a.m. in England so
I'm home and it's time to get this day
started I guess yeah yeah my dad's
installed my my I had my coffee machine
does he feel that I feel that we wore
and everything whoa no more bitch a
Starbucks for me I get I get is this
some meant to be better is that
placeholder or think you might die in
there now I can have me cappuccino oh
wait one it's not cappuccino is it
chocolate sheet chococheese no caramel
and a chakra Chino normal chakra Gino
what a very nicely gift ah well this
room's nice and hot seems I left my PC
on for an entire week whilst I was in
Hong Kong
alright you now have five seconds to get
ready to get free xbox live membership
for 14 days 3 2 won't go boom there's
your first code if you can redeem that
fast enough it's just boom next there's
your next code if you can redeem that
that's all yours you know what another
one wait can you even see that one yep
know why it's called outside so he wants
to go outside stay indoors with this
code you know you got more Xbox Live few
faces focus and that was the conclusion
of Tom giving away two free months xbox
live membership
yeah this is why this off is nearly
clean in it I've gone through my office
so you know I'm always like oh my god
pros not charged up charged well there's
three goddamn GoPro cables I'm getting
there everything is looking cleaner but
it's now time unfortunately to remove
these speakers now these speakers are
absolutely amazing but as you guys saw
I've got the razor ones and there's
nothing wrong oh no the Rays they're
better than the Rays one's bought I've
kind of always had these ones since I've
had my gaming setup and they've been
absolutely amazing but for some reason
now when they go over a certain level
they're just kind of like partly that
crackle too much so
I've now always got plugged in the USB
for a GoPro and like a battery packs all
things so I show the end of it so I
should be always ready to rock and roll
like whenever I need your camera makes
me feel good another reason it's looking
good is because as we all know human
beings is if you can't clean one room
well simply make another one messier but
to be fair I've organized it so yeah
it's a shit tip and you need to like
give it away auctioning off charity that
sort of stuff but until then I've
organized it nice and neatly I've got my
controls got my headphones like cables
and shit shit bass it's my shit light in
screen more screens bags all sorts of
shit Harry Potter ones I don't know I'm
just gonna close this door and never go
in there basically Lydia go inside of
your room tidy your room I'm getting
doing you go get that doing going deep

but I came back I got my office clean
the moment I got my office clean
i sat down play for like God w really
awesome gameplay actually I've got it
already edited and ready to render to
get uploaded to the youtubes so if that
video comes out when this vlog goes up
or prior or similar time they'll be a
link in the description for it
nonetheless if you guys want to go check
it out you do come forward slash
syndicate gaming channel making a fuckin
return what then oh my god I'm covered
in cat hair with these drums and salt
and pepper crisps and a roast chicken
bacon sandwich oh boys I'm absolutely
devastated I'm actually like I could
was crying out yeah I managed to secure
one victory today I was like yes and I
was like right edited it all sorted out
and then play it again got loads of epic
clip and the double your nose like yeah
recorded all of the without gameplay
audio so what I'm gonna have to try and
do is get another win and in that win
talk about how I secured another
previous win and then kind of like
showcase some clips between it hopeful
that does end up being too boring so
yeah I see kitty cat boxes what oh did I
see a cat down the words that were on it
Luna V hello look up you looked well
spooked okay okay oh my god I've missed
so low that you definitely missed him on
yeah look at it right up in the grill oh
hello hey are you doing
Tommy's not back yet no he's still in
Hong Kong yeah if you if you want to
climb over the fence now just climb over
the gates broken if you climb it you'll
get in can you climb it granddaddies tom
push the gate
push the gate you don't need to be that
like I said been back in the country no
hours yeah and look easy yet
you're right geezer good morning alright
he's at Holly's my girlfriend my
girlfriend she has her name Lydia
hello we survived time we did 12 hour
journey only 12 hours and Lydia said she
bought some salt and pepper chicken
she's bought gammon oh my god yes salt
and pepper chicken
oh yeah in all the years you've been in
it you said you've not been in that
bathroom before yeah
you better not be losing that bloody
mind of yours what do you just say
you've got you got a Fendi wallet as
yours got eyes on it is it red oh yeah
the new Fendi a-line look at that first
thing he says is it's like mine boy
ultimate credit cards all the way around
around wrong way around
yep that's the one is it classes at what
I saw Marley a samurai samurai sword and
you know the deal with that is all right
I got that given to me as a gift and the
way it works is you've got to name about
it for about two years that's odd
oh yeah but you have to slice something
with it as like a ritual to name the
sword so right now the sword doesn't
really have a name but I have to slice
something and then it will actively take
that name so say if I slice this glass
it would be called glass or if I sliced
it like piece a grain of sand because
sand so I could cut you if you want I
could call it garden okay just checking

wanted to tell you I love you you know
