good morning will the car is running
prepped and to go doesn't have any fuel
a bit bought I've got everything in the
back we're starting the two-hour journey
to get to mount high again probably
gonna be late for the actual
snowboarding lesson so gonna have to put
our foot down on the pedal today
you ready snowboard you treat me well
and it's gonna make me slip and slide
cuz it's a brand new board it's so badly
hope that you guys can one see them one
that you guys could see the mountains
which look absolutely beautiful book two
can you see that like thick smoke
remember oh no is the fire down there
no that's the smog like the pollution
from all the cars meeting the fresh air
how disgusting is that but nonetheless
we're heading to the mountains let's go
this guy's carrying a boat
with him what the
well we're on track I've made it to the
snowy town of mountaintop or something
but either way I've made it to this
place which is really good we're on
track or on time it's only quarter past
twelve and yeah I've got a great drive
here then super smooth and it felt super
fast so great success you have made of
boys here we are
well I parked it yesterday so I can't
see why I won't be able to park in now
well the cat's much quieter than
yesterday I mean the day before it was
absolutely packed last time but here we
are the base survived again Anna Suzy
can't you just slip on major ice next
time I've kind of come up we can we saw
just talking throw it down but let's get
the toys out what's up boys and girls
there we go we've got boots we got a
board but these attached we've got
everything so it's time to get changed
and get shredding some gnar I've got
half an hour until the lesson starts so
get up there pay for lesson get
done so let's get this day style also
side note I forgot my mount for my GoPro
so bollocks I was gonna try and get on
video this guy over here he's drifting
around the carpark
putting the boots up this is me assuming
he's doing it again please come on come
on do it do it do it do it you
ready for it
that's drifting I've ever seen in my
life to attend Tokyo Drift style all
right we're here we add it I am
definitely the most uncoordinated cool
it first it here
but I've now decided instead of going
doing a like group lesson like I did
last time
one person capsule arm is down on the
group I would probably spend out the
hour and 45 minute session we've always
been about 30 minutes that way doesn't
one so I've paid for a two hour private
lesson today so and hopefully these
polarized lens like like all the shadows
like shred it down and hopefully I
didn't get out camera but Greg what do
we just do this is guy he's like 1 or
10,000 and I'm not even beat us and we
just went to the top of conquest it's
the second day very very rare very
intuitive very brave he's a warrior he's
finding warrior my replacement
Greg honestly thank you so much that was
that was amazing that was honestly so
damn good I came here two days ago to
learn what learn all about this and Greg
is doing exactly that
Greg and Hannah from day one thank you
so much I cannot wait to go and rest cuz
my feet are killing me get some drinks
in me I can't get my kite cuz I connect
him up and connected just sin as hell
and just doing it I need
we top which one do we got - we did so I
did Carinthia twice and then approaches
them twice and wow it's fun difficult at
first like throughout the day bro
come on I just really want to get to
 smash it
I just just gonna be in the zone and
concentrate so lucky pods coming back
out here in a few days come on the first
day this entire cat fight was busy and
now it's just my car on its own I have
to apologize for no GoPro footage but
honestly guys rather than around
my camera all the time I'm concentrating
I'm learning how to snowboard and as
soon as I get like one more lesson in me
or like the next time I come which I
think he's giving next Monday then and
then we shall we shall tread the nah I
go with a GoPro I brought it with me but
I just didn't have the mounts because we
got around that much yesterday
going from store to store to store to
store try to just get snowboarding gear
I forgot the simplest of things which
was honest to god you know them sticky
mats that come with a GoPro that I don't
have any in my apartment so that stopped
us from doing it but as soon as I get
better I'll like get my next lesson in
me and bring the sticky mud pad
door be absolutely shredded look at my
hair how like a potato but nonetheless I
got a two hour drive back it's probably
a good time to set off before traffic
gets too brutal in LA otherwise anything
after that it's gonna be killer because
don't forget is a two hour drive from
everyday there and two hours back so
cannot stress enough like if you want to
go do something just do
everything in your power to get up and
do it if you haven't already if you want
to get fit go out workout if you wanna
do this want to do that do everything if
you want the money to be able to go and
do get a job grind hard save save
save save save I'm going get it done but
 you know this was so worth the
decision to give no crazy skyline
tonight but we might see a pretty nice
sunset on the way back so that's raw
didn't hear you if you're related
to them crows in England you can
 off I'm gonna say I'm gonna check
my check my rubbers on my windows just
in case these come over

their relations are like they've
flown all the way from England to
migrate to here to piss me off you can

didn't have the change for the $100 he
only had 60 instead of giving me over it
he's gonna drive back to his restaurant
get the right change and bringing me
back okay it was a $42 meal yeah that's
about $40 and food I'm gonna save it
like a week for 40 dog food I said give
me 50 you can take $8 for tip just be
nice and he's like I have to go to a
restaurant so let's see let's see if
Jack comes back no this food is that
 good what restaurant is it it's
not advertised I would advise this and I
would even pay $100 this food right now
it's that good
Jack who is actually the owner the
manager and a driver is a legend oh yeah
salt and pepper Oh piece
distillation for some pepper chicken
pieces holy
on a bed that was good the world needs
more people like you jack not only do
you make great food you're a good person
but a legend so he came back in
he gave me two twenties and two fives
now I know he went all the way back for
$10 but the fact that you went all the
way back and brought with nobody back I
gave him an extra $5 so he got a
dope ass tip out of me but it's just
like just to encourage people to be more
like jack guys be more like Jack Jack is
a good guy jack is the homie tonight was
not good on CS Cola oh we lost a lot of
knives I had 30 and I'm down to ten a
good amount of ten so I'm gonna go to

the I'm joking I'm gonna tell you what
exact over this oh come on you do it I
wanted to cover that up just cover it up
like explain why the sink so is so full
just in case everyone keeps messaging me
like oh I'm tired of your
apartment like it's usually tidy all
right the fact that I've got all this
snowboarding gears cuz I've literally
bought snowboarding gear for example and
the fact that I've always been out
snowboarding means I've had time to wash
the dishes and fact I have been out done
to wash the dishes is because I haven't
bought a new washing machine yeah and
