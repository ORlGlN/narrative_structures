good morning everybody in the world it's
time to get rid of a controller yeah I'm
signing up today by throwing away my
Xbox controller and gaining gaining and
gaining a brand new Razer Wildcat oh yes
I'm packing them bags again I did think
I had everything side last night apart
from a laptop like so I'm gearing up
ready to go bags pack clothes already
and I'm about to order my bear to get me
to the airport I've probably got about
an hour and a half before I fly probably
leaving a little bit too late but time
to go to Texas it's gonna be a bit
warmer than LA and we made it to the
airport my gate opens in 20 minutes and
I'm gonna hope that with my speedy
boarding ticket on my phone I can pretty
much just walk straight through so wish
me luck well now I have seen everything
we walking down the tunnel of life this
is where the peasants get on the
carriage and then they fly to another
location
not sure why I just refer to all humans
as peasants but I don't know I'm on the
catwalk to the location Texas aka San
Antonio holy shit it is hot on this
playing
swak I would only find a flight I
decided to get a key box see what's
inside it slices of beef
mario's preset
changing the game
and
made it
Oh mom it is hot in Texas very calm just
like that um it's my hotel going
dropping my stuff in the room and I
found out there's a spire in the hotel
so I might go and get body massage and
just feel super relaxed and good no
let's go check out the room first
oh my god this is one weird design of a
hotel this is trippy as followed she'd
think as a swimming pool and I would
totally gonna get in it but no that's
definitely not a swimming pool that's
just a decoration feature and we have a
look around here and there is the bar
where I shall receive all my alcohol I'm
not gonna lie you gave me a bit of a
shock that I was like they sent someone
to my room I was like that's a bit
surprising this is fixing my tap it is
time for a hotel room - welcome to my
Hyatt win net how do you know it is
welcome this is I 20 this as fast as I
can we have a buff
not anything crazy shower and a nice
marathon my face to prepare my hair
every morning inside this cupboard we
have and all that safe I am cupboard
sick bedroom well it's all the bedroom

walked in I was like why the hell you in
my room like what the fuck is going on
but he was just fixing the top got nice
TV look it says it says welcome mr. tom

pretty damn if t Oh sick I get a free
keyboard and mouse okay I'm gonna keep
that so razor I'm leaving you for room
links incorporated
my apologies bought amazing you that
what a future down there is so damn nice
I really like that and then the the
creme de la creme to test whether or not
this room is a good good rating so far
I'd give this room about probably a 6.5
and let's test the bed oh that's pretty
hard we're saying staying at 6.5 yep the
room gets a six point five out of ten
hoorah

oh my god this place got so busy so
quick hello hello everybody hello no one
went back to me either way I'm gonna get
in a back massage ha that's spa that's
what I'm gonna try and go let's hope
