British Airways check-in desk let's go
before the check-in desk went crazy I
mean like you're late I was like no I'm
here an hour before my flying like J
supposed to be an hour and a half I was
like uh when did this happen it was like
we changed the timing of it
last week I was like oh I don't know so
anyway I just went through security and
bumped into a fan but because I was
thought I was in a rush I had to like
kind of ignore him and bounce
wait I'm putting this guy in the vlog
cuz he just totally freaked out wasn't
lying and I saw you I saw you looking
good way to read watch so there you go
oh you caught me whilst yeah I am you
compromise I was just getting the good
stuff the crack cocaine for the flight
so what surely I keep bumping into so
many people lost I'm trying a blog it's
awesome love me you guys trust me if you
ever see me I don't look too busy please
always come and say hello all the time
in the world for you unless I'm rushing
through secure accepted some funds as I
went through security I felt really bad
that I couldn't talk to him so I'm
looking for him but couldn't find them
so I'm sorry well this definitely is a
first rather than going along that
platform to get on the plane I'm walking
outside the plane to get on it
that's a little bit strange finally on
the plane I take you back very tired
very feeling like foolishly ill both of
them that I'm somebody we're leaving the
one time is gorgeous okay with this
article Alice they still make these
chocolate cookies I'm gonna trying for
the first time never up this one so
fingers crossed it tastes good it's just
like what you're doing so we were there
for and I'm gonna throw you in the vlog
all these look over here recognize me
from being on a plane wait and these
these lot told you about me and now you
want me to be in your snack yes
best day ever I'm gonna see if these
cookies are actually any good in not me
no hmm you are right no amazing these
sunglass isn't absolutely scratched to
shit like I was like a fuse that started
filming him so I'm gonna try and find a
new pair right now okay Oakley what have
you got which pair have they got in
stock that I do not own I don't think
anything bullshit they didn't have any
brand new ones in stock so I'm just
sticking with these ones for now and
they're sneaking upstairs to the other
Oakley shop to see if you've got any
better ones in there so fingers crossed
they do oh my god they've changed the
layout I'm in heaven it's severely
disappointed right now I can't find a
new pair of oh please that takes my
tickle of pickle fuck
so this is the phone pack I usually use
but oh my god zebra or what a version of
it so I'm totally thinking of getting
this and giving this a go this might be
a really good idea a really bad idea
time to see how much of a bad idea this
is this what the case looks like pretty
much identical to it more importantly it
charges the phone as well you guys
remember when I went on the jet ski I
broke my phone hopefully that will never
happen again
me she just went I need to go to gate 62
my legs so and they said yeah sure
next time I see one of them I look like
I've gotta buy back gate for bar see if
he'll take me to him nearest bar should
just give me $20 and see if you let me
go there right now
I need a drink so relaxed right now it
is a gorgeous day in London look it out
so damn nice so damn nice I'm gonna be
stuck in a plane for the entirety of the
day I just want to get out in the Sun in
Sun vein I'm going to Los Angeles I
could do it there but I don't know what
nevets never saw anything it's like I'm
missing out
as always I'm gonna check his books ah
sorry these books are in the charts over
here let's go find out
I have managed to find zoella oh I can't
see anyone else there can't see anyone
else
ah ah there if we go over here there's
Alfie's I'm sure there's someone else oh
yeah there is Marcus's book found them
all all right boys the gate is boarding
let's get ready to rock and roll
yes they have some of this at the
airport I need to try and smuggle this
back to America yes perfect they never
have any of that in any shops in Los
Angeles so I basically buy it here at
the airport smuggle it to the US and I
could spike my hair up like a hedgehog
hey there is a fire on my favorite plane
me okay so this time I'm not flying
business class I'm flying
Premium Economy so not sure I've done
this one week but we'll have to check
out it is and I think you actually get
like a pretty nice a meal so definitely
give that rating out of 10
we're also on the second floor of the
plane so
actually before I also have a window
seemed so hopeless his Natasha on the
window like icebergs now that was so
good is so cold on this fly that got
like three one kids and I'm gonna put my
Jack you want to try and sleep or I've
got eight hours left of the flying I
just watched Magic Mike yes the male
stripper focuses on the first one it was
one of the worst girls I have ever seen
in my fucking life either way I'm gonna
try go to that hamster actually don't
nothing it was the major feeling today
fuck yes the queue isn't long off of the
shuttle and think maybe 20 minutes
whew just like that for more security we
check Oh Pereira yes thank God I don't
ever have to check a bag no checking
bags no cueing walk straight out LAX
Airport smells like a tainted ass crack
papa
honking fluid I am back at the apartment
building and this pile of roundabouts is
still growing either way I made it home
five minutes of being back into LA in my
apartment and I'm already drinking a
naked-eye feels good to be home
oh I could not think of a better place
to be right now I totally wish on that
fly over that I was in business class so
I could lay down in a bed it would have
been so damn nice
however sick of watching Netflix on my
damn what Zima called laptop so I think
this week we're gonna go shopping for a
unit at a television for here like a
big-ass TV I'm thinking like another
7870 inch TV so I think so he just
watched fucking Netflix all day and all
night
that sounds like a plan mistake 101 I
fell asleep at 9 p.m. and woke up at
11:55 a panic thinking it was loving 55
the next day and I was late to the film
shoot by the way my hair looked awesome
I'm saying that I actually need to be up
for nine o'clock because I'm going to
the YouTube space filming so I'm gonna
pass out like a tad KitKat but I just
wanted to always remind you guys that
20th of February if you guys want to get
a syndicate Rijal limit edition sure if
you've never had one before get part of
the high producing original collector
and you'll be able to grab one on the
20th alright throw me on sale for one
day this t-shirt once it's like out and
sold it's never been sold again so if
you want to collect it get it and that's
pretty much that so I've gotta fall
asleep I still feel really really
terrible at shit Lee L in this phone
case you know what proof case that upon
it I've seen the big downside what the
hell I had a nosebleed what I can't see
any blood on a pillow this one up I look
like I've had a nosebleed during the
night that's weird
either way this case is a cool concept
it's great for being waterproof and
stuff but if you guys can hear me when I
end the clip all you might want to start
recording I click stop and you see me
tap the screen that makes like a tapping
noise and you can really hear it like
bang on like an echo a nose on the
microphone some reason so really not fun
enough so I might literally only use
this case if I'm gonna say snowboarding
or snowmobiling
surfing our jet ski hey guys looking I
was gonna ramble in that amount of time
just to see jet skiing but I know guys I
mean look about so thank you very much
for watching I hope you've avoid and
void enjoyed my fluey feeling ill vlog
