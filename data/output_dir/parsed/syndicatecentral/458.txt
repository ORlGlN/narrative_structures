amazing gift in itself but all this
awesome customized gear so thank you
very much but there is one last thing to
open it says take good care of him
Samantha Maxis I haven't actually opened

expect but let's go open okay we got a
card in here we've got a card it says
Kelly babe stuff so if you guys want to
read the details and go and check it out
where to get it there you go
pretty it is pretty cool this must be
for a long time today but what is it oh
snap hahaha take good care of him she's
got a little mystery box teddy bear like
reading that like one of them beauty
guru people that way I'll do it so here
you can see I've got a teddy bear kind
of bird kind of damaged looking
beautiful but that is so cool is so
awesome what an amazing collection of
things to send me Kelly thank you very
much I did see you tweeting at me saying
you were gonna send him here so I was
like when's it gonna get any when's it
gonna get here and I finally received it
I was like that's job and she did say
that she's got something else that she's
made and she sent us that as well so I'm
really really excited to receive that I
love getting everything for you guys a
lot of people do send me letters and I
read through all of them I don't
necessarily put them all in the vlog
because a lot of people like say please
read it in the vlog but then the letters
like 10 pages long but something so it
just makes no sense because that last
time I like read a letter through night
something like to announce minutes to
read and when you look in the analytics
if you use videos like it shows like
when people are watching when I started
reading whatever just when me the
attention span of goldfish you guys have
I also like to point out that I supposed
to do an unboxing thing of the rockstar
gear but there's a rockstar top that's a
top that's a top that's a top there's
more swag and there's more swag oh and
there's the rest of this work because my
drunk friends and I all thought it'd be
a great
to open the Rockstar swag and put all
the stickers on the wall so the sticker
walls begun which is a great thing but
also it kind of ruined my unboxing video
from Rockstar unless I can find
everything put it back in the back in
the in the in the bag because I was too
drunk to remember what the hell we even
took out of it it may make sense so
we'll just have to wait and see let's
just don't put one thing what is this
May with security I'm just going to go
off I'm going to off the bat and a
shootin this oh shit
sorry about that without going any
further I was going to say I'm pretty
assuming this is a mug because of the
box and Todd out is Mayweather security
nice that's actually a nice goddamn book
nice matte black I like it you know what
that I actually like that matte mug that
much that I might ask
Alice syndicate original to start
selling syndicate original custom mugs
and what we could do is have it all
matte black and then when it heats up it
heats up and shows the syndicate logo
they have Sicard that they ahh or we
could do a black mug with a civic
original logo in it and then when it
gets hot I'm like a dope-ass pan around
it appears that be pretty sweet another
weird thing that comes with it is this
the epsilon program now Joris I can't
even remember what this is I'm assuming
it's similar to do with the look the
campaign it's more laughs I really can
remember but it comes with a candle
which actually smells really fucking
good that's such a really nice and then
this which I don't understand at all
either it comes like a black but black
leather suede box but then it comes with
a glass triangle of the the absolute
program so everyone could tell me what
this is about them from a creepy Lex I
really really could not remember that
from the campaign sci-fi model every
master that I remembered that my
granddad left a package for me on my
gate um probably like 12 hours ago so
maybe I should go get it
my granddad couldn't wait like he was so
eager to turn up at my house to give me
this that I had three missed phone calls
of him and he call around my house at
like 9 o'clock in the morning to give it
to me and I was like what could it be
was like Tommy you need it it's
important like it's urgent to get it I
was like what could he be talking about
Lal got it still there
right this is going to be impressive
when I show you guys what this actually
is I'm going to play a game you want to
guess what it could be my going to gave
me leave a comment right now would be
five seconds and I'm gonna show you what
it is now don't forget my god said it's
life-saving and important take a guess
now if you guessed bicycle helmet you
guess correctly because my granddad said
Tommy I know you don't other helmet for
your bike and I'm giving you mine so my
gun dad gave me his biking helmet so I
say safe and don't die yeah Department
is very important in life seven so
granddad thank you did you necessarily
need to give it me at nine o'clock in
the morning debatable
five o'clock in the morning just
finished playing college you hear and
the reason why it's four o'clock in
morning right now is a double xp
oncology so I've done nothing but play
to get to the higher rank I could get to
them prestige so yep I played all damn
night since like I don't know maybe
eight o'clock till four o'clock in the
morning I've done nothing else and it's
just play called you you now I got no
food in my house I can't cook anything
like no super noodles left or anything
so I'm doing the next best thing of and
of course it was McDonald's I went
instead and I just bumped it I'm
throwing him in the vlog now because
this guy watches the vlogs and he was
like gonna be in and I said I said no so
just everybody know what I'm doing ha ha
ha
the food was great my bedroom now stinks
of McDonald's it is the next day and I
intend on live streaming ecology for all
damn day I actually mean Modern Warfare
remaster because what I'm gonna try and
do today is livestream all day in one
sitting
like no brakes play modern warfare
mustard and prestiging in one livestream
should be difficult should be tiring
should be annoying because playing video
games a special issue of video games we
get frustrated as tits for more than 12
hours straight is probably gonna want me
to punch myself in the testicles several
times but I'm gonna try and give it a go
today so I'm going to shower go to the
shop get a bunch of lucozade bunch what
a bunch of just like food and stuff I
just keep me going throughout the day
and then get rocking and rolling with
the stream so I want to say thank you

of letters or anything towards Christmas
