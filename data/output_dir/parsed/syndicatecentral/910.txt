guyliner cuz I've got pain like on my
eyelashes and shit but we're good we're
in the hood and I have now got you can't
read this properly but that says 400
minutes remaining
nearly that's eight that's the only it
like eight hours worth of time for that
video to get uploaded to YouTube and
that's the 500 he comes five hour
minecraft video that I did so I'm gonna

hopefully I'll be left for the YouTube
video but I'm gonna go and wash may be
showered and that sounds so wait but
look like you can clearly tell him we
can wear a makeup I can see it in my
eyes but I'm gonna get in bed cold today
a wrap I had an amazing time with relax
honestly I I really had an absolute
blast that she's such an awesome person
like great attitude like she's super
talented and I just that I really fuckin
enjoyed it like I got a lot of
opportunities to like oh I wanna
collaborate with this person to
incorporate that with that person it's
like well yeah it makes sense and maybe
I should do it with them it's more you
know reasonable for my like channel and
stuff like that but I just I just never
do it I've never have a real fucking
reason or passion to want to do it but
like when it came with a whole like age
you wanna you wanna get to go relax and
make a video I was just like yeah I do
because what she does he's like really
skillful takes a lot of time takes the
energy up and it requires a shitload of
talent so it's a Friday night it's only
just turn
clock in LA and I'm going to bed so that
is pretty much that and hopefully me and
Lex are gonna make another collab video
in the future if not do something more
epic that we spoke about so that's like
a secret thing hidden in there works you
have to wait and see what I hope you
