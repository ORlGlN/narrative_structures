he's going yeah oh the whole
family's going yeah Oh

Oh see do you more I used to hide these
from you used to go mad now you don't
even care if I steal them just move the
 Toma Road out the way yeah
we appreciate it but we don't need we
don't need any more lemon biscuits all
right I'm sure can we tell people about
this now what are we gonna do this this
was obviously in the talks last year
quite a lot but we got really busy with
other stuff but ladies and gentlemen
hand-signed mad insane quality we've
literally looked from so many different
companies to get the best quality poster
we can limit edition Gore posters of the
lies to Shaw make the most of it posters
what yeah I'm supposed to show too much
I'm coming soon like really soon and I'm
gonna hand sign every single one of them
to find that this isn't where you just
stick it up the wall not no signature I
mean just the same you gotta frame this
we're not styling with friends because
we don't have to ship rims but get
yourself a frame when these drop and I
want to see on the wall everywhere boom
as soon as I know more information I'll
let you know question for you question
for you well why do you think of the
hair long and flat well you think
would you prefer spiky
probably probably not like an amazing
example whatever but like it all is is
it just combed over a nice it is to wake
up every day and ask this back of your
hair but I should get actually I should
get it like trimmed in standby do I also
don't like peed if I was more session
like because this one was like perfectly
there but then that one was doing it
missing and then like the beard and
mustache doesn't grow in for sale yeah
I'm not getting me mustache very young
woman no no I'm not in Hong Kong and I
don't get to eat dim sum every damn day
which was a pleasure by the way and now
back to just having cheese sandwiches
boosted bars and not not a monster not a
coca-cola not a lucozade or anything
like that just a water I'm riding in an
hour so I think I'd like to be flesh
what problem and now I can play some
fortnightly you owe me I've ever done
them up pretty bad on this this is where
I follow my bike I swear this is where I
died this is where I died I'm riding on
my pedal bike in the snow but I've done
the math so so Paula here oh dress
myself I look look massive because I've
got a t-shirt on a thermal write my bike
in Jersey a hoodie and a coat to keep me
warm but what have I got on my legs
massive snowstorm nothing a pair of
shorts looks so special but I managed to
put the hood over my helmet to keep my
ears nice and warm cause my ears were
freezing but it is so ice-cold out but
look how beautiful the sky is oh my god
it's gorgeous
I've not yet crashed and I'm currently
trying to find my dad I'm trying to
catch up with him so if I think I keep
riding this way I should I should find
him this is legit my dad's trail I went
before looking for them I couldn't find
a bike path of sorry bike tracks so it's
like I mostly gone this way it turns out
you guys doing
let's go find him this is why my dad's
alleged he said meet me here he's not
here so he kept going so I can catch up
in that way myself into however I know
it's gone so anyways come on man you can
see well on camera
from the snowstorm look it looks so good
without the tarts look what okay the
storm truly came from behind us
absolutely crazy it's actually kind of
difficult to see to be honest oh it's
actually really difficult to cook to see
because my torch is lighting up the snow
in front of my face as I'm riding I
literally just can't see anything so
hopefully I won't crash into you as I'm
saying I can't see anything should
disappear they're almost gone already
hello oh here he comes riding through
the snow he's riding through the snow
he's just waiting for that to open the
gate for nearly veiled into my Dada we
were coming down a path did I see I
don't have my brakes what a slow dance
are nearly crushed it don't like her
magical on me say oh I'm glad I brought
my coat I almost didn't I almost didn't
bring my coat oh this is this is like
something Narnia look at the lights
this is this I truly feel like living
like a movie
I really it's cold out there
I've built a snowman on my head I didn't
even realize Xena
oh my god radiator is low you know I had
all that storm ailment sorry yep melting
all that
how's it gonna be wet oh no oh it's so
nasty so nasty all right so you defined
whether it's defending whether well it
turns out it is defended whether because
Lydia's stuck down at Mom's house and
she can't get up here because a car he's
obviously blocked in now I need to use
this device here to let me show ya
scrape this thick layer of top snow like
that off my entire Drive you know or on
Mount Kilimanjaro because if I don't and
I just attempt to drive straight on my
drive I'll most likely fall off the edge
because the ice the snow will compact
and I'll fall off the edge so what I've
got to do is clear this thickness of
snow from all the way off this drive the
entire way on the front of the drive so
I can go and get Lydia then drive up it
and hopefully be okay
that's how steep my drivers yeah mission
god dumb impossible whoo an hour later
seriously it took me an hour to clear
that 45 minutes later I've moved the
snow off the drive it's the best of my
ability
I've thrown the rest of the salt that we
had down I'm now going to tend to drive
my defender out of it and hopefully I
don't go off the edge and if you like
the defender he should be able to last
time I went up that hill with anything a
little bit of snow on it it lost grip
and started sliding as it was going up
the hill in 4x4 mode off into the trees
or nearly into my house the only way we
survived and didn't go crashing off
that's like a five foot drop there by
the way
the reason why we didn't go crashing
isn't because my dad ran over with this
piece of wood this this is the new one
the other one we broke and he shoved
underneath my tire my car found grip and
I managed to get out it's now even
colder even icier you should blow don't
even bother but Lydia needs rescuing
so I've got a try so if this is let's
take a good look and I shouldn't even be
saying this for camera reasons but this
is the defender in all its glory let's
hope it survives all right first things
first
wait but windscreen whiteford not
necessary
it windows hit front heated back yes
please
let's move a bit more of the snow whoa I
see but I can still see how it ok well
the engine up a little bit take this a
break but take the parking brake off and
attempt to get off that hill removing my
safety glasses put it into 4x4 mode
neutral and then all right mode you
doing you deaf bastard
you fell well nice to get up it
I think I did a pretty good job of
clearing that snow out what mate look at
the road I'm pretty goddamn Nally Road
and yeah it's pretty much all snowy and
icy so you know I'm a 4x4 I'm still
gonna take the time I rescued Lydia from
the dispense of a frozen road Lydia
there's your mobile phone there's your
phone
pass your mobile phone where is it I
just drove risking my life to save you
I'll be outside 2018 2018 who doesn't
take therefore it was at this moment
that Tom's mouth salivated oh my gosh
but since ham sandwich Marks and
Spencers salt and pepper chicken yeah
you know just lay there like that relax
meanwhile the cars driving panic attacks
you know you know I know well yes I'm
gonna train and if you can tell this
