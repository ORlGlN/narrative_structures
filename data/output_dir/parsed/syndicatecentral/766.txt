ladies and gentlemen it is the next day
and I am so drunk I'm not even hungry
yet because I'm still so drunk the
amount of alcohol we like we took in our
system which is way too high the number
one cure for a hangover is fast food and
this this is the best kind of fast food
I'm 20 years old it is a Saturday night
in Los Angeles and I'm currently sat
watching the Gini Jimmy Neutron movie
always wanted to watch is a kid on
Netflix
when I was growing up and I've just
found out it's on Netflix so I'm really
I'm pretty okay with us however hangover
is curing but I'm doing nothing for the
death of choice today is naked protein
juice smoothie I don't know if this is a
good thing after being hungover but it
contains one banana third of an orange
and a half apples hint of pineapple and
coconut
oh wait wait protein vitamin C and
potassium
okay smell test smells not too bad taste
no it's not good no oh well yeah let's
let's have a day of sitting on the sofa
and sobering up and the angel rolls off
at his light here we're going out so I'm
going to somewhere where I've always
wanted to go and we've got a table so
fuck my life I'll definitely say this it
could be worse I've got a built-in ice
massage it in this BMW chair which is
perfect good music and good times I'm
okay right now
I'm definitely okay however I look so
damn tired oh my god this ride gets
better and better I'm so glad I came out
and you argue moment gave me a glue
gave me my old sunglasses back yeah yeah
dude these are the my this is like my oh
geez we've made it where we're going
they do not serve food I am so fucking
hungry and it's a bad idea if I drink
right now so did this plate for my own
health and safety I managed to make it
to a piece of joint I ordered so much
fucking food I'm just gonna like bombard
my system with it and then head back to
the club like I don't even care if I
miss anything like you know no alcohol
can sway me over eating food right now
I'd like to thank my dad for this award
and more than anyone my mom for bringing
me into the world will say this is a
pretty good trophy to take
so in summary I would such a good night
out tonight it was great
my jacket is does not contain a bottle
underneath it but I'm at such a great
now the only one thing I have summarized
from LA tonight is women in LA here to
make money
I'm not saying prostitute no I mean like
there's a table next to us we enjoyed
all that and our great just like the
table next was this guy was like oh we
need more women at our table he was like
yes because you're like $1500 he paid
$1500 and like ten girls just came and
sat there and drank his room I was like
yeah I'm okay thanks I'll just drink on
my own and driving around and then meets
or but like it's just weird it's just
the atmosphere is just wave anyway so we
survived the my first night in one oak
this place fucking great night good time
I've now got to try and survive getting
home holy fucking shit the queue of
people
I have no idea what's going on but I got
to try and survive the night of a
getting away from here so fuck my life
that's good
end of the night how did you enjoy it
out of 10 out of 10 10 out of 10
seriously that's Evan Evan out of 10 I'm
gonna give it I'm actually gonna it was
it was it was really good but I did not
see Leonardo DiCaprio so it knocked off
an entire 2.5 sorry where was Drake you
know you know what fine it goes down to
a 7 I didn't see drink either oh my god
I'm about to be so real with you guys
right now if I don't get into my
apartment in the next 10 seconds I might
actually piss myself I've been holding
on to neither the toilet about an hour
now and it's not feeling good look at
this I saved it this is empty there's no
alcohol inside but I save this this
isn't like a 750 this is a $750 bottle
of champagne that I managed to borrow
from the club that we're out tonight I
was like oh my god they were about to
throw this away I was like mate this is
actually plated in gold with a gold
stamp on it I was like I'm just going to
borrow this though thank you put it in
my coat and walks away with it so don't
tell anybody
cute and wait as this is gonna sound you
want to know what just made my night
completely like 110 percent completely
just made my night I got back its 326 in
the morning and I just FaceTime my dad
and just caught up with him I got in at
2:00 o'clock and I've been on the phone
with my dad for two and a half hours
just catching up about everything and
life and all this other stuff for that
was really really nice and this is the
state of my apartment right now I've
gone through I'm literally gonna look in
the bin since I've got in speaking to me
down for an hour and a half I've drunk
three bottles of water took a
paracetamol just a sober up and all that
sort stuff because I'm not even that
drunk I will say this right now not even
that drunk even though I love this
jumper which I may be drunk to wear but
it's
whatever I'm just glad to be back and
safe and sound and all I want to do
right now all I want to do is sober up
so badly for tomorrow I don't want to
wake up with a hangover or feel any sort
of regret cuz all I wanna do tomorrow is
go snowboarding and absolutely tear up
the mountains I think that's all I want
to do it's gonna be a Sunday probably
gonna be kind of busy in LA but that's
what I want to do but I FaceTime with my
dad really got a dude I'm not spoke to
him for like I think like two weeks so
it's really nice to catch up with him
and I'm just really appreciative of the
relationship I ever may not want to have
because a lot of people you know they
say they don't speak to the dads I don't
get along with the dogs and all that
sort of shit so I had a great
conversation with him and yes by the way
you might be like wow Tom you look so
good I can actually rather to be like
this hi hey cuz that's not how it
usually looks but I literally have and
you ready for this I have got the KC
nice that sell this was not even the
plan for this by the way this took me
like a year to find well the phone is
about to pop out already
look I'm gonna put an angle see see on
this I'm trying to show you this on this
oh my god the inset oh my god the
inception real but on the side of this
see this mount this like pushes the
phone out to fall out the case or the in
or whatever but this is not trying to be
a KC setup I'm not trying to do this at
all I will never agree with it not
because I don't like KC because it's
KC's thing I'm leaving it to be for him
too many people copy him you know like
oh my god Casey Rick my little break let
me show you I put this in this just for
the sake of it I was talking to my dad I
need a big amount this is my rig look
how small this is this is like as big as
my little finger sort of rig so I got a
miniature KC set up but my whole thing
is going out on a night out take my
phone put it in my pocket and I'm good
to go I don't have to worry about mounts
or getting in or not being allowed to
film so I bought shout out to or is it
shout out to the gorilla legs of the
world I'm going to bed now guys
let's move that because it looks kind of
weird I went to bed so hope you guys
have enjoyed tonight's shenanigans this
has been a three-minute segment of me
talking about random Shabbat it's been
great I managed to steal this well it's
we did steal we paid for this we paid
for a ball but the fact that I have a
bottle of this in a walked glass
cupboard in the UK I was not okay with
them just throwing it in the bin they
were literally gonna take this and throw
it in the bin I was like can I take that
they were like no but then the waiter
was like but if you put it under your
jacket and walk out with it you're good
so I was like safe and just walked out
so it was definitely worth it either way
great night definitely glad I went out
rather than just sitting around the
apartment all night hope you guys have
