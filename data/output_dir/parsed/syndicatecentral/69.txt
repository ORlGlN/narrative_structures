it's too much I've actually been dying
to work out what this is oh it's oh wow
it's a swaggy Santa Claus with a big old
cake I was gonna say a big old sack book
nope
not like that oh yeah look at this place
it's almost like I've been here 6 times
before but let's try and grab a quick
slice of pizza before I have to head
home and hope that where I parked my car
fingers crossed that attendant actually
worked there so for the ticket that I
actually bought was a real ticket and
I'm not getting a fan on my castle we'll
see Oh goddamn good looks ok I'm good
actually you know what I think I'm gonna
go first oh I left oh no not so well
Zola Sonos you see that guy with a grey
hair there where I'm playing I went to
pay from a pizza but it was a it was
cash only and I only had a card I don't
have to quit I was like I said to the
guy in the glasses are to quit I can't
pay for it and he was like oh no it is
it's Christmas you can have it then the
people next day we went Dory mate will
will buy you the slice of heat so Merry
Christmas and also oh shit Thanks so
they've obviously I think slice of pizza
for Christmas oh it's so nice luckily
cast away it's still working the reason
why I was acting like so like confused
as to what's going on suspiciousness
about this car park is if you've ever
watched the real hustle you'll see
there's a guy over there great key who's
wearing like a high vis but who's to say
that he owns or runs dis car pie
you fired quid for every single person
to back off see there was actually a
park attendant who was supposed to go
around ticket and he just went up to ten
people that quit was like yeah I'll take
your money yeah thank you money then
that guy's pocket 50 quid
so like this guy had no identification
on him to say that he was the guy who
was taking care of this parking like
section so I was like if you got any
validation can I get receipt off your
anything I was like no you park here or
you don't
I haven't got a parking ticket my car
still here so I have a parcel don't know

few collections and stuff but what I'm
tempted to do is for the characters that
I just like I don't know of like like
this entire shelf I don't know all right

to me but I might auction them off for
charity someone gave me an auction off
for charity and then put ones on the

added thing but yeah a silicone quote

actual detail of the the print whoever
drew this mad props not too sure what
this one is
