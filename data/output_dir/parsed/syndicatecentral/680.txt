overnight so excited took RIT's business
class gap bad fall asleep on a plane
perfect okay kind of run when I bought
my ticket and upgraded they do like ok
we cannot serve your meal on the plane
but we can do is give you a ticket for
an invite for a meal in the airport
lounge which is what I've done
so get free drinks free food which can
eat anyway but apparently it's like a
proper course meal so let's take a look
this is our options we've got soup
salads we've got potatoes and salmon and
whatever whatever what is this oh they
cook you stuff right oh my god okay
that's pretty cool look dry so dry okay
this all looks kind of dry just checking
up on the daily blog everything seems to
be going pretty well everyone seems to
like my first flight flight to New York

it still looks right well that's good
and I couldn't even finish my full meal
