aiways Gadsby come back in here see him
in the corner taking a piss on a bag I
truly try my best to stop it was like no
I thought I was like what I'll pick him
up a movie because he's already pissed
everywhere if he runs up now you're
gonna piss off ahead everything out so I
just didn't what to do but because like
what I like stopped him when I landed on
him like now don't pay just like hold
him by his shoulders he laid all in his
piss by all the piss on the on the
suitcase bag like he's pissed all over
the suitcase all inside like a massive
puddle he stank and was so wet through
piss an exercise of cleaning Gatsby how
are you doing I didn't use any Stokes I
know it's bad for him I just used water
and washed it out of his fur poor little
thing
strangely enjoyed it didn't you look at
him it's just purring away yeah
absolutely loved it but I couldn't film
it just because I wanted to get as fast
as possible he's all right so I'm gonna
dry them up now and let him lick himself
dry and give him some food
all right you're such a sausage why
don't you just use the toilet this
wouldn't happen among yeah that's where
you were supposed to be his sausage what
wow wow you really doing wrong
this is totally half a cup because the
cats were locked in those rooms but the
moment I let him out that room he was in
the lounge he could have just wandered
on downstairs use the toilet instead he
followed me upstairs trying found Luna
farm Luna for 50 minutes he still did
come downstairs and use the toilet
he's lacking brain cells but anyway I've
asked him he actually enjoyed it which
next time I'm obviously gonna film that
experience cuz I did not expect him to
like you I couldn't be asked with a
traumatising cat video on YouTube but
then I dry him off a little bit
