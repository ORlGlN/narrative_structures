from one blog to another this is me
trying to upload yesterday's vlog and I
thought my internet on my phone would be
fast enough it's currently on a hole
zero 10 and 30 minutes remaining
yeah we're at the airport waiting for
our flight we have a whole 30 minutes
before we take a 4-hour flight to Los
Angeles this is me risking my flight
just to try and get the vlog I'm trying
to connect to all the wi-fi's I've even
tried a hotspot off my phone that's how
I even got the vlog up and I just cannot
seem to do it so this sucks I really do
try to get the vlogs up one time but
when I don't have the internet or the
capability to even do it then there's
nothing I can do about it look web page
is not available literally nothing I can
do
flying done that was my 40th time flying
from the UK to LA so out of the way time
to get a taxi to my father you think
someone got shot yeah
why it was if they lost something you
see that yeah something yeah
okay then hopefully that is don't
actually happen and maybe something else
happened but either way that's not
exactly a great thing to return home to
oh god is it good to be home it's nice
knowing that it's a complete fucking tip
I got this desk that Millie gave me that
I've got a crime bill tomorrow but at
least I'll have a desk but shit before
we even get into it if you guys haven't
seen my American apartment you'll love
that this is a this is my gaming so you
know like a bit like that epic rig in
the UK well this this is why you came
u.s. one I've got like an chest of
drawers a really shitty shabby table
that's falling apart and anyway I'm
surprised it's still together but I've
made it back I've got clothes from
Russia on the floor look like another
suitcase in there I got a suitcase in my
bedroom on the floor but and there sorry
from flying back from New York nothing
is tidy or clean because I've been so
got that busy but nonetheless it's good
to be back and the best thing about
being back here in LA without a doubt
without a doubt apart from someone being
possibly sure I'm going to find out what
it was is this bed best confuse bed in
all the beds that I own even my seven
foot one in the UK this is the compass
bed I've ever had and I could not wait
to have a night's sleep in it so it's
ten o'clock I'm gonna get some food and
pass the fuck out so ladies and
gentlemen I know today's vlog has been
very short oh no I'm not I'm not ending
it here I'm continuing this on tomorrow
so it's gonna be a tomorrow ish Eve log
yeah
holy shit so I just found out what
happened basically on the road like
literally just down with the road from
me there was someone stole a car and
hit-and-run a pedestrian and killed them
and so like the entire streets closed
down there checking all those places for
curat cameras I'd no idea why I was like
shoot in life should it be more police
boy it turns out there's a head
someone died like that could have easily
been me walking down the street going to
IHOP uh late at night fuck
well I set my alarm to wake me up at a
fast night woke up after that I would
like did they go back to bed is now 12
noon and I have feeling self nothing
owning beds made working on nibbling or
cleaning up a few things wash my towels
and now we're washing laundry until
we're going out trying a new sandwich
place with the road from me so fingers
crossed it's gonna be awesome and by the
way if you live alone and you don't want
to starving speaks in your ceiling get
so knows so knows also knows sound
system is incredible you control all by
your phone oh I do is pop pop wireless
speakers I got one in our bedroom on top
of my bed I don't one of my office I'm
gonna get another one from the bathroom
because they're that friggin good like
the list of things that want to do a
stand bucket obviously the main one is
likes on my apartment to get that our
light looking Swagger's fuck but mainly
I want to get pedal bike I don't be able
to get from A to B pedaling rather than
walking
I'll get Anubis come on one-on-one the
exercise in church won't be able to get
places faster than walking so that is
the plan we're gonna do we're gonna your
bike shopping this week I think and it's
going to be fabulous sit in on a toilet
sit in on a toilet well apartment that
be in the local somebody I've ever
waited for it's got a black forest
panini ax cannot wait to try black boys
hammer with olives and I don't even like
olives but I'm giving a go and some
Mexican Coke you know what I totally
forgot my apartment had this on the roof
I'm always like oh no someone of inside
so I've decided that pretty much every
day I'm gonna go get lunch and say hey
just so I can get some sunlight whilst I
meet you rather than sitting in my
office soaked in I think go downstairs
and disappear into my room for hours and
hours and hours and by the way this top
I'm wearing right now my god does it
show my nipples off would you just look
at that I can even see a nipple or
nipple for the record that sandwich was
pretty damn Bank and look at the size of
this bottle of coke ah you know when you
just kind of like sat there doing
nothing you think there's something I'm
supposed to be doing well yeah that's
supposed to be put in the fridge it's
been there for about an hour okay this
is all set
we're going to change it we're building
it and I guarantee you it took me
forever to unscrew these things it's
like six screws for each leg I have a
drill
it's fucking fly to these bitches by the
way I am really sorry for swearing so
much I notice I did it yesterday's vlog
particular swore so damn much just
because like a lot of stuff was annoying
me but I really want to stop but just
realize I can't help each kind of rolls
off the tongue I don't know okay
screwdriver ring and building complete
time to put in the computers screens and
all that sort of shares we'll hopefully
have a nice sexy look itself and there's
nothing I can do about the Y's they're
gonna look terrible so let's continue
well ladies and gentlemen it's pretty
much done I'm actually kind of happy
with it it looks really good everything
is swaggy computer under there now you
can see it so it's all like glowy with
the green lights but yeah it's pretty
much so I need to get like PlayStation
plugged in the Nintendo Wii plugged in
but other than that it's all good to go
however this one this one monitor I
don't have it right now able to plug in
so I might be my playstation from over
here to here and then just have that as
the setup so well just not just see how
it all goes but although other not and
myself myself is looking pretty damn
swanky but right now the cable to get
from that screen to be a PC to the
computer is way too short so I'm gonna
go to Best Buy and go and get a new
DisplayPort because I like one meter I
really like the like as long as my arm
yeah I can meet her so I'm gonna go get
some new ones that I like 10 meters so I
can never complain about them not being
long enough I'm probably pick up like
five HDMI cables that like 10 meters
each as well so we have a plan of action
we know what we're doing we're getting
in an uber and traveling going getting
some stuff and I still have an emo
sandwich nom again like I said I've
decided that when I'm leaving the
building rather than waiting for the
elevator I can take stairs every day
just because that way it makes me have a
little bit of exercise because a music
video games although
so gonna get the black muscles hurt oh
shit I didn't know that razor
unfortunately it's just too big for
where I need the music coming from but
I'm thinking of getting these boats even
these ones these ones God these wings I
don't know can I go well I decided on
them speakers I've got three HDMI cables
I've got two Ethernet cables and I got
adapters and USB extender so myself
what should be perfect just thought I'd
share this with you kids of the world
you might not know what this is this is
what we call it a DVD like a CD you
don't actually download it what you buy
it comes on a disc so yeah that was a
thing first day of do do break any any
weird shit happened to you yet yeah
fingers crossed right well this is where
I'm gonna tell you we're gonna go rob
some banks I've actually got a good I'm
holding you hostage okay it goes
downhill from here Dan we are getting
shit done so that is now my new speakers
which you've been awesome and like I
said we will unbox this today but first
of all I'm going to get all these cables
installed into the new setup because
this dumb cable here way too tight and
short to get over to that and yeah we'll
make this the PC monitor so this is
going to be my little setup here for
doing PC streaming light blue and then
for doing PlayStation streaming but but
I might have another plan of action
these screens actually tilt like this oh
my god I swear break it they do this
alright so you see it's it so if we do
that to the screen you lift it up as
well if we do that to the screen I could
put my twitch chat on this it's like
from top to bottom twitch chat which
could be absolutely beautiful for the
record these speakers are insane now
this is them turned down as more like
pretty much as much as possible because
they're so damn loud you ready
oh it's even turn down the spotlight you
ready Jesus Christ I'm sir my
predicament of techniques isn't working
what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to
go a DisplayPort to HDMI to HDMI to
DisplayPort into a monitors because
these screens run off 144 Hertz if you
plug in HDMI going to do six years but
they need to be DisplayPort to be able
to get the full one out of them now this
computer only has two display ports in
it because it only has two graphics
cards that makes sense
but unfortunately right now I'm not
finding the solution as to how to be
able to connect a third monitor and have
it at 130 140 4 Hertz but hopefully I
will find a way if you know look got no
comment leave it down below forever
alone I I was at streaming actually
seven hours of streaming I forgot I did
a two hour stream before it and it is
now 5:00 o'clock in the morning it's not
jag like what to slot your earth it's
not jet like why I'm awake it's a fact I
just the street decided to screen for
wait till one god damn it I really need
to go to sleep on that diagnose is late
and I am going to bed good night world
