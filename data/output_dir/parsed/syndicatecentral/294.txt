name for drowning and vlogging be at the
same time leave a comment down below

fact that the microphone picks up for
when I'm flying is great I think you can
disable it obviously I'm sure it's a
certain but it's just so good because
then rather than me having to like bang
like the same music on it again and
again and again and again and trying to
get artistically shot I can basically do
my vlogging so I want to show you
something and you talk about in life
time which is perfect me so I didn't I
