surprise for 1.9 million subscribers but
sadly it got cancelled I'm devastated

tomorrow with you it's going to be
awesome but you had a huge surprise
planned to you guys it's gonna be
absolutely awesome and cool and lead
onto so much more stuff and yeah I got
there and they were like nope nope too
late it's too late it's cancelled and
one of the peoples got flu so I was like
not fully a virus he's got a virus or so
no just you know look what is this about
cover cover my ears as well so they were
I was like no it genuinely is the end of
the world devastated and all that but
pretty good
well I hit 1.9 million subscribers when
well then did how cool is that
oh my god another smash this big glass
blast Jesus balanced you stay place my
front of you so you can see what I'm
wearing this cuz like if I show you my
hair it's wise anything but I'm
devastated I had huge plans today for
you guys repping the Machinima hoodie I
bumped into him I've got his name I it
was so early I went into about guards to
get McDonald's breakfast this morning to
work get me get pumped and stoked for
this event today and I walk to my car
this dude was like I watching this dude
went in a nice in a nice oh I'm not
taking the piss out of him they're just
like can't look at me and I was like
I've got bad eyesight so I was like I
didn't have my glasses on and then this
do and there are doing Mac dogs and this
guy was like do I act around I need you
show you alright and I was like
yeah I'm fine why Eddie just went went
quiet
well I don't know do you know before me
and Cindy Cory just some random dude
who's saying hello and I was like I said
you're right you know I really puzzle
play you want to say hello you do you
know me do not know me you're saying
right and then it was like you talked
you shouldna car you told and I was like
yeah you know then after that Suzy you
ever seen me say hello Tom our syndicate
so you actually like you know me if you
ever bump into me because sometimes you
know people just come over like oh
you're all wrong person that's all
thinking if if everyone comes over and
I'm like I'm like oh good to meet you
you're a fun
no let's just pick edit and rung so it's
like I just treat every person I meet
like it's just a normal person so I've
looked up I do yeah trapa tell us that
was crazy super busy met loads of fun
there which was nuts we just walk around
it was some dude from America there I
saw I was I was crazy and his accent was
awesome no it stood out so much like I'm
used to hanging out with Americans but
when I said you full of British people
in one America it's amazing that's why
Kate when she was in London it London
all the time which we speak ours like
wow that's amazing but I've got hiccups
now every time I sit I said to do a
commentary I seem to get hiccups but a
devastating about today I don't know
what I don't know what else I can do I
go and do something else to like make up
for it I could probably skip going fly
to Paris for the day and bungee jump off
the Eiffel Tower
okay Cup so bad if oh no it's possible I
can do it
I'd literally go and do it now but I
think a last-minute flight to France at
this time of year is probably gonna be
pretty expensive so good I couldn't do
my 1.9 million subscribe to celebrate
shouldn't today but guys I'll hopefully
I get excited um next week or even
tomorrow I think is tomorrow then
hopefully I'll be okay
but yeah huge thank you to everyone for
1.9 missiles so he gun huge thanks to
everyone for 1.9 million subscribers I
think it's absolutely insane to think
that we're near 2 million is just
mind-blowing I never even did like a
video for one poem for anything for any
milestones which I want to so I think
I've got something super cool
supercool pun for 10 million subscribers
gonna take a lot of organization but
hopefully if I get it done then it will
make up for every single and celebration
think utmost wow I've got to go now so
go hook up so bye bye guys sorry about
that I'm gonna keep it a secret still
and yeah no no guess in the comments I
know you're all doing it's College so
