getting around 4:30 no please don't
dummy around 35 I just did a massive
fuckup at light round the 29 I went down

was really stupid
so the run that I'm trying to do I need
the a K kind of light upgraded
completely dissipate I need the a K kind
of light maxed out with all the
attachments like fast mags everything
like that a rapid fire if I can get that
then this run that I'm trying to do
because I know you can use turned and
you know just get through the high
rounds but I really want to try and gain
the kills on the round so hopefully and
we'll try and get all the attachments
and just be good to go to kick some ass
and get everything I need to beast mode

shops and I was like why am I not
