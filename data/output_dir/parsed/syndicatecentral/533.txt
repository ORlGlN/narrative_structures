starting today of looking like a fluffy
potato but also my new desk has arrived
from up des this guy saw me tweeting
about an adjustable desk and if sent me
one oh my gosh up desk guys remember me
saying I'm always more productive when
I'm stood at like a high Oh desk and
then PewDiePie means video what was like
setup and everything like that and he
had like an adjustable desk so I asked
him where he got it from he said it was
John Lewis and I went to the store and
that's where bumped into my gun at that
time like to try and see it but they
don't have any examples but as I was
tweeting about it wanting to be able to
see it somewhere this company hit me
open was like we also make them would
you want to check one out for like your
YouTube channel and I was like fuck yes
but they kindly sent me one like I'm not
paid to show this or anything like that
just to disclose that straight away but
they did send me an update so I'm going
to build it up check it out and giving
it reviewed polka dot controls we are
back to add more to the collection so
it's throw these out here like that
now do I have one of these already I
don't think so this bad boy is
officially a pop figure funky let's go
oh there you go Jimmy buddy thanks to
this this is officially from Funko which
is the same style but you can tell it
just doesn't look the same as all the
rest like I technically have a kylo Ren
there so I'm gonna move here we're so
moving moving they're gonna keep kylo
Ren and I'm gonna put down morale back
there instead because he's an official
one so then we don't have an odd-looking
mothertrucker over here we can put this
wherever but like for now I don't think
it needs to be on the shelf there also
have a Bubba Fett this is getting
difficult this is the Star Wars shop and
it's getting more and more difficult to
fit them in each time like this is this
this is about to start getting
overcrowded the shelf that's all I'm
saying
but I think we may have we may have just
pulled it off Joker with no t-shirt on
we'll go down here and oh what the hell
she fell over go over here near his
other Joker counterpart so I've now got
three don't worry they're not the same
joke because they're actually different
Joker's one in a purple suit one in a
black suit and one naked so yeah
look at that connection now it's for
bumble bit why the hell is there an
empty Harry Potter box just lay that
kick get the hell out of there alright
where did we put bumble bee um um I
don't know so there's a perfect spot
from there's an empty space there and
what
so in there with the random collection
of things looking pretty good I like
that I think my dad came over and added
this to the collection but he's a
duplicate so he's going to go up there
but so far so good I do have a few extra
pop figures from legends of gaming that
people gave me so I'm going to add these
to the shelf as well so yeah my looking
pretty good I don't know is any extras
that have fallen over so I think they're
okay oh shit what up I'm finally wearing

find where my dad stored in my house all
