before today's vlog starts I need to let
you all know something but we still in
Japan as you can tell but if you guys
wanna get your hand on a shirt what
these go live
they're available for a three day
pre-order purchase and once the three
days are over
they're gone you'll never be able to get
the shirt ever again so if you want to
get your first-ever limited-edition
shirt or to add to your collection
Syndic original calm be there or be
square
before you say anything yes I look like
a pawn
yes and wearing the exact same clothes
as yesterday because we're going on a
hike and a little bit of a run this
morning and there's no party wasting a
day of clothes by getting changed
sweating in them and then them being
ruined so stop dreaming random temple in
the mountains here we come
that woman came out of a house to wave
at them this is so we made it to a
shrine which is where here I'm gonna
have to walk 35 minutes this path to
this viewing area where we can see Fuji
from a beautiful viewer but you just
pull out the clock
yeah flippin hack Jesus eyes absolutely
beautiful
I don't think I've truly swayed so much
hiking up something I could feel just
draining down my face I'm up and my
t-shirt it's just stuck to me but we
made it it's a beautiful view I kinda
wish I had a jet ski over there that'll
be proud pretty damn dope go around the
lake in that book you know what whatever
we did it we made it time to hike back
down for checking out the air B&B right
now and the glorious thing about this
was we actually didn't have any towels
got to pay extra for towels which is
kind of it weird I don't know it's a
Japanese thing or an Airbnb thing but we
didn't instead we bought high-density
tissue paper like you know like kitchen
wipes and yeah we literally just dried
I'm currently using the last batch of it
to dry my hair with so yep if this isn't
live cause right now I don't know what
you're doing your poisonous are you
friendly I don't know what you doing
would you crept up on me and I can I
want to stroke you but I'm in a
different country so I don't want that
current situation we're all bagged up
ready to rock and roll we got to get to
the bus station
find out which bus takes us to a
different town from a bullet train we're
going to Osaka so we're going down to
our socket where I believe Tom the trunk
lady lives and we're kicking it down
there in a new way ever be be and just
winging it apparently there's a Pokemon
dude why do we not have these kind of
kick cuts in the UK strawberry
cheesecake why I want to try this
we have fish and chips
No
don't that looks like maybe an op hold
it it looks like it's boiling boiling
SoCal right I think maybe oh yes you're
a genius
you're ready for an adventure into the
hills in the mountains of Japan I'm
assuming that is a year I love how the
only British things on here are the date
and the departure time so we need to
know right now but this is a big-ass
lake and they have like little rubber
duckies that you can rent out whichever
engines they're not exactly that well
we got an hour to go Tom how it's go to
get to our destination so let's hope I
don't drop the phone muscle on the way
there and I get it from cooler shut yeah
well I was a successful bus ride
actually kind of fell asleep for most of
it so now up to the train station I
think which is this blue this is the
wanted list okay
I don't know how much that reward is for
bringing them in but these guys look
pretty creepy and then check this out I
don't know what that says so keep your
eyes out ladies and gentlemen if you see
them in my blog let me know I did not
quite realize this but we're about to
own the world's fastest train apparently
now it could be wrong with that
statement this is what these guys said
so I'm gonna believe them this train
it's a maglev train so like roller
coasters on megacles dude we're going on
that I had no idea you excited for
trains there's a Thomas the Tank Engine
lund here in Japan who needs it what's
the point what's the point watching this
bitch ass bitch has train who's just got
face talks I mean going the world's
faster it was 200 miles per hour
fuck oh yeah brueski getting on the
train myself sir wit for drinking has
never been more easy ever and it weird
it's just these are everywhere oh yeah
walking on the streets it's like
everything so just easy to get
inconvenient you know it's like you can
wait someone to pour you a pie but it's
just like that I don't know you can go
into a shop and do it but it's just so
conveniently easy well she'd rather die
whilst travelling around like bumping
into these machines everywhere is just
amazing this country runs of just pure
convenience
dude this thing's gonna be crazy working
for to wait run it for two hours so
dropping like foolish miles on yeah if
we're doing two hours 200 miles per hour
yeah yeah yeah it was really difficult I
know I know I know
simply by popular demand that people
loving your tongue how do you say potato
salad in Japanese no it's not here it is
we bout again on our clean and we're
gonna be all right
are you excited go in on a train to a
super-fast place I can't wait to go I
can home up there
I don't know what
oh and air pressure doors are being
locked up we see through seat oh the
window at the aisle I've never had so
much leg room on a train look at this
obviously this is my seat as well and
this train is going really the one
moment I stick my phone out the window
it's just trees and nothing illegal look
at that just fly-in past old school
Tokyo Tokyo Japan even sorry hello how
Tom just happen to fall out this is
potato salad in chip form oh really
that will take them into bits do you
wanna draw beer oh yeah
three proven Tuesday
you would see actually I never had these
before oh really
what you lied to me okay this may look
like normal chairs to you but do you see
that little kick switch right there
ignore the fact that I've got two bears
you see that little kick switch there
you can click it and apparently rotate
this chair the entire way around so our
boy is gonna politely ask this guy if
they like it ya know now we're really
close to each other busy it's the same
it's evil white and blue or white and
black and I'm hoping that in a minute I
will see an American that I recognize
where are we at where we at where we at
where we hey no

nasty he's nasty being so improper and
look at this line over here no the
British suck Wow
