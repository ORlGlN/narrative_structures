girlfriend with you now I guess about
that shit
this is a big time creator so good
right we're doing really good about I'd
give it a seven then I thought it was
really funny I would definitely
recommend it but it was like a lot of
loose
how would you give it yeah it had
nothing on thor ragnarok boy it was
definitely better than what i was
expecting so it's some pretty but I have
to say for fact the flash best character
hands down maybe there was a scene
spoiling there's a scene where Eli zaps
in time to save Wonder Woman and then
the way they for the poor is Pacey's on
a boobs they look and then exactly stuff
still becomes iffy but it never happened
it was like so good we need the wife's
opinion what are you giving that Bill
Martin
I give it a really strong 7.5 just just
let the story line I was a bit like with
all the movies out of that like the
Vista boys do much yeah
Oh DC vs. whatever everyone's getting
triggered as she gives it an 8 a man
gave it 7 I gave it 7.5 solid deadly
recommended we're following the signs
for winter wonderland I don't actually
know what to expect it because it's on
such a bigger scale what does that say
ahead for winter wonderland please
follow pink signs we've made it
somewhere we're being shuffled through a
little door there's a big gate there but
no we have to go this way
are you excited I don't know what to
expect in here this is like manchester
markets
times a thousand we've made it to win to
earn the land I don't know when it gets
started or when we start seeing things
but right now in computer for little
lights not so beautiful lights and we're
going to explore well we found it winter
wonderland that's how you get in but
that is the Qzone
apparently the different entrance for
