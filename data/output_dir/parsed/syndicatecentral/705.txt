just got out of it got out of bed look
like a potato but it doesn't matter you
will have life you will survive one way
or another look at this I'm gonna bring
this back to life it's gonna exist once
again this is totally against what I
stand for the Sun has not gone anywhere
near down across the building but I have
got to play plants vs. zombies against a
little chicken so I gotta go do it gonna
kick some ass and hopefully get some
time to back out here in the Sun and
then head down to a shooting range today
so it's currently 420 blaze it in the
afternoon and I made the mistake of
leaving for two hours instead of once so
bit late to where and suppose we going
right now but fingers crossed I'm gonna
make it to the gun range like I've
always wanted to go to and where 3bd
offices are it's literally around the
corner from it so let's see who at the
office
once we're gonna shoot some with me
okay change of plan
I'm coming to MIT sewer instead I have
not been here in so long since I moved
out into the apartment so I decided
it rather than going downtown in a
shooting range I'm coming here for food
it's so damn
awesome and I always go to this one
right here and then I always get a
number 45 even though it looks nothing
like that less expectations that's what
I'm getting this place is for so much
weird like weird alcohol and weird
drinks so I'm gonna get a weird drink to
go with my meal what the hell is half
this I could literally live in this
place every day try something new like
what the is this what is that what
is half this
it does have British labels which kind
of half describe it but you don't really
quite get the understanding value of it
I can't tell apart this is food or its
toys like deep or what it's in a
candy aisle not a toy aisle so I really
don't know I honestly absolutely loved
it when me and took he used to come here
he used to come and get random and
then just try test it with each other
like is this pokemon cards is that
pokemon cards or food oh it's a Waffle
flower I don't know I want to get
something really really randomly
I can tell you right now this is all
gonna be such a bad idea I'm psyched and
boom there's my food it looks
good yes food is incredible like I
expected so I'm now gonna try this drink
and see how that goes with it as well
vomit truth
it's not about
actually it's literal just like
strawberry soda that's it like you know
you get orange soda it's just rubbish oh
I am 99% sure it's about to start
raining in LA
holy crap I came out with sunglasses on
her now it's just completely gone dead
it looks like there's about to be a
storm the weather is awful yeah yeah
came out with sunglasses on and all of a
sudden it's just like this well the side
my plans have wanting to go take my
Japanese food to a shooting range not to
shoot it just to try and then do
shooting with foil because the office
where I was going the shooting range
next to it closed down instead of that
I've got a live should be playing csgo
instead you know if I can't show you
things in real life I'll shoot it in a
video game let's take a look at what I
got so first of all we have got this if
someone could translate it that would be
amazing
it says it's spicy
crisps like like snacks so let's try it
already
it makes me feel like it's gonna be
stupidly spicy but I'm good
oh my god doors just next up in the bag
we have hello Panda biscuits I don't
think I've ever had these before so
let's crack these open and see what they
taste like I think this might be quite
nice they look like they have chocolate
inside them so I should really give
these a rate in our handbook and go
check these out and see what a thing oh
okay
there's shaped like little pandas filled
with chocolate
I think it's chocolate all right I don't
know what that smell was about hello
it's just a snap with the chocolate in
the middle of it no burn and last but
not least I bought the weirdest thing I
possibly could like yeah I looked all
the snacks and was like what looks
creepy as and it's this I have no
idea what to do with it but I'm gonna
aim the camera down and we're gonna
we're gonna attempt it okay so yeah okay
let's give this a go I feel like I'm
doing like a weird like reviewing gel
now I think I have to make whatever this
is that is what I'm to do oh well well
there's instructions on the back of it
what what I have to add water to it or a
satchel or something okay I don't have
high hopes for this whatsoever I don't
think it's gonna go well but we'll take
a look okay so what what do we even
do let's just follow the instructions
and stick with what we know we need to
do so I need to put this satchel what is
it chocolate sauce or something into
this one oh and then this weird
powder into the other one then I had
water onto this and leave it for how
long I don't even know anyway step one
how do I get in this 22 scissors okay
let's get scissors cut the corner off
and then squeeze this into always just
play it's just cutting the tower okay
well actually looks like or
whatever
nice let's put that in there sweet good
stuff good stuff that's the first
portion of stuff we need to place down
there we need to put this down I really
don't know what this is I'm gonna
sniff to try and work out with Liz but
look I have no idea what that is what
the hell is it it makes no sense he
doesn't smell like anything recognizable
alright now for the main step a main
ingredient portion comes on I'm gonna
add water to this it says I just soaked
the minute or what
I don't know well it doesn't look too
convincing I can't tell if they're
changing or not that oh-oh-oh they've
gone from like solid as a rock to soggy
as a nipple oh that's weird
oh that's weird I don't like it oh no
it's like whoa it's sticky
what oh that's odd
okay now what apparently you're supposed
to dip it in the chocolate sauce I look
like that well this looks like horribly
bad then you dip it in this and then you
know ready for this oh my god no
that was quite possibly one of the
weirdest things I've ever tasted in my
life while my body just reacted to that
like that was so natural I like the
cringe was so real that that was
awful so out of the four things about
three of them were perfect i massively
do not recommend whatever the fork this
is awesome here spending a hundred
dollars yes actually a hundred dollars
on spinning these to try and get some
polka holics i asked everyone to tweet
at me their dream cars you got a Fred
Flintstone we got an aid wagon got quite
a muscle car stereos it's pretty
no I like the moment that I stopped
doing that then stop filming a penis
appeared I feel like at a brain
malfunctions I can't remember if I fell
asleep whilst watching that film but I
don't know what have been halfway
through it but either way watch the film
it was now and give it a six out of ten
it was Will Ferrell which was funny but
little less that is it's one o'clock in
the morning now so I'm going to bed and
tomorrow I'd finally you remember that
day when I went out and I said I managed
to film behind the scene you can see
some Terminator cool I'm actually
gonna go to that office tomorrow

sneaky this if you guys look
