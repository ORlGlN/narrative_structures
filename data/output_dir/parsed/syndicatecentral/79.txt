oh my god oh my god oh my god what is
going on I'm not gonna be able to get
out the house seriously
whoa cats I came down to feed here I had
no idea the weather was like this holy
snap okay so I might have to push
forward my purchase of an off-road
vehicle I've actually found one and it's
only like 40 miles away I'm after a Land
Rover Defender I'm actually just down
his mines to feed the cats
hello what's the food what's the food
okay you guys looking on beautiful in 4k
look at you looking beautiful in 4k that
is if I think I've got the setting on
this iPhone correctly at 4k 60fps I
don't like I'm rendering out in 4k 60fps
boy if I'm filming in 4k d rendering in
1080 the quality might still be better
anyway that might be wrong about but who
knows
first you guys are having tender even as
good as it looks I don't know what that
means
what flavor is this what are you doing
well this is the first time this cast
ever just been like I'm not gonna eat my
food trade you know like that one or
something I'm assuming no because you're
not eating it your sister's absolutely
destroying it but you you don't you
don't even wait wait for it wait and
there we go what I'm filming for okay as
usual
oh I said about the car is when I came
back I tweeted like ah you know I need
another Odin car because if it if it
starts snowing I literally can't get
about I've got an Audi TT so I can't get
around
Lydia's Cowell wheels to get around
they're just two wheel drive cars so I
need like a four wheel drive beast the
roads might be great in like the main
areas of Manchester in England and so
forth but in my local area well it stuck
like this oh no I'm not gonna be able to
get anywhere so what I found was a run
I like the look of and a defender but I
think like I'm British and I've always
liked the look of a defender so a
defender is the way to go it's only 46
miles away or what I Drive to go and
check it out it looks like an absolute
beast
so if maybe I can somehow get down there
I will and you know what if if I can get
my dad to like kind of come with me see
the car because he's like a big car guy
an assessee you know driver and go this
is right it's not falling apart that
sort of stuff and pulled the trigger on
it like early then this might be the
perfect time to get driving around an
absolute beast of a vehicle because oh
my no D this is like I think my first
ever
oh no no I said this is my first have a
truly white white snowy time at my house
but do you guys know when I did the
ghost show pepper
that was that was super snowy but your f
it's daddy's snowy till Christmas and
it's a white Christmas
we need the 4x4 we need to fall back but
look look at it fuck look at snowy is oh
my god oh this doubts coming in oh my
god I don't have any win again I said
yesterday is like an example as walk
around I was just in Los Angeles where
was I
certainly I was in the desert this
forest forest fires then - this is a
contrast we're trapped inside so we're
watching I don't know what is this
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle song this is
a new Teenage Mutant Ninja
I know no snow don't take two yeah
though that we don't just do sitting in
what we've got ring my dad
I've got juice I think my dad's got my
sledge dude easy choice for snowy
weather is sucks and chores you know
dramatic zoom anymore why what why can't
it a drag zoom no Maps stop filming in
4k just lucky dramatic zoom but all
brain wearing wearing the kanji crewneck
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
City originals my objective today is to
try and get rid of the snow from here
now this might not look it not a lot of
snow my bike tell me you can just drive
over that easily answer is yeah you can
yeah you can but trust me I I don't want
to risk it so I'm gonna move that
someone tries to scrape that snow with
the back of a brush off there right the
wood of a brush scrape it off so we can
get enough to drive that easy I do not
want to risk Lydia crushing even though
I'm I'm driving her car so yeah we look
tame to little Keith the broom wait
what's that from that's a name right
broom-hilda is that it's a name of like
a show or a film or something but hold
up oh oh yeah oh oh oh yeah oh yeah oh
yeah that's no well they're crispy
freshness yeah I'm not I'm not exactly
dressed for this occasion oh man I have
an idea
Steve Pete you might be the man of the
hour
no I took you back I was gonna use you
as a snowplow found a brochure see okay
change but sticks it sticks to the non
front oh you have to tell me what this
phone looks like because you know if I
do try and render it out in 4k 61 it's
gonna take forever to render out and -
it's gonna take a lifetime to upload but
the problem is switching from the back
camera beam being for Kate and then the
front camera beam by I think 1080 30 it
might look disgusting so a lot better
feedback would be great and the survey
says oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
yeah ah look at that probably just gonna
make it did I see but you know what core
principle it works well I did a good
effort a lot of it isn't slipping or
sliding get these little punches working
which are a little bit like e we're
hoping it might be okay this is the part
which I think might be slippy what the
hell oh well this is clearly someone's
dog I was like who the hell is this this
might be really slipping this is where I
drove him home I got this is gonna be
awful there I drove my motorbike up not
in snow like this like it was just
starting to snow and it was about that
much snow that thick just there and my
bike slipped and started sliding down a
hill
yep no dad I'm gonna try and drive
Lydia's car off a the way I think this
is gonna go is wrong like seriously I'm
gonna drive it off the drive fine with
speed I don't think it's front wheel
drive or rear wheel drive hers up under
this and just get it onto the road at
least if it's on the road it should in
theory be okay but then also the
downside is if someone else comes down
the road are you proud of me I got it
from there to there I knew I should just
scrape the snow off I thought it'd be so
thin that be fine but I was like yeah
surely if I get it of speed enough
traction I'll be fine and it got stuck
there and swung the one thing I don't
want it to do like if it slides forward
it'll be fine and shouldn't slip down
there but at least if I crush your car I
can pay for it it can go on YouTube
right yeah okay sweet going back back in
oh shit
and I know you can hear but it's like
current chin underneath it's a gauge
about that's all just get it all the way
down the nail yesterday okay if it
wasn't Reese knowing the way it was I'd
give it another attempt and scrape it
off for I think I don't want to keep
compacting the snow making it I say but
yeah I should have just totally screwed
for this snow off like I did there I
didn't think it'd be a lot I thought be
fine but look where it starts it's good
I drove off huh yes just just anyway oh
shit
I like I was Tokyo drifting so you have
to scrape this off because this ya have
to scrape it all up once the snow stops
yeah yeah I wish I was video and that I
yeah a slipped on it nearly died but
just for the record so when I had my
bike it this this snow this level of
snow right now sorry I'd have been
crushed on it wasn't ice underneath this
is the amount of snow that was starting
to fall and I was on my bike coming in
here the gates were open and I came down
here and hit this much snow and then and
I just had to tap on a brake to slow
down to turn or a tap to a break my bike
crap by him it crashed to the ground and
that is sliding down that hill and there
to yank it and yank it and Yankee so he
didn't slide all the way to the end
because more importantly there was a van
at the end so my bike we're gonna move
straight into a van at the end so yeah
cuz because the van was stuck down there
as well so baby I tried and we need to
go down to Manchester drinking well
that's good to be home Merry Christmas
one and all turns out using this brush
that was broken and the pee smell the
entire town was just a waste of time my
dad actually had this up at my house
which just moved it all perfectly so I'm
gonna open the doors scrape it off
so another thick layer of snow does it
go on top of the ice and even more
swords at that point I tweeted the
picture of me stuck with Lydia's car and
my dad replied saying yeah just let you
know there is salt and grit in your
house you put it up there a while back
so it's not in here it's down at the
back so there you go
I do have salt and I do have grit that
thing is amazing dad absolutely homie
I'm pretty sure it's real like just like
washing water off
flat surfaces but know what for snow it
did a cracking job report ms dhoni like
with a thin layer of like water is
that's all gonna freeze so don't get
sucked down the show thank you thank you
I get to to myself Cheers
oh hey the cats roam free in the
household
they're both attempting to scratch the
post I did actually get my phone out to
record the fact they were intrigued by
the Christmas decorations it seems now
they're bored and a vlogger cat meets
bearded dragon in 4k look at that they
had a tag team before like one was
sniffing him from the front and then one
was sniffing him from behind sniffing
his tail oh they didn't nibble end of
his tail off and it'll be okay what do
you think what do you think mr. gage me
what do you think Oh like say that one
from the front all they're saying
they're hot shaking hands are preparing
to Ian one either book and the other
ones like I'm gonna get him why are you
guys just be friends
won't you just I think the are being
friends it's so weird with these cats
because you really can't judge what
they're doing because there is her Oh
way down the only movement they've got
is this if there is good Steve how you
doing I think you're okay I don't you
mean you're okay oh no no no he's
tailing Steve was just like knocking
just not do that I'll walk off
Oh it'll like the hyenas out the Lion
King got they they're so evil to Stevie
I didn't bite him I don't think although
I Steve would a proper reacted this
isn't gonna end well
I can tell something's gonna go terribly
wrong no we're gonna try it's free
tissue it will try to take to but it's
just scientists go again and by the way
this is all the cats do that's all they
do they just sit there looking at Stevie
the varying so I guess what he's out
there most just loving to pieces ball I
speed momentum tree should be fine speed
momentum she should be fine and she's
off alright I did scrape a bit of the
road away and oh it's a Griffin
uh-huh possibly not the ISEE just what
she yes
quick before it gets frozen this is all
do all this sloth she's gonna ice over I
take it back I did actually see a flashy
car go up the road and I was like what
the hell was that I could not think to
hold me what it was it was the gray
crazy loaded the road is now drivable
will remain legit a white Christmas like
I'll have to go life is easy indeed it's
a white Christmas how much good it's

stock just cuz they thought they're

someone messed up her I don't really see
the point

may be if you're so rich you can just
afford to burn running okay that's a

spoilers but I actually the firt the
reason why I came across Jaguars in the
first place like the f-type or anything
was cuz I went to go and buy but more
importantly I actually rolled off at
Jaguar Land Rover cuz like same company
to buy a defender and the add no
defenders and as I drove around the
light line you guys saw the vlog I drove
run along I know defenders I cry
whatever and then I turn around I was
like Jaguar f-type what is that well
mine was blown so uh I think I am gonna
be getting a defender I'm liking the one
I found if it does end up to be perfect
then you know what I'm just gonna get it
and how much sure you guys it means a
bit more off-roading a bit bit more
rugged stuff we can do and you know I'm
not gonna drive you anyway no no listen
