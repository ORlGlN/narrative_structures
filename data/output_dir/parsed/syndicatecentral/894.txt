I was just saying to my uncle it's
really nice to have all the families
together they're gonna like if there's
anything I like strive for in life it's
being together with family and
everything like that but it's really sad
that it's in the situation the
circumstances it is but that's what life
is it's real shit you just got to deal
with it you have got to be the
pooper-scooper of life and just handle
it the way you've got handle it book
it's really nice to have family together
but it would have been better on best
circumstances I'm currently in the
position where I've got too many crumbs
on me from cupboard olives and to a
point where I cannot move otherwise okay
