not bad today not bad good morning
ladies and gentlemen to welcome your
fair okay let me be honest it broke the
door shut oh there we go it isn't quite
the morning it is now two notes 19 to 15
it is now 3 o'clock in the afternoon and
we're starting the day this is the box
I've been talking about the past three
days that stood on bond and we will be
opening that later today slunk next stop
box haha well go I need I've got a
subway before we start the day and then
hopefully streaming some resident evil
and it's just so weird to think I'm in
California now and it's all sunny when I
was just freezing my nipples off in the
mountains was only an outlet it was well
it was only two hours away as well but
that is quite possibly the most
petrifying thing I've ever seen in the
store in my life what is that
in and out in seconds I'm officially
confused as all fuck he's just some
dudes with drums I'm not too sure but I
like it I like it a lot
good vibes I was like I can hear a
drumming circle or something to random
dudes walking around the street he's got
a microphone on and everything Los
Angeles ladies and gentlemen oh my gosh
Subway sandwich what do we have 12-inch
Italian we've got ham turkey bacon
lettuce cucumber and mayonnaise toasted
box time right so like I said I'm not
100% sure who this box is actually from
I'm going with razor because they always
send me swag and they did say they was
gonna send me something but I could
always go wrong so Oh change of scenery
the box fell I fell the camera fell so
we're doing this again welcome to my
office
this is like a professional unboxing now
which is totally not true but I actually
have been non-stop thinking about making
a proper like unboxing channel for tech
and reviews and stuff because I love me
some tech I really want to jam with
starts good for our depends what you
guys think because I do get sent an
awful lot of stuff and oh my god we were
we were close I've got to show you this
oh my god it's a sensory things it's
usually in boxes like this as you can
see over here this is not out the box
for as you can see when I've cut here I
cut the bag and inside it is oh no I did
know where threw the knife down on the
box I pissed the app oh god damn it
the eraser I'm so sorry this was such a
fail man either way well let's continue
the unboxing this is now officially like
my biggest fail of an unboxing ever
bought okay
razor I forgot we're sending me the new
backpack they got and oh dear that's
nice oh my god there's so much swag in
this mug alright maybe I should play
chess switch this around so like a
bachelor God let me move the
professional way once again look this
Ladin over here we looking bad as
anything alright welcome to my unboxing
review all raise it now as you guys know
I'm sponsored by Razer so it's kind of a
bias thing so I love absolutely
everything from raising ball um this is
the non hold stabbed knife back pack
that razor sent me goddamnit look at it
it's so sleek and then I just happened
to put a stop mark in it but this is a
new backpack assembly which hopefully
I'm gonna be able to use from now on
because this is a lot thinner than all
the other backpacks they have because
the other ones are quite they're quite
like chunky and this one is looking
quite nice and tasty and here on this
channel where we do the best reviews
ever you better know you better goddamn
know I'm gonna give you a a comparison
so this is the fight preparation sent me
just now and then this is the all-black
pack we had this that is a shock of how
drastically different that is to me
so obviously this one can carry more I
would assume and this one's like a light
at 1 foot you know on the go so if I
want to go like troubling luck for the
day out and I want to just take a laptop
and my camera gear being an iPhone and
some charges this would be the perfect
one so that's pretty sweet I'll put a
laptop in it in a minute but this box by
the way is filled look at this this is
amazing
Thank You razor alright next up it oh
that's my knife sorry
so we have Oh baby alright they did say
whether or not I watch this headset in
black and green
oh nevermind I was or in white and black
and I said I want white black let's do
something different so introducing the
brand-new kraken pro v2 I'm gonna whip
these bad boys out let's not let's not
stab these or you know break them or
anything like that which I have a
tendency to now do boy let's open up a
No
so god damn fancy I love it
I absolutely love it don't think if
you've ever bought anything from Razer
is the packaging is just incredible
oh they look good I like that this my
cell mate but if you have a pale-faced
for my pal headphones kind of like blend
in rather than be dark and making you
look super pale so this is pretty good
dumps we've got all the connectors and
everything like that and Ali comfy they
are actually really really comfy
microphone pulls out as always looking
NASA's suite fuckin Biju's okay nice and
ah let me know what you think in the
comments down below
can't wait this is still going um this
looks to be like a headset mount or
something yeah oh I don't even know if
this is for sale or anything but I sorry
I stabbed myself with my knife but whoa
check us out it's like I don't think
these are actually for sale or anything
but there's somebody nice little
headsets done so as you can see one step
come with me on my desk them headphones
just sit there but now instead watch
these not be made for these headphones
now teller see makes perfect sense
next up we have the hell is that what I
honestly thought this was the you know
the two emoji you're the pro emoji from
the back tell me this does not look like
the / emoji from the back for an actual
fight it's a raisin flashy oh it
actually is call them a really pushy at
all whether you're catching a riveting
eSports match on the edge of your seat
or calmly dominating on the battlefield
from your desk get comfy as you enjoy
the action with this unique razor
companion ah so cute
next up in this world hole we have the
hahaha I need this I'm fucking I'm going
in the US so by the way you see this
before we've inbox it in the UK so I
don't really need to show you what it is
but it's the rage of ROG you are a rat
rat you
how do you guys pronounce that ryu or
Raju I don't know right
Ray Ray Raj the race Raj they got new
name for it yeah this basically raises
control for the ps4 which you can also
use on a console on a PC as well so if
that life statement was wrong you didn't
hear it from me
Ray's a wild cat actually haven't ever
used one of these they gave it me but
then I switched over to PC gaming huasos
in the UK so this is basically like the
Ryu which is here I think it is called
the riot II by the way so this is
basically the PlayStation version raise
your controller and Xbox razor control
as well same thing goes I think you can
use this on PC as well so oh yeah and so
on the top and Windows 10 so boom we got
both of them bitch still got three more
things to go all right next up we have
oh it's a new man I knew my knife i kept
the knife over there so I avoided
stabbing myself but right next up we
have we have a Death Adder ally now I
don't know the difference between a
Death Adder and a death either ally I
should probably read this it probably
says it on the back but I have actually
not replaced that mouse in a damn long
time so what I'm going to switch it out
there it is there's the bad boy looking
nice with obviously their chroma gotta
have the chroma last thing in the Box is
this now I don't even know what this is
but I'm gonna take a guess just because
of the style of the Box not open it yet
I think this is a mug I think this is a
genuine raising look and it is a raise a
mug and what does it say what is it
for gamers my roses t.rzr I wonder if
this is like an employee's mug and I
wouldn't do because it's like it's black
you know I would like the sat in written
it sort of thing I wonder if it heats up
if it turns green so let's go get some
hot water
oh I come to the place might as well so
let's go get some hot water and see if
that heats up there's no instructions in
it so I don't know and throw the night
didn't stop anything could be completely
wrong with this book I'm going to go
with I would assume this would heat up
into and green if not razor you to step
it up because that would be a cool
feature okay moment of truth moment of
I don't know I don't know I actually
really don't think it is because I'm
sure it would have been changing by now
nope
well there's an idea for their next one
anyway I'm going to leave this over here
just in case somehow it does but wait
this is by then right
ah-oh razor disappointed man
disappointing it wasn't in the comments
like tom they just sent you so much
swagger sigh listen I'm okay to give
them shit razor
I want a heated mug all right I want a
mug they want to put it in there's a
poop emoji on one side and raise it logo
on the other that was posed to slump I'm
now streaming Resident Evil so let's do
this
oh I spent all day dude eraser of oxid
and then I just streamed now for 7 hours
9 minutes straight I don't think I left
this chairs go to toilet anything by
just finished Resident Evil biohazard
absolutely top game sketch your points
like characters and stuff but very jump
scary at the start then it just jumps
into like a Resident Evil shooting game
and then the end like is a twist well I
really enjoyed it if you're going to
play it I really recommend it like 7 it
took me a total proper like eight hours
to complete what GG's all around
everyone if you want to say hello to the
vlog just say hello now everyone say

who go at home you know about that
eating your dinner at uh what is it
nearly four o'clock in the morning
mm-hmm
miniature pizza and some chicken wings
I'm actually streaming h1z1 right now
and I'm hoping that my characters not
dead by the time I get back to it the
chances are it is
I left my character in a corner thank
god he's still alive ah my best game on
h1z1 second place is simple kills
what a fucking boost oh my god check
this out everyone's like yeah fucking
idiot but we got better and better and
better
hell yeah and I'm not going down
omnomnom this is my meat feeds pizza
what exactly call it a feast but sure
look at this little American thing yeah
keeps that yep see that
sun's rising I only just got done
playing video games this always happens
always happens I need to just stick to
vlogging doing shit all day and never
touch you my computer or my console
because as soon as I get on it late at
night I'm hooked on it I had a great
time don't get me wrong but I'm gonna
have to only have six hours sleep and
that's it I know it's like wow six hours
sleep
I'm one of those people if I don't get
eight well today was a fun day for me I
got a tidy up all this mess but I enjoy
them boxing all this I know it was a not
a day if you're going out being crazy
doing a lot of shit but I like sure I
like the days where you know I can set
something aside like today I'm going to
unbox and put off today I'm gonna do a
Q&A and then it gives me like the day to
focus on something else that you do like
live streaming or you know going up to
me ins that I'm not gonna be filming out
and stuff and I think it's a good way
for me to go forward in the future for
this so if you guys like the idea of me
like put out tweet saying like hey I'm
gonna do a Q&A or like it would I rather
sort of thing on a day to fill in
something say like the vlog where it was
like two minutes 44 seconds long I can
fill in it with something instead of it
just been like here here's two minutes
instead I can make it like the portion
of vlog I can but then feature a segment
in it like you know what I rather are a
QA or you just fun little things you
guys to suggest so with that said I'm
gonna go to bed now guys because it is 6
o'clock in the morning and here we still
may not sit and by staying up so late
