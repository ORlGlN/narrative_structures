to bed but nonetheless I'm passing out
knowing that it's been bad was it been
amazing to hang out with Alec today like
it's been absolutely ridiculous I felt
yesterday that when we redid the whole
event at e3 it was cool we played games
without together all that sort of stuff
but like I just felt like it wasn't it
wasn't what I felt like I wanted to
stand with someone and I make a wish so
luckily Thank You Luke you know who you
are I'm gonna put a snapchat down below
make sure your phone's lunch out I said
to Luke is like I want to do something
more that is like eventful and
meaningful and everything and as well as
it was like my thought of meaningful was
like doing something that you can't do
your everyday thing like you can go to
ether you can play video games all that
soft stuff so we agreed that got on a
helicopter tour of LA and just see the
sights and being together and sharing
that experience would be that sort of
like cherry on the cake so I felt like
it was amazing today
I like your amazing one whatever amazing
your uncle is amazing he came to pick
you up as well
but it was an amazing experience to hang
out with you and I can never thank you
enough for spending for spending the one
wish from make wish that you could ever
spend in your life on me I could not
express it to you enough it's an honor
and a privilege to be able to do that
for you
and I hope that over the two days it was
worth it because you actually go done
anything but like Monday if you don't
drink that fucking juice and yes I'm
swearing and yes you're 15 and people
give me shit but you're cause fuck and
we're cool as plug if you do not drink
the juices that you're supposed to do
which I'm supposed to do now I made it
if I could deal with you if we don't
drink the same juices we do on Monday
now come down to your house and I will
fight you respectfully but no Monday I'm
not looking forward to it any review
we're gonna drink the same juices the
same things to get you better to get me
better and just make the Sun overall
