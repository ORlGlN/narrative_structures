1 to 10 of cooking with you right now
yeah look good 3 what is the confidence
I have you know that I'm a professional
Baker all the calls done
I might inlet to do it first because you

the pressure is real quick before the
spreads
okay that's what that was a thin line uh
yeah pinky pinky
alright someone I'm guessing game poor
call comes next uh-huh and that's gonna
be yellow after that I'm kind of
wondering about the purple and yellow
being next to each other though oh oh
Nixon yeah because if they mix their
their opposite colors so they'll make
brown yo-yo yeah Tom oh my god
much impressed many while ten out of ten
cooking skills that looks pretty damn
impressive
yeah it looks better on camera no I will
say looks better high five yeah she's
got clean hands dude yeah but can which
mess we made though but this is this
well this is like this is like this it's
like it's like that thin but you roll it
up so it makes like a thick cake so it
should be fine oh we letting this sell
she's like okay so that's just waiting
for us yeah just mix all of it
and now we're making little cakes in
between so there's like different layers
of cause on this which is perfect but
now we should just make it like a zombie
one and put one of everything into one
except for the problem is we're out of
all the colors it's every yard okay so
we just done with yellow cake then yeah
a symptom cake and wish us luck right
really out of high hopes too low hopes
how badly do you think this is gonna
work
well you don't seem confident that the
ovens hot but okay that's why how
confident the scene is that we're doing
this again so we haven't film is already
a you that you've warmed up the right of
another wrong oven
well I'm very confident now is it what I
saw because you know it feels warm when
I open me up and is it gonna get like
super puffy and big biggest ones cake
I don't know actually I don't think so I
would assume not because we have to roll
it shall way to find out kind of see if
you don't I have yet to smell what it
smells like and I'm gonna breathe in oh

god oh my god oh my god are you

yeah roll it then okay I am I think you
need to push it towards in before you
roll it
Oh house often sponge is it I think it's
I think we've not done it long enough

the size of this entire thing rather
than Oh God this doesn't make any sense
