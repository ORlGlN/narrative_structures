to keep you warm in this day of official
holidays I'm trying to get a video like
I want to say like every day out buff
got my new Minecraft 2.1 just shoot one
video rendering it's like an hour long
so it's a bit of a long one for your
faces but I hope you enjoy it
so like how the intros like edit it to
hell when you see like these lines on
earth what I show you this is the
platform that I used to edit with so
Vegas Pro 14 and he took great 215 but
every scene one of these lines is like a
split of time but say you see this like
clip you see how it's like can it quiet
well where it's quiet where there's no
audio noise being made because these are
like me talking me talking me shouting
me reacting stuff well when it's a line
that's me me for being like quiet for
dramatic effect or like like I'm not on
the stream I pause on the microphone for
a phone call or something so you know
cut these things out to make it like
quick quick quick quick
and then it just starts to streaming you
can just tell I'm just obsessed with
playing the game throughout and then at
the end it just consists of a million
and ten quick cuts now for the record if
you saw the stream live on Twitch deep
TV for a syndicate that's like an
exclusive thing to be part of and be
watching so no spoilers if you're a

kitten I've ever seen in my life
sometimes I just think this cat just
doesn't love me so I think but then like
she always just like comes in my office
and cuddles me and wants to be where
I've been I don't know what that means
why she always goes where I've been it
might not mean anything she might be
like this is the only company spot in
the house but like I've got loads of
couches she can sit on there's like beds
she can sit on but instead she chooses
to sit right here if you ask me that is
one happy kitty cat right there look
she's purring like crazy don't the
camera can hear you but okay leave it to
sleep now okay
I don't think you'll pull my chair your
