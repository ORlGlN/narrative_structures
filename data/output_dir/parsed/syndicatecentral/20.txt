ramen noodle oh my god this is the one
the only the Dharma ramen of gods I'm
now gonna get one every damn probably
shouldn't say that mmm yeah this is one
of every single flavor that looks like a
rainbow but every single flavor that
they've got I've now got in my hand so I
got sesame seed duck flavor
I just know much you're really looking
forward to that prawns by Tom Yum no
idea I've got Tokyo soya sauce I got
pork
I got spiced spicy I got seafood I got
beef
I don't garlic again and I got Punk Otsu
that is enough actually if I've ever
seen one
I'm golden wrapped Bentley nice nasty
that is genuinely an amazing piece of I
was gonna say graffiti I don't think you
can cross it as that cuz it's so fucking
nice I'm really allergic to them but
still well it is incredible yeah well
just rolling down the street look at all
his artwork on the lighthouse
I already love this place a little bit
look at the seat into your like tables
and high tops and all that but we're
sitting against this right near the
weather prepare everything I love this I
need to come down to Manchester more
often I'm saying this now this place may
become my favorite place to eat in
Manchester it depends on if it's good
boy yeah this is their like signature
dish not like you know their go-to Robin
but this is this Dracula ramen power up
top
ton katsu with caramel has black garlic
mayo and garlic chips listen to what's
in it
12-hour pork broth ramen comes talk with
chassis barbecue pork belly and egg
mushroom spring onions sesame ginger and
seaweed
yes I was saying everything about this
place so far has been amazing
I don't always just found my first
downside not that I'm hunting for it but
I was like talking to Lydia and I wasn't
opening something start transforming the
receipt machines right for me so every
time they turn off an order it's it's
not receiving a very loud fax you make
the restaurant lose points
Epson you made them lose fine sock bun
for starters look in quiet noise
well loudest print applause Matt the
chef all the way from London at the
other restaurant they've come on Nellie
oh what a dope Dave all right he said
we're gonna be impressed with the food
still profession
it's pretty fucking good that's pretty
actually forgot what is this takoyaki
deep-fried hockey's that I said nice
thank you but thank you thank you deep
fried octopus balls very very amazing
pick yet again squid balls but it
doesn't taste fishy you think it tastes
fishy
I didn't taste fish yeah potato it
amazing but honestly incredible all
right mr. assaults introducing the ramen
dish itself a 12-hour beef broth pork
broth some extra bamboo shots shoots
back in English today Frank on oh is it
oh you ready for this a lot of pressure
that's pretty good so that is the meteor
version of this and I definitely say it
tastes better but with this with the
noodles I don't think the noodles I
don't know how they did it in a way like
Lydia said the noodles don't really soak
up the flavor so when you're eating
noodles or just kind of eating like
watery noodles do my chefs out there
when noodles are like stuck together
like this like in a hardcore instance
yeah when they're together in a hard
comply that what does that mean the pork
is actually an amazing and the juice is
just gorgeous just like that finished
all right
I I can't even pronounce the name of it
sure are you sure
char you I'm gonna give it a 9 I'm
giving it a 9 out of 10 because I don't
think anything will ever be nothing I'll
ever be as good as tats around but I'm
open-minded to it but it's very nice are
you gonna give the chef was awesome the
manager was officer I love Gaeta

thick you know a box of medicine by the
way you always know what to know off my
dad and there's a smiley face in the top
corner of it
although watchin Tomb Raider we've

completely different color

fort night scene ninja is the top tech

sick and as every day goes by I watched
ninja play fart not when I'm not playing

improve I will get better I will step up
