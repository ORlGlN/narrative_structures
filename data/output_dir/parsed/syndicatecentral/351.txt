just turned up at the airport and I got
my ticket was about to walk away luckily
the woman behind the desk said you never

going to buy one when I got there
however if I would have turned up there
without a ticket they want to let me in

get into the country let some I get it
came and now is Tom G or apparently my
name but Cayman Airways Grand Cayman

somebody left the shoe behind so story
time when I bought my ticket didn't say
online that I needed to return to like
gal the country I was just going to book
it was all sex is like a quick I'm going
to Cayman Islands was by kicking I'm
starting out later but didn't know that
I couldn't like actually get into the
country without a ticket so they spend
an hour behind the desk trying to
organize me actually getting another
ticket out of there and I was just like
this is taking so long I just went on my
phone went to Expedia bought a flight to
New York so I can just get out the
country and then I did it in like 30
seconds and they were like oh we just
try to doing this for an hour I was like
yeah I know
so yeah I'm good to go and went to get a
point I'm a window seat as welcome
cayman airways 12:15 it is truly
my gait hasn't voted yet and right now
I've actually managed to get my vlog
uploaded only here six minutes ago so it
was 20 minutes late
yesterday's vlog bought I got it off
before I got on the plane that the
win-win-win for me not looking good I
say that simply because they just turned
off the screen that our airplane in
flight number and my friend Damon on it
so many points against a beer with us as
soon as he's done we will be able to get
authorization to start boarding charm
this time PFA is doing security reaction
we are is doing a security check or
complain so what your logic relations
the constables where this is okay do
this on the hairline Armand you get a
free report so I definitely got a flat
bread under the introduced if it isn't
kpp
we're not gonna get sued for common
deadly dose not quite all the crevices
in the keys and then obviously I picked
up a a cave root it's their hopes out
there and I just found out if you do a
tour of it so lots of her I made you do
stuff
Kamin cricket Maitreya I have a man and
on this train oh my gosh did great it
was collection I've ever seen this is
amazing
we don't this one is not a really great
one uses a PTA movement you whatever
yeah BPA is the company that makes a lot
of what a lot of movements for a lot of
people easy and blue
well I'm actually all seven mile all the
way down acted by while or that revival
yeah I love how that name
every day
I am Legend
- oh it is humid as all hell here
because I'm a t-shirt scientist stick to
MIT but Ron is just in there going down
a car I'm going to catch a lift off him
to the airport because he's like like
what how was the way to say this like so
once a sports company he owns like a
beach rental jetski thing right next to
where I'm stopping so I'm gonna capture
whips off him all the way to the beach
which is not far so like five minute
drive and yeah look at this I could rent
a Mustang for y2 or or different Jeep
Wrangler I think tomorrow I'm going to
come back and check out the prices well
that's the dream and I might come back
in a few days also shot British Airways
just all that in background and that's
the drinks that is also the dream but
that's more convenient but this is what
he's driving for no money like twenty
dollars a stomach this is the main place
for people visiting yeah short cruise
ships
oh that's what a cruise ships cook yeah
right up in here as a bigger boat not
messing around
so this is this is this your easier gig
he what a prime location oh I like how
yeah of course you're right next to the
bar over here well this is brilliant
oh sweet mama she was funny right now
it's like 96 poker night all right we
made it we here we offend this place and
I'm pretty happy with this is a nice
looking room it was supposed to be one
bed but it gave me two through I guess
like one - including this one next day I
can sitting this one next deck is
leaking this one if I watch you I could
rent me out to someone cooking well I'm
pretty sure I just tripped the power in
my room and the reason for that is I
cook right look at this light when you
look at this light where do you think
the light switch would be I'm not going
to tell you I'm just going to leave you
in the comments just just let you guys
feel crazy about it but when I finally
found the switch and plugged it in and
try to get it working
it was just I know that light didn't
work this light doesn't work that like
that doesn't work and Eva does that one
so I did a great job done waiting first
one could be a fix it if they can it has
a very nice simple bathroom hello that
this is all nice to me it is dark out
right now so you probably won't see
anything I don't even know shit I don't
do I have a balcony I don't have a view
to see unfortunately I have a pool view
I'll get out here trap ha I made it out
so here's the pool this is one pool and
if you're through there is another tool
and then down there I think that's the
main reception area but we possibly a
restaurant down here somewhere where I
can get the food so I'm going to go do
that now Oh actually I'm gonna wait for
the engineer then we're going to go get
some food tell her I'm struggling with
everything like my brains completely
failed but that was so so awesome of Ron
to offer me the ride locked him up like
why would you take a ride off a stranger
the one thing is that I don't advise
anyone doing it unless you're a good
judge of character sort of thing and I
could be completely wrong but go right
up in it was a really nice guy and he
showed me all up and down the strip so
that was really really cool it's like
like a seven mile long beach but it was
actually five miles
like he said like he's been here like on
and off for the past 20 years so yeah
he's got like a it's got like ten jet
skis and boats and all this sort of
stuff a really really nice dude so I'm
trying to go get some food as fast as
possible and then I spoke to the front
desk
and the front desk said that they've got
a partnership with a scuba diving school
and they start scuba diving lessons
between eight and twelve so I'm
hopefully gonna go do that tomorrow
all right well expert it's 6:00 in the
life it was the lump I was just tripping
everything out and you I actually don't
think this hotel has elevators not
problem oh he goes what are they not
working wait a minute took her out

want some food I can already tell this
trip is going to be the trip I exactly
wanted I just like went to the bar

caught up in conversation with people
and grabbing a drink and stuff and I
just got talking to like an awesome
couple just about like what I do as a
job it was like when you tell people we
do YouTube as a job their faces go from

like the most confusion thing in the
world but nonetheless the Oscars are on

room chill out I'm not going to go do
anything crazy tonight just going to
relax there's a fish in the water

fact and I am
that doing my diving license which
should possibly take about a week so
that's a big amount of time to take up
but it is what it is I'm going to try
and get it doing and it should be all
smooth sailing from there as we have
lights ladies gentlemen thank God you
