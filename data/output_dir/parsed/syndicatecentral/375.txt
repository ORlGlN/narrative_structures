alright ladies and gentlemen it is now
good checks watch it is a two hours
behind so I can't function this morning
it is
12:03 I'm starting today you might be
like that sounds absolutely normal Tom
it would be if it wasn't for the fact
that I've only had an hour's sleep hmm
so luckily I don't just have the optic
friends in Chicago I have it
Alexis made you look buy zucchini over
here because basically I have no clothes
whilst I'm in town and all the optic
guys are busy today filming so I hope my
one no not my one ginger friend in
Chicago my second ginger friend Seth
comes first because his mother's is he's
my best friend and we were going
shopping for some clothes so right now
I'm wearing a second-hand car Duty top
and some Gym Shack pants all from Seth
thank you come all the way to Chicago
okay now you're now you're just out of
focus what is this ready why is this a
fried zucchini is it this just cucumber
no it's a soupy
welcome to a Maggiano's food review of a
zucchini it's just a cucumber thing I
only know what but I know it's the
zucchini but it looks like a cucumber
and the only reason I know what this is
is because of Daisy rapini I taste more
like batter then it does any of the food
inside it so it's actually pretty nice
well I'm devastated right now because I
got the most amazing clip of me filming
a guy on a choo-choo train driving
around a mall and I filmed it another
thought it was awesome and I saw a guy
in a Segway and I was like that is the
most amazing thing I've ever seen and I
wanna stop recording the guy no Segway
came over to me and Olivia did it and
what did I do
I followed the rules wellif all the
rules so far I got I'm now going the
hood and secretly film the guy in the
train because it's goals as fuck I am a
man on a mission to try it oh my god
there's a security I am a man on a
mission to try and find a train and
avoid scary yep I've basically found
heaven there is so many pop figures I
still don't have don't these are really
cool oh I don't have that Deadpool oh
I'm definitely not to get that one day I
knew I saw that you can get a Hillary
Clinton you know what it surprisingly
looks like a right this is where I look
at the back and I guarantee it says
trauma is written one
Oh what is hairs well too good on this
well rip Bernie Sanders they even have
five nights at Freddy's look at that oh
that's pretty
Armand I really want to buy DS but as
you guys saw I traveled out here with
like no bags already good they do box X
well that's just so convenient
Voldemort you have got him I really
should pick that up boy I've got no way
to take it back to the UK with me all
right I just need I just know I need
oh this is so unfair
who else can get out of Rick amore oh
wait Rick Rick Marty and Rick with the
portal gun okay then Laxus natural
oh my god they're trained when I retire
in life I want to be the guy who drives
the train at the mall I'm gonna go
before the security and his Segway rolls
up and knocks me out this music is
extremely loud roar oh no what Lex this
has not been a successful shot because
apparently all Americans are far as they
don't have any shirts in men's or kiss
extra-large yeah so they know none of
the t-shirts that I needed I only got
two when I need it like well how many
more days over here at nine I needed 90
shirts and I came up with two so not
quite a successful trip managed to get
dragged to a place called Nana's and
this is what I'm about to eat some
sketchy-looking fries with cheese on it
and this is supposed to be a hotdog
oh just got ketchup on it cuz you're
gross this doesn't want your cheese on
your phone no no have cheese on my phone
that's all my god yo cheesy fries are
the shit the fries with ketchup and
cheese we're good let's try a hotdog
that's a combination no no wait no is
there you want to wait no all right you
explain to me the benefit of the claw
this is how he plays holding new control
about this is not yeah right this button
right here is key so it it makes me
thrust and so I need to do that whilst
moving around have you always played
like this uh just in the new halo like
there's so many more things that you can
do so I need to be able to hit buttons
like on the fly so I used to just play
like this yeah I need to in this halo oh
damn whoa whoa whoa I guess the the
vision crew have been using me bedroom
well obviously their house they can do
whatever they need to do but check this
out this is really where I could do a
Q&A self something if I grab this camera
I could probably like a good Q&A for the
main channel okay okay we back at the
grind ladies and gentlemen I'm playing
some h1z1 I'm not streaming it because
it's like well it's not 824 in the mine
and that's completely it's 824 in the UK
but it is last Ober
it is 225 right now in Chicago and I'm
gonna show you guys what I got from
shopping today so let's take a look at
my shopping haul I feel like you're not
running Beauty women like okay so today
we ended up getting the iPhone 5 without
the holder like phone we had like their
hand behind it so you can see before you
focuses but this is what I got I got a
pretty good like jokey taste of clothing
I went there just for like underwear
socks and then blank t-shirts but I end
up getting this I'm of what and
obviously Harry Potter on it because
that's just absolutely incredible next
up on kind of the oh no this is a plain
one are just a nice plain Calvin Klein
gray t-shirt looks fine that's all I
wanted you know for going out because I
go out for like drinks or something
really upset guys 9 pairs of socks which
was the most extravagant buy I guess 9
pairs of Calvin Klein boxer shorts
because you know that's extravagant I
guess but let's get to the main event
where's my main event oh for God's sake
I think I left it in the store and what
time the other sales doing going to bed
two o'clock it's now a nearly four
o'clock which is pretty goddamn
ridiculous
however I did just place Georgia Dome
third with three kills so it was good
fun good games
I'm currently platinum
it just falls asleep well it's a new
dawn it's a new day and it's time to
start my day I ended up playing h1z1 so
about 4 o'clock in the morning and then
passing the hell out I am really
disappointed that my shopping haul like
I got the Harry Potter meme shirt which
is great but I had an amazing other
shirt so I think I might have to go back
to the mall and get it that I may have
left it in the car so it is what it is
boy I need to get a shower now and wake
up and start the day but that's gonna be
if my day ladies and gentlemen I am
really good because I did film quite a
bit of footage whilst I was in the mall
was having like a lot of fun like hang
out or likes it's good to see her again
everyone wants to know everybody like a
collaboration like last time she's
painted before and I don't know if she's
like she's busy or not so it's like we
can get together and do some my collab
you'd be really really cool but not
having a shower so I will test you guys
tomorrow for the next 8 o'clock make
sure to leave a like rating subscribe
and I'll see you guys then a ton of us
next day feeling much more fresh so
tired yesterday I'm just feeling like a
whole new man right now but don't forget
guys if you do want to meet me at the
gaming about I 68 I am gonna be there
also known as insomnia 60 I'm going to
be there I'm gonna be there every single
day and pretty much every minute of the
entire event is going to be spent just
like meet-and-greet with you guys
hanging out with you guys and something
that I really really want to do at the
event is like work with razor on getting
like a 1v1 cell so I can compete against
you guys because what I wanna be able to
do is walk up to the event pick someone
out the crab like you come a 1v1 me like
college you you're minecraft or or
whatever game is and then if you beat me
you come in like I don't know say like a
razer product or a syndicate t-shirt or
both or something like so it's still
quite a way away the event I think it's
in March or something like that on May
someone is you can tell I'm really good
with the days but I'm really really
thinking that this idea can be made
possible but either way sticking to the
basics I will definitely go into
insomnia 60 everyone has been asking
like crazy I'm going I'll see your faces
there make sure you get ticket links
down description details down
description I'll see you guys next time
