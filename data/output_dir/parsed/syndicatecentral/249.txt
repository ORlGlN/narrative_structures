RS is falling 24 horsepower it's got a
nicer set of wheels it's got a six
spoiler on the back and it's got the
stuff and start on the ignition so 24
years have been on this earth and for
the past two these crows have been
terrorizing my window yeah and
comparison look at all the spots of
blood and bird wings and stuff and then
compare it to this one that my dad just
I was like a perfect mirror dad that's a
blemish-free mirror so I've been on this
earth 8760 days old you again daughter I
know it and don't you know it oh you
again me fifty yeah yeah you're not 58
mate you know you're not okay then
here's okay
hello 78 I thought it was a bit too
confident with that one you've been
alive on this earth for twenty eight
thousand seven hundred and say for over
fifty thirty seven thirty years
twenty-eight thousand days you've been
alive how does that feel yeah I still I
feel good left in you got another 20,000

imagine currently no way because C is
gone end carries so currently 16 the
life all the time so he's now the Opel
spot racing ha ha ha I didn't I didn't

yeah I thought the whole which is Martin
away Steve actually uses cave that's
brilliant love you say it back well you
thank you that was so difficult
it show it I love you it even he went
right thanks such a carry grab that okay
so I would like our Steve managed to
make it in eternal but I'm convinced
once you get in you can't get out of
that thing like something I've got an
idiot it could but let's get it open I
took him out if you'd really gap under
there and it just just set the scratcher
before we can know where to go so take
you mouth and I like put it back in
again so if you wanted to go back inside
it you can like I'm not trying to stress
them out by taking it in and out of it
all the time but no mind I don't
understand why he's going in there and
then but just if you're in there's like
I'm not I'm just scratching for
construction floor so I'd love to bring
them out for a bit which I think a world
version and then put them back in
afterwards and see if it goes back
inside the tunnel okay mate we just come
out and play for a bit I think do doing
sweeteners the blog is uploading as we
speak and it should hopefully be on time
we think they've don't know yes for
Steven I'm going away okay and I won't
see you till tomorrow I don't know where
I'm going I don't know what I'm doing

decide to go in the cave that's on you
