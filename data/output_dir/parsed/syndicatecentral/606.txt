would you want to do that okay your
little harness on what do you think
pretty fun huh
I can definitely say that was an amazing
night sleep in this hotel but I made one
grave mistake I decided to open the
hotel minibar and get a glass of water
during the night literally it's glass
water but we're gonna see how much this
glass of water is gonna cost me now I
bought it oh God
I'm not seeing a price tag so that's
pretty much bad news for one bottle of
Voss water containing 375 milliliters of
refreshing h2o we managed to spend six
dollars so that in American dollars is
like what five bucks or something like
that oh okay that's a very sick
water hands down the most hipster bar
breakfast I've ever eaten at and today
breakfast I have some jam on a spoon
piece of bread bit of a bagel and some
prosciutto I don't use dashes hmm the
 this is a wellness bathroom
who's you what they've got down TVs in
the urinals damn
I just realize what this is this is not
TV these are cameras for upstairs what
that that's G so I'm sir here

spying on Jay right now this makes no
sense

peeing

TV and that camera is pointing at you so

like it's like leaving the kid in the
counties like let me come oh yeah like I
wanna cover John you know these are all
basically phone mounts Wow just alt for
an iPhone so it's like the GoPro version
for iPhones so for me massive thank you
to the guys at hitcase really appreciate
they just hooked us up with so much swag
for like vlogging on the trip and stuff
I'm sure look at all this why before I
get run over in the middle of the road
but you had to give us so much cases and
still feel like filming on the iPhone I
cannot wait to do what we're gonna do to
they're heading to the helicopter and
this little guy is absolutely out of it
look at him well this dog is more stuck
than me to get in the helicopter look at
him hey ready I feel again all the
charging equipment is too far waterproof
case shockproof case with a lens on it
like I think it's a fisheye right now
but I'm gonna change out it's just like
a normal lens or something just so it's
like ready to rock and roll
I don't know it came with this but there
you go got a little pole for it sort of
things I can get some nice little cool
shots and then we got the chest mount
unwell so let's get inside the
helicopter hangar not exactly the best
weather for it but according to these
guys any weather is good weather right
Rudd
just not gonna crash that's all
we'll be fine come on buddy he's ready
for his adventure look at him he's like
is like look at me like you little bit
you're gonna steal my seat again and
this is what we're gonna be possibly
doing today this is al Macbeth he built
this car no no husband no I had somebody
in there
mm back on his wheels I'm gonna put the
full link for this in the description
feel to check it out oh my god that is
insane what say thank you for everyone
being super active on the channel this
morning like when I took a screen shot
Brad was on 21 thousand subscribers now
is only only 29 thousand subscribers we
can definitely get him to like I reckon
you'll get like 45 capitalist good
ideally okay so huge in Japan can
awesome yes Tom on this trip has been
 wicked right now to see if Jeff
has got all the power and the strength
of he Mun look at him get his get the
dogs like what is happening this is so
dumb oh yeah yeah dude this is downhill
this is easier like you're gay this is
the easy job he did do it himself
yesterday so don't think don't think
you're doing anything impressive Jeff
don't you do anything impressive just
casually using a plane's wing as cover
from the rain
majestic right how many hours jerking
his dog's head in the sky
this dog has I would say Bentley's got
about 50 hours really yeah he's down at
least 40 flights with me oh if it did
I'm gonna go out to fist-pumping see you
pound it pound it
no no pound it yeah boys I got the
luggage for four take it in for a little
adventure I'm gonna look a little crazy
all day today but I'm going to keep this
chest mount on so I can touch that case
and then I'm gonna do like a POV kind of
style vlog throughout the day so it
should be pretty cool and if you turn
that well in today's vlog maybe maybe
tomorrow I'm gonna do it all day just
POV you look like this so you can see my
hands and what's going on I think you
might be pretty damn cool
ready for the next adventure Jay I'm
strapped Lagaan dude like this is so odd
having like extra equipment with me
because I'm just used to the one iPhone
and that's like simplistic as hell so
I'm trying to keep it as simplistic as
hell even more with just another iPhone
with more mounts and most of all up
we're good to the teeth right now
let's get ready get ready let's get rid
of rumble
whoo go pros iPhones go frozen more
cameras everything you need we have it
always German this should now be the
official POV rig a flying a helicopter
this is going to be absolutely
incredible so I've got my phone here so
I can take any sort of video like freely
to the side take any photos or some
simple app but then I've always got this
one recording so I'm thinking of doing
like a Dana live by a POV should be
pretty sweet right so this is like
stupidly sensitive so if you move it
like a tiny bit yeah so we're gonna do a
turn to the left yeah oh just watch this
Vic here watch a little this moves lets
you moving it and we're now going left
okay okay but that's always worked
actually right
okay so now if you see it do something
like this like straight sideways
yeah oh my god it's very reactive whoa
you can see it move you feel a whoo yeah
oh wow is incredible oh this is where
the monkey will talk he'll all click
away and that is where we're going up
this is where I'll set the original
world record Razer jump for 198 feet and
then like a week later I got beat oh and
then he tried to do a 220 spoiler and
that's the one that he landed on his
nose
line up in a way to anyone like oh my
reverie one night watched at one point
is officer pupcake Epps with the runway
1 minus mu 2 9 or 8 6 hit identify
include straighten oh yeah right
wow this is why I'd want a helicopter
just so I can just turn up to like
whatever I want with a mission and just
land in the backyard like dot it you
know start say hi but you can show up
and then you can go off this guy's right
you're going off this one right here by
the way ok this is the ramp you're going
up oh yeah there's this is vehicle this
is this this guy is gonna try and kill
us in this vehicle awesome alright
today's gonna get interesting
this is I'll welcome you face you see
the video you saw of the crashing car
was you okay okay so he's still alive so
I've got faith and hope it inside him
alright and this is his vehicle that
we're about to go from only they're up
this ramp and go flying 115 feet and
hopefully not die so let's do this I
trust my friends leave me dog daddy took
that oh did you do that but for me
though these dogs are so spooked out by
like why is this dog wearing human
clothes what is this it's gonna look at
them they're so they're so puzzled that
means that was that your mom she's going
on yeah wish me luck ladies and
gentlemen this is this is pretty damn
incredible this is like his racetrack
and sort of stuff that he practices on
which is awesome what call he jumps he's
got but uh yeah this is the smaller jump
and then that's the suicide room to
think he's gonna make it from there to
here to land on mmm
bring it on yay he's coming
that's a pretty nice buddy got caught on
your face is it yeah look at it oh yeah
just having a field day
just uh just just holy all fine
ready ready for a moderate for this I'm
ready for this

I'm so stoked but I'm like I can't
express Oh
genuinely generally excited I'm right

but guess what guess what this is what
the whole point of this bag is yeah look

miss the rum they would have just gone
straight into the side oh my

the first time I've ever seen ice spikes
in my life
ice tires even bad
how to transport you and all your
friends away you need to go right

my brother brought the glasses out wait
a minute I'm sure we're missing
something
wait a minute oh here he is dead of the
dead daddy their dad in it there
nananana hey what's up dude well there
was a vehicle I have a watch in life

the same time this is pretty sweet so if
I could take both that'll be even
sweeter well today's been awesome good
sir yeah thank you very much appreciate
lot and you too man thank you very much
your vehicle in your place is incredible
on the adventure begins again the
weather is but unfortunately
because the weather super shitty was
supposed to be going out on a boat on
your previous restrictions cancelled it
clearly so the boat was supposed to be
going on is like a stupidly possible
like a super bowl basically right a
super boat it's actually a jet boat it's
like a riverboat okay no I can do really
shallow water he's going to take you
ripping up through the Danny let me just
drop this down unfortunately the weather
is just as you can see he said he said
he can't you can't see anything super
shitty and it's super dangerous so I
think we're missing that one today but
oh my gosh what a day so far Canada is
just so majestic I think that's the way
to summarize it they do crazy calm
people nice people
you're just majestic thank you just a
majestic awesome person thank you for
your hospitality

you guys hooked up with Al when he took
me over that ramp I was just like man my

such a blast I'm just here you
guys scary it was amazing it was natural
I got I didn't think I was going to
scream but it felt good till we just let
it out you know as soon as I hit that
ramp I'm like oh boy actually I would
say you guys didn't scream you yelled

going fat one of the coolest things I've
ever done without now hi everyone that's
a nice black helicopter
oh what a funny looking helicopters a
weird as how I rather see guys looking
playing harmonica though right now wait

majestically gonna hit me in the face in
a second Canada yeah I used to work at
McDonald's like doing the fries but I

editing the vlog kind of complicated
because using the two phones when I
