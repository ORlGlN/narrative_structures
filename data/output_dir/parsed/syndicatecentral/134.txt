take it's not even giving me a 1% sign
or a time or anything so come back in a
minute and see what's going on I was
hoping that when I thought you having
this one she's like I'm up in all of it
there's no way you're gonna be able to
let's I see you're nauseous right over
the lens watch move - look Donna I know
this one

gonna she's a professional put a finger
over the lens oh she's like there's no
drop here
she's not feeling this huh no you just
want the light say that's what you want
little Ariel oh look at you little belly
she's she's so fixated by it
what are you seeing oh we're getting
there mom the day's panning out well
I've seen the baby I'm seeing granddad
after I'll leave you with Thom McCann's
coming around to the office and I've not
seen him a try to get old but I had to
ring the neighbor who owns the house to
send one of his builders to go down to
my granddad and say Tommy's gonna be
like I'll see you later
so that worked and the videos got an
hour and 20 minutes before it's uploaded
ye every day you can sit in your office
and look at that view look at that what
is that oh it's a plane I thought it's a
big-ass fly look at that just look at
that view I'm waiting for someone to
arrive in his room room put a little
fingers directly on the camera lens like
gunk everywhere I'm so happy I know
weird but like the other office it's
like you never saw the store so like the
scale of how BIG's indica Ridge '''l is
was like big but like seen it all here
really puts it into perspective great
always like seeing all the moat like the
merch in one room yeah no but I don't so
it's just mud the support you guys
showed cynic original is in Class A boy
is there it's indica original we also do
terrorizes much just because we do the
job he's fucking Murch we don't cut
corners if you bought you tubers sure
and it's trash quality tell that
youtuber to just tell them there's so
many youtubers you sell shit quality
stuff and like get the shit the print
looks crap the fiber it's terrible it's
falling apart the customer service is
terrible and I sound like I'm just shit
talking those people like don't run some
user was a really incredible merch and
its outstanding bought so many people
just use like Spreadshirt and just crap
you just absolutely
clap and I'm not a fan of it whatsoever
but here like Terrorizer is Donnie's
merch with like four different companies
and how he's come over to syndicate
original and we're doing his merch
foreign terrorises and guess who else
we've got mini lads bought me lads
website isn't done yet so we're waiting
on Evan a card to whip that up together
and then we'll start doing these BOTS I
think you guys have seen what his merch
is these guys designs from the shows
that we're still doing these are the
tropical one the combust this is a
pretty
that's a nice design you get damn sweet
so we got minis
we got terrorizes shredded this is
actually a fucking sick design honestly
we should have done some artistic
original you know we did the Royal but
that looks so goddamn good so you know
do merch for everyone but to finally put
a stopping point on my statement about
your youtubers much being bad I'm not
saying it as like a come over to us will
do your merch fee because we're not
doing it for everyone that's not what
we're out here to do but what I'm saying
is if you buy merch of a youtuber and
it's bad let them know in a creative way
no not creative constructive criticism
give this a good constructive criticism
telling them that it's bad cuz it's a
YouTube you don't wanna be selling merch
that's just shit and firing a pyre and
crap you want to let them know like hey
I bought the shirt off you other qualit
the print is bad the fabrics Farabaugh
you know it's got holes in it whatever
give them some constructive criticism so
they can make steps to change it because
you know they don't wanna be selling
share the end of the day the company
that sends it out they send it out
whereas me I have family taking care of
it so they make sure a proper a job a
proper jobs done and if you find a hole
in your shirt they probably did it on
purpose
No yeah what's that mum damn right great
customer support cuz who's the head of
customer support
yeah you know what mom I'll tell you
what we should do I'm gonna go get some
trophies with custom like you know award
ceremony names on him like best at
theirs are best at that and I'm gonna
give them away well it will hold the
trophy ceremony yeah I know the lineup
