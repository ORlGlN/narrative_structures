tall boy every dog deserves a present
and Chrissy's massive lean off a fox egg
all righty then lads and lasses were
starting today off again with another
late flog dog up on YouTube only 26
minutes late this morning I impressed
with myself you go into my bedroom
you're like why is it pitch-black it's
because it's like hot by 6:00 at night I
don't like our bed but we're starting
today up we're gonna go we'll see Chris
we're gonna go see my god dog soon as we
fishing my god door we're gonna go have
dinner at my dad's house because he just
rang me invited me my sister so that is
the plan for today ready let's do this
hot it's definitely starting to feel
like winter in the you Kenny and it's
actually riddling off as much as I love
like hot weather someone relax enjoy not
gonna beat you something like that I
really do love winter in the UK not so
much the rain but like when it's a cold
ass night outside I guess you get
beautiful sunsets and all you want to do
is get inside put on the fire and coals
you'll bring your house and not leave it
and soon as I'm really good at cozying
up in my house and never leaving it and
I'll take it I don't know I just like a
dog okay Alice has called my dad
straight out this free shipping if you
someone gets into cruise ship for the
next like 24 hours and if you could
understand anything I said that I've
been frat dad where do they determine
clothing line hooked us a salmon and
prom meal okay prawns oh just a potato
yeah there was no sauce and I thought
was a problem prawn
I'm a fan of thrones
they are immaculate no matter what
prawns always get a name you might have
but the salmon I'm not a fan of salmon
so on its own you ready for a bean hash
dad
some of the song is a sex true someone
with a sauce that's a seven so I'll meet
your part way because I don't like
vegetables 7.20 care to explain what
you're doing are you SOS flashing us
right now or something
my dad just wrongly walked in the room
turned off the lights and was like
that's cool in it how do you feel about
our Father turn to blinders you doing
some glare which shit what's going on
got the walnut uses of epilepsy going on
air
I so badly need to switch to a Samsung
little koala is like like it's so far
ahead of iPhones is ridiculous and
chemically so what you should do make a
bit orange you look at the Kalonji if
this is just a potato the one of this
looks so much better
we flicked the switch to reveal the
dragon hello mr. spy oh my god every
time I see just grow hello mate are you
doing I believe you've been a living
wage that's a spike ah Steve I don't
know what I said
spikey stick can we just pay attention
to how actually big years come don't
worry
oh my god I got you look at the size of
him he's huge
but what's that got some premium bitch
bitch okay you are literally the biggest
bitch dragon I've ever had in my life
keep being a dinosaur Steven because
that's what you are and a clock at night
what do I do
oh my god no no no aids no Luke is aids
well the answer would be go out to shop
and buy some lucozade z-- but you know
what I just I really want to chill out
tonight and I just want to play as sad
as this is to say I just want to play
black ops really not zombies multiplayer
and snacks consists of many potatoes no
they're not wait what the hell you got
mini pancakes
what potatoes one o'clock in the morning
right now I was just in bed absolutely
convey trades goods
even though I can't sleep because you
know the whole waking up at 5:00 p.m. in
the afternoon think our room asleep
schedule so as of officially this second
it is obviously the 30th of September
which means is my best friend Chris's
birthday so I'm gonna go deliver his
birthday card right now so when he wakes
up in the morning he's got it in the
morning and it can be like this son of a
bitch destination I'm pretty sure this
place is open it's supposed to be 24
hours so if it's not then tits on a
pancake but we are going to go and get
him a birthday card and obviously it has
to be the girliest or childish birthday
card ever so for some reason I never
actually get people like the cards that
they're necessary for like if it's their
birthday I usually get a happy 50th
engagement anniversary or something like
that but is Chris's 24th
now could get him a baby one but he's
got a baby so it kind of like throws it
off and does make sense looks like I got
the wrong card and I think there's like
a wedding one buddy's getting engaged so
I don't know about that so I'm thinking
we go like really really young like this
your for today I think I think this one
would make Chris very very happy
I even better there's a one direction
one which one would Chris prefer the
most
I think it'll have to be frozen I know
he's turning 23 and everything like that
and Chrissy's favorite thing these cars
so because we've got Anna clearly little
child card I'm gonna get him a jokey
little child gift and nothing better
than Lego so I bought him a Lego build
it as you can Racing car because into
his cars and it's like who the fuck
doesn't like Lego okay I made it I
filled in his card and I was gonna drop
through the Lego like I squished the
Lego as small as I could to try and fit
it through the letterbox
but I by the time I got to the call the
SEC everything and I was there I was
just like I really cannot be bothered
one waking him up to waking her up or
three more importantly waking the baby
up trying to push through a box of Lego
as like a joke I was like oh no I think
I'll pass on that so
I decided to leave them nice and
peacefully asleep I think no sleep and
just sketch Lia
what is it 142 in the morning I go and
drop a birthday card for Chris so
hopefully it puts a nice smile on his
face and starts his day off to a good
start so Giulio jabs time to rock and
roll let's go home yeah I think much go
for a drive though I don't go home just
yet we'll see we'll see how things go
it shames me to say but the Parma ham
just wasn't enough so on my way back I
took a stop they're my least favourite
place in the world
I love it what the fuck is going on in
my house all my friends I vote to
actually finish a blow and get up one
time now necessarily I didn't
necessarily end it on the correct day
but I did however get this vlog up on
time and I'm saying this for 4010 sales
topping it up it later either way but
nonetheless it's Chris's birthday today
so I'm not too short at all plan is I'm
