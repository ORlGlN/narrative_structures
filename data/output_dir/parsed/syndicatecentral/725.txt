amazing insane fuck Mason's yours yours
this is yours and I'm holding it abandon

put your hands there to make a
background so you know like blacksmiths

how about a good now the point is still
lying and the hot chocolate is still
rising so I'm okay with this testicles I
fell asleep in bed I'm so sorry I forgot
to edit the vlog and that's why today's
late so I apologize well well gentlemen
I hope you enjoyed today's vlog if
you're wondering why I didn't film all
david blaine stuff is because i like
politely asked me if you know you could
fill in certain things are not so film
certain things just because magicians
don't always want put it on camera which
doesn't make a lot of sense but like you
know you don't wanna give away the trick
i secretly catch on camera something
whatever there is they're doing because
it's pure wizardry there's no science
behind it's just wizardry don't question
it but yeah and so i couldn't film all
of it you know out of respect for him so
that was totally cool but it blew my
mind anywhere and i can definitely take
that off my bucket list of meeting david
blaine an absolute wizard of a magician
so that was absolutely incredible one
day yeah it's just a really great night
I went out there with Nick Luke ended up
turning up I don't know if I threw that
in the vlog and yeah just had a great
great time so if you guys have enjoyed
the vlog like she doesn't like rain
subscribe and I'll see you guys tomorrow
for a new void because tonight I'm going
to hang out with nadeshot go and watch
the McGregor fight so it's gonna be
fucking awesome adios
