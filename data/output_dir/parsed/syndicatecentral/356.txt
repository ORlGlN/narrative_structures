yeah just from bumping into each other
on a plane anything's possible I think
anything on service great reviews with
of the greatest guys I've ever met in my
life
what a humble nice human being as I'm
still good to leave the no disliking the
three-week undiscovered I'm saying
goodbye to a man while said goodbye I've
got a really cool idea which one not
going to be fun now I've got a really
cool idea about what I want to try and
show him what our community is capable
of so I'm not a certain now I know he's
going to watch this folks if you're
watching one you'll never find out this
year but I've got some really really
cool ideas but I've got a part of all my
stuff I've got to find a flight now to
get back home because right now I've
only got a flight to take me to New York
and I need to get from New York to
England and I don't want to cuss too
much minoccurs right now it's just so
expensive so alright I'll be back with
an update success alright so I am no
longer flying to New York and I am now
instead flying from Grand Cayman to
Miami International Florida
duh Krishan Mamet Miami in Florida from
there I am indeed flying from Miami
International to London from London to
Manchester so run let me tell you this
right
now this watch that you've given me is
going on a worldwide trip tomorrow so -
get a book much cheaper than anything
else I was going to find anywhere which
is great because just for one ticket to
get me from New York to Manchester with
looking at being like $2,070 of British
Airways which makes no sense so find out
of Miami saves me like like $2,000 some
reason I remember remember the cameras
