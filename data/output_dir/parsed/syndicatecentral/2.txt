Marks and Spencers might be my new best
friend I don't think I want to drink
alcohol anymore I was so hungover the
entire day but I tried to stream it and
I still felt long over like I couldn't
perform a fortnight or anything to the
point where I stream for a night
yesterday for like four hours right and
I got one win whereas today I woke up
fresh ready to rock and roll and I
managed to just play four games and I
want two of the four games I just played
now so record if you never know this
before I had to have a gaming channel
and I've just uploaded a new fauna
videos if you guys want to go check it
out I'll put a link down in the
description I don't like really
appreciate like 8,000 mics on that video
I was not expecting that in the
slightest but I'm really getting into
the game and what I'm trying to do I do
have something I need to tell you guys
about now but I'm gonna be trying to
upload on that channel every other day
like without fail even if I'm like
putting out like a very very random
gameplay video or something I want to
start uploading to me every other day so
that like the vlogs will still hopefully
stay on schedule like every day 6 p.m.
vlogs which you know this one was
probably like because I'm gonna tell you
what I'm doing now but I would vlog
every single day at 6 o'clock and then a
gaming video every other day and not gap
that time of gap it gives me the ability
to some feedback from you guys it's like
what game I should play what should be
posting cuz I right now could just post
for an iPhone iPhone that phone out cuz
I'm so addicted to it but I don't know
what you guys want to see on the channel
oh no my gosh can you tell we're home
already this place is an absolute tip
and I just you know what I'd like to
blame it all on video like she's so
messy but let's be fair this is my side
of the bed and this is pretty bad but
what I was saying is I've got to like
like announcement to tell you guys like
announcements announcements today I'm
actually going doing a make-a-wish now
these make-a-wish people are amazing
because obviously you know they grant
the wish of a kid or something like
whether it have been suffering from an
illness or like a range of different
things but somewhere again as grun in
has been granted a wish to spend a day
with me and every time this happens I'm
like why do you want to spend the day
with me like it makes no sense I'm just
Tom but this gentleman has decided to
make her wish to spend the day with me
and they've flown over from America to
Manchester and I'm going to hang out
with them so in tomorrow's vlog you'll
see me hanging out with them and having
a good time there and we're gonna go and
do an escape room so I'm pretty excited
for that but the reason why I'm telling
you about like doing these is because
I'm going down to Manchester tomorrow
and I'm gonna be down there like sorry
like tomorrow's like I'll be there just
for the day but in total three people
have done make your wishes for me like
I'm like what how is this even possible
so I'm doing one tomorrow and then three
days I'm going down to London and doing
a make-a-wish there that I'm travelling
to Cambridge and dude another
make-a-wish like these people can make
wishes of our go to Disneyland I want to
like me
Lewis Hamilton ray city's care or it
take me driving or just anything but
these people have like made that wish to
like just hang out with me for the day
not even like play games not even do
anything like write about anything it's
literally just kick it with me for a few
hours and I'm like sure like I feel like
you're going to be disappointed because
I'm just talking about that but yeah
like absolutely
oh no life without a doubt well these
people have asked to do a make-a-wish
give me so I'm doing to make your wish
today that you guys will see tomorrow
and then you know because I'm saying I'm
trying to upload every other day to the
gaming channel I want to stick to that
but I don't know how well I'm gonna
stick to it because I will be going
doing more maker which is in London so
yeah if you guys are watching this vlog
right now I don't quite know the other
people's names just yet
so I can't be like I'm it's happening
and I hopefully I hopefully I'm not just
spoil anything cuz that'd be awkward
well all the way from America all the
way to England to hang out
for the day so I'm gonna go down there
do this escape route and I swear you're
gonna see the vlog tomorrow I'd be like
Tom you're an absolute joy and I'm like
I know because even in like Minecraft I
can't do puzzles so dude a puzzle game
in real life ain't gonna work so me and
Lydia are going hanging out with them so
it's gonna be a really fun day boy yeah
I can only apologize for like being
hungover and just the vlog being super
late like super short and stuff like
that but I literally did nothing and you
guys know for the people who are like
the hardcore viewers you see me going
off to Hong Kong doing like 45 55 minute
vlogs and stuff like that it's epic and
awesome but then like when I get home
you know I'm trying to straight I'm
trying to like get on with things like
doing the vlog in the streaming and all
that to the point where I'm going to be
setting a schedule so I need you guys to
answer me the question for my schedule
do I streams I want to try and use two
hours a day streaming but obviously it
may like run late but I'm thinking do I
stream from 5 to 7 from 6 to 8 or from
7:00 till 9:00 if you guys could like if
you want to leave a comment about the
daily vlog or anything like that and go
ahead but if you want to like let me
know a time as well I'd really
appreciate that support I think I might
actually put a pole link down in
description so if you want to click that
and vote which is the best time for me
to stream so I'll be streaming like for
9 maybe some minecraft maybe some
zombies and stuff haha but I want to try
and stick to a schedule and now
obviously I can't commit to that
schedule just yet because you know I'm
going off traveling like I said so it's
like I'm wanted I want to get on this
like like grind but I'm gonna be
traveling so it's for a good cause I'm
gonna do to make a wish so yeah if you
guys could help me out with that I
really appreciate like work out which
time works best for like most of you
guys and then I'll get scheduled on the
go but guys thank you very much for
watching make sure you leave a like
rating subscribe dig down the
notification bar and I'll see you guys
