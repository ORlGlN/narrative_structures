like what are those
well these bad boys are actually my
mountain biking shoes so this was why is
squeaky this is German we're going on a
bike ride me my dad going on a ride I do
have my GoPro but I don't think it's
charged because if you remember when I
was drunk last weekend and we were
filming this happening and my friends
started recording with it so I'm
assuming that she might be dead let's
try is it is it I think it is was about
to go in this helmet which is my old
Donald mountain biking helmet but then I
was like oh my gosh I forgot I have this
one oh oh whoa like what the hell when
it came out now this is what I call sexy
this is my awesome carbon-fiber Fox
helmet you could tell all my clothes
skin was black and green to go with my
my orange over there
you know it's called it orange green
don't go worry about it but we might
start getting black and red from now on
because I do like this whole scheme
doesn't quite match the bike I turned it
for my electric bike like yeah that's
like a looking I'm like what is like
look here I'm like what I look this way
I'm my dad's borrowed one cuz where's my
drunk friend wasted my GoPro battery
will be messing around for ages way too
long that let's go come on
it's 93 o'clock now anyway cuz he wasted
the GoPro battery we've messed about
putting them out on this rap then on the
side of a helmet which I already have
I'm so I could try and do a little bit
of the filming with some riding but
we'll just have to see how things go
after what felt like a surgery from a
dentist the GoPro is now mounted on this
is a pretty solid angle to be fair I
should be able to shout to it and you

fun it's just looking like I was having
fun until you came though I have to make
sure I shut the door otherwise that
motherfucker
we'll escape and run and hide it might
be completely wrong here but I could
hear scratching there so that was either
that fallen over or if I go into my
office

has indeed kicked over his plant so
that's fine he's dug out all this sand
again I don't know what I don't know is
he's not hot enough because he keeps
digging up his heat map so I can't tell
where he's trying to get closer to it so
it's hot what the hell is going on with
you but I can't tell if he's digging up
his heat map like a shitload to get to
it so he's warmer or anything but other
than that it looks absolutely fine look
at the coal room he's beautiful

6:00 a.m.
coz that bike ride any went from my
daytime to nighttime on the ride like
I'm exhausted but oh I had a double
nosebleed that that's what I look like a
weirdo and I'm eating cheese like just
slices of cheese hot well with that
that's that's what I do with my life
attractive right oh my gosh this may be
the greatest thing I will ever vlog can
you see me skydiving helicopter riding
all sorts of shit by you my face off it
is currently 2:30 in the morning and I
have something to show you I decided to
go on just eat like basically the eat 24
of the UK and see what foods available
for me to buy at this moment in time
2:30 in the morning I said what could it
possibly get and ladies and gentlemen I
managed to find this place called cake
away why this exists I have no god damn
I did but I was like what is there gonna
be on the menu at 2:30 obviously can go
McDonald's are like maybe fast-food like
Pete's or some other but the only thing
that was open only thing was a place
called cake awake now this place
delivers a no joke like um oh my god
big-ass milkshakes you know like the ice
cream that you get called screw but like
the screwball scramble whatever is all
screwball Scrabble
that is basically a screwball Scrabble
look at it then there's the bubble gum
so that's a badass milkshake that I got
delivered to 3:00 in the morning then
and I got what's this was this no ice
cream what I don't know why I got around
a box of ice cream but yeah sure
and then and then this is the mate this
is the main thing that I ordered I would
love to show you the menu book Kusama

oh wow you another wrong logo on the
waffles

delivered to my front door at 2:30 in
the morning this is amazing might be the
most amazing take one set wait wait wait
wait wait is this one oh the waffle a
Belgian waffle warm delivered to my
front door however I only just found out
this exists like it I've never used just
eeks that I was always like I'm I use
eat 24 and unfortunately it's not in the
UK yeah I think you know and you can
usually get them like salmon dinners and
steak or what an actual restaurants food

figured just eat might have the same
version of that kind of like you know
for meals but when I looked through it
it was kind of just I'll takeaways as I
mean whatever um but they saw that I was
like there's no fucking way this is
gonna be good so I decided to give it an
