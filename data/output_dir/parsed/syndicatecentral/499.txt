it outside so I'm just gonna have to say
it's a risk were willing to take camera

go to bed get about two hours extra
sleep soon as I got up so early I can
guarantee that I can not guarantee I can
feel comfortable going to bed for a few
hours get up and then start my get day
again let this be known the only reason
I'm wearing these shoes
because these ones are soaked work
through from going shooting so yes
pretend you never saw me wearing only
just got this carwash last week it's
filthy
this burp all over it this is the crow
was getting the payback because they

gonna snack on these dad if you're
watching this I did not told room I did
about you news but I've now got 50
minutes to get my vlog edited I've got
to film the GoPro when I'm out biking
but I have to export all this separately
because it's broken corrupted footage
for some reason when I use my editing
program so I've got a quick lab the
mountain biking clips into it and we
should be good
yesterday's vlog is now editing it's got
60 minutes before it needs to be up no
way that's gonna happen all the GoPro
footage like all this was super corrupt
I need to find a way of fixing this
problem fifth visit and arrival to my

empty glass Cheers go cheers Cheers
oh whoa oh whoa what's the my week Steve
why what's over you that's the first
time I've ever walked in here and found
Steve looking all observe pissed off are
you so dark mate what somebody had a
quickie jumping on you or something come
look
so his beards not supposed to be that
dark look at it can I look well hungry
I'm kind of confused to be honest let's
talk about Wednesday more talk about
your fashion choice of sandals indoors
what are those figures he'll figures
need to figure out what's going on in
life take them off
Crocs were bad enough I don't want to
know I don't know okay don't want to get
out yet it is wet rainy and even more
wet okay you may go go go flat very wet
oh my god I need to be quiet I've given
myself a headache oh actually no yeah I
did give myself a headache I just
realized I was like laughs I got this
bad headache all day probably from not
wearing ear protection firing shotguns
from like this close oh wow with my
incredible headache I decided you know
what it's time to cane bed watch Netflix
and do nothing else with my life I
didn't I went to bed and actually I've
now got flu overnight like somehow
picked up flu from being out in the
field or whatever or however the hell I
got it but I've pretty much got flu
super bummed or hate it but for everyone
wondering like what was with like the
whole shoot in why didn't we see all of
it and the plan of action is I want to
make it's like a main video for my
syndicate project channel and like like
the slow-mo clips all that sort stuff
like I think if I have edited in because
I need to finish this video then add in
the GoPro footage afterwards so
hopefully I put in some shots like maybe
one or two of those shooting things but
the rest of it you can be like cool
slow-mo that I'm gonna put together for
like a maybe two three minute video for
the main challenge just to see if people
like it if you want me to do it and just
see how it goes from there so sorry that
people may have thought this was going
to be the entire slow-mo video that's
not the case I want this kind of be like
the behind-the-scenes of my like
day-to-day life and then if I'm
producing something to go
the main channel cell thank you for
understanding so there we go
tomorrow's vlog we're gonna be flying
down to London I think so that should be
pretty interesting we're gonna go to a
test drive the Jaguar SVR on the track
so that should be sick go charge of all
the GoPros and I think I've got my GoPro
5 coming tomorrow as well so thank you
