it is currently 4:50 p.m. in the evening
the Sun is going down
I'd have only just started my day I've
got a say probably not the smallest of
decisions forget about it the vlogs
finished let me show you how long this
is gonna take to upload welcome to the
behind the scene process of how to do a
vlog with Tom okay so you go pay you
click this button if you've ever used
YouTube in your life you know exactly
how to do this you click upload then you
wait you look for this you click that
and boom how long is it gonna take
what what the number just goes up and
I've got less than an hour before it
needs to be live God name it'll be fine
it'll be fine don't worry about it also
today I'm trying something a little bit
new you know the iPhone XL hope I got
that was good the quality is better well
the front-facing camera is a potato
watch yeah you might be like now you
still like the same time you still like
crap hahahaha if you compare it to this
footage now this is crisp 4k 60fps so
when I move and stuff it should be
smooth it should be sharp and it should
be beautiful but usually what I do is I
flip my camera around and I can see
myself on my screen instead let me show
you how and volume I'll hold my camera
like this and if I'm filming myself this
camera will be facing this way instead
so you know this is what I look like but
instead this is what I'm currently doing
I'm facing it the other way around so I
can't see if I'm in the frame of the
camera and this is what I look like so
you can see yourself or I can see myself
so I don't even know if I'm in the show
I've just got a wing get and hope you
guys can see me properly I don't know if
that's gonna work I don't know if that's
a failure but you know what I'm just
gonna keep it a go we tried the g7x
camera and dropped it I broke it stupid
decisions were made cost me 600 pound
that did but you know what this ain't
robbing this he says before dropping it
but yeah this this is gonna be an
annoying process of attempting to vlog
I'm gonna try and see if I can pull it
off because it's not too difficult just
to turn my phone round but it doesn't
feel right but I decided to take all the
4k footage off my phone onto my computer
and usually when I do that that process
usually takes like 10 15 minutes but to
just take off those clips I've filmed so
far today that took to take all this off
about
20 minutes to takeoff 2 minutes with a
voyage from my damn phone
so ridiculous amount of time it takes to
do this however the quality of the
camera looks superb ly better like look
it looks so much better
however in low lighting so say if I turn
this lie off it looks all grainy and/or
like not quite nice
or as if I've got light it looks really
good but this process is gonna take
forever to do this vlog so I I don't
think I'm gonna keep this up forever
maybe rarely if I know like I've got no
plans the next day so I've got the time
to edit it cuz this is gonna be a bitch
to edit and if you're watching this vlog
right now make sure you smash that like
button this is the dedication we're
giving to the vlog we're trying to make
things crispier and better I don't even
know by the way and you know I said I
would took 20 minutes to take off 2
minutes worth of footage from my phone I
don't even know how long it's gonna she
recheck now how long is it gonna take to
render 4k at 60fps oh my god this is
gonna take forever for a two minute
video why am I even trying this and for
a bit of knowledge few faces for me to
render out the vlog as you guys usually
saw on a normal basis in 1080p 60fps
that usually takes me for about a 10 to
15 minute video about 20-25 minutes well
of a look at how long this is currently
gonna take for just a two minute video 8
minutes to render a two minute file when
I finish this vlog and have to render it
I'm gonna have a heart attack
there's no mic you just stay still stop
stop going up you keep going down keep
going keep going
it went up again oh this is good I don't
think I'm gonna be filming in 4k for
much longer I am NOT a fan of this
oh my Twitter just consists of people
sending me pictures of defenders and I
love it but let's go over here real
quick again for an update a technicality
stuff to render out 2 minutes worth of
footage it talked 13 minutes in 24
seconds oh my god does it even work oh
it does oh oh no it it's broke either
way I'm gonna try and upload this now
and see how long it takes to upload a 4k
file which I'm gonna tell you right now
is gonna take absolutely forever what's
it gonna say 202 minutes with the
footage 10 minutes my ass you go I'd
keep going

got I've got it set to 4k but obviously
I can't film with this the back camera

chill out
I found out someone was doing this to
Luna and Gadsby I turned up to where the
person music was meowing and give him a
slap that's naughty
yeah I will be in tomorrow because she
needs a bubble hop off you okay
put that your honor way right Darren
look after yourself we're going to a
place where we can't say where I'm going
because apparently surprise I've been
trying to keep it a surprise but I don't
know if I bet you told me on yourself
okay bye high-five okay okay bye
okay nice nice sucks like that what are
you talking about Shh ah damn look at
the beat don't know if you can see
anything at night like I said filming in
4k makes it almost impossible do you
have cats and when you change your cat's
litter tray they pee and poo where your
old one was well my name is Tom and
here's your answer it's simple when you
remove your old litter tray simply buy
another one so it's ready to go
instantly that way kitties do not poo
where you left them like no joke the
problem like we have when we're like
changing the litter tray for the cats so
I try to do it every week but when I
would move the litter tray what I do is
a disconnect this hood and put the hood
on the floor and then go off and wash
the thing in empty it what the problem
was is that the cats would that even pee
or poo in this spot where the litter
tray was or pee and poo inside the hood
so now instead I was like why don't I
just get another litter tray so now as
soon as I moved that one that one's
ready to go and you know there's no
place no moon in the wrong place they do
the business where that meant god damn
efficiency ready to rock and roll I can
hear you coming as well there's a lot I
heard I can do a fresh poop on the floor
no no no no no no no not it not on the
floor you do it in there would you look
at that we have our first customer yeh
cap tips with Tommy this said 99% of you
probably have a normal cat that just
waits for the little chat tray to be
changed rather than shitting on the
floor where the lip tray used to be so
if you suffer from the problem we suffer
with Gadsby do what I did it helps and
just like that I've managed to finally
remove all the 4k footage off my phone
which by the way my vlog usually films
about 1 to maybe 5 gigabytes of data
filming this video as so far is like
what 12 minutes long that's filled up
like 60 gigabytes on my phone rather
than a 5 gig all day so what's going on
here right now I used to do is transfer
it onto my phone and it took a whopping
hour to move all the footage off from my
phone to the computer I've managed to
edit it together and the test I did
earlier to see if the video even worked
in the first place like what if I
rendered
video if it works and two if I uploaded
to my youtube channel if it worked
turned out worked perfectly so this is
me filming part of the vlog earlier so
it was a bit of law exception but as you
can see in the playback when I had it on
my computer it was actually like like in
and stuttering and I just think it's cuz
I've not got a 4k screen or just
something's like not properly like
working right on my computer to have the
playback at 4k but as you can see we've
currently got it set to well that's
actually to cable even in 4k but man I
managed to get this uploaded and it
looks absolutely gorgeous it works
so I'm hoping that I can start rendering
this video it's gonna take absolutely
forever so I'm gonna get it rendering
overnight upload in the morning and
hopefully hopefully have it uploaded on
time for you guys so if you upload it on
time if it looks good in 4k
make sure you smash that like bone I've
gotta admit I really really tried with
this vlog to make it work and I just
really hope you did it if I'd love to I
would love to do this every day in 4k
but you've seen how much time like if
it's at my computer in front of my
computer like 4 hours
EDA this video trying to get the
rendering right and even uploading it
and I've not even started the final
render and the upload which is gonna be
like 2 or 3 hours to do that as well so
it takes up a lot of my data form in 4k
if I can work out a way to do it quicker
like transfer the files upload the files
quicker then I will do but nonetheless I
really tried today we'll see if in the
future I do this against like maybe a
special event where I want to make sure
the quality is tip-top no like say if I
go and do something like I like
amazingly epic I'll filming for ok but
now we'll see I hope you enjoyed it and
that's that good thing about this is
when the video footage has been like
transferring onto my computer I've been
able to play runescape in the background
so you better know I got myself back god
damn 60 crafting but no it's a job I
would go to bed now thank you very much
for watching I know this was a bit of a
weird vlog in the sense of all I've been
doing is sat in front of my computer all
day I should probably put a bit more of
an epic day of going out and everything
but we've been lazy my or take it easy
we're chilling before we go on our
adventure off to another country on
Tuesday again I've still not announced
where we going we're supposed to be off
like two days but we may be extended
trip and we're talking about going to
maybe Thailand and China so immediately
they might be doing a hell of a lot of
goddamn traveling will I be doing it was
in 4k on the move
probably not so we'll stick to 1080 60
FPS which leave like rate and subscribe
don't forget we'll get yourself a
certificate original sure links

syndicate and I'll see you guys tomorrow
at 6 p.m.
