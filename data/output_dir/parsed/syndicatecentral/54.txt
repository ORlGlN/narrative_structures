Oh
what can you do this
I'd say this right now you have to go
and see circus I like you have to go and
see so absolutely incredible
I love you I love you glad you I'm glad
you all my next time my brother I love
you yes for sure next time we will fly
safe and see you again brothers actually
timed how long do you take me to edit
today's vlog and so far I chopped it
down to 17 minutes of 45 seconds with me
just leaving the circus obviously I need
to do this out to an obscene book all
these clips trimmed up until this very
point took me for 50 minutes on the dot
pretty happy with that it does
definitely take me longer when I'm
playing like runescape on the side but I
decided you know what I'm not actually
gonna play it on the side I'm gonna get
this edit done did it in 55 50 minutes
so at all I'd say it takes me an hour to
edit this blog for those asking and
obviously depends on they learn for the
clips and stuff for this is a pretty
good example of it unless I've now got
to start the render and the upload which
is about another two goddamn hours yeah
actually no that's when I'm back and you
get it's probably gonna take me half an
hour to render it and five minutes to
about it so you know what
once that's done pack the bikes get
ready to fly home tomorrow and that's
gonna be the day so guys I hope you
enjoyed the vlog if you did make sure
