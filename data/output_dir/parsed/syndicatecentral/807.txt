Twitch imagine that would be fucking
awesome literally risking missing my
flight to LA for a Burger King I'm
hungry the plane can wait chicken bacon
deluxe with fries and a bottle of water
for eight quid e taking a piss pot the
red card this is a nine and a half hour
flight that I'm taking
so I upgraded to first class for 90
pounds steel okay time for a food review
and where's the chicken for the record
this is really good well not go I filled
it confident knowing it's one of the
newer planes hopefully fingers crossed
it's actually one of the new planes or
like HD TVs up TVs on it and I've know I
sound like such a diva every time I fly
but usually Virgin Atlantic planes of
potato screens on them but I'm not stuck
HD so fingers crossed
well I was right this is a hell of a
potato Blanc wait 12a this is me for the
record I have no idea what more
microphones do make those weird noises I
recorded a bunch of clips on play and
none of them
it sounds like like I want a helicopter
or something so apologies I honestly
have no idea what causes that kind of
noise on my iPhone right now I'm
recording with like a microphone on the
headset so hopefully should fix it in my
phone's probably broken but either way
I've landed in Florida to connect to Los
Angeles where of all the crocodiles I
was told crocodiles
well disgust you are forcibly
well that is definitely unfortunate I
kept the intake clip in there just so
you could see how ecstatically happy I
was for David being the legend that he
was David is the absolute man was
basically seen is that is his cute
member to go and see my was there they
came action out there I told him
specifically like where it wasn't where
to look you went back they looked they
couldn't find anything
David the entire time was at the desk
talking to me about like people losing
stuff and it was just a really awesome
guy and I was genuinely gonna just say
to him like you seem like a really
really just good guy a good guy super
down-to-earth and just super chill and
super nice I never said anything we just
got talking he went I'm gonna go and
check so we went out of his way
spoke to his curator went out of his way
to go and check the plane and came back
not only with my wallet but with someone
else's wallet as well so not only did
the staff not find it David found
another persons so he's not just made my
day he's made someone else's day even
better so David if you're watching this
you're an absolute awesome person I if
the world was full of more people like
you then it'd be an amazing place to
live and honestly thank you very much
you sir are the man of the day so I'm
gonna wrap up today's what guys thank
you very much for watching David I
didn't send this in that last a little
clip what I did is I got his telephone
number song it's contact detail and I'm
gonna send him out a swag package of
just you know some cool gifts just to
say thank you because he went the extra
mile for me so I'm gonna go the extra
mile for him and just show that like
that a little bit of human kindness that
I didn't need to show was very very much
appreciate so if you guys got some
suggestions of what I could ship him as
a little gift to say thank you then
