amount of them in the world ever and the
first to exist I didn't get one of them
wrecked my own company I got bored while
stars inside trimming up there so I
shaved up all my sideburns again I don't
know man they're just not growing good
coding good luck football all right so
now back on the left let's watch roll
the shadows I'm wrong
ask him that as well I think it's Rawls
next week where do I park you don't get
nothing but incident in dunt dunt dunt
dunt dunt attention so Argos or a gas
person I don't know I says I don't be
that guy oh yeah I know that respectful
here we go we've made it we're doing a
bit of a tour
not because it's his choice on my choice
because we're treating you
yeah there you go I don't know what I'm
doing here but sure yeah for Bob no
really I have no idea about football so
mm-hmm I was reading it and this is
crazy
I'll talk about a plane crash and only
nine of the team survived I have heard
of this before but obviously they just
don't follow football I just don't
really know much other that what about
you same from the troubles eat well that
looking a new okay now we it now that's
what they used to play literally just
leather and metal now it's just
progressed from all this - just like the
most futuristic things in the world well
they're still just shoes not Denson and
brilliant sure this is cool though all
the units out uniforms don't on talking
about is what I call progression and
then this era of shipping this is the
most modern one nice that's the one
that's the iconic one I remember this
the most then any out of any DS that's
the one I reckon has been awesome so -
everyone wondering why I call the chef
at the grapes
where's right it's because you look like
the football player
where's Brown nicknamed wet when he was
dead dead skinny where's Dennis like it
looks just like wet Brown that's why
we're nickname he went I didn't think
named him where's someone else did what
that's why we always called him when
people forget about in scope where don't
forget about this but that is the origin
of even hell being called wet
okay
I don't even know what the offside rule
is made
I don't know football he brought me
I don't know I'm here alright this is
now 31 on the group no idea what would
you in it but I love it and some in
support of it honestly I just I never
got laser football so I just didn't
really care for it I respect it
hearts are tough but just don't care for
it 16 you can literally a preview screen
right there I can see what you're doing

be a dad soon the computer will be a
veto I'll hear you over here girl turn
