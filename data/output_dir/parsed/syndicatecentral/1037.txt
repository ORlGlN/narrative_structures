I finally did it I got an iPad I kind of
suck it into the whole consumerism thing
or whatever it is
I know besides can I but I'm not totally
sure weighted it but someone like me
uses Twitter stuff without like kind of
seems you know sensible to do so I had
to finally got one pretty happy with it
it's in my hand it's very big some trial
that's like the vlog on it so it's kind
of like big sweaty movement I slightly
do on your screen it looks like I've
told you entire world so I apologize for
that
and yeah just wait to give it a test run
you know this gonna be on syndicate
central and I gotta put this on the main
channel
this is like the vlogging you know like
the whole vlogging bit that I said I was
going to do on this channel which I'll
be doing a lots more of you know because
now I've connected on the phone to
YouTube and my iPad to you about to do a
lot of blogs and load them straight away
I don't know I look so white the outside
isn't isn't crazy like I think it's the
brightness of everything but erm I shall
worship or yeah there we go I don't I
don't want crazy right now on everything
but yeah it's going good and I'm back to
finally making songs again don't tell I
want it's a secret this video was made
for you no one else so yeah I and got
the zombies video done today I'm gonna
get loads made more today as well for
the future and so he said with me being
there like the rest of the day like oh
no what we're going to do I've actually
got videos ready for you and as well as
some multiplayer I've just got Ricardo
modern warfare 3 I'm doing some open my
B's and everything like that and one off
they're free for you guys to jump in and
girls guys and girls because I know
there's four girls on Twitter as well
you keep being like your depth is in
your videos or whatever so I can't a
camp like that anymore and so also what
I'm going to do is with the Twitter that
Ivor you know I always say follow me
follow me follow me
well I'm Twitter now if you do follow me
I always pull out like when I'm playing
and stuff like there's no point asking
me if I want to play because that's
usually when it the times when I'm not
saying I've got you know I can open
lobby going that's what I need time to
edit and stuff all that so if you guys
want a chance to you're jumping on my
multiplayer with me assemble our modern
warfare 3 are zombies beam whatever it
is I need you know are you guys want to
jump in on then bombings do follow me on
twitter the link will be in the
description as it always I think it's
like here nowadays and so yeah go click
that and then you'll be able to like
find my Twitter and then on there you
can just follow me on there and probably
a cool thing to do Twitter you can find
I don't understand why people don't
always have Twitter and first place
because Facebook to me is like died off
I used to use Facebook like quite a lot
but then I just like I changed my mind
just like Twitter's such a such a better
place just because you don't have to
deal with like everyone arguing on it
all the times to fly then again there is
always YouTube Twitter drama gaming beef
because I think here's the gaming
community that causes the most trouble
on Twitter I think I can easily say that
hands down but opening up that's pretty
much everything I'm gonna go into too
much detail on who causes trouble or who
doesn't that's everything I hope the
quality's not too bad if the iPad this
is just a front-facing camera I probably
try the you know the other camera soon
just to see what that looks like and
yeah let me know what you think about
this and if I do some more vlogs like
this style of me just like sign my chair
doing a lot vlog with this guy and this
guy just sat there that's my sister's by
the way so it's not mine I know that
others might there's my stash of games
if you want to see them I don't know if
you can actually make any of them out
but there they are so yeah it's pretty
much everything guys I hope you enjoyed
this video and I will see you guys later
on
