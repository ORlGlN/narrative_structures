was supposed to stay awake and edit his
blog and he hasn't done it it might be
one o'clock in the morning but I have
yet to do my blog and edit it and finish
it so until that's done I ain't going to
bed the grind is real boys do bet
reference to the end here just to let
you guys know why did I go silver why
did I go gray for diabetes like what the
heck Thomas is like super random now the
reason for this is because this is like
the color of like the ribbon the
awareness of diabetes and this month
November even though it's almost over is
Diabetes Awareness Month so I wanted to
bring a bit of attention to it and just
to kind of like educate you guys a
little bit on what the heck
diabetes is now diabetes always has the
stigma and stereotype of it being like
oh if you drink loads of sugary drinks
and you eat loads of candy then you're
gonna get diabetes and for Taiwan
diabetes that's not the case it's
thought to be genetic and it can affect
you know its bond with children so some
kids can grow up throughout the entire
lies get to a certain age and also and
find out they have it for them being
weak or you know loads and loads of
different symptoms but now for research
they can detect it like as early as the
age of watches awesome Excel allows the
kids to live a happy and healthy
lifestyle which is what every child
should ever be allowed to do growing up
and doesn't have to grow up and find out
later in life in a negative way that
they have it by something going wrong
falling really ill and then discovering
it which happens in most cases for
people with diabetes so gonna put a link
down below for you guys to read more
