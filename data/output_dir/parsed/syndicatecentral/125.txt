time to start today and who the hell is
that I don't know what's this a stranger
break into my house I need to check my
GoPro files actually work from last
night because if you didn't hear what I
said yesterday this GoPro Hero six the
new improved most epic GoPro ever yeah
decided to somehow factory reset itself
to Spanish last night whilst I was mid
riding so all I was doing was pressing
this button on the top life record and
then you'd hear a beep and it would be
recorded and you didn't stop recording
then when I pressed it once and it
didn't beep I was like wait what just
not working I took it off looked at it
Espanola and I'm not stymied day too
late today 143 said about this GoPro is
that when I started recording with it I
did have it set to you know recording
let me show you let me show you let me
show you come on give me my get my
settings in resolution 4 in for a which
you know shouldn't really be a problem
that's like nah me
no you can have it tonight you can have
it in 1440 and this should be fine
but all the clips have recorded like a
square box let me show you this real
quick if I open up a clip it opens it
like that like with this block ease like
a square I'm not too sure why it did
that
you may be like yeah that's 1440 Tom I
personally don't think it is I've
recorded on other GoPros and better call
in it's not come out like that so I'm
not too sure why this has happened I was
like where is no you don't say key part
bro No Shave November oh okay oh my god
it feels beautiful
oh look sorry you did so you dead soft
yeah this is really nice that you're
looking good 9 more days to go look well
have you got any bald patches not
suddenly no what does that mean you'll
notice I denied no signal no somewhat
November ok
kids Matt yeah once that all right time
to pick up some dinner for my my mom I
haven't actually been here for ages
where I live past this place to get to
them so now I kind of like have to find
a way to get this people hands down the
biggest problem with five guys is you
don't know what drink you're gonna get
because you've got so many options but
then when you click an option
you then have even more options stop
look at all the parasols to freak out I
love food is amazing the stuff in
especially Ashton one are super super
nice but bloody hell for two sandwiches
right tip two burgers right - a little
one and a normal size one some large
fries and two drinks nearly 30 quid bro
if I went to McDonald's it's been 30
quid I defeat a village in Africa not
just to people oh yeah good good dinner
that mom great dinner
yeah no I'm sorry I did tip my time love
you all right love you bye thanks for
taking up two parking spaces as usual no
all right just like that I'm on my own
mom's gone it's a setup where I was
supposed to be all day today I supposed
to bring my playstation my screen and
from like 10 o'clock in the morning well
huh Stan I was supposed to be doing my
fault and not training you might be like
what mentoring you know a train or a pro
game or anything know what night is like
pub G at the very very similar games but
a ones paid version on PC where all the
hardcore players are this is how I see
it the hardcore players there but then
I'm fortnight it's free game so every
child's getting it every teenagers
getting it every old money's got a
Playstation or cons you know like a
console to get for free they're all
getting it so because there's so many
noobs playing it that if you're somewhat
good like me at shooters somewhat good
you could jump into that game and just
dominate so I've been watching people
like Ally yeah I've been watching dr.
disrespects having watched so many all
these guys playing it and I just really
want to get into it cuz it just looks
good being able to get like really high
kill games I'm pretty sure like vixx I
got 35 kill game unless that was not
just him that was a squad I'm not sure
but I really want to get into it so my
plan today and maybe tomorrow is gonna
be bringing a screen a PlayStation down
here before I got cut off there
I was talking about fauna or something
and I basically just want to get really
good at Coppola and that conversation
now I'm back home gonna be
live-streaming all night pretty look
forward so that might end up being like
a ten hour stream but more importantly I
just got off the phone with run from
Cameron he's doing super well I'll catch
you guys will put late-day of how he's
doing I need to get inside get back in
the car with him but spoke to him he's
great and he watches the work so Ron if
you're watching hello Steven I don't
mean to alarm you but appears that you
are Martin yes and you have a bit of a
skin thing underneath your eye now I'm
not pulling it off I'm just trying to
make it flake off now this you've got be
very careful when you do this we bear
these guys because see you I call some
of it's still stuck to it but the rest
of its like dead this bit can come off
for the rest of it needs to stay and
fall off itself just like that now you
can see you're getting you've got
nothing irritating your I literally just
what flakes off like it do it naturally
but I could see was ever taking his eye
she kept like going in like a baby
dragons don't exactly like this all the
time with their hands still have you
still not done this AC unit bloody hell
come on how many months is is taking you
this was a simple job L'Oreal did you
does not teach her anything their first
time and do it properly in that right
dad what's wrong what is this about what
is this about Oh God buddy L we don't
have you got the right have you got the
right colored screws this time are they
gonna fit you can swag
Raceway the last one hey look he's
wearing rest why you can't get this
anymore we do the last ever robot that's
it
gone forever left feeding time at the
zoo
there we go happy is Larry
dad's just in the dark hopping alone
Matt's doing small over there I'm going
in my office games a woman this guy's in
my twitch chat before I stream he says
am I alone no I think you're alone now
alone ow bye Rimmer huh what I don't I
don't know the words I'm really I know
you guys watching the vlog I like Tommy
really get until all your gaming go oh
he replied you are not alone oh did me
to do not sign the way I'm finding doing
this is if I can do it date of like a
mass amount of streaming like a 10-hour
day of Sriman right then take a day
break so it's like day extreme in a work
day break like chilling with Lydia you
know getting out my mountain bikes every
like Tuesday and Friday just so it's
like you know fallen out there now I've
got my GoPro ready to rock and roll by
the way the whole reason why I wasn't
filming the previous rides is because I
couldn't find a GoPro charger and every
time I went to go and try and buy a
GoPro cable from a shop I just can't
find one and I know it was just a USB
see so I was just being a lazy bastard
but now I've got the new one I've got
the cable there's nothing stopping me
it's always gonna be ready and charged
which is what we were supposed to set up
ages ago got clear all this off or on
here or set up a table over there
because I won a station
always always always ready to go with
say this camera charge my g7x recharge
my GoPros charge spare batteries charged
phone cases charged all that sort of
stuff because every time I'm like I need
to go on like build something nothing's
ever ready now Casey nice that he always
has these batteries always on Chad but
I'm pretty sure like if you always have
your battery charging you can kill the
battery but it's one of those when you
rather risk the battery being charged
and ready so when you get going it's
good to go then you know it's risk the
chance of it being charged rather than
risk the chance of it being dead so
you know I'll get there eventually but I
need to get my charging station set up
so I can just get up and go I need to
get a amount attached to molt back hell
because everyone's to see me go and
drive it on the motorbike I need to get
one attach my car we will be set so all
these moments throughout the day were
you like how did you get from A to B I
can share with you exactly how I did it
buy it on the staircase proper send-off
that's the creepiest door over a proper
stand-up okay Theo's is or all the way
back oh yeah just punched him in the
face
he just went Bob ready the next hit it
some like David moon is attacking the
tail oh she's doing
oh he's bailed you absolutely wimp you
twice of all the size of him always
chasing him and the games begin really
this what you guys doing you're stealing
his food the Popo I thought that was the
cat ha Luna
that's not your food thank you now play
nut wall may I'm just that no no no I've
just had this cleaned there could be cat
prints all over by the end of the day
seems a bit like why don't you just
spend time with the book like I'm trying
to stick to a schedule like in my blog
the day before saying like hey I'm
streaming I let me be streaming it like
6 o'clock or 6:30 on the dot so it's
usually 6:30 so vlog goes live at 6
it gives time people times be able to
watch the vlog then was to watch the
vlog you can come to our live stream if
you want to and it just pans out like
really well so it is now nearly 6
o'clock
accidentally tweeted saying I'm
streaming at 6:00 not 6:30 so I'm gonna
get up and running so let's get the AC
unit on and let's that's true oh I
forgot to show Lydia I know to you guys
this might be like this is not even
impressive but I've got new bedding I've
got the same bedding for 3 years and
I've got all the new bedding feeding the
new pillow sheets and the new bottom
sheet Oh Mike is gonna be heaven tonight
all we just died streaming and dude as
subscribe for third
see four months in a row oh my lord
explicit time to subscribe and Jaber
wallah thank subscribe okay bud
holy shit you see that number out there
that's a warm warm fire stopped raining
and I'd look kinda red on camera because
I seriously I don't want to talking
about I seriously I was so intensely
into a game of pop G then I was like
shaking and bright red I'm bad at video
games because this computer is bad my
internet is bad but once it all gets
improved if anyone here watch as much
which streams it's gonna get nothing but
bad from here on out so every time when
I'm streaming we hit a 1 1 5 sub train I
give away a syndicate original shirts so
we're gonna do that now and the way this
works is people will type in and we
write so I'm gonna open it you ready so
I do this I click open to the chat and
then people type in exclamation point
raffle exhibition marks are in point
what do you say next we should point or
mark someone tell me in the comments
down below anyway they all enter into it
once to vent her into it we click draw
and then I message a person be like hey
congrats you wouldn't so this is exactly
what we're doing now but this is just a
bit of a behind-the-scenes peek of what
is happening draw it on camera so you
guys know it's all legit I will message
you immediately on Twitch if you win and
then I'll basically say what search what
shirt size which shirt that you won
where you're from name address phone
number email address so we can send it
to you and if they get with all the
posters and packaging we go draw the
winner in 5 4 3 2 1 I know where there

room when I'm streaming do you want to
come and relax listen to empyrion look

cynic original shirt will be
three-to-one ass harder
the winner is Pete oh so the awkward
thing was there that that guy wasn't
following me so a piece of Rhys who just
won the raffle for the syndicate shirt
turns out it wasn't probably on switch
that's kind of awkward that's the whole
point but you know what he wouldn't give
away fair and square so we're gonna do
another one because I just feel like
it's necessary to be done he wins a
shirt and someone else win this yourself
and the winner of the second this person
better before if they're not following
me we've set the rule now through not
following me they don't win it withdraw
again the winner of the second draw for
the syndicate t-shirt is gonna be three
two one

stream completed it is now 6 a.m. oh my
god trying to feed one cat a time he's
just like impossible Luna be nice you
know he's not gonna want to share right
let's go downstairs and feed you
separately see the fact that I've gone
to bed at 6 a.m. means I can actually
feed the cats at the time they're
supposed to be fed so rather than like
Peter them later on are we actually
going to the bed when they usually have
the breakfast so it's time to watch the
peaky blinders and kick back an 11-hour
screams oh my lord you know I mentioned
earlier about my bedding being changed
to the new stuff it's like floating god
I do need to get any mattress cuz this
one was just like a custom sized one but
now that I know I could get the right
size and I'm gonna get like told
tempur-pedic this beds gonna get frock
go from a hundred to a thousand real
quick but ladies gentlemen I'm currently
kicking back impure oh my god I don't
you joking yet Coco Pops in bed already
got it stained I'm watching Becky
blinders season 4 episode 2 this is
actually a really good like screen grab
of where I'm watching out because you
can't tell who that character is and
he's like a brand new character who's
badass as hell and you're loving if you
watching peaky blinders and you're and
you're fans of other TV shows that are
very very popular

need to go guys so thank you very much

vlog today I will
Bulai Sherman what I'm trying to do is
like stream day off streamed out
streamed out because like it's just like
keeping that healthy balance of you know
spending time with Lydia and then like
get out of my mouth but I could stuff
like that and you know just just just
probably the the balancing grout the
ballads you go probably like you know do
two hours a day and beacon system rather
than doing 12 hours every other day
which makes no sense but I just really
get into the rhythm of it and having
like a full day break just miss blood
perfect for me I can just take a break
and then be like and I miss it I want to
get back into it so yeah it's got a good
one I'm really enjoying it I've gotta
get my legs waxed bye Lydia I think
