detour and now wait oh no I forgot to
give this away at the meeting I'll do
another light ahead everyone but we're
going up the road to try and find
portion a portion of a wall belonging to
some God Adrian yeah you don't know that
that little wall there could be it that
wall over there that one could be it you
sure that corner there is not the wall
wait it is down there ha ha ha ah
we played ourselves a fucking rough
water pile of fucking rocks
what Samir whoa so this is the big wall
that divided England and Scotland yes am
I being educated in saying that so this
is the wall roots this were doing atone
for this bill to keep the picked out
then what the pics while the pics the
pics P ICTs was that mean though
basically like the early Celtic invaders
yeah the stock them coming down so he
built the wall that may not be
particularly big but if you think that
it used to have a big ditch one side so
it's like a toe so it wasn't really high
it was particularly hot it was kind of
like a border it was more of a border
marking employers the the big ditch on
the other side yeah then you put like a
wall so even if it was only four foot
high because you've got a six-foot ditch
that's a 10 foot ah think that yeah yeah
yeah sweetie okay
so then this is Adrian did it go from
like one end of Scotland to the other we
went one side of the country to the
other country yes it went coast-to-coast
of the thing that you could use it as a
road also people new words it like they
could follow along yeah there's some
people are troubled by the side about
something you can actually use the
surface he wrote you could transport an
allele on it
real fast a sick culture that yo life of
Tom tour isn't just about me ups razor
