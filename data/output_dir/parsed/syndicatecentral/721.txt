good morning will I'm currently
smuggling soup up to the roof to see the
Sun and enjoy it one step at a time is
the Sun stop the shadows are slowly
creeping towards me I'm like I've gotten
this much from here after well the top
of that wall until the Sun might slow
down soon I get to kick back in my
little thing my little Leviathan there's
some cheese playing and enjoy some
chicken and sweet corn soup till the end
till the dam in my entire bodies now is
so fucking cold pop my head is just like
this is toasty the shadow was now
appeared on my face I think it's time to
just like give up them I've always
wanted to go to the top of that hill so
we're going oh my gosh what am i doing
I'm updating my computer to go from
windows 7 to Windows 10
I'm hoping it helps my computer run
faster but I do not like anything else
more than Windows 7 so probably gonna be
riperoni pepperoni from here on well
this is all the traffic in LA and
actually it seems like there's another
farmers market going on I think that's
what it is
so I'm tempted to go and explore that
bye bye bought first we got picked up
it's compromise you don't remember the
last time I saw a fucking homer that is
so damn American either way I made it to
in and out there's traffic all the way
down the road but that's just normal
traffic but look how much traffic there
is just to try and get in and out holy
shit goes around the corner I was
supposed to go on like a healthy hike up
to that mountain and I was like well
maybe I'll do it tomorrow
that sounds like plan cuz then I'll go
earlier in the day so I'll get more
sunlight
then I was just like what I just hiked
in and out instead so yeah I did I'm not
sure whether this car is having a bad
day or it's meant to be like that
because either way that's fucking
awesome
be objective quiet holy shit
and we'll try and walk towards the base
of the mountain and see how high up I
can get to it to the top it's not a
fucking mouth as a health you'll see how
high up I can go holy shit that's the
queue anyway walk all the way up just to
check out the area and see what it's
like oh my god it goes all the way
around the block damn son all I know is
the mountain is that way I could see the
top of it so I'm just gonna try to walk
in that direction and maybe get there
I'm like a young Christopher Columbus
just exploring and going in any
direction but I'm pretty sure he
probably used a map so it's continuing
if I could show you a grid map of that
layer right all the rows like really
gritty grid just like this up or down
that's all you can do I happen to walk
down the one road in the entire area
that leads to nowhere I thought I just
happened to walk down a dead-end it's a
really nice area it's cool to explore it
and see what's around here but like I
ended up turning down the one Road the
one street I talked was it run fucking
won this is such a nice neighborhood
like all the houses are so fucking cute
and really nice there's the mountain
it's a fucking hell for God's sake
there's the hill look at the
streetlights like that's how you know
you're in a good area you've got posh
realize like that the size of that house
day and Daniel and what's even nicer
about it there's no skyscrapers
there's always skyscrapers you know
there's no big like telling story
buildings are something that's really
cute
alright the Clio is begun I made it to
the base of the mountain there's a dog
back there which I totally did not
follow the address to her to fight not
really the way we're gonna try to go up
to the top of it I'm assuming this road
whines all the way up if it doesn't fuck
I found something oh my god can you see
all these me
I think it's raccoons everywhere holy
shit I hope you guys can see him Oh bro
it's a raccoon holy fuck look at the
size of that thing
holy shit bro
it's fucking scary that's scared of them
fuck help me that's the trail up there
but I've made it like halfway and can
see some walk across the city which is
pretty fucking beautiful I'm proud of
made it this far but now we're gonna
keep on going honestly think this is the
best we're gonna get Cinna so if I go
any further up there's gonna be a bunch
of lies which is gonna pull the camera
vision but look at that we made it from
somewhere all the way over there I was
like I'm coming here today went to
in-n-out and that did kind of Custer's
the sunset but we'll definitely return
now we know where we're going
I'm just looking here that's fucking
beautiful from a nice City yeah if I
know what's up there sell because it
looks like like a fucking park or
something interesting looks like a lien
invasions occurring well I would never
have guessed this was up there that's
kind of crazy nice view over there and a
beautiful baseball field I'll scratch
that I found an even better view nothing
in the way oh that's beautiful
we made it bitches we fucking made it
put your mind to do something and you
can achieve it perfect
god damn cool city park I made it Paco
is till sunset we're kind of on time ish
stay on the trail dogs not allowed in
the park okay I can stick to these rules
for some reason my black camera picks up
light see beautiful even though it's
pitch black man those are a few walk to
90 see traders either way here it is
found a bench right at the top exactly
where pilot today said I want to go
there I did it for video the airport
down there each other planes taking off
you can't see me but it's awesome
whoa I carried on exploring up the road
I found like an old building that's
pretty cool riff there Catholic
obviously no open now but what if
there's a cafe in there is really really
nice got name now they're absolutely
gigantic these steps you literally have
to chew up down them okay just leads
straight down so find out where take me
there was an alley our steps look at the
distance between them right there to
there and how rugged the arc they
tripped over and fell like 10 times
either way I made it well finally made
it down definitely glad I did it I've
been wanting to do it for a longest time
my dad came to LA and when he came here
and did it I was just like feel like
it's something different to do today I
did it
Baldwin Hills scenic overlook but yep
there's no adventures of me walking back
home because I totally got an uber as
soon as I got to the bottom I was like
fuck ah like 30 minute walk so I decided
to come back and see how Windows 10 is
gonna be I honestly feel like this was
the worst decision I could have made
with this PC I don't think there's any
going back now oh okay so there's an
update which is good things because any
video always crushes on me but I've got
three stars
Oh Oh what happened well look no I'm
still got three stars
interesting oh yeah I put in my my
towels to dry in the book look how much
it's shaken it's all over the place oh
god it's probably break I decided that
for tonight's food we're having a hot
chocolate as well as a big-ass pizza
with Parma ham on it so this is a good
this is this is I make good decisions in
life yeah so far so good
I'm liking the division after five hours
of playing the game crushed on me so I
decided 5 min before the good times go
to man thanks for the good moments of
time
oh six o'clock in the morning seems like
a great time to go to bed I played video
games for five and a half hours I want
adventure pair Mao in for a few hours
