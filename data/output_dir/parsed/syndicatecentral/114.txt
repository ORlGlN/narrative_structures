oh hi doggy silkie love you and leave ya
bring the cast into this light and
really comfy cinema room and we're just
chilling in there and Lydia's late how
where's God's bidding what's he doing
he's come as seventh marked in the
corner that's a little wet patch we just
peed so unnecessary he's a little
bastard in it sir - busted I couldn't
God tell you like how much cheese sent
marked in here because inside this room
you've got like my comms room but this
entire this hall for now just smells the
white piss and
I know it's disgusting but like there's
what trades down there they've been
using the other trades even going from
upstairs back to downstairs to do it but
Gadsby keeps doing what's called
scent-marking
but what he doesn't know is him he's
getting his bollocks chopped up on one
day the doctor the vet said that that
should really really decrease him doing
it because he's just got no reason to
start some marking on place so things
crossed that's why we're not letting him
back upstairs into lounge just the
lounge as I perfectly setup the couches
oh it's all dead nice and clean and
everything like that
and the kitchens dead nice and clean but
like you know the moment you put them
near fabric again the like who just piss
so Cameron who's getting new it on
Monday so hopefully that'll make you
less of a busted and I don't know will
she change yeah I know I don't know
they're not loving this right now
there be no I don't recommend this at
home for I've got salt and pepper
chicken
in the fridge 24 hours I'm now going to
decide to throw it in to a pan
no anyway wait so we're agreeing that
I'm going to try and sort of pepper fide
the salt and pepper that we've got
already by making it the wet version so
I'm gonna put a tablespoon of this oh oh
yes hello it's so I'm gonna put a
tablespoon in this in there to make it
oily then mix it without and see you
could make some flavors dish no no might
be a good way to save some some chicken
for later all right update it definitely
looks chilly I up really decides on a
fun and it looks like the chili paste
colour we thoughts/opinions am I gonna
like it or not I don't think I'm gonna
like it
I'm tempted to put some more msg
sprinkle over it to make it good but
it's already got MSG in it so I don't
think I need to add any more sir but now
it's just sticking to the pan so I'm
just flash frying it and then hoping
this is edible this is probably a bad
idea so don't try this at home
yeah it's good be warm on the outside
cold on the inside chef put it in the
microwave very wet and tasty on the
outside a little bit dry on the inside
overall for leftover Chinese part 17
