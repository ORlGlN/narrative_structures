I'm too damn tired and oh my god I look
absolutely wrecked as the doggy comes
running towards me
hello everyone's like you have a dog I
don't have a dog it's not exactly my
tits families but guys I am back and I
felt like this was a necessary vlog to
do because I've just got back from 8
leaving at 8 a.m. this morning on my
motorbike and I've been riding a
motorbike pretty much this entire time
and the dog is like I've just went to
did my bike test section one sort of
thing which is a the practical riding
session of a training getting used to it
makes you do make sure I'm doing all the
right turns basically it's like doing a
driving lesson for your bike I just
basically did the first session of that
go one more tomorrow to do but instead
of doing it on my one two fact I'll show
you my bike a lot of people stopped and
seen it instead of doing it on a one two
five which I Drive that's that means
125cc engine I am gonna do it tomorrow
on a 500cc engine and the dogs like
there's a motorbike in here this is my
favorite the reason why I'm doing it so
I can get rid of these bad boys get rid
of my load a place and drive a bigger a
bigger car let me turn this off that's a
really good idea for the lump look at
this so this is my baby no you can see
it well and this is my baby stick a look
at this I've had the sticker for so long
I should put the sticker I know one day
it just made sense I was about to throw
it out because I literally oh Jesus look
I just smacked the pixel on and God no
it was like drooping everywhere and then
one day I was about fro outside just
couldn't decide where I was gonna put it
and I bought my bike I was like holy
shit this is perfect so I put it on the
saddle bike so that's that I saw him
back we also got a kitty cat you just
hate me don't you hello okay my love

going in on Monday and I'm gonna be
doing the test the first out with two
tests from a motorbike license which is
gonna be driving around cones and
stopping and stuff and I did at my one
to five and it was perfect I had no
struggle whatsoever it's like Swala hat
solemn slalom slalom through cones and
then doing a figure of a four times that
sort of stuff you know just doing that
sort of stuff if you can turn right you
know you the way you stand on your bike
and all that Sh is nay and it went well

said I passed both my fairy soda after
worried about doing them unless I ever
got my license taken off me and then
after we do which but I don't think

feeling like that I think I'm feeling
positive and legally driving safe but

you eating something and literally can
hear you eating an object what did you
do are you coughing I hope you weren't
coughing look at this right we've got

just says in while she walks around
cheeky she gets quite confused and she's
like I said uh that a dog is that a
really small human dirt that's humans
pretty small good and it's got funky

pooping and then sniffing its own penis
