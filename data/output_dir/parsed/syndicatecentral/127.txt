time was because of this following clip
enjoy
you know our principal senior sponsor
this year and I think that TCC a very
lucky unfortunate to be associated with
such an iconic brand we actually run a
competition halfway through the season
where we gave away two of our training
shirts that obviously have got the
syndicate relational lid one we have
four and a half thousand entries from
across the globe including entries from
22 different US states I think it just
goes to show that the global reach of
Tom Browne
as I do something always shines through
in my opinion and that is of communities
building a community and engage in a
community and I think there are a lot of
parallels that we can learn from in
terms of what we need to do to establish
a community that has a vested interest
in drinkable by way of a little thank
you
you're all amazing South Carroll I like
give me an Allison entry to this quote

way and I think he was shit what do you
