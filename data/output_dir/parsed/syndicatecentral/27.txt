let's get ready to rumble Easter new dog
its new Dave had about two hours sleep
yeah only two hours sleep so the
struggle is real right now but I'm up
I've got a water taxi I gotta pack this
bag fully clothed because Lydia's put
some stuff in it so when they say serve
you pack this yourself I'll go nope the
straight is that mine the bras aren't
mine and the thongs definitely mine I
was actually about to walk out the room
said I'm ready to travel and go but
forgot one thing never let you down Ron
I'll never let you down buddy never let
you down take a look outside
oh look at that six o'clock in the
morning it's pitch bloody black not a
fan of that that's for sure right
suitcase right so we're going so we're
pretty cold for the first leg of the
trip now this is where I'm like yeah
I've got my winter gear and I'm so ready
and set for it I'm really not that I'm
really not all my snow equipment of any
kind thermals anything like that they're
all at my apartment in Los Angeles
however we're not going immediately to
my apartment in Los Angeles we're going
somewhere else so I won't be able to get
all my stuff there I'm gonna just have
to try and buy it along the way buddy
I'll Tameside tuxes eat you bloody hours
doing a three-point turn in the middle
of the road perfect turn on my drive but
don't worry about I bet you do what you
got don't literally rang these guys like
12 seconds ago so that is what you call
service this is the stage where we ask
do we have everything the answers
probably no but I'm gonna go with it
sure can't even be bothered carrying the
luggage up that set of stairs so open
the gates I'm lazy okay bye now I've
already forgot something you might be
like what if you forgot I'm going what
is it the blood in souls Timmy Timmy
trainers we thought we thought feels a
bit funny taxi time Terminal 3 here we
come
I'm tender for the Apple in the morning
at night when all three we meet again
thank you very much mr. Mercedes oh boy
this was fun
they unpacked absolutely everything I
had organized in my back yeah I forgot
the joys of travelling with a load of
electronics I don't mind the questions
no problem but oh my god that wasn't
packing of all my cables he pulled them
out one by one and was asking a question
oh do you just fall I was like just take
the cables Oh rescan the bag and let me
go to repack up the entire backpack
which is making me so sad that if I'm
gonna have to do that again between the
other airports but we've discovered a
problem it's a bit too strenuous for
Lydia to be like moving the bag like
picking up and moving it which totally
get which you shouldn't have to do that
much in the airport apart from like
loading it into a cargo hold or
something like that
okay go haul cabin bin that should be
absolutely fine for me to do but we're
hoping that she can just easily just
push this around because it's really
easy to do but she's not allowed to
strain herself in the slightest so I'm
like I'm like Thomas the Tank Engine and
these are my carriages I'm chugging them
all on the airport it's gonna be a long
journey that's me I was gonna get a
latte but this line goes all the way
around there all the way run there and
then to the front nother fun yeah yeah
you're not getting your water and I'm
not getting my tea but Oh to the lounge
attempted manage to get ourselves into
the
Airport Manchester Airport they still
don't have my favorite conscious however
I am a fan of spicy snack mix suitable
for vegetarians this looks like it's
gonna be a view of full sunrise hair
which we're not gonna see because our
fights just being called look it up it's
beautiful it's just so beautiful Brian

healthy grain bar all right sweet
oh my god thank you so much for that man
a 3pt weed over
oh it's time to try and transform this
desk into my ultimate stream is up there
is a screen here I could potentially use
am I actually might put my laptop on
this or a bigger screen or I'm hoping
that Luke's got the other screens and
I'm gonna be able to stream from here
I've got a chair but a desk I'm right
near the internet box she's literally
laughing your beams right this is the
current setup I'm waiting for one stream
but I got the PlayStation 4 I got the
ripsaw for a bill to like capture my
gameplay from a razor into my laptop
I've got my mixer microphone again not
attempting to use this this PC screen at
the moment I could use it but I don't
think I could do it like that you could
just lean back here and play up there
but the input like on that is probably
to be terrible so just doing some
updates to my webcam and we should be
good I got the webcam working but I just
realized this can work as a studio light
like look it actually adds like a
professional amount of lighting how many
times you top it to the setup I kind of
look a bit blown out right now but this
is this works good good good given the
bigger blue look at that got it so is it
smooth yeah there is mm-hmm boom
is it delay in there then weird
all right as the test moment of truth
does it work time to test this beautiful
audio does it work
I don't have a clue my game Bobby a
little bit too odd you know what Tony
we're gonna keep it brilliant it works
dead up looking good yeah this looks
oversaturate whoa
completely look Oh is hot raise hell
look at this I got my streams out
looking good it's like not delayed or
anything like the sounds good the
microphone so my twitch chat over here
is like what the hell is going on like
honestly it's 625 in the morning in the
UK and I'm streaming to like 975 people
checking out what it looks like so much
love to my lovely people in the chat
right now again if you're watching this
blog right now 6 p.m. I'm gonna be
streaming the new zombie DLC
I hope am anyway so if you want to be in
this livestream pile the hype wall 6
p.m. or whatever this bloggers live link
in description don't miss it
look at the people turn it out and focus
a little bit find out whether or not
this PlayStation has God you installed
on the big screen alright that setup is
currently working and good the only
thing I haven't tested is the ripsaw to
make sure that's all working to be able
to go to get the the PlayStation through
to my laptop and then do that at the
same time but that shouldn't really be
too much of a problem I've done that a
million times I just need the second
screen so I can stream on that monitor
but then play the video game on the
other one so well mess around with that
tomorrow the sound works the
notifications work everything work so if
you what like I said 6:00 p.m. tomorrow
if you missed it then you missed it I'm
going to stream my first ever attempt
then I'm probably gonna get that
rendering as a video to go my youtube
channel maybe take a break and upload it
or just stream flight to 3 hours or
whatever my first attempt of the map
might take 10 minutes might die straight
away who knows one thing I definitely
don't have which is a bit of a problem
right now is a headset if I can just get
some earbuds
I'll just wear earbuds but as you guys
know like even iPhone headphones I
didn't bring any razor headphones
whatsoever can idea like everything's
like all different connections now in it
so I just need a phone with a jack on it
and I should be good to play the game
which I'm hoping someone here will most
likely definitely have I kind of have to
either wear like Apple ones or raise I
can't wear any other branded one because
it's pods
razor and I don't want to wear anything
else Leto so yeah we should be good
everything tomorrow should be good
thanks to Johnny's on the adventure
