sweet sue for stealing so yes please for
these days sixty five or videos carpool
karaoke
the climb of my bloody Dr Haass madness
and one another miserable day in England
it is look at the rain look at the rain
look at the rain look at every Oh God
it could say it's quite literally shitty
weather right now is the
behind-the-scenes what I actually did
yesterday is I livestream the vlog so
let me show you what it is to explain
people I know some of you know this but
a lot of people can't wrap their heads
around it so you know I'm gonna film
throughout the other film like a clip
here a clip there I click that all that
soft stuff well throw them all into this
so every single little square here you
can see is a clip then a pretty big it's
an edit and giving like trim up boring
bits things that weren't supposed to be
in it from the ends from the start so
it's like a perfect clip so trim
together nice Andy it's perfect but then
what you do is render the video and
upload it to YouTube and then people
just get to watch on their computers
unfortunately because this is gonna take
so long to render and it's like 640
right now if I was talked about it the
vlog wouldn't be uploaded until maybe 11
p.m. at night so I use is a program of
OBS to stream the footage that I've
already added so it's like a fully
finished video but it's just not
rendered so I just played a video out
and stream it so people here are in my
char are watching me stream it instead
as some people are either chat some
people I just don't understand it this
makes no sense how is this possible I
don't get it it's just that easy
rather than it being much much later for
you I just stream the video instead like
it's a lot it's like a live preview of
it immediately you know so it's like
boom right there rather than you wait
free forever so it's a bit it's a bit
random yes but it is a much better way
for me to get the vlog to you guys until
I get my five you don't found it down in
there it is what it is so this is now
behind the scenes of avoid being
streamed live only four minutes into the
vlog being live and yeah people are
already like I don't care what's going
on but if you're watching this vlog now
you should you should kind of I'm
stunned it's pretty simple I have to say
my favorite thing about being on to
stream the footage like this is I can
see people's light reactions straight
away so sometime you know you get a lot
of people like oh this is awesome and
actually replying to things in the chat
like if something's like actually funny
or they respond to it then I see live
feedback sometimes you get like people
like oh to of a clue what's going on
what's going on bought yeah it's it is
interesting to see what people say like
this guy says my name is Jeff someone's
again ask him why is he streaming the
vlogs and people are saying hi
yeah some people get it and some people
don't kind of blows my mind how much
people don't stand it all right I
