I'm trying to say is PF Chinese gets a 9

incredible he was low so I've got to ask
how come you've been filming yourself
while you're eating your meal I'm like a
YouTube video that's awesome so I was
really cool about it and then when I
asked for Coke he brought one late so
because he brought one late it brought
me to he's a good guy
massive shoutout to my server Tom came
over and gave me a free dessert hell
yeah that's what I'm talking about yeah
it's like like vanilla ice cream or
toffee ice cream with toffee sauce on
top of it oh and a cheerleader which I
don't like excited to give like a really
nice tip and on here as well I wrote my
youtube channel just in case he wants to
watch the vlog and if you're watching
this Tom hello okay alright don't get
too excited in the comment section down
below oh let's watch out Doc Martens
because my mum wears don't mind it I was
like I'm gonna see what the hype is
about and I walked out with some shoes
I'm still wearing my DC's but I feel
like it's a new year it means new
fashion new new new almost look for Tom
I'm not gonna abandon DC's
I don't think so but at least I found
some nice shoes and I'll show you guys
later
thank God it stopped raining holy crap
look it's like a completely different
place when it's up to rating okay this
is probably the last shop I ever
expected to see myself in it's actually
a
be shot but I saw this hanging basket
which my dad used to have as me as a kid
and it brought back so many memories and
I thought I've got to go in here and see
how much this is because if I could get
one of these for my office oh my gosh
this is really a myth I miss my father
vlog today cuz this is bringing back my
dad's memories this is the sort of stuff
I need to start doing my bedrooms in the
UK look how like homey and life here
looks I'm just I'm just like shopping
around just like looking for like
influence for when I go back like well
sick this wall is it's just so cool I'm
like I'm a huge fan of just a room that
doesn't look empty all the rooms in my
house just look empty
yeah that store I just walked out of was
called baby and child the only reason I
went in that was because of that I must
look so with wandering around it
I've watched Casey's vlog Karlie Kloss
he's absolutely everywhere that is a
sick lineup of shoes this reminds me of
like the Iron Man 3 scene where's the
light suit suit suit suit ooh but
instead four shoes out of all shoes that
I see Jordans are hands down at my
favorite I've never owned a pair but
trippy the designs are like you've got
this bad boy hit like what is that these
look like some other goddamn future
they're just so beautiful and then them
oh my god they're beautiful you look at
stores this place is called lids hat it
goes on your head lids okay it sells
hats that makes sense and then you find
a store name like this
that sells sunglasses it just makes no
sense what the hell just walked into
Tilly's and they're selling zoella stuff
that's crazy good job so Ellen why do
Americans ruin everything I was
string sounds like what the hell why the
fuck have they bought cilantro in it
wine
laughs stop all right and told you guys
I ended up buying a pair of shoes okay
so I did decide on the Doc Martens which
ones did I get all right the ones I
decided on whoo
hope you guys like them it's much get
off and while these are the bad boys
that I decided on I think they're really
really fresh like they're Doc Martens
they're gonna be all black at the bottom
but I feel like these are like an
in-between to me liking DC shoes and
boots so I decided to get pair of these
because everyone keeps gonna wear
bootcut jeans so I bought some boots you
guys basically bullied me into buying
these shoes so you can all go fuck
yourselves fuck is going on here I'm
outside the Apple Store where iJustine
is usually lingering around queuing up
for new phones but if these guys are
doing back flips and jumps and all that
saw it otherwise door jugglers or whoa
