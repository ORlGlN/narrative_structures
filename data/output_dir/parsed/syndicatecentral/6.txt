Stockton's missed it properly it's 824
in the morning my blog is rendered and
I'm watching some videos I've even got a
gaming video going up on the main
channel truly is a gray day out there
today we say first thing my dad asked me
was he going to better have you been to
bed and the answer was the other way
from yesterday oh no it's not good to
constantly be messing up my sleep
schedule at the same time like I've gone
up yesterday like 5:30 in the afternoon
so it's like I'm just not tired
I look like an evil villain I fell
asleep on the floor I know it looks like
a scab but it's just like a red mark
from where I was leaning on it look at
it ain't no word of all this and you'll
never get it boy right priorities I need
to give a bike pack for tomorrow if I'm
going to do it what the heck I didn't
know this bag contains stuff so welcome
to tongues how to prepare for a gaming
event 101 you need socks and because I
basically stand up all day for like
eight hours my feet stink so I take two
pairs of socks for every day and then
obviously a pairs of boxers so let's go
over to Lydia's messy side of the bed
and grab some paste
hair gel this is the stuff I use if you
don't know that by now it is the best
absolutely wear this because my dad wore
this and then I just kind of adapted it
if there's one thing I need before I go
to insomnia
it's a shave do you know why I have a
bald patch the thing is I really would
do a lot for a really good beard and
mustache and pay a lot of money for it
book I'm just aware it's never gonna
happen
so before mmm potato well I can
definitely say I did a pretty good job
there and there we look okay nice and
clean freshly shaved no bald spot my
moles not going anywhere anytime soon
but there we go nice trim cleaned up I
decided to keep the sideburn because I
don't have her on that side but we're
not guys over than that what I need is
for like the pub quiz and going out at
night I need some shirts which oh my god
I have quite well they're all hip ones
well as you guys know me the way I dress
is cineq original shirt in the daytime
nighttime all sure oh oh sure All Saints
like blacked out t-shirts and then for
like going out going out always all the
time All Saints shirts I don't know why
I just think the quality's mazing for
this it's pretty much
all the way so for my beautiful color
assortment of shirts I've got black Wow
so colorful I have like wow so colorful
and I have great yeah I'm not really
into like bright clothing but could you
tell that at all by the assortment in my
wardrobe that only the only colorful
shirts ah this jumper which is Lydia's
and then I think that which is a twit
really so ya know a lot of choice there
really as for pants I just wear the ones
I always wearing take you with me that's
pretty much that only just realize that
today I haven't filmed anything because
I haven't done anything apart from
streamed and it's now five four in the
morning just put in those hours man I
just put them in and putting them in and
this this is just the consequence the
more extreme unless I'm wrong and I will
say this though I am planning to go to
Canada now you might be like what when
tomorrow today No so tomorrow much they
go down to insomnia so that I'm looking
forward to that something be danced for
like 4 days but we're going down daily
everyone's gonna be there it's gonna be
epic and of long sweet that good fun
like you're gonna see me like partying
and hanging out with everyone and me and
all you guys are just gonna be legendary
well then after that I'll probably
coming back and stream you for like a
little bit maybe like a week or so
I'm thinking like a week after I get
back from a second I'm opening a waffle
good I'm thinking like a week after
insomnia is done I come by a stream I
get a load of videos made not streaming
I mean like videos I'm like I'm not
genuinely thinking of getting a the
Minecraft Project season finally styled
and recorded and then you know record a
few episodes and then go off traveling
to Canada for weeks they'll be talking
to my boy yeah
and Bradley about going up there going
off in the helicopters go and checking
out some like ice glacier cave saw
things which sounds sick and then like
Jeff actually went and lived up there
for like a couple of couple of months
like six months so he said he's found
like loads of fresh new fun stuff to do
like where we could rent an RV so like
how I traveled around New Zealand with
an RV
Jeff's down to travel around Canada in
an RV as well and what we're talking
about is hiring a driver so I know this
may seem odd but like if we get a driver
then we can just tell the driver the
drivers like here or there and it was a
bit fun driving ourselves but that way
it's like if we want to go to like a bar
somewhere we can dog
we can get from kind of road we could
party on the road and it could be a
really really cool trip and you know I'd
love to do with and I went to New
Zealand with Angelo Jeff and it was
amazing but you know I'm a life of Tom
tour we got we got deck on board didn't
really get to go around what I'd love to
do is do a tour we're burning a fuck
mm-hmm that's all right but I looked go
to New Zealand with Jeff a driver undec
like Angelo if he would that be down to
come and hang out with us
absolutely but I know he's a very very
busy man because he's a CEO a 3bd like
the gaming company off in America so I'd
love to see if that could come with as
well cuz like Jeff could like default I
wasn't shoot like that like the
traveling I can plugged my perspective
that could just be debt and being a
fucking idiot it would be amazing and
I'd really like that and a lot of people
have been saying if you do go travelling
somewhere next like the life of some
sort what the hell is that
but Brandon both wolf it'd be cool to go
to Canada I don't even know if I've got
that much of a Canadian audience but
it'd be dope to go to Canada do some me
ups there so you're not really planning
in advance and try and do like one of
the biggest me ups in Canada yeah what
do you guys think I go to Canada do some
traveling do some adventuring maybe go
back and say hello to that bear with
death that'd be cool yeah if you didn't
know I actually went am a polar bear and
then I also kissed a bit I literally
shit you not that is what we could go do
an imagined deck having to do that that
would be amazing
this book is I'm so glad I got it like I
think it cost me like a hundred dollar
donation to like the fund for looking
after the animals but I did it and you
know what how worth it is this Jeff
looking like a gangster Bradley looking
like a gangster this guy we couldn't
swim with a polar bear but this guy
who's been like training and raising the
polar bear like can go swimming with her
weave bald eagle cult libert√© did it
look at that
this shit was the coolest trip I think
I've ever been on like New Zealand was
also my ever out like loads of little
places up in it have just been
incredible but nothing like come on
nothing can be okay meeting Billy the
bear he kissed me look at that I'm not
trying to go back to Canada to recreate
the same trip I'm trying to go back
there to do even more fun shit because
out of thing anyway
I've actually been in the world the most
fun I've ever had is in Canada because
Canadians are just absolutely insane to
do whatever they want
however they want when everyone I'm
telling you right now that's my kind
people Oh Tom Tom Tom Zimm are you

whilst I'm doing these events like most
the time I go out with most the times I
go to these events and I don't even
