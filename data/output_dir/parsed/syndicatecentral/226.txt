the the most thick monitor unboxing of
the day from LG again folks that guy
that was another wicked a wicked sin
well well well you guys saw me by
yesterday or the day before it was a
toothbrush yes
so let's take a look at that toothbrush
with built-in bluetooth you can track
your running steps you can connect to
your car you can now connect to your
teeth I'm pretty sure this doesn't
matter is this if my razor shaver as
well had built-in bluetooth that would
be the end of days it'd probably just
keep going back saying no haircut
this is the RLB smart serum I got is an
entire series of smart series which
comes with a little button I got
actually the one product that ever comes
with batteries included and it's a
toothbrush okay that's pretty good
oh he's more oh yeah okay I have the
back even off it straight away Cody body

my cup J key figure in my car manual
okay it comes with a one-year warranty
thank you for that it comes with to
shoot it comes with a charging station
okay I'll never understand why bathroom

it I probably should too as I used to be
an electrician but I don't get it and
don't understand it I get a toothbrush

head home tumbler so I can have a spare
one i I think this could be for like you
can
one your kids can have one and your wife
can have one again not contingent on my
saving and a travel box which looks kind
of weird to be honest and even it
Wow look at that that for a quality
product like a banana holder all of it
