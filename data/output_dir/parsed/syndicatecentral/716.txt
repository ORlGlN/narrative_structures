good morning ladies and gentlemen
welcome your faces to Texas date to
where right now it's like 1 o'clock in
the afternoon actually no it's half past
two in the afternoon because time went
forward all the clocks went forward in
the u.s. so that really messed up me
getting out of bed at the right time
being where I'm supposed to be right now
and obviously means yesterday's vlog is
late but I've tatted up the bed I've
tallied up the bathroom and I'm just
tired you know up the apartment cuz I'm
actually going to a different department
today which I didn't know I thought was
staying here for the whole 3-4 days but
uh you know I'm not we're going
somewhere else so tend to pack up and
leave all right I'm in time for a hotel
review let's do this welcome to this
hotel where this looks normal right
you're my bed desk TV looks like a nice
small quaint room really you know what
it's what you need but if you turn it on
it's like okay open cupboard there which
is kind of your wardrobe thing but then
there's a fucking kitchen like what the
fuck I'm so confused
what what is this oh this basket oh yeah
of course did have to be a bathroom I
didn't even think about that and then
there's a bathroom as well so okay hi
bathtub not exactly as amazing this is
the last one we were at but this is
interested that looks like a bomb-ass
hairdryer it's amazing we got pictures
of this stay America facial bag look at
the Sun look at the size of that soap
okay weird this is like a budget hotel
we're stopping it right now boy we just
need a place to stay so it's good
there's a bet I'm good
oh praise the Internet god I finally
managed to get yesterday's vlog uploaded

waiting for YouTube to like play
catch-up and upload it I think and hope
