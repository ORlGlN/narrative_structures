reading glasses for him and then run
back over so he can pick I was like what
you want pasta that and he just kind of
look confuses like I have no idea what a
lot so if I can just get him a set of
glasses now that will solve a problem

incident is like there's a pink in my
chicken and I don't know ever it's just
like little little grisly bits of pink
in the chicken oh it's like blood our
raw chicken or anything so the meal was
nice but I can't either ask that because
