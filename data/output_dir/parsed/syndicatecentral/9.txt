might be nice but the brand to me still
reminisces have been a a kid in a chap I
don't get it may even found myself a bit
closer than I like very sleek very clean
but it says breading dead down the side
don't understand what it is but I love
it
I told you this place was very much a
high based place
goddamn carbon fiber singer carrier oh

what looks like alligator or crocodile
skin oh my god how many Chinese people
got a lot of money a lot of it so we're
in the most high beast mall ever a full
store for bathing ape yo what is this is

and stops whereas that runs the full
length of the picture you can't see your
hands there oh I knew she had her own
line but I know she had her own god damn
store oh my god it's huge
no one may be warned that last I love
these drums but the buildings are just
so tall and they're so big so what this

the hell is going on over a butcher so
you've got like a lot of mini for setup
to eat in privacy
yeah I actually don't a genuine cause

in a box in a bank bag you know I feel
like my sister buying handbags here

cool-looking that is the coolest meanest
wallet ever I actually love it since
they have a sort of backpack from Fed
day with the eyes and I was like so mean
and evil I really like it Fendi's got
like loads are just like t-shirts or
like apps on it and stuff I don't like
them or anything like that I'm not
interested in their clothes whatsoever

comes in to play Lydia let's bar a
ticket for us to get a guy that takes us
up a mountain fast track style so it's
like quick otherwise it takes forever
the others bowing but there's a million
in six or five guys so Lydia's gonna
check her phone find out who our guide
is what team they're from and that were
not being scammed I said I say that but
she bought it off an official website so
it should be gucci mane and yeah we're
in some culture right now check this out
cuz i'm very nicely camillot who did
what is gap what is this I'm not who is
this Thomas Jackson I'm all the way in
Hong Kong and I'm craving chocolate
digestives I'm literally gonna get
chocolate digestives four minutes but
yeah did you got okay
wait sour cream a black okay choice my
choice yeah yeah oh yeah yay we found
him get your guide we didn't get ripped
off Bauval let's take it oh my god this
can't be happening yeah this is a
ridiculous amount of people go to this
hill holy there's so many people
hey oh there's so many people
thank you all right so we're following
this guy okay we got this okay this is
chaos right we've worked out what it is
all those people in the boxes earlier
that you saw their filth their Filipino
maids and because it's Chinese New Year
they're all up on holiday to work but
nowhere to be so they're just chillin in
cardboard boxes of train stations
getting drunk
thank there's just a few people on this
trip oh my god Oh last came on oh yeah
with it if they're speaking Chinese to
everyone except pause it's great all
right summary if you go to get this tram
to get up to the top of this mountain
that we want to go on take you like four
or five hours to queue to get the tram
however yeah you join these groups that
like help you get through it faster
which it still does so rather than wait
your for five hours you wait an hour in
this this cube goes from where that sign
is all the way down there all the way to
here all the way down and then it's
looping back up the other side and these
are people still joining the queue so
just keeps going and going and going and
I think we crossed there once yeah once
are available and then to transition are
the queue continues nice maybe it was
running that fluidly then that I thought
it was fate so yeah yeah but what I
didn't gather is that you can actually
just get taxi straight Wow I won't be a
parrot you can actually get a taxi
pretty much just straight out there yes
that's what the here buddy experience
yep pretty much hey there's definitely a
pirate in that tree
there there is but it's definitely a
parrot that ain't no pigeon okay
good cueing over there we've queued up
and down and crossed and now we're in
this line which goes up then down then
round that's going to take two more time
what up this guy's got absolutely blue
neon lights in his car and I love it
fluorescent lighting
what a gangster oh my god right you know
in movies where you like walk like the
zombies behind them like oh there's
zombies and then they think we're
getting away from them and then they
look over a ledge and then the life but
there's mass odds I feel like I've just
got that now I know I've told you this
already but we shoot from there all the
way to the end of that line and then all
the way back then we'd cross all the way
to there all the way to Lydia's stood
there all right and we got a walk down
here around this fountain but check this
out oh my god look at all these people
holy this is insane but I think our
group comes down here and then we get
fast tracked into it I think we have a
FasTrak system rather than being thrown
in this chaos this takes three to four
hours whereas this takes like an hour
hour and a half I think I hope oh my god
please
i watch ladies reaction what's a
reaction
she's like this can't be real it's gotta
be real
I did that these are individual people
that go all the way around there and
then in that math test you're the worst
person in the world
no she pushed me in but we're gonna go
down here and then straight into the
building rather into that chaos good
please be worth it please be working
talking on the tonight.this so faster
guys then it took us about an hour
that's the three-hour wait oh my god oh
my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
about your face not Vin Diesel wait what
then we get on it but I just can't take
his cueing seriously with Vin Diesel
just staring at us all the time
are you not a little bit all right Q and
she's been shooting that she didn't
sleep last night
I did I feel great yeah yeah we're
almost there it's like three hours of
cute well actually we queued maybe an
hour and a half I recommend to all these
yes it's good
oh wait okay maybe not
the drum but we can't get in this one
because this tram is for these people
and then it's a rope in between us so
we're getting on the next one
this lady is an absolute legend marker
has been looking at for us on this cave
well when we get to the top would we say
be able to say one thing was it worth it
yeah it's nice - it's nice to take a
seat for a second for your everyone was
like fighting to get on the train as I
know cleared my arm in the way let video
get on the tram and then go on like your
 weight made it to base camp and
this is this is the view you can see
from up here now luckily pro tip to
anyone is going to do this on the tram
on the way up sit on the right hand side
slot when you get on the tram you like
water it'll set on the right because
there you see that a little bit of the
city when you go up more importantly
we're here now and because we waited
like two and a half hours it's worked
out good timing cause it's like nearly
7:30 and 8 o'clock there's a massive
light show apparently where all the
buildings light up and stuff so if we
were to come sooner we want to seen it
and probably come back down but now
we're gonna get the opportunity to watch
it so yeah what's more Chinese what what
is more Chinese then coming to the top
of this tower and there's a bubble gum
truth about this building oh my god
everyone's pushing as well uh tourists
where are you
is the city we looking for are you happy
we made it after two after two hours of
queuing we're bloody made it you see all
these buildings we're gonna do a light
show at eight o'clock
so okay so we got like 20 minutes to
wait okay not bad not bad at this
position 20 minutes to wait here with
people pushing up your ass the entire
time what is that
it's me writing on the side of the
building music show nice it will start
apparently in five minutes on the
building but then apparently they are
quite the entire city does it so Oh mate
I thought the lights went off it is just
not posing the flash what you got ready
