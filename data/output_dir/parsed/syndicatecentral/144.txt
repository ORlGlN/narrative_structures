it is a hell of frosty morning in
England right now look at my windows
winter is here
summer has far from left morning kitty
cats oh who wants to play with the toy
wow it's like out you've got this to
play with this to play with but what do
they like the most
oh now which one you cats is gonna like
this the most Oh lunes Brown it learn
Hispanic guys with Oh like I'm cat crack
it's finally happening I'm rendering out
the Japanese candy video I finally got
myself a backhand track that I liked I
was like searching on the internet for
ages like using an audio jungle and
stuff trying to find a good track it's
very poor but when you've got like an 18
minute long video it's had for audio
soundtrack to not be repaired but
nonetheless it's rendering gonna try and
get it uploaded if you're watching this
video right now this video my actually
gonna live yesterday said you wanna go
to youtube.com for size syndicate you
might be able to see it there but I need
to go out now get some hair jokes I've
run out of it and found a cure for this
thing I was about to go and get in my
car but my dad came with a really good
suggestion why don't I go on the new
trend so I'm a triumph to the Trafford
Centre which is not where I was planning
to go today but it makes sense to get
this out of the way unfortunately I did
indeed somehow get moisture underneath
my my watch like glass so I don't know
how that's possible see all must have
gone but I'm gonna take this in send it
off get it fixed and then maybe get it
all polished up so it looks nice and
fresh
everyone knows that's whether or not I
do wear my for gear whilst I'm riding a
motorbike and the answer is yes most of
time if I'm just popping down to like my
local shop or something I always like
helmet boots jacket wise I don't usually
wear the right stuff and you should
always prepare for the slide address or
the slide not the ride which makes like
complete sense and I definitely agree
with that but I'm just an idiot so
always wear the right protection when
you're wearing a riding your bike so all
my boots on my pants and my jacket and a
big thick riding gloves because when I
go on like the motorways and stuff like
that I never ever want to come off
you're not wearing the right gear in a
mobile way that is the wrong way today
which is looking mask it's just so weird
it's just weird that the headlights
don't move with the wheel them uses me
this is like how to piss off every
single person trying to park in a
parking lot
one look at all these cars are these
cars all these guys empty space nope
there's my bike I don't know whether
you're the bike parking spot is at the
Trafford Centre so I just put there by
the way Jesus old titties is she fast
like very fast and after you get her
over like mmm like 65 she goes from
sounding like an electric ready bike to
like a really noisy triumph that's quite
nice anyway next up I need to go and
watch back
I gotta carry this around with me I look
like a bum but you know what happens the
chocolate Center is stupid like stupidly
busy because it's like school holidays
right now my mistake I don't know why I
thought any different like when you
return to me you need receipt but I can
prove it to God when you buy a bright
will you get this like big digital light
screams like a weird electronic receipts
pretty cool and I forgot to bring mine
so just started my belt to put my pull
my name up online the system is somewhat
like that but unfortunately we can't
sell rode all the way here I can't
return it but what I have found out is
it is covered under 2-year warranty so
what we can do with this experience is
just say you know what we went for a
nice ride on a nice day on the bike we
chilled out and let's hope no idiot
fucking went pulling into the pockets
base and knocked over my bike otherwise
okay Hey look a parking space ah goddamn
it
motorbikes it was really stupid me to
ride all this way and not think I needed
a receipt bought I I just got so
distracted in the hall oh I'll go on a
bike that I just didn't think about
taking itself time to ride home go and
get it and not come back
I'm not gonna do it today I've been for
rather than the bike that was nice but
I've got all the stuff that I need to do
so you can enjoy a ride home
I'm in dire need of some hair gel and
this right here that that's the good
stuff
what are the chances of that I just
happened to drive past the new offices
as our line was going off for some
reason Ken came to save today we'll look
at this floor
this looks no this looks well nice holy
shit
real now dude this is a hundred times
nicer Wow I got only through the
bathroom this looks gorgeous
Oh holidays well then nice to see ya but
Luna I've got a point not me that just
cannot be comfortable that cannot be
comfortable in the slightest oh my god I
love my dad it's clean the garage and
it's so much but ignore the pile of
Wellington's and shoes but oh my god is
cleaner garage yes yes go riding tonight
can't wait and you know we need to talk
about this bike okay so we're gonna
refer to this as the red triumph being
the street triple it is a very fast bike
when you're turning and the headlights
that doesn't move when you're riding you
don't know what was it but like when
you're turning on my small side streets
and stuff you know or trying to get
between there calls or some like that it
really throws you up just cuz you're so
used to ride now however when you're
riding it and the sound of it it's super
fast acceleration smooth ride you
handles bumps really well it's really
great if it was cool about it is it can
go from one stage of it just sounding
like well like moving like that and then
until it just hits this point and then
it goes from boom boom to boom and it's
like it's just it just turns into a
monster so I I do like it but I go admit
I'm just not keen I'm just not keen on
that it's weird
traditional turning for me I just love
it look at this bike looks like some of
the military it's so sick fish man I've
ever met
he wears his khakis with his t-shirt
tucked in with about some adidas
trainers looking fly as a mother trucker
his name is Ken and you know what
he just doesn't mess around
it all comes full circle that it can
back to where I used to work the
macarons begging me dad you don't eat
snow word kept it real from McDonald's I
did like the exercise at the same time
it was cold and rainy every single day I
could have given a free MacDonald no
made me ride my bike maybe get exercise
no wonder I got an electric bike
nowadays a oh my god it would be so much
better with a bunch of I back then
mm-hmm you know what as much as people
might not quite donald's I absolutely
love it listen you know I used to be the
fry boy there's some good-looking
present yep
tastes good the first few bites then
once you've eaten the whole thing
instant regret within an hour you'll
regret it even more that time of the
night back at home it's Friday five
o'clock we're riding I'm a running late
obviously so the rest of the lads are on
the bike and get the hook dude honestly
that looks like cleaner but this is just
gnarly oh I thought although you're just
gonna roll your bike down it down for
the sake of it all right well they said
