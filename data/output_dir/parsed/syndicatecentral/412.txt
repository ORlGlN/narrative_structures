good morning world shower chair okay I'm
not changed showered ready to go and
let's start today I swear I am falling
apart every time I keep shaving I keep
waking up the next day like loads are
like spots around my chin I've got if
you look at my eye I got like a sigh on
my eye and a split lip I'm literally
falling apart
that's done the food run oh oh oh no yup

orange juice and milk and water and
unbasic for for you ma'am another day in
LA it's just it's just so bad absolutely
terrible but we're gonna go get on the
model Metro rails because a monorail
from the citizens and head this way I
don't know where we got pork gear tap
enter sweet he's here look look forward
what do you spot what can you see
Oh can you see oh yeah he a tourist can
tourists can tourists can that is a sick
lying soap it's just so uniquely random
but Jack is it just glass a plastic
I'm not sure I don't touch again either
I don't wanna break it oh this place is
like totally hips turn all that but like
that is a stupid sign you can't even
read what it says feel like this place
might be closed because it is completely
abandoned and I'm assuming a clown might
murder me so no thank you
it's at the stage where I'm thinking
that maybe me my dad shouldn't be up
here because there's no one else here
and it's like we are behind you that we
always sneak in to places we just
shouldn't be find what everybody else
would go yeah well there's actually no
signs to be fair there's no signs then
you couldn't so we did me if I told you
about look and don't touch you going
picking mushrooms up off the street what
what are you fucking Mario when your
dad's in Los Angeles for three days and
you've just been in Vegas or five what
is it that you do go to a dinosaur
museum we've not even walked in yet and
look at the size of this thing please be
all Mike please be all Mike please be
all Mike God don't fuck Paul wow this
worked pretty friggin hefty whoa oh my
days
oh my days this real holy sugar oh it's
not even a dinosaur it's an actual whale
set big-ass dinosaur just saying I'm for
the record my favorite dinosaur is a
t-rex hallow t-rex then Raptor then a
little one that goes like
look at the size of this thing
my book tell the ages of like t-rex is
like baby t-rex teenager t-rex adult
t-rex and its name was Thomas on out by
the ways these ones are not real they're
just based off the fossils but
everything behind a glass cabinet is
100% real so real real real imagine boom
billions at well then again it's just
like a rhinoceros that one in it yeah oh
it's like just a big rhino alright if
I'm gonna have to guess what this is
it's the other one was a rhino this is a
hippo I don't know maybe why was I
supposed to guess that paleo paradox ad
yep a pearl oh you're one of them boys
that there's a Chinese pipe okay
the first ever babe imagine trying to
vlog with this back in the day oh my
gosh it would be a silent vlog as well

I'm sure some of you wish that was the
case game F yourselves this is actually
the animation stand-in chair that they
made Mickey Mouse on look he left a
little note to people who worked on it

wonderful world of birds you know when

almost found a miniature Steve this is a
horned lizard instead what it really is
some bad looking birds like what is this

fat turkey but then look at this holy
crap that's a mean-looking bird all this
is impressive but I've seen a god damn
bald eagle in person and how do you like
sit on my shoulder and I'm not they're
under polar bear so all these mother
truckers that don't move not impressed
however this bird looks like it did
something very suspicious and doesn't
want to tell you come clean boy complain
it must be satisfying to like find the
fossil book digging it out man like
excavating it from the ground then
cleaning off and all that just take so
long for a piece of bone that big then
piece it into a huge jigsaw puzzle mad

would like to say I knew that book I

look at it that is so sick I like that
is a mean-looking piece of equipment
straight out the future but I'm pretty
sure this is kind of an old plane now
1963 it is a really old plane but it
still badass as hell and I think it's
worth it black ops 3 or 2 it was in mint
we're staring at this one plane and then
realize there's another one in the
background that has to be like the
aviation summit museum right no but
that's the California african-american
museum and then you've got Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum
and then the Science Center it's got a
Pixar thing going on so upset is closed
I could wait what is she doing over
there what is what is this what is this
one effort to effort for effort I'm not
sure go on that or we can't even reach
it
go ahead I think you need some help to
like reach up and get it in the first
place what is it
what okay this is cool but what is the
point in it oh there's about I'm gonna
read it and the point is and over
internal uh if you want to read it read
it every time we get closer to life
another plane we find another plane damn
it sucks that the Lighting's going so
bad right now but unfortunately I might
be able to I'm sure these I think
there's another one around the corner as
well what is this guy is he like in a
spacesuit or summer um um not fully sure

Dickinson wishing on a star
