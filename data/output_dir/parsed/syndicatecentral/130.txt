how to entertain your cats 101 are you
ready good oh that was like a goal I
guess let's try this one again three two
one go Oh kill em ooh kill em ooh kill
him oh I didn't know it was still wet
but they got my house cleaned a bout of
cleaners
it wasn't my normal person bath it was
two legends covering for bets so rather
having one cleaner who comes rather than
serve Allah rather than having one
cleaner that comes and takes four hours
to do we've had two cleaners come and do
two hours so you know two people they
can do the job twice as fast so they've
been they've came they've conquered the
house is looking clean and it's time to
start my day I've got about four hours
sleep so I'm really tired go to shower
and go into my mom down at the office
maybe nighttime outside it's two o'clock
in the afternoon don't you think then I
haven't done oh my god oh my god I just
saw four four four crows fly past my
window not again not again
third spot better no we rockin the
signature washer today but you know what
we're not roaring about yeah that vault
I don't know I'd like joke butter and
everything but like it's a real issue
that it's it's an issue because it looks
like like cuz you can you know I when
your chin that this is like weird
science with tongue but when it goes
like that cuz there's no hair on it it
looks like I have an extra chin so so it
looks like I'm I'm a mega fat in the
face which I'd like to say I'm not you
made this a green boy I need to remove
this I might actually just get like a
pen and just a biro in because this is
just not acceptable
Oh
I'm gonna admit this but I think I'm I'm
a massive massive farm boy um doctor
this respect honest to god I don't think
there's been a YouTube I've ever been so
stoked torch every stream every video
every Instagram post tweet from this guy
he's so amazing if you've never heard of
him doctor disrespect search him and
this is the song you will hear when you
associate yourself with doctor
disrespect thank that song ladies and
gentlemen and what what a device to play
on the razor listen to how loud oh oh oh
oh Secretary's dance it's like whoa whoa
whoa you've been drag racing read the
books rich rage upon what you doing
we're doing playing advertisements
without my permission
what girl well that's interesting I've
actually never seen a farmer drive
around on the quad bike but it looks
like he hasn't been doing and if you see
why I want to buy this field off the
farmer I like his permission to ride on
it is because I would make the sickest
quad bike motorbike track got a dirtbike
track and just tear it around this field
the neighbors probably won't enjoy it
that's definitely you know actually that
guy what he would actually come and ride
with me cuz he's a really cool guy but
these guys not so much but unfortunately
like I think I've said this before I'm
pretty sure that the government of
faultless land because it's kind of like
brown bail yet nearly Greenbelt and the
government have a thing where they can
just say we're taking it so we get the
first right of refusal to buy it I know
it sounds weird and we're gonna build
30,000 houses on this land instead so no
quad bike to me just a shitload more
neighbors jumper of choice oh the
Japanese one
I've legitimately got this song on
repeat in my pocket I was up so like six
o'clock in the morning last night and I
had this song on repeat on repeat it's
so good and again if you don't know what
it's called it's called doctor
disrespect
joette if you search for it it's called
Gillette the best a man can get by not
$1.99 X he's a good musician it's a
remix taken from an old Joey advert I'm
not too sure how he like came across
making it and do not like
see he's behind this in the book oh my
god it is one hell of a catchy song if
you've never seen up to this respect
dancing just type in doctor this respect
dance and you'll just be just yeah if
this woman next to you watch out she may
get impregnated it's that impressive and
men control yourself because it's just
