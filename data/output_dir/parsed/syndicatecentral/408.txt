okay Martin's of doctor anyway whatever
they are you better feel good today I
want to say I made a good decision with
these I'd like the booty boot looks of
Doc Martens but it was just a bit too
much like punk rocker to dive straight
into so I kind of went with a boot meets
trainer and you guys in the comments of
yesterday's vlog said you liked it pause
they're insane and comfortable the Sun
is out there's no rain it does feel like
it rained in the night but other than
that
soaking nice and fresh and not a cloud
in the sky so let's get ready to rock
your room or plan of action for today I
might be going to a hockey game oh it is
hella nice in Los Angeles right now okay
okay
train no my train I cannot believe it's
been so miserable the past few days and
right now it's just so beautiful so I'm
gonna go to the beach and sit on the
beach and just try and get some Sun
before I end up going back to the UK at
just one at some time this kid is
jamming one absolutely legend yeah yeah

buildings where you start the missions

like that one with the open drive but

traffic by the way traffic I'm feeling
windswept is off heck oh snap it's the
five-o

police I'd say don't look at it oh my I
don't know okay this is not funny now I
start digging my feet into the Sun and
now I'm pretty much fucking stuck
please look I look about three foot tall
about so many people by the beach oh my
gosh look how busy the pier is for again
thousands and thousands of people
I am almost confident this is so illegal
like because these helicopters that fly
around it but nonetheless oh they taking
photos
imagine if the seagulls snatch that out
there that would be incredible to catch
on camera but with this view so god damn
beautiful Buncombe is welcoming no I
thought he might gone for it
something's about to go down and
everyone wants to get their photo and
favorite body and oh my gosh there's so
many people all here to watch the Sun go
down look at that
Oh perfect timing perfect timing

wait for it wait for it still kind of
they're still cuttings gone that's it
it's gone okay everyone and now they
leave they've got their photo the people

the stable center because it's like one
straight set line and we got stopped
