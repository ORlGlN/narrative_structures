food is amazing and look at the desert
wait a minute is that jell-o jell-o
jell-o shots cupcakes dessert this kind
of like see old sushi we made it into
the cinema we are pretty daring to be
picky we're going to I'm at if he falls
asleep
nearly every flow asleep no books yeah
nearly every film I've ever taken into
he falls asleep in so what can you lose
big in yours I gotta say right now
Batman vs Superman was fucking terrible
I didn't even let that agree on one
thing they the quality is amazing the
call it was amazing but my was
completely badass the gadgets lazing but
the story was like soon was on the crack
of a DD and every drug in the world to
try and put a story I understood the
film like and you like can it even
beforehand where the story was gonna go
on not go and all that sort of stuff I
had to look at my that at one point and
be like would you get it because any
other person who has no idea of any of
the other Superman films at anything
would not doubt it freaking clear what
was going on yeah all over the place
total shit show of a film absolutely
disappointed with that I went into this
hearing like negative reviews and I went
in some I saw some fans he walked I was
like it was amazing so I was I was
stoked like that gave me faith they had
faith in that film
it looked through evening when it got
into the fight in between Batman and
Superman
that was badass
but that was like like swim in ten
minutes over two and a half fill our
fill
just to be could have been done in
seconds rather than that they did
abcdefgh
and getting to Zed so on fucking
necessary oh my god not happy but I'm
half has seen it at least it's done dad
thank you for coming watch new with me I
appreciate it Oh would you give out at
ten six a six oh I want to say I would
want to say a six because of how good it
was but that storyline even they're
ending at the very end the very last
clip five out of ten
it's that fuck I'm doing a really good
job of coming home falling asleep and
forgetting to outro my vlog I just walk
the rest of the night but honestly I've
not been doing anything for the past
three days apart from come home why I'm
that sofa and just pass out look at all
this time I managed to make my way
upstairs to a bedroom and pass out there
but yes been doing nothing but csgo the
old gambling like today you'll see in
tomorrow's vlog that I've gone against
nature I'm what a couple thousand
dollars you have to see how much I went
there for yeah things weren't good back
in the UK I'm here for about two weeks
and everything should be going smooth
sailing but I do have to wrap up today
because I'm moving into tomorrow's vlog
and there's my dad clean got my hot tub
because a lot of people asked like what
does your dad do for you now he's
finished building the house but that
works on works for me
maintaining the house like cleaning up
the property like kind of like a
maintenance man so that's what he does
for me so he's clearing out the hot tub
right now but I'm going thank you very
much for watching you guys are awesome
if you disagree with my Batman vs
Superman review don't watch it yourself
asked all the like major critics because
I totally read up on it and everyone
will agree with what I said after
thinking about it for maybe a few hours
I like letting a day pass it was a
badass film with the action that went on
there was just too much crammed into it
and they just overdid it with too much
story too much shit too much crap and it
just dragged like so badly but either
way I'm going thanks watching love yo
spaces make sure we've like written
let's try and hit three like rains and
we've a comment saying the crows must
die
goodbye
