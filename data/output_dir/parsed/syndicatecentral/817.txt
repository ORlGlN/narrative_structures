oh my days yes yes more yes and
everything about this is a yes oh I love

the Internet twittg streaming Bob Ross
to 50,000 people this is a twitch stop
TV where I do my gaming videos and
livestreams - he is just here on a
marathon the joint Peyton just Payton
and the Internet is completely EE of so
many means of confirming the happy
little files that happy little trees

that I'm gonna use my knife this is Bob
Ross if you are not on twitch right now
you should be on Twitch watching this
right now it is the future of your life
we're gonna go to Target
yes Target to come get Halloween costume
to at least be wearing something cuz
they sell onesies like Batman Superman
ones is last year I did Batman this year
might be Superman boy if they've got it
then we're going out to Hollywood if
they don't have it we're probably still
going to Hollywood but you only won't be
in fancy dress which will suck oh my god
we made it we actually made it this
Talia was actually really not close from
my house so this is good so now we have
to try and find onesies god dammit the
only ones I found is a Darth Vader one
she's pretty sick but has a cape and
everything but then I was like I'll get
a lightsaber with it and the only
lightsabers they've got a blue ones they
have no red ones so it doesn't make
sense just in the tile and look who I
find who the hell says Darth Vader can't
wear a kilt no one so that is what we're
rockin a badass kill again because I
absolutely love this thing bought I'm
tempted to kind of like shave these or
just keep them pulled up so you can see
a bit of leg bit of leg lines but I like
I think we should Papa do that though
with these show a bit a leg and B add a
face now don't mask or a lightsaber so
it's really pointless boy

kill because I want to wear it and to
have a cape yeah all right I can't help
