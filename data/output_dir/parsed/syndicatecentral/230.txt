Charlie you subscribe to her on Twitch
for 30 months in a row and also just
procrastination as well you subscribed
as well my vlog was uploaded on time
it's well not on time but like 6/10 yeah
6/10 YouTube Processing's broke so I'm
streaming and said and it's currently
half a stage so the vlog is turned a
half I was late because YouTube's broke
Evan one two three three two one
subscribe for 38 months in a row oh my
god that's sweaty subscribe for 43 but
sorrow oh my god bro bro dirty
Bob sorrow you legend 7 1 2 3 3 2 1
subscribe for 38 months in a row oh my
god hold the phone boy big fish
subscribe to 44 months in a row shower -
this guy's where what a legend oh my god
you see this is what you call a
dedication right here my my video would
not go live whatsoever so I live
streamed it by playing this video
through my OBS and live stream it to my
vlogging channel which it did and it's
now wait for it wait for it wait for it
processing yet again to see if I'll turn
it into a video if it does it before
midnight be happy but at the same time
I'm just happy to fight night it works
because it's here on my youtube channel
so really really stoked that everyone
liked it is all the comments and stuff
like that but if I delete this here is
the live comments from the livestream
and whilst it was live streaming in here
I was sat in my bedroom on my phone
watching a live stream and reply to
everyone in the chat so I think if I
ever get the opportunity I might do this
style of you know doing the daily vlog
and then when the next day at 6:00 p.m.
when it's supposed to go live live
streaming it instead because then that
way I can interact and see what people
say live and stuff like that and I don't
think is really really fun way of doing
it so very very tempted to do that again
it'd been cool to see how many views we
could have got live bought the Conor
McGregor fight light announcement thing
was on so it was like a really really
bad time but hey
really it turned out so good job much
look to these people for tuning in
really really thankful appreciate you so
admit some of its stressing me out right
now it's 11:59 in this video right i
streamed it before McKnight but the
video is actually live on YouTube like
you can watch this the links out there
I've tweeted that the vlogs like ready
to go on people can watch it like it's
available like there is the vlog I
basically uploaded it on time but I want
it I want it to appear there cuz look
it's like daily vlog daily vlog daily
vlog why is he not up here in there I'm
hoping that it pops up and says like
streamed 2 hours ago so there photos
under the midnight mark but I don't know
there's no way and see because it cost a
streamed on the 11th of July and he's
now the 12 so it did classes me
uploading a daily vlog every single day
there is it that scroll down oh I did it
I actually managed to pull I'm watching
the Conor McGregor light line up fight
but over a press conference whatever you
want to call it but oh my god I did it I
did it I managed to get a daily vlog go
alive every single day look that classes
is if I click this one this o'clock
classes as where the day wears it day
210 and if I click this this one classes
as an hour ago which takes it to the
11th what the heck was care sigh
creature plane
but the hell's wrong with the sound what
the hell's going on I decided to
livestream pop battlegrounds the entire
and you know what I'm gonna do a bit of
Inception right now because if you're
watching this vlog it's past 6:00 p.m.
on this current day which is a Wednesday
and rather than uploading it because
meaning that my house is really bad I'm
live for me again so you're now watching
me live streaming the vlog whilst
talking about livestream the vlog after
I just showed me lies from the vlog
yesterday on livestream so that's a bit
extreme ception this is like my
emergency way of streaming so the vlog
does it end up being three hours like I
never thought of this before in the
passport for those who really can't wrap
their heads around it if I tried to
upload this vlog now it's over like 20
minutes long it's 6:05 alright if I
tried to upload 603 if I tried to upload
this vlog right now it'd take me over an
hour and a half before I even went live
on my YouTube channel even uploaded or
started processing or is if our lives
true the people at 6 o'clock we're ready
to watch your vlog come watch it
straight away now it does be a bit weird
cuz you see me like intro in at the
start and stuff like that some people
like wait a minute this is not live
what's going on why is it not a live
stream I'm live-streaming the video of
the vlog so it makes sense to someone
who could understand it but to people
who counted up the head around it don't
worry you're OK pat on the head
and why why the hazard alarms going off
either way I hope you guys enjoy the
board it has been a beautiful day in
England but erm my house broke today and
you're gonna find out why in tomorrow's
vlog I mean I mean it broke its the
point I can't get out my house so you'll
have to find out what the hell happened
in tomorrow's vlog which by the way I
intend on not live-streaming just
uploading normally like this isn't gonna
become a common thing but thank you very
much for watching love you guys faces
I'll catch you guys tomorrow and here's
a sneak peak custom tipping setup I've
got so until tomorrow make sure you like
and subscribe
make sure you guys got your tickets to
insomnia 61 and as always I will see you
guys in the next vlog adios
and there you go wow the amount of
confusion doing this causes is unreal
but let me
people who don't get it still let me let
me just snap you out if I tried to
upload the daily vlog at 6 o'clock they
have just finished editing it obviously
that's me being late that's all my
that's my bad that's my fault but
instead the concept of me streaming the
episode so it's not live but it's being
streamed live as an episode for your
faces then it goes up on time ish and
then after the stream has ended it turns
into a video now it's quicker for me to
string the episode then wait for it to
turn into a video than it is for me to
just start uploading it if I started
uploading it take two plus hours for it
to even get on YouTube whereas this way
the dedicated people who are sat there
at 6 o'clock like
get to watch the vlog live now whilst
you're watching it live if you if you
still don't understand how it works if
you're watching it live like this you
can rewind the vlog from the stats so
say if you jump into the stream and
you're like just at this point you can
rewind the all the way to the star just
click let it play and watch it like this
is how it works it's really simple to
understand and then you can watch a vlog
you can rewind it you can slide you can
skip forward like after it's caught up
and you can watch the entire vlog but
some people just still don't get it so
I'm sat here behind the scenes watching
the stream and the vlog going like just
enjoying it make sure everything's gone
smoother Appliance people in the
comments banning people just be rude or
something like that it's a good way to
like monitor what's going on and
basically seeing your guys feedback but
the majority people have to deal with if
something's broke and this if I have a
stream again I don't want to do this all
the time simply refresh your stream
it'll be absolutely fine if you're
confused as to what's happening read the
description the first line of the
description says what the heck's going
on it says well it's past 6:00 p.m. I
tried to upload vlog it would take two
hours so instead I'm here live-streaming
the episode for your faces so it's not
super late I hope that's easy to
understand I think it's easier to
understand when I explain it to someone
they think it's easy to understand for
people in the youtube comments are
really struggling so if you get it if
you understand what I'm doing here thank
you for just using your brain as to
what's happening I do want to try and do
what I normally do which is upload by
6:00 p.m. but if I can and say I've got
to go out which I've got to do now and I
don't have time to upload it I was going
to be too late to get the vlog going
live this is the process I might use you
basically get a live episode airing live
and then it's turning into a video it's
not live is it hey welcome this is me
in the second right now it's just like
this like people don't get it but it's
really easy to understand once you get
it so thank you for understanding thank
you for being amazing that's gonna wrap
things up now and hopefully that didn't
hurt your brain so which love goodbye
I'll see you guys to show well yeah
yesterday I made the mistake of showing
my butthole in the camera yeah well I
actually didn't show my butthole so
that's it that's a good one but yeah I
hope you guys get it thank you thank you
for understanding it thank you I
actually prefer this method I think it's
really fun because I get to I get to
interact with you guys every thought but
I've got to go now because I go in the
daily vlog so much love goodbye and
Terios
