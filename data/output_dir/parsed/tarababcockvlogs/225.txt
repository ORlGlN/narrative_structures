hey guys welcome to my son Dave vlog
channel upload another something
completely different okay so this is
completely unorthodox for my channel but
I wanted to upload this because I feel
like it'll make you guys smile and it
was really really cool so basically Jay
and I were out at the park we were puppy
walking catching some fucking squirtles
and shit Polly wags magic harps you know
the like and we saw this adorable
fucking squirrel on top of a trash can
with like a full piece of pizza in his
mouth and he was like actually trying to
eat the full piece of pizza while like
five crows were just like circling
around him waiting for him to finish so
they can come in and steal it I actually
got pretty close to the squirrel and
there was some commentary from Jay and I
during so I think it's really
entertaining and really cute I know this
isn't the normal type of content that I
post on my channel but if I feel like I
want to post something that made me
smile and could potentially make you
guys smile I never want to feel like I
can't stray from the norm in order to do
so so without further ado here is the
squirrel the pizza and the crows
he's got a pizza
that is so cute
he's got a legit pizza piece of pizza I
feel like he's actually gonna eat this
whole piece of pizza
paint area
in these crows
oh my god this is so cute
they're waiting from the lead
why aren't they just like fighting him
for it like just trying to grab it
are they weaker
basil
anything with feathers
the same size
I guess
man just let the cross have some
this is insane how much is eating like
he's like recording
Jesus I guess if you scale this up
though this would be like the equivalent
of us eating like a whole pizza or
something because he's so tiny
I don't think wild animal does the
quality of life
I think we do fine oh my god oh my god
what now what now it's a crow fist oh my
god and they're gone oh so good alright
