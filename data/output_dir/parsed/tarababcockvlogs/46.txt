so who cares why not do your own thing
and let them say what they want what's
up guys welcome to the only room I have
never filmed in because basically it's
the only room in the house other than my
walk-in closet that has not been
unpacked welcome to the room that once I
get it set up will be home to all of my
plushies which you see here behind me as
well as serve as the room from my first
channel my gaming channel in all my list
videos my game release news basically
everything gaming that's not actual
gameplay which will hopefully be at
least half of my main channel once I
finally get it up and running there are
a ton of reasons why I haven't gotten
this room done yet and one of the main
reasons is my non-gaming plushies are
sitting behind me in bags and boxes so
today a video I've been putting off
because it seems like a ton of work
we're gonna unpackage all of these
plushies and show them off a little bit
and make a video out of it because why
not so before we get started everything
in bags and stuff from my house from my
old apartment and saved for this little
collection of vintage teddy bears
everything in a box comes from my
parents house I'm mostly excited to
unbox this stuff from my parents house
because I haven't seen these plushies I
haven't held these plushies in many
years when I was 19 ish I moved out of
my parents house and I left a lot of
plushies behind I think they still
actually have a ton of my plushies
inside their shed but I'm not 100% sure
so these are plushies from my childhood
that I'm really excited to see again and
I'm excited to share this experience
with you guys because I have no idea
what's in each individual box you guys
are ready let's fucking do it all of the
boxes in the corners are not gonna be
ones that we opened today it's all of my
collectibles my collector's editions
things that are gonna go on the shelves
that I prepare for my gaming channel
boxes in the claws that have more manga
and collectibles in them
basically it's just a clusterfuck and I
have to decide how best to display them
what to buy how to set it up and now you
can kind of see why I've been putting
this off and look there's Captain Joe
cone that's where they've been all right
guys let's go ahead and separate bags
from boxes do the bags first cuz I
already know what's in them so it's not
that interesting and we can go quickly
through it and then we can get to the
boxes organize go
all right guys we would successfully put
all of the boxes against the wall there
happens to be eight boxes and I'm amidst
all of the bags of plushies so let's
just go ahead and get opening but first
let me adjust the camera real quick all
right let's go
