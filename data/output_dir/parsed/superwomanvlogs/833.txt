hmm tastes like a double trap on
Instagram you know it one but to wash my
hair right now because it's dirty and B
because I've learned in psychology and I
told you before when you do a task for a
long time and you can't focus anymore
and and you can't focus anymore you
change what you're doing or change the
environment so like equivalent would be
um we need to teach dance and people
stopped focusing I'd turn off the lights
that's something just to get them to
refocus so because I've been doing so
many creative things
my brain is kinda die and then ice and
I'm gonna take a shower just like kind
of step away change the environment go
back figure it out that's why it was new
move my computer from upstairs and
downstairs as well but not much a shower
but a jammer does the music i7 unpacked
for my tour by the way I just we're
gonna ignore that though hmm
yo look at me I change my clothes also
one of y'all cuties bought movies you
know cute little fingers I love them so
much thank you um every time I'm doing
creative stuff this always happens I
crave something specific so now I'm
craving a Arctic cherry rush from Dairy
Queen but I'm like no it's late you

like Hello it's like she's like oh so
