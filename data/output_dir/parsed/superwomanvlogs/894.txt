we made it to Melbourne and it is
freezing out Presley

solo but yeah we're come back to afford
a pound
Victoire calm that's an it is good to
get good
I've never been to Adelaide so I have no
idea what to expect it is winter here
and now everyone's like yo did I even
pack any clothes for the winter I think
I'm rapidly sleep in my winter jacket
and so every my leather jacket
I think the legit my leather jacket is
the only thing I brought that's remotely
warm and this sweater that I wear every
single day
what do you guys to do it's gonna lock
oh so we're on our way to Adelaide
second flight
that's good damn thing also there's so
many boogers in my nose
reason Adelaide my ears are so plugged
as per usual I love what these people
everyone works as a team with suitcases
come all the dances are taking up
everyone suitcase
such a team or such a team unicorns
unite I want you to know that I'm
totally dramatic because winter in
Canada is way worse than this but oh my
god I miss my opera
my god let it dry i'm try real a baby to
a kid to die baby buddy anything alright
so I just sit in my room I told you has
to get out cuz I had to do something in
private know what I was doing was i
watch this sizzle reel of my documentary
that people are going to see and it's
not gonna be for public use but it's
better sales means are using it and even
though it doesn't have any of the facts
or any the proper foster I saw and I was
like I feel see what was said to you
Sarah watched it oh so I have come in -
no she's room even though she's sleeping
I'm gonna wake her up so she can watch
it with me if this is a we love my
documentary like a teaser oh right so
I'll be the cutter and watch it together
we have to come on a wife is gonna come
over here and watch it it's okay - I
okay hold on oh that's okay I know she
cried like legitimately cried how am I
gonna get through a whole documentary
why did you think it was so good it was
so good thank you it's like it got me so
teary-eyed any toy would you think do
not lack right dude we're all just
sitting here crying Marty it's so good
we just won by I know agreement as I
like to to know you guys are gonna die I
love you got you oh boy oh no oh my god
it's gonna be a whole different side
look remnant of my tears I don't know I
know what to tell you like there's
nothing to say but until you watch it
that's three minute can talk about it
together want share our feelings I know
Kevin maybe watch it the whole team
later
oh yeah Ryan I want to express three
things right now
Campbell's gonna help me say all these
three things also everyone takes from
iDevice show went on sale
for the multiple times um at this
happens in the tour they went on sale
without me knowing can we can we just
all Express in the room that that's not
in my control I want you also know that
is of prime importance to me that when I
say things to you they come true I have
a person of my word and anytime a mishap
with tickets happen please don't think
it's me
strategically behind a computer trying
to F you over is very much sought of my
control but they're on sale right now
how much has heard me rant about this
for a good while I can't I can attest
that every time somebody says something
that is a great business move might make
a lot of money might make her extra
famous if it involves her messing up her
relationship with you guys
she says no and if you want to see
Lily's bad side let somebody get in the
way from relationship with you so what
happened was Dubai announced this tour
they announced tickets to go on sale one
day I think she instagrammed it or
tweeted it well that was a
miscommunication with management action
that one wasn't the promoters fault well
whoever messed up
and then the moment Lily realized that
she told you guys misinformation you
didn't want to be in the room with her
that's right not that's right you're not
trying to mess a relationship I do not
do good so anyways great Thrones
Hellmouth moving forward number two
humble also watch this is a wheel for
the documentary it's amazing it's so
exciting it's I want to see how things
turn out HP makes it on tour you can see
my eye that's he make it on the tour
also third thing humble was very mama
was very excited about one thing in this
hotel why you good love is the fact that
this $4 laundry here
so there's laundry machine that's
beeping that's telling me my laundry is
done he was so excited he wrote it in
the dancer group is going on and on
about it his exact sentence a few
minutes ago was yo robber said why he
was poured all laundry so he's like oh
you're my large is gonna be done a
little bit my in the washer they the
dancers tweet um message him and then
like your humble your clothes are done
in the dryer he didn't even put through
the washer first
I thought I want you with on top I don't
know no he just finds clothes in the
dryer
essentially wasted four dollars for
Australian dollars that's like four
dollars Canadian huh and here's another
difference new harsher touch pocket I do
not know the difference dealer money
could in my condo it was the same way to
dry with the watches on the bottom so I
was on top it is the same way here and
you still messed it up we're gonna rush
it with our jack this lot of stress the
tour tickets whole on me you gotta be on
stage really eight minutes everyday
let's go you also got hungry Jack's it's
really good which is Burger King go put
your dry clothes and watch it go I'm
gonna eat this whole thing just kill my
fear we're going to the poop loses a
pool and a jacuzzi
open until midnight and she told me I'm
all about Jacuzzi life relaxation ever
possible which isn't very often life uh
yeah so he's an Adelaide seems like for
a small town and if that's ignorant of
me to say I'm so sorry I'm not
completion but it seems like a very
small quiet town where you just go
jacuzzis yeah when you're on tour the
simple things like this like I'm not
ready
luxuries we're able to wash our clothes
Oh
everyone just taking turns washing their
clothes and we're like so happy but it
you know those of us that know how to
wash clothes and not try them first
unlike our Bowl and the floor so
slippery look them all sitting in the
hot Oh
in the pool we get all these people over
here
tooru oh my god I look horrifying we're
doing work I'm making a video it's 141 I
am but I don't care because for you the
rest of the world I mean for Toronto

video like so on time that's the one
benefit of us put off my one benefit off
reliable ID temp and basically I'm
shooting in jazz room cuz they're
working in my room and I need to make a
tripod so I'm dragging things my room in
to Jazz's room yeah so they can make a
charred dish out my video it is the 351

toenail is falling off how amazing jazz

not from cleanup anthem that long ago I
really really hurt my toenails because I
danced in my Tim shoes and since then my
toenails have been dead and internally
bleeding and disgusting and now finally
new nails wearing in in the old ones
