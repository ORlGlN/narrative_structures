don't automatically be like oh yeah
they're just really good at that thing
and they got opportunities yes but why
no I did not click bait it I'm gonna
talk about Barb's right now in the
beginning of the video I'm not even
gonna do the thing where I'm making you
watch bunch this time but it right now
but first and foremost good morning
gonna have some good evening welcome to
Lily's think balls we're also harder
productivity lives here let's talk about
I've just made an Instagram caption you
don't follow me on Instagram there it is
about making it on the Forbes list again
and I want to start off talking about
this because like it's a little bit
strange because I feel like there's an
important message I want to communicate
you right off the bat because you might
be watching this one early in the
morning or you might need some
motivation I want blood for you so my
caption I basically say you know I'm
really grateful and honored to be on the
list it's not all about money but I do
feel proud about these things cuz I know
the hard work that went into this and
the most important part of this caption
is I'm not sure because I've chased
checks I'm here because I've chased
growth and I want to talk about that
because a lot of times we'll talk about
money first of all gets weird
Ivan informs us twice now and each time
I can say I get the strangest messages
from people where they automatically
assume they know me and know what I'm
about now and think they can make
judgments I mean I'm like this means
nothing it doesn't impact my personality
I'm still using a broken frying gun but
I am proud it's true but the message I
want to tell you is this and I hope you
gain some inspiration from it I truly
meant I'm not on the Forbes list because
I chase checks I say no to a lot of
brand deals I say no to a lot of events
it doesn't speak to me and I'm grateful
to be in a position where I can do that
because I know not everyone is but I
will say that one of the things you
should really focus on and I humbly am
giving you this advice and you don't
have to take it but more than the riches
you should be chasing the growth because
when you grow as a person right you will
see that naturally opportunity start
attracting themselves towards you
success and Happiness will start being
attracted to you and so when I tell
people like yo my success is not only
because I taught myself how to edit
videos taught myself how to be on camera
taught myself how to use the camera
taught myself how to write I didn't go
to school for any of those I taught
myself that those are very important yes
but it's also because I taught myself
how to be uncomfortable I taught myself
to step out of comfort zones I taught
myself to be honest with myself and not
the type of honest where I'm like oh
yeah I know I didn't do this I'm not
good and it's like no you're scared
you're making excuses what did you do
instead of working hard at this thing I
really had to address my fears and my
insecurities so yes I learned how
make videos that have ads on them to
make money but more than anything I
learned how to evolve as a person in the
most honest way possible and that really
message to you when you see people with
success and money don't automatically be
like oh yeah they're just really good at
that thing and they got opportunities
yes but why why personal growth over
everything second I also mentioned my
Austrian comment that last year there
were so many girls on the Forbes list
and this time the only girl in the
Forbes list and of course that could be
like but I've learned to be bigger than
myself and that actually really annoyed
me if I'm really honest with you last
year when I was in the Forbes list
I told humble I was like you next year I
don't even care if it's not me I want a
woman to be number one on the list last
year I was number three and then I was
so disheartened this year there's no
other women besides me and I'm number
ten and I'm like I would just hate for
the YouTube space to become a mimic of
what traditional Hollywood is because
we're so unique we are in such a
directory to be unique and create our
own path and so think about that it's
got to be a platform of equal
opportunity and yes of course like these
lists take into account projects and
brand deals and whatever other skills
they have but I'm just saying to pay
attention to the path now that we've
talked about Forbes money money money
I've learned not to be awkward about it
because I am proud and especially I'm
gonna say this I know that men are gonna
roll their eyes I hope you don't but if
such as a woman we're taught to not talk
about these accomplishment where is shy
away from money I think but no I am
proud I've made the Forbes list and I am
proud as for the rest of my day here is
the mission I know that it can be done
in post-production I don't know I gotta
write script one to two go through my
inbox hit 30 million subscribers maybe
write some thank-you cards plan a little
thing I got going on next week I don't
want to think I can't tell you about
let's do it oh I should have put wear
cool pants on my mission was that so
many points so I hit 30 minute
subscribers and someone's here to wish
all of you great job is for you and we
love you Lilly thank you so much keep up
the congrats on 13 million subscribers
team super what an eventful day 13
million when I was in school and I was
doing math test if it was a question
about 13 I wouldn't even know how to
write the number I could wait happily I
literally have to be like how many zeros
or
wouldn't even know the best part of that
conversation my dad right now the first
minute of FaceTime we thought it was a
regular phone call so I just saw his ear
because it's like my dad asks you to see
where you're truly just I'm running out
of ways to tell you how grateful I am
that's the honesty of a situation I
could write another log caption letter
post but like I'm running out of ways
because you just surprised me
in new ways every single day so thank
you so much for your support or your
energy for your time like genuinely
think about this like it's one thing to
say out there to me but 13 million
people take us in give me and us a
portion of their day but 39 people
around the world decide like in some way
I might interact with team super on
Twitter on Instagram on you do whatever
13 is not insane that's like how could
you ever feel sad or ungrateful that is
so amazing thank you so so so so so like
someone else wants to wish you that an
ornament a Christmas ornament I'm happy
to say in a script writing is going
pretty well right now I think I've got
out of my little funk I'm not being able
to write I'm in a good space a new year

as minimal cooking as possible now I

guests here Herman is a gourmet fresh
kosher vegan vegetarian meat lovers

contents I figure what you've got space
food just plastic so today's episode
cooking of Lily is brought to you by
Lilly Singh were pleased by some really
femurs so she can get some real food so
we don't have to eat whatever this is
like Lego this reminds me of when we
were on tour at the ATT you I tore this
one right here and for two days we had
to eat out of a vending machine because
our show would end exactly when
everything else goes tablespoon at the
big one okay table just two tablespoons
of water sounds like the kind of meal
if you guys don't know
that's me teriyaki comes from the region
of the world known as area and people in
this part of Asia ether noodles with
chopsticks because there are more
talented than people like me and this is
precooked noodles with sauce and
vegetables and topping so they're just
called topping toppings like what is
loose leading is there not an
infographic in the back like explain
this to us microwave on HIGH for 90
seconds okay great good to put on high
though you gonna put on a body I do I do
that
yo you know what's cool about that
microwave there's a 50-50 when you put
on 50 percent ago super hot they're not
the super hot and hipper hideout what do
you mean
but it's legal in California so the
microwave can get high if it chooses to
so what you do is power level press it
nothing is happy to clear it 90 seconds
and then you're breaking making power
level power 100 that's high
what is that a scale of a thousand how
do you know 100 hi cuz I think about the
100 emoji I'm gonna stick to my dinner
of party size Tostitos what the magic of
film has already been 90 seconds smells
like it's edible
oh but does it look it okay hold on give
it a little mix here Wow
please realize this is happening because
we didn't want to order food because
that would have taken 30 minutes as
opposed to 90 seconds okay how much I so
I'm ready you dial nine one
or something seriously but I have a
trashy palette I know I'm afraid grab
the flavors
I'm gonna go taste it like this Shipman
