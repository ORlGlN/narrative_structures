from my late night early morning
situation on earlier morning but I
didn't get his enough sleep as I wanted
to or I needed and you know me and maybe
I should take a nap and we all know
that's a horrible idea
horrible horrible idea all right I'm
sorry I did I actually did sleep for an
hour I slept for an hour and see the
whole night away it's 9:45 let's get
this video done so proud of me I took a
nap I'm hungry why why Apopka does this
pink go with this pink I decided for
today's video I'm not doing any makeup
because I'm gonna kill own natural inner
beauty also I'm so Lizzie that's the
real reason you know I'm gonna make the
same joke in the video I got his cool
galaxy shirt on I'm gonna do the video
I'm open my hair and this ring light
makes everything look good so you know
so this I might even show from pronounce
your name properly Kiera also sings that
gold song that I really like so dope I
notice this vlog of me just showing
other people's work but I just like
tweeted as well I doctor to my own horn
I like to be pretty supportive because I
feel like as a species we've lost the
art to say simple sentences that make
people feel good sometimes I feel like
we feel the need to like write really
long texts or like you know go really
all out to show people we appreciate
them and respect them or really I think
we forgot we well I mean as my opinion I
feel like the art of simple sentences
has been lost things like you make me
happy like if suddenly what you mean
sounds like you make me happy I feel
like that's a very heavy sentence that
means a lot like and so when I see
things I like whether they're songs
movies or whatever and I feel a went
away towards someone like a positive way
I'm just keep it to myself a
communicator and I encourage you all to
do the same it makes such a difference
just communicate things like sometimes
my watching a YouTube video from all my
friends like I'll text them be like
watch your video really appreciate your
talent done simple sentences the things
that make people feel good and they're
and you're being honest and I think
that's a lost art form in some ways and
so I encourage you all to bring it back
but I love this artist my videos
uploading right now it is 12 it is 1 2 3
4 right now has 1234 and I got a call at
