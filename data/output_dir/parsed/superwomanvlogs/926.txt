unicorn Island so I am so tired right
now and but that's nothing new so we're
not gonna complain about that
there's 11:30 I'm headed downtown for my
meeting with my tour director it was a
struggle to get up this month at Straub
hill and it's an extremely long day so
I'm hanging to my Tour Director meeting
that's about all my brain kingdom
function to tell you right now besides
I'm hungry I did get a chance to eat
because I woke up late
we're home so we're off to a great start
I went to my meeting and was totally
confused and there's so much confusion
during the meeting and basically was
with the assistant director who I
thought was gonna be traveling with me
and I was like gasps when were talking
he's like I'm not traveling with your
nose like this is awkward so I was we're
both really confused a lot of things he
figured out right now because I was in
the impression that he's gonna tour with
me but um anyway so for that up I'm home
now I'm gonna eat my eggs quick no I'm
eating a lot of tweets and saw a lot of
comments which is very sweet of you guys
sorry not guys and he's stop saying that
very sweet of all of you to be clear I'm
not starving myself very large tweets
are like stop starving you have you
perfect the way you are I'm not one of
those people who's like oh my god I'm so
fat you that no I don't think I'm fat I
love my body I think bodies are
beautiful I love it
but what I'm doing is to go on tour I
have to dance law and my stand when I
needs to increase it I need to just you
generally be more fit so that's why I'm
working on it's not because I think I'm
fat and to lose weight weight I'm
working out to build my stamina and yeah
lose some unnecessary fat I might have
but it's not because I think I'm bad
also I'm not starving I'm just eating
healthy I'm still eating a lot of food
and I'm not like hungry throughout the
day just to clarify your concerns are
very very sweet and precious and I love
you but I'm not starving
myself and it's nothing like that I just
need tennis stamina to dance and perform
for all y'all on tour and that takes a
little bit of building I'm having my
eggs right now I have a calling forty
minutes till cha maybe you can take like
a 20-minute nap huh yeah there's so much
better now that I've eaten I've got a
creative call in about 20 minutes
yeah my youtube backpack oh yeah that
creative content was a whole bunch of
people gonna be one of those fun
conference calls where everyone's trying
to talk at the same time and then
everyone stops to let other people talk
with then no one talks and there's
awkward silences it is with myself the
tour production company and tour
documentary director whose name is Scott
he is a sweetheart
certified unicorn I love him are we
gonna talk about this documentary that's
it's exciting it's like two big projects
at the same time not just a tour but
then a movie that's gonna come with
after so did you send flowers either my
tongue last three hours there's a series
of doing calls in bed taking the 20 men
up doing calls about taking time right
now now I was Skype meeting I must
recall with David who's in charge of
like scenic stuff so like how the stage
looks excetera Center so that's like
exciting so okay wait I have a super
ambitious idea so hopefully he's not
like stop was it yeah yo so I'm having
this awesome sauce meeting right now
with David he's like a certified unicorn
he's gonna help the stage look amazing
for a trip to unicorn Island having a
party using Skype technology so if not
if when everything looks amazing it's
David David's the man who's gonna make
unicorn I didn't come to light 5/5 David
BAM
I've said it before and I'm gonna say it
again and please understand that I'm
always real with you on these vlogs and
if I'm upset I tell you and if I'm
feeling away I tell you I love Mills
like my production company I love them
every single person I've interacted with
thus far on this tour has never said no
to me even if they think that something
would be difficult they never shut down
my idea is always like okay you know
what we'll see what's possible or how
about we do this so they offer I really
like that trait when you offer an
alternative that's similar instead of
just shutting people down I really like
that that call is amazing I feel so good
I mean I have a lot of really ambitious
and creative ideas and I appreciate that
people are willing to help me with this
I'm really excited now because this type
of stuff really excites me kind of
things look in the visuals and I get to
create unicorn island like the thing
that no one else can see was in my brain
I get to create it oh my god I'm really
excited I my homework is to sketch out
how I'd want it to look and I have no
artist sketch out how I want to look and
send time tonight so I'm really excited
to do that what I'm going to do soon is
I'm going to eat then I'm going to jazz
and I are having dinner what I'm doing
because I believe that if you go on tour
like regardless tensions are gonna get
high like I said with Chase and Ocean I
already had sat down and had my powwow
with them and I was like hey this is the
deal that another I think it's very
important to touch base on people at
you're friends with because friends and
business can get a little bit sometimes
when that gets then things get messy so
what everyone was my friend did going on
tour so they chase and oceany jazz and
cetera et cetera
so I'm also gonna definitely work with
I'm just like sitting down with them
having a dinner
basically telling them basically the
summary of what I'm talking that was
like hey should things get stressful
should I get stressed should should I do
and say things that you know aren't
completely characteristic of me because
I'm in a situation where I'm stressed
please don't like attribute it to my
personality to normal situation you
should be patient with me and you know
this is I'm basically telling people how
I might act just to give them a heads up
so they understand that like I'm not mad
at them I'm not anything it's just
touching base and making sure it'll last
andiontour is like fights with my
friends and like things like that so I'm
trying to avoid that at all costs
because you know people be tired they're
gonna be hungry people to be stressed
they're gonna their bodies in on her
there all that stuff and you know
sometimes I can get a little bit so I'm
just trying touch base with that oh and
also the Raptors are in the playoffs I
think and it's great
but they let me do a quick basketball
break down clean glass same with
basketball basically they're in the
playoffs which means that they are now
facing the Washington Wizards and it's a
seven-game series so you have to win
four out of seven games so this is Game
three and they've lost the last two so
they need to win they need to win should
they lose the next two games they're out
of the playoffs and then okay so we're
gonna go you dinner and watch the
basketball game somewhere so that's
what's happening so three minutes oh my
god I love that hmm
we North Raptors let's go I got that
faith my legs kill from that work could
I did the other day I'm trying to like
massage you know I obviously is gonna
happen like my body's not used to it so
gonna hurt but I'm just like that I'm
trying to like massage my legs in the
shower and he should die dad dad I'm
headed to remember dinner game jazz so
jazz my both discuss how we have to get
there early the game just eight so
that's what there's 7:30 because it's
gonna be round we're not gonna see both
of us it is show buddy
the place is full ain't no space there
ain't no stopping the camera there right
no space there ain't no space I'm doing
this so you can't see Josh's license

yeah so now we're like trying another
place it's all guys assault oh your
fault I was like working on work I was
like Lilly will understand should be
there in Genesis work work so you know

trying next place right now and we're
gonna order a salad and by we I mean I
made it in Sadr City in the bar
I'm kidding
so it's halftime with six points down
the game right in Toronto but even in
Toronto's downtown the cooler outside
stadium watching the big Street that's
the Toronto pride right there
what happens a rapper slice clicked in
the beginning and then towards the
middle then they go like so hoping
hoping they pull through the only six
down

supported Lee supportively also ordered
a salad I'm sorry because my salad was
small and I'm ordering a veggie burger
