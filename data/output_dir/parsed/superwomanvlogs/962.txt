I'm full of regret why why did I stay up
so late last night
I'm so tired and my head hurts so much I
know my god it's Monday oh my god
oh my god hello friends wonder why I'm
not using my new blogging camera yet I
don't know I just haven't set it up yet
am I taking her out of the box and I
said already but I will but I will um
jazz here sound easier yes safe to say
we're all very sleepy no llores feel
just killing the outfits killing it
we're not killing the hair actually
killing the makeup though we're an odd
location in a cave today there's a
little bit cold enough squeezing and
just shutting down but now the sounds
coming out a little more happy out of
all conditions like I feel like I'm a
nice person and easy toward the person
except when it's cold that is the one
condition where I'm just like I cannot
do it
I cannot weather Renee always keeps me
warm and Chandra gives me robes and it's
all good all right let's do the damn
thing you know it's lunchtime I just
seen where I had to fake fall and I kind
of fell harder than I attended to and I
landed on a rock in a very unpleasant
place and usually I would not be opposed
to landing on the rock but this was
different
it's really forgiving cuz I'm so tired
right now honestly I'm so tired the
girls do my makeup and I was falling
asleep in my eyes when he one closed
she'd doing makeup and I was like every
two seconds the struggle is true I know
I need a nap
I'm just channeling the Sun
and so Louie's doing some Bodmin things
inside a cave today and you can see the
Hollywood sign
stop shooting in these caves oh that son
though a lot of getting dirty falling
all over the floor and pushing my knees
and elbows are bleeding right now well
it's fine it's fun times so I love the
cast and crew they know that any time in
between takes if I'm not shooting
something for home and I'm gonna go
towards the Sun because it's cold in
there every time I come up towards the
Sun so they just know in between takes
about ok that's good Lily you can go out
to the Sun they just know where to find
me
really really I said Ruben my tribe
because it's a guy that distracted me
but today is super Monday and I'm gonna
have to pull one of those like shooting
for a bunch of hours and hey Lou there's
a pull one of those shooting for a bunch
of hours go home and like try to make a
video situation so I apologize if it's
late again but you oh man I'm so tired
and I feel like it's affecting my
performance right because I'm so tired
and I'm just like how much pain takes
but I gotta wake up
dad wake up this next scene is
particularly hard because I'm actually
talking to someone who and you think
would be easy for me cuz I do it all the
time my own videos talking to someone
who's not actually there this is bit
different because I've actually never
seen the person or actually had a
conversation with them so it's different
from like me talking to my teeth or
bottom teeth when they're not there but
uh it's tough this is it this is a
challenging shoot me
