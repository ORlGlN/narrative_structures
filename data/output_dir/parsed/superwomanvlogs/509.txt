excuses I'm a bad person not a bad
person oh you guys go tell him to work
I want to write two chapters and Kyle's

excited and it's very hot it's very hard
I like it I don't order some room
service you ate on the plane right yeah

of the time they're gonna have Chris
carrier meal every I got even shocked
anymore going to the plane like you have
to show it often for me because like I
call them for ready like nom
like I don't even doesn't even faze me
anymore I was like I know you're not
gonna have it that's that's a
complicated thing I didn't order it and
your salmon order room service and work
on chapters so y'all know I'm really
cheap right I'm gonna be cheap until the
day I die I'm just cheap I don't care
how much money I make it life I'm gonna
be cheap it's just how I am I had a room
service okay forget everything else were
great it's all good so there's a charge
on my receipt called tray service so
when they talked to me on the phone like
oh you wanted to go back so do you want
to barf in a tray I was like no I'm
saying here's a tray so to bring the
food in this tray right here did you see
was $12 extra to put it on this tray and
upstairs I tray service of $12 - the
audacity was smart enough my first job I
would have to work two hours to pay for
that tray surface right there ridiculous
anyways everything's going great over
here we're going over some creative
stuff we're gonna get it done right Kiel

Kenya qu'il qu'il okay so in every
person I was in Kenya just like Michelle

different names yeah CheY my shell the
one name no one could pronounce with
Kyle I was like oh how the tables have
turned here how the tables have turned

him asked to have a heater and they're
like people are usually complain it's
too hot I'm like well I'm complaining

nervous because we have such a small
amount of time and we want to capture
stuff that's good I want to make it a
great video I mean I don't want to just
make I never want to just make videos or
like all it'll be good anyways cuz this
person's in it but why someone may be
really good I wanted to be meaningful

it it works out well and I'm sure well
I'm just nervous cuz like to perform
under pressure where it's like you've
this many minutes and like this is what
you got to say like these are talking
points just like a little bit you know
