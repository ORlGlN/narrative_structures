no you're wearing the same clothes from
yesterday good money time at 11:03 guess
what I did not speak English we like
guess what I just heard
I just finished my audition I don't like
to evolve before my edition of early in
the morning as I want to get in the
mental mind it was hard I believe that
like 90% of my audition is getting
mentally prepared even though I didn't
have that much time to be prepared I did
my best I went in there I was charming I
was polite I was nice I guess I have to
act also but I acted I felt a little bit
and then I made a joke being like yeah I
can't say numbers in the morning and
everyone laughed so hopefully they
thought it was funny my thumb was a
little bit but I did try my absolute
best and that's what counts and what I
think I did it you know I don't like
auditions they're very difficult to do
they're very uncomfortable to do and I
used to doing them but I've committed
this pilot season time seasonally right
now which means is auditions on
additional auditions it's not how I
would like things to operate because I'm
from the digital space that I believe
like there could be a new less
traditional less weird way of doing
things but the sound is right now and so
I did it and I'm proud and now I have
like 30 minutes I spit on you I'm sorry
about 30 minutes in time you have to
head to my book recording which is going
to be like nine hours and after that I
have to put my tailor hasn't been long
day but tonight I vowed to watch a
little bit of Jane the Virgin and go to
sleep early because I deserve it I'm
working really damn hard I deserve it so

not that impressed
I don't know it was okay but I was like
an end very well and one point got
