lot to do but like maybe I should do it
later but today no we're not gonna
procrastinate what up t-shirt reference
I'm sorry I promise this whole day will
not be full of cat puns you know the
main thing this wasn't full up is
positivity I want I cannot be not
focusing just got work with me Polly's
she's the thing for searching for movie
times R I feel like in a group of people
there's always that one person that's
responsible it's like I'll search for
the movie times and that's me with my
parents if I want me to do anything or
otherwise I should look like stay home
we have bBYO movie at home comfortable
blanket watching you leave the house
sometime that can't we do that so what
are the movie times Annabelle is up
Annabelle came out today I love horror
movies I want to watch and what my
parents were just trying to piss
themselves Thomas god no I do not need
that awkward situation Thomas bond is
great but watching my parents by Indian
peers that's not going to be fun because
they're gonna be naked and we're like oh
hello hello yeah I sweat you all yeah
why that's gonna be me I can't no no no
no I heard my mom say the word sex once
because she was sitting on an
application form I almost died well
emoji movie Despicable Me like a movie
is Wonder Woman not playing you get your
be mollified a theater 9:21 woman I've
already seen it but I feel you need to
see it all right down in our place you
just know
that doesn't really take much persuasion
no she don't get it but you do cleared
my inbox can you just oh wait here's the
thing about paying people I think people
should be paid but I'm such a cheap
person well like we can't just give
people some skittles like can I pay you
and skittles I have so many skittles do
not want skittles snorted it's a method
in which I pay people I have this long
list that comes in this database thing
and that list is not show me my incoming
money only shows me my outgoing money so
every time I go through this list and
like did somebody have a fresh I'm open
bottle of vodka for me I did a no-no I
get annoyed I just need to sanitize my
hand I swear I swear you I don't need a
hand sanitizer I just need the vodka
give me the bad like you've got to be
kidding me right now I just had to stop
for a second because I'm doing I look at
a corpse right now just like to do this
because I'm just killing the game
sending so many important emails I'm
sawing like good non-stop non-stop I'm
like y'all am young and I will prosper
okay I'm done I promise I'm done I'm
done doing my work you know what I mean
getting them down and data bills getting
that paper I did two really cool things
genius moments number one I just tweeted
something I came up with on my own just
came to my brain it was if you don't
lead by example
you can't complain as a bystander in
that cage my brain feels like I'm
working so hard doing a bunch of things
I was actually lying down when I thought
of it I was working so hard doing what
two things and thinking about a whole
bunch of people in my life that complain
about things that are like oh like this
isn't working out career-wise that's not
working no school-wise or not where i'm
going to be but that the last people to
do something about it so it's like in
your life if you're not happy about
something you want to change something
and you're just complaining about it
that doesn't fly you need to lead by
example especially when it comes to like
social justice I feel people aren't
socially or so used to jumping on face
and be like well this is wrong coach let
me incorrectly use the term cultural
appropriation let me incorrectly use all
let me label feminism what I think it
should be according to know if you don't
actually do anything in your real life
and lead by example you cannot be
complaining right it goes back to like
this idea that humble talks about and
like it's okay people are entitled to
their opinion egos no people are
entitled to their informed opinions like
you got to actually put some effort
and that's number one number two reading
this book it was recommended to me by a
Harley called content wrap and there's
one fact in here where I was like yes
and kidding me oh no I lost nothing
right founder check this out this is
freaking amazing get it says five
excavates or five billion billion bytes
of data could store all of the words
ever spoken by humans between the birth
of the world and 2003 so between the
creation of the world in 2035 excavates
of data was every word ever spoken by
human in 2011 five exabytes of content
were created every two days every two
day we were created every word said by
humanity starts with the digital ages
and that's what the Internet has done
that's what YouTube and everything is
that is the world we live in
so I think I was very loud and very
fast-paced my last clip and I sounded
like a catastrophe welcome to today's
episode of less embarrass the crap out
of Lily we show you some of my older
pictures warning warning may be posed to
extreme amounts of cringe and crust ball
when I say researchers erased all God
burns over time mainly Shrek and I just
graduated from elementary school grade A
and not allowed to get my eyebrows done
yes yes which is why it looks like
butterflies are about to hatch out of
the goddamn chatter to the situation
above my eyes right now I also don't
believe in having one chin I can see
like why not have multiple and and it
smile really happy well the kind of
communicate was like I have to fart but
I'm gonna hold it is good hey I'm also
continuing a trend of having multiple
chains I also these major hoop earring
in my ear because I want to pull on the
girls because people get confused a
often as you can see I'm wearing a
copyrighted Superman chain because I
don't understand the law and if I ever
make a youtube channel I'm going to make
sure it's copyrighted
also my journey says six six because if
you have another six it'll make sense
why I look like this because I clearly
saw the decibel Southern I'll appreciate
in this one you know and anywhere purple
sue my hair I know look at how to cue in
this picture I was imposing this is a
candidate know back in the day when you
have the developed film or digital
cameras didn't exist ah be paid like
twelve dollars to develop this single
picture right here right here you
I just decided that I am going to be
avoid indecision fine because I've
always been tomboy but I'm going to
decide that in front of Christmas tree
you know because things are handle it
pun intended
i'ma just block this picture with this
bomb bomber jacket pun intended with
these khakis right here I just get yo
kinder Me Tender me write it one out
Lois hand man okay camera can't even
focus on the face of like is that a face
or is that a butthole okay come on I got
just adorable
I got nothing I'm just adorable look at
me I read my pose in front of this
aquarium with this little animal over
here you don't really pee you're
trending down my neck I'm so goddamn
scared but my daddy said I had to pose a
fighter cuz we paid full price came to
the zoo they said if we get introduced
to having a picture for his audience and
all the animals so I took so many
pictures and went by so many I mean 32
because that's how much film I had my
disposable camera you know the one was a
cheap question I'm talking about you
young and privileged your back of it it
all right there was no speed birds okay
you had one chance one opportunity to
seize everything you ever wanted if you
missed it go back and just picture out
this frame right now that head-fake
today I'll there's another a picture
behind the picture the print I had this
one in or not okay she looks really
really tragic let's just cover the
kitchen hide this behind the pictures of
northern over 10 acres picture never
opportunity let's just take a moment
okay
Lonnie's been around and kicking for a
while as you can see like well I oh my
god oh my look I got headshot for
someone that was auditioning for like
someone that lived just in the worst
condition like a tragedy movie they're
like listen we need people that have
been through some sort of turmoil and
you send in your headshots of you in
distress and I'm like right here right
here you look at the chin like that and
you're like I just want to thank you
people for how I look today because I
think today I look maybe a little bit
except I haven't people an exact same
place of that picture something's ever
changed I'm just like well it's so nice
to have two eyebrows because I didn't
always have two eyebrows is a new thing
for me I just did just so many people I
want to say I want to thank my sucker
nor think that lady that used to
threaten me nor one little piece in her
mouth that looks out I want to thank you
I want to thank sunglasses for hiding my
unibrow when I had what I want to thank
top sockets know for allowing me to hold
my phone and we won't fall on my face
and possibly maybe not
eyebrow back to my face or thank Google
drivers that don't talk to me because
that's the real way tier five starts me
that's you know not some talk about I
want to thank you so many people that
made this moment possible you know how I
thank face mask first helping me clear
up some of this even though I have my
deeds because you know I watched Jim
Carrey the mask and never thought that
was my future face max I want thank you
okay it's a regular one thank you
boosting my confidence I'm kidding at
that no filter for life except for
except for most the time when I'm close
to the temperature but right now the
purpose of this rest no filter because
that's the key to success altering your
argument according to the situation
kidding kidding
