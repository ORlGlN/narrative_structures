had a guy diem like goes do it papi I
have traveled all across the country and
come back just for this moment just for

is still the greatest thing on the
planet when you break up so tight but we
don't kill it now we need to put my
clothes in the dryer because then wash
it right now I need to pack on the two
hours not enough time but let's do it

coming back I feel like it's personally
harder like what I'm leaving humble and
I'm like I wish I could they can come
with honest and usually come with all
good I don't think like there's very few
times I've ever been to any other humble

yellow suitcase just like a TTY when we

logging very horrible role when you

the vlog this midday where I need to end
it because I was a data half now I guess
let's see how we did
mmm-hmm
thank you for joining me on today today
being Wednesday oh my gosh Merle Yuna
again how did this happen oh my goodness
I don't have video Bank so it's going to
be interesting timing videos well on the
side of the tour but I'm excited for my
show tomorrow the prostate after you
can't win in India India to the storm so
I know some of you were messing with
being away this exam time and the
tickets are pricey and then everything
in my power try making them as cheap as
possible
apparently the economy in India has
changed that's making tickets more
expensive as I've been told from
promoters and I also looked up ticket
prices for other shows and currently all
those those are all successes so I don't
know what changes that happen in the
economy essentially if you have exams is
the perfect break it's a one hour show
and when you go home it'll motivate you
study for your exams even more so
hunters debt if you want if you care if
not I still love you don't worry that
I'm going to go and not nap right now
until tomorrow or I guess I'm gonna shut
the ball right now guys don't start
tomorrow morning
