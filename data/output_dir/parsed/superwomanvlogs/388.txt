have to do something anything has to get
done today it also just starts snowing

my teeth and go have some soup and then
I'm gonna I have so much work to do as

eye boogers everywhere and like jewel
marks everywhere and I don't care you

illusion it's actually really nice

something don't mind me just sitting on
a yoga ball because I don't want to walk
up the stairs in the kids playroom baby

shower okay here we go and I'm taking
shower
I also suck at basketball again no no
here we go here we go oh my god come
back here you know it's because I'm
vlogging all okay you see shower that
made no sense that I want to take a
shower so why did I try to get it you
see that's thing pride versus shower
god damnit pride one a lot of people see
this picture of my videos and they're
like how
over here so this is something little
Amer shots that we had back in the day
so I'm with a little kid in this I just
looked a dolt cuz they did my hair and
makeup like this and maybe was outfit
and stuff but like yeah this is also
fetus Lilly right here she just Lily
fetus Lilly non er yes that's right I
took Shyam from the exact same clothes
because there's nothing as warm as a
onesie also I realized after I was on
vlogging last clip there was so much
crap on my face and you just accepted me
there was like I've over here the dry
skin here and you just accepted me or
talk crap whatever I had no different so
you know it's all good let's go do
something something also shower
something doing stuff so hard I know I
need to do so I spent all my emails so
emails ding but I'm so much work to do
and I keep like I'm so weak and I have
no energy also make me soup now I hate
my mom's like you're always sick when
you come here I'm like I know it's like
I'm even more of a pansies moving to LA
too cold a second I'm too cold in my
boom and I get sick to be fair my
nephews over and they were sick as well
so I got sick but I'm just like I have
no energy to sit and do anything I have
some soup maybe some like Aero remesh
doesn't like pop to like you know at
myself some sugar or something I had a
hot Yves about me I know you because
okay relax I've been doing this like two
days now I have things to do things need
to get back down I used weight too much
energy can we just take a moment to
appreciate the fact that this happened
also five months crabbers I mean goddamn
I always look at this every once in a
while it's above my bed my vision board
I'm like wow wow this hasn't happened
Ellen but hopefully soon if we keep
working hard it will happen we're gonna
keep trying just went poop just you just
watch an episode of jane the virgin just
that's something right i'm so i want to
address something yesterday my twitter
was blown up and so was Sara's and so
was Kyle's and so is every other person
I know because I guess some of the
videos for the end of your video weren't
going through I was very sick yesterday
and so I was just like not able to
address it but I'll address it now I
don't know of another way that people
can submit videos like I don't have
another way so I did the same thing I
did last year which was submitting it
via email I guess more people are part
of team super than last year the inbox
did get filled and there was nothing I
could do but it because emails are
coming in so quickly so I do want to
apologize to everyone that did
in a video and it didn't go through I
have more than enough to make the video
in I think there was just like an
intense amount of video submitted right
away and so I do apologize if you worked
hard in your video could not have been
submitted I honestly can't think of a
solution to that problem and if I could
have I would have done something about
it I was like just dying in bed so I do
apologize and I thank you for all the
time and energy and effort you put into
it I got a lot of really great
submissions and I can't wait to release
the video because I think it's only Q
and it's nice closure for the year so
whether you're featured in it or not
you're still part of it cuz team super
we're all still part of it together so I
do want to thank you apologize but
inconvenience at time is 7:30 and 736 30
does it convert 6:30 my computer's on La
time my phone's on trial time I am gonna
try to do a little bit of work a little
bit and then before I watch my next
episode because the goal is to do
something just send two really important
emails just killing the game it is a
one-time thing moving 814 is only 814
but I think I'm gonna like eat something
right now blow my nose and then do a
little more work I'm proud I'm sitting
in a functioning hashtag function now -
for sure what's up my babies my babies I
got a lot of work done I did more than
I've been a last day so I feel better
about myself my um review video I know I
initially said I'm ready mature faction
ounces but I wasn't originally planning
to release it on the 31st but now I'm
going to release it on January 2nd for
the following reasons one I want to get
back to my Monday Thursday schedule and
31st is not on Monday or Thursday
I don't think anyone's gonna watch on
31st just because it's New Years Eve and
usually people spend that with their
family
and realistically I don't think I can
make a video for that Monday which is
January 2nd so I went over to January
2nd for those reasons so it'll be like a
piece 2016 yo 2017 is here type up I
hope that's okay I'm excited to get back
to LA and jump into a video schedule
some of the old formats that I know
you've missed some of the new ones I
want to stick to and just try to do
things in advance and not have the
struggle of day of videos that's the
goal for 2017 it is trying to not do
things the day of and trying to give
myself more time so that's the plan
letting you know now I'm gonna go eat
something and then I think I deserve an
episode of Jam the larger
Oh fun fact about me I am like obsessed
with children's breakfast foods I don't
need their children's eye I would like
to believe they're still for adults but
like Lucky Charms Froot Loops pop-tarts
toaster strudel so my mom she knew I was
sick and one with spoils and she got me
toaster strudel I love that ish you
don't know what that is or where you go
they don't have it first of all praying
for you second of all it's like this
feel like strawberry filled pastry and
you put this icing on top and use the
thing let me break it down for you right
if you're an OG and you know when you
eat these things one of the issues that
occurs is that this comes from the
freezer and so when you're trying to
spread on your strudel this spread
ability is not at a maximum because it's
cool it's almost frozen this is what you
do
you hold it it's not gonna get her back
in but you hold it just above right just
right here right here just like that
like that like that and it becomes more
liquidy thus allowing it to spread now
that changed your life get used to it
this is what I do you can go ahead
subscribe but anything like anything
that requires you to spread stuff for
example in an airplane are you trying to
keep you like the margarine and butter
it's always falls and you can't spread
that is your margarine as a rock-hard
and you're like try to spread it on the
bread and your bread disgust massacre so
what you do I take the little thing of
margarine and I'll put it in the side of
the hot food thus melting it I mean that
I don't just do comedy okay I change
line so what I do what up by changing
live check okay okay so that was
supposed to say I love you but I'm back
to my camera kind of melted but I made
you understand I love you because of the
spread ability yay me Tommy he ma I
believe I can touch the scare me you
don't want juice aka water so I'm on my
like what but Jillian's episode of
ginger virgin and it's okay
cuz a great frickin show but for the
record this is why I don't watch shows I
saw my friend cuz all my friends like
happy watches have you watches I know it
seems like I watch large shows I only
started watching Game of Thrones because
I wasn't teeth got removed I need to be
distracted
I'll start watching The Walking Dead
because Game of Thrones ended I wouldn't
watch stranger things because every
meeting I went to it every person from
the industry was like using stranger
things as an example so I said okay let
me see what they're talking about
I stopped watching Jane the Virgin I was
your first episode when I knew I was in
cloud with Jeana
I knew Gina was a phenomenal actress but
admittedly I was late to the Jane the
Virgin Trains solar cycle camera shoot
with her let me
watch and let get used to her acting and
stuff so I can like write the script or
like you know edit the script
accordingly I got hooked that's it
that's it
so this is why I don't lead watches up
obsessive have obsessive personality and
I get so involved in the storyline in
the characters and I need show happens
and so I just need to hurry up and
finish all the episodes or laughs I'm at
season 2 episode a and there's like so
many more episodes we have even though
home go gia are you told me what happens
mistakenly but it's okay because I love
her yeah this is why I don't watch shows
everyone's like you know have you
watched like black mirror like orange
new black um I don't do I can I can't
but then it's also okay because I'm
watching shows helps me write scripts so
thus it's fine but I'm saying this is
why I don't don't be commenting below
tell me what to watch cuz my life will
be over my life will be over hot-hot
change my clothes
I won't talk what's me real quick as I'm
serious just that you know I'm so so
real with y'all I had to be real after I
have to let something real up some
people's comments on my videos were like
you're clearly sponsored by coke and I'm
like a dumb or dumb or dumb I wrote
sponsored by coke in the damn video
y'all know I'm partners with coke and I
know I shouldn't let the neck is nothing
that the negative comments are bothering
me it was more so amusing to people like
wow you think we can't tell this is a
coke coke like branded thing I'm like no
you should be able to tell because I say
I'm partners with coke I said her mind
y'all I will never work with someone or
a company that I don't actually
genuinely like that's my trade off I
don't care if it's obvious I want you to
know from being paid to do a video if I
have a paid like partnership or
something I want to tell you coke
smashball you know why do trade office I
want you to know because that will hold
me accountable to make sure that I never
work with a company or for a product I
don't actually like every endorsement I
have I actually freaking live I was
saying coke tastes better in a glass
bottle way before I had a partnership
with coke okay I was eating skittles way
before they ever gave me skills for free
okay
and yo I was always rocking a red lip
way before I had balls so just in case
just in case is any confusion yes I am
partners with these people
yes sometimes money is exchanged because
sometimes I need to eat and I want you
to know I am NOT trying to hide it from
you and be sly but no no please no cuz
that way you will know when you see a
branded piece of content on my channel
you know I actually like that ish
straight up and down I got nothing lad I
don't know any other creators are trying
to like get sly with y'all in the
comments like oh it's so I'll be good
let it be obvious you should know I try
and keep a real out here I think in a
fever you know
goddamn no I'm saying ah well we're here
for you me accusations and a bra yeah my
check this I'm gonna pull Shane Dawson

was in my room so I'm gonna create a
thumbnail and show you me creating
