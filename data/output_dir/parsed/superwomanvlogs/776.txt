tattooed on my forehead but I won't like
ten minutes late
we are heading to rehearsals let go no
good see I can't see back showing the
same shirt again you know it was like a
little really I'm like honestly I'm

studios we use to audition the dancers
so very full circle here what is the
date it's the 12th which means there is
t-minus five days and tear it I'd show
let go
no a lot of free show tickets
son we've already sold more tickets than
all of the other shows it's already
you're gonna be the biggest show yes so
good joke ticket in the description
alright I'm listening to revival in 9
minutes and release in Club her team is
approved as you know watch it and
improved it everything's good to go I'm
releasing this video I hope is so much
that you love it because it's not like
my usual videos you know I don't usually
do games or challenges but this was just
like a really special moment for me
because like I said before you know I
love Selena Gomez you know huge fan but
more importantly I get a lot of
inspiration from her and it was just
great to meet one of your inspirations
and see that they're wonderful in real
life as well like that's a great feeling
I would hate to ever meet someone I look
up to and have them be like not what I
expected Hugh just exceeded all
expectations I'm really excited for you
to see this 9 minutes oh do you Q&A on
Twitter right now and I'm really excited
um practice was also great I literally
busted what a different members for five
hours is what we did I swear to God look
I'm funneling five hours we just did
this like we just literally whined for
five boss I whine for five hours
prepping for ten to five days until the
show three days until we leave I but
let's focus on this right now
video
I took a nap is suppose to be 30 minutes
in that is two hours later and okay so
fortunate I'm actually if you come to my
show or if not I can tell you right now
oh geez
mind the rock who I raccoon eyes I just
rubbed my face that I must get on but we
came the show I have a 30-minute
countdown and then during information
I've countdown as well and songs are
playing but I'm actually changing all
the songs since you know it's been a
while since I made those songs but I'm
actually making them all my favourite
reggae chutney and soca songs so just
know that all the songs you hear I
hadn't picked by me favorite songs I
just realized I forgot like we generally
forgot to edit today's vlog with all the
stuff I was doing so I'm gonna stop
everything and do that right now
mmm just give me permission to watch
yeah it is
2:30 3:00 a.m. and I'm going strong
chill in the game right now I'm strapped
in killing the game right now all right
so it's 446 a.m. I just did a whole
bunch of work for the Trinitite show
basically reduces I'm adding a whole
portion that a whole good ten eleven
minutes to the music set and it's
requiring me to like do all the cuts and
make video for all those things that's
quite a lot of work also so dad is
coming and Uncle John is coming but
Tarzan Nick is not coming so we have a
new AV guy I think they'd have to send
them all the files we have to break down
the whole show for him so it's a bit
difficult because like we had 30 shows
with our last cast and this is gonna be
his one show so he has to nail it one
time no mistakes and so I'm doing that I
also just went through the entire shows
choreo because I it's been a while since
we performed it there's a lot of dancin
teams to show you there's a lot of dance
like definitely gaps my memory that we
practice but um she's not the whole
thing and I'm a little bit nervous if I
could I remembering all my stand of
memory everything it's hopefully Trinity
audience is gonna be nice to me if I
forget but that's the plan and it's a
13th t-minus two days totally we got lot
of stuff to do tomorrow wanna try to
like find an outfit because I think I
want to change my old for the music
sites okay
whining rain properly you know but for
now I think I'm gonna just call it a
night go to bed and hopefully I fall
asleep thank you for joining me on
another day and tomorrow we got
