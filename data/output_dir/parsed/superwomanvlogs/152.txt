who are you expecting someone else
that's ridiculous is my channel good
morning welcome back to another daily
blog that's not how I start my vlogs I
don't know why I said that trying new
things is important for life welcome
that I didn't get what we want
hello I'm Hannah Hart I don't
good morning good afternoon good evening
good night wherever you are I hope you
are splendid and wonderful today I woke
up and had a top of my self of a talk
sounded like this I said dear little
words and up-tempo that aside I said
dear Lord today my happiness and
patience and calmness and positivity is
in my control and nothing in the outside
role will impact that because I am in
control and no negativity will enter
this space and that is my ultimate
vision for today but aside from all that
mmm here are the rest of the missions I
might act music for my dad's birthday
party I got a hell how a man's worth a
party I don't you're saying this when I
happen to be read the script Fahrenheit
451 and because of all my friends issues
I gotta fix this eyebrow upper lip
moustache situation it's also Game of
Thrones and we gotta watch that I sum
all that like I said positivity will
prevail gonna be lit let do it just kind
of fix my eyebrows up and I literally
feel like I lost 10 pounds you probably
can't tell the camera or maybe you
couldn't hear like fine but I think call
that a Chanel when you're free of you
you know I started this vlog channel by
pulling off an old strip from I know
divestment first-ever blog shows up
welcome to my daily vlogs so I thought
let's make it real Milas
continue the realest I learned wax my
upper lip not a Reaper shoulders because
it's with all my girls and probably guys
magical creature shaker faces and if I'm
a girl and the cloud is probably just
spill the tea for you of what I do and
all you wanna like that's what every
girl you know including your girlfriend
whom you relate the esterday all on her
face West Berlin is not a brand deal
hashtag not as I use these Nair strips
right on there
the results are brand-new naturalizes
the troubles or watch this whole family
super super quick no mess I will show
you the Brenda this is literally what it
looks like it won't take me though
actress the white piece Pat finger
literally what you do is you don't have
to decide who I rub it in my hair like
this to make them a little more but you
don't have to do that you don't want to
be Drake like I'll show you
ultimate no flinch zone right now
because I've gotten so uses you pull
them apart there's two strips to spread
and it's what you do that's the wax and
really on put it on and I'm gonna press
it down so I get down pressing it down
turn it down 15 seconds right what you
want to do is you want to pull off the
directions be careful my head was this
way I put this way I do this well you
talk very much no clips on know they
know they know they know the other
utility buddy here don't worry about the
wax that stays off and for that little
clean pad for but now use the same to do
boom-boom I don't forget this a really
annoying part up there this is all weird
because I closed for thumbnail and that
anyways put her in there this is the
most painful part ladies your you know
that are done this pull up
that's like so telling you resilient one
last spot over here boom don't even try
to not use this because your face will
be sticky no matter how much soap and
water you use soap and water doesn't
work on lab and use this if you wanted
to be because obviously it will give you
enough of these guys broke you can just
use like an essential oil or on the face
or go coconut oil and like whatever F
just to wipe it off to get it on then
you can wash your face or never let me
open the whole pad and this won't take
this issue at all you're going to be rad
for about five minutes as fun when the
goddess late tonight you know beyond

turbulence because I smooth assess boom

was longing less than two minutes ladies

quinoa kena district shower from same
clothes licenses the
I feel like I'm not a saga actually with
love and peace and silence scares me and
everything that's happening in the world
right now with white supremacists or you

tape that I have not yet done let me
just print these sides eyes being the
lines that were memorizing report on

camper about that not a happy camper
weather day is fine but I'm not even
inside inside why did he come he turn
into Moretti with my father staying
superwoman again when I totally forgot
this was hospital I've enjoyed did tweet
about it this morning but I totally
forgot because I'm the shoulder bars I
shut up don't ask me like that shut your
face okay
you want just me but you're sitting over
there shut they want to change our words
and you all put so much effort into
voting and I know you got mad at me
because I don't promote myself and yada
yada yada you know I have a very like
weird relationship with award shows
because I think it's so great to be
nominated I'm so grateful to be
nominated for things but I'm not a fan
of voting things because don't make this
a three minute rant movie but I'm just
saying I'm not a fan of and this is not
so shade at any like the Teen Choice or
anything I think they're all great but I
don't mind a fan of getting people to
vote for hundred times a day because it
gets a young kids to sit in front of
their computer and argue with other
people online about who should win and
spend their whole day tweet up 200 times
and they could be doing such productive
things otherwise you know what I mean
where I in my heart don't even believe
you can calculate those Losos nothing
anything around I mean I want to teach
worse award know what's happening it was
great but don't feel bad I don't I'm not
sure who won but don't feel bad we
didn't win and I'm not sad and I would
never want you to fight with other
people and I appreciate so much the mass
voting you did all the voting it really
does mean a lot to me but I just want to
make it really really clear that it's
not one of my priorities and I am
grateful but it's not what makes me
excited to wake up every morning and so
I just don't want you to beat yourselves
up about whatever happens we also chip
it so I think I'll not marry for three
categories I think Jake Paul won two of
them
I think Liza 120 which makes me over the
mother accent move I mean I I want to
laughter think she wears this year go
round girls represent that makes me feel
I think I can't go on Twitter because
the game thrown things but big up
yourself Liza I don't really watch chick
so I can't comment on I'm in Congrats
but I don't really know this stuff
that's all about all that I just say it
for you when you stand and unproblematic
Queen just I just I just say for you
well then some I do this game of Thrones
thing I might as well just do it right
mind will change top' some popcorn get
some coke zero like some candles print a
picture of humble place up beside me I
mean we won't do what you gonna do it

ii think i knows vollis already so long
this is gonna make the struggles of
living in canada are just ridiculous HBO
the website you can watch the episodes

better
family Hey
alright that was a decent episode decent
episode with it was the last episode the
last episode was I yeah this is a decent
episode for sure in home already
murdered almost you what you think
thoughts going we're such nerds tomorrow
is my first day shooting and it is a
night shoot my pickup time is 9:10 p.m.
which means I will be shooting all
through the night which essentially
means my schedule is gonna completely
flip and I'm going to be an owl because
shoes are usually 14 hours long so I'm
gonna get the entire night I'm like 100
is not early I'm kind of worn down with
that I think that a productive day
didn't really do that much work so if a
different type of productivity maybe
like the family friend valent whatever
if that is also I did read my portion of
the Fahrenheit script they changed it to
send me an update and I did rely I did
get point to that I think we did it

long but I'm really happy you're on this
journey with me and I appreciate you so
so much so strap in for the ride and
