and you begin what everyone while it's
not a main channel
I mean hello this is my second channel
where I walk today I'm shooting my first
collab I woke up a little while ago ate
breakfast edit the vlog post to the blog
and now I have a 45 minutes until the
crew comes an hour and 45 minutes until
my first cloud comes your very excitable
and I have to hide from you I have to
I'm basically having an affair and I
have to put you in the corner and I have
to lie to you and pretend no one's here
I'm not doing anything I'm so sorry but
it's okay because December 1st you will
find out who this first club is with
because this is scheduled to be numbered
one is auntie a little bit of pressure
it's so weird because I do collabs all
the time but every time it comes to the
12 clubs I feel this new type of
pressure where I'm like I've never done
a club I don't know to do I I don't know
how to interact with humans I don't what
is still is here but the most important
thing for me to survive because think
about 12 clubs in a month is a lot of
videos more videos than I do usually and
to do collaborations is that much more
effort and energy to collaborate with
someone and it's fun but that's the
thing it's got to be fun or also go
insane if you have a lot of work to do
make it fun that's how you that's how
you have persistence and endurance if
you're having fun so the goal is to get
it done well but have a great time while
doing it right you know to the person of
clapping with us here and I'm not going
to tell you who it is and they're just
there literally right there like I'm
looking at them right now and you know
who it is and I'm not gonna tell you and
they're right there haha
so this is Brendan he helped me bridge
12 collabs
because I'll have a mountain oh my god
look my jeans are all ripped I'm gonna
have a mental breakdown if he doesn't so
he's a pretty helping produce and doing
stuff and he's great
he's great look at this is the face of
greatness make a meme out of it
greatness is actually homeless friend as
well and my friend you probably seen it
you've all been involved before we go
way back we go way back way back it was
like in the delivery room way back and
we wrap we did it and I would just like
to say the person I collaborated with I
am in love with so nice so patient so
wonderful probably the easiest feel I've
ever worked with in my life so no the
person I shot my first cloud would blend
in not that everyone else won't be
splendid but splendid are you trying to
move by yourself right now Hey oh hi
back
nada yeah it's a cellphone your butt
even though we just wrapped for today
now we gotta walk you tomorrow what
we're gonna do because that's it talk
loud baby vocalize we end this we end
this to win this right now there's not
winning him anything but got the script
for tomorrow we're shooting tomorrow
during the day as well at a different
location so not as lenient as my
apartment so we got to be super super on
point and the person shooting with
tomorrow is definitely gonna have more
limited time than the person we shot
with today so we about to play Tetris
right now so nada is learning about
Indian culture and also about the fact
that I parents on arranged marriage and
she is shocked she's shocked she's
fascinated by everything well I was
talking about how like yeah like my dad
came to Kenya not like years ago and
that to sponsor my mom and like had to
work three jobs in the bowl like
immigrants story of like and she's fast
that's great you're good to learning
experience for you is great okay so this
is a great thing about my my friendship
inada because we're friends we also work
together as you know so this is an
accurate representation is not I'd call
actually both with how long I was go how
long I regret this too but more so like
humble doesn't work with me in terms of
like everyday stuff not on Kyle Dube but
they're so good at going for my
professional to friends this is an
accurate representation of the
conversation which that arena when I'm
reviewing the video and not is forcing
me to review and do stuff so she has
these knows who she's going over yep so
where do you think some stuff - is my
face and she's going over nose and I'm
like nah no listen I'm always new ask me
for stuff dog what's wrong with you dog
was wrong with you dog was wrong with
you oh sweet and caring mom she's at
zero but will you open up Sam's last
email first then once that's good news
see ya I like this seamless has no
additional comments but then there's 70
was under it look at a lie that's a lie
this one but it's not great so because
you talk to just
you know it's gonna be okay we can make
it better
see I haven't oh my god come on I have
an idea I think it's kind of cute
you know you need snow to do that right
nada
what I'm not a quickly on the top your
head what your favorite thing about me
not a not up here but humble quick quick
quick quick quick quick what's rare
thing about me oh great quick quick
quick quick my food ah when do I do that
oh you mean putting pizza in the oven
that's your favorite thing about me that
I can put a pizza oven you know what's
funny
it was I was thinking about it since you
were tell you're gonna do it uh-huh too
many favorite things I got over well uh
huh
with all my family things and I didn't
know what to do with all my favorite
Lily things yes already completely
booked
I have more favorite Lily things than I
have strands of my beard wait what was
that you like what all the weird Lily
thing well we're doing I'm never weird
all the time yes you are
what's a weirdest thing I'm ridiculously
weird I like about you
I think if somebody met you and I do
your fan the biggest surprise that
they're gonna come across and the fact
that you're ridiculously weird Pleasant
well the other thing is though we still
become extremely comfortable with humble
in my house now I just realized like
I'll be doing things like randomly sing
away that's good
like you know when you know someone that
your household you kind of filter it
that's like gone like I do the whip I'll
be like working out we like to weird
crap no wait he's downstairs and just
not even caring like today I breakfast I
burp so loud then I was like oh was that
rude and I was like excuse me I guess
well like I don't that's admirable
though not worrying about something yeah
anything a lot in public you sing like a
little your dad I think I do sing along
a little bit
yeah yeah somehow that I guess hear you
singing and then I think like people are
gonna when people come you're gonna stop
you just keep going like I already want
to realize how do you realize that and
you think for enjoyment you don't think
for presentation I appreciate that
that's correct I stop there's a polite
way of thing you suck at singing and
that's okay I think I'm a decent singer
I'm just gonna put that out there and
your man proceed you don't not have
moved to this country when she was 10 I
didn't know English and that's so
admirable you didn't know English you
know English not a word of English her
whole grade 6 career she's not shy want
anyone with Salinger and as I said no
idea what anyone was saying Dada is
really effing weird she's really well we
didn't know when we figure this out I
worry about her when she's not around I
live
okay so we have skits applied Roger this
is not just a camera this is more like
so I could even not at any point
throughout the day literally any time
she won't reply she never sleeps like
she has a problem so what we have come
up with is that nada is just like this
at all points of the day and then I'll
call it awake
