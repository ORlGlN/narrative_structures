of joy your true Oh model we work so

we should JT that's really good I love
it I didn't how to include people that's
really cute
you watch a lot of these videos yeah you
tuber yeah nice well this is gonna do
watch her blog channel her daily videos
this is her camera
are you mom
i watch your videos i pre-ordered your
book and i can't wait to see more of
your rose love it rose the uniform turn
the six upside down it's a nine now
what's going on the meet and greet was
great I met so many of you lovelies
actually got to spend a lot of time per
person it's mean great um which is
really great I learned about where you
first covered me with your favorite
video um I just saw a bunch of stuff a
lot of people brought up voices and I
mean in Greece these days a lot of
people bring up voices and they bring up
girl up which is really great because
there's two things I'm very passionate
about
especially girl love I want to talk to
you uh something real quick you know
when I say that I'm gonna go a little
mini rant I'm gonna try to make up quick
cuz I forget ready to go to rehearsal
but I was going to the voice of comments
and I'm not just saying this to BS you
know I'm real with you I think a true
success with a video like the way I
think what videos is that it has to have
a lot of positive comments and a lot of
hate comments or negative comments not
hateful comments against negative
comments for me to know it's really
successful because if your videos only
get positive feedback that means that's
just your group of people that are
continuously watching them you have to
get a certain amount of negative
comments to know that is reaching a new
audience that's just the way I look at
things and do well my six years of being
on YouTube that's what I've learned yeah
so that's how I look at things and
that's why I think voice this isn't
really successful because it's a lot of
really positive comments and there's a
lot of really
negative comment there's so many
comments like this is so cringe this is
so bad I can't take you seriously and
that's all fine thick skin ever has
their opinion there's one particular
comment whip it bothered me I openly
admit it bothered me but it bothered me
more so because of the mentality behind
in the comment was honestly should go
back to making funny videos or like it
was something that was very like I know
the vibe of the comment was basically I
own you and you should do what I say and
I was just like I want to talk about
this I know I talk about this with a lot
of my creative friends as well as
creators we are always itching to try
new stuff you know I love doing my rants
the types of videos I still love
dressing as my parents I still love
doing a lot stuff but I mean I've been
doing this for six years and so part of
me also wants to explore other things
not get rid of the rants and all stuff I
still love that but from time to time I
want to do something like voices or
something like the book promo video
because that's how I grow as a person
and as a creative and I'm so grateful
that so many of you support me even
though that's not what you originally
subscribed for you subscribe because of
the comedy stuff and so when you support
me on other endeavors that means a lot
but I want to openly tell you because
you know I'm always honest to you um I I
never want to feel like I have to do
things because I'm pressured by an
online audience if I ever want to
explore an idea I'm going to do it
because I want to be true to myself and
I love myself and um I never want to
keep doing something I hate because I
feel pressured by non lies and I'm
hopeful that team super will support me
in whatever I do and I'm still gonna do
comedy on Monday I'm releasing a comedy
video I miss being my teeth and butt and
you try to throw them in the video but
when I try new things like um just know
that it would mean the world to me if
you supported those things or if you
didn't like that's cool
you just wait the next comedy video but
I don't know something about that
comment just really irked me because I
was like just because I make videos on
the internet does not mean that you
control me and you can tell me what to
do of course I love you all and you love
me and I know but probably none of us
that well be some random person leaving
a little comment but I just want to be
open because I know a lot of my creator
friends feel pressured to do a certain
type of content who is it one second I
know my blog the hell I know a lot my
creator friends
pressure to make a certain type of
content I want to openly tell you that
I'm only gonna do what makes me happy
because I encourage you to do what makes
you happy and I would be a hypocrite and
I find and follow that myself so that's
my little rant I want to go on always
know that I'm gonna do what makes me
happy when excites me is creative and
hopefully what asides to me also excites
you and we can grow together like that
I'm gonna go to rehearsal man me oh yo
yo yo yo yo yo look what FanFest got me
it's a dope jacket and it says home is
Canada that's dope right I'm a West on
stage talking we're to the red carpet as
well really really dope thank you so
much boys to Rio for the Olympics as
well yeah also there's nothing like rock
a lie I'm really nervous to perform
voices everywhere at the meteor camp -
means that they're so excited to watch
I'm still really nervous cuz like a deep
part of me man I'm sharing with people
on stage and it's like what I'm deciding
to do is exactly what I did when I shot
the video I'm committing to just
whatever that voices that I'm performing
I'm gonna completely commit to it if I'm
vulnerable I'm gonna be vulnerable I
don't care how I look I don't care if I
look stupid I'm committing to that voice
so that's the plan I go
just casually
thousands of people beyond state man's
just finished rehearsal so I fully
understand fifth harmony was feeling cuz
a damn hot up there I know I saw some
before my hair open I take that back I'm
reading it
the fans are dull my Beyonce fans and
they blow my hair wicked but when I'm
standing did the fan interrupts with the
mic so I can actually use the fans so I
guess Beyonce's are more down more
integrating to stage either way homeless
rehearsing right now it's so damn hot
I'm dripping sweat my mic pack was
drenched it's gonna be a tough show but
we're gonna make it happen
