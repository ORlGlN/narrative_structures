good morning head to my accountants and
you know anything about me you know that
I don't like finances it only taxes I
don't like counting I don't like any of
that stuff and I know it's mandatory to
do in life but like I'm the least savvy
person when it comes to these kinds of
things but anyways I'm going thank god
team super loves everybody today
positivity happiness yay what the
accountants only in this particular
matter my people ain't got a function up
here like okay I feel like my brain is
gonna explode I cannot explain to you
how stressful it is being a Canadian but
doing all cuz work in the US and getting
paid in u.s. money but being a Canadian
citizen and all it's not fun it's not
fun it has up my finances I'm sitting
there hearing what things I have no idea
about I just it stresses the F out of me
I mmm just like the very edge of my
comfort zone like I've not only left the
comfort zone like I'm gonna some next
galaxy right now or I'm just I don't
even know the language I don't even I
don't I can't even order a pizza right
now in this galaxy I can't communicate
yesterday we're at this exact moment I
have five deadlines that I need to like
do
Sarah is waiting on something I have a
conference call after make tomorrow's
video I have to do something with my
bank right now I just came back from the
bank right now I have to judge me for my
accountants it's my lawyer like all
urgently so instead of doing anything
I'm vlogging because I'm shutting down
and I don't I don't know
and then I reddit yesterday's vlog I
said from the beginning
Sarah and jazz being on vacation I'm
gonna hold it down and I am gonna hold
it down it's gonna be held it out it's
just it's near it I need a minute
let's make a list we're making it we're
making a list here we go
okay check out this ridiculous situation
right so my mom I need these patties and
inside there's chickpeas and spinach and
I made a sandwich out of one of them for
you but in my sandwiches I put hummus
and spinach in it so now I'm eating a
sandwich with hummus and spinach with a
patty and inside the patty
there's chickpeas and spinach I'm
basically eating an apple inside an
apple
basically I'm basically eating an apple
that's hugging another apple that's I'm
basically not doing any work hold up
okay so writing this diss track right
and then of course this has been
happening so often recently I think of
an idea time ago so good idea dad I
won't be able to do about tomorrow so
now I'm debating to let my parents this
is some real talk have my channel for
one more video so I could have a few
more days to make a really good response
and I'm thinking maybe the video I'll
make is Lily getting her channel back
because it doesn't make sense how we'll
just get the channel back right now my
mom has the channel so I'm thinking
about doing a skit where she actually
gets channeled back from the next video
after that one having really replies so
she gets the channel back hope you guys
are mad at that I don't know I'm if I'm
waiting on a few things to see if my
ideas even possible but like I just had
a really creative idea of it
instrumental I wanted to use but I need
someone's permission to use it I don't
think I'll be able to get that right now
