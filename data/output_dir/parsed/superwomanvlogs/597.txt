little bit of a sore throat I think this
is amaz yelling and talking too loud I
think my voice is a strain but is
rejuvenation Sunday which means all of
this ish is about to get cleaned
Hummels already up you know I have come
to a conclusion that humble just needs
love sleep that I its 12:40 but I wonder
but I like 6:00 though so I think that's
pretty good when did you wake up
oh yes I told help to give his mom
flowers what it's my guy you know my mom
has yet to get her flowers yet oh she's
probably I work mostly though just like
on the front door they weren't even home
yeah so just leave them there anyways
it's a Mother's Day
mothers are the real super women will
get more sentimental about them but
first I need to eat some cereal and then
you know what time it is
you know time it is you know tired yes
it is rejuvenation I didn't know there's
no different air quotes it's a real
thing okay that's do it I am a sad
person right now because I've done
something that I've never done before
and I'm so pissed off about it I think I
forgot to check double check a drawer
before I left the hotel in New York and
I forgot a drawer full of things there
including almost all of my underwear
including socks including two bras
included including like two shorts and
like two tank tops a bag that I use to
travel like I do forgot a whole drawer
of things there and now I need to like
go buy underwear I think I'm so pissed
off at myself right now
I lost all my underwear there in New
York oh my god

good bra too Lily uh you talking about
rejuvenation Sunday doesn't you talk
about Sun look at this place look at
this place

buy TVs and watch Game of Thrones not
just something I should watch Game of
Thrones but I like to watch movies and
stuff and I thought it'd be cool for us
to an humble has his shows and he really
likes I have my shows that I realized
let that be a communal thing to get a TV
and waiting place a monopoly deal while
we eat that was literally my next
question my next question was uh I mean

would have won trophies we should we
should have trophy oh my god ooh you

of right now

have a wonderful so that what Toby is
made it will be the winter because
anything before insisting doesn't count
they're not play I technically learned
how to play it okay I have the trophy is
what I'm trying to get across here or
not okay when I was doin out in spring
so we're playing until June 20th to 0-0
if you look at the reigning champ right
now this is a contender if you colle win
it's gonna be a cold summer for this
girl mm-hmm this calls for a montage
for one for me then let me tell you what
happened - what happened - it was so
real
once in a lifetime basically we mutually
decided that six we're over Best Buy
okay so establishment six was okay this
will humble done we decided something to
agree and then when I blog he starts
making it seem like we did it we agreed
at six and then it was 555 and it was
three oh sorry it's four - five four -
it was three - so it was buying my slept
and he had a chance to tie it up okay
I'm like yo just to know if we start
playing at sixes got stops you have five
minutes to begin you know that sort you
gonna argue whatever we played he's a
fine with reaching five minutes I mean I
won won that one in five minutes - and
merchants I don't I don't blog obviously
they don't blog I cut humble off because
he was annoying me go ahead say what you
say I'm gonna start a daily vlog channel
youtube.com/ he listened to youtube.com
slash Lilly cheese and monopoly deal or
youtube.com slash okay can I ask you a
series of yes-or-no questions I like to
ask you Susan - no questions did I did I
not beat you in this sitting but you did
I did yes okay but not my issue okay the
issue is then there is no issue I wonder
the AdMob will F up oh you're so
annoying
now there's no issue if things have been
ironed out there's no issue now but now
on every time is weird is sitting there
zoom in or five games as it was an only
no time limit
well it's been every situation or
whatever waiting for flight we're
waiting forever like that's fine you
take your sweet time okay who takes
longer well paying here you and the last
game to go through the water be honest
probably the same amount I'm all see
this is why I swear okay I'm sorry guys
he's not even the blogs anymore because
I'm kicking about any we're not friends
anymore
we're not friends I'm trying to mess
with you how can be friends with you
let's go buy a TV
so first not binding to crazy medium
small size because when actually like
buy a place later then I can buy like a
bigger TV and there's no place to put a
big TV we did all the science this
there's no place about having TV
because officers based my office so
that's what we're gonna do and we're in
my hdmi cable and we will hook it up
maybe I'll show you an episode of
Quantico
hey Quantico said you want to watch
Quantico remember I did yeah Wow after
discussion humble doesn't member I
remember was it like maybe you can join
me I'm still walking dead even though
I've seen it episode I was impressed
with definitely would I want to have
some of my sister once and even she was
like this is a bad episode so my BAE
just thought that it was beginning the
began my seasons six oh what one and if
you'd like he wasn't final episode of
one season what what one episode oh oh
alright after much deliberation we
decided on TV for pre-ordering a stand
and we are picking the wire and you can
never take the indian out of us because
the first thing grabs was like sorry
hooking up is yra even just count or
 everyone when you make a major
purchase always got a try to squeeze and
poke them to get something for free it's
not even about the money is what the
principle so we came here to make a
major purchase we need something for
free even if it's like a coaster you
want a coaster we have so many cultures
at home we do but the never where you
need them
um well you know those been close by
there's a coaster there he just leaves a
trail of coasters I walk around with
closer than I why is that very what's
that Nursery Rhyme Hansel and Gretel
that's home both with coasters oh the
bread brother but I appreciate that uses
a coaster so that's good okay look at
the TV like in the future I want to buy
it in the future now I know right now
I'm buying it good pretty standard one
but like in the future like these huge
curved ones does that curve you can see
Suzy has one I think Yusuf might have
one too
let me show the one we're getting we're
getting this one to Samsung its charity
is not 4k because Samson is more vivid
and bright and I prefer that over like
the minor details believe me Kristin
we're gonna look good in 4k no we lose
today you can even I couldn't even tell
the difference I prefer vibrant colors I
like I like 360p 720 maybe on a good day
he basically wants to get a an iPod
Touch first edition and what he were
throwing on that everyone's in math yeah
does it mean like some TVs like they're
so high def where they confuse my eyes
because it look better than real life
and it kind of throws me and I can't pay
attention story then because I'm just
like whoa holy fat that looks so like I
feel high-def should only be for when
you're looking at real stuff
documentaries sports I don't want to
watch big story you can hide this look
at this look at this look at these
peppers peppers look better goddamn that
should be on a runway right now goddamn
