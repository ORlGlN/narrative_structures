onesie and morning I didn't vlog
yesterday night's like I don't know how
to vlog I want to take a break off vlog
and I feel like I don't know how to vlog
anymore but it is 335 p.m. I woke up I
had a conference call then it is a few
emails then I had another conference
calls I've been productive so far I
don't mean breakfast yet
I'm starving so I'm gonna take a shower
have some breakfast
can check Harry all my day so much work
to do I'm actually doing a CBC New
Year's special thing and the dates got
all conflicted so I have to do tomorrow
I'm actually going to see be seen for
all you like wha - Marseille BC it's
really big Canadian television network
so I'm going there tomorrow so I need to
prep a whole bunch of stuff with that
I'm shooting a sketch with my parents
with them and I I am
the best version of my parents and I'm
alone or when I'm with work because I'm
very comfortable Rick but when I do my
parents sketch in front of other people
it's like a little bit tough but
nonetheless we're doing that and I've
got a few emails and then work and then
today clap whenever two comes out and it
is what do Seth Rogen and James Franco
now know if you remember a while back I
told you I deleted this blog footage and
we couldn't resolve that it was from the
day I shot with Seth and James that I
every night clear my memory cards with
vlog camera didn't realize I upload the
vlog because it's a secret and I deleted
all footage from the vlog with them but
it's okay that's not the main video and
it's on my main channel link is in
description clap number two my goal with
these towel collapses like of course I
want to do with youtubers but I also
would like step outside the box and do
people that like clad with people that
you won't expect they're like oh my god
like she clad with them that that's the
goal
cuz like of course I can have other
youtubers in it I want to and I'm going
to and I love to but I really want to
like put a surprise factor it only kind
of like set the standard high but you
know brick brick not that these people
are better than youtubers just like you
wouldn't think of them so hope you enjoy
it was lots of fun since the decoders
got deleted let me just tell you let I
know this is a really long take I'm
sorry but let me just tell you about my
experience of course they came in and of
course Seth is high auto smartness that
he's going use such a
sweetheart and a bit of a harder time
connecting with James but they were
still both great and did legitimately
kiss seth rogen yes I did kiss him was
first time I've ever kissed someone for
a video and I feel like it
instantaneously got high after because
he was so high and I tasted all the
Highness and it was like it was it was

thoughts every day about what I'm
feeling that day and if something
inspired it and I called mini brain
explosions and so I just wrote my third
