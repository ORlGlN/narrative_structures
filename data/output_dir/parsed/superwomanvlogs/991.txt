my body is broken well aware I look like
a mess the time is four I just got out
of bed I kept waking up because my body
was hurting so much well it's the next
day the strangest thing I think last
night with the shoes I pushed myself to
such exhaustion like this morning I woke
up and I felt hungover I didn't even
have a sip of alcohol but my body felt
hugging / like I felt like nauseous and
like a king and then oh my god it was
and I don't get hungover even when I
drink like I just blessed to be one of
those people but I feel broken but that
wouldn't stop complaining about that
because it was so worth it
there's a massive blizzard outside and
the roads are horrible but I need to
leave soon to go to the rapper's game
I'm having dinner with TIA
and jazz first and the Raptors game live
and in-person hey that's really cool and

stomach was like what do you think you

that it's like I feel like I'm a hundred
years old I'm sorry I'm gonna complain
for a while cuz I'm really in pain but
I'll shut up Charlie okay just so we
comprehend the situation like it looked
like our tornado went through my house
like I'm gonna have to clean all this
before I leave because my parents come
home to this David will have heart

a very big chance okay it's probably
gonna happen I burped I know I do my ask
Superman live on the 14th but I'm going
to Cancun on the 14th and I was thinking
I'll just do it there but then I
realized because my mom's on vacation as
well and her Wi-Fi doesn't work properly
and there's a chance if I go to the
resort that their Wi-Fi might be too
slow to do a live stream so would it be
horrible if I did it on the 13th I think
I wanted to do on the 13th which means
that time you see this tomorrow I'm
gonna do ask to probe in live on the
13th spread the word all right um-hmm if
