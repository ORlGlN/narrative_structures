my sleeve is covered in drool
good morning I just roll all over my arm
and I'm still waiting the shirt you know
why because I'm okay I'm okay with that
I accept my Jewish sleeve good morning
it afternoon good evening wherever you
are it's a beautiful day the sun is
shining the wet is it the weather is
sweet what's sweet the weather's I think
it's the weather I'm not sure I will
fact check today the goals are for
ignited Abed established goals for
myself which is really no kage say
something real quick
in Kenya one of the things and I'm sure
this will happen time and time again
we're like I remember something to tell
you but in Kenya one of the things that
was most different was that I didn't
have Wi-Fi in my cabin I had to go to
like a very specific place where they
have a limited Wi-Fi each day so when I
woke up it was such a strange feeling to
wake up and not go through my phone for
like 30 40 minutes cuz here's like I
wake up I'm lying in bed I go through my
emails my Twitter my Instagram and Kenya
it was like my alarm went off and then
get this I got out of bed it was the
strangest thing it was also kind of nice
though because then you wake up without
that noise from social media in the
world but today I did lie in bed but I
was just thinking about that what I was
lying there like oh it's so interesting
how things let such a small thing can
make such a huge difference anyways
today the goals are right for chapters
establish a video idea for tomorrow
which is super Monday because it's my
first comedy video back after my hiatus
and I want to be amazing and wonderful
I'm also gonna put my clothes away into
the closet what I said I was going to be
yesterday everybody Larry jr. away on my
new jewelry holder and it's also a
jubilation Sunday which means I already
do my laundry yesterday okay I'll put my
face Mac's mask on today I'll sweep a
Windex take out the garbage will do
those things well do all the things it's
gonna be a good day right Julie sleeve

you I don't know to ask you feel okay
with fear the need to tell my sense uh I
guess that there is happier than us
these days I doubt it
I'm real happy so what I'm doing now is
I'm rereading the chapters that I wrote
yesterday add anything to them tweaking
them then I print them out my beautiful
blue stapler that makes me very happy I
actually mentioned the blue staple in
this chocolate chat in this chapter in
this chapter in this chapter and then I
add to the pile that doesn't mean it's
all wood means I think is good enough to
print out and to review later on and
then I read these papers at the end of
the day as well so boom there's one that
I'm going to read the other two I wrote
and we do anything also I can like feel
that I'm waiting at my period today I

definitely find some excuse to go for a
drive I wasn't off from give your cars a
shower so I'll be so dusty but like oh
my god so I've been waiting I don't
remember if I showed this to you now I
don't think I have but I've been hiding
this to you forever
unless I showed it to you I'm getting in
which case pretend like I didn't so when
I actually signed my book publishing
deals my publishers sent me a lot of
these cookies that basically took the
little books
cool cookies and I'm not open them yet
just not gonna save them until like I'm
done writing my manuscript which will be
very very soon but yeah also another
thing they study which a lot of you have
noticed and I guess you thought it was
because of my lipstick but my publishers
actually send it to me is this job
Nutella a lot of you were like all of
course Lily would have a jar of Nutella
steak or it says about for when I signed
the book deal all these secrets I can
tell you also yeah you lose all these
little things in my apartment that I had
to like hide from you there was hints
here all along here so sneaky
oh my god the struggle is real I'm just
calling to Instagram it on Twitter and
everyone literally everyone and their
mother is that the VMAs and one of the
hardest choice I had to me one of the
hardest choice but you know how much I
love attending award shows and when they
asked me to come to the VMAs I was like
I can't because I just got back from
Kenya what required me to come back home
for one day and fly to New York is
another six hour flight I was like I
need to work on my book I cannot do
another travel I just can't and it was
so painful for me to say I couldn't
attend and now everyone is there and I
have mad Fobo right now everyone is
there but it's fine it's fine it's for
the book it's for the book Lilly it's
for the book this is a good problem this
is a good problem and you know what it's
gonna be fine
humbles there Kingsley's their grace is
their main where's there when he's there
Beyonce is there literally everyone is
there but it's fine book priority and I
will thank myself for this decision once
I finish my book so that's what's up
okay I'm about to do something you've
been asking her to do for so long I'm
finally doing it I'm putting back my
Twitter bio I've been thinking what if
we're still along and I don't want to
overthink it put them so much pressure
on myself so this is what I got I like
it it's 50% hustler
I already messed it up that's not what
it is it is 50% entertainer 30% hustler
20% unicorn 10% bad at math I like it
I'm good oh my god I like it I like it I
like it had to meditate myself autosum
FOMO just now because I was like trying
to do something I'm like oh I kept
thinking like I want to be there want to
be theirs I just let my positivity
candle sat on the floor talked to myself
and I reminded myself and I really do
believe positive thinking and positive
when you will win every single time
let's talk to yourself be friends with
yourself you're feeling something
address it be unapologetic with yourself
you know you when you feel some type of
way embrace that I know I guess I'm
getting deeper some writing chapters
about this stuff but of all like just no
matter how you feel it's okay do you can
deal with it use a power of positivity
anyways I'm gonna stop being mad deep
and sentimental into 725 I am like good
on Twitter and just following the VMAs
through Twitter right now but I'm gonna
actually get to work and then I'm gonna
go to Ralph's in a little bit to buy
some cereal because I ran to see her
this morning and most because I want to
make an excuse to drive my car alright
he finished my third chapter for the day
I saw something so scary on Twitter
someone basically tweeted me and
something that said that there was a
shooting at LAX which is the airport
that I fly out of all the time in LA but
I did some more research and apparently
there was no active shooter like it was
a miscommunication or something but
there's video people like running I
guess someone falsely like screamed
shooter but there wasn't a shooter as of
right now and I just had severe like
panic and fear overtake me and then it
got me thinking of like all the
situations where people actually face
that threat and like it's real and I'll
just like who just place yourself in
other people's shoes sometimes you know
and realize how lucky and grateful you
are but um my bras off my salad is half
done my chapters are being written that
is my status update and
um that's what's going on it's 9:48 p.m.
