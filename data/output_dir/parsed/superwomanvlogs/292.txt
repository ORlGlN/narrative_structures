there's AV mess-ups it the way I see is
there's AV mess-ups I feel like a
disrespectful full audience like I know
you guys came to the show and there
should be no mishaps like that and so I
want to apologize everyone I came to the
Orlando show why Michael as much
everyone I came to Orlando show I'm
sorry there was ten basically happening
at one point the intro video stopped
working the countdown and work we're at
a high school and there AV system could
not handle what we had and I was so
frustrated but I went on stage and still
like effort who cares we do it I hope
you still enjoyed the show my personal
apology to everyone because even if you
don't care I know you guys probably
can't be like who cares we're just a bit
of I care because I am very very
specific and I have a high standard when
it comes to my shows there's AV mess ups
that is not OK with me so I've already
had a team Huddle's who discussed how we
will prevent this from happening again
exploit shelves to everyone and I hope

whole team was like sorry like I'm like
no it's not your fault because it's
everyone's fault that's my policy it's
no one's fault because it's everyone's
fault because everyone should have been
more proactive I should have been more
proactive I should have sent emails upon
emails letting me know exactly what we
needed not make any assumptions that's
someone do moving forward it is everyone
should be accountable for every single
show that's out teamwork makes the dream
