going with the flow I also thought about
this
no one believes I'm not normally so
everyone's like no sorry I'm still I'm
still really happy about winning the
street me um more so I think what most
happy was the fact that I so didn't
expect it I was think about today and
one way you know I didn't expect is my
blog camera was all on the table I knew
they were calling the order and I was
like I didn't even vlog it like I even
vlog the moment cuz I was like this and
I'm like I would that's how I was like
what happened I was like I'm gonna vlog
this I could open it was minor thing I
just remembered sorry I'm a nerd also
something I feel really cool about maybe
even more so and winning MTV just posted
an article and source called that makes
me feel pretty freaking cool
so thanks for thinking my speech was
good that's really cool
okay I just took an unplanned three-hour
nap and woke up like and go grocery
shopping and do anything that's okay
what's the day Tori

massage at nine so I'm gonna upload a
vlog um get working or just get to work
it's cool whatever oh yeah you're what's
up so my vlog is in uploading and my
internet is like randomly really slow
right now it's taking so long to upload
the time is 912
so the vols pretty late I am still going
trying to make a video after I can think
of an idea and I'm so excited just do a
bunch of work tonight still seeing a
little bad about that nap but I
shouldn't have no deadlines today it's
fine
my massage masseuse is is on her way and
I'm excited about that
Sara gifted me a massage as a
congratulations Four Weddings oh yeah I
also still didn't go grocery shopping so
what I'm going to eat beyond me but the
good
ballets that are very popular grocery
store called Ralph's that's 24 hours
that's not too common in Toronto so it's
pretty dope that massage is magical and
now all I want to do is work really
really hard and that's what I'm gonna do
right now also have cake and our old
slice of pizza

post mates I've never heard of it
but they basically deliver anything to
you so it's like what time is it
midnight 12:30 and I got fast food
delivered to me they deliver like stuff
from 7-eleven and everyone I'm like this

Toronto I'm pretty sure so like dope as
have really ha I never forgot you
shopping basically is the moral story yo
