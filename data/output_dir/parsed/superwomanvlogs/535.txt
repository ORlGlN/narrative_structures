the time is 2:23 p.m.
no no I'll click I have a beard and a
comb-over right yeah okay I got out of
bed by the way that first shot really
hurt my shoulder I got out of bed I went
through all my emails and I just have I
just I've been feeling so overwhelmed I
don't know I just have so much stuff to
do today I have to record all five of
the songs which I'm nervous about I'm
not like that great at it and I'm
self-conscious but like if after a
record in front of people music I'm
really self-conscious and so like I'm
just shutting down and so that has to
happen I'm releasing the book Pro much
today which I'm really nervous about cuz
I only gave one round of notes and I
don't know what the final product looks
like and I'm just like I want it to be
everything and more and so I'm like oh
patiently waiting for that to be sent to
me
cheaper sent to me like 30 minutes and
then tomorrow I have a three hour shoot
in the morning for a magazine and then I
have bad mom's premiere which is really
final these are all great things but
then today I get a message about a a
really cool big audition that I really
want to do tomorrow in between those two
things let me let me just can we just
can we just take a moment take take 60
seconds to listen to me right those of
you that don't know and I'm not
complaining because I know other people
out there work away harder than me when
it comes to a lot of things but when you
do auditions in Hollywood they give you
almost no notice they don't give you any
time it's like hey yeah can you come in
tomorrow morning for a audition here's
15 pages memorize like that's the vibe
really and I'm just like I have no time
to prepare for this I'm just like let me
self tape I don't want to go over but I
really wanted to that Edition but I
don't have time to do it and I'm just
I'm feeling overwhelmed so my solution
was to come sit on Keim's and lie in my
bed I'll talk with myself and then we're
gonna get up and that's what's gonna
happen but for now we lie we lie in the
bed came up nine minutes left in the
book promo video will be my inbox in

partnership Oh God okay okay this I am a
rare and precious find and my brilliant
brilliance will be reflected back to me
when I am paired with a true match my
ideal partnerships and working
relationships are easy and free-flowing
I deserve greatness because I am
greatness and to paraphrase Rumi is a
rummy rooby-roo me what I'm looking for
is also looking for me in fact he or she
might be paraphrasing boo me right now
hmm I don't mind this because it's not
just about relationships as working
relationship free-flowing

I like that a lot that's pretty dope see
first I was like kind of like you are a
drop in the ocean and emotion in the
truck actually Jonathan a new library
speaking of bars I usually show my rap
songs to humble before I record them and
I'm always nervous every single time
because almost obviously really done get
away he does oh those are really good
really really good tone set tone said
not gonna be like ah did she get help

to watch it freaking ass out everyone to
be good
Mijares racing like I care both us so
much okay I watched it I watched it I
watched it for sweating so much I
watched it I liked it I hope it's I
think it's good I think that I think
that's good I felt some type of way I
don't know I I don't know I think it's
good okay shut up
humble watching it I know you think I'm
being super dramatic but you're honest
how much has video on this book means to
me and the message in the video and I
just want I want to make you feel some
type of way and so I'm just listed here
quietly that's helpful watching the
video 527 and this has consumed my whole
day but it's fine I would just about to
upload and I realized I voiceover isn't
missing
so I'm urgently emailing the editor be
like hey I think one of the layers is on
mute like I mean I uploaded I was ready
to go right now but I'm gonna see what
he says make decision so the video is
gonna come out 10 minutes from now
an hour and a half ago because I
couldn't get a hold of the producer I
got a hold of the producer he's sending
this version right now so if you're mad
at me on Twitter know what I'm going
through right now none of my control
he's sending it up hurry up a building
but I think that little small voice over
will make a difference so that's where
I'm at 6:30 p.m. got five songs to
record that's where I'm at right now
okay put me in your GPS is gonna show
you that this is where I'm at cause I'm
we're in this yet selling

musicians right here listening to me and

wild machine that's quite out here oh
hey Lily just recorded four songs Lily
has one more to do but we can do it Lily
has a shoot all day tomorrow doesn't
know what to do hold up we've all
reached the point where we're not really
sure if anything sounds good anymore so
it's sleepytime sexy
make you less money so but I am seeing a
lot of things in these songs and you'll
know why when I talk about the premise
of the video everyone but I'm saying a
lot of things these songs I've never
said before because I'm getting real
deep and Rob my emotions these days I
feel like this making me happy
I'm saying things that I don't want to
be filter anymore like I want to be real
and stuff you know II mean so that's
something and I'd like just like I it's
not with filter where I'm still like
start talking crap little everything
it's not that she's about being honest
with your emotions and arms about things
then I'm saying a lot of things these
days I haven't said before so it's
really exciting
those are happy boys should sleep soon
but that's dance first you mean see no
motion bro
oh my it is late I am tired
I'm acting kind of weird what happens
past certain time this is a 352 I have
to wake up at 9:15 so I'm gonna go to
bed I was just telling humble inelia
that I'm kinda stressed about tomorrow
cuz the things have to do tomorrow are
it's one of those situations where
legitimately I don't know there's enough
time to accomplish everything he's
accomplished so I need to have a shoot
tomorrow morning from 10:00 to 3:00 then
on the way back home I have a call then
from 4:00 to 6:00
hair makeup and outfitting because the
premiere for bad moms is tomorrow I have
to self take an audition at some point
tomorrow I still have to write and
record one more song I have to pack for
Montreal because the next day which is
the shoot list music stuff I'm straight
from the shoot to the airport's up a
path from Montreal tomorrow night but
then when I land back from Montreal I'm
only here for an hour before I believes
the airport again and for that trip I
need to be packed for Toronto Italy
Brazil and Kenya so I also have to pack
for those things before I leave so I
don't know when these things are gonna
happen but that's the moral of my story
hmm anyways if you like it subscribe if
you like it subscribe know just finished
shooting on the girl upset okay I must
say that I have made a new friend and
she's fantastic and she has an amazing
voice and she's wonderful all around

look at her embracing me also Kazushi
