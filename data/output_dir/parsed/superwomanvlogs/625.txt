I'm a farmer good morning um are you
thinking about me yeah I woke up with a
huge migraine I got a migraine all night
long so I didn't sleep too great and I'm
like oh my god my voice is kind of
strained and oh my god I really need
sleep
but I'm not gonna complain about I'm to
persevere through the day I have a shoot
right now for something and then I do
have a bit of a break in the day and
then I have a meeting with my stylist or
our new stylist tonight's the MTV Movie
Awards tomorrow I'm trying to like kind
of lay my mind with the next I'll be
able to sleep in and sleep and I've
calculated it to Tuesday and today is
Friday so that's the mission that's the
mission statement right there I'm gonna
head down and grab some vitamin C head
down and do the damn thing this is the
vibes today and we're gonna hustle hard
let go
so remember yesterday I was like oh yeah
I'm gonna wash my hair just like I wash
my hair so now it's just like so much
hairspray so much teasing and I'm just
like that girl my identifier is that
girl that has the rottenest hair and
like after that's everything's like like
my look this is my look this is like my
thing like I wanted it to look like this
that's that's why it looks like this
that's this one we tell people I'm in my
trailer I'm shooting a project with some
my mom is a side of me BRB I'm back yeah
some I'm not gonna tell you the details
of the shoot because it's not my shoot
it's not my place to do that but it's
with some cool people and it's a cool
thing and I am excited to help them out
with this and this is happening and so
he's in my trailer just had Chipotle and
we just chilling chilling that felt I
took a good nap and it wasn't a good nap
it was like a 20-minute nap me but like
oh you're blessed life blessed life that
not blessed and that's going on and it's
gloomy and cold and rainy outside and
like I didn't move here for this so
finished shooting and now we're at into
my style appointment it's kind of bad I
had to like rush off set even though I
feel like they want to shoot some more
stuff cuz I had like
definite time had to leave because I had
to go somewhere else I feel really bad
doing that kind of stuff because as a
creative I know how it feels to do
shoots and I know how it feels to not
but to feel like you didn't get what you
wanted so I hope they feel like this
they said they were happy with the
bright I got the feeling that they
wanted to do one more and I couldn't I
feel really bad about it but I had no
choice I have to go I really watched
Marisa so much hairspray in it and
there's so much makeup on my face um but
we're going to pick her no fitfully and
TV movie awards which are happening
tomorrow but airing on Sunday and you
know I got look on fleek for all the
bays that are gonna be there so you guys
was it alright I'm finally home I didn't
block any of the styling goes like we
were just trying to figure it out
final outfit is actually the most
comfortable outfit I'm ever gonna wear
the red carpet it's pretty dope it's
like this blue satin top and blue stat
and pastels like really loose and fun
and I think it was really swag and
sophisticated so like I really like it
um I'm really tired and today I had a
little bit of a cranky moment because
doesn't miss happen my schedule that
like made me waste like 30 minutes
waiting around and usually I don't wait
mind waiting around like you know I
tried to be very grounded and try not to
be a jerk but I was just so tired and I
was like I really don't want to give my
time to be waste to track that but I
shut the F up but I just did it at
school but now I'm gonna do something to
eat I gotta wash my hair and I'm gonna
try again early night I realized that
what I said before was incorrect I
actually can sleep in tomorrow morning
so I'm excited about that I'm thinking
about just eating I'm gonna wash my hair
I'll pour myself a drink I'm gonna
Netflix and chill by myself right now
and I'm so excited my place is also a
huge mess so I should probably clean it
up but that's going on first things
first let's get some food up in my tummy
okay I washed my hair and I'm honestly
so proud I feel like I accomplished so
much because I'm so tired and I was a
task and a half and you know I hate
washed mayor also I'd like to point out
I think I've mentioned this before since
I've moved to LA I probably forget my
towel when I take a shower like seventy
percent of the time like I forget it
more often than not I don't know what it
is I just can't remember to put my towel
near the shower I'm basically stupid I'm
a stupid person like evolution is gonna
win me out
I don't know how I managed to clean the
house and I clean my washroom picked up
all my clothes fix the kitchen a little
bit I'm like okay I'm sorry I keep
saying I'm tired because I'm really
tired I just put a load of laundry in as
well I might as well go to sleep and
sleep the F in and enjoy this because
bringing we've been hustling the last
two days and we just need to take a
second to be like yo let's catch some
sense right now Rosie's as the Americans
say I don't go to bed thank you for
joining me on this crazy day tomorrow
are the MTV Movie Awards I'm mixing up
at 1:30 to get my hair and makeup done
and now I'll wake up at like 12:00 we
get my hair and makeup done at 1:30 and
then it is the show and I will of course
blog all of it
I'll try to snapchatted the reason I'll
snap chat isn't right
just hit puberty the reason I don't
snapchat is much by the ways I Felix
snapchat kills your phone batteries not
just me my battery dies away quicker
when I snapchat also in environments
like the MTV Movie Awards the reception
rarely ever works cuz it's too many
people that's why I can never like post
things right away but that's going on so
seem exciting and I can't wait to take
you on that journey with me it's exactly
one year since we met doing for the
first time that's the sign to see if you
