there but I'm so excited
hmm time for some pizza Peter the
situation right now kind of liking on
that cheese but got my Jew drug on my
pizza I always have to eat before a
flight because they usually always F up
the vegetarian option on a flight so I
have to make sure I'm not starving
because I've had some 14 hour flight so
I haven't eaten and I was just like God
not the plane like a skeleton and I'm
like so I always have eat something and
then I always buy popcorn for my flights
to some fun facts
I had boarding the plane I like haven't
even completely thought about how I'm in
a plane for six hours now and some
things some ways tell you my brains
always on autopilot cuz I'm so busy that
I never actually stopped and take
moments in and that's something I need
to work on because I'm avoiding Scotland
for the EMAs that's nothing awesome I
need to sit down and enjoy this and I
think about this more emotional talks
when I'm not in front of so many people
no one's sitting in the middle window
seat
the sky looks so pretty anyways another
thing I feel like I never stopped and
taken the moment I'm always just like go
go go and I need to stop doing that
because I need to enjoy the things I've
already accomplished while I'm trying to
accomplish other things so enjoy this
play sick that listen to my music eat
some popcorn like take action and reply
to all the text messages I've ignored
over the past week before I do that what
up video reference tik-tok texture and
then I'll talk to you when I land in
Dublin or I'll probably blog about the
