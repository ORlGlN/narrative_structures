the dress with the bathing Super's look
I've tried it on it was blue and white
when I was paying for it it was blue and
white somehow in the bag it turned into
black when I was like am i tripping out
it was the lighting in the change room
like I don't understand I thought it was
born with his whole time and I'm just
like tripping the F out because it's
black and white I basically found the
bathing suit version of dress basically
visibly alright my last prepared meal

my god like totally I need to wash
yourself 12 a.m. just released the video
I tried to take the beard off but I
always have to like take a shower for to
probably come off mostly because it
sticks to all my real hair that I have
here um I'm through taking a shower and
I should probably pack that's probably a
thing I'm leaving for the airport
tomorrow 10:00 a.m. so in 10 hours I'm
gonna pack take a shower pack depending
on feeling go to the gym and then take a
shower again after the gym is kind of
weird but I want to take a shower before
I pack because packing and require me to
try on things I don't want remnants of
my beard to get out any of the clothes I
bought so that's what's gonna have it
right now
um I have a hand butter Lucky Charms I'm
gonna take a shower
you gonna pack no that wasn't enough oh
all right so it's 2:00 a.m. I'm pretty
much finished packing um I took a shower
and I hope my suitcase is not overweight
because that would be extremely sad for
seven days to be fair it's my camera
that's so damn heavy that always makes
everything overweight I've done packing
it's 2:00 a.m. my brain is like f it I'm
going to sleep but somehow my body is
put on gym clothes so we're gonna see
who wins the battle right now stay tuned
how am I doing this I'm asleep I'm
sleeping I'm sleeping I can't do it I
can't do it my brain is saying no my
body's like shut the f up you're doing
it somethings better than nothing
somethings better than nothing I did it
maybe not the best I've ever done oh but
I did it the goal is to train my brain
to have the same lines that I have with
my work like if I can pull all-nighters
and edit videos until 6:00 in the
morning I should have to train my brain
to do this as well so it's all about
just getting here committing to it
that's what's up
I didn't think this through because now
my arms are broken and I have to wash
the dishes and take out the garbage and
the recycling and everything isn't
leaving this is just this is just just
mmm protein bar I'm a head to bed just
almost 4 a.m. I'm actually gonna edit
this vlog because God knows tomorrow's
not as an edit this vlog set to upload
released in the morning then we're
playing to Mexico I'm very part of
myself I tufted of it I had a very very
productive day today we had a meeting
early the morning that seems like a
totally different day meeting early in
the morning I made ask Superman live

wondering why the cardio so hard so I
was on my feet all day spent a known
amount of money but got everything we
needed had a very successful shopping

check a lot of emails hopefully my
flight has Wi-Fi that would be really
dope made a video edited a video

grabber to the recycling I'm just mostly
reciting this for myself to be proud and
now I'm gonna edit this vlog so I'm
gonna go we are heading to Mexico
tomorrow for a work slash vacation trip
it's not seven days of vacation I keep
what I want to stress that but um make
sure you follow along cuz I'm we're

so much but I'll try my best to snapchat
and also like fix snapchat like kills
batteries on cellphones but most
importantly I will be vlogging the
entire thing so I'm very excited for us
