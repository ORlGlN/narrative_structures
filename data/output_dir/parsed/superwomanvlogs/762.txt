I didn't have a costume so I decided to
just look like myself for Halloween
happy Halloween it is so late in the day
this 5:00 p.m. I woke up so late like
2:30 I haven't had a productive day at
all I'm kind of in this like funk where
I'm like telling myself that's so hard
to work here there's no sunshine I'll
lay I'm like and it's like have to have
not try to know today's I'm in this like
zone of like I'm unable to be productive
and I think I've told myself I can give
myself the weekend lets farmers like
this concert the constant tiredness I
feel like still my sleeping schedule so
waking about 2:30 obvious you can be
tired for the rest today so I hope that
goes away by Monday it's Saturday today
umm it's Halloween and I for the first
time I'm not doing anything exciting I
love Halloween I chase number going out
I don't really feel like going out out
like I don't really have a cost you
might have this onesie um I drew I just
kind of feel like chilling with some
friends like going to a horror movie but
like all my friends are busy so I'm kind
of like a loner that has no friends
right now and I'm trying to find up
anyone's free to go watch a movie but
first I'm going to go ahead to Tina's
house my sister's house because my
nephew's gonna dress up as police
officers and I'm gonna spend the
Halloween evening with them and
hopefully at night we can figure out
something and watch horror movies cuz
that's what I really want to do and yeah
also we had 7 million subscribers I
mentioned yesterday's vlog but still I
want to repeat it today so high five
alright let me go take some selfies
so I'm heading to my sister's house Nana
see here's a unicorn driving a car
nothing to see here
I also want to share something with you
that's kind of exciting and I haven't I
think I've only told like one person so
far I mentioned to chase because I was
on the phone with him but so I've booked
new place in LA starting December 1st
and as I mentioned before I'm going to
rent a place first before I buy a place
too because I need to feel out the area
I stay in so the place I'm renting first
for like three or four months it's not
ideal like it's cool but it doesn't have
everything I need is never walking
closet with your both though I need
doesn't have it's not perfect but I
understand for a place that I'm renting
I'm gonna be like suck it up a little
bit and then the place I buy I can make
that kind of perfect but I gave the
green light for December 1st that's
officially day that I would be checking
into my new place or my temporary place
in LA and I'm gonna have to tell all my
friends and family now about that so
that's gonna be fun um and it's like
slowly becoming real
and let's go see some candy oh yeah yeah
yeah look at this police officer hey you
don't arrest me I guess not yeah yeah
yeah yeah you can see hi or run away
whatever that's cool too so my brother
lodge gave me a great idea
because I'm in Brampton everyone thinks
I'm from this area but I'm not but it's
like a very there's like a lot of young
kids where they live and stuff so he's a
you should go trick-or-treating and like
show what they're doing people would
probably say you know like that's great
idea so now to Big Joe trick-or-treating
oh oh you have your wallet so my sister
told me that this kid is a big fat
Emmanuel's tells her that so we're gonna
go to his house try to surprise well
I'll turn my back and if you see a tin
then you can let me know kitchen Luke
