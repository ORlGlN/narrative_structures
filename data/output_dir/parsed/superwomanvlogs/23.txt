here's the thing even if I audition let
me just spill some tea for you here look
at me I'm all done I'm done little Eve
show and look at me oh you must be going
to an audition
damn right there's a mission for today
did it go to my audition release my
video do super 60 pick up the keys for
my new office go through my inbox can't
miss my audition tomorrow
all these auditions that's where the
anxiety is real but I just go on them
and try my best
I've memorized it I know the stuff I
personally think the sides are a little
hard they're a little difficult so I'm
trying to go in there and learn and do
my best some positive self-talk who the
thing stepping out of my comfort zone so
even if I do horribly I can come home
and say yo step out of your comfort zone
good on you okay got a little Canadian
tuxedo situation going on black on black
Oh
let's go grow let's do it okay fish not
gonna lie that was a hell accessable
there's a thing even a front dition let
me just spill some to you for you
sometimes it's a scene that has three
people but there's only two people in
the room it's me and a casting director
now this casting directors gonna pretend
to be two people that they're one person
so when you're talking to two different
people that like it would be mad at one
but happy the other you looking at the
same person they're not gonna change
their tone they're just reading the
lines look it's really like mentally
confusing because it's like such a weird
scenario it's like I'm acting out a
scene with three people I get the acting
part of it but it's also like I can't
even look in different directions to
change my tone you're gonna be monitored
it just does a lot of hurdles in
auditioning I always believe I mean I
might be a little biased I always
believe the auditions aren't the best
like I think that archaic they're not
the best way to see if someone's good at
something they're nerve-racking they're
uncomfortable you're not really set up
for people's success but I did it I
tried my best I stepped on my comfort
zone and I did learn something so I
guess was a great experience
so let's take snacks in the car are you
excited yeah you ready to the office me
okay it's small don't expect too much
again is it bigger than this yes now my
first question how's the office space
you like it excited second question
really one for me is what you're saying
you should keep that shirt off because
you're not playing like a boss hang on
let's draw attention something happened
last night three one goodbye so the
addition I'm supposed to have tomorrow
got moved so I have a bit of a free
night which is kind of cool and tomorrow
my name's Pete worked on the office I've
been showing you the office yet I will
though
don't worry but I did just watch Drake's
God's plan music video and I swear to
god I'm not teary-eyed I don't know for
a while but I had this thing we're like
I don't want to watch things right when
they come home I want to like die for a
second so my influenced by and biased
that means if it was sick Drake my boy
and it was so inspiring to be like yo
that's what humanity is all about if you
don't watch God's plan music video
freakin watch it that's what life is
about it's about sharing your success
with people it's about helping people
are less fortunate like it just puts so
much in perspective of what matters and
what doesn't matter and I fully truly
did like the law so yes this is exactly
what you think it is it is me still not
having unpacked from Trinidad and I will
get to that tomorrow don't give me the
points updates on the fluffy Whoopie
situation so I don't have a dog yet but
I'm hoping to get one this week and I'm
so excited like I'm so ready for our
dogs because I love animals and I had a
cat growing up and then after like Hank
I lost my mom was like no more animals
you get a dog when you move out and then
I moved on I had 700 more excuses as to
why I can't do it like my job and it'll
like I think I reached a point in my
life was like yo I'm gonna do all the
things I want to do and stop making
excuses to not do this with a rescue dog
but I have to find the right dog because
I need a dog that you know works for my
lifestyle and whatnot so no dog yet but
hopefully soon hopefully this weekend I
went little small fluffy Lobby
hey you don't forget to so I had a
realization the other day not a
realization I guess I already knew it
but like it was brought to my attention
through reflection
okay I realized something shut up and
get to the point I
really love hugs like my favorite thing
ever not just like oh I don't want to
hug like a no arm talk with good
intention when I was on the truck and
trade ad and I was upset about something
I went to Marshall and I was like he
just gave me a good hug but the hug
where you can feel the person like
really trying to give you positive
energy I love hugs like that and I
realized why I've been craving so many
hugs recent like I'm always hugging
everyone I'm like give me a hug give me
a hug and I feel out thirsty ho why I
discovered it's because I used to hug
nan her like a hundred times a day and
you used to give the best hugs ever so
like every time I pass a room I give him
a hug was upset I give him a hug every
morning and you did give me such tight
hugs me feel like that laughs I don't
get that from anywhere anymore and like
that's why I'm so like I want hugs
everyone hug me I'm trying to fill the
void of this beautiful man right here I
want all the hugs okay before we go to
the points let me just say before I
started vlogging today I drank a glass
of water so give me the point I still
did only drink one glass whoa what ha
what let's see how we did
yo tomorrow I'm gonna make a to-do list
so break I just feel like I've been lazy
so far I feel like I'm not doing enough
in a day tomorrow with a month from
killing so if you wanna hustle harder
subscribe and I'll see you tomorrow
you
