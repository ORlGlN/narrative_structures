okay so I didn't wake up at 6:00 a.m. yo
I set my alarm for 6:00 and I was
pressing snooze like an hour I think in
my sleep I did think of a video idea
either way my production moves to hours
so I think I'm gonna be ok don't know
what's wrong my voice I actually voice
noted none Denis my doctor friend to ask
her about this and she sent me a
five-minute long voice note two weeks
ago I happen to do smells what I'm going
to do today right now because my voice
is constantly like this and I don't know
why we have a jam-packed day this is a
mission you burst I have to go to a
doctor's appointment I'll explain why
then I have a call then have another
call that adds two hours to write some
scripts then I have a super 8 hours
after that emails if I swallow that I
want to write some Bond scripts and have
a bomb shoot and hopefully not sound the
commands with the entire process so join
along Oh base of the situation is I have
to get a check-up for the movie I'm
shooting on HBO I don't know why the
shooting in Toronto and they need like I
have no idea they need me to get checked
out before I shoot some movie as a fasiq
hopefully I don't find any corpo news
right now
all done also different cuz she's
literally like an insurance examinations
issues are you going to be doing any
stunts and I think after doing and are
you going to have to stop working
because it sounds annoying oh I get what
this is to make sure I don't get
seriously sick of shooting with my
clothes I'm like so different from
Canada I was telling her doctors in the
other would never be asking these
questions I guess is the specific exam
but she said I had excellent blood
pressure and every time she's check
something she said excellent which means
I must quickness grew as you start a new
channel I back home I have a call in
like two minutes so here's what I want
someone yesterday maybe I should start
talking about announces I don't have
time I'll call but I want to so I'm so
excited about the movie so you know the
real top I would subscribe will quick
please three minutes fun glad everyone
asked me that what do you want to do do
you want to go more into acting or do
you want to do YouTube still I always
say I want to do both I've never
understood why people don't do both I
feel like when people start taking the
traditional route they leave YouTube
behind I always thought maybe that's
their choice maybe they're choosing to
do that but now I'm learning it's be
kind of physically impossible like I'm
so stoked in the movie but of course the
movie has so many moving parts so
production schedule has changed like
four times the dates that I'm supposed
to go back to Toronto have switched at
least four times and so every time they
switch I make a new production schedule
for my channel roaming okay the sign
will shoot XY that day and the next day
it changes so much and then it's like
can't shoot any of those that's it XY
that day and I'm also at booking cruise
and suddenly I haven't come to write for
those days because they're switching
it's been so hard to balance both of
those things there's just one role in
one movie and I'm not even reading the
movie so I get why it's difficult to do
both and all the realization that
occurred to me as shaken sounds like oh
that's why it's just literally like
having two full-time jobs that are
competing with each other so I'm
supposed to the movie but I think moving
forward like I'm really interested in
developing my own stuff and making my
own stuff because I I have such a
business that I want to build and a
production company I want to build and a
channel I want to maintain and I can't
do that if I am at the beck and call of
other movies and I don't want to come
across like I upset it I'm so excited to
shoot the movie I'm just telling you the
reality of the situation I think I just
wound for and want to create my own
things that I can make the comments to
my schedule because in my heart I don't
want to sacrifice YouTube and I don't
want to sacrifice my business and the
shows all the stuff I do for whoopee
even though audition process was a great
example like I get that's one way to get
into movies but he will an audition for
roles in LA that's their main thing they
are available to audition and they are
able to memorize things and go yes I'll
come in tomorrow where's I'm traveling
and performing and making videos so I'm
not always so available what's the point
of me trying to get the same role as
someone who's super available and should
get it I just need to start making my
own stuff and my own movies and my own
everything and this is my call right now
so BRB finish my interview
give the points finish my second goal
give me the point now I need to lock
myself in a room for two hours of script
writing shouldn't go on well Romans in
the first video of the two we're going
to shoot this is not professional scene
so I got my professional hallway here on
let me give this a presentation and then
you wake up
actually away so we're going to
earlier we shot the lily from the side
next month yeah everybody we had in
ruddy home stretch right now last shot
no blood second less Eddie not martini
we are doing lighting changes taking 84
years like always and we have
professionals working here making me
look like a movie star thank you thank
you and we're done shooting what a
difficult stressful shoe but we did it I
think there's real grit I saw through
the ramp portion for Oklahoma tomorrow
I'm 1118 I'm so tired not sleeping yet
but we're not doing so give it a point
to video down oh when I'm tired right
now
as I've never slept I'm so tired a
little bit past midnight 12 20 something
mad productive day mad productive
commissure oh we have a play about King
by the way hey Arnold is coming back so
real Kings as a real king also not have
brought me a gift from studio 71 which
obviously you know what the reviews you
were sedition to my room oh you would
dictate is hell I'm gonna want to bet
Morrow is quite possibly not tomorrow
actually the rest of the days before I
leave for Montreal are John liner laptop
are just intense tomorrow I got writing
I got two calls and then I have a girl
of screening so another jam-packed day
but y'all strapped in ready to get it
done you know also you'll get news if
you haven't really done so today my
Twitter's is full of us right now what
humble releases music bit of her hair I
haven't watched the full music video yet
fun fact I told him not to show it to me
before he released it because in this
video I play a lesbian and I'm having
like my lover dress as a girl and I was
like oh Cameron do this shoot I'm gonna
ask you feel kind of like I really want
to represent like a whole bunch of
different girls of do you mind doing
this scenery comfortable again I will do
this absolutely went up so when I was
shooting it like I really had to step
out of my comfort zone and be like okay
you got to be thanked for you - it
sounds like pretty nervous and insecure
about it but I haven't watched yet I
refuse like don't show it to me before
you will because I don't want to have an
opinion about it and I want you to
release this art like you intend to
really start without having my
insecurities like tell you to tweak
things so I haven't watched anyone watch
it down but you guys should all go watch
it I'm going to show you the clip right
now that features me but then I'll put
in the description as well as a full
video going shows I'm lucky to work so
hard on it and I'm gonna watch me - I'm
sure it's fantastic but this is the part
with me so checker and a lot of ways
they never think it does real and every
single more feels like those promises
you may can see yourself the world is
always weighing on your Chester's been
 up and now and I say assalamu
alaikum subsidy kyle and what it do
couple break-ins couple makeups now I
wake up next to you right now we watches
you see before me because I would watch
it right now I haven't even seen my
partner i watch it okay so i watched it
too never been so insecure but watching
a thing like this'll like oh god oh god
oh god I've got a guy I don't know you
guys don't you like it I can't like
watch it and be completely confident I
don't know what it is I guess this is a
good new thing I've never done before
but like I can't like I don't know I'm
so insecure about it music feels so dope
though it is all these different types
of women all shapes and sizes and
abilities and sexual preferences I just
singing the lyrics humble song so make
sure you go check it out each adult job
on it and for all of you asking yet it
was definitely out of my comfort zone
but I always say success lies outside of
your comfort zone and I always feel like
the stories told in music and in movies
and in TV shows should represent real
people in the world your honor in my
interview today I was saying that and so
it's like I would never refuse to play a
character like that I refuse to play and
you'd have a character I think the
people you see in art should be
representative the people that exist in
the world and so I'm down for all oh
yeah the dope and thanks humble for
letting me step out of my comfort zone
that's a wrap on today let's see how we
do
it's stuck realist thanks for joining me
on today we got a really hectic two days
following I keep saying this but it's
just like me talking to myself over over
here to boot feel better get some
sentiment talk say about my direction of
my career and where I want to go Nelson
