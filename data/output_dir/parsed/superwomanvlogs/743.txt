when you wake up to a tweet from your
homeboy good morning so I just I mean so
many days I just voted for my faves for
people Choice Awards I vote for Selena
Gomez Dwayne Johnson Big Bang Theory
because Colonel and Shay Mitchell and
the rock just responded thing so I keep
saying they're all cousins Twitter name
was the rock when the rock responded
saying love you though along your fancy
since I was like I look honestly let's
just a little morning rant about how
important is to support people that you
think are awesome and that you love like
I went on my way to not on my way it's
easy to vote for them but it's so
important for me to both people like
this because I've met them in real life
and they're wonderful people and I
believe in paying it forward but people
that have that wonderful energy to you
know prosper in the world to spread that
wonderful energy so like I would like to
say no matter how big I get in the world
I will still not be big enough to ever
not tweet vote for someone I don't care
how big I am I was so tweet vote for all
the people I love go over all those
people there's certified wonderful human
beings that I've met in person that I
can say will make the world a better
place so that's just my two cents and I
believe that they deserve support and
I'm like I'm not stupid this is a way
bigger than me my vote t probably means
nothing but I'm like yo it doesn't
matter I'm doing my small part because I
love them focus on who we help as
opposed to always thinking about who's
helping us you know what the interesting
thing is I was think about this it's all
about the legacy you leave behind it's
not always like statues and awards and
all this stuff and sometimes it's about
the people you helps along the way and I
always always think about this I'm like
so many times and this is billion times
the best example so many times people
ask the clear inspirations and I often
say you know Dwayne Johnson or Selena
Gomez and when Dwayne was a wrestler he
obviously inspired people but little do
you know there was me sitting gardens
that inspired me it could be quite
possible that his inspiration led me to
becoming super oh I'm part of that led
me to become Superman and now his
daughter sits in my audience and kind
it's kind of like full circle it's kind
of like you never know who you're
impacting years from now there could be
someone on the Superman audience that is
like oh you know I went to a Superman
show and they could become like
president they become Prime Minister of
Canada
like some amazing person and all the
amazing things our own ways but think
about the impact your inspiration your
actions your support could have today of
what it could help someone become so I'm
a true believer that you got to help
support people that you think are dope
that's my three-minute round of mourning
we're gonna go out fireman shopping
again and that is an intense work day I
didn't post a video yesterday when I
tried to win today if this is still
blurry I'm sorry I don't know what if it
is still blurry honestly I know keep
saying the laws and I guess I'm just
have to buy a new blog camera because it
doesn't seem like there's anything on it
so let's go apartment shopping wearing
the same clothes kinda because don't
have clothes hello my name is Lisa and I
have a problem I'm in a bit of a dilemma
humble and I will break down this
dilemma for you when we get home about
the apartment yeah there any matters
okay will tell you the dilemma with that
progress so talk about the permit a
little bit first we're heading to my
business managers office cuz I I'm
getting a new phone I just remembered
that right getting a new part by name
changing my number that's it
a lot of real things happening vegan
that's all a real thing that any
business manager name's Rachel she's
wonderful he's not paying attention but
she's wonderful and spectacular yeah so
at this rate if these trends remain
pumpkins are gonna be worth so much in
November and December
and then you have fun I'm 19 and I'm
really a new phone yeah my lens is
definitely still very it could be that
the stickers on it right now that but
besides that something's wrong with my
lens I can set it's blurry right look at
it yeah yeah I don't know so they might
be damaged inside what are you what are
you staying tonight
yo yo yo today was a day with lots of
big girl wins uh-huh I got my I don't
know if I mentioned this in elastic I
got my American debit cards I got my new
America phone home budget if my American
apartment that big dude let's have a
beast of a work session please I need to
pee I'm gonna do that OB session beast
y'all after today there will be no more
work left to do it's gonna work so hard
my new thing I do now is when I have our
sessions how to mentally prepare I sit
down I don't you seen my vlogs and I
strap in
oh you see this so I go top recession
time to stress all right I'm what sent
an email confirming a place an apartment
on my end I have a hold on it so like
nothing should go wrong but like I'm
sending this email so like let me just
type it up okay okay humble can I have
two minutes we have to discuss the
apartment dilemma and situation that's
it over here right here okay this is
gonna be Oh super few moments of real
talk here looking either water that's
how intense it is okay basically feel
feet I just thought that I'm done this
is you wait for the apartment
I am never lived alone so I'm searching
for an apartment I know when I move away
there's a few factors that will play a
role number one is I want to be
responsible it's the first time I've
made decisions on my own my own finances
my own placement or whatever but I also
know my move will be a little bit
emotional because I'll be moving with my
family and friends
and I might get lonely sometimes and I
think it's really important for me to be
in place you know I like to surround
myself positivity so be in a place that
makes me feel at my best makes me feel
happy so I'm trying to find a balance
between happiness and responsibility and
financial responsibility so you know
I've tried to book a billion places and
they've all fallen through and in
literally less than two weeks I'm
supposed to be moving here or in two
weeks sorry I'm so smoking here so I
have a place it's a little over time
cringe situation so yesterday I saw a
place it was which shall be referred to
as pentose it's a penthouse which
obviously is not like you no matter what
fancy stuff I know but it's not like
door you know golden door handle
penthouse it's just the apartment on the
top floor of a very small building yeah
so as soon as I walked in I fell in love
with it because there was so much
natural light something that makes me
very happy there's a separate area from
my office that was like really good for
me cuz like I can actually feel like I'm
going to a different area to work in
that way like my workaholic ways could
find balance that would be like hey now
I'm going to work in the office no I'm
not working so like mentally that was
good I loved it it was so unique was so
creative and I loved it it is the more
expensive option more than I wanted to
spend but very made me feel good so I
was pretty much set on that and then
today with my departments searching
again and I found a place that was
nothing was wrong with it it was modern
it was clean it was nice it was smaller
there was not that much natural light
the view was a wall basically but then I
was I talking about mom like nothing's
wrong this place in this place is like
significantly cheaper than the penthouse
and like may even be ridiculous and I
just go with this affordable option and
then I affordable okay what is the right
word more economic sure what the
difference affordable is portable is
like okay one is gonna be more of a
struggle versus the other you still you
still everything that you looked at it
is still within a respectable budget yes
you know so it's not like I will be
totally effing myself again times more
than you that's the big thing your
realizable in life a lot of people spend
way more than they
yes so let me add that point I am
fortunate enough to say that I would be
fine
renting either but just I was just like
it was a hard pill to swallow for me to
be like if I have this option that is
you know cheaper should I just do this
this is more responsible but then humble
is raising the point of like honestly do
which what makes you happier like why
don't you to go to the place that makes
you feel better so I just made the
decision to go to the penthouse because
I'm like honestly I will just fit right
away - you know maybe work harder a
little bit I don't know if that's a
thing but like basically the Marla story
is if I gotta do a few more brand deals
to pay for this place it makes me
happier allow it yeah liliane fillin oh
yeah Ingrid yes so now that Lily's
becoming a independent adults where
she's not leaving her parents house you
know just know that I got to pay some
bills and that was a decision I was
having such a dilemma because I was like
oh my god and while I could do SH if I
do this but I was like you know what
honestly or really hard I should be in a
place especially during an emotional
move that makes me feel good and again
it's not like MTV Cribs it's not gold
lining the building yeah show us not
like ivory stuff you know part of it is
like always luxurious and I want it
because I want to be like a baller no it
just literally I walked in the first
thing I thought about was oh my god I
would love working in this place yeah so
it was it is not pricey because it's
fancy is pricey because it's in a great
location and again it's very roomy and
again that's a lot of windows and stuff
like that so it's not like there's not
like getting a Bentley of apartments now
it's not being fancy for the sake of
being fancy yeah and and even like
everything about it that I love is for
my work I'm like oh my God look at this
the windows not for the view is because
I'm like not your life for my videos I
can make videos in your with all lights
so it's like yeah so I just wanted to
open up with you guys and tell you that
a lot of adult things are happening in
my life and you know you see a bar
dealer to pop up just needs to eat Emily
needs to live you don't have to do that
you don't have to do that at all no you
don't have to do that you know I love
you but you know I'm we're with you in
that situation I got a daughter
Spencer's coming up

my vlog camera it's blurry so something
is wrong with the lens these shots seem
to be fine
