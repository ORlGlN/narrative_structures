this range of markets on this this right
here but this is going to be the last
toilet tux happy halftime show Sunday
today is some sort of a sporting event
when you're watching Monday but
yesterday today everyone everywhere is
having fun but not today not for me
although work is kind of fun she's just
probably start the vlog right let's do
that we hustle harder even on the
weekend I did not vlog at all yesterday
you want to know why why why I did so
much crap I made a personal Calvados
from this time for this time you're
doing this I read a script i f and
practice my lines I've memorized my
lines I've made dance videos like
everything happened and now today it's
gonna continue I have a strict schedule
of things I need to do I would love to
get drunk and watch the Super Bowl I
don't know I think I'm a sport but we
have so many things to do for Trinidad
so here's the mission got packs for my
addition that I had to store to buy a
few things return it then I gotta
practice my dance stuff then I gotta
practice with my auditions for more
gotta send a few emails to my team more
than anything practice for my audition
here's the deal I've been memorizing the
lines every single day I still believe
that no audition is the make-or-break of
your life I don't think you should ever
treat something or it's like it could be
the mate but never the break that's the
important thing and so try my best but I
don't want to trip myself up to believe
that like my life will be over no their
time apps the best I'm putting a lot of
effort into it I don't want to stress
myself up so right now we're going to
the store to get important toiletry
stuff when I say that I mean I want
funky adidas shirts for a turn dad why
didn't you talk whining whining big it's
up you might be wondering why you
specifically need a deed of stuff for
Carnival here's the deal I don't wear
the cost you because if you order them
so much in advance and I'm not a fit
person so I still want to look like
colorful and these originals has also
like floral colorful things I'm like I'm
on Marshalls truck so I need to like
look a little bit legit and colorful I
can't be rocking I need some Kyle that's
where blockage realized mission tell
Kyle give Kyle a soul also I'm hoping
because of Superbowl
the store is empty
two things happen one destroyed in
heaven I was looking for - I prevented
myself from buying 10 unnecessary things
or try another location it's 30 minutes
away so it's okay a lot of two hours of
its husk mission accomplished hashtag
not an ad red light I didn't find as
much as I wanted to but I bought this
dope dress I'm gonna show you in a
second hold on so this is what I got
