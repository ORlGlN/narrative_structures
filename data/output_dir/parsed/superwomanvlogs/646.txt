my years of traveling I've never had a
childhood spirits like this YouTube that
best put beer business class Emirates
it's a double-decker plate I've never
been on one you to look at this seat
hold on hold on look at this
wife was a bar and around the back you
play like you go down as a good bar
where you can stand and drink
underground a brief second episode of
cover note I don't think they leave I
fancy things were somewhere else but my
taken here emerges I remember that aqua
cook you cook a Japan gear
I'm feeling that there's a friend on the
same flight as me as if you can find
them
standby what's up look weird no you
don't you look at--look stress I didn't
know he was leaving today and I was
leaving tomorrow and I spelled the salad

great I need help
okay I'm going through it but I have
champagne inside just watch episode 1
season 5 premiere tomorrow story and
gone
I want to do I can't do which kind of
sucks
we have seven hours to go still
reported to be able to lie down
they function for the seamless travels
very
as some national I'm talking to debate
to ever start over we are
sleeper but now
but this delivery
to sleep on the second play
landed in Dubai business class lounge oh
that's just like a massive area from so
you're one of food writers or food
that's what I'm reward where food I
right now who feels around is the open
area hello hello hello
okay this lounge is like the size of the
hotel it's like a hotel in the airport
lounge alone has like hundred rooms
thousands of seats and thousands of
places just sit it's cool nice awesome
passed up healthy eating just who must
miss potatoes and pasta much eat
something only here for two hours and
then yeah I kind of learned I can get as
much work as I want to get done at a 60
hour flight I wanted to think of a whole
bunch of like scripts and creative ideas
or clubs but I need Wi-Fi to do that
North is widely need why so I keep
broken riding knee right thigh had to
write scripts because i i i need the in
trick
search things what I'm thinking idea I
have to watch like for example if I'm
thinking about a script for Bollywood
stuff I could watch a bunch of like
Bollywood songs and Bollywood stuff to
like get the juices flow and help me
brainstorm so I need Wi-Fi to that kind
of stuff but it's kind of bombed but you
already get some good sleep and I did
watch a lot of mom says comedy show
called mom and just hilarious is so
freakin funny so watching lot that spend
some time with Carter so that's good
it's good relax me I did some work like
I did as much work as I could without
you go so I mean without wind trip
Miculek no and it's faster
so little rent things like this woman at
war is why when you girl of not because
I think these women are actually at work
but because this is at a front of a
magazine right now the breaking news
right now is that these three girls are
supposedly at war which may or may not
be true but when two guys beef like when
Wiz khlifa and Kanye West fighter when
Kanye West has to someone else or like
when two guys fight is really at the
cover of a magazine media society likes
to pick girls against each other
likes to make it seem like we all hate
each other that's not true practice grow
up that is what girl love is so
important that is why I'm so passionate
about it mother effers know I'm really
sleepy we just boarded the second flight
we got the hours until boom bye I don't
this blog blog blog blog has been
exciting I think it's just put a lot of
me saying three more hours 12 more hours
many more hours but that's just going on

hotel I should I wear my own towel
I might unpacks up this thing or when I
stay anywhere longer than two days I
unpack all of my things do in front of
me but I really take off my clothes hang
them in the closet or make the one right
spot my shoes in a putt paper proper

my life and stuff so yeah another gym
