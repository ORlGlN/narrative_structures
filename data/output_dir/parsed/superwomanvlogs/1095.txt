so that is a fun song you know it's
light-hearted it's a little bit comedic
but it's not committed to the point
where it's goofy we still want to be a
song with a message but something fun
that you shouldn't bump with in the club
with big friends and it was such an
amazing shoot because so many people
came with Mesa Florida weather was our
friends and family being in the video or
whether it was our friends supplying
things for the video it was just a good
time positive vibes all around so huge
shoutouts
everyone loved us what are you having to
you Oh
ticket ticket so that means to have your
friends look at you like laughs laughs
yeah yeah yeah that's the reason I
wasted my entire nation is that gonna
cost you a job make a song like that
okay everybody we're ready to go you're
rich you're hot you're sexy and action
me trying to do music and tell you the
stuff it's a music it's totally scary
and I'm so blessed to do my first series
trap with such a good friend and ecology
person home before super blessed to be
working with in booty shorts in the
winter rockin almonds holes in the snow
making out with your friends man
and you say that you hate message behind
that it's just real I mean especially in
this industry so many people try to mold
you they try to turn you into something
you're lean on and they try to turn you
to something that they people are gonna
like better except it's almost like
trying to create this big figure it I
just want to keep it real ridiculous as
hell like to know your muscles when you
take a pic spending more time checking
girls and working now looking in that
gut every time you walk around
