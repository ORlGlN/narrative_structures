depending on some sizzurp yo what's up
it is what time is at 10:30 I woke up
about an hour and a half ago to practice
her on my addition I actually really
like this role we'll just see if I can
do it well now I'm trying this new thing
as well for this edition where I'm
dressing completely comfortable so
wearing some cakes I'm gonna leave my
hair in a bun usually I take it out and
try to look pretty no like a fit I'm
feel comfortable try again to my element
my chest is so congested so I'm about to
take this cough syrup right now
hopefully it clears up
I can try our best honestly I had a
little realization this one too I'm like
you're stressed about auditions you're
stressed of all the stuff you're sick
but you know there's so many things to
be grateful for and I think I'm
forgetting that I am just like oh so
stressed about things I try to prepare
things like dude I'm living in LA in a
great apartment I get to go to auditions
this is my career yes it's stressful
sometimes yes it causes me anxiety
sometimes like I'm really really
grateful for all the stuff so like
that's the goal for today to remember
that and put things into perspective
when you go I'm gonna try our best the
worst that's gonna happen is I'm gonna
do absolutely horrible and I've already
done that before so I don't know exactly
what that feels like when you go we're
try our best that's what's going on
let's take some cough syrup dude thank
you baby
Cheers yes
yeah fix me boys
when humble sees there's a banana holder
but there's hope he wouldn't banana what
the hell is this I went in there Mike
off was that an all-time-high was like
coughing away but I made jokes about a
suicide I think it went good I think it
went well I'm not sure I did starter
once no excuses ever since I got these
buttons on my teeth little thing said
Invisalign my speaking hasn't been it's
like a hundred ice there certain words
but in this audition at least understood
I kept going I don't let it like stumble
stumble too much on it so I'm getting a
bit used to it I need to get antibiotics
or something we did it
it's Monday we have lots of other work
to do let's go do that work everyone's
looking at me yes I'm vlogging okay back
to the clean eating just a dress I never
to Mike off my soul is escaping it's so
tiring I'm gonna stop complaining about
now though because it's my own fault for
not going to doctor but I'm gonna watch
some youtubes eat some food usually I
don't watch things while I eat I usually
just just eat and don't do anything else
but I'm not feeling too great so I'm
gonna watch some YouTube eat this and go
from there that's what's up turn the F
up turning in life is worth living
so live another day sometime thing
doesn't mean you have to give it
I keep cuffing today I think I'm gonna
take a little bit of nap actually um
today the things that are happening I
got invited to go to the screening of
the boss which is Muslim
Melissa mesm Melissa McCarthy's new
movie and I'm trying my best to go
because I actually were really a big fan
of Melissa McCarthy I think she's
hilarious obviously it's not mandatory
to go I just really want to go because I
had to consider things like that work
you know seeing other people acts seeing
what they do how they all wicked and
ting and also of course without one
addition then I got another one
they're like you can cover in today at 5
if you want or you can tape it I think
I'm gonna tape it which I'm a little
stressed about because the only people
have ever tape with are my mom and
oceany I'm gonna convince humble to do
with me and just man up or woman up what
a woman up and do it but that's what
going on but I just need to lie down for
a little bit because I'm being a little
that's how I feel so pop my Invisalign

5:43 and I decided I'm not gonna go to
the screening it's actually a red carpet
