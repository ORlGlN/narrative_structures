today we're gonna be happy what if sweat
a reference good morning a time is 9:30
I woke up about an hour ago
ate breakfast get a little bit of the
casual swags going on here I am headed
to the new house today one to pick up my
keys check on the stuff that's been
happening there with contractor - I'm
making it with mr. K which I'm very
excited about because mr. Kate will be
decorating my office in the new house
and I'm so nervous
what's so excited about it because I'm
such a control freak but I've seen a lot
of their stuff and so dope and so I'm
like we're gonna let go of the control
make it happen that's what I'm like come
with me yes look us up before double
date who are we who are we I do not know
we're heading there and then later on
today I'm going to Nevada Campbell's
coming as well to Gina Rodriguez event
I'm she's honoring women at this
beautiful event and I am speaking there
so it's gonna be a productive day
eventful day
I have many boogers in my every day I
wake up this boogers in my nose every
day I don't know no medication nothing I
have boogers I might as just part of my
life now yeah yet yep we left all that
stuff there I'm having a really tough
time okay first thing I discovered is
that there's actually heating systems on
each floor so each floor can be a
different eco system that's the floor
I'm on could be harder but the
contractor left all the windows open and
let the heat off it's freezing here and
we're trying to heat it up but it's
taking so long like freezing now the
sniffles does not help with my booger
situation so I'm like we have these
doors open and I'm just like trying to
be in the Sun SPOT like mr. cans gonna
be here soon ain't it clarified because
it's a girl but it's mr. K I need to ask
about the situation you know I'm nervous
it's because my office I'm very
particular about everything as I am with
everything in my life but it needs to be
a certain vibe and atmosphere and feel
and didn't trust someone else with that
I'm excited because I probably have
ideas I won't have but I'm also really
nervous cuz like I'll be so picky about
it oh my god this sunspot feels so good
right here
oh that will go in my nosy okay my
nerves are slightly disappearing in my
excitement is rising because mr. Kate is
dope and I clarified with mr. Kang and
for those that don't know is she calls
herself mr. Kate which I love I think
that's amazing just to be like making a
statement
yeah I don't know why not yes as she's
dope finer I love it I look we don't
have to leave our cell of the way
society tells us to is she not
everything that I would want in a friend
like I love this so we're in the office
right now and yes was the room where I
was like I don't want to do it she's
already dropped like four or five
knowledge bombs that are blown my mind
so yeah we don't yeah I'm really excited
there's a lot of potential it's a petite
room we're gonna fit four people in here
and make it a unicorn explosion heard so
excited
so Kyle message saying that he posts
many post made it write something to my
house he's like just cuz you mentioned

times I can play about this how many
times Kyle I used to marry that mad I
need to I need to flip that man you to
marry that man but I'm offered you my

this off he was one of those we look
like best friends right
I'm totally gonna be best friends
please welcome from blackish the
immensely talented Yara Shahidi and a
superwoman unicorn Lilly Singh
so inspiring today to see all these
young women honored for such amazing
achievements but I want to tell you
about another way to make a difference
in our society to make your voices heard
and it may surprise you it's with Co ya
computer programming literally powers
our modern world less than 1% of high
school girls plan to me
don't plan to major in computer science
and let's be real that needs to change
we need more women running tech more
women of color a real home with 11
something those last my new bedtime
amazing of it was such a wonderful event
honoring some really spectacular women
huge house to Gina you are gem and a
half I can tell we're gonna be BFFs also
I messed up a little bit on my
presenting I'm stuck also I was talking
humble I'm like this is what I get
better at and I don't know if I can
because I don't know if it's within me
every time I go to events not to do
anything with this at the streamys or
like doing and you could be like one
sentence I just have less fun cuz the
whole time I'm like not stressing about
it but I'm going over to my brain I'm
like am going over it I got it isn't I
don't have as much fun so today I told
myself read over a few times but it's
okay if you fumble you're human it's
like do you unroll bot ik and then I
fumbled so maybe the key is that I do
have to be robotic to do well I don't
know I don't know what the message is
here or the lesson is here but there's
some lesson here because today I was
like weed over it don't be so hard on
yourself I'm a little bit on it not the
end of the world how much you have a
good time and another thing is like I
have to Hummels a good friend because
when I do anything I ask him 600 times
if I did good not like I'll ask him over
it over and over and over again because
I'm so and then I'll be like you didn't
do good you did well shallow
right okay you didn't mantastic everyone
loved it
you were very funny and I think that's
what people like my Spanx are literally
breaking my spine right now I need to
look cute I thought about cut them up I
don't know if I can take it off like I
don't ever take my Spanx off right now
my skin is gonna come off with him
that's what I feel like what this dress
is super dope yeah you did you know I'm
never hungry action to be honest I don't
know
I changed can we just take a moment I
know you can see my table below this
thinks mugs but I'm like ah I can
breathe right now I'm so inspired by
that event I think it's so awesome soul
girl love everything I stand for and
home what makes a good point humble is
not a fan of award shows cuz he believes
like you should honor people instead of
making people compete against each other
that's exactly what this was there was
just so many strong amazing women and it
was really inspirational and who cares
if I fumbled a little bit I had
basically had this joke and everyone
laughed so I felt better but I didn't
fumble it was a learning experience
actually the teleprompter was so fast it
was like when I was like Oh Frank it's
who cares forget someone for everything
else it was a really great event and I
feel so lucky and privileged to have
been there and he was called Gina my
friend just it was just so awesome I
grab my clutter I can't lose this but it
was just so wonderful and was just such
a good energy and warm my heart I'm just
like so motivated to do more with girl
