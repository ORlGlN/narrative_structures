glorious day on planet earth where all
things are wonderful or we make them

you're thinking isn't that humble from
yesterday in the days like all five days
before no we just don't change our
clothes I told you where Simpsons
characters get on it okay that's what's
up
today is video day it's gonna be a very
productive day I've already done such
great things since I woke up with
amazing ideas and I'm very excited about
the rest of the day I'm also very
excited with the sandwiches let's make
sandwiches this is what homeboy and I
are friends right okay let me just
because I pull up my hummus right this
was I pulled out for my sandwich Kyle
says they're on recall they're on recall
for some sort of back here at home but I
both like so it's like both just not
willing to give up the hummus and right
now I'm conflicted because I like to put
this on my bread in my sandwich so now
I'm like I don't understand it assumed
the role of stealing all our phones yeah
the taker you're basically a Dementor
there's a clue
you see sandwich of us all funny-like
down that could be my lock screen right

that could be my walk stream right there
that sandwich try again between that
bread right now mmm hello I'm a youtuber
that is not an idea for video today I'm
racking my brains where are those days
or my video what did you oh that's an
idea idea sucks what about this oh that
sucks don't be so critical
I can't think of anything but the time
is only 3:30 which I mean it's not too
early but it's a little bit time and why
brighter breath cos I walk upstairs that
FitLife doe oh my god I just came up
with a video idea that I love so much
I'm so excited to be honest I had this
idea like a year and a half ago and I
forgot about it and today something
reminded me of a time like oh this is so
good it is so sassy and so good it's so
it's so
hey so I'm so excited we'll shoot this
ish get it done get
done well this set design though for my
new video can we just take a moment also
I'm like obsessed with this okay so this
is from like it's like a sweet tea place
like a bubble tea place so it's not
bubble tea it's like something you to
have back in the day when I was a kid
and I rediscovered recently it's a
banana smoothie with lychee gels at the
bottom now if you don't know Swami I
love lychee jellies like I love them I'm
all about this ish cuz my straw and my
drink got a coordinating yeah just Kyle
ordered for me without even asking
that's how you know key to my heart
right here don't ask me if I'm hungry I
want food just get it for me I'm always
hungry kept putting me would eat me I'm
thirsty all the time I did a
professional slags
today okay so here's a fun fact about me
and I'm sure many of you can relate when
my staff tells me to do a side part I
always like no because my whole
childhood had to do it sorry a middle
part my whole childhood I was like I had
to do a middle part called a middle part
braid and middle part yet Indian life
and so now every time just has to do it
I'm like no but apparently just doesn't
look nice and one so I did a middle part
today for my video I'm getting over I'm
doing the middle part if I'm just if I
Hamza is the babe just delayed what's
cooking good-looking a sandwich is
what's cooking again today for that for
the second time because I needed it for
a video cuz it's called how to make a
sandwich and I've actually like I really
like this video I've never done anything
like this it was me exactly that word
exaggeratedly exactly responding to a
negative column because you know how you
just don't do that and I'm explaining
why don't do it in a super comedic way
and I'm almost thinking to make this a
series or once a month I pick a comment
and I do this tell me what you think is
I think this is freaking hilarious and
I'm so excited about it and I'm so
excited to experiment and thank you for
allowing me to experiment because truth
be told
not everyone's audience is like that and
super supportive which you are and I
love that about you so I'm gonna edit
this a time a 733 we gonna get this out
let go on a cutting board chop up your
onion now if you start too painfully
cheer up don't worry
now you know how your mother feels when
she sees how you turned out Manama emo
synagogue Alico say emotion emotion
listen okay so the coolest thing just
happened
Kyle called me like dialed my number and
called me on the phone to tell me how
much he liked my video like that is like
hey I know you think that's weird
because like I guess only tweets and
stuff like press on to physically pick
up the phone and be like I have tears of
my eyes on this video like definitely
touch my heart I'm really actually
really happy with this video I feel like
I'm completely making this a series on
my channel like I had so much fun tuning
it I am reborn and rejuvenated creative
wise I love this video oMG I'm having
such a productive day like I did my
video just two two more videos I had to
do for something else for like an event

less makeup and I was like okay I like
it what a productive day I don't fill up
myself
fill myself tomorrow we have a call and
that's it pretty much for the day so I
can work on stuff and I'm excited I love
days like that wear it off anything
planned major because I can do all those
things that I don't make time for every
other day such as like there's still a
few collaborations I don't have creative
or for the 12 clubs Christmas that's
starting summer first by the way a lot
of them aren't even confirmed yet so 12
clubs of Christmas always stressful that
way because like hope pimple I shouldn't
touch it I'm so annoying stop it why you
so dumb are you dumb I don't I don't all
right um all right um are you oh yeah
not a lot of them are confirmed but
that's always what happens with tall
clubs Christmas act like roll with the
punches and like have a list of people
not list always changes in someone who
cancels or flop someone confirms and
then chaos it's chaos but it's exciting
and I love it I was that's happening
