I have never been so disappointed in
humanity
this is gonna be me speaking from
emotions and not politically correctly
but Trump just became the mother effing
President of the United States can we
just take a moment I've been up for
hours lying awake in bed following us on
Twitter finally my parents woke up I
could turn on the TV
I just I'm gonna be the first to say I
don't know everything about American
politics I don't I'm not American I'm
Canadian I'm still invested in this
election because it was more than Epping
presidents is a guy who publicly is
sexist and racist and I'm just in awe
that more than this half of America
supports someone like this whether you
want change wherever I'm so I I want to
cry because I'm just like I don't
understand first of all on Twitter
there's examples of some women women
tweeting saying a woman is not fit to
lead America what the eff kind of
failure do you have to be as a woman for
to be a woman and and write something
like that saying it just happened
because a woman is not yet fit to eat
America I just I I just can't even like
deal with the situation and to have
someone who's so openly disrespectful
and against LGBTQ just I just I can I'm
not making sense because I just I can't
even believe it's 2016 and Trump just
being the president of America I am
sickened I am disheartened I am so
furious right now tomorrow I'm sure I'll
be much more clear and live even later
on once I just take a shower and calm
down a little thank God I'm not in LA
right now because you can't even imagine
what what's happening there but I am
just so effing disappointed and utterly
shocked and I'm gonna stop talking
because I have been ranting with two
minutes about this but this is just
unacceptable and I cannot believe that
you just can't I just can't
all those all the videos I mean laughing
is like there's no way Trump Cohen
there's no way that Americ
is gonna let this happen what the f what
what I don't just like to say it was
something my concluding statement here
anyone who is watching this who's like a
younger girl I'm just gonna and from a
personal standpoint I know many people
are affected by this but if you're
younger colored girl washes and you're
like what the hell does half of this
country really hate me dude you will you
are not alone and you will succeed and
you more than ever need to fight hard
anyone who is negatively impacted by
this you allowed to be scared you're
allowed to be sad but you now have to
fight and stand tall but yo ask all of
these wack morals and values these
people have and you need to stand your
own because I'm letting you know if you
are watching us and you are a young
woman of color looking at me thinking
like oh my god I'm so alone ah look at
me look at me
hustle hard work hard have your head on
straight and F and succeed success is
one of the best ways you can work
against stupid crap like this and that
is what I'm going to say for right now
because I'm so livid I did I cannot both
just I can't I can't we're headed to the
train station to go to Madrid and
excited mom it's gonna be good it's
gonna be good chain vibes dreams I've
spent two and a half hour train ride
should be good should be nice scenic
things I love that view right through
um and gets morphed and hopefully work
on some 12 clad stuff pass the vibes of
two and a half hours and then we get
there at around 1/2 ish maybe something
like that see trying so hard to be
positive and not mad and angry we made
it to Madrid this is the room look very
cool view over here check it out beam
very very cool the bright room
I dig sit I dig sit we got over here
so Madrid is pretty much like the three
we're on is kind of like a broad way of
this area so it's really cool is our
musicals and theaters and so on
it's very busy we're just searching for
food right now we're on the waiting list
for TGI Fridays because when in Spain
eat food that you're used to I guess I
don't we had a lot of Spanish food as
well or searching right now and that's
what's up
I was a train you like the Train yes I
fell asleep the whole time housekeeping
I was drooling the whole time give us
like a train yes I love it
Oh Dunkin Donuts
Oh
when you order Benitez and it comes in a
tower
it's a tower and all I can think about
now is Trump Towers and I'm instantly
sad all over again today is a sucky day
today is a sucky day where a blast feel
good food
I see the positives Hillary's about to
make her speech right now we're gonna
watch that I'm sorry this whole vlog
doesn't have the same theme it's an
angry sad vlog I'm justified and allowed
to feel Swiss I'm 19 apologize for your
song grateful in Spain it's a beautiful
sight and Here I am being upset but I'm
validated and justified feel this way
ballet just might my mom what don't
laugh at me we had ice cream we had ice
cream because of you so bad and sad
Henry it's not even about specifically
Hillary it's about what this represents
no anything and it's wrong it's wrong
wrong with people it's why don't know I
don't know their brain is where's your
brain eyes Dornish then don't understand
oh yeah just watch the latest episode of
The Walking Dead which was alright if
you're the last two episodes have been
like I guess maybe nothing's as dramatic
as the last episode of America but I'm
going to end this blog because let's be
real nothing's happening I'm a sad
person today my spirits are low I mean
that's a really pretty dream outside
which is really cool also I don't know
if I said it but till it talked we live
um in Madrid we did nothing today
because I'm what kind of all down in the
dumps but we're here for two days
tomorrow we will do some sightseeing
tomorrow I'm gonna I mean I'm here about
my parents here I don't want to make
this whole trip ruined because of that
so I'm going to try and best tomorrow to
wake up and be good and awesome if my
rant earlier offended any I'm kind of
caught in the middle because
go here I'm sorry kind of caught in the
middle because I want to say if I
offended anyone I'm sorry in which I
would never want to offend anyone but I
just cannot accept I cannot support an
allowance of racism and sexism so that's
what I will say is I don't want to
offend anyone
but at the same time I do not take back
regardless of anything else the fact
that now president three United States
has made many sexist and racist and just
insensitive comments and has a lot of
beliefs I don't agree with and I think
it's absolutely ridiculous that forty
five presidents in we don't think we're
ready for a female president regardless
of anything else you can comment below
saying all types of stuff about pros and
cons the idea the point still remains
that were 45 presidents in and still not
have ever given a female a chance to run
that country that's all the more safe
but with that I couldn't sleep because I
don't know everything about politics and
I'm sure many people point that out in
the comments below until you I say don't
care
nerd on Sean Penn never going to be
unless he has some major swing change in
personality or something I don't know
but right now we're going to end the
vlog here
thank you for listening to my rant and
above everything else peace unity be
there for each other love your fellow
humans I cannot stress that enough even
if you're upset about the election
America's and the world is trembling a
little bit we have to stick together
unity be there for the people accept
people for who they are everyone is a
human and everyone deserves to be
treated as such and with that bow if you
like it subscribe if you like it
subscribe so I saw this cool thing has
lines around it
so then I climbed line now I'm on top of
this lion is he killed from walking dead
we can clear this line I'm on top of it
and walk a lot I'm pretty terrified I
don't know how I'm getting down this is
really super slippery and my dad held me
up here and now I feel like I've to live
up here and I have to like make my
videos from up here because I don't know
how I'm going down so I'm just basically
that person that's like
well I climbed a lion and I can't get
down
