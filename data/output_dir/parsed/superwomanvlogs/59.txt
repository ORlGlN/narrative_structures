thank you hi Billy Weiss is the story of
your life okay you're so full of crap
this is the do like I haven't done this
in so long it's like a one-time having
you not here I want everyone to see that
Lilly is walking right now with no shoes
holding a whole pile of Internet I feel
something real quicker I get this
question a lot that's like what kind of
legacy do you want to leave behind in
life and was like such a deep complex
question but today a lot of clarity for
me because I realized that legacy I want
to leave behind and I realized that
because it's watching WB Raw today have
so many colored wrestlers so many Samoan
wrestling I know Dwayne is responsible
for a lot of people getting into the WWE
and being successful in the dub W and
that is such a great legacy he's
inspired so many people and paved a path
that is a legacy people should have and
even like my life is so crazy because
growing up as you know I was obsessed
the rest thing I'm still a huge fan I
like Stephanie with my nose huge fan of
hers and I just like texted her being
like thank you so much W I take such
great care of me I'm just really
grateful for life and I just know the
legacy I want to leave behind because I
know Steph is also responsible for
amount of diversity we have an amount of
representation that's in the WV youth
like women wrestlers and all that I'm
like that's an effing legacy like don't
get it twisted the moral of the story is
money numerix Awards all that stuff it's
gonna go away
you're legacies gotta be how many people
have you left behind the world that are
like yo I'm here doing what I'm doing an
empowered kind of this person named this
and that's why I am going to now change
the world in my unique way that is sick
that is a legacy oh my god I'm so
inspired all right
you don't think every time goalies
wrestling events like it must feel so
cool do those flip through those moves
