last night I was a hot mess I'm sorry I
fell asleep after a Raptors game I was
so tired because I got such little sleep
the night before and I remember what I
said oh wow so much chance of falling
but it is morning time I believe I've
fixed my sleep schedule though because I
woke up at like 10:30 that's pretty cool

hands today is Bollywood dance Canada

say about this the person who made that
comment I talked about the other day
Thomas again I'm not mad at you at all I
appreciate that you're respectfully
voicing your opinion and the last I want
to say about it is I think there's a
misunderstanding that things I talked
about my long getting paid for and
people think that I get I just genuinely
like something so like I'm not getting
paid to talk about oatmeal and I'm not
getting paid to open my beats you've
seen my beats in my log I know it's easy
to think all we have beats polypaint be
opening the speaker in my blog I did not
get paid for it it's been in my blog
sitting in the background forever I
finally opened it not getting paid by
Game of Thrones so just remember that
youtubers genuinely like things
sometimes like we don't get paid if I
love paid for liking everything I'm
