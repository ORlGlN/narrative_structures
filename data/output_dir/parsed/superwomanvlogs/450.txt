y'all ready to go to an Indian wedding
reception
what's going on the time is 1:30 I woke
up like an hour ago I've been in bed
doing work dealing with some chaos and I
cannot wait until this chaos is done so
I can tell you exactly what I would do
it cuz I'm like itching can be like oh
my god guess what I just did
guess what I have to do but I can't cuz
it's not out yet so today I'm going to
my friend's wedding reception he
actually does not know I'm coming but in
fact he was my first ever manager when I
live in Toronto before Superman really
popped up he was a manager and he
invited me to his wedding and I never
responded and I think he just assumed
that couldn't come because I don't live
here but that's why I stayed over the
weekend to go to his wedding reception
and the parents are going and chasing an
ocean in them are performing so it's
gonna be dope cuz all my friends are
gonna be there
and I usually miss all these things that
I get to be here so I'm like yeah yeah
yeah
first I gotta wash my hair and I'm
really excited to take you because I
don't think you've ever come to a
Punjabi wedding reception with me now if
you're never going to open W at a
reception that's a part of India that my
family's from Punjab and they rowdy
there's non-stop dancing drinks beebowen
everything is on fleek so I cannot wait
to take you it's gonna be dope first
let's say little braids tonight is going
to be the bomb the effort of that shot
though let's go wash the hair I look
like a crazy person it's much later and
I haven't washed my hair yet cuz I've
been doing with some casts but it's okay
cuz I just got a lot of work done also
The Walking Dead premiere is today and
I'm gonna miss it which means that this
evening I'm off to throw my phone out
the window because you already know Matt
spoiler alerts are gonna go down and I'm
not about that life
I'm not trying to live that life I'm not
trying to know who dies I'm trying to
watch that ish and like I'm just I can I
can if I cuz there was a game of Thrones
episode 1 so I didn't watch it away
online and it completely was spoiled so
I just can't I'm I've got a my a I'm
sorry I'm sorry these are my priorities
I look like a lion hello there I'm
coloring again I'm waiting for my hair
makeup artist to arrive they should be
like five minutes away so I just
realized I can give you a little bit of
information into what I've been
stressing about remember that shoot I
did for Halloween with all those people
long story short and not
into detail it didn't turn out the way I
wanted to turn out and it was just
different from what I had envisioned in
my mind and that video is one I've been
wanting to do for years and I just
cannot release it without being
absolutely happy about it
so what does someone do when they're
crazy like me and they're not happy with
the video take this take a guess
you reshoot it I am going to reshoot the
entire video which means fourteen hours
I'm gonna do with my own resources now
so all the money I've ever made 14 hours
begging the entire cast and crew to do
it again and donate their time again to
me is what I am trying to do but the
most part everyone has been so super
supportive and been like yo yeah I guess
I think that's a good thing about
working with creators is they're like yo
you don't like the way it is yeah do the
N and the ones that are able to be free
have made themselves free again for me
and forever grateful but basically
that's what I'm doing in an extremely
short amount of time I'm going to remake
an incredibly difficult video why
because of thy mother effing boss and
that's what a boss would do well if you
excuse me I need to finish coloring the
snowflake blend Studios my Toronto hair
makeup artists have saved my life
because I don't have time to go pick up
the alpha mama and if you can't for me
so above and beyond their job that is
not their job but this is the outfit I
feel like it's kind of heavy side the
fashions holding it down so stop falling
this is what I'm gonna wear I'm very
excited about it I need to work before I
do my hair makeup though because there's
no way I can put it on after and I no
have to wear a bra with it
then soon over the whole no through a
lot so my mom put this on the table
every time they come because she just
cannot stand here spring it anywhere
