sleep or sleep were our tower
I'm in so much pain don't lie down
though they don't don't don't you know
you have to leave in two minutes don't
lie down Lily don't don't
oh my god the jet lag was too real
yesterday I went to bed at four four
o'clock at five o'clock five six o'clock
I was just lying in bed I could not fall
asleep because I was on Singapore time I
woke up in the middle of the night like
6:00 6:30 made myself something to eat
and I just want to point out right now
okay I just want to point out right now
I had nothing to eat in my place and so
I was like you know what I'm gonna have
a Nutella sandwich I go into the
cupboard looking for Nutella obviously
freaking humble or chase or someone
finish the Nutella didn't replace it or
I'm blind and I didn't see it either way
I had no Nutella so I'm like super
annoyed right now I'm like I just wanted
to tell her horde hopes of eating in
hopes of falling asleep I was so tired
and then I remembered that team super
Singapore aka love Isha when I was
leaving Singapore in the airport she
greeted me and she's like hey here's a
pack of 12 portable and Nutella things
I'm not sure if you'll take it on the
plane but just as a parting gift I did
take it on the plane I did bring it and
last night when I was starving all I had
to eat was that Nutella so shoutouts
everyone tweet team super super
Singapore Lanisha you done saved my life
you small you royal expect that I
respect that okay I already had a call
this morning and I did in bed and I was
dying and now I breakfast and now I'm
gonna go check out some houses that I'm
in condos that I may potentially move
into I'm so tired but it's okay because
tiredness doesn't mean unhappiness
having missed rygaard we're gonna seven
minute not go okay I think I might might
have
to place I really like picture of Bob
Marley over there on the wall as a sign
mushroom so go check places but I have a
pretty good feeling about this place
so get this I'm with my amazing realtor
who's a phenomenal and sweet and lovely
and I'm like joking around I'm like yeah
you know my boyfriend she was your
boyfriend I'm like oh you're doing she's
like was doing like drugs and she had
this face and I'm like why washing his
face she believed me like she genuinely
believed that I was dating the rock and
was freaking and she's like oh like are
you dating like she bully I'm honored
and flattered that someone was like yeah
why would that not be like I totally
believed you Frank
thing I think I'm gonna make an offer on
the place I this is K this is this is me
buying a place my first ever place I
rent this thing I am strong I am so
overwhelmed with the adult mess of this
entire situation because it's nice like
I walked in and I had a feeling still
more - I walked into this place I was
like oh this is it was really it's
really nice the one thing that's a
teaser is the office is a little bit
small it's still completely functional
but it's a teensy bit small but this is
like it's like buying it's like good you
know it's I'm feeling sort of away now
my mom's not here to help me with this
decision
no one's here to help me make the
decision so I'm like oh my god I got a
face to my mom right now and I'm sick oh
my god I don't know but the place I'm
thinking about making an offer if I
shouldn't get excited cuz my offer can
get rejected but like if I ever decided
to make an offer but like there's a
potential for a hot tub on the roof and
like a Cosmo in my hand and a hot tub
when I need to take a break what do you
mean okay okay so I show my mom the
place that my mom is giving me the
blessing to make the offer
okay okay
jungle jungle the lion sleeps tonight oh
I don't know why I have random songs my
head all day long everyone's wasn't wife
sing that song I'm like I don't know
I am procrastinating I am basically when
I go back to trial at the end of this
month I am going to host I know if I
told you this might host an event with
my family and friends aimed towards girl
up it's not gonna be professional event
it's only a personal event with my
family and friends only the females just
basically discussing ways we can spread
girl love and talking about women's
issues because I figure I talk about the
stuff around the world and charity
starts at home I would love to have a
discussion with my friends and family
and kind of tell them what my
experiences of going to Kenya meeting
Malala Malala doing all these cool
things and try to spark some positive
change in the world so I am just playing
that right now I should be reading my
book that's why I should be doing I'm
going to start on that just Justin I
just now I also officially put in the
offer for the house too much like I had
to call my mom I was like mom mom I'm
freaking out she's like can you shut the
F up you chicken and I was like oh my
god I can't but I might I don't know I
just I am going to make is this is kind
of like jumping a bit because I could
not get it but I wouldn't miss tilly
with this to this apartment this lily
pad means so much to me so the first
time I ever went away from home into
this apartment like I can't bear the
thought of leaving it but I don't want
to pay rent for my whole life and so the
main concern really is where will the
unicorn go that's the main concern more
than anything else really so so I'm
moving on to figure that out I'm just
saying great I'm working on this book
right now my body just remember that I
only got four hours of sleep last night
I forgot about that I feels like so long
ago but I only got four hours of sleep
maybe you unless three and a half maybe
but I haven't done nearly as much work
as I need to do so that's my
if I just lie on the floor if he's
hanging right I'm falling off my chair
no no I fell asleep on the floor I said
I was buying too but I didn't I'm good I
fasted my arms asleep damn it no no no
no we say golden how I'll wake up really
early cuz it's so early right now what
time is in Singapore why is this
happening to me usually jet like never
gets to me usually I'm so able to like
do my thing what's the making sense
he's 119 in Singapore so it's not even
times I was just setting getting sleep
ah oh hey I'm dying I'm gonna have to go
to sleep and hope that I wake up are
like 5:00 a.m. really early because I'm
going to sleep right now and not be mad
at myself but you know what I'm kinda
mad myself I kind of procrastinate it I
think the whole house thing threw me off
track and I was like excited and I'm
talking to my mom I'm talking to my
friends and it wasn't as productive or I
should have been today but I'm gonna
give myself a pass because an exciting
thing happened and it's a
once-in-a-lifetime thing playing an
offering for your first house so I'm
sorry I sound like death
you don't used to sitting somebody gets
hit by a wave of sleep in his lips I
feel like I feel like I haven't slept
forever
some girl asleep and then yeah I'm not
gonna go to the toilet I'm just I'm just
gonna go to sleep I'm sorry to end the
