schedule got shifted which allows me to
go back to LA and actually have a little
more than a week
of downtown when I say downtime I still
mean video shoots every single day from

initially that I was going to go back in
like three days later I was going to do
a massive travel again but it is
changing I'm so excited about it you're
really excited about I mean I love tour

something as simple as like making my
breakfast every morning really sets a
precedence my day

eating like crap because in that hotel
just eating margarita pizza and pasta
and I'm just so happy to have a routine
again and finalize my health unroll my
carpet god dammit it's been 84 years I'm
just really excited and I have so many
video ideas that I thought about during
tours and I'm excited to like produce

just the course to kind of think of
something for my hotel room but like
videos that I think are fun after like
talking to Will Smith's and like just
getting advice from like I didn't care I
used to be the semi ruler you recently I
went to this funk and I watch Ryan IGAs
video recently Tori talks but it was
like getting caught up on views because
everyone uses click bass enticing titles
and I don't want to do like I'm not
judging anyone that does it you should
everyone could do their own but I don't
excite me I'm like I don't want to have
to do challenges and freaking put stupid
crap of my thumbnail and you know like
do things like that too just because I
care about views I don't care I don't
care if I get less you don't want to
make content I believe in them that I
frigging have fun doing and that's what
I'm excited to do when I get back making
videos that I'm excited to make ah can
