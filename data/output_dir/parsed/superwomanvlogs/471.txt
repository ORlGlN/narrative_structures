how we as sisters can spread more girl

party and I get drunk and eat junk food
I can do those things but also spread
some girl love I know I just want to do
it more meaningful and everyone's really
excited all the girls like oh my god

just be a good vibe good energy event
where us girls can like get together and
talk about experiences and discuss
things then we can like jam to some girl

a party after the only guy that's
allowed is Kyle other than that it's all
