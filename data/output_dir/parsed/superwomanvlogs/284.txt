can and I'm leaving you good morning is
way too early o'clock I woke up at 6:00
I got huge half hours asleep story about
goddamn life I could've went to sleep
earlier but uh still chasing motion
because I miss him so goddamn much we
are heading to the attitude today's
mission we gotta fly to Seattle the
five-hour flight almost threw up on this
place and get there maybe I forgot home
the world is my oyster we'll see I gotta
pick up my outfit practice my show again
due to performance me angry people try
and get sleep to fly to LA the next day
as well and figure out when the half of
making my Monday video I missed Thursday
video and I was very sad about it and I
don't have any money either so we don't
see what's going to happen but aside
from all of that we're going to maximize
our sleep why you smiling I'm very
embarrassed I'm vlogging publicly I was
looking at my embarrassing do I
embarrass with you I'd like to take a
look at the chicks okay when the car
arrived I did do Carl right at 6:00 I
will go by six click on the car like 604
lat look so good
I gotta cater Canada commune collective
interest of the letters again so credit
where credit is due
Air Canada you redeemed yourself - I do
I do that at the end of every well I
know where didn't think I need something
to include a clip and so I was like
literally as soon as I ended that last
clip they announced our plane al-ansari
we left on the plane too early we
haven't had a secure second everyone
think it also played five month to come
back on it like Canada you were soaked
so you could talk those all right take
two fresh your chug on this place do I
get some sleep I'm so tired very comfy
when your hotel is blessed when it's
blessed when your hotel is blessed so
yeah I know I am in you right now it's
really exciting show because conference
also here is giving super super fun but
here's a pluggable or some food the time
is 149 and actually that 4:30 so I'm
using food and take another nap also a
massage book for ten look at me taking
care of myself before we get started
here I want to talk about something real
quick I've talked about before I'm
talking about it again it's on my mind
in the last video I always when you're
bad at confrontation I was just happy I
think so buddy and so with comments like
so happy the old superwoman is back
shooting in hotel rooms no extras in
their videos yeah and I'm like well
there were a lot of extras in the videos
that ago but then like people like yeah
you always change these videos this
makes me sad kind them from straight up
did I know what y'all want y'all want
the background with the quotes y'all
want me to just rent y'all don't want to
be produced I understand and I get and I
do try my best to do that from time to
time with rants in the hotel room with
my parents racnoss stuff but I've said
this before as a human
humans have to evolve there's only so
many visit I made hundreds of videos
that are rants and I will continue to do
them so for me it's exciting to do skits
kind is more fun I can be around people
I don't have to shoot all by myself
and I know like you are used to be using
a tripod and I have we will shoot my
videos but I'll go crazy if I have to do
that because I have so many other things
on my schedule and I don't want to start
making less videos and so one of my two
videos a week so I don't know where I'm
going with this I just want to let you
know again why sometimes my things are
more producers not just me doing a rant
in front of a wall because my ideas are
getting
bigger than that were like oh I don't
want to just go around I want to rap
with and also do the skit portion like
you know fun evolve as a person so
football to are sticking around I
appreciate it I've said time and time
again why I can't do the quote wall like
legality wise is a nightmare
but maybe I'll come up with a way to
like compromise and find royalty free
ones or something I don't know but I do
hear your comment I hope you still like
my videos I might have to do a hotel
round today because I believe in
tomorrow's I don't know but thank you
