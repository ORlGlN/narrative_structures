soft game a hundred good morning the
time is 10:30 I woke up about 45 minutes
ago I am headed to a fitting I have for
a shoot I have tomorrow but you can't
tell you about yet and close my
underwear drawer here which I can't talk
about yet but it's gonna be really
exciting today I also have a test drive
for a car I'm thinking about buying it
I'll tell you more about this is my all
to do and indeed this sweater some
tights and throw on some kicks and like
I'm oh my god the fitting going great
but also look who's here
ice white came bearing gifts and the
first one okay you guys are just now
you're gonna believe what's going on
here so the first one is a frame with
hanging Polaroids from like a TTY this
is my first ever show and spike was
scooping in the back and took pictures
and these are all the pictures she took
in there hanging in this frame and it's
gorgeous and then favorite one cuz she
looks like such a boss this one so what
this one look at her stance and
everything I got a good amount of
cleavage and everything's good I like it
are you ready for this OMG so I said I
want to do these are so long and I'm so
impressed that's why crew member she got
me my logo as I rig
and I've been wanting to do this forever
because I'm like I really need to get my
Logan ring and look it's if this is the
ring this is the this is this this is
the ring this is it we're married now
this is this is the thing oh my god this
is the best ever I'm gonna rant about
this for the rest of the vlog the
prayers of boom boom just had my quinoa
salad I'm so ecstatic about this like
let us take a moment like come on I'm
currently wearing the other one on the
other hand right now but this is gonna
be the one this is it fits perfect it's
just I'm so happy about it I am headed
after Lisa's vlog to test drive a car
let's talk about real quick I don't know
anything about cars disclaimer
disclaimer I just want a balance between
a functional affordable car and why I
initially started with wanting a balance
of having a functional affordable car by
having it to be like a little bit nice
you know I do mean like I work really
hard I don't need like a super balling
card because you know me I'm like Hulu
Houten's the Chipotle old everyday but I
didn't want something decently nice to
like my first car I worked really hard I
want to cut you know enjoy enjoy it a
little bit so I was doing a lot of
researches so many people suggested this
car to me and here's my thoughts on it
before we give this test truck
it is a Tesla now if you don't know
anything about cars like me just let an
electric car it is a cool car like it's
a new-age cool car it's young it's hip
it is completely electric which means
it's very good for the environment and
you get certain perks like you get to
drive in the diamond lane like you know
the more than one person Lane you get to
park in certain areas and I was like
really attracted to that being like dude
if I'm gonna get a car I might as well
get one that would like help save the
planet a little bit I love that I love
that it is a little something it can be
a little bit of a pricier side um so if
doing so much research I was like
honestly I don't know how comfortable I
feel like what if the electric thing is
like gonna stress me at least if I run
out of gas I know I could always get
more gas and I really like I don't know
maybe it's like a pretty big change but
gas electric car knows it stressed about
it so I kinda was like no I'm not gonna
get it I'm gonna look at something else
and then what my friend is like why
don't you just test drive
and then you'll be able to decide so I
went to test-drive a Tesla and I have a
feeling I'm gonna friggin love it but
yeah so that's we're gonna go to her and
I'm gonna test her out as well
never thought I'd say those words but
that's what's happening this car is so
freakin cool
oh my god man is so freaking cool I was
gonna test drive I couldn't vlog
obviously while driving the car parked
itself it parallel parked between two
cars by itself good mood I'm at cause in
this car right now
has no central thing as well so go way
back it's very cool it's very cool BRR
it's cold today it's cold today let's go
through a test that is freaking amazing
I talked about in a second let me into
my apartment okay
my car's dope I'm gonna think on that
one a little bit it was just so smooth
it turned on and I you know it was on
it's just like absolutely silence and
absolutely silent vehicle feels like a
hoverboard
it's very cool and it's super kind of
thing on that and do some research
because it is quite pricey like I said
but it's so environmentally friendly as
well so it's like ah good person
expensive and not good person Blake and
saving the planet
it is video today so I made a video it
was so cold outside look I need to
snuggle in something warm for a few
minutes and hopefully it doesn't end up
in a 10 hour nap standby you already
know you already know what happened 7:30
every time I go to sleep I wake up my
throat is so extremely dry hmm let's
make a video I shouldn't lie down
because my brain is like mush right now
I'm trying so hard as 8:15 I actually
just ordered a salad from veggie girl
cuz I don't want to do tofu ghen and
hopefully that food will give me some
brain power cuz right now I'm like what
the YouTube video I'm thinking about
doing up my parents react because they
haven't done that
long time and a lot of you been asking
for it so thinking about that but yeah
we're moving a bit slow I'm sorry so
much record it is 1038 p.m. which is
quite late sorry I have another huge
creative block like I couldn't do it but
the vision I came up with this pretty
relatable it is about when people borrow
your phone the stress that anxiety you
go through somewhat to shoot this
tomorrow my pickup is at 9:45 I have a
shoot tomorrow
something a TT UI movie related so I
don't want to go to sleep too late but
the good thing is my hair and makeup
will be getting done so I can just leave
my house looking like you know I just
felt confident side but I'm gonna shoot
this and yeah go pursue you is always so
hot I'm like naked it's always so hot
after a recorded video because these
lights are so hot but I'm done recording
my edit this is the time is 1116 and I
feel I could be done editing by like 12
45 minutes I think I probably take like
20 minutes to upload by one and should
go to bed one wake up at like 9:15
that's not bad I'm okay with that I'm
okay with that
there's get work done editing 12 on the
dot like on the dot a party done a party
done apatit
alright so I'm gonna head to bed with
this video everyone seems to like it
when this is really relatable makes me
happy I had the best compliment I
receive on my videos is that oh my god
this is so relatable I like that feeling
that leg drives me that motivates me
when people say I can relate to this
because it's like a fascinating thing
we're all different humans but like have
these same experiences I don't know that
really attracts me to what I do so
that's really dope I'm gonna head to bed
I might watch an episode of American
Horror Story I was like my treat booth
Anaka lie so much of me didn't want to
record a video bros like he gotta do it
also I FaceTime d-trix today because I
was as I mentioned you I was so
impressed that he had a shooter when he
shot with me and I was asking him just
about the whole process so I feel like
I'm going to hire a shooter because a
lot of video ideas from like years and
years ago I have a bank of video ideas
that I can never do because I don't the
shooter
there's obviously only so much I can do
on my tripod
you've been doing like the skits with
the family characters are like really
difficult on tripod somehow so I feel
like if I hire shooter it's a good
investment
to make a lot of my ideas come to life
that I haven't been able to do on my own
even if it's like just my rants but
having like little pieces that are like
skits in between and stuff so that's the
thing I'm thinking about which I'm
excited about I hope it works out
also let's just have a more detailed
look at the ring that I'm in love with
it's just so she didn't know my ring
size she guessed and it fits perfectly
and I'm like obviously fits perfectly
it's meant to be it's like Thor and his
hammer it's just like meant to be you
know what I mean so I'm really happy
about that today was a great day I
wasn't as productive as I wanted to be
because I did take that random nap and I
didn't I did too all my emails I
released a vlog or at least a video I
test all the Tesla I one for fitting
this morning so a lot of things didn't
happen but not respectives I wanted to
be completely you know but yeah I'm
gonna head to bed I hope you have a
stupendous great wonderful day and oh
one more thing I forgot to tell you so
when I was leaving the Tesla place the
guy gave me an exclusive offer to
test-drive a Tesla for 24 hours which
means I can keep the car for 24 hours so
I might test drive for 24 hours just to
see if I really like it so it this is a
conversation up for a different day but
I'm still on the fence I still want to
test drive other cars I'm still on the
fence but I'm gonna shut up because I
keep saying where to sleep and I keep
talking so that's what's happening I
hope you had a stupendous wonderful
inspirational - thank you so much for
taking X amount of minutes health for
many minutes it says to watch my vlog
and letting me be part of your day I
really appreciate it and I hope you're
smiling look if you like it subscribe if
you like it subscribe don't like it

also heading to interview it is another
rainy day in LA so I feel shutting down
and just lying down but I did that
yesterday so I can't do it again
I'm feeling a lot better I don't feel
sick in the current moment we'll see
what happens when I get back and I'm
here to an interview for a talk stupid I
as a Canadian I have very little idea
