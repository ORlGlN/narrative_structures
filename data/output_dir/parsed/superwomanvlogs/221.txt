as long as you loving me down now down
imma keep holding me loving you mess it
up what's cookin good-lookin good
morning I woke up at about also swing by
10:30 and then I kinda go but I gotta
have 11:15 anyway never working in bed
because today we have a busy day ahead
of us but I have no doubt we will
conjure up all the hustling power and
get it up here is the mission for today
you we're gonna record a bunch of stuff
we're going to record rant one video one
and video - we're going to shoot three
separate videos today that's what's
gonna happen after that inevitably which
will be 84 years later we're gonna write
script one and script - because I have
two video shoots tomorrow as well and
then before I go to sleep I have to
figure out my release my content release
schedule so I know which videos are
happening when aside from all of that
we're gonna have fun because you know
our lives are awesome first on my makeup
let's check up on Derek so I can give
them some direction and so what the hell
we're shooting because my crew so dope
they know they just like that when they
arrived Aaron okay so far today Mario
needs to look for setups one of the
restaurants in tech 1 1 will be like us
working type 1 so 2 people are computers
one will be like someone doing my hair
and another one can be like sitting on a
sofa I always leave both people to be in
the same frame same time so no
over-the-shoulder stuff unless you want
to do three cameras which I'm sure you
do
it's not two of you right no no you
interact it's one brown person and one
white right I remember in case you
didn't know one brown person and one
what why you look even whiter in this
egg I think I look the same colors you
I'm about to sing to you aren't you
supposed to be good at color correction
so a little trick I'm learning we're
making like to do this is back today you
know I was like alright cast number one
video shoot and I feel so discouraged
but at the end of the day but we have
one thing done not realize my video
shoot is 3 videos and 7 hours long so
valve tip we're making it to do list
don't clump so many tasks you almost
died do you know this don't clump
so many tasks together if it's a video
shoot put video on video - or if you're
doing some major assignment put outlined
intro paragraph whatever you need to do
don't give yourself such a hard time and
make it to-do list that's actually
achievable
kind of I always make sure I put one or
two things I know I can achieve but I
like to challenge myself
and do some makeup makeup like so to
kiss the Frog not eat the frog so I
don't wear something in my eyes of my
life and sometimes I carry my eyelashes
are not like this or like this into a
pupil makeup all done I hear some people
imitating me in this room this is what
they do when they're trying to set the
frame for me Tony it's been so long

frame I'd love to see it I'd love to see

shooting two and a half video so before
I work on my scripts for tomorrow I am
going to watch the Lego Batman movie

schedule inspiration for today that is
here this year we are going to watch
this movie as a figurehead as long as

useless don't know I just braided a
bunch of my hair during the movie while
I was watching yourself yeah well you

but I was more confused about how your
hair and get bridge then you wonder what
happened to Batman I feel like you

and I'll go to bed right now so if I
wake up 10 hours from now four hours
before I actually start shooting a video
for a half hours so I know what the
ideas are already I just haven't
scripted them out so thoroughly and
formatted them sort of process its idea
point form notes write out sentences and
then script and so I'm pretty like
halfway through that process so i'ma
give myself the past today
two and a half video a shot watched lego
movie was so inspiring because I was
watching am i comfortably good job to a
girl Heather did that so it's good to
gain some inspiration and all the time
so it's been cut myself some slack I'm
