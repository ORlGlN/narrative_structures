in a match but he's still there besides
all that growing up wrestling was like
my go-to thing it was my biggest
obsession I was such a fan posters were
all over my room and he used to like
help me escape from all the other
problems of growing up and so it really
means a lot to me and I'm so excited to
go because it's like so for lack of a
better term electrifying the energy and
the fans and the state of and humble
tonight I've related their birth trying
to make a record for Russell mania so
the record is 93 thousand and they have
a hundred thousand tickets all today 100
thousand tickets on the stadium that's
so exciting and I've also had will talk
to myself I'm like okay you know me I'm
a workaholic I try to turn everything
into working like oh I'm gonna try to
you know do this and do that no I'm
gonna enjoy a personal vlog but whatever
happens organically happens I'm not
gonna prep for anything to happen I just
want to go and enjoy and like relive my
childhood right now that's the fun that
is going on let me show you some next
thing hold up watch you all take a look
at this you might be wondering what is
this is this Tinker Bell's effin casket
what why's what it's shampoo and I'm
just like cute that's cute I used four
of these and I still can wash all my
hair and like the consistency of it is
disgusting it reminds me of some
unpleasant bodily fluids but it's just
oh come on hotels like you need to come
on just come on come on that wouldn't be
enough to forget shampoo my arm hairs
when I was good like straight up okay so
the whole cast of like there's a kickoff
pre-show we didn't know about I think
it's starting to hurt each other or
something like that so now way to ease
quick as possible go back to the hotel
get ready to responsible
head over where we can deep-dish pizza
gonna be yummy all right we're headed to
Wrestlemania
just bring it you know what's up what's
up how many exciting extremely in the
history of my entire life every time
I've ever been told my tickets are at
will-call it's always a disaster without
fail ovo fest waiting everything will
call is always a disaster every time I
give my name to like it's not it's not
there I'm like check again start there
check out I'll call some people email
some people that have been to the sounds
like oh yes we found the tickets the
show already started five minutes ago
I'm standing outside one for my tickets
that someone is confirmed I have but
they're running them up so grateful
those tickets away for everything but
the show is starting and I don't want to
miss it
god damn it I'm trying to figure out if
I should distracted by saying things or
not say anything because I know it's
even I'm not super upset I'm just like
I'm still very grateful for this I'm
excited to go but I'm just like I mean I
got stuck with 45 minutes now for
tickets that they know I have someone is
bringing them to the will call it was
like
on a scale from one to ten how annoyed
is no I will not be annoyed because
Duane's at this event and I support him
and ride or die so I'm not annoying I'm
just I wish I was missing with it but it
is to be honest extremely unnecessary
because if the ticket is there why can't
it just print them where they say yeah

Shaquille O'Neal was named awesome
I already said that yeah but obviously
my friend my homie Dwayne curled it uh
yet to leave you have places to go after
the shows we couldn't mean up until
Kennedy mad the reason I came here to
support him I think turned into a
different person when I see Dwayne
entertaining I just so proud I think
he's the best entertainer in the world
he's such an enchanter he's so funny he
is like literally electrifying when he's
in a ring on a stage I'm just so friggin
proud of him
was so dope to see him did a match he
was like an honor to see him wrestle but
third time at a Wrestlemania I just feel
like I love I love that man obviously I
love that man he's just don't know he
pulled up his pants and a shirt whatever
no big deal no big deal won't be till we
can keep this PG right now so we're not
gonna go into the deep thoughts and
feelings I'm not gonna make me choke I
