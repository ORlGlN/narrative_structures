made it very clear like this is not a
session for you to ask me for a retweet
or follow no I'm not above you wanna be
your friend like tell me about yourself

then responding with them telling people
go tweet other people that are using the
hashtag team super family time and

right now I have to change environments
I'm gonna have to figure out my room and
my computer upstairs
I don't know I have to so that's what's
happening did you feel that there's no
energy bro all right so I'm packed half
my suitcase the laundry pile I got a
donate pile going on over there
I refold and all these clothes I take
this in these clothes
like full baskets of clothes will not
fit in my double-decker closet and I use
another clause like that I know it
sounds really ungrateful but like I have
way too many things I have way too much
of everything these are the teddy bears
and I haven't even finished unpacking
like that I need to somehow sit on my
bed and I haven't gone do like I have a
whole thing for Birmingham whole thing
from good buying a whole thing from like
let me just show you the situation like
because I don't like throwing away the
things you guys give me I'm not gonna
lie I do donate some if I get doubles in
triples of things but like look unopened
unopened all like this is it's out of
control
like this is what I like I can't I need
to like move because I need to like to
filter through everything I need darling
stuff I need to move to more functional
space because look the part of doing
lads so many hats so like put them up
here in addition to all the ones that
we're here I said I was gonna give away
a lot of my stuff that's what I think
has happened but like it's gonna take a
long time to go through everything so
when I move tentatively hopefully
November I need to like do something
about this this is out of control either
way now I need to get to the actual
workspace area now that I can see my
floor okay so this is my progress got
some basic teddy bears there put some
over there for now I decided not to go
my computer but to my laptop here
instead I fixed my desk it's a bit of a
you know workable area this right here I
don't know what to do with that
I'm nor to do with that and not to do
with that but I don't know focus on
right now is bad and working because
I've cleaned enough for one day and
there's no place for anything else
ah congratulations we're getting closer
today because you're seeing that I'm
bidding my name is Lisa and I have a
problem I am both a Shopaholic and I am
a hoarder of things and I don't want to
throw away anything people gave me it's
not only that I do throw away things
it's like you know it is you all
spoiling me that's what all of this is
like my P o box is like the core I just
did like you all spoil me
that's that's that's the blessed problem
here we go change of environment got my
little setup right here guys all that
stuff I didn't even tell you that aside
from all this stuff actually put two
loads of laundry and so like two baskets
will be added this okay we're just
talking about this is stressing me up
I'm gonna some work done why do I always
do this why don't we the time was not
overtime it's 1:00 a.m. I got a little
bit of work done and now I have a really
big migraine what else didn't you so I
just put some tiger balm and take
appointments on my shoulders I took some
medicine get migraines with my shoulders
hold all my tension stress is generally
my shoulders and neck hurt a lot and
then my head hurts
that's why I get massages all done but
I'm gonna lie down for a bit I might do
some more work might fall asleep not
really sure um I also want to talk to
you guys about something
so a lot of people when they watch
yesterday's vlog we're kind of like why
moving to LA why boom Kelly especially
all my fellow Canadians and Torontonians
like don't move let's talk about that
for a second I have for a long time
wanting to move to LA it has nothing to
do with me not liking Toronto if you
know anything about me I have a song
called I've yeah guy I love Toronto I
was born and raised here well in the
surrounding area and I'm a proud Kron
Tony and that will never change but I
mean over the last couple years I have
gone back and forth to LA all the work I
do is I'm a in LA all the collaborations
I do in LA it's just it's gotten to a
point where I have to progress forward
in life I have to move to LA I mean I
missed so many opportunities not being
there and I'm just so excluded from
everything I do like all the other
creators are there
WME is there the agency I'm signed to
collect it was there that network I'm
signed to Sarah is there so you know and
for a long time I didn't accept that I
had to move because I've never lived
away from home I mean I'm barely ever
home I travel anyways but like I've
never lived with my parents I've never
lived away from home then I told myself
you know what every great thing I've
ever achieved has been because I've
stepped out of my comfort zone and this
is just another one of those things
where I'm step out of my comfort zone
and hopefully great things will come of
it but just know that when it happens
I'm gonna be horrified I'm gonna be
scared I'm gonna definitely need all of
your support and it's not like me
ditching Canada or Toronto I'm gonna
come back all the time all my family's
here
my closest friends are here and I will
reprimand or til the day I die I don't
even care I will be in LA rocking a
Raptors Jersey for life okay but just I
gotta do it it's time I mean the energy
there I will say the first time everyone
tell a within 20 minutes I knew I had to
live there the energy there everyone
they're so like-minded like the hustle
that I have everyone there has it plus
more so being in LA every time I'm there
I feel like automatic this will
encourage to work because everyone else
is working with a guard not that people
don't work hard here but lifestyles very
different here and the lifestyle I have
is just makes more sense in LA so that's
all um it's you getting nervous even
talking about it but I'm sure at some
point this year I will move to LA we
will move to LA collectively as a family
and I'm gonna be nervous as f but until
that day I'm gonna go to sleep cuz I'm a
migraine and my vision is blurring on my
left eye so if you liked it subscribe if
you like it would you mind okay three
insane
