i morning the time is very early o'clock
I have zero sleep o'clock and I am at
your morning I'm doing always but the
years the missions for today
one cloned I very crucial part of the
mission after F into G 1 G 2 into V 3
I got a go to the Indian consulate and
pick up my visa and then I go back to my
house officer outfit go to my house
crucial crucial take a nap go to my high
school and do two performances my score
then come back home take a nap and this
evening probably disagree the notion
because it's a birthday but aside from
all that like I said the goal is to not
die each other from bed um so far or
even me you just took my pause of course
she would just go for a bigger stage
where I'll get it
oh okay oh gosh go Bob
I feel any vinegar you need to get but
if you want a block I guess right here
and God he'll recognize my personal not
actually important source to experience
so special because they world
you're a bit EQ on CBC Radio 1 Sirius XM
159 I know this is a bit of an
exaggeration it seems like that these
days the universe is divided into two
camps people who don't know the lilies
thing is and those who can't believe you
don't know cool early saying it but when
I want to stage I can see people we have
to be in real time smiling to what I'm
actually saying sometimes crying I want
to say and that's really pretty
gotta say you know more unicorns I got
the big s you to the concert of India
because I just triggered by visa and
they told me yesterday we can do for one
year because we're going to five and it
took my bees into three months which
means three months has come back to
Toronto for the next order of business I
have in India but yesterday all the
staff one day creatures will be with the
kids but now when I'm like eh but
yesterday now no one's talked to me
that's how they roll everything's
concert of India fu back home back home
very very happy first first first first
I'm going to my room because I've missed
it so much my room my home my room huh
would like to apologize because the last
clip of me was not what I want to be in
life I was very upset and I was angry
and that's not what a boss does I think
I'm a little bit uh less tolerant
because I'm so sleep-deprived I'm a
little bit more on edge I don't want to
be entitled I'm very happy and blessed
to be able to travel around the world so
I do want to apologize our last clip
however I do want to calmly explain to
you the situation a to create awareness
and B to ask for help situation is you
know I like to do world tours and part
of the world tours India and I perform
in India three times now four times and
every single time I have to perform in
India and this is not to say anything
about people in India I love people
India having the best fans ever and this
is about the system and process of
traveling to India so whatever the
government officials have set up the
system essentially anytime I want to
perform in India I have to go to the
General Council of India in Toronto
because of a Canadian passport so I
applied to Toronto no or I coordinate
whenever I'm in with Toronto I go to the
office first of all there's a massive
line there I'm not complaining about
that you can come over the line fine
not only is every single person that
works there extremely rude and
unprofessional I've gotten yelled at
time and time again just for asking a
question or doing something basic there
but they will just make up their own
regulations left right and center and if
the four times I've gotten a visa
there's a business with us the price has
been different every single time because
the person just make
a price and tell it to me whatever it's
fine I have always gotten a one-year
visa okay and this time when I went in I
said hey is it possible for me to get a
two or five years visa because I have to
come back every year and do this
literally every year and every year I
travel there so this time to my surprise
I have a separate business visa section
I went there and the lady said in our
quote hey we don't know where you were
about our kids are big fans of you and
we're going to do whatever we can to
help you she was so nice and I was like
what a pleasant different experience not
that I want special treatment because
I'm super but it was just a pleasant
surprise that I wasn't having a rude
experience for one so she sent we can do
whatever we can to help you out we'll
try to get your 5-year visa and the day
I told I was not allowed to get a 5-year
visa because apparently my parents have
to give up their Indian passport and
they have to surrender even though
they're Canadian citizens and their
passwords like 30 years I don't get the
correlation between me and my parents
old passwords I'm not a miner I'm a
full-fledged adult but anyway she's like
we'll give you a one-year visa and says
then she's acting very nice to me and
says do you mind if I take a picture and
said of course we'll do that everyone's
very nice I take the pictures I go today
just got my visa and I look at it and it
says three months and I'm like hey my
visa here says three months the guys
like yeah that's what it is and I asked
the girl who there yesterday girls and
such and said hi you were there when she
said when your wisest three months to
make the phone conscious oh that's the
decision they made why did they make
that decision I was told one year that's
just a decision they made and I'm like
so you're going to make me in three
months fly back here again okay for this
all over again because it's not cheap as
hundreds of dollars just so you can make
money and make this is difficult a
fossil where yesterday when you wanted a
picture with me everyone is very very
nice and it's a single entry visa which
means that once I go there for tour even
within those three months I have to go
back to India for any business I have to
come back here and do this whole process
again it is the only country I travel to
that requires this in person difficult
visa situation so what I would like okay
because honestly I never want to have to
go back to that consulate again it is
literally hell on earth and if you know
anyone because I think the other day one
of the government officials tweeted at
me because their kid was a fan I'm
polite Lee asked me if you know anyone
in the government of India that you
could escalate this issue to and bring
it to their attention please tell them
to tweet me or reach out to me somehow
or tell me how to reach out to them
because I would love to just ask them
how to help me in the situation and
never have to go back there and get
yelled at and deal with us again because
I love Indiana
forming there but I just don't think I
can go through that process again and go
through that simply because I want to go
put on the show in India it is the most
absurd ridiculous just honest system
ever and it needs to be torn down and
that is what I'm asking of you so that
is my rent that is what it is if you
know anyone your parents on the
government if your relatives of
government please escalate this problem
to them tell them to tweet at me I have
a verified tab I will see it I will
reach out to them that is my humble
request to you I'm going to eat
sometimes turn chicken curry now let's
go all right we're headed to my high
school mom dad are coming too
I'm wearing the same outfit ever worn
before you're not gonna tell anyone it's
a brand new oldie we're down Bob
dad you're a tall phone back in my high
school with you and all the skills right
now I'm not gonna lie I am so tired and
I feel a huge weight on my chest because
a second a anxiety because I'm so so
tired and I know I need to sleep but I
have two more shows right now two in a
row and then I can go to sleep and it's
not an ideal situation for super product
I'm not promoting with but unfortunately
my schedule has lineups is late and we
don't go for that right now
it does matter how tired I am doesn't
matter what else is on my mind the
Indian consulate aspect if everything I
remember what it was like being in high
school and going to assembly and being
excited by some things and that's what I
wanted to finish kids I want to excite
them or to inspire them guys what's
going to happen to all know my old high
school babies and they're going to get
110 percent I don't give an ass to get
the negativity by the way I want to say
yesterday's wrong I think I was like so
stunned about the bestsellers list that
maybe I wasn't like very expressive but
I over the goddamn moving I'm so proud I
haven't even like digested it because it
was actually coming on Sunday so right
now I just feel like it's alive so I
could address it but sitting me sick
I don't want about your evolution
concern in a row back to mastery
piercing yes
let me introduce myself my name is Lily
with real and I wrote a book called
international hey I still mouth I'm
sorry what I did was both I was actually
thinking about curiosity love all the
things I learned and okay I remember so
vividly while writing this book a doing
one class I had and into right as a
class and if she German two uses of our
colleges as I've ever seen is that you
are the Midwest and was gently but
something one day and forbids what was
partially dedicated to the projected now
the high school and after you kind of
muscle with a very horrible day of all
my friends boat assembly I firmly
college I was almost laughter I just
every opportunity again and I happen to
stuff my house because I genuinely tried
to be a nice person
okay monumental moment monumental woman
first of all blah blah see blah blah so
I do not know this but when I was
writing my book I was writing it I had
this thought was like you know what I'm
only confident in my writing because
when I was in high school this was one
teacher my history teacher that always
used to say really you're such a good
writer and one day gonna write something
great and so in my brain I even sent an
email to my manager being like I have to
hunt down this teacher I don't know
where he is but I need to go and
surprise him give him a book he's gone
my school his name is exact akin to said
camel it's me this is you and he
encouraged me so much to write and a lot
of the writing and comets have came from
you and your feedbacks yes
safe yeah you're wonderful I taught me
history and I even remember you read my
essay out loud to the class and it was
great
say hi mr. Jackson I know this is
strange is the internet you're doing
this cream so I've been told not
something is about to happen right now I
just have so much anxiety because people
keep telling me things are about to
happen doesn't happen but something
happens what is going to happen it is
100 percent sure that you will leave you
at number one on our national nonfiction
bestseller wait love babies ha ha
important about you let me get it thank
you go Alfred where's my high school
everybody's ready for lunch with
presidents cards right here yeah and
then that way I was a rat and lots of
holes
I'm very old I lost Norfolk lost that
right when it is grade 9 my locker was
time has finally come for me to take a
nap right now I've been running on two
hours of sleeps for last two nights and
I wait asleep for so many hours and tell
this evening in this videotape I've
decided recently that I'm not going to
release a video I deserve tonight I was
beating myself up cuz I'm like I'm such
a good streak but my sanity and health
cannot be sacrificed and hangry to take
a nap and not do videos because I don't
have one bank so I was on apologize all
the negative vibes I've been exerting in
the vlog and even on Twitter and like
ranting and raving about the Indian
consulate I really think she's been
tired and I don't have the tolerance and
capacity to do what things as well as
usual I'm thrilled to be on to
bestsellers list I truly am I feel
almost ungrateful not basking in that
more and focusing on all these other
things which how I know my mind is tired
but I do want to apologize in case I'm
saying out negative vibes I'm not doing
it intentionally I'm trying to control
it and hopefully after the snap I'll be
way more rejuvenated but I'm gonna email
consulate now before I'm at because they
tweeted me and noid me even more but
it's all good because my baby Harvey
boss is number one bestseller in Canada
number two bestseller on New York Times
and not that nothing matter more like a
genuinely say neither of those things
you as good as the book being in your
hand but it's still really friggin cool

this nap I'm going to tell you how
grateful I am
