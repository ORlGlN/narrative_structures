about this guy right here
I would mainly part of the wrong Seyed
the beat of the song he's awesome good
food I also want to marry him but I
don't think he's interested
I'm a Lulla I'm 30% interested works for
me I mean I'll swing the rest of 70 um
look at all the stuff we got going on
here this is like 62 colorful this guy's
looking all cool
everybody looking all cool and we're
about to shoot and bangers videos right
now that's what's up that's what's up
that guys what's up y'all funk-defied up
in here mmm food on shooting I think
what they were really well I asked the
rock to Instagram what movie I'm just
have at the rock Instagram a picture of
me he reposted my picture I've tried to
be rather awkward to Wayne we're friends
now I find a beat him up it up he didn't
um it was a stressful shoot um I want to
kill you up many times many moments
throughout the shoot but it's okay
because it's fine I don't why did I
could we not learn to ever friends but I
can honestly tell them like I don't
think our communication was on point
today I thought we were lacking in the
communication of our usually we're on
the same page we're in a different book
in a different library like I said
before this I was in Rexdale eyebrows
over in Scarborough Public Library over
all the way over there haunted their
next book the only reason she didn't
kill me cuz you're gonna find something
to kill me what that's not you you did
some annoying things I did some annoying
things we annoyed each other I'm glad
you're Lipper know I did someone knowing
things but once I explained them to you
they won't be annoying cuz I'm right
okay no it was a little stressful too
did you think so again we this is a much
shorter timeline in comparison to let so
we have two things on a lot shorter time
period without sacrificing and we tell
you what this
I'll tell you what we did well then when
I'm not mad I'm just putting out to you
so I think humble sometimes doesn't
realize that for girls to get ready for
photoshoots significantly more like I
have to change my hair do my makeup he
had to change his turban and like his
clothes so when we do my hair like this
I missed a 2-0 so music are you ready
and I was going to the washroom I see
why diminish ah is it
are you ready come the shot I got one
more thing this was his face this was a
seis you know I was like this purchase
rolled his eyes
I love homie right now you call this a
hundred percent but I wasn't rolling my
eyes because you weren't ready
that's one of your eyes that what were
you really drawing my invisible
situation was happening I was rolling my
eyes because Lily takes time to get
ready and look good while we were
setting up and taking our time to make
the shot look good leave like compare
yup is that what I said is that what I
said no no no no no no no and under like
it's the thing I might I would actually
happen in a second what actually
happened was I said hey I just want to
make sure no one's slacking that we're
working at the pace we would work as if
we were interruption as I said and I and
how many times did I assure you that
nobody was liking okay but you just said
I said to hurry up I didn't say that
though she insinuated what I am saying
again is only this doesn't that's even
less than her and I stopped recording
now we can do some I'm gonna add it all
the parts where you talk and I make my
own part thank you my own owners do not
max I got the rock did you uh you didn't
do anything
the only ways I'm not mad is because hey
Duane you're doing okay you know I'll
come to him
okay you know how to come to a first of
all he is sir a rock to you sir okay
dumpin just call him not even not even
poets it it it guy anyways
k√ºbra April 16th out with this guy
ah live yeah this clip is three minutes
20 seconds I kind of represents like I
shoot today like 50 gigabytes right six
seconds
that's because humble can open his eyes
on open your eyes you do it though so
there's a hidden message that we want to
show you guys a already has all there's
nothing there though there's nothing
they don't know well what do we do
there's nothing there
what I would it would it would it look
at this my brother in his wanna scratch
my father I just knocked fo in my uber
and then realize when it was like over
you'd answer but what makes you say that
did you realize I look like this um I'm
so tired I'm gonna knock out we have a
24 hours for the 48 hours a few hours to
edit this video and really super 16
