airport is the walk to the airport in
the morning so we are headed to
Washington DC all of us Kollek an hour
of sleep and we're getting there so
early that we don't actually know we can
check into our hotel when we get there

right yesterday in the comments I was
like honestly Lilly's always complain
about being sleepy in her vlogs and
they're like being annoyed at me
hi we're on door humble talu yo we got
into a room on one end and we had to be
downstairs allotted for 3:45 a.m. so I
apologize if I continuously I'm sleepy
throughout my vlog but that's because
I'm sleepy or in certain situations
circumstance dog why I why yeah like yo
why you should making a pillow out of
the slashes and hyphens in the comment
section instead of telling me I complain
too much I know my thing isn't sleepy um
when - my back hurts - so I'll complain
about that see something else to come
into the new New Year will you guys

questioning how comfortable I think it's
so comfortable this is also a go reason

lovelies bought for me my silver shoes
black and I will put a hat on I might be
like really weird
I don't usually know if what I wear
looks nice but I just kind of wear it
because it makes me happy so yeah that's
what the do not disturb I always put do
not destroy in my hotel room because I
always have my personal belongings
everywhere and I don't want them to
steal of them or moved in
okay I'm lost
so I have learned about myself you're
also directionally challenged like even
when we're in the venue I get I get lost
like every day no matter where I am in a
building a hotel and a venue doesn't
matter and I discovered why I always
have the tendency to go right so if I
walk out of a room
I'll go right I walk out of anything
I'll go right even if I have to go left
my instinct is just to always go right
and I get lost everywhere I go

car well yeah what's up
