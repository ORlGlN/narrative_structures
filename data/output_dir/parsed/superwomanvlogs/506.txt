good morning pumpkin
it is actually afternoon I woke up at
around 1:30 because I went to bed so
super late
my stomach is okay so far okay I mean it
was a little bit up separate so far so
good so I'm just hoping fingers crossed
and I feel better today I just finished
writing a blog post I'll post an hour
and a half and today's book writing also
we've run out of toilet paper officially
because humble woke me up this morning
was like we need a roll of toilet paper
from your room so I just gave my last
roll we need some toilet paper with some
garbage bags all the basic necessities
why is there garbage everywhere I do not
know but we need to maybe do a
rejuvenation Saturday because the place
is a little bit dirty but that's going
on but I haven't done one of these miles
let's do one of these but you don't like
these I suggest you fast forward just a
couple seconds because I'm going to read
one and today's is Oh get centered I
feel like I need this you know when it
gets to be too much whatever it is I
close my eyes and return to my Center in
my Center I have the wisdom of sharing
and tranquility of mrs. favorite animal
unicorn holding a magical item wand
floating through space on a piece of
furniture magic carpet I love it about
being centered I try to be centered
every single day and it is so easier
said than done but it's important my its
employees important to also speak
English
but my way of being centered is it's
really simple in my day
throughout my days throughout my weeks
throughout my month all my life my
number one thing is I just want to be on
the same page as myself and I know that
sound like a very like weird sentence
but being on the same page yourself
means like you're connected with
yourself you know how you feel you know
why you're upset you know why you're
happy you know what you've got to do you
know what your mind heart are both
saying that's being on the same page
yourself and I try do that every day
because the last thing I want to do is
be fake to my own self I want to be my
own best friend so that what's going on
we're gonna buy some toilet paper and
garbage bags and be adults that we work
work work work working chases got onto
the photo shoot how most taking a shower
all good Tings a one out here ei mean
come
before moving out of my own I didn't
realize and now that I know I am shocked
and astonished at the amount of toilet
paper humans use like I always have to
buy toilet paper
are we just full of crap yeah also a
bunch of white toilet paper humbly know
what that means this calls for a montage
which one are you going to keep my body
clean you Roma clapping buy some toilet
paper and some Swiffer $61 regen my
weapon my battery with $100 bill wall
behind is three sixty one dollars good
toilet paper it's something I don't
understand the cost of it it's just like
it should be free you know even pipe it
is not my fault I can't control it
yeah me man I know yeah I'm gonna
comment you you're allowed to something
country's that yoga you sweating paper
y'all onto something I thought I heard
one who said if you got poo on your hand
you wouldn't wipe it off
oh my god are we done T I have reached a
new space of enlightenment I would like
to share with you and I think I just
learned this from so many people have
read I think I've met it part I think I
learned it partially from selena and
alicia keys to these people who have
inspired me after meeting them and this
is what it is for so long I kept telling
myself like promote what you love don't
bash what you hate and I totally
completely agree with that store I won't
bash things if I don't agree with them
but sometimes it is healthy and
essential to stand up for what you
believe in and so I do believe that if
you're really passionate about something
it is okay to voice your opinion about
it and you should and so I usually have
this rule that's don't respond to any
negative comments but I just actually
didn't respond to a negative comment I
just posted an additional comment under
my video that I want to talk about
because I'm so passionate about it in my
last video why I'm not in a relationship
it's still mostly positive but it has a
bit more hate than usual and it's just a
whole bunch of people being like oh
you're probably single because you're
gay
or you have too much testosterone or
like you just like all this racist
sexist like oh because no guy would date
you
you guys don't so long story short it's
a whole bunch of dudes not liking the
fact that I'm
I don't want to be in a relationship or
it's a bunch of girls being offended
because what I'm saying doesn't relate
to how they feel about the situation and
so I basically posted a comment on my
video that was just like hey if you need
this outlet to make yourself feel better
great I'm a happy person that makes
comedy my goal is to make people laugh
in my videos if you want to assume I'm
generalizing people or trying to be
offensive that's counterproductive to
comedy but what pissed me off the most
is that if I was to make a pissed-off is
doing read the word what triggered me
the most is that when I make a video
about like relationships and flirting
and crushes and like guys being hot and
me going on dates it's a hit but the
video I make round like hey I am a
female I'm 27 and I'm have brown skin
and I don't want to be a relationship
for some reason so many people are
offended by that because they don't want
that I guess and and so people's
responses like oh there must be
something wrong with you then and like
no one must date you then no how about I
just don't want to be in a relationship
and to all the salty guys out there that
can't handle that and just like open
something must be wrong with you just
because I'm too busy hustling to like
create your penis it doesn't mean I'm
gay and even if I was gay that's a lame
insult because nothing is wrong with
being gay and it's just like so sexist I
think that's what triggered me the whole
comments are just so sexist cuz like
your girl does want to be a relationship
and not know we don't like that out of
here with your masculinity in your
effing complexes okay don't bring that
ish to me I'm a mother effin boss I like
to buy my own things okay I like romance
I don't need romance this is me that's
my point of view it's my channel that's
my video if you's a man who's insecure
and you can't handle that there's plenty
other women who'd probably happy to date
you although I'm sure that might not be
the case because you salty do salt I
wish I had some skittles to give you to
help your saltiness that's it that's my
bread I serve for three minute bag and I
genuinely want to say regardless of what
it might seem like I'm not upset I'm not
offended and
not sad I just really felt it right to
comment that because I'm passionate
about it I'm passionate my girl up I'm
passionate about sexism and and so I
wanted to voice it and I'm not regretful
and I don't think it was the wrong thing
to do I stand by that so I might get
back to writing my book in death huh I
move it on for you know next thing it's
because I'm writing I'm writing every
day and so that my thinking is just so
critical of these past few days that's
why I keep going on like these rants and
these long things in the blogging on
faced with these long things with my
Twitter species because I'm used to
writing and so like it's coming out in
every other part of my life but yo like
this great it's great to express your
opinions cuz you know what you know our
next thing is I believe you can say what
you mean without saying it mean like I
don't think I would have ever replied
like that to an individual maybe but
underneath the video generically yo why
not actually able to say how I feel I'm
still gonna promote what I love not bash
when I hate when it comes to the minor
things but this one mmm
sexism not cute not down with it I need
to write my book also humble is still
sleeping he took a nap like an hour ago

working beside me and so that's a bit
tough for me to work but we're gonna get
