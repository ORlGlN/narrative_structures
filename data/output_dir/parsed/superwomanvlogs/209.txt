morning
I didn't wash my face to do anything
really got up at 5 45 minutes ago
finish writing this rap song I'm bout to
recordings we're gonna start shooting at
7/8 I will speak to you momentarily done
it's not perfect but I really like the
lyrics okay it's not perfect because
it's the beauty of post-production
because you can tweak the line just use
some b-roll or bottom Jesus is not
saying the line I do a lot of
post-production magic when it comes to
the rap song sometimes I write it I
watch it on my clean sound like that
line let's change it when you change
line obviously but I'm dude saying wrong
line so use b-roll something else things
very cleverly written and we'll check it

mission which I turn into bottom G's

lady I was just like loving it because I
play characters and I always feel like
sometimes people think that's silly my
mentality is like when did we ever get
so old and boring that we can't play
dress-up anymore the guy loved doing
characters thing it's so fun I learned
more about myself a little about other
people and I could take a certain sense
of like I know confidence I guess to do
I was so happy so she did that and have
the need to look like a sexy girl I just
like played the characters and it was
wonderful and spoiler so if you haven't
seen I'm sorry stop watching now

crush on a teacher and I was like I love
everything about this it's just so
