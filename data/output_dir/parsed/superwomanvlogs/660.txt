morning so it is Monday the time is 11
a.m. I woke about an hour ago and
already Monday has become chaotic the
weekend is definitely over we are back
into work mode this is what's happening
I'm gonna go over my sides right now my
script I have an audition in 1 and a
half hours which I'm obviously nervous
about but excited about but nervous
about but excited about obviously
nervous about I have that I feel that I
have a two or three hour shoot at my
place for something YouTube related and
then after that I have to send a one
video idea of treatment for something I
have to send one ruffcut for something
it's also super Monday speaking of which
in some parts of LA there is a super
Monday filter let me show it to you hold
on okay are you ready are you ready are
you ready : yeah look at this look at
this is super Monday filter on snapchat
and it's some parts of Ellie and someone
surprised me with it I was like oh my
god that is dope so I'm very excited
about that
but it's super Monday AKA a.k.a also
known as it is a very busy hectic day
which means we're gonna have to go into
ultimate beast mode to get all this
stuff done so what's gonna happen Lily
you're gonna go get breakfast you're
gonna practice these sides you're gonna
go to your dishing and try your absolute
best you're not gonna be nervous and if
you are nervous you can turn it into
something positive and use it as
motivation to learn something during
this learning opportunity you have been
blessed with after that you're gonna
come do this shoot you try your best
because it is quite intense a lot of
intense questions you try your best
after that you're going to start on the
rough cut of the video you need to do
then after that you will fight to write
the video treatment you need to submit
then after that you'll ask the team
super what you want to see for super
Monday and you will make the biggest
baddest team super video you'll be very
tiring it'll be very hard but you know
what these are the moments that will
make you tougher in life and make you
better for tomorrow I'm better for next
Monday so we're gonna do it with a smile
on our face we're not gonna get
flustered
we're gonna keep calm we remain positive
we're gonna get work done
as soon as we take a deep breath let God
also also happy leave here also also
also tomorrow
the Pilates interval intense training I
need to learn the proper way to say that
but Cassie's Blogilates a 28 day
challenge starts tomorrow so you go
grocery shopping for that I am pumped
for that so that's more things on the
true list but we're gonna do it we're
gonna do it man okay okay okay so now a
little bit stressed because I don't know
have these things at work and I just got
a call kind of explaining how they work
and now I've been told that a lot of
really intimidating people that I cannot
disclose are going to be in the room
when I audition today and I mean I'm
really good at pretending I'm not
nervous but I'm really nervous right now
because I also learned that I don't know
anything about patsies and I was like
you know mini victory getting called
back it's nothing in the long process of
things but actually what as a process
actually really really lengthy so even
though I got a callback I'm still like
in the very early stages there's like a
billion more tests to do and that's kind
of stressful because like use you in
something you know relieving a pinch
like okay one step closer one step
closer and I am one step closer but one
step closer in a marathon all other
things that still need to happen so of a
little bit stressed on ocula I believe
we said we're gonna prepare and go in
there coffee that's still what we're
gonna do like I said no audition will be
the make-or-break of me or my career but
still ah okay let's take a shower clean
bums get roles okay these are the vibes
that the professional vibes going on so
I stopped talking with myself in the
mirror and like dude honestly just enjoy
it soak up as much knowledge as you can
learn as many things as you can this is
a great learning opportunity don't let
it pass the worst that's gonna happen is
you're not gonna get the part it's like
all billion other things going on it's
cool I say this out loud because I also
need to cheer up like it's not the make
or break if anything this is a great
opportunity for you learn things I'm
gonna go on there learn as many things
that I can't do the best thing
and if I don't get it it just Wilson the
parts not right for me and I'm not right
for the part that doesn't take away
anything from me so we're gonna go gonna
try our best and see what happens we
gotta see the thing that's difficult is
usually after one stressful thinking
then I come home and have another
nervous stressful shoot here which I'm
nervous about both so but no one said my
time we started we're gonna do and we do
nothing else besides that let's go okay
so I'm back home I didn't spontaneously
combust that's a good news as per usual
I have no idea how that went there was a
lot of really really cool people in the
room which was very nervous and very
exciting at the same time and after an
audition or after anything that's
nerve-wracking always come home and like
dissect that I don't like they do this
too much what if I said that do they
even laugh at that oh my god and I will
like nitpick and go crazy so I'm just
saying to not do that I have no idea how
it went
also I've learned that like I just
mentioned earlier the process to get
roles is so long so even if I do get
called back it's still such a long
process so it's very nerve-wracking but
it's like literally I move my brain is
exercising lifting weights because I
come stepping out of my comfort zone
that's what matters I learn new things
it's all good it's all cool I'm very
proud of myself and making it happen
um and yeah now I have a youtube shoot
that's like two or three hours of my
place so that's gonna require some you
know more weight lifting from my brain
I'm going to go fix on my makeup change
and do that and then like we said we're
gonna do first draft video treatment
super Monday video I'm finally at you
know I was thinking on the way back home
I'm finally understanding the term or a
card play hard because what I'm in these
nerve-racking situations the boys like
holy crap like I do have this thought
I'm like why can't I just have a job
that's like not nerve-wracking and that
doesn't stress me out like I can just
know that most jobs to have their
stressful moments but like a job where
there's a routine and you're not in
these extremely extremely anxious
situations like auditioning and
presenting and performing with why can't
you just do something else that's
something a little bit less
anxiety stricken struck in gives you
anxiety if they don't like no you know
what I go through so many of the
situations where I really feel like we
have a stroke I'm saying but then like
yo that's work hard I'll make sure I
play hard to like that's why I get the
massages that's why I chill that's why I
get to be on yachts in Trinidad that's
why I get to do this stuff I'm gonna
stop speaking because I don't have time
I enjoy fix that makeup but I'm doing
this because this is how I'm unwinding
for my audition so so Jojo hodja hodja
it just smell what The Rock is cooking
so that shoot took way longer than it
was supposed to but it's okay cuz
everyone was great when I am in that
movie and never to believe very behind
on my day I'm gonna eat we're gonna eat
I'm gonna eat and then we're gonna get
to work we're not gonna talk about how
stressed we are right now because it's
gonna be fine and at the beginning of
the day we said we weren't gonna be
stressed so now I'm getting rid of that
we're gonna eat it's gonna be fine
exactly yeah so I'm about to shoot this
first draft of this video the time is
8:00 this is not my Monday buddy this is
actually for remember I did that dope
Sheila Steve Aoki that was not possible
because acai on the car and he's so I'm
just taking a moment to remember how
dope Steve Aoki was when I shot with him
I'm saying the first track for that
video um so that's what's happening and
let's do it Oh today's one of those days
where I can't think of a new idea ye ye
ye ye ye ye ye
how to dance defacing
I'm so weird just finished recording my
video I actually really really like it
it's called things I miss about high
school I like laugh a lot when making us
I hope you enjoyed it as well it was on
my main channel when I edit it right now
it's 1108 so I'd tomorrow have another
audition it's so today was like the
practice for tomorrow I guess so I have
that same audition process tomorrow and
it's much more intense cuz it's in front
of a lot more people so still a very
long process but um this is a game you
got to play not to make or break and I
think making this video kind of reminded
me of that is like you got your own is
going on so don't be nervous just have
fun and learn things I'm gonna have that
11:30 so I don't want to sleep too late
cuz after like nine ish that means I'm
gonna add this video that I gotta edit
the other one for Sion and then that
treatment video thing I'm gonna try to
push that till tomorrow initially do
emails and then prep for the challenge
the blog lobbies challenge tomorrow so
that's what's going on let's edit this
year I reread Jem the time is 1156 p.m.
my videos uploading it's got 15 minutes
left I'm gonna release that I'm gonna
start editing the other one now my goal
is to be done by I want to say one I
don't know if that's optimistic though
it is a rough cut so by one my goal is
to be done by one that's fine now okay
so this time the 133 am I finished
editing the video 15 minutes ago and I
printed out the stuff for the blog
lady's challenge like a calendar we
check off of each day it's very
colourful I like it I like it I like it
and I'm gonna read through the thing I'm
a lot more pressing I'm Barbara of how
to do this thing so let's do it
I need some honey and water also mmm man
the way I am tired right now
I can make my honey and water situation
but I added this cloud I'm gonna go to
sleep
I'm nervous about tomorrow but it's okay
because it's not the make a break it's
not to make a break it's not the make a
break or learn things these moments make
you better these nerve-racking moments
or you wanna collapse
they make you better and it's exercise
for the mind so that's what's going on I
did almost all the things I wanted to do
today I just read through it Cassie's
entire Blogilates thing it's so dope I'm
gonna try to stick to it as much as I
can I am a little bit stressed at the
fact that I'm gonna go to India on March
14th probably be very tough to follow
the eating guidelines in India but I'm
gonna try my best to stick the thing
with this is weird when you have a
hectic schedule like mine's hard to
stick like thing hard to stick to things
like this but I'm gonna try my best and
tell myself that even if some days I
fail doesn't mean the next day I can't
carry on just because I fail one day
doesn't mean I feel a little thing so I
try my best to stick to it I'm very
excited who knows in 28 days maybe I'll
be like all strong and stuff we'll see I
wanted to drink this stuff my voice I'm
hitting puberty and I'm gonna go to bed
