song I was thinking I woke up I just

house my alarms did not go off and I'm
not just biessing I woke up like I

appreciate that but I woke up just in
measurements I have one more measurement
at two measurements to have one more
meeting have to go to we're not coming
to me that to do measurements with as
well which is kind of like I guess not
really measurements that's fitting or
also purchasing like hey here are the
measurements but um you all I need to
like this long get right here you need
to I mean I love myself but I mean I
need to do what situation this situation
is no situation I enjoy it because it's
caused me great anxiety I have this
habit up because I know I'm getting the
house I keep throwing things everywhere
being like it's okay we'll move soon I'm
not moving soon I'm not moving of course
the house is closed in a few days but I
still have two months moves there's calm
calm down really calm down it's not
doing this I'm having said all that I'm
gonna sleep for 10 more minutes I'm
going to clean this up is also video day
one of my friends also asked if I want
to go see Demi and DNC because they have
a private show and I was like I really
want to go put it's video day and so
we'll figure it out we'll play about
here but for now little bit more sleepy
time because I'm a little bit sleepy
still is that okay he's okay
I just guys sleep a couple a little bit
more the time is one 1238 just a little
bit more if you can see it my nose I'm
sorry was the Booker's so I'm heading
there I'm actually gonna be on time the
last couple things I've been late
because I can't like navigate traffic
properly if you like alley traffic's not
that time every once in a while I'd be
like uh um your I really I mentioned it
earlier in the clip I need to like start
working on a bunch of things so like I
wanna have a hot body you know like I
love myself I love my love handles
imaging lead eyes I love them I love
myself but like my dues are counterfeit
you know not
great and they're so I need to like get
back together make some better choices
in life but either way I'm I love myself
I don't care if I'm Jigglypuff or if I'm
looking fly like Zelda yeah I mean I
love myself either way but I you can
swim sit-ups every once in a while maybe
while my popcorns in the microwave on do
sit-ups nonsan all right what's that
right just finish my fitting what is
this edited about e-ticket my thing
because tomorrow I'm a guest star on the
show life in pieces so I'm at Fox
Studios right now I just do my fitting
and fittings are always interesting for
me because I've said this before on
blogs like I'm awkward changing in front
of people's like I wore Reverse type of
underwear and bra to myself but it's
just we're gonna have to get over it
like the person never leaves the room
and is an Indian actor own up with that
like you leave the room but they just
stand right there's almost like you just
like gotten over it more more - couple
of them got this elevator but wait
where's Kalifa so something I want to
say food for thought Lily's food for
thought maybe I'll do this daily let's
be real I'm not gonna do it daily but
something I've realized and I wrote a
chapter about this and how to be a boss
it's it's in the journey to be
successful or happiness or success or
ever achieve your goals there's just no
room for pride I just learned that your
pride and ego like you got to get rid of
it and I'll give an example I'm not
gonna say any specifics that was
completely lovely so wonderful but the
way I get treated in the digital space
versus the way I get treated in
Hollywood it's not good and bad it's
just very very different
and sometimes when I go to Hollywood
things I'm just like I have to view it's
like so different oh hi good Tunes it
just it's not bad I want to emphasize
not bad it's just different and so the
way I navigate that is to not have it
you going I try my best out of ego in
either situation some people in the
digital space like gassing me up and
like treating me also tak like I don't
want that get to me because I know in
other areas my life I'm not gonna be
treated like that and so it's just
important to keep in mind that anything
you do is don't have pride don't like
don't have you have a self pride that's
why I don't have an ego I feel like an
ego waste people down and sometimes it
hurts
it's annoying and sometimes like oh I
could easily go if you don't know how
good true do just but I'm not gonna do
that because that's nowhere on the
journey to success so whatever you do
for your own mentality and for your
journey on to success get rid of your
ego ego I feel like makes you unhappy as
a person I give you false happiness and
it holds you back in so many facets of
life so no ego let go home you're gonna
think I'm lying but I've went to four
different gas stations the first two
didn't exist this third one was just
like clothes or some ish and when I just
went to now it's a hand car washes those
two take 30 minutes like why is it so
hard to find a car wash I don't
understand la like an automated car like
I don't want to hand wash I want a quick
five-minute automated car wash
it's impossible I went to four four
different ones is this just me I don't
get everything Google like intensely
Google how to wash my car what the N
palette what about look that way too

did you miss me let's say real today's a
really sad day it's a big day for Lily
we're taking her ring and she'll have it
back but she needs to part with it for
about 72 hours I get to the end do any
birthday stuff that you don't do any
work this stuff can you tell about 30
birthday stuff all right it won't be a
birthday surprise it'll be something
else oh my god Andrew please don't lose
it it's my favorite thing ever I know
don't worry I know what I'm doing okay
don't spend a lot of money on things I
don't need things Oh money is my
favorite bathtub yeah two reasons the
world current reasons in the world why
girl that needs to exist number one
Angela Jolie and Brad Pitt split all the
headlines are about Jennifer Aniston
being happy about it why media do you
have to pick two women against each
other just because Angelina Jolie and
Brad Pitt split some girl's pain does
not automatically result in another
girl's happiness that it doesn't have to
be like that you don't have to pick
women against each other like that like
why drag her in anyways second reason is
because on Facebook Gigi Hadid is
trending right now because the headline
is she cheated huge lashes out at
Fashion Show what happened was a guy
grabbed her and she defended herself and
the to end the title is that she lashes
out why because we want to portray women
as like crazy people crazy people who
lash out that's girl up girl up girl up
be critical for
anchors about the media and what they do
and how they they send these messages up
either way in 723 I just did some work I
have a lot more work to do
my Doulos listen looking kind of like
and I stopped to make a video so I'm
going to put the video as priority right
now they're working on that and that's
what's up and what's topping with you
was popping with you speaking of pop
interests in popcorn I did just eat when
has that ever stopped me hmm
decisions was poppin the time is 9:27
I'm about to record my video videos
different from videos I usually make
it's my thoughts regarding Brangelina or
something along those lines with a
little bit of my twist you know a little
my twist I might record that and I don't
wanna sleep too late because my call
times are 7:30 anymore it's 8:30 but
still really early want to be fresh
force that has a little nervous about it
but I want to make sure I don't look
sleepy and I'm not sleepy so let's get
this in okay how crazy is this there's a
windstorm outside that's so bad that
this thing is moving and the doors
closed like the door is completely
closed and the wind is still affecting I
have to bring this stuff inside because
it's like blowing away everywhere Ellie
has some crazy wind strums I did not
know that prior to moving here like you
can hear it in the background on my
video you can brought I don't know you
can even hear it in the vlogs I like
crazy can your
like what what what is happening I'm
literally out of control I'm just out of
control I clean my office in the kitchen

grateful that were nominated of course I
am

get used to the idea of being validated

an addition not the definition I feel so

ungrateful not happy of course if you
