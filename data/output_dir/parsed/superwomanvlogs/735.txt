essentially packing in one day which is
not ideal but what is what is the effort
futures today few situations but I'm
just really not looking forward to the
airport I have a stupid amount of stuff
to do tomorrow as well it's just really
kind of irresponsible of me to leave it
and no idea what's happening Mike Labs
these are all my thoughts right now I'm
going to make this list while I
translate single asleep and fall asleep
doing that and this will essentially be
the last time I sleep in this bed as
someone who lives here even though I'm
going to come back and sleep in it again
many times but as someone who lives in
this house it's my last time sleeping in
this bed in this bedroom ah
and another thing that hit me was it's
gonna also be like me moving out of the
house that Marner was into my grandpa
that's kind of like cool I'm good
I'm so good I'm so good um I wanna make
this list and tomorrow we're packing and
it's gonna be great and so it's gonna be
so good so if you like it subscribe if
