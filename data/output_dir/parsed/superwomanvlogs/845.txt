clothes I needed my laundry so bad and
I'm actually really excited to see my
mom I really miss my mom and my sister
hasn't given birth yet
I missed the birth of my second at the
odds therefore first Fu cuz I was
traveling I was in Thailand and I was
almost positive I was gonna miss the
birth of my third niece or nephew
whichever one I'm not sure um because
it's just supposed to doing like a week
but you know a week is not you can give
birth earlier so she doesn't give birth
yet so hopefully when I come this plane
I can make it and she doesn't give birth
with the next like nine hours and I can
be there here's to hoping I get to catch
the birth of my third niece or nephew
