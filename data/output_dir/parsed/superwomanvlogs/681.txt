I am a cranky monkey right now it is
eight something I woke up at 7:30 I am
so tired but I'm not gonna complain
about being tired because you're you
seen enough of that you see that all the
time I am heading to New Orleans still
haven't got the confirmation that I can
actually tell you what I'm going for
when to shoot something I'm gonna try my
best to tell you I know this is annoying
like I said it was up to me I would tell
you but I don't to get in trouble by the
contract so sonic throws are hanging to
New Orleans though I was really early
I'm gonna sleep apart one thing you
should know about me why don't you
believe I'm a nice person except in the
morning except in the morning don't act
to be in the morning in the morning I'd
be hating people the more not be
stabbing people in the morning I'd be
like yeah I hate mornings and I think my
parents know about some very cranky in
mornings I'm not a morning person my
brain doesn't work in the morning my
eyes hurt in the morning the heart is
like 50% unicorn in the morning so
that's what's that also I just want to
tell you the power of a compliment so so
cranky and so tired I got to the airport
and some guy looked at me like the guy
who was checking music God you gorgeous
I'm like I'm wearing I'm wearing no
makeup I just walk over got years ago
that's how you know it's real and I'm
like good sir you have changed my day
thank you so much compliment people can
change your day makes it feel good
anyways that's I can't wait to sleep on
his damn plane I'm a knockout like
that's how I Minako just let just like
that so I'm in New Orleans and my ears
were so severely plug who don't know how
loud I was speaking with him loud or not
loud I have no idea
funniest story though the flight was
only two and a half hours and I thought
it was in Greg four or five and I was
expecting to get five hours of sleep I
did not what
drop out I can't hear anything um funny
history as I'm getting up the plane
person thing in front of me is Ashton
Kutcher and I'm just like what's the
help so I'm like hey you posted one of
my youtube videos once on your Facebook
so like thanks a lot he's like oh yeah
you're welcome and you could tell like
he didn't want people to know he was
there so I was like did ask him for a
picture anything Rose like yeah thanks
so much then because my ears so plug I
couldn't hear what he was saying so I'm
like oh what are you here for he said to
see some family and I'm like oh to sleep
and he's like yeah I see that basically
I embarrass myself for Ashton Kutcher's
now but seeing so many don't people um I
can't hear jack so I can't tell you I am
but I'm gonna try and sneak around as
much as I can what does this look like I
will tell you as a trailer so you know
shooting something very very small thing
I'm shooting so it's not like a huge
deal but the project is a huge deal my
role is very small but still I'm gonna
tell you soon I'll go tell you some okay
what is this hotel right now this is my
room like oh wait wait
what is even happening right up why do I
have such a big roof oh my god what is
this a makeup don't even what they're
not friggin massive sweet I am not mad
about this but I have such a small role
in this thing this is the room they gave
me god damn god damn this just sinks
everywhere there's a sink right here
wiser for what I don't know do um this
is really cool though I'm gonna order
some room service comb my hair wash my
hair and then get an early night I
haven't slept much since the premiere so
umm but I wanted to talk with my feels
for a second because a lot of the things
I'm doing in life are really scary umm
acting auditions all these things I'm
not the most experienced at and you know
someone said this in a meeting the other
day with me I didn't realize it until he
said out loud but it's like it's just
challenging because I you know when I
started YouTube I started like not to
quote Drake but like started from the
bottom and like climbed my way up lick
with sleepless nights and editing and
just quite to be really really blunt
like being ignored by a lot of people
until I like climb way up to be someone
that I hope people think is funny and
kind of recognize respect um but when
you get into like traditional the
traditional space when it's movies or -
films like it's a whole separate ladder
and I'm starting from the bare bottom
again so it's kind of like I don't mind
I know everything you do you got to put
in work and I don't mind but in work is
just a little bit like my brain is split
into two ways because I can't do YouTube
stuff and like you know I want to really
blunt YouTube stuff you'll need security
you'll need like people will know you
people want to talk to you then you come
to this space in just like an absolute
no one so it's a little bit challenging
to kind of learn how to climb all over
again but I'm willing to do it and I'm
exciting
but it's just really terrifying
sometimes like I just went on set and
I've met really cool people that I'm
like intimidated by obviously but like
then to be like oh so that's that's
that's it I'm just rambling because um
it's nerve-racking and I don't know I'm
nervous and yeah is that yeah that I
need food okay food also okay let's talk
about this every time I have a fitting I
don't know if it's because I was raised
in like an Indian household or like what
it is I have a hard time changing in
front of people can you please comment
below and let me know this is just you
like in front of my girlfriends I can
change whatever but if it's a complete
stranger I just met like when I go to
fittings and there's like stylist I know
styles have seen a billion people change
but I feel very like self-conscious and
I don't want to change in front of you
so it has to go to the bathroom that
happened today and she was like very
like oh okay
yeah go to the bathroom I was like oh my
god I need to like get used to that and
get okay with that because I know it's a
very like a mature thing to want to go
to wash you and change at the same time
like I don't care I just wanna feel
comfortable I'm gonna do it I don't care
but it's just very like maybe something
I need to get over because um no one
else does that it's just me and let me
comment below let me know if you're the
same way I can like take off my top and
like be my bra in front of an Allegro
that's fine if she's just honest but a
hard time changing my bottoms in front
of like someone else is that just me am
i looser
am i nerd let me know calm ago I
realized when I say like things not to
do a coma hair it sounds stupid because
I call me you're so easy I spend like 30
minutes because my hair like literally
it was teased so much and this part is
combed and it's like a mission like a
mission oh my god I err I was leaving on
my cheek and I my cheek looks I'm
wearing blush someone punch me in the
face going on anyways it's 9:15 I'm so
tired I'm gonna do some emails at this
ball gonna go to sleep my call time
tomorrow is nine point I mean sorry 8:25
I'm gonna get picked up so I wanted as
much sleep as I can't haven't slept
properly and so long I'm definitely
getting sick I feel a little something
in my throat and everyone around me sick
also so I'm sure that's what's happening
my nose ring is doing weird things
yeah sorry and also some very eventful
vlog a little bit Emo's little bit
thought I know I'm feeling some type of
way today I think I'm like
sleep-deprived my emotions are all over
