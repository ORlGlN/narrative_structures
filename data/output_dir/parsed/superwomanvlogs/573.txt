the weekend is over let's get to work
okay good but is it me me what I should
be a singer I think I should be asking
should I stop making YouTube videos and
be a singer
it is Monday super Monday video day work
day weekend is over
juvenessence Sunday is over it's time to
hustle time to get to work I'm gonna go
eat some oatmeal as per usual you know I
love me my oatmeal and then we gonna get
to it I got two calls today
ooh I've never got spike is coming over
for a meeting so two calls in a meeting
and video day we gonna make it count
all righty yesterday's card was about
wonder I actually really liked that card
I said that every day I like all the
cards but today's card is about dinner
it's about vitality we look like there's
little Lumi by fighting vitality I'm
healthy and vital and strong my radiant
love of life fills me with healthy vital
and strong cells each cell is a warrior
everyone has its own sort of shield I
dare you to try to penetrate my cellular
army didn't think so
chump I love these cards so this is
about the fact that your vital and
strong hopefully I mean we're very
blessed to be in situations where we can
say that and every cell is a warrior
that's really really dope use what your
cells look like inside your body with
swords and shields so act like it
be grateful do the most of what you can
with your warrior cells yeah I mean
that's what's going on
dance was poppin awesome a bad person I
finish the last oatmeal no house no peel
and you know why even a worse person
because there is a meal it's the one I
like and humble doesn't like and did I
have one of those no I had the one that
we both like because I'm a bad person
was popping ruckus I'm Rhonda today just
finished two calls and I have a meeting
with Spike and humble and humble I was
like yo Lily are you ring sucks I was
like why is like cuz I'm about to knock
them off
according to humble I was impressed with
that lie
lunch is also on its way so all good
things happening and popping up and I
also gotta work on my video after but
everything's going great you're right
that's fine
this is the face of a person that
doesn't have a video idea for today and
then this is the face of a person that's
convinced me to watch a basketball game
and not think about you
let's think of a video video right now
okay okay
because it's apparently the finals
between Golden's day and Cavs so why
don't you make a video about sports what
about what about your either
lack of understanding for example I made
one for the American soccer for soccer I
remember that yeah there's no point
making one for basketball what if you
made a video see this is why I don't
make videos they can come up with these
ideas it's been three seconds what have
you made a video of types of sports fans
I could do that I don't know if I know
enough about that types of sports fans
hmm hmm maybe I could that's my bad or
so I can show you a video of it they did
something really cool where they had
British people doing commentary on
baseball and then they had Americans and
commentary and socrata so the difference
you could do like if girls and sports
customs
girls are sports casters like like
commentators on the games why can't
girls be commentators well nothing that
can't be anything that they generally
apart nobody said they can't be but you
don't look laughing you watch the sports
team and heard a female voice no now I'm
just pissed off hold on did you hear
that was that female commentator
Cavs are leading by four second limo is
done
I hate to make this about me in my city
right but these fans suck compared to
Raptors fans let me just say am I the
only one tomorrow's weather does yeah
I'm like I don't even hear you cheering
where are you I mean are you even there
we compared to Toronto fans week so that
game I didn't I fell asleep so I don't
know what happened but all of us of the
Cavs won I'm so sleepy today but as a
video day it's 9 p.m. you shut the f up
nor cut the cake so I finished writing
my video I can't watch such a good ideas
types of sports fans and your home and
now a moon I I do what we always do
which is throwing a ball around there
talking for record no to Thursday or
Monday Monday the video is that oh
that's a mind every tip and I'm about to
record
last time home blood
this by the way were lucky weeks to the
bar to us the next morning well it was
like you were like it's not oldest most
broken up people ever so we can't we
hang up we have a ball touring limit
okay back my video I don't much record
this video I just want to say real real
talk you know I guess be real seal
making two videos a week is so friggin
hard like every Monday and Thursday I am
stressed I'm just like holy crap how the
hell isn't Monday again or hot like
Monday Thursday feel like there's 30
seconds in between them I make a video
I'm not complaining I'm just I know this
is on me I made it but I'm trying to be
honest and let them know that there's
there it is really friggin hard like
every Monday there's in like oh my god I
appreciate it can't hear anything you're
saying cuz there's an echo okay once you
catch my blog camera all right you're
gonna first time witness you're either
gonna shatter into pieces
oh you think you're better like this you
shattered into pieces or humble is gonna
hold you down again it's recording
alright here we go ready yes so what I
was just gonna say is it is extremely
hard to come up with creative ideas two
times a week what she does in a day
takes me two weeks and I think the big
difference is I just go but she doesn't
she sticks with it and I know all the
times I get a bunch of tweets from you
guys saying stuff like yo tell
superwoman to rest she doesn't need to
make a video today bla bla bla but she
was really good at what she does and she
needs to continue doing it because
as long as she continues doing it then I
can chill and eat up all the food in the
fridge
it keeps the kung pao chicken coming in
how did this happen
oh hello for those you that are
wondering when it zooms in like that a
so same camera the zoom and gets rid of
the fisheye because I know sometimes I
feel like where do the picture is just
zoomed in but then it's like so hard to
vlog anyways it is 11:40 I just finished
recording the video I struggled a lot
there's a few lines I literally said
them like 50 times because I kept
stuttering in some way all my words this
is gonna be fun to edit I'm super
freaking weird you'll see in the video
I'm so weird trying to wave with my hair
like this
yes populist babble is pop and I posted
my video
it is types of sports fans as I
mentioned Hall up let there be light
door where'd you come from
that'll be Lord Charlie the time is not
a phone this is my name is line I don't
know I think it's 1:30 I'm gonna head to
bed because my first meeting is at 10:00
tomorrow maybe I can get in like a tower
is this 880 showers of sleep which would
be really really dope today I was just
struggling falling asleep everywhere
because I didn't get enough sleep side
don't want to make that mistake again
so I'm gonna head to bed and what else
do I have to tell you tomorrow is such a
busy day so many things I have a meeting
and then have a meeting after that they
have a super one life and then I have a
collab I'm shooting with two people that
you'll find out tomorrow then after that
I'm shooting another club with someone
which you'll find out tomorrow and then
after that I might go to Susie's house
to whoop him some Mario Kart so that's
what it's kind of and then I got a pack
for New York which is the next day so on
a Lada I booked it a lot of things are
happening it's gonna be very very
eventful day and I'm so glad you can
join me on the journey cuz the house or
don't stop that's what's up if you like
hit subscribe if you liked it subscribe
blood-clot if you like it promote one
love and be like you I don't give an F
who you love or how you choose to live
your life we all need to spread that
awareness and this is like yeah I'm
talking like the pride shooting right
now but aside from that whether it's
Christina's shooting or whether it's any
other thing that's happening anywhere
around the world you have to do
something about it
you can't just sit there and be like oh
I what am I gonna do it one person No
then as one person think of something to
do like we have to do something about
all the stuff that's happening
