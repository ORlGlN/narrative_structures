course you bring your tea bags I don't
need to get any I'd love a cow these are
the important questions she's recording
my rent give me the point that I wrote
it as long as it was so dope because you
need natural some way so they're not too
often because I usually shoot my rants

gonna turn to Sailor Mars
cuz they threw a pickup shot there's
this video I didn't love Thursday's
video by the way I'm like really excited
for it
I think it's we're gonna learn all right
so we're waiting for Sailor Mars to Deep
Wrinkle in the dryer right now so we
can't shoot just yeah the team is doing
in case you're wondering why I don't
work with the rest of my team is there's
no space through me I'm so many team
members that there's no space from the
office after work upstairs my writing
woman also they talk so much I'm the
worst it's almost my fault where if I'm
writing a script I Nino's like someone
could see me
not be like oh just not fair to be
working with them Wow my new rug is here
up hey Taylor how's it going hey what's
up I just sent Taylor whole bunch of
screenshots of your comments about
Taylor from yesterday's vlog I wanted to
make sure Taylor felt special this is
the comment I sent Taylor right the
funny part is actually cropped it
because this is what would come below it
what they're actually hitting on me even
if you think you're hot and then this
hole was like oh but this is about me
and he put this comment so it's a
comment war between who y'all think of
the hottest obviously yes so you know
Taylor defend it to me and put the
comment that you decide it's true I like
no I think it's funny you tell this

make sure you fall girl up on Twitter
and on Instagram but you can see sick
Clips like this meeting if people don't

done we need to come here and tell
people what's going on because if we
don't say what the problem is no one's
ever going to know it how to fix it
bashing which you hey anything girl up

sisterhood and womanhood and just the
empowerment of women it's just warms my
heart so please go follow the socials

suggestions from what you'd love to see

trying to do more of because I feel like
it contributes to my peace and my
happiness is connecting with people that
one I admire - I feel like I have a lot
of similarities with and three that I
think are just genuinely really good
energies that complement my life and
when I connect I don't just mean like hi

we're pretty like genuinely deeply
connecting isn't like I want to know
about you why you are the way you are
things you've learned challenges you
faced and now I want to share those
things from my end with you like I
really just want to connect with you on
a deeper level and so I'm making a
