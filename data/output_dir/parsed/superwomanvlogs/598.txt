good morning the time is 1144 I'm
heading to my dentist's appointment to
hopefully tell them this top piece of
business line doesn't fit anymore
hopefully hopefully we can figure that
out I thought I have a shoot which I'm
going to actually texture about and see
if I can push or cancel if not I'm gonna
do it reason being I have some really
bad period cramps right now and I've
learned from personal experience I want
to have those cramps I should not do
things because I have fainted in my past
it has been devastating in the past so
I've learned to just cave into the
period cramps so we see if that can
happen if not then its power to it but
that's what's happening today is also
video day I'm a sprinkler it's also a
video day um hot soda yesterday I
hustled so hard has so much done but
today's Monday it's gonna be a good one
let's do it burn this together II I see
the rescan the top of the top part that
didn't fit and so they're gonna make me
a new one now so that's all good it's
gonna be fixed in about ten days they're
gonna get it so that's dope she said my
bottom teeth have moved alot so
everything's well on track ting ting
ting I suppose had oatmeal so there
might be some stuck in my teeth okay
today's key of the game just like in
basketball how they have keys to the
game it's gonna be a long day I'm my
cramps are kind of subsided but I'm
still not feeling a hundred percent
myself but I wasn't able to move the
shoe well I was able to talk tomorrow
but my tomorrow is way more hectic and I
think I'll regret it so I'm gonna do
this shoe today then it's also video day
just mad mad issue this week is gonna be
a bit challenging it's me a lot a lot of
work I can't speak it's gonna be an
intense work week it's gonna be very
intense and the key to today to finish
everything is to not hesitate sometimes
you have a lot to do you're tempted to
sit down to like Frigg like how am I
going to do this then start to scroll
through Instagram none of that no
hesitation don't overthink it just start
things get things done start things get
things done commit to our decisions that
is what we're doing today

lying mouth I don't say anything good

and I are in this predicament was very
lane we're like we have nothing to eat
what do we need so today at 9:36
we're decided to go to the store closes
at 10:00 to try to figure eating
situation I hear situation right the
grocery store downstairs has been kind
of betraying us mug food and not having
the vegetarian vegan chicken stuff that
we eat and I feel like I need to walk in
there playing lemonade because I show
why the betrayal dog why portrayal also
when the comments in yesterday's vlog
was how come every time we leave vlog
humble he's never smiles
that's just humble space
answer the question I'm smiling all the
time she's can't see cuz I'm a big
smiling
there ya go there ya go okay you look
like you're gonna stab me okay
yo what up home skillet I also speed up
my video by 11:30 it is 12:30 I'm still
editing some hour behind schedule I
actually record some part of it because
I said the wrong line happens very often
that I know the joke but I say something
else then when I'm editing I'm like damn
it so I'm little behind but going strong
all the time is 1 2 3 4 how cool
alright the time is 2:00 a.m. and posted
the video about 15 minutes ago now I'm
working on handwritten cards and
basically sending boughs the lipstick to
a bunch of my god female creator friends
and I'm sending handwritten cards with
them because I just like handwritten
cards I think it's a nice gesture and I
want to make them unique for each person
so he should know writing takes me a
really long time with my hand a few
reasons one I'm double jointed
I'm very double-jointed sorry if you're
disgusted by this but like my fingers
will lock in certain positions like I'm
on the phone with a rollup and so when I
write with a pen
sometimes my eye get stuck and like it
takes me long longer to write things
also I have like a very much I don't
think it's I'm not saying I'm Dyslexic
because I would never pretend I'm
something I'm not but I have a hard time
sometimes writing things because I I've
always gotten G's in J's confused like I
don't know the difference when I'm
writing and it's the same thing with 6 &
7 I know that's very strange and every
time I tell people to like what when I
used to work as a cashier like early on
in my life and I have to give people
change I would never know the difference
to you like 67 and 70 6gj 67 76 I'm very
bad at those things and also sometimes
when I'm writing a word like the letters
they won't get super mixed up and I'll
write the second letter first and then
the first letter sounds like it's just a
little bit slower for me to write things
so it takes a little bit of a long time
which is why I always prefer to type
everything but that's what I'm doing
right now I got these cards they got
these stickers and then I got some
handwritten cards this one's for grace
and that's what's going on all right
according to my schedule also streambed
30 minutes ago but it's okay not that
bad not that that's so good
