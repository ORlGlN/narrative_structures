my intros are not even words anymore I'm
not even saying words they were speak
words Lily speak words I'm headed to AMA
story not because we need some costumes
and I'm it I'm not a costume maker a
designer person but when it's your tour
sometimes you just step up and do a
little bit of everything so I'm in a
situation now where I am doing way more
things than I should be doing with homes
I feel like I'm because I woulda way
more things I should be doing I should
be focusing on the creative and learning
my dad set cetera but now I'm like
working on animation and videos and
doing costume look it's okay that's fine
we're gonna do it we're head to our
store right now and it's Mother's Day
and I don't even get to properly spend
time with my mummy but hope I can come
back and spare like two hours before
practice to cuddle with mummy
okay I've got some runs the other half
of the store this half and it's so dope
but he's worked so hard on it
so like I'm really proud of him he's
gonna be in a bit but we need to pick
fabrics that's good yeah so just give up
Mama's store and we got a whole bunch of
stuff done took way longer than it take
what we've got a lot done
I literally just bagged an ID to stitch
something for me again this is not
anything I supposed to be doing but when
it's your show you wear many hats and
you just get the mother if it is done so
that's what's happening right now I'm
heading home I gotta leave specs and
hours and take me like 30 minutes to get
home my 30 minutes talking my mom for
Mother's Day that's my mom I'm pretty
here they know I'm your mom Mother's Day
I didn't get you that's okay but I'm
giving you time now remember this when
you tired because I don't give you time
otherwise okay
the kids in the world remember this you
have to give time yes time is the best
gift we are cuddling I freely for
practice in 17 minutes how do we cuddle
cuddle 17 yeah yeah I was telling my mom
yesterday I'm Scott and then the
documentary peeps the car got broken
into and so much of their equipment got
stolen it was like really bad that is
such a bad impression of Toronto I know
it's not a good it's not a good
reflection Toronto and I've never heard
of anyone else's car getting broken into
ever I have never heard of Tara but I
think they're gonna take from here
there's no but that's not what Toronto's
about tunnels nice and those understand
after seeing all the Toronto song and it
is hot as and being cold is not a
concern right now I must say this entire
past week has been really fun to deal
with this I never go downtown this much
but that's where we practice and I get
stuck in this traffic every single day
so even though it's like technically 30
minutes away I have to leave an hour and
half early and it's just like not fun
but a waiter nice and I like the song
I also like really bummed I do wish I
could have stayed home today I've got
all my family's over it's Mother's Day
wish guys stayed home and like spend
time with them and I really didn't want
to go practice today but I was like I
have to but I'm feeling kind of like I'm
missing out at home right now you know
I'd rather just cuddle my mum's up and
give her the one thing I never got to
give her which is time I can't give her
a gift but she has everything and she
doesn't care what any others she just I
was gonna just give her time spend some
more time but such is life and she's
extremely sweet and understandings
that's fine
alrighty I'll be breaking on the highway
I am stopped on the highway they use it
to Amaya boy dancers and they're so
handsome with this Paolo this is pyro
I'd like to think we're more like men
than boys I take it back now boys men
warriors how about warriors of dance
that's right fire and I actually met a
long time ago York University randomly
random wins destiny right here it is two
artists so we just finished practice
chasin ours having a little mini rants
bunch of dogs talking about not even uh
Jessica um I am less stressed now
because I've gone through all the stress
of choreographing everything like waking
up early morning choreographing and
coming back to Santa chain and repeat
and repeat yeah
so now I only have the Encore in the
ending and a small piece left which I
wasn't supposed to teach anything
tomorrow just be review but we have to
for the first hour there's simple stuff
though and we'll get it done and it'll
be fine now I just have to worry about
remembering the internship yep yep which
is stressful
same-same cuz yeah it doesn't relieve
when you're choreographing you can't
yeah yeah
true but honestly in the bigger scheme
of things we've been in worse situations
than this I feel like we shouldn't be
saying that no I'm just saying in terms
of like the will you spend the same
University dance team we would be like
this is really good what would you I
guess though we were never bad with our
I mean yeah but the fact that tomorrow
will be done learning everything that
never happened on our dancing we've done
the finale the day before every time yes
every single time so we're not we could
be no worse place we're not but yeah
it's been stressful but we'll pull
through it'll make it happen is
definitely I'm still happy with all the
dances on the with me I know she was
there I think there'll be some tension
there'll be some tension
I feel building from this point amongst
like how we think things should go so
hopefully that doesn't or know the
dancers nobody dancers at all they're
wonderful they're all so patient was
like created it meets production yeah
yeah it's like technicals yeah
creativity meeting technicalities yes
true I don't want to drive home myself
oh yeah my legs really hurt don't fall
asleep like keep this morning to this
morning freaking night I had like a
meeting dinner choreographing for the
rehearsal for broken dance and then from
broken dance choreographing for this her
