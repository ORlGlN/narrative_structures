up as a bit of a sore throat but I ain't
sick no no I'm gonna have some vitamin C
right now and call it BAE the only thing
that's wrong with me is a sore throat
I don't know why I keep getting sick my
only guess is that I keep changing from
hot to cold to hot to cold and so now my
body's like what's going on anyways I am
up I woke up at 10 which is quite early
for me to be showered a little bit of
fresh face you know

first one of 26 the first one of the
2016 first ones of 2016 so I want to
make it an epic one that's out there
I've got a bunch of work to do today and
the goal is to not get sick are you in
it with me you're in it you feel me you
feel me leg up not sick not sick it's
not happening it's not happening I was
just sick I don't get to be seen again
I'm going to start working on my Monday
video I keep stretching because I'm not
sick and as long as in because this
vlogs week all the time I was not sick
some to really cool things not my nail
polish obviously I was listed as one of
Forbes 30 under 30 which is so freaking
cool and such a huge honor and I'm so
humbled and so grateful so the Forbes
has lists of 30 people under 30 in
categories like entertainment social
entrepreneurs lifestyle cooking all that
stuff so in entertainment I was a
certain one as one of Forbes 30 under 30
on the same list of lay as like zendaya
and like Emilia Clarke Khaleesi I'm on
the same list as basically I have
dragons where are my dragons I need I'm
you over there get me some dragons I
need some tree somebody get me some
dragons and the second thing is is I was
featured in Seventeen magazine
I'm grabbing one right now and I'm going
to show you what I have in my hand but
like what a good day add that and I'm
not sick oh my god bastard check this
out so in this sul allah in this issue
of Seventeen magazine with Tori Kelly on
the cover yo girl might be in this let
me just jump i'm should have prepped the
page in advance but check this out
that's right that's right becoming
superwoman it's kind of like my career
journey so obviously Duane's there
Selena's there but yeah if you wanna
pick this up it's the issue of Seventeen
magazine with Tori Kelly on the cover
I'm gonna check out your girl and stuff
that's pretty dope also I got my first
meal I don't know if you recall in my
last vlog I said I was going to have a
signal delivery service because it's so
hard to grocery shop of one person i buy
like a loaf of bread I can't finish it a
buy spinach I can't finish it I can't
finish half of stuff so I'm like yo
maybe it's better traffic Emile delivery
service bring me meals that way they'll
be healthy and I won't eat like pudding
for dinner
I don't need pudding forget it that's
ridiculous I all be seen icing so this
is my first one it's tofu salad and
quinoa so I was like this way I won't
waste food I could eat more healthy and
spend more time like doing work and not
pretending I know how to cook and
burning everything and making a mess and
using 17 pots to make a sandwich mmm
all right so what does this mean come on
my hoverboard comment below let's see
how well you know me what does it mean
if I'm on my hoverboard that means I
just had a call I do my conference calls
on our board to keep me in tune what's
going on because it's usually paced
around slowly but surely I'm getting
sick but I'm not but I'm not getting
sick but it's okay I'm not getting super
sick I'm just you know kind of you know
what it is I just drink some water
that's that's it what what what
not happening so I just finish a call I
have another call an hour and a half but
I got a recording a video as well my
video ID I'm thinking about is types of
people on New Year's since we all just
experienced that and we saw all these
types of people and I know how much
y'all like my types of people video I
feel that's my most popular type of
video types of people's y'all like that
video types of people's calm below let
me know let me know I wonder who that
also I would just like to let me rant
for a second here is I just had a called
my immigration lawyer and can I just
express to you that after more than a
year and so much money and so much
paperwork and so much everything even
still after moving here do I have
problems doing certain projects legally
because of visas and green cards and all
this stuff and I still got to go through
so much more fees and so much more
paperwork and so much more everything to
properly work on certain projects here
and as a Canadian I would just like to
say if y'all okay it is so difficult and
I don't understand because Canada
America
we're basically neighbors I could knock
on your door and ask for sugar that's
how close we are yet still there's so
many legalities and so many things that
make it so difficult for me to do what I
gotta do and I would just like to rant
and say yo help Canadian out man help a
Canadian out it shouldn't be this hard
it should not be this hard for me to
want to do certain projects here and
it's totally so difficult and I hope
this process gets easier for many more
generations to come because it is a pain
in the freakin butt a right thing this
is where the pain is in my butt in my
snake skin but alright the time is five
o'clock I'm done all my calls for the
day I'm watching my video the goal is to
figure out how to reduce the echo since
my voice gets projected into all of that
so I'm thinking I need to buy a rug for
here but I use a towel for now or a
blanket if I could put like a blanket
here somehow blocking off I don't know
how I would put it up though let's
figure it out I'm pretty sure this is
really stupid but I think I'm gonna do
anything so there's all this space but
like yo I tried I tried okay just
finished recording I definitely have a
fever I'm like sweating and so hot and
dying but I'm go to edit this ish it's
6:00 so it's not too late and then I'm
gonna go stand in the fridge so what
meeting my second prepared meal of the
day it is um I'm not gonna lie it's like
this the thing is everything is gonna
have to arraign because I don't eat meat
and the only substitute they have is
tofu inside this tofu green pepper red
pepper quinoa salad it's pretty good I'm
not gonna lie it's pretty good so here
we go
this is mostly because I'm not feeling
well it tastes good though I promise
Mortal Kombat good rock music so I was
hoping to come home be like I did better
than yesterday it was easier than
yesterday a little bit easier but I
actually did one calorie less than
yesterday um but it's okay because it
was easier and I had more fun doing it
and it wasn't as like brutal I don't
know how to use half the machines at the
gym also so I'm gonna go do a few more
leg exercises cuz I don't know how to
use any machines I'm gonna youtube
summation Rana hole also in case you're
watching this and wondering I am not
about to vlog my workouts when I do them
at most you'll get if I even do it like
three seconds of me at the gym because I
don't want this to turn into something
like I'm going to the gym so I can vlog
it I'm very against that I guess I'm not
taking any pictures I'm not doing it for
the social media I'm doing it from me so
don't worry if you're watching this nope
that's not gonna happen
I promise you alright just as much as I
could it maybe I didn't do the head well
ride as much as I could I don't wanna
push too too hard because I still feel
bit sick but my plan is to do actually
you know what let's stop talking about

going to read I have a script to read
it's not that long it's all the 86 pages
