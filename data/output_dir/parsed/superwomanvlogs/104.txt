it actually to you right now right here
go on average in the United States full
time working women earn 80 cents for
every dollar earned by men 17 million
women have been the victims of rape
since 1998 99 percent of all
perpetrators of sexual violence will
walk free an estimated
between the age of six and seventeen
fifteen million girls of primary school
age will never enter a classroom every
year about 15 million girls under the
age of 18 are married with little or no
say in the matter
female genital mutilation affects more
than 125 million girls alive today four
out of five victims of human trafficking
are girls one in three women have
experienced physical or sexual violence
at some point in their life I don't want
to grow up in a world like this I
deserve better and girls deserve better
and my sisters deserve better
so do better so do better so do better
let's talk about this real quick because
I knew when I thought of it I'm like
this is gonna be a little controversial
any really young girls to talk about
really intense things like rape and
sexual assault but that was my intention
it was like I want people because makes
me feel uncomfortable you talk about
rape talk about sexual assault things
that are real and really happened in fat
girls people get uncomfortable and I
knew in my mind people are gonna be like
a jungle should not be talking about
this I got permission from everyone's
parents first of all everyone's parents
are fine with me getting them to say
these things and the reason I thought I
was so important for a cute innocent
young girls to talk with these really
intense things is because that is the
reality of the world to grow up in and I
thought that was the very impactful like
contrast I wanted super innocent cute
talking very serious things because when
you watch that as a viewer you feel
uncomfortable and I want people's ask
well why do I feel uncomfortable with
this because that is the reality
situation girls have to grow up in a
world where women get raped and where
99% of sexual predators will walk away
free those are all real facts so if you
feel uncomfortable that is the reason we
need to do better because you felt
uncomfortable it's all true it's
completely fact if anyone felt
uncomfortable or intense watching it
that's the proof you need so need to be
better so I was really really hard with
that piece and how it turned out please
share it and please spread it because
those girls deserve better and all goes
deserve better and all people the planet
deserve better not that the planet is
not an amazing place I feel sometimes
when I say these things that was like
the planet that's a lot of amazing
things as well but there's a lot of
things that girls like these girls
growing up they're just so smart and
they have so much ambition and so much
potential and they shouldn't grow up in
a world where they're just not so much
risk and that's so much disadvantage and
that's not okay and we need to do better
so let's do better all right I'm up I
did not sleep for three hours
for one because I'm in an industry that
wants to suck my soul and crush my body
and not let me ever do anything that is
good for my well-being or mental health
but that's a completely different
conversation
banana intestines I am going to scope or
something real real quick and then I'm
doing a change to my hair and makeup cuz
I'm another event to go to also release
my video even the points and the super
16 been here me two points and now we do
the thing and the thing thing thing I
think we give a warm welcome to the
amazing Lily thing saying oMG I'm
sitting in front of you IRL oh my all

influential people on the Internet okay

intimate setting about girl love I watch
