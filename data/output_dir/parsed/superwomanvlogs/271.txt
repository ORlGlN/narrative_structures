hey thanks for coming over
I wanted to invite you to unicorn Island
to ask you in person
will you bring my poster I'm being
serious to support women through the
incredible work of UNICEF I'm teaming up
with omae's to fly you and a friend all
the way to Singapore to join me on the
final stop of my how to be about book
tour
don't think of it as Lily's going to be
my boss for a day liquidus to bosses are
going to have the best day ever
now I know what you're thinking what
exactly is av AWS a bow good question
a box is like a box but so epic I had to
change themselves a boss a group
confidence turns heads and hustle
relentless ticking of hustle I gotta go
make a video and there you have it
ten reasons like Daenerys is the
ultimate boss I'll see you next time
thanks for waiting on that another thing
about our bosses is that we set gold
mycologist finish shooting a video while
shooting this video we also aim higher
take this experience for example let's
say it started with someone calling me
like hey Lilly
you should fly a fan Oh to LA and spend
the day with them sounds nice but as
about I aim higher well I'm all like
sounds fun but what if you fly into
space and spend a day together on the
moon and then they respond with well
that might cost a billion dollars worth
of something ones I don't remember every
words they'll be compromised I say we're
going Global Television board this is
you and your friends now this is you and
your friends on my vision board just
like that so experience following three
flights to Singapore free hotel
accommodation please limo ride to the
book signing and free love water
oh wait that's a reminder for me another
boss tip you should have drink lots of
water because your body has to keep up
with the hustle and we will be hustling
because it lacks to do
so I'm creating a good environment is
Sookie why am i standing so far away
from you and shouting for no reason at
all
well first I'm not shouting I'm
projecting and second I'm trying to
demonstrate to you that when you take
your seats at the caling theater it's
not going to be like this it'll feel
like this with you sitting there and me
up on stage I just imagine this bridge
wasn't behind me so fast forward you've
seen the show you're holding the copy of
the book I used onstage autographed by
me is that it is this the end is this
the part of the movie where I weep and
send my first ever boss Protege out into
the world come here not yet
because following the event we're going
to celebrate the end of my tour with the
toast heart-to-heart bow the box and
when it's all said and done maybe you'll
be inspired to take the next step
follow cue puppies on Instagram whoo and
leave attention-grabbing sticky the
realms that remind you to mention clicky
and maybe just maybe you'll be inspired
to not just survive this amazing life of
yours but conquer it
unless you're tracking a well in which
case definitely survive yeah so what are
you waiting for click the link or go to
amaze comm slash lose because it isn't
just going to be a day so the hopeful
thoughts fluffy quotes and mac and
cheese map who's gonna be an epic
Odyssey filled with celebration
self-discovery and the best mac and
cheese a vibe remember and the best part
is we have the chance to empower more
super women around the world because no
matter who wins every entry supports the
women and girls aided by UNICEF so
really we all win I hope to see you in
