I'm gonna try to not make this a 35
minute video but honestly no promises I
preface its practice this with your
order you already you're already doing
it let me preface this with I don't
really like making these kinds of videos
because I know when you see things like
this people automatically soon
clickbait you're doing this for days no
I just I like to do comedy positive
things but this is my blog channel and
this is not gonna be a typical vlog I'm
not gonna be like one thing everyone I'm
not gonna yell and scream and do my
mission and just I just want to talk I
want to talk to you all about how I'm
feeling because that's why I started
this vlog channel I started as an outlet
to connect with all of you and I guess
the way to start this is very the
opposite of what you're used to seeing
as which is very this positive unicorn
but today I am sad I am a sad person
today let me paint you a picture first
before I get into what we're about to
discuss and that is you know if you know
anything about me you know that I have
been making videos since 2010
I have always prioritized YouTube in my
life I've been such a passionate
advocate for the digital space and
particularly for YouTube literally my
face was on a billboard promoting
YouTube in so many cities around the
world but I think you know today
something happened that happens happen
many many times and that is you know
discussions with my team where whether
it's my team or my family or my friends
or companies or brands there's always a
conversation of like how much time we're
going to spend on YouTube versus all the
other stuff you have to do and I've
always been an advocate for saying
YouTube has a great community my
audience is on YouTube I'm so loyal to
team super that watches my videos that's
why the amount of hours I put into
YouTube it's a lot a lot of hours into
the writing and the shooting and all
that stuff and I love it because I
believe in the YouTube space so much why
I am sad today is because it is becoming
increasingly more difficult for me to
justify why I'm putting so much time
into you too and that makes me very very
sad before I get into why that is let me
preface this and I mean this from look
just the absolute depth of my soul and I
also really frame too low and on my head
is getting cut out ah after so many
hours on YouTube you can't get this
right
can adjust this chair go down no it's
closer goes goodbye
you win let me just preface what I'm
about to say with this and I mean this
from the absolute like I I'm not saying
this because I think I have to said I
really mean it
I Love You Tube I cannot express to you
how YouTube has changed my life when I
started making videos I was depressed I
felt lonely I did had nowhere to turn to
and I found a family and community and a
purpose on YouTube it has given me a
career that is unimaginable and made so
many impossible things possible for me
and I will forever be grateful and for
that reason you will not see me slant I
was sitting on my hair just now sorry
about chickened out you will not see me
slander YouTube and never publicly say
you will not see that happiness I just
have the utmost respect for the people
that create that platform what the
platform is this is not about bashing
YouTube at all it's just about telling
you how I feel and that is that YouTube
has changed a lot since I started in
2010 this is not the first time you've
probably heard of this I know there's
many other creators that have talked
about this just a lot of youtubers have
been really really frustrated recently
myself included so weird balance because
I don't want to be entitled I know that
YouTube doesn't have to pay creators you
know no one said hey when you upload
videos you have a right to get paid for
them no YouTube is a privately owned
platform they can be like yeah upload
videos after yourself you're not getting
paid so I'm so grateful that the created
jobs and I don't feel entitled to
getting paid but some of my current
frustrations lie in the fact that there
was just no clarity into how to be
successful on YouTube and I've been
doing this for seven years and for a lot
of those years I figured out kind of my
voice and figured out what kind of
worked into the work and what I enjoy
doing and over the past year that is all
gone to hell I have no idea how viewers
see my videos I have no idea why some of
my videos do so so well and some of them
do so so horribly
there's just no pattern to what is
happening in essentially my business and
Skerritt I hit them like it is scary and
it's frustrating and I don't imagine
going into work every day and being like
if I do the same thing as my last
successful video eat my two horribly and
I don't know what it's just scary
I don't know how YouTube's algorithms
work I don't know if people see my
videos I don't know how they see my
videos I don't know what channels are
being promoted I don't know why some
channels are being promoted more than
others there's just no answers and
that's scary to me and if I'm really
honest this is me being a really honest
with you candid I don't have an ego
right now I don't all that aside this is
me being like a really vulnerable human
being with you for a lot of the year
I beat myself up before I literally have
a sticky note I just this wasn't even a
planned prop and literally have a stick
you know right here I don't know if it's
in focus but it says you are good enough
and I literally had to write this on a
stick you know today and stare at it
because that's how much I was beating
myself up over this like for half of the
year gonna be like you're not funny
you're relevant your content sucks today
but then it's also like some of my
Instagram videos do better than the
exact same video that I posted on
YouTube so I had to really teach myself
like there's a whole lot of things you
cannot control here that you are beating
yourself up over and it's not all about
views but views do contribute to
finances which contributes to the
success of a creators business so yes it
does matter and if you are sitting there
and being like oh it's all about the
views your sell out your superficial you
are being naive because you and your
parents go to work to make money and so
do creators I haven't been a victim to
this much it's happened to me a few
times but there's a lot of creators if
those videos are getting D monetized
incorrectly
there hasn't been a any solution to that
it's not very comforting when you think
about your business and the longevity of
your business on a platform in which
there's no solution for you losing a
whole bunch of money but videos being
incorrectly monetized there's a lot of
things going on but that's my business
standpoint okay when it comes to why I
started YouTube but it's not about views
I started YouTube because I was sad and
YouTube made me happy and even still
creating videos makes me happy so like a
lot of the decisions I've been making on
my channel recently mein Chan
I know I write the script I literally
look at it and I'm like to my team this
is not going to get views and that
doesn't matter because I love this idea
and that still is a passion within me
but what is really burning me personally
business aside is the fact that I love
to tell stories
I love to do comedy I like to put
powering messages into my comedy I don't
care what anyone else does on the
platform I in the in the respect of like
I'm not gonna say your content is good
and bad and that's not what but I would
be lying if I said it is not extremely
discouraging to see something that has
such an empowering message be compared
to distracts you know like as a creator
for me that's a lot that's a hard pill
to swallow
whether it's people's comments which I
know it I can't control people's
comments also just about like what's on
the trending page or what YouTube
chooses to promote and chooses to
highlight it's a hard pill for me to
swallow as a creator and maybe that's a
little bit of my ego being completely
honest because I can't in my good
conscious look at someone's content and
say that's bad no everyone creates
things and there's an audience for
everything so maybe that's something I
need to work on but it is discouraging
maybe I'm just a naive because when I
started YouTube you know it was Ryan
Higa there was DOM there was Suzy there
was Kings there's Jenna this just
positive smart content and over the last
year I've become a little less proud if
I have the right to say that and forgive
me if you think that's arrogant but I've
been a little less proud of what the
YouTube community has become because
it's not a positive place there's a lot
of irresponsible content online and it's
just a bad representation of the
potential I know YouTube and its
creators has and that's what bothers me
the most you know when I go on Twitter
and I see a moment that's like just
today youtuber has to call higher trucks
and ambulances cuz he cements his head
to a microwave because he want to get
views like that we're just so much
better than that you know and it breaks
my heart
tragus but it's gonna be so long I'm
sorry but this is coming from
even YouTube rewind and I need to just
emphasis upon so many comments about
people being so disappointed in rewind
and let me just put everyone in check
rewind is a hard video to make no matter
what they do in YouTube rewind people
are gonna complain so let's just cut
them some slack right off the bat okay a
lot of people like you should have got
more time in YouTube rewind and I'm
gonna shut that down right now listen I
will never complain about how much time
I get in YouTube rewind I was beyond
they made me Beyonce and last year's
where you want it would be selfish and
ignorant and arrogant for me to sit here
and be like I got two seconds in YouTube
every creator deserves their chance to
shine I not and I mean this nothing
makes me happier than the fact that
YouTube rewind opening was lay lain lies
are there
I want those women to win everyone
deserves their spotlight and for that
reason I love YouTube rewinds but when I
watched it and I know all of my creator
friends and all the amazing things they
do and how they helped so many people
may impact the world and although
youtuber Ryan had a positive message at
the end which I adored to see just what
was highlighted and and the slime and
the few speakers that he's just so does
a heart and to see that because I was
like really that's that's what YouTube
has to show for the year it was just
maybe I'm wrong I don't know but it
really broke my heart but let me get to
the actual core of what this video is
about it is actually not about YouTube
YouTube is a phenomenal platform full of
people trying their best to navigate
this online sensation that has so much
content uploaded they're doing their
best I'm sure of it
this is actually about you and me
because this has always been my top
priority anyone on my team can vouch for
the fact that I am so protective of the
priority that I've placed upon you
because you are one of my biggest
priorities you've given me everything
I mean you've given me this house and
yes I've worked hard for but it's also
because of your support and I know that
and so I guess I don't know what I'm
trying to say this video I'm not I'm not
announcing that I'm quitting I'm not
saying anything but I am just
wanting to let you know how I feel and
it might explain some of the decisions
I'm going to make none of that I've
decided upon but it might explain why
I'm doing the things I'm doing and why I
speak the way I speak and if down the
line you know I ever feel like I can't
do this anymore I want you to know that
it's not because and I'm choking up
little because I love you this much it's
not because I don't care about you I
will never abandon you the people that
watch my videos even if I'm like yo I'm
gonna upload once a week or like I can't
I can't sustain my business on YouTube I
can't do it's never ever because I'm
abandoning you everywhere I go in life I
want you to come with me I really really
do that's the point of this video the
point of this video is you I love you so
much but it's hard on YouTube right now
so not announcement of like me not
uploading and I'm still an upload videos
I'm in the middle of my talk love's
Christmas but I don't know how much
longer I can do what I am currently
doing I'm gonna keep doing things I
don't know what those things are gonna
be but I hope you're there and you
should know I love you if ever in the
future you're like why do I feel ill II
do this maybe you could defer back to
this video because it's me being the
most candid real version of myself and
what I'm thinking and the immense
pressures that have been placed on me as
a human being as someone who has
experienced the highs and highs of
YouTube I don't know I I don't think
it's sustainable to try to be the top
atop of YouTube in such an unpredictable
environment and I think having that
internal pressure is not healthy and I
don't want to do that so I hope you're
okay not being on the trending page all
the time hope you're okay with whatever
decisions I make and I want to be happy
so be with me and let's be happy this is
how I feel I'm sure many other creators
can relate creators going through a hard
time
you should message all of your favorite
creators and tell them you F and
appreciate them and you appreciate their
work regardless of where it goes because
believe it or not and now I'm just
rambling but a lot of creators probably
have this fear where they upload videos
because they're like we don't want to
abandon our
and our audience is probably never going
to understand the obstacles are going
through right now but tweet them and let
them know you do understand because each
is hard I know these are all privileged
problems but do their problems down
nonetheless and some of the pressures
I've felt over the past six months like
I don't know how I stood sometimes
literally I love you so much it's stupid
literally I love you so much it's stupid
so
