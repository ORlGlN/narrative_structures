what
Oh morning and stress Terry's house
because this trip is all about people
taking me into their homes because I'm
disorganized and pathetic anyways um
it's so funny we're working and I'm
sending emails and because series like
my main homie I like Google here too
she's on all emails so like literally
I'm setting USS Harry was sitting right
there and we're sending emails back to
each other it's a funny thing but my
plans for today are renting a car
getting my own place for the next week I
decided to stay for a week longer and
functioning like a real human being
that's the goal here today you might
also eat some food in between there Oh
Chipotle series I magically we need to
change this yes yeah
it's been 25 vlogs I'm wearing the same
clothes when I'm so disoriented the
strip ah my check-in time got delayed
from my apartment so now I'm even more
of a nuisance to say but we're heading
to jump all day and feel experience to
pull away for the first time and she
asked a valid question I don't ask like
oh so like a burrito Mignogna people
think the burritos what's up but not the
rice bowl is where it's at it's the rice
bowl
y'all need to invest in and she's an
understand why momentarily
also discovered Siri loves to blast a
seize every time with Sarah I'm like let
it go
very good I have a bet with Siri because
I don't think she can finish her whole
rice bowl but she claims you can um so
our wager is that if she finishes the
whole thing on a poster selfies saying I
was wrong she was right and in defeat
I read okay she can't a rifle is really
big it looks deceiving it's very
phillium very big I'm not able to finish
my own rice school but we go see we go
see so did she do done done whoa okay
wait hold on I'm full going I'm Brad I
was wrong
and she was right I'll pull something
I'll pull something I lost the bet I
don't even finish mine god damn god damn
god damn god damn it's so cool sitting
here because series doing a bunch of
work and all the work is related to me
so I'm sitting here eating chapolin
she's sending all these emails about me
and my business and all the stuff and
I'm like here's scratching my butt and
she's like doing great
alright let's talk about my life real
quick and how disappointed I am in the
beginning of this trip I just went to a
car I spent all day at Sarah's house my
place got postponed couldn't couldn't go
yeah I whatever the last few days I've
been staying at people's houses and I'll
tell you why I'm trying to avoid booking
an air B&B in a hotel because every time
I come here I don't have a place imagine
living half of your life in a place we
don't have a car and you don't have an
apartment I spent thousands of dollars
on apartments and hotels and cars and
all this stuff so I try to prevent that
and I am just at the point where my I
can't do that anymore because I can't
get any work done when I'm not in my own
place and I got make videos and he had
two ecstatic cetera I'm so disappointed
myself I got an apartment I got a card
like shut up
be a real human being be responsible and
it all ends today
I'm going to my apartment and marry work
done and these car rental people are
like looking at me oddly and I'm gonna
go now basically it's tomorrow alright
hello we'll talk about this later I have
a car I'm gonna I'm a person now so I'll
talk more about this it ends now

was saying stops here Lily stops your
Jazz's back things can be back on track

just wanna I'm not slack but it is my
fault it's my fault for thinking that I
can like get away with like crashing
people's houses grab I don't know I know
you ran gone on about this is because
I'm up to set up myself
I'm upsetting myself I'm upsetting
myself I need to hurry up and move here
