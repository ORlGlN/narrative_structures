around to people everything happened
very very productive what is happening

I'm gonna get ready and I'm gonna go
there I've slept in today sleeping in
with beautiful I was so happy I so knew
that it's kind of gloomy outside it's
not too funny but it's all good so far
very productive day tomorrow a collab is
coming out so when you're watching this
right now a collab was coming out two
days you know the great thing more talk
clouds biggest ask me about this okay so
last in previous years I used to release
the dates in advance if you'd like you
know clapboard to do horizon Sunday that
coming on in these days and that was
horrendous because anything ever went
wrong I was accountable to that date
this year however I learned I learned
and I said I'm not releasing your dates
and this cloud was actually supposed to
come out two days ago but some stuff
went down and it was rushed and so we
could it so blessed my genius brain my
brain it's in there genius brain we're
not doing that I'm not you something I'm
a get ready cause it's holiday party
around a great productive day that's was
cracking I can't let daughters hang you
on the note of the collab that's coming
out today honestly I tried to cut the
video down in so long I tried to shut
down but it's still in for 15 minutes
and here's the thing that I don't love
it but it's a very long video so I don't
know that's a good decision but I want
you over and over again and 100% this
video is for me it is for me I didn't
know we all will know the person to be
honest but this person I am a huge fan
and I died meeting this person so this
is one of those things I'm like this
video
10% made to make one of my dreams come
true can we just take them all right me
okay and see my set design then I got
the camera here put the tree right there
right and then I put the presents over
there and stuff is my camera not
focusing it didn't you want to comment
like this focusing because G okay scale
check hold on yeah those focus on the
focus look at this in this ice tag here
and use corner would show I put some
stuff there David cup with candy canes
yes my house is still looking like this
I've decided I'm going to buy my own
Christmas tree which is monumental
because I never had my own Christmas
tree I've always had metrics of shoes my
family at my house so they were saying
I'll just keep one of these ones but I
was like no I need to go to the pasta
but going to the store standing there
picking my own I could see one of these
ones but here's the thing
I don't really like how the end and as
you can see in the camera it doesn't
really like it in the camera but yeah
but white tips at the end which is kind
of cool this looks way greener in the
camera that it actually looks in real
life it doesn't look as green but then I
was like you know I never in my life
have had high ceilings and look how my
space I have I feel like a really big
tree in the corner cuz I love Christmas
so after disappears out I mean even
today that time I'm going to buy my
first in a pillow of my arm is vlogging
