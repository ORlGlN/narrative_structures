you cuz I'm gonna be doing super six in
my last video I was so annoyed that
age-restricted because the word boobs
and it's not about the views but I think
the video really really suffered because
not because it was age restricted for
like 11 hours I'm just like even though
but that's okay because today's video is
gonna make up for Internet if you liked
it subscribe if you like it subscribe

there's like a hundred thousand you go
watch this on the first day right get
your girl ever freaky and pin we're
almost that 15,000 were like a thousand
way from our goal is in October 11th is
when the campaign ends if the fraction
of you watch this do this we can meet
that goal and send even more girls to
school so if you haven't done it yet and
you're gonna do it do it girl off home
