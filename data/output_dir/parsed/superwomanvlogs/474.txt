you isn't bad that I've watched my Lion
King book reveal like 4,000 times and
every time I watch it
I laugh like I just sit by myself watch
and I start laughing I came up with this
idea and I was like you'll have a I
don't want to do it I had a serious
video that's really deep and sentimental
and I launched the book was a flick
cover reveal anyone who's gone to the
pre-order site like it's very similar to
what's on there so I'm like I just
wonder something fun and I think is like
really dramatic and hilarious so I was
thinking a few ideas first I was going
to do a parody of like Harry Potter's
Chamber of Secrets when he writes in the
book and then it responds back but there
was like you really could
maduk village what if my book was Simba
like I've watched in the Lion King
trailer like chopped up I central editor
and I was like can you put my face on
pasta and like can you make Simba the
book and then I like bought the stuffed
animals and I was like yo I must stand
here and he's had this whole thing in my
head and it turned out that it is such a
good dog turned out a thousand times
better than I thought I was going to and
it's just like one of those little brain
babies that I had here and to see it
come to life just a small little video
it just brings me so much joy I think
it's hilarious and I've watched a
million times
and I laughed by myself every single
time so I'm very happy about it here in
case you haven't don't know I'm talking
about on my instrument main channel
video is my final book cover how to be a
boss but this is not back for a book
it's like a fake book this is the cover
um and I'm very excited about it because
I tweaked the F out of this in terms of
like which facial expression I liked how
I wanted my hair to be because there's
like 500 options and they're like what
color I wanted this and like this part
just like everything about it
I told it's like touch up the ring here
I was like I want the ring to me more
bolts like every detail down to my
mascara I was like I want to be perfect
and that's why I have the month of my
plate that says world's best boss so if
you want to preorder my book releasing
book.com is where you can do that I'm
very excited to see the final cover and
I hope you all like it I've gotten a
