Minneapolis City Twitter social campaign
okay cold I've been briefed a wee day
like sighs I'm very excited to the mold
America under the lineup already I
thought increase about it I'm really
here my ears are plug so we have a
decent amount of time swaps do anything
right that's five hours so you have to
be
and your hotel though but it isn't light
years better like is look at this light
to 24-hour room service
oddly she's everything I need in one so
overjoyed right now so tonight's menu is
gonna be a little bit interesting cuz
it's a mall it's Mall of America which
means that there's no seats you are
standing at a mall many layers so
there's not like really a backstage I
don't think or a side stage or like I
feel really way out of my comfort zone
so I'm gonna be like okay okay second
show so I completely comfortable it's
gonna be a little interesting but it's
cool I'm excited about any woman lined
up for so long and I don't think so easy
to see on Twitter pictures of people
lined up they go cool whoa but I want to
actually think about yo people have
uprooted their day literally their day
so people are sleeping there 2ch almost
if you really think about that like
that's some amazing dedication thank you
so much I remember when I used to do
that to like meet like wrestlers back in
the day and I was like wait in line for
so many hours I would be so excited to
meet them to think that static certain
people have to meet me I first don't get
it be I'm so grateful and see just you
make me feel so special thank you so so
much I'm gonna do some work do some
rehearsal eat something and then we're
gonna kill the game bless up this hotel

higher here we think not and ice goes
this place the way the technician is
going down all these lights and
everything

screen while you look at this every
direction to make your life easier ah
the things that turned me on
yeah i'ma have to cancel my show to a
chance on my show for tonight yo guess
what's the hustle of that to try not to
do this thing called Canada reason she's
like a reality elimination shows very
Canadians very nice result book and he
was one of the contestants you just won
almost won the whole damn show I work to
heaven right now congratulations so far

intelligent person I've ever been my
life said that same concepts of involved
I exerted more molecules like I said
that Mario Kart not not a contestant but
I bet you what you're a couple showers
always me up in my boy okay I would see
what Toronto I'm so proud of you
here's why I struggle to be healthy in
hotels because whether the rooms are
ascending the vegetarian options are
always pizza and pasta they're never
going to have like obviously with the
meat replacement that at home with like
the veggie chicken and the veggie fish
I'm never gonna have that so like this
issue I run into every single time and
there's nothing I can do about it I feel
so thus it's completely fine that I'm
not ordering pizza cuz I have a choice I
just want to let you know that I have no
choice
so can I share something with you isn't
really really touched me today I woke up
because I was like I got tweet being has
people are leaving negative reviews on
Amazon because they get a signed copy
and I got instantly stressed you know my
babies on their side and side not all
the copies on Amazon are sign so unless
you buy a sign what you're not gonna get
a signed one but then I went to Amazon
and I read some reviews and on Amazon
first of all it's a best-seller thank
you so much but I was reading some of
these reviews and more than anything
like I don't want this book to do well
just because you are fans of mine I
really really like them so passion with
the content of it when people speaking
about the content of the book it's very
happy and some of the comments are just
so oh I really love this comment like

I don't want Easy Street I don't want
people to support me because my videos
this morning I woke up and I had a tweet
with a negative review of my book and I
was like a little bit like food but a
baby but then I was also like yo this is
great we're all evolving we're all
learning and this is me stepping Souls
out of my comfort zone where I'm going

didn't want to wait right now through
the W yeah yeah how are we traveling
with you yeah yeah alright so this show
can be a little bit challenging I'm a
big believer of shows have a lot of
energy and a lot of magic when you're in
a confined space which is why I never do
stand-up I YouTube FanFest and then
everything motivational speaker or
anything in large outdoor venues is
always like theaters this is the mall I
think it's the biggest mall in America
the stage in the middle of the mall and
where the stage is there's many tiers of
people can see me on different floors so
it's not a confined space which is
difficult but it's going to be
challenging our up for challenge you
know me challenges are nerve-wracking
and stressful but they always make you
grow and life is about growing so we
should look cooler minneapolis Mall of
America me about to go on stage in 30
minute we will conquer case show neck oh
