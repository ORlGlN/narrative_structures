this is too hard my friend Tia brought
me is Game of Thrones coloring book I
also have one in LA and I haven't used
it ever but she told me that I have to
use it and also it's very good for you
let's be like anti stressful and nothing
I'm stressed right now but I'm gonna
actually color a page out of this
because haven't done yet and I want to
listen to some music and color little so
I'm gonna show you I went through all
the pages and I decided which one I want
to color and I decided on this one which
is very appropriate for Toronto says
winter is coming and all of them are
like a really super detailed let's do it
I attend so crayons are double-sided
thanks TIA that's so cool
also just realize I know if I own a
sharpener on blasphemies a pencil like a
pencil had to be sharpener use I use
these LED ones
can I use like my makeup sharpener is
that a bad idea hmm my sense is being
problematic all right this is my current
progress this would be a really long
time and I know this a good thing about
that cuz I'm like I have to finish it or
I can't move on especially leisurely but
like look how detailed this ish is so I
think this is a good spot to stop maybe
I'll do the banner or one more thing
I'll call a day I just finish it no no

hours coloring the coloring book come on

gonna take we're done the page says
well-staged this page say every noble
house has its words family models mottos
motive models models without models is
felt
touch-tones pairs of sorts they boasted
they boasted of Honor as case written

boasted of honor and glory promised
loyalty and truth swore faith and
courage but all but the Starks winter is
coming said the stark or so said this
star quartz cake can I not read this is
so strangely written a Game of Thrones
