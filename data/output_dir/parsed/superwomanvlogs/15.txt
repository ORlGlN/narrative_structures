life and I don't like that I like good
vibes good energy whole bunch of like
trash in my life right now I'm just like
I got time for that I want to create and
I want to do dope things with dope
people make memory I don't time for this
BS or have time for ego in trauma and
nonsense but I feel there's a lot of
that currently and it's part of
businesses whatever but it's just a lot
and I'm just like you can leave now so

my anxiety taken away right now just
everything is so up in the air but yeah
