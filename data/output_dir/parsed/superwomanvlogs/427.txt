then me recently just kind of driving in
the uber and being like oh I didn't

some deep fish right there you're not
getting used to everything though I was
very modest my pecans like one of the
best but worst features of humans is how
you get used to things no matter what it

all time it's my neck I don't know my
neck is not a strong neck I'm a weak
neck I'm getting a little bit of
migraine have a massage booked I've
cooked a book stuff but I'm thinking
just a little wee nap too small when my
videos out so that's you know that's the
thing I did and you know what it is
maybe I shouldn't take a nap but then at
the same time like as I say this I'm
clearing the sofa but you're also
clearing the sofa because I don't want
to sit in my bed because then that I'll
be too comfortable and it's not like I'm
coming and I'm getting a pillow from my
bed because that would be stupid because
that would just be making the sofa as
comfortable as my bed I'm not I'm not
gonna take a nap I'm not gonna lie down
I'm not gonna do any of that stuff
