when your socks in your backpack that
accordin 8 a.m. you look fine look at
you I can see you outside you look on
this morning afternoon evening night
written your crap whatever you're doing
room 5 good morning the time is 11 I
believe all supposed to leave 30 months
ago I'm 30 minutes late disclaimer I'm
30 minutes late but it's okay because we
have a productive day I need to stretch
and eat first before I start my daily to
be showers my body clean with a point
okay there's the mission for today we
are going to do some breakfast we're
going to go to the studio 71 studios and
I'm shooting two videos today so video 1
video 2 video 1 is going to be really
really hectic but you're to learn as
much as we can some home eat dinner
somewhere after that course do my one to
three rounds emails today I'm shooting
so much just be one round at the very
very end of the day we'll see and then
we'll see when I get home we'll see
we're gonna do aside from all of that I
say this every time I would love to do
some house stuff a time permitting
should be back home at like 8:30 so I
think it's possible but stay tuned for
the adventure that is this level and
this day in the video game that is my
life so you should make a compilation of
the beginning of all my vlogs I feel
like I'm just a freak an energetic freak
and environment tsunami like I'm
carrying clam and kya heinie
but for this beginning clip let's do it
you know you have the best team in the
entire world when you come down to see
breakfast and this is on the kitchen
because they know I'm going to wear wigs
and I always have my head heard they
were like where wig and they put to add
for the best team ever
my handle have a good day he later just
started our morning with Game of Thrones
series we're nerds
you're a nerd I'm a nerd murdered by
some prelate right now but you know what
I'm not gonna do I'm not gonna get into
that frazzled like weirdness these rush
no because I hate being in that mindset
when I'm shooting on shooting it's okay
we'll make up the time somehow there's
no need to be frazzled fun and
productivity because the priorities
let's head to the studio
here we are we made it we're a little
late doesn't matter already said that's
1157 no big deal to start shooting in
three minutes huh huh
days like this so I'm like why does my
brain work like this please like make
this joke we're like let me write this
super complicated script that's going to
get significantly less views and that's
okay because it's not about the music
now you're gonna be like why do you keep
bringing it up it's because 50/50 rule
I'm trying to grade it into my brain but
it's essentially what we're doing is it
a peep say what upside when I went up
the nine people so we're putting sticky
notes in places that we know the
characters are going to be we are going
to try to whip from me too me too me too
me too me too me too me a lot of Me's
more tire back there try our best to
what to make it happen whip and then
shall we Nene he's like I don't
understand the reference I'll explain it
to you don't worry so turning to the
first character no idea I think I have
an idea kind of actually large enough
but no idea how it's actually gonna turn
out so the really short wig so
essentially what I do it a lot of people
have this question through in Game of
Thrones times they were like how did you
get your hair into that wig a lot of
times I just braid it and put it down my
back because there's no way my hair will
fit into like a boys wig so let's see
what happens to the characters
good go let's see what this character is
going to become does a director look
like a lot of you like this wig this is
the same wig as the commercial guys a
cell phone provider commercial cut and
while you were like oh Kyle was like my
wing I envisioned this character based
it off of Abraham from the walking dead
so see how it turns out this wasting
time
fabulous me stress the most unrealistic
person when it comes to time we're done
the first scene of the first video and
it is 4:40 we're supposed to the video
by 5 so clearly I think only 1 we are
going on zip that's ok but I want to
rush want to be productive but fun and
there's no need to rush so we think if
anything I can just do tomorrow after
two day off technically I get to shoot
them so it is one of these pomegranate
mint grain rabbit-bird fruit salad
whenever lunch now we rushing because we
find because we have 20 minutes left to
get a seed and a half and it's ok it's
so fun but I also broke a piece of glass
soaking down you select you stick to the
camera only one thing that makes it feel
really lonely
is that something goes wrong and I don't
know of a solution for it but I know
like my mom or dad would so I'm driving
home I hear this noise and I'm like what
the hell is that noise so I pull over
and there's a ginormous nail in my tire
so I go into a gas station like am I was
a drive with this kind of Drive with
this I have no idea so I drove home and
I think like I need to go to the auto
shop to get this fix let me show you is
during it look at that nail I don't like
blood wake my data I have no idea how to
handle the situation right now go home
but I want my mommy and daddy no don't
know so much stuff kind of bomb I only
got one video shop it's no one's fault
which is a really hard script that I
wrote now I'm like maybe I made it too
complicated maybe I shouldn't have done
that there's still some mustache on my
face or that's just natural I don't know
yeah but I was trying saying me my team
were like standing down from a vocal we
have done different I think we need more
pas more production assistants or
production assistant just like I don't
know I don't know it was a rough shoot
but it's so fun but it's rough we're
less crapload of things need to unload
another thing is that we lose part of
our sermon every single time we shoot
whether the lens cap was this is just so
many moving parts when we shoot we're oh
my oh my gosh it's constantly getting
punched in the face is what it is but
bless life still an awesome job we will
figure it out get better each time we
will figure it out
part of my dragons another first of all
problem my company is growing at an
alarming rate or like I don't have
enough place in my office anymore of
this new house for my team and like the
closet it's just I can't the props are
just exploding out of places the
costumes like won't fit there anymore
just think I need to clean out the
closets and the rest of the
like the patio ones and stuff like
there's too much stuff there's too much
equipment and stuff like that like my
office cannot accommodate anymore so
it's a really problem solved but now I
need to wash my hands lentil burger
