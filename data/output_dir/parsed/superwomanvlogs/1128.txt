what up everyone it's your girl
superwoman time is it 4:30 a.m. no big
deal
energy drinks aren't bad for you I'm so
sorry I know this video is late I know
I'm supposed to upload it a few hours
ago I've had such a hard time deciding
the winners for this contest so please
forgive me before we get into the Nitty
Gritty of things I really truly deeply
want to say thank you so so much to
everyone who participated in project
positive I can assure you this will be
the first of many project positive
challenges to come I have a lot of ideas
and a lot of ways in which I'd love to
try to make the world a better place
just through my small little teensy ways
and so thank you to everyone who took
part in the first one and I hope you
continue to take part in all the future
ones to come and you're awesome and
they're great and watching your videos
totally made me smile I kind of
explained the feeling watching them I
was laughing smiling I'm not gonna lie
sometimes I want to cry like they
touched me so much and it was just such
a great experience watching your videos
you are all awesome
I cannot believe the effort that some of
you put into your walls and in making
your videos and some of you had me on
your wall pictures of me and the
Superman logo and just wow
that is totally flattering I'm so
honored that I'm part of your day and
then I'm on your wall in your room and
just no words I'm gonna let you in on a
little teensy weensy secret when I
started this project I really expected
to get 10 maximum 15 20 video responses
so my idea all along was to not choose a
winner at all I really wanted to pick
everyone and send everyone something and
make everyone a winner because how can
you say someone's wall is better than
someone else's you can so it was never
even my intention to pick a winner
gotcha but I got over 60 video responses
and I totally wasn't expecting that so
as much as it pains me I do have to pick
certain winners and I really really
don't want to because that wasn't the
plan and like I said how can I Who am I
to be like Oh your wall is better than
your one so I really want to
that no one's wall and no one's video
was better than anyone else's they were
all totally awesome I mean it makes you
happy and you smile so how can it not be
good or worse or better than someone
else's do want to say I'm not just
saying this because you know it sounds
good and whatever no truly you are all
winners I mean you've created something
that represents you and makes you happy
how could you be a loser
not to mention they're from all parts of
the world I got video responses from all
over India all over Canada the US all
over the UK and just different parts of
the world and I just don't have that
much money to send stuff to everyone and
so reluctantly I picked ten winners just
based on you know who I felt has been
through something although I it's hard
to judge that from a video but who I
feel it will mean the most to and who I
feel has been through something and you
know it might mean a lot to them to to
get this and so that's the best I
could've done I'm so sorry like I said
you are all winners I have watched every
single video response I have commented
on every single videos response and I
have liked every single video response
so I've definitely seen everything so
here goes the ten winners of Project
positive challenge one wall of
motivation if I do say your YouTube

did this awesome intro to the video and
just had it was just beautifully done
and you're seeing like a super super
sweet guy so thank you so much once
again for doing this and all I could
ever ask is that forget the contest I
forget the contest in winners forget all
the only thing I wanted you to realize
is that positivity and happiness is
important and it's something that can't
be ignored and it's something we should
work at and small things like putting up
these quotes and pictures in your room
can make you feel good about your doing
good about life and being happy is
important that's all I wanted to show
you and so I hope that you felt
something doing this project and it
inspires you and motivated you and if it
did all I can ever ask is that you share
that positivity and happiness with
someone else where there's a family a
friend and help make the world just a
brighter place one smile at a time I
really want to end off on this note
the sound really corny but I don't care
going to say anyways because I really
believe it the reason I'm so big on
happiness and positivity is because it's
not like money it's not like jobs you
know it's not like a lot of other things
in the world because it's not limited
there's enough of it to go around for
everyone it's not like money where I'm
pouring you're rich or you know you're
poor I'm rich because when it comes to
happiness and positivity everyone can be
rich there doesn't have to be any losers
I mean the world is so busy fighting
over land and resources and money when
there is something that all of us can
share equally which is happiness and
positivity which is what matters most in
life so that's the message I want to
send to you is that sharing happiness
and positivity someone doesn't mean you
have any less of it everyone's a winner
and so I know you guys have seen my
wallet positivity motivation in most of
my videos it's not here but it's
upstairs in my room with all my pictures
but I'm going to show you now my
ultimate wall of inspiration and
motivation that is never before been
seen exclusive Tings and I'm going to
show it to you right now are you ready
for this this is just to prove to you
that your wall of happiness doesn't have
to stop keep adding to it make it
awesome make yours and continue to let
it motivate you this is my eight by ten
foot motivational wall that I care
around with me every time I go to gigs
are going to do motivational speaking or
going to school or whatever so keep on
building that motivational wall and
spread the joy so until next time mwah
stay positive that's a wrap superheroes
