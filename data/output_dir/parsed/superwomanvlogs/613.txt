what is even happening all right first
of all the time is 1:30 and I just got
out of bed I woke up at 9 to release the
vlog I went back to sleep I needed to
sleep to make up for all the lack of
sleep I got in that haunted hotel where
I couldn't sleep in and I woke up to the
news that prince has passed away and I'm
like holy crap yesterday China today
Prince Legends role models just don't
understand actually just texted Dwayne a
short text and I was like just once they
have a good day and take care of
yourself because too many role models of
disappearing deep text xoxo
because like oh my god these are
legendary people that have like changed
the world and it's very sad and are very
heavy hearted and I admittedly I knew of
princes music but I don't think I don't
think I'm I think I'm a bit young to
know if it's like real time when he had
like a lot of tracks out so I don't feel
a few of his songs I definitely know of
him like award shows and how he always
had so much swag and he was such a
presence everywhere he went so rest in
peace I just emotional few days man the
world is like a little bit shook but
we're gonna try to be positive we're
gonna celebrate the lives of these
people and also like reminder like I
mentioned in yesterday's vlog the life
is precious life is short these people
did such amazing things with their time
however short on this planet and it is
our duty to do amazing things with every
day we're on this planet just like
Prince just like China they had 24 hours
in a day and so do we so I'm gonna take
it's a positive thing celebrate their
life trying to as much as we can today
moving on from that I realized yesterday
when I edited the vlog I actually didn't
tell you about my experience of reading
Sierra or Russell Wilson I kind of just
named the vlogs I didn't talk about it I
was in a bit of a rush after I met her
but she is wonderful so Sierra's on my
vision board the reason is when she
released like a boy I got so many
texting oh my god SIA reminds me of you
you remind me of Ciara and every if you
look up my videos you'll see at least a
few comments that are like oh my god you
kind of like Ciara so for so many years
people have been telling me that I look
like her she looks like me and so media
was really cool because like I really
looked up to her growing up because
she was like a huge tomboy in a world
where like just like China where a world
were like everyone was really super
girly and she danced really cool and I
was like I really want to be random body
here and so meeting her she's absolutely
sweet absolutely wonderful so talented
so beautiful
it was such a pleasure meeting her her
hubby Russell Wilson is so cool as well
genuinely cares about the work he does
genuinely cares about kids he goes to
the Children's Hospital every Tuesday I
had a conversation with him about that
really passionate and just such a great
guy and so both of them are super
awesome I'm so sorry for not mentioning
that in the book I guess they just like
slipped my mind I just overwhelmed but
yeah that's what's going on today is
video day I'm gonna head downstairs to
get some breakfast
we're gonna get a lot of work done today
it's a positive day we have 24 hours in
the day we're gonna also leave our
legacies behind and make it count
just like the great people who have left
this planet in their honor we're gonna
make it a workday let's do it
yo so just grab myself a breakfast
burrito from downstairs a bit of a late
start it's like 2:00 p.m. now I also
bought this candle I know how much she
knows about me I don't think I've ever
told you I really like candles like I
like to just light candles and I'm also
sucker for anything that says like this
is positive energy chakra energy candle
I'm not too into that whole I'm into
energies but not like this type of how
do i psyche like chakras and stuff like
that I'm not too into that one says
positive energy and it convinced me and
I bought it and I thought I smelt it and
made me feel a little bit rejuvenated so
I got that candle it is so hot today but
I'm not turning on the AC it is actually
so hot that my usual heat setting I have
the place on didn't even turn on because
the actual place is naturally hotter
than that it's 83 degrees right now
Fahrenheit which in celcius I don't know
I don't know what that is I don't turn
on the AC because AC irritates my senses
and I just don't like how it feels so I
was gonna take off my clothes and go
work today's a very emotional day so
many horrible things around the world
like I just another trending topic about
rest in peace Amy about this girl that
was beaten to death in a high school
bathroom by other girls over a boy and
apparently I didn't look too much into
it because they're upsetting me so much
but apparently people were recording the
video of her getting beat up beaten up
and said of helping her and she died
like
what the hell and so I just tweet about
this also I can't change everywhere in
the world but I know I at least have a
voice to all of you watching I want you
all to promise me promise me and this is
coming from me
someone who vlogs I'm vlogging on a
camera right now my whole life is based
around making videos and it's still
coming from me if you watch my vlogs you
will never see me recording a fight
recording an accident recording
someone's suffering just for a vlog if
you are ever in a situation and you see
someone that needs help and an accident
or is getting injured or is being
treated like treated poorly don't record
it I just don't underst
internet is when it seemed cool it's
like making viral videos like everything
so shareable being a human is way more
important than a viral video so if
you're watching this I want you to
promise me literally that if you are
ever in a situation and you see someone
I needs help you will not record it and
your instinct will be to help them
because hi humanity promise me like that
upsets me so much I can't even begin to
imagine the mother of a daughter who who
was killed and people were standing
there recording it like come on humanity
we're better than this god
here comes here comes wavered
still loving nuclear from that India
trip still loving it is so hot as 87
degrees I am not turning on the AC I do
not care just finish writing my video it
is different it's not funny it is
important to me I just felt impacted
about what I was talking about earlier
about the internet and the stupid things
the internet makes people do and there's
just so many things even that I didn't
mention the vlog that have been
happening that I've just noticed
recently I'm just like oh I love the
Internet I think it's a great place I
think it's so powerful and I just want
to do whatever I can to try to make it a
nicer place and so my videos about how
to not be a jerk on the internet and
it's not really funny but it is really
important to me and I didn't feel
passionately about it I want to speak
about it so I hope you still like it I'm
gonna put on some clothes do my makeup
and record that right now that's what's
going on alright my videos mad long it's
like 13 minutes I went on a rant that's
how I get when I'm passionate about
