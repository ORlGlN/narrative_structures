so I made a party okay I have no idea
how that went I'm sorry I didn't vlog
right from the morning I just finished
my audition I was running like a little
bit late also I was feeling a bit antsy
and I was feeling like okay I don't want
to vlog right now I just wanted my mind
was in it and I didn't want to stop I
don't want to stop I sold that I was
inside so I straight to the audition
um I don't know how would I have no idea
I did all this scenes a bunch of times I
read it all the ones from yesterday and
a new one today so like I hope a lot
well I'm not really sure I have my
Invisalign appointment in a little bit
and then I have little bit of a break
and then it's weed a rehearsal that's
what's going on so it's uh it's pretty
hectic busy day but not as not as hectic
and busy yesterday but still have to get
busy hug yourself every time as I
thought to get hectic and busy and then
meeting a pimple right here and it
really really is hurting my even walking
the right way I'm across the tree from
my house I'm still lost oh my god yo yo
so I'm at my orthodontist right there
Studio City orthodontist this is going
on it is so hot and beautiful usually I
go home and sit on the patio for like a
long time but like a beer in my hand I
hate beer but like something of that
equivalence it's go like this hopefully
I don't yell at me like have you been
wearing them change while I was like yes
I've been trying my best
I really haven't tried my best all right
great good night okay point out however
tough enough to earth around just she
looks mad hot she's like every time I'm
walking I'm like hopefully it was so hot
all the time every single time and I
come in looking like sloth and they're
both fine
but um well I wasn't yeah you look
matter all the time it lowers my
self-esteem but then I'm like it's okay
my teeth are getting straight sign the
evolution of my teeth okay here we go
you might be like their new move but
they know I'm seeing it they move that's
really cool
I'm amazing I knew this to move because
the feels that when I chew it's not on
the same spot anymore it feels different
to it on my orthodontist my home is a
monumental moment is about to occur
right now as you know or may not know I
don't know maybe don't make it to me I
don't pay attention but um in the shower
in Texas my earring broke your like area
so it's effed up and turn every which
way and it's so annoying I'm complex I'm
going to get a new one and I'm hoping
and praying they have the shorter bar so
that that whole situation with the after
pairing can be done once and for all and
my earring can be on the leak from this
point board stay tuned because it's
obviously the most important thing that
is happening in our collective lives and

I'm enjoying that continue I just I just
feel like from Smith especially I'm not
looking for relaxing massages I'm
looking to like deal with stuff yeah and
he got dealt with did he go down
though I felt probably for 90% of the
entire thing that he can kill me anytime
like he you know I mean like he wasn't
very hard to do very strong and I mean
he's very nice and he's really good at
what he did it's just everything hurt I
don't I don't even know what he was
missing I felt like he was like digging
his elbow just like into my lane I feel
like I was lying on my chest but he was
still trying to massage my chest through
my back if you're not looking besides
this side of my neck he would start from
here
just stick his finger through my body to
reach that side it was it wasn't deep
tissue it was deep bone he's eyes you
have massage in it and I mean props to
him and I mean I really appreciate it
was really good he cared
I could tell you that he wasn't rushing
anything but I'm in a lot of pain he
told me I will be in more pain tomorrow
he recommended me taking an Advil and he
also recommended me drinking a lot of
water because apparently he released a
lot of toxins based off deep massage
that wasn't blood blood but I felt like
today I felt like like you know
somebody's for his dad Joe that's my my
masseuse is also equally he was quite
hard with his pressure but very good
very very good I feel good I feel
relaxed okay so I was song humble how
like he would whisper things like like
no much nothing but like random things
around but things like you know like has
the pressure know those phone numbers
for that kind of stuff like how's the
pressure
can you take a deep breath any certain
areas and you but he would whisper those
he'd be like oh I'm like daddy Tomball
the first thing you whispered to me was
oh my god even thinking about it is okay
he's like to me um alright so just try
to relax and take deep breaths and he
whispered that to me and I instantly was
like I'm gonna marry this man
he whispered try to relax in a sensual
way and I'm like oh my god he cared
about my relaxation unlike every other
man on the planet that's like stressing
me out all the time
