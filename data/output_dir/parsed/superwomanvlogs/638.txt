partner is that that's cowboy cowboy
Cowboys are leaving Texas Texas cowboy
am I being stupid
why don't I fail you don't know anything
right now anyways we're applying to
Texas and I'm so excited we're flying
for Wrestlemania we're gonna leave in
like three hours I slept in it's noon
I'm feeling feeling great I already took
a poop the morning's going great so I'm
gonna pack then we're gonna have their
think it's like a three-hour flight
which means three hours of monopoly deal
and then we're going to Wrestlemania
then we're going to Wrestlemania Devon I
confess something and literally it was
like why you going I'm like literally
I'm going because Duane's going and I
want to support him always whether or
not I mean to or not I don't care I just
literally want to support the man
because I love the man so that's what's
going on and yeah that's it some
breakfast let's do it let's do it
I think Sadie's mean yeah yes I'm an
adult just finish team to place a little
baddest thing where I guess my mom
invented it into me she'd be so proud
when I leave the house like for a
weekend or whatever I have to clean the
place so like I cleaned it everything
sparkling between humble and I so much
of our hair sheds from his beard in my
head oh my god they're just hair
everywhere all the time so and my
biggest pet peeve I feel like I have a
lot of pet peeves I apologize one of my
biggest pet peeves is hair on the floor
I isn't it strange because I have so
much hair and is usually mind I just
hate seeing hair on floors and carpets
it really irritates me so I have to
clean that ish immediately I'm just
packing do my thing picked up on my
clothes wet the airport we're still
early or more than an hour earlier you
do security and everything
and we got more than an hour before we
head on to Texas we're landing in Dallas
the song shows actually in Arlington are
living ton I don't know what it is do
you honey no idea so hope it's not super
super far from Dallas cuz there's no art
poor darling team so just go away now so
I guess all you can do is so I've made a
decision
why don't we vlog monopoly deal from now
on because it brings out the worst in
both of us and yesterday my vlog it's 60
minutes of is monopoly deal we're not
gonna blow their arguments anymore on
the regs at least if it's a special
occasion that may be but did you blog in
and they know you leave me I admit it
but for now a new vlog will just be like
1 1 2 1 through it just the scores
that's it no our uses yesterday my vlog
was like 7 minutes not please you had
nothing else and it brings out the worst
in me it does I'm a monster I look like
a monster in those clips and yeah that's
my decision so that's what's going on
Oh is a bakery hello as for the new blog
rules first game it is 1 0 that's it
one one Oh
how do you know what about a
deal-breaker this man said isn't going
because we're not allowed to we're not

property three to four week I'm so
excited go to Wrestlemania I don't care
I don't follow us them that much so I
don't really know about all the
mattresses that were wrestling just
something that excites me and when I was
a kid I grew up with it and I'm so
the biggest wrestling event of the year
for those who don't know yes I know it's
a I know it's all acting I know whatever
I don't care
I love baked I flop it and I'm so
excited to go and I'm so excited to see
like how does the setups always so dope
and let me see if I can meet any cool
people honestly I'm not even going to
like try to go backstage and meet people
like I mean that's a boaters perk if
that happens but I'm just going because
I genuinely like a I want to support
Dwayne in whatever he does look I'm
flying to Wrestlemania and I just think
it's cool to be in those experiences
that are like we are new and our
experiences were like oh furniture like
cool experiences when you gain
inspiration it's like I made it and it's
like Rihanna's space I'd dig that so
