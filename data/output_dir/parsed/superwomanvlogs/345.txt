chocolate movie theater adult amount of
time now look like I poked in my pants
like on the wrong hole it is how much
child honestly I know Tommy by the way
speaking of chocolate completely over
into that or possibly related to that or
whatever this is gonna be pure my book
yet have to it's the law
speaking of laws let's eat some brain
food five weird lon check it out number
one in Indiana liquor stores to not sell
cold water or soda or Canadian pop they
can only sell it unchill anger number
two in Mississippi it is punishable by
law I'm talking like up to 30 days in
jail if you swear in front of two people
or more in public China I would never go
to jail I mean listen DMX I'll explain
because sometimes I can't control myself
number three in Canada one out of every
five songs on the radio has to be sung
by a Canadian I have a chance number
four in Virginia the only people that
are legally allowed to have sex together
are people that are married and if
you're not married it's illegal have
y'all mother ever be in jail right now
and Nancy's number five in Portugal
peeing in the ocean is against the law
how they monitor this they have no
ethical to sign doubt that's going on
Portugal ocean peeing law how do they
know yeah I don't think there's really a
way I think they just can tell by your
face with your continent of the ocean
you're like you're going to do or you
know not anymore because you just
learned five random laws from around the
world or North America and then Portugal
as well yeah okay all right I'll be good
also that's a to comments on my video
that I want to talk about because I you
know I love interacted with all y'all
engaging with all y'all one of them was
I miss her old poster wall I personally
love the new video while I use my last
video the colored stripes the logo in
the back foot here's a little bit of
explanation for all of y'all you can
give you some
inside because for kpl in the loop the
loops over here y'all over here I'm
trying to change you in the new beam I'm
saying the reason I don't want to do a
poster wall again there's various
reasons number one is it is a little bit
distracting if you notice any time I do
videos and for the post of all my camera
doesn't know what to focus on that's one
reason but the real reasons I could be
real build with you it kind of like the
evolution of my videos I do feel like
this new wall is a little more
sophisticated and clean and to be really
really blunt with the old wall I ran
into a lie mean I didn't tell you what I
ran into a lot of legal issues was like
people trying to sue me or get me in
trouble for a picture on my wall that I
just like didn't know where it was from
and so I don't want to do with that and
so that's why I have the colored wall
mount and that's where when are we doing
my videos and so that's my explanation
the second comment is I mean within a
bad comment is just someone giving
feedback which is like yeah I can't
really chew our videos anymore I don't
know how old this person is but I will
openly admit that I am like evolving and
growing up as a person that doesn't mean
I want to stop doing what I do but
naturally as I grow older my content
will grow older and my jokes will grow
older and my stories and the things I
experienced change so if you think that
oh wow maybe I can't relate to this or
maybe your contents changing gear right
because I'm growing up you know I can't
pretend to keep knowing what it feels
like to be in high school or school of
course I remember those things I'll make
videos like reminiscing like remember
we're in high school but I've grown up a
little bit so I want to talk about that
because I think it's really special
actually that we've grown up together
over the past six years number totally
different not only different but not
completely different in salalah weird
like I said my experiences changed a
little bit so I hope you will continue
to grow with me and for those of you
that feel like you can't really see my
videos anymore I still hopefully feel
like you giggle and smile every once in
a while there's no wrong right this is
different and we're growing and we're
growing together and that's what my
favorite part of the job so yeah Scarpa
