LA I've come back home and unpacked my
things because I cleared out drawers and
so my suitcase is not on the floor

solving giving points so initially I
went and did I was telling you about how
I've no longer in South Africa and
that's being dropped and then the vlog
ended and I didn't really get to explain
as early as I'd like to piece of birch
from the Selena Gomez concert which
drops by the way I'm fine everyone's
like how much you run the blog like that
and I was like not bad if you look back
back back my vlogs just one day where I
was having a really rough day and I'm
going to practice this with this is
super personal problems but I want to
like I don't have to practice things
with that because even though the
personal problems to each person their
problem they're all they know and so
difficult to compare people's problems
but I was really upset because I really
was excited to go South Africa with
Charlize and Chelsea Handler know I love
Charlize and I really look up to her and
I think I admire her so much I was
looking forward to get to know Chelsea a
bit more as well and I was so excited

text essential medical to so much decay

heart so like a movie and I for a second
I was like Lady want to do this movie

the South Africa dates I wasn't able to
go super sad but I am really going to
make efforts to visit South Africa I
