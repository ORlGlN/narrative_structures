who wears short shorts day me me me me
me go morning the time of suction all
morning or 12:30 I just got to set some
quick breakfast and I'm heading to
wardrobe hair makeup do some camera
testing today here's the mission you do
camera testing today who would your
other self on sin again shows I'm going
to go home I don't really know I think
I'm gonna reread the script for this
movie send some emails bunch of
miscellaneous work I don't really know
what is going to be I might give a
parent to a movie today I might not I
don't know a whole bunch of hustling
stuff seismo of actually is my sister's
birthday so I'm going to try to visit
her or say what up to her and tomorrow
is a day off so I can stay up late today
so first let's see I love what my
character's name is Raven because
there's so many inside jokes like Game
of Thrones send a raven I'm like okay
what's up cultures likes cats Oh Raven
premonitions a nation is Ravens home
when I come back to my trailer just so
much the possibility there's quite
endless white endless so I try my best
in life to be down to earth and be
humble it's very important to me to do
that because I'm just like you oh I know
it's so easy to get your head up in the
clouds when you go onto a set and people
treat you a certain way and you go to an
event and fancy to a certain way but
like no it is important to me to be a
good person there's a lot constant
battle with me because as I've gotten
bigger I've been grateful enough to say
that have money and that doesn't mean I
want to spend it on ridiculous things
I've always been like no your money is
best used for experiences and for
helping people not to have ridiculous
things like but it's a struggle because
I'm like I also work very hard for my
money so what do I draw that line of
like V grounder but also like shouldn't
you enjoy this stuff and I remember
Kunal actually called me out on this cuz
I was like yo man Aruba actually
everywhere and he was that you don't
have to say that it's okay if you don't
like you work hard and I was like maybe
I am just trying to always justify like
no no I'm full ground and I swear some
got still grounded as I my schedules
gotten more busier and more busier
there's certain things I do spend money
on because of my guilt my mental health
is really impacted by certain things the
last trip I had in Toronto was really
stressed about a lot of things there was
my room which I'm proactively trying to
fix or driving my dad's truck I don't
know how to drive it very well I suck at
parking doesn't have a GPS and these are
all first rolled I know I keep pressing
that in stop saying that but there's
just not really huge problems but they
add a little bit more stress into my day
so I thought you know what you have two
and a half weeks do something for
yourself as you reduce your anxiety and
as you work so hard are a whole bunch of
things so all of that is to say
got a Tesla token I didn't get one I
rented one and the production company
really helped out in this regard of my
team so Virgil Cara's Toronto Edition is
white two cars his brother essentially
sommeliers this one is white it looks
like so we go be blazing fire you can
