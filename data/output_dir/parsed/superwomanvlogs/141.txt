your thoughts are uh I need a bed it's
like 4:00 a.m. I go to bed I have to
wake with my I have a meeting then I
have a shoot of which I don't have a
script for you it's not to do that in
the morning then I got a pack for
Toronto and Kenya and then go to the
airport so Tamar's are really really a
jam-packed day I would go upstairs go
sleep all this stuff here's one of the
benefits of living alone I'm leaving it
all here my tomorrow self is not gonna
thank me for leaving this here but I'm
gonna give myself the path and do it
anyways bye for all of you that always
like yo your work ethic how do you not
feel lazy this is a perfect example I
did hustles today I did my two rants and
drill out stuff but I did not write a
script for tomorrow and tomorrow I'm
gonna pay for it so sometimes you make
bad choices there was an example
sometimes you make batches everyone
makes bad choices sometimes an
irresponsible choice sometimes no one is
perfect but it's all about waking up
tomorrow and not making those choices
again and being like yo yesterday here's
it'll pass today you're gonna make up
for it so even if today you didn't
accomplish everything you want to
accomplish tomorrow when you wake up let
that be the fire inside of you to
accomplish all the things you know you
need to do why time you're watching this
I'm heading back to Toronto I'm not mad
about it but I like I said I'm just kind
of wanting to be in one spot for a
little but I'm going to Toronto as I
mentioned finishing off the HBO movie
taking my parents to Canada then coming
back to LA and hopefully not traveling
for a while that is the plan for today
