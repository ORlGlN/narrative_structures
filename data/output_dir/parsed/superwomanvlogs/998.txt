when I had wisdom teeth last week my
teeth the boy and crickets this push my
teeth and um a lot of people watch my
videos and I compliment my teeth but I'm
I'm open enough to say I have really
horrible bottom teeth so they're
actually all crooked or a smile like
this so you can't really tell they're
crooked but this is really really
crooked and so my wisdom teeth are like
pushing it outwards and these two hurt a
lot and I thought that like taking them
out would reduce that but now it just
feels like I'm pushed even more feels
like something's pushing that too
forward and so crooked it's just a lot
of pressure and sweet hurting but went

my problems um how's the toppings
