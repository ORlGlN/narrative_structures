happy rejuvenations Sunday
it is 2:30 I walk about 1 I slept in
actually my instinct so clear but 10 I
was like sure I'll pop will go back to
sleep we've already pretty much cleaned
up the place pretty sick and span but
some things never change and even though
when I move in here about a bazillion
hangars you know me and clothes have a
very interrelationship I need more
hangers and I also cool Humber's humbles
hangers so he also has more hangers and
I have no hanger to hang up these
clothes that are waiting to be hung up
well we pretty much cleaned I feeling
good things are sparkling humble such a
sweetheart before I even woke up he was
already washing dishes and sweeping and
Allison's own tanzil it's your true true
time zone advantage and now we're gonna
want to target to get to my laundry too
when we run to Target to get some
hangers and to get some other things
that we need to get we should thoroughly
think this through though because I feel
like at least once a day I'm like oh I
need this from Target taiyaki to spend
my life and targeted by everything on
target but that's what's crack-a-lackin'
today I mean rejuvenation Sunday but a
lot of work needs to be done just
because the secret projects are going
down and you know what I mean and I
already feel rejuvenated I slept in
yesterday I went for dinner I'm feeling
good I'm not feeling stressed I'm not
feeling tired I'm feeling relaxed so
today we're gonna go to a beast mother
after mode now I got my work partner
here things about to get lit and turn
and did that Oh humble get over here
let's do the card all right yesterday
was about magic humble some people don't
like the card part so I'm trying to
still do it cuz I like it but because
some people skip the card part cuz I
talked about it for a while but I like
the card pathing the car parts important
I think it encourages at least one
critical creative flaw today I mean
which is actually today's card it's
about love
love love is a many-splendored thing
today I will notice and appreciate at
least three of those blenders like the
fact that puppies make me feel like a
parent or the surge of self
congratulations I feel when I think a
three point trash basket shot on the
first try or how about the chills I get
when I sing along to name of song you
know the one sing along too for me it's
probably gonna be Alessia Cara cuz maybe
yeah I'm yeah maybe yeah yeah alright
