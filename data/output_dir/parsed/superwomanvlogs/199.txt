persevere Devils all right there's one
something right it was one as far as we
finish the wrap that was really really
hard because Nikki goes slower to temper
to the 8 count she goes like didn't dare
did it it did and then I decided to go
slow for personal most floor estimates
it didn't decision do so like really
really hard to do definitely need Ally
to adjust the beef but I didn't think
