today's gonna be a great day what up yo
good morning not actually it's good
afternoon but I'm allowed to sleep in
your wit X it is 12:15 p.m. and I have
decided that today isn't a great day to
be a happy day because I am in charge of
how I feel and today I choose happiness
that's what's up no matter how many
little voices are going through my head
I'm going to fight them all and have a
great day and have a productive day and
I'm not gonna feel lonely and I'm gonna
be so happy I'm gonna start by eating
I'm I don't want it I'm doing this
because I'm not wearing a bra and I
don't I don't want to look awkward but I
didn't start with the good breakfast and
then I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna
do for the rest today
but first Yong Yong Yong Yong Yong yep
yes I'm such a jerk Lee covering my lack
of bragging I know I'm not lying down I
was doing work cccccc work um and I made
myself a little bit of a schedule after
make one video for review remember that
awesome what you don't remember because
you really get to see it but I got to
shoot a video with one of my fans
because coke like cooking for Miss man's
fan so I got to edit that and shoot that
so I'm planning to finish that within
the next hour and a half then I got to
make show promos and then I got to make
a video for Monday because it's Monday
and I need to go buy a new suitcase
because as you remember from my tour my
suitcase be broke up but first I thought
I just danced my favorite song okay no
no no poor Gaston earring I actually
just read a great article um I love
reading business articles by the way
it's a bomb if you ever find a really
good business article about like
productivity and sign up send it my way
I love that stuff or a great business
article about basically was called let
me just procrastinate even though I
shouldn't be but let me just show you
what I was called cuz was really good it
was from Business Insider and was I say
I psychologic I can't say psychologists
even those where I went to school for a
while
a psychologist explains how successful
people do more in a day than others do
in a week it's basically about how you
can do certain things and make certain
decisions that will allow you to be more
productive and one of them was stop
trying to multitask and stop getting
distracted
and surrounding yourself with certain
people yeah yeah so I was like oh my god
is so great so then as soon as I read
that I closed Facebook on my computer
closed Twitter closed all those tabs and
if it shouldn't work now I'm going take
a shower and record that video look no
no no don't forgotten it yeah casually
you know okay so I was closing the door
and it chipped my nail look it hurts so
much it feels like bleeding man hurts so
much I just finished my show promo so
I'm done that Coke gruff I need to do I
did the show promos I'm running a little
behind schedule but that's okay it's
okay we're not gonna panic um after this
I'm gonna go buy new suitcases and my
breath is so hot in here and then I'm
going to work on Monday video cuz it's
Monday but first we eat right oh my god
I just realized that all of my vlogs are
a series of sentences that just tell you
that I'm gonna eat before I do anything
else I'm okay with that
I'm okay with that yo what's up I am
headed to the mall to buy some suitcases
I'm very behind on my day I've even done
my Monday video yep but that's okay cuz
towards Nicole sim and I need me some
suitcase line going on the rest of this
world tour without broke up suitcase um
just another wheel talked with the lease
something that's on my mind and I talked
about this before but I'm gonna talk
about it again
I'm very much so aware that I'm a
workaholic I mean I'm the first to say
it I'm very much so aware of how much I
Drive myself crazy but what I think
people need to remember is if they care
to remember that I actually really like
what I do like I love being superwoman
and that's why I work so hard on it cuz
I genuinely believe in what I do I
believe in my message I believe in
making a difference I believe in putting
my all into my work yeah sometime should
I chill the FL of course that's
something I will learn um I've talked
about this before I'm the type of person
where if you see me hustling I don't
want to hear people say to me just take
it easy you just take a nap oh you have
deadlines always complain you're tired
watching scores sleep and I think you
need to slow down a little bit like in
the nicest way possible no crap Sherlock
or Aleve I'm telling you that you're I'm
really tired but I got so much to do and
you're like then go to sleep do you not
think that thought occurred to you ready
obviously I have stuff to do and the
nicest way
look I don't want that back kinda stuff
doesn't help me if I go you'll get it on
door and I get why you said that you
care and you want to make sure to
overwork myself to trust me don't worry
I'm good and the reason I bring this up
because I was like yo some people take
it next level with they get offensive
it's like yo slow down this is why
you're going crazy this is why you're
like good and then they start predicting
like this is why you're gonna fall off
one day this way I gonna hit rock bottom
one day they start like putting me down
because they see me working really hard
and like again in the nicest way
possible if you want to bash me and call
me a crazy workaholic today I hope
tomorrow you don't want to swim in my
pool okay because you're you don't want
to be in up in my pool though I don't
got a pool right now but I mean like
metaphorically speaking we're not gay
why you know I need one the most right
now but that just man few things make me
happier than sunshine but Christmas
Cinnabons
okay few things make me happier than
sunshine and Sun Cinnabons
shaggy listen but not was this to resist
the urge I mean I could get a cinnamon
wad at night you're like I am the boss
of my own wife hello alright let's get
some suitcases from Bonn Mac look at
these two cute options I can't decide
it's like a really cute one you know I
feel what puppies
what's one so colorful hey let me see
that more I'm so overwhelmed okay so I
went with this one for the following
reasons one it's a matching set the
other one didn't have a matching set the
colors at first instinct made me happier
colors make me really happy the other
one was really cute but there was a lot
of colors then the final factor was I
opened it and this one's lining is
yellow like a bright yellow that's like
automaticall happiness and the other one
has like a darker lining inside I'm not
that dark isn't happiness cause like yo
that brenell's getting chocolate caramel
I don't know ice like this one smoked up
to anything and also the dogs like face
get scratched up then wow I'm
overthinking this way too much I'm
