everything is happening right now so
exactly what we feared was going to
happen has happened the furniture people
are here to pick up the furniture and

have to figure out a way to get the
couch and all my rented furniture out

iPad today version 1.0 also today I have
to go over my book stuff also bad my
first club so this is always a tribe the
day I'm moving I have the busiest day
cuz I'm a stupid person I'm a student
person but it's gonna be emotional
productive efficient day actually the
emotional part might not make it
efficient but we're gonna figure it out
it's gonna be exciting from this point
on we're gonna be camping literally have
nothing we novel garbage still things

curtain also I've informed that the heat
in the new place is not working they're
gonna try to go and fix it today but if
not that I'm gonna be freezing tonight I

inside too but I'm like really
emotionally attached you know a lot of
good memories in this place a lot of
good moves a lot of good memories a lot
of great memories yeah of course
of course I have to edit the first
clapper do this over the first clap and
I backed my memory card in the bosses

theme of the day or you know this is
doing to you up today being like Oh frig

here she tries her best to cover her
tracks it'll always be a little
balled-up socks yes I have a very bad
habit of leaving my balled-up socks
everywhere you know it does he wasn't in
my bed you million movie with all those
thoughts I'm sorry little haul this for
it's just you're calling her not thought
ball hey can I take them up with my toes

let me really came down you to me give
you a sling kiss on your forehead and
disappear when you don't have a shower
curtain and this and this and this is
what you gonna use take a shower you
know ash is real when I'm about to pack
my computer my mornings travel with this
thing what to shut down my computer
I know the last time I shut down my
computer that's why I've got my computer
was 1999 last time I shut down my
computer Obama was still president this
is a real nice right here you know it is
limited where it is until you real quick
what it is one of the reasons all some
kind of emotional is one year some
attaches place but also like it's really
tough to do these things without my mom
and dad my family because like I moved
away from Toronto first time I moved out
they weren't here you know not that I
didn't want to be they asked like do you
want to succumb to I was like no no no
like I don't want that I don't want you
to leave and stuff like it's kind of
hard to do like my first house and
moving and not have my mom here and to
be like doing it with me since I'm like
a you know a family person and that
sounds like group very in that culture
and so
I'm just kind of like Oh like this is so
everything is happening and so big and
I'm just like mommy hold me this is a
monumental over right here taking down
the final picture so an important part
about saying goodbye is if I was saying
goodbye to the friendship bowl whenever
you visit you got a chance to put your
sticky on and since we're having new
place we're going to populate the
friendship wall with new sticky so let's
say goodbye goodbye not apar one goodbye
not apart - goodbye chase goodbye floozy
goodbye so like a leader runny goodbye
I'm gonna guess this is Renee goodbye
Ashley wonderful goodbye Alex Masami
goodbye laurdiy aka laundry goodbye sick
sister oh and last but not least time to
say goodbye all the friendships I was
dirt over but every year my god when
you're moving but your book is still due
tomorrow let's get to work
I'm actually really proud of myself for
multitasking because the moving is
happening but I mean so productive with
my book and I'm just like zoning into
I'm like nope ringing get done and I'm
doing it and it's a great feeling
oh my god everything's gonna be alright
this is sad
don't worry about a thing cause every
little hing go walking up the stairs you
need endurance but now we must say
goodbye the good news is been cool to
figure out which new vinyls I can put my
new house but for now these is all going
by bike so be one of the last sunsets we
see in the beautiful really pad version

this yeah out of everything I've ever
done in my life the hardest thing
continues to be deciding where things go
and you kitchen I'm just like Bulls how
do i how do I feel about the Bulls there
you know I'm just like how does that
make me feel you know it's gonna take me
a week what what is the problem the
problem is that I need things to line up
electrically I want symmetric things but
then also like to be even and then also
like you present like see like there's
three four of these but maybe something
is the width kind of equal to oh yeah so
not I gotta got me the best homecoming

so far Philip okay this is a progress so
far sky little temporary setup right

double as a dining table so a lot of
stuff just randomly everywhere it's
gonna take a while I think I'm gonna be
like this honestly for like 30 days
while I'm doing collabs because I won't
be able to figure it all out

frozen pizzas if you have you know you

to happen and I'm gonna say my final
goodbyes

move into mourning go back no I'm just
saying goodbye I'm gonna be in this
place I'm getting my closure have a
sentimental moment there I'm gonna get
it done

be our last time in the first-ever lily
pad we're gonna take a moment here we're
walking in remember this hallway I can't
explain to you the feeling of we very
key in toward or walking in and be like

the friction of this locker Saigon
tumble out of it tumble out service
that's not happen might have a million
hard I haven't I haven't seen this
before I open the freezer right and look
what I see what I open there is a drawer
I want I'm being so dramatic and so
emotional but I really do feel some type
of way because I remember sitting here
after moving oh my god I'm getting
emotional I remember sitting here after
moving and genuinely being so terrified
in this exact same spot I was sitting on
the ground and I was like did I really
just move away from all my friends and
all my family and what the f am I gonna
do and I had no idea what I was gonna do
I'm crying I don't know why this is so
stupid but I'm just so proud that I
figured it out
I freaking figured it out I've been here
for a year and I accomplished so many
great things here and you know I had my
premiere here my family visited here and
my friends visited here my friendship
with humble really blossomed here and so
proud and I love this place so much it's
always gonna spot my heart this for me
is always enough a spot my heart and I'm
gonna say the same thing I said when I
first moved in here I sat here and I
looked around horrified and I said Billy
this is scary but you are going to
accomplish amazing things in this place
and you are going to look at all these
challenges and you're going to
absolutely conquer them and that's what
I did and so I'm gonna really anything
thank you so much and I'm gonna go to a
new chapter it's just a building it's
fine although the home is coming with me
and the friends are coming with me the
memories are coming with me but I'm
going to see this new challenges new
chapter of growing up and 11 leveling up
and I'm going to see new obstacles and
I'm going to overcome them
new home and with that we're going to
leave our blessings and positive lives
for whoever moves in next the first ever
lily pad but is now time to say goodbye
to it
