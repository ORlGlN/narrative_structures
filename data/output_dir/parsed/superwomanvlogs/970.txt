splinter out of my foot this may just be
the saddest day of my life donc ulis ok

things I've ever experienced in my
entire life Wow

took a needle and stuck it into the part
of my heel that hurt and it's already
hurting so much and but it's out and I
can walk this was the weirdest
experience of my whole life

here for I don't know what and I'm
pretty sure I just lie down in a
birthing bed what is going on okay an
