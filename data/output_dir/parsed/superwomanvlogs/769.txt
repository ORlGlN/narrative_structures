good morning JK good afternoon Jake it I
can even say good evening I woke up at
like 2:30 or 3:00 what's happening today
is I slept really last night so I was
okay to sleep in my back I think I
pulled something with all that whining I
was doing him personal I have her cell
today first I need to go shopping which
is like brilliantly work dogs I'm trying
to find a new outfit for the music set
hopefully I can find one works out great
because I checked my mail okay this is a
really interesting story it was like a
really reflective moment for me so I
don't know if wherever you live there's
a store called winners the store called
winners in Canada and working out winner
it's like a clothing store but to have
like everything there like homework
that's like a department store you could
say but I've never really awesome prices
but I used to work there I worked there
for a week it's a really funny story so
when I was like figuring out what I want
to do in life I had like a bunch of
retail jobs and one of them was that
winners net worth it for a week and I
don't know what it is about that job
it's just brings me back to such humble
beginnings cuz when I'm like on stage
doing Superman stuff and on flights was
like like I'll never forget those roots
of where I came from and today sadly I
guess they sent me like a gift card to
go shopping so I'm like bomb I'm gonna
go find it over for this gift card so
where you gonna winners and hopefully I
can come out a winner all I do is win
waiting you that's we're gonna go to

winners gonna go help me find an outfit
then go to rehearsal and first I'm gonna
wipe my nose like that but look at me

good to go right now

in your car eating noodles um cuz we're
late a little classy person it's okay

I do I don't even come here for this
block of this backpack it has I don't
need another backpack with this backpack
and this is what I do this is what I did

I have a problem
mm-hmm oh here we go let me focus on
something I actually need because I
don't have enough
snack packs stop control okay what are
we looking for I'm thinking like a long
t-shirt dress type thing something like
what I wore to YouTube FanFest that's
kind of vibe I'm looking for so many
options I'd like to clone myself I'm out
of control okay I think I have a lot of
really good options I want to show you
this one thing I have no shame I'm just
logging in the story everybody it's like
the rhinestones the top you see that
detail I think that's so boss with like
a boss Lee is there in like heels and

of shame welcome shake okay for you
those are good
oh the fast shopping stop it look like
you don't know Oh meant elopement Oh
Brody parked at p1 p1 will you wear mine
what I so let's remember this whole show
I just did my Ed Sheeran song remember
that that's all good back remember how I
stretched I remembered my pre-show prep
you know like my talking my walking my
shoelace you know is he's always there
and I'm like you should know before I go
onstage this matter confident stage
before I go on stage
I'm freaking that F vote for those
fabulous I am freaking out even though
the psychic on stage I'm flying
but like pre he knows he's always there
and I was telling my keep the water
bottle open because I irrationally keep
thinking I need it so he'll be there
holding a verdict now be like
now they keep putting it all over me
then two seconds later he's just like so
patient it's a very intense though it's
a very intense like thing I do and then
I do the whole walking thing I'm like
people know not to talk to me people
know not to like it's like a whole thing
that goes on it's a whole crazy lady
thing that goes on but it's gonna happen
again
by the way Mickey is not coming because
Mickey is too busy being a superstar but
Lauren and Lauren's gonna be our boy so
it's gonna be dope go so you can keep me
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
holdin me closer til our eyes meet you
won't
10:36 p.m. oh I will a lot of a lot of
things to do diner says everyday but I'm
just telling my honest feelings I'm
talking really fast that's how you
normally stress I just realized that our
Trinidad flight is like a total of 12
hours because the stopover and it's a
waste traveling up Thursday and
Thursday's video days I need to do a
video in advance that's just like I
gotta practice the whole show I got to
memorize that I got to do a whole bunch
of before I leave I got a pack then I'm
back again one of these days has to be
an all-nighter Thursday Jitsu Wednesday
night it doesn't make sense because our
flights so early this just make sense
because like then I'll just sleep on the
plane I don't want to do that want to
practice on the plane so I feel I asked
me tonight but tomorrow is have so many
things to do what I'm just like does
that make sense
tell me like dead dough can't spaghetti
like an adult um I gotta make a to-do
list and I'm kind of terrified to make
it by the way Selena retweeted the video
happened during practice I freaked out
but then I was like you know what you
notice I like her so much as a person
where even though I want a fangirl part
of me doesn't want to fangirl because
it's nothing like a fangirl reaction
anymore just like a genuine she's just a
good person and it just makes me happy
so instead of doing work I'm trying on
the clothes at about today but in my
defense look how cute this is okay I
love you I am in love with this but
could help you like is this not like
totally like your hangs up he's not
totally like boss
yeah like details going on here cuz I
need to just be like you know just like
practicing the mirror like I love that
because this contest going on where if
you post it's only for Canadians out so
he's not Canadian like you can just
stare at my pretty shirt while I talked
if you use the hashtag winners fat binds
then you can win a gift card as like I
did so sweet of him to give me a gift
card though I love it
I'm see if you can post on my Facebook
and Instagram and Twitter and all those
things I'll put all the information in
the description but um shadow just
wanted you I appreciate that companies I
hold about teams loop I like you back in
my shirt it's like my skin now basically
the time is 3:00 a.m. and I'm thinking
about going to sleep I did some things
um I'm trying to keep my brain logically
I can't pull two all-nighters I'm
thinking it makes more sense to pull the
all night or tomorrow because tomorrow
if so many things to do is just not a
good idea to try to do it tonight so I
think if I sleep now I can get a good
amount of sleep and then just kill it
tomorrow all night that's what I'm
thinking I think I'm gonna do that
tomorrow but maybe
oh marshmallow what am I talking about
thank you for joining me on another day
of shopping and rehearsing and trying on
clothes and procrastinating and all of
those things and tomorrow's another day
