welcome to Lilia no rush in the car
makeup tutorial step number one bust out
your ring light for those flattering up
lighting where you can offer some horror
stories step number one is gonna be
remove all the ayah boogers and cruft
from your elbows also then your step
number two it's important before you get
in the car you leave all of your
pre-existing makeup on even better if
it's on the night before that way your
pores are really super cloth and
everything just kind of slides off your
closet pores it visibly going to your
skin bringing out the best in your face
using a who am i king of course I do
we're gonna be using ok it was called I
don't know man he gave it to me and
we're gonna unstick Oprah with a bottle
of vodka I'm gonna put it right on that
imperfection and that imperfection and
all you have makeup also if you feel
like you're getting really really
jealous on your bad as a person just eat
this it'll make you pretty on the inside
okay we're gonna use this brush that we
use for everything because we don't know
the difference would you brush and nor
do we wash them and then we complain
about our skin see it's not even
remotely going into my pores because
it's just like already a house party
over there it's important to go to all
directions because that's probably the
right thing to do the good news about
this environment is that it's dim so
really I can't tell how trashy looks
look step number two we're gonna use
Fenty beauty I bought this just kidding
man he also gave it to me great thing
about Benji beauty is that it was made
by a colored woman so she understands
the struggle and I don't need seventeen
different shades do my makeup explode I
swear to cough up okay we're gonna put a
little bit of other thing on the thing
how much no clue we're going to put it
on top of the skin I think that's right
it's important to do this area cuz I
always forget it and then just look like
a more your mask love yo Jim Carrey and
I'm like okay now when you're in the
entertainment industry support to use
even more concealer cuz you'll never get
sleep because your health is not
important

I'm talking about but I color people I
got hair everywhere as well protip you
have a nose ring you have to do this
everyone will think you're picking your
nose which is clean the foundation off
your nose it really really big rushing
off time on all of these steps you could
all just learn to love yourself bonus
points if you are a white t-shirt cuz
you're for sure just get that really
disgusting rim on your shirt from your
may god bless you when you do this
because you need to blend it into the
rest of your body get your ankles
most babies out rape school can't be
won't show up in a movie monster here we
go
