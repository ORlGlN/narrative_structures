ladies ridiculous oh my god
today's a day that's my inauguration
writing down oh my god bro imma just
rewind for a little bit and tell you
about a time way back when it was buffer
festival actually like a long goddamn
time ago and I had emailed very
nervously Hanna hard to get how you
don't know who I am I live in Toronto
I'm a small youtuber can you please
collab with me I'm so excited so Hanna
was gracious enough to agree and we did
the Backson smoothie challenge where you
drink weird crap so I go into Hannah's a
hotel room first time I'm meeting her
freaking out and then she says we have
grapes in the other room and I peed a
little and I was like oh my god I love
it I was so nervous to me great because
I'm like she's just everything and more
actually walk into the room as a giant I
was so intimidated she was so pretty and
she was so goddamn nice in fact I sent a
screenshot to my friend when she
followed me on Twitter because that's
how mother effin gasps I was here I am
on her podcast I know she is dis Queen I
remember good Hannah was like I'm
filming with this vlogger or youtuber
that's here in Canada because it was
like we didn't know anyone in Canada
other than people that were running
buffer fest do you wanna meet her and I
was like totally I'm so hungover I will
absolutely want to come meet her because
she was like freaking out the Jews
during the smoothie challenge it was
like really hungover she's like I might
puke like go for it no it's so fun I
know it was one of the things I was like
I might be making really terrible first
impression because I just reek of
alcohol from know who did it you clogged
with deodorant on your wrist like you
feel like I'm finally doing not too deep
I've been dying to this podcast because
you know I love everything grace does I
think she's a good human above
everything else she's very cool and
doing not too deep and it's very saying
it's pretty freezing cold and that's how
you know I love grace because you know I
hate cold I literally tell I was like
Lily just called really and she's more
comfortable when it's warm can we get
some blankets here over her that's so
sweet of you thank you so I do have a
blanket here it's mostly help covering
up my Jean penis that's happening right
now
we're doing this episode it's dope it's
amazing it's fun all of the good ends I
saw
energy oh my god whoa friggin amazing
goddamn obsess grace of a wonderful
human being upset though so much fun I'm
so say I got to be a podcast now we're
heading back to my house because I have
to start sending my tip in sheets which
is the books for the sheet in my book
and have a very cool idea about it I'm
going to tell you about in this moment
here there's momentarily but first let's
go home is something to be so much
goddamn traffic yeah that's only three
actually maybe maybe now maybe even at
mrs. foster driving stop waiting time
guys do finish outside I'll take your
table
Tiffany can I die now got up with no joy
army the bacon lollipop nanny the quad
way so multicolored all up in here guess
what were looking at right there you
guys what we looking at right here
can we get shows on this and it looks
like was it another look toward it Oh
book tour dates all right oh my god then
what about what everybody's going bad
just I gave up too bad like x-ray vision
there while we see through your fingers
I'm always your cutter this paper right
here this paper right here yeah
literally more days you have to flip it
over there Wizards are going shot
enhance FBI right here tour dates coming
soon so I also just to pinch if I'm
gonna do that now right now we have a
great idea of where all you want is like
it's like this is Sarah's office the
first time I'm seeing it's actually
really really really pretty
no camera girl camper here so trying to
focus or trying to focus hold on hold on
it's been recording this whole time look
how pretty this offices look at this
look at these people look at bay look at
all these people
oh my god can I show them this room to
look I probably thought about therapy
the whole time and look at this idea
waiting in my house oh my god oh god
make me feel like a bad foot yo yo gang
look what just came in the mail
my new baggage camera came he says notch
and go finally back to Montgomery bought
my slug stuff he's this hot mess I've
been using right now - damn I'm so dead
excited thank you can my nephew this
entire box Cummings in your column you
think thousands thousands so these will
be actually most of my word binded
better my words binded for this
particular I think bind it is with four
books
mounted four walls um yeah I don't
forget sound so you find it and I'm this
fine this is for the UK specifically
exclusive signed edition so I'm gonna
sign every single one of these every
time I get both some of the old you say
really sinus issues printed like what's
with that cuz I sometimes go to Berkeley
is a side to side as rush so let's talk
about specifics here of fact with a cold
heart back and if I wasn't print a book
obviously a mass print correctly all of
like Canada would have a print always
not changing a spelling between America
and Canada other than that it's a mass
print so sorry I could be like okay in
Toronto I want these books me to put
them on these books other than that
right so you're probably not like
traditionally sign I'll visit you not
but how do we get around that well I'm a
genius I'm going to use different colors
that's right I'm going to find the books
in different colors meaning in the UK in
this box and we use difficult tragedies
which means that when you buy a book and
your friend buys a book from the same
damn bookstore there's a chance there
would be a different color signatures
not ensuring that there's no possible
way I did not by hand from my heart and
soul sign that book and that was my idea
that I had of me no real taco
I'm Anna's hands on each of them and you
didn't go throw nothing you don't trust
me but just so you know so there's no
possible way I could have mass printed
it because all the movie different with
different colors and there's no way you
could have some colors printed like that
for a city so that's my foolproof way of
be like yo we go hustle so crowded
it's like a worm guy slowly the world
another there is we discover let's take
seven to the rooms but there aren't so
in case you're concerned now you know
their horns so in total of how many
that over 10,000 um can we go get some
more vodka who an hour and I got
permanent marker on my chocolate one
hour
myself but easy put tough but meaningful
I'm not washing my signatures I'm like
try doing a little bit nice but a lot
more to go on my den to the box like
this so far so fill this fill this to
the brim so far but um need a break
because there's misspelled my name you
know I have missile buddy I have some
like wasting pages that actually messed
up on but only three so far so I'm not
mad at all so I'm going I'll be stopping
to see that humble learn his lesson
oh my god look at these Missy these are
yellow bananas that's yellow good job
oh yeah good so to force you to make the
right choice now flashback instant
replays as you can see in this
comparison one bunch of bananas is
yellow and the other is green but more
important than both of these things you
know what's actually bananas the fact
that humble is colorblind how long will
these last night you're gonna turn black
no the conversation isn't about whether
they're going to as log of love okay
because of congress's now I know that I
suppose you want it's being dictated by
bananas and I refuse to have that I'd
rather I was bananas green now you gotta
stress about the banana so now I'm
sticking about the bananas or 15 minutes
wondering if the today's inauguration is
biggest problem is if it is very tough
you have bigger problems again and
Hillary one albanism agrees so my
wonderful neighbor dropped off these
amazing orchids or the get nose like oh
my god where's your neighbor just as I
bought her cupcakes I'm like yeah you

yeah oh yeah oh yeah I don't write out
on oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
are you doubt I doubt I doubt our you
know some very intense ping-pong is
happening right now I'm sweating
it smells and not enough proof of how
mean humblest me am is placing hi we're
gonna do a zero Linda but even if I
start winning he starts making excuses
and you just can't let me feel like I'm
winning
well we're doing well door well like for
Ville asking okay if I like did better
good job under jr. so you get faced
years older he naturally is very
competitive
come on and so is he I'm not he just
does like to admit it yes thank you are
reducing another poison scene every time
you see was Rebecca menu for you bugs
there's always this scenario where
humble is saying something and everyone
else in the room is saying something
else so you can decide who you were a
good life so chase we're gonna say
you're not competitive is are saying is
let's say to this and I can visit what
I'm saying
no it's chase mister you're not compares
it as a huge yes or no oh oh oh oh and I
