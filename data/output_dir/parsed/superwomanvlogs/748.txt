Prime Minister of Canada

also here we like him again I'm heading
to stage I didn't get just shake Justin
Trudeau's him because after going stage
it is not here yet so but to go do this
guy you ready one of these corners
whoa
see
what up we date guys alright now I got a
question for you and I want you all to
answer honestly okay answer honestly how
many of you have ever felt like you're
alone or an outcast raise your hand be
honest raise your hand okay now put your
hand down raise your hand again if you
thought you were the only person that
ever felt that way okay now I want you
to take a look around because this is
proof that when you feel alone you're
actually never really alone okay but
wait I get it sometimes that's easy to
forget and I get it cuz I'm gonna be
real with you and I want you to pay
attention five years ago I suffered from
a really severe depression okay
and I used to feel lonely all the time
and that's when I found YouTube and
created superwoman because I thought if
I could make other people laugh maybe
just maybe I could make myself laugh one
video led to another and today I can say
fast forward five years I have 400
videos seven million subscribers and an
online community that never ever makes
me feel alone okay because listen listen
this is what I realized I was so scared
that people wouldn't like me for me but
the real issue was I didn't like me for
me
and that's when I realized that's the
success behind superwoman and what will
make you all successful because you will
all be successful okay
and what will make you successful is
truly embracing who you are I love you
too and not being a
sorry about it now let me be real with
you when I first started making videos
no one on the internet looks like me and
that made me nervous okay
but as soon as I started embracing all
the unique things that make me me things
started moving up and I'll be real with
you today my hair is never perfect okay
my jokes are kind of lame and I'ma be
real with you girl my eyeliner is never
on fleek okay but that's okay because I
started to build an online community of
people who could relate to all my
imperfections and I call them team super
and now team super spreads positivity
makes people laugh and it's full of
people who may have also felt lonely at
some point so now hold up this is where
I want you to pay attention because I
want to do two things I know this is in
school but I have two things I want to
do are you ready okay
number one I want you to be you okay I
make videos in my room alone
I draw beards on my face okay and I
couldn't be more proud of Who I am so I
don't want you to worry about fitting in
embrace who you are because trust me
when I say everyone else is taken okay
be proud of who you are and do not be
sorry or ashamed about it so to
officially be proud and happy with who
you are I want every single person here
put both your arms up like this every
single person teacher students doesn't
matter who you are both your hands up
and from the bottom of your heart I want
you to hug yourself hug yourself because
you are awesome make some noise for
yourself
now number two now that you know how
awesome you are I want you to use your
unique abilities and build your own
community because let me tell you
superwoman might have saved me a long
time ago but today superwoman is a voice
that gives strength to people around the
world so what I want you to do is be a
voice for people and inspire change and
strength in your own way can you do that
okay now hold up hold up just in case
you're sitting there and you've ignored
everything I said that's okay I'm not
mad I'm like a little mad I'm not a lot
man I understand you might be distracted
by how long and awesome my hair is but
if you remember one thing from me let it
be this let it be this I promise you you
have the ability to build amazing
communities that will change the world
okay I built mine on YouTube but you can
build yours in whichever way your
amazing mind tells you to so from the
bottom of my heart I truly mean this you
are all super women and super men you
need to be the superheroes this world
needs and go save the day okay because I
cannot wait I cannot wait to see what
you all do thank you so much one

like Trudeau went like people trying

where I'm like that's how powerful the
Internet is when we're just observing

the Internet is and how like what a
movement is like crazy it's like today's
generation you are the power the
powerhouse of the cell I decided from

stuff all the time or like honesty let's
just make the video stop trying to like
I'm getting in the habit of like going
so over the top with stuff where it's
like not even it takes a fine away from
expressing and trying to 500 things of
day so I'm like you just have a day just
make the video with what you can make
just make it the best you can like stop
killing yourself over this so I'm making
the video deciding to do it tomorrow
