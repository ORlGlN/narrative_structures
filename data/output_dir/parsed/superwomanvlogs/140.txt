greasy cuz I should be shot but cream i
lather of myself in the ocean like he
made dehydration I landed in Toronto a
few hours ago took a nap woke up the
time is 5:00 p.m. I woke up a few hours

knew I had a little for my emails I got
to do some script writing I'm heading to
that Fahrenheit 451 it's probably to be
a short day on set though not unpack

get get at it I decided to give myself
some grace today oh because I'm not
gonna lie the last two days has been
rough for me they've been rough for me
can we just talk to me sucker music
friends my mental capacity of traveling
and after Toronto I'm going to Kenya
afrikanya I've already gotten something
else on my plate that I might say no to
because I'm just like I can nah I need
just to rejuvenate a little bit and I'm
having a rough time and you should know
that everything I'm happening in my life
I don't talk about the vlogs because
that's unhealthy but I have been having
a tough time as of late with a few
different things in my life I'm just
like holding on I'm trying to hold on
and you know we out here a niche but
I've decided also when I'm in Kenya I'm
not gonna be vlogging and I'm not really
gonna be on social media I'm I insist
story and Instagram post a little bit
but hey I won't have any connection
there so I don't even have a choice and
B I want to go with my family and have a
good experience there and I don't have
to worry about caring around vlog camera
so I'm not going yet I'm going in a few
days but just to prep you wouldn't go to
Kenya I will be away for a week but
after that we got promise I will come
back just like
