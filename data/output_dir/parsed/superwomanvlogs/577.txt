pen dependable I don't know a song has
been stuck in my head and I watch a
music video and I feel like I would I
feel like I just did drugs because I
watch the music with the guys just like
it's like oh this is the music this is
an accurate reenactment of the music
video but much for your walking box um
but I've had a very productive day thus
far it's not the morning it's like
almost close to the evening but I've had
a very very productive day a lot of work
is getting done today is also super
Monday and I've decided I'm good your
parents reactants I haven't done a
parents reacting so long and I think I
wanted her to fifth Harmony's work from
home because so many of you requested it
and the music video is like there's a
lot of things that you could comment on
today's also Game seven for Yusuf's team
probably uses steam because me and him
have this like war going on now that the
rapper's are you invited me over for
Game seven but I have to make a video
and I'm also kind of feeling like I'm
missing out on mad
leisure activities I've said no to like
the last six leisure things that have
been presented to me cuz I have so much
work so I'm debating like before I make
the videos just stop by or make try to
finish it quickly and go I don't know I
haven't decided yet but that's all in
mind it's also mad hot it's so hot that
I turn on the a/c so I'm just saying wow

between like I've missed the last couple
leisure activities or the bike ride and

real talk is there anything worse than
something exploding in your makeup bag I
feel like it's the worst thing tapping
you take out like your eyeliner it's
like red all over
there's nothing exploded in my makeup
bag for like a month and I haven't
addressed it and today today I'm
addressing it because every time I do a
makeup
I'm stressed because I touch something
and there's color all over man
today will be the day we solved the
problem it had up all right after all of
this I found the culprit one of my
sharpeners broke and all the color from
inside exploded everywhere so so much
adult thing I'm killing the game I all
set
washed my makeup brushes something I'd
never do I never supposed to do like
every once every x-man time I do like
not that often which would probably
expand on this thing now this thing over
here but you'll adulting all right I'm
gonna shower and see my body piece but
first this is happening mud mask I'm a
makeup artist gave to me a long time ago
and also stood a long time I've never
did it it's tingling like after and
everything is burning tightly tuck with
lily and my hair is everywhere and Lolly
never listens so much work done today
