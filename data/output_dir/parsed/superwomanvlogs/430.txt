oh this whole thing good afternoon the
time is three 12 p.m. I actually slept
in today and I will go back twelve ask
me why ask me ask me why because my
uterus is what is the proper terminology
shedding is that that sounds oh my god
my uterus is a puppy my uterus is
shredding or lot it's wall linings and
my period is flowing and destroying my
life now you may be wondering why is
this adult woman who clearly has had her
period for several years always
complaining about a period let me
explain in fact you know what expect
many rants day because I feel like more
than the average woman I hate my period
so much I hated it since I first got it
whatever the hell that was I don't know
I was a late bloomer this has always
been very painful and very uncomfortable
I know there's some women wherever you
are in the world that are so super
blessed being like my periods like not
that bad just like kind of take off I am
NOT you it kills it hurts is
uncomfortable more than anything I have
my period because it makes me not
productive but that's enough of my
period because boys and I love in this
we're just another productive day I woke
up late like I said but it's all guy I
added my vlog I put it up I gotta go
through two scripts cuz tomorrow I'm
shooting my first club and I'm kinda
stressed about it
I'm only stressed because I'm only like
kind of prepared and you might be like
how are you kind of prepared you're
working on this forever
it's like the scripts and editing in
extras like I have a producer on boils
and help me actually must be I'm still
like just a little bit I wanna be more
prepared so that's what's happening but
it's a beautiful sunny day Oh actually
really sunny take me to the Sun but I
also I'm going to assume there's going
to be lots of lying down today why why
ask me why they're shedding so Yusef
just sent a video text to the group our
squad Ruben you admitted that the boys
during yesterday's game they were
cheating the whole time we're wondering
I used to be so good at the scales of
your useless really good they're
cheating the whole time punch hump on
the face right now
hashtag burn hashtag boys hashtag
toddlers I don't want to interrupt his
recording though couple of chords in my
closet and I can't interrupt me cuz it's
not as important as the freezer
compartment so I'll wait let me tell you
difference between real friends and fake
friends okay
mr. plan I'm hungry and if I am hungry
than chance a humble reports over there
are so hungry
and so what I could do is I could go and
be like he want to eat there I could be
a good friend like bread Jim when I've
asked you not Tim about open the freezer
one time I went up pizza order asking
your Bridget because real friends don't
ask if you're hungry real friends just
make you pizza yeah me know

energy an audio note because just

recording now I can interrupt him to say
hey humble guess when I receive the
attacks a video from you circuits what
he said that they cheated the entire gay

night the more important question is why

abilities are just you know not the best
and still like I guess Yusef told him
the word he was like Donald Trump and it
wasn't all I got it right but it is
almost phases like I'm thankful for this
beautiful meal more than anything on
this day I would like to be thankful for
the fact that I'm always part of a team
that never cheats it

cleavage

that's ok 9 p.m. and I just got so into
my work because I have it my first clap
shoot tomorrow I had to do a lot of
research um I got someone to help with
the script but then when I got it I was
like I don't know if I audience looking
like this I kind of rewrote it and made
it my own and I had to format it all
properly which takes me that years
action and the character I took a lot of
hours to do but I didn't I'm really
happy with it right now it took a lot of
research because it's about something I
don't know much about now I have to do
another one right now how so hard and
then when you also hard I want you to
pause and look at your hustle be like oh
you're not hard at all and do we harder
jk jk jk
I literally have
camera balancing on a Kleenex box in a
candle so if you was a team super og
which means you've been here since 2010
2011 back when I was shooting videos on
my webcam not that not use my camera now
you know I used to have this thing
called shady moments every once in a
while I get comments and tweets are like
bring back shady moments here's the
thing though shady moments was basically
me sitting and ranting about things but
just wearing sunglasses it's exactly
like what I do now except now I stand
and I don't wear glasses but people like
bring back shady moments I don't like
you so you just want to do the same
thing with my glasses I guess so I
decided in my vlogs from time to time
when I want to rant about something and
go on about something but I haven't not
be like scripted and not being on my
wall make my professional camera stuff
that I don't know how to use I would
just do a shady woman's here to pay
tribute to the original shady moment and
just as a fun thing so whenever one wrap
my vlogs on thrown some glasses will
have some shady moments this has been
years in the making
without further ado welcome to shady
moments today's rant is gonna be about
guess guess what guess what about what
periods now I have many videos about
periods menu girls on their periods guys
had their periods girls on their periods
- all I could make I could make an exact
copy of videos that make sense about
periods here's the thing though I hate
periods I mentioned it so usually I just
hate periods today for example I wake up
have my period already feeling like crap
topping to advils or breakfast being
like yo this is life then I'm like oh my
god my hair so oily if to wash my hair
can we just for a second hi if you're a
guy and you don't know this
let me just teach you something real
quick and if you're a girl get ready to
relate washing your hair well on your
period you might think there's no
correlation there but there's a
correlation you see this hair let me let
me show you the hair its offering that's
how long this washing my hair alone is
an ordeal to then have my period have to
take care of that and wash my washing my
hair in my period is too much of a
situation it's too overwhelming it's too
hard to handle I've been getting the
shower look wait do I wrap my hair on
the towel first because dripping every
work I do I deal with the situation down
there it's stressful every mother effing
time ideally I would like to never wash
my hair when I'm on my period but my
hair was so oily that I could cook food
in it don't even get me started listen I
already know that I were passed on Tampa
judge
me I don't give an F I don't understand
it's this big why can't I put it on
straight I just what what happens what
is it that when I walk my butt crack
shifts and does my butt crack actually
change is my butt changes I was
happening I just don't get it I can
literally do very difficult things I can
edit videos in minutes I can shoot
difficult words I can write scripts I
can perform in front of thousands of
people why can't I put a pad on straight
I don't know
TMI I don't care but half because I
tweeted about this earlier as well I
feel like periods are so inconvenient
how was it as 2016 we have a solution to
almost everything except you can't
create some sort of button where I can
say stop and when I'm ready to have kids
I'll press Start why having periods is
like having dial-up internet in 2016 is
inconvenient why have we not that have
an improvement you know I'm taking a
shower and I'm a period I'm literally
scared to look down imagine that
horrifying I will never get used to
periods I can literally be a teacher
teaching grammar to students and I will
still never get used to peers I hate
them that felt really good you know that
was tiring me go to bed now
this camera takes a few seconds to like
realize on the face and focus I mean am
I gonna get is my face is like a butt
wasn't as bad thank you for joining me
today I'm sorry if I was boring I was
just in my apartment all day but I got
so much work done like so much work I've
been killing it these last few days I
think I just kind of that factor like oh
I have a choice but I love it hey
tomorrow I'm shooting my first clap
which means every part of the day I need
to not show you what I'm doing because
all of my collapse are secrets I should
probably text that person and tell them
that all my claps are secret and so
you're not going to see some of my day
tomorrow but that's ok because you'll
see the rest of it and it'll be
surprised when is it a violent mm I'm
gonna head to bed because past my
bedtime it's almost 1:00 I'm like hi I'm
an old person remember special at that
time and I have to be responsible so I'm
no Tibetan I hope you had a great
blessed inspiring day can't wait to see
you again tomorrow I can't see you but
you can see me again tomorrow because
he'll be right here love you
you gotta cry if you like it subscribe
if you like it subscribe you know if
you're a header in your heart can
comprehend the magnitude the most soul
is perpetuating out right now in a long
time since I made you throw up it used
to be because of my confessions of love
and now it's because of my this year
