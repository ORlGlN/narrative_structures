Fahrenheit 451 which a lot of people
read in school I got a role in playing a
character by the name of Raven and it
has Michael B Jordan leading it and
other wonderful people I can you can see
more about on my Twitter stuff I'm so
excited so happy and so nervous by
Godzilla Raven and Fahrenheit 451
it's a dolt book it's a dystopia about a
world in which firemen burn books it is
a very very famous book and I'm really
excited for the Ziegfeld movie so now
you go
great thanks Bulbul if anyone's gonna
break your neck
ashton kutcher posted my video mic drop
that's pretty dope Ivan order that video
I saw some comments on my last blog
being right I'm so sad that it's getting
so much hay because that video team
super let's do everything to cheer her
off and I want to make it super super
clear that not even 1% of me
is upset about any hate comments under
that video I knew posting that video
would be a lot of people that agree with
it and a lot of people that were
offended or got defensive or didn't like
to be I knew that I am regretful 0%
because let's break it down actually
less you don't listen such a diagram
shall we here's the thing let me show
you how to call out BS right and I'm not
saying this the case for every a comment
but for the majority of them that are
out there right well the point of the
video right is me responding to a racist
comment me responding to a racist
comment
don't judge me on my writing in fact let
me just make this simpler we'll do this
two ways me respond to a racist comment
racism real real simple right I hate
comments out there me write them
what I saw was mad cringy not funny
can't believe people like this some
Rando
made a response this is the majority of
the things I saw right so let's go does
how you spot the eyes they're not even
in this video but like in your life if
you're ever like affected by something
she's a really good way to identify when
people are just using defense mechanisms
and are actually full of crap right my
video responding to a racist comment one
racist comment you know people are full
of problem they never address the actual
issue you know those people that will
dance all around the actual issue and
try everything else to diminish whatever
your message was at racism your videos
cringy okay what does that do to discuss
this are you ignoring this part right
here so Miranda made a video response
and owned you first of all the asset is
also does that address this this right
here the point of the video where I got
a racist comment it's not funny again
just so what you got in the video is not
money but you are to up your own
butthole to identify this is one of
those that can't believe people life is
again are you ignoring this this part
this digit sister right here at a lot of
people comments also a saying can't
believe she made a whole video based on
one hate comment are you so goddamn
delusional to think there's not
thousands more under my video you think
I made a video because I wanted to give
some random troll attention no it should
be on that comment beyond YouTube videos
in the real world racism exists once
again if you commented on that video
being like so you apply to one comment
how pathetic again why aren't you
discussing this part you know why you're
probably not discussing this part
because you are this part I want to
generalize but for the most part many
people who commented these things or the
problem that is what I responded to one
cake comment yes I did it harshly yes I
probably made lots of stereotypes I did
that on purpose because the hey comment
i was funded to about be being a
terrorist but me being a moving
from country that I'm not even from
right it was full of stereotypes and
stupidity ignorance and so here let me
write another word down for you here
satire almost every comedy will be you
watch every stand-up community watch
does this the only reason you didn't
like it this time because you are this
you're racist you know what like before
that also you hate all white people did
I say I hate it all what because I'm
pretty sure the be with me specifically
reading out a comment and responding to
one comment in fact everyone in the room
while I was recording was also white
none of them were offended maybe you are
offended because you are this the only
reason you could possibly be offended by
that video and if you somehow identified
with the person that wrote the comment
that was racist towards me so even if
you want to find mother s and loopholes
in that video I'm not even justifying
that video because I promise you I'm not
deleting any hate common I'm leaving
every comment I love every dislike I
don't give a flying and I'll make 10
more videos just like it hear me loud
and clear the reason I'm saying this is
because team super you do not need to
feel bad for me getting hate comments
but something I am standing up for I
would get a thousand hate comments if it
meant standing up against ridiculous
that were racist I don't need support
from racist people i personally deal
with a lot of racist comments but i have
friends that have dealt with racism way
worse and i am not here to entertain
people that think that is okay so you
know if you were somehow offended by my
video chances are you identified with
that trash person i'll have to come to
another trash people i leave those
comments and guess what the problems
with you ending with the goddamn video
done then done then diggity done done we
all know ashton kutcher ain't got bad
day so come on drop my marker not to
mention i saw one of the top comments by
a bunch of hater trolls get this telling
me to actually go back to my country and
referring to india again did you watch
the video another person come to think i
swear down to the real comment racism
doesn't exist
stop making people believe it does now a
real comment again meet me how did i
make this video and how how did i make
this video if it did a hundred sometimes
I honestly was like I don't even want to
retaliate against you because like
genuinely I'm just like wow you really
just need someone to sit down take you
to Starbucks get you a nice cup to sit
you down we just have a talk with you
and just really teach you about the
world outside of your apartment
I'll buy you a goddamn latte i sooo I
will buy you a latte to have this
conversation
I try to be mad at you but I'm just like
what what today today a man innocently
walked away after murdering a black men
racism doesn't exact another person oh
you hate white people leave our white
people country then and don't earn our
white people money so in pressure every
goddamn country out of the country that
you're particularly typing that comma
problems not yours to begin with let's
stop giving white people a bad name
white people are wonderful you know I
might even generalize all people are
wonderful some people wonderful some
people are bad but you be like I
represent all white people Mountain go
but no no I make out with quality every
single day and he loves me shut up we
feel non passionate I got mad boob sweat
popping off right now guys Thank You
taco stand up for what you believe in
real talk after all a serious ought to
throw a fit don't feel bad for me I feel
no type of bad
feeling no mother-effing type of back
now the next one I do in that series
probably going to be against homophobic
people which by the way I thought tweet
the other day that was so good it was I
hate the word homophobic because I don't
think it's a fear just people being
jerks and I loved that so much and I'm
gonna make a video about that too and
people that are homophobic come for me
I'll be waiting for you my friend one
