so bright I can't see oh so the good
thing were Indians you can go on the
roofs of all the houses so I'm on the
roof right now wearing the same shirt
and I've been wearing I can't see
anything
hold I soaked up so my face probably a
mess right now because I couldn't wash
it we didn't have running water for the
good day so the power's out all day
wi-fi's wins a struggle and absent
struggle we got this like Wi-Fi box and
it worked for like two hours and also
yes I uploaded a vlog in a main channel
video myself like three other vlogs to
upload and just stopped working so I've
come to terms with it I'm like three or
four vlogs behind and I kind of feel
like I'm talking to no one now because I
don't know when you'll see this but I
want you to know I tried I'm out of
breath
I think I feel it there's so many things
I want to tell you and so that comes
overwhelmed sentimental thoughts and
feelings to share with you right now I'm
a little bit stressed not stressed from
a little bit like I'm in a situation
where I just announce my tour and have
so many things to do I can't do any of
them because it have Wi-Fi I feel like
it's teaching me a lesson about like
adaptability right now cuz I got adapt
you have a choice freaking adapt just
what this has happened but it's a little
bit like when I go home like I had so
many things to do that I should have
been doing right now but I can't do like
there's so many emails there was like
emailing me be like urgent urgent like I
can't respond to you so yeah but it's
all good um I freaking love India it's
beautiful weather the vibe in India this
is the mobis let's just share well did
the vibrant India it really makes you
think I feel like in North America and I
said this in so many of my interviews
like people complain about really really
I don't wanna see stupid but small
things I know everyone has their own
problems until each each person their
problems seem like the biggest thing the
world like when you're in North America
complaining about like not having the
newest iPhone or like having to wait too
long for your waiter to bring you like a
three-course meal then you go to India
and you see like of course there's a lot
of welfare but there's a lot of people
also don't have that much but they're
still so happy if you look go through
the mysteries everyone you see is so
like carefree and happy with what they
have and it's like a big eye-opener and
all the things that don't matter that we
complain about
that's just some food for thought that's
why I really like India I love the vibe
of it I'm so excited to come back in two
months we need some awesome photoshoots
didn't do as much as I wanted to do
admittedly in terms like I want to make
a music video do all this it's really
hard to do all of those things because
the power goes out like I said so you
can't really charge your batteries you
can't really do stuff it's also really
really really really hot so like every
time do I make up or something just melt
off I'd also want to sell so hot you
feel drained for energy so you're like
no I just wanna sleep and like eat ice
cream
so we face a few challenges but it's
fine I'm actually go back down eat
something maybe I'm all congested for
allergies and my eyes I'm just I'm sorry
for the way I look right now I'm not
sorry actually I'm proud of the way I
look but I'm sorry that my eyes aren't
open um and then I'm going to possibly
try had to charge this battery I'm a
mess right now
I'm a mess but yo yo yo yo yo another
thing is that I'm like this is really
real now and because I just want the
message of my tour to be so meaningful
you know you care about something too
much tend to overthink it that's what
I'm doing that's exactly what I'm doing
this is gonna require a hard heart with
humble so we can set me straight
uh-huh today we're leaving a shopper and
going to Amritsar which is the home of
the golden temple or spending one night
there so that's what's happening today
and then tomorrow we're flying back bang
back oh my god okay I just walked around
on the roof for like 20 minutes after I
did that first clip I feel like I had
such a clear vision of what I want my
tour to be and like I had such a good
idea and I'm feeling so much better
right now
oh oh good good secret clear progress
progress progress okay so I just got
electrocuted and I lived to tell about
it
hopefully gave me some sort of
superpowers also my shirt says Ben job
what up t-shirt reference
okay so sentimental moment alert right
now the cutest thing just happened
basically my dad's dad whose house we're
staying at right now he even went to
came he put all those flower garlands on
me he was saying how proud he is of like
super with all that stuff and he just
signed like a thousand would be thing
and gave it to me but it is like for a
blessings type thing but then he made
this speech to me right now like English
and Punjabi and it was like he's just
like in it you know because he sees be
English but I've struggles little
buddies like oh we're so proud of you
never think you accomplished and you're
just like it was such a moment because
I'd obviously haven't seen him like five
six years and who knows you know touch
black if I will ever see him again
because how often do I ever come to
Punjab but like it was such a moment of
such a like maybe feel so good what
super women we feel so accomplished and
so validated like it's things like this
that matter it's not the money shot of
use another said woman like this like
that my grandfather is like saying we're
so proud of you and there's been no one
like this in this house and you've made
me so proud and it really got to me
because it really reminded me of an
honor I felt like for a couple minutes

you know it was like a thing now I feel
like both my mom's mom and my debt my
mom's dad and my dads are both of like
blessed super ohm and I'm having such a
