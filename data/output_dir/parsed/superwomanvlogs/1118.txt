what up everyone it's your girl
superwoman welcome to my blog channel
okay so yesterday on Facebook I posted a
status about people commenting on my hat
so if you read that status then this
video is kind of gonna be the video
version of that status so what's up if
you know anything about me which you may
or may not know you know you know me
through YouTube we YouTube friends we
fam you know that I very seldom get
angry about things um I've made a video
about any comments I've made a video
about people saying rude things to me
for the most part I swear it's not a
front like for the most part I have very
thick skin so I generally don't get
angry or irritated just in general and
very positive person but I will openly
admit that there's one thing that really
irritates the bejeebies out of me and
that is when people comment under my
videos you know amongst all the sexist
racist ghetto comments when people
comment saying oh my god super would
take your effing hat off or take your
hat off now if you've noticed the way I
deal with most things that your take me
is I'm really sarcastic and I I deal
with them very lightheartedly and in a
very positive funny comedic kind of way
so hello welcome to take your hat off so
yesterday my status basically said hi
hello person who tells me to take my hat
off how are you where is your nearest
hat store uh-huh okay get in your car
right now go run now now drive to the
hat store go go buy a hat okay these are
debit cash buy the Hat now go home now
put that hat on just like just like that
just like that fit really snugly you
look really good in your hat okay now
just take it off real slow just just
take it off that's right now shut
eff up and stop telling you what to do
cuz that is what it feels like to
control your own head stop telling me
what F to do with my hat in my head
compose I like wearing hats I don't care
if you think it's ghetto I don't care if
you think I'm trying to be black forgive
me if I'm mistaken I don't think black
people are born with a hat on their head
it's a personal preference it keeps my
hair out of my face it keeps me warm it
is a reflection of my personality do I
tell you to take a watch off your shirt
off your pants officer and people want
to say I'm ghetto for the millionth time
I know I come from Scarborough Malvern I
went to Leicester B Pearson High School
okay I embraced the get onus me not
being ghetto would be me trying to be
something I'm not
so in fact by me being ghetto I am
embracing the fact that I have ghetto as
F accept it and if you don't like it
there's a friggin X right there we're so
I don't know which side but whatever the
F side the X is on close the box but
thank you anyways regardless whether you
love what I do hate what I do thank you
so much for watching that's what matters
at the end of the day so I do really
appreciate that if you tell me taking my
hat off I freakin love you best friends
forever
conclusion I want to say thank you and I
love you all and have a super great day
and I hope you like my hat and if you're
someone who doesn't like my hat this is
for you
handle it like a bow
