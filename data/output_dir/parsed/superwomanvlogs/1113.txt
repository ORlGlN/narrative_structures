it if locative okay Dora
bloody blonde channel I'm I said I was
gonna make more blogs so here I am party
I've wondered why do you look like a
hood rat Lily what's up although you
usually look like a hood rat today more
so valid question I am going to the
Gurdwara right now and for all you why
these Black Keys and people I don't know
what that is that is the temple it is my
baby nieces first birthday prayer mature
thing got my quarter swags and my pink
socks you know I'm Accord the type of
person I like suits but the thing is
when you at the Gurdwara and you do like
work and help out in the kitchen and
stuff I can't do anything so I rocks the
bandana thing that's what I'm looking
like a button the hood rat situation um
what happened was yesterday I'm just
walking around my kitchen right now
yesterday my mom see let me tell you a
quick story my parents all just would be
like why can't you do their masters you
know I want to be proud of you what
neither we just bugged me yesterday
because the three day prayer my mom's in
the kitchen at our temple there's a
kitchen and there's like a food hall
where I'm gonna get served nah I got
community service type of thing and and
so my mom's in the kitchen little girls
are working there as well I guess making
door keys or whatever and she's like oh
you guys are so massive making go please
my daughter usually comes not only to
boost like all the BP all the old people
in the temple like older grandmas
they're like my boys because you know I
believe the community service thing
anyways if you guys are so nice like did
I get things and then my mom willing
knew that oh yeah my daughter does it do
you know superwoman and they're like
yeah and she starts showing me off I'm
at home AHA you are proud of me
you are yeah so she promised they might
have come so yes you have to wake up and
go to good wine those silver well
there's all these kids and they were
wanting my autograph them so you know
what you know what's cute about this is
better
opener because everything I do I go
stick coffee meters with my opener
because I was like you know what I'm
gonna use this power for good so we all
did like community service stuff
together so weird things in English
terms because the were disabled but I'm
saying community service anyways I'm
really late right now and I need
breakfast but what's the good water so
hello Simone say like I'm gonna vlog
from the car I look like such a nerd
with the sweater I guess good I don't do
winter jackets yeah I've assumed are up
unless I'm going off for an extended
period of time I don't wear winter
jackets and that's just because I feel
uncomfortable in him so if I know I'm
just going from the car to the place
like the door the door bag and I wear
sweater I know it's pretty bad but like
I do um
see I'm going headed to the corner like
I said and I was about all these two
little kids there I'm so humbled and
blessed that they're so excited to meet
me I'm so excited to meet them all the
time and it's like kind of almost like
finding the balance between you know and
that would be people looking up to you
and still being your self not to say I'm
a terrible person I'm still putting a
person but good but just you know
someone can go insane constantly trying
to be a role model not to say I am but
like I could imagine that drive me crazy
so it's the balance of that look where
the red light I'm not gonna show you
because that's my street name alright I
know crazy people might be crazy I'm
going the wrong way
no problem we're gonna reverse on the
road right now cuz I'm saying don't do
this
alright okay we got blessa what's up
snowy us my car is soda it's great
my car is so dirty

think about meeting little kids is there
just so like life hasn't evolved them
into these like socially what am I
trying to say here you know like awesome

gonna think or like kids don't have that
very much and it's just more refreshing
and awesome

delusional fullness right now but I'm
heading home and the brush all by the
way you know those days okay again you
explain the shot is like the sweet thing
they give you at the temple to eat and
it's really oily but but it was so oily
today but if so I saw it it was like so
oily to the point where like you could
put a raw samosa in my hand and like my
stove in the Sun that bad boy would have
been fried like that's how oily it was
but it was so good
