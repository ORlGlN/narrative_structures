I'm at an airport again yo what's up I'm
flying back to LA it is January 2nd one
day in 2016 and I'm rock alive leaving
home again like I felt some type of way
because I think the first time I left I
I knew I was coming back to Christmas
and now it's like I genuinely don't know
when I'm coming back regardless so I'm
ready start the new year I'm just about
to board my plane and grabbing some
breakfast and about a little water I
decided not to have coke for breakfast
know also minor detail spelling on my
customs form and I fully put the date is
2016 so I'm pretty much already nailing
it
this is like 150 people missing off this
plane right now because the security
line is so long and was
so there's like a hundred and fifty
people missing off this plane right now
which means we're probably gonna be
delayed because they just take off in
like ten minutes so oh no I'm just kind
up this is my thinking face
so I'm back in LA and my ears plug as we
were doing there and it's sunny and it's
warm it feels great and I slept the
whole way for my hat off my eyes I slept
the entire way so I'm feeling fresh I'm
feeling good
I even drank a whole bottle of water

then today I have a bunch of packages
waiting so we're gonna deal with that
