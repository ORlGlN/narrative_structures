while walking through Madrid and I'm
like life is beautiful and great and no
matter what horrible things may be
happening in the world in life there's
always a silver lining
always I'm being such a good girlfriend
is lying by the way I just wanna point
out to everyone I've been wearing it all
day every day I'm gonna head to bed now
I'm gonna do some a little bit of
writing first then I go to bed and
tomorrow is our last day in Spain we're
going to explore some parks in Madrid
and then the next morning we're gonna
leave so miss by the side to spend my
last day here I also just washed my hair
first of all how blessed I am to have
taking two showers today I was think
about that I was like Here I am taking
my second shower of the day a lot of
people don't interested one be aware of
your privilege number two is everyone
thought my boobs Ian so I was like hey
now you don't look in the morning in the
night let me know I don't know
turn it up turn I'll attack with Lele
thank you for joining me on today thank
you for doing my family altercation I
hope you've been enjoying the vlogs yeah
I'm not really sure if I'm doing a good
job of showing you what I'm experiencing
because I'm trying to balance also like
being present so I hope you've been
enjoying them and I just want to be
emphasize again that yesterday and I
posted a very angry vlog and I just kind
of wanted our Twitter spree about this
no matter how angry I was or still am
and no matter how disappointed I was and
still am the answer is always going to
be problem solving unity in love this is
just no benefit of just being angry
unless your anger or disappointment
turns into motivation trends into the
desire to hustle for change and so if
you are disappointed or upset or maybe
you don't agree with anything I'm saying
and you're a trump supporter in which
case I don't hate you I just disagree
with you but that doesn't mean we can't
have a civil conversation and still
maintain our relationship so I would
just I just no matter how you're feeling
in regards to this or maybe you don't
care at all and you who are in some part
of the world readers like I don't even
care um I started with anything you deal
with in life that's upsetting or makes
you angry but you've got to turn that
feeling and emotion to something
positive and productive that is what
makes you an evolved human being and
that's what will make you successful and
that's what will make you happy and
that's will give you purpose and so with
those thoughts I'm gonna say thank you
joining me on today tomorrow we spend
our last day in Madrid people if you
like it subscribe if you like it
subscribe so Madrid is pretty much like
the street we're on is kind of like the
Broadway of this area so it's really
cool is our musicals and
it's very busy we're just searching for
food right now on the waiting list for
TGI Fridays because when in Spain eat
food that you're used to I guess I don't
we had a lot of Spanish food as well or
searching right now and that's what's up
how was a train you like the chain yes I
fell asleep the whole time I sleeping I
was drooling the whole time
