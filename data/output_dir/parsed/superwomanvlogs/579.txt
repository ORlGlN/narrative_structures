it's way before my wake-up time good
morning the times around 10:30 we are
headed to my family cottage chase is
coming with us we're just gonna
literally do nothing when I go through
my chil barbecue a little bit me eat a
veggie burger
and chill the eff out today is Saturday
I am also heading back to LA tonight so
going to the karcher a little bit coming
back home and then my flight to LA is in
the evening that's what's going on my
body kills from the gym yesterday is
this yeah I saw like yo this is like
some soft stuff I just go to gym
everyday they were hurt I feel like I
got hit by seven trucks that were driven
by writing off sources and the
rhinoceroses just had big mac combos
super-sized under a racist and they
hated me so I might be hotter here today
than it is in LA it's 29 here in the
area we earn and my dad is using the
broom to strike some cobwebs now usually
I believe in like you quality one love
and I don't want to harm other living
beings but when it becomes like me
versus them we have to walk through a
web to get into a house then I'm gonna
have to be like nah I can't do that I
can't I can't do that so if there's a
lot of spider webs
it's the cottage you might remember I
vlog in it before chase is here Jesse we
can show you need to tattoo I never come
here every time I come here Michael you
know we should really come here we're
often Jan and I never do it we're gonna
do barbecue a little bit first we're
gonna make someone happy' deal but first
I'm gonna edit my blog from STV like
Canton post if there's no Wi-Fi here
that thing when you come there's no
Wi-Fi took a legit getaway it's only
like less than an hour away from my
house but that's what's going on I know
my cart is closer than your house yeah
good you know everyone I lay there like
oh my god where this place is so far
sick 30mins way I'm like one of my
closest friends lives 55 0 minutes away
and that's normal with the four seven
the highway goes straight to me yeah
with the toll room it was like a normal
high we took oh my god I might go check
out of her
yeah we will be ready yeah I mean we are
already like kind of yep ships we're
friends mm-hm
you know what I'm just finishing editing
just finished editing I realized by
editing my vlogs I realize two things
one I don't speak English very well I'm
editing my voice I'm like I sound like
I'm like English is not my first
language because I don't use words
properly by the way the waters right
there we'll go chill by the water in a
second second thing and someone
commented on this as well yes I say the
word dope a lot and you should know that
in my vlogs like when I don't speak
properly I'm saying the same word often
it's because I'm just really being
myself like on my main channel it is a
bit more me being cautious about like
being funny and presenting things a
certain way my vlog channel I'm honestly
being myself that's why like if I say
the word doped 50,000 times I don't
realize it cuz I'm just talking to you
how I talk to one of my friends when I'm
talking with my friends but yeah dope
dope dope dope dope yo sup dope so like
oh that makes people better but I'm
sorry if it's annoying
I'm sorry also not sorry because that's
who I am and I want to be myself but um
that's what's going on finish editing
it's a beautiful day it's really really
beautiful day nature land I'm about to
go sit by the water and like just chill
the F oh we're gonna barbecue as well
it's all good vibes I hope you're having
a good day I also want to say based off
the vulgar just edited like we had a
really dope week Raptors game Selena
Gomez concert chill with Joe Jonas met
with Cena Gomez another Raptors game
like I just wanna take him home to say I
am not even for a second taking any of
this for granted I recognize how amazing
that sounds and how amazing that is and
I feel so grateful and blessed to
experience and I hope in some way that
you feel like you're also experiencing
it with me through my vlogs even glad my
not blog every moment of it I really do
hope people like we're in this together
because like I recognize I recognize
every single day how amazing it is and I
don't want to take that to brannad and
me saying in the vlog is not enough I
don't want you to also want to turn off
the vlog like I do think about these
things that I'm sleeping and like before
I go to bed and when I'm lying in bed
and I'm just like oh damn like I'm
really grateful and so so it's important
to remember to have those moments where
you like super grateful and I really
really am and it inspires me to just
want to go back to LA and work even
harder to have more awesome experiences
guys I told cam cam messaged me he's
like yo thank you so much taking me like
it's always been a dream to set course
that I was like you want to see more and
more I realized that life is about doing
dope things with dope people and
actually Selena said something to me
that really hit me because she doesn't
meet me before her show
then after we chilled with her she's
like I have another meeting we to go to
right now and I was like dude you have
me angry before and after your show and
she's like well during the show we pick
up through the fans and like tell them
that they wanted meeting before after
the show and I was like that's super
cool Mike it's so great how after like
so many years you're still so willing to
do stuff like that and she just looked
at me she said something so genuinely
she's like honestly you know what it is
and I don't mean for this to sound corny
but like after so long you realized that
truly what it is it is that it is about
the people and she after hearing her say
that I was like it's about people and
it's about good experiences about doing
dope things dough people don't go I'll
stop talking when taste that plates not
so hostile as when humble and I we still
remain friends for the most part look at
all the nature that's happening right
now
mad nature this mad mosquitoes also we
also climbed that tree and I took an
Instagram picture it's gonna look like
I'm so wet using relaxing but I was
terrified to death just let you know
that but nature its matter how humble
told me it's only you know two feet off
the ground but hopeful told me that's
only 18 and Elliott's 29 years that's
way harder in Toronto right now than LA
I just bring the hot weather with me
upper lips wet mad mad that's what you
thought dumb crazy but leave it kinda
boycotted by ideally a superwoman pack
once upon a time you love these gave me
these pillows and I took them back for
my car so I can stuff them into my
suitcase and figure out please put them
in my new place cuz every time I take a
little bit more things on just pack my
Nintendo pack my Nintendo

let's see nothing to you I'm talking to
my fans who are you talking to get that
out of here let me get back there That
moment when I can't find my entire
Nintendo Wii I feel even 10 minutes I've
been looking for for like 30 minutes and
I seem to have lost the entire console I
just understand everybody oh man I start
from the gym so they change everything
about the airport here like that
order of custom security it's actually
way more efficient makes me very very
happy
also one might I think I blog here so
often but one minor thing I was gonna
like rant about how rude the customs
agent was to me but then I'm like I'm
gonna let that negativity into my life
so I'm not gonna blog about it since
then we need some food oh my god my
backpack is so heavy I'm like dying I'm
about to board the plane and it looks
like it's kind of empty and I know there
