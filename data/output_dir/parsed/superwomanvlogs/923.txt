a real human being moment I need to
enjoy I got this elevator though so
today's one of these days as testing my
responsibility levels because all
youtubers are turning up and that's we
know my guys I need to go back to my
room and make a video it's Monday more
in a moment old hood yeah so as I was
saying all the other youtubers are
getting the sweet like having an amazing
time I was like oh I don't want to leave
I don't leave but I'm like honestly like
no I know I'm gonna go on tour I'm going
to miss a lot of videos Beleza Latvia's
my mind on Tori at the salon excuse
upload video and I just I know it's like
most you can companies ok good into a
blogger which is my thing like I can't
enjoy if I know I gotta make a video so
I'm gonna make my Monday but you have no
idea what I'm making it about but I'm
gonna figure something right now it is
12:30 a.m. and we don't do this oh yeah
today I made my tripod out of my youtube
gift box a Kleenex box Kleenex boxes are
always so key and sital speaker thing
that was in the room there's a little
bit of a tilt slide to stuff from
napkins in there to bounce it all out
but it happened then we did it that's
the point
so today's I'm not evil on my face today
um you know it's really sweet
I have like it genuinely really reached
me so many youtubers and like it was
Matt and it was ASAP science and it was
like a few other people they came up to
me and they're just like I just want to
say like your hustle really inspires me
and I was like what do you mean and
Matthew says something really sweet like
honestly when I think of like what the
definition of hostile is something
really hard like I always think about
you like I constantly think about
Jenna's really inspirational when I do
my own work and I'm just like what
and ASAP science is something really
sweet as well very much were like every
time I really stress and doing work and
we feel like we want to go to bed not do
it they say to themselves they're like
what would Lily do and I'm just like
like say that about beyond
it sounds really sweet to hear them say
liked by my fellow peers in this
industry to say like your work is being
recognized I was like oh my god that's
super sweet I was super validating I was
like you guys are the sweetest cuz I
look up to them too and I get inspired
but them too and I think what is it just
like I was thinking about that I'm like
even the fact that I left the party and
just like why do I do this why am i
working why do I work like this and that
I like really tried to pinpoint I think
what it is is just like I'm just really
grateful for like a life and I just
think a really deep sentimental moment
but it's like I know what it feels like
to like not want to live anymore like I
know what that feels like and so like I
feel like when you've been in that
feeling and then you have such a
wonderful life afterwards and like you
realize the potential to do things like
you I just want to freaking give it my
all because I know what the bottom feels
like so like let me know what the top
feels like now and I think I just I'm so
grateful that I want him like work as
hard as I can
I this is way too sentimental right now
I can't I can't do this and chase is
here okay chase does like disappeared
someone the hotel and I don't know what
the hell he went and I'm like getting
concerned about him because he's not
replying to her messages so why am I
everyone's mother my videos two minutes
way from uploading it is 3:30 a.m. I
like this video it's a cool video I like
it it's cute

tell you if you live in India big big
big news so a billion and bazillion
people keep calling and asking if
there's still tickets both available my
India shows and they're not check your
email if you bought a ticket to my India
