a.m. that three hours of sleep thanks to
the airport we are heading to Atlanta

Atlanta so hopefully dig a nap do a
sound jet do the show excel check my
emails all of a bunch of lame-o's sudden
all that trying to get much less awful
before my show in Atlanta he's goddamn
letters really the home they really
screwed our issues over
I'd like to pay $550 to get these
letters on the plane for this three
boxes I think it should sell to us over
weight charger because bleed or not I
think Air Canada $75 it's almost $200
per box
I was like the box weighs nothing
literally nothing so a little bit
annoyed at that I'm going to like Google
some stuff and find out what a better
method would be shot with these damn
letters it's okay to persevere I'm not
that far on the plane I'm not going so
hard the Gulf aside as we like I'm

let's see how we did
mission complete twice I am honestly so
on top were three and I am so proud of
myself because I have come such a long
way from htu I in terms of the even list
or smaller and less produce I'm getting
better mentoring emotional dealing with
mishaps for example stay with the mic
when else old lilies would have been
like is a old you know there's not just
old and you really just more involved
but let's evolve movie would have said
what's the app and we're not pit and
we're going gills and although I was
like are not ideal I feel like I'm just
way better at practicing what I preach
which is focused on within your control
and a mic went out I wasn't like all I'm
going to kill everyone because my
quenelles and what can I do in this
moment on stage as a performer to make
sure this is so educating and there's
been a lot of mishaps or something that
kind of in like focus on within your
control focused on doing the show
there's a muscle way more present on
stage when I'm on stage I'm not just
going through the motions not that I was
a to us when I was meant for sure now
like so much better I think the things I
need to say we also like being
completely there and remembering the
moments and creating the memories so I
only have me what really happy you are
