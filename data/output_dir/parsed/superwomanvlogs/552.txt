we's back in the lilypad son
and daughter because that equity though
we're back I just learned a few hours
ago I already unpacked my suitcase
kill me game as soon as I got home I
packed my suitcase look at me this is
when an adult looks like my ears plugs
or can't really hear anything but let's
talk about the fact that everyone and
their mother and their mother's neighbor
has messaged me about Game of Thrones
and I haven't watched yet yesterday was
a season finale which breaks my heart is
that music wait a whole new I feel like
Game of Thrones just started you know
ten episodes have already passed now we
gotta wait a whole new year to find out
what's gonna happen so tonight I forgot
my work and when watch this episode
which means I cannot be on Twitter and
on social media cuz there's me spoilers
everywhere but according to everyone
that messaged me it was the best episode
ever I know I said that one last episode
apparently this one was better and so
the next person to text me with some
spoilers is gonna be headed I'm gonna
put in Sansa Stark your Bolton if you
text me letting me know the mesh because
I'm gonna watch a shame we're back none
these would come over a few hours and
just clean the place a little bit do my
thang and we back here I still have my
boo boo petition okay I'm still alive
putting my Invisalign in after so many
days I'm a bad person
and that's what's crack-a-lackin' also
you I have a lot of shoes look at this
my shoe collection is just kinda growing
out of control I dancing tuna music
alright when we left the car was about
trust let's see what today's card is
about my god I clean my room so good
right now there's not a speck of dust
room well maybe dust but not close all
right here go it was a snake it says
story of my life story of my laughs okay
as I tell myself the story of what's
happening in my life I choose to make it
the kind of story where even the tough
parts have a soul have have a sort of
inner beauty it's ultimately a happy
story where every character no matter
how wicked is doing their best I love
that and then we tell you it's and let
me tell you it will be worth it when I
earn that Pulitzer Prize the highest a
Pulitzer Prize for best inner monologue
I feel like all these cards have one
dope one-liner and this one's is it's
ultimately a happy story where every
character
how wicked is doing their best as a
Thomas of the story what's happening my
life I choose to make the kind of story
even the tough parts have a sort of
inner beauty that is awesome
I love that I love that so much make
your story one of inner beauty doesn't
matter if it's struggle doesn't matter
if it's Harding doesn't matter if it got
some challenges they got some ups and
downs just make it one of beauty and
beauty doesn't always mean positivity
beauty can mean a great struggle
sometimes beauty can mean a heartache
you overcame you can make all of those
things
now suppose crack-a-lackin' it is hot
I'll put on the AC I made some breakfast
imma take a shower then we'll get to
work you know what because it's super
Monday Lego was crack-a-lackin' so I'm
going through my comments and a lot of
people are confused about this whole
hacking situation the hacker didn't
change all my videos to dopest video
ever they changed it to something else
and I changed all that apparently
there's an option on you to change all
your videos names they changed something
else and because I couldn't go into
every single video manually I changed
all of them to Dhobis video ever the
help of YouTube has been YouTube's been
a great help to this whole process
they're now working on reverting all
those changes all my video titles should
be back within the day or so but thank
you so much for your patience and that
was what's holding behind us and people
who act out the people and think it's
fun
you probably find some friends just
saying so going through the gifts I got
at VidCon and I got one and I don't
