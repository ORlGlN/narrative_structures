it's the return of the fish I
I am using my vlogging camera all is
well in the world they could return back
to their natural state I can't find my
wrist strappy thing for it so I'm like a
bit awkward yeah right there um go ahead
just set little bit chilly in it a
little bit chilly um what's up right
into set I'm sleepy that's something you
like I don't you say that anymore
sandhya jazz ladies and gentlemen don't
be shy
I lost we don't know where we are right
now
there's also boogers in my nose so I
didn't sleep very well last night
especially sleepy I had a I don't know
if you guys have ever heard of this but
sometimes in my life I I have episodes
of sleep paralysis and if you don't know
what this is you google it it's a real
thing I'm not making it up it's
basically when you can't wake up from a
bad dream
and that sounds absolutely made up but
it's 100% true you can't wake up from a
bad dream we're having and I used to get
it really often on my grandpa passed
away like I just have dreams of him like
in the basically it's usually a case of
like
could you be louder it's basically a
situation where you're in danger and
someone is trying to kill you or attack
you and you're awake experiencing it but
you can't wake up and you're like body's
paralyzed in your experience so it's
like the most terrifying thing of life
it's a real thing at risk I had that
last night and I'll talk to you more
about Slater's but it's bitchess imagine
lying there someone coming towards you
and so in my dream I repeatedly kept
getting up but in my dream there are
those movie sequences or like they get
up and they're so dreamy and again
that's how it was
I'll try what the dream was about later
so now you can see everything with my
new camera so I realized the last clip
of me was like me tell you about my
dream very terrified and uncomfortable
but that's how uncomfortable they make
me so don't think I'm like you know a
lot of the slugs gonna be about that
because originally couldn't fall back
asleep like I was horrified and I say
what the dream was about I've never had
sleep paralysis featuring anyone else
except my grandpa but the first time
that's not I had it it was featuring
jazz yeah I'm scared of her basically
what happened was because we're sharing
a bed right so in my tree unit she was
upset about somebody and then I was like
oh no don't worry about it
and then she like I don't know what it
was I think I hugged her and then she
started strangling me and then I was
like I saw myself die and then I woke up
from my dream and I was like saw her
sleeping and I was like oh my god Jess I
got you okay
and then she woke up again okay and then
starting again and so it happened like
four or five times where I kept waking
up from my dream terrified like packing
and then she was like oh my god no just
for dream dory but and then she started
killing me again and she's actually
attacking me so viciously and now I feel
like I can't look at her - I can't look
at her Jessie she doesn't know this by
the way it was the most terrifying thing
ever I can't maybe
again just continue interfere evolve
yeah I'm so sad why I've never been so
good my because you're trying to kill me
you're so rude
I'm you're taking it personally and
something I didn't do I like woke her up
