usually people dress up for musicals
I'll go out f this is what I'm wearing
um it feels so good to unwind I had such
an intense day can which is unwind
that's why I like like movies and
musicals and my mind can go somewhere
else and I like the creativity I'm sort
of sad for my boy to see a musical for
first time if you're watching this
you're like your musicals or whatever
they're lame the pansies dog you have to
experience a musical once your life as
well as social experiment live
experiment your thoughts on a musical
right now I don't know I've never seen
what they're gonna be like last things
all I've seen is yours why haven't you
ever gone to me mmm
takes me changes today when sugar mama
takes you and now you're gonna see
here's reaction after it musicals are
bomb they're so good for inspiration
hope you'll get so much inspiration so
much this is awesome
it's like an extreme amount of talent
and it's wonderful and this is ghost
I'll say but if you notice but
everything happens in musicals live you
know that's right every sound you hear
every vocal you be like everything is
life this is possible everything is live
so underneath the stage race to the
orchestra and you'll see the conductor
so under and for the stage the entire
song they're playing lively Chicago sooo
yeah so it's completely live whoa
I obviously can't vlog during the
musical but check it out these seats a
since 8 a.m. dear mom to move on up um
even if I can we'll see what happens o
musicals are so expensive though stuff
alright so we finished washing musical
is the second time I'm seeing if there's
a red light there sorry second time I'm
seeing it fell of it all over again
genuine reaction holy crap that was
intense
that was super intense Wow like intense
good or bad very good like that punched
me in my field it was cool it's cool cuz
I know the sort of The Wizard of Oz and
then they just took that story and they
just like I don't know wicked is like
the prequel it was like the prequel and
they just flip everything over on its
head and these people are ridiculously
talented Wow I guess maybe just even
coming off a tour and working with the
choreographer and doing work backstage
to just make things happen and watch
people change costumes it's the whole
like next level of that did you enjoy I
love
