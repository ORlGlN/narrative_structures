happy birthday zoo 365 days of vlogging
one full year of vlogs it feels like
just yesterday I was sitting right
outside my room deciding I'm going to do
a live look today and it's been three
hundred and sixty five of them now thank
you so much for joining this amazing
journey it's only to get more crazy I'm
just like thinking back all the amazing
things we've done in 365 days and I'm
like but I am headed to San Francisco
right now which is kind of a bummer
because on the one-year anniversary of
our vlog Channel I'm going to spend most
of the day on a plane which is kind of a
big bummer and it's kind of like I'm
flying there today flying back tomorrow
and the journey is like five and a half
hours both ways so like both of my days
I feel like being wasted on planes but
I'm gonna try to do as much work as
possible on a plane you know what I'll
do I know what I'll do I'll vlog up and
tie down the plane then maybe I'll do
like a sick montage or the last ten or
six five days unless I just don't have
time to edit that in which case ignore I
said that by my try
no matter how many times I do airport
security it stresses me every single
time
so Toronto Pearson Airport is my local
airport and I use it all the time as you
know and they just recently changed
security process it's like a totally
different structure and I was like what
you guys changes I was here like two
weeks ago they look at we just changed
it and it's so much more efficient like
all thanks now that I'm moving yeah it's
like so much more efficient that was so
quick oh my god good job Toronto she'll
call
would you floss ago I mentioned Air
Canada has these bomb cookies this might
be the way that Air Canada wins my heart
back these cookies are so damn good
consistently mmm much aboard my plate so
long I'm going for less than 24 hours in
literally less than 24 hours and be back
on a plane so we shall see about that
and I went it's opportunity to say 365
looks let's see what we did to the thing
I hopefully had time to edit I decided
to do daily vlogs after my trip I'm
hungry and I'm sleepy and I don't know
what to do the last day on set
on behalf of humble and I love winter

so they gave me this medicine and
there's two pills and then I had to take
it with this thing that had supposed to
help a sedation and I feel weird made my
senses but they would I do something

Russian and how to pressing days and for
no apparent reason I'm upset and today
seemed to be one of those days I feel
like death I'm freezing cold I'm
shivering I don't want to do this
anymore
the journey continues if you like it
subscribe if you like it subscribe if
you like it subscribe hi did you enjoy
that oh my god that was so amazing
wasn't it all things we've done in 365
days and in that time I made to San
Francisco so welcome to SF baby this is
our home for literally the next like 12
hours less that's how long it took me to
calculate the math oh my god that's a
calculation phase um I really really
like this hotel it's really dope got the
TV got like a desk area I can do work I
appreciate that got this little thing
got the senior let me show you this part
the washroom like there's a door here it
opens to the top I had it I was in a
relationship and Bay was here it'll be
real sexy but I'm alone so probably
scoop it's on there but yeah the
washroom and it's all dope but it's like
what like that life your life or your
other look at this pretty cool right mr.
nut shower okay okay this is really cool
though and there's a door and we should
had more time and the post 24 hours like
the one time I'm here for like eight
hours did a brain swim close yeah
24-hour pool myself a jumper like this
yeah me yo yo yo yo what's up the time
is around a little bit past midnight
here although it's like 3:00 something
back home in Toronto I'm going to head
to bed I have no idea what time I pick
up is tomorrow no one has told me
anything that stresses me because I'm a
control freak I like to be organized and
Nonna's told me what time i pick up it
so I'm just gonna guess at what it's
going to be which is a little bit
annoying for me the Wi-Fi my phone's not
working and because I don't have an
American phone number I'm sorry you know
it is because you just have a moment of
real talk I've said this a billion times
let me say it again my life is reaching
a point of like I know I keep saying up
to move for various reasons I need a
functioning phone I'm in America so
often it's just gotten to a point where
like the fact that my room is not
functioning my phone is not functioning
I'm going back and forth my schedule so
after like it's reaching a point was
like I'm mad at myself because I should
have moved a year ago I should have
moved a long time and all these things
like comfor and all this other crap is
just an excuse it's been an excuse and
I'm just so looking for every time I
feel like sad or moving I'm still gonna
be sad moving with my family and friends
reminding myself like this will actually
simplify so much of my life
I have this thing where every day if I
ever got a stressful day not every day
I've had a stressful day I'll sit down
before I sleep a little to say okay what
could you've done differently today to
alleviate your stress small things
whether it's having a charged phone or
having a charger on you were like
getting directions in advance any small
thing what could you have done to
alleviate your stress and moving to a
hey is gonna alleviate so many of those
things cuz so many things right now are
out of my control
they're out of my control there's
absolutely nothing to do about them so
my phone company's blocked my data
because it's like you're roaming too
much and first you're safe but we block
it that's just like I just can't I just
can't
I'm gonna shut up now go to sleep but
more importantly 365 days of vlogging I
can't wait to see what we do over the
next 365 days it's gonna be epic
different if you thought this year
vlogging was sick you'll just wait until
the next 365 days because team super for
