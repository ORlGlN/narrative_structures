just kidding me
good morning good afternoon I have just
come to terms with the fact that I
cannot wake up early it is fine but when
I wake up I'm gonna conquer so it's fine
doesn't matter if it's so late that it's
not double digits now again single
digits but it's fine you want something
it's the morning somewhere in the world
right somewhere in the world right you
record you know what I'm talking about
today is super Thursday we're gonna work
on a video I'm gonna catch up on some
emails gotta do some other work these
are normal things I have to tell you
that's something exciting is happening
I've been working on a birthday present
for my mom birthday is November 13th and
she's kept saying that she wants to go
to Barcelona so like a month ago I
emailed my team and I'm like this week
in November do not book anything but I
haven't told my mom yet and I've been
doing some research and I want to ask
her like cuz I think I'm gonna go to
from Barcelona to Madrid so like I'm
gonna FaceTime all right now and tell
her like mom happy birthday and take me
to Barcelona and she will either say
yeah it was just like no I don't want to
go those dates so I can't like
completely surprised her and booked the
ticket cuz like she's the tell me she's
free those days and where she wants to
go excetera but I was gonna vlog that
moment um I know I just want to be
special between my mom and I said I'm
gonna FaceTime her right now and tell
her that bro her birthday I'm taking her
to Barcelona and I see she says so talk
to my mom and I didn't even say anything
to her mom this is what my mom said to
me is what she said to me okay so mom
what having think you're having
Thanksgiving dinner and what are you
gonna make for Thanksgiving dinner
I told you what my ass is gonna battle
the turkey well I was making I just I
told you our family our version of
Turkey is lasagna I'm gonna miss the
design after my frozen lasagna oh my god
not the time is five something is fish
writing my video idea I'm about to
record it it is going to be my thoughts
while getting ready this is actually
based on a true story because the other
day when I was getting ready I was like
the same crap goes through my mind and
happens to me every single time I try to
do this process I would like to know if
I'm the only one so I'm about to that
video and the sun is shining everyone's
having a good time that's everyone
everyone you have a good time everyone
everyone you having a good time
conversations with the unicorn you're
gonna corner
have a good day oh my god what do you
think what team super yeah and what's
your favorite thing to eat oh my god
good conversation I'll talk to you later
eh how the kids they good hi yo seems
cool
alright cool um yo that's what's going
on you know I just pick my pimple buddy
just finishing this video can I be
honest with you and be realistic honesty
our
you know I despise something I've been
doing for six years actually I hate that
hate I strongly dislike having to shoot
skips myself like on a tripod moving
lighting around to be honest even other
people do it annoys me I think the
process of moving lights around and
adjusting a tripod is so annoying
my tripod gets stuck on things the
lights are always falling it's just a
mission in that you know the next thing
I always do and I literally like yell
out loud to myself I will act out an
entire segment literally an entire
segment look at the camera and realize
that Emrys record so I'm just speaking
to no one for no reason I'm a stupid
person I'm a stupid dumb person it's so
hot I mean popcorn popping release my
video it is 10 12 p.m. I should I have
this thing I'm only eating like one meal
a day it's not great but I order some
food watch some Walking Dead I feel I
have a meeting with Kyle would never
happened because he knows it's video day
and he's a sweetheart so we're gonna
meet later on tomorrow I am have an
all-day shoot for our epic Rap Battles
I'm very excited about right you do all
right yeah I know I
again I will talk later get out of here
why not I'm talking to them but that was
going on and I just honestly I'm
planning so many things and I have so
many video ideas that I can't do by
myself and so I'm thinking I'm really
really thinking about hiring more of a
team it's still gonna be my authentic
voice it'll be my stuff but just like
because talking about earlier moving the
camera moving the light it's really hard
to do some ideas when your cameras on a
tripod like there's some really cool
things I wanna do or like even some cool
things where I wouldn't know how to edit
that and so I'm really really gonna look
to get a team that can help me do that
stuff and so that's gonna be exciting
cause I literally have a database of
like 50 video ideas I was gonna say
hundred but that was like girl you
tripping more like 50 and all that guy
you're right oh shut up um I like 50
video ideas that I want to make
eventually so I'm thinking about
upgrading a little bit you know I'm
saying you know I'm saying other than
that you get it ring ring like can I be
honest with you about something
something's bothering me I wanna be
honest with you about it past couple
days I had really been working that hard
and I'm not biessing like that I
actually feel guilty about it fits today
all I did was make a video I went to my
emails and I made a video let me think
if I did anything else today I'm
genuinely thinking I check my emails did
that's okay those emails are pretty
hectic that's fine but like I mean I'm
not being my Hossler self where I get
like 50 things done in a day and I think
it's because I'm kind of just like maybe
I'm still recovering from the book
writing process cuz you Moroney
all-nighters I put in arms like yo watch
a little TV it's okay it's okay and
that's okay maybe but I you know
December is coming up 12 clubs Halloween
you know I'm gonna do some videos for
that I got some things I should be
working on but I'm not and I'm not gonna
be mad at myself it's fine still many
videos so they don't have to do but I
think a major component of what it is is
that my sleep schedule is so apt I wake
up and get her better - I just woke up
earlier tomorrow my call times like 9 or
10 or something I'm literally thinking
the issue is if I go to bed now I want
me to fall asleep I should be lying in
bed for four hours
I'm thinking about literally going to
bed late waking up early and then
forcing myself to sleep earlier tomorrow
night and hoping that works but I feel
kind of guilty about the whole thing
because I know there's there's nothing
urgently I need to work on like for
tomorrow but there's things of course I
can still work on like for the future I
have a list of things I want to do why I
don't working on them maybe I'm just
like yo you know what it feels like to
have urgent deadlines tomorrow so you
don't have any Tamar chill out and
that's okay but I need to get back on it
I just wanna share that with you I need
to get back on it back on it
this doesn't order food I've been saying
I'm going shopping for a week
I'm nine yet what's wrong with me my
legs are 80 honestly I'm never shaving
again okay so I felt really guilty after
my last clip so I just cleaned my room
cleaned up all the stuff that I used
while shooting

for Toronto and I am made myself food
real food real food into an order I
found pasta my freezers I made some
mushroom pasta and I have two more
things to do I'm gonna watch an episode

those because they're like creative
things and so they won't be able to you
know be rushed but so don't feel the
best because I still not that much stuff

favorite characters just died I am NOT
