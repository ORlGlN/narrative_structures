I woke up like this just kidding out
with my makeup and I just wash it off to
record this log
good morning good afternoon I slept in
and it felt great I woke up early like
8:30 my brain just woke up because of
the time zones but I was like no and
forced myself to go back to sleep and
now it's like 11:30 or something just
watched my wash my face because last
night I was so tired I went to bed with
all my makeup my hotel room was a
disaster
so my stuff is everywhere but it's okay
you know why yesterday we did a good job
it's a good thing was great it was
phenomenal
Kyle already left he left at 5 a.m. in
the morning my plate is the not until
this evening so I'm still here for a few
more hours I'm gonna leave my hotel in
about 4 hours so I'm gonna write some
book because I haven't written any book
in the last two days and then after I'm
done one chapter I decided I can go back
upstairs to the pool and chill there
maybe write a chapter there but I'm
still sad to be leaving so beautiful I
got beautiful it is I don't wanna leave
I'm gonna order some breakfast
then we'll get to work let's do the
thing last couple hours in Singapore
let's make it can alright I packed as
much as I could but all my wonderful
presents that I got yesterday are on
their way to my room so I need to like I
fear that I wanted to buy another
suitcase I don't know we'll figure it
out I didn't know chappie everyone
through all my emails I have so many coz
that when I'm sleeping la's awakens oh I
get so many emails I ate as well and I
think I'm gonna make it a responsible
decision go to the pool first before
writing a chapter because Michael is
gonna be wet I don't want to drive grab
at them that's what I'm talking myself
although like yo you see that pool like
I need to smoke it in for a little bit
before I'll even have a long flight so
I'm justifying that this is OK Carson
we're seeing my blog camera again but
this is so beautiful I had such a
beautiful moment where I sat here
without my blog camera phone that talk
with myself and a talk of God and I was
like
life is beautiful and it's not just
because I'm in this stunning place it's
because like I don't know it just
happens but one thing case is like a
real deep but I was like I'm a big
believer of hustling hard and working
for stuff but I'm also very big believer
of like no matter how hard you work in
life ultimately it's still God's choice
what God wants to happen isn't happens I
was just thinking like I'm well aware
that I could have worked so hard
hostels as hard as I did but still not
have opportunities that have and still
not have a success I haven't still not
have the support I have and I was just
like I'm in that sense I'm very blessed
that you know whatever has happened has
happened because the will of God so it's
very great and then it also I was like
people ask me what gets me motivated
and what keeps me going I'm looking out
here and as far as my eye can see my
camera is not waterproof but that's okay
child is beautiful
as far as my eye can see right now
and the population of Singapore is 5.3
million people we have almost double the
subscribers as the population of
Singapore how can we not use that to
spread positivity like how can you not
how can you not do things that girl ever
do things you believe in or make
positive content
what's that many people in the family so
I'm just having all this deep cough
after feeling very at ease very happy
I don't feel negative about anything I
just been feeling very calm all right
wise intelligence now I should put this
camera away I just want to share that
moment with you I'm gonna go to the pool
soon because I got to go pack finish
packing and stuff but this is amazing
thank you for joining me on this journey
and thank you for allowing me the
opportunities to get here and I'm so
pissed in perfumers engraved in my
memory with my nipples not showing also
my stomach has little hairs on it but
it's okay because another thing I
noticed I tweeted about it I think we're
the most beautiful things I'm not just
saying this I swear I believe it
I see people walking around like all
different bodies and shapes and sizes
and their bikinis and guys being
shirtless everything or even if some
girls want to be shirtless whatever
whatever floats your boat and they're
just so confident in their bodies and I
love that I think that's real beauty
when you're like I don't care if I have
stretch marks I'm sure if I have
cellulite I don't care if my booty
jiggles of it I'm starting my stuff and
I'm having a good time I think that is
so beautiful
so so beautiful
so so that's my two cents I don't put a
lot of camera away now before you get
broke up I don't want to see you get
broke up again I'm back in my room life
is good
I'm 1% tipsy off my Cosmo I feeling good
my gifts were delivered any gifts were
delivered to me y'all got me such sweet
things someone made me a pillow
to give it to Selena like I'm glad to
think that I see her that often but I
got so much awesome stuff
I got a teddy corn that's right guys
Simpson's backpack and that so much all
my makeup thank God I got so much cool
stuff thank you so much y'all spoil me
on that know one thing I want to say for
all future meeting greets obviously I
love when you write me letters and all
that stuff I never need you to bring me
anything sometimes people will approach
me be like sorry I didn't bring you
anything on with what you took the time
to wait in the line to meet me here
never feel like if it bring me stuff but
if you absolutely want to is going to be
my humble request to ask you not to
bring me any food the only reason is I
am one person and sometimes I meet &
Greets I get like three cakes 50
cupcakes 24 brownies and I there's no
way I can possibly eat all that by
myself and so it goes to waste so for
the sake of not wasting food I'm going
to humbly request not to bring me food
at meet-and-greets because I would feel
terrible knowing I feel terrible knowing
that there's no way I'm gonna be able to
eat all of this so but thank you to
anyone that ever brings me so if you
absolutely do not have to but it's just
all the gifts are like so unique and
special this is why I can't be in a
relationship because no one's gonna
treat me better than you you see the
logic and go take a shower on your pack

vicious about the egg proper anytime

that's kind of annoying so maybe I'll
stop five hours down fifteen more to go
put aboard the second flight I broke my
book wrote some book on the first flight
so we're gonna continue that a second
play I didn't take into account the fact
that I would have to sleep at some point
though I ignore that but anyways let's
go alright so let me spend properly what
the situation is about the sleep thing I
didn't take into account that when I
land it's night I'll add it like 10:30
p.m. which means when I get home well
sleep but right now I have 15 hours so
if I stay awake to sleep right at home
that means I would have pulled an
all-nighter in accordance to Singapore
time if I sleep on the plane that means
I'll sleep two nights so options are
either two nights or an all-nighter I'm
gonna try it's like half half leave me
more towards two all-nighters so I can
like write some stuff like I didn't
think about that I'm like yeah I'm gonna
write my bootable time like Hello sleep
stoped bar
