I will pluck up uber good morning good
morning
I did not blog yesterday because I had
like a bit of a family day we took guard
and a few my I took my nephew's bowling
with the fans because I was my parents
anniversary a few days ago so we
celebrate that the family day but today
we have a lot of things going on it is
2:30 and I just woke up I don't know why
I thought might have fixed my sleep
schedule but then I ruined it again
jazz is coming over as video day for
summing my video and jazz is coming over
and we're prepping for tomorrow shoot
which is the clean up anthem we have so
much work to do for that literally so
much work I don't know what I would do
without her she's gonna come and save my
life and hopefully wasn't caught humble
into coming and help as well but first
and foremost oh oh and maybe eggs am I
am I look am I too lazy to make eggs
would you see what happens mmm
that routine dough tastes delicious so
today's one of those days where I'm
definitely struggling to think of a
video idea a lot of people are asking
for Grammys review I'm like skeptical to
do that sometimes because I know the
Grammys is not something that's
worldwide like I know a lot of course
it's very well known but some people in
parts of the country don't get to see it
I some people in some parts the world
don't get to see it and don't really you
know I'm not really into it so I don't
know maybe I'll do maybe not a lot of
people are asking for it so I might you
don't know what to do without tshat
reference so I'm about to I took a
shower became about to my buddy's old
fashions okay inking I'm gonna call my
grandma's review
I just don't think about me making
videos like I kind of don't want to do a
review on the Grammys like because I
live-tweeted it so I said everything I
had to say but everyone little cresting
1 and I I like to find that balance of
what I want to do and what people want
to see as well because obviously I know
I wouldn't be anywhere where I am
without you guys watching my videos so I
do want to cater to to a certain extent
so I'm gonna do the rama's review I hope
you like it hope it's funny let me know
if you can I it's so hard to gauge if
you like it like usually my grandma
reviews that guy said don't get that
many views and it's not about the views
it's about what you guys want to see but
I just hope that if you're someone the
world where you're the Grammys aren't
relevant to you that you still enjoy the
videos
that's my only concern I'm Jazz's a few
minutes away she's gonna come here I'm
gonna send her to do some missions
because she's my Saviour and I'm gonna
quarter in the mean time so it's a very
multitasking chaotic day that's gonna
happen but I'm excited Sam but record
yeah light no light just give me a light
no wait I mean just give me a light
no just give me that no yes
so get this I didn't wear a hat in my
video because I was like yo I've done my
hair flow flow flow free I just came I
she went to go print some stuff for
tomorrow's video I just finished
shooting my video I'm gonna edit it now
my teeth are getting better they just
heard a little bit here and there but
I'm really really happy because my
biggest fear was that I'm gonna one
occasion and my teeth are gonna hurt
something a vacation then went to Cancun
on the 14th Valentine's Day with my
girlfriends I'm so excited cuz that's
how you spend Valentine's Day with your
friends you guys gonna talk crap about
boys I'm King I'm totally kidding kind
of not really though Oh PS please don't
take that in a sexist way I also believe
that all boys should want occasion to
talk crap about girls cuz girls are also
dude you know I'm not one of those girls
I'm this no because I have this
conversation people quite often I want
to make a lot of jokes I like all her
boys are so dumb
but I also believe girls are dumb like I
believe people are dumb and smart
altogether I feel like girls do
ridiculous things and guys do ridiculous
things and we should just make fun of
ourselves you should just make fun of
ourselves that's what it is that's right
what the bloody highs this and I just
finished my video and Jaz did all the
printing that just happened from Howard
there's all the prints of us you know
Howard is about us and while the video
is uploading takes an hour like I told
you we're gonna go shopping and buy some
more stuff I have so we we have so much
