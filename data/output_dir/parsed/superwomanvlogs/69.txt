brain but I gotta do all bunch of stuff

addition let me tell you about that so
you know I'm not a fan of auditions I'm
not very good at them they're very
nerve-wracking but I've committed to
doing more I'm doing an audition today
it's not that much memorization but I'm
really really nervous about it which
means I'm probably not gonna vlog for
like the hour before and after it
because I'm just gonna be like we're
gonna try our best that's all we can do
morning you look so whiny I want to make
something for the fans they've been so
supportive we should make them so that
we should make them something holiday

I
and LM a LGBT acceptance whydentity
mrs. Claus bioody mr. and mr.
cheating
I was really inspired by cardi B didn't
think I gave you a very I said diapers
did not include Santa that verse there
is a minority because of the poor whites
no matter what and if y'all wanted to
touch of lily which she did put her
finger print in my first home unjustly
is her fingerprint there so I just
wanted to add back but yes
you know how really cute it is don't you
afraid
in fact that you cut the pipe Keane is
also is dedication that means a copy
into the Smurf community has a
representation with all of the blue wait
this is real ornaments my treat why the
hell is under sweaters I just put it on
better representation
like what do you do with this like to
make note of the hazard yeah I'm safe
yeah yeah really do be very probably
wouldn't be able to even be accepted to
be shipped so you probably won't even
get it okay we got the batters -
whatever you got that is here's my merch
representation of mr. gingerbread man
mrs. gingerbread woman over here we have
a nice hard to make up for the one he
does not really Santa Claus and mr.
Claus his partner because know hey we
know we have the team's super logo just
gonna have to lease a far better I mean
you'll see something that looks like a
Batman logo on hers but just saying how
does that frosty speak for himself you
want to go outside and get your wear
this sweater because that's a guarantee
if you're trying to get fully wear this
sweater it is perfect for the people
that you don't know specific type of
colorblindness where they don't know
green and red that's perfect for this
will say I can tell the logo apart from
um you'll see the other options I
definitely can see it was replicated off
the original okay let me just walk you
through what this is first of all this
in participe there's no tackiness you I
like them team lines and things right
and you've been waiting for
merch this is the merch right here to be
the first to get it signed by me
Wow like on everything I do I want you
to see the wink because it means
something I like little embellishments
on the sleeve of everything I do so this
little bow signs are the basic things
but there's one thing that's missing
that's kiss by me as well so if you want
to win this sweater cue the Wow's again
no one else do anything honestly cuz
that's kind of you know basic but if you
want that sleeve design the simplicity
you know no pancake spill s right there
you will not get beaten up you probably
make more friends wearing this sweater
if anything I also have occlusive missus
I have all these balls here that
representative of men and some women I
don't really read holiday I think you
review like the stereotypical route we
knew they might have just to make it
sexual because that's what I have I
think that's disrespectful and if that's
all on how you interpret my piece of art
somebody had a wall saying whose you
think in the best they won't be offended
if you say - fine - alimony and you
could win one of these sweaters good job
everyone don't worry everyone's a winner
oh my god big misako one that's still
trash five thought to get back united
we've done that and made some cute
things for you time to get to work and
in the shadow with okay okay just did my
addition ups every thoughts going I have
no idea how I did I forget you I have no
idea though but I have to say the
casting director was so nice did one
thing that was really dope and that was
you know usually when you go into
auditions it's like just you standing
there so even if the characters like do
on a computer cooking like there's
nothing there so you're like pretending
to serve I actually had a little setup
there and I was like thank you so much
you're a good human because you
recognize how difficult to this like be
doing crap like this way you're trying
not like seriously audition or something
that happen on this completely separate
no I was just thinking about this while
walking back to my car
you'd be surprised I know some of y'all
think I'm really put together and I get
why do I think they know we're blazer
and honest up I get a lot of work than I
am
we got that but sometimes and this is
gonna sound really sad but it's not
meant to be sad it's kind of just funny
when it comes to like me finding the
audition place like me in the room
waiting for an audition or like me
trying to talk to boys or me having boy
problems like anything in my life so
often I just imagine myself like this is
how I see myself I see myself being that
hot mess character in a TV show like
that's why I feel like I feel like that
person is like just happening great okay
I'll just wait here and drink all this
water and then with boy problems just
like I'm so which was it what are we
what's uh do you like me do you know I'm
the hot mess character in all of those
TV shows that is me I've come to the
conclusion so let's do happen nanny bar
so I am heading to Cassies 90s theme
party to survive I'm going the same
thing I pretty much more in the gender
Club got my overalls down my kicks on my
pins candies on her way over and then

leisure time I can't do to ladies when I
come home I need to do a script so yeah

write a script time get to work
moondust so - a woman so heartless that
time is 221 experts writing my script
and I like it I even wrote in a scene
where I tell you that you have to wait
and see what it's late goes to one party
but er I so much of a makeup off I've
discovered that my face is getting
slightly better a sneeze going away a
little bit here's my conclusion so for
the most part I'm not completely vegan
but I eat vegan a lot of the time like I
don't drink milk or almond milk I don't
have regular cheese that you have vegan
cheese so a lot of my diet is V minus a
few minor things but I'll tell weeks ago
I started to eat yogurt again Greek
yogurt because you know I love my yogurt
with the greige and the whole thing it
didn't let my face hurt bring up those
like oh it's the freaking dairy in the
yogurt so I'm mixing the yogurt even
though I love the yogurt because it's
clearly not doing me any favors and I
stopped eating it and now I feel like my
skin is getting better that's my story

storyteller we had a really good day
