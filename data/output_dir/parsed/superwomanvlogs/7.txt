I need to dress real quick I growing up
had a cat and that after and I can't ran
away and was very sad I've always wanted
a dog my mom always said no and she
always said when you move it on your own
you can do it everyone so my whole
childhood I wanted to are gonna get one
and that when I moved on my own I came
up with all these excuses as to why like
no I have my workout this and something
just clicked in my brain was like yo
you're always gonna have a reason you're
always gonna have excuse and this
applies to many things in life not just
getting a dog focus on me we always come
with all these reasons as to why we
can't do something right now why we
can't do today sometimes you just gotta
build yo it's now or never
