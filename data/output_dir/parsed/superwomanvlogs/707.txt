a comment real quickly because I didn't

only one comment from my yesterday's
ball I was like don't make fun of the
accent that people have in Mexico I was
like no that it's my planner lady is not
making fun of the accent what is that
time we have a trip there's always one
phrase that we feel everyone says that
we're not used to it's the idea that
they're calling this lady that we find
amusing not the accent yes we're trying
to do the accent like them but it's the
lady part that's amusing to us because
we never hear that like it's my plan
your lady like we'll never hear that
anywhere else and it's I love it I'm not
making fun of it I'm sorry thought I was
but that's my point of view on it and
it's hilarious to me and wonderful and

absolutely ridiculous so we're going to
Coco Bongo which is like our favorite by
the my fave comes your favorite my
favorite club in my school in Cancun
it's like this show and dancing last
time were there we danced on the bar
because I'm so packed and like there's
bars like a stage area so we danced down
there but I was like I'm wearing this
romper and with my socks and when she
golf and I'm like dancing on the bar

like it's a little why are people can be
able to see my booty if they're like
standing below me so what I just did was

ultimate she goes along I know my face

throat's all like ah um I don't have a
12 year old so these this is my vibes
and when you rompers well sir I'm
showing hello it's my 15th birthday the
right I had no choice I had to do the
braids because I can't get home to my
hair because the oceans in it so I had
to do this
swish
Oh
ah
Oh
yo so we're back and we need to have a
heart-to-heart because I just had a
really not good night and I'm going to
tell you why because I think it's
important to share this with you I've
stepped out of the room just because I
want to like speak to you about it alone
and I hope no one walks by but I had a
very irritating night for several
reasons but the main reason was this has
never happened to me before
and I know a lot of YouTube creators
have mentioned it's happened to them
like I know Jenna told me happened to
her once and a few other people have
said it's happened never happened to me
basically what happened was we were at
this club and it's jammed
freaking packed like jam-packed to the
core and so as I might eat you before
there's this little bar area where all
the girls stand on it's like a common
thing all the girls stand on it and it's
a pretty like narrow space that you got
to be a bit careful but um meena notion
you are on it and we're dancing and
these two girls come up and like people
often approached me being like hey your
fans watch your videos
I'm not going to justify the type of
person I am I know I'm a nice person I
try to be a nice person this girl came
up to me I think she was a little bit
drunk
I think her friend was a little bit
drunk and she came to me she's like hey
oh my god I want your stuff and I knew
you were here and I was like oh thanks I
couldn't hear what she was saying
super super loud and her friend I guess
not knowing was stumbling a bit and an
ocean cramp arm was like really um
falling
so my attention is now divided between
this girl and me saving a know she so I
could really pay attention what the girl
was saying I was like trying to hear
over the music trying to save an ocean
II long story short maybe I didn't give
her 100% of my attention and I was like
oh like thank you so much thank you so
much and maybe I ended the conversation
short whatever 30 minutes later a girl
comes up to me and says
and I quote hey your hair's really long
and that braid looks really bad on you
and I'm like I'm sorry what
he chose yeah your hair's really ugly
and long that braid looks really really
bad and my response was like okay and I
turned around then she's like yeah you
know my friend came up to you and she
said you were really really rude to her
and I'm like who's your friend and she
they called that girl over there and I
was like well how was I rude to her what
did I say and she's like you know it
doesn't matter just rude and I'm like
what did I say she then proceeded to
cuss me off to my face to which I
responded okay have a good night and I
turned around and I was just in a state
of shock because and then I saw her go
to her friend and I saw her friend yell
at her like why did you do that out of
it
so she that girl was clearly drunk
including stalks get it's fine but I was
just ruined my whole entire night and I
couldn't focus on anything and in that
moment I had several options of what I
could have done but I decided to find
that girl the original girl that came up
to me and I pulled her to the side and I
said hey I saw you yelling at your
friend because she came up to me don't
worry about it I don't know if she's
drunk or not but you don't need to go
bad about it don't worry about it
but you know what if I was rude to when
you came up to me I didn't mean to be I
don't think you realized but your friend
was pushing my friend and she was about
to fall so I was just like consumed with
that and she's like no no I'm so sorry
she apologized and she was very sweet
and I took a picture with her and she
was darling and had a conversation and
then I concluded by saying you know if
you do watch my videos like you say you
do you know I released girl love and all
I ask that you show your friend that
video because she could use some girl up
but yeah I wouldn't be honest with you I
am a unicorn I tried to be a nice person
I hope this echo isn't affecting you
hearing me but being a unicorn and being
a nice person doesn't mean I have an
infinite amount of patience it doesn't
mean that I don't have thoughts of
things I want to do sometimes I'm not a
perfect human being every part of me
wanted to punch that girl in the face
like she was so mean to me and she
looked great JIT when we hurt my
feelings and she was just swearing in my
face I didn't
the reason I'm telling you this a very
very long story which isn't never going
to make the vlog very long it's because
this is a perfect example of girl love a
girl love is feeling something like me
wanting to punch that girl and then
stopping controlling my mind and instead
changing my behavior instead of punching
her in the face
I found her friend and said if I was
rude I really apologize I would love to
have a conversation with you now but
this is what it was but I just want to
point that all the girls we don't like
it's okay to give other girls the
benefit of the doubt you don't have to
insult the way they look or be so
defensive and be so catty and good you
were mean to my friend Lee you could
have easily came up to me like hey you
know my friends a really big fan and I
think she wanted a picture with your
water conversation and I would've been
like oh my god I'm so sorry it's okay to
be nice and I'm gonna just pass this off
as she was drunk and it's fine but it
just ruined my entire night and I've
never experienced it and I'm still so
upset about it but let's practice more
girl up because we don't have to be like
that to each other and that's not okay
and it's not cool and I don't want you
to comment in the comments me like that
girl is always like no I want you to
also practice girl love and
understanding that is what I'm trying to
say is that you have to be you have to
be in this together as women to fix that
and change that and it's not okay and
the last thing I'm gonna say if this is
like a six-man clip I'm so sorry but the
last minute last thing I'm gonna say is
that I feel like I'm slowly becoming a
less social person in situations when I
get awkward and I get anxious because I
know being the public eye everyone's
always judging you no one gives you the
benefit of the doubt you know if I'm
tired people won't get it oh she's tired
people's like she's rude if you know I'm
not feeling well people won't say oh
maybe she's sick people say oh she's a
stuck-up douchebag so you know no one
will ever think that hey maybe she can't
hear what I'm saying maybe she's
preoccupied with something else it's
always going to be your stuck-up
douchebag and that's something I'm gonna
have to grasp and get used to because
that's not going to change anytime
but um give people who benefit out
sometimes okay to be a nice person
I'm sorry for this lengthy rank I'm
sorry not sorry for this lengthy round
but I was really upset by it and I'm
still very upset about it and I probably
will be able to sleep all night but
that's that's that's me that's me I'm
walking back to my room that's me that's
that's what it was when I watch your
face I'm going to bed I am so irritated
and annoyed and I feel like I'm drenched
soaking in negative energy right now um
kind of you feel like crying
how much cry Bosley what happens I did
in a series of things that was just the
icing on the cake but i'ma go to bed
tomorrow's in your day it's gonna be a
great day I want to get a lot of work
done tomorrow don't want to party at all
I want to do work work makes me happy
that's what I want to do work is nice to
me so that's what we're gonna do and
yeah it's going to be good because we're
in this together and it's fine and
things happen and we're still gonna be
positive if you like it subscribe if you
like it subscribe
we just gonna marry her now let's do it
she's a setup right
okay I'll show you the chapel - I was
gonna kiss you but you moved your cheek
oh whatever

you trying to lick me because that's
like a thing you do here's my face it to
