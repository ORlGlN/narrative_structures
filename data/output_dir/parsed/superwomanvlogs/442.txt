oh I have an itch
I was our last day in Madrid we're gonna
enjoy the day make sure it's a great day
because we were blessed to have these
opportunities but I'd be lying if I said
I didn't have a ginormous itch to get
back to work
I just woke up today and I was like you
know what I've done nothing for the past
videos I did nothing I've spent some
great quality family time I've seen a
lot of great places but you all normal
workaholic and I'm not saying that as if
it's like a positive thing or a negative
thing it's just a fact I'm a workaholic
and for me to have taken a back seat
these past few days you know it's been
nice but now I'm kind of like getting
anxiety and getting stressed because I'm
looking at my inbox and there's the
twelve collapse and there's so many
things I need to do that I should be
working on but I'm not and that's okay
roughly that's bad but I'm just saying
I'm now ready like I woke up being like
I'm ready like I already wrote my video
for Monday that's how ready Ike wrote it
in my sleep like what I was I just I'm
ready to get back to work and it's
itching me and I I'm excited for that
and I also like have to move and there's
just so many things that require my
attention so I've had a great time we
were going to enjoy our last day but I'm
so ready to get back to work and
hopefully this mentality maintains when
I got on the plane and I don't sleep for
12 hours although he's tricky because if
I don't sleep a little bit I'll have to
be up for 24 hours to keep up with the
time zone change I've essentially I'm
going to live Saturday twice so a lot of
things going through a mind but it's a
good day
we're blessed we're privileged people
and we should use our blessings to have
a great day and my goal for today is cuz
yesterday on Twitter let's talk about
this real quick I'm sorry I always do
these breathing grants I don't know what
the timer rent it's just like I feel
like you're my friend and this is this
is how I like treat people my friends
when I see them like but when I reply to
people on Twitter I just this is really
important for me to talk about when I
reply to people on Twitter I'm not
always like behind my phone be like oh
I'm gonna totally right that's I I know
I act sass you sometimes and I come off
like that but usually when I respond to
people on Twitter I'm actually quite
calm and being genuine I know sometimes
on Twitter it's hard to read people's
tone but I'm gonna be honest with you I
really am NOT a fan of what I tweet
something to someone even if it's me
genuinely standing up for something I
believe that everyone's like yes drag
them kill look I it doesn't have to be
that aggressive I don't want you to
attack people when I tweet them I
respond to them it doesn't make me feel
good because yesterday
had this little bit of a back-and-forth
with a girl and none of it was hostile I
was genuinely like hey this is what I
meant and I feel like we can be friends
for girl lovin Jean she was being pretty
rude back but I genuine like if you
would saw me in person responding I
would've been like hey like I hope we
can be friends I was very calm and I
just was getting a little frustrated cuz
I was like oh I'm sure I went on Twitter
thinking this is like a thing I'm trying
to like drag someone but I'm not like I
have not so that's my two cents but
today the goal is to be better than I
was yesterday and experience a great day
so that's we're gonna do this is been a
three-minute intro I'm so sorry
