and I just want one thing that's just
for me to do for fun standby actually is
a spectacular day because I have nothing
on my schedule which means that's why I
have one thing on my schedule shut up I
have one thing on my schedule but I can
fill the rest of the day whatever I want
here's the mission for today you have a
call to discuss some dope
yes figure out who's the more puppy
research office office decoration
Pinterest Maximus for today today also
only two people are in the office it's
Taylor and I all the other waste youths
are not here which means Sokka is gonna
be blasting which means the elites and
monopolies jailbroken beat us choice
last time are here I'll whoop you later
okay you get to work for now disorder
don't cross the border and the
conference call everyone's late only
person islands in the south coast and I
was some conversation on this conference
call she telling me about actually
women's our black panther the other day
when she tried to sneak she's drinking
water masago oh wow boom God why can't
you give me the ability to just do
anything not 100% I'm making pictures
boardgame so here's the vibe is the
color palette I'm thinking of okay this
type of like vibe right here
this colors pastor Levi
and then from my section I'm gonna carry
that on is pink sofa this they'll make
it happen on the wall that's what I'm
thinking right now
absolutely but in this chair for our
show I have a bit of a confession
well one before I get to the confession
I've watched all of Jane the Virgin now
I just binge watch last season freaking
yeah that's my thoughts with that number
two that they have a bit of a confession
I think I would be happier in life if I
did something for fun I know that's like
a very like drastic state but I think I
don't do anything for fun I do a lot of
fun things in my life but they're
usually because I'm doing them because
of work or because of something through
it but there's nothing in my life I'm
like I'm doing it not for the vlog and
often it's just for me for fun well I've
decided I want to do something for fun
and I decide that thing is gonna be
playing a game I'm messaging the only
person I know that can help me with this
just eat and be like I want to play a
computer game my favorite one growing up
with roller coaster tycoon suggested
gave to me that I can just do for fun
because I'm tired of like turning
everything into work I think that's why
I'm fatigued and I'm not working as
efficiently and productively or maybe
when you're watching blogs don't realize
that cuz I still do a lot of things of
the day but like I'm sorry efficient and
not is into and I think it's because I
turned everything into work everything I
do I'm like okay I'll make that a video
but I just want one thing that's just
for me to do for fun standby
she's typing okay she replied she said
that Nintendo switch has lots of games
is it easier to travel with and there's
a new Mario game on it I switch or you
know comment below you have suggestions
I want one thing to do for fun that is
for me open to your suggestions comment

goes I'm obsessed it's my park so far so
I've done create this dope swimming pool
look at all these people enjoying their
lives out here you live your life all
live your life in my pour right now you

swing by each other why don't you tap
that booty dog what's good what's good
fam oh snap what's good oh hello these
animations when I played this game oh
damn Jenny girl but gonna limp Ian
swimmers up on my theme part what's good
no just like that is 3:30 a.m. I had so
much fun building my theme park I'm go
to bed I'll see tomorrow like come
morning Saturday never stop right here
and say I did a lot of reflecting last
night I was lying in bed and neva tably
could not fall asleep I was like I
haven't acted like myself I mean like
Lily years ago would like be sitting
here and excited to do things and I am
excited about life I'm so grateful my
life but something just feels missing I
don't know what it is my figuring out I
think it might have been when I said
yesterday which is like the fun element
I played real cooz i couldäôt I had fun
doing that that's fine
today I won't go kind of be like you
know what you know what you're really
good at Lily I'm gonna give you a lot of
credit for it you're really good at
picking yourself back up you have fallen
so many goddamn times in your life
sometimes you don't even know what not
do down and this is gonna be an example
and I'm not just doing this for the vlog
I'm not just doing this first time I'm
doing this because I feel this I'm going
to sit here I'm going to plan some stuff
that excites me everything or some video
ideas excite me I ask how they're
perceived I am picking myself back up
for me for me and the reason I'm
vlogging this is because in some way
shape or form of you feel like you've
been knocked down you can also pick
yourself back up I am going to be
productive in a magical way today let's
do it alright make foolís up first
laundry that's right kid the Tide Pods
are actually for doing your laundry not
for eating
depends who you watch on YouTube also
shoutouts to this dead whose name I
blurt out who said that his daughter
unsubscribe me because I'm a cell up
make sure you let her know not eat ipods
because everybody else gonna tolerate
them yell sweet potato a little meatless
chicken breast with Diana sauce made
myself some lunch while dancing to some
soca and I genuinely just feel good
about my life kinda sentimental moment
to lose a vehicle sentimental moment is
every time I'm sad or not feeling myself
I embrace that moment and I feel it
that's okay to feel emotions but every
time I'm kind of out of that funk and
then I reflected back on it I always
have the same thought which is like do
you have so much food grateful for in
your life is amazing like thinking about
that the next time you're set just to
let you know that when you're not
feeling yourself it is just a funk of
course you should talk to people about
it and I don't want to generalize
everyone's feelings but I'm just saying
that the moral of the story is when
we're sad when upset it can feel like
the end of the world sometimes it's
usually nice if you reflect back to
every time right now you were sad or
felt disappointed for anything it
probably doesn't bother you as much
right now everything's on a spectrum
life is a journey I might eat this food
how I want to let you know right after I
made that little speech I realized I
brought two knives and and no Forks oh
okay don't rise at home we trained
professional Oh junior just texted me
saying she wants me to come with her and
her friends to go see annihilation which
by the way Gina's in annihilation and I
was like that's super dope but I'm
already going to tear cells to watch the
movie when T is super preggers so I was
like I'm gonna drag them to this movie

emails and I went through a lot of work
