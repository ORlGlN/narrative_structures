the time this is like a big deal for me
because alright first survive long
channel since then all of my vlogs Minh
called the time I this the time this the
time I met the rock the time I move it's
been so important to me but as I grow as
a person and want to do more things with
the luck it's very difficult to mold
things into that format of the time yada
yada it actually ruins a lot of like the
woody title ideas I have and so I decide
to let go
this format and officially retire the
time from now on my vlogs will just be
titles of what it's about and probably
more enticing and more just fun and
exciting for me this is the time it is
the last time a lot of work was done

a lot of decisions were made goodbyes
were had well let's see how we did today
