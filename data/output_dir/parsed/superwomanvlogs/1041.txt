of a conference call then have another
caught five and his video damnit try to
fit in an hour nap again so I woke up
from my nap I don't even know if I told
you I took a nap but I took a nap
because I did tell you that I told you
that I have to take naps but uh I woke
up from my nap had a conference call
it's a lot of exciting things going on
none of which I can share with you but
it looks like this month is going to be
absolutely just there was a period of my
life where I travelled non-stop and
stopped and my life is chaos and I
stopped that for awhile and if you like
this month
my life is just absolute chaos traveling
never home and I'm so glad that I get to
daily vlog about it now because you can
hear all about it yeah trying to find
something to eat right now I'm trying to
avoid game Chipotle so I was walking
down the street aimlessly still gonna
make my video it's still video day but
so much nor any I'd find a rock star I'm
to find a rock star machine rock star
I'm not wearing a bra how did I get here
I don't understand I don't know I was
walking and then I just know I need to
have to probably see like I drew I think
they placed them here strategically
strategically I was in a rush and he
said me so I couldn't find anything else
much but like judge me judge me judge me
all right I almost get my Chipotle on
with my rock star
I feel like everyone's so nice in LA
every time I love Laguna people are nice
and I mean it's like this thing people
think in LA people are just very like
rude and I feel like I've never
encountered one person like I just ran
to like a sheriff okay how are you have
a good day
you look so nice and people are is like
because I know they're super Roman
people shoot you up mr. Superdome
unknown people have no idea who I am
does he let you probably have no idea
why I'm sheriff had no idea who I am he
looks really nice it's like Ali has such
a pick me up like I really dig it
I dig nice people people are nice enough
good editors I'm gonna stop talking now
and eat all of this so good day so I'm
back in my hotel room I don't know how
this happened somehow I came home with a
cupcake and this is the story of how
this happened I'm a very impulsive
person so like if I see something I get
a good energy from it
I will go towards it I gravitate towards
happiness so like I was walking down the
street already so full and so this place
was called sprinkles and was like
colorful and I kept walking and I was
like you know the word sprinkles makes
me very happy I turned and looked at it
and I was like those colors are also
very cool so not even based on the fact
that I wanted a cupcake or not solely
based on the word sprinkles and the
colors in the title I was like I went
towards this I was a cupcake shop and
like yeah I'm gonna do this but a
cupcake red velvet cupcake just just
like that another stories as I was
walking home this is my brain for you
guys all walking home I walked by money
on the ground and I I think it was like
20 bucks first times I just thought -
and then I kept walking and then I was
like wait they don't even have a $2.00
bill as far as I'm concerned as probably
20 I didn't pick it up and this was my
reasoning for not picking it up this is
how much YouTube is asked with me and
television set with me I'm lucky oh well
just like a YouTube prank and I pick it
up in the second hidden camera and like
freakin fouseytube is going on this or
something my second thought process was
you know that episode of The Simpsons
when mr. burns has the money tied to
something and he's dragon McGee oh this
can't be real there's so many people
walking by this wise no one picking it
up this is this is something so I
ignored it cross the street but then I
was like yo I passed so many homeless
people on the way here I'm gonna pick it
up before someone else does and give it
to one of these people that really needs
it so I turned back around I was looking
at it from across the street and I was
like no one picked up no one pick it up
as I'm about to cross the street someone
picks it up puts in the rocket now it's
like damn it
and I feel like crap I should picked it
up and give it to someone who really
needed it but I didn't because I was
afraid mr. burns was playing a trick on
me
anyways I may eat this cupcake record a
video I'm thinking something along the
lines of impersonating other youtubers
since Halloween is tomorrow um I don't
have any wigs and like all youtubers
have funky mother-infant hair so I'm
just going to like make do somehow
someway but that's what I'm thinking but
first and foremost I'm a hot waffle
Praja okay this is me in this awkward
cave lighting first bite of the cupcake
there we go
sprinkles let's let's see what you are
about huh
y'all seen this come tonight y'all seen
this damn dis cupcake dough
I cannot even vlog right help you okay
so this isn't a complaint it's just a
mini rant of I cannot express to you how
difficult it is to travel and also post
videos because everything and their
mothers get in the way of doing this on
my hotel the Wi-Fi is extremely slow so
I'm like how can I get a faster Wi-Fi
thing all you have to do this isn't this
and everything they're telling me is not
working on the phone now taking my
laptop downstairs so the manager can
attempt to give me faster Internet this
homeboy made me come all the way
downstairs to tell me that he doesn't
know how to fix it that's what just
happened so now it's almost midnight
it's things can take like 12 hours
upload my video he call me downstairs
say you'll fix it I got there as I gotta
fix it could you be any more useless
could you be any more you so much I have
never been more frustrated Mike it's not
even loading the thing that lets me
click upload so like my video hasn't
even begun to upload because even to
click upload
that's not loading hotels like this
should not exist shouldn't you should
not exist I want to punch all your walls
