yup what if everyone it's your girl
superwoman you know how sometimes you
have dreams and most the time you don't
remember them and it's probably for the
better
okay so last night I had a dream and I
vividly remember it now the thing is
this is not the first time I've had the
dream this is a reoccurring dream for me
which is a bit concerning because I'm 24
years old on my 24 I'm 24 years old the
dream is that I'm best friends with
Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber and like
I said this was the first time I had the
dream I really believe I've had it three
or four times the same dream I'm best
friends with Selena Gomez and Justin
Bieber and I think it's because I watch
Family Channel last night and every time
I watch Family Channel I would dream
that I'm friends with all the people
from Family Channel I think it's because
inside I think they're so effing cool
and I want to be friends with them and
that gets reflected in my dreams but
this dream was a teensy-weensy bit
different because this time my dream we
were friends you know we're all friends
it was so cool I felt so cool with
chilli the Gomez Justin Bieber's like
yeah we're chilling in someone's hotel
room I don't even know and it was to the
point where like I was at you Justin
what the f you're not following me on
Instagram and he's like my bad really
let me follow you right now follow um
and yeah you know it wasn't a thang but
a chicken wing he just followed me like
I'm a vegetarian I don't endorse that
but he just followed me like it was
nothing and so we're so close but here's
the thing I was really close friends
with Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber but
there was a second when Selena Gomez
stepped out of the room okay and Justin
got really flirtatious with me and he
like was looking at me all like and I
was like baby baby I was like I was
confused
obviously he kisses me on the cheek like
really really like rotation Slean ah I
didn't object to it this is wrong for
many reasons okay hey I probably went to
jail in my dream because I hold is
Justin Bieber I don't think he's eight T
is the 18 I don't even know all these I
Selena was my friend and I just betrayed
her ah I feel dirty she just stepped out
and he kissed me on the cheek
but that the thing is like I don't think
it's talked of it I woke up a few
seconds after this right startled I woke
up and my sweater was half off when I
woke up I don't want to know why it was
half off but I can only assume that
means justin bieber made out I'm sorry
women of the world kids teenyboppers I
made out with Justin Bieber and I'm
pretty sure my dreams are real life so
Selena I am so sorry I I that is so
unlike me I can't believe I did that you
even in my dream like that's so unlike
me I bad bad I have a problem I don't
know why I had that dream I don't know
why I continuously dream that I'm
friends maybe one day in the future I
will be friends with them are all no but
we're all being the same places them it
all makes sense
and then I'll refer back to this video
but as it right now I'm confused
I don't know why I always have these
dreams that I'm friends with family
channel people I need an F in life I
have a pimple here yes because I've
discovered this hat gives me pimples so
I'm just gonna do that that yeah I don't
know maybe I'm just frustrated for lack
of better term I don't know why I made
it with Justin Bieber
I'm really sorry this is my public
apology um take me to jail
