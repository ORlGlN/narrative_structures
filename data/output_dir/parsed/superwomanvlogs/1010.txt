a hair tie broke broke my hair tie broke
is that English my hair tie broke first
thing in the morning I'm in chaos
alright I got a new hair tie I really
have not washed my face and I'd like
that anything so smelly I book is
everywhere but juice bad mace all good
my one my biggest annoyances in life is
when I'm tying my hair my hair tie just
like you ever experienced ladies and men
who have long hair I feel like I get
enraged when I'm tying my hair and then
you don't do hair ties explodes and I
just pause the first I'm just like
because I need to take in what happened
is I'm so annoyed anyways it's to
something I try to fix my sleep pattern
this is actually improvement because I
slept really late and I still go by two
so who are weird reductase Vidya days if
we my Maeda thought of my idea in bed
which is always kind of funny so
hopefully when I walk to a computer it's
still funny Peter still here in full
force don't know why he's just a part of
my life now um and then I went to Rick's
house later on today for shooting
something for a TV show and it's gonna
be real real fun first of a brush I'm a
PE I might eat some eggs and then we
have X amount of time it's one of those
days we have X amount of time to shoot a
video I'll probably edit at Eric's house
so dance was going live what is my life
this is like the third time this has
happened this is such a chaotic day so I
wrote out my video it is types of people
that drive throughs and I'm like trying
so hard not to have the sleepiness over
me so I'm trying to write it I like
haven't had a rock star yet whatever I'm
bout to go take a shower so I can record
and I'm like wait I still don't have a
camera and this is like the third time
this has happened I don't know why my
brain keeps forgetting I got bored
Elmer's but I returned it for I went to
LA and I don't have a camera because I
used marcus's for the last video and
yeah I don't these canons gonna I Canon
and me are gonna figure it out cannons
gonna send me water I'm gonna do
something but that's it's not here yet
and I don't have a camera so now it's
like I'm gonna have to go to Rick's and
maybe borrow his and come up with my
views me up early late that I just want
you to know that like I drove a camera
so I'm sorry if the video is late loco
tonight but yeah also let's have a
moment of real talk
you ready
yield okay I had actually like a hard
tart with humble yesterday and sometimes
I really sit down for this sometimes I
really require people to call me up like
because in my group of friends like I'm
so notoriously known as being that
workaholic and stuff like humbles makes
funny was a course ago we have to work
or lazy to yell at us because that's
just the type of person I am but I very
often need people to look at me like yo
you're slacking actually you need to get
to work and yesterday humble kind of did
that I prompted but he did it and I
needed it so much because like I've
really been slacking on vine and I'm
gonna just openly say it I supposed to
do 31 days of vine and I think I've
missed like three or four days which is
so unlike me like you guys know what the
twelve clouds of Christmas like I was on
I was like no this is gonna happen with
the vines it's like it's new and it's
hard for me to figure out and I think
I'm overthinking it I'm trying to like
go so above and beyond and whereas I
should just like also focus on getting
them done and committing to what I said
so I want to say I apologize for kind of
dropping the ball with 31 days of mine
but I'm gonna resume starting today and
I am gonna get those lines out and I
really hope you can support me because
it's hard it's like starting something
completely new and it's way harder than
I thought it was going to be and
obviously just like when I started
YouTube there's a whole bunch people who
are like stick to YouTube you have
plenty of items like oh this whole thing
again but yeah so I'm gonna get back to
mine and if you wanna support me on vine
the link is in the description to follow
me on vine because I will be getting
back as for now I'm going to shower and
about the hopefully crap out of camera
what's up I took shell and my armpits
are clean I look mad Johnny why don't
look mad shiny my dad does just shoot my
vine um as I mentioned I've been
overthinking this and everything with
life basically I've been in this like I
don't know honest high person where 2015
hit and I should have been like all
hustle I'm going to take over but so far
2015 I've been so like non-productive
and I feel like it's because I'm doing
the number one thing I always tell
people not to do every time people ask
me for advice if they feel like I'm
qualified to give them advice more like
yo don't overthink just do and I'm
literally not take my own advice I'm
overthinking everything every video idea
every vine idea I haven't it no but I
should do like this this and then have
this set and I think working on sets in
LA and getting used to that thing has
made me think that oh now the stuff
you're already doing and you've been
doing and it's been working you need to
like up the ante and use like half sets
like I don't know I don't because you
guys don't you guys just want to see me
ranting from my wall and I know that so
I apologize overthinking but stop
overthinking dot I'm gonna go shoot my
vine now where am i shooting my behind
what's happening hey no man this is my
basement it's me hey Doc yeah I just
killed myself in a vine um if you wanna
check it out

the vlog what if I do it then let me
tell you so my last team super shot the
team super loves everybody shirt it was
only on sale for two weeks my first
shirt was on sale per month that's so
many emails some people being like two
weeks is not enough time with the half
summer so I contacted represent and
asked them if they could not extend it
but relaunch it so you have seven more
days to buy the team super loves
everybody shirt if you already bought it
in the first batch you don't have to
worry you don't have to wait and tell
this one and state your shirt it's gonna
be two separate total things so you have
one last chance 7 more days to get your
team super shirt before it's gone
forever forever check the link in the
description and hope you seven more days
makes you less mad at me for only have
you and sale for two weeks so yeah
that's that I'm gonna record and I just
I'm poo yeah after you go pouring it
Commissioner office I can you offer you
go poo in your stomach feels like real
good you like a hot I've felt so good
that that's I felt so good
okay so what this word so much it's not
a cold sore it's a pimple
it's horrible um so get this in the
middle of my video I touch the camera
and thought I focused it correctly but I
didn't so while I was editing I noticed
like a minute into my video my whole
rest of my videos autofocus so I'd to
rerecord my entire video
that's so much fun isn't that like so
much fun and I don't like doing that
because usually the first time I do it
is like the best that I do it so the
second time I was like not feeling as
much so hopefully it's still good but I
had to record the video to add recording
video twice essentially yeah Tyla Bammer
but I'm editing and you know that's life
and it's okay because we're still unique
um the time is 3:30 2 a.m. which means
it is my birthday time I'm just gonna
end this vlog I posted my video by the
way so if you don't know I make videos
on my main channel every Monday and
Thursday great feedback I actually
laughed editing and watching as well
which is like really cool um yeah that's
what's up I have to clean my bed a
little bit cuz without fail every time I
make a video like all the props things
in the video on the bed everything's
everywhere it's just like a really bad
habit when I use some I'm very like why
finish the video need to edit those are
like I can't clean as I go I'm very bad
that's like I used this money in the
video and it sits right on the bed my
hat right here on the bed like the
camera bag right here like I'm very bad
at like that I do something that leave
it right that's why I don't clean up
after myself I'm a child I'm gonna go
wash my face and deal with like it looks
like someone knocked me out tomorrow
what's happening is um my mom is going
to call my dentist I gave her the
responsibility just in case I never wake
up um to call and see the fastest
appointment is to get my wisdom teeth
removed I don't know if I mentioned this
vlog but my wisdom teeth are coming in
like at an alarming rate this one is
complete I know they're all growing and
crooked because a dentist previously
told me this this one is coming in now
my cheek is actually slick swelling
slowly I can feel the inside so I have
to get them removed and I figure that
for a week and a half I mean so I needs
to be a time I'm not traveling you're
not shooting and that as you know my
schedule is hectic so from now until
like February 7th with the next two
weeks I have a gap where I don't have to
shoot in LA I don't do anything so it's
like this is the ideal time so I'm like
tell them the fastest appointment get me
in there get my wisdom teeth out but
that'll be very amusing for y'all to see
uh whew that's what's happening I'm
gonna go to bed right now wash my face
and do all that stuff and I hope you had
a great day and I hope you have a
wonderful day tomorrow
