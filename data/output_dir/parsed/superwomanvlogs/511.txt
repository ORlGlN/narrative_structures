I don't know how but it's 1:00 p.m.
I dunno how actually I woke up at nine a
bed at 9:30 and I actually was awakened
by my stomach hurting and it wasn't my
period or anything it was just a
stabbing in my stomach and I just felt
sick ever since it's oh my god I've had
some breakfast and I went back to bed
and I've been lying down for the past
couple of hours I was like sitting there
and like my something is just churning
inside my stomach so I was like I feel
nauseous and so Murr get some ginger ale
and try to sort my life out but not the
most productive morning for sure
especially because I gotta do some book
writing and it's video day and it's 1:00
p.m. and I haven't done it anything so
that's not great but it's okay because I
want to take care of myself and I
actually didn't notice yesterday I
didn't have much of an appetite so maybe
I just set myself up to get sick because
yesterday I didn't eat that much and
even when I was trying to eat it I was
like ah but I'm not hungry like I don't
have an appetite so I don't know maybe
just like time zones jetlag thing I
don't know but we're gonna figure it out
drink lots of water if your cloths of
ginger ale and make it happen
I mopped now I'm gonna try to wash my
face get into it it's still a beautiful
day
I might go sit by the pool for a little
bit change of deciding you know take
care of my spirits and etc and that's
what's going on alright so I'm reading
the three shoppers are yesterday even
though I supposed to write four I wrote
three but I'm not mad at myself okay
being mad at myself is not gonna
positively impact me in any way so we're
gonna make it happen but I'm gonna give
you a little teaser something hainan
night I am gonna give you a little
teaser something I wasn't gonna do but
every once in a while I give you a
little teaser let me find a picture hold
up hold up hold up so may go through
give me a second here
basically the chapter I've one of the
chapters are illustrated I really really
liked I could also just totally show you
on my computer where they're all labeled
into folders appropriately and so do
that but out of all the chapters I wrote
I think it's one of my favorites thus
far is called play Nintendo up let me
find this picture hold on okay so this
is the picture say Nintendo even though
I'm clearly holding a PlayStation okay
we're going for Photoshop I just realize
all right now what
the choppers so much and it's basically
about controlling what's in your control
when you play Nintendo you control your
character you'll control everything else
I don't give too much away I just really
love the last sentence that that was
really witty it says the best way to
stop people from pushing your buttons is
to start pushing your own as in like
your controller to control yourself
right I was very impressed unicorn what
do you think I was very impressed I was
very impressed in myself all right I'm
gonna read these two chapters make sure
they're not garbage and then onwards and
upwards me right now as I'm forgetting
how to make videos I forgot how to make
videos I'm like what can I make a video
about how did I used to do this it's
been 10 days is that to think of a video
idea I'm just like what did I do this I
used to think about an idea and then
write and shoot is that did I do that
because right now I feel like no no
nothing nothing just kidding I thought
of one a kind of an a previously I've
done a video called types of people in
group text but recently I've been added
to like five more group texts like
whatsapp groups and I think have so much
materials that's gonna be called Y group
texts are horrible and all the things we
all think about group text but we never
say or we think like it's like a rude to
say so that's what the bismillah I'm
gonna write it right now and yeah how
you doing love you good good good do
some wd-40 open that yes right
hey it's Evan I'm gonna shoot this video

difficulties are ready to go now I'm
ready to shoot it after so long and I'm
like practicing and practicing cause I
feel like I forgot to do this it always
happens when I don't make videos per
like a extended period of time
but got my setup ready to go wearing a
simple t-shirt you know what's so funny

so hot I'm gonna edit at 7:30 I'm gonna
post it hope it's good I think it's good
it's always difficult to get back in the
groove when you haven't done it for a
while ten days is not that long but for
someone who does it twice a week that's
a real long time so hopefully I've done
hope you like it
