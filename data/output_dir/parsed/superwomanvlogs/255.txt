now we all ready for my show but y'all

yo let's do a boss book show towards
people my smaller show show number corny
to Turkey
mine is manila trans vanilla first time
I perform here I'm so sorry for him
twice it we won't be lit back my homeboy
here for me ready 222
my treat even more so and the cornea so
long they're all hope when you going to
support me I want to meet you my
vlogging camera right I want you to take
it when you come over there hi guys we
are really looking there are many dogs
in it so much pain so much
every morning as you are involved who
are powerful it meant to be important
but more important next if you get
everyone to do it to be kind and
compassionate one another and when you
leave this mean but a mom we're not just
going to survive life you are going to
disclaimer disclaimer this is gonna be a
little bit of a rant disclaimer so I
just finished my selfie initial I want
to start my thing so loud so energetic
the shows a little bit different is
attached to fan fest it was free but you
know I only like to tell you things
because they're on my mind I think we
shall evolve and grow with humans and
we're be honest with you I feel some
parts of TV show or a little tough I
felt super disrespectful and I'm going
to tell you not to complain but to tell
you that for future shows I love these
things didn't happen I'm going explain
why it'll just negatively impact me but
negatively impact you and the entire
audience as well because the show is
free before the show is starting it was
like 50 wristbands that were not
accounted for and I was like well give
it to 50 more fans like why I don't want
50 see to the end that's the first thing
about a show being free is that people
just register it doesn't let people who
actually want to come get a chance so I
like 50 people come and I was both so
dope so I ran out and everyone's really
not excited and this is the one show
that my friends Lauren Allison air and
them they could have come because they
weren't able to come in LA so the one
show that could have came too and I knew
that people gonna be excited they were
there they're in the back but I have
this thing where I'm like everyone put
your phones away especially because I
have a meet-and-greet after because I'm
meeting every single person I'm like to
enjoy the show
I really like the message of the show I
think it's very worthwhile and I don't
want you to see recording the whole time
because like that's not being present
and it's also not great to perform in
front of an audience where everyone's
just I can see me on a3 and every other
I told everyone for the phones where no
one would listen during the show with
the first five minutes people would get
up turn their back towards me and start
taking pictures of Alex and Lauren
chided him selfies of them i blatantly
looked at them was like please put your
phone where I'm trying to perform no one
would listen to me my friend had to
leave which really upset me because of
the one time to watch a show I just get
my friends to get out and like it was a
lot of not listening and here's why
Michela performer obviously that's not
great because I want to communicate my
message but because of that I had to cut
out so many jokes and segments of my
show because people weren't listening
and also timing was going over me be
like please be quiet you guys please pay
attention and on top of that it made the
meet-and-greet
run out of time as well so I couldn't
like hug people probably couldn't get
your name properly it's just everyone
got a worse experience because of that
and I was just really really
disappointed about that because of my
vision and if I show and I want it to be
special for every single person there I
wasn't able to do that today and that
really bums me out I think especially
the Washington I spent a lot of time
talking to Erin and Kyle his buddy Kyle
just really need to see the show here
they really enjoy it both Lauren and
Alex had a meet-and-greet and then they
were going to come right before the mean
greets to come watch the show everybody
was super excited to watch this show
because I kept banging it I'm like yes
it's wonderful I mean even after fousey
saw you would tell them how much you
loved it and they're super excited to
watch it and I think everyone just
forgets that this it's not shows not
just louis about the audiences as well
it's about people interacting and it's
about people giving off wonderful energy
and it's about people showing respect
unfortunately there wasn't respect in
the room today and me watching my really
good friend perform and try her best to
do an amazing show seeing people not
paying attention i saw one girl actually
facetiming her friend in the middle of
the shows as you can show her friend
Alex and me trying my best not to just
get up and tell people to like get out
being disrespected this is the first
time where it on stated I'm actually
like I need to kick people out and I did
it and part of me was like maybe I
should have because and there was some
people I just wanted to enjoy the show
but couldn't because other people were
not cooperating and so I just can't
emphasize this enough I said this once
in Dubai for HT wise well like if
they're going to meet me anyways what's
the need for selfie to record everything
and to not listen like there's so much
more to life than that and I just I just
really didn't have a really pleasant
experience really unfortunate and if you
one two years ago to 82 you I you made a
video about selfies then too we are just
feeling like not feeling like a human
being anymore and we have to change that
relationship and if that means having
less events because these types of
events are not allowing us to have the
type of experience that we want to have
with you guys and that's going to end up
being what's going to end up happening
because you know what it is like
traditionally everyone and also quite
long land its but traditionally everyone
that does a book signing judo signing
and Here I am being like I want to show
under this but today I kind of felt like
I should just I'm signing because I
don't even care about what I'm saying
right now and that hurts and I don't
want that to happen so I'm not livid or
anything but I do feel a little bit hurt
and I wish that the show went a little
bit smoother in that there's a lot of
people were really apologized they're
like I'm so sorry that people weren't
made me feel like I can't do these types
of shows I should just do music then the
next time I come here which is we're
going to a fan fest using on stage alone
he's nothing like we're going to totally
once they do a thousand percent here's
another reason why I made me sad is in
this evening show we're supposed to
bring people on stage that made signs
and could be a part of the show I
tweeted about and everything be my make
your signs you can come on stage with us
and I had to cancel that because the
staff is like you're no one going to
listen and so that's just 20 people that
lost opportunity come on stage as well
so it's just really unfortunate that
everyone's got it and we don't want
other excited thinking okay we can come
to Manila yeah it allows disrespectful
fun you guys are so excited and so
wonderfully we saw I'm not saying on
cheer cheer have fun what I'm trying to
like ha I'm asking for something would
be great if there was a little bit of
respect it's all especially with these
smaller more intimate shows so you guys
can have a wonderfully and then my last
thing I want to say is that if I also
felt like oh this is why I can't do free
shows because like when people don't pay
for a ticket let's do whatever f we want
to do it that makes me sad but like if
there's no more free show this is
honestly kind of like the fact that they
were in the room they just like always
the free thing I'm going to be here and
then to be honest after Alex and Lauren
let a lot of people ran out to try to
chase them go for more selfies I think
that's because I let so many people in
that didn't have respond maybe that was
my mistake but be honest even after they
left people are still not listening to
me so it wasn't even because of them but
that my experience that I want to share
with you and still gonna go on stage
then do a 110% we're gonna kill it the
fans are so wonderful and beautiful but
just something to keep in mind for
future shows even so what does the
Manila you are abusing your soul your
people people and any shown with you
right now let me just show you this
right now I mean are you kidding me
oh my god amazing
no friends or friends that I sell when
they see me on this you see they don't
have a clue
Nessie and I don't understand your
hostages you what I've ever wanted to go
