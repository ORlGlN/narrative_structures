everyone I meet them with listen I'm
very hard worker
I'm very patient I'm very kind there's
one thing I would be a DML boat and that
is being cold because I hate it and I
don't want to be cold I'm not gonna lie

everything I spiritually believe in
everything where my sweatpants at and
these heels hard yeah it is so cold
outside oh my babies are outside all of
team zippers outside and they're so cold
and I just want to go threaten hug them
and like to go sweatpants and everything

hopefully that makes them warm but thank
you so much for having us outside
waiting it's so cold I always do bad
situations like this and I feel like
uneasy and like uh my babies so we're
about to go but they're all outside
neighboring unicorn wants to give them
unicorn onesies and its GUI mugs or even
hot chocolate and a cat would want to
eat them and as soon as this person is

hugs on and putting his winter coat back
