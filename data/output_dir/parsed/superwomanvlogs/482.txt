what's good marshmallows
good afternoon the time is three look up
look at my cm I left all this food right
last night the time is three I went to
battle eight thirty nine is this insane
right you last night the weirdest crap
I'm in my bed tell me why my neighbours
on that side wake up at eight and start
having a rave yeah I know you're gonna
be like oh maybe they just stayed up all
night no I heard them wake up I heard
them start their music and there's like
50 people at their house straight from 8
a.m. in the morning what how did you
convince this many people to come to
your party and someone tweeted me being
like it's a day rape it's a thing just
an ATM who've been partying I just sleep
in the guest room because they're so
loud but I'm not the type of neighbor
that complains I have a very strict rule
about this I don't complain because it's
mutually beneficial when I have a party
here they're gonna understand and that's
that's what that's what being you know
good neighbors is all about you deal
with stupid crap like that but last
night I was just not having I was like
y'all are so damn loud so early I just
don't understand well yesterday I
finished writing my book today believe
it or not everyone's like you need to
have a breather you have a breather and
I'm like nah right now I have so much
stuff to do I have to do my speech for
v-day Minnesota I'm leaving tomorrow to
Minnesota I have to talk about some
evils
I mean apply some emails regarding book
layout I have 50 emails I didn't check
from Friday and I need to make my video
for tomorrow because tomorrow I'll be on
a plane so there's many things that
still need to happen first though I'm
going to the house to spend some time
there to feel it out and take some
pictures nish so that's popping I don't
know if wanna vlog there or not I don't
know I'm not making any decisions I'll
just play by ear let go okay I don't
want to show you too much but I want to
show you the one thing where I was like
yes I can move here are you ready
popcorn button we're good sign me up
pack my bags let go okay standing here
walk to the house of bazillion times
name in the house it's not a condo we
there's like a single development it's
hard to explain what I've walked through
have made some notes of things I like
and don't like and I'm like okay Lilly
do you like this place
I think I do I think I mean then use be
a few tweaks here and there not because
things are wrong would think I'm just
very particular about like workflow but
like you know like adding pot lights and
like the office needs more light for
sure
and it's not that things are wrong I'm
just used to certain things my apartment
but that's just because it was my first
place so I I'm looking around I'm just
like I think I like it I think I like it
it doesn't have things my apartment has
but has more things as other different
things that my apartment doesn't have
you know so it's like just different
it's way bigger I was gonna tell you
with the rooftop allows for a hot tub so
I'm gonna order a hot tub it's a private
hot tub I'm like hi every time my neck
hurts and have a migraine hi my own
private hot tub hi that was a big seller
for me and more than anything like if my
parents want to come for my nephews
wanna call my sister they'd be able to
stay here and I'm just really happy uh
so I think I'm gonna do it I have until
Friday tobacco but I don't think I'm
going to and it's really exciting I'm
gonna physical it completely right now
it looks completely furnished cuz they
were selling it but like it's not going
to be furnished and signal choirs so a
lot of the furniture in my apartment
right now is rented there's a few things
that aren't but a lot of it is like my
bed and the sofa and the dining table is
all rented it's gonna take a lot to
furnish this place I have two months you
know that I have both places
let me expensive and take a lot to
furnish it because you know me other
type of personal I'm like I can't go
months and months not having like a sofa
but like I need to have ish right
remember my apartment within like two
weeks at artwork up image that's the
type of person I am and no one's gonna
be here to help me in terms of like
humble is going to come at the end of
October which I guess is fine but this
is a really big decision that I'm making
by myself
you know none of my friends and family
had been physically in this house to see
it and tell me what they think I've
tried to FaceTime them but this is my
decision and I know I'm rambling but
that's because like this is I think do
you super I think we're moving
I think we're gonna do it I think I'm
doing it I think I think this is not
this is this is happening that nothing
is going to change it's it's not a move
it's a graduation if anything team super
the new lily pad is gonna be dope um I
don't want to show it to you though
because it's this isn't it that's all
you see there's three floors but that's
all that's all you see that's all you
see
just please be nice in the comments I'm
so nervous about this decision and I'm
we're doing it we're gonna move I have
inspections on Wednesday but I mean I I
think we're gonna move we're gonna move
all right I'm back in the lilypad

environment I'm gonna order some food

Sunday - Blood Mountain play some music

still very cautious like turn and my
masseuse said it's because of my neck
he's like there's your neck is so tense
I'm guessing that just like I've been
holding a lot of tension in my neck with
the book writing and it's he's just like
there's all knots so when he was telling

writing a book yesterday I need to watch
an episode of The Walking Dead all right

mmm I'm not in the six I can't be
running through the city my wolves you
know I'm saying I can be doing that not
being my best productive self I'm mad at
myself and that stops now
I think I've burned all my eyelashes off
because I got too close to my positivity
candle and the outcome wasn't positive I
just was writing my speech for Minnesota
it's 3 a.m. and my sis Lindsey Stirling
hit me up to record something for a real
quick of course you know I didn't say no
so I'm going to do that some quotes she
needs for a performance um and then I'm

tomorrow's video day
come on the flight can I just can
someone just provide me a clone can I
just get something by me even with my
birthday I wanna I want you by the girl
of Rafiki and I also want to clone and
so we're gonna clone also I'm not I'm
gonna write a lot it's so weird like my
brain plays tricks on me
I told Stu someone once and they're like
oh that's like a really minor form of
dyslexia I'll write words but I'm
writing them with a pencil say if I'm
writing the word like Apple I'll write
the P first so I'll go peepee Ellie and
then
the a I'll get G and J confused I don't
know that if it's changing J at all
same with six and seven it's weird like
I just get them confused in my brain and
also now when I'm writing like I'll be
writing something I'll writer and then
I'll be the sentence and I'm like where
did all these words come from I didn't
write these words but apparently did so
like a fiber right doll instead alright
like it it's like weird maybe I'm just
tired I don't think so because it
usually happens if I write a lot but
like anything pollution when you lie to
me show me I'm stop it you stop it oh
wait that's me yeah so in Singapore when
you lovelyz gave me this sick gift I'm
actually wanted one for so long why I
never got around to it it's a stamp and
that's what the stamp is so I'm going to
try it with a little bit of ink stand by

I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and pack this
is the situation ok I wanted to talk to
you real quick about this um I don't
think well you know that on the 20th I'm
releasing the Kenya vlog I have decided
for several reasons one is you know how
passionate I am about girl love and this
Rafiki I'm going to release that Kenya
vlog as my Monday video on my main
channel I only have tomorrow to edit it
wait to sucky because today I'm gonna
admit I wasn't that efficient and
productive I wasn't as productive as I
could have been I think my brain was
just tired from the all-nighters I've
been pulling but I want to spend all day
tomorrow on the flight whatever
I initially was gonna try to like a
super Monday video then the next day I'm
amazed how another video and it was like
I don't think it's gonna be possible I
feel guilty about that because I know
people go to my main channel for comedy
but I do feel strongly about this and I
hope you can be supportive of the fact
that the Kenya vlog will be a main
Channel video on Monday um yeah tomorrow
we are heading to Minnesota for we date
and so I have a whole day to work on
that blog and I want to make it really
really really good and so I'm willing to
lose sleep over that but not over like
making two videos because I don't think
either of them will be good if I try to
do that so I hope that's okay with you I
apologize I was looking at my calendar
because I was just like yo things right
now are to non-stop for me
they're there to non-stop like I am a
little bit stressed on huckle I look at
my calendar literally the only days
after relax are on my actual birthday
