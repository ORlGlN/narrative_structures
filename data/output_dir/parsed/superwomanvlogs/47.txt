stalking show you some extra love but
can I just tell you real real talk this
years 12 globs of Christmas have been so
exciting but difficult because the
caliber of town has gotten so elevate
from last year and I had to learn about
dealing with teams doing with approvals
and just flying places and people floppy
there's so much stuff it was so
difficult I got to give some shoutouts
right off the bat number one shout out
has got to go to my team strike that but
it might see us putting so much work
they have lost sleep they probably lost
use of their life they probably have
gray hair they weren't so hard on these
claps shot us through my team I feel so
lucky to have you when I see other
people just like I don't know how anyone
functions about the people I have so I
feel so lucky for my team that
absolutely killed it a lot of the
success is due to them sick people
remember bury you y'all have been so
supportive with me trying new idea me
trying to surprise you with things a
feedback please collabs has been so
unique because not just like cool video
first I'm glad she has nice hair it's
like really meaningful feedback like I
appreciate this part of the script I
appreciate this part of the acting and
that stuff has meant so much to me
because I have really challenged myself
with all the scripts and all the
concepts in the way I've constructed the
jokes and all the clubs so I'm really
really proud of all of them and thank
you for your support
God you should be number one my bag for
a real one thank you for all these
opportunities during so many of these
collabs
I would sit there across this person

I'm so honored number twelve

even believe I have the honor of working
with you in this like Dwayne and Nick
George are just like so and
I'm so grateful thank you so much for
all supposed to class with the merch
really think I'll come if you want if
you don't no big deal ain't a big deal
anything I personally love oh oh a next
thing you know my year-end video I
include teamsuperman if you want to be
my year in video stay tuned to my
facebook cuz I am gonna post about that
in a couple days being like if you want
to be in my video who these things fiop
fan y'all i'm seeing a lot of tweets
about the rings being sold on I think
the rings are sold out but I just
checked the back and it might be a
glitch I'm not sure so take this with a
grain of salt but I think there's some
odd sizes left or like bigger or smaller
ring size because the different ring
sizes if you really want the ring I mean
if you don't nesting dolls but if you
really want it you gonna bring on a
necklace I seen a lot of people do that
so if you really want it but they're
down the size that's one solution
possibly or you can just forget what I'm
saying that's cool too if I want to
address because I see so many tweets be
like the ring is all the other threes I
thought it might be but there might be
some odd sizes to choking on my spit
