my pants are maroon good afternoon I
will go up at 9:45 to kind of meeting
for an hour and a half in 11:30 so that
does that math make sense I promise
whatever that matters make sense had a
meeting went great
I'm so tired to get that much sleep last
night I have another meeting in about 30
minutes I'm going to lie down for 20
minutes before that great thing what has
meetings in my own place it's like yeah
yeah we did meeting in like a minute and
I just walked downstairs and you know
what some time ago back into bed right
now this is what we're going to do today
post-production figures after my meeting
have an hour-and-a-half break which I
need to pack for my audition I have an
audition today which I'm nervous about
kind of not as one scene and also I've
had this mentality which is nothing will
be the make-or-break of me every
audition I go to my blog I learned
something new it's fine I'm not gonna
put the pressure on myself in my career
got it no I'm gonna find my way we'll
find my place try my best
after the audition I'm gonna find my
license plates put on my Chancellor
because well come on dumb everyone no
big deal and then I got signed up for
juicing so very productive day first we
neck by the way and next thing yes my
stuff is everywhere why wear shoes in
the house because you don't mad like yo
don't wear shoes in my house it's
because I still not completely unpacked
and still not completely settled it's my
floor is dirty if your shoes like your
socks will get a little bit mush up why
in a focus on your bridge in there you
go and that's why I'm allowed to wear
shoes and why I still wear shoes because
your feet would be broke off if you did
not like that that was a lot long enough
let's go to our meeting downstairs you
don't my favorite thing on the planet is
when people have got their jobs I love
what people are good at the jobs we meet
with people and it's like hella good at
your job makes me wanna be better at my
job I love that it but eat something and
maybe take a pop and then start prepping
for my addition to meetings down there
do they allow super tired today I was
time to take another nap right now but
as like no we're not gonna do it it's
gonna power through power suit hopefully
the next clip I'm not sleeping stay
tuned
okay listeners hello I'm going to clean
the story well audition says the person
looks athletic I'm like oh okay those
who wear everything like you have people
to thing I'll work out BAM she'd I'm
gone you calling me Mom hello was I bad
that fun fact one of my best pump up
songs with Jay Sean down
and forgetting love it is about 30
minutes my audition is in Marina del Rey
which is where I used to say my Airbnb
before I moved to LA so we can go a walk
down memory lane people say I talk fast
my vlogs I'm sorry all of my friends
talk pass in front oh but we are so two
minutes away from my audition leave an
hour early
but LA traffic is like nah so my GPS
just went off because my additional f
versus D and it's like leave by 3:30
5:00 as traffic is heavy
I left at 307 and I'm still going to be
late because the traffic is so heavy
things like this look stressful Z on
most of our auditions provided this
audition is very far from RM but it's
like if somebody is la chopping a sign
some days it's so heavy an adult I
haven't figured out like what's the
science and see it there on time for
going late to audition stressful feel so
much like you like an order at a
disadvantage even though like I feel
like most fascinating like there's have
a list of people they don't know Jerry
people are coming in but just me
mentally it friggin asked me of so much
so I'm not in a copy place right now but
try to stay positive
as a positive resembling right after I
did that last clip somehow I made a turn
and my GPS reduced itself by ten minutes
and I made here on time the power of
positivity smug to go in nothing is the
make a break of me to be more
wonderfully okay horribly either way
still going to be happy about it I go
okay done not so much to tell your
person without really fast
deal with it okay I antenna fast if you
listen so I love how first of all when
something happens usually can really
call their boyfriend or call their
friend is it sad that like I turn on my
vlogging camera I can't wait to tell
Dean Cooper
that makes me Wayne I don't think I
think that makes me awesome but just
engage okay so I'm welcome to the place
by the audition ISM like I recognize
this place in a chapter of my book right
when I moved to LA or maybe slightly
before I moved to LA like it was my
second ever audition and I did this
audition and in my book I write about
the audition and I write about how nice
the casting agent was and how like I was
so proud of myself for overcoming that
audition same place same person so I
walked in and I was like oh my god walk
down memory lane I walked in the first
hand side term like before we start kids
ask you did you do this audition you're
go for blank movie she's like yeah I
remember you look like I wrote about you
in my book and then we had this whole
moment I I'm proud of myself I did that
dish I didn't mess up at all I didn't
mess with any of the lines and that's a
big crash to me to show you that like
people's energy I mean sometimes when I
fumble auditions because of the energy
in the room is very like already not
welcoming she's so nice and welcoming
that you do your best but I also mother
speaks very fast like me and I remember
that's all I go I definitely remember
her but it was so I did I'm proud of
myself because I did and it was even
more cool because it was the same place
I did that audition that I was freaked
out about a year ago and it's just like
you look come a long way now I live here
and I have a good a bunch but just a
super super cool I'm proud but I get it
or not or even not even getting what I
get a callback or not doesn't matter she
had great energy and I like being around
that energy and that just goes to show
if you want to I don't get upon addition
some people are good at acting not a
laughing made specifically some people
might be good at acne which is not good
at auditions because you go into an
audition room and it's the most
uncomfortable environment to make you do
well so when you have people are nice
and we give you a welcome Jill do your
people will do better don't you want
people to do their best like never
injustice books I have them neck
I'm excited hyper because I'm proud of
myself that's the moral the story if I
spoke too fast rewind played again half
speed if you can go down YouTube now is
yours now when you have my license
plates on my car I should probably do
that
Lego also there will be so much traffic
but it's okay because positivity will
prevail
god damn face is a walk down memory lane
because now I'm at the place where I
bought my Tesla let's go how ago
reliving all these memories right here
could give up 15 minutes they put the
plate in by drilling two holes into the
car we can't actually put the plates on
yourself memory lane I shed a single
tear no gun down what they got here I
got free water but I got exactly what's
up sheep for life fun fact when I picked
up my Tesla when I bought it a while ago
I don't realize that the buttons to my
shirt were undone and so when I'm
talking to the guy my whole shirt was
very much under and he could see my
brought the whole time obviously you say
nothing but you're saying you got low
after something besides the price of
caring option with a net stupid moment
when I tried to be responsible get my
place and I don't have the stickers
otherwise the stickers the stickers for
the plate goddammit and come back so
good I'm getting better and better at
eating leftovers kills a good I'm so
hired my hands broken in the levitation
