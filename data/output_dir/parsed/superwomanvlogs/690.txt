numbers and things of what I'm gonna
donate I've decided I'm gonna I'm not
gonna that that number I'm gonna round

total of $4,000 that we collectively
raised to donate including all the
donations I'm doing on behalf of all the
girls so ah a little exciting and I'm
gonna post about it right now but thank
you so much for sharing it and even
though the donations are done in the 30
days are done doesn't mean we have to
stop spreading girl up the message is
still there and the mission is still
there and everything is still going on

but it it's a good day it's all good and

a solid nose so good some bounds and get
up by eating some chocolate balanced
diet you know I'm going to a meeting by
line oh okay look how professional I am
going to meetings
my nail polish is always a mess and
which is so weird because the two things
are really girly about my nail polish
and my eyebrows yeah my nails continuous
we are a disaster a disaster but it's
again because I keep saying that I keep
saying that just because I wanted to
remind myself like not to take a nap and
stuff but we're gonna get it done it's
gonna be amazing
I just sent an email to my mom dad and
everyone else that staying on my house
like a very professional email and now
there's like this awkward email thread
going back and forth with my mom was
like busting bad jokes my mom's
hilarious by the way ever no my family's
very funny if you watched my sister's
vlogs she's very funny my mom is like
hilarious and I can't wait for those
logs you don't know when but soon when
they're all at my house give me like 9
or 10 people staying at my house that's
made for two people - this man
what up t-shirt reference I walked all
the way here just to say it saying we
have to go I'm all the way over there
but after I know my priorities what's up
what's up what's up this guy is on fire
no fire no fire a movie a movie a movie
a movie pop yeah don't sir
which just art art art yo so when I went
to Toronto that one time when I
surprised my family there was a girl I
met her name was Brody I'm so sorry for
me or Maria I'm pretty sure it was and
she has a artist handle called hate copy
so she does these dope pieces and if you
want to follow her it's hate copy and
she sent me some and look at this like
trust no one fee and then there's like
this dope thing Mickey and they're
really really cool so I'm gonna put them
in my washroom and switch all my stuff
there and as much as I like the bullet
I'm there I think it doesn't match this
theme now so that situation is all but
I'm gonna frame something right now and
we're gonna make this happen
ah finish that meeting and now I have a
shoot in an hour and I have to figure
out what that shoot is gonna entail in
this hour right now that's happening and
the urge to take a nap is too real
thought we're not gonna do that we're
not gonna we're not gonna do that
7 second hour go

just finished shooting my video from
Marshall Monday and I feel like I've
been binge eat so many times this week

just feel like I'm legitimately Manjeet
or maybe Antonio or maybe Manjeet or
maybe I'm Tonio or maybe man Jeep but
maybe Antonio maybe Wendy I'm sorry for
shooting that at the time is 9:03 p.m.
and we got lots of time to do more work
so that's what sighs I hope I just get
those I'm sorry I'm very hyper excited
so many emails I was like I feel like
I'm in quicksand and emails are just
like going into myself and it's just
consuming my entire body up so Mimas and
I keep saying okay I'll started this
come back to it stir this combustion box
look like a mother I think galaxies
right now got stars everywhere freaking
out yo this is guy it is 10:30 I
strongly edit this Marshall video too

honestly even do that on the plane to be
honest that's like I don't know my
flight yeah what am I even going am I
going tomorrow man Freddy who knows what
is even happening my life I just you
know I wanted to shoot a music video in
Trinidad and I don't think that's gonna
happen and it is very rare for me to
give up on things but this is just a
situation where I don't I can't write a
whole song I wouldn't be really good I
can't write a whole song I'm like shoot
a music video what I really wanted to
but I'm trying to think of something to
do I might do a skit there I want to do
something really cool some kind of bump
I don't have more time to plan it out
because I I'm used to having a million
things to do but I think recently I've
been spread out very very thin with the
movie coming up the travels to New York
the travels to trade that a portrayed
I'm going to New York one day after and
I have a whole bunch of other things I'm
working on that y'all don't know but I'm
just being spread out really thin where
everyday I was like okay put my brain in
it and I'm not complaining I love it and
I feel so blessed for the opportunities
but it's kind of like I'm struggling to
do all the things that I've like want to
do I want to do too much and I don't
have enough time to do it that sort of
is and I just I get really excited about
things and I don't want to let it go so
I guess I need to work on that but um I
don't try think of something to ensure
and add but as of right now I don't
think my music video is gonna have
we'll see we'll see where's my nose ring

I think what it is is putting on them in
jeath beard so often taking it off has
