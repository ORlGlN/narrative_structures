very a very small cameo but still with
this is experience and it's good and

headed over all right let me tell you
story properly now in case I did because
I don't remember what I acted told you

on set I was so intimidated my scene is
actually very small scene it's only like
two or three lines it's with Christina
Applegate she was so nice to me too so
warm and so welcoming and then I was in
the trailer and Mila Kunis walks in and
I was like hi my name is Lilly and she's
like yeah Ethan was my husband yesterday
and then she like I whole conversation
with me she was telling me how she's not
too familiar with the internet space but
I'm so excited I'm sorry exact words
were you know I'm not too familiar with
like the internet space in my system is
like in love with you he loves your
stuff so I watched a bunch of your
videos last night and you're hilarious
and I was like don't kill me Mila Kunis
and similarities and then she was just
so cool and chilling down to earth and
like hot and just like so much girl love
happening on that set like as Mila Kunis
walking she's like Valentine's you only
go to other girls on set Christina
Applegate knew the other girls on set
were sick she was sending them gift
baskets oh so much girl of they were so
sweet so nice so when that movie comes
out I have a good two lion cameo in it
which I'm very excited about
I don't small what it's kind of cool
let's begin my nose um also so that
happened I'm gonna post a picture on
Instagram right now I'm very excited
about it now you know why I was excited
while I was in where I was look what I
came home to look what I came up to yes
I told you I wasn't lying I have the
vlogging cameras the newer ones I will
start blogging with that we will go back
to the fish shot some of you might like
that something you might not but that's
what's happening I'm very excited about
it all I can't wait to clean my place
because it's kind of a destroyed and
also I have to poop and also I at some
point need to sleep but we'll figure out
which order we're gonna do those things
in another package in the mail is
actually sent to Kingsley's house
because I ordered it so long ago but I
know exactly what it is
are you ready for this I ready for this
lalalalala super uber blood 1 million
subs play button yo dear superwoman
blogs you're bigger than Meg Cooper
you're bigger than Venice super blog
even bigger than Las Vegas 1 million
subs stop hey now I can finally have one
here because the one for the main
channel is in Toronto and I can have one
here yeah used to be a 1 hour nap it was
supposed to be a 1 hour nap but it was a
3 hour nap at 6:15 not the end of the
world but it's 6:15 alright I just first
of all looked crazy but I just finished
cleaning the place as best as I could
vacuumed all that stuff's weeped printed
out a bunch of scripts I have two
auditions tomorrow and so has a lot of
memorization I got to do tomorrow is
also videotape my stomach is like upset
I don't know if it's all the travel all
the crap I've been eating I have no idea
do I have some soup or something right
now it is quite early it's only like
7:30 8 but I'm trying to go to bed it
like 10 because I have to wake up early
morning foreign Edition also I just
posted the Mila Kunis picture and
everyone's like so happy it's a really
small cameo so it's not like a huge huge
deal but like it's still really exciting
and I'm really excited obviously and I
won more mini surprise coming soon but
you'll have to wait for that one yeah
that's what's going on right now you got
a hole at me oh love me love me yeah
another critical thinking moment so it
is all over Twitter now I'm not all over
Twitter there's a few tweets about it
from like eonline etc etc that Taylor
Swift is donating $250,000 to Kesha in
support of a court case just as like a
sign of support and I remember when the
whole cash situation grew up on Twitter
so many people sort of Taylor Swift
where you at now supposed to be a
feminist where you at now and I tweeted
being like not that my tweets matter but
I tweeted being like in moments like
this the answer is not to blame other
women about what they're doing and not
doing it's to come together like turning
against each other doesn't solve
anything and if you look at Taylor's
Twitter she doesn't treat anything so
yeah okay there's probably like some
strategy and marketing of course I got
oh anyways through the media that you
donated but the point I'm making is you
can't judge people's actions based on
what they tweet and don't tweet many
people might do
great things and just not tweet about it
and if you think about it sometimes
actions in the real world can do much
more than a tweet so I just encourage
you all to think critically when it
comes to that stuff that just something
someone tweet something it doesn't mean
they actually believe it just because
someone doesn't tweet something it
doesn't mean they're not doing something
to help the cause offline so that's my
moment of critical thinking um you're
not only what you tweet you are what you
do not what you tweet so uh just took
shower felt great my stomach is like a
little bit woozy I think I just need to
like go on a little bit cleanse and like
drink a lot of water and eat a lot of
greenery and ish like that because right
not everything upset with me um I'm
going to head to bed like 9:00 but I'm
going to memorize some lines check some
emails edit this vlog go to sleep get an
early night wake up refreshed that's the
plan get back on track for the two days
I'm here tomorrow's Monday I'm leaving
Tuesday and what I said an email to my
team being like hey from now until my
next travel thing which I cannot tell
you about yet I don't want to travel and
I'm so used to traveling and I'm so
about it but I just need a little bit of
time to be in one place so I can buy
groceries cook food like I since I moved
to LA I'm only been able to buy
groceries once start twice once when I
first moved here second time when people
came over because I'm never here long
enough to eat the groceries I would like
