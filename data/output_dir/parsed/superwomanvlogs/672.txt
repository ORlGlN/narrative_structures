the return of the fisheye lens I know
some of you hate this some of you like
this some of you missed systems were
like no let me explain why this is so
much easier to vlog with it's just
easier to fall with fisheye lens because
you can see more also that means I could
use my phone while vlogging my phone is
been like lagging and slowing down
because I keep putting so much video I
guess I don't I can delete it but then
where's color but what if I do look
important it's just way easier to vlog
on this as post my phone so if you hate
it I'm sorry I hope you can deal with it
because it doesn't make my vlogging life
way way easier I am headed to a meeting
I am so so tired but that's nothing you
I'm head to a meeting wearing a GUI
sweater I don't know who sent this to me
to shut about my house Jimmie's to me I
think he maced me um but as we're doing
so let's let's go do that ok I like
forgot what it feels like to carry on
this vlogging camera this version I got
is actually the newer ones a bit bigger
and bulkier so it's not as small like
doesn't spend my pocket as easily and
I'm just like what is this thing I'm
holding by like I like we're getting
back to it I don't know who I think I
have more sweaters it's irrelevant Iran
oh so because it's LA and it's freaking
hot is that for now I'm sweating buckets
this chapstick is delicious
this was top secret yeah pretty sure you
were okay I had a little bit of a
stressful morning not gonna lie I went
to a meeting very very cool stuff was at
the YouTube I didn't vlog because it was
just so hectic and rushed and then I had
a meeting right afterward that I didn't
realize I had because I have an audition
so close to it so I had to cancel that
one be like I can't I can't I really
hope this mic is not peaking cuz I'm not
- if this quality is not great because I
haven't figure out this camera yet but I
think it should be fine um I'm frazzled
is the long story short but this was
gonna happen
this was gonna happen it's it's tough to
get the sentence to work every single
day but what's gonna happen is I'm gonna
take a deep breath okay I take a deep
breath if you do fine you are every day
like this I'm sorry I wasn't suppose to
have a frazzle date today there's a
meeting came out of nowhere and then I
had to reschedule last minute and just
either way so you finally want a deep
breath we're gonna get ready we're going
to practice our Edition when I head
toward ish and finish the audition now

flop like all right can we do this one
first you can do this in second and they
were just so cool and it was a lot of
fun to wear by the beach or driving by
the beach I'm like this is the closest
I've been to going to the beach since
I've moved here driving by it between
auditions um but I'm really happy about
that and I feel very like yo I went in
there and I was ignore shoulder cuts
like try your best make it happen and I
feel super good about it as first time
I've ever done so many roles in one
auditions
go team stepping on a comfort zone arm
flab learning a little all good things
can I just say something I'm astonished
by it is how quickly a place gets dusty
I feel like I just my place every day
and I never to worry about this when I
live with my parents
I'm a moment do it but now I'm just like
are you dusty again is this thing I just
dusted us again maintaining a place
after vacuum I reopened a sweet memory
every day my mom saw you watching this
laughing it's just it's a whole thing
this is so la of me but I'm drinking
something it's a green - doesn't taste
that bad you stuff like this is so not
me but I think is like banana mango
spitters - spinach prime I could do with
that but I was pretty good I mean would
I prefer slushie yes
would I preferred ice-cold coke maybe I
can live with it yo getting some work
done which means I'm sitting on my desk
with my bra and hooked I don't look um
so I am on YouTube just kind of watching
different series I have a little bit of
a break so I'm doing emails and watching
series and I'm trying to okay look look
here oh we're back to the whole
confusion of do I look here dwell here
I'm trying to look at some series of
like different people acting in
different things not only comedy but
like serious things because I feel like
I do call me a lot but I'd like to see
how people act in serious situations
I've been paying attention to a lot of
like how people act in different roles
and so that's what I'm currently doing
um stay tuned okay so I just discovered
this show which is so different from
what I do because I do find me silly
goofy Oh fun positive things we did when
you play Nia it's called V Morgan is
dead i swatched Episode one is calm its
I only watch first episode but it's
basically about this girl but she's dead
and now she's in her afterlife and
anyways it's called welcome to the sixth
floor um
and it's so different for what I do and
I just like taking notes and I'm like
this is really weird when I watch things
that I can barely concentrate anything
else I'm just like how would I act that
or like if I had to play a role where I
was dead how would I do that and there's
I don't know how would I roll but I'm
dead like oh it's pretty dope actually I
don't the link to in the description you
want to check it out I'm gonna see what
else I can find

voiceover in the beginning and voiceover
something I'm not that great at so like
the intense voiceover in the beginning
hold on you will die like I don't know
if I could say that like you will die I
don't know I'm a racist practice never I
should read it everything she says dope
