I woke up through some type of way
good afternoon the time is 1:30 ish I'm
headed to shoot a collab with Lele and
whole bunch people just oaks I've never
collaborated with her actually never
children for more than like 60 seconds
so I'm excited about that also like
intimidated because she's so funny but
I'm gonna go do that later on I have a
meeting and then I need to like I woke
up feeling I don't know why I welcomed
feeling not happy and I was like what is
bothering me and it's like a series of
things one is like I will too so many
annoying texts - it's like my room is a
disaster like tripping over everything I
got a pack tonight for Toronto tomorrow
morning and three was just like I
couldn't figure it out look at this is
not an ideal situation to wake up to but
I just woke up feeling uninspired and
just like not the best so I'm trying to
figure out what it is and I keep saying
things out loud and I can't figure out
so I'm trying to change my mind talent
and be like you know what however you
feel is fine you're gonna go be
productive on the shoot you're gonna be
nice on this shoot you're gonna be funny
on this shoot make that the present
moment priority and try to be in tune
with yourself because I feel like not
that in tune with myself right now but
it's okay because we have many things to
be grateful for I live in LA and I was
beautiful apartment they would shoot a
collab and that's my job I've many
things were grateful for so that's we're
gonna go do a shoot this club dad oh
