okay time for salad I honestly never
thought Salle's would be pretty but like
these salads are mad pretty for little
bees Villa tofu you know I'm talking
about like making protein filled all
good
I also did a responsible thing I know
when I go to use this ounce later you're
probably know order pizza or do
something like that so I got another one
with a dressing on the side to take to a
sauce that yo yesterday I had my cheat
day
I'm not having three days our cheat day
and that's the hardest part when you're
in those social situations and like it's
okay I take a bite of please that's cool
but like when you're in those situations
pizza popcorn Oh pop all this stuff let
me have everything so this would be my
attempt to have moderation yeah when did
it get so dark so it stays cloudy
tomorrow's cloudy Monday's cloudy almost
coming on Monday I'm like what are you
bringing with you bringing the cloudy
weather so I just started a new thing I
had this idea and I was like ah this is
kind of cool I kind of like it so
similar to how it's you're familiar with
jay-z he wants Upon a Time released a
book I feel like it was called blueprint
I might be incorrect but it was
basically like the inspiration behind
his songs in the what certain lines me
and also I thought that was really cool
not just thinking about that day and I
was like I want to make a post about my
latest video and I thought it would be
really cool for me to every once in a
while make a post kind of about why I
decided to make the video I made and
what the inspiration behind the video
was and what the deeper message was if
there is a deeper message so my last
video is how to apologize a guide for
people who suck at it and so I just made
a post on facebook that was like you
don't my videos funny but here's why I
made this video here's why I think
apologizing was important and it's like
you know a deeper less comedic more
inspirational type of post and I just on
Facebook let me know if you like that I
think it's kind of cool it gives people
a different perspective into what I do
and because I do try and put a message
into my videos and sometimes it can fly
over people's heads and you might just
think it's just comedy which I like to
make people that but I also usually do
have a reason why I make my videos and
what inspired them so I'm trying to
think of a name or hashtag for that
segment like behind the scenes something
I'm spreading something creative so if
you think of something please comment
below and
let me know what you think about that if
you think that's cool or not baby won't
you come my way got something I want to
say
we'll play what would sound like if you
could actually understand what you sing
actually love me some Fetty WAP this
divides with guarna I have to change my
outfit this many times I don't know why
I'm just not feeling comfortable or
anything I'm gonna record some quick
stuff that I need to do just for like
socials and stuff not a video or
anything and then well where are these
noise coming from and then I'm going to
head over to Yusuf's to watch boxing
wrestling what is it some sort of fight
Holmes vs. tape I'm like oh when's our
rock coming up

this is why he's winning I've been
seeing her face every day and let me
just tell you real quick so I did some
really frisky things in the video and
the reason I didn't ask
Susie I even texted this I said I am
very anti slut-shaming have a feminist
role I know if a guy was to do things
that I did the video nor was anything
let's just hope I did them
I'm very anti slut-shaming I stand by
everything guys I put a lot of things in
this script she only asked for one not
even change an altercation which I did
not think she'd be down for this is why
she is my favorite she responded back
saying I want to keep your creative
vision this woman right here is so down
for the cause you don't even know why I
don't like to stifle people's creativity
I just want to say something and don't
edit this out Lily
