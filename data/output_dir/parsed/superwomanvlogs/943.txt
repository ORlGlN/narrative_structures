so I'm wrapping this road right now
because my mom is cooking Indian food
and I'm trying to leave the house and
I'm trying to smell like no curry
what up has ever happened to so I took a
shower I got ready
I got another washroom and like my mom's
cooking something was up and I was like
it smells delicious to me but I ain't
trying to leave the house smelling like
no sub G I don't what's English word for
sub G good it's not curry it's like
Indian food basically I am going to go
see my friend some man ah which I don't
think you've ever met in my lungs
actually it's Mathis one of those
friends that we don't talk everyday we
rarely see like I don't even remember
the last time I saw its public a year
ago but we're still just as closed so we
don't want those friends that you still
know them they got your back you got
their back should ever need you you'll
come running but like you don't see each
other talk that often she's one of those
friends I'm very very excited to see her
but first breakfast
but a red line having a party
yeah she's my baby she is the weirdest F
in life socially with her is amazing all
the time she meets the weirdest people
if you're one of the people hasn't that
time watching this you're weird this is
how you find out so it's good fighting
when the clap things to me clothes
bumping right here the party no one's
even serving everyone is seeing us
there's no seat to be had so I thought
boy you know you should put some effort
don't do anything else than you think
this is my new vibes okay why am I the
stupas person alive so y'all know I
don't like tomatoes I ordered the salad
and it's full of tomatoes and I do not
say no tomatoes lettuce sounds away no
he's spinning subscribe I'm eating bad
food why Joker we're talking about boys
without alcohol my god how's this
happening right oh my god so I ordered
these funnel cake fries if I don't asks
me why I'm not in a relationship this is
the answer right here because this is
better than anything I've ever
experienced in my body it's so good stop
it for the bill we're gonna have a fight
but the rose I got a seascape around
here
I give up after a while you're not
immune when something I wouldn't pay I'm
like honestly you should pay that I
don't care hey what's this a who knows
of us here in the vlogs again since
we're like let's tell them how are those
friends that never talk but when we talk
it's all good sense so who should be
dancers together we know he's getting to
my room here what even is happening with
my room I just have given up and yes it
was so nice thanks Matt after so long
see like I said before Smith and I have
this relationship where like she's one
of my closest friends
we barely
like I caught up with her and I feel
like it's back to normal
um Samantha just to give you some
context armrests come here just to give
you some context is this appeal like
deep in sentimental when I was like
going through my depressing phase of
life and on my absolute worst scariest
night
I only reached out to one person and I
don't know why I somehow managed to
reach out to one person and it was antha
so Sam is that person that Sam was that
person that subconsciously we both
taught each other so much in life we've
grown up in such a different I guess
situations where she really taught me
just to kind of like dude do what you
want to do I think growing up I was very
like what do you mean just do what you
want to do after consider so many things
but she really taught me like if you
wanna do something don't do it if you
wanna do it do it and I was like all
right
it's not like you took taught me lessons
I just saw how she lived life no psycho
so I really learned a lot from her I'm
just the same choice tells me that like
chilling with me she's always learning
it like there's such a different way
about thinking about like that she never
used to select really cool friends like
that and we about to try to hang out
more often so hopefully that happens
that's cool what we're gonna do now is
I'm gonna show my family's coming over
wind chill for a while why do I keep
touching my hair I think it's because I
think it looks really flat why do I care
again so chilled my family for a bit and
then nick bateman is actually in town so
he invited me out him a few of his
friends are going out so I invited an
ocean chase to come too so we're all
gonna go hang together so I'm gonna like
you know dress up I think we're going to
a club and my god
Wow I remember actually my deck club
well I do go to cause I got like grimy
classic grimy Groves clubs a flat Laurel
Club really over clubbing but I'm
assuming he's going to like a nicer club
so I'm like I do have to shave my legs
because honestly but that situation um
that's right now you kind of have to
poop Cheers
I need to have like a pile of pictures
of super over in my room every time
family comes over I'm siding a bunch of
autographs for their friends and other
family members I never have anything to
sign I might but I'll never find it
I know I had pictures somewhere can you
find me to pick you somewhere in my womb
so I have to get ready because it's like
9:00 and I have to let go look fabulous
right now we're going clubbing and then
I was like wait why am i lying down and
tired again I'm like all right because
I'm old as f9o voice myself to get up I
need to her turn it on girl go turn it
