we're on our way to Trinidad just
kidding Air Canada so here in a
situation once again where I you know
what I don't know why I continuously I
think I don't know why the situation is
that the flight that we're on apparently
they changed the aircraft and I was a
smaller flight so they kicked half the
people off the flight and now we're
about to wake up to and court including
half our dancers and we can't miss are
connecting play or we'll miss all of our
rehearsals and all that stuff so we're
about to go argue with them but I can
already tell that all my suppressed or
kinda feelings are just coming to the
surface right now and it's like a bad
relationship it's like seeing my ex at a
club and I have I've had a bit too much
to drink that's the vibe right now
they're barely brushing but we've been
waiting in line we got 10 minutes yeah
yeah stay tuned okay so the Protestant
situation to where they were gonna leave
one of our dancers Lauren behind she was
gonna make any of the flights and then
we argued with them and then they
wouldn't budge and luckily some racula
seat open and now she's on the plane but
hashtag in the air Canada and that was
the most stressful situation of life so
after a good start
they go alright so we're on the plane we
have like twelve hours of travel ahead
of us we have three hour flight to
Houston a three hour stopover in Houston
and like a five or six hour flight
12 whole hours is gonna be long soon to
be exhausting we're going to practice
every opportunity we have and I have so
much work to do sleep on the first
flight practice of the stopover work on
the second place so essentially I'll be

of these blogs is always someone
creeping in the back
