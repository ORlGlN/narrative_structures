maybe I didn't know idea to expect in
that movie I was alright it's pretty
good it's pretty good someone call my
cell a little bit flat for me but I
think should not the movie I think it's
me I thought my comedy is very different
usually when I laugh all the people
don't laugh and my first thought it was
great that was great acting and it's
based on true story it was lovely and
feel great that I'm having good balance
of work and not work so good my
definition of that is like work like a
lot but it's better than before small
steps we have a lot done today and very
very happy so let's see how we did
Oh watch the movie for the first time in
appear with my glasses and I'm like holy
crap everything is so clear before I
thought they were just shot and I'm like
finally put the shot and there no one
can read what that it was so small no
apparently they can they can read by
glass like with beautiful it was
spectacular when you're watching this
right now right now in a couple hours
and new videos near my main channel a
little sneak peek right here here are
real things that white people have said
to me my dad's name is Sukhwinder suk
winder so stuff wander

I love to swim my millionaire you know
one of my co-workers is Indian what a
small world

and I wore the full costume everything
and that's going to become and so when I
dropped an issue that people know at the
vlog channel since dawn I must see her
got a lot work tomorrow and say to do it
a lot of it is writing stuff writing
writing writing writing always right but
I'm going to read a little bit go to bed
and just absorb as much inspiration as I
can from every single thing around me
because that always makes writing easier
and version everywhere folks so good
it's like free knowledge floating around
folk that a Chanel tomorrow cuckoo
cuckoo if you like it subscribe if you
like it subscribe stop also today I
recognize I had a little bit of a cheat
with the popcorn and Coke Zero but you

I'm not depriving myself I'm going to
eat healthy I'm making better choices
slow by slow
I just cannot go to a theater and watch
movies at popcorn it's basically
impossible I cannot do that I will make
up for tomorrow maybe I'll speed walk or
something we'll see
