and I'm sad I'd look at this shirt
someone on it it's a spray painted team
super unicorn shirt okay and I'll show
you later when I gotta have to show you
it's really cool though we're at the
airport right to go to Chicago we have a
show today we're showing today right we
have a show today no no we have a show
today but not a show tomorrow yeah we
having a grand old time
we're just baffled over Southwest
Airlines basically how they do their
seats if you watch on previous losses
first come first serve but the line is
not first come first serve so basically
I had a conversation with her and I was
like hey Sookie I changed my seat and
she was like no it's first come first
serve and unfortunately cuz your number
you're gonna be last in line so cuz
you're four line a point number six to
probably get ability you know Mike so I
can't change it well for sixteen dollars
I can push to that front of the line I'm
like if the plane is first come first
serve why do I have to line up at the
back of the line to get on the plane
behind should be first come first serve
Southwest give to you I feel like I need
to start my own airline because if you
like every airline is walking somewhere
except for like question I like West it
even British like British as well no we
did about these guys making us wait
three hours
and they tweeted me back and offered me
$100 off a flight and I asked how are
you doing me a favor by encouraging me
to spend more money with your airline
whack people whack it's my girl shiny
took my pillow and save me window a
shiny take a bow that's my girl that's
that's my girl pretty my favorite Oh
shiny is my favorite I mean Shawn is my
favorite she's a Missy virtual plane
buddy
he's as the middle seat you get into my
shoulders really

okay
made to Chicago I am so dizzy and not
feeling the best I think I just really
need to sleep so that someone do I don't
get that much sleep cuz I'll call time
is soon cause they're so cool next a
little bit I'm so disoriented a I'll
talk to you after my nap we are headed
to the venue boggle I'm super like I
think when I landed today what's the
most tired bit of this entire tour and
couldn't include everything I was so
tired to add in orders so I need to like
get my energy up so my dad is driving us
let's go Chicago today I love the change
once I've got these mirrors cuz it's
good to do makeup great everyone set my
makeup in some change rooms it's been
really hard still wearing my shirt but
the sign got me so dope I love it and so
we're we're chillin apparently today's
so many people have called a theater
asking if there's internet for some
reason they've set up a whole new Wi-Fi
network called unicorn Island today's
show which is really really cool so yeah
also tomorrow our flight out of
Chicago's later so tonight we're gonna
go out but also today's Thursday I don't
know what I'd possibly post a video I
have to go out because everyone's going
out the team's going out and then when I
come back we will see ya at the rock
star today dad's the best today's
theatre you know very cool what's
different is there's like a gap here
between me in the first row which it
usually never happens you see people
right here so that'll be different and
we're using a bandage I don't know if
you notice that we have banners that we
can only use in some venues so if you're
looking at this right now I'd be like I
never saw the van banners because they
could only be used in some menus and
daddy Dave designed that by the way I
don't know if you know this that is not
just a tour manager he does set design
like he's designed like when I put the
visual stuff together he's like this
will work this won't work he's done
Tyler's tour
yep and cake boss right cake bosses tour
and he designed these banners and he's
so good at it he's so good at so he's
multi-talented also john everyon going
to john is not just stage writer he's a
lighting technician like during tech
Parcells designers sorry lighting
designer sorry he like knows what lights
will look good with what skin color
sorry I'm ignorant what those lights
look good with what skin color saw stuff
I totally relate because I don't like
when people call me a vlogger I'm like
I'm not a vlogger I am so I apologize
designer lighting designer cool it's
gonna be fun
it's gonna be an also tradition on the
way to the theater every single time I
google on far the closest triple layers
just for my knowledge in case I need to
run away this one is four minutes away

sound check check one two one two
I think we're running a little behind
schedule today cuz went to the venue
love it later but we go make it happen
right on the beat blammo our next wasn't
that cool room break say Canada I really
like Vancouver oh I love it
so mr. amazing lighting designer John
has this cool app where I can control
the lighting with this app so like like

lighting just changed that's really cool
salt game on point there's my outfit my
shirt says Netflix nachos and naps hey
Dad what show is this show 26 show 26 is
my champagne show okay let's do it
my birthday's in the taint six I just
made not of this month not it's not even
real okay
something down on my change room alone
on the floor meditating because I've
discovered in my life I've had a lot of
things you don't have suffered
depression I have a lot of negative
feelings I've had a lot of rollercoaster
rides but something I never used to
experience before those troubles anxiety
like I never used to get anxiety but
I've noticed on destroyer I get that
these overwhelming feelings are like
it's not like I need to sit down take
deep breaths that is what I'm doing
right now you know the silver lining is
this tour is gonna make me such a
stronger person like mentally
emotionally physically stronger I feel
like every day I wake up for this tour
and I'm going to the gym for my brain
like literally that's a silver lining
I'm happy and I accept all the struggles
and challenges and ups and downs and
tears and excitement and smiles and
everything because everything that's
been challenging in my life has improved
me in some way so this tour is just I'm
gonna lose working out everyday work get
all my emotions working out my brain
that's my silver lining
what's up so I just got back to the
hotel I had a really rough time at the
end of the show and I almost broke down
and cried in front of everyone
few things went wrong during the show
but that's not why I broke down I
literally had like a legit full-on
anxiety attack like during our powwow I
was just like couldn't all control it I
don't know what it is I'm so overwhelmed
Thursday is video day but I'm deciding
to make a healthy decision and going
have fun with everyone and try to come
home and do a video because I really
need to just not be alone right now so
that's what I'm gonna do I'll talk more
later but I'm gonna try to go out and
have fun right now so the club was wack
and we left I'm doing anything with a
large group is impossible so there's
dancers there yeah I just have a bad
habit of not knowing how to casually
dance um humble and his cousin me and
jazz we just left go walk around for a
little bit I'm gonna go back to the
hotel soon and make my video that's what
I want to do in life so yeah that's
what's happening
all right so I'm back in my hotel room
everyone's still out they wanted to
chill but I came back we came back with
me um I'm going to just do my video and
then something like I should just say it
into my video well I'm gonna do my video
and then I'm gonna try to get some sleep
I guess almost humble and just come back
and convinced me to get food but
otherwise yeah I'm severely overwhelmed
right now
not because I'm not getting sleep yeah
yeah yeah I know it wasn't a common
thing to slow down T it hasn't nothing
to do with that has everything to do
with the fact that I have performed 26
times I love it
but as 26 shows 26 meet and greets on
top of videos on top of it's not even
the workload it's on top of like
emotional trauma I'm going through on
top of life problems on top of like
being a human being that's more so what
it is but I'm not gonna go on and on
about it I'm gonna work on my video I
killed the tripod game if I may say so
myself today come on come on come on
video I kept my promise we're just
talking I don't he's so wonderful to
talk to at 6 a.m. and I'm sorry talking
we were talking about crap more than 5
hours so when they like oh everyone has
to be in the lobby for noon
really oh no that means we can sleep for
6 hours let's stay up longer here he's
right same thing happened yesterday we
had a late call time and was like ha we
need to play taboo for two hours we
can't go to sleep now that would be too
responsible
no but you inner conversations go off on
like a billion tangents I mean the start
of conversation of what apples right now
ok and 6 hours when I come back and
we'll be talking about like forgetting
architecture like we are problems
young Simpson's when he made his demands
he whispered one versus the earth and he
made it to the other end of the person
like Skinner demands that he just get
their God back monkey dishwashers do
this for the secret after the new world
at the end yeah Bokke doing them yeah
most of our relationship wasn't making
Simpsons references by the way that's
how we communicate with each other yeah
accordingly no one else understands
rather someone bought me a Duff and a
flaming Moe and I was so happy uses the
Duff and this is the flaming one I just
want to know if it coughs or everything
