bon jour more yeah there's gonna be a
day there's gonna be a goddamn did you
cook today is gonna be I'm so tired
I said that sir I resolved with that so
everyone will feel better today I'm so
tired get the aircraft I am today I woke
up it is 9:30 I went to better for
nothing for my just last gallon today
may be a jam-packed day here's the
mission universally my hair makeup done
and heading to a shoot to the VR shoot
you know how I feel of VR so fingers
crossed as I have rehearsal with my
dancers then I have a full dress
rehearsal then I got to do my show which
I'm nervous and excited about but
nervous about and then there's a master
party which arm either gonna sleep
through or get drunk at one of those two
things then I'm gonna pack my stuff and
then we're going to head to the airport
in the morning in fact all of that
obviously I'm going to commit to
everything I do today everything I do
today is out of my comfort zone but I'm
just gonna be like yo I'm going to
commit fully and just do my absolute
best also I've been blurry this whole
tape we're off to a great start first
breakfast shout out to the og that works
at the hotel that put skittles on
everything on one of our food deliveries
I appreciate you is in breakfast quality
- good excited to see your show that
makes one of us
fun fact I slept in the shirt and now
I'm going to do a video on it
how about to do this confessional pieces
VR and I'm confessing something that's a
good personal story so much
it'll be so funny to talk about
virginity because everyone will laugh
haha so that's what I'm gonna do right
now and just kind of the vibe a
obviously asked to wear my glasses
because I have to really hone so old and
I old you know it is I look good in
glasses God knows God knows was a
revenge time what do you say I'm in
Jurassic Park as a truck the big
dinosaur is waking up all getting up all
the guys are getting up me in the
morning I'll give you guys what an
emotional rollercoaster this is that was
awesome I wasn't worried about that but
that was so much I think they were
really impressed with me they were
really am pretty worried I wasn't really
impressed with you are you kidding me
you brought up heard enough of like what
an hour and a half of sleep has the
pressure to pressure the s9 a
conversation with Kyle and this is how
one I was like oh yeah so we're going to
Montreal he's like what state is that in
and then I said are you kidding me and
he's like no and then I'm like Canada's
and half states and then he says it has
Providence's right and I'm like
Providence's it has provinces you know
the funny about it none of these people
understood the joke until I just said
problems because they also thought it
was Providence's
actually I thought in the States
Americans I tell you unless these by the
way these are my portable lights I
traveled with in this case they're like
flex even flex them because I have to
shoot some stuff for my show today for
some videos I needed so I was like that
we're not up in the world so I stood
this confessional thing which is nothing
I was so nervous about because also
going to memorize this thing and I'm
like do it in one take because we are
but I did it and I think they're really
impressive really happy about it I think
that's going to be the theme for the
rest of the day because I'm not going to
lie Jay's a little bit stressful for me
I've done stand-up before it's not what
I do every day so out of my comfort zone
for sure I'm actually hosting a gala so
the lineup of comedians up in the star I
kind of look like a musical entrance and
I have 10 minutes of stand-up then in
the middle I have a little bit
parents which is like seven months of
stand-up and then it closed the show
great for name you are also comedians on
the show so a lot of stage Simon's a lot
of stand-up and I'm just like maybe the
theme for stages to commit like I
mentioned today
look the confessional I just won and I'm
like not gonna be scared of looking
stupid I'm not going to be scared of
sounding dumb I'm not being scared of
not being funny I'm going to commit and
tell these jokes this is the funniest
thing I'm going to commit my facial
sessions and everything to this being
the best thing I've ever done and that's
not one do for the show I'm going to try
my best and come in and do it with full
confidence and hope for the best and if
people laughing laughing people don't
let they don't laugh but I'm going to
make sure that the reason is not because
I didn't commit a hundred percent I'm
going to commit hundred percent came
back home they went out for lunch I came
back to the hotel to practice and more
subtle into and we won't get it done
fine so yeah my damages my dancers are
hot as hell and buffets and I'm just
like can we make this dance routines a
little longer in the center straight
there's a good way beyond the
expectation and we say a lyrics lifehack
I know them by term otherwise you don't
know as well as I could so the vocal
level of the audio is 100% not 70 or 50
like it should be so that you'll see
over here if I miss one sentence is
sometimes also don't say sentence to
emphasize the next one so you'll still
hear all the lyrics anyway like that
yeah
how the going guys over course I feel
good I buy our muscles all nervous and
still I won't be for a long time a lot
of things I'm super excited these can be
great and so what are you trying asking
until a lovely surprise of them passes
