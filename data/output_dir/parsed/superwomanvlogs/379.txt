you might get lost some stranger might
take you home I don't want that although
I want to be that person at W party was
the people and I'm like recording I
don't like to vlog in situations what
other people might feel uncomfortable
and that might be the case because all
these people are like you know knowing
people so and leave it home but I've
seen a bit and I come back home I'll
miss you and behave and eat your
vegetables I mean unless you want if
they could taste grab me the note okay
holy crap my feet are broken and you
know I love you so much because the
first thing I did when I came home was
to start this vlog and not take off my
shoes even though I'm sure my fear like
bleeding right now they hurt so badly
that was so great can't tell you
something I'm an emotional moment
because I will never get used to going
to a party and walking in and seeing
Justin Timberlake and seeking we don't
know dick I feel like I walked in and
remember I went to a party similar to
this when it was the Oscars after-party
and so like this in this party Justin
Timberlake's there Leonarda Caprio walks
by me like peach he'll be chill
I never fangirl no situation was a chill
chill chill cool cool cool - so me my
friends Priyanka was there Charlize was
there down shoulders there just so many
people I haven't seen so long I was like
ah and comparing to like previous
parties I've gone to with WB we're like
no one knows me just a contrast from
last year this year was like I met
childish gambino and you already knew me
he's friends with rope I don't know but
she's like meeting people in like I met
Tom
like just it was great I felt really
like validated in my career and I don't
know that's lame or not but I'm saying
it and it would just get my feet are
killing though knock a lot it is a
little bit past midnight I'm planning to
take my shoes off change here's the
thing I have to write a script and I
have to shoot a bit of a video and we're
really tired but I'm thinking that my
makeup is done my hair is done I might
as well shoot a bit of this video you
know I'm so damn tired just to tough it
out so that's what I might do right now
first this person to help these mother
effing shoes right now damn I'm so tired
but I'm committed to shooting at least
the rat portion of my video I won't go
through all of it because it requires my
cheeks and bottom jeez and that's just a
little bit too much for me right now but
I'm gonna leave to the rat portion push
through because you don't get to go to
the Golden Globes afterparty you don't
work hard we want to continue having
these opportunities so hmm
okay so I shot the round portion which
is really really short it's fine by
change my lipstick color for because my
lipstick was left up before and now I
just really meant book notes are due
tomorrow morning is 1:40 a.m. I'm really
pushing Michael items so I know part of
me wants to do this right now but I
forego through all of these 300 pages
Evan just write the notes that I made on
page every time I do this I tell myself

I never effing do so now I'm just like
digging so deep in my soul to get this
done goddamn Sunday it's through 11:00
