sense when you actually know what the
videos about you don't have context it's
conversation but you can refer back to
the conversation when I say am unfocused
what if thank you I just want to create
videos and content that are inclusive
you know I want all of you when you
watch my videos to be like yo I know I'm
a real person and I'm being represented
in this video and I have friends that
are real people and they're being
represented by see I can't represent
people all times in every video but I've
decided I want to make an active effort
to like show real people you know if I
have to play those people that's ok I am
okay with that I'm okay with molding my
reality and molding myself for a
character in a video to make it more
inclusive and I want to make an active
effort to do that because think it might
feel good if you're young and you're
watching a video you like if I'm a
creator you like and you're like yo
