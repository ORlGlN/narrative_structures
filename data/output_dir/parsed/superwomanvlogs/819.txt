mimimi mimimi rant rant 1 good morning
good afternoon it is 1 p.m. I've already
woken up I have brushed my teeth and I
breakfast and I had a conference call
and sent a few emails now I'm headed to
the mall I know before you judge me it's
because I went to the Janoskians
mockumentary premiere and there's a red
carpet and I'm like all got anything
over there anything for the red carpet
so I'm heading to the mall I want to buy
something super simple it's not
expensive I feel this gonna be
semi-casual so like kind of like a basic
dress or rompers I'm thinking a mean
wear some converse just came back sample
we're gonna give a temple so went to the
mall to do that then I gotta come back
and release today's vlog do a bunch of
work and then King is coming with me to
the premiere ok first of all focus also
no makeup zone ok I lied to fill in my
eyebrows a little bit but like I had to
I otherwise I would never eyebrows don't
judge me this guy over here this is why
I can't be a red lights cuz I do stupid
crap like this here he's in the Beverly
Center whoo it's hot in the Beverly
Center um something should know about me
I'm that person who parks my car and it
has no idea where it is like I won't
take 45 minutes to find my car every
time I park anywhere so now I've made
this cautious I first like we memorize
where I park and about the some smart
the other day she took a picture of the
spot and I was like embrace the thing at
me that's okay yeah you you you boo boo
boo boo boo boo you
straight judgement this is so hard to do
without sandy I don't know what to do
somebody pick an outfit for me okay I'm
the biggest fail ever I have struggled
so much the shelf I'm George bought a
whole bunch of random stuff I still
don't know what I'm wearing I'm hoping I
can put something together um I bought
me forever 21 walked out as I was
walking out saw something else stood in
line again forever about it again and I
just walked out again and I saw
something else and I'm like no I keep
not checking the straw properly even
buying things just the worst you know it
is hungry my brains not working you can
make myself some pizza naan also in that
pizza sweater I was wearing yesterday
Shay really liked it so I bought her one
it's not mature can be painted twins
alright so I'm gonna make myself some
pizza and on my 30 minutes to my next
call and then you just post my vlog and
then you start getting ready and figure
out if I even bought anything that makes
sense other than one Jamal knows like
outfit can you meet me in this aisle
outfit because I'll order a few is dope
yeah ok let's talk about something real
quick I'm gonna have to go on a little
rent because I'm passionate about
certain things and I feel the need to
voice them ok basically right now my
Monday video the one I made yesterday
that my parents reacting to one
Direction's drag me down is currently
blocked called him my homies at youtuber
I'm like dude what's going on this
morning I received an email saying hey
so-and-so has claimed so-and-so for the
video so I was like ok that means
they're gonna make money off the video
what I wasn't too stressed cuz I'm like
honestly do whatever they want to make
money off the video I'll deal with it
later not a big deal I they sent me this
email of things to do if I want to
dispute the claim and I was like I'll do
when I get home it's cool I wasn't a few
hours ago I come home and now my Twitter
is full of people talking thats actually
blocked so they went so far says like no
now no one can watch it and I'll tell
you why I'm annoyed there is many
opinions on if reacting to things is
fair use as you know the finebros have
like you know parents react kids react
they have all that stuff i have 13
episodes of my parents reacting it has
never been an issue it is a gray area
where it's like well you are reacting
someone's content but you're
commentating on us are offering
something new with the either way the
way I see it is like I'm very annoyed
that my video is blocked because you
know I stayed up late
make it is a lot of effort to make it
and you're gonna block it claiming that
it's copyright when if people wanted to
watch one Direction's drag me down they
would watch One Direction's drag me to a
music video if they're watching my
parents reacting guess what they're
watching from when jeath and pot mg not
for one direction is that just me like
they're watching to see the comedy that
my parents are gonna give in the video
so that's why I do not agree with this
whole always cooperates our content no
because it was your content and people
want to see that content they would just
watch your content is that I'm so
annoyed right now so I really hope that
it gets figured out because it's a
really good video and I really like the
video and a lot of you have really liked
it so I just wanna let you know this is
not my control I'm trying to get it I'm
trying to get it I'm really passionate
like hi can you make this a high
priority because this is really annoying
me but I hope that it gets resolved but
I was like dude not cool and it's kind
of annoying that like of all the things
I've reacted to a One Direction music
video was the one that did it because
that's the one you guys are probably
most excited to see and I've never had
this issue with and you know so it's not
one I'm not blaming one direction isn't
it's obviously the record label but I'm
just saying it's I'm annoyed I'm annoyed
okay I'm annoyed anyways I'm done
ranting about it because I did what I
could do I'm waiting on YouTube now I'm
waiting on all these YouTube can't like
YouTube is neutral they can't do but
they're helping me because they're
helpful so see my options are I'm gonna
get ready in the mean time because
that's a productive thing to do and as I
mentioned yesterday I'm not about just
like going on and on not about emotions
when there's practical solutions that
can be done so a drink this cold water
and Chava up out while I go make myself
look fabulous bring something so simple
it's actually the backup dress I bought
not the first dress
and if you didn't wake me businesses
like kidding what are you wearing I'm
like stress this girl is a Janoskians
they're so goofy whoever never liked
truth more sneakers and like the
fighting cute rap but um I'm running
late so yeah okay so I'm doing a
ponytail again which I usually don't do
because I feel like a man but it's so
hot outside
I forgot my tie in my ear bloom looks
really cute when you can see it so I'm
debating I usually also don't do a
ponytail because it hurts my head very
quickly but I'm gonna try to top it out
today let me tell you something do you
like the pony this is the vibes let me
show you who I let me try to go to the
dark mirror over there so I got my
jewelry on etc but it's like a cute
dress thing and I got these cute
sneakers I'm just gonna cut cash 40 cash
kinda you know just doing my thing
hoping I'm not underdressed hmm okay so
I laughed it came right back because
King message music can you please bring
a napkin like the embarrassing moment
when I don't have a napkin in my place
not to pull a napkin anywhere okay
toilet paper in his goddamn wheeze on
his red carpet it's my dick yeah no idea
what to expect I'm adding a whole bunch
of like yeah
yes amazing cheesecake Oh mother grow up
again thank god this la trip I actually
have friends you're always my friend I
won't lie sentimental moment one of the
reasons I feel more comfortable moving
today is because of this man right here
every time I think I wouldn't be like
super like dying and only like ah but
King is there it's okay all right though
when that day happens I'm gonna like you
helped me move by the way because I
don't carry those boxes yeah you're
gonna what carried out these newly newly
certain games up in here go on and score
my Instagram where his Instagram
everyone's commenting on how bomb his
arms look no comment right now this guy
sacks a girl so we sear his mac and
cheese is my everything right out is so
good
who's over here you got
enough to be a small country he was
starving Hughes banished n hannahs are
no wait come join us which is very
exciting for me because I have flopped
under a 1000 times thus far on this trip
and so is she
so good things happen now you might see
this right here and think it's the
sweetest thing at the table but I beg to
differ because this right here is the
sweetest thing at the table it's you
hang out for like a lot of days but I
had to come to the cheese factory to do
it the video I worked so hard on last
night that is not active right now is
the reason we couldn't tell you know
what's the best thing I ever did was
what made my son I'm home and my place
place is an absolute mess like
everything is everywhere I think I know
my brain I'm like leave me a few days
I'm like I don't anything you ready for
this joyous moment I survived with the
ponytail oh yes that's what I'm talking
about a little yes yes you know what it
means to have your hair hurt we can be
friends because oh yes I'm so happy
Hannah came I as you know I've been
trying to meet up with her as well I'm
happy she came she's just a little
bundle of joy the Janoskians movie was
awesome it was like so
I'm so happy watching cuz I kept
thinking about my movie and I was really
selfish but I was like think about my
movie like how it's gonna be different
how it's gonna be just I don't know how
it's gonna be the same and it was
similar it will happen just I'm just so
intrigued with all the awesome stuff
that my room is a mess I'm sorry all the
awesome stuff all of these creators are
doing it's so exciting to see and it's
so awesome to witness and be a part of
it I feel like blessed and privileged to
go to these screenings and go to these
events and just be like holy crap all
these people are doing amazing things so
huge shadows and gratulations Janoskians
um I'm only friends with James I've know
the other ones too well but James is
such a sweetheart and he's really happy
I came in I was really happy I went as
well so it's awesome I have a jam-packed
day tomorrow full of meetings the first
meetings like 9:00
and I was like Sara do you know me like
do you even know me
but I gotta do that stuff and then
Thursday I've actually changed my flight
to Friday early morning it's so early
that it's essentially Thursday night
but I'm so sad and I can just honestly
say let's have a moment of real talk
that's the first time that have come to
Alayna felt like I've had friends I know
that's like a really dramatic statement
like of course that friends you know I
of course I have friends but it's like
I've hung out with people like leisurely
like when traditional with bath I went
to dinner with King like Huggle with
Hannah and tomorrow I'm shooting with
grace hopefully I think that's still on
but like when - Lindsey show just really
got to like just hang out with people
and it's made me feel a lot more
comfortable moving here and so I'm
really excited about that I was a really
big struggle for me I've been to at
least so many times I've never felt like
I've had friends or I've had people to
hang out with that's what I was
consuming myself in 24/7 work but it's
made me feel a lot better about moving
here and a lot more comfortable so
that's really it's a really I think
that's the biggest accomplishment of
this entire trip to be honest but I'm
not a Ben and stop talking start talking
