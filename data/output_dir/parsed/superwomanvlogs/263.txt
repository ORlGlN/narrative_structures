six so good morning I thought about all
I know about cricket it's six and six is
a four is a I feel like it's a sick good
morning today is our last day in the
UK's our London showed as a daytime show
I feel rough this morning I my stomach's
a little bit upset even last night I
think is a combination of like not
eating on schedule as I've established
the sleeping is going to Ross men folk
up again at 5:30 a.m. way way before I
tried to force myself to go back to
sleep I think I figure out what it is I
think it is the fact that we travel
every day in the car and 2003 for our
nap and even uncomfortable to four-hour
nap but then it makes it hard for me to
fall asleep at night so I'm actually
really excited to go to India cuz I feel
like it's more opposite than Iowa in
terms of time zones it'll be like the
REC opposite which is easier than like
slightly off I feel everything you said
I don't know but I'm very excited to my
last London she was actually sunny which
is great cricket stadium here my room is
here and can be a sick venue I'm excited
about it and right after the show we are
heading to the airport where India
hasn't really hit me yet but today's
mission is you we are going to finish
our hair and makeup I need to redo my
braids a little bit a some makeup maybe
tuck in my shirt

cool I like it and you want to do the
London show we do the golden ticket
winners what I'm going to do them hoping
journey but I want to meet them and we
have a meet and greet with around 650
people so it's going to be long and
tiring what we're going to it after that

flying to India and on that flight I
gotta adjust the countdown for the show

tumble posted about this when we say I'm

offensive to India is that when you're

not used to the water and the dairy
analysis of your body is not used to it
that doesn't mean by that no one's been
offended but in case you were clarified
