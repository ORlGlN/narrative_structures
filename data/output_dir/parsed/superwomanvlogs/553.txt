what I feel like is cold today
I feel like I don't know if it's because
this blind is closed but I feel like
it's a little hole today it's only 79 in
my house my is Fahrenheit which is like
not in the 80s was just like cold for me
so hopefully that helped the situation
good morning I woke up at 11:30 which is
way earlier than I've been waking up and
I forced myself even though I was tired
shut up and wake up last time I was so
productive I plan to stay true to that
again today today I'm introducing really
exciting Charlize
like from Mad Max that actress heard her
team have invited me to like this
intimate dinner conversation but what we
can do to help the aids aids epidemic so
that's really cool I'm going to meet her
and have a really meaningful discussion
but how to make the world a better place
that's why I'm going tonight but tifford
right now for you know it's on the first
minute of my vlog I can't speak English
in the first minute I'm just at Club
Bravo Bob but I wouldn't do some work
and then the evening that someday I'm
going to that dinner
my dad was crack-a-lackin' yesterday was
about options let's see what today is
about and I for food the cards fall
everywhere ready ready ready these new
cards in these old cards
oh I think these are new cards that
cards are out of order
no okay Hey today is about picked up to
goddamnit
today is about no judgment honestly I
feel like I need to make a version of
these cards for myself because like I
feel like I have something to say about
all these things as well but also these
are the exact things I would say maybe I
should endorse this company and like
invest anyways no judgment I release
myself from any and all judgments oh my
god I have a story about this in a
second I find my inner critic I find my
inner critic call it to my office and
tell us take a vacation
as it leaves the room I let out a sigh
and begin to enjoy the joy of be the joy
of simply being who hired that guy
anyways first of all let's talk about
two things I can't read most of you guys
any time I read these cards I just taken
my Invisalign
good morning and I'm just like but this
one is about no judgement releasing
yourself from all judgments finding your
inner critic calling into your office
until you take your vacation I think
this is really important because this
actually really resonates with me the
other day when I was like 2 vols going I
was feeling like a little bit out of it
inside and like lonely I actually
meditated for a while and my version of
meditation like I don't follow any way
to do it I just do it my own way I light
my candle I sit there I close I let my
candle I sit there and I say things to
myself out loud that I need to hear and
one of the things I was talking about
his judgment I was upset about a lot of
situations and I was repeating to myself
over and over again like you were not in
the position don't have the right to
judge a lot of these people in
situations and I was repeating that ones
over and over again that made me feel so
much happier letting go of that judgment
letting go just to that desire to look
at certain situations and be like oh
it's because this person's like this and
this person wants us and just like
stripping all that away and seeing a
situation for what it really is so so
important if you let go of judgment
you'll be such a happier person but
that's what's crack-a-lackin' swag here
oh why are you standing here reading
this when you could be working and she
said just kidding please stop working
and sleep never let's get to work
being mad productive all over again I'm
having a creative you know what it is
for there's two video ideas I have that
I can't tell you what they're about yet
I'm putting no limit on my brain of how
crazy they can be so one thing ideas I
thought of is like so crazy like it's
gonna be so expensive it's so impossible
to do but I want to do it so I'm buying
just hire a bunch of people and be like
please make this happen I really want to
do this but I just had like a creative
moment right now which I thought oh so
dope is I'm very excited about that but
I'm about to start getting ready to head
to this dinner with Charlize and I spent
over here hmm-hmm
welcome to this episode of Lilly is
trying to dress herself so this is what
I wear like an army green cute dressing
with these silver shoes and then wear
black blazer on top oh my god necklace I
got my bow this is the vibe this is like
you know suppose you like business cash
so you know like what I have to my thank
you little dress little blazer hopefully
kind of I don't know who knows myself
but I kind of learned how to do my
lipstick huh all right I'm gonna stop
signs hopefully I don't get to go soon
because the camera is the fall but so
I'm here does dinner I've never been to
anything like this before it's a good
intimate conversation about the social
causes one's about AIDS
Charlize is hosting it and why are you
honking at me when there's so many cars
coming understand um and I never been to
it so I'm just going to learn a lot and
kind of experience things yeah I mean
I'm never gonna be ups turn here never
Dakar is flying okay let me just preface
this with no amount of words I say right
now are gonna express how phenomenal
that dinner was it was so inspirational
so one who I've never been to anything
like that and I had no idea what to
expect it was literally a group of 20
ish people that just had great ideas and
came from all different walks of life
and we talked about hiv/aids and it was
just phenomenal
first of all Charlize is so passionate
about it which was great to see it was a
really just intelligent conversation
about what we can do and turns I learned
a lot I don't know a lot about HIV at
all like I never learned about it in
school I haven't had any conversations
about it I learned so much and I felt so
inspired to tell you all about the
things first of all number one and I
feel almost stupid saying this and even
when I heard the sales like what did you
know that HIV is completely preventable
but it's still like the second leading
cause in North America the number one
leading cause in Africa of deaths
between uh amongst adolescents I had no
idea I don't know if I've just been
living under a rock I had no idea that
it was completely preventable but it's
still killing so many people and
statistically 37 million people on the
planet have HIV like are HIV positive
but I just don't understand I just don't
and just I just understand I started and
so like I am committed I've committed
now to learning more about this and
doing what I can whether it's sharing
this information with you telling you
ways that you can get involve the
conversation as long as I just have some
open communication going here
because your team super and team super
changes the world for the better and
this is just one phenomenal way we're
gonna change the world for the better
um Charlie's is wonderful afterwards it
was just so overwhelming because when I
see someone like Charlie someone that I
was like holy crap you're amazing I what
you do like she's a phenomenal actress
and I loved I love watching her on the
big screen I mesmerized by her so for
her to come to me and be like Lily I'm
such a big fan of I'm baffled by what
you do it's like what you babble
bomb-maker baffled by you know your
babble binding what you've done well so
this is like so great
um we're definitely gonna do something
together we're going to think of some
girl love some Jen and and stuff genders
the hashtag that she promotes to end the
epidemic and it's just like I'm gonna
commit myself to doing myself a crash
course and learning about this and
sharing this information with you it was
so wonderful the two things I can tell
you right off the bat and this is coming
from a place of genuine passion that has
been sparked is that dude we got to
change the world a lot of ways one is
that like you know one of the biggest
problems with epidemics and a lot of
things whether it's rape culture
anything it's that taboo associated with
talking about sex in our culture's and
trust me I know when I said that half
you probably cringe because just like me
you might have grown up in a culture
that people don't talk about sex and
that's kind of a problem and even me you
know me you don't know about sex come on
you already know you know what keep it
real with you okay I don't but I do know
that when you do it you gotta be safe
and these things you'd be discussed and
parents need to talk to their kids and
kids need to talk to each other and the
conversation is we started so that's all
I wanna say for today but just something
to think about of how team supers gonna
help change the world and it's gonna be
through things like this and so shadow
Charlize Jenna and it I'm going to talk
more about this later and just ruin this
together that's what's up yo the time is
1:30 for getting mad work that I'm
almost done for the night and I head to
bed um I'm obsessed with sticky notes mo
cuishle because a lot of them say things
on current policy could be like their
sticky notes everywhere on my desk I'll
show you a quick flash ready not a wand

stuff over there na na na that boss
slipstone
