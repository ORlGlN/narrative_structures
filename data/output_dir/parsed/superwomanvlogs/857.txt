I woke up like this that's why I look
like a train ran me over yo good morning
I'm in my onesie
I'm in my onesie I woke up this morning
with a major heading against exactly
what happened I was like this and I woke
up and I was like hey you know I'm back
to sleep and I woke up and I'm feeling a
little bit better but I'm kind of
getting concerned now because my
headaches are pretty frequent and I am
getting sleep and I think I don't know
what it is maybe more water or I really
think it's rude it's routing from my
shoulders my shoulders feel like rock
solid all the time and no amount of
massages are helping but enough about me
today's our Hartford Show I'm very very
excited I was just going over my comedy
set even though I've done the show
twenty-something times I still like to
go over it and tighten it cuz last time
my last show Uncle John said that my
comedy set ran long and it wasn't as
tight as usual so I was like good time
to strap up very critical of myself so I
just went over my comedy set um and yeah
I'm making a few little minor changes to
the show but but I have an ear and well
focus but yeah that's what's happening
today and last night I'm so proud of
myself as have a moment here I promised
myself that during the North American
leg of this tour I would not miss the
video no matter what and I have held
true to that I've held true to that last
night my head was pounding like no video
doesn't matter I posted it it is types
of dreams and I'm wearing this when Z
that a wonderful fan gave me and it's
good to see ya when you're ready to
leave soon and today's gonna be a great
day because I'm deciding that it's gonna
be a great day and if you're watching

whatever one to go so bored we're doing
sound check
oh that's a wrap on the Hartford Show I
was saying during last rooms well I
think one thing that's really important
is I feel like we work so well as a team
the dance is a night out and like
everywhere in jazz the change is humble
when it comes to everything so great
like every audience has a different
mount of energy some have more sometimes
less some laughs a joke some don't so
the end rizal ways different but we're
now able to officially gain energy from
each other regardless of what that ideas
on the stage and I mean in the audience
re and the audience is usually great but
on days were even like there's less
people there whatever like we get energy
off each other and that's the sign of a
great team when you guys motivate each
other on stage it will blast on stage
and you perform for each other for
yourselves and the audience so really
good show I had great pal not a blast
I also pinched Paulo's nipple half way
