it's New Years Eve and I woke up without
washing my makeup last night which means
I'm on a great path or 2018 my friends
good morning good afternoon good evening
wherever you are deep super it is New
Year's Eve it is our chance to okay
let's talk about this first because I
was about to be like our chance to have
a great start we knew you were just true
but here's the thing about resolutions
right I'm a big believer that success
and Happiness is really about making
tough decisions every single day
resolutions are great cuz they give you
some clarity they give you goals they
give you focus and vision all good
things I like I like a lot but don't
think that you make one decision and
then the rest of you year you can break
okay and remember that decision I mean
you gotta make resolutions every single
day that's what success in happiness is
about you know why because the world
around you changes every single their
environment the people your challenges
your goals I'm gonna change every single
day you have to make those tough choices
and resolutions every morning that's
what 2018 is gonna be about well
evolving adapting growing learning
that's what's today my resolutions
include this nintendo wii alcohol
possibly and just fun and good vibes and
a lot more of my hand doing this thing
that is doing right now
Oh Marius this is our bathing suits for
2017 our friends and humans wretches our
best night I'd answer why do you have no
friends in all of 2017 orders I brought
some caption to them like I'm just
saying you know what I saw me because

this good light for myself hold back
when you wake up to BAE making breakfast

don't believe in resolution but today
the goal is awful and I have decided all
the things that have never been able to
plug into the TV we're not going into
2018 like that okay we got to see that
of course
because it kind of fell unless we say
the last one last night is almost too
agent but I'm talking to Apple TV chrome
