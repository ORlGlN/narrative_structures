this house has a million blinking lights
but no hot water
good morning I woke up I slept in a
little bit it happens every day in LA I
woke up really early in the cold so
really I should go back to sleep
go out to sleep wake up I like eleven
twelve but it's okay it's twelve I want
to hop in the shower no hot water
totally cold you know the one thing I
hate about life is coldness I am such a
pansy with coldness but I was like no
see what's happening the universe is
trying to bring me down because it knows
I was frustrated but no I refuse it's
okay big shower doesn't matter I'm gonna
go to the mall because I ever officially
run out of clothes the last top I have
to wear I wore do you think every single
day I need about one or two tops and
like another pair of pants to survive
the week that's what I'm gonna do the
first I'm gonna fix my face buddy
one two three and there you go a lot of
me like how I do my makeup and like I'm
at a beauty guru I don't know how to do
makeup last night I was like binge
watching my life is a mime like oh my
god you saw and just not bread eh I'll
tell you quickly what I do like if I'm
just going out and like basic day not an
event and I you think concealer on I put
foundation on feeling my eyebrows a
little bit put a little bit blush on and
usually put mascara on I didn't put my
skin now I only just curled my eyelashes
because I'm gonna have to get ready
again later today and I don't want to
cake so much makeup on top of each other
so there's like my natural like just you
know there might be a what's up anyway
that's my explanation I want to go back
up on the bus okay let's go fold out of
my place and at this exact moment my
daughter ran out for my pre plane to
America phone so now I'm refilling it
you can't catch a break right now but
nope not gonna focus on it because it's
a beautiful sunny day and I'm gonna have
a wonderful day I'm sending out positive
vibes and they shall be returned smiles
rainbows unicorns happiness I'm gonna
find such awesome stuff in forever 21
I'm not gonna spend that much money I'm
gonna come back and my vlogs emigrate

working in like one second one second so
I just walked into a store and saw a
million things I like to look ya'll I'm
gonna be so fabulous buy this fabulous
stuff and like the girl was like hi and
she was it kind of like you know what
are you doing here like you HOT belong
here whatever I took the price for one
thing goes 300 awesome like I peace I
will have you know that I had a great
shopping trip and I found wonderful
things and I'm very content about it so
raw positivity and the time is 2:30 so
think about leave the festival like 5:30
six six ish so I'm gonna go home first I
was like I went to poet late but then
I'm like you have so much food at home
one cook that ish so go home make myself
a wrap to my blog do some work and I had
this festival and I feel like recently
be doing a lot of leisure things and
like maybe I think I'm doing a lot of
leisure things because I still work
everyday this is what people mean by
balance it's weird
also I still don't have a pencil and I
couldn't find a single pencil anywhere
so imma tell Sarah to bring me a pencil
it is so hot so he should know about me
even though I'm hot I still don't like
AC like I just don't like AC like makes
me feel weird messes up my senses and I
should ally what'd you say so I'm gonna
go cook myself something in my sports
bar right now so I'm not about to do
cooking with Lily in my sports bra
because you won't see a whole lot of
jelly that wasn't in the recipe what am
i doing
so I am getting ready for this music
festival and feel like no matter how
many colors I have this palette I'm
gonna still use the same one every
single time because I don't know how to
do anything different
I found this conversation with Anisha as
well should the same thing I use the
exact same thing I do the exact same
makeup look every time I need some like
Bethany motifs and Michelle Phan some
effing like beauty gurus to teach me how
to do things
now I'm gonna do my going-out look so I
got put eyeliner on but all these ition
a little bit different for my morning
look not that you'd give any type of F
ladies can I get an amen
every time doing your eyeliner there's a
little string ease at the end of the
island
f self everything all my god dumped by
the hand emoji so I'm done my makeup
this is what it looks like hey I'm
wearing clothes that I bought today I
bought two tank tops they have 50 of
these at home about these like this cool
plat 50 of them at home but it's like a
nice material I also bought these like
