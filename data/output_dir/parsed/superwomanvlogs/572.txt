good morning one love what up tank top
reference good morning it is Saturday it
is a hot day between the a/c on and so
hot hum up would be so happy to us here
I'm swipe and not our coming over to
have some brunch so it's making some
avocado post or some ish I'm very
excited about all I'm just cleaning the
place a little bit today I got that and
then I want to catch up on work cuz
yesterday I didn't do a lot of work and
I want to earn my rejuvenation Sunday
tomorrow so this is going on
I got a few self tapes to do and I got a
few demos to do and a lot of other stuff
to do but I feel like that's just
everyday assume that happens every day
now seen you figure out what to do at
these damn cords I hate the look of
cords and like you're supposed to be
able to wire it through this thing so
that you don't have messy cords but like
there's a screw blocking and then like
it's not something I have to do before I
assemble because that makes no sense
anyways that's my dilemma right now
let's take out the garbage
alright yesterday's card was patients
take patients down see what we got today
today we got nature whoo it's all green
nature it's time to unless your inner
hippie and step outside of that man-made
box I like where this is going take a
walk in the woods smell those flowers
hug some trees you might think you're
being ironic like a look at me I'm being
all tree hugger II and stuff but to find
that even then those trees will have you
back trees come from a time before irony
and their earnestness is impervious to
our jaded humor if that doesn't make you
want to hug them even more well I guess
you're a robot
I like that be one with nature maybe
we'll spend some time outside on the
balcony that's kind of close to nature
right I'm gonna put this on the fridge a
lot of you haven't asked me where I got
these cards from it's actually a gift
from one of you lovelies I don't
remember exactly where it was somewhere
in the world where I performed one of
you lovelies gave me these 50
affirmation cards and I thought I would
share it with you as much as I can I
want to say everyday but we know I'm out
of this apartment everyday so trying to
do this with one hand very difficult
yeah hold on there we go I did it we
need some oatmeal now ice why Cannot I
was talking a bit of traffic but
everything's going swell I didn't take
out the garbage wasn't thoughtful just
kind of pressed it down like an adult
you can fit more stuff in it you know
come on I wish this happened every
Saturday look it says watermelon gutter
not just like brought like break it in a
ziplock bag get on the cooking happening
all right
someone feed me grapes there's been a
turn of events since we last logged
which is all 60 seconds 60 seconds and
nada and no bleeding from her fingers
any water all at the same time you do
that an unboxing video

just like orchestrated this I'm a genius
I'm like all when I clean I will check
it like have the music follow me it is
less clean because I got and someone's
coming over to check my closet in a
little bit you know I'm not gonna lie
since I've moved on my own like my
ability to clean things it's on fleek
you're getting you better clean all
along but with my mom there I was like
Matt Damon cuz like I clean things so
quickly and so well I feel I made toot
my own horn
Matt Matt for a second kind of just
rearranged my hat's I've so many hats

here there love Tang right here ignore
that little thing right there but uh
basically project I've coming up a
stylist does say obsessed Alden for the
MTV Movie Awards her name is Sarah

the way she's coming out to check out
some clothes in my closet so I just
fixed it up a little bit and now I'm

talking about how important it is when
you do what we do to watch movies and TV
and I'm not making me excuse up to
studies before it really helps with
script writing so I've never heard
someone else said that say that but he
also was like yeah I watch movies
because then I can think of ideas for my
scripts for videos and I was like yes
when I haven't wrote like a road block
creative road block I do the same thing
but I'm mostly just feeling some type of
way because this morning I was like I
think it's so much work done do this and
then I took at that point to movies but
it's okay because when we come back
