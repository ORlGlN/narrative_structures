person you know I can't do this
you
my name is Lilly Singh and that's me
knocked out life absolutely kicked my
butt I was depressed I lost friends I
had no goals no job I had no spark
I had no fight left in me I honestly
thought it was all over and then
something changed
come on
come on and get up
get up Willie get up there you go come
on the car
keep going you can do this job
there you go
I decided that it wasn't over I decided
I could do it
I could fight back I just had to be a
boss
magazines once to overcharge
corpses
really is
I want to teach you what I've learned
because to be a boss you don't just
survive life you conquer it
let's overcome obstacles commit to
yourself
hustle aim high and make mistakes F
protocol mold your failures into
successes
trust your heart and
use your power it's never too late to
fight for your life even if it's against
your own shadow
because the greatest obstacle you will
ever face is you
Wow
