What up everyone?
It's your girl, Superwoman.
And it is the return
Manjeet and Paramjeet.
I asked, "What do you wanna
see my parents react to?"
And so many of you said, "Cardi B."
And so many of you said. "Nicki Minaj."
So, I was like, "Let me do a
song that combines them both."
♪ Motorsport but that thing
in sport mode skrrt skrrt ♪
You know that Motorsport song
that goes something like,
♪ I'm with a couple bad
chicks that'll rip the party ♪
