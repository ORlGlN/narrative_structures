- I'd like to thank God for Spanx,
screen protectors, and Selena Gomez.
(horse hooves clopping)
(horse neighs)
What up, everyone?
It's your girl, Superwoman,
and never before have my
parents reacted to Selena Gomez.
Why?
Because I adore her and
if my parents say anything
to make fun of her, I will die.
Sometimes I wish I could just
like, control what they say.
But because Selena's
new music is so iconic,
I've decided to change my mind.
So please enjoy my parents reacting
to Fetish by Selena Gomez.
Wuddup, t-shirt reference?
