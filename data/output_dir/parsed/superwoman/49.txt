- If your friend sent you this video
to watch, there's a reason.
(hoofbeats)
(whoosh)
What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman,
and since the beginning of
time y'all have been asking me
to do the video "Types Of
Guys In Relationships".
And every single time, I've ignored you.
Why?
Because I can't write about
things I don't know about, okay.
It's been since forever
since I dated someone.
Like honestly, my most recent boyfriend?
He bought me an iPod
Shuffle for my birthday.
But my friends date people, thus,
Types Of Guys Your BFF Dates.
So grab your BFF, grab some popcorn,
grab a booty 'cause it feels
noice, and get ready to relate.
Number one, the Flaming Hot Cheeto.
Now this is the guy your BFF dates
that is hot as hell, okay.
I'm talking mus-cles,
chiseled jaw, boy band charm,
but has the IQ of a Cheeto.
Beyond good looks, there's
just nothing there.
So, Alex, what do you do?
- I chill.
Do my thing.
- Do your thing.
And, and what is your thing?
- Pfffft.
Spend time with Lauren.
- (sighs) Does that pay well?
- Hmm?
- It, it was a joke.
- Who's there?
No wait, you say knock knock.
- You get me water?
And here's the most shocking part, right.
Usually when you ask this dumb person,
"Like yo, what do you do for a living?"
You cannot even fathom their response,
you're just like hoe, how?
I mean your job.
Like, what is your job?
- Oh, I'm a financial planner.
- I'm sorry, what?
- Pfffft.
Financial means money.
I help people decide what
to do with their money.
Excuse me, I can't decide what to get,
'cause there's no pictures in this menu.
You know what?
I'll just have the chicken par mesian.
- Parmesan.
- Bless you.
- Then when you talk
to your girl, just like
"Yo girl, what, honestly what
the eff is happening here?"
She's gonna respond with some trash like--
- I just love his personality.
- "I just love his personality!"
Gah, you love his personality
when he ain't wearin' a shirt, get real.
But you know, I can't even
hate it, I'm just jealous.
Girl, live your life.
Number two, the potential queen.
So you're meeting your best friend's
boyfriend for the first time,
and something just seems a likkle bit off.
So you go through the
following thought process.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
- Same.
Uh, by the way, your hair looks great.
- Thank you!
Ah, a man who appreciates
the little details.
- Hi there, could I get um, a Cosmo?
- Same.
- See, that's nice.
I love when a dude is secure
enough to order a girly drink.
So, Alex, what kind of music are you into?
- A little bit of everything,
but loving Fifth Harmony.
- Oh. That's really openminded.
But also what?
- And also, Alex loves football.
He's obsessed.
- Oh, okay.
There we go, that's like a
stereotypical dude thing.
- Seahawks?
Yasss.
- Wait... was that yes, or yas?
- Yas.
- Spell it.
- Y...
(suspenseful music)
A, S.
Yas.
- Yas.
- Girl, he gay.
My friend's just like,
"He's not gay, okay,
"he's just sweet and
understanding and sensitive and...
"holy crap, he's gay."
- Number three, the waste man.
Now this is the dude your
best friend dates, that you've
probably already heard about
through the grapevine, okay.
Or you probably even met him before
when he was dating one
of your other friends,
or he's even accidentally
hit on you once before.
Or he just has that goddamn smile
where you wanna knock his teeth out
because he's definitely a player.
So, how long have you two been dating?
- One month, ah, three months.
- Three months.
- Mm-hmm.
And where did you meet?
- My ex's birthday party.
Yeah.
- They were having problems.
- She had trust issues.
- Right.
(soft digital clicking sounds)
-  You guys ready to order?
- Well hello, Jennifer.
What a unique name, is that Irish?
- Jennifer is a unique name, really?
- Oh, and that smile, wow.
- Jennifer Lawrence.
Hudson.
Aniston.
- You have Insta?
- Lopez, Jennifer Lopez.
No?
No?
Here's the thing about the player, right,
he's also somehow a
hypnotist, because your girl
is just blind to everything
that's happening.
Like homegirl stared at the eclipse
without those special
glasses, now you need to like,
spell it out for her in braille.
She'll say things like
"He's just being social and polite, okay?"
Yeah, yeah he's being
polite with his penis, girl.
Wake up.
Number four, the catch.
All the annoying guys your
best friend could date,
this one is quite possibly
the most annoying.
Why? Because he's wonderful.
- And for our anniversary,
he planned a surprise trip to Hawaii.
It was so romantic.
- Hawaii?
- (sighs) She's too kind.
And enough about us.
Tell us about you, Lilly?
- I've never been to Hawaii.
(phone ringtone)
Oh, aw, I'm so sorry, this is so rude.
It's Kevin.
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- Um, I have to take
this, but I'll be back.
Excuse me, excuse me, hey buddy!
- Kevin is the child that Alex sponsors.
- What?!
- Yeah, he saved his life.
- Really?!
- And he just
adopted a dog for him!
- Heh.
- The dog only has three legs,
but Alex believes in him.
- Hmm.
- He's also really good in bed.
- What?!
- I said this bread,
it's really good bread.
(sighs)
He's also really good in bed.
- Dammit!
Like where did you find this perfect man,
and how can I obtain one?
No straight up, because, you
know, just those rare moments
where you're just like "This guy
"is too good for my trash friend", okay.
I know that sounds
mean, but let's be real.
Some of your friends are trash.
I knew this one girl, she was a jerk.
She was such a jerk!
She used to drive past the speaker
and the first window at
a drive through, okay.
And then just take whatever
paid for meal was provided.
Just like "Oh, thank
you, this is my order."
Hoe, that's not your order.
And I'm just like, how girls like that
get sweet guys like this?
You know, hold up, just sec.
Hello, Karma?
Yeah, where you at?
You want me to drop a pin?
Number five, the quirk!
So this dude seems pretty normal and nice,
and you're like "Holy hell, did my girl
actually find a decent
human being, like congrats!"
But then.
So then I said, "It
takes one to know one."
(loud, grating laugh)
- You, you take one, and
if you don't take it,
you don't know it!
(wheezing and cackling)
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, alright. (sighs)
Can we have the check?
- They have some effin'
weird tendency or quirk
that your friend can't see
but is driving you insane.
- This was so much fun, we
should definitely do it again.
- Mm-hmm!
- Yeah, for sure, let
us know your se-zual.
- My what?
- Your se-zual.
- Your se-sual.
- Oh, my schedule.
- Yeah, that's what I said, se-zual.
- No, that's what I said.
- But me too.
- You guys are saying the same thing.
- How are we saying the same thing?
- Sezual.
- It's sk-edge-ual
- Sezual.
- Skedgeual.
- Sezual.
Schedule.
- That's what I said.
- Anyways, you know what
the best kind of guy
your friend can date is?
The one that has a single hot brother
who has low self esteem,
that I can come scoop up.
Sign me up, hoe.
Speaking of sign up, don't go anywhere!
