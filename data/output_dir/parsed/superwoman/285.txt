of this team, they leave.
Ok, you know what happened?
I know this One Direction very well, ok,
because they call me on mobile.
They say, "Hello, when our brown man left,
"We need another sexy brown man."
They say they need a
sexy (foreign language).
I say, "No, no thank you,
I am not One Direction.
"I am solo actor."
- I heard a lot about
this One Direction, yes.
I wish Lilly's room was One Direction.
- That's why they make the
song, they really mad at me.
They thinking I'm trying
to drag them down.
No, my friends, no, I still support, ok?
- But Lilly's room look like
a map that was set on fire.

Forty direction!
