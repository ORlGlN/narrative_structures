- Do you ever stop what you're doing
in the middle of the day
and just think, I'm a moron.
What up, everyone, it's
your girl, Super Woman.
And I've been through
years and years of school
but I still feel like I
don't know how to function
like a proper human
being in the real world.
Like every once in awhile, I have no idea
how to do a simple task.
Like I literally just walk
past my degree on the wall
and I'm just wondering like how the eff
do I still get lost in
Ikea every damn time?
And how can I never remember
where I park my car?
And I never have enough Icloud storage.
Mostly because I don't know what that is.
That's because sometimes, aka
very likely, aka like Monday
to Friday, school teaches
kids useless things.
I'm just saying, school should prepare you
for real world struggles.
Number One, Mathematics.
I'm lost in a strange
place and my phone is dead,
what do I do?
Recite your nine times
tables said no one ever.
Let's just be real, most of
the math you learn in school
is completely useless in everyday life.
Today we're gonna learn how to measure
the circumference of a circle.
The diameter of a circle.
The radius of the trigonometry.
The length of this side of
this triangle, the hypotenuse.
Math is also going to include letters now.
Okay, math is now pretty little letters.
Fall for A.
Parabola.
Two parabolas, parabola, two parabolas.
Acute angles.
- Aww, cute.
- Trapezoids.
- Eh!
- And the equation of
this hexagon cole sign
parallelogram tangent isosceles.
Any questions?
And because school fills your head
with all these complex
equations when it comes
to simple everyday math,
you're an idiot box.
That was so good.
I need to like unbutton my pants.
Oh thank you.
Oh actually can we split the bill?
- No sorry, not for parties over two.
- Oh.
- Bust out your calculators everybody.
Who got the steak?
- Depends, how much was it again?
- What do you mean how much was it?
Doesn't matter how much,
did you get the steak
or did you not get the steak?
- I honestly think it's
just like $30 each.
- Yo, I didn't drink.
Both of you did.
- Also, yeah, you got guac on the side.
- Guac isn't extra.
- Guac is always extra, shut your mouth
- Does it include tip yet?
- No.
So we have to tip individually.
Let's just tip individually.
Cash, credit card, what are you doing--
- Let's just call it 20 bucks each.
- All right, but this includes gratuity.
- Okay, okay, I loved that movie.
- That's Ratatouille,
ho, this is gratuity.
Boy, you stupid.
- Okay, we're like $80 short.
- How?
- Because of the tax.
- What the hell is tax?
- Hold up, I didn't carry the one.
- What's the standard, is it 13%?
- Plus it, divided by two--
- Can we get some graph
paper, just can we?
If I had a dollar for
every time my friends and I
could not figure out the
division of the bill,
I would have enough money to
just pay for the whole meal.
Because me stupid.
Number two: foreign languages.
Growing up in Canada,
I had to learn French.
(speaks foreign language)
So for nine years of
my life, I had to learn
this as a second language.
So tell me why the
biggest language barrier
I have ever faced while
traveling is in France
because I had no idea what
the F anyone was saying.
Why you ask?
Because ...
(speaks foreign language)
Welcome to your first day of French class.
Today we're going to learn
all about pizza toppings.
How to conjugate the verb to jump.
(speaks foreign language)
Today's lesson, circus terms.
(speaks foreign language)
(speaks foreign language)
No no.
(speaks foreign language)
(speaks foreign language)
(speaks foreign language)
- How do you say, I need help?
- You know what they
should teach you in school?
How to understand foreign languages
you will see in your daily life.
- Wait, can you park here?
- It says I can park here
between noon and three.
- Okay, so you're good.
- Oh wait, but it also
says not on Mondays.
And on days that have a T in it.
- Think you're good.
- Also not during street cleaning
or during a quarter moon.
- I think you're good.
- And by permit only at 5 p.m.
- We're good.
- And I think it's a tow
away zone on Saturdays.
- We're still good.
- Okay, dope.
Oh no wait, forgot my phone.
What the F?
Reading parking signs 101.
I'm just saying, this the
type of education we need.
(speaks foreign language)
Worksheets.
You don't know what
frustration or inner turmoil is
in life unless you've had to cut out
those geometric paper shapes
and glue them together
to make 3D shapes.
You know exactly what
the F I'm talking about
with the effin' tabs and
the effin' gluestick.
I just can't, I'm sweating,
I'm literally sweating
just thinking about it.
In today's day and age that
whole process makes no sense.
All right, students, now
today I want you to cut out
these shapes and then
glue these shapes together
to make 3D shapes.
It's important you learn how to do this
because 3D printers will never exist.
And then I want you to answer
questions about the shapes.
- What if I already know how
many sides are on a cube?
- Make the cube.
- I can literally just
count the sides of the cube
without building it.
- Make the cube.
- I'm done with my sphere.
- Hey, make the cube.
Instead of giving me worksheets
full of mindless work,
teach me how to work
with sheets in real life.
(upbeat music)
(screams)
Number four, dress codes.
Now I'm gonna be straight up.
The only dress code I had
in my school growing up
was no gang signs.
Yeah, that should put a lot
of things in context for you.
But today dress codes in schools
are absolutely ridiculous
and not at all a good reflection of what
the real world is.
Class as you can see,
this young lady's skirt
is one inch too short
and I'm not woke enough
to realize this dress code
is sexist, so, go home.
Tuck in that shirt, young man.
Pull up those pants,
sir, this isn't a yolo.
Hey, no hats.
Looks like your top is one
centimeter above your mid drift.
We don't want the male students
to lose focus, now do we?
Schools you have failed as educators
if you drill a dress code
into your students' minds
and then they graduate
and after they graduate
they get invited to events.
And they still don't know what the F
is appropriate attire to wear.
Hey, so what's the dress
code for the event tonight?
-  Business casual.
- Like a pant suit?
-  Nope,
just nice and casual.
- Like jeans?
-  No, more business casual.
I'll see you there!
- K.
Business casual.
Hello, I'm business casual.
Oh, hey, hi me?
I'm business casual.
What's up?
Biz cas.
Goodday, sir, my name is business casual.
That's what they should teach in school.
Okay, I don't give an F
what to wear in math class.
Tell me what to wear to a wedding.
To a meeting, to a social,
also, what the F is a social?
Since when is social a noun?
First of all, what, what, what?
But real talk, can I
just be real with you.
I know how school feels.
Everyone going back to school.
It is true, a lot of the specific things
you learn in school, you will
never ever use in your life.
But hear me when I say, you
will use the time management,
social skills, the work ethic skills.
All the life skills
you learn through being
in that environment, you will learn.
So you know what?
Tough it out, figure out the
God damn hypotenuse, okay?
I promise it'll be worth it one day.
Kill it, hustle hard.
Oh you you, stop stop,
you watching right now.
Before you go anywhere,
don't even think about,
thumbs up the video, don't even.
If you wanna watch more
videos like this one,
right over there, my daily vlog channel
behind the scenes all that
stuff right over there.
Make sure you subscribe
'cause I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday

One love, super woman,
that is a wrap and zoop!
