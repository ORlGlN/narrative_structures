(music plays from computer)
♫ Talk back to me,
♫ Now take it easy
♫ Talk back to me, now take it easy
♫ Do you wanna talk back to me?
♫ I will cancel weefee
♫ And leave your Youtube channel
♫ Looking like static TV
♫ I don't know about computers
♫ I am no Bill Gates, but ♫
(laptop slams shut) - Aiiiiiiight.
What up everyone?
It's your girl Superwoman.
As you can see, I've got my channel back,
which means I apologized to my mom
and she said that I have
to apologize publicly
on video as my first video.
So I decided to do that.
In fact, I wanted to
apologize to you so much
that I got you a cake, because
you told me to take it easy.
So, this is my official apology to you.
And I even wrote you a song about it.
So, I hope you can forgive me Paramjeet.
♫ Talk back to you, I take it easy
♫ Talk back to you, I take it easy
♫ Talk back to you, I take it easy
♫ My mom thinks I'm the worse
♫ Imma diss her on this verse
♫ My mom hates when I
wear really baggy pants
♫ She states I'll never find
a boy, I dress like a man
♫ I think she'd really enjoy
♫ If I wasn't such a tomboy
♫ And worse low rise jeans
with a bit of my thong showing
♫ Would you like that
♫ 'Cause then I'd get all the men
♫ And we can sleep together
outside in my brand new tent
♫ You never let me be Barbie
but I'm supposed to find Ken
♫ You taking out space in my brain
♫ Like, you owe me some rent
♫ You say you don't need me
♫ You say that easily
♫ Say that next time you try to play a DVD
♫ Or work the TV or fix the weefee
♫ Ask Siri, I bet she'll
say to go ask Lilly
♫ And yes, it was your girl's tour
♫ A first for me, loved it for me
♫ Not 'cause you gave birth to me
♫ You tryna to take that credit
♫ That don't work for me
♫ It wasn't called a
trip to go get groceries
♫ And you say my brain
backwards and that I'm crazy
♫ Here's a quick question,
was it you who raised me
♫ So your lies don't phase me
♫ I know you don't hate me
♫ Next family party,
girl, you gonna praise me
♫ Like, my daughter's so this,
and my daughter's so that
♫ She got six million sub,
look, they give her gold plaque
♫ And I always support
♫ Yea, you talkin' pure smack
♫ When I was ten, I had
to lie to use MSN chat
♫ I don't know how to
cook, I am no Bobby Flay
♫ But I can work a camera
♫ That's something you can't say
♫ Remember when you took pics
♫ We was on vacay
♫ And you came home with pics
of just some white blank space
♫ Yea, that's some Taylor
Swift shhh right there
♫ Now we got bad blood,
feel a drip right there
♫ Man, I'm only 26, I got mad white hair
♫ It's cause hearing you nag,
it's like a bad nightmare
♫ Why you always compare
me to other kids, huh
♫ 'Cause you don't know
the crap that they did, nah
♫ You mad at me for making
videos with wigs, what
♫ Our neighbor's got a man
♫ She's got a hickey this freakin' big
♫ And I act like royalty,
like what you talkin' about
♫ If I was queen, I wouldn't
have to hear you shout
♫ Be your slaves who don't open our mouths
♫ 'Cause you're like King
Joffery inside this house
♫ Why you always tryna start, huh
♫ You can change your name to
Mamrie, still won't have heart
♫ And Lilly's not bad,
that's not what people think
♫ They see my mom and they're
like Lilly deserves a drink
♫ I'm living in a crazy
house, someone save me
♫ 'Cause until I get
married, I am not amazing
♫ And my mom treats me
like I'm a kid lately
♫ I am a grown woman, I am not your baby
♫ Let's switch it up, yea
♫ We going back to back
♫ I am not your little baby
♫ I am not your little baby, now
♫ Pay my own bills, I'm
about to buy my own house
♫ Say you want me gone, yea,
♫ You say that I should disappear
♫ But when I leave for good, man,
♫ Your eyes gonna be filled with tears
♫ I am not your little baby
♫ I am not your little baby still
♫ Keep watching some Ice Age
♫ 'Cause you really need to chill
♫ You say I caused you trauma
♫ 'Cause I'm always starting drama
♫ Well, call me Will.I.Am
'cause I got it from my mama
♫ Talk back to you, I take it easy
♫ Talk back to you, I take it easy
♫ I said, talk back to you, I take it easy
