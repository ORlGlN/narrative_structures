- Today is soon.
Happy soon day!
Sunday, Monday, soon day.
Big news: I got merch.
Y'all have been asking me since
forever to release new merch
because it's been a minute.
But I have this thing where
if I don't do something I wanna do
to the best of my ability...
I didn't wanna just rush something,
so for a long time I've
been working on merch.
Some quality merch.
And today I am happy to say
not only do I have new merch,
but I have a long-term
sustainable merch plan,
so get used to this.
Shut up and tell us about the merch.
Launching today, Tuesday,
December 19th, right now.
What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?
One.
See the thing about Team Super
is we don't just hope for our dreams,
we hustle for our dreams.
So, now while you hustle for your dreams,
hustle in style with the
official new Team Super sweater.
Hustle harder on the front,
Team Super on the sleeve.
Comes in black with white print
and white with yellow print.
Cue montage.
(hip hop music)
Two.
Protect yourself from
all the negative vibes
and waste mans around with
the official S logo camo tee.
Bam!
Available in black and white.
Cue montage.
(hip hop music)
Three.
What up everyone, it's
your squad Team Super.
It's not a gang sign, it's a love sign.
It's origami with your hands.
The official hand sign tee
AKA I'm wearing it right now.
That was my tata (laughs).
Available in black and this red maroon,
it's like a deep red...
It's pretty, it's pretty.
Cue montage.
(hip hop music)
Woo, okay.
Am I done, nope.
Four.
See, the thing about Team Super
is we don't just survive
life, no, we conquer life.
So, while you're conquering
life like a boss, do it in style
with the official like a
bawse long sleeve shirt.
Available in black and
white, and oh my God,
it's so soft, it's so soft.
Cue montage.
(hip hop music)
Woo, I'm really excited, okay.
That is all the merch, just kidding!
Five.
Yo, where do you live?
Is it sunny?
Don't throw shade, keep in the shade
with this official S logo dad hat.
Goes perfect with your
dad bod or your fit bod
or any bod.
Every bod is fine, we love everyone.
Okay, now that's it.
Just kidding.
Six.
See, here on Team Super
we understand that unity is strength.
In fact, we also understand
that empowered women empower women.
In fact, empowered people empower women.
So, make sure you rep that
with the official girl
love sweater (screams).
Girl love logo on the corner,
stronger together on the sleeves,
available in black and pink (screams).
And I specifically challenge all guys
to buy this sweater, just sayin'.
Also, cue montage.
(hip hop music)
Okay, there you go.
Six new...
We can't end on the devil's
number, just kidding!
Seven.
Just keeps givin' and givin'.
Last but not least, something
I thought I would never sell
because it means so much to me.
But recently I've just been like,
yo, if it's so important to me,
I want to share it with all of you.
I am happy to announce
you can now buy the
official Team Super ring.
I have worn this for like 10 years
and it is so important to me,
but here's the thing:
this is limited edition, limited quant...
There is only a thousand.
I literally bought a thousand
rings and that is all.
Now if there's 12.7 million
of you on this channel alone,
so you can do the math and
add up that percentages.
You best get on it.
Cue montage.
(hip hop music)
That is it, seven items.
All of this goes on sale
right now, this moment,
first come, first served
at lillysingh.com.
So, get to it.
Yo, also I'm just saying,
if you a smart one,
you might wanna follow
@lillysinghfans on Twitter.
I mean, if you like to save
money or whatever, no big deal.
Other than that, make sure
you follow my socials as well.
Just in case y'all do something
crazy like crash the site
and there's delays or updates or whatever.
Follow me on Twitter or
Instastory and all that stuff
and I'll be sure to be updating you.
I'll be sure to be updating
you on the update (laughs)
And I know you probably
have a million questions
like shipping and the
countries and the price.
All the answers are on the
website or in the description,
so click the description
before you comment below like,
what's the merch? (laughs).
Thank you so much for your patience
in regards to me releasing merch.
I just wanna say, whether
you buy my merch or not,
f it, I truly appreciate all your support
where I'm able to even have merch.
So, thank you for your
support, I hope you enjoy.
I can't wait to see
y'all rocking this stuff
'cause you're gonna look so amazing.
I collaborated on these
designs with you in mind.
I was like, this gon' look
so good on your booty.
So, let me see it (laughs).
My next collab of Christmas is coming out
in just a few hours, later
on today, so stay tuned.
I love you so much.
One love Superwoman.
That is a wrap and...
What the hell, cue montage.
