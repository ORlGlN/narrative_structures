 LILLY: The only thing
 people remember
 is how you
 make them feel.
 And I'm nervous that
 if I go up there
 and I don't believe
 what I'm saying
 that I won't make
 people feel
 any type of way.
 And when everyone
 said it was impossible,
 when I wanted to go
 on a world tour,
 every person looked
 at me like,
 "You're out of
 your mind."
 But I would literally
 go to the edge of sanity,
 I would go to exhaustion,
 I would go to the edge
 of the earth
 to succeed at what
 I do.
 The point of this
 is to make people
 feel ten times happier
 than they were
 when they first walked
 into the building.
 And that's what
 I'm gonna do.
Lilly! Lilly! Lilly!

Yo, whaddup?
It is Super Monday,
which means I'm about
to shoot my
new video
and I'm so excited.
Although, to be honest,
I don't really know
what I'm going to make
the video about.
But, like, you guys always
got my back,
so it's all good.
