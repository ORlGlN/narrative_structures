(bells jingling)
- So what did you get up to last night?
- Oh, nothing.
- Cool.
- But did you see what I did with my face?
I said...
Nothing.
That means I did something,
but I just want you to get it outta me.
- God, you're a lotta work.
So, what were you up to last night?
- Oh, me?
Nothing.
- You're doin' it again.
Okay.
(Lilly slurps)
- Oh my god, Lilly, I'm so dying to know
what you did last night.
Please tell me, tell me, tell me.
- Okay, fine.
If you insist.
God, you're so nosy.
I totally went out with a boy.
- Okay, cut to the chase.
Did you wake up with a boy?
- No, I did not wake up with a boy.
But I totally kissed a boy.
- You (beep)?
- No, this is kissing a boy.
- Oh.
(kissing sounds)
- No, that's not--
This is when you actually have sex.
(scoffs)
- Was it a lizzy kiss?
- What do you mean, "was it a lizzy kiss?"
- It's when you stick out your tongue,
and you lick the other person's lips.
Like this.
- No, stop that.
Stop that.
Charlize, stop, we're in public.
- That's how you do it.
Everybody in this room
knows that's how you do it.
- Innocent people, I'm so
sorry enjoy your coffee.
- You're like the only one
that doesn't know a lizzy kiss.
- We just put our lips together like
normal human beings.
God.
- Lame.
- Okay, how is that lame?
- It's not what guys want these days.
- Really?
How do you know what guys want?
(magazines slam)
- Right there.
That's how I know.
'Cause I read all of these.
- How big is your bag?
- This is everything you need to know
about how to please a guy
written by a group of women.
- Makes sense.
- This month alone, there's
14 ways to kiss a guy,
27 ways to style your pubic hair
and 72 ways to drive him wild in bed.
- 72 ways?!
Are you kidding?
I know like three.
Lingerie, sex...
- Pouring hot oatmeal on his nipples...
- Yeah--
What?
How is that number three?
How is that even a number?
(scoffs)
- You've got a lot to learn.
- Twenty new sex tips?
Are you kidding me?
I thought sex involved one tip.
- No, you take a bath together.
But be sure to put four
drops of lavender oil,
three drops of sandalwood and
a drop and a half of olive oil.
You mix it in the water.
- Olive oil?
Wait, guys care about this stuff?
I thought guys liked
Call of Duty and butts.
- Lilly!
Guys know the difference
between essential oils.
- Frig!
Okay no wait, you're going too fast.
Tell me, how should I kiss him tonight?
Should I do the reptile thing?
- Oh my god that's so two issues ago.
- Okay, right.
Obviously, ew.
- Here's what you do.
First, you take three grapes,
and you put them in your mouth.
- Okay, three grapes.
- Yes, do it.
- Right now?
- Yeah.
And then when he kisses
you, you massage his tongue
with the grapes.
- Why wouldn't I just
do this with my tongue?
- What is this 1999?
- No.
- Oh my God.
- No, ew, of course not.
- Step two, you keep your eyes wide open
like you're putting
eye drops in your eyes.
All the time, don't blink.
- Isn't that awkward?
- No, it's great.
- What do I do with the grapes after?
- Well, you squish it on his back.
Guys love that.
- I feel like an idiot.
- No, actually it looks good.
You look like a desirable stripper.
- Really?
- Yeah, so now tell me how're you
gonna make babies with him?
- Okay, well...
I'm gonna go to his
house, take my pants off.
- Mmhmm.
- And then wrap my legs around him,
and have sweet consensual lovemaking.
- No!
Wrong!
Do you wanna end up with 38 cats?
- Just tell me what to do!
- You wrap your legs around an ice bucket
for 22 minutes 'til it's
really nice and numb,
and you can't feel anything.
And then you let him bang you really fast.
And you listen to the "Frozen" soundtrack.
- That makes total sense.
My God, I don't know any of this.
He's never gonna find me attractive.
- Quick!
Three things to rub on his inner thigh.
- Okay, um...
- Too slow.
- Oh, okay, my elbow.
Something like that, okay.
A feather and apple slices.
- Bingo!
Now tell me the 16 best positions.
- 16?!
- Yes.
- Okay, uh, me on top, uh, him on top.
What else?
- Let's ask pink.
- I am not going to ask your
vagina for advice right now.
Oh okay, obviously.
That makes sense.
- She says you're on stilts
and he's on a trampoline.
- Pink would.
- It's great advice.
(iPhone beeps)
- Siri, can you remind me to
pick up Advil on the way home?
- Hey, listen Lilly whatever you do,
make sure you exfoliate with
raw sugar, honey, lime juice.
- Exfoliate where?
- Everywhere.
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.
Guys love it.
- Ouch.
- Yes.
- Seein' Lily again tonight.
Gotta good feeling about it.
- You should get her flowers.
Girls dig that.
- That is a good idea.
(clink)
