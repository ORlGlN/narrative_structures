Don't let the makeup fool you, okay
My face is h*lla pimply
(unicorn sparkles)
Whaddup Everyone, it's your girl Superwoman
Also, hi, hello, my name is Lilly
And I'm one of those fortunate Adults
that has acne
That's right kids,
you know when you have acne and someone says to you
"Don't worry kid, you'll grow out of it"
Please know that there's a chance you'll grow into it
Yay, me!
and when you have acne these are things people will say to you
ALL THE TIME
-"You should just drink more water"
-"Honestly it's because you touch your face alot"
-"Do you...eat alot of greasy food?"
-"Have you ever tried toothpaste and honey?"
-"You mix sugar with honey"
-"Milk and honey"
-"and then heat it up the coconut oil"
-"make sure you smash the flax seeds"
-"with a little bit of fresh rose water:
-Works wonders
-Changed my friends life
-"Just cleared all of her Chakras"
-"There's just new cleanser"
-"Wait, have you tried this new face cream?"
-"It's like an oil free toner"
-"It's a little expensive but it works"
-"It's like a face mask"
-"You can only get it online"
-"I'll send you a link"
-"Honestly you can't even see that pimple"
-"Ugh. My skin is so bad right now too"

What was it?
Toothpaste and what?
Honey? *mumbles* that's good, i'm going to try that
-And that's only if you're around decently polite human beings
Okay, growing up in an Indian family
Things were a lot more straight forward
-Your pimples are very bad
