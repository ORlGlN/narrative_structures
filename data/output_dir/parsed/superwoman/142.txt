when people spell your name right that's
they shall like whatever one's a girl's
soup woman and you know who hates
Christmas January because December then
finished all my money and now poor
January is cuddling up trying to keep
warm trying to warm up a can of soup on
a candle January is stealing Wi-Fi from
the neighbors January is taking a shower
with wet wipes January is Brooke and
that's why I like to be a cheap person
during the holidays and also just in
life in general but sometimes during
Christmas that can be hard
hey oh my god mom would totally love
this yeah but how much do you think it
is what like 50 60 dollars okay no
that's like at least 80 that is way too
expensive that's too much
excuse me uh do to know what what is
that green shirt how much is this first
$14.99 Wow $15 I know uh fourteen
hundred and ninety-nine dollars
I'm sorry what no one thousand four
hundred and ninety-nine dollars I see

tassels you never got the call advanced

yeah okay hold it you ever hear the
price of something and you just implode
inside what you try to remain casual
like yo kill me every day sometimes to
find the best deals I'll do online
shopping and that's great because it
also helps me avoid the chaos of the
mall and to be honest like it helps me
save a lot of money yo I found the Lego
set cousin Nikki wants online for $19.99

bucks

purchases over $50 okay done once you

forks three granola bars a pack of
markers and a loofah Oh Oh total $49.50
oh don't mind it to be responsible when
it comes to Christmas shopping I like to
get creative when it comes to saving
money I consider it an art form if you
pay $10 for something and I pay $8 for
jewel that means that means I'm smarter
than you

to why I need to return this product to
your store I literally don't nail a
single audition but athlete or turn
