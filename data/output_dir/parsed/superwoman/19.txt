- Rent, who is she?
(bells ringing)
(popping)
(twinkling)
What up, everyone, it's
your girl, Superwoman.
And the other day I was
watching TV with my friends,
you know, while I was
waiting for bae to come home.
- Your line into my world?
Angels guard the sun.
- Yeah.
- Aw, he's so cute.
- Damn, he could get it.
- How is Jane still a
virgin with him around?
I would bend bend in
every direction for him.
- Daddy, dad-dy.
- I would do everything to him.
- Take your shirt off, boo, come on.
- His great thing with
Petra are you and me.
-  Are you kidding me?
- Absolutely, I called you.
Wow, hey.
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetheart.
So, you guys enjoying the season so far?
- Mm, it's decent.
- Hmm.
(crunching)
Wait, are there carbs in that?
- The struggles of dating someone too hot.
Oh, wait, you hear that?
It's all the people
saying they can't relate.
Real talk, though, we all know
the struggles of dating someone whack,
or being single as hell.
But, yo, think about it
it's also probably really tough
to date someone that's a little too hot.
I know what you're thinking,
shut up, hear me out.
First of all, when you're
in a relationship, right,
people usually respect it enough
to not just straight up hit on your boo
but as your boo gets hotter,
it becomes more and more okay
for people to say sexual
things about them.
A.K.A
- Damn, he could get it.
- Are you telling me Gigi Hadid's friends
aren't like to her,
"girl, Zayn be looking
like a gourmet snack."
Are you dumb, of course they are.
Like hoe, if you dating
this fine man, okay,
as your friend, I get to objectify him.
These are the rules.
If you dating Billy Bob Joe, have him.
Okay, but if you dating
six foot tall sex bomb men,
we gon' share, okay, because this Monopoly
and those pecs are a community chest.
Second of all, dating someone hot
probably gives you mad trust issues.
I mean, your boo could
be completely faithful,
okay, but that's irrelevant
because you don't trust other people.
Why?
Because you remember
the thirsty hoe you were
the first time you met his fine self.
You tripping because you know
people like you exist out
there (chuckles) in the world.
I cannot with these boys.
- Amen.
- There are certain things
that are just deal breakers, you know?
- Yeah, like if his wife's crazy.
- You mean if you have a wife?
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- I just don't wanna date
anyone from the industry.
I don't wanna a movie star or an actor.
I don't want no one's baby
daddy, the end, no exceptions.
- Preach, girl.
- Straight up.
- Excuse me, ladies,
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Do you know where the restroom is?
(sexy music)
(twinkles)
- Uh, no, but I have a
restroom at my house.
- I just came from set I
just want to freshen up.
- Oh my God, I was just talking
about how much I respect
the film industry.
No, thank you for your service.
- Aw, and it was my turn to
pick up my daughter at school.
- Shut up, I love kids,
show me pictures right now.
- Of course.
- That is so hilarious (giggles).
(drum beating)
(drum beating)
(chuckles)
Hoe, pass me some super glue
for these deal breakers right now.
Just the biggest leech ever (chuffing).
I smell fresh, sexy blood (chhuffing).
Some people are too hot for
your irrelevant requirements.
With a face like that
put a stroller in my hand
and call me step-mom, boy, giddy up.
And because I was such a leech,
now I naturally think
everyone is also a leech.
His assistant.
- Oh, good morning, sir (chuffing).
-  The delivery girl.
- Delivery for you, sir.
(chuffing)
-  His best friend.
- Hey, bro, you been working out?
(chuffing)
- The girl that wrote
this script (chuffing).
So, now I stay tripping, okay,
and I question him all the time,
even if he does nothing wrong.
(playful music)
(loud footsteps)
- Hey, babe.
- Where you been?
- Work, obviously, where else would I be?
- Interesting, because
I called your office
and they said that you weren't there.
- When?
- Six minutes ago.
- Because I was on my way home?
- Mmm, okay, well how come
you didn't share your
Uber status with me then?
- Because I drive myself.
Everyday now for two years.
- Hmm, convenient.
Whose hair's on your shirt?
(clears throat)
So, definitely not mine.
But straight up, that's
as far as that goes
because when you're dating
someone a little too hot,
it's impossible to argue with them.
Like, you can pretend to be mad
but you know that if y'all get in a fight
and he sleeps on the sofa,
really, it's your loss.
So, you try your best
but your hormones simply
will not allow it.
-  Getting tired
of you not trusting me.
- And I'm getting tired of your lies.
-  Oh my God, listen to yourself.
You're being ridiculous.
- Okay, do not speak to me like that,
I swear to God I will--
(sexy music)
I will walk over there and I
will effin' grope your bicep
because you're pissing me off.
- What?
- Yeah, that's right,
don't make me over there
and shove my tongue down
your throat because I will.
- I'm confused, are we fighting?
- Yeah, we're fighting, okay.
You're so dumb you and your stupid
toned perfect abs, yeah,
I will totally come over
there and lick them.
- Lilly, you are really
upsetting me right now.
- Oh, yeah, you're so
mad, take your shirt off.
I bet you can't take your shirt off.
(chuffing)
♪ But my brain keeps telling me no ♪
♪ But my vajayjay's telling me yes ♪
Is that a song?
Did I just make that--
♪ But my brain keeps telling me no ♪
♪ My vajajay's saying yeah ♪
Am I John Legend?
What up, previous collab reference?
Here's the thing, right,
when you're dating someone really hot,
you probably subconsciously defend them
even when they do act whack.
You just like that velvet
rope in a museum, just like,
"do not come for the art" (chuckles).
I think Justin forgot our anniversary.
- Rude, you need to dump him.
- Okay, calm down, he's such a great guy.
- How long have you been
waiting for that text back?
- Four hours.
But give him a break he's going
through a really tough time.
- Why?
- Okay, well first of all,
he ordered a pizza yesterday
and they accidentally put pineapple on it.
That's a lot.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, and he's just had
a really rough childhood.
When he was growing up, his
aunt had a gluten allergy
and it was really tough on
him, so, back off, okay?
Like, girl, what you out here
trying to suggest right now?
Don't be out here trying to take away
the one good thing I have
with your uncalled for common sense.
You best be a good friend
and tell me to shut the f up
because I done won the
jackpot, girl, stop it.
Because we're gonna live
happily every after, okay?
(chuffing)
Wait, no wait, stop stop.
That needs to stop moving, do not, do not.
You know when this video ends,
I'm gonna have to stop pretending
that I have a hot boyfriend.
Stop, do not, Justin, Justin!
Do not cut to the end.
(booms)
