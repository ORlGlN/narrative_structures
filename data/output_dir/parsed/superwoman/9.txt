(shimmering sound and horse whinnying)
- Okay mom, I'll see you next week.
- Oi, Lily.
What happened to your neck, huh?
(ominous music)
-  Uh, say you fell.
No, wait, but then she'll say-
- How'd you fall on your neck?
-  Exactly, you moron.
Say it's a rash.
Actually, no, wait.
'Cause then she'll say.
- Hmm, okay.
Let's go to doctor.
-  And
you won't be able to
lie to the doctor.
He went to school and stuff.
- Hello, Lilly.
I said what happened to your neck, huh?
-  Quick,
hurry, think of something.
Okay, uh, you got shot.
Uh, it's a new tattoo.
You're an aspiring dalmatian.
- Uh, I burnt myself with the curler.
- Okay.
Be careful next time.
- Okay.
Uh, I want, like, four bowls of edamame.
I'm so hungry.
- Is that a hickey?
- Did you hook up with Bryan again?
- No, I, uh, I burnt
myself with the curler.
- Oh, that's the worst.
- Yeah, hate when that happens.
(cell phone ringing)
-  Right?
So painful, the worst.
Okay, before you ask, I burnt
myself with a curler, okay?
-  What happened to your chest?
- Oh, I dropped the curler
and I burnt myself.
On my boobs.
-  Ouch.
(phones ringing and office chatter)
- Is that lingerie in your bag?
- Oh, no.
You know what happened?
I, um, burnt myself with a curler
and then I used lace to wrap my hand.
- Ugh, that's so annoying.
- Oh, it's terrible.
(slurping)
(sighing)
I keep waking up sick every
morning and throwing up.
I have no idea why.
I mean, three weeks ago, I did
burn myself with a curler, but...
Hello?
Hi, yeah, I'm not gonna be able
to make it into work today.
Yeah, I burnt myself with a curler.
It's been really painful ever since.
(sizzling)
Mother Fu-
(booming bass)
(playful music)
- Is that a hickey?
- Did you (beep) Bryan again?
(laughing)
- This is 14, take-
This is Scene 4, Take 1.
- You're drunk, go home.
Mother Fucker!
- End, take 1.
(snap)
(beep)
- You thought for a
second you hit me, right?
(laughing)
