- What up, everyone?
It's your girl Superwoman,
and it's story time with Lily!
I thought I would tell
you my childhood stories
through acting them out.
Wait, you know what?
This video's pretty long.
To be continued, boom!
One of the reasons I'm so big on feminism
and empowering women,
especially young girls,
is because growing up, I had
to hear things like this.
- Girls shouldn't whistle.
Girls shouldn't dance at weddings.
Girls shouldn't talk too much.
- So now, I've made it a point
to do all of those things.
Why?
Because when something is unjust,
you don't just repeat the cycle of wrong.
No, you make it right.
So, ahem.
(whistling)
I've had a lot of really
good days in my life.
You know, meeting The
Rock, meeting Selena Gomez,
traveling to some dope countries.
But still, one of the best
days of my life remains.
You got me an N64?
(screaming)
(burping)
N64 is the best system of all time,
closely followed by Super Nintendo.
Do not at me on this, do
not debate me on this.
I will 007, Mario Party,
Banjo Kazooie your blood clot!
On that note, a lot of times,
when people hear the way I talk
or see the way I dress,
they assume I'm trying to
act like somebody else,
and that couldn't be more wrong.
When I talk the way I talk
and dress the way I dress,
I am being completely myself,
and that is because I was born and raised
in a place called Scarborough.
My school was filled with black people
and South Asian people, which means that
everyone knew how to speak Tamil,
everyone knew how to
speak Jamaican Patois.
It was expected of everyone,
and that's what we knew.
Our school dances only played reggae,
dance hall, soka, rap, and hip hop.
So if I didn't act the way I act
and talk the way I talk,
then I'd be acting like someone else.
Ya dig?
You don' know my youth.
Snitches get stitches, ya hear me now?
Speaking of stitches, I've had a few.
In fact, once my head
cracked open on my birthday.
It's my birthday, and I
get some birthday cake!
(screaming)
♫ Happy birthday to Lily
♫ Happy birthday to you!
True story, I was running
up the stairs on my birthday
and I think I got distracted
by cake or something
and I fell and cracked my head open.
My mom fainted in the hospital
because they were stitching up my eyelid.
You see that, you see that right there?
That's why my eyebrows
can never be on fleek.
That, and because I never get them done.
I've also gotten stitches on my hand.
Basically, there was this computer game
named Jill of the Jungle, where this girl,
she would swing on vines in the jungle.
So during recess one day, I was like, yo,
we're playing hide and seek,
I'm gonna hide in this washroom stall,
but I don't want them to see my feet,
so I'm gonna swing on the coat hook,
just like Jill of the Jungle.
Yay!
It went through my hand.
Ow, help me!
Mrs. Parks!
(screaming)
Yeah, I was just hanging there
with my hand through the coat hook.
Boom, the receipts!
Yeah, I got injured a lot as a kid,
but one of the most memorable times
was when I got a new bike,
and I wouldn't admit that
it was too big for me.
So I was riding the bike and I fell
into the bar crotch first, and I was like,
mm, that really hurt.
So I went into the washroom, and:
Mom!
Now, I know what you're thinking, and no,
it wasn't my period, but there
was still blood everywhere.
And at that age, I didn't get
why my mom was so concerned,
and she was outside the
washroom door just like,
"Please, God, make sure she
didn't bruck up her uterus.
"You know I only had kids
so I could have grandkids."
It turned out I just
got a cut in the area.
That's right, you see, normally girls
only have to experience that
pulling down the underwear
and seeing blood once in their life.
But me, nope, twice.
I had a pet cat named Oreo,
and he was my best friend!
And then he ran away.
Your my bestest friend in
the whole, entire world.
No, no!
(crying)
I was so devastated about it,
but his favorite food was Lucky Charms,
so obviously, I knew what to do.
Now we wait.
Spoiler alert, I never found him.
It was fine though.
It was actually extremely painful
and traumatizing, to be honest.
In school, I was an overachiever,
and to be honest, the teacher's pet.
I was even valedictorian in grade eight,
and also very naive.
And I just know we'll be friends forever,
because that's how real life works.
(applause)
A moment of silence for all the friends
we thought we'd have forever.
In grade 11, my family
moved from Scarborough
and to another town,
but I still kept going
to the same high school,
but had nowhere to go after school,
because I couldn't go home.
So, I used to go to my
best friends' house,
and they were two Tamil twins.
So, basically, I was part
raised by a Tamil family,
which is why I'm so
proficient in the language,
and I can pelvic thrust
like my life depends on it.
(Tamil music)
-  Oi, Lily, come down and eat!
- Mummy!
(speaking in Tamil)
Being an overachiever
wasn't just in school.
No, in life in general, it
used to really bother me,
and continues to really bother me
if I don't do a really
good job at something.
Back to that obsessive behavior.
So, even my first job at Harvey's,
which is a fast food restaurant,
even though it was a
crappy job, I was like,
no, I will be the best employee ever.
(heavy electronic music)
Your burger and fries, ma'am.
-  Took you long enough, loser.
- Have a great day!
As I grew up, I had a bunch of jobs,
and they were all kind of crappy.
The worst, though, was when I
worked at a collection agency.
Lord help me!
Hello, I'm calling about
your outstanding payment.
-  Shut the (censored) up!
You (censored) suck my
(censored), you (censored).
- Okay.
Hi, hi, yes, I'm following up on
that outstanding hydro bill, remember me?
-  I'm a
little busy right now.
- Oh, oh my, did you
want me to call you back?
I could call you back in like two minute?
Or, like, five?
I don't mean to be offensive.
How long do you think you need?
I don't wanna assume.
Not to mention the boss
was 100% verbally abusive.
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Are you stupid, are you crazy?
You're wasting my money.
Are you mental?
- Aka, the type of boss that
I will never be in my life.
Yo, shut up, I'm trying to
make a video, you stupid!
I'm just kidding, there's no one here.
I'm all alone!
(laughing)
And that's my childhood in a nutshell.
Of course, except for all
the other dramatic and
really heartbreaking stuff that happened.
But this is a comedy channel.
I'll save that for my
episode with Dr. Phil.

card, get out of here!
Yo, sorry to cut this video in two,
