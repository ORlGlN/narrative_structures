- I will kill you.
- I told you I didn't do it.
- But you're lying.
You were the only one
that was alone that night.
- When?
- When you went to the washroom.
- You think I faked needing to go pee
so I could steal your watch?
- I don't know.
I'm just saying when you
came back downstairs,
your bladder didn't look any different.
- What does that even mean?
- Yeah.
And I know you need the extra
cash for Kevin's birthday.
Oh my god, you know what?
You probably sold it on Craigslist.
- I'm an engineer, okay?
I don't need extra cash.
Kevin and I broke up.
- Okay, so then you
just want to meet Craig.
Makes sense.
- Hi, Kardashians.
I'm looking for my sane friends.
What the hell is going on?
- Lilly's acting crazy and
thinks I stole her watch.
- Wait what?
- Okay I don't think, I know.
- Lilly?
- No yeah.
Erica's my best friend.
She knows me.
I have expert intuition and
I am 2,000% sure about this.
Erica, tell him.
- You stole my best friend's
watch you piece of trash.
- Tell him.
- Oh my god.
- How did it feel?
Did it feel good wrapped
around your evil wrist?
- Oh my god.
Oh my god, do you know what?
I actually even remember you
wearing it the other day.
- I've never even seen your watch, okay?
That's insane.
- I remember it, too.
I remember thinking oh,
Rosco's wearing a watch.
Cool.
- Who even wears watches, okay?
I have a cell phone.
- So do I, but I like
the way it makes me feel.
- She likes the way it makes her feel.
- Yeah, sure I couldn't
always tell the time on it
because it didn't have numbers,
it had those fancy little markings.
But still, it made me feel like a lawyer.
- Yeah.
We feel the defendant guilty as charged.
How dare you disrespect my best friend?
Come on, Lilly.
Let's get out of here.
- Mouth breather.
- Dude, you're completely wrong.
You let me borrow your watch last week.
- Damn it.
- It's okay.
- Are you having a good day?
I hope you're having a good day.
You know how you can
help me have a good day?
