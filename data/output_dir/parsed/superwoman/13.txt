- Hey Lilly can I bug you?
- Just give me a sec.
- What are you doing?
- There's a hole in my
shirt so I'm just fixing it.
There, problem solved.
- Yeah...
Um, can I borrow you outside real quick?
- Is it urgent?
I was just in the middle
of stalking my ex.
- Not urgent but there's
a sale at Target--
- Huh, I'll drive.
-  That's what I thought.
- Sale!
Remind me not to buy those
small bottles of lotion
because I still have so many
left over from that time
we stayed at the Sheraton.
What's this?
- Lilly, have a seat.
- Okay.
What's going on guys?
I thought we were going to Target.
- We're having an intervention.
- I drank that hand sanitizer by accident.
- What, no.
- And also I was googling
prom pics but I made a type.
So that's why when you walked
in there was porn pics.
- Lilly we're having this
intervention because you're cheap.
- What?
I'm not cheap.
- As your teammates and your
friends we feel differently.
Derek, would you like to start?
(clears throat)
- Um, this year you had
my name for Secret Santa
and all I wanted was a new phone case.
- Yeah, and I got you one.
- You got me this.
- Okay, that is a zip and
lock freezer bag, by the way,
so if anything I splurged.
- The other day it took me an
hour to make you a milkshake.
(quirky music)
- I have to eat my cereal
two cheerios at a time.
I mean, a regular size milk
carton is all we're asking for.
- Really?
What's next huh?
We're gonna start buying
bottles of ketchup even though
we have the packets from Mcdonalds?
- Okay, the other day Lilly
took me to Costco for lunch.
- Wait, what's wrong with
buying lunch at Costco?
I actually like their food.
- She didn't buy it.
- Mm, yup, which one was that again?
- For the third time, sweet chili.
- Sweet chili, we'll try one of those.
Grab one, grab one, come on, don't be shy.
-  Mm.
- Oh yeah.
- Let's get going.
- What about that one?
- They're all sweet chili.
- They're all sweet chili.
Are you sure because I feel
like they're different.
-  Mm, mm hmm.
- Now I see, all sweet chili.
- Are you guys gonna
buy something or what?
- I haven't decided if I like it yet.
Maybe one more.
Here you go.
- Okay.
- Just to make sure.
- We're really doing this.
- Why not?
- Why are you carrying that?
- It's free food.
I'm not trying to be wasteful.
- Last week I had a cold and
the Starbucks napkins were
really rough on my nose.
Can't we just get regular tissues?
- I'm sorry your nose is a Kardashian.
Gosh, this guy.
- Last year when I was
booking your world tour,
do you remember what you
said about your flights?
- Yeah, I said we should book
one flight from LA to India
with a whole bunch of stopovers
in different countries but that's smart.
- One time you tried to bargain with
a vending machine at the mall.
- How do you know if you don't try Paul?
- What about that time we went clubbing?
And you made us all go so early.
- But it was ladies free before 11:00.
- Yeah, but you made us go with you.
(club music)
(giggles)
- But did you pay?
- Guys were hitting on me.
- Why didn't you just take the wig off?
You first interviewed me
you asked me if I wanted a
sparkling or still water, remember that?
- Yeah I do.
Exactly, it's like a fancy
restaurant in here, options.
- Right, I said I wanted
sparkling and you gave me
tap water with glitter in it.
- But did it sparkle?
- My poo looked like a
Christmas ornament for weeks.
- That sounds fantastic, you're welcome.
- Listen Lilly, all we're
saying is that maybe
if you weren't so economically cautious,
things would change.
Like maybe you wouldn't be single.
- Excuse me?
Okay, I treated my ex
like a king, by the way.
Do you know how many times
I made him classy dinners?
(quirky music)
Happy anniversary babe.
Oh, my mistake.
There.
Listen guys, I appreciate
the concern but I'm fine.
Trust me, so can we please
just get back to work?
- Fine.
- Sure.
- Thank you.
- The Wi-Fi isn't working.
- Can you call the neighbors please?
- Yeah, to ask them if theirs is working?
- No, ask them for the
new password, obviously.
Oh so you pay for Wi-Fi now?
Me cheap are you kidding me?
Make sure you click my ads,
I want that money though.
Just in case.
Make sure you subscribe

In fact, here's a sneak
peak of my next one.
How to fix any bad day ever.
One love super woman
that is a rap and zoop.
What the eff?
