What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman.
And in case you don't know,
my real name is Lilly Singh,
and today is my birthday.
Thank you so much for all this wishes.
I really, really appreciate it.
But this video is not about me.
365 days ago, I did a campaign
selling rafiki bracelets.
Don't know what I'm talking about?
Don't stress, I got you.
This is what we accomplished together.
(singing in foreign language)
- I am Superwoman.
(singing in foreign language)
- I am Superwoman.
(singing in foreign language)
- Lilly, we miss you so much.
- And we wanted to say thank you.
(singing in foreign language)
- Thank you for helping
me get an education.
- Thank you for believing in my dreams.
(singing in foreign language)
- Thanks to you, I can become a doctor.
- An engineer.
- A neurosurgeon.
(singing in foreign language)

This year, for my birthday,
I so excited to announce
GirlLove rafikis v2.0
in partnership with WE Charity.
Now hold on, hold on,
hold on, don't click away,
I know what you're thinking.
You've probably heard stuff
like this so many times.
And I could make a really long video
telling you a million reasons
why I'm doing this campaign again.
And I could give you
a million more reasons
why you should support it,
but I'm not gonna to do that.
I'm gonna make this short,
simple, and to the point.
These are straight facts.
Each one of these rafikis is
hand-made by a mother in Kenya.
I have met these mothers and
made these rafikis with them.
Number two.
The sale of each rafiki helps
girls in Kenya go to school.
It goes towards school supplies,
uniforms, and school fees.
I've met these girls, and
I've been to their school.
Number three.
I just came back from
Kenya a few weeks ago,
and I designed this new rafiki myself.
I picked the color, which is gold,
these cute little square beads,
it still has a GirlLove pendant on it.
It's slightly longer than
last year's rafiki, why?
Because I wanna make sure our
brothers can also sport it
and spread some GirlLove.
Number four.
This year, in addition to the rafiki,
there's also a combo you can buy
with a really cute GirlLove pin,
because you know I love a cute pin.
Number five.
Last year we shipped to just 43 countries.
This year, we are
shipping to 223 countries
across the world.
And, shipping prices have
been reduced from 25-75%
because I know all you
international homies
wanna support your girl.
And not just your girl, but all the girls.
Life hack.
You and your friends can buy
in bulk and pay shipment once,
if you live in the same place.
Number six.
The more educated girls
are around the world,
the better the world becomes.
And I need to emphasize,
this is not some fairy
tale or my biased opinion,
this is a fact.
Higher education for girls
means less teen pregnancies,
and less child marriages.
Not to mention that educated women
are less likely to get
diseases like HIV and AIDS.
And the list goes on and on and on and on,
but at a very basic
level I guess you could
just frame it as hey,
doesn't every girl deserve the opportunity
to be the best version of herself?
Number seven.
You can wear the rafiki like a bracelet,
like a necklace,
like an anklet,
or like this cool thing.
I just did it right here. (chuckles)
You can get this new rafiki
right now at girllove.com,
and this specific campaign
starts now, today,
and goes until October 11th,
which is Day of the Girl.
My goal is to send even more
girls to school than last year,
sell even more rafikis, and
impact even more stories.
That's literally all I
want for my birthday.
Like, we are so privileged.
I don't need anything else besides knowing
we, together, did something
to give a girl the chance to go to school.
What better thing could
I possibly ask for?
If you were gonna do
anything for my birthday,
or forget my birthday,
just because we should.
If you personally can't
afford a rafiki, I get it.
But you know what you could do?
Share this video, spread this message,
because maybe someone on
your timeline or on your feed
will watch it and maybe
they can buy a rafiki.
So please, please spread the message.
Let people know about the rafiki.
I've been there, I've
seen with my own eyes
and it does make a difference.
And by saying humanity is the
most important team we're on
and we're in this together.
So please, support my new GirlLove rafiki,
and help me spread some GirlLove.
'Til next time, one love Superwoman.
That is a wrap, and zoop.
(upbeat music)
