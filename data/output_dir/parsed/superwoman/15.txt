- First comedy video of 2018.
Give it a thumbs up after you watch it
just in case it's trash.
(unicorn galloping)
What up everyone?
It's your girl Superwoman.
And it's a new year which
means a lot of people
are on that new year,
new me vibe, you know?
Making crazy decisions
likegoing to the gym,
changing their hair,
and the most terrifying,
deciding to get married.
I personally thought marriage
was one of those trends
that we were gonna leave in
2017 with like fidget spinners
and irresponsible vlogging,
but apparently not.
It's here to stay.
Friends, friends everywhere
getting engaged, and if you
think it's not happening
to you, you're wrong okay?
Just check the international
marriage database.
Ring pictures, same-day edits,
captions about marrying
your loyal best friend,
and I'm just like you're
marrying your dog?
Prepare yourself for the weddings of 2018
by expecting the
following types of people.
Number one: painful public speakers.
Now these are the friends and
family members of the couple
but have no public speaking
abilities or experience,
but they up there making the
speech anyways just as if
I just hit puberty damn
damn I just hit puberty.
God damn finally at the tender age of 21.
Okay wait, now before
you think I'm evil, okay,
I'm all for people's friends
and family expressing
their love and pride and all
that stuff for the couple.
That's fine, but I feel
like if your friend
is gonna make a speech at your wedding,
you should at least prep them.
For example, require
them to write it down.
(people chatting)
(microphone feedback)
- Hello everybody.
Uh, Pat, buddy, huh? Uh...
Okay, I'm... I'm Pat's friend.
Hello. Hi.
Pat, you know, Pat's the...
what can I say about Pat?
Pat's the type of guy who everybody
knows the type of guy that Pat is.
Maybe you don't know, but his friend...
I'm Pat's friend. Hello.
Everybody, we all know the
type of guy that Pat is
because Pat's the type of guy you just
on his wedding, you wanna say uh, yeah.
He's like the type of guy
where everybody knows...
You know what type of guy Pat is.
I love you buddy. Cheers.
Like hoe, this is not an essay okay?
You do not need to hit the word count.
I leave that wedding not knowing
a single thing about Pat.
Also, there should be guidelines about
the types of stories
they're allowed to tell.
- Yo, what's good?
Yo let me tell you a funny
story about my boy junkie.
Yo the day he met pretty, right?
They just finished their date or whatever.
And he's like yo I wanna roll one, right?
Like, you know, get high and stuff?
Junkie loves drugs.
That's my boy.
There's a devil sitting there, you know,
smoking a thing and a
sweeter thing walks by.
Junkie goes and gets them digits.
That's my boy right there.
You're my boy.
You know what I'm saying?
So pretty I tell you
you're mad lucky still fam
because this guy, he's fire.
He gets all the gals all the time.
Even today, I saw mad gals on his thing.
You know what I'm saying?
Yo, anytime I ever wanted
anything, Junkie stole it for me.
That's what's up.
All the bridesmaids, holla
at your boy, you know?
What's good, fam?
D-Town represent. My boy.
Alright, Singh.
- Are you dumb?
Are you dumb?
No, are you dumb?
Why are you trying to
make their wedding day
the same day their grandma
had a heart attack?
Are you dumb?
Not to mention that a speech
should be like two minutes max.
Some people are up there forever,
and they don't even realize it.
I'm just like, bruh, the
couple's already divorced.
Sit down.
Number two: the drunk unk.
I'm gonna be honest, I'm
not sure if this is like
a universal thing or just something
that I know because I'm Punjabi.
Like comment below and let me know.
Every wedding has that one drunk uncle
who is sweating profusely that
takes over the entire event.
And sweating is mandatory, okay?
If he ain't sweating,
it's not the drunk unk.
His back needs to look like this.
Like his shirt should look
like the world map, oksy?
Because if it doesn't, then
that's not the drunk unk.
It's probably like his
understudy or something.
Drunk unk is for sure gonna grab
the microphone in the middle of dancing.
(upbeat music)
- Hold up, hold up.
Stop the music, stop the music.
Please, please.
Let me do it. Let me do it. Please.
Hello everybody.
I want to say many happy
return to happy couple.
Johnny...
And Pablo.
You know I want to say Johnny remember
that happy wife equal happy life.
Maybe I'm wrong for doing like this.
I'm sorry.
But in my heart, I feel kid are future.
Thank you.
Johnny...
I am so happy today I am going to
give everybody 50% off sofa, okay?
And one for Mitchell.
Come talk to me.
Okay. Play Justin Bieber.
- Drunk unk is for sure
gonna get pissed off
when the DJ tries to end the night.
- What are you doing, man?
No, just one more.
One more.
No shut up, okay?
Shut up.
One more Justin Bieber.
One more Justin Bieber.
- And drunk unk gonna be
all up on the dance floor
dancing with sexual undertones
but not realizing it.
(upbeat music)
Is it just me or are all uncles
like homosexual when they're drunk?
And from their sexual
movements when they're drunk,
you're like yo I got a lot of questions
about how my cousin was conceived
because clearly the man has no rhythm.
So like, did my aunt have to learn how to
offbeat to get pregnant because I-
Is my cousin adopted?
Number three: the evasive camera guy.
Quite possibly the most annoying
person at a wedding is the
invasive camera guy that takes
his job way too seriously.
In the way 100% of the time.
Blocking your view from the
action 100% of the time.
Yeah you'll have your wedding
video in three months.
100% lying.
Just while you're dancing.
(upbeat music)
while you're eating.
- There she is.
Alright, here we go.
- Thank you.
Okay, thank you so-
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- There it is.
- During the kiss.
- You may now kiss the bride.
(camera clicking)
- Take it easy, okay?
Do you realize that the
moment portrait mode
starts working in low
light you won't have a job?
Number four: water works.
So stupid.
Here's my question.
Have movies like Moana, Coco, Inside Out
not prepared you for the
harsh realities of the world?
Why are there still so many
people crying during weddings?
Like okay, maybe I understand the parents
and the siblings and the
close family et cetera.
But they'll be randos.
Okay I'm talking straight
up wedding set extras
that got invited through like effing
Cajiji and Craigslist and crap, okay.
They're just bawling their eyes out.
And also like what exactly
are you crying about?
They are happily getting married.
You out here acting like
Mufasa just died again.
Like what?
(loud crying)
- There, there.
It's gonna be okay.
- They grow up so fast.
- How do you know the couple?
- Oh, I don't.
I'm just part of the catering.
- There we go.
Keep crying.
- Number five: bitter bridesmaids.
Now it's important to
remember that the wedding
is not just about the bride, okay?
It's about the bridesmaids and
the one job they're there to do.
Support the bride?
Don't be a moron, this isn't Twilight.
The bridesmaids are there to prove
that they are closest to the bride.
Closer than any of the other bridesmaids.
That's right.
It's actually there wedding, okay?
It's about them.
Because every bridesmaid
believes in her heart that yeah
all the rest of y'all hoes
are here for aesthetic but me,
I'm the one true bridesmaid
that is closest to the bride.
For sure they'll be
some sort of competition
in the speeches like yeah well
you know me and the bride,
you remember that time we made out once?
The next girl just be like
yeah, well you know me and
the bride, we've known
each other since grade two.
Shh. You hear that?
All that passive aggressiveness.
As a result of this, you
would think that the bride
is dying of like some
sort of terminal illness
the way all the bridesmaids
are at her beck and call.
- Are you hungry? Have you eaten?
What can I get you?
- You look so beautiful.
Okay, don't worry about anything.
I love you.
- Are you thirsty?
Let me get you water.
- Tell me what you need.
- Are you itchy?
Tell me where.
Just tell me where.
- Straight up bridesmaids
are the only people who post
more pictures about the
wedding than the actual couple.
Like when the hell did y'all
have your own photo shoot?
Just like yo, the bride
is crying with her family.
We've got five minutes.
Who got the best phone?
How do I know this you ask?
Please. Because I've been
that basic hoe bridesmaid.
Real talk though.
Don't be offended by this video
if you are engaged, if you're
married, or whatever else
cause leave getting offended
behind in 2017, okay?
This is all good vibes.
And if you're genuinely
happy about getting married
then I am happy for you and I
wish you nothing but the best.
I hope your wedding hashtag flourishes.
I've actually been considering
marrying my own bae, too.
I know it's crazy but
I've been considering it.
You know what?
First video, I'm gonna show you a picture.
First time I'm gonna show you a picture.
We are so adorable.
Aren't we so cute?
Look at us.
Me and the bae.
Yo yo, not so fast.
Hold on.
Wait, not so fast.
Before I go to the end
card I gotta tell you
if you like my sweater,
my girl love sweater,
what's stronger together on the sleeves,
as well as a whole bunch of other merch,
you can get it at lillysingh.com.
It's available right now and
it's super soft and it's lit.
If you don't believe me, ask Twitter
because if it's on the Internet it's true.
Okay bye.
- Talking about my boy Humble, yo.
Still this guy.
Like 10 years ago I'ma
call myself Humble the Poet
cause that's not a long
hashtag or username.
- Everybody knows.
His friends know, but
maybe you don't know.
Sorry.
He was so absent, let
me tell you one time.
Bringing up a Monopoly deal.
I done him.
He got canceled fam.
(laughter)
I've seen just so many morons do this.
Sorry. Sorry fans.
If you've done this you're so talented.
Drexel, Scarborough.
It's an East Side thing, eh?
Humble the Poet signing out.
I only got two minutes
to fill your cranium
