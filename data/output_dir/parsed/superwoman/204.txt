(horse neighs)
(whooshing)
What up, everyone?
It's your girl, Superwoman.
I legit feel like it's been forever,
forever ever, forever ever, forever ever
since I've done a Parents React video,
and you all been requesting for so long,
so I decided today to react to a video
you have been asking me to react to
since the beginning of time.
I'm talking about, you know
like evolution picture,
when it's like with monkey,
ape, Neanderthal, human,
like since the beginning of that picture,
the sea creature that
neanderthal, this version.
Since then, y'all been requesting this.
So, I hope you enjoy my parents reacting
to Fifth Harmony's Work From Home.
Why am I on my tippy toes?
I could just adjust the tripod.
That calf workout though.
The first time I saw this video,
I knew my parents would have a lot to say.
Check it out.

You know, in my expert
opinion, I think Work From Home

about calling in sick for work.
