(Game of Thrones theme music)
- Oh snap Cersei!
Some of the favorite
lyrics I've ever written,
I'm not gonna lie.
If you liked them give it a thumbs up.
If you wanna check out Kahleesi's rap,
it's right over there, Jon
Snow's rap is in the description.
My India vlog's right over there.
Make sure you subscribe 'cause tomorrow
the White Walker is gonna spit some fire.
One love Superwoman,
that is a wrap and zoop!
