- Raindrop, drop top.
I love it when things say
my name, and match my lips.
What's up everyone, it's
your girl superwoman.
And yesterday I went on my portals
and asked what do you
want to see my parents
reacting to and a whole
bunch of ya'll said,
your parents reacting to Bad and Boujee.
And I was like, "What the F?"
What the F is Bad and Boujee?
Apparently I'm the only
person that doesn't know
that it's like the number one song in the
entire galaxy.
But now that I know it, I'm hella aware,
I'ma pretend that I knew all along, like
"Psh, yo you don't know
what Bad and Boujee is?
Get with the times bra."
And by that I mean, make out with a clock.
Without further adieu, enjoy my parents
reacting to Bad and Boujee, let go,
