-  "I'm not like
the other guys," he said.
"I'm different."
She responds with an innocent smile,
and asks "What are you talking about?"
Suddenly the clouds shift
and reveal a full moon.
Michael starts to twitch
and scream out in pain.
He starts to convulse,
as his hands turn into claws
and his eyes turn yellow.
She begins to scream and run,
but she's to slow to escape the vicious
werewolf that Michael has become.
He's gaining on her,
he's right behind her.
He grabs her, takes out his claws, and...
- Boring!
(class laughing)
- Least scary story ever.
(class laughing)
- C'mon Miss Singh, this
stuff is so fake and lame.
- Fake and lame, huh?
And let me guess, only
real things scare you?
- Nothing scares me (laughing).
(class laughing)
- Oh really, nothing scares you, huh?
Okay.
Let me tell you a different kind of story.
("Thriller" by Michael Jackson)
♫ It's close to midnight
♫ And you're scrollin' through
your phone under the sheets
♫ And now you just might
♫ Stalk your ex to find out who he meets
♫ You try to sleep
♫ But jealousy controls
all of your fingers
♫ You try to leave
♫ But accidentally like
one of his pictures
♫ From last week
♫ It's four AM now
♫ And you're almost done
♫ That 10 page long essay
♫ It's due tomorrow
♫ But I noticed you started it today
♫ You try to save
♫ But now you see that
spinning wheel of death, yeah
♫ You shut it down
♫ Because you think your file autosaved
♫ But it's a blank page
♫ You're feeling frisky
♫ So you grab your phone and start to text
♫ You know it's risky
♫ But you snap a picture of your chest
♫ And then you send
♫ Hopin' that he will
ask to Netflix and chill
♫ He texts you back
♫ And says you might have
sent it to the wrong man
♫ It's from your dad ♫
("Thriller" instrumental music)
Darkness falls across the land,
a class dismissed is close at hand,
puberty crawls in search of teens,
to terrorize your self esteem,
and all the girls, they cry for Zayne,
fearful it won't be the same,
but 1D's fate is coming near,
they'll break apart by next year,
and beware of tuition fees,
thousands of dollars for one degree,
and when you think you've got it all,
you still won't ever find a job,
and if you do, your boss will suck,
you'll slave away for just twelve bucks,
pay insurance and then pay for rent,
Donald Trump might be your president.

♫ 'Cause this is thriller
♫ Thriller night
♫ And soon as you make money
♫ You'll pay taxes your whole life
♫ This is thriller
♫ Thriller night
♫ 'Cause one day you'll get married
♫ And just fight, fight, fight
♫ Thriller
♫ Thriller night
♫ You'll think you've got it all
♫ 'Cause you've got tons of Facebook likes
♫ Thriller
♫ Thriller night
♫ But the coolest kids in school
♫ Usually fail in life
♫ 'Cause this is thriller
♫ Thriller night
♫ You always serve a shake
♫ But soon enough you'll serve a fry
♫ 'Cause this is thriller
♫ Thriller night
♫ And nothing's gonna save you
♫ 'Cause your parents
and teachers were right ♫
