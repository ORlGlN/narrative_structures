- You know, to be honest,
I'm not really sure
if y'all wanted this calab to happen.
(bells jingling)
What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman.
Now when you're under age
there seems to be this
magic around the idea of clubbing,
and to someone who's older
and been there and done that,
let me tell you what
clubbing is really like.
Your night's gonna start off
getting ready with your friends
aka, destroying some persons wash room,
and you see this, is
where the party starts.
♫ I know you like to party
♫ I know you like to party
♫ I know you like to party
♫ I know you like to party
- This stuff is good.
- What is it?
- Boss.
- Oh true.
♫ I know you like to party
♫ I know you like to party
♫ I know you like to party
- Drinks are $15 in this club,
which means you need to be
tipsy before you even get there.
Let me break this math
down for you real quick.
Ladies are free before 11.
So you need to leave at 10:15.
This means you need to
start drinking at 9:15
to give yourself approximately
60 minutes to get tipsy.
Which equals about one
drink ever 15 minutes.
Equaling one sip every three minutes
or one chug every five minutes,
and if you fall behind,
that's disrespectful.
(upbeat bass music)
- Girl, you need to catch up.
Come on now, what are you doing?
- You're right, you're right.
(upbeat bass music)
- Get it girl.
You make yourself a
roadie, jump in an Uber.
In which case your driver
will pretend to be stupid
and act like he doesn't
know that your water
is actually vodka.
(upbeat music)
- Uber for Luie?
Perfect.
- In fact, to insure that
he believes you're innocent,
you'll probably go out of your way
and say some dumb ish like.
Thank god we brought
this water, I am parched.
- Yeah, gotta make sure to
stay hydrated, with water.
H2O.
- So good.
So you roll up to the club and one of
three things is about to happen.
Number one, it's 10:55
but this bouncer's gonna
claim that you're late
and now you need to pay.
- That's $10 each.
- Hold up, $10, whatchu talking about?
It's 10:55.
Ladies free before 11, brah.
- Yeah, we have vaginas brah.
- That's right, and boobs.
- Yeah, kind of.
- On no girl, you good.
- That's that girl love.
- It's past 11.
- Okay whoa, whoa, we
still have five minutes.
What time zone are you living in?
- Yeah, Pacific Standard Time?
You on the islands, brah?
- $10 or leave.
- This guy.
- Catch my clutch.
- Okay.
- You, what's your name, huh?
I'm gonna complain.
- Of course, of course.
- Weird name.
- You need to learn how to check the time.
You know what, in fact.
Let me fill you out a
subscription real quick.
That's the line right there.
What is your name, I'm gonna complain.
Acting like you're gonna
remember any of this tomorrow
when you're hung over.
Girl please.
Going through your notes like, power trip.
When did I agree to go to power?
Number two, there's going to 100% for sure
be some sort of confusion with the list.
- Are you on the guest list?
- Yes, that's why we're
in the guest list line.
This guy.
- Name?
- Lilly, Elisa.
- Elisa and Lilly.
- Are you two twins?
- Okay, whoa, whoa.
Just because we both
have the same skin color,
it doesn't mean we're the same.
- Yeah, we're own own people, okay.
Stop comparing us.
- You're not on the list.
- What you mean we're not on the list?
Check the list again, bruh.
- Yeah check the list, bruh.
- Wait hold on, which list you checking?
- Bottle service list.
- Well it depends, how much is it?
- $400 a bottle.
- Are you dumb?
- Can we get cans?
- Or a large jug?
- Can you guys hurry up?
- Who the, hey don't make
me put you on my list!
- And number three.
You finally cave and
agree to pay $10, when.
- Yo I don't have cash.
- Of for real?
- Yeah can you cover me?
- Yeah, okay.
I mean there's an ATM right there.
- Girl you the best, I'll see you inside.
- Oh, okay.
God damn.
- And here's the thing, right.
When you arrive by the free time,
it's still so early and the club is empty.
They're still setting up the place.
The effin DJ is plugging in
wires and testing the mic.
- Microphone check one, two.
Okay (laughing)
- All right, sorry, excuse me.
Oh you're here.
- oh no.
- Yeah just take it right over there.
- You can't miss it, it's right there.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay this way?
- Over there.
- And now this entire
situation has killed your buzz,
and you need to get tipsy again.
So you're like, okay
for the next 30 minutes
let me just go hard.
Take one, two, okay three rounds of shots,
and then right after,
you will 100% of the time
have this conversation.
Holy crap, I think I'm immune to alcohol.
- I know, it's not hitting me at all.
- You know what it is?
It's probably like we're
mature, and grown out of it.
- You right, cheers to that.
(upbeat techno music)
- I love you man.
Listen, listen, listen.
I'm so happy for your success.
- Thank you.
I'm gonna text my ex now.
- Oh good idea.
- DJs in clubs are ridiculous.
I mean half the time they play music,
but the other half they
ruin your favorite song
by yelling into the microphone.
When it starts it's okay,
because it's like.
- Hey make some noise!
(cheering)
Holla for the weekend!
(cheering)
- But then, ish gets awkward.
- If you getting drunk and
making bad decisions, say ay!
- Oh yeah!
- If you out here trying to
cheat on your man, say ay!
- What?
- If you so crazy that you sleeping with
your best friends man, say ay!
- Ayyyyy!
I mean, I'm just kidding.
- And then of course this.
- You got a $10 bill get your hands up.
- I thought you didn't have $10.
- What?
- Outside I paid for your $10 cover
and now your hands are up,
so I just want some clarification.
- Oh now, it's just the song.
- Put your hands down, girl.
- What?
- Put your hands down.
- Don't be silly.
- No I said put your hands down!
Don't be up in the club with your hands up
pretending you got a $100
bill when you got food stamps
falling out of your pocket, okay.
Not to mention that clubs are so crowded
they get all gross and sweaty.
Yeah trying to get from one
side of the club to the other
is next to impossible.
So you gotta migrate with your crew
and do that thing where
you're holding hands.
Yeah you look like that Christmas wreath
you made in elementary school
for diversity and ish.
Looks a little something like this.
(upbeat techno music)
- Elisa, Elisa!
- Lilly, don't let go!
- I won't let go!
(My Heart Will Go On instrumental)
- All this romance is turning me on.
- Slut Titanic,
and I'm an iceberg, you
know, I'm just take her down.
- You're going to kill her?
- No no man, I'm gonna hook up with her.
Walk over there like, bam!
- Oh you're going to
talk to her with words.
- No no, of course not.
I'm gonna walk over
there, come up behind her,
grind up on her booty while
she's dancing with her friend.
Girls love that.
- The night ends with you
eating some greasy junk food.
I'm gonna marry this pizza.
I'm gonna marry this pizza.
- It's so good I'm about to cry.
- Getting back to your
friends house or a hotel
looking like a hot mess.
(retching)
I'm so sorry.
- Dude your hair is so soft.
- I can't do anything right,
and I can't hold my alcohol,
and every time I try to draw clouds,
they look like croissants.
Yet somehow you manage to do this.
(phone vibrating)
(talking over each other)
- Hey dad, how's it going?
- Hello Lilly, where
the bloody hell you are?
I call you so many time.
- I'm sorry dad.
I can't talk too much right now,
but let me take a minute to sit right here
and tell you what happened, okay.
Basically Elisa's life
got turned upside down.
She spends most of her
days on the playground
chilling, relaxing, relaxing, all cool.
She was playing bball
outside of the school
and she got in a fight.
Her mom got scared and now
she's moving with her
auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.
I'm just trying to calm everyone down.
Listen, I can't talk right now.
I gotta be a good friend.
- Okay, good girl, good night.
- Good night.
I'd like to thank Elisa
for holding my hair.
- It's so soft.
- And Jager bombs for getting
me to where I am right now.
(retching)
- What kind of conditioner do you use?
- Clubbing, never again.
- Yo, we gotta go.
It's ladies free before 11.
- At least that's what you'll
say ever single weekend.
Let's go.
What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman and.
- It's your girl Elisa.
- Are you happy, we did it, we did it.
If you don't know who this is,
check her out, she's wonderful.
Her link is in the description, Elisa.
My last video's right over there.
Our BTS and bloopers are right there.
And yeah, make sure you subscribe,
'cause I make videos
every Monday and Thursday.
Y'all ready?
- Yeah.
-  One love Superwoman.
That is a wrap, and zoop.
