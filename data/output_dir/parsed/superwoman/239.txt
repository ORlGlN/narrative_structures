are you ready to take a trip to unicorn
Island it is the story of how I became a
YouTube creator why I decided to start
making videos how does this beautiful
story of the trials and tribulations
that go through learning how to put on
tor learning how to interact with my
friends I like to describe it as a
growth spurt mentally emotionally and
physically I wanted to travel the world
so I could tell people sometimes life
sucks and you have a decision to be
happy I met thousands of people and
every single time I felt like this is
not a stranger this is someone I've
known forever people will love a trip to
unicorn Island because it tells a story
that everyone can relate to a story
about strength and happiness pick up a
smile on my face already
