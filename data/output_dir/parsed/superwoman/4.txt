- Welcome to therapy, Lilly.
Tell me, what's on your mind?
- Okay.
I just feel like sometimes the
world is against me, you know?
- Why do you say that?
- I mean for starters, me and my
friends never see eye to eye.
I guess, there's a lot of tension there.
- What do you disagree on?
- Everything.
Just the other day, my
friend got mad at me,
because I wanted to stay home and watch
Black Mirror, instead of going out.
Like, I get it's your birthday,
but there's new episodes.
- I see.
- Yeah, and then, she started to go on
this whole rant about every
single thing she's ever
done for me, and I personally
think that's petty.
Yeah, I don't do that, 'kay?
Like, how many times am I gonna have
to hear the story about how
she donated me a kidney?
I get it.
Yeah, I know.
What about last week, when her
car broke down on the highway?
Who did she call?
So, who's really the bad friend?
- Was she at least grateful
when you went to pick her up?
- What?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, I called
her an Uber from my bed.
There's new episodes of Black Mirror.
Aren't you writing this down?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'm gonna show you a series of images.
- Porn?
- And I want you to tell me what you see.
(whimsical orchestral music)
- A terrible piece of art
by a terrible painter
who will likely never make it.
It's pretty bad.
Kinda looks like my sister,
when she got dumped.
Huh, that's funny.
Wait a minute.
That's a picture of me.
Yeah, no.
No, the legs are a dead giveaway.
That, that's me, is that me?
- Interesting.
- What do you think is wrong with me?
Do I have anxiety from
being right all the time?
Or maybe I'm depressed because
of other people's bad choices.
Like, wearing Crocs.
A lot of people do that.
- No, I think, in my professional opinion,
the issue is that
you're a bad person.
- Hmm?
- You're a mean, selfish, arrogant,
self-centered person, who needs to work on
not being such a terrible human.
- Mm-hmm.
So,
is there like a pill for that, or?
(boom)
That awkward moment when
you think something's
wrong with you, but
really, you're just a jerk.

One love Superwoman,
that is a wrap, and zoop!
- Methinks I stole her watch?
- Wait, what?
- Okay, I don't think, I know.
