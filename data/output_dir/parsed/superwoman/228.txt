♫ I love to wake up next to you ♫
- That's right, I'm in your bed with you.
(unicorn trotting and neighing)
What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman!
And real talk, on that real-real,
true story doh,
I don't remember the last time a video
was more requested than this one.
Since the day the song came out,
ya'll have been dying
to see my parent's react
to Zayn Malik's "Pillowtalk".
And I'm gonna be honest, I
didn't do it for a long time
because I didn't know what to do.
I don't know what's
happening in that video.
But then I thought, you know what?
My parents are gonna absolutely nail it
because they always know what's happening.
That's right, all those
nights in high school
when I was out late, they knew
exactly what was happening.
They knew I was at the
library doing a group project.
(laughter)
So without further ado,
I hope you enjoy this
very requested video
of my parent's reacting
to Zayn Malik's "Pillowtalk".

Yo, if you liked this video, real talk,
I know I always say this, but like,
click the thumbs-up if it
made you laugh or smile.
I wanna see how many thumbs-up we can get.
I know I always say this but
this time I'm gonna set a goal.
I wanna see if you can
get 300,000 thumbs-up.
I thought that should be easy,
there's 8 million in our family, 300,000.
And to answer your question, no,
I don't get a million dollars
every time the thumbs-up.
Literally, I just wanna see
