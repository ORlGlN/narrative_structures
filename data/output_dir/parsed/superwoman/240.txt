 What does a
 "YouTuber" mean?
 I'm a weirdo that makes
 videos alone
in my room
and it worked!

WOMAN: She can rap, 
 she can sing,
 she can dance, 
 she can act.
Whaddup, everyone?
It's your girl,
Superwoman.
 I'm gonna take
 you all

 Unicorn Island is
 that state I reach
 when I decide,
"Everything's gonna
be okay"
 and I'm happy
 because life is great.
It's go, go, go
from here.
 Go back, we're gonna pack,
 we're gonna eat,
 then we gotta get
 on a flight.
 That's gonna be
 our life.
 Bangalore, Sydney,
Hong Kong, SoCal,
check 'em out!
 
 Lilly! Lilly!
Lilly! Lilly!
You do not need
anyone
to be happy 
besides yourself!
 When you make people
 leave your show
feeling better about
themselves,
that's a wrap.
 Happiness is the
 only thing
worth fighting for
in your life!
ALL: One, two, three,
unicorn!
Whoo!
