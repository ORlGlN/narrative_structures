("Passionfruit" by Drake)
♫ Listen
♫ Seein' you got ritualistic
♫ Plans in my soul of addiction for now
♫ 'Cause I'm fallin' apart
♫ Yeah tension
♫ Between us just like picket fences
♫ You got issues that
I won't mention for now
♫ 'Cause we're fallin' apart
♫ Passionate from miles away
♫ Passive with the things you say
♫ Passin' up on my old ways
♫ I can't blame you no
♫ No
- I am telling you, you
deserve better than him.
Do not let him treat you
like that! (clicking tongue)
(scoffing) La la la, I'm not listening!
I'm not listening! I'm not listening!
I'm not listening!
(sniffing)
(sniffing)
Can I just get a medium fries please?
("Halo" by Benyonce)
♫ Baby they're tumbling down
♫ I aint never gonna shut you out
Poof poof!
Allo mate!
Aww!
Winter is coming! (laughing)
Hey girl!
Miss you, sending you some love.
Can't wait till the weekend!
(kissing)
♫ Can't stop won't stop moving
♫ It's like I got this music in my mind
♫ Saying it's gonna be all right
♫ 'Cause the players gonna
play play play play play
♫ And the haters gonna
hate hate hate hate hate
♫ Baby I'm just gonna
shake shake shake shake
♫ Shake it off, shake it off
