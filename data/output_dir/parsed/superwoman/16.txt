- Time flies.
(gently chiming bell)
(whoosh)
What up 2018 it's a girl Superwoman,
and what better way of jumping
into the new year than looking
back and reflecting on 2017,
and just being grateful.
We accomplished so much in 2017.
And hold up, hold up wait, I say we
because I understand
that no matter what I do,
it always involves you in some capacity.
Let me explain.
If you know anything about me,
you know I don't like the word luck.
Like anytime I achieve something
or work hard for something,
people say, "You're so lucky."
I go, "No-no-no-no, ex-squeeze me."
I don't believe in lucky,
I work really, really hard
for the things that I have.
But having said that,
I kind of eat my words
because I am lucky because I
do know that there's people
out through the world that
work just as hard as me,
are probably more talented than me,
and don't have the support of you.
So in that sense, I am really
lucky to have your support,
your viewership, your
time, your energy, however,
and in whatever capacity, you support me.
Whether it's a comment or thumbs
up or a passive reviewing,
I am lucky and grateful
to have you so thank you.

no matter what, I'm so
grateful for you to be here.
Thank you for being part of this journey.
I can't wait to see what
we do together in 2018.
I don't really believe in resolutions,
so I don't make like in 2018,
because I do believe that true resolutions
are the ones you make every single day.
The decisions you make daily,
to better yourself and the world,
and I wanna make a lot of those.
What do I wanna do, I wanna work with
even more of my inspirations
and learn from them.
I wanna keep making that
quality content for you
regardless of where I upload it.
I want to step even further
out of my comfort zone.
I wanna encourage you to learn and to grow
and evolve and better the
world in your own unique way.
In conclusion, I am truly
forever in debt to you,
thank you so much, thank you team super,
thank you God for giving
me this amazing life,
and everything I need to conquer it.
Thank you my friends and my family.
Thank you Humble the Poet,
thank you to my team
that work so tirelessly,
thank you to YouTube for this platform,
even though right now
things are questionable,
you still gave me this platform
and I am thankful for it.
Thank you to the universe
for the nature and the trees.
And I just thank you
everything and everyone,
I am pumped for 2018 together.
Forever grateful for you and 2018,
I hope you're ready for Team Super,
'cause it's about to be lit.
Let's make 2018 full of love and art.
