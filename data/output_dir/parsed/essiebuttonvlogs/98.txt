Niagara Falls good morning everyone

I've actually been up since about 6:30
and I've been doing pretty much nothing
since that time anyway we're getting
ready to head out for breakfast I think
we're just gonna go to a place nearby I
just get some breakfast and I just had a
mind blank so that's what we're doing so
just walk into the restaurant and I see
all these pigeons lined up they remind
me of Reggie oh we've made it to the
destination over easy

not joking around every kind of eggs you
could ever want oh my god pancakes

of tea because I haven't had one in
about 72 hours and I'm slightly freaking
out
