good morning from Brooklyn
I'm so happy to be in New York it's
amazing Aslan's just strapping up who's
care yeah cuz I stay once we take loads
of pictures are gonna taste y'all ready
for the relax anyway we're not actually
staying in Brooklyn lovely this aghanim
here and we're gonna go to a store that
basically today's a shopping day in
Brooklyn okay
and the first door is a store that I am
dying to go to called motion a lot of
you will know that this this ring is
from motion and they don't just do
jewelry they do loads of other stuff and
I'm really excited to actually see the
store which is right behind us so we're
gonna go with slight problem classic the
store opens at 12:00 and it is 10:00 in
the morning because we're early birds so
we're gonna try to find some other
places on our list
so I'm sitting in the Starbucks because
nothing open until 12:00 and Lisa came
over and said that she watches our
videos and I'm just gonna give us a
demonstration of something and they
still don't know what it is apparently
this is like it
we've just happened to stumble across
this test Starbucks because they have
like oh that's weird
and then we brew it and then we like
right at it it's just this is the
coolest method ever and so pick out
whichever coffee you want and I can do
I love okay so pick out a coffee
you're the coffee drinker so what what
are you thinking all right
I thought the cow Hawaiian coffee yeah
okay okay so there is water in the thing
and it is hot water and we're gonna be
doing some bubbling or something so yeah
yeah like this just wait just wait so as
you can see this thing is starting to
bubble and it's now it's bubbling quite
a lot so now I guess we pop that thing
down and its really really bubbling
there's like a coffee filter in here so
eventually we're gonna put the coffee in
here i guess i don't know what i'm
talking about but okay i am a bad
vlogger I missed it but all the water
came up here really fast was like linked
and it went up there
now you put the coffee in and you pull
in the coffee
Wow okay so it's been about 90 seconds
and we're gonna stir it again
then we're gonna apparently take it off
the heat and then all the coffee is
gonna actually drop to the bottom
wait for it oh my god doing it
I really still don't know what's going
on but it isn't fascinating
Wow and then all the ground like grinds
Browns yeah they stay at the top oh
that's so cool
Wow I've never seen anything like this
in my entire Oh
and look
so that was like that's for two cups of
coffee that's so much coffee yeah Wow
all right guys so if you ever get to try
this we're having the Hawaii cat I'm
gonna say coffee and it has floral
aromas with notes of caramel just Diesel
nuts and honeydew and they're in these
like really fancy cups as well and
apparently you're supposed to wash it
down with this stuff so I'm just waiting
it to cool down then I'll try it
Aslan's just trying on this freakin
adorable hat with a pom pom on it you
