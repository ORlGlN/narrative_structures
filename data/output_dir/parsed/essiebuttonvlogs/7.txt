Irving want to be in my video ty you
want to be in my video yeah want me to
talk about the cheese boy
how great and over here explain what a
cheese ball is because nobody's gonna
know so a cheese ball is what my mom
makes for Christmas every year
I can eat one myself they're so good
I believe I've never made them myself
but yes I believe it's just a whole
bunch of cheeses mashed together in a
bowl rolled in nuts and you smear it on
a cracker
I made it hardly ever soup this is a
simple operation including it an
electrical saw and some ham
I think the best thing about my family
Christmas is is that you do not have to
get out of your pajamas like literally
no one cares it's amazing okay
Lord Jesus me I guess let this food us
be blessed in Jesus name oh man oh
alright forgot it alright so here we go
we've got some turkey Aslan made some
roasted potatoes but he's upsettingly
they're burnt but they're not they're
gonna be really good I like it Kimmy

bacon and mashed potatoes and the
stuffing is somewhere oh and the gravy
and grandma never stops
well I've eaten a half a can of nachos
and cheese so this is my Christmas
dinner tonight it's just the one piece
of half a piece of Turkey potatoes and
salad because I am stuck this is
significantly more Oh husband has a
little bit everything looks good alright
