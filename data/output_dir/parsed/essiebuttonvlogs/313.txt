today we decided to go to an Amish
market as you do actually freaking huge
there's like how many cars would you
guys say there are there's a good like
four or five thousand yeah like this is
like a big thing we've never been but
apparently this is the 18th Amish well
it's like an Amish sale that goes
towards funding like Amish schools and
stuff like that but we're currently
driving in the middle of a field and
it's really we're looking for a parking
spot so yeah we already saw from this
area fields and fields and field tensor
oh so far we haven't actually I owned a
 any kind of antique old stuff it's
all we got of new things that Mennonite
people are selling just fine but I want
to find the antiques where they do it
yeah I think we're gonna go head back
that way
look at the outfits it's like being
transported back in time it's incredible
okay so we found the kind of more old
junky I'll got John air-conditioning
cover units well I'm not sure cuz this
is maybe an option I'm not sure how it
works by something gonna have to wait
until the auction here comes along oh
can I just make an offer to the to the
seller putting down an English address
double check with yeah yeah I wasn't
spotted a fan earlier and he wants to
bid on it so we're going back there to
see if you can win that fan it's a
vintage fan made in kitchener-waterloo
so you know good mom just found this
ringer washer how does it work my
clothes squeezes all the water yeah it's
like a washer dryer can I go
I haven't had a goat before scared soft
actually isn't it Oh
Thanks what's the goat's names here you
Bonnie here the Mennonite people are
famous for their quilt making and the
quotes actually go for one just sold for
$250 and I think that's actually a low
price for a quilt I mean in the markets
they sell them for you know thousands of
dollars so I suppose it's all hand so
we're walking along like this red stripe
ten looks nice I wonder what's in it and
it's actually a chicken and all sorts of
poultry sale
we've got yourself a big chicken
we got some offensive chickens here
fancy kind of chicken some duck some
quail got two pigeons here okay so we
left the auction thing I was gonna stay
to try an auction for this fan but
everybody wanted to go no no four hours
it would have been a play apartment not
a half now but whatever I feel like I'm
bitter about it haha so now we're in a
different location we're in Stratford
Ontario Justin Bieber's homeland

yeah and Bieber Justin now we're going
to boomers or ma√Ætrise apparently some
of the best poutine you can so don't
know I've never had it

needed to find a toilet and we went off
the school door off this Main Street it
said it was like an entrance to a mall
but we go up all these stairs and where
there's a creepy ass empty hallway
corridor everything was over this is
creepy stuff creepy creepy creepy creepy
you like somebody's about to jump out of
any of these doors that coming
I'm sure I'll be fine here's the poutine
