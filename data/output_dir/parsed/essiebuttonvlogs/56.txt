my guys we I had into LA no sorry that's
wrong so very early in the morning we
are headed to Anaheim VidCon
they three right give me full forces
that has lots of panels and we start off
the day
delicious delicious donuts are they good
green rooms I think that's the technical
lingo you've been here before
what is a green room a green room
actually this room yeah that's true
there is some green hair I don't
actually know why they're called green
rooms but basically it's like a place
where you go chill before you go do
something okay so I can come yeah yeah
if you're on like Jimmy Fallon he has a
great room okay I got it before you go
out where they bet you make sure you can
say that myself basically
ya know so have a tea selection here and
I'm very very pleased to find that they
have a English breakfast see this is
quite rare to find an American who's
mostly Earl Grey is like I like an
English tea but they got the full-blown
inch breakfast I don't think is easy
more expected when you realize that also
bringing over cookies your life
it's literally like 8:00 in the morning
and as one's eating beef jerky in the
morning yes
it's like 8:30 a.m. listen if it's not
okay that was a bad delivery of a joke
we heard last night I was bad valerio
joke horrible but yeah I mean to be fair
it's not that gross because I've had it
done and it could be it ready first
panel started it stays there Bob's there
people we're now behind the scenes we
first shuttle onto the main stage
just finish that panel and it was really
cool actually to meet bugs bugs the
coolest person ever but yeah yeah and
now we're actually getting in a shuttle
I love
okay um oh yeah it was really cool to
see it oh my god honey wasn't it cool
that like everyone was there to actually
take a picture with you I look over and
people were like properly swarming out
of then afterwards you always like at
the front you speak and I don't know
it's just like one over to one of these
Finnish speaking so they come you know
Baskin it is Baskin my own people were
like saying like I have to go get a
picture with a hassle enough um but
anyway we're off now to the next panel
which is actually a pound really excited
about its with Ingrid and a few other
amazing girls and it's on the main stage
so actually kind of nervous so I think
it's being live-streamed hope I don't
say anything stupid but I love writing
these go buddy
and I think it's important
I
like this is what I look like I'm not
opposed to make myself look at different
action because they didn't have like
personal procedures witness
different direction what was it
Sara Lee Shirley what
about what you should be doing to these
these golf buggies are so funny
don't fo'get this is like Mario Kart
whatever so I just got pulled aside by
someone from People magazine and she
asked me if I would do this interview
thing and it's like you know I didn't I
didn't plan for this but I'm excited to
do it she's really cool and she said
that she's been watching my videos for
ages which is always awesome
get married log matters here but this
you're out getting food and yeah look at
this look at this strange situation
wow this guy is doing some sort of
dancing stuff
so I'm just like getting a drink and I
was like do you have powder with you I
was like why what are you telling me
that my face is Chinese like well let's
just put it this way you're going from
dewy to shiny I was like perfect
she takes the piss but she's actually
gonna do it and listen to the advice I
think you don't look like it like
normally like when you just like in this
sort of situation but under lights you
know how lights are really strong I tend
to gray and wet over the last live squad
squad Gang Gang so got the whole squad
here they're all heading through the QA
Emilia and a space QA I wish she had a
phone I would love that so yeah we are
heading across to the location for the
QA and escalator feel like I haven't
been on one of these for a while like I
haven't been on the chief like five or
six days that feels with you know yeah
this is like a QA with a stand in the
air
well Charlie Fox charlie is a brilliant
author writer just general the Q&A is
over people working some pictures as
they and who do we have here Shannon is
whatever you want to call that but yeah
okay squad we have now just better drag
everybody in and say that I think we've
just done you are done
yeah let let's chill out let's relax oh
okay just so you guys kind of understand
the craziness of the scale of it go and
look at this all these people are here
to VidCon it is like it's insane really
is insane
this is Amelia I don't know if you guys
know how you probably seen him before
she's vlogging and we got to food put
some food I got some pizza this is
actually all right it's up to you bad I
stay good obviously making shots Jeunet
like how'd you ever not get mac and
cheese if it's on the menu I'll get it
especially in America yeah they can do
it would you say American mac and cheese
is better than British mac and cheese on
average yeah you you traitor yeah we're
just gonna try and relax cool down
before a big party tonight
right I stays watching some American TV
which we haven't even done that yet well
then we love we love American TV yeah so
we're gonna probably get as much TV as
we can and eat pizza because we are
gonna try and get a hot side before this
party okay go to the make up our
teachers and Ben and now here you two
it's not what is your lens know your
legs wider you got a huge legs seriously
sometimes this place is a bit strange is
there
yeah
beautiful musical bands
I don't think I was quite ready prepared
for this but that is also happening here
tonight very strange
there's a lot of people it's very large
hello hi very large queue for this maker
dude
that rhyme George Wow make a dude very
large cube for the maker do so hopefully
we can figure something out
so we just got home oh oh wow
what a night what a night what a night
feels right feels great
I tired
we are pretty exhausted I was a long day
but you know what I felt like this was
the reason why we came to VidCon right
today hiccups but yeah today was the
best day yeah like you did such a great
job on the women on YouTube okay so you
guys I don't know if just like archive
footage of that but by the time this log
comes up if you can't watch it yeah I
stay Ingrid and you know two girls they
both it's what everybody did such a
great job thank you I was like oh I
don't I feel like I maybe haven't gotten
into this in the vlog but like in person
I've been saying this all night and I
just felt so honored to actually be on
that stage and talk about those things
with all the other women on that panel
and I was I think it went really well
and I think everybody left that panel
being like yes so we actually did just
did something there so I think was
really cool and I think that the people
who came and actually saw it felt like
that too so yeah yeah I mean every
everyone that panel things are kind of
like understand each other as well you
know and everybody had their own point
of view to bring to the table and I
thought yeah as I said to a outsider
today I think whoever picked the people
for the panel did a really good job yeah
yeah that was cool yeah and yeah the
party was pretty cool it's kind of fun I
supposed to see that kind of part of
YouTube because I don't know you watch a
lot of YouTube videos and you end up
saying like all the people in that
bedrooms or whatever
but to actually see them let loose yeah
it's quite good to see like people who
you'd never thought would do like a
freaking snake dance to the beat of
Fetty WAP across the dance floor yeah
like who did that
I wouldn't name an okay so what are we
up to so it's like 3:00 in the morning I
don't even know yeah we're really sleepy
no idea what we're doing in tomorrow all
I know is that I need some sleep you
need some sleep you'll probably be bored
by now so I'll see you tomorrow
chef broccoli work
