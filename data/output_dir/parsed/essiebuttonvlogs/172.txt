greetings everybody it's another day
here in the beautiful Istanbul and we're
here having breakfast in the privado
cafe hi paper box writer and apparently
it's all natural organic stuff and
should be really good if you're under
why I'm looking a little disheveled cuz
I'm going for my bath after breakfast
bath in a massage should be great
so as Donna and I are splitting a
breakfast because look at how much stuff
has come with our breakfast I don't even
know what half of this is if I'm being
honest olives I know that that these
pears could potentially be cheese this
harissa paste some room no probably not
and some bread so let's do this thing
so a little update to the situation we
come back from breakfast back to the
place back to get the jackets because
it's actually quite chilly today and the
girl is they keep some referring to you
started calling us girls the girls are
going off to get their huh mom / massage
experience in the meanwhile I'll
probably just chill out a nearby cafe
read my book what book Who am I reading
I hear you ask let me show you this book
right here nothing to envy an
interesting book about real life in
North Korea very interesting kind of
written by like from a kind of like a
fictional perspective like it's a story
there's one young girl at entropy but it
kind of outlines all the different lives
of not that North Koreans lead which is
nice we've got a great view here I'm
gonna show you this probably at well
yeah the view is pretty sweet everything
else at this point
nervous for this bath um that's it sit
don't worry they'll you know they'll be
in every nothing cry I wasn't really
expecting anyone to be seeing my
downstairs if you know what I'm saying
ladies you know say so should be fun
thanks my kettle Harry
when they say this number was hilly they
weren't joking
he's quite honey yeah they got these
kind of old cool old-school cobblestone
type of my mother I mean I can't imagine
this in the window business just like
insanely dangerous and it's icy whatever
but she was right
so I've dropped off the ladies at the
hammam this is what kind of looks like
on the outside it's a it's attached to
this mosque this mosque used to have the
hammam as part of its complex but then I
kind of got this use and then some guy
converted it and it's called the kill
each other pasta her mom I've got the
time to kill so I think I'm gonna grab a
coffee or something I bought a book so I
could be there probably gonna be a good
hour and a half or so
so just behind the hammam has this cute
little street I want to show you and
it's it's got all these like nice little
coffee shops it's quite nice
just behind the hammam here you've got
like quite a nice little street with a
few cafes shops so I think I'll go grab
a coffee somewhere here so in this place
called him karaköy and it's very nicely
even got some practices of the back bed
so I know this is the place for me and
yeah it's in the karaköy area
apparently the karaköy air is meant to
be kind of a cool trendy sort of place
and it's only seems like it when I was
walking home last night I was kind of
walking through the area and they were
like loads of bars and clubs and there
was like young people so it seemed like
the kind of place where yes
potty so she's out oh my god where do I
begin
oh the other way you got like this wig
lying down hey what's going on there I
don't care yeah that was like memory was
he we lying on your side was a massage
yeah I'm side of the face looks like
Ascot or something anyway there was a
lot of new to be a lot of rubbin in
places yeah honestly that massage was
more like an ass massage it was like
back in have I had a guy a guy in the
sauna therapy Rivia she well she's like
who do you want a guy or girls like guy
good guy there's no other option well
where do the massage happen was in the
main you know in a separate that it was
the bat that blew my mind maybe you like
the lathering the thing that I thought
it was amazing in the Clank of the hard
marble slab is that I feel like I feel
ten years younger

you are coming with me and I'm gonna
surprise you what come on popping into
the hot Sun ticker right here

really happy with that alright she'll
get some lunch or something yes despite
my night Bobby tell you've got a real
place in life I'm not a real place it's
just the place I was having tea yet well
maybe not the exact place cuz I was
pretty deserted but the restaurant next
door to mine that were all fucked up I
just have to say I cannot get over that
Turkish bath like amazing so many suds
I mean having someone in all your nuts
and grannies you know you gotta like
that I didn't hate it
just as you love she brought me straight
over like really shook me like good
strawberry drink for you physically
and then after bad we went in and
changed the towel and then what good is
how we sat the lounge area that we got
taken into the group and she said sit
down lady so we're having lunch at this
place calls him and I think this place
is pretty trendy because they've got
some problems bergna chair chairs
Rainer Canyon on speaker
chairs and just in general it's very
trendy but what did I get so let me show
you here I was really tempted by the
lentils finish soup with pomegranate
reduction but I ended up with the
fattoush in the bush salad and my mom's
getting the chicken pita so we're gonna
split both of those things and I got the
peach tea of course and I'm going to
think I'm gonna try the Turkish coffee
afterwards just because I never have
enough you know I just want to eat
anybody dry everything
great so I started eating I completely
forgot to blog it but I did Instagram it
so this is my fattoush salad looks
amazing and mum and I are splitting
these chicken pita wraps which looks so
good heat right steam a little bit on
the sweet side still good and this is
spicy sausage wrapping it's excellent
you love it I don't think you'll be able
to see but there's a little tiny kitten
over there it's so cute
oh you can't see him oh there he goes
so we're going down it's really
ridiculously busy package again
we heading over to the old side
they're touring
- basically the palace
what is the house with a nice sofas from
the museum and then we're doing sista
this stage grabbing on that dear life
back there
as Lana is taking a picture of all these
pigeons I don't know what's going on
here but there's pigeons everywhere
being fed Oh what is that like why are
they headed to food there oh I think
it's nice oops oh I think oh my God look
at this an automatic kebab cutter this
is something else this is incredible
I've never seen this before
wow that's some high-tech shit okay
after walking about 40 minutes would you
say we finally made it to the silica
cistern and if you want to know some
information I'm going to look right
there constructed in the 6th century
during the reign of memory okay yeah we
did and then there you go
okay so we're under the ground
I hope my camera is okay usually kind of
freaks out but yeah yeah it was a good
system
like kind of eerie down here let's see
oh wow there's fish in this water so
this is water and then there's like all
these columns look at this fish is huge
actually humongous fish Wow kind of
smells weird mom and I are doing a quick
tourist photo just letting you know
Wow we're really looking our best here
this is quite something
okay so just in line and we are going to
here we go going to miss practice
I am sofa what's apparently a mosque and
they hate museum combo and the a little
prayer is going on you can probably that
guy has a good 10 months old unknown
30sec yes he can he is really good
oh wait I think it's aya Sophia that
right is just for you I mean okay so
we've made it in here is this the mosque
I think it's a ma / museum oh it's like
a combo it is a combo yeah it's you in
one yeah I don't think it's a practicing
yeah
actually like a lot bigger than I
thought it was gonna be like I wouldn't
have even have thought that this was
even here which is usually the case
look at that scaffolding okay Toscano
see my life
is a lot of scaffolding as well most
gaveling so yeah here's a little look at
the inside here and a completely
unrelated note I'm so glad I'm going
makeup free today I feel feel great I
can't stop leading with that bath I had
earlier it was like it was the weirdest
and best thing that's ever happened to
me so I'm still feeling quite relaxed
it really wants all that pomegranate
juice not gonna lie but I guess we're
just gonna wander around here and the
ground so we've got the Christian kind
of symbol that I don't know whether this
is seen annasophia or this looks like
the Virgin Mary with Jesus then then you
got obviously of the Muslim iconography
over there as well so it's kind of yeah
speaks of the issue this used to be I
think a mosque first and a church then
back to mas again just pretty
interesting
and they've got a hell of a lot of
scaffolding over here but this to me is
more breast balloting look at the
scaffolding this
how long did this take to put up it's
insane I could not resist another orange
juice I love this orange juice pretty
