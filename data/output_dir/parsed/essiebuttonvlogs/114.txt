good morning everyone that is our final
day in Barcelona and we have already
dropped our luggage off at the luggage
storage place and now we're having a
breakfast at a place called flax and
kale is that right flax and killed we
got a nice healthy breakfast of my
health I mean because chizzes it'll be I
got this avocado on toast with lots of
other stuff on top this juice is called
vegan vampire it's like feet root hair
some other stuff as a fruit salad these
are some kale chips because I think that
he thought this place would have the
best kale chips so this is the place to
try them you've had one really and are
they known as good as crazy okay let's
be honest look and then as I've got the
eggs which look so good and carrots and
an artichoke it's really really good we
decided to come to the beach because why
not we have a couple hours before our
next museum no we're going to see the
cathedral spend a couple hours before
our tickets there so we thought we'd
come see the beach so we're just walking
over this winding bridge which was
actually quite scary because you can see
the cars driving putting few but
it's a gorgeous hot day I made the
mistake of not wearing sunscreen
yesterday and I mentioned that but my
shoulders are so sunburned so today I
made sure to put extra SPF 50 on top of
those pale pale shoulders anyway we are
looking at some boats lots of trees very
calm atmosphere I'm assuming the beaches
that way the beach is that way
there actually some pretty huge yachts
here look at that this is like wearing a
brownish style that's a big one
some more big ones over there that one
over there that's a beast okay I don't
know what it seems like hours of walking
I think we've finally made it let's see
I think it just over this Ridge here
this is like one of the many beaches
Selene has like 20 more of these all in
Barcelona
so after a long tube journey where are
we
I'm so hot you know yet we are at the
Cathedral la familia
tada look at it Wow right there in front
of us
amazing yeah that is quite very tall
yeah and yeah and very much still in
construction because I feel like how I
shouldn't really be because this has
been in construction since like 1908 or
something they've never stopped building
it but I thought like they'll come maybe
coming to the end of it but this is very
much still you can tell just like cranes
and stuff
oh yeah right there oh yeah we're going
up the towers later on today
I think so yeah I think so
lift Wow you'll be glad to know it's a
lift all right let's get queuing since
we're about eight minutes early we pre
booked it I decided I could get one of
these on they're so good
bazooka
so that as them won't try it but I don't
know why it's freaking delicious on huge
to rainy is a mind-blowing when you're
here like
Wow I'm out of carving this is like I'm
poorer than did with the temples yeah
Wow just yet again Wow I mean so much
Kali crazy Kali no way
nuts for the cottage there's like
there's probably so much that he just
can't be up there it's it's like really
overwhelming the amount of carving there
it's about detail let's go inside let's
see what else does it have to offer
nice little the gates leaves with
beetles and stuff
Magnus
beautiful stained glass that has a nice
variation very slow gradual variation in
colors he had some oranges some greens
and some blues over there
and it's kind of like when I first saw
it I was like oh it's just LED lighting
like a bit weird they were put LED
lighting in some place like this but no
it's actually just the stained glass
filtering the light from the outside and
it like over here is like really orange
it really gives a different kind of
atmosphere
and right the front of it
even these full HTML or August
like cave drawings no mark
there's Matthew I don't want these uh
this is the icon read that
I'm sure about that one
but if you look further up you can see
that right it's up there yeah
seeing's quite different the tiles there
better something else and the light
shining through is very nice down so it
turns out there's actually another
church underneath the main people that
up here is another church down there
what we're now taking what looks like a
very very terrifying lift up to the top
of the Nativity town
over here it's public oh yeah so we're
gonna have to see me this with a leaf
and then you climb Tammy too small by
stairs craft a bridge over here and then
go all the way up with the stairs on the
other side of the bridge it's only one
way so please don't go back thank you
so I've got a bit of stair climbing to
do apparently only 10 meters but here
you can see I'm pretty high up already
these are some pretty nurses they scared
pretty high
look you like amongst the birds I'll pan
no didn't realize there was a ponder
look at the fun you can see all the fish
all the black marks of fish so yeah well
here's an up-close personal of the
construction still building more towers
I think those black marks there's
probably a not fish
there's probably just dead leaves the
shadows because none of them actually
moving as they pointed out as the
terrify to stay pointed oh hey Bill my
pulse
I'll add a second ds-160
it's pretty cool you know what I feel
like I feel like Quasimodo yeah right
now you know walking amongst the top
part of the Cathedral
thank you so you can see all the way up
to town that's pretty cool
look down
and I stays right there you can see the
shoulder boos look through the window
they should be terrified
yeah
who made it alive yeah that's pretty bad
yeah that's pretty pretty partner we're
back in Monsieur because we're hungry
we have about an hour to place of
lunches and of course you actually go
back to the airport my time with buster
is coming to an end
but we want to have one more good tap
Spanish me
not a walking may not seem like it much
a lot of going down tight staircases
yeah we aren't it that's for sure
we're actually back in bar Lobo yeah
well actually I didn't want to go to a
different restaurant but we couldn't
find it it's meant to be just down there
but I couldn't find it we looked over
there over here no way to be seen so
we're back here because it was pretty
good
yes the food is here and I staged
ourself healthy looking and I've got my
area and clearly this is the spoon
they've given me to use might be
challenging but I'll give it a go we
have another walk to the train station
I'm not sure we have to get off the
train and then another train or if we're
just going to the regular train but yeah
heading to the airport ok so we've gone
through the chaos that is airport
security came out unscathed and we're
coming over here to have a look at our
flights and guess what guys it's bloody
delayed shouldn't mean here at age 20
now gonna be here at 9:00
so our whole extra hour got us pretty
much whatever yeah you look good when
you sweat
let's try and get a drink and cool down
shall we
we've just boarded the plane and this
guy out here is working the selfie stick
I wish I had that Wow like this guy's
done online yeah this has been going on
like now five

a pace you really have to you know yeah
I know I like
