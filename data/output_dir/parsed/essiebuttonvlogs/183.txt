while but we're actually going to take
him to the hair salon cuz he's gonna get
his hair did isn't he yeah it's
his his hair he's smelling kind of bad
he's feeling a little on the rank side
so we're gonna go get him wash it's a
lot easier to take him to a place to get
it actually done because otherwise we've
got to like try to fit him in our
bathtub and he gets really scared as he
doesn't got the stairs have to carry em
yeah it's a big ordeal so I got last
time was just it's a little today it's
very gonna take one little mistake for
me to slip or something and drop him or
something so also you can go to the hair
salon let's go good here he is going
inside pets at home mr. cool this is
Reggie's first time inside a store
actually and he seems to be doing well
so Reggie's in the spa and he's
surrounded by other dogs as well as per
normal he's not bothered but apparently
he's getting a blueberry facial today
and you excited Reggie Reggie is in the
little tub section and he is he's
terrified but he's doing well but he
gets so scared normally and this is a
lot better than trying to trap him in
our bathtub but yeah good that he's
getting nice and fresh
Reggie's getting his tongue sprayed with
some fresh breath spray look at this guy
oh-ho he doesn't like it okay you can go
on a hot date now Reggie yeah
phase one is complete and he's looking
great
he's already smelling amazing so now
we're gonna try to get him up on the
table we'll see
treatment right now he's getting to
people dry him at the same time how do
you think he's doing
- the first time in a room
yeah I think so too he's even telling
yeah
so Reggie's getting a leave-in
conditioning hydrating butter and
apparently you just rub it in to the fur
and then you dry it in Aslan's made
friends with the groomers dog he says
the dog smells really good apparently so
a pamper session wouldn't be complete
without dog cologne and he actually
smells very dapper right now he is yeah

good because Reggie's ears get really
bad really gross
