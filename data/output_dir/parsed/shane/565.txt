hey you guys okay I'm very very nervous
today because I'm going to be trying ice
cream flavors that should not be ice
cream flavors now I've done some
crazy-ass mix-ins Coldstone I've put in
Cheerios I've put in bacon sometimes I
put in broccoli just for the fiber but
the flavors I'm going to try today are
little past that on a scale of high to
highest look these are definitely hands
full okay let's get started first flavor
it is oh my god uh
butter - mashed potatoes and gravy ah oh
my god okay all right here we go
oh my god no you see a peak of the gravy
see it in there oh she's spitting at me
oh my god honestly it tastes like my
Thanksgiving my mom actually used to put
melted ice cream in the instant potato
mix cuz she thought it was classy oh
okay let's do this oh my god oh my god
okay oh my god okay okay ah ah oh oh my
god okay it tastes like I'll rip your
flow there's somebody threw up in and
then a cow came over took in it and
then a bird was like ooh you lost a bra
the Paula Deen came over with my ten
sticks of butter and she's like how
about this oh and then they froze it oh
this is the worst thing I've ever had
and that's saying a lot
I eat my own foot skin which actually
not that bad kind of use that kale chips
this oh oh by the way this company this
is not sponsors called salt & straw
which is exactly the opposite of what I
want with ice cream alright next is
spiced goat cheese and pumpkin pie why
who did this is Snoop Dogg your shelf
he's in the back room like oh I
just got a good idea you got some of
that leftover pumpkin pie what about
some of that goat cheese God put
the whole fridge in there alright here
we go
oh okay it's just white so like I'm not
too scared of it there's no chunks maybe
it'll just be a little creamy surprise
here we go
ah maybe I'm high spot cuz that's good
this is good oh I can taste the pumpkin
I could taste the graham cracker I could
taste a nutmeg for some reason I know
all the elements of a pumpkin pie don't
ask but then you got that goat cheese
which kind of these like sour comes me
it's like yogurt cottage cheese like the
pumpkin pie has been dropped in some
kind of a frozen yogurt situation oh and
then somebody hit it with that with that
whipped cream on top and they're like
ooh that is not bad I like that she can
stay next is strong no oh my god why
strawberry avocado sherbert sure make
sure Shante you stay
