hey what's up you guys I'm at the animal
shelter right now and I have completely
fallen in love with another dog and I
know what you're thinking yes I know I
have 500 dogs but this one is special
oh I've decided I've decided to name him
Oh ed because he has Owen Wilson's
haircut and his nose is a little messed
up I don't know though I can't get him I
mean I already have like way too many
dogs but should I get him shitting no no
I shouldn't should I know yes should I
know either way I haven't made up my
mind yet but you guys go adopt a dog for
me because come on how freaking cute Oh
give everybody kiss and you probably
broke my camera
