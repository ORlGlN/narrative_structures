I'm just sitting outside today
pondering life with my bitches my
bitches my bitches we love to ponder
life no so I actually just wanted to
talk to you guys today and just have
like a serious little conversation
because I feel like I don't really do
those as much anymore and the reason is
a lot of you guys are writing me saying
Shane you're different Shane there's
something different about you lately
what's going on are you finally going to
tell everybody about your transgendered
life about the kid you adopted about
your husband in Jamaica
no that's all secret how was secret
first let me start by saying this year
has been really tough losing my grandma
trying to get a TV show and trying to do
something bigger and trying to work hard
at that and you know all the rejection
that comes along with Hollywood you know
it's very different from YouTube I kind
of got a depression after my grandma
died and I haven't really been able to
kick it and I don't know why well yeah
she died so that's a reason but I really
know like the full extent you know I
feel like it was kind of because she was
my biggest fan you know and like when
you lose your biggest fan you kind of
have to reap ponder you know well what
does it all mean you know why am I doing
this that type of shit oh god here we go
Charlie shut up I have power as he pees
and stares at me you have the power
shade so long story short it's been a
hard year you know coming up with video
ideas every week trying to make them
and original and different from the last
one and it's hard to do that when you're
kind of sad about stuff and you've
probably noticed I've been kind of sad
lately but I'm getting out of it like
I'm starting to feel better it's you
know it's more of like I'm trying to
focus on
sorry chocolate is like all about my big
I'm trying to focus on things that
really make me happy chocolate you can
output you know like my animals my
family my friends um you know just you
guys of course you know it's like making
videos makes me happy but sometimes I
forget that so that's the main thing
mmm Charlie agrees so long story short
I'm going to try to get back into the
group of making videos this weekend I'm
going to go out with my friends and go
to some family stuff for Easter so
there's not going to be a video but well
there'll be one of my second channel but
after that I'm going to get back in the
swing of things and uh I don't know I
just want to make some good stuff for
you guys and I want to be happy doing it
and I am so I'm talking too much I love
you guys I will talk to you later
all the dogs love you except for Miley
but she doesn't really like anybody
