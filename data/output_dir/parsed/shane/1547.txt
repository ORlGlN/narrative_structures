hey what's up you guys we are here say
hi everybody hi and we are discussing
the latest trends sorry why should I
explain Charlie is currently coding
right now you look really good charlie
anyways ok so coning is not actually
this it is what is it it's like ice
cream cones
I guess it's hilarious it sounds like a
waste of ice cream well what if we
change it and go to Taco Bell and ask
for a burrito and then when they give it
to us we just smush it it's the same
thing alright well what if we go to
Yogurtland and we we fill our hands with
yogurt and then take it out to the front
and put our hand on the on the way
machine alright well let's think of what
I want to do right now is think of a new
like you know how there's a ling why
don't Steve you show us what a ling is
and then Jared can you show whoo-hoo
and that looks like you're about to
my dog okay and Jared why don't you show
us the other one what's the other one
planking yeah plank Jared
all right that's really good
whoo so I want to think of the next one
the new one I have a few ideas in my
head I'll say my idea Bree and you do
what you think it is ready
birthing nope you want to see what it is
you come up with one and then it will
have the audience both and say which one
is should become the next thing shoo
what's Ewing I kind of like that one
okay what's that what's that that I feel
like only only couples you look like
you're at comic-con that's her cosplay
I'm sexy thing I've ever seen she's a
poor kid at comic-con
all right you guys what do you think
even shooing spidering or birthing
should be the next new thing leave a
comment I think they're gonna go with
shooing I don't know it's too good
shooing calls out all the other
though yeah how stupid it is
