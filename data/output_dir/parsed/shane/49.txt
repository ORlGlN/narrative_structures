guys I have huge news and I haven't even
told you yet guess what we're getting
today even better than a dog a person
baby we're adopting you are not ready
for each other everybody's I'm gonna be
a bad dad
why because I yell a lot I'm crazy I
love fast food and when my dog gets
annoying I just lock up in the bathroom
no you literally can't shove a child in
a room when you're annoyed with me okay
my childhood it worked I'm great I know
I'm just kidding but in all honesty we
are adopting a child so I was like you
know what I want to prove people wrong
and show the world that I'm gonna be a
good dad don't you fucking laugh this is
my moment do you know what do you think
yeah I did loosen twice okay so here's
what I did so when I moved to LA I
actually had an agent they were called
youth and talent connection now this
agency had a bunch of kids and their
kids were always in commercials and on
TV shows and in movies and then of
course there was me who is killing it
look at my headshots yeah I didn't book
shit either way I emailed them and I
said hey send me some kids this is a
weird so she sent me a bunch of kids and
one of the kids I instantly fell in love
with his name was Christopher Harling
his pictures were so cute and he was in
a little motorcycle jacket he had good
hair and he had cute eyes he's
definitely from her jeans not mine I
also looked at his resume and he's very
active and he loves sports and cycling
and karate and gymnastics so yeah we're
not doing any of them
honestly he's probably richer than us
which is exactly how I want my kid okay
so I need to figure out what we're gonna
do today I need to get dressed I'm
nervous
Chito are you excited to meet a new
member of your family
what the fuck was that I saw it that was
a dad dad's coming it's almost here you
