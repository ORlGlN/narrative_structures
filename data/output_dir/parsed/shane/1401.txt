this week on hoarders dude a creepy man
that works on the internet collects lots
of toys that are meant for children and
gay guys and he struggles to deal with
his personal demons he also have lots of
dead cats under the bed
hoarders hey what's up you guys I just
got back from the gym and I came in to
my room and it looked like this because
they were doing a carpet cleaning and
start lesbian joke here
out in my living room and my filming
area so I guess my mom and the carpet
guys brought all my stuff from you and I
look insane I look like Michael Jackson
with all these teddy bears but it's
really cool because I get to see like
how much crap I bought and that I don't
need like a chicken suit don't really
need that but I have it like a big
yellow pimp suit okay I do need that
thank God I have that so today's gonna
be fun I am going to an audition well I
had the audition I got a callback to be
a voice on a cartoon so I'm gonna go do
that hopefully I don't that up and
then after that Joe my friend is coming
over and we're gonna work on a Sheneneh
and Seana video editing so we're gonna
show you a sneak peek of that and then
after that I think I'm gonna bitch-slap
Lauren just a typical day in the
neighborhood a typical day and the
neighborhood wouldn't be nice nobody
gets that song mr. Rogers died before
any of you guys born so sad Lauren turn
off your vibrator
so me you showing your Grey's you can't
even I'm kidding you have no I gave them
all to you I've named them all that one
is friends forever that one is how she
name is still Christmas Oh God super
love don't even turn around no no it's
just it's shiny cuz the walls were white
so it was reflecting that's totally what
it is alright I'm leaving
wish me luck I mean I'm not telling them
what it's really for
I'm saying it's an audition it's not a
coincidence that you're standing right
next to Jesus and then all right next to
the dogs welcome to my life alright bye
I'm gonna be a huge star you're gonna be
nobody bye ah she just wants me to buy
her things
you're never getting a raise bye
alright you guys um so while I'm on my
way I'm gonna be thinking out loud
because I'm writing a spoof song right
now to Justin Bieber's song beauty and a
beat lyrical genius everybody so I am
trying to figure out what to do and I
kind of want to do a spoof well about
bad television and how shitty it is
everything that's going on that's just
terrible
so here's my question to you question of
the day what is the worst TV show on TV
right now that in your opinion I think
the worst TV show is I mean honestly no
I talk about it all but the Kardashians
like kind of did it like Paris
Hilton is amazing she's hilarious she
doesn't know she's hilarious and she
kind of knows she's hilarious she's just
like the fun it's stupid whereas the
Kardashians like they're just annoying
so that's my pick what's
is some really a bad TV that's I'm
working on to infinity and beyond and
then back down to earth slapped in the
face with reality hey guys
so I just got out of the audition um and
it went really really well I think I
don't know they were laughing I was
laughing maybe they were laughing at me
oh no uh here's the deal I never get
nervous for auditions because you know
it's like listen I could get it I might
not get it whatever I really want this
one but who knows
so I try not to get nervous I got so
nervous today
I three breat well I said three I
meant my body meant for I said four
times and not just explosive it was
like a explosive that made the
whole building like terrified I mean it
turned into Cloverfield people were
running out of their offices running
into the parking parking structures
screaming no it wasn't that bad but I
walk into the audition room and there's
like Paul Scheer he's a comedian who I
love and he's standing there and I'm
like huh of course I act like I didn't
know who it was I'm like hey what's up
dude in my head I'm like huh ah and then
 I looked at on the list and
Chris Kattan is also auditioning for
this who is SNL who I mean hello I love
him
freaking out and then this other guy
from Saturday Night Live walks in and
I'm sitting there and I'm like I'm
 I'm on YouTube I'm I have
nothing I wear wigs but I think I think
it went well who knows it would be so
cool to work with those people I mean
granted they're probably auditioning for
the same part as me so I wouldn't be
working with them I'd be working against
them and it would be terrible oh no I
don't want to end up like Justin Guarini
and Kelly Clarkson what Paul Scheer I
would be Justin Guarini he'd be Kelly
so anyways hopefully I get it if I don't
I don't know I don't even know when I
find out I probably won't find out for
like
weeks so fingers toes balls everything
cross ow oh I just tried to cross my
balls don't try that with him hey guys
so we are right now working on the
Sheneneh Shoshana on the street what do
you think of it it's been crazy you know
it's pretty insane we have Harry Potter
we have spongebob we have a Mexican who
looks very familiar that's all I have no
idea who he is I don't know anything
about my face oh and right now we are
trying to shorten it a little bit cuz
there's so much funny stuff because God
me and Shana hilarious terribly we're
this so funny
Lauren was like you guys aren't funny
we're cutting some stuff I know but very
sad is gonna be uh or actually by the
time this goes up this will probably
already be up so this is useless you
guys already know if it's funnier the
future well technically checking the
vids a pass but we're looking into the
future should be man that's deep
that's written this words of Sheneneh
that's real good too dark and deep um so
we're gonna continue editing I just want
to give you guys a little deleted scene
but that probably won't even be deleted
cuz your priority side this is uselessly

has melted so leave me alone I love you
