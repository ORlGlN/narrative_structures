hey what's up you guys it is like 3:00
in the morning I am at a Steve and
Brie's house and Jarrod just found the
dog's collar that supposedly choked or
what does it do we've never used it
because I'm too afraid to put it on her
but it's supposed to it's not even on
here dude like oh my god that would be
dogs have an Adam's I press it against
it tight right here yeah dude it's right
on my fucking esophagus on do dogs it's
meant for like a two pound animal this
feels like a really messed up party well
they're never gonna use this on you
right somebody's dead like the best way
to get her to stop her because he's one
of those I just can't
yeah basically now now this my PETA
