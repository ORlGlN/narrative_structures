hey welcome to Bob Kahn where we talk
about everything that's blowing up on
the internet a video was released of a
young child taking their very first
steps on ice allow me to correct myself
a small Teletubby takes her very first
steps on ice wait that's it the video
was just getting good
too bad that child has a responsible
parent who probably turned off the
camera to go help them how am I gonna
satisfy my seed ISM now she's chill you
my desire to see other people's pain was
fulfilled good thing it happened before
my parents got home am i right BuzzFeed
recently released a list of 24
celebrities with their faces Photoshop
to look like that of a sloth
ah
unfortunately that last photo has not
been altered in any way also I'm like a
99% sure Joan Rivers cheekbones are
bigger than a generous pair of manboobs
get back a woman all right
I had no idea Miley could get any
scarier after her we can't stop video
her launch EDM a performance or her
lighting the joint at emas
but the Internet has done it again and
made Miley Cyrus a reoccurring fixture
and every single one of my nightmares
I can't even scream from my mom because
mommy and Miley sound went too similar
this week on YouTube I want to note well
member Connor Franta is definitely not
sure if he's in focus you want to see
what's funny actually I don't even know
if I'm in focus to be honest one minute
we made it and I don't know if I'm in
focus but you know I stuff I can't even
see anyone talking about focus right now
also three young attractive dudes in one
video might as well blow in the wind and
come with a hashtag because I ship all
of it thank you all for watching this
