oh this like a dick other parent
that's that our dance break
the scariest part of the night driving
while I'm vlogging and so I am on my way
home from the Universal Studios thing it
was really fun here's the thing I don't
get scared I know this is very shocking
to people but I am NOT a pussy I
literally get scared by nothing no movie
has ever scared me no fake monster has
ever scared me the only thing that's
like scared me is public bathrooms and
that's like reasonable because have you
ever seen the actual toilet seat I think
I've ever actually looked before you
cover in plastic just take a look I
literally saw pubic hair on the toilet
seat with root that means it was pulled
out and then placed on the toilet seat
full route so anyways it was a fun night
and speaking of Halloween hopefully you
guys have already seen it if not check
it out my Halloween special just went
out it is an Aunt Hilda teaching you how
to have the perfect Halloween party with
cameos by one direction ladies and
gentlemen one direction
it's a question of the day what is one
thing in real life that scares you have-
public bathrooms what's something don't
give me something like monsters I want
something like feet or dirty asshole and
a last thing before I crash and die I
forgot to tell you guys I was a special
guest judge on dance showdown which is
kind of like Dancing with the Stars for
youtubers and it was really fun I would
got to sit next to join Fatone from
NSYNC I got to sit next to Laurieann
Gibson who is this huge choreographer
she's like Lady Gaga's right-hand woman
and it was really fun I gotta judge
people's dancing which I mean let's be
honest it's kind of like Britney Spears
judging a sanity contest it's like
really we can't really say anything

can't think of anything else to tell you

get killed by zombie ladies and
gentlemen one direction
