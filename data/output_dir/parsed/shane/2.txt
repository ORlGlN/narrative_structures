now the great day has arrived
I want to pick up here this is beautiful
are you against me
yes okay sure I won't have you framed up
absolutely got a great point thank you
oh let's see under the most genuine and
scary place is we want to see areas that
like you shouldn't show us this is the
isolation ward what to get to the
isolation room which is where people
would get isolated in your sick that
they died there now I have to warn you
we are not the only ones in there so
please watch your step
okay my friends out here well he's your
spirit that's pretty too
they are going this is like next-level
the isolation our neighbor we kept
contagiously ill passengers even wait
right here you can see some of the
original can I go in there of course
that's what's been nurses grow but your
face was lit already that's bullying
right wait
cranking up spanking what was that
and just freak them out they just got
scared okay let's see here we carry over
two million passengers across the
Atlantic 56 that they know of did not
make it the way across and if you come
back here get a list of passengers and
crew
right on this side of that hallway was
the ice ice cream and beer storage so
right here above us was also the more
not just mental that hasn't probably
ever will
deep down the car
the most haunting thing I've ever seen
in my life
and you may have felt the temperature
drop as the bottom escalator we are now
standing under water
no that's so crazy I think that so much
and the reason the walls might be
coldest you are now walking through door
number third dude wait this is the door
right here what's up with this door this
crushed two men they got none that we
know of so a guy got crushed to death
right here oh the openings right now is
larger than it used to be
hold it open yeah
the veteran has turned stride to the
water and gracefully along
so we have a paranormal investigator
that does investigations through here he
had a tape recorder sitting right here
on the edge was talking to his guests
about five or six people and he played
the recording back later and they heard
a voice in the background that none of
them recognized in the middle of the
conversation there was a deep gravelly
voice that just said get out right here
right where you're standing okay
everybody be quiet
are you here
if you wants to leave say something
well listen to that I want to get back
to the room we need to charge the camera
what brings it into the character well
we have the B decrement we have the
Suites in this week you get more reports
of activity on B deck than any other
level onboard the ship for our hotel
arrests that's the one that we have
thank you for that okay we're back in
the room we're gonna go get some food
but the reason I started fucking having
a panic attack and none of you guys
noticed except for Andrew was when you
laid on that top bunk and you were
underneath it the whole top bunk started
bending and then there was a crack in
the center of it which I don't know if
we did I hope we didn't do because I
don't want to get sued you know that
would have broke that literally would
have killed you I honestly laid on the
bed because it's a bunk for somebody to
sleep on I know but it's a billion years
now yeah I'm not telling mom that you
killed me can you imagine that wait you
saw that right I'm not crazy it
literally was going to snap and break
yeah it was bending so much down stay
down there for like five more seconds
broken and probably it would have a
final destination yeah what a punch
heard right through your body and broke
you in half
famous 1920s dance when I do this oh do
they come crazy
looking for moms I want to break the
glass

and said yes and no and had me describe
it to him when I said white with black
spots well that's what's been reported
here for a that's cool but we've kind of
noticed a few unlocked doors there are
some unlocked doors around here and
that's what you want to be careful of
because you might be open up a door you

open feel to be careful about opening
doors I've got your feed 340 around the
corner

what point cuz you might have just said
something that were they now
this is right when we Alou you left you
alone you're like wait is it on me and I
was like yeah it's on you you look like
a corpse oh that's what they only use
them what wait what if that sounded so
crazy
yeah that was crazy we what was that
isn't that what that lady was saying
that you've heard that high pitch the
pitch yeah what is that oh yeah you
can't wait but it sounded like a woman
let's just Harrigan after you say guys
guys nobody responded no and I
specifically didn't respond so I was
kind of like creeping out like don't say
anything
wait let's keep going
see okay I said guys nobody responded to
me yeah and then I said wait guys cuz
nobody responded yeah so I didn't hear
whatever that was ah literally is a
voice remember that lady was saying down
there in that room she heard that loud
like wobbly high pitch oh that's what
that was yeah and that's none of our
voices I was you sounds higher pitch
than Morgan and she wasn't talking I
said I bet the woman that we met earlier
when she played us the high pitched
sound it was on her phone so maybe that
caught something different that sounds
okay oh I just got the chills oh my god
self that sounds like it's mocking you
like I heard like oh my god wait listen
to all my sight guys ready right into an
you listen listen okay
cuz you were alone and kind of scared
and it sounded like it was like feeding
off you going like guys
let's keep on going
again with the foot that when you think
you hear something out there
okay that is fucking weird I love it
every time I think I hear a voice on
that thing and it's like loud that thing
happened that closet moves
don't that was like a song that was
crazy
plus I told you that I asked that wanted
me to stay do you remember I told you it
felt like it was hovering above me like
and it was like sad and it was like
didn't want me to go yeah but I
shouldn't hear anything I was like I
just I felt something that sounded like
a lady like singing that
that is fucking scariest without kissing
the chills oh my god oh where do you
rolling did you get that no I'm like
crying cuz like that was crazy
my knees are weak we have to get
something just dripped on me weak owes
me nothing that killed the guy in
Titanic
what
these women walking down the boy scared
shirt wasn't a mirror
I never ran out of a kitchen so I think
we should just go to sleep for real
well somebody should sleep in that scary
ass room by the front door hey hey shhh
ching ching not kidding the doors
opening right now the front door just
fuckin opened whoa whoa I said literally
right behind me as I was walking out of
the room the doors dude did something
follow us that was with Lowe's closed it
like Ashton no can't be just fucking
open
close it again we closed a lunch it 11
okay close that one I was just still
wasn't Spanish that mean about feeling I
had I was like when we were walking back
to the room I'm like something with my
doesn't happen tonight why did that
happen
you okay
I'm gonna go to bed hopefully when we
wake up nobody's done the hedonic moment
has come it's the next morning I did not
sleep well I definitely had sleep
paralysis I'm very excited
what you stole the bed from there all
right so here's my official review this
place is extremely haunted
mainly because so many people have died
here the whole time we were here we
didn't see anybody no other guests like
one employee on this pole ship no it
I mean first we heard the noise is
tapping inside of the closet did you tap
no no one's had them and all of us hurry
I don't know if I've ever actually like
witnessed something bad crazy even
people who are skeptical I feel like
something's here but I'm not like I
don't think it's like trying to kill me
then every single picture that Garret
took had orbs in it and not just normal
orbs
like different colored ones yeah and one
with a vase in it and then we went to
the isolation chamber but then when I
spent some time in there alone and
started asking questions we listen back
to the recording and we heard in answers
what then of course the crazy amount of
doors that just open on their own oh my
god closed on their own
whoa look at that noises coming from
every single corner of this hotel like
using a squeak scream head what is that
lights just turning on or turning off on
their own whoa what the hell is that
what the hell is that what's going on
and I'm sure there's gonna be tons of
other things that I didn't even notice
until I'm editing this video
so all in all I would say that
don't want to come back and I am very
excited to leave but I think what we
should do to wrap up this amazing
experience let's go get some food at
maybe Chipotle and maybe show them your
new lip tattoo my god
