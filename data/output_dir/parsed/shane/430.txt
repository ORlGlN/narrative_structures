hey you guys yes I am so excited
today because we're going to be making
my favorite food about God but not only
are we just gonna be making my favorite
food of all time we are going to be
galley acceding that's not a word you
know what I'm talking about we're gonna
be doing that nachos are not like
The Pursuit of Happyness to me is like
the pursuit of chips covered in cheese
but someone's like I love long walks on
the beach I'm like I love long stretchy
pieces of cheese on my chips it just
makes my heart beat so today I have all
the ingredients for the perfect nachos
and all the ingredients for the perfect
galaxy honestly if the whole galaxy was
just nachos I want to live anymore well
let's get started the first time a huge
ass bag of chips which is party size and
it's just me by the way when I was
checking out at the store the woman's
like oh having a party and I was like
yeah yeah bitch you don't need more
than one person have a party you just
need good food good music and a good
toilet let's open it up
ok so first we're gonna be pouring these
chips into this bin which is a serving
size for me I like using a bin because
the cheese won't run off the sides it's
almost like a boat by this kind of
putting people in it you're putting
cheese oh my god the Titanic would have
been so much more fun if it was covered
in Jesus like yeah all those people
would have died and like that's
depressing but like cheese though oh my
god
I love that sound so really you're
thinking shame those are just normal
chips those aren't galaxy chips well
just you wait and see
I have galaxy occlude coloring sprays
and I'm going to be spraying all these
chips and making them look completely
inedible but when you're me
nothing's inedible
okay so let's start with purple so I'm
thinking that I'm gonna like do a fade
once I'm with the Supercuts and the
girls like Oh what would you like I'm
like I don't know like shorter on the
sides a little longer at the front she's
like okay so like a fate I was like
girls Supercuts don't be using your
technical jargon in here nobody knows
what that means
just don't it up I'm literally
giving you $5.00 give me something that
looks like it costs $5 and then she gave
me this
thank Supercuts all right here we go
let's get a little zoomin
oh yeah all right well they're looking
gross but that's what we want let me
just drive one chip
oh that's everything okay yeah I just
need to do them all individually that's
gonna take 10 hours grab snack oh yeah

color cheese is I'm so excited
calm down Shan literally shut the
up let's get started all right so we'll
start with the pink because I feel like
that's going to be the prettiest okay so
I'm just going to add the whole thing
because I have no limits and portion
control
alright see how much I love of a bloody
cheese dip it's definitely looking more
red than in his pink well maybe it's cuz
I added it to yellow uh colors okay it's
getting a little Pinker remember when
pink the singer or like catchphrase
would be we're all pink on the inside of
my bitch using my nose ours they are
brown all right so that's as pink as
it's gonna get I mean it's kind of red
but it still works okay now we are going
to do blue right wait is it gonna make
green because of the yellow oh it's okay
