a good comment question of the day what
do you guys think Oprah and Gayle do in
their spare time I'm gonna go with
finger paint with chocolate on each
other's bodies
I think they hand make dream catchers
well fondling each other's breasts whoo
and then they call them cream catchers
haha and they do other things though
yeah well I guess this is our like Oprah

a pretty good and it goes out to you
