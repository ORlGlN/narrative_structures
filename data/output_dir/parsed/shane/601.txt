week on muncom I'm going to be teaching
you guys how to make the perfect Nicole
Arbour Halloween costumes costume
actually requires very minimal supplies
all you're going to need is a trash bag
and a pair of scissors and you're going
to take the truck back pop that sucker
open cut a strategic hole where you want
her overly sized head to be you're also
gonna want to leave some room for her
arms slice and then it is time to put
the costume on all done
