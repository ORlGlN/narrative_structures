is Jess about a fucose friend
unfortunately she killed herself hey
guys today I am horrified because I'm
going to be eating something that I have
stayed away from my entire life mainly
because I was too poor to afford it when
I was a kid but also because it's not
food
today I'm going to be trying a bag full
of Lunchables now I did not know they
still made these I thought for some
reason Obama would I got rid of that
there's something about like a pizza
that's sitting in your backpack all day
that's not cooked it just it makes
everything in my body say no and my body
usually says yes to everything
hey buddy the McRib is back what do you
think oh yeah me too

trying a six of them Oh
alright let's go easy I'm gonna try that
nachos I remember kids eating these and
I was like so jealous of them cuz like
 they get nachos at school a little
fiesta the middle of the day all I got
was leftover tuna casserole that my mom
made which was a fiesta in my pants
later oh here they are
okay this is movie theater realness
alright first I'm gonna take a smell

flavors none of them are right oh yeah
it tastes like corn nuts that somebody
covered in that nasty-ass square cheese

somebody that just ate a big pizza
accidentally like fart and then spit
their third on it that's pizza third boo

cookie and a block of cheese right next
to each other not into it oh no oh
that's the same video okay see how this
little hammy is that smells like a
diaper which is interesting never smell
ham like that these look kind of good
though these are very salty very salty
oh they're probably so salty cuz
you need to like preserve them or
something it's Callie remember in school
when you learned in Lakeport great about
pirate ships and how they didn't have
refrigerators so they'd cover everything
in bags of salt
I think the religions came from all
right here we go I'm gonna put a little
piece of cheese on a little piece of
hammy and then I should sandwich it up
just like the picture except nothing

makes me so sad about childhood oh it's
salty and sweet boo is that a cookie
