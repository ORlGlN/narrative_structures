hey what's up you guys today's video is
going to be a little bit different and
not just because I'm wearing a different
shirt so I have been doing videos for
almost 10 years now
and there's something that I keep doing
and not a lot of you guys know about it
and I've confessed it a couple of times
but I feel like people keep forgetting
and I keep needing to tell you guys
again the truth and the truth is for the
third time I think my thumbnails oh it's
so good to say that I think my mum mail
I feel so free now I feel so open I feel
like I can tell you guys anything now
because you know because you know the
truth the truth is when I made a giant
burger cake it didn't turn out like that
it turned out like this but I couldn't
have that be the thumbnail you know like
people throw up
nobody would click it when I made galaxy
nachos didn't look like this it look
like this but it's not my fault okay I
have to do what I gotta do
so now once again I'm going to show you
guys the truth and show you how I make
these autofocus and once again I tell
you every time this is going to be the
most uncomfortable cringy video you've
ever seen so get some popcorn and get
ready to fucking cringe have fun
No
is like singing
yeah people think it's a minion top okay
like that fuck Andy King
Wow so there you guys go that was me
uncomfortably just making faces and
eating food I don't know I'm sorry once
again this is the third thumbnail
montage video I've posted here if you
haven't seen the other two I recommend
you do if you want to cringe your
fucking face off till you die I'll put a
link to those two videos where at the
top of the scription below if you like
this video please give me a thumbs up
and subscribe to my channel right down
below cuz I make new videos every day
and I will see you little thumbnails
oh my god oh fuck
trust me I know it doesn't look that big
but it's very big in person not me
actually me for my body
not for my dick anyways
