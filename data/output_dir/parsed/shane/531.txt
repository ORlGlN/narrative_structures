all right you guys I'm gonna show you
how fast I can open up one of these
candy bars and go oh my god fat kid
Olympics
I want hailed if you guys yes today I'm
going to be trying my first pin thing I
don't know I didn't even know what
Pinterest was until not that long ago
and everybody was like all change to
video or you make things on Pinterest if
I looked up Pinterest and all I saw was
rugs rugs and babies babies on top of
rugs it was a lot I don't know what it
is basically by I did some research and
I basically found out that Pinterest
also have like DIYs and recipes and
experiments and stuff I watched a lot of
man vs. pin if you don't know who it is
look it up and I thought it was fun so
I'm going to be trying some pins let me
know down the comments what else I
should try but you guys really wanted me
to try galaxy nails so galaxy is
apparently like a thing people are doing
now where everything is galaxies like
purple and blue and black I don't know
back in my day I just called them
bruises and I didn't need Pinterest I
just needed to walk into school anyways
so I watched a million videos on
galaxies nail art and I think I got it
down so I'm going to honestly fine give
this a try out okay let's do this
hey guys okay first of all I know it's
not good these are not good I don't know
what this is I thought it was a pimple
then I popped it then cheese came out
that's just a cut and I think that's a
wart I tried to freeze it off but like
just won't go but it's gonna be okay
because we're gonna make this hand so
pretty
and you'll forget about all of my warts
okay first I read that you're supposed
to put down a bottom coat which is I
guess this I'm shaking it I don't know I
don't know if you're supposed to shake
it but I've seen people at nail salon
shaking it okay so I'm just gonna do my
middle finger because that's what I use
most and
there we go okay so that's the bottom
coat all right looks awful so I guess
you just let that dry wait I should like
clean it up right so I'm just gonna
clean up around the edges oh this is not
gonna be good don't worry I have nail
polish remover because I'm
prepared okay I guess this is like the
technical way to do it what can I say
I'm a talented nail magician
okay now that it's dry I'm going to put
black cuz that's the color of the galaxy
and my heart check it up alright I'm
really gonna try on this alright oh oh
god oh god oh god please work please
work I got too much I got too much
amateur move they would help if I had
actual nails and not these sad bloody
nubs at you on okay that doesn't look
that bad I mean doesn't look definite
looks like my finger caught in a door
okay now let me just wipe off the excess
I am not supposed to use this in my
because it is up give you a
paper towel yeah that's working better
why does my nail have hair in it what is
that okay so that is how it looks so far
killing it okay so now that this nail
has dried it is time to put on some
stars so basically what the pin said
because you're supposed to put some
white on a sponge and like dab it on to
your nail and try to make stars that
sounds very complicated alright let's
give this a try
we got our nervous I'm gonna it up
oh god oh god oh god oh god okay here we
go here we go here we go okay okay okay
that's not that bad he's not good but
it's not bad it kind of looks like stars
and then like a couple little dots a
couple little random like planets oh my
god if you're like God just looking down
at the world what if I created okay and
then you take your blue and you do the
same thing so this is kind of like the
colors of the galaxy and I just
broke it damn it but it's fine I can fix
this now I can't okay other side Ryan
I'm just going to do a couple dabs of
blue eared here okay it's not too bad
okay okay I'm making this work I'm
getting into this oh I'm excited oh it's
working okay so now we're going to do
some pink oh my god what if this is my
new thing what if I become like Shan the
nail guy okay so now I'm just going to
put pink in the middle
blue and it's blending in with the blue
and it's like making a purple oh my god
this is awesome I think I'm doing it
right like I actually think this is
gonna look good
like I was really shocked okay now we're
gonna add some purple to that here's
purple and now I'm just gonna add a
couple more dots of white because I feel
like the stars are harder to see because
of all the colors and I think I'm gonna
do that this is not how the pin said but
I think I'm gonna put white on the
cotton ball
I feel like that'll make it look kind of
like cool like I don't know we'll see
alright so here we go okay that's kind
of cool I mean it kind of looks like
it's growing here but I'm not now that
that oh my god I'm so excited
well if I still excited right
now I don't know okay now we're gonna
add some glitter I'm nervous I think I
don't want to just cover the whole thing
in glitter wait how do I make
sure that that's not gonna happen let me
test it out of my other nail no that's
well maybe if I do like a white coat did
I just say white coat who the am i
this was a bad idea it up oh no no
no no no no no okay wait how do I fix
this
oh ah oh no now just getting
hair all over it damnit I got cocky
 okay you know what maybe after I
put the shiny stuff on top of this this
is called the top coat
maybe this will fix everything and it'll
just make it look right woo yeah
oh this is killing it you I don't know
if you can see that but look at all the
hair hold the cotton hair you
know don't judge my galaxy I mean I
don't think real nail artists have
fingers like this just covered in paint
and fuzz but that's fine I'm doing my
best
alright so now we're just going to clean
off the excess
it's a nail polish remover and that
should make it look perfect and by
perfect I mean fine and not great all
right here's my final reveal tada
oh man is that Pinterest I mean
that's not even cake but you know what I
 tried I tried so hard all my try
is gone you know I'm so devoted
to this I'm going to turn the camera off
I'm gonna do the rest of my hand and I'm
gonna make them as perfect as I can and
then I'll show you i'ma win you back
aren't you guys a long time later I am
finished with my thumb I'm not gonna do
my whole hand that would take forever
but I think my thumb is slightly better
take a look see I mean it's kind of cool
I ended up actually using a scrub daddy
I like took a chunk out of his head and
I used that to get the stars and stuff
on I think my main problem was the
little thing I was using to dab but
wasn't the right thing I think I needed
something with more like holes in it and
also I think I just should have done
blue and pink
I don't think purple was a good choice
because it all kind of blends together
but I mean honestly I'm kind of proud of
it you see if I can get like a real
pizza see there it is I mean it's ugly
well I mean you know no it's kind of
good it looks way cooler in my head I
don't know maybe I'll leave it like this
just one I don't know kind of statement
that makes but I'm okay making it you
know already came out so you guys know
that was me trying to do galaxy nails
let me know down in the comments what
other pins or a DIYs or whatever you
want me to try cuz I am honestly having
fun doing this also make sure to give
