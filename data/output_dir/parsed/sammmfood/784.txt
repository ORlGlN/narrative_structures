the Stanley Cup final has begun and the
Hawks are already losing one to zero
I need another shirt like this guys that
says 2015 we have not looked good so far
in the first period Noah what's the
secret to winning what are we gonna have
to do dude cheer louder to the hider
should we put our sweaters on we've been
swimming and I do upload the vlog really
quickly I come back and right when I get
back they score I hadn't put my lucky
Black Hawk socks on yet and ever since
I've worn them we've looked better but I
was a pretty bad first period dude I
wish you didn't have to go to bed you
watch this together okay
does this ever freak anyone else out
like the weather service announcements
ah those other announcements are made to
help us but they just scare me the voice
is always like all right
my alone am i weird did those scary Jen
yeah not as much as actual storm we
interrupt the Stanley Cup final to
admire this beautiful hair look at that
dude
it's crazy right now because I delish a
minute let's go to bed
let's go to bed well maybe too little
too late still 1:0 going into the third
period it was pretty even that period
lightning still kind of played better
than us we got to step it up I expect us
to win either Game one or two on the
road we have to hit the tie game one to
one it was if your basketball fan that
shot that we just scored on was like a
fadeaway
no-look three-pointers ridiculous the
degree of difficulty but it's tied we
look good so far anything could happen
the lightning can strike fast I my
sweater on though I have my sweater on
and maybe that's what's doing it I don't
know five minutes left
hopefully we can win it I need some
light in here
dark the ironic part is we have severe
thunderstorm warning like I didn't
realize that I filmed it and that's
actually happening right now so is that
a sign I don't know I don't see any
lightning yet oh yes yes yes yes
two two one oh my gosh holy crap I was
about to turn the camera on to say
something else and we just scored a good
look at this oh my goodness
we were terrible in the first period but
this period we have done work holy cow I
almost need like some my GoPro up for
this series and just capture the moments
because I'm always a second too late
ok there's 2 minutes and 30 seconds left
in the game I'm just going to keep the
camera on to capture anything that
happens heartache joy whatever oh my
gosh the clouds are crazy right now like
you should see the sky right now the
irony is insane with the fact that we're
facing the lightning oh my goodness
and they're humble scouring what is
going on the severe thunderstorm warning
keeps coming on - ah
crazy good a storm I just saw lightning
and we're facing the lightning and
they're making a run where else to - one
looks so crazy right now I know they
keep doing morning certainties do
there's a minute 30 left my house come
