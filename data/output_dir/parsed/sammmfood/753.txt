14 when I helped them move out here they
also spent one where he went to the hot
dog eating contest on Coney Island and
then went to West Point for the
fireworks

last fourth you remember how that went
when we watch the fireworks we
alternated you got out too we drove up
to a hill and just found fireworks and
you start watching the crazy part is we
can go back and watch that day because
we are blogging then a year ago today
we're experiencing something a little
bit different we thought there might be
bad weather so we changed our plans and
now we're just partying in the city no

glowstick pack for every single kid and

the Sun is setting the fireworks will be
launched off from the bridge above these
trees so we won't really be able to see
so we'll probably pack up all our stuff
and then go over there and watch that

demands what do you think of all this a
lot of fun 239 independence

Noah's ready for the fireworks although
I think I may have to cover his ears cuz
they're probably really loud
the test fireworks have been insanely
loud cuz they're literally right on that
bridge right there there's definitely a
different vibe over this part
streets
