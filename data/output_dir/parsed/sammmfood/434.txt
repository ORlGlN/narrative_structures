look who's here everything about it
is your first drainage 19 mm and the
surfer strange let's do it
these are usually what it comes you made
it at the end
first our lettuce yeah nothing like the
fresh scent of urine urine in the city
crazy
who's the guy they like going out like
Neil that it's like very touristy Asian
posters that ladies and gentlemen is a
tall building that make you dizzy
it is so tall it's like our area what is
the first stop for any tourists visiting
Chicago
it's got to be Millennium Park money I'm
parked in the beam just Rover headed
right now it's the first thing date I
wanted to see
so we'll get go get a picture there go
check it out
Danna and Jen both said when they first
saw it it looks a lot smaller in person
than it does in pictures but it is a
pretty big beam because you know beans
are pretty small wait I don't you have a
bet that you have to lick the beam oh
well the good thing is that they
actually clean it off too so but I would
never look it I'm not sure I I don't
know play this I don't see any imprint
on it it's like coming closer I don't
know if you guys can see this but it has
not been cleaned lately Jose and prints
all over
I think this is the best view of the
beaten up and kind of step back a little
bit into the whole city it's pretty cool
did you think of a cooler place to play
like as a venue as a musician I think
obviously there's the historical places
like Carnegie Hall and various other
places but this would just be so fun out
here in the middle of the park in the
city it's just beautiful
guys we thought this was a recording but
there is a real live orchestra over here
what's the spread called Maggie Daley
yeah Maggie Daley right it's like a
brand-new park actually I've never seen
it it's the first time I've seen it I
think the skating is also here there's a
new ribbon and I went tour that you can
skate but there's little things for kids
to do this is when we miss no one we
wish she was here because there's so
many different activities for him look
at this this sea is so cool
there's people reading books with music
giant swings doesn't it chanted forest
there's a table with laptops and tablets
and surface Pro's on it I don't know
what that's about the trees you're
upside down oh that's the Enchanted
Forest that is so cool
there's even a slide right here oh
there's Erin crossing the bridge right
there and did I mention this is all free
and way cooler than anything you could
say for this slide our ear is super
intense though all those leaves dagerous
