tell though now we're gonna know like
when the weather shaming cuz the skin
will start to break out I know I'm sorry
you got sand on my hands which is now me
rubbing sand into your skin
this is especially awesome because there
is no one here we've come here many
times and there's been so many people
but it's literally pretty much recessing
