get to get lower so you can actually
lift in case you haven't noticed we have
a new addition to the same local ethics
hey welcome
after further review the ruling on the
field is overturned tally you want to
give us an update on all right here boys
it was a lot closer than say I made it
out to be but I will give it to Sam he
actually beat me here
if we're gonna do the replay review
though we're gonna be consistent with it
and if anything else needs to be
reviewed it will be overturned so what I
got here if you can see what's funny the
reason Sam beat me is because he had a
lower trajectory on the ball as the ball
just goes out of Sam's hand right before
our balls are almost hitting the ground
at the same time mine takes the high
path as where to go it's traveling in an
upward position right here
and Sam's ball is headed directly for
the peanut buttered bread and his lands
only milliseconds before mine so Sam
enjoy that it's not gonna happen again
okay well after further review there's a
new winner of the ping-pong how much
they pay you again now you didn't pay me
