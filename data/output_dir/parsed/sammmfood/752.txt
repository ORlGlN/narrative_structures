okay we're in keep reading you've every
want to finish this before we leave we
need to read this book and then read
another book and then read some more
bucks we like reading if you guys
couldn't tell and so we take turns
reading out chapters to each other isn't
really fun dobry is really good at
reading aloud she puts like voices to
each character and stuff but I don't I'm
boring like instead of elastic band she
said electric band like she could no
electric electric band around my leg I
know because I just stumble I hate
reading Lodge this is good practice for
me because when you make mistakes
mirroring to yourself no knows about it
