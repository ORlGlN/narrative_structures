chose one of the first days that feels
warm enough to the outside it's really
nice the kids are so bundled up but it's
not freezing which is all that matters
so give it some time
yo what's up what's up coups there
what's up peeps and I felt like I said
it like what's today Sunday church today
so one of my favorite my favorite lines
from a vlog I know I ever said was
baseball it's right after Kris Bryant
hit his third home run in a game we're
both wearing our jerseys today well I'm
wearing mine cuz no one wanted me to and
it's because the all-star games today
more importantly Jen's been saving this
clip for us to watch downstairs of the
Cubs at Spring Training in Mesa Arizona
which is where we just were we were just
there and we just missed them
should we go back yes go back let's move
I think we're gonna go play basketball
outside in a minute after we watch this
but I wanted to let you guys know that I
actually got an email from the Cubs
organization I tweeted that out the
other day but I haven't showed the email
yet I'm gonna wait cuz I think they're
send me a package yeah so we'll see
what's in it they acknowledged everyone
in our family an email they said dear
Sam Jenna Cano and Penelope and they saw
our vlog of us at Spring Training so
hopefully there's something fun for
everyone

should show everyone you know so many
words we were reading the animal and
color and items book during church today
and he was pronouncing and he knew all
the different words in it and just we
hadn't read that book in forever so kind
of blew my mind
should we read that for everyone
sometime
I'm grateful for this because it powers
our planet powers everything and we were
able to go outside for a little bit
today it felt really good
it reminded me how happy the Sun makes
me I'm not I don't get sad or depressed
during the winter but it's definitely
harder to feel happy like there's an
energy you get from the Sun anything
