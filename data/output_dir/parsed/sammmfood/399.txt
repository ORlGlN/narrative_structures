it's time for event two which is a ping
pong peanutbutter game
let me explain it this time right here
we will be standing about ten feet away
you have a line we will then be flinging
a ping-pong ball onto the ground and
hopefully victims there goes and landing
on a piece of bread with peanut butter
first person to do it
and the fastest time gets three points
two points next fastest one point after
that if you do all 30 balls and you do
not get it
right now section a card that looks more
like I kept hitting some spot in the
floor and you see that they were like
okay
Oh like 16 16 18 1775 1777 right team
damina three two one begin
Wow I put on my time and energy into the
claw game it's okay though
whatever what was the score 17 second 17
and baby boy let me know
Wow oh my god sighs reset yes keith is a
marathon not a sprint
14:52 example what you do where you run
two three four five it's do but it make
you feel better at all seconds early he
does have a significant height of image
which gives you more let you have a
little power throwing down the wall
weight class here okay right three two
one start
sleep have a seat what I was doing I had
three in my hand to my nuts through I
got throw to kinking Jeff right three
two
it's me Sam and David right now sorry
sorry
wait there we go okay and the peanut
butter challenge is it wouldn't be the
Olympics without a little bit of
controversy after and during the event I
said you know I feel like our times
could've been closer we need a video
review that get an actual review of the
exact time of everything I even threw a
read challenge flag which is downstairs
and I might have to carry on hand for
future events
we then chatted on a group text message
after everyone had left
I sent the footage to everyone we
reviewed it and this was Tyler's
response all right here boys it was a
lot closer than Sam made it out to be
but I will give it to Sam he actually
beat me here if we're gonna do the
replay review though we're gonna be
consistent with it and if anything else
needs to be reviewed it will be
overturned so what I got here
if you can see what's funny
the reason Sam beat me is because he had
a lower trajectory on the ball as the
ball just goes out of Sam's hand right
before our balls are almost hitting the
ground at the same time mine takes the
high path as where to go it's traveling
in an upward position right here
and Sam's ball is headed directly for
the peanut buttered bread and his lands
only milliseconds before mine so Sam
enjoy that it's not gonna happen again
so the question is what should we do
we have video review we might have to
visit video review again in the future I
suggested that Tyler and I both get
three points because it was so close
there was an idea of a like sudden-death
for first place that we would do it
again ten balls or something like that
or we could also have it just be that I
get three points Tyler gets two points
and so on or Tyler stays with the three
points and I get two points what do you
guys think I think everyone just didn't
expect me to get it so fast so they
weren't ready to hit stop but then they
were ready for Tyler and that's why we
went to the video this is in your guy's
hands post in the comments what we
should do who should get the points how
it should happen in first place one
second okay
in second place for the flag symbol
Douglas Harrison and in third place
dummies all right good turnout Philippa
let's go to the board so far we have a
tie for first top trailer fame on drink
Oh lets me and you boy it's like a place
there's a tie between team minica and
team Sam Oh
third place it is da beat with one point
and Tyler sex here we go
it was a it was a good match I came into
it being a little bit worried but after
saving Sam and everything I thought I
was pretty much done the thing is I got
I got a couple good throws off at the
start and I just got one to land early
on so
good morning everyone good morning
yeah currently at the school today this
morning I actually took both kids in the
stroller on a run we believe that I'm
gonna run in like a long time since my
last half marathon I have a plan really
it was really good it was hard but it
was fun huh
she slept mostly way and then I decided
well since we're up and going let's just
get out of house longer this is a pool
they just went in some water huh so this
hat did not fit here at the beginning of
summer an outfit sir it fits her now huh
and a pool baby except for her swimsuits

gents my girls got gold my girls got
coal that was such an amazing meet i
watched it live instead of at prime time
although I'll probably watch it at prime
time again put the gymnastics team got
your event of a whole gymnastics made of
the whole Olympics cuz like I watched
like their other meets - I'm kind of
obsessed it's kind of sad like I go on
youtube and watch like they're PNG
meets up there and they're like world or
watching that world sometimes I'm like
so invested and they won by eight points
usually it's by like 0.8 but it was it
was incredible this meeting never won
