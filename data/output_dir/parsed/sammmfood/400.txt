welcome to event one of the sama
Olympics am i peeking is the mic on
we are here at bean bag shop you will be
playing the cranium I have selected this
event will be playing ten events
throughout this time
it only takes twenty five cents to play
we get two dollars which is I'm doing
the math right eighth place all right
this is how you win if you get the most
you win it is a time you need two people
get two we go by the size of the plushie
let's go there you go okay
the thing about the crane game is a lot
of people say it's calculated that once
it reaches a certain threshold of money
it will allow you to win we'll see who
gets like this I'll be honest as a
semi-pro trained specialist this cranium
is terrible
like a crane is very lackluster how'd
she find it up to dollar at a time for
movie episode that first once I should
get one more okay I'll go they tasted
there's so much sugar in love but they
were amazing like that job so hot in
here
there is palpable those are mine stirred

he's that dog yeah I set that up crying
it was right up okay
I swear if you win this I will kill
myself

you this is a terrible claw that's
because it's like it's very tight I know
I've never won on this claw machine claw
game
I've won pretty much every real so this
is turn three okay if no one wins with a
dollar here we can go to a different
cloth dummy Denny's we did win a Denny's
about to be popular but have to try this
yeah each summer though he chose to do
dollar fire this doesn't even matter

if I get the right activity when I
pretty much went home I actually can
play I'm metal though I agree
I'm okay I will keep this drug forever
we should we should give out the items
to like people watching yeah yeah each
each person can suck something they want
to say when they think
right now I just figure the various
delivery
try to think was planning to go for it
there's too many options something like
a lot of ridges for your watching
Council horseshoes and hand-grenades
Tyler okay
I found something greater
my dribbling their focus the last on
that day the peak not one you got one
the thing is again like I have to go for
size it doesn't matter

have to psych you out because look she
can take second
that's if she's doing three to do it not
too low oh he's got
you are gonna McDonald's to get a double
stack in the door the best like no one

taking
