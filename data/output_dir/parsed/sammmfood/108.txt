PJ geez
so this is a first for me I'm learning
about the dependence there's places that
you can take your pins to if you drop
them off that like right there you pick
one you drop it off and then you can
basically trade you could drop any pin
there if you see one you like is that
right yeah there are unspoken rules like
don't trade limited editions for open
editions and vice versa but usually if
the pin isn't already on the board it's
a good deal as long as it's not paid you
have to walk after you watch out for
scrappers I didn't think about that I
don't I feel like I shaved it into this
I found some limited edition pins on
those that I dropped these little dinky
like hit and Mickey pins that I got for
like two bucks that's cool
I just drop them and then I build up my
collection yeah which one you got a
bunch on your jacket which ones like
your favorite well my favorites actually
not on my jacket I just got it but this
is a limited edition 300 Nightmare
Before Christmas doom buggy damn
engineering good still good got the
plastic on that wreath I got the bus
they go I'll be driven yeah this sells
for about 75 right now yeah I'm actually
really happy that I got it and there's
only 300 of them on the planet that's
cool well I feel like I might have to
get my
yes the YouTube channel go so if you
