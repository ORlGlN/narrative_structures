sunglasses I just didn't believe oh I
can't believe it we thought my little
brother was it was crazy because he
started raining I got three but like no
was not even three yet this is insane
look what I found at the store today
I've never seen this before I've only
seen the lime the lime extra flamin hot
regular flamin hot pops other types of
flamin hot but never have I seen
triple a ranch mr. taste test I posted
this on Twitter some people are
wondering how they taste
if anyone's wondering is not paid at the
sub Walmart well they're at interesting
Darrin they look good right here
and these will be less hotter hotter or
the same hot laptop not good hmm Yetta
have a couple like the first layman had
today
oh I don't smell a branch they're
definitely not as hot I don't know if
you're gonna like them don't expect a
tall one you take a bite there we go you
know if you want your kids that drink
their water just give him one of these
chips that is kinky there if they're
actually super hot I wouldn't have given
em alone but you want showing music boop
gun we're good it tastes weird
I would describe them as you know like
the jalapeno cheddar ones hmm they're
not flaming hot yeah like that's what
this is to me seriously if you love
ranch chips I think you'd like these to
be like spicy and any soy ranch but I
might like flaming hot just regular
chips more like they almost don't have
enough taste to me I don't know I gave
it a 6 nap at a time
Hey Baby Bear you like your helmet it
doesn't fall down thank you
make sure to look like a hard helmet
like a hard hat yeah yes
