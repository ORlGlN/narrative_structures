friends Oh dad four towers I don't hold
my hand today I used to come down here
and sit by the new building and play
pokemon go for like three to four hours
oh that was a year ago
just sit here that sounds like a few
years ago does only one day other
Pokemon oh right here right here
do you hear about the legendary one
coming out I do like the ring come on
Cali bad hope and thus we draw to the
end of another vlog one of the hardest
things about getting worked on at the
house is that the kids always want to
like be in here playing and I love it I
love that when I have something to do
it's fun to have them but the past
couple days have been kind of crazy
getting things done and Jen's been
amazing just getting them out of the
house so I can focus we have a lot of
big decisions to make one quick update
the rental house that was number one on
our list that we applied to and later
found out there were to be blood of us
the first applicant they went by like in
order the first applicant got it so so
now we are weighing the options versus
renting and buying there are some houses
that we really liked a lot of you guys
like the last house that we checked out
we love that one too
we'll talk about it more maybe tomorrow
but I'll probably have to fly out maybe
we'll go together I'm not sure we'll
have to figure something out
because we were planning on moving next
month and I have flight like even booked
out of Phoenix just one and it's with
Southwest I could always get it sold for
free but big decisions and the process
of like getting pre-approved and stuff
now will you talk about that more later
if you guys want me to and anyways we'll
see you guys tomorrow love you peace
good night ever
