we're so excited
the best-case scenario happened now fell
asleep really excited I've never seen
the Cubs win in Brazil none what a great
game I can actually see Jake the snake
is off the mound he's throwing strikes
Oh BAM we're driving to the game right
now
let's go Cubs Bert this will be Noah's
second a club team that he's been to the
generally wants to get a hat today this
is the construction that they're doing
remember this huge hotel in my area that
would be sweet
Noah you made it the greatest baseball
there's no place like home and there's
no place like Wrigley Field
ready
PJ is completely passed out right now
no you
the game
so when we first got to the game Noah
was kind of apprehensive he was like wow
there's so much happening you'll get
everything that's going on that I can
look at but I'm happy I'm happy
one of the cool things about the Cubs
games is that every seventh-inning
stretch they sing take me out to the
ball game yeah and they have a special
guest that does it today it was Eddie
Vetter from Pearl Jam who was a die-hard
Cubs fan
fun
Oh when I met price of the day was
actually getting this thing go Cubs go
because I've never gotten a singing and
really field before that's a song that
they played the game when the Cubs lives
this is the first time I've seen the
Cubs win at Wrigley
our favorite moment of the game was when
Wilson Contreras was called in to catch
in the last inning this is a cool moment
because he has been training and working
so hard his whole life for that moment
to play in the major leagues but he's
been just doing so well
the Cubs call him up it's his first game
he was actually gonna hit but there was
a double play before that so he didn't
and then they called his name and the
entire stadium was standing for him and
cheering for him and you can see his
face he was like it was amazing he can
just feel that made it everyone was so
excited
everyone was so excited for him it was
like oh very positive happy moment and
just a positive humanist thank you for a
minute and took his little thing off it
was just like looking around like I
would do that to be like is this serious
is this real life yeah he took out his
Kitchener passes like look around and
even the umpire shook his hand and
Andrew McCutchen is like the best player
on the Pirates he was an MVP in 2014 I
think he was just so into it
like all those moves were very like yeah
he stood up once and act like he's not
throw the ball and ever of the crowd I
would have gone in that locker room like
in the shower just like cried just cried
but am i selfish on Instagram it's
Spanish tonight because he posted
something in Spanish it was fun I love
everything about Wrigley even the foul
ball fans this is great we just parked
right here in this little alleyway we
went on this website and got a spot for
