four hours 41 minutes foot cut ko
oh gosh and we're all in the middle how
long day of travel can't wait to see our
family
look at that little nugget
it is baggy pants so cute
it's like pants are kind of a little bit
awkward on them right now cuz he's 12 on
cancer boy too small for the 18 months a
little baggy but that's okay
he's so cute and they're so bad daddy
daddy comes home today
I'm so happy to find some toys on the
ground so Sam comes home today but he
said he'd probably won't be home until
late tonight like after noise in bed
which is kind of sad but that's okay
y'all done nope
so we're just gonna go about our day as
usual and be excited when I gets here
I'm really excited to see him I missed
him
so drink binky why don't you tell lovely
people of the youtube world where we're
going right now it's a good day um I
realized it's Labor Day today cuz
everyone's posting Otis shirts of Labor
Day happy Labor Day guys every day if
you're in the u.s. for every something
me anyway so where I thought it'd be fun
to do something fun like get fun drinks
since Sam's not here to have pretty good
fun drinks he's really big in fun drinks
anyways we're gonna Sonic and get some
fun drinks to celebrate Labor Day and it
sounds delicious
I've only been there once and the one
time I did go I got a fun drink it was
the blue raspberry with nerds okay and
it was very sour
it made me pucker so I'm feeling I might
I might get that one again cuz it was
actually really delicious and really
refreshing and besides I want a
milkshake right or a slushie I'm totally
getting a slushie or a fizzy drink I'm
totally getting a slushie
I just don't know because there's so
many flavors and so many options I think
that's why in and out so successful
because there's not like a huge menu
it's literally like three different
types of burgers and then you can just a
Sonic it Sonic is very successful but
that's what that's what makes life
difficult when you have too many choices
sometimes you just got to keep simple
yeah or you gotta be fun like Sonic
where's my internet people where's my
Sonic people so we've arrived
I realize there's literally two seconds
away so we totally could a walk but you
know we know I haven't had the tater
tots but I've had at the popcorn chicken
that's what I got when I got my drink
master blast that is a tongue twister
say it 10 times fast
this is what I mean my choice is so in
this case you'll see in the next clip
well we just what are the pseudo
substance that's not see it happens to
everybody guys goodbye
fun fact we've actually mentioned this
before with that bench right over there
and this time yeah hold on we gotta get
them a good image of this okay people
see it for stamina I decided our wedding
date which was December 31st 2010
so basically New Year's Eve you know it
was New Year's Eve
so yeah that's where we decided right
there you're like you're like a Snapple
fun thanks oh yeah we decided to just
sit outside because it's so nice out
today and enjoy our refreshment in the
beautiful weather before I know we got
to get our native tans back losing them
yeah I moved to Utah yeah when I look to
Utah like six years ago I was David
coloring darker even and it's like in
Utah I'm like a bronzed I used to be a
lot more tan I have lost all my coloring
so get ready go become white and then
all the siblings will say here's how I
at every family event
okay I got a berry brownie blaster
milkshake out the battle comes master
black waffle cone and David got the
weirdest combo ever okay
blue raspberry slushy with pineapple how
is that weird
she thinks it's disgusting but she's
gonna try a sip and be like oh my gosh
you're a genius because that's delish
your entire first Harry Potter that's
delicious
that is absolutely delicious
it's a little bit tart
you know what those tater tots remind me
of at Lake Elementary did you go there
like Guillemette rings daily Sam Lake
Elementary you could get a side of tater
tots with your lunch and they serve
those types of tater tots these are way
better they're crispier that's for sure
so then the first scape work turned out
to be a masterpiece David one of their
old one he's gonna color all his retired
skateboard decks he snapped his other
one unfortunately the day he colored it
right you can color know what keep
coloring on there good job
bye that's some good coloring you're my
left hand sniffles oh no it doesn't
we've landed we're back in Utah the
weather feels amazing right now I think
the funniest part though is is that we
parked here and this giant lot really
extends far out into the distance these
guys three spaces away from us
good job guys how is that sweat yeah
it's it's funny because we both arrived
at separate times to the airport all
right we're home I haven't seen Noah or
Jen since when do we leave Fred Thursday

like five days wonder if Noah will still
remember me
I missed you

bath time let's go let's go let's go

sorry hurry
I wanted to send Jen flowers this
weekend but when I was looking at the
prices and things and delivery fees it
was kind of expensive and I hadn't
planned ahead well enough so now that
I'm home I got to replace these that are
kind of they still look nice but the
stems I kind of like smell and I got her
these ones instead whoops I cut the
stems a little too short this time but
they still look cool it was like the
perfect little vase for him I'm so
exhausted and tired I fell asleep
editing I fell asleep after editing I
just kept falling asleep but I did just
get the vlog up planted super light and
then it got rejected because it said I
had a similar ID which usually means you
upload the same follow you previously
did which wasn't the case so I had to go
upload again and I haven't checked yet
if it actually worked hopefully it did
but I did swing by I got the flowers and
I also got Jen stuff she loves this
movie she loved it so much when she saw
it in theaters so she'll have a nice
little surprise in the morning you guys
are probably like alright Sam
enough that's enough do you keep doing
these things these nice things for Jen
well the thing is is like they're not
that nice of things and if I don't do
them Jen's not gonna do them she never
treats herself so I'm the one that
always has to do it
and I kind of treated myself as well got
some chili round there and some little
some soups because I feel like I'm
starting to get kind of sick I went
vlogger fair and VidCon without getting
sick but it's always playlist live and
the plague the playlist live plague that
always hits me it always gets me I can
already feel like a sore throat so I've
been pounding the vitamin C I'm gonna
have some soup and I'm gonna go to bed
I'm excited to wake up tomorrow it's
good to be back home with Jenna Noah and
I can't wait to hang with them tomorrow
I'll see you guys then I'm gonna be
happy I'm gonna be good you better
believe it I'm gonna be happy I'm gonna
be good
get that understood I will be happy I'm
gonna be good you better believe it I'm
gonna be happy I'm gonna be good
get that understood
