wanted to give a shout out to Sikhi for
hooking us up with tickets dreams do
come true I'm here in Los Angeles at the
NLCS about to see my cubbies play people
often treat me and ask me how did you go
to that show how did you go to that
sporting event I thought it was hard to
get tickets or sold out that's where
something like SeatGeek comes into play
you can go ahead and go on their website
or go on their app and what they do is
they take tickets from all over the web
put them in a easy place to buy them
it's all simple you type in your event
you click on it you see it right there
the different dates you go ahead and
load it all up and there's going to be a
rating from 1 to 100 100 being the best
deal that you can get based on price as
you can see like the darker green
circles are a good deal you click on
that you can see the view of your seat
before you even go which is pretty
awesome really like that and then also
at the me tab on the app you can go
ahead and type in our promo code
sanika and you'll get $20 back on your
first purchase so BAM go check them out
