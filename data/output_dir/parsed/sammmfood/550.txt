there are a million things that I love
about Noah one thing that I really love
is how much he just loves different
types of food if you guys remember the
last time we went to noodles and company
I almost got food poisoning so they gave
us some coupons for some free food
we went there tonight Jen was feeling a
lot of lower back pain just wasn't
feeling too well and it was really good
it was like one of the best noodles
experiences we've ever had the funny
thing is is that Noah wanted to try to
eat the lemon and he actually like kind
of liked it lemon opps
that's our I've called sour my turn
okay
your honor
no one needs a gret number oh don't eat
that part no don't need the skin

seriously like started to try and eat it
and I like dude I don't I don't know if
he should eat that tomorrow is the first
day of gymnastics we were really excited
about that it's early in the morning
