good and it turns out that the person
that was serving them didn't even work
there like I read on Yelp there are only
four reviews because it's a brand new
spot and that just happened to us to

coffee here and they needed someone so I
just started working oh my kit was good

imagined growing up like it must be
terrifying to propose to someone what if
they say no but you pretty much know if
you're gonna get married by the time you
get to that point up there really
breathing
Jen's freezing she's freaking out she
says there's people with guns now I was
really nervous and I said that the ring
wasn't ready when it really was terrible
when it really was and we came here to
go to a movie I'm on the hill and I'm
freaking out right now anyways I told
her I had to go the bathroom and I
wanted her to come with me because I was
like I'm gonna propose up here I didn't
know what was up here but look how
beautiful this is
overlooking all of Salt Lake so I came
up here and I found this courtyard over
here this courtyard I mean just show you
really quick over there okay so we're in
there it's a little gusty over there so
we're not gonna go in there but that's
where I proposed I went to the bathroom
I came back out I said hey let's walk
around
we found a quiet place where we were
alone I know I mean II told the girl I
loved her I've never been so nervous to
ask a question
and I had her feel like my heart because
it was like pounding out of my chest
she was like starting to scream and I
was like well yes look is that it yes
