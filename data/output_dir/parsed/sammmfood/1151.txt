I can't remember so when you get a crepe

part you can't see us but we're walking
up the hill to go see Utah State first
to San Diego State and the basketball
game tonight same EO States ranked like
seventh I think shows a big game I don't
expect us to win but if we do it'll be
bananas wrong any wake up buddy the
games about to start
it's up if we have a Utah State Aggies
versus San Diego
aggi Pope is in the building
doors right there at the young man
he's right there because it's wearing
black cash

looks like a dude's wearing some nines

be at it was crazy the spectrum was so
loud
the fans were just going absolute
bananas seriously and as an Aggie fan it
hurt to lose that watching that game I
got respect for the way San Diego State
