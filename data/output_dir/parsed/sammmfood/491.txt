sister Hey
where did you have to dance a yes very
good that was really cool that was
awesome Tyler was so happy and excited
and surprised the only thing I was
lacking was a confetti cannon if I had a
confetti cannon when I walked in there
and thought it would have been amazing
but they you everyone that helped out a
ton of people have submitted this
picture to Tyler of something and he
wants to kind of make a video out of it
so I might swing by later tonight with
Noah and help him out with it and if it
all goes well it's going to be one of
the coolest things I've ever not only
cool video but cool picture
here's your black black
I'm just three bag the diaper of Noah's
it is so stinky the stairs the room
everything smells like okay I'll give
him that
but actually the time it takes the
gingers yeah it's hard it's all hard is
to just put your JP in the trash but
he's he's putting the trash quite
attached to Sam loves dead you know you
love daddy
is daddy your best friend oh there he
goes
he took a very long nap today about two
and a half hours maybe which is awesome
hopefully he does when he's up super
late
he's been so tired and cranky though so
he needed to sleep and there's a little
princess it's been snoozing for a while
too excused two sweetest little baby
yeah I know he keep saying that but so
true
nights have been going really well each
day I'm still like it's tonight gonna be
the night just give me the night where
everything changes and it hasn't changed
knock on wood wait she wakes up to eat
and goes back to sleep and then poops
can you shoot through your legs again
Noah shoot shooting through your legs
but the storm troopers say no really
once I got to come over and the cat
doesn't want to come over we're like
those dolls there's big me the Noah then
the stormtroopers and r2d2 you say
balloon Oh where's the one yep
which one whose favorite of the lemon
where where the giraffe uh-huh
boots yeah good yeah he said boots
yeah your shoes are cute let's see him
oh are those your slippers from aunt
Christie oh you love those huh you know
you see the word cat well no that's a
carrot say cat
that's his favorite word right now Apple
this is the same position that Noah
enjoyed sleeping in we call this
touchdown touchdown sleeping actually
kind of seat that way too
looks comfy to me for some reason
hey how do you sleep good
show me how you sleep so how you sleep
so
moving into a new house what's that is
like dreamy and wonderful as you'd think
it would be well just things go on cuz
it's a new house they don't know what's
working what's not working in yeah and
we're kind of in like a weird situation
because we are renting this house we
didn't buy it so it's like not our house
so like sometimes we're doing things
that we maybe shouldn't be doing like
not bad things but taking care of things
you know I mean so it's kind of
frustrating by the way she just sat in
my arms and watch the entire Cubs game I
sleep actually so she didn't watch it
she slept through the entire game oh but
their questioning has am i working and
I've been contacting people and trying
to figure it out it turns out that uh
yeah I guess the people that put the
siding up had put a hole in this pipe so
the coolant and everything was gonna
just leak out and I think that gets
pretty dangerous yeah yeah yeah kind of
scary I don't know too much about it but
the guy finally figured it out and cut
out the blocks today and they're still
here so like I said so no awkward
situations because it's not our house so
it's like if it was my house I just like
oh yeah I'm gonna fix it but I have to
like talk to my landlord and tell her
this is what happened what do you want
to happen ah it's a silly problem but
with the new baby it's like come on oh
but hey I can feel the air feel the urge
in cold feels good we need we need good
air before it's summer especially with
these two kids no get so hot and no baby
yeah I do kind of get sweaty wait how's
she doing did she just eat yes how much
did she do you think she eats more or
less than Noah less less less often or
less amounts I feel like she might eat
more more in a sitting right
like two ounces every hour and a half so
would you say she's been easier to
breastfeed yes and no I don't know
chunky spit-up mm-hmm so she spits up
more than Noah so far yes because they
would never stop
hi the only time I held her today was
like three hours because I was pretty
much with Noah mostly because he's been
that crazy man today it was like odd day
off day on day and he was good with her
he really was good with her she's like
he's fine in the morning he's great with
my mom and then the second he's he's one
of us it's like freak out look I know
he's like Oh time for me to like
I haven't put him antennae out like
twice and he was like good about it and
he said sorry and under so he did but
it's he's a toddler and you know it's
like lashing out because he wants to you
know the baby
yeah okay well have those days yeah at
least for the most part I'll be here
right yeah yeah and she's been angel
baby still just unbelievable put her
down later it's like 10 o'clock were
actually getting in bed before is like
midnight everyone I'm gonna go get some
air conditioning filters and some
vitamin D and bananas and other things
