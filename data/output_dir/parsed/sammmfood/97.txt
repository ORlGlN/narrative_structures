to be back
one month after moving that's good and a
lot of my friends say they're gonna come
visit us so they'd better actually do
that and stick to it
we're staying at the same hotel though
that we say that for CVX live two years

it on the plane no swords and what else
yeah you can't really Minsk just a
singular mask put that near backpack huh
so PJ you ready to head home yeah I
could go for a swim it's kind of funny
because the weather while we've been
here has been 42 degrees and freezing
rain and then as we leave it's actually
get a little bit warmer to go back to
60s maybe it's 70 but it's just kind of
funny at Ike we came back here and
mother nature was telling us
we don't want you here go back to your
warmer weather just reminded us kind of
one of the reasons why we wanted to move
in away it's because we wanted an
experienced former climate so pretty
funny how that worked out Wow

microwave with USB and power I've never
seen that before

feeling good we think PJ may have eaten
something bad I don't know we had
Mexican food for dinner you got a kid's
meal and PJ's only one that ate part of
that know what wasn't really feeling it
