people hate it oh okay some people loved
reptile or hated the Martian have you
seen a Martian I thought it was
phenomenal like he didn't hate it he
just didn't love it 45 minutes okay the
time keeps growing it's like 15 it was
good my problem with movies though is
like he becomes too much they invited

that they feel my empathy is just like I
am Matt Damon stress how that was pretty
cool it was good I thought it was great
