no cheating
whoa whoa
what is this a choo-choo
talk about leader
but we're here we're at the airport
gonna be on the new plane soon
me
we make it a crazy play I'm gonna talk
about that a little bit
Noah's passed out he's in the cars or
his stroller so it's PJ well she's awake
we gonna go get our bags so now we're
going to see my sister hopefully oh she
was a unicorn head on
oh my god I fell asleep no yeah
Christie airplane I haven't showered or
gotten dressed yet today yesterday we
made it the crunchy house it's been a
crazy travel day and it's my fault
sometimes sometimes you make very
serious critical mental mistakes
sometimes those mistakes passed you like
$600 and make you feel terrible but I
really feel like we did all right this
is what happened I booked this flight
with Christie on the phone oh wow a long
time ago and I had it all set up for
this date I made sure because it was the
day after Noah's birthday I think I just
continually looked at flights that I
somehow ended up hopping into July
because when we showed up to the airport
today they said no your flights booked
for July 28th and not today
so after going over all of our different
options and just what we should do next
even just renting a car and driving out
here we just got the flight and we're
here and I feel like an idiot
I've booked so many flights the crazy
thing about this too is that I've had
the weirdest and strangest feeling about
this flight so much that I've called the
airline twice to make sure everything
was right because we we didn't get a
confirmation email which probably really
threw me off I wonder if I could
actually get money back because I never
got a confirmation email
you know you always get one when you
book it oh so so a couple like a week
ago I was like where's my foot I don't
know my confirmation email is I was
searching my bank statements and saw the
charge and I was like okay it's booked
then I called the airline and they're
like yeah you're all set
anyways for a while there I was like
maybe this isn't a fight we're supposed
to be on he noticed like those crazy
thoughts you get like is this plane
gonna go down oh my goodness that's the
thing there was so much turbulence
probably the most turbulence of ever
experienced on a flight that way and
back that I was like maybe we shouldn't
be on this plane we made it safely
we made it safely we're gonna go pick up
I'll have some ice cream
it's called do people say a random word
and then the goal is just get to the
same word without and you just keep
saying different words but you try to
meet like for example my friend and I I
said her and she said snake Medusa
Medusa would be it's obvious hi brown
what was the word salad and I'm all up
in Smith
scallop and escargot he is close that is
close
okay what are they both part of no wait
wait okay okay wait nuts all-seeing
muscle I should just this team I think I
think all of and I could be better

see the garden hmm I see it I see the
garden whose all duck it's beautiful the
garden look this one almost looks ready

start showing at the top brightly yeah

pull that when it wouldn't be very big

same here

disaster I mean stuff girl oh oh wait I
thought this is a piece that's not a
piece that helps it stay up there this
beautiful collard greens this whole
thing with cod greens which is why you
don't see anything because we eat it but
then the very next day like the leaves

touch anything okay and he'll rip it off
just smell okay see the color right here
