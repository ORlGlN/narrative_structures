like Disneyland Disney World inside this
house sometimes when that happens the
kids get too much Mickey in this case no
around like 5 o'clock was just gone
crazy crazy crazy crazy too much Mickey
he needed a nap you just fell asleep on
the couch it's up for about 30 minutes
woke up for dinner
everything was grand then we decided to
catch a Hachem oh well when he gets out
there we can teach him how to walk and
stuff yeah I think he's blue yeah
I'm gonna make a standalone like short
video about that I thought I did really
slim for people that were looking for a
way to hatch a hatch a mole for
Christmas time anyways then when it was
bedtime I thought everything was going
well but he randomly decided that he
didn't want to sleep tonight even though
you're super tired I thought like he was
being bad he just wanted to talk and
walk around and sneak out of the room
and not sleep tonight
so finally at 11:47 p.m. hours past his
bedtime he fell asleep then Jen's not
feeling too well I had just had some
ghost pepper ruffles her tips so I went
downstairs cuz my breath stunk and I
need to brush my teeth before I got in
bed and then I hear a little bit of
coughing gent confirmed that PJ threw up
little mac and cheese noodles from
dinner and I'm cleaning up throw up I'm
not washing the sheets and I feel like I
have been running around and just busy
and crazy being a parent all day and now
it's 1:00 a.m.
cleaning the sheets and
hopefully we get some sleep tonight
hopefully it's not like I don't know
what's going on with pj she has a little
bit of mucus and then my sister from New
York has been sick and they're coming
here and that's like Jen's biggest fear
is throw-up
especially for the holidays she's been
dreading the thought and possibility of
this for months and it's like happening
so Connecticut temps get tense good
times but we did have a great date today
we had fun and hopefully everyone's
feeling well tomorrow bye see you guys
tomorrow
peace
