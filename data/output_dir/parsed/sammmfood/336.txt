sorry dad you know in this opinion it's
been me and mommy
Samson Noah and its really really funny
but I can't spin since I wanted to try
but I can hear no I'm scared
you're not like sliding down
I get up and run over that fun someone
woke up from their nap clenching
clenching the she slept a bit are you
excited for Christmas buddy
yeah no I'm talkin a targeted Noah no as
I've been sleeping with the target
catalog because when I went and checked
the mail yesterday I said it was for him
all right
game two is under way I tweeted that
last night our bats will be back and so
far it's one to nothing so it's better
than last night the thing that gets me
through these games and my nerves is
Noah wants to play catch let's play
baseball during the game so I'm able to
watch and do both and it's great it's
great sure baby
what a story guys this is like a Disney
movie this dude are you okay what
happened Oh baby it's four to nothing me
and Penelope are home alone right now
cuz Noah and Jenica are at the store now
trying to figure out some last-minute
Halloween costume things I think we
finally we've had two ideas we were so
set on and we just changed it to a third
idea now and it sounds like that's what
we're going with
so they're all good ideas they're all
related to things that Noah's into right
now and good stuff for Penelope
I pictured last night kind of go on
though it did and then tonight's going
how I pictured it too so walked in a run
baby yeah baby yeah seemed it's like
what happened to them last night almost
I mean different ways but somewhere
score this is called real life I'm a
parent even win the World Series on we
got some cool bath art look at that go
Cubs you gonna draw anything else one
more out and it's tied and we're going
home for three games at Wrigley one more
hat oh is that Kerry Wood dummy Cubs
legit
three more three more to go three more
to go
just hold on we're going home baby going
to Chicago we can do it that's
California this is awesome
Jenna's usually in charge of the kids
clothes I like to focus on the
activities on the plane although she
does help it that as well Dennis the
girl's mom ever since getting smudged
already oh man I gotta clean that up I
need you like a protector for that cuz I
feel like I can already see you smudge
tomorrow we're leaving
on our flight it is about a two and a
half hour flight there I think
three-hour flight back I think that's
cuz I the wind travels and different
variables like that someone out there
knows what I'm talking about
anyways this is what I got for Noah well
first let's see what we got for Penelope
to help her on the flight
Jenna has a slew of different toys and
things but this might be easy I'll just
show you like this we got some banana
raspberry brown rice I was about to say
ice apple and carrot some water banana
raspberry brown rice as well and carrots
banana pumpkin so I think she only have
like two of these but we have a bunch of
backups those are some easy food options
for her for Noah we have apples because
apples take forever to eat so he can eat
that for like 30 minutes and be occupied
he is obsessed with applesauce
so we Adams and applesauce this is like
the backup backup plan if things are
really going wrong plus I like the candy
but if you want to do candy you got to
get something that takes a while to eat
- this will take about 30 minutes 20-30
minutes a nice caramel apple pop there
how much sugars in that 10 grams so
actually not terrible for Noah but
there's that then we'll have water and
crackers and other snacks
he really likes peanuts right now
especially throw in the shell
I don't think we'll
those on the plane but they do pass out
peanuts so that's cool is this bright is
this too bright
there we go it's funny last walk my
voice got higher towards the end of the
walk I think it says I changed the
framerate I don't know anyways and then
this is the activities that I got I just
got a text message see these are the
activities for the plane that I chose so
you can you see that mess free this is
color wonder so they're like invisible
ink but they come out colors kind of
thing and it's all in the chemical to
the paper Thomas the Tank Engine easy
absolutely I love that this is the one
that I think he's really gonna love I
got the mess free frozen he's obsessed
with Elsa and AMA right now I just can't
get enough or frozen he just thinks
they're beautiful we always have a
sketch pad so we have a sketch pad and
then we could find our crayons we think
we left them in California so I got
these twistable crowns they're only a
dollar at Walmart focus oh there there
let me a dollar I'm all that stuff's
pretty cheap and will keep them occupied
and then in the toy activity department
if we you know dire need of something
well if a car that we can open blow Hot
Wheels pretty cool and then we got two
of these mini choo-choos
those would be like backup backup but
things aren't going too well maybe I'll
save that for the flight back but you
know I always have to have a couple
tricks up your sleeve I think we also
bring his air plate on the thing that I
don't like about stuff like this on the
airplane is that he'll want to play with
it and actually the drawing stuff - who
won't like this table down and then he
starts like pushing on the seat and I
I'm always trying to be careful the
people that sit in front of us because I
know how annoying that can be and I know
I mean some people should have more
patience with them but still gotta be
respectful that's our plan for tomorrow
so far hopefully it goes well
I'm sure I will record some clips in the
plane letting you guys know
wait I can't let anyone see what you're
holding oh it's a special item for what
was it the diaper yeah Oh
shout out to Diane for coming through
for my Halloween costume that's a big
hint to you guys that's the only hit I'm
gonna get give you guys I think you guys
could figure it out pretty easily
actually it does have a couple costumes
but I'm pretty excited about Halloween
pretty excited know it loved being on
the bus and just was so excited he was
counting it down super excited be on the
plane he's chugging this juice wait why
is he checking this juice where are we
oh where are we done
