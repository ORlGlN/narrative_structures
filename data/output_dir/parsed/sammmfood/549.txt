us are up early and in the car and ready
to go we're going to gymnastics now
let's first a master's class and he woke
up very happy this morning he's been
really happy yeah I know worried that he
would be like cranky because he woke up
a couple times last night just coffee
and I went in at like 4 a.m. 4:30 so I
thought he would be like super cranky
but he's good it's good to go that's fun
we're excited I'm glad he's doing well
today and not feeling sick or anything
