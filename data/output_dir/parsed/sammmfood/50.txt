yelling at us

yeah for the most part except for birds
that you guys n see I always get so
frustrated that you pay all this money
for a picture and the experience and you
can't even capture it on your camera I
was like subtly trying to film
throughout it and people kept getting
mad and I understand that in the past if
we paid for the picture they were
usually cool to it you know but I just
don't like it when people break
character too you know Sam but John was
good and she complied every year meeting
