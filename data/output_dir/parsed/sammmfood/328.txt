so the past couple days / weeks Jenna
Jenna had a concern so far our life as
far as our family is gone it's been
we've tried to really like plan things
out and it hasn't been like bop
bop-bop-bop
but we've had no surprises right right
let's put it this way we really wanted
to have a baby no I was born we really
wanted to have another baby
vanellope was born didn't come as a
shock to us past couple weeks Jen's like
I think I might be pregnant
why it's because birth control I'm on I
their I don't just don't know because I
don't I finally went to the story I
actually was like you might who knows
basically like you're really nervous
because we feel really comfortable as
parents right now
but we're not ready to have another
child no we want to enjoy our time with
Penelope and Noah and be ready when it's
time and sometimes you can't control
that sometimes you can't control that
and we're super grateful for everything
that we have in life and we really I
mean we aspire and have goals for you
know more things in our family and
things like that
anyways Jen took a pregnancy test and as
you can see here the one the one line
means that pregnant I was ready for you
to say you're pregnant
what is mentally preparing myself
because Jen's like if I'm pregnant I'm
gonna cry and it's not because I'm like
super happy and so in my head is like a
few here yeah like you never know I
don't think she's pregnant but you never
know it could happen what am I gonna say

5:00 and so have I pretty much but I'm
actually feeling well rested because I
fell asleep last night at 8:00 you also
have to calculate daylight savings and
all this it's great to have daylight
savings when you're also changing time
zones the same day it just like
completely throws everything off and
people with kids know that kids do not
take into account daylight savings they
don't that's not a part of their thing
they have their internal clock so
they're gonna wake up no matter what
time it is so last night after no is
