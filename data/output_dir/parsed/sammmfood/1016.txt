last night we posted birth flog it was
at midnight our time really late for
some of you guys those of you that
stayed up and watched it yeah they're
awesome
I was reading some the comments before
going to bed and editing that vlog woo
it was emotional for me it's I'm just
flooded with all the feelings and
emotions that I felt in that moment and
it's insane but I'm so glad that we have
it yeah why don't you add to its like I
honestly was thinking and feeling so
many things in that watching it just
like brings us back yeah so it's hard
for me afterwards I'm like transported
back into that I watched I had to go in
because I just needed us kiss him and
hug him he's so cute
he's still got here o night a little
light in his eyes I'm gonna go change
him if you haven't seen the video yet
its posted I know I posted it a terrible
time a lot of people probably skim over
and not see it but it's up so check it
out it's 38 minutes long
I think it's paced well enough that it's
not like oh my gosh this is 38 minutes
long I think you'll enjoy the whole
thing
it's ooh I edited it really fast but I
loved it 8:01 bien kind of a quicker
vlog today we just kind of get our feet
back under us as far as things go half
of the footage we shot yesterday was
just us filming Noah being like oh
you're new baby so I kind of cut a lot
of that out it's funny when we named him
Noah I thought of the Bible character
but that's like why we named him we just
liked the name and someone mentioned
that his little crib is like Noah's Ark
with all the animals inside I thought
that was pretty
yes anywho we're gonna try and get our
vlogs back on a better schedule you know
just the routine thing like we're doing
before John's feeding know right now and
babies
Casey live ears at once the new babies
they just eat sleep and poop dude's got
so much gas I I don't want to say you
got it from me but it's been such a joy
learning more about being a parent these
past couple days and I know we're just
getting started a lot of you guys to be
like oh man you're in for a treat
no sleep this and that I'm pretty happy
again we were really going into this
with like a positive attitude and it's
made all the difference so far and we
can't wait to continue to learn and have
more memories to make with this guy and
our future kids gosh I was thinking the
other day I was like I love this guy so
much how am I going to love another kid
and then another kid and then another
kid but seriously crazy I feel like I'm
learning more about life every single
day so thanks for joining us guys we
