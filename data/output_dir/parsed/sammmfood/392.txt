today we're doing the watermelon
challenge where you throw a playing card
get it to land anywhere within the
confines of the watermelon throwing it
from 8 feet away and will be your first

hanging everything is rolling we are
ready to go okay great
and what if we all right three I feel
like I'm telling you we might need my
slippers

actually hit it should be that that
difficulty I don't even event I think
it's the cars are kind of funny these

jeez dude Oh pin card it shouldn't be
that difficult card 33rd 31:13 or 31 31
13 all right Jenny ko is up next 25
cards
I might die but I'm kind of I feel like
I'll be here it's more of a finessing
we thought we were kind of unfair to
Aaron and that he maybe had not thrown
all 25 of his cards so we let him throw
a couple more cards when actually he
threw 25 the first time can you take me
do this 2 throws for gold
money and I like that they're drawing
down BC for me to move support keep
going that's the support that's just
keeping it up are you see

like I mean it didn't look like it was
gonna happen this is what happened last
time
