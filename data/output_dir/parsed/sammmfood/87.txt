that's Justin this Justin gotta baby
I've been spending a lot of time on the
couch at night lately huh I feel like
every single buck this could just be the
same thing you guys don't even know it
my heart will either be broken or I will
scream and dance for joy in the next
couple of minutes because we are one out
away from advancing out of the NLDS
future cub Bryce Harper married in the
same exact place that we got married
San Diego temple yeah same place Chris
Bryant he could put this out and I would
not be happy at all I know and if there
is such a thing as baseball gods he's
gonna hit it out he's trying to your
blood pressure oh my god so just Bryce
only Bryce everyone only because you
wanted only because I want Bryce on my
team oh gosh
you don't understand how grateful I am
because I was going to live with a very
upset man for a week
seriously these kids cancel this baby
coming out she was supposed to be
induced last night at 3:00 a.m. still
pregnant they said we're full
what how many people go into labor on
the very same day when I went to labor
no one was there
well this is like I think that's like
the most popular there's almost every
dollar delivers their baby
all baby my gosh and I just can't
believe what she is like her water
hasn't broken nothing no contractions
but one maybe maybe she's still she's
just like does not want to come out cuz
they said well if you're in labor then
you can come in but since we're inducing
you you can't come in I think I'm more
frustrated than she is she's fine she's
fine
I'm ready to cut a little baby boy took
a little chunk chunk chunk no chocolate
baby but we tell the name enough eats no
we want told maybe 18 plus years of
raising this child they have a name
though do you approve of the name you
like the name yeah now she might come
out and you were gonna be like baby just
so I don't change the name maybe you can
still add 18 right
I don't know you can take 2 whenever you
want whenever you want just people it
right look I tried changing my first
name to snowing in there and there's you
have to go to the court to do it yeah
this whole time this whole friendship
I've thought that she spelled her name
with a K because we were it guys like
she told me that we were it guys yeah
yeah but she insisted and she never told
me that
so manually I'm lying
bender hearts is hung the truth but in
my heart I'm like hair styler w baby fly
