gonna die because it's relatively new at
the grocery store they just started
carrying it but it's so good I got it
once oh my goodness okay babies hi oh
I've been wearing summer dresses like
every day I only have four then I just
recently got like just keep re-weighting
them it's at the hand wash and I don't
want to like ruin them so I'm just like
getting as much use out of them before I
actually have to like hand wash them
that weird the flick dresses don't good
like as xxx pants - I don't know anyway
that was a random less random I don't
even need to talk about that I tried to
put regular clothes on but then I
literally want to rip them off I'm going
to dress back on because it is so
lightweight and like flowy like good
cool off faster
I still feel constricted in pants and
shirts now like oh the dress thing is
grown on me I like and literally want to
go to the store and buy them all in
different colors like I want to go back
to the store buy the same ones I have in
whatever other players they have at the
store and then go to another store and
buy all of the dresses there so I'm just
wore a dress every single day that works
