so we are headed to a baseball field
right now and it's pretty crazy because
Noah has gotten really good at the bike
already and whenever an adult or anyone
sees them they're like whole dizzy
that's amazing I'm so fast man
where dreams come true
Noah and our little neighbor friend both
were on start with the Strider bikes and
I look at this they're both riding two
wheelers and they after each other
I just learned today and she's already
picked it up so well currently on this
quest Rover
happy Memorial Day everyone today
started out great
PJ didn't want to where she refused to
wear her diaper out here oh gosh no go
to me to wipe her always all looks bad
I've been like four fever to keep his
diaper on but when she doesn't have like
clothes on her diaper Susan tripartite
prophetess be completely naked yeah I
knew I knew shouldn't keep you like keep
your hand secret I so many times but
then just let her take it off because
she kept doing anyway
Noah has a swimsuit on but PJ does not
she is just in the nude right now and I
just caught poop hanging from her bum so
calmly look at all this fun stuff I
bought I just go back from the store and
also I took I got a few clips before I
went about nothing included or not I was
able to go pick up some little old
pinwheels for my friend Caitlin's little
babies so one took them a little
thinking blue pinwheel and then I was
able to get the kids some summer stuff I
got a little pools and chop and squirt
guns a little floaties for six I
couldn't find I'm really bummed Sam's
Club doesn't sell the same one that Noah
has anymore I knew I should've gotten
like another one last year when I got to

his legs were just too chunky to sit I
got also got this cool bat with like
water balloons and you like hit the hit
the balloons like like baseballs

I'm small well those are big burgers
yeah they're like really thick general
saying that she went to the store and
all the burgers are pretty much sold out
because
Memorial Day is a big grilling holiday
over here so the guy in front of my I
can feel like he just pressed he had a
little head job and I come out back yeah
so we cooked up some burgers having our
own little feast out here having a good
time we haven't seen this grill and
forever I think since we were in Salt
Lake just how to put away not the best
it's an electric one and it like just
doesn't stay hot enough so cooking for a
lot of people we've just used the stove
lately having they've had a good day
here's our feast
my mind is lovely baby

wonderful we give and a great day today
it's definitely a sorry feel off one of
my favorite days that we spent Anna's
today yeah Wow we're still friends back
bang bang yeah it's kind of sad because
we keep making lots of friends in the
neighborhood and just around town always
happens like right when you're about to
leave
are you more opt for like you're more
open cuz you're leaving I don't know I
just feel like it takes I feeling it
takes people a year or in a
year-and-a-half to like become really
acquainted with other people away
sometimes no Cernik every place we've
gone to we start like really making
plans until we're about to leave which
is like a year later so I'll definitely
miss this neighborhood it's a great
neighborhood
maybe it's like getting better and
better yeah crazy it's been really fun
I'm grateful that Noah that we all got
to live here it's been a good experience
and I'll definitely still have some time
here I like we said we're gonna got a
ton of things but well the summer's
gonna be really fun because there are
some kids that are being really good to
