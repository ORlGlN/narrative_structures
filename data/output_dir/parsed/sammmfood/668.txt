I'd flirt a little because I'm really
motivated I think we're at least two to
three times a week which has been good
I've been feeling better it's been
really good I'm glad that now this would
put a little extra pep in my step to go
cuz I'll have a little some cute shirts
to wear now I got them a little bigger
so that they may be eventually cover the
baby belly cuz when I was pregnant with
Noah in school I was in workout classes
and my shirts didn't quite cover the
belly so I just wore like big t-shirts
and so every time I did like jumping
jacks or something one I'd have to pee
into my hope my belly would be hanging
out it was really funny now we're
heading to another Halloween store cos
they're fun really they're just fun to
go in and we like seeing all the
costumes last night but I'm not gonna
say this it's like a giant out of that

dream
