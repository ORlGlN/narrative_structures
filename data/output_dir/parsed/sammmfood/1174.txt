she's our glass of water you'll ever see
put it next to your face dad
it's our last full day in California
everybody and we're sad about it we're
about to leave Mission Bay Hill at my
mom's and helped my dad's and then stay
with some cousins Napa Valley before we
head to Utah tomorrow and then school on
Monday so I have a problem when we go on
road trips if we're driving I feel like
I like have to be you know Boy Scout
always prepared you ready for any
obstacle I mean I even have everything
you can think of because you always have
to be prepared so luckily for myself you
know he's me that car yeah disaster back
here luckily we have a ton of room to
spread evening up for Christmas my
sister got us baby outfit this one's if
you have a boy and this one's if we have
a girl but I think I'll probably just
keep both I could pull this off even if
it's a girl right
oh it's so nice of her this one's really
cute it's in there growing crazy they'll
be able to wear that one day yeah see
you tomorrow true life of AP logging in
the closet hey guys I'm coming out
wrap that's a wrap okay we're starting
to head north and this is another reason
why California is maybe not the most
ideal place to live right Jen right
traffic sucks
seriously this is like no we've been in
traffic for the past like hour not even
going that far it says we're going to
take it's gonna take like 20 minutes to
get to our next place and I don't even
think it's that far it's not it's only
supposed to be an hour and a half away
yeah tails yeah I like you California
but not this part no thank you you did
you see that ramp right there yeah yeah
yeah we were supposed to get off over
here one time like last time we were
driving down here and made her actually
on that ramp and
but I don't think it was funny for all
parties involved because some people are
such that up there on that huge ramp not
on our exit that's not fun we lived and
we went because now we're good oh so
sorry ma'am glass of water you'll ever
seen for the next year face bad that's
what they never have to refill it it's
not just the glass glasses that are
large if everything this is a small
salad this is one side of french fries
and this is a side salad with a burger
and it's huge
I'll finish laughs my dad's had the flu
and it's done
I should have shared yours
we're good
yeah it's not even the end of winter
vacation and I'm sad I'm excited for the
next semester but I'm saying
it's always hard leaving vacations in
general and family I can't wait until
heaven if I make it and that all the
family is just a little bit close to
each other you just see each other
whenever yeah always everyone's
everywhere
today nowhere happened to drive all the
way to California although we'd probably
get sick of each other pretty quickly
nothing is to get people in that I don't
think you have those feelings anymore
yeah it's true that's true
good there will be a grand day it'll be
a great to not be in this car anymore
and to be in my own bed
yep whoa wait blog late upload stop to
my sisters

remembered but wherever
