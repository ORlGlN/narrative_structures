can't believe it I want to see him
celebrate hey we did it you can't even
see or maybe here but guys know I was
really tired he's gonna fall asleep in
like two seconds he was kidding in his
clothes but I'm like the Cubs are going
to the World Series it's happening it
feels like we won something because we
did it's such a big accomplishment and
when I have never seen in my life and
many people I've never seen in their
lives super excited we're driving back
to Utah tomorrow we're gonna stay with
Matt and Haley again then we're gonna
head home we're gonna be home for just a
couple days and then probably fly to
Chicago we've booked flights months ago
ones that you get cancelled for free
because why not you know it's these
moments there's so much fun and I don't
think we would have even think about
really doing it if we didn't have family
in the locations we've been going to
like being here and then going home to
Chicago I thought about starting a
GoFundMe cos a couple people at treating
me like I started GoFundMe get you to a
game it just feels a little selfish with
how expensive the tickets are and then I
was like well we could use shirts and
make it so like the shirt money goes to
to give of that the tickets the game are
really expensive I just don't feel like
that's the right way to spend money as
far as like someone in my situation you
know that's money we could save toward
something so right now I'm going to see
if I can pull anything off hopefully I
win the ticket lottery by the Cubs
hopefully I get lucky some way when some
sort of competition maybe someone watch
this vlog and work with that movie I
don't know probably won't happen but I'm
gonna do my best to get some tickets
the
the thing is like it'd be really sad to
just get one ticket or spend money on
one ticket and go by myself I feel like
because part of it is experiencing that
with Jen and with my family and if I do
end up somehow getting one ticket I mean
like that's huge but we'll see what
happens
fingers crossed Sports highlight of 2016
in a world filled of chaos and all sorts
of crazy things this has been a
highlight as far as worldly things go so
thanks for watching today's buck we'll
see you guys tomorrow
yeah peace
Noah has become one with the watering
hole yeah yeah there was no stopping him
from getting in that fountain
that's for sure hey crawling underneath
you bonk are you okay
careful
