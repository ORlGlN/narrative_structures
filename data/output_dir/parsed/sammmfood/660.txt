hello there I'm currently listening to
the Cubs game on the radio during that
old school radio thing it's actually
kind of enjoyable except for the fact
that we're losing tonight we are filming
hopefully two videos here there's Tyler
can you see him right there there's a
drone can you see it right there
we're gonna be filming a pumpkin-carving
video and also a haunted maze video it's
a little late Suns already kind of
setting and with everything that Noah's
going through he and Jen are actually
not here so hopefully we get the shots
that we need
I wish I had my drone I need to update
you guys on my drone it's actually out
of commission right now the rotors or
the motors got so hot that they burned
through the plastic so I'm waiting to
get it fixed but should be a fun night I
want to go to a maze with Jenica later
we'll have to do that next week well
this will be a nice way to kind of segue
into fall and Halloween and then that's
the corn maze live feed from the drone
his face when he sees airplanes is just
the best thing in the world
it's just like pure joy like oh my my
son no did you see it did you wave to it
Aaron the cat whisperer at the same time

don't want to go in oh are you kidding
