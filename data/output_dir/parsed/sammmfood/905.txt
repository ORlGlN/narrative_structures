just got my haircut again I feel like I
just got a cut but it didn't get cut
sure enough I guess my banks were
getting crazy my hair was getting afro a
we so I got it caught and I'm gonna go
see if I could find anything for Jen to
wear at playlist live which is kind of
funny because why am i shopping for Jen
well Jen just doesn't like getting stuff
for herself so I'm gonna go look for
something let's go ended up getting
something for myself but Jen said she'll
be back tomorrow I called her
so we'll see if she gets something we
have an issue in our relationship
Jen and I in that I am the stereotypical
girl in my spending habits while Jen is
the complete opposite I can go to the
store and buy something I can go get
some food I will buy a steak here and
there as a treat I treat myself Jen on
the other hand feels guilty about it
anything she ever buys anything no even
when it's like baby food so I really
went to the store to kind of look for
things for Jen I found things I was
trying to call her when I was in the
stores and she never picked up so
instead I looked like a creepy man
looking at girls clothing whenever
someone came to me I was like oh I'm
shopping for my wife so it's kind of
awkward but I did get some things for
playlist live should I do a little
fashion show that's really cute
that's really cute too hot I like it
well it's so good for we live in Utah so
yeah I like it
he's cute I like that better on the man
I think it's cute I like that shirt
makers fries I like that one I like that
one more than the other one no I like
that one a lot new boards so that one's
good to keep that one that's nice what

youtubes and my pack is a shirt that I

Oh mom I'm just a bill oh yes a regular
bill and I'm sitting here on Capitol
Hill School of Rock I love it I can't
honestly can't remember where it is
I'm just the bill we also ran TV show
and I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill I
think I just shows how old you are
really I don't think half of our viewers
will know what that is
you know what Schoolhouse Rock is let us
know I know the name I just don't what's
your favorite Schoolhouse Rock episode /
song / whatever video let yours
understand that kept low high so I loved
that song for some reason I love to
watch some with you now okay this
comment of the day is clever funny and
great McKenna
says if I had that fridge I would hide
all of my favorite foods in that secret
part and deny that it existed why is
there a button on the fridge handle oh
it's just for decoration it's not like
it opens the secret compartment full of
chocolate and my other favorite foods
that sounds like a brilliant plan I'm
right there with you right there with
you also know its favorite toy is the
remote battery we take the battery out
so that he can't change the channel turn
it on seriously starts hitting the
volume button starts blasting everything
is that your favorite toy buddy so I'm
ending the vlog a day later

on the ground at 9:30 p.m.
