mountains who's talking

definitely looks pretty but when you
think about what that dog is it's kind
of so nasty I was looking at the
mountains today and they were
disgustingly foggy and gross and in
Virginie yeah seven bears like 20 times

justice this guy is like red and it's
just showing one strip of orange yeah I
feel like Kay is like the official way
of saying we cut hair and not okay
anything else that's cu t that's not
creepy at
hey guys I'm bad probably looks like
we're always out eating going on some
even ever make food out
and the truth is we just got a lot of
good parents so we haven't really had to
spend money on any of this present I
like playing games on the vlogs guessing
games okay if you guys had to guess what
ethnicity Jenica is where is she what is
her ethnicity my ethnicity comes through
a little bit more when my hairs pulled
up she just said right now she's like I
look very uh I look very ethnic right
now because I do wear a shirt up I look
at Nick now open the car what is what is
their nationality her ethnicity
what's mine my American Feliz cumpleanos
how old did you turn 86
I do a lot no they're not supposed to be
in heaven already a special shout-out to
anyone that can correctly guess
Jenica ethnicity hey I look more ethnic
with my hair up you look cute
seriously it's tough no one's gonna get
it there's more than one I know it so
recently feels like the heat is just not
working in our apartment I have the
thermostat set at says it's at 66 right
now I have it set to 71 I know that's
high some people only put it like 69 80
70 tops but it won't it just one top 66
I feel like the flame went out or
something so I'm trying to Google
and figure things out before I call my
landlord or tech stuff and you guys have
any experience with this recently in the
comments if you have a recommendation
and what I should do or check out
because I gotta keep my pregnant wife or
gotta keep a toaster so if the light is
flashing seven times in a row it means
that the flame is out and you're gonna
have a bad time so it turns out the
heater is not working and we're just
have to live with 60-degree temperatures
until my landlord responds we just might
have to layer up last night it were like
a hoodie sweatpants over my shorts just
a lot of layers and it looks like I'll
be doing that again tonight I guess this
will just have to be my heater tonight
yeah they're not gonna ignite themselves
