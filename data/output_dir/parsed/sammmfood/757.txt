strengths I always overpack for some
reason I feel like I need to bring

Oh see that happens I'm a bad packer
Noah's been walking around all day with
this pole I hide it from him and he
always finds it he's like Gandalf for
the great little Gandalf hey

matter what no matter where if I did no
matter where I hide it he fights it
showing up holding it he's like oh I got
it back it's dangerous that's what it is

got hey no more pulls for a while okay
he's like I must find more I'm Gandalf
another adventure is underway we just
drove to Salt Lake where we'll be
staying the night that's what we do when
we're not living too close to the
airport and we have an early flight
because it costs a lot of money to park
at the airport it's like 10 bucks a day
so if you get a hotel for cheaper than
that you get free parking and then
they'll shuttle to you and we'd have to
wake up even earlier to get to the
airport so that's what we're doing
hi I'm making it quick like a quic Pitts
oh maybe the quick a quick pit stop to
see our friends new baby and we're so
excited she had her baby the day Noah
was born so they the same birthday
exactly a year apart let's go
Noah's ready to get out of the car we've
been in it like over an hour and a half
look at her she's so pretty
daddy me alone oh my goodness good job
Matt good job guys you made a pretty
baby without for sure your parents wanna
dance around years ago we were staying
up all night yeah probably
no that was 2015 till 6:00 okay
nine years ago but we took it to your
grave so no we gotta go now we have
babies I just can't believe she's here

she didn't know I had the same birthday
yeah you're so wait she just woke up
don't worry Leah like right now but
still maybe no why can't I stay away
from that we meet it grandeur Hotel her
immunity for sleeps
so we made it to our hotel room the
first hotel room that we had we walked
in and it stunk of cigarettes and smoke
and we're not like the type to usually
complain and ask for a new room
with a baby hey and paying for a room
you're like so we just went up and very
nice and asked if they could switch it
up so now we're in this room and we're
getting ready we're going to hopefully
