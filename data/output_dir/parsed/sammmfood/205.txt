right double fill so for the past couple
years we've been wanting to get bikes we
before we had kids oh yeah I wanted I

then like the timing and just like how
expensive they were it just wasn't right
yeah it was almost end of summer and
then we're like well we should get bikes
that we can pull the kids around in that
makes a lot more sense as far as time
well PJ was like too small so we're like
wait till next summer
well next summer is almost here and it
seems like we're probably gonna move
somewhere warmer so we gotta get some
bikes so today we're gonna look around
and try and find a nice bike we've been
to all the shops like we've looked
before about today we're serious
question is because these two coexists
in the back like a camera in there
behaving I think if we had a few toys or
books back there had their water pushing

summer cuz PJ will be big enough last
summer she was just a baby a little baby
oh gentle no attendances whatever heard
about it would be better when she's like
being pulled she liked it yeah it's like
a once you understand that this is where
you going is it stuck
I'm easy and Zevon to slow that oh my
goodness
what do you think you are trying to
everyone this one okay
there you go too big compared to the
bike here so I can't decide it's like a
cruiser ish but we're gonna test right I
went over here to so many bikes guys so
many bikes don't feel like the more
chill bike right now don't try that one
on - that's too big for you yeah
ready you gotta get a helmet for
Penelope we should go in for her today

sturdy in like you tell it's like heavy
duty she goes if it's turn that bike
looks too small for you the frame looks
weight hahaha go dad go good you said
Dada da Dada where's Dada
yeah but I don't know the biker seems
well too dainty for you is there a large
of that bike though I really like this
right here yeah I like that too it feels
like play-doh
yeah comfortable right there yeah I
don't know it just looks a little small
you're a tall guy though you're right
okay
Sam's currently buying the bike and and
he's riding at home I'm gonna try to get
him on camera when he gets home I think
I'm gonna get the blue one I don't know
I loved how like smooth the other one
was but I have okay people don't realize
how long my torso is I have the longest
torso ever and I hate bending over bikes
like it just it's so uncomfortable to me
so the blue one was like nice I could
just like sit up I liked it I'm gonna be
another one you gotta bail - did you
just break the bail
did you break the bail something flew
off its baseball did you enjoy it
we're bikers now but so jen is currently
torn between two bike they're both
different one of them's more like
relaxed kind of like a cruiser that you
