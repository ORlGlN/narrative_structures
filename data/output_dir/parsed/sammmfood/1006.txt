geez okay happy birthday thanks babe
happy birthday mom thanks Noah some
cuddles in the morning that's how you
start off a good birthday
can you find the baby in the blanket I
said yeah I told some we should bring
him so I started playing on his blanket
and then you said all three-toed in the
big damn blanket like a little hot
pocket ready
it's very pretty lighting hey baby
thank you for the ripe old age of 23
no are you gonna bust the food for us
it's bragging right now sir cute happy
birthday
I'm gonna say that like 20 thousand
times today did I mention he's mad for
the first time today yeah we got you
Jenna wanted in and out for birthday
lunch in and out that's what sounding
good that's why eat paper every time I
have it in out how is it with the animal
sauce animals now I just usually paper
every time he did it out today is Jen's
birthday we're only gonna say that like
a thousand times probably in today's
vlog but this year was different she's
like I don't want anything just well
figure it out I always give her like
pretty cool gifts I think
president are you excited
why aren't you excited aren't you
excited even wanting this so bad she
also hates when people buy our cards cuz
she thinks it's a waste of money
so I made her a little card to Jenica
love Sam and Noah burrito baby I wanted
to get her of one of those Kindle Fires
that lighten no I can over Kindle white
I will light up at night so she gonna
read while she's feeding the baby but
instead I might just give her some money
so we can go to Sephora and she can pick
out whatever makeup she wants whatever
she's looking for she usually doesn't
buy yourself anything so hopefully it's
a special treat guilt free shopping
spree to the store even though it's not
like a huge shopping spree wait who's
that - is that - me - Janet's mom
look at the card right to see oh whoa
whoa sees you I was just planning on
using your your card oh when I expect
tears
I expect tears out of you
as you all know by now my birthday today
and this guy is taking me to the mall we
are Babyliss right now which is really
weird and I'm kind of anxious
he's good Sam's mom but it's my it's our
first time without him well my first
time like actually leaving him and I'm
kind of sad about it and kind of nervous
about it but we need a little alone time
and we're gonna go shopping I need I
needed a little something does not buy
anything but she has birthday money
somewhere I really don't buy anything
ever myself because for some reason I'd
rather just have Sam guess what I never
know what I want
but anyways Sam gave me a very generous
birthday fund and I'm very creamy and
and Sam's mom
and my mom is giving me a person as well
so I have lots of shopping money so I'm
gonna go do a little shopping
what are you gonna get free no no yet
we'll see after yay
so we didn't leave empty-handed
I bought a pair of pants it was quite
the struggle
lots of trying on lots of looking at
things one purchase this girl the girl
they can't buy anything it's hard
because like the style right now is
everything is short like shirts and
shorts and everything so it's hard to
find stuff yeah she's yeah just like a
mom yeah
I'm proud of her though she got one
thing and you know she'll get something
