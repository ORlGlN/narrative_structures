just cause like there's never no 10-year
warranty that's good I think that's
pretty standard though so I just always
we've just had the worst Lego appliances
that's true but that was Craigslist
someone said why don't you guys get
something on Craigslist we've done it we
did it once and terrible experience and
I know that's not everyone's experience
but we just want to do that again so
investing in our future I don't own the
house but we're preparing to own a house
by buying a washer and dryer which we
will hopefully use for at least the next
ten years
mm-hmm we have a really good deal I
think and and we're supporting local
business yeah I focus they're really
nice to us and good stuff anything it
