good evening and welcome to today's walk
where we have brought our family to the
Arizona experience which you guys have
experienced yourselves many times cactus
cactus is cacti you be the judge
or maybe it's octa-pie octopus octopuses
plus is it was HQ trivia got that wrong
so what was the answer it could have
been octopi or octopuses but they like
they need to do better
here's a behind-the-scenes of David's
Instagram snapchat I don't even know I
couldn't get the right angle booth

coyote yeah you did good your first
round you first go was a little rough
but then you got better huh you want to
do it again sometime the night before we
actually went to top golf for some
brotherly bonding I decided to put that
footage at the back of the vlog because
I know a lot of you guys maybe even
majority I'm not sure probably won't
even want to watch that footage to begin
with but I wanted to record it so I just
moved it to the back sorry if that's
confusing here it is
up next on the green we have Maddie
Oscar Guerrero
that was a beautiful ride
none of us circle
it's coming down to the final five
swings top shot professional nearest men
step 6 Joe and up first is Matthew of
Guerrero we need to do is hit the lane
target will he actually do it probably
not actually
Matthew girl takes back to the swing
makes contact and that one that way
did it go in
we've got like 15 balls I was all and
negative like oh that's got are you in
that's it it's in 26 points inside and
it goes far left he hooks it in to the
lord's blue

awesome minute it's gonna wind right now
I'm gonna get a negative point losing
the fennel and with that he's still in
the game
Oh

ah
you won the first game - I won this game
talking during my backswing I don't know
in the grain we still have another day
with Andrew and og I hate when it's all
over I just love the holidays Jen and I
are about to celebrate our seventh
wedding anniversary though on New Year's
Eve I decided to put some throwback
clips in today's vlog and actually was
watching the old Christmas vlogs and
it's incredible to see how our family
has grown I was like manager I was like
it's insane because we we talk about
these things that happen in the past and
we can then jump back to him and
actually watch it and see what it was
like and I forgot how little though it
was and I've always already forgotten
how tiny baby PJ was so I'm grateful for
this we're also getting close to four
years of vlogging unbelievable guys
thank you to all of you that have been
there for the ride so far so yes
tomorrow
