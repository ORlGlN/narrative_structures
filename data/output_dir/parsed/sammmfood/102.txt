Museum but it's like kind of far from
where we're at so and then we were gonna
go to like this bounce place like a
bounce inside type of place but they
don't have free bounds until like solo
bouncer ever until one it's just
birthday parties in the morning or
something so like dang it we drove all
the way there and they will look - I
deal with the kids cuz I didn't know it
where else to go cuz I'm still learning
the area so it's like okay let's just go
