okay what about this one okay hey know
what about this one Kesey adios oh wait
okay
here's a question thinking about how
people as kids and toddlers learn
different languages blows my mind like
we're teaching Noah to speak English
- some people English would be really
hard you know same little things like
that but there's certain words that just
come naturally to them mom dad it's
crazy how those really kiss first rinse
right hello hi hi and things like that
so it's crazy from I'm in my mind to
think about the people that are learning
other languages as little kids because
that's what happens
here's my question though for Spanish
speakers okay
I'm obviously not a native Spanish
speaker but I learned a lot of Spanish
over time and I'm pretty foot what are
some easy words that you can start off
with Ola is one of them right hola but
what are the other words that we can
work on because I think it'd be fun to
teach Noah Antonelli me Spanish as they
grow up maybe they won't be fluent but
it's just fun to throw words in here and
there so let me know what words I should
also work on can you say comida
no Paco they're heard max you think taco
taco Tico
hey go tag ya know did you like church
today yeah
you thought Tico Church yeah yeah how
was an issue funny it was fun can you
take your Vicky oh you know did you sing
any songs at nursery what song did you
sing people popcorn tree sing one what's
your mom's version this popcorn popping
oh no that was Missy
I think my do you think the words always
better yeah
how'd that one go there's a lot of fairy
hello there family let's talk about
Sunday's Sundays are always Sundays are
always the craziest day of the week for
us they are the most difficult often the
most rewarding and just the craziest
reason being we wake up
it's crazy town we get ready for church
it's crazy we go to church it's crazy
time we come home from church and no
one's taking a nap
including mom oh you already excited
about tomorrow you're gonna get a buzz
yeah no do you know what else happens
tomorrow the garbage man comes yeah
should we get some chairs and camp out
tomorrow morning yeah yeah what are you
gonna say to them tomorrow
hi guys yeah hi I'm Chuck go deeper okay
your diaper that's much better now I can
see you hi
I wish our hair would steak like look
how curly the back of our head is right
now I wish it would stay curly but dry
straight meat for bed Oh dad
I always think sunday is a good time to
regroup plan for the week
would you go okay sure
I got your pants and you brought a
diaper are you gonna get dressed
yourself one of the reasons why we are
getting better meal planning is so we
can also be better with a budget and
spending money because we have new goals
well the same goals but reinforced so I
feel like we've changed a lot since
we've started vlogging
we've changed in looks demeanor I
probably get in like 30 pounds kids will
do that to you it's crazy how just thing
here and sitting here it's just like a
wide angle but one thing's true we've
become closer like I always bring that
yes no but I I would be sad if we hadn't
grown and changed the because we're the
same way we were when we started
vlogging when we were still in college
I'd be kind of worried you know I feel
like I'm more of an adult I do we have
two children you know kind of have two
adults yeah yeah sometimes we forget to
adult that night and then you stay up
too late and then right you took really
bad of that it's good
so anyways we've had one of these goals
our whole marriage but one of these
goals has become even more stronger and
we're like oh let's do it
if there's one tangible physical item
that Jen wants more than anything else
in life it is a pair of Tiffany no look
it's a house
my place to call home we're not a place
to settle you guys might say well you're
living in a house right now right but
we're actually just renting this place
and you know why didn't you buy a house
this time around and we've said many
times before we never felt like coming
back to Logan was like the final
destination or at least a resting spot
for more than a year or two or whatever
circumstances change and we're really
making an extra effort at being able to
buy a house we want to buy a house you
guys are probably wondering where do you
want to buy a house and that's what the
summer was for good question yeah we
continued to talk about that
this summer we went and visited pretty
much all of our family the only place we
didn't go was New Mexico but we did see
my sister and her husband and John was
in California and we saw Matt and st.
George
or I mean sitter city so we've been
around to like all our different family
members pretty much and we're like in
that process we were wondering should we
live in one of those cities let's fuel
it out you know like really kind of feel
out whether this is the right place to
live
hey few things are coming up
she turns five months old tomorrow
