50s they're gonna watch Brooklyn and I'm
probably gonna edit this Bullock right
now because tomorrow is Tyler's birthday
it is also my sister Courtney's birthday
March 21st is a great day we are most
likely gonna go to Salt Lake and
celebrate and then Rachel's flight is
tomorrow night so if we're down there it
just makes it easier to so here's my
green screen actually just edit the vlog
so I've watched it it was a pretty fun
day no one just loves being outside
outside makes them so much happier the
only problem is is that once we have to
go inside he's like yeah it's gonna be a
great summer I can't wait to take my two
little babies outside except one of
them's not really a baby anymore and I
can't wait to just see all our other
friends and families babies especially
Courtney Courtney who's birthday is now
today as you're watching this happy
birthday Courtney you probably won't see
this but we love you and we can't wait
to meet your baby as well which could be
born on the same day as Penelope it's
just so exciting this is the final
stretch I'm gonna say that every single
day until she's here because it's like
hard to sleep at night sometimes
Jenna's getting very anxious which means
she'll probably be late ozs tomorrow
