oh my god
what's up YouTube fam since we've
started to do one takes on Sunday for
the most part today's vlog will be a
compilation of a ton of different clips
and fun from the weekend I also wanted
to give a shout out to some people have
tweeting me about Harry's lately Jenny
bright what's up
Dylan looking nice do like that
k7 for engraving let's read says for dem
legs so glad I heard about Harry's a lot
of you are probably wrapping up your
holiday shopping it is getting super
super close you don't have to panic yet
you still have a little bit more time if
you are struggling to get a gift for
someone though trust me this is the way
to go you can knock it off today - my
sister Christie if Jason is watching
this video right now tell him to go away
you have five seconds one two three four
five this is one of the gifts that I'm
giving him this coppered out razor with
a shave gel aftershave extra razors this
set is called the winter Winston set you
can also get one with one that's more
like this it's like an orange blade I
think that's like a navy I'm keeping the
goatee for a little bit longer but I
have to trim up like all this scraggly
hair yeah I should probably clean it up
a little bit more but Jen likes it when
I don't look like I'm 16 I think she
likes it when I look like I'm 18 buying
gifts for people is super hard
especially guys some time for my brother
in life like he can get himself anything
he want I feel like he has everything he
needs
so I'm hooking him up with a set like I
said I'm getting the copper one for him
this is mine personally but this is a
super safe nice elegant classy gift that
you can get someone and if you want to
get it by Christmas you have until the
18th to get economy shipping this set
right here is normally $15 your first
purchase on Harry's if you use the promo
code say Micah and click on the link in
the description you will get five
dollars off your purchase you can get
this entire thing for ten bucks if you
want to go a little classier get
something a little nicer you can get
like a copper one this is the winter
Winston set you can get the silver one
those are just a little bit more
expensive I think they're worth it
because they're a lot
aye sir they just feel super nice in the
hand though the blades it's all high
quality aside from its shaving nicely
what I always look for is something that
smells good and I love to smell the
shaving cream and shaving gel jenny is
also super sensitive with all her smells
while she's pregnant
and she likes to smell so if you want to
add on you can get a travel kit for your
loved one there's also like face wash
there's all sorts of different options I
recently got this little holder for
myself so instead of just having like my
razor like lay out every kit comes with
like this travel case but I wanted like
a nice place to have it sit it kind of
puts my toothbrushes to shame but I want
to hope you guys out if you're
struggling with a gift I know how hard
it is to buy gifts for certain people
this is an easy way to do it click on
the link in the description and get one
of these for as cheap as $10 just use
the promo codes Amica you'll be good to
go also if you order something tweet me
a picture when you get it I want to know
what you guys think so far I've only had
a hundred percent satisfaction from you

this walking up we've been cleaning
Saturday is a special dance the day you
get ready for Christmas
okay yeah and he's probably employed
every pair of shoes now what are we
doing today well we're going ice-skating
we have to yeah Noah a helmet
you just need like little odds and ends
like we always need more hangers maybe
it no one hears now cuz I think I'm the
only mom on the planet wasn't hung up
any of his stuff I've just been folding
and reverses then just hangings for the
house tour has a bit yeah we're gonna go
try ice skating with Noah and it's
probably gonna be a disaster
just because it's a little too late at
night we should go earlier in the day
but this was like the only time
for public skate today so we'll go give
it a go I'm just gonna carry him around
kind of get him familiar with the ice he
probably really wanted skate much at all
like I said on Instagram I mean he can
barely walk straight so you'd be a lot
of me just kind of carrying him and
holding him look how awesome all these
lights though aren't like up on the
mountain those are all houses and their
Christmas lights it's so sweet
look at that dude it's getting ready
checking it all out taking it in you
can't walk in those big we have to carry
have to carry him even oq oh you carry
him I don't want to break his ankles
look at how cute they are
there he goes first time
well first time around
I'm not sure how much don't like that
but it's just want to introduce them to
it it's kind of good
so Aaron says is not that good at
skating it's barely been that he's gonna
fall a lot it's been a while for me I'm
actually it might be dangerous out here
