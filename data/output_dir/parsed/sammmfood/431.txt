special major league baseball with a
case in hopes that when we go to the

bought a styrofoam board to make a sign
that says I'm to like it's my birthday

don't think like go Cubs or we could
just bring a sharpie and draw it write

skipping but we're having such a good
time we'll be here for a couple days
panda write much for longer get the sign
- it says welcome papa Penelope Jenica
