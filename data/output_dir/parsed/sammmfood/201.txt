is just finishing up work stuff
and then we're going to film a local
mini car seat review
I never referred someone with Noah's
courtesy and people were kind of curious
about his car seat so when someone
repeated we're like a Moxon whatever so
okay okay
Noah asked mom to turn up the music hey
Billy
today we have a very special package oh
yeah we can hear you have a car seat to
match Noah yes you want to help open it
okay so as most of you know we have B oh
no oh I love it
look are you sure but there's flip the
big bulky ones are just too big so I
sued this one again I almost got her
some great Oh rubber whatever car seat
but this one's going to a little super
on Amazon so what this one the other car
seat for me to lug around
yeah thing they rebranded it a little
bit so the nose yes I just didn't use
his canoes too big they're too big does
it for like because these are forever
car seats like you can be a newborn with
it what's that straps they just recently
redid the logo for it oh this is nice
honestly I kind of wish I would have
just gotten black vanilla but whatever
is a little too cute
this is your car see should we open it
up for you here we hold that for sex I
was going to say black will be hot in
the summer moment yes I know those the
only color they're all black the only
color that they changed out on these are
like the headpieces it's only color
change
I don't know about that so pretty much
the same thing
so they'll be come try it out okay
here's her seat in her folder so they
have this um infant insert that I knew
for know for quite a while to help you
freaking out me as well know you'll eat
it right now for PJ stress couple of a
again couple there we never really use
Noah's cupholder it was kind of hard to
figure out I kind of get it in there
that's the one thing I didn't love is
the cup holder situation and they're
extremely heavy but I love house when
they are yeah yeah that a travel bag for
this one too I ordered one to tell you
there's a joke about this one yes Peter
you want to try it out like it's so
weird that like she's getting into a
bigger car seat already was crazy I was
also excited to get this folks I was
like okay I remember how everything's
pulled it up so I guess it's not they're
just like what I do
there's best the specimen or drawback to
the one thing a second be I don't like
this for those blue tents loose strands
everywhere which I really hate so we did
get that bag thing yeah travel travel
case and I just use hair ties and rubber
bands to like keep them up - yeah by
shiki way you have two toothbrushes what
the next food oh it looked like a
toothbrush she loves or your deep it's
nice huh ah sit backwards in that regard
feel tall makes it here we go how are
you worried like she's tall babe do you
see at all she's the same height as Noah
did we talk about this I can't remember
to mention we probably mentioned this in
the blog right her Endora the same exact
item he said that and I'm actually an
inch shorter than they were when I was
that age
crazy how is she like I'm okay see baby
ah love it do you love it so much more
comfy huh i scary when they go from this
from their old car seats of these it
just seems like it's like going to a
lazy boy
think they're happier and travel better
in the car yeah I remember I notice a
huge change with Noah
you don't even Emily they're like wait
how are you ever in an infant one cuz I
just oh you love me
very dry wants to go for a little test
drive huh if you have called children I
definitely suggest this car seat though
because it's longer and this head piece
can raise once we get bigger it goes up
as well
once they become bigger I haven't even
had to raise Noah's yet and then I think
they give you these big straps for older
kids as well
and another like adjoining things make
it longer but yeah I really like it
okay I know black will be hot that's the
only color they had was the cheapest own
they had and we have to sit over the
Green Monster crisp bright and sit over
the Green Monster yeah to go Crisco tell
me are you a big girl
yes yeah
what else about you Toby Turner the area
huh sir your face
now TJ can see man over car seat Oh guys
