I feel it's spicy already I cried the
first time I ate mine usually just for a

fiery ghost pepper
habanero grillers popping gyro is not as
spicy as ghost pepper I think I think
ghost peppers hot a lot hotter yeah the
one thing I want to say is that this is
the hottest item I've ever had a taco
bell which I like secondly it all
depends on who's working that day
sometimes you get the skinny dog
sometimes you get the big boy

sauce packets which resulted in my best
