right then we went to our Christmas
party yet church a lot of fun we sing a
lot of songs decorated gingerbread
houses

of great joy which shall be to all
people
this is the last weekend before we're
back with family celebrating Christmas
the holiday season always goes by so
fast
once it's Halloween and then into
November in December I feel like it's
just like bang bang bang and it's like
oh my goodness it's happening isn't it
so credit of like ah another 12 months
until this happened again Christmas time
also marks halfway to Noah's birthday
saves me two and a half and then we're
getting close to the three years old and
bonobos gonna be one soon but we have a
lot of fun happening next week we're
going to the Star Wars premiere with
some friends the bold there's a special
showing here in Utah and we have a
couple of other fun activities and
projects that we're working on so hope
you guys enjoyed today's vlog I thought
the Santa thing was just a complete
success last year I'll put a link at the
end of the vlog you guys need to go
watch last year meaning Santa it was
funny and no I didn't like it at all
so like Jen said before we kind of
expect an LP not to like it as much next
year we'll see how it does but it's just
funny to see like the progressive and
interest and this Christmas is gonna be
something else no I was just so full of
joy and energy and love and same with
Penelope she's just the sweetest little
girl and we can't wait to celebrate this
year I thought that was a person to do
they're just my hat so yes tomorrow
we'll get some judges bug peace
