happy this makes me

restaurant here actually it's four point
five out of five stars yep

Sam's in there say hi Sam hi Pam
what is it that they say distance makes
the heart grow fonder you guys already
know how much I love my family
Jenica kids but having been gone looking
for a place to live I just think I
watched these korkin bridges for this of
them I just love it so much and I feel
like to know he's grown so much in the
time that's been out here I just can't
wait to get home we got back from the
pool recently we left a little early
because we had to take David to work and
now we've got the phone with daddy oh
just got off the phone with daddy he's
doing well it's an application on a
house
okay um we'll see what happens I'm gonna
know for a few days specific oh yeah oh
all success and now I thought that'd be
fun to ride the bike to get dinner so
when I do that and then ride the bike to
the park so I think you'll be fine now
let's see how it goes I didn't get too
much put it at the pool which is just
too hard sometimes when I'm by myself
with both of them to like film and make
sure they stay alive and not drown so I
think you very much but it's funny you
guys stand up I can't reach and pick it
up and hold the camera and hold your
sister the same time so now we're gonna
go get some sandwiches
do y'all your sandwich
give me all your family rode a bike here
didn't we we read in the bike here the
fun is my son a car yes yeah she was in
the parks a little bit yeah look how
cute they are in there their little
helmet and buckles and strings and chips
okay off to the park now quick housing
update for you guys I submitted that
application I had to put in another one
for Jen I think it's just like a way to
get more money on the fees because with
each adult applicant you have to apply
and it's like $50 application fee kind
of crazy but the process since it's the
weekend we haven't heard back yet I'm
hoping to find out either Monday or
Tuesday and the first applicant though
so I can't imagine why we wouldn't
qualified to get it or anything and I
see I put in the movement date for the
middle of August so just like two weeks
it would be like two weeks probably
about three weeks
yikes crazy luckily we've started to
pack things up and I think I would fly
my dad out if he's available to help us
move and then Jen's that also is
available to help here once we get here
I think plus we're your friends here and
friends in Utah so they'll work thank
goodness for good friends and family
