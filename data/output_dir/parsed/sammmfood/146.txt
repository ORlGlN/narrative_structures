good year 25 was not my best year you
know just working on myself but it was a
great year with like ever like my family
and stuff like I love my kids and they
are just my biggest blessings and of
course my husband but mentally you know
25 and with know they're so 26 is going
to be a year where I focus on me and
just mentally physically I'm going to
get back in shape I'm just going to
focus on me a little bit more because I
just haven't been taking care of myself
so I'm gonna do it I'm gonna work harder
this year to just better myself in all
aspects of my life cuz you know
sometimes we just need a little no
pick-me-up
had to pick yourself up sometimes
nothing that 25 wasn't a good year
because it was a great year I think
it'll be a great year for my family or
moving to a new place where we don't
know anyone except for like a handful of
people and it's gonna be really fun and
really crazy and I feel good I just feel
good about this new this next year yeah
