bush Wow good job well whatever whatever

I'm just I'm exactly how I imagined
family communities it hang out on the
side I know right for everyone who wants
to know how to weed the right way my dad
has a great technique when I got home I
tried weeding and they just kept
bringing half my dad wad waters dirt
first and then they just pull right out
so if you want a weed and get the whole
thing out just water the ground first if
I get the whole root out look at every
single one is the whole root they look
like carrots those are some deep roots
what yeah you did skinnier muscle work
sink under California laser lipo machine

o'clock and no one else is here so you

you guys straight baby David asked me
what I want to get my score I just said
I'm gonna beat I missed his bowl but you
know it really doesn't matter you didn't
miss anything
let's zoom in on the next one missed the
ball but doesn't really matter he's got
one more it
alright get into the mind of a semi-pro
bowler Paula goes every weekend to the
local bowling alley

Cairo practice there you go I was
actually kidding but that was a pretty
good recovery can you get this bear can
you get this very excuses

Noah who's watched a lot of dude perfect

strike on my frame so we will see what
happens here goes David talked a lot of
smack and that's where he's off to it
one bit meanwhile my dad has 117 and
he's a couple frames behind us also kind
of beaten us off all right
Pablo just got a strike that means the
door is open for him to beat David the
door is open what does he need to get
