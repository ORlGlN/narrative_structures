Oh cream ah I love you red
morning guys it is beautiful Wednesday
actually comes out we're going to try to
go to the pool Tasi high-tech to the
extra inside pool tomorrow at 1:00 I
said yeah for sure just for tonight
it's kind of cloudy I'm really looking
at burns off I should look out the
window before I don't know we're going
we're actually getting our idea cherries
in my teeth
we're getting a new bed today PJ is top
molar finally broke through a bottom so
top molars kind of breaking through a
bottom canine has broken through and her
other bunk molars are about to break
through and she's just just a nightmare
for her this poor child I don't think
I've hardly been able to sit her down
and we've been trying to clean up the
house a little bit
so yesterday how it was pretty funny I
was on FaceTime with my dad eating some
toast that was sweet bread I was like
dad look you'd be proud of me
gluten-free bread it's like why are you
in gluten-free bread up like could you
told me to he's like no I said grain
free I'm like I think gluten free we
were I don't have to take out the blue
and I guess my dad more so just thinks I
figure out the grains and that we eat
like Ezekiel bread which just looks
nasty but I might give it a try I don't
know I might go back to regular bread
because even though vertebra is not
great for anyone we just we don't eat
bread often if I do it's only for toast
in the morning once in a while and to do
our jelly sandwiches once in a while or
grilled cheese sandwiches again I guess
enough right quite a bit
