check and she is 16 16 pounds
no wonder if he was more can't remember
feel like he was 17 or something
but man how does have some big strong
babies huh
think about that blonde hair - whoa
white hair white hair coming in uh you
were so smart for the nurse
gosh guys the bigger she gets so she's
becoming and I'm like you're turning out
to be more like your brother then I
thought you would be none of my babies
like to sit still minimum I don't I
could just chill that I could be doing
something at all times well kick kick
kick
I get cake cake
don't was he sorry I went back to find
those four month there's no at four
month old he was a little bit sturdier
in a lot around her that's for sure
he did a little more lean than Noah he
was almost 17 pounds so she's just a
pound lighter which is all right here
hearing his dad's 27 inches I'm pretty
sure she's the same length as him and
she's a pound lighter think she was I
think she almost a she was 27 and a half
inches I feel like she's a little bit
taller that Noah was but I don't know
who knows now I don't remember what she
said they do centimeters try to look at
it said I saw her angle close to my
severed our choice of it I think you're
gonna be pretty big I think I'm gonna
have some above I originally taught
children I think it's Sam and I are both
above average
right as well but could I pray because
my mom's only 5'4 and Jade back in shops
which is five three my dad's only five
nine nine five ten and then top of all
my siblings so it's kind of funny you
need seems probably six twenty maybe six
- but we both have tall relatives so
tall babies tell strong baby - uh-huh
I can help you choose four months old
already it is just crazy
it's just crazy we just got old rustic
summit appointment I'm like what six
month deployment already crazy
bye sweet pea presented out some tiles
from when she was born
okay what's then all right now I'm
filming you you wanna fill me yes okay
99 yeah hundred
yes I reach I got this the other day we
were like is there a hundred percent oh
yeah it's her right she's 100 percentile
for height look it look it so the top
chart is height look how much she jumped
you it so she's a hundred percent for
high basically rural life yeah really
told us right now is in the eighty
percentile which 81 yeah even percent
down and then her head circumference is
still like maybe 90 yeah so if she's
grown into her head and her weight has
stayed the same about but she's just I
always look I love stat yeah that's why
it was cool that they got Anita they got
a new system to print so they show
everything and then they give you a
chart from their whole birth yeah I love
interesting data okay so
Wow when she was born she was 1 foot 8
inches and then on the 20th of April so
like a couple weeks later she was just
one feet
ninjas she since herb whoa be careful
bubs she's now two feet in 3 inches yeah
she's I think she's a half inch taller
than oh and she's double and wait almost
yeah and four months she's pretty much
doubled her weight yeah she gained four
pounds will less than that
so I look back at nor Noah's four month
cuz she's 37 and a half inches or her
head shrinking though I mean like she's
growing her heads going smaller as far
as percentile goes yeah that's sick
I went from 99 when she was born yes we
didn't know that to 90 yeah imagine a 99
percentile head coming out of your body
I didn't know that he okay ninety
percent out we did anyone and she's gone
from 94 percent a length to 100 after
just three days yeah I wasn't then she's
just 800 two feet three inches so it's
24 27 inches 10 inches so she know where
were the same but with girls and boys
it's different so even though they were
the same length as babies I think boys
are just holler maybe I because no one
ever no he just said like if you're
around the Bumbo make sure like if she's
in the mumble make sure you're around
her oh yeah it's over yeah and we're
always careful with oh whenever she's in
the bun boy like my choosing my desk the
other day I was sitting there with her
right she was like in front of me
that's true those are those kind of
scare me to death and yeah so she said
he said like saucers nothing that
bounces but like she can beam like
things what about eating and then she
said but if she is interested in it
right now it's just for developmental
it's not for nutrition yeah not to force
her into it but we can do like we do the
rice cereal we can do it like once a day
so you start out once a day Yeah right
you're an officer you know ba release
you yeah so sorry this is like really
heavy
avocado and stuff is that lady yeah so
we can like start that later like later
this month or whatever it's just it's
not like nutrition it around the fourth
point right now because really she gets
furniture from me yeah so I can put like
breast milk in the right so I need your
help
what's going on all my tomatoes are
dying they like don't grow and they just
die bad gardeners right now step up our
garden team we're go and that one
actually looks pretty good you think
that's red some means it's like really
right well it turns this color we can
pick it you say red no I mean we just
have really tall children really
she is so tall we're talking to our
cousins Jen and Mark when they're saying
that like at two years old you can kind
of guess how tall are gonna be yeah I
think so so how does that work it was
like how many do they are now cook one

thanks wheat because there was such a
huge why don't you just bring me now we
could doubled up Mike yeah we said
Noah's check up well we were out of town

scheduled the appointment far in advance
but there's so many kids here in Utah
that's so hard to get I got check up set
up it's crazy we were like well we can
get you in three months for like
so this little guy he's definitely
healthy I could try like if I really
don't think she needs to eat but that's
gonna be a lot harder cuz she's sleeping
next to me so once she's in her own how
about what about her head though
oh so part of her head is flat which I
always kinda know I'm like it's not
dramatic no it's just a little flatter
and he said that her ears are fine my
careers are lined up so it's not like
crucial that it's like it's not like
terribly flattened or anything we need
to keep an eye on it because I believe
in my head it feels flat right here
