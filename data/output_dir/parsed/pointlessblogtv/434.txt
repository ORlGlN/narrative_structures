because I feel like I found your phone
you just properly started the vlog other
than this a face it's been a geek the
whole time just got to the train station
let's hope that my train isn't canceled
so there's actually an earlier train
that's delayed
excuse me do you know how long this is
grateful I was been canceled
ah just about somebody else who said
that one isn't canceled but it is the
next I don't know basically I think
after we left seven minutes or something
to get an earlier train third time lucky
everybody for now going for another
train that apparently there's nobody
here knows afterwards going on is
basically the quickest way to go home
was to basically on a trail pretty I
don't have you can hear me it was going
to take me just under two hours to get
home on the train or I could get the
train to Gatwick which is halfway then
jump off and get a taxi for 20 minutes
and I was save an hour's time so that's
what I've done the only thing I haven't
got as cash to pay for the taxi oh there
we go
it sounds good got my cash got my braces
in got my bag heading home to see Zoe
and Nala before she leaves tomorrow
