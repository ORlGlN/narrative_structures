today it's just a blooming exciting day
for so many different reasons that
you're about to see is your knowledge oh
no that can't even speak I'm so excited
as you just saw Nala has been laying on
the kitchen floor this more than in a
massive grump we picked her up last
night for my mom and dad's mom and dad
have been looking after her for about
three or four days and I was we were at
the tree house which obviously means
that she has been spending a ton of time
with buzz her brother playing with him
and just having fun so now she's back
home with ghazali and I and no other dog
she's like oh this isn't as fun so she's
a little bit grumpy hopefully she'll
cheer up soon she's just like spending
time by herself and when she's in bed
and stuff she was like laying at the
bottom of the bed barber then rather
than cuddling us off at the top but
anyways I'm sure she'll be fine she's
just a little bit grumpy it's funny I
had something at the top of my to do
this now for probably about four days I
think it was at for roughly four days
ago when you film the video if you
haven't seen my new main Channel video
at poppy you need to go check it out
they're super super fun it's like a
youtuber quiz where every question that
she gets right I'm going to donate 100
pounds to charity and the charity was of
her choice and she chose here the
chestnut tree house which is a charity
that I love so much it is basically a
charity that helps young people who are
going through incredibly tough times
incredibly tough times and is based in
Sussex which is where we live so it's
kind of like close to us
fact when I was in year eight I think of
how old Union 8a must have been about
thirteen I shaved my head board like my
entire head you guys know what it's like
as well when you're young and you're a
boy your hair is everything your stubble
is everything I didn't have any stubble
to our size 17 or something you want to
look cool you want to look cool for your
friends everything and I shaved my head
during those like tough years of wanting
to look and act cool divide everybody in
score shaved my head board for charity
and I think I raised like 350 pounds or
something crazy by doing that so I've
actually have like donated to this
charity before and I got in touch with
them and they were so thankful for the
money that I I've raised by shaving my
head so probably got nine out of the ten
questions right which means that she I
that I have to donate nine hundred
