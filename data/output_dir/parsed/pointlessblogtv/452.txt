are you ready for your presence I've got
you two and a half just be nice
good morning guys good morning good
morning my friends how you doing late
start to today's vlog I've had a pretty
crazy pretty hectic morning went
straight to the office edges to the vlog
got it all done got it all out the way
so that is going to be 100 on time
tonight I'm now hitting I've got 14
minutes I believe to get in a taxi and
get to my dentist from my dentist's
appointment for my new set of braces you
know when you get somebody who's just
adamant that they're right and you know
they're not but they're so persistent
that was my taxi driver just then I told
him the name of my dentist he was always
to go this on this road is like it's not
it's on the other road anyways he was so
adamant he was right took me to the
wrong location then said he continued to
the right one because it was all one-way
roads so has now dropped me on a
different road then my dentist isn't
even on and I've got like four minutes
to walk there brilliant great
I love paying to go to the wrong place
so I did in fact leave the dentist hours
ago like hours and hours I jumped
straight I didn't even sit in the
dentist's chair I was in there for like
a minute picked up my braces they are
like so hidden like so secret these runs
I don't feel as lispy as normal it will
improve I will be less and less less be
over time I love how I say that as I say
their lists P so the hardest word to say
anyways I think let me know in the
comments I think they look even more
discrete than before I'm just just
finished with all the vlog and
everything for today uploaded that a
load of meetings and phone calls and
things and just still at the office
planning something very exciting
happening on Tuesday I'll let you guys
know in funeral there's Calum coming

just bought something incredibly
exciting I've been waiting to get for
quite a while now a new laptop and the
reason of all that is because number one

wrapped up Missy you're nice and snug no
no I'm gonna end the vlog now guys thank
you so much for watching thank you for
the love and support recently what are
you doing if you're wondering why we've
switched sides of the bed is because
neither always sleeps on this side
and annoys Zoey in the night she walks
around gets up lays back down don't you
hear little fidget and it's always on
this side of the bed so he decided that
tonight we'll try and switch around and
see if she goes and follows back Zoey on
that side or wherever is literally this
side of that I think she wants claim
that spot do you think because I think
it's by the door so if anything happened
she came on to the door I don't know
it's just we start we fall asleep and
cheese this side with Alfie and then in
the middle of the night she just walks
over like circles round tries to get
coffee always wakes me up
so we've switched around done a
switcheroo and just going to happens
I'll let you know in the morning how it
goes if you've enjoyed today give the
