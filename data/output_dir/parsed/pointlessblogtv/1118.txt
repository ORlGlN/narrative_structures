right everyone without turning an
absolute
so Zoe is like sweating out and dying of
the heat because she warleggan's the
stupidest idea ever
so we're trying to find her some shorts
to buy that's our current choice how
happier you know I'm not thing is people
going to think of hands oxygen and I've
had run into the shop by shore
oh no no look you just wore leggings and
you had to roll them up these like the
tightest congas next no well things that
