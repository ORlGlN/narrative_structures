good morning guys good morning it's our
very last day in Dubai we're literally
leaving in a couple of hours change
still fast asleep in bed and I've come
down with my drone to meet Jesse and
Holly

from breakfast and Jay Jay's annoyed
because he slept in and we went down to
the beach and flew that flew the drone I
said we all me Holly and Jesse yeah

edit my vlog because we will be on the
plane whilst it should go live and I
said I said I did edit my vlog and then
I need to also pack and then I'm ready
to go we have one and a half hours until
we need to leave and I've told him I
need five minutes to pack he doesn't
believe me that I can pack my suitcase

five-minute timer I'm not packed any

wash bag which I need to use before I go
to the before I need to go to the
airport right now I need to edit my vlog
I always get the feeling that I've left
behind whenever I need any hotel but
obviously if I'm leaving a hotel in the
UK it's not really the end of the world
and I'm leaving a hotel on the other
side of the world I mean it's not really
the end of the world but it's bloody in
a way yeah all right we're gonna go
check us all out
I think we've literally got about four
minutes until our car takes us to the to
the airport I've also become aware
whilst editing the vlog from this trip
just how much I say the words thank you
so much one minute let's get one last
view out of this window of the Burj
Khalifa look at that I say that far too
much like it's nice to thank people

you but I say the exact words thank you
so much

as I do but I just stopped hurting that
bit in the vlogs because if you watch
