good morning guys how you doing I am on
the streets of New York just roaming
around basically because we stayed out
late last night I was mentoring meeting
coffee and Shawn and Maddie to get our
nails done at 10 o'clock this morning
I woke up at 5 minutes past 10:00
realized I hadn't edited the daily vlog
which has to be done by 12 o'clock here
because the UK has 5 hours ahead so I
couldn't go and get my nails done so
Shawn and pop me Maddie went without me
I then realized I haven't got a main
Channel video tonight because I've been
away a week so I just did another Sims
video for you guys so that you've at
least got two videos tonight going up
but I'm just annoyed at myself for not
having a main channel ready for you but
not much I can do now at least you've
got two videos tonight to enjoy and now
I'm just walking to meet them the time
is currently half past 12
and again as you
haven't even had breakfast yeah
being short we jumped in a yellow cab
down to Whole Foods just to grab some
breakfast and like a juice and stuff
in this temperature look at the through
buyers what do we go for I don't like
blue blades I think maybe this
strawberry and pineapple oh my gosh I
love these yeah
do you not see them some reason Whole
Foods wouldn't let me film in they're
too scared to come over when I turn your
camera off so I couldn't carry on film
in but we got a lot of delicious food
I'll show you we've got this at sushi
more sushi some fruit more sushi red
velvet cake for my pudding loads of
chicken probably got like a little
sanity thing water look how sick I love
the grinding on that cold brew I got a
drink like this and then we all got a
massive pudding to share which is like
the biggest deepest like it's so a heavy
and big or just amazing fruit so I'm
happy guys look over here
and New York policemen just jumped in
and started playing the game with them
no he's not blending more just around in
and caught the whole and when you scored
a touchdown that's so fun
it's a bit small no sleep guys we're
just gonna leave her there until she
notices

face yeah did you not wake up

lit trace looking your hair is massive
sticks and everything
you like a dog Foundation an event
or something and there's so many cute
dogs like I've walking around with
people woodworking and they have a
little sign saying adopt me on them look
how cute they are and then these are
dogs that are a bit like rescued or
given to the foundation and people here
can adopt them I think
let's like you then it's appear so
you've lived on your dogs
and compasses are socialized it's
raining in New York guys which is
actually quite nice because it is
incredibly hot still even though it's
rain
