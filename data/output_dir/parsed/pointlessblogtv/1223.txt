what's up guys so as you do I just went
to go and pick up and on up at the free
bowl and eat the banana and then I
realized how big and fat the banana
wasn't kind of thought this isn't right
so here is me opening the banana and
you'll see why it's kind of strange but
I can double on the bottom if you like
it's got dent in the middle as well so
I'm not sure if it's actually two
bananas Siamese and its massive can
brother oh my god is actually two
bananas joined together now that that is
weird guys look at that done if you can
see that that's to Banaras now this is
the bananas as you can see it's double
which is really bloody strange and it's
pretty damn awesome so there was my
Siamese banana
