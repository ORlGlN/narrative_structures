me all inspired by me taking the stairs
work just landed touchdown
though the annoying thing that I haven't
had to do an Aegis because whenever I
travel I never bring big luggage you
have to wait for all of our bags this is
your chance to lay on this and go around
there is no one here
grumpy puffy grumpy puffy
there's your taxi home thank you so much
see you later
so we've had all of our bags arrived
except from one small light hand luggage
size bag or puppy insurance but
everything else is here so it's not
whether they didn't deliver them and
they will all put on together and all
have priority tag from them as well but
one of them is missing the shores just
went and asked the man and he said now
they've all been sent it all taken off
I know what's going on has someone else
taken it quacks I'm thinking it was this
see later goodbye they still can't find
the bag they've just been on the phone
to that lost property people or
something and they're saying that they
just don't lose bags from Edinburgh to
here
so there could be a chance that it just
appears somewhere I have no idea but
they weren't going to fit in the car
with us anyway they were but they were
going to get a separate car back so they
can stay and try and find their luggage
and we're gonna jump in our car and
drive home get back into the car so II
