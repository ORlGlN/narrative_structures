good morning everybody it's super early
and me and Louie are driving into London
today I'm sat in Rodney and autism on
there
let's go awkward hmm and the reason
behind that is I have a photo shoot
today and I'm also doing some cool fun
stuff surrounding the launch of my
beauty stuff which is happening later in
the month and Lily needed to go into
London anyway and obviously we stayed at
my house last night so he was like you
know what I'm gonna get really early and
we're gonna drive in together I don't
think louise ever seen this time of day
before I think it's going to be nice
because I rarely get to spend time with
Lily off seas like in and out doing lots
of amazing things so we can have like a
bit of bonding time on a little drive to
London which is really nice I also have
my blanket for ultimate comfort yay here
he is
Oh with coffee
lucozade and red balls I think that
might be enough energy Louie in about 20
minutes you'll see him in a much more
awake state Oh what did you buy a little
snack bar no flat tire oh okay this road
looks nice and clean but being here Lea
just been stuck in traffic for
good 25 minutes
there's been a massive accident on the
m25 just seen it actually it's literally
right past the junction
and it's standstill traffic everyone's
out there cause like you oh here we go
you can see it like it's not moving at
all like ever
I expect this goes on for miles
and that we were discussing how crazy is
that this one accident has affected all
these people's days like they're going
to have to do everything differently
than they thought they were going to do
when they got in the car to go wherever
they were going so we're just yeah
littering out oh my goodness this goes
on forever
so it might be a bit late but look Maddy
I'm sorry if I'm late but look this is
what we were stuck in
my gosh
that's crazy
motorways are so great but they're so
bad in situations like this
going we're now coming through a
tollbooth kissing two pounds Louie
is it fun for like I'm going on holiday
not having the best luck today Louie
oh it must have dropped it oh he did he
dropped it
oh dear
okay
thank you cache page boy very good
Oh God
oh she's saying wait Oh No
oh is it because emergency services are
coming through yeah they've stopped the
traffic yeah yeah we're all stuck
why is going on today Louie every time
we avoid something we just went into
something else
study the weirdest thing I wonder if
we'll ever get to London we've arrived
Sacchi been asleep that's not too bad
considering the journey we just had I
was over two hours yeah wait
that was a long way over to us is that
like - no let's go okay great yeah sure
yeah sure use Amazon
midnight blue I do actually think that
that's store went too high if you think
the thing that we haven't for would be
to pursue that it gives actually enough
for about oh yeah all the onions
yeah shoulders
she's quick back
the food break but I'm also trying some
of these little meringues out oops
and basically case testing them for the
launch night which is really the citing
my favorite is actually gone it was
coconut and there was a hazelnut one too
and muddy devoured that one yeah
yeah I think the pepper you just wanted
to shave I'll call my hair and makeup
looks like
also I really like this dress
next look look some photos they look so
cool really good death I'm home guys I
am so freaking tired our batteries about
to run out and I've got a hot fan on cuz
I feel really cold and shivery so I hope
I'm not gay girl the shoot was really
fun it was for dare magazine so that
should be coming out kind of November
December time I hope you like sneak peek
um I'm actually I actually feel quite
sick because I get travel sickness and
it's it's not so bad on straight long
roads but it fits in London traffic and
there's a lot of braking stopping
braking stopping braking stopping
accelerating braking or or it just makes
me feel reset and the driver I had all
the way back to Brighton was like it the
whole way and it was it was like I was
like like really trying to breathe
through it the whole way back so now I
just kind of feel like I'm so happy to
be in my bed
it's been a really long day it's now 9
p.m. just going through your comments on
the floor it looks like you all enjoy it
and I think I'm gonna have to end the
video here I'm really sorry that this
was probably quite a short video but I
wasn't too sure what I could and
couldn't film in the shoot and also I
was kind of there wasn't a lot of time
that I could is this still on yeah there
also wasn't a lot of time that I could
film because I was being photographed
