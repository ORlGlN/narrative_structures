okay
and I have my epic LV this question you
can say we're not going to turn the
camera
we're just waiting to meet up with
Marcus and Louise and go thanks
tumblr were you doing angry
what are you actually doing with hard
rubber are you removing the crusts from
your sandwich hmm I don't know if I
mentioned but we're in London tubes
adding that you're taking up the coat
and your jumbo oh yeah
and now you add in that basically we've
got to mention that were in London I'm
not very good at starting blocks because
I'm not a blogger like ask me but German
speaks to me put on you the Dom to speak
so I mind you yeah
Alf is just come on the train from
Brighton to London I've come on the
train from Bath to London and we haven't
met up we're having a coaster oh it's
the signals me not no cotton oh yeah
getting wrong there water you coffee to
drink coffee no no I never do I haven't
you gonna go me down guys let me tell
you earlier man so we have arrived at a
hotel because me Louise Joe our feet and
Marcus are all going to stay in a hotel
tonight because we go into a party which
runs on until quite early in the morning
sort of we are mad
we have crazy loons so we thought it
would be best rather than as all going
off on different trains home which would
take quite a long time because none of
us actually live in London we thought we
would all get a hotel and like split it
between us and just come here instead
and it would be very fun let's doing it
so Louise and Zone one run this is me in
Louise's room I want to give you a
little tour which is unlucky
because no unlucky for me and Marcus and
Joe actually because we call you in two
of them because the key won't work we
just tried to drop our fees bag off in
his room which is the floor below us and
we can actually get any of the keys to
work so that's fortunate in views I need
