because you like to starve yourself for
fun doesn't mean I have to why I what
starve yourself yeah why do you guys
starve ourselves anyways
why I start why I start that money party
then ball shake that bony Pony
they're boys Cory dad
I starve because I helpful I am full of
these blessings that I have been blessed
food without even having a has to be
blessed with I starve because I how
blind we are now although we can see
very far it's what's right in front of
our eyes that we are most blind to you
see you and I we live the good life
we don't have to struggle to survive and
we don't have to do very much to feel
alive but what's inside what's inside
where the problem lies
no not what's inside your stomach at the
moment but what's inside your heart in
your mind now let me read your mind you
even though you think you're full you
need this food more than I do
food for thought that digests into your
soul which you don't have which is why
you my friend are starving you're
starving because of the lack of
information you fail to receive from the
media you see the media decides to hide
and fight in front of your eyes while
they instead terrorized and victimize
and then say it was done by some other
guys you're starving because you don't
even care about the other guys you fail
to sympathize or even recognize what's
happening to other guys wait wait let me
ask you something do you know who I mean
when I say the other guys no don't
that's why I starve I start because of
the greed that has been instilled in me
from living so peacefully I starve to
rid myself with this disease this
disease that consumes your heart in your
mind it makes you believe that
everything around the world is just fine
now I'm not trying to rhyme but plays
this into this next line
us living like this is a damn crime a
crime that has been going on to the
beginning of our time a crime that when
we commit instead of getting prosecuted
for we get rewarded for doing commercial
is commodity sex that weren't
celebrities luxurious amenities cutting
each other for some Yeezys and last but
not least the freedom that is life I
starve to remind myself of these
blessings I started to forgive myself
for over indulging when life offered me
a taste of it sour apple I start to
humble myself entertain the ego that was
awoken from within from the store-bought
phones that were stitched in and
actually by kids half my age I serve
because I choose to not because I have
to I star for the other guys now you
know why I star but you still don't know
who the other guys are do you
I starve for the Forgotten souls out in
Somalia I star for every drip of blood
that was lost my child out in Syria I
star for every tear that was shed by
mother in Afghanistan and for every
drone strike that was done on to
Pakistan I star for the war that the
beloved Iraq to go through before Barack
and for every rock that was thrown by
fallen angel out in Palestine I starve
for the tens and thousands of dead men
women and children now in Burma it's a
public genocide of a whole nation turned
vital but kept silent
so now
let me ask you why am i dying to live
when they're just living to die
that's why I starve
