in my ear
so the show ended and there was a part
in the beginning when I come out and
start rapping and right as I stepped on
stage the track went out and I couldn't
tell if it was like just the Mon stage
monitors or the whole house it was the
whole house so I was just freestyling
like a wiki wet and clean and I gave
that look to each other like oh crap

what the now we're gonna do the
meet and greet are you ready yes

stop it
I feel like the UK understands that it's
okay to celebrate Christmas because
Thanksgiving oh is that why yeah thanks
Americans are dumb and they think that
Thanksgiving is the beginning of
Christmas when in fact you can celebrate
two holidays at the same time that's
right we Thanksgiving you employees per
se in Christmas fall and and
Thanksgiving the only thing that
signifies it is pilgrims and entities
