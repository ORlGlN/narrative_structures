hey what's up ah my knee my right knee
hurts so bad my left knee is totally
fine if I straighten it all the way and
then flex it it kind of hurts why would
I do that on a normal basis but my right
knee
I can't straighten them all the way and
if I put pressure on like my toes like
if I point my foot it hurts like a
mother effer
I'm supposed to do a kickboxing class
with my cousin at 6:30 tonight
and I'm really hoping that when I walk
around it will loosen up because that's
usually what happens like if my
snowboard might need locks up that night
and then throughout the day and it
excites have to walk it off so I'm
hoping I can just walk this off we shall
see but I have to get ready to an SB to
get my to caveny spilled I'm bill even

right now and then I I'm gonna hang out
with my parents I think I'm already with
my dad hopefully my mom has Parker and
Jacob so they shall be a pleasure to see
everyone a pain when I woke up I felt
like I was going to pass out for good 30
minutes like I took a shower and the
whole time I thought I were going to
pass out lightheaded oh well my body

people are given middle names so that
you know when you're in trouble back
I think Stephanie just tried to kill me
the one you have no defense yeah I
actually had a lot of fun and if I my
knees were better that would have been
like the best time ever it was it was a
lot of fun and I definitely want to go
back what I'm all sealed and ten minutes
into the class I like playing my mess by
step I don't know how that happened so
I'm like sitting there like dizzy
punching with one arm and kicking with
one leg it was a thing but I got a lot
it I was good I watched as I burned
almost 500 calories so that was in a
tough workout so hey guys hey we're

moment

edit and post my blog for today I
totally forgot about that
I left whoops um but I got two cavities
filled here and here I can't show on
that side it hurts so bad
I've never really had it hurt that bad
before after a cavity maybe because it's
two of them so it's extra pain I don't
know but it does not feel good and I've
never had that before so I'm really
hoping they didn't mess up and I don't
have to go back to the dentist
ah man
