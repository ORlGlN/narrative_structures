hey guys so I have an urge to make
cookies and I want to eat them but I
don't have things for them so let's go
to a store and then we're gonna make
some cookies cool cool - cool with me do
liddie I decided to make oatmeal cookies
instead of his normal cookies cuz I
finished that they taste so much better
but you know regular chocolate chip
cookies are better than milk but I'm
sticking with oatmeal because I've made
a decision so I have flour at my
apartment but it's like three years old
and Matt apparently says Oh Matt does
say he doesn't apparently say Matt says
that apparently it expires after about
six to eight months so I have to buy new
flour for this business that's how
little I bake
okay target is this thing or it makes
the exact same product a completely
different price is just on a different
shelf and I can never figure out what
the difference is
five pounds five pounds mg bread flour
oh I'll purpose flour oh that's bread
flour though it says all-purpose this is
a purpose why is it here this is I'm
getting this whatever
someone lost their to weight on the
ground sadness we got all our cookie
ingredients but now we're really hungry
so we're going to get a chicken sandwich
from someplace that's amazing and then
I'll go home and make the cookies behold
the best chicken sandwich ever you may
not look grand but it is delicious
now it's time for me to attempt cookies
I don't remember the last time I made
cookies
I just eat whatever cooling makes now I
don't have a fancy mix aid like everyone
else in the world so I have this old
hand beater that's all
you
baking makes a mess I wish my oven was
cool and how like a window you guys
could see the cookies bacon but we're
just gonna have to use our imagination
I'm about to taste them but rule number
one of eating cookies always half milk I
won't use a cookie unless just milk
available all right I'm gonna eat this
business I think I've successfully made
something in the kitchen which is like
the first time in my entire life that's
happened he's going down
I'm Gammons in my you
you better dance let's make a
if you welcome
