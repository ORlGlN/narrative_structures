all right today is Sunday and we're
heading to Maui we're leaving Honolulu I
just help these children pee
what do you mean I wants the bathroom
with you all right they might have gone
into stalls themselves ride to walk up
like a mile to the bathroom now I love
fun yeah okay but I walked next to you
and I killed Bailey for most of it I
didn't say you walks next to me I hope
Bailey okay that's not gonna work okay
barely oh I'm not the best babysitter
we're about to get on the plane
Oh
my private jet I known it mine
I bought it for myself I was like I'm
working really hard I just need a
private jet so I got one and I flew it
here to Hawaii here it is had a better
angle my jet
I named it that
the shortest night of my life when you
travel with the balancers you don't trap
a light
that's just the luggage of 13 people
born game of Skippy ball I've ever seen
you're supposed to be able to catch it
look my dad's finally not wearing a
shirt or shirt the entire time at the
Disney Resort we get to Maui its shirts
off we had to stop playing skee-ball
because we kept annoying the people in
the pool like Matt originally suggested
to Josh but now we're going to walk to
find a really pretty place to see a
sunset and I lost my glasses in Pacific
Ocean and Rachel found them in the
entire ocean it's true it happened he
lost his glasses and then he got all sad
so he left the water and like ten
minutes later I felt something hitting
my foot and I grabbed them with my
monkey toes and I found them look like a
boss yes right there little ocean do you
see that ocean that's where I did it
well here's the sunset it looks like the
Sun that is setting
and it is setting and it is picture
sunsets are always gorgeous but I always
feel really lame posting them on
Instagram because I'm like it's it is it
really does anyone actually like seeing
this like I think he's pretty but aren't
people that view the picture are they
gonna be mad or not they're they're
going to think I'm lame for posting a
sunset picture because I don't want to
be basic
okay the water is
long time
room
what are you pick you got it
what's that ha ha he had been picking it
something and he's finally got it
something that occurred my eye and so I
my nose but I said I kept rubbing my
nose to try to find it and I finally
found it can't look like Steve either
something I probably video of the night
we're all out to dinner right now and
Parker has become me across the tape our
Matt wanted this shot I think we don't
know where he picks these things up

that adults deserve cotton candy

and Bailey's sleeping mouth and see if
she wakes up it's a separate
oh the parents don't like it apparently
