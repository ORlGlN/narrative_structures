all right it's Monday morning and I'm
going to go snorkeling with my father at
least that's the plan I always say
there's a plan and somehow everything
always goes wrong and I'm not doing
anything I don't know what's wrong with
this world but my dad and I are near me
we'll get snorkeling stuff and then
we're gonna try and find a good place to
snorkel and then if it's good we'll
bring everyone else but if it's not well
but yeah I want to go do something
awesome so I'm gonna go snorkeling with
my father and Matt I think it's going to
join us my dad and we're snorkeling matt
is attempting to put slippers on but
he's kind of failing at it
so we've been spending all day at the
infinity pool my dad just said the word
beyond and now we're gonna go back down
to the beach nothing much has happened
paddle boarding and Matt just ate it
it's really windy out here so I don't
think we're gonna be able to be out for
too long but it's fun
ah today was a water-filled fun day and
now I'm gonna go to the sunset go I'm
gonna collect the sunset with my sister
my mom my cousin Stephanie my whole body
is sore and that's the way I love to
Hawaii just everything I do is in
massive activity and my body is just
done at the other day and I have shin
splints right now and it feels so good
because I know I did something and I
wasn't just laying around um yeah now oh
my arms tired
oh my go to things awakened
yeah I got tired of just looking at the
sunset so I climbed on some rocks and
then Colleen followed there's the losers
up there scared of some rocks

bye-bye signs that once again we got to
close out you know what who cares my
clothes are on the nighttime or the
