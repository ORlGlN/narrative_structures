because I'm gonna blog Christmas
but anyway so to start off happy
Halloween
I have to get together my costume what

much I figure together my costume I'm
gonna be a prison guard because blaze is
going to be a prisoner or going to my
mom's I am going through my toy chest I
found my handcuffs I found my airsoft
gun I've got a flashlight I found I've
seen on TV aviators so it's going good
yesterday I bought a men button-up light
blue shirt and I just have to cut off
the sleeves to make it a prison guard
look and I'm wearing some black pants
it's a really easy costume because I
don't give a crap happy Halloween and
happy blog with I already finished
alright finished my outfit but I'm not
gonna show it to you guys until it's
time because it's so special but also
because I forgot to show it to you when

with sound effects my mom adds them for
me oh wait there you are
oh hi yeah I just went trick-or-treating
I'm not proud of it but a mom came up to
the door and I was like hi can someone
come trick-or-treat at our house then
left so I went and trick-or-treat it and
I got Stephanie a Reese's Peanut Butter
Cup but that was weird I my parents went
with me so don't worry
I had my adult supervision it's way
later we're watching the Dodger game
it's the bottom of the seventh there
have been no trick-or-treaters that's
okay cuz I'm a talking shoe it's true
but there have been no true to traitors
and it's so sad oh no one shirk intrude
scene where everyone just goes to like
one neighborhood but that's not our
neighborhood so there's no
trick-or-treaters I wanted to like do a
montage of their feet coming up to the
dome art I had a whole thing in my brain
