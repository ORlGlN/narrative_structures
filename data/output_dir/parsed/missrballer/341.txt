so I'm hanging out with my dad
all day today and guess where we are
it's just meeting my dad and we're doing
Disneyland together so I told my dad he
can plan all of Disneyland today
his day and he decided he wants to see
all the shows at Disneyland in
California Adventure so we're at the
Star Wars path of the Jedi neither of us
know what it is but he wants to do it so
we're doing there's no long show dad so
what we just watched was a massive
preview of all the movies put together
it was just like a massive summary it
was a trailer for the new movie but he
gave you the backstory but like I was
expecting something and it wasn't even
3d like they spray for air on you yeah
one point they sprayed era that theater
that we would - it had like the 3d
Michael Jackson it was like a 3d theater
this was no audience yes that one that's
what I figure up with but this was just
like oh here's a preview oh here's some
wind oh we ship your chairs that was it
whatever it was fun my dad all day this
is map-out attraction and attraction
he's planning it all by himself
my dad and I are about to go on Toy
Story Mania it's the first time I've
waited in a 40-minute line and was okay
with it because I'm gonna beat my dad at
the shooting game I'm gonna win okay so
we've gone on a few rides we went on the
cars ride we went the Toy Story Mania we
went on hyperspace mountain and now my
dad wants to go and this I don't know
what it is what is this place
superheroes something
it's just a museum so we're gonna check
out museum things dad that looks so
wrong that thing we were in was really
late and we left very quickly went to
Indiana Jones someone gave us passes
they're like these fast passes so we
just skipped the entire line
things are going free
so right before we got on the ride
someone has left this thing on the scene
of my dad and what is it Richard is
obsessed with solving the treasure hunt
what's in it
oh there's a mystery phrase we have to
figure out this is like a child menu at
a restaurant to keep them occupied but
we're gonna find them than that kind of
been we win my gold I bet you I bet you
looks like a million dollars in gold
the facts are watching all the terrible
shows that are at Disneyland and my dad
what is this called the Golden Horseshoe
review all right so it's a nice laughing
good time apparently
and what are we to go get a drink well
my dad went to get a seat and he got a
seat literally on the stage there's all
the normal seats and we're here I'm
gonna go down show you where my seats
are and how my dad's sitting
okay so - town has like iconic spots for
you to take pictures where my family
always has taken pictures and usually
super crowded and there was no one there
so I took a bunch of awesome pictures
we found one of the things on the
treasure map it was in the Mickey
fountain and tune town and I screamed
that and people around me we're looking
at me when it happened deal with it I
found a second clue is right there I'm a
treasure map queen and he's the king let
me see what the map says so the goal is
to fill out this word thing it's upside
down and we've gotten two letters and we
think it's gonna spell it's an adventure
if we do all this work and find out
that's what it was and we figured it out
after two letters Disneyland needs to
learn a challenge us better my dad and I
just ran from Thunder Mountain to
California Adventure cuz he wanted to
see a frozen show so we're we find the
contra computer it's like with one
minute to spare it's a what frozen
sing-along oh it's a frozen sing-along
excuse me
I have no puns that can be you
I'm never seen ready when rock guitar
in a series of doors in my face
to see
are gonna go on the ferris wheel
I've only been on the stationary one of
my dad's we've been on it never been on
the one to move either I know I first
you spit spits on me that's what pulling
got it
these things move and there are no sea
restraints there's no seat belts oh and
I'm so scared of who's the falling part
of this we're gonna start sliding we're
going around again and it gets scary
it's not gonna be that bad this time but
there are people screaming and other
baskets like bloody murder and it's
my dad wanted to see the Zootopia
15-minute sneak peak
because he thinks it's a show and we're
seeing all the shows today we saw a
preview for this before we saw sisters
which was a terrible movie
and a preview for this was terrible and
I'm about to sit through 15 minutes of
it as my dad thinks will be funny to
watch me suffer he spits on me and they
tortures me put on Tower of Terror and
while we're in there California
Adventure closed so there's like no one
here and I think that I should dance so
it came back to Disneyland to watch the
fireworks and then once we got a spot
they announced that they're most likely
going to be cancelled due to wind
conditions it's not windy right now guys
so my dad and I are just gonna head out
and if they start going off we'll see
them from wherever we are but we're
gonna beat this crowd
to the trance so we're just gonna go now
so we got back from Disneyland I had a
lot of fun
my dad is awesome he loves his in my
dad's just a massive child so it was
like being with a kid that doesn't need
to be help which is great the fireworks
I don't think ever went off so it was a
smart idea to leave we never finished
our treasure hunt but that's because we
realized that it says it's an adventure
and we didn't want to search for things
when we already knew what the treasure
was and it wasn't worth looking for I
hope you guys enjoyed this I had so much
fun with my father he's the best man on
the planet I love you guys I'll see you
soon goodbye oh oh my god this girl
straightening this girl not feel see out
that piece
