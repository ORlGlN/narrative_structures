good morning everybody
it's raining today it's a rainy rainy
day which I love like big mess not
sarcastic I actually love it
it's 2:30 look a little bit go and I
have a business call at 11:00 for a
potential brand deal sometimes when I do
it that's why I got phone call
why can't people put things and emails
like you asked them a bunch of questions
in an email they're like let's have a
phone call like no questions answer oh
that's my life I'm done with my business
call it went well it's a it's not
branded for me to post something that
I'm actually really in doing really
passionate about but I hope it works out
but yeah I always get so nervous before
phone calls I get freaked out I don't
know why because I'm a charming person I
am fantastic that was conversation with
so unreal I freaked out so much done but
it's over it's done
life okay so I just post in my blog and
I think I might do a little workout your
muscles worry so sad looking so I just
went to UPS and picked up a package I
don't quite know what it is I think that
it has to do people that pre-order my
book so I'm not allowed to talk about it
but something goes in the thing that
I've done and the thing is the nope
didn't say it any so there's on CBS
okay so I want to buy a bed today I want
to get a bed it's time in my adult life
to have a bed that's not just a mattress
on the floor so I wrote bed on my hand
to remind me all day
I need to buy a bed actually not only
two living spaces but the game ups was
like what's on your hand I was like
college is the word bed yeah let's do a
mere enough like I have to buy a bed
today that I was going to forget if I
didn't write down you start laughing cuz
all I thought you were suggesting
something like bed how does that mean a
come sleep with me
now it's what the button to do much
thing I want you to be this thing
dusting yeah
I'm alluding spaces what we do here just
go back back back back back
thought that was good because she nos
Grega sing and do it but it was part of
the rock record when buying a bed frame
you have to do the shin test are always
bad that you hit your on and then
you hate it grad to the shin test
that's a good good height good height
this one nope that's an area that's shin
area I think I like this bit but I don't
think I like that part because I can see
myself hitting my foot on that in the
morning they all seem to do that a
little bit don't think no people or to
hurt themselves
some bad dresser don't buy that dresser
I don't think I'm getting a bed frame
from here today doesn't really like any
of them if you keep searching I know the
mattress I want but I can't find the bed
frame for it I mean you really need a
ladder you reach it that's some short
personal stuff right there all right
so I bought a mattress online the purple
mattress I saw a commercial for it and I
thought it was funny and it got me
that's why I bought it
I like the commercial so good job
advertising good job but I don't think
we're going to get a full-on bed frame
we're going to get one of those middle
bar thingies but a more advanced one if
the bed sits on it's not on the ground
that's not a full-on bed frame because
we're only in this apartment for a few
more months and hopefully buy a house
over the summer and we move and then
I'll buy a fall of bed frame and stuff I
think this is the best decision I think
so I did I did my duty today
no I didn't there's so much stuff I
needed to do I didn't film a Tuesday
video tomorrow's Tuesday and I have to
film that in the morning I'm waking up
late am Dinkie I'm gonna go to bed
actually I finished you deserve a drink
and now I'm going to read is you okay I
need a few chapters or a few pages I
don't know how line is and I'm a little
bit
