Colleen the first thing about not
being America's that I can't watch that
1x so I'm in right hotel and I decided
to make myself some coffee and you know
how sometimes I have this Nair no dairy
creamers where they come in like sugar
packets and it's it's creamer for your
coffee this one knows it's not even
creamer
it just says whitener for coffee or tea
it knows it's not even creamer it's just
like it's just some white stuff in it
guys we had a bunch of time before Tech
and so I was like let's do something fun
let's go to the Calgary Tower any food
there we're going up really high right
now
- lease button box on an elevator

our show in Calgary and buy ours I mean
my sisters I just claimed it as my own
just lipstick on me so Calgary was great
the kids were amazing the audience is
amazing

sleep because I have to be at the
airport in seven hours cuz we're going
to Vancouver check it yeah F check bags
at the airport that's what I mean
today am NOT about no it's not it's 8
a.m. what wishful thinking I'm at an
airport you know it was an early and
rough morning when you look down as
you're peeing and you realize your
underwears on inside-out um
classy 6 is a day Canada all of your
buildings are just made out of glass
this is not safe get some cement in this
business alright so this is my fourth
time in Canada and I've never tried
poutine fries so I finally got some he's
just like gravy I don't know have you

about it I mean I think I'd rather have
normal french fries
sorry Canada I've disappointed you in
your poutine so we ate lunch I just
filmed and edited a video and now I'm
going to get coffee for the Queen and
myself because I'm really tired but I'm
always really tired so that's not really
saying much I've created a monster

really hate it though but you're still
playing it like I feel like it's not
real

cheating no it's not cheating at all do
you have to be a master of the mind
maybe go it's a lot that how come I pass
every little suck-up when you can't
figure it out you had to me and say do I
don't take a little bit of skill Oh
