hey guys I took out my glasses so I
wouldn't be static glare
hi I'm just about to edit my vlog and
then I know this is gonna sound weird
but I think I'm gonna shave my face
because I got laser we can get laser
hair removal I got it right here
it stick it's gonna take four sessions
to get it all to go away and you're not
supposed to wax or pluck in between
sessions because then you'll get rid of
the root and they laser the root and
they're like well you're just shave
because some hairs are growing back and
like we just shave them so I think I
might shape my mustache today ah the
things I share with the Internet okay so
I want to climb arrangers room but I
want to get rid of tiny little hairs on
my face so I think it's time that I
shaved my mustache already I just I
don't know if I can get you guys to see
the like they're there they are
Wow and a really chapped lip so let me
find some chapstick like my lips are so
ugly I consistently have a chapped lips
oh that's nothing new for me all right
so I just have my normal razor just kind
of like a weed great ideas but so fun I
mean so far
okay stupid shape with it against that
where did I get it wrong I think I've
got it I didn't shave my face there you
go well hairs are gone
I'm only doing only shaved because I'm
getting laser hair removal and you're
supposed to shave it between the
sessions but that was just weird to do I
feel so wrong I feel like I've messed up
the world and I'm gonna having the third
mustache yeah all right no I put makeup
on to go fill my Rachel's early see you
later
finish filming in Rachel's room and I
put all this makeup on for it and now I
have to take all the makeup off because
I'm going to the gym and I discovered
that if I sweat with a full face of
makeup on I get zits and so I don't want
that and I've been doing a lot of extra
steps in my life to make sure I don't
get pimples and it's been working but
sad full face makeup only on for 20
minutes it's the way it's like
I know if you guys can hear me but I
wanted to go on an adventure today
so my friend Brittany decided that she
would take me hiking and where are we
we're in solstice Canyon and she took me
to a burnt down house because she was
really nice but yeah
