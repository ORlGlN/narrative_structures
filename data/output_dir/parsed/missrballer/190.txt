sup this Saturday morning I don't think
I'm going to post a blog on Saturday I'm
going to do live strips on Saturdays
so this incident today is going into a
blog and posting Sunday that makes sense
anyway I just had my
snowboards picked up to get wet there is
a stick docks the hashtag not ad but
they pick up your snowboards and wax
them and bring them back to you
I didn't have to do anything and it was
fantastic once I had a house look at the
equipment to wax board myself but it's
kind of a mess so I'm just going to have
someone else do it and pretty cheap too
anyway so we just pick those clothes and
I think I'm going to do a little workout
shower and then get lunch and then do a
live stream after that alright so I just
did a workout and I got a shower back to
my makeup on a clean text means because
I want to give you a glam makeover for
video and I was like okay so I'm going
to go do lunch with Matthew and then go
over to clean to do a glam video who
knows what doesn't look like at the end
of that and then Matt night to go to the
store to get food for the Superbowl
party I am hosting a Super Bowl party at
Colleen and so Matt's can barbecue for
my whole family that'll be fun
I'm here has got to cleans I know her
she is Matt and I had lunch like right
next to Colleen so I just walked from
lunch to here I texted her she didn't
respond though Matt should find her I
don't look anything like me : just did
my makeup and slightly curled my hair we
were going to do a video or I put corn
rows in my hair but that was the only
idea and we didn't know what to do after
that or before that so we're not doing
that right now
maybe later in life and now I'm just
going to torture much further and take
me to my ex craft I do look luscious you
literally I don't look like me you your
makeup look exactly how you live your
day oh yeah that's how you do your
makeup like you lose so we're going to
go to a micro craft there's this pit
bull and I want it so bad pink weebly

the doggy and I'm very sad about it but
I'm closing out this vlog other guys
