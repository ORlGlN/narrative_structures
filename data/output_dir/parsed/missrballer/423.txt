9:30 a.m. I am outside of Party City
because I need to buy a sparkly Fedora
and pom poms for the show I completely
forgot about it until it's 40 when I
woke up I was like oh I should probably
get that done I'd stop at the post
office
a very nice stranger helped me because
none of the mail slots were opening so
he told me what to do
that was nice them anyway it's really
hot and I'm waiting for Party City to
open it opens in five minutes so once it
does I can buy things then go home and
edit and pack you're all about to make
fun of me oh by the way any makeup you
see in my face right now is leftover
from yesterday because I don't take my
makeup off at night rarely I rarely take
my makeup off at night and the next day
wide-open makeup on yesterday's
leftovers what was i man usually make
fun of me I needed to tell cuz I'm about
to pack up and my shampoos and
conditioners are wet so I was like I
need a towel but then I was like wait a
second I have these have a bunch of
these stupid little like magic towels
where they're all tiny until you put
water on and they go big it's like I
want to use this because what else am I
gonna fit so I'm gonna break this open
and watch it expand just realize is that
this won't work to dry off my stuff
because in order for this to work it has
to be wet so let's just expand it and
then use something else
says happy that's fun

pom-poms on my sparkly hat formulate and
