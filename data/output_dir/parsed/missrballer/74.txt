gonna go look at an open house

go see an open house and I'm going over
to Colleen's because Stephanie and
Andrew are coming to hang out for a bit
today and Colleen wanted to film a video
in the hot tub or something I don't know
I just know I had to shave today that's
my life and join me well you

party we're about to film a video and my
dog is over there pouting because we're
in the pool he doesn't like the pool I
told him to swim though or I tried I
never posted footage of that
here's that footage
hi your plan is to drink it all
so I went home so a blaze could have
dinner and I left him with Matt and I
just got back to Queens and no one's
here they're at the story but I walk
dead nothing it's so sad
anyway I think they're making breakfast
food for dinner I had a PB&J at home
because I know that nothing they make
I'm gonna be able to eat except maybe
hashbrowns

little better it's nice and hat go
