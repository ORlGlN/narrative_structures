players are from here they're massive
he could swoosh you they also gave us
t-shirts and even t-shirt episodes so
it's really row one like the clothes you
did before your courtside I have to say
SeatGeek hooked me up bro good I've used
them a lot in the past is how it the
last three NBA games I've gone to have
used them and they come to contact me
like hey I want to be friends and I was
like yeah be friends with you guys and
so that's how I'm here right now
they are breaking Oslo change that I've
been using see geek for a while it's a
great website because I put all of the
ticket things like from all the
different websites I just kind of put it
into one so you don't have to shuffle
around to find a better prices they just
do it in one spot but yeah use the
coupon code Rachel I put it on the
screen then you'll get 20 bucks rebate
on if you ever you know use them which
you should if you want to do anything
alright so real quick I'm going to show
you how the app works because it's
pretty easy you just open the app
alright and then you go to the me thing
click enter promo code and then use it
from a code Rachel you get 20 bucks
rebate on your next thing now when you
try and buy a ticket it shows you where
all the sections are where you're going
to be sitting the price is where they're
getting it from like it's pretty legit I
like it and it tells you how good a deal
is by the color which is nice for my
brain how it works I like it I use it I
used it before we're friends so now
we're best friends and it's the best
thing in the world
