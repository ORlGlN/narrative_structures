hey everybody today is Christopher's
birthday so I'm going to dinner with him
and his family
I don't know also gonna be there sure
it'll be lovely human being so that's
what I'm gonna do today and they're
gonna go to do the indoor skydiving
first I've already done it and I don't
want to spend the money on it
just cuz I've done it before and it was
cool but I don't really need to do it
again but I'm gonna go and watch them do
it cuz that's gonna be awesome to watch
the kids do it I think they'll like it
I don't think Parker will be able to do
it he's too tiny he will just get blown
straight up to the roof and that's it
so yeah that's what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna get dressed I found a Rachel's
room today did my makeup already so I
don't have to do it again today what do
I do that I'm like I'll film on days
where I have to go out therefore I have
to do my makeup less throughout the week
laziness at its finest not always its
efficiency it's saving makeup so I don't
through my makeup every day just like
every other day but I got to change
though
this is not Christopher but this is
what's Christopher supposed to do he
wanted to go indoor skydiving for his
birthday Christmas would have a man like
holding him I think Christmas laughs to
be able to do any of this
the sacre-coeur is going to have the guy
like flipping him around
I see children that belong to
Christopher coming out soon know they're
going to do this and it's going to be
funny they're all sitting right there
the coolest people ever this is
nerve-racking
oh I think Haley Bailey's going first
for sure you're saying people now
Bailey's gonna love it
who she's coming I wonder if she likes
it do you think she likes it Parker
she's having fun I think so too
there he is happy little bug and she a
happy little bug yeah no she's not a
happy about what is she
she's a bail yeah she's a bayley Jacob's

Oh Christmas battle goin this has got to
be hilarious
they're laughing at him my heart just
sank
you got friend in me
one
we're all at dinner and we just finished
eating and we've destroyed everything
there's a lot of fun awesome
are you trying to break up on muscle
hold on Christopher use your muscles
hey when he was trying to get off the
rock he was it I don't know what oh wow
taught her well
what did the clam say when the muscle is
taking up all the space on the rock
you're claiming me it's a shelter
I thought your clam in me was butter
hanayo you're so selfish just like your
dad wait what do your dad dance do it
so I just got home and I had a lot of
fun I hope Christopher had a very happy
birthday he seemed to have fun in the
fly thing we had a great dinner and we
had an awesome dance party afterwards I
just got home and I checked my jury
status and they told me to check again
tomorrow and I just remembered because
my cousin texted me that we got like the
same jury duty thing so and he keeps
getting postponed so we're really hoping
that we're gonna have to go in and we
serve on the same trial because we would
rule all how awesome would that be to
have your cousin your buddy on up in a
jury with you I don't know if that's
legal but I'm totally for it alright
that's it for this vlog thanks for
watching guys make sure that you had
wished Christopher a happy birthday also

mine was actually some really good jokes
