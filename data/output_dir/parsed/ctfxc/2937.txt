there's a good idea Ally's favorite
place look at that that's cool
it's really crazy like this tree was
barren last night and now during the day
it's crazy and at Bourbon Street driver
which is back and forth awesome but
school keep thinking like all this was
underwater really really weird to think
about like it's unbelievable knowledge
how much they've fixed everything in
such a short
all right we're gonna go check out where
the levees are and gets right over there
give me the big idiot sorry I had to go
for the pigeon
watch the trolley so these are the
floodgates these are what broke no this
is not the levee this is one of the
flood gates but isn't what happened like
the flood gates broke I know
classiness
it's like in Valencia
Johnny's po-boys Bailey's the best boys
it brings please the Zoey horse whines
everywhere
what is that sweet potato fries
like sugar and cinnamon
like a good helluva near-perfect art
form so what'd you think of your first
pole boy they need it all
that's a lot of beads on that pole up
unless the better party party animal
there I know what's going on oh my god
Oh check the ice is here I think we
found Bourbon Street again
not very hard to find is it
okay you get the fire ladies
all right we found Canal Street but
where's the parade
where's the parade go at least on the
street we were looking for
Oh
it seems little bit more packed today
ah
Oh
beats are flying everywhere
it's like a war zone here with feed
they try to negotiate
really
Oh
the gender the game
really into it
we do the women who have a little bit of
dignity and self-respect Mardi Gras is
weird
tonight
that's such a good idea
ah
you scared me elephant ears the greatest
invention on the planet okay
funnel cakes our elephant ears elephant
ears definitely elephant ears little
cakes a table quickly the bonus money
check funnel cake oh wait a minute
well that's the parade that we can't get
you because there's lots of other people
wait do I stop it on how I stop okay so
we're gonna check out the world famous
cafe du monde
just powdered fried siliceous now
like Tyrell big but me
whoo
my own trick oh look like it crack it
I used to do this to you all the time
when my sister was little she would eat
like an elephant here I'd be like I have
some okay so I was just waiting in line
as you can see the nice long line over
there and I'm sitting waiting in line
and there's two drunk girls behind me
and she's like I'm sorry to bother you
okay go to you know go to the restroom
in front of you and stuff like that and
don't you hate when people try to cut in
front of you right especially a girl
they try to do the whole girly thing so
I said that if she won
paper-rock-scissors
she would win she would go she ended up
winning
she ended up winning but here's where
the story gets a happy okay
so we're talking out she was like oh you
know can I go I'm again you wanna smoke
and another girl came by she's like I'm
sorry I really have to go use the
bathroom I'm really kind of sick and the
girl who once said no and just as she
said no vomited all over the place
including the girl then she said no too
he's having way too much fun
that's your sexy
is not a religion even though it's older
than Christianity
Oh
Hey
something I'm noticing the value of the
bead is not the bead itself I think it's
the hang time because look they're all
down there
those are worthless but what's our up
there
man
so how'd they're doing
so what they're doing is they put
crushed soda cans on the bottom of their
feet and they're not tap shoes or actual
soda can
really
people
this looks very intense
think they know I'm here
Oh
that's a giant chicken that's a giant
chicken
this isn't working very well
it's like a Slayer concert
well I think that was a pretty awesome
night want to say thank you to Hotel
provincial for being an awesome place
so our first time at Mardi Gras I would
definitely say that was I'm starting
picking my sock I had two socks on each
foot kind of so cold I would say it was
pretty interesting uh what do you think
