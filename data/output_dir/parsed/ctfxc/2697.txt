good morning day one of Frank House
officially starts today I don't really
know what we have in store but it begins
everyone's still sleeping
except mat Sam are you eating
on the streets
technology for planning a prank wait you
know we're planning we're gonna
basically duct-tape steer to this chair
and then roll them out to the paintball
thing for more points we're trying to
get a bunch of points
like to go jelly Zoey Zoey
that is hilarious
you can't believe I just forgot to film
it okay everybody on Twitter just had
zero followers that was my screenshot
are you kidding me
and I will venture into the depths of
Molly's nose good morning Zoe have you
been scaring our neighbors like come out
of the bathroom that's what I find oh
okay oh right in the stomach I spent
like six months in Kuwait just you see
all the yo-yo professors like what Anu I
think half the YouTube audience actually
doesn't even know what a yo-yo is crap
yes
another fail you like the giant chicken
I was collecting all of the packages
that you guys have still lovingly sent
to us somebody actually stopped me and
said hey seeing your YouTube feed before
and they were very nice and they helped
me with the mail so I didn't actually
get his name but dude in the awesome hat
thank you that was very nice of you how
gorgeous it is
well she going at me try some flowers
they're so beautiful
oh my gosh it's our one-year anniversary
of being engaged I have the best fiance
in the world I love you honey thank you
what are you talking about crazy woman
okay so yes I'm freaking out sorry guys
is it weird
is it weird the curls freak out over
flowers I feel like it would be nice to
get a guy flowers too but I but I don't
know I just always freak out about that
I don't know I really don't know why I
think it's more like the gesture
that was a good one
you just spread the video
I like prank house I am a mouse that is
inside of the house
it's like every five minutes somebody's
getting pranked here let's look at slap
the steering racks this arm when he
wasn't looking
we got five points I would be so nervous
oh right so get more
Sam what are you doing in the kitchen
cleaning up good okay
just careful Cory's around the corner
that's what you get so it's actually
shaving cream
how many parks is that what is that
comedy baby card would you do would you
do hope it's going to be hypnotised
should relax your body with my friend
Christine hello we're getting
chick-fil-a and I'm gonna crash this car
no not I'm a safe I'm a very safe driver
gonna go don't go do you want to go do
you want to go in the car trying to go
for a car a car
we were just what was the noise we were
just walking out of the apartment to get
in the car and we heard this noise and
the bushes to our right and all of a
sudden it was like oh jeez that way she
sees a reflection I don't know what it
was it was a velociraptor how did you
just do your hands are dripping she's
got freaking everywhere what are you
doing give me stamps and lettuce
that good Sam delicious
nom-nom-nom-nom-nom job he loves it
okay so the game is on Charles has mark
riders on his face
III want to know from here to here how
to do this good
so Matt's under hypnosis hazard never
make an I believe that this is the
electric chair I don't you guys believe
in hypnotism
do you yes the person is just a mere
dream all right you guys what do you
wanna do camera what is going on
there's no idea of going on okay this is
ridiculous she said she slammed manis my
face came downstairs and did this the
quarry I said what are you do to her I
don't know get her pregnant
or memory back some are going dismissed
and we're going that way and we're going
this way and I think what all types so I
look through the deck except for one
card you see that here's the craziest
part the craziest part of the whole
trick is I had to fix everything right
so every card is fixed itself but I mean
really it's fixed itself even through
all that shuffling every single card is
a new deck coder ace through King in
each suit even your card the ten of
Spades green colors orange hands orange
yeah
initiated
that's why my hair's greasy this is not
wet this is mayonnaise does that say
what does that say outrageous nice I was
thinking terrifying but there's a lot of
room does that mean it's time for bed
okay so both of these little munchkins
are all curled up hope you guys had a
great day it was Charles in my one-year
