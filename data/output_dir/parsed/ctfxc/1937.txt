I see London I see France I see Ally's
Underpants there are no look at this
people are just driving there are no
lanes there are kind of wings but no one
obeys that they're just going I think
everyone's pretty much just distracted
by that
I feel you guys aren't on time at haha
we have that we have to do a scene from
a movie so we're doing inception for a
challenge Jimmy's gonna be just
gordon-levitt yeah updates real real is
the Triomphe or triumph or we're there
what this giant arts thing there's
somebody on there that's not real right
she's like yeah that's true doesn't want
to make me go into that story that's for
sure it's very off-putting yeah donating
to the cause of the homeless puppy he's
really cute we have to do this scene
right and we need to that Braille up and
the guy was yelling at Jimmy so I'm just
like oh yeah she's allergic to the Sun
and it was so appropriate because she's
like seeing their holy believes it's
either inception or Jurassic Park right
not
do it again don't get through the APEC
and look at Megan
I only tried to do it I did it one time
that's the big good day let's go oh come
on thank you for the encouragement
there's no signs get that book okay
that's pink that's blue this has to be
so confused let's try this Metro if you
want to see that little fun little video
we just did there's a metro upload it on
our iPhone channel so you can click in
the video description you go check that
out or on the screen or whatever but
Jimmy Wang edited and then strawberry
Seventeen's on there I wouldn't upload
it but I figured you know would be kind
of a little thing to do so you want to
go check out that video
see she's working out
it's a warp speed button
I've never seen an actual subway system
with gates must be really busy down here
even in New York they don't even have a
game you could literally just fall in oh
wait let's exit
we're inside the Louvre and of course an
Apple Store
I was checking YouTube and I got all
confused I was like typing stuff I
forgot about the whole azerty instead of
40 so for example that's what it looks
like when I try to go on our YouTube
channel here's a little-known fact if
you guys touched the point to where
these two triangles meet you get super
super awesome lock I need to go do it I
just made that up Quincy it's gonna be
the new thing now you get super good
luck right now but I didn't get a good
luck now if you guys are ever here
go to the Louvre put your like hand
right there take a photo and @reply me
that's the new thing it's good luck you
guys want good luck I mean if you don't
want good luck it's no big deal you know
I don't eat red meat right I had to do
this it has a mixed bag gasps I'm gonna
do it I'm just I'm just gonna do it make
back in
I had to do it we cry again no they come
over here so they will have quarter
pounders they have we're inside the big
giant glass pyramid this place is so
good what was here Wow whoa
we got a sensor these got a sensor those
ones with you can't show any weaknesses
on there I'll do you think that is say
paratroopers come down what you staring
at guys what you staring at you guys
know this that in um you know these
statues how they're all white well
there's no competition again but how
they're all white and actually when they
were done they were actually had color
obviously over the thousands and
thousands of years they've faded like so
I don't know that looks completely
honest if these were all in color I feel
like it'd be a little bit much easier in
the comments you think statues with the
color would be cooler or having it like
this a little a little intellectual
debate down there in the comments anyone
recognize that sculpture
huh it's a little bit different
whoa so impressive look at the
perspective right here
could you imagine the dude commissioned
to do this he's like yeah also
it's the Mona Lisa
why is it missing like one
you know
if you move anywhere in the direction
like looking at them on the Lisa it
looks like your eyes are falling it's a
watch
looks like she's looking at us over here
still looking at us and still looking at
us isn't that kind of crazy David and
Goliath yeah
anyone recognize that famous sculpture
you know it's kind of famous I don't
know if you know it leave it in the
comments you know Apple Steve Jobs just
saw this they're like you know we should
really do the first guys remember those
four horses and out Venice Italy we're
at Napoleon you know took the horses
brought him over here yeah these are the
replicas and then they brought the
originals back to Venice
buh-bye louvre bro this is kind of what
it would be if we got to go in a little
model top of the city yeah there's the
subway go further that's where they all
are you scared I think so No
no I don't so many other things I'd like
to eat Miami that's where the guilty
need be right that's a nice looking
glass of something red in it there you
go
you ever round you yeah I made the right
decision Steve is basically Wikipedia we
basically had to think of somebody who's
now alive anyone give the year they were
born and died in 1915 in 1963
Oh 1961 to 1997 1901 through 1966 Wow
1678 to 1741 1914 to 2000 this table was
fan engines Alec Guinness
Oh 1942 mm okay 1882 to 1942
oh yeah it's a tough he's not very well
known I guess
it's one of the barriers so if you guys
want to play a game
just at reply Steve it's Steve
underscore Jay underscore Ellison elo is
o n the person's was there when they
were born and when there was something
really famous when they were born and
when they died and if he has some some
time he'll out reply the answer to you
