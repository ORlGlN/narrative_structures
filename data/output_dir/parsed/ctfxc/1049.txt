plane very very first or as soon as I
possibly can because the first thing you
do is you put the armrest down because
that way people don't lose over it's
like this the whole
so I definitely need a nap but back to
the future - is on right now our
Saturday well other people are freezing
their ass off I just noticed I think
it's it's snowing or raining and then I
realized we were in New York
sure enough it's snowing right now but
we're gonna kind of have like a little
sister day today it's so much fun
earlier so much fun earlier at the
morning markets so many cool things I
got my kombucha which is something that
I love and you know I'm sure a lot of
other people love it too but there's a
local place that makes it in st.
Petersburg and I'm just obsessed with it
it's know as much cooler the inside get
it I'll just know everywhere wish I
could show you guys kind it looks on a
camera we're trying to get the snowflake

actually trying to make birthday plans
for Caitlyn because her birthday's
coming up how old are you I know she
talks about it like it's such a bad age
when I just turned 28 in charge we're on
our way to 30 we're on our way to San
well chars already there he's about to
surpass it so is her husband actually um
Thomas 30 and the entire day wasn't
allowed to say the number 30 he was so
pissed every time I said something about
being 30 years old do you think it's
appropriate to like ask a guy how old he
is
yes like do you think they get offended
I don't know for women I think that you
never guessed the age don't do that no
never stupid or always yes lower than
what you and you actually think is the
truth perilous isn't like 36 degree
