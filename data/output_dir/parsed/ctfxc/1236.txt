but to judge a judge about to teach
attention to to the freaking switches I
just I learned the switches in my own
house I learned the switches in here
tonight at 3 in the morning I guess
would be morning tomorrow morning I got
to do my ritual waking up at 3 a.m. and
attempting hopefully to get the iPhone
what are you guys gonna get the iPhone 6
or 6 plus I was actually going back and
forth about that I should get the 6 plus
but I actually think I would actually do
it but Ali has one of the galaxies and I
think by the way she might switch to the
dark side the only thing was trying to
fit it in pockets which I feel like is a
dumb dumb reason not to do it fill your
shoes you say thank you for the bear
something I speak we waiting for
somebody else just show the internet we
have to do we don't have a belt
