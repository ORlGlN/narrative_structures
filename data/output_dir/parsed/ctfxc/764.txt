good morning Internet familiar place
ready so we came down today to get Ali's
car we left up here in the garage if you
guys noticed that what you haven't been
driving and I was caught in a while and
then I got eventually kind of like paint
this and get some of these things out
it's my dad's car one of his cars and
then caked only these things out of here
and I kind of think some of these are
just like collectible stuff let's see
yeah the starting lineup starts got do
that
and kind of clean up a little bit before
we put the house on the market she's a
bird so weird we were told that
apparently the Gator was getting so
freakin long remember that thing that
was over there
apparently end up with like 6 or 7 feet
some huge amount so they had to get him
out I guess that was a trap or something
so as you could see the trap is gone and
we got a notification that they got him
so hopefully they took him to some sort
of you know Gator Gator farm or some
sort of refuge this is definitely
something I don't forget making sure
that Marley's not running after
everything really cherishing that
freakin fence now just wish they allowed
me to put a fence back here all those
years over been so much more relaxing
Marley why can't you just be like Zoe
this is chill in there there's just so
crazy how open it looks now Marv are you
happy to be back here so I'm coming out
here checking out char because he's
taking out his most favorite piece I
believe of this house which happens to
be something connected to Wi-Fi yeah you
know there's no Wi-Fi here anymore
No are you having trouble yeah it's
enough fitting or something or it's not
coming out I'm not a little option
let me help you no no you can do it sure
the fuzzy little I'm sure you know I
love it
I'm sure I'll figure out to put it in
but the problem is an input incorrectly
are you done Charles Trippy nature
welcome ladies and gentlemen this is how
you don't but a door handled together a
lock and key so weird
could it okay here's the thing
like it's like a bar but it's like
Spanish well what indoors to expand
especially with the water of this thing
expended let me see give me five wait
keep twisting it twist it there you go
look at that are you admitting that I'm
cracked hey who went outside

doing going now I know I'm uh
change is hard sometimes here's another
time you know but you like come back
here I mean I know it's like a big part
of Charles life but I spent some time
here with him too and it's beautiful
house and I know it meant a lot to him
so coming back here yeah it's first
first house the name means locked him to
come back here and hang out all right
you never know that's why you figure it
out I have a bucket of keys on my
keychain those do where everyone along
yes yes I don't have any why sneak it
out of you Marley I just like that
wireless key stuff
because I mean obviously people didn't
break into a house as well the people
already make that arguing is like one of
the skis he's not like people could
happen and break them it's like become
people could break your window too you
know it's like the same thing you agree
with me on this so right yes Charles
wants to put this Wi-Fi dorky whatever
shenanigans front door keep I don't know
what you want to call a lock on another
door in our house and I am NOT full of
it

picture yeah you're so clever
fancy using using cameras who knew you
saw Alan I talking I have this cash box
