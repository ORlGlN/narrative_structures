around Portland four million three
seconds and everything stopped like
fucking forget how much I love Portland
and the donuts and everything
all right we're gonna go high go back to
the bus I don't warm up a little bit I
won't let my feet skateboard
so I'm having this argument right now
with Ally about iPhones and Samsung's
and look at this I'm actually losing
right now because she looks like she's
in a frickin bad animation skype
actually might be winning against this
right now like what the audio is fine
but now you still stuck underwater not
poor connection this is actually pretty
awful well look I found a sister snuck
into work tour I didn't speak in the
work tour he's stuck in the work door he
admits it every single day in your
lifetime that's a lot okay remember I
was talking about Portland but now

Secret Service right yeah
hello it's loud I'm just doing a second
hearing let's fill here
Highschool it's just a monitor in their
monitors is there anything going on the
kid here nobody wants to playing right
now what's wrong with me or anything
Travis do those little whatever those
are
good luck push-up make some weird one
a few days ago when I fell off a
skateboard I'm sure everyone does fit
what's the one that bandaged me up she's
basically checking out my wounds so if
you see her warped or hopefully it's not
a good situation you guys are injured
but it says men say hi give her a high
five that right there
high five you were high five right at
the practice anyone doesn't know what a
high by this do it again slow motion
so now that I have a personal paramedic
min I figured I can go skip or anymore
set a really big deal
but you know what a really annoying
thing is is when soda tastes like a
medicine like when they do the like
cherry vanilla cream like when they try
to do these weird concoctions of flavors
and it just tastes like poop or like
robitussin or something like that like I
said it's complaining over some stupid
but I'm still weird I don't get it
one group here Carolee Starbucks says
root beer now stick it to coffee now
it's just to repair all the time market
guys June 29th possibly the best day of
catering burritos burrito these are
enchiladas I'm sorry these are
enchiladas that bring those by mistake
thank God I corrected that everyone
would have totally called me out of that
so basically doing another little last
walkthrough before you have to lean
forward basically what I try to do we
don't have an official of a visual
signing I either sign after the show my
side of the stage or I just want around
the venue we just say hi to Ray the
people what what I do is after the show
I sign for every single person that's
one thing I will make sure I do that or
until I get kicked out a lot of hardcore
bands on the
kind of figured out a lot of hardcore
bands I can dig it though show me the
breakdown breakdown boss

dokkan I may or may not take this with
me coming hearing going to Florida but
do it I was read it read it
wrote it right into the trailer twice
feel like when you ride a BMX bike you
look like an idiot when you're riding so
basically you have to stand up what you
can't do right now because if I do I'm
going to fall cuz I'm vlogging hey what
it worked good catch
so I'm going home for a couple days it's
