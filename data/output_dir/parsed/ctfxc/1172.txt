morning front view part that was scary I
guess seriously best boyfriend in the
world it's even right now best boyfriend
world
what is this pumpkin bread rewards so
have you been ice skating probably 12 14
tops we're gonna go to the iconic whoo
so I decided to take Ali to Rockefeller
Center and go on the little ice skating
rink I know I did the one at the other
park with Justine but I don't think I
did Rockefeller Center like game called
Charles is complete idiot if you guys
were playing you would know that when I
pointed to Rockefeller Center
I was actually pointing to the Empire
State Building see the reason I didn't
know if King Kong was not fair I know
that's my favorite thing to do is get
underneath the Empire State Building and
look straight up it's like almost like
vertigo and try to walk
Alys like the cutest New Yorker she's
like excuse me use me use me it's like a
hockey game I know it is check this out
before your breakfast you literally
throw down your gloves and your beanies
it makes our fight I'm not even throat
I'm just gonna do it all with it on
how fast your Subway's go I would say I
was the guess I'd say 70 miles an hour
there's gotta be somebody in the
internet that knows this question and
now all of a sudden Ali turned to a
giant pool ball going ice-skating deck I
get this on my festive socks you know
you're jealous ready I think so
you look like you're in Alaska you got a
bed feel like I'm gonna fall these
little kids are killing me that's what
happens when you from Florida guys it's
embarrassing
let's do some triple axels ready
I could totally do that it's so undo
right now I don't wanna make her cry if
I go down babe I'm taking you with me
you know I needed to do is I just gotta
get a kid that's lowered to the ground
God knows that's not mean you're like
look at the tree first part is like when
you're professionally falling it's like
you know you're gonna go so you just try
to look like rescue yourself okay have
you impressed you impressed it can get
your number bed
I can't do this
I stopped
this is embarrassing
Siwon watching
I was gonna do this the whole time that
little kid right there was hitting on
Ally earlier
he was totally hitting on Ally I had to
step in I was like bro you got back off
bro I can go backwards this one I got
this
thank you I got the bed
I've only fallen once I'm sorry if the
camera had to drop the camera okay twice
oh I just noticed there's like breaks in
the front you know that I know it's like
all of a sudden it's like falls out of
my hands
I'm out again
Gulam thought you were pushing around
this whole time they're pushing me this
whole time
are you getting go fast
well too fast so we just went
ice-skating amazing and ugly sometimes
like 12 so cool thing it seems like so
many spectators - so I have a feeling
like a lot of you would stay on the
outside they don't want to be the person
that claws
which are was that person that we're
decorating the Rockefeller tree right
now you guys ever wondered how they did
it I never actually thought about how
they pruned it and actually decorated it
makes sense get fun that's a lot of fun
so annoying live for Radio City Music
Hall yep get out of the way there we go
live from Radio City Music Hall in his
alley
and a big poufy jacket we were walking
like we're walking by the water and
something called out I think something
perked in Ally's little radar I don't
even want to know how you those were
there
let me feel all this makes me feel super
I remember all these history starts here
our history starts great my history
started right about definitely play back
the color thinking about that you own
all these things but eventually you lost
all those and they're probably worth so
much my mom saw hardly see that's why I
like I save every iPhone iPod I think
it's kind of this is exactly what I can
do
I'm such a nerd
No

them up just beautiful
