this is a metaphor babe do we go right
or do we go left all right
we came out here last time it's
preserved but we didn't go to this trail
so we figured we try this one
it was actually kind of nicer because we
got cell signal so if we get lost last
one we didn't have cell signal which is
kind of crazy to think about cuz we did
you really okay this is a big thing to
do okay
so we are allowed to make fun of Ally
right now he says my memory is bad that
is a big goof
your mom's a goof check it out the hey
boo he's such a scaredy cat is that you
ma'am you're disrupting nature through
that cellular device just in case you're
curious this is North by a process of
elimination this must be south yeah so
far this trail is a lot cooler than the
other one the other one we were just
wait mangrove these are things in
Florida if you disrupt them or cut them
you get thrown in jail do you know what
the the penalty is for messing with the
mangroves
I was jail time I just don't know what
it is so we do not mess with that are
you going to jail no I can't protect you
I can't protect you so this I go he's
always the only one I ever trust to walk
herself do you guys remember years ago
when we lived in Tallahassee a giant
woods that we would always go and just
walk around and Zooey Marley would just
run around that's actually where I
filmed that video or Marley's dressed up
like a squirrel and she's just running
around in the woods as a squirrel
yeah that one all I remember is that was
like my favorite place to go so I go to
when I was like stressed out that looks
so cool you know that toy where you grow
crystals in that little jar that's what
that looks like right now that's so cool
I know yep they hang out with me so he
went up there with Alli pretend like you
like me all she wants to do is run away
she just wanted to run away now I'm all
by myself oh you want to do it yeah
you're gonna be a gummy bear for a gator
don't do that actually I don't think
there's Gators here cuz it's all
saltwater so I think you're okay so
Marley found this you guys see it's an
armadillo didn't get closer oh he's gone
he's fast holy crap is fast so that's
what Marley was looking at
we just thought she was crazy yeah she's
nuts you say makeout point those are
usually people get murdered babe I took
every horror film is like you go to a
lookout point or makeout point that's
not a horror film no keep going
I'll go in this way we'll see comes back
first the blondes are usually the first
one to go in horror films that's cool
Ellie thinks that could possibly be a
gator if there's the only one way to
find out get stay back there I think
it's just a rout babe scared I think
it's a rout hold on and verify
yeah it's just a rout this is kind of
cool I'm pretty proud of ourselves two
days of like two days this week we found
two places we've never been
I like this adventure stuff where's the
crab yeah that trees got crabs that tree
is riddled with crabs let me see her
he's way up there if I let you run
Marley will you go to her I actually
never mind I don't know this is all
marshy this could be alligator heaven
right here I know you just hold on you
don't know where she is anymore he came
see her she's gone behind makeout point
so this is makeout point
yeah I can't lie with you this is the
most lame makeout point ever a really
great lookout point either mangoes just
keep going and going and going
you would Julie nature you stop and
enjoy nature appreciate it
so you appreciate nature that's so cool
though
what is though it's so weird
that's what it looks like underneath
well there's nothing in it obviously
they're like armadillos they're so weird
what is that so check it out oh sorry
I'm scaring Zoey it's the funniest thing
in the world
now they spotted it in the door dude
whoa i'ma see if I can get a better shot
of it this time
I hear him
we have to do otherwise I wouldn't have
gotten that shot at all
Ali is so cute she reminds me like a
little girl she's like maybe it's the
same one maybe it's following us it's
cute I think it's adorable I can only
hope our daughters as cute as you
holy scat Marley's flipping her ear up
that means she's tired
I think Zoe's tongue is there Lucy Yuto
that tongue Zoe like we always say Zoe's
part anteater I always feel like such an
idiot that we live in such a cool state
and we don't often get the chance to go
wander around like this that's the most
haunted place if you guys didn't that
that's the oldest city and the country
oh good I was kind of briefly scared but
yeah I didn't see I seen my oldest city
in the country I know it's like one of
the most haunted ones that's the reason
why Ali wants to go answer is why I
don't want to go all right what's over
there there's a dog treat in there if
you find it you get it we're gonna try
trick that Zoe used to be able to do
really really well and I have actually
not done it in a long time you know like
when you put it on their nose and flip
it up she used to get it every time sit
ready
that way hold on no kid you just put it
in my mouth
never wear
bang
all she does is breakdance now if you
remember yesterday we decided to buy one
of those Easy Bake Ovens
my sister had this as a kid and I was do
you have one - I did you did our using
mini pickles I'm about to embark on
something that I have actually not been
able to do I don't think my little
sister actually let me do this what can
you make of this can make actual right
is this edible food they give you an
actual little drink so one and a half so
first you pour the brownie mix I have
chocolate chips we've said chocolate
chips in it
ll they do the smallest brownies but
it's feel like the biggest spatula
already on preheat for 20 minutes so
that kids can learn how to do stuff on
their own when they're young it's kind
of cool
looks like proof Cheryl press the
mixture together into a thick and Joey
is it thick and don't okay
are these cookies or these brownies it's
one you turd
press each fall down using the palm of
your hand to make six flat cakes all of
your hand my hand doesn't fit you're not
a child so it wouldn't work very well
you guys want to see my thumb prints dry
bake for 12 minutes
don't use your hands and use the big
stick you can't do this one go in there
we're learning the falsies of this
already stopped when the baking line on
the handle on line adds up with the edge
of the facing side on this - knife just
a little bit see the whole point of what
we're doing right now is we want to try
to find old childhood games and items
and kind of test them out so we'll do
like a CTFxC test old game save the
thing and wanted to kick it off with the
youth maybe we'll do the ease of the
creepy-crawler which by the way Ali
found out you cannot eat them but what
they have but they do have an edible
version the one I had was not edible
thank God yeah so we both are right
there EA like plastic done ding ding in
my indical intersection I can't go
anymore
actually I think it has a pub that's why
that actually work they're really hot
what hey Dad Oh lost their brownies
Fridays are done that is so cool
I cannot believe that Ali is putting the
nice little sprinkles on it
no the frosting and then the sprinkles I
just thought about this we should bring
this stupid thing on the tour bus we
make little brownies and cookies the
whole time I picked some bands with come
up like hey guys we borrow your oven
really quick I gotta make something
totally don't worry about it I got to
make something don't ask
I'm just gonna pull it out that was
freaking high for bly fault a child
actually did come up pretty nice doing
cute I mean like the goodbye is a little
kid is so much fun with this or if
you're a thirty year old adult
has it done like cookie I well then
again all right let's try one you try
for us because you made him now we both
made him cheers dude it doesn't taste
like a brownie
it tastes like when we did those tiny
those tiny burgers and stuff yeah but
this is better I'm not talking about
making fake meat creeps me out
it's chocolatey but it doesn't really
taste like a brownie mm-hmm this is way
cooler than I thought it would have been
way cooler so that's what they look like
is my pinky my pinky Dwarfs it
boom I'm gonna go with a a five star
rating yep I'm gonna go with a four and
a half that was fun
