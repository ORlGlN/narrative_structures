podcast meal uncensored which lists a
Tuesday yeah so that means when you're
watching this the next episode episode
two is now available I'll put a link in
the description I'm actually going right
now to see if I can help them with new
microphones I want to get a little bit
better microphones so I'm trying to find
a little bit nicer microphones so if I
get my Yeti and a nice gold one
to make them look all snazzy so the
problem we're having earlier is because
still mics were all the same when you
plug the USB mics into the computer it
just computers it's like big figures out
and just thinks they're all the same mic
so the lady told me to get an ice which
is snowball ice get it yeah so basically
that way when Holly must want to do some
like guest stars on their podcast
they'll have like three or four mics and
get the little vo uncentered super
