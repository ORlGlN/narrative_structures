good morning Internet so as you can see
it's not pitch-black out right now they
did some super suit sleuthing and warp
tour doesn't start till 1:30 p.m. ten
instead of the original 11:00 a.m.
because yesterday was punk-rock bowling
and a pretty shirt if your crew of warp
tour is going to be sleeping in a little
bit which means though I did something
like I said super sleuthing did he do
better on that one and I got a later
flight so instead of waking up at 4:00
a.m. I got the wake up at 8 a.m.
this is definitely the worst part about
going home in between shows is the
actual leaving because you get all set
into your ways of work tour or just tour
you know going into your bunk and just
things like that and then when you go
home you get that kind of the offset and
you get to see everyone ie this little
word how hot will it be in Phoenix
Arizona today
it should be a bit warm in Phoenix
Arizona up to about 100 degrees
does
you have to go back unless you I can't
see in place
all right cameras going off and we're
back here Azealia have a count
Ali he's actually ring
how many lights I've taken just in this
year alone like how many times I've been
for this Airport actually thinking about
it I don't want to know it's probably
they're depressing actually
the Italian of eight miles bigger like a
hundred thousand
almost a million by our
and just a couple years I think the
coolest part about the whole situation
known is you know being able to travel
that much then the sad part about it
it's the fact that I've been sitting on
a tiny chair that much
however hands down worth coming home for
just a couple days so worth it just to
be able to hang out with that like a
zillion mohali and diesel I do it every
time just for one day I've done up for
one day
Jason
so traffic just guys you can get to back
thank you very much violence appreciate
that so we got in it is 12:30 and we
just get gonna upset time is 7:20 p.m.

take like a pod can play just think of
me would have taken that floor and play

would have been able to fly back to
Florida and back out there is everywhere

started crying a little bit after Jenny

the spell/trap there was this baby that

liked air at the Tahoe
that's not her Tara back in the day had
like a green Honda Civic like the very
first one were made and her name was the
Green Monster the green is very fitting
today has been ungodly with the heat I
think I was like a 105 is what I dipped
off at ed or air conditioning in
the bus actually broke as well so I was
trying to like just hide it in any
shadowy areas
and just try to avoid it but luckily
I should say luckily or not luckily I
mean it was luckily that we got nice and
cool set 720 but unlucky Billy found out
too late and I could have actually a lot
later
right in the hole yeah that's not the
whole that's that hole
what are you doing in there what you're
doing pain what you doing what you doing
in there Caitlyn oh my god that's so
cute

good when I can like find a particular
clothing item that someone is looking
for and they can't find themselves or
they came on the right size with the
GIMP on right it whenever I can actually
accomplish that task makes me feel
really good so shirts off shirt on

some smooth okay and I are one hander
neighborhood and like back there there
was a little dog that ran up to us it
was so cute I'm not really sure what it
was but he's like Charlie come here
Charles dog named Rose strange
coincidence probably like what am I not
even a down my butt all right into their
lap one of my big things is that I am
just such a dog like any topic comes up
to me I just automatically love them I
am definitely one of those people if I
walked by someone walking the dog I
always have to ask if I can help them we
consider I just I don't know you know I
gravitate towards someone who loved dogs
so much this is very odd literally just
got offstage like five minutes ago
usually we get to see the sunset or
things like that nothing complete
darkness well guys I have a ton of work
to do tonight so I'm probably gonna call
it good night I don't know if you guys
noticed this half of my hair is curled
and the other half is still straight
because I was trying out the new curling
iron that I got and I burnt the shit out
of my hand like an idiot so I've decided
to take a little bit of a break because
oh yeah I was actually gonna try and do
some filming for my channel but I didn't
realize how late that did actually guy
so I'm not really sure I'm gonna do the
filming tonight but stay tuned new stuff

this and yeah okay bye well mister like
it's better than snapchat but I'm
actually really really pretty surprised
