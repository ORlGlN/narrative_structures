and we're done so I'm trying to pretend
I got that home as much as I can
but more organized as well as as far as
like my bunk so I'm trying to like fold
things Pearlman corners that way it
doesn't just become like a shell trying
to get over
in a sense we were
break
the type ever effect
go
Oh
yeah after that such a bad idea
so it looks like I feel like
no it does it really does but you gave
it blood sweat and tears just made me
sweat oh I got into that show st. Louis
so after doing that I immediately
realized it was probably the grossest
thing I could probably do on Warped Tour
which actually says a lot but after just
showering on the bus that build over the
better I'm gonna race over and watch the
other card for Loretta relax yeah I got
to the end of that it was like gray
water that was like debating I was like
do I want to do it but I already went so
far everyone so far guys but I haven't
done it this year I did it last time -

brought one of the luckiest people in
the world
I grew up with the Hollies bands on this
tour is on glory yellow card Taking Back

simple plan that's all but let me talk
with them I think when I think back of
all that stuff the fact that now I'm
like French to all those key people that
these key people by musical career my
childhood blows my mind
does it every time every day that's why
I like walking around

just had a crappy jump rope so much more
in possible for me

just sealing jigs for a mustard
