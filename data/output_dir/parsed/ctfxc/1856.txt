I really do not want this right now
somebody call PETA please Oh mom our
trick I learned from when I was in
college okay so when we would get beer
and would be warm and stuff like that
sometimes they actually in college
campuses or the area they would always
sell beer warm cheaper so way to make
things like instantly cold is to put
beer and some water and ice and then put
a little bit of salt in the ice and it
like instantly like makes everything
cold so watch this so salt put it in
there I think I'm doing all right it's
been a while since I've been in college
and now we wait for like a couple
minutes should work sorry oh my gosh
it's already freezing yeah so basically
what the salt does when you spread it
evenly lowers the temperature the
freezing point of the
the ice met water Charles Nye the
Science Guy everyone's got their party
hats on but we got to see Oh yours is
the only one matching oh I know you're
special too

this up everyone turn to the right again

entire shot my goal is to have the
biggest staff Zoe I will damn Charles

viewer central mustache tape you're
gonna need that by the time you get your
