well well well look what I found here I
got to say it's been long enough to
where I don't miss it yet this is all
too real so I had to grab some stuff for
the college show and I'm assuming that
was Duncan so I got to remember to bring
this to college shows okay I think I got
it
that just looks ridiculous let me get
your face closure no I'd like this to
look good
the warp tour all over again so I walked
up one ality and okay there's gonna be a
snapchat video but that's the only thing
I got by genuinely scared or by just
walking up to her feet sorry that's all
vertical like I said it was on snapchat
hey girl don't take the girl oh yeah we
got to do it right if you can memory
tower moments Oh God oh crap I know what
it is yeah so the bus is nice and
cleaned out and everything is in the car
and we're taking at home and we figured
since we're already down here since we
have the dizzy passes
I hope Danny suggested we go to Blizzard
Beach because we've actually never gone
and it's freaking hot out
it'll be fun because I've actually never
been here actually this is a ski resort
that is melted right that's my move
you always hit a butterfly
I don't worry I brought a GoPro Dan you
bring a GoPro bring a GoPro I haven't
told you this yet but I'm gonna use your
GoPro for clippers pinko all right I
think I switched the batteries to way
late did you bring the GoPro
no wait do you not have it really I left
in the carpet are taking it so we rag on
out so I can't tell us you being serious
yeah lather it up buddy let's get a nice
HD version there is this I'm sorry thing
it in we do need to go out of there put
your camera down and take some stuff by
the way
I love you but of the bunch of good
stuff everything in there nothing is the
thing about waterparks becomes a little
obnoxious so that's where we're going
I'm not really sure where we're going
what time is this blindly following
Danny right now we were gonna ride the
little forklift things ski lifts not
forklifts what they saw straight up but
they saw lightning but we're still out
on the slides which makes no sense at
all well whatever this we can go on the
slide
okay so Danny obviously won that one
nobody won nobody was in the wrath I had
to at the end well the thing is to do
any losses glasses and two pieces I
sacrifice to what the race the fixes
glasses sound both pieces on the slides
actually you won in my eyes you won
literally on your eyes Travis would
appreciate that right now that's that's
everywhere we appreciate that right and
then at the end alley was getting out
and doing spun it in the portal II fell
right here storms are coming again you
can already see it
it's the most awkward way to thicken
starter ride so we were laying down
ready to go and then they said we
couldn't go because there's lightning or
thunder in the area there's no lightning
I've not seen it but now we're making
the sad the sad walk all the way back to
the bottom of the hill you did okay so
maybe that's good that we're not doing
it but at the same time this is the
times where we wish Travis here because
you just imagined trav he would have
gone and just been like pretending like
he didn't do it on purpose and then
Danny would have gone and then I would
have gone and then everyone would have
gone then and then probably people on
the other lanes would have gone I just
started everything it won't sell
anything won't sell you anything
Oh hunkering down you gotta go
go now buddy you look at the trees right
now it's crazy unfortunately I know it
doesn't look like it now it was pouring
obviously I got to see the last clip and
they shut down the park we thought about
maybe waiting it out but the problem is
if you look closely right there it's
coming right back
so we thought either we could wait and
just keep waiting all day or maybe we
can go do something downtown Disney so
we decided to go to a bowling the
bowling ring ok a bowling alley huh I am
so funny
well I said bowling in Spanish
this is bowling
get matching socks to go Danny and I got
matching socks now I got an orange one
so it's this bowling I thought it was
really something interested but I guess
is it bowling if they know it
yeah area which ball do I wants
