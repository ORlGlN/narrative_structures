this is a weird good evening good
morning right now you just got here we
have three hours of sleep we're having
super deja vu at this hotel and I
remember I got that perfect were open
and I remember buying something and just
leaving cash right there
and this is weird
we're all having this like trying to
figure out what it was that was here
last at the same time being completely
delusional
we're getting up in like an hour and a
half and starting our day and Fulani for
our Chester
remember said flash kept a couple hours
I'm not kidding literally two hours
later walking out of this hotel
it's so glassy retired so he'll sleep I
am just finger spots right now I don't
like those luck there's no way
go Ben go Ben go Ben
oh go ahead not no hands
hey I was at least three minutes the
irony of that situation right there
Caitlin and I are bringing my antique
shopping um I know a few weeks that I
was telling you guys that she was
looking for like this I guess I did a TV
stand
and she still has yet to find one so we
figured you know what today we're gonna
go out we're gonna go look for something
I kind of walk around downtown and get a
little exercise because why not
but that gym it's really hard to try
take it forever okay forgot some
experiment
it's a nice way to start coming here yes
here that's actually the first time I
ever got to your song on the radio or
anything I ever actually had on the
radio no subs really kind of fun
alright the hotel we got a couple hours
until go load in your sound check on all
that fun stuff so I'm gonna get some
sleep because that was the worst sleep
on the plane I've ever had I did one of
those you know the heavy-metal nods like
you know when you're sleeping and you go
like this in a little bit
my worst here so many salt and pepper
shakers aunt Wendy would be in heaven
right now
good look there's so many cute little
bears and I need a beer top no no not
today so cool though hey you never know
it's smaller I'm kidding
but it's not obviously it's a china
cabinet but it's still very cool concept
barbecue shit thing got let's see
special shit good shit chicken shit
little shit oh shit it's actually really
really funny kind of strange so it's
actually in an antique shop it's still
kind of cool pretty positive that's a
lot newer but I was loved coming in here
because I feel like oh that's actually
really awesome that car didn't sign
mm-hmm
I need to have a garden to put that up
though and I'm working on it slowly but
surely there is like going to the
antique shops and house idea of summer
that I wanted to for the house but I
can't ever put it into motion because
I'm a first-time gonna turn out the way
that I want I should just try it though
yeah it's cool got like paints and
everything
small piece of information that we've
got about today is that there is a home
appraised game and there are race fans
everywhere right now one that we're not
at the game today but we're definitely
gonna have to go to one this season huh
so that's a saint-petersburg peer
blowing everybody up well I'll be
completely honest still feel tired and
exhausted but fill out better
