what'd you get Margot watching her try
to eat cantaloupe is the funniest thing
I've ever seen
she had never eaten before I guess and I
gave it to her and she was like yeah
give it a little piece of honeydew she's
having some difficulties
it's like watching it's like an Olympic
sport Marlee eating fruit we're going to
go find cookies we were we had a little
tip that there at Walmart so we're gonna
go get it and then we're gonna go see
some monster trucks and truck a source
there's a like a monster jam thing or
whatever like well the monster trucks
women went last year
but there's one here and we're totally
gonna go Blue Ribbon and cheer when
Winnebagos get crushed it's gonna be
awesome
so yeah I'm sick again you know I think
it is this one of those things where
like you take medicine and then just
when you start feeling better you stop
taking the medicine you look all better
and then you get sick again I guess what
keeps happening so I'm hoping the Girl
Scout cookies all cure of all illness
I'm hoping here's the interesting thing
about this thing you guys remember we
saw Weezer and the basketball game it's
the exact same arena so I'm not really
sure how they're gonna put a giant
monster truck show inside here it's
gonna become interesting my hair
truckasaurus is gonna be here he's gonna
be eating trucks it's gonna be awesome
Monster Jam so we were able to get lower
level tickets like a lower level things
so maybe we can see some wheels
exploding I don't know I feel like a
like an 8 year old right now I'm just
gonna be like this things explode where
are these cookies they said they're
geared towards our us
the little cookie brownie people lied
damn it
another day another failed cookie
mission that's okay we're gonna go see
monster trucks but I really I that's
what I've been saying some people have
been like at replying us saying it
doesn't come out to March
some people are teasing me and taking
photos of people are there they are
there sitting over there so we're gonna
hang out at the park a little bit kill
some time go see some monster trucks
closer than we were last year

me but what that was pretty cool it
wasn't it wasn't as cool as the one that
we saw and we were saw in Tampa with
Melissa because it was it was at Raymond
James T Raymond James Stadium and James
Stadium I never know where the Super
Bowl was anyway where the Bucs play and
that was big I actually it's on our

Fenn

like Chuck Norris in the eighties or
MacGyver mullet and beards equal power

better way to end the night then with
some Chinese food and a crappy movie
