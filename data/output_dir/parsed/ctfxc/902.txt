my sister my mom and I have not had the
opportunity to actually hang out
together in a while I'm actually really
really looking forward to this
Holly ran out such a hurry that she left
her coffee I know that's hot chocolate
what's my chocolate I smell it you're
not gonna drink it
nope you're that for you with my mom and
Caitlyn and this is one of our
appetizers which is like unbelievably
amazingly yummy looking and then we've
got our Bloody Marys
so Ali killing when did girly things
I think it's really a hospitality
as you can see the hurricane is coming
it's supposed to be here Monday
up
you really going at you
this is trust right here
that's what you call trust
probably they give butter knives you
poop your pants I'm Kayla said you
cooked your bed sore from working out
don't judge me
big ass'll it's okay that's actually
good turnout
I actually know adult friends that's
beautiful yeah just because they're lazy
okay friends and if you're watching no
you are cool buy pants diarrhea every oh
hey guys we just had a delicious me and
it could be into your socks and then you
ruin two time cam you really got into
the thing that really didn't happen slow
down my legs hurt so bad now you guys
got to remember Caitlin's the younger
sister and she used to beat up Allie
well you were the you were like doubtful
right
jumped on my back once I'm a bit like
that
it's me and my kidneys imam nila here
I need to see your mom Yellen that too
I just had one of the most strangest
interactions I Lynette were coming into
the store I'm just standing that waiting
for Allie come out and these two little
British kids but I would say they were
probably seven seven and nine and it was
like kept staring at me there staring at
me like this and they know I'm standing
back at him I'm gonna kind of like doing
this like they're back down and they're
like it's like a mini Charlie does that
mean it's like creepy
I was a good boyfriend and I watched a
scary movie the other day and you're
making it happen again
although that was a pretty cool movie
the only reason why I didn't like it was
because I went to the catacombs a long
time ago and I will like to gone back
but now that's scared the out of me
back in 2013 when I was actually in the
catacombs by myself the same place this
movie was so here's a nice little
flashback these are all bones these are
all frickin bones that is so crazy
these are all like the legs there's a
skull more skulls more okay so I
seriously need to figure out why there's
something bones everywhere the okay
bumbling Joe became his bumbling
fumbling Joe come on bumbling Joe we got
the camera replaced
thank God for warranties they don't make
cameras Charles proof I was like saying
to Charlie I'm like viewers have got to
be going crazy because you probably
think we're just playing Nick the same
clip a weird over the same time bringing
in different vlogs but no guys this is
real we go to Best Buy at least twice a
week it's on the haps
it's where the haps go yeah perhaps and
then the cool place what's happening not
if you have to ask you're not happening
they replaced the camera and now they
got a bunch of scary movies so good to
like sit at home and rainy days and
and I don't want you guys thinking that
I'm purposely breaking these cameras and
then I'm a complete irresponsible idiot
honestly these things aren't designed I
don't believe to be filmed with every
single day and I feel like we're small
niche of people like daily vloggers that
use these cameras that were probably
meant for just photos on vacation
we're really putting these things to the
test and sometimes they just fall apart
after you shoot them with a paintball
gun she can't figure out this door
finally we specifically made the door
open towards us so that way you can't do
what you're doing because she can open
up every other door in this entire house
this is dramatization right now let's
say Ally's into you're pooping so Ally's
in there nope
she's inside doesn't wait didn't waste
literally a second
the worst thing I ever taught her if
there's ever any trouble we have a
little fire dog he's scared
now it's a weird movie we're watching
movie called the babadook it's freaky
it's very they do that your impression
of the babadook he's full of don't
believe open up Bob De Pere party the
bobbitt is here with a large piece of
ether I'm just trying to get a lead to
do her impression it's not like
grandma's shitty the babadook so he's
been hanging out with me right now
he said I don't know if she's scared or
trying to give me a warning he's just
because he's scared of all the thunder
earlier Ali was showing me her little
skills her steady hand skills doing what
is that night roulette yes and I wanted
to see if I can get her to do it again
guys this is a butter knife guys
basically butter an extra meant to cut
butter and bread in bread but they don't
like well I guess they do they're just
not sharp
what are you doing down there I think
was the babadook he had scare from the
Bubba dude
it might be might be hope you enjoyed
today's video
beware of the babadook you lives in your
closet and we will see you guys tomorrow
as always have a great night doodles
bye guys that joke was a knee-slapper
ain't no bones about it
you're gonna leave everybody stuff now
so our life has come down to this it's
one of the life's biggest decisions
which said to get for the Gulf cards
done done so many decisions honestly
we've been driving around everywhere
trying to figure out what shed to get to
the golf cart and I feel like this is
honestly like buying a house
Charles amigo it's like buying a mini
house doesn't make any sense so make
sure the velcro this is secure we don't
know what to do
there's more as I I mean if you want to
go for more that country feel I say go
for this
