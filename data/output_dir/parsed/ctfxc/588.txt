like woke up to feed them around like
7:00 7:30 and which is a little bit
earlier than what I normally feed them
and she or her son was just cycling
crazy which is kind of a it's not like a
normal thing but it does happen from
time to time but typically we can
usually get her to eat within that like
hour time frame and I haven't been able
to get her to eat yet and dude any 2:30
in the afternoon so I'm gonna go take
her for a walk cause one of my mention
is who seems to get pretty excited and
maybe that'll get her I don't know maybe
I'll make her hungry I'm not really sure
Zoey unfortunately even though she's not
feeling good she became part of Diesel's
demise and Diezel peed right on her head
I tried to prevent it but it obviously
did not work and I feel so bad it's a
little funny but I feel terrible

a plus

random CPAC
that anyway before I completely forget
and I wanted to talk to you guys really
quick because we always have our little
book club we've had this going on for I
want to say two two-and-a-half years now
audible.com is a sponsor of a book club
that we have
it's basically an audio book club
obviously because audible sells
you know audiobooks it's been one of my
favorite sponsors to do because I love
books and I love reading but the problem
is I don't have a lot of time to read
because I'm always going around you know
editing you know traveling the thing
about audible is that I love is that
it's audiobooks so you can just put them
on your iPhone your iPad your Android
and you can just drive put on the radio
and just run or if you're exercising
which I do now a lot because I don't
actually drive anymore
go to audible.com/veritasium all calm
and the one I'm gonna actually going to
suggest this time is actually one that a
lot of you guys actually suggested to
view and I just was talking to Danny and
he actually suggested as well it's
called in 50 years we'll all be chicks
by Adam Corolla
I put an application in at the Taco Bell
in North Hollywood and was rejected do
you know you have the good to be
rejected by a Taco Bell manager I
understand this concept just funny I
don't know it's fine I'll call it just
be a funny guy or if you don't want to
listen to this one you can listen to any
book that you actually want to listen to
on there so let me know guys if you
think of any other books that we can
listen to or
you know check out let me know in the
comments and we'll check it out for the
next book club

dilemma Weston Berg's are very
indecisive yeah we're just gonna walk up

extremely indecisive but we found a
place to eat and one of the most
embarrassing things for me to do is to
