almost been a month right I can't
remember when we actually started it's
seriously been the most frustrating
frustrating month in a long time at any
rate we're still going strong is this
stopped aerial hunting you know that's
actually one thing this is a really
funny cuz we were just talking about
this and what where was that I was
talking with somebody about this see the
thing is my personal thing is I don't
like hunting I just I don't that's my
personal opinion but I know a lot of
friends that do it and I know probably a
lot of you guys do it and there's
nothing wrong with that I'm not gonna
judge you but the people that fly around
in helicopters and shoot from the air
they're just a bunch of pussies I'm
sorry but if you do that you're a pussy
calling you out I mean you don't want to
kill cats and G's wolf about that but
that's just one thing that I kind of
find I have my seatbelt on
I don't know that's just one one thing
that I've always been peeved about about

a while
peeved let's bring it back peeved what
does it even mean you guys are never

we're going to islands of adventure and
then Halloween Horror Nights on Saturday
now here's the kicker Universal Studios
how um what is the park invited us to
come out there and they're giving a
special permission to record all the
haunted houses so I wanted to ask you
guys this like last time we didn't get
to go to all the haunted houses there
was Busch Gardens and didn't really get
to do much this time I get to record
everything so should we do a interactive
haunted house vlog for Saturday or do
you want in just a giant 30 40 minute
video I'm just worried that that's too
much for some people and you know some
people might want to watch certain
things so should we do an interactive
haunted house vlog let me know in the
comments I'm gonna go to bed now because
I have to wake up early and get a
haircut because you guys been making fun
