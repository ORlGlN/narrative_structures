don't know if you guys remember we went
to Mardi Gras a long time ago I want to
say four or five years ago if you didn't
this happened

uber prices to stop surging ridiculously

with the pups so we're all just kind of
like ally and more so just hanging out
over there Callie's over there and I'm
just like literally it's so funny I was
standing over there and it was $160 I'm
not kidding and I literally walked 20
feet away from everyone and it was I
think it's like now $70 just in that 20
feet I don't understand why that would
actually help 20 feet so we let Frankie
in the house

whole time while I was on the couch just
barking out of the whole time just
talking like a little Google thing then
