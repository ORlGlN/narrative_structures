is this good lighting this is probably
the best vlogging lighting I've ever had
at night is that good oh that's awesome
amazing does you're like a film crew
yeah
real time don't be scurred very nothing
the word
this is gonna get bad we need to hang up
blinking lights on our heads to make
sure to find everybody there's stage you

Brett do not go under there do not go
under there Brett do not look that is a
thumbnail there's no cops involved it's
a but now this imaginative Marilyn
Monroe became like the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man
just like what in Chicago robbery at our
inappropriate part is so inappropriate
on guard I seriously believe it's not
just me Romancing it works as a metaphor
for the alienation of the middle-class
post-national America did you say
Marilyn Manson in the vlog right there
I'm gonna look so dumb that doesn't no
difference between men and women that is
the secret phrase for today in the
comments Brett doesn't know the
difference between men and women in the
comments don't do it what if you do it's
to Jesus but but it's pretty hard though
Marilyn Manson he I don't understand man
and women in history
worse yet
giddy with child trippy
in early
