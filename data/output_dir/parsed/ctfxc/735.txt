Oh
Wow let's go to Disney World are your
mess it's cuz the way
once again all children seated in the
middle
we have finally made it we are finally
in Disney first things first
Ali wants to get too many ears
while you're making is no mini well many
years you're making is that they we
gotta get out of some Mickey ears
I don't remember the last time I was
here these are the old school ones but
see the thing is do they have the strap
because that's gonna fall right off your
head it's a little tight this one
doesn't even make sense kind of this is
gonna be the only time you'll ever see
Ali in a bow that was cute
go look at it that was cute and you're
probably gonna lose it off your head
a giant noggin I don't know I don't like
the thing at the top I know what it is
but let's see that one okay that'll be
all right so this one that's the Beast
characteristic Valley but actually fits
you the best
you like sparkles what
and one actually fits your personality
the most Ali is now equipped properly so
we can go do something go do some 15
minutes
well Minnie where do you want to go I
literally I don't know if something
happened I got a bow and sparkles
welcome whatever does he be the only
time you'll ever see Ali and sparkles
and a bow probably okay time for the
annoying photo three two one scene the
castle there's a seagull I want what do
you want to do the Haunted Mansion first
want to do Haunted Mansion I think
that's that way we didn't get a map well
maybe it's that way
oh it was that way I'm just actually
found I was talking my buddy Sean you
know the violinist from yellow card he's
here randomly with his family too so
we're gonna see if we can try to find
him hopefully
why does Donald not wear pants but
insists on wearing a t-shirt
we need Danny or Ben here the experts
are busy cleaning up
that's good this way let's go behind the
castle
okay we need to acquire a mat
immediately
let's go have them
you're welcome okay let's figure this
out
there's a castle so I think we went this
way so where we want to go on a mansion
really great in this area it looks like
a dead end
wonderful that's where rat not okay
Haunted Mansion and now the wait for
Ali's favorite ride

the flexing so I'm looking up some fun
facts about this ride apparently in the
1970s a man entered the ride and shot at
one of the ghosts so Disney had
actually the spiderweb where the ball is
apparently it's like known for people to
actually spread yeah a match is the
number one place they go even creepier
Seattle remember this is this new yeah

to find that spiderweb now
this is hands-down my favorite part of
this entire ride
