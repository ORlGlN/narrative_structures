probably eaten by a Gardens maker bit by
heard snake going on a bear hunt Brett I
got the rest of it still following the
movie with Doc to have Jesse and Aly
scene right now I wanted to come out
here because I guess we're in the middle
of nowhere
because there's like three or four
Blackhawk helicopters just like freaking
circling it the second I come out here

second I get a camera cool things are
never caught on camera oh wait all right

helicopters little weird what a tangled
web we weave

Marley I think you have to go on a diet

blowing and then you'll keep your fire
and possibly set your hair on fire
I like careful alright a second here and
let's just go down that there it is it's
a little tail slot we're gonna shoot the
party scene today and this is the
crucial we have to get beer but here's
the thing it has to be what you would
expect like a bunch of what all 24 we're
in Florida we have thirty twos

that extra 8 ounces this is bad in
Florida yes say I feel like natty ice is
a lot more like rednecky or whatever you
want to say oh we need bottles we need
the ups there we go

scene is oh oh no oh no oh no did he

Yuki's just like deer in the headlights

okay so whether that's so mean uh Claire
so I was just reading a bunch of the
comments from today's vlog with the car
falling and stuff like that
and I'm kind of I'm a little
disappointed that you guys get so
annoyed
there's there's a law like a law in
comedy it's called the rules rule of
threes that's why I did so many of our I
thought it was funny but I guess I don't
know some people didn't like the flying
cars and my favorite ones are like oh
this is so high I don't know I just
wanted to say I'm sorry if you guys got
annoyed by falling cars I thought it was
funny I still think it's funny
you might see someone oh my god guys
watch out now I'm just kidding with this
there's no mark these get one helicopter
that's about it
at any rate all the other ones high-five
I'm just gonna high-five everyone else
that thought it was funny because that's
the thing about the vlogs I make videos
that make myself we should probably do
that like I was saying the thing about
the vlogs I know some people don't find
some humor funny but you know the thing
is I want to look back I know when I'm
in was like fifty years from now I'm
gonna laugh I'm just gonna laugh my ass
off when I see it so that's why I do it
guys I still love you guys let's all go
to the movies let's all go to the movies
finds our snacks whatever it's called oh
that's what it is let's all go to the
lobby going to get some sake and some
she and put it in my belly holy crap
they gave us the sofa this is this is
even better than nah the other chairs
wait oh that's right because yeah
customs
basically it's never end
I could wait too much on yours
I mean don't do it need a bigger chunk
from that so hot oh my god we did
it's like a very weird burning it's like
it's a very deep burn
in my nostrils and now I'm crying
gentlemen Charles Trippy in tears all
right time to hit the base now Allie
Christine and Cori went out for just a
little bit I had to come home because I
need to practice because the hometown
show is tomorrow actually if you're
watching this hometown show is today so
get a ticket and come down to the show
and I want to make sure I got you know
all the songs down I think we're adding
a couple of new songs maybe what you do
to me over you and what's the other one
whoa I think what maybe those are the
three songs so you want to run through
them a couple times so I just like that
power would go right nowwhat para para
para hey way what this is what's living
under your bed guys
Zoe when you walk it sounds like I'm
throwing out like a bag of tax across
across the floor dude say good night to
the Internet are you ready
I don't know what I'm doing better we're
gonna play pool now
wait you're supposed to get this one in
right we're playing cutter and I
literally lost already my balls are gone
I have no more balls
I know Cory's like so this place like
this game in which I win every time also
we just found out that you shoot
left-handed even though you're
right-handed there's such a freaking bit
from what you are which is right-handed
and she was like no that's how I learned
how to shoot and I'm thinking whoever
played pool with her the first time
taught her how to shoot backwards to the
new be harder for her to be slide and
told you
since that was a total and complete
failure I'm gonna have Corey do it what
have you joined what have you tried oh
you broke it corn don't help her apart I
mean are they not believe me
do your best believe me face
I don't know if you actually knows this
but December 29th 2011 there was some
sort of like AT&T apocalypse with
iPhones like no one can actually like if
you can look at it right there there's
nothing there's no signal at all oh of
course
two bars show up now but for like three
hours
I could not get any signal but I just
wanted to show you guys the conversation
that Ali and I had and I feel you guys
can appreciate it so this is where I
want to leave you guys on I will see you
