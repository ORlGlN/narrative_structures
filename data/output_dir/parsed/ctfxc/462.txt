I'm feeling it's going to be a very very
long night That Bird is as big as Marley
I love you break the rules trying to get
everything in there got you everything
in that shot I don't think I've ever
actually been up the Space Needle I
always think I have but it's always
either toronto CN tower or the one the
stratosphere in vegas but I don't think
that actually gone up this one I think
we do we go up the last time we're here
anyway
I remember we walked down that way up it
cuz there's the EMP museum we went to
and that was pretty cool
I was gonna hit sickness she's gotta
stay away from me so we decided to do it
anyway even if we get here I can't
remember it
I'd rather turn on the frickin radio on
here that's nothing
well let's quick that's something that
turns it up there all the turns are in
store how did that work
so there's 61 a case of dual swords like
400 days sell it to a year a little bit
over a year it's got a fine so we went
to get in line Big Sam and Chad they're
basically fall they're stalking us right
now we all get the same same ideas
definitely do
that's the EMP museum right there the
EMP PBM because then we actually flying
flying we're 605 me top 108 4 meters
that's about fifty two stories you're
looking out to the West years original
like this couple years ago they just had
this they didn't have this whole
situation then they had to add that
situation probably for obvious reasons
but it'd be so gnarly it was still just
this my god Toronto we went on the CN
Tower and with a Chad and he was
freaking out and then James going the
same I think I having a camera I might
have that on camera somewhere we a do
their vertical snaps what you're
breaking the rules
I love you break the rules horizontal
snaps are so annoying
here I want to put you guys on the other
side of the game
I'm
good I'm thinking about like doing it
but leaving it on my arm and just on
dangling it and the scare but I have a
feeling if I did that it would probably
just fall off and probably fall on
somebody's dad which would that be fun
at all would be terrible freezing your
nips off find somebody on the street I
see you there stop play with those nuts
I'll hold you forever ken I like how
they give you a different light yeah I
prefer the moonlit night the moon's nice
look so happier than that too how do we
select the one you want terribly cropped
record or solo
all right where was the food like that
way
lookit they're all cali jackets are you
that bird is as big as Marley this is
the first time I've ever spent bathroom
to where you're allowed to actually do
graffiti kind of crazy the same time
we're gonna continue our cheesy joke
across the country thing
thank you man hey thank you buddy
make sure to thank you do you think that
supposed to be Luis babe mm-hmm the last
time you slipped

until we got the pike place because now
we got to go on a red-eye after this and
then we get to go home but this is like
a tradition gotta go York

20 minutes ago so I got some rubber
soles that's what you need from rubber
we had to go to the birthplace for ally
the original Starbucks which is so funny
because people wait in line like crazy
like they did the same Starbucks but
they could get well this is what I was
talking about the other day I don't pay
attention to those things I think this
Starbucks indicates the same as the
Starbucks across the street so I don't
know why people way too much line
why do you just know what where you have
to go they're doing like a sweat and
agenda and the junket
big old agendas
