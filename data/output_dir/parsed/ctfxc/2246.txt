changes the documentation of any of the
accounts without the cosigner aka my
husband Charles I literally was in there

vacuuming and I might sound kind of
weird maybe I'm not alone but vacuuming
and sweeping and like dusting or like
all in the same categories for me where
I just feel like I like it so much
because it's like one of those few
things wouldn't you actually do
something you can actually see immediate
like progress or results I guess I'm
sweeping this up I can see all this
stuff I'm sweeping and being like oh
that's no longer the floor and I'm not
stepping on it relaxing things Ali went
over to hang out with Melissa and a
couple other people I was just kind of
kind of tired just wanted to kind of
relax I watched Star Wars because this
that's what uh that's what I do when I'm
tired it is washed out worse it's kind
of like one of those things where what
is it like the only other job in the
world where you start at the top and you
work your way down to the bottom is the
job of when you're digging a hole think
about it think about it I don't really
know what to think about it's just gonna
kind of interesting it's like when you
drive on a Parkway and park in a
driveway what am I talking about this is
