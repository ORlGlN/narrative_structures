thank you do you - come on downstairs I
remember the song by the way we lost
Marlee she's up there with Ali now she
just ran up and just opened the door
okay so we'll hang out what she's doing
this if you guys didn't see Ali's
awesome Instagram photos she did this
like crazy dear goth looking like
Maleficent type of like creature thing
for Halloween like last minute totally
last minute to grab some steaks just
grab a weird crown when she made this
awesome costume so she's filming right
now it'll go on her channel I'll remind
you at the end of the day's video and
you can go check it out she's like the
queen of last-minute like Halloween
costumes like she can just make
something out of nothing
yep
whoops whoops now why would that planet
great in the middle of the sidewalk that
was 100% by accident I don't care who
you're voting for but I just cannot wait
until this election is over just because
I'm so sick and tired of everyone hating
on everyone it's just like a giant civil
war way down it's it's sickening and
it's it's honestly just getting to a
point where I just I just don't care
anymore
I never really get political on this
channel because I honestly don't care
who you're voting for
everyone's got their own political
beliefs or own beliefs I respect that's
pretty much my stance on the election do
your own research figure out what works
for you and vote only based on yourself
and your family don't listen to anyone
else don't listen to me don't listen to
the dudes don't listen to anyone else
that's kind of like why I've never
really talked about you know any
politics or anything like that never had
a stance on the vlogs because I don't
want you guys believing anything I want
to believe I want you guys to believe
what you want to believe what works for
you
we might disagree and that's life you
know but I just want you guys to do what
works for you and what you personally
believe that will your parents now with
the news that what CNN not what Fox News
not what the Wall Street Journal not
what snapchat says that one has to know
any of that stuff what works for you
just for the love of God whatever you do
just vote that's the key message I want
to actually say just vote don't be lazy
don't be like oh my vote doesn't count
it counts somewhere my generation as
well that all our vote doesn't count it
does and as I got older and older and as
they got older and older there's the
word I was looking for
I realized that more and more so if
you're watching these videos that's the
only thing I can give you as far as
advice for elections and voting just do
it boy as Nike is that
whatever and for the love of God let's
try not to have too big of a show in the
comments now I said I said that al
Skelton fell and there's a rock right
next to it so you know there's only one
thing I can do do this right
