Rachel believe runner
get it that most definitely was our
Scalise just killing time because I 150

Cage's house again and you save a person
what oh that's cool
that's the anchor right looks like a
fake anchor I have those are to make the
boat go faster their speeds the speed
fins the whale jumps the automatically
and we're okay we're able to leave the
land and looks like we were the only
people that are really going so if
there's a shark so powerful
never saying that boat is worth about
three or four million dollars
give some frappuccinos guys what do we
want to avoid yeah bloody diarrhea oh
yeah so he advised me not to get a
Frappuccino because it uses the water
I'm already scared I've got that's the
part that kind of sucks getting off the
boat is that the people just start
throwing things and look you can see
straight into the water
that's how clean this is there's no
ports in the state center this clean
here's the here's the thing we're
leaving now at 2:30 our boat leaves at
