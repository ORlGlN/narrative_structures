what may have happened to this we don't
have Wolverines in the house Maura from
Santa Barbara California you are the
lucky one and we're Marley got into
yours
where'd you get this from there's no
and there's no wonder really yeah I
don't know what happened it was there
was plastic packages from the post
office like something got opened
strawberry extra sour straws which I'm
going to eat so whoever made this is
their name on it right now there's still
no name you guys when you send stuff you
gotta put your name on there so we know
so Ali didn't dig deep enough I found a
part of package this is from Megan W
from I'm assuming I don't know what that
is for Wells pod no idea so you want to
see what Marlowe is digging at this
whole time in this box looks like a
giant carved handmade snail Oh looks
like the mail screwed it up I'm gonna
blame Marley that is adorable
look how cute Megan also apparently sent
my mom a One Direction poster drew H
unfortunately his mother has cancer as
well so they made some of these cool
little like bracelets

get in trouble like it's my cancer
shirt so cut fancy huh that's a really
clever idea
and you don't say the C word whoopsie

packed so when I pulled it out
everywhere you probably cleverly pack
this so it was all neat in there and you
opened it the wrong way
