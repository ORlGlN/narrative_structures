man it's freaking hot outside so this is
how I'm gonna try to start the day at
least until we leave um we leave to 28th
no seriously instead of doing that night
I feel like doing in the day that way
I'm actually getting a you know well you
know my metabolism and stuff like that
so here we go
checking a hundred green weather kinda
sucks so this is gonna be my new goal
right here I'm gonna plan on running
every morning when I wake up whether I
wake up at two noon ten doesn't matter
I'm gonna force myself to get up and
start running instead of doing it at the
end of the day I read that it's better
gonna do it in the morning before you
start your day because then your
metabolism is going stronger throughout
the day and you digest your you
basically can pone your food quicker oh
maybe I was in California I think it's
so freakin hot
look at my skin look at it I love you
