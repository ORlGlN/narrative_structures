that I go get my quote on my bumper
since that girl hit my car and I got a
drop alley off of class and gets all
good of a student she is she's doing her
homework now what class is that they're
doing Italian right now oh five minutes

Metheny know any language Alec just pick
up she's like the sponge of languages

can't I can't would you two say a scusi
I'm Italian and I can't speak Italian
excuse me
okay but no seriously as far as the
tannins are concerned I am the Olive
Garden Italian I'm actually from Sicily
but I can't speak a word of Italian
except the scusi now my family's I think
I am actually German Sicilian and I
think my mom's got Native American in it
but I'm not sure also as you can see the
beard is still alive

awesome guy last night for the must-see
