oh so it's you stay stay yeah oh my god
look no I'm red I feel like um like
what's in uh Charlie in the Chocolate
Factory
we're sure it's blue but I don't know it
needs good that way
good morning Internet so before I leave
on an airplane I wanted to take the dogs
for a little kind of walk or in his case
a roll and then I got to go home take a
shower and pack a little bit more but
since I'm completely packed and
everything is already on the tour bus
this is gonna be the easiest plane ride
I've ever had
yes ready so my mom was gonna come up
and watch the dogs until Alec gets home
which is a couple days and that way you
know they're not by themselves not like
we would ever leave our dogs bare so but
you don't just think oh by all means
hello means just chill no big deal I got
you you can use that three legs as long
as you want as like an excuse brain
surgery is an excuse
well we've made it to Tennessee and
so far it's beautiful I mean all I can
see right now is interstate and some
trades but you know what I'm pretty I'm
pretty excited about it and there's
hills there's the mountain up there or
what you call that a hill what would you
call that everything that's true would
you look at sort of anything that
actually has any type of height to it is
definitely a mountain that's a hill so
wait that's a mountain in that pill or
that's a hill no I like leading up to it
and they got it the actual figures just
keep tuning in to this channel okay keep
tuning in well here we go again back to
the airport we'll meet up with the guys
in Dallas I think is what's going on
it's amazing I've hurt my tailbone the
other day and it's so bad to sit down
you're saying I don't know how I did it
but I think I may have fallen backwards
or something like that it I fell right
on my body and I completely screwed up
my tailbone
it sounds like perfect time to get on
the airplane look at this like for
example if you become sitting like
sitting like oh we like that I'm sitting
because freaking hurts to do anything
else so I think today is what they call
rehearse all day or setup day for walk
door so we're gonna get there and we're
gonna be seeing all the stage hands and
crew and all those people bringing in
all the stages and trying to set it up a
day early because tomorrow morning is
will tour it's begun I'm excited and I'm
a little scared
I never get to see this I usually take
the plane train as though they call it
pretty
this was not as cool as the jungle but
see I didn't even know this stuff exists
now I'm at this freakin Airport like it
feels like it's like my second home I
didn't know this was here they're gonna
walk more often so that super plane
train missed so much

fallen asleep a few times but somehow
this little lady over here has driven
