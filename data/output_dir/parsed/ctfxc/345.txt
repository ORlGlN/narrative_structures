morning morning it's 7:00 in the morning
what are you doing it's 1:30 a.m. we're
in San Francisco oh go get your San
Francisco tree every day because Ali's
coming today somebody pick up all that
spare money
go honey
San Francisco welcome
it's your first ever sample still go
there
so we're gonna try to go see pier 39 the
sea lions all the things that we've done
in the past she's never seen but there's
Lombard Street I think is how you say it
the one with the winding road I've never
ever ever seen in all the years here and
Coley what was the street that I should
go check out internationally Haight and
Ashbury I've never been there either so
hopefully you can get all that stuff
crammed in before the show it's quite a
lot
so $25
should be insulted the door was opening
up as Trek traveled and here trying to
play some Koopa Kids that keeps hanging
up on track
obviously the first thing I want to show
Howie are the sea lion / Alcatraz
unfortunately it was sold out we
couldn't go down
like like we did last time it was why
one of my highlights of ever coming to
San Francisco anyway so I want to go
show her the sea lions and this is
actually the place I think I told you
guys last time the first one of the
first gatherings ever went to was here
so I have this place pier 39 kind of has
a very special
yeah place in my heart there we go I
don't know I just want to show our
Alcatraz the most this obviously is my
favorite places ever up pigeon
actually I don't remember like if that's
actually I'm camera I have this photo of
Ali's the sequence of photos of Ali
trying to feed the pigeons and just
being bombarded by engines is probably
my favorite sequence of photos so I'm
just going to show you right now this is
a bunch of pigeons attacking Ali it was
probably the funniest thing in the world
but that was it's the mini doughnuts
over there
one of my favorite places on this thing
because it always reminds me of you know
like Ned Flanders left aureum and the
Simpsons I always see that my crack-up
I love the fact that there's an actual
place that come on baby you don't wanna
go an escalator
looks like the best pizza in our heart
you come all the way to San Francisco so
I've been some fish you get pizza
dudu Anika she's amazing wife and she
knows I don't like seafood
but tonight least compromising with me
even will get super oh she just loves
the ranch she could double up on the
ranch below to the seafood restaurant
and I will see the food but I will not
eat your dad just laying there on point
right now they're pretty daddy did you
like my duck duck do this one are you
even see it there bunch of ducks
yesterday a duck duck and a goose can I
get
that means better wedding we had mini
churros but because of the chaos Ali
didn't get a true he'd like anything at
the wedding
so she bought herself a churro right now
to make up for it I think Frankie and
Sophie had the most churros these kept
going back before I think Frankie had
like three dogs ooh
there's out that can't miss it right
yeah yep as creepy as it is one of my
favorite landmarks to visit a big giant
seagull attack Ali you're right
some things I just wish the camera was
on but that that won't look forever be
in my heart
my heart sorry I'll have one heart
look seagull to the seal okay this is
where they're at but that's my point
that giant thing is probably that one
that's yeah that was actually the size
of the bird I can't believe it hit me I
can't believe you threw away the churro
it came down and goes and bit at the
trill yeah there are even actually
really relate to each other the reason
why I like these guys
reason why I come here all the time when
I'm traveling it totally reminds me of
Zooey Marley and like how she just like
runs over Zooey and diesel all the time
I think that's the funniest part about
these things it becomes you see that
big-ass one right there that becomes her
okay they might push him off no he's on
his own one he's smart he might jump on
the other side cuz this one Zoe right
there just sunbathing yeah it's the King
I think I was the King one right there
there's a sea lions and that's Alcatraz
over there what house you want to see I
don't know maybe yeah see I'm not
stealing my churro I feel like we got to
go away from here
actually I'm not even that I really wish
that camera I thought so too
watch out there there's a bunch of them
you'll be okay we should get more
churros and see if they'll do it again
what literally this will be a story you
guys are gonna probably hear for a long
time
but uh I am the best part about this is
that we didn't get on camera however
there is a God kind of glass that saw
the entire situation and just kept
laughing so you know gotta look at the
positive I'm not kidding you I really
but then I felt the snack and we churro
and realized oh wait it's seagull and
it's still rude it's a rude SC deep
alley looking seagull maybe yeah maybe
fifteen barley sighs but at the same
rate definitely at the same rate it was
very very funny with the five dollars
because now we had like a little cool
memory it's like me it's Charles choice
and now just bring Ally churros I think
that's all she's trying to say you look
like Michael Jackson Thriller right now
see if you can lean how far you can lean
forward I've never seen Lombard Street
you know the one with the zigzag kind of
Street craziest it doesn't make sense
the street doesn't make sense
I only remember it you ready for it it
doesn't make sense and the only thing I
ever remember is from Tony Hawk pro
skater skater I love it's one or two but
where you can like basically all eat the
whole thing
this is actually one thing I've never
seen while in San Francisco I can see
why now get this we get closer you can
see this damn Hill here's the funny
embarrassing moment though
Ally and I were walking
and like they were right in the middle
it's a 50/50 shot do we go this way you
get that or do go this way is this is
half of the hill then my brain kicked in
and I realized we're going up a hill and
it couldn't possibly be be uphill the
other way because that would make
physical sense following me
you could thriller it now
that's pretty close I am starting to
realize why I don't do this we didn't do
this thing don't look down
oh boy the outage has really nice
snapchat Abed snapchat that I did there
it is
can't really see much from up here
should have definitely should have
definitely gone to the bottom one for
multiple reasons do what they should
have had like a sign up there like
welcome to Lombard Street you made a
mistake you should go to the bottom and
take a photo yeah cuz I remember in Tony
Hawk you basically go right here you can
all you down the whole thing cuz you
know that's totally real
rodney mullen who I was all the time
let's do an earlier question today or
just another one when you guys played
Tony Hawk pro skater or if you did who
were you every single time I was rodney
mullen waverace 64
oh no diddy kong racing I'd like for
today to be bright a bike you've been
around a motorcycle good ride a jet ski
or do I think skateboarding and it was
all one thing was it called skate nope I
don't remember bucked up the whole thing
just to go down get that photo
can't believe it's an active road hi
that's way more interesting from the
bottom so strange if I can't look away
I'm so mesmerized so I was always
wondering why this exists but then when
you look down here you can see exactly
why this exists
kind of like slows you down a little bit
so now it makes a lot more sense to me
it looks kind of annoying though to go
down and kind of fun I was telling Ally
I would be really fun to get an uber up
there just to go down I've only seen one
/ / elliptical so I don't know if they
end up doing it you big strong man all
these muscles you don't need all these
muscles I want that so let me go home
okay bye one of those things that thing
is the coolest little I think that take
a smart car know that makes it more like
a go-kart it looks like are you doing
the stanky leg right now yeah my body
soon is just my muscles it's intense
around us is this because we're going up
and down this thing so much okay it's
better get back on the bus traps
cleaning I don't know what Coley's doing
