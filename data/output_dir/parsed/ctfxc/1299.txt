to get the bearings every single day and
this is the day on the Invisible Man
remember when Coley was running I pushed
him on his face that one also a day when
I fell on my face on the skateboard but
I'm not gonna do that today I am going
to clean this again though start to heal
trust me guys it hurts way more than it
looks
never supposed to say the opposite
Oh table the hair I think that hurt more
than frickin falling all right now time
to water and to walk toward when I was
cleaning my wounds I just saw Shawn you
know the violinist from yellow card and
he gave me a big hug and asked me how I
was doing with the chemo I know with
Stan remember the nicest person on
Warped Tour hands down one of the nicest
person I were a little more warming up
