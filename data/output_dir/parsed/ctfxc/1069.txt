unfortunately by the time I had to get
back on the plane my mom got there so I
had to reject luckily and I thought you
know I could go last-minute just walk
right through but some reason another
it's a pre-check was actually longer the
actual sky priority well you have six
minutes before one o'clock that's when
the gates close button so I had to rush
through security just saying fuck
pickups are killing him so I have five
minutes I ran through turnarounds that I
was on romantic comedy everyone laughed
and then when I actually got through
security the security agent remember
Ruby gives me on tour a couple days ago
so ran through security there was that
book it was like Eduardo and Harlow and
what it was like hey couple days ago
it was their first day it was like a
teaching simulator so basically it was
taking a little bit more time than
normal so she kept saying what is that
they've gone back and forth oh my god
gonna be like that what end up happening
is ladies like a fact-checker mr.
darling and water bag check this
and I like the lady was like we can't go
anywhere
