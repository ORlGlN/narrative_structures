you guys remember a couple months ago
about the sponsor that we had a Opinion
Outpost it was the one bet basically I
was telling you the story of how I used
to do surveys as a job back in high
school but basically it short you go on
the website it's free to sign up and
what you do is it get quarterly $10,000
prizes and the more like surveys you do
the more money you can get and you know
things like that so what I'm gonna do is
click the link down there in the
description below and it's free to sign
up and then once you sign up you click
the promotional tab in Gmail you can see
all the correspondence where the Opinion
Outpost and I talked about this a couple
months ago real I like this is because
it's free and it's kind of a cool thing
just you know if you're hanging around
on the internet and you want to do
something some busy work and make some
money but yeah check out guys links are
in the description hope you enjoy it and
maybe you guys will be one of the ten
thousand dollar quarterly winners and if
you do you owe me a root beer this is
another reason why I don't like these
Ninja Turtles one minute they're like
really evil looking the next they're
just like kooky and fun there's not
