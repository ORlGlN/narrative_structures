well you Marley you're hiding them every
time I say the B word where's Zoey go
get cleaned come on Marley you're the
worst little crackhead each and every
five seconds let's do this
freaking crazy dogs and I could be
itching all crazy
so diesel might come over tomorrow so
you guys have to look nice and pretty
nice and presentable can't be itching
all the time there you go forget your
trunk does it feel
I won't blow your face don't look at our
you dummy let's do it
what - yes - I have honey it's been a
nice lazy Sunday and what better way to
end it is making homemade almond butter
remember we've never done this before
this might be a complete disaster
you ready to do this so you go get that
so all we got to do is this almonds in a
food processor you know what else we
should do you know do you mean well it
starts being a little oily in two
seconds you're you even feel like can I
really do it if you read Thank You
Damian odd some caches because they're
softer are easier to make that kind of
butter but that's what we're trying to
do yeah do this so it's like kind of a
lazy day today figured out this is the
best way till I kind of end it wind it
down put those almonds in there oh shoot
I don't either
put that baby in there well just do a
little bit of these great it will go
slow hmm there's something we chop it or
grinded it matter
chop it probably quite a few trucks feel
like you're having so much fun with this
ran away
how'd it come out I think Ali and I need
this go into the the service industry of
making food that a rope
we got a ruby er at a root beer we got a
root beer now we got almond butter
which guys when they say online it
requires patience they are not lying
there you stay there for a while doing
that takes like 30 minutes I have an
idea I'm gonna try to end the video with
that in my mouth hope you enjoyed
today's video
