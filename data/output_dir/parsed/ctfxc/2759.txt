powers car isn't that like the awesome
power car
well this is obnoxiously big yeah

I've never been able to actually this is
the first time I've ever been out Hummer
so this is the perfect time to get used
to this are all hovers like this is
amazing Universal City you see that
giant blue screen just behind the
universal law where they make movies

the Waterworld jet skis actually we
gotta find Buckley right now he's
apparently hosting
you guys are so really gonna be this
just a couple youtubers in here that's
it they're gonna be so sad just those
people so Justin just said this but we
have to reiterate it that we actually
had some people in that crowd two lovely
girls that actually knew YouTube they
knew what the website YouTube was so I'm
very proud of that
that's Jimmy Fallon
all right so this is a bit confusing I'm
so confused
I really don't want to walk through that
we have to walk through that I don't

Ali's having
some things are better just sitting in
the left alone but it's been a while 17

starting to get a headache from all the
Bieber fever fans he's not even here
dedicated iphone user right there yes we
are congratulate Mike on cancer all did
a great job get a great job in the blue
carpet
it's the reason to reading out these
little cards they're all important
that's so weird I don't understand
Joseph re-save in a live broadcast but
it looks like everyone is holding
authorities
look at you guys David Beckham for
signing this I like this game to go

those green that blue so we're trying to
get Lucas to come in our big giant
Hummer we're trying to get as many
people as possible just the pile no
douche-mobile are you nervous

all right so we're waiting for our huge
mobile this is the chaos behind the team
choice I was just yelling at each other
because they don't know whose cars who

I've ever been inside for them to pee
grossest and their looks give a light
its next tire they can see out there and
air conditioning there's air
conditioning in the supportive body in

and now there's I'm gonna pan down
though
ready look at that delicious
hey guys so we're back at the hotel and
I'm about to pass out cuz we have to
catch it early flight but I just wanted
to take this time to say thank you to
guys for making this my job it's for
every single day like I it's just one of
those things where it's just like I
cannot believe this is my job and you
guys make this possible and it's so cool
I cannot believe I've ever watching him
the Teen Choice Awards when I was
younger and I never thought I would be
one attending let alone walking the
carpet and meeting people and being
nominated that's just that blows my mind
seriously blows my mind and without you
guys honestly it's what we would do so
cliche but we wouldn't be anywhere and
unfortunately says you know YouTube
still as a baby in the entertainment
industry some people don't take us
seriously and because you guys are so
hardcore the entertainment industry
industry is uh having to take us
seriously or we're a legitimate force
and we were a force to be reckoned with
because if they don't watch out you know
Internet will kill TV or we can we could
play nice we could play nice and that
would be nice too we didn't announce who
won while we're there for the categories
so I don't know who won we all left not
knowing who won so if you know by the
time this video is up let me know in the
comments comment to be traveling if
you're seeing this video up that means
Ally's mom was able to upload it for us
and you should you should reply her and
tell her thank you because otherwise
this video would be up until like 11:00
p.m. Eastern anyway I'm rambling I just
want to say thank you again
um oh if you weren't subscribed to my
cell phone

I uploaded like six or seven videos
throughout the day at the Teen Choice
that's not on here so go to youtube.com
slash trippy you already can click right
here somewhere in this video if you
can't click here that means I haven't
landed in Florida and the annotation is
not alive but if you can click here that
