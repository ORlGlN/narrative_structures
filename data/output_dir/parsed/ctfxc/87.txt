time to start the travel there it's
always cracked me up this getting these
guys up and it's always fun because they
do not want to get up like I don't want
to get up in the morning go back to bed
so the little story about that whole
situation was that was a kid who's 20
years old from World War two he died
overseas and then it took him this long
the tide went down low enough for the US
soldiers to across the ditch and then
that's died
yeah they got started the time starting
up in maybe it's attacking some drown
before these are native land
yeah and now they they finally just
identified it and they're bringing them
back home so I think that was the thing
is the only remaining
you know what say what you want I mean
like about government and stuff like
that but that's that's cool yeah mph
I had to stop and show you as a tribe
and I just fixated on it we're like you
got to go see it
I pay respects I think the entire
airport is actually watching

crying anymore I'm the baby whisperer
