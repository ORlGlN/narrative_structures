I have decided and I realized and comes
the conclusion and all those good things
that I have a problem I play video games
way too much so thank god you're finally
admitting so I am now making a rule for
myself that I'm only allowed to play
video games for two hours every day
that's thank God thank God so two hours
every day only because scan to be a lot
of ridiculous I know we're playing today
that's right
I feel it totally that happened now I
get two more hours today also I'm saying
this because I realized that I have not
been have not been appearing that much
in the vlog it's like except for yelling
at Charles because he's trying to take
my controller while I'm laughing so yeah
I'm sorry and I need to get back to my
duties as a faithful vlogger and a
faithful member of CTFxC because as of
now I'm just a potato
Oh
okay so Fall Out Boy is one of those
bands that you don't like to admit that
you like but they're so damn catchy I'll
never admit it wait I just did so chef
Charles is gonna cook up another
scrumdiddlyumptious meal tonight
I got I got it like this craving to like
cook something some sort of masterpiece
I don't know what to cook it I'll get
inspired but I see all that food I'll
just you know get fried chicken oh my
god fried chicken sounds delicious
oh it's a full moon tonight
I wonder if Jacob would come out the
Olympics are over wait who got more gold
medals was it Canada or United States
you know did the United States it looks
like Mario Mario the mine what are these
this is like Superman's like layer it's
this crystal Fortress of Solitude so
we're gonna make some awesome food okay
I want to try to make something that you
guys suggested on Twitter
it's from the TV show iCarly and it's
called spaghetti tacos so I'm gonna try
to make that before I make my dinner you
want to try it spaghetti taco it's from
iCarly well it's really so I've never
seen that show I'm just going from what
you guys say and about the spaghetti and
tacos
I assume you just put it in okay
so we'll let this boil well that looks
really cool what is that
we need vinegar we don't need vinegar
for my zesty herbs oh this looks like
more like stoner food than anything look
at this well we don't have any spaghetti
sauce so I think it just looks like I
ran out of meat and I DS spaghetti
that's the presently a good combination
so I have a really good idea that is
surprisingly delicious that's not bad is
it too spicy for the hot sauce that's
not well that's not bad though is it all
you stoners are like oh my god my brain
just exploded this is delicious
there you go spaghetti tacos hmm can you
guys smell it doesn't that look
delicious
I really wish they have like
smell-o-vision on YouTube it'd be
awesome oh there are probably some
really smelly people on YouTube I don't
know if we want to smell them hmm get in
the bath where did you dingus sister oh

supposed to be in there how did you do
