good morning Internet starting the day
getting our MRI checkup and then we are
traveling to Hawaii right after that so
we do this that we have to drive all the
way over Orlando and get on a plane
danny is already leaving so he's gonna
beat us a white asshole mmm fun time all
right time to go on the dubstep machine
I just got I guess this is an IV or a
port or whatever you want to call it and
I call it ass up and every time I move
there's like a wire a plastic thing
right there and you can just feel it on
my veins all right guys that's now
that's two months ago that's four months
ago pretty much identical so we're good
so good news on the MRI front and we
have to rush now to Orlando to get on
the plane we're flying out Orlando
because they have a better flight for us
like a more direct flight I don't think
it is because I think we have a long
layover in Oakland on but anyway long
story short before we leave I'm gonna
give them our nice little ride around
the ballpark
then you guys can get pissed off they
always get this off all right so we're
about to leave right now I feel I was
the worst part I always feel so bad
I feel like Zoey Marly gained like five
pounds every time I just leave the house
cuz I give him so many cookies so we
just talked to the one of the people
that are running the whole Hawaii thing
oh by the way yes we're gonna join field
right now because we are waiting for
snacks because open the car waiting for
snacks right now because I have a
pumpkin case that has all the gear for
the show on Friday and just to make sure
you know the show goes on the show must
go on I'm gonna give it to snacks just
in case so we can have everything he
needs
big old snack case at snacks one box
why do you think you're so tough guys I
go to the gym all the time I go to the
gym Alton I'm just female as well and
you're just know you feel accomplished
though no I just
anyway what I was starting to say was
that we need to get all the uh geez
you're not gonna put your big-ass thing
on here bringing us like a sweater a
hoodie is the dumbest thing we could do
we drive over here it's mostly really
interesting I'm excited it's gonna be
more of like I can't be experienced so
jeans are probably dumb - right
they bring one page weird just going to
hopefully make this flight right now
we're we was met up with Ben couldn't
get the camera out in time I was like
here you go and now we are hopefully
gonna make this flight we have and how
were to get there in time but my stress
levels
are like through the
you know that like snapchat app that the
day where they had the steam coming out
of your ears you turn red that's kind of
like what we are right now that's more
nerves instead of pissed-off Ness ah
mother I don't sounded like a people we
might make this perfect we are flying
Delta okay so we're doing by the way
this is totally my fault I'm gonna
totally admit it this is my this is my
fault II I wanted to fly Delta because
of the sky mile situation
yeah you've got 30 minutes of course we
have 10 minutes
we're fuckin running and I say run you
run I don't give a shit this is
definitely
like because we trade up a car like a
new car they were gonna make it
after all the years
I know right we have what 10 minutes
right rip 10 minutes until the bag cut
off I mean if anything we could lose
their bag we'll ship it home you don't
need your bag here
at my bag these were my clothes well our
bags are technically in the flight I
just met some awesome people from
Glasgow Scotland actually in the rush to
kids actually I think they're right over
there and for this close this look
we are almost that not we're off the car
bags this was a little bit like I just
want to run just want to sprint down I
think I could go faster
how's this thing open come on any time
now today today today go
no stop never our thoughts I hate
running on the backpack yeah you look
like a turtle babe just kill baby I'm
slowing you down I'm slowly dude
I don't really can't believe we made it
wait do it again that's all freeze frame
it the cheesiest thing ever
well deserved of them we did it low-five
look at respect though they have our
exhaustion
they do that
I'm a pretty good pilot
what kazoos was this take off autopilot
things like that welcome to Los Angeles
International Airport what do you want
to just get there faster it's a race she
beat me I feel like we walked these
halls the two days ago
I just heard from Danny he's just made
it in Hawaii
that's the adventure travel plugs
there's Wi-Fi I'll go any more Wi-Fi in
an outlet to plug the computer in that's
all I can't lose the Guinness world
record anymore
