so I feel completely rejuvenated and
refreshed and not tired anymore it's
like 11:30 and I thought you know what
maybe I can you know pre-order the
iPhone now nope still having problems so
I think I'm gonna just go to the Best
Buy and do it there I don't know were
you guys having problems when you try to
preorder I'm trying on the Apple website
but some people said do the 18 t but I'm
afraid if I do it's gonna like not get
here until like July I don't really
trust AT&T too much so we're gonna try
Best Buy maybe radio check
do you guys hear Ringo and Dre that way
you woke up I'm just at a vague I'm they
freaked out so I pretty much gave up on
trying to preorder I kept getting some
stupid error I think along with everyone
else in the world so we're gonna go get
some soil this time so you actually
planted the onion is it not good idea
what is it it's garlic that's garlic I
just went outside and got some clay but
we forgot our dirt we've got Tallahassee
still close to Georgia
it's full of clay I don't really think
garlic like a clove can actually grow
gods we're good so we're actually gonna
pay money for dirt yes we're gonna pay
money for dirt it's weird isn't it it's
a weird concept but we're gonna do it
silly looking tree so you're gonna pay
for 28 for dirt that we can find on the
ground house plus two there's another
one we should totally get in the dirt
business we could just like dig outside
and then just package it I don't know
dirts dirt - man what's the good kind of
dirt guys how come there's always an
effing spider on this place let's get a
pineapple plant
cactus penises again so we're gonna go
see what the story is here I'm dragging
Ali she's she's also thrilled to be on
the search for the iPhone floor
you're gonna see what there's this in
Radio Shack so we may have a couple more
stops so Best Buy said that they would
basically order but I don't know I don't
really that's good parking job sorry
about that
total parking fail by that person anyway
they said that they would order it they
pre-ordered for us but there's no
guaranteed be here the 24th and since I
can obviously not wait I'm not doing
that
Analia made fun of me so we are now
going to just wait and you know just

I wanna see if we can find a gator
everyone was really bummed that we
couldn't show him the Gator um last time
we were here I think there's one right
out there no fishing unless you're 65
years old or older wait so if you are 15
to 64 you can't fish that doesn't make
any sense whatsoever how does that make
any sense that is like the most backward
law that I've ever our ordinance that's
weird
we should fish and they're all see the
Gators no none yet a lot of turtles I
always walked into a huge spider right
there
freaking spiders you want to eat that
turtle a taquito
you see what those people are doing is
they're feeding the Gator you should
never do that ever feels like a sauna
I'm like sweating so much ma what do you
