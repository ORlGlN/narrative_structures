hello Idaho
so return for time I want to try to blow
this up in slow motion
little positivity for today guys the
Boise State University is like right
next to the venues that were walking
around I can't figure this out they're
the ones with the blue football field
right so are they under the Broncos the
stallions
the horsies the potatoes we're trying to
figure it out
first up in Idaho so we're lost on Boise
State University I think we found the
stadium way back there oh yeah look I
got and we're gonna go try and pretend
like we're a part of a part of the
faculty the bathroom I think I put blue
basketballs um I was gonna see if we can
find that blue field what I know we have
to walk back so well there it is we
snuck in don't tell anyone we jumped
over a few fences you know I ran a
couple security guys just so you guys
can see it probably any of that all
right time to leave before we get caught
like a cappuccino donut these looks so
good
I don't know what we're under and might
be like another road I don't know is it
a road above us or the Train
we're going on
we're going on our way we are on our way
River tour I don't want to die we just
have to walk I think don't kill
we're on our way to a oh god oh god no
way to the river to go on a
then we are going to this is beautiful
by the way I keep getting distracted by
everything that's so pretty
going to be some watts how do they get
that car in there
so yeah all those flowers that we were
welcomed by yesterday people buy them
and they put them at these little spirit
houses outside so offerings and it's
really pretty all of them are so
intricate and just beautiful okay I
think we found my new favorite street in
Bangkok been here for two days and I
already have a favorite street that's
the whole fish whoa I don't even know
what that is I think we found something
pretty cool here
on the sidewalk there's I'm gonna get it
worried me here I just know it
oh you guys this place is so beautiful
this isn't frightening
all the food looks really good
this is huge and incredible everything
all the details how long it took and how
they did it
hey I want to go to there
you know that genre bluegrass yeah
that's where it was invented right there
right there the first song was written
on the 50-yard line it's named bluegrass
someone's excited for a library awesome
a tree how fast can you count them this
is amazing
the detail all these tiny pieces of
colored glass
I think I found my new country residence
time
look like eventually it's trimming all
the pieces and putting on anybody can
read this post it in the comments moving
a little fast
thank you
do you guys see all the little tadpoles
in here this is just beautiful yeah I
really wish the hi there's something
about this place or had a guide that
spoke Thai in English that could tell me
what everything is because I don't know
I wish I could tell you but it's kind of
interesting that way it's kind of
interesting to just be amazed by the
beauty and kind of not even really know
the story it's kind of a unique way to
experience it I think Cerreta flat that
basically says that the first King Rama
had
scribe a bunch of information on marble
plaques all throughout Wat Pho
later came around the third had even
more inscriptions done and it basically
says that this was then you know sort of
translated into the first University in
Thailand because it had all of these
significant bits of information and
really important historical events or
future generations to come and study so
that's actually really cool I found
you're getting happy one that seems like
it would be a little bit scary I'll come
to us oh okay this is - the construction
mess that's really high up what kind of
getting the tools and stuff up it's the
basket that's the back of it okay guys
here it is the reclining through them
