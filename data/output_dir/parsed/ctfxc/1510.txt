home which is an airport and this is
what we have in Florida was it called
poinsettia a poinsettia poinsettia point

rate it's like 30 degrees or something
like that it's colder than our
refrigerator I don't get to use my phone
like a cool kid come you always get
something where it's my number one every
time to greet us is Ted said hi he's
like where are you here yesterday
thankfully today I got the TSA PreCheck
which means I don't have to take off any
of my jackets or better take my computer
out or do anything or Ali didn't get
accepted because I'm diamonds and we fly
so much with the band that I got it now
did I hate going through that thing
where your arms up and it goes around
you did I read somewhere that that
wasn't really good because the radiation
now but cautious on everything do what I
do now is get the pat-down but it
nothing at the prefect looks good I beat
you
why don't they just do radio essential
that's what that giant piano is doing
was the first time on a plane where you
can actually have your phone electronic
the place is like this is pretty large
it's the largest li drama could me I'm
on the internet on a plane taxiing
that burst on the play

airplane

on the phone and it looks like we had to
cancel the appointment so it means we're
in Atlanta right now and we're just went
