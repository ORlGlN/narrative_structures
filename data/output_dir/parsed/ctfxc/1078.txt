good morning Internet we're all popping
frantically my fancy clothes were clean
or anything like that and they kind of
had a rip so Ali ran to the store the
superwoman and grabbed some new ones as
she's frantically packing and look at

deserve the eyes or piss off this can
anyone find Marley

my pants on these pants I didn't know I
had a hold on

this shirt somewhere playing with your
finger that's mean

know the overhead bins being completely
full is still upload the vlog so I'm
staying back to use on YouTube server

along the plane so this is how you
properly hit on a girl or guy while
you're on a plane okay the same as the
other times exactly
I already have done this so you guys
should be learning when out so the girls
right there or the guys right there you
know like that messing with their hair
putting in an alley bun whatever I don't
know go
and then you probably look closer
98% of works all the time
