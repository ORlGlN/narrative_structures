let's bring it back to you in
appropriate time good morning everyone
love the hold music today has turned
crazy day alright we just had mute just
in case
so first off I'm on the insurance phone
call again trying to figure this whole
situation out I think we're okay that I
don't want to say that because I don't
know what's going on they're trying to
work on it my doctor's already said over
stuff so this stupid-ass insurance
company that explains why I have to be
on jimpat and why there's no generic
version blah blah blah and now
addressing the fact I woke up this
morning from random stuff but that
thought was a crazy day I woke up I'm
not even exaggerating I wish it to the
screenshot over to over a hundred and
ten text messages not even kidding it
was a group chat for the we the Kings
River with the Kings like group chat on
uh on our messages so that way like when
we have anything like touring we could
just send it out there and everyone get
it you guys get what a group chat is I
don't need to explain that woke up to
110 messages because everyone I told you
yesterday my flight guy canceled and
there was nothing I can do everyone
else's flights were fine until they got
to Atlanta where the whole club you
probably all heard already the cluster
of Atlanta right now so everyone is
trapped either in Atlanta Houston or
still in LA so obviously I'd miss the
Arizona show I don't know what's going
on as far as now I think the only ones
making that Arizona are Colin you know
our sound guy maybe Nate are like guy
and maybe Travis but I don't know he
keeps getting delayed and Danny I don't
know where Danny is and every once in a
while Danny takes a photo where is that
and send us through group checks I have
no idea where he's at I thought he was
in Houston that I thought he was
somewhere else but all I know is poor
Danny has to go to like Phoenix and then
drive two hours to Tucson on top of
everything else so last night must have
been like a bad omen about traveling and
we should have paid attention honestly I
mean as fat as it sounds switching the
situation I'm just kind of glad I had
zero options yesterday and I was
avoiding too
a traveling because everyone sounds
absolutely freaking miserable right now
so we can bypass Atlanta all together we
got tickets on American Airlines so we
can go straight to Philly I think it's a
direct flight so knock on wood the show
in Philly will still go on hopefully
knock on what Arizona so happens
hopefully they figure something out and
everyone gets there might take them 10
hours to get there but feel so bad for
the guy
it was just 110 text messages I was
insane I've never ever ever seen or
heard that I really wish I took a
screenshot I think it was because I woke
up at like 7:00 at 8 o'clock to feed the
dogs and I saw that I was like what the
hell I wasn't paying attention
as far as thinking take a screenshot so
far that's what the day is like right
now
crazy right focus on your camera
happy Friday afternoon Internet you guys
have probably already figured out
Charles is still here that's awesome I'm
very excited about that
I feel bad that he's not at the show
don't get me wrong I know that that
really sucks and it sucks for the
college that excuse me not the voice
we're going out too however we did here
this morning that all the boys were
having some issues flying out due to the
crazy weather that was in Atlanta so
first off anybody that's stuck in the
Atlanta Airport I am so sorry guys safe
travels honestly safe travels and then
tonight which I'm super excited about
I'm gonna try and transform them into a
race fan now am i huge sports fan no do
I know much about sports not at all I
don't really know anything about sports
can I tell you something team
I could probably point them out but I
couldn't tell you what the names are or
their names are anything of that sort
but one thing that I do love is I love
going to a sports game and being around
a lot of excited people and being around
good friends and then having a fun time
so I'm gonna try that's gonna be my
objective today is to get Charles to
enjoy at the race game I'm gonna make
him wear race gear I might even make him
