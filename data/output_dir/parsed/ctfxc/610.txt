why do women do this what is on your
face that's called don't get a little
cream I'm thinking nose grandma eyes cuz
I don't wanna grow dimmer it's like a
scene from the movie birds oh my god
that would actually had another bird
shoot okay I sound like an idiot but
that other bird was carrying another
bird see just to prove that I wasn't
lying there's some of the feathers dang
it what the hell is going online now
let's see if I can show you guys the
bird on bird attacks it was an osprey
she was attacking all the other birds
like a jerk well I like to think of it
as they just save the birds life then so
we're gonna go do the blood drive thing
that we promised yesterday on our way to
Busch Gardens put on our way there they
they moved it so I'm gonna find it again
do you remember when the radio is filled
with like pop punk bands like back of
the day when you turn on the radio and
the big guitar on the radio I don't
think a lot of people who may have been
born during that era there was once a
time on the radio when you turn it on
and there was a guitar and a drum
hurry up I want to go ride roller
coasters let's go given my theme park
record gets super checked every single
time I get sidetracked every single time
every time we go to Disney it always
happens and every time I go anywhere
else Universal I think it's tattoos but
we did find out that guys that it is
like it take a counter but I'm always
the f Jessica I think I'm really unlucky
so I should never go to Vegas they're
all your relatives call up Fred follow
follow follow they're not very big Fred
Fred Mike follow first ones to be Sakura
I don't know a secret
yeah you guys are in a baggie right now
because I didn't bring the waterproof
camera okay
the water's like blue like beyond blue
that's why we had the camera back
it was nice up today and now we're back
to normal
see the thing is I can't get my camera
out in time to show you the aftermath of
every roller coaster on her alley she
looks like a freaking crazy person it
was like the crazy cat lady in Simpsons
throws the cat we have everything I used
to love as a kid is it true time to get
soaked we shouldn't miss her I wish I
had though like who you walk outside it
was just like in volume like Charlie
Brown style I honestly can't remember
the last time I went on a Congo River
Rapids good look back so you guys are
coming along ready
I look for the driest place to go
but I always feel like the driest place
always turns into the wet plate the next
time we do this we get more wet myself
our ally response video forget that
waterfall
they bear
they got this thing so if you thought I
was we get more wet than Ali
it actually was very refreshing
got all your suntan lotion what is that
we wrap it back in that was a blast
I love doing the water eyes water
chillers all right we got to do the tree
shell khumba
I forgot how cool the coup is I came to
speak correctly right now but I haven't
walked incorrectly this one always makes
me all
this was actually I think my first
roller coaster my last one when you ever
come to Busch Gardens shave Kumba for
last but would you say you have boob
sweat
oops I got boob sweat too
slightly surprised does anyone actually
know the g-forces on Kumba have Busch
Gardens in Tampa whatever it is I don't
think I could ever be an Air Force
just facing down nope
yeah buddy
Oh God
debating I'm going on this right now
there's no hay up still on top of that
there's no way in hell good doctor do
want to get beat up pick up
dr. doom on the universe that's bad
enough
I'm gonna do it or follow me just like
garlic
he just likes you
never been on this one
that's a fun one you can see me holding
the camera hold the camera but that was
actually we feel it was actually trying
to figure out how to turn the camera off
because it was so fast
that's Supercenter than going on a
Cheetah Hunt that's probably one of my
favorite ones because it it feels like
just like a ride and that's so much like
something like tumble you yeah it was
actually really nice and enjoyable but
now here's the thing working out and
hitting a wall and we have one more
roller coaster I don't even think we
could even find the new one and there's
a brand new one we haven't been everyo
fine nevermind found it I just opened
yesterday 75 I don't think I want to do
75 minutes especially with a train
coming down right now we're about to
come down hey it goes backwards and it
spins it around and does all this crazy
stuff it's pretty unique actually I
really want to do it but I don't think I
could do an hour over an hour and a half
I don't think I can do that but this is
probably gonna be the last roller
coaster
I'm John yeah
perfect timing I think took for the rain
now - nobody tells me the rent I think
the funniest part was that my my chest
thing was going up and down I don't know
if he gets good see it was literally
coming up and down like three or four
inches
whatever there's that late name
I think we timed it just perfectly
actually they're rehearsing
they were imperfect had we gotten in the
car and then it's a rain but we have to
see a rainbow at least it really wasn't
bad that was actually almost refreshing
because going on those constantly I feel
like it was it kind of getting us a
little bit sick Alex and I started
trying like really pale white the blood
just goes so I got a churros that's how
I justified it this is the first time I
was able to actually flip the screen up
and all I have to say is puberty still
sucks Gardens was a blast we kind of
poured on a very last minute and then we
got on the tram to go back to our car
and I sat in a spot literally that was
just like pouring down rain right on me
the whole entire time it was a blast
though I will recommend this oh my god
she got you is so bad look at that we
had a lot of CTFxC reserves yeah it was
grateful one thing I do recommend though
and we were talking about it because at
first were like we probably made a
really stupid mistake by getting like
that fast passing totally flip and get
it we went on almost every single ride
and got on like that wasn't that busy
today but there was a ride that was like
45 minutes long got on into so I
definitely recommend that our dogs get
organic food on top of organic wet food
on top of like I don't know coconut oil
like virgin coconut oil but I thought
it'd be kind of funny to give Marley two
little strawberries Marley Marley loves
sorry so look at how nice it is
oh that's a nice that's a nice meal and
then these little Zoe or just very
boring
they don't make cocoons in their food so
Marley's food looks all professionally
done thank you thank you
go first cuz you got mother you have an
exit the air pressure surprise okay
I think she likes it
you're welcome on I just realized this
they're eating gourmet organic food and
I just ate a Freaky Friday row what I
think she just wants a an ecto cooler I
think I went overboard guys I know I
still got this stupid hiccup saying I
don't know how long or how many hours
has been doubt it anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed today's video going to Busch
Gardens remember they're a long time and
