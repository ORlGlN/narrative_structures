see about getting there so I got a rush

so I think we're we're good
oh and by the way we found this awesome
little this coupon for $5 to $10
Starbucks so Danny and I are pretty
happy oh how did they get a pair though
they actually did approve the photo all
right like one we have to fly up to
Detroit and then Brazil it's gonna be
kind of an interesting little flight but
uh little detour
Electronics best friend
so I went down my parents house and now
we are performing the arduous task of
cleaning out the closet this is an art
project that I did when I had to model a
house after like an African color house
we did a lot of research and I can't
remember the specific name of this kind
of house but this is the this is my
design look at the top of my house yep
put the raffia pretty amazing it's my
house
about a shoebox I don't remember what I
got in me and that's what moms are for
and that is me as a baby
so he loves when there's golf on TV it's
her nap time that is pretty cool there
we go
get cozy guys this might be the last bit
of vlogs for me today because that was
around a plane for Travis yeah I don't
know Kennedy does have a waddle but I
feel like everyone has a water look I do
reverse pigeon-toed that's Travis as
well Huck he's strutting that's what
he's doing
he's got like a strut it's like a you
gotta go a pip stride land in Sao Paulo
around 7:00 a.m. so that's what I'll see
you guys in the next one if if I
disappear but right now I'm not
disappeared see when you don't look for
something they just show up that's
exactly what you gotta do they say where
to go do you need $500 that's how much
it was jeez
is it this way this is exactly where I
want to go
yeah gummi bears and jelly beans what's
your ante to get so many gummies
this is literally the first thing she
does every time she comes out here Zoe
Oh Oh what I'm just gonna roll round
your psycho and here comes the butt
crack oh you're all blurry though what's
going on focus camera focus so Charles
is on his way to Sao Paulo Brazil to do
I think they're doing something super
secret and fun I don't know if he's
already told you what's going on the bad
wife I guess I haven't paid attention
but yeah he's gonna have a blast down
there he's gonna be there for like four
days or something like that
and then he comes back for a little bit
and then he's gone for like a really
long time so I'm gonna have to find some
new and fun things to do while he's away
it's hard because you know I mean we've
had the luxury of being able to be
together for so long
literally together every day I mean
because of what we both do for our job
YouTube and everything we've been able
to spend day in and day out you know at
each other's side so it's kind of hard
it's but it's definitely been an
adjustment getting used to not being
able to see him every day it's kind of
hard to be away from him because I love
him obviously but yeah we're gonna make
some adjustments he's lucky he's got a
bunch of dudes hanging out with him all
the time I guess I could just move back
in with my parents so like a complete
idiot I completely forgot my converter I
forgot I was going in another country so
I have to kind of rush around
frantically trying to find that
otherwise it won't have a hard time
plugging the camera in hook the computer
and to Brazil feels like we were just
there um kitchen I'm trying to go
through that Thanks you're nuts
so I found these in my older and my
parents house I don't even know where I
can access what's on these like I don't
even know of a computer that still has a
floppy drive this is like crazy oh
there's my English homework this is
their most favorite thing food I feel
like kind of a d-bag we got here a
little bit late for it to Lana they
close at 10:00 and walked in like 9:30
I feel really bad I always feel like a
total butt crack when I do that but we
were so angry so as you can see this is
a really open flight like these are all
empty seats hey Danny you have an empty
seat give an empty seat you too they
wouldn't let you to sit up there okay
that first yeah you got it
Danny's big brains not big old noggin he
got us free out
good job dude maybe I should sit yeah
can i well I guess I gotta go I feel
like we have our own plane to ourselves
but as you can see the pretty empty
sleigh get the evil eyes on dude and
there's gonna be a long play well I
can't really argue yeah I'll go Fonzie
check out the pretty sunset
we made friends with
that's a set of peanut
hit this button flight attendant Mike
alright guys I'm going to bed I'm
currently wearing Charles clothes
Charles's pajamas um I rest in that
weird I don't know I hope not
yeah I just I hope that he had a very
safe flight I haven't actually talked to
him yet because he hasn't landed in
Brazil but I think I'll probably get a
phone call in the next few hours it'll
be pretty late I cannot wait to see
