since I've been gone all weekend hanging
out with my little sister
that I should take the dogs to the park
great that sound good
no since I would sit down where they are
are they another bitch
you're probably fried did that all with
no hands I feel like everything has been
charged in a long time or that or is
this super slow I think it's time I
upgrade this golf cart one day
supercharge it if you will this past
weekend was really nice it was like a
time where I could just kind of relax
and just take a step back something a
lot of things really needed to do
because it's kind of funny like I don't
know if you guys know this about me I
feel like I'm always like 50 steps ahead
of everything like like planning or
planning stages I'm just like always 50
steps ahead and this weekend was really
nice I just got the like chill and hang
out and just be like present you only
mean if that makes any sense really nice
really enjoyable relaxing just to hang
out and so I just want to say thank you
guys for being so understanding of the
videos last couple days and tomorrow
actually slowly sit your butt down
tomorrow actually I'll be completely
honest today that's why I'm a little bit
kind of out of it tomorrow I have
another MRI checkup and every time I
know it's gonna be good but every single
time I always have this nerve-wracking
feeling it's always it was anxious it's
always very nerve-wracking first like I
know it's gonna be awesome results and
I'm just praying that the thing is just
destroyed it's completely gone but it's
always like a nerve-wracking thing
now I haven't been there in a while and
it's always been good good in Austin
last few times every single times
progressively better tomorrow I have an
MRI and then Tuesday I'm working on the
sleeve again so and then this weekend we
have a couple shows in New York so a
little bit of traveling this weekend

just so sleepy today at the Rays game I
almost fell asleep you have fun yeah
