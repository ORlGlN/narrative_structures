good morning Internet and welcome to
Vegas

just got off the phone with Ally I don't
know if you guys know that whole Delta
complete outage she was on the plane
during this whole situation so she was
supposed to be here in like 30 minutes
but unfortunately I think she's pushed
back for a few hours which sucks because
I wanted to do a bunch of things while
she was here to the airport and going on
here
the world at Delta systems are screwing
up in our town nothing is working it's a
great start and it's a story about
something breaking
there's a crazy delay at the airport
today there's so many people have been
here for hours their flights are going
off
girl's gonna get bigger turn it up
that's almost liquid
I don't know why you don't like
something so Ali's gonna be here in like
an hour and a half I'm gonna try to meet
her at the airport
I guess there was a bunch of like system
errors with Delta everything got screwed
up yesterday so she was supposed to be
here two hours ago which would have been
nice so she could come to the pool but
you know everything happens at the night
in Vegas so it won't be too bad so I
can't keep I can't keep a thought
process right now without going up

flight to go to Las Vegas because we sat
on the tarmac for like four hours
