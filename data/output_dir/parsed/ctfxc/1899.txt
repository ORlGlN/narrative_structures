this is the thing that keeps creating
the farts if you don't remove this this
right here alright so at the beginning
of the day you probably noticed that
Marley has taken over anything and all
that stuff
those two videos are actually old videos
that we did on the Charles Trippy
channel I guess probably a year or two
ago the first one was dog squirrel
chasing a squirrel and the other one was
all hail hit no dog all right so here
was one of them
and then the other one was all hail
hitting a dog which was Marley
hypnotizing everybody as you can see in
the video earlier that was what it was
their flaming eyeballs so I'm gonna
create something today called flashback
Sunday you can watch these two skits
I'll put an annotation at the end of
this video or the video description
below
basically dogs will chase a squirrel and
all he'll hit no dog to commemorate
Marley taking over our editing
possibilities in this vlog there they're
pretty they're weird they're weird
I'm just gonna be honest they're weird
but I think you guys might get a kick
out of them so I will see you guys
tomorrow
good night and enjoy those videos
