good morning guys Salt Lake City and one
more dad feel like crap today they're
just little bookin get on your fly I got
a special little pinky up cocktail see I
gotta get rid of this thing because I'm
going home
what in like two days and on the fourth
I started around the chemo and I don't
want to be sick so I'm trying to get rid
of this she was possible apparently I
was going the wrong way Steve caught me
into always go out the opposite
direction one more day don't get me
wrong what tour is so much fun it's like
it's one of those tours like when you're
on it you just want to go home when
you're off of it you just want to go
back on it that makes any sense
dropping all my vitamin C
not only is this delicious food but it's
also shelter for my tattoo whatever you
get a tattoo it always feels like the
Sun is like stabbing it so that's why
I'm sheltering it and some tampons to
plug my nose up my nose keeps running
like randomly it's so annoying so I'm
just gonna create a little temporary fix
temporary fix
it's called stage I'm ready
where's their ten
I look stupid but this is actually a
really good idea it's like tickling my
nose though so I feel like it was
seasons gonna go everywhere
what are you covered there trav
marijuana state about the tattoo thing
mine hurts I can only imagine what's
happening of trav right now
such power
so I just talked to my mom and she says
if I'm sick when I come home she gonna
kick my ass but then she's gonna hand me
over to Ally
so I gotta feed this bowl vitamin C over
D so what previous stop bitch idea was
not working so I had to go upgrade to
grade a I was ridiculous still don't
care my tripping all over myself
first off blaming Ryan for all this I
brought this to the bus you brought this
to the bus sir oh yes I've been
completely healthy the entire time
sir all right anyway so I'm trying to
relax a little bit so I don't get worse
and I thought it'd be a good time to
just kind of lay back at my bunk and
listen to a couple audiobooks I have my
computer my phone sorry you can't take
me serious right now and a little you
see there this or I dribble all over the
place and that's probably worse anyway
so right now I'm listening to a book
called stories I can only tell my
friends it's by Rob Lowe it was actually
narrated by Rob Lowe you could actually
get I got this from audible.com
which is a sponsor of the CTFxC now if
you're saving yourself Truls I know what
having a count dotto balkon well if you
go to audible.com/veritasium park
Oh God so op and the thing is I know I
talked about audible before because
they've been sponsoring for the CTFxC
for about six months now
it's definitely been one of my favorite
ones like honestly truthfully because I
I love reading but I never had the time
to read I thought I love listening to
things you can sync it to your iPhone
your iPad or your any other mobile
devices your computer and that way
especially oh god because I feel like
this would be bad so like when you're
traveling especially me you can have it
anywhere so I've been doing this for a
lot of Gaga again so if you want to get
some free audiobooks go to audible.com
so CTFxC I highly recommend it and
there's a ton of other books I've done
all the John Green books actually this
book was a recommendation by one of you
guys out in Twitter the Twittersphere
anyway so go to audible.com plus CTFxC
