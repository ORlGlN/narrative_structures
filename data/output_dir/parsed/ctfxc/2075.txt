I'm pissing Zoey off today good morning
guys
well it could have been really bad look
at this for some reason my phone is in
PM mode and not a mode look at this I
was breaking the rules the whole time
huh that's funny
well time to go to Australia up your
frozen nope now you're moving are you
one dial up yeah I think she's on
dial-up
at the moment it's 719 our flight takes
off at 9:00 and you guys know how long
it takes I said like check like 30 feet
of luggage
and this is the line to get through
customs and stuff like that after well
you might be stuck in Malaysia a little
longer don't know how we did it or
crossed immigration right now go out
there security 20 minutes left
wow we actually made it
alright go in Australia
I was like like looking around Danny's
like um should I lay down now and I'm
free
you know he's because thinking
you know she's got a real and I got a
loan okay I'm gonna bet guys I'll see it
a little bit victorious
International Yoshi has an entire row
and he's sleeping like that at the
favorite speed family abode running to
Publix right now because I just shut up
radio running the public's cuz I just
decided at 9:40 at night that I really
want to make a giant cupcake cake cake
cake cake okay what are you doing huh
are you done Jenny coffee what he does
alright let's bake a cake you ready oh
you want to know what really sucks is
that we have like 15 minutes to get all
the stuff we need so we're gonna make
the fastest public strip known to man
are you guys ready for this
that's just public trip ever know in
Japan we got to run I gotta get
everything we need and not make them
have to stay open super later for us
because I feel like a huge jerk so we
got to go okay nope nope nope Oh blurry
footage is blurry
we just stopped off for a quick run down
the sporting aisle anybody want a giant
creepy ass face and toss and smush toss
and splash baby it's time thing about
what that game might
you just got that fun I think I'm gonna
leave it in actually we are here we made
it we're in Sydney Australia and getting
our bags and hopefully this one won't
take four hours I feel like we the kings
can't get in or out of an airport in
under four hours it's impossible I guess
I don't have a dog that little happy
when he walked by and the guy pulled the
ocean side so now we're just waiting and
if I just watching us on all the cameras
just waiting Yoshi
you're alive
so when we landed in the airport a bunch
of CTFxC years were there all you're
gonna get so jealous
yes odo okay the things that she just
got obsessed with sorry honey
I'll try to bring these home so Brian JJ
and I are just walking around we're
gonna go try see the Opera House and I
were in downtown Sydney right now
everyone else is being a little tired
and stuff that's cool
monorail all right with this this is
what all the crosswalks sound like sound
like laser beam it's alive
nice the carnage and the final product
okay we have filled the two halves of
the cupcake and it is ready to enter the
chain of bake aka the oven okay time to
frost and assemble the cake and since we
don't have any sprinkles I'm going to
make use of nerds and put those on top
how do you feel about that Zoey I got a
tail wag I like it okay guys so this is
me frosting the cake and while I'm
recording this audio it's currently
pouring down rain outside so I hope that
you can totally hear me so I just used a
vanilla frosting for the bottom half and
I used a little bit of yellow food
coloring and I tried do the best I could
to make it look like an actual paper cup
that you put on sided cupcake this took
a really long time
but I think it turned out okay the only
thing is that I wish I would have put a
little more frosting in the middle
because it turned out a little bit too
dry looking back on this now I
definitely would have done a few things
differently I'm frosting the top here
with chocolate frosting just cuz I
thought it was gonna be a good idea and
I thought it would look really nice
which it did but it didn't taste quite
as good as I hoped it would and I think
again I would have used a little bit
more frosting or maybe put some more
frosting in the middle of the two cakes
maybe carved out a space for it because
the cake was just so massive on the
inside that it was super super dry also
definitely do not recommend using nerds
as sprinkles on cakes check it out all
the buildings are alive
and here it is guys the Sydney Opera
House enters a giant lady on there
dancing never thought I'd see that for
that and that projectors coming from
over there it's intense
how does this look guys do this looks
crazy most giant cupcake I've ever seen
so you think like the cupcake is just
close to you but really it's giant like
your head like it's a giant I'm gonna
that's crazy just do it for the fun of
it honestly just like just go for it
anyway oh holy thing wow that is a giant
