really funny they they dye the colors
now I remember when I was little mine

have to actually try to find that but
like yeah just I guess it doesn't look
like a real gun that's really strange
just means that we should have got shot
at skids I guess
get a look both ways before crossing the
street no no dwarves or pluto's I think
we're safe a big document no big ducks
and apparently Tinkerbell goes from the
top
weird al' ago I completely lost her Ally
hold on I know you're all distracted
therefore everyone who can't come to
Disney World you guys are now going into
the castle that's all it is it's just a
just a halt this giant castle it's just
a single hall what can you see really do
they do that on purpose so you people
have to peek through
I feel so creepy doing it there
Cinderella I can see her alright this
one is gonna be completely well lit so
don't worry about it being dark but it
it's the dreaded teacups so everyone's
gonna ride that if you go click right
here so click right here go ride the
teacups click click click
I promise this one's gonna look better
than the last one I won't be in the dark
so just click right here click on my
hand
good luck this is the first roller
coaster I've ever ever went on it's
called Space Mountain it's gonna be way
too dark so I'm just I don't know I'm
gonna try so doing the interactive thing
it might not work but if you ever here
try to go on Space Mountain first roller
coaster I ever went on ma'am they have
no running no running man no running
I'm just now looking at the timer on the
final frontier so yeah you probably just
terrible commentary by me but Space
Mountain safety best ride ever
I'm so scared you have no idea what you
no idea what's going on
you mean all of a sudden it looks like
you know you're gonna run into a bunch
of stars or you know maybe a track but
you know what it's just so surprising I
think that's why that robust
it's like the elevator surprised Oh am I
the only one still hopping one more time
those dead sexy men that sexy
see you later Disney World that was a
fun day
yep the castle do you have a good day
I want to live I want to live everywhere
yes I had a great day sorry I'm
distracted my ten year old self has like
somehow it's just awoken the Beast I
just remember being so excited by
everything I mean we got here a little
too late but you know when you see the
characters huh it's just crazy I saw a
quote from Walt Disney and it's like
something is like we can't lose sight
that this entire dream doesn't this
vision started from a mouse isn't that
kind of crazy to think about
so which one looks a little bit
inebriated this one or that one Oh
Donald just looks like it's the Pooh hey
guys so yeah we're home it's really
weird because if we have to have the
dogs yet we're gonna go first thing in
the morning and get them but as well
four o'clock in the morning I'm just
waiting for all the interactiveness to
export ahem exporting one to all three
computers to get this done but um yeah
hope you guys like these interactive
logs just kind of fun to do every once
in a while as you can see today's video
is probably about close to nineteen
minutes long with all the interactive
stuff
it would've private I don't even know
how long that would be something
different might as well spice it up a
little bit make sure to go check them
all out
definitely my favorite ones were the
teacups and the the the test track and
ya know in the tower terror that was a
good one too I know they're all good
though so yeah make sure to go back if
you didn't get to watch them all put all
the stuff in that video description so
I'm sitting on my side right now I have
no idea is it that way it would be that
way or you scroll through the video just
click it click on it yeah I will see you
guys tomorrow
good night I gotta get some sleep and I
hope you guys had fun at Disney
