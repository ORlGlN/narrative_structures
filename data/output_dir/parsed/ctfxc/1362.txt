and get out change literally this lady
in front of me like had a dollar
I understand like currency like money

a diamond a penny and she was picking
them out but you know what I'm realizing
that like only women could get away with
that like getting money other like her
bra like if I get got out with my crotch
like people wouldn't accept that money
right but why does it okay for like
girls are having in their boobs all
right guys it's kind of sexist wolf and

going it's in taste so victorious once
it comes
- like worth it baby ducks so cute go
get one they're free right there I love
ducks
so naturally I get to my sister's house
and she makes me watch girl chick flick
flick the proposal is such a chick flick
it's good it's got dudes humour here the
only reason why I'm watching this is
because of Sandra Bullock what oh yeah
he's so dreamy so dreamy but I know when
I come and hang out with sister I watch
chick flicks I mean actually when I come
up here I just watch nothing but Rambo
and Bourne Supremacy and stuff like that
this is a dork this is the worst part
about chick flicks is that you hate them
but they're like train wrecks you just
watch them sarcastically then you end up
watching them so we just finished
watching the proposal and then she
immediately turns on fool's gold
so going one to another do you want to
see the neighbors I guess so since
you're I'm making you actually chicken
it's only fair right it looks funny
alright so we're gonna go watch
I'm gonna go drag her to that movie now
I cannot wait for this freakin movie who
else is like afraid that it might suck
though like I am so genuinely like
excited for it I'm just genuinely so I
could just hear it so I guess it's like
a sneak preview it's nothing
we just got out of the neighbors and I
have to say that was probably honestly
one of the funniest movies I've seen in
quite a long time if you've never seen
it highly recommend it I can't remember
a movie honestly that funny the greatest
food planet on the planet is sandwich
