thank you to Paul for your feedback
seven minutes everyone up
so yesterday was emotional it was crazy
Charles is able to come home for just a
little bit and the dogs were super
excited and now he's back on the road
again and it's really sad but the good
news is that he's gonna be coming back
for a while so he'll be home for a
couple months I know we we get to have a
home I am I know you guys miss him so
much in the videos or at least us
together so it's gonna go back to normal
pretty soon we need this we want this
again so this morning I felt like making
something kind of good and I'm just
gonna give you guys a quick description
on it it's super super easy you just
gotta buy some crescent rolls whatever
you prefer I get the butter ones cuz
it's like making a pastry so why not
pile on the fat and then just get
whatever kind of butterscotch chips you
prefer I always Nestle because whatever
but it doesn't even matter you can just
get any kind that you like of a
butterscotch flavored chip that will
melt if it's put in the oven so you
basically just cook them the way they're
directed you heat your oven to 375 get
out a normal baking sheet then you just
put a little bit of butterscotch chips
inside each one and roll it up normally
just take a few of these throw them in
the middle I like to overstuff them
because I just love the taste of the
butterscotch and I'm probably not gonna
be able to do this with one hand but
then you just roll it gently
and then that's one
once that's done what you're gonna want
to do is take a tiny bit of butter and
just melt it in the microwave or if you
have a little over the stove go ahead
and do that just until it's totally
liquefied then you just take a little
bit of your melted butter and you brush
it onto the tops of each one of your
little crescents and then the very last
step before you put it in the oven is
just take a little bit of cinnamon sugar
and sprinkle on the top of each one and
now we take them and we insert them into
the fiery oven it's not really fiery but
it's just hot there we go
let them bake till they're golden brown
hey guys guess what it's hot surprise
surprise surprise
we're gonna wow the best Hill on the
entire tour right now we're trying to
find Yoshi birthday we were thinking
