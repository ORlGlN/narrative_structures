I did wake up to a random act of
kindness the front-desk lady paid for my
cab
so the good thing about earlier flights
like this is I'll get home by like 10
o'clock but the worst part is that just
took the last dose of chemo
at like 1 o'clock in the morning and I
had to get going at length before so
it's like still at my stomach and still
hurts really really bad so try to find
like food you just said all it
gadgets work to divide something small
just being jewelry not jewelry
Theodore
here comes and there he goes
till the next time
holy been a day we're going to bed yo
what's good over can you screw over you
can't have this whole side now I'm back
home anyways so it's a little bit later
than normal but diesel and I are you
going to go for a walk now I had a
really busy morning so now we're gonna
go get our exercise in and I know char
got in like super early today so he's
still kind of resting chars gonna try
and get his butt up and come and bring
the girls if you can try and take the
golf card down here because
unfortunately he can't drive and that's
something you can't drive it was
actually really nasty and gloomy earlier
and I don't know if Laura always
surprises me it ends up turning out
really nice a gloomy day it's never
really like a gloomy day change at the
last minute right dee come on I've
always kind of wanted to take a road
trip for how long obviously I'd love to
take a long one but that doesn't seem to
always work out way that we plan because
time is limited I want to do something
where I can get away and and you know
see places that I don't normally see I
don't really want to stay in hotels
I just want to camp and be on nature I
love to camp actually Charles that I
have never camped before together and
I'm kind of curious to see if he would
be a good person to camp with it's so
funny because we're so similar but we're
so different
but I could live outside in a box for
not really the rest of my life I could
be like I could be like a Swiss Family
Robinson and I could live in a tree or
I'm sorry live in a house in a tree and
I don't know if char could do that
I don't know so we'll see but our plan
is
do this for a trip and take the dogs my
best I know I later in the year we want
to take the dogs to see snow maybe
Melissa will come with us
maybe one of my friends will come with
us maybe my sister who knows love it so
pretty

those first time I'm in the swimming
pool you lost your spot and the
challenge we're having Marly teach
diesel how to get in the pool like

happened yeah we're all trying to avoid
that happen we're just trying to show
them just like exist
