nose for sure hi sweetie

and I got a swoop we're both little emo
kids and still a pony you feel like
we're getting yourself no good - I
remember Kinsley's got our keys
otherwise we're stuck here all the
sudden we hear the cars so this
apparently is the only thing that's
gonna require audio everybody we're
gonna be on this cell phones all that
stuff make sure it's off everybody I'm
gonna be on quiet on set
legitimately quiet on set settle means
legitimately settle he's we've got audio
back there
bring it shot there any of the shout out

small line but it's amazing all the
details that go into the one small line

we don't tell trav and Jenny what we
stole Hensley
we totally stole Kinsley yeah we'll go
back over there okay I can't
so funny are you hugging her she wants
your Android first try for reals
are you turn no Frankie you Stan are you
gonna stay all right so we're just gonna
go home and get some things done I think
we might go exercise or just do some so
we do some stuff at the house because
tomorrow tomorrow wait a while they're
gonna be at the house right so tomorrow
they're actually filming at the house so
we got to make sure everything's nice
and clean and I have to get a couple
things done we might better get back
here in time before the Sun Goes Down I
think as from the clips that we've seen
already it looks like it's going to be
freaking amazing
yeah yeah see they feel like dropping
you off the first day of school right
now kind of are like don't man the first
day of school but not really at all I'll
try to have to forget you at soccer
practice
but I have fun
please careful do you know how to get
yes she has no idea but I have a
surprise that I'm doing for her have fun
there's no idea okay so here's the deal
I have to leave actually on Valentine's
Day so I am going to do something a
little special for her the day today
since I won't be here forever Allen
tines day see thing is Ali and I kind of
have this like unique relationship to
where we don't necessarily celebrate
Valentine's Day per se as a holiday
necessarily on that day we like to do
things for each other constantly got
some flowers now I just got to go back
and pick up Ali before she's none the
wiser not a phrase well got the flowers
I got the candy and thanks to Hallmark
for sponsoring this video and they sent
me a bunch of their signature
Valentine's Day cards these are all
one-of-a-kind cards I got to show you
guys they're like 3d and everything I
got this one which is cool cuz Ali likes
arrows and then there's this one that's
kind of cool because that likes riding
bikes but I went for this one because I
thought it was just unique because
literally just a heart so I was able to
write something in there and it's I just
think this one is the coolest one you
know there's all those ordinary cards
that are just flat and you open them up
and then you close them you write out
that's all it is
I think she's gonna be really surprised
I mean we're not ordinary people and
this is not an ordinary card so I
figured that kind of made sense say
thank you so much the hallmark signature
for not only sponsoring today's video
but sending me more of these so now I'm
set for years to come I got this year's
and I get the next couple years set so
thank you so much hallmark signature and
I encourage all you guys check out the
link down to description below
find a store nearest you so you can get
your own ok so now I'm gonna go pick up
Ali before she dig is this all out and
ruins everything I accomplished a little
over 3 miles I am now waiting for
Charles to come pick me up
but I must say for being stuck in a spot
while waiting for him this is not a bad
view and look there's a pirate ship off
in the distance guys close
while you who think about her keep your
clothes leave them close clamp them keep
them clamp I would have already done
that over guys cuz I'm not gonna be here

go yeah
since I'll be gone on Valentine's Day I
wanted to get something cool for you

wanted to give you something I think

there and there's even more in the back
I couldn't fit them all in there
so anything get you a card I'm sorry

the big question today early

I'm three yeah I'm three okay I was just
saying that you're just hanging out
she's hanging out with the dudes
Molly we don't even know where she went
where's Marley weird Marley go didn't
give a crap
Frankie's got one ball on the seat Oh
your palms are sweaty our goal tonight
is to get three balls in this couch as a
team we're playing three player mothers
now if it doesn't happen I will just
play some beautiful drone footage I
guess no if it does happen I will still
play the beautiful drone footage so it's
a win-win
but if we get on the balls on the couch
it'd win the outside thing there's
nothing you can do right Frankie we need
rail bands wrong tagging well apparently
between the three of us we can't seem to
make this happen so we might call Ali
Ali you need to play pinball and help us
could be soft you know the other body
otherwise it's cheating
major key alert did you screw up again
right down the middle
oh no sidebar Bert what happened it went
down there you just want to say I lost
we had to recruit a fourth the weakest
we compete we keep sucking at this we
had to recruit a fourth and Ali came in
Master Eddie my gang I love you got one
on there okay come on we got this step
two we've been doing this for a good
hour
I just want to see you why'd you tell us
it's literally a fella said every time
down the center every time I made a
mistake of telling about the crazy balls
really now we're gonna have now just
determine is this kooky happening I
might need to show you that footage
oh we got one ball on the couch Anna
gave up that's your turn right now we're
not even playing for score we're playing
as a team just to get the balls on the
couch that's all we're doing I don't
think we've been paying attention to the
score I think that's the only thing
we're worried about right now
watch it happens anti-climatic this is
two balls oh come on there you go yes
all right we got you on there we have
one more to go
no no we're all getting really good at
this now that's how close we were we're
giving ourselves one last chance at this
if it doesn't happen on this one right
here this is not gonna happen
and as our starting frankly okay this is
watch a pro not my fault my fault that
way I didn't do that
that was not my fault cool that's a wrap
thanks Charles for ruin it for all of us
easy thank you yeah
what was that what was that all right I
like we're gonna do one more I was gonna
say thank you did awesome you got one of
the balls on there which is actually
kind of good this actually is good huh
wrong team we don't care about our score
we just want to lose yes I'm just trying
to talk please son I just want balls
right Frankie needs two balls give me
