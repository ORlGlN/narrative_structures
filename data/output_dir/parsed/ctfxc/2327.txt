I'm here right now I could literally do
anything she wanted to make an
announcement that she was here to you
rocking out somehow like move it around
hit the reflection and she's like a
buddy of mine posted this on I think was
like goop our Google+ or something
yesterday and I haven't showed Ally yet
this is the best buy this is the best
buy ad from 1996
it's a prepared I'm going to show you
guys screens as I'm talking about it all
right the first one you ready for this
okay so you see that that's not that's
not that okay now here's the game's Man
X are you serious well Warcraft to see
your antivirus 2.0 okay
I know I know it's crazy okay I'm not
done all right ready watch this time it
gets better because re first see 311 CV
so I bet Lee Beck's odelay okay the
Macarena is this crazy like okay okay
it's gonna get crazier look at the cell
phone
isn't it crazy a beeper there's a beeper
down there you see the beeper there's a
beeper okay I know this is insane okay
gets better gets away better look the
computers
there's an old Mac down there that's 96
you see that are you guys have your
brains exploding right now the best the
best thing was remember when the the CDs
when they had Walkman has been they did
portable CDs and then they were like oh
no they're always skipping when you want
to walk then the anti skip feature
German SS computer kill the batteries oh
this is old-school vlogging actually put
a VHS in - yeah right there and there's
a V a VCR I know a lot of you guys
around oh those are film cameras they
are I just wanted to know the best one
force gun oh and these are all beat
these are VHS tapes so I just wanted I
wanted to show you guys this because I
thought was fascinating 96 if that
wasn't that long ago or six years old
it was it is kind of a long sense but if
you like thinking of the grand scheme of
history and technology and stuff like
that it's not very that it's that long
but the main point I wanted to show you
guys if you weren't following me on
Google+ yet by the way Google+ is open
now it's not it's not invite only so if
you want one it's free you can go sign
up but I posted on it yesterday and the
thing that the point I wanted to make
was even like 15 years ago right
technology was the same price those
those Mac computers are the same price
the Mac computers are now technology
doesn't really go up or down because
like stays the same
I guess Ali was saying like you know
like when it first comes out of good
there's a huge spike but then it levels
out I think it's just gonna fascinating
even 15 years ago those computers were
like $2,000 I just wanted to see what I
tell me in the comments guys tell me the
comments one if your brain exploded okay
and two if you were even alive to see
that that add if you're if you weren't
even born yet this doesn't make any
sense but if you're like older your
brain probably exploded so you were
probably number one I don't know I just
thought it was kind of kind of fun
little fact to show you guys
are you meditating cuz I just stopped
you're meditating okay that's a gating
you have to be like oh why well you
can't have music it's a distraction
have you ever noticed that Zooey and
Marley are like yin and yang okay I
don't know if you're Yin or yang but
you're kind of a pain in the butt
sometimes second I do the Internet
all right guys al is meditating I'm
gonna go to bed
edit you guys and I think I think we
might be playing a show soon I'm not
really sure it might be a fly date as
soon as I know I will promise I'll let
you guys know as soon as I know I'll let
you guys know so if you're in the area
you guys can come and you can just like
yell the lyrics in my face you can just
get right in front of me when I'm
playing bass you'd be like those are
lyrics you guys just yell them
I want the CTFxC yelling lyrics at me on
stage I think it'd be fun I'll let you
guys know I'm gonna go to bed kind of
relax
kind of disturb Ally's meditation but I
really want to watch Futurama I think
it's okay right yes tomorrow goodnight
