or motel where TV so back in the day you
see these little things burn League
ladders right that's how they changed
the bulbs and there was no safety
harness so crazy see last time I was
here it was during the night so it's
hard to see everything now I get to see
everything a little bit more jackpot

this bright after all the Sun they've
experienced that's the charge our island
skull right there so what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to try to get on Google
Maps and show you so this is Google Maps

the most photographed sign here I'm
telling you guys if you can come here to
the bump neon boneyard young museum

the daytime so we just got done with the
Dion museum which is probably one of my
favorite things to do

to meet up with everybody at the Nirvana
