hey guys time to go to DC ready for
playlist
newspapers every time we fly in there
that's no reason to be nervous you are
just really beautiful no real big deal
what it's okay you don't have to worry
about I think it's that perfect record
is a machine that has made
we're cool though
yeah I get to see that falling out for
break
I stand near you
it'll break someone good
it didn't and I got a cool gimbal s
actually not even a gimbal just a
panning shot I should do that one day
just like to set that on there just see
where the camera hands up you know
what's kind of sad about this corner is
very familiar we're in the T terminal
and I feel like there's photos of trav
passed out in this corner actually
almost identical what you're doing no
it's this corner because it's between t2
and t3 that's the only reason why I know
but window you want to out you like our
private jet
primo expense bed it is kind of
something's about it's like some what
gear you mean on the plane by ourselves
i watch this do you know what this was
just
that took me here is the real
a little fishing
we're one plane and I want to have
sleep sounds awesome we're gonna get
there super early so place well first
we're dealing Wednesday actually there
okay well sleep is probably not in the
cards but it does feel like I'm dead
right now
it's actually kind of cool Ellie and I
not only had our private jet
well we shared it with Scarlett
Johansson yeah yeah our private jet kind
of got a little cluttered because we
decided that you know it'd be a little
selfish and a waste of fuel so we
invited 150 other people to come to DC
with us but this plant attendant like no
joke I was walking on the plane I did
one of these double takes
knocking dead-on ringer I wouldn't creep
you to take a photo put it like if you
go to a Comic Con like that's the type
of person so we saw her doppelganger
it was nuts
oh thank god you had that tape on the
bottom we know it's ours
no I was fast
all right now we got to go find friends
go let's go oh where he is was the text
message today the driver will be out
there buried for him with a pink
playlistlive magnet Franco Franco Franco
that's funny though you just call Franco
Franco from now on Franco what's Polanco
and you had a roadie our rank go no not
Franco
Franco
where's mr. Franco well it's kind of
cold to Ali went to the bathroom and
asked me to get her a coffee and I wrote
it down exactly what she said the
autocorrect struck again grande nonfat a
caramel macho extra you know I like my
yeah you got it babe and yet you got
some extra right there
lately if you guys follow me on Twitter
or Instagram or any of that stuff you
probably know I am the king of
autocorrect misspellings I know how to
spell but every time I spell what it is
I don't proofread so I just go and I'm
assuming everything is fine but you guys
are the first ones to point it out and
it's funny and I own it
I'm just gonna own it from now on I need
the goofy there's playlist there's
Franco so we just got dropped off in the
random alley all the funky doors that's
one thing I do like about playlists is
they really go all out with like like
making sure things make sense they have
like this I think there's gonna be tape
and arrows like all this stuff just
makes things so much easier I remember
this is where like Roman Jay and I were
on those hoverboards remember that yeah
we did oh my god that was so long ago
follow the line man pivot nope you
didn't follow it you're not following it
you didn't pivot when you should pivot
get on this line we talked about this
like every time I wonder who is like in
charge of doing this I don't know it's
probably Reena or Ilene or somebody
nobody appreciates the awesomeness of it
but I certainly do
Ellie and I are gonna try to like find
something I did not plan for it to be
this cold
look we could ride a bike who did though
you brought a jacket I know but I didn't
think it would actually be cold
really service ones or whistles are safe
don't because they have to carry so much
stuff so hot they're around it's crazy
yeah I think he's just blankly staring
off into who's over here I don't know
who that is really she that tall
there's no way that's her is it there's
no way she with that call
bodyguard genuinely interested if she
was that tall I don't think that was her
though that was her
I think DC has the longest streetlights
or walk science was like 60 seconds
somewhere works like 90 seconds honestly
do you guys know any other place that
has a longer like walk sign other than
67 well over 60 seconds
I'll arson with speed limit on the
interstate 80 and usually it's 70 it was
uncomfortable it's like so yo cuz you
always be like 10 over so like 70 I was
in the RV and I was going like 65 and
I'm like push good place to have the
space people last time it's so fun once
you get a quick little bite before we
started down hunger so Ali got me this
sweater by the way my birthday and I've
been wearing it for
ten minutes and I already got potato
salad on but the snazzy sweater wants to
get the potato salad out so this is with
the exact spot where all that chaos

friendship right there
