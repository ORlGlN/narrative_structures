Frankie we'll take it good morning guys
so we are in Scranton Pennsylvania if
you guys didn't tell by the intro I have
to do that every time we're here and
Chris and I are going on a little
adventure and we're trying to get out of
here and this freaking packed up
so where's dunder dunder mifflin yeah as
a paper company is that around here I
know the book company but there's no
Dunder Mifflin I think you meant I take
care every time I go to Scranton got
asked where the paper company is nobody
knows where Dunder Mifflin dad are they
hearing so much but it's just so
annoying lately our Walmart stops again
I get five or four in the morning
can't wait nothing but I'm literally out
sleeping lately by 11 or 12 yeah I've
been on an amazing sleep schedule
so Chris and I decided to dopey little
proaction follow this the tragical of
this
this is what I need should always know
where you're going because we've got
we're still in Scranton and Chris and I
have been here for a like maybe 45
minutes just waiting for an uber and
like nothing here I think in the middle
of nowhere
and we're just sitting here with our
thumbs up their ass the only way to
describe it right now guys do you get a
lot of people asking where the paper
company the Dunder Mifflin paper company
is you don't get that a lot
you've seen the office yeah this
basement Scranton oh yeah yeah yeah
I just didn't know I always like to ask
like I would like to go to the paper
company so you only knew about that well
you knew about it now watch the show oh
and I'm getting massaged right now it's
really intense
where's the gun neck back
look who I'm with right now Melissa's
getting a pedicure and I'm gonna get a
manicure in a hot second I never used
this was not sure sorry this is I know
weird so I'm kidding at this house right
now while I'm waiting to get my nails
done and you know what I could get used
to these real nice real real nice that's
a hot massage there that's how you bring
all the boys to the yard so we can get
my nails done with Melissa and it was so
much fun
it was like it was nice it's just true
bonding day so we really really enjoyed
that now I have to actually go and get
these those medication I gotta pick that
up because I don't know if I ever told
you guys diesel is on meds cuz he is
crazy and sighs it sounds he's got I
don't say exactly cuz it's not true but
he he tends to get so excited work so
loud that my vets are afraid that he may
potentially give himself a heart attack
so it gets really really anxious so I
had to put him on some medication that
he has to take every single day along
with medication for his allergies and
things of that sort so I have to go pick
that up now and then I'm not really sure
what I'm gonna do it's like 6 o'clock so
I feel like I'm in good shape right now

actually trying to do all my things put
it all where I see this random bag and I
open it and this is what's in it just

15 or 16 bucks and we don't play for
like another three hours since I'm the
only one I did get tattooed on the store
I'm really the only one I can actually
go because you know they get in fact it
the scooter died halfway up the hill
when I was scooting around just a few
minutes ago coming back I remembered a
vivid memory specifically right here on
this mountain I don't know if you guys
remember that one time with Travis
really had to go to the bathroom like
don't you do it if you just put a bag in
the toilet and try to throw it up there
and it just started rolling back down
and to this day just remember that Hill
rolling down with a pile of Travis's
poop
so I basically said fuck it and then
once and waterslides today
situate or met the guys over at a water
park there now push it in dammit
what's wrong
tell me all the good stuff
this was great I gotta do it again
oh that's not good when I see something
