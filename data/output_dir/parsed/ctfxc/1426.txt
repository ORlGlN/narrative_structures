get it hello everyone this isn't my car
so I just had to take in my regular my
regular car my my actual car because
there was a recall notice on the back or
something there's something to do with
the powder brakes not brake failure but
there was just something like a power
brake assist there was a recall on it
for my car so I had to bring it in and
they gave me a loaner and I probably
shouldn't even be vlogging because I'm
like super nervous to be driving it I've
got a bad driver but I just you know I'm
just nervous to be in a car that's not
mine
like when I Drive friends cars or
anything I much always like decisions
I'm gonna stop filming ok that's a good
idea Mona I'm gonna put that camera down
I'm gonna put it down anyway wish me
luck I gotta go to the doctor that's why
this face is on my face I have a face in
my face you have a face on your face
yeah though just a routine check up with
the doctor
what's this doctor called neurologist I
always forgets the guy who gives me all
the medic medication keep him from
having seizures
epileptologist says flash sees all
ageist
I don't know if that's a thing is the
guy basically keeping me from having
seizures so he's a really nice guy
here's something I want address you know
when you hit go to the haircut place aka
the salon and you leave and you like
really like the hair then you go home
you shower and you try to recreate it
and then you come out with this you can
never recreate what happens in the salon
I can't blow dry it there's a spring
training going on oh the Orioles versus
arrays we should go back to my tradition
of messing with stuff it's like Romeo
and Juliet to be or not to be where
there is no you know let me stop it
this call I thought was Macbeth though
Hamlet is to be or not to be to be or
not to be whether his nobilis for the
slings of a net the slings and arrows of
something arrows maybe or to fight them
