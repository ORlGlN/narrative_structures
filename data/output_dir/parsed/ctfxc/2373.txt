illegal again what is your problem I'm
talking to a dog Oh before I forget
actually when I was I was meaning to ask
you guys this earlier when I was out
there and fed up for VidCon I was
talking to Phil suggested possibly doing
like a CTFxC Movie Club since I'm always
watching movies specifically I'm always
watching really bad movies like
Sharktopus or Megatron verse crocosaurus
and Giganta Mothra and all those really
bad horror movies our monster movies on
top of all the other movies and I was
actually thinking about it and I was
like that sounds like a really fun idea
one I'm always watching movies and -
yeah I'm sure you guys are all watching
movies so why don't we make something
and we can watch movies together okay so
if we were to do this in the comments
tell me at least five or six movies that
we should start off with and I feel like
maybe once or twice a week Oh
she's rolling in mud
she's rolling in mud yeah that would be
good for a wound no yes so in the
comments tell me like five movies we
should kick off the CTFxC movie club and
how often do you guys think we should do
it like once a week twice a week because
I mean you guys know I'm always watching
movies maybe we will move it on to the
trippy Channel or something after a
while but yeah I just wanted to run it
by you and see what you thought I
thought it'd be kind of fun
CTFxC movie club yeah Renee we gotta
think of something better than just
CTFxC movie club Oh see if we can make
it happen and you guys know a legitimate
excuse to watch movies uh yeah sign me
up and my most valley girl boys possible
