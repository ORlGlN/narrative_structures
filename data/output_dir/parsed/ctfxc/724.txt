okay they honestly like they're able to
like sleep and travel but here's the
cool thing I want to show you guys a
couple years ago when we played in
Melbourne on the shit I'm stuck in here
god damn it
what we're saying is that
I think I figured out I think it's been
Pat I think that's the fucking piece of
shit every time I take it I get all
fucking weird
talks to my vision talks to my ballots
that's with everything so if you were at
Melbourne I couldn't say hi I'm so
fucking sorry I am so sorry
I am so sorry hopefully I'll meet you
guys some around I can't I can't go I
can't I'm just losing my fucking mind
and like Ali said I think what it is is
the unsureness about being on chemo I'm
really sorry
if this brings it down because last
couple videos have been amazing that's
all the bays have been fucking amazing I
do I think it's I think it's just sleep
obviously and I think it's just fuck it
I'm gonna push through it
and I gotta gotta push through it
because so many people I relied
let me in the show it's not just me it's
like four or five other guys so that's
what really stresses me out that
stresses because I love playing music
and there's not one thing in this world
that honestly wouldn't want to do but I
gotta push through it
I thought the worse I got this
fuck that bug okay that's the worst
thing that's happened to me so far so
