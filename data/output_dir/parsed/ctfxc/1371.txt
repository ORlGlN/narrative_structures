because cuz the last trip from the
airplane the guy made me take my belt
off and I was so rushed because I'm
already remember you were there I just
ripped my belt off because he told me I
had to take it off and I just like
walked through like this I didn't put it
on the stupid thing I literally walked
through but I ended up hold on victory
this is fascinating I know this is
fascinating destroyed it
it's my pants fall down constantly so
most is gonna take me to get a belt
domestic life that is awesome the simple
things in life wonderful again

I'm out good okay no and since I feel
like I haven't got to really just talk
to you guys in a long time because I've
been kind going all over the place and
just kind of update you with what's on
my mind just trying to stay focused just
trying to stay happy just trying to stay
positive but yeah bottom line there's
been a lot of changes and a lot of
adjustments barley don't roll net that
never changes that will never change
I'm trying to stay very very positive
very happy as I possibly can but just
keep living life you know just having
fun
basically what are you eating eating the
gross weeds of course cow just like a
damn goat but what was I talking about
but yeah I just felt like I haven't had
a little conversation with you guys
starting at a burp and I just wanted to
let you guys know what's going on my
head the situation's is that's occurring
in my life right now the only option
that I have is to stay happy and stay
positive and just keep walking forward
cuz I feel like a lot of people make
that mistake when they hit something sad
or depressing
they forget to live life that's pretty
much what I've been trying to do is just
you know hang out with my sister she's
been watching me while I was chemo
because I can't be by myself I wanted to
say thank you guys for still supporting
the CTF

always gonna be a couple of people which
I want to say they could just basically
go off you know this is off and that
smells like bugs break and what's been
amazing is getting back on the road and
meeting you guys in person and just
talking with you guys in person you guys
are actually smarter than people I think
I want to give the internet credit like
I said there's always a couple assholes
but you know I mean for every at one
asshole there's a 200 awesome people
like I said before the only thing
consistent in life has changed change
