today Ali and I just kind of ran away
from the toy buster a little bit I
really was craving the beach in this
sunshine just missing Florida but since
we're on literally the other side of the
coast this was the closest we can go so
went to the boardwalk just kind of
walking along the beach enjoying the
sand and joined the Sun for once because
tomorrow we're in Vegas actually we had
a lot of fun tomorrow yeah actually it's
gonna be a I think of 82 degrees
I want to Florida's it'd be like though
I know it's super touristy down here you
guys are probably why you wanted the
tourist section it's because of this
it's mainly because of the situation
just the sand and the Sun and that dog
is going under to Australia look it's a
spectacle thing I got a pair that's the
spectacles place on Venice Beach Charles
so Dani has been wanting one of these
forever we just saw happen

think said black I know there's so much
cool air char and I had an awesome day
