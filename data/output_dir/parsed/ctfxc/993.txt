good morning Internet we were at the
airport in the Virginia
so this is one thing that kind of sucks
about moving we look at the safe on its
head it every time we have failed to
even the airport so I have kind of
passed on the tradition to Danny so I
think he's saying by his head for me
right now
oh hi the tag I should say good old
haven't seen this airport in a while
she's untied no time Melissa and Phil
had a kickball game last night down in
Sarasota so they brought down some boxes
some of the kitchen stuff the turn I
hadn't actually packed up yet and his
mom did it was really nice his mom
packed it up for us so they brought that
down
I packed and put all that away which
believe it or not you would never expect
like spices and extracts and sugar and
all that stuff you would never think
that that would be a time-consuming
process it is I still have no idea what
I'm doing but you know what I'm doing
it's a very best of my ability
and I like it so right now what I'm
doing is to kind of like relieve some
stress up a char
I don't know I I'm exciting about it
though new camera I'm completely not
prepared for anything I didn't have
shoes so my sister and Phil bought shoes
Danny was gonna bring some over for me I
don't have headphones I just feel
completely completely out of it and now
