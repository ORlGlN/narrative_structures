be Marley she hasn't even acknowledged
other than the balloon she doesn't like
focus mode right now
music you know big strong man's right
here could help yeah yeah big strong man
since I haven't really been able to cook
much in our new place
I decided oh is this yeah you found it
right okay I don't know if you guys have
ever had Panera Bread there's a dish
called front ticket chicken it's like a
panini uh what's a panini I want to see
if I can make it I'm just gonna do this
real random recipe and see if I can make
a homemade four and take a chicken
I have faith do you think I can do it I
could do this right one but all right
got my chicken and now I'm working on
the sauce and mind you it looks freakin
disgusting
I know it's basically managed that's why
I went with the the vegenaise
like healthier version because the
strain of mana is that globbing of it
law like it says please excuse me can I
please have a triple bypass as well Wow
okay not paying attention I literally
almost put pepper in the refrigerator no
big deal we got the chicken we got the
disgusting-looking sauce we got some red
peppers Oh purple are those purple or
red purple red I don't know onions
tomatoes and then we got Zoey doing
cleanup Thank You Zoey and we're gonna
add a little bit of hot sauce
Oh gotta take the top off and I'm just a
little bit because it comes out a lot
any minute
look that's probably way too much and
the final product looks pretty pretty
close pretty identical looks just like
it doesn't it eat it no no
it's literally the most difficult
sandwich I've ever made in my entire
life it's spicy the world's most
difficult sandwich and was time
consuming so do you got there okay I
don't know if you guys ever done it's
kind of morbid really if you think about
it what you're doing is you're like
ripping what bone is that is that the
bone behind the neck the chest bone so
that'd be like me like taking your
sternum and having I don't know but it's
pretty we're all dumb I don't know I
thought like by the spine by the neck
that's what I thought it was to eat it
wotcher
yep nope
so I don't know if you guys have ever
done this you take the wishbone you let
it dry out and then you pull it and then
you make a wish you know what we should
do we should both wish for the exact
same thing no no flip at the right side
okay I need to be able to see this what
are you doing over there Alec Baldwin
playing Words Words With Friends no I
want no no no used to do that my sister
for the years she'd always hold at the
bottom I'd always do this and I'd win
every single time
you have to hold it rare
okay okay one two oh I win I don't know
I'm not to be touching this thing
anymore
well is it time to go to bed so we don't
get too close to our but you'll get
worms on your nose
they're really passed out crying come on
