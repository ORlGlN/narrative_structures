kicking my butt rock-and-roll it's
actually might be too extreme but how do
you know if you have food poisoning
I've been poisoned by food I'm literally
eating chemo which is poison but food is
more poisonous to me it's kind of weird
at the computer this is kind of what
happens when you're on a tour bus and
you don't have any spoons for unknown
reasons but no idea why we have no
plastic spoons all we have a Forks and I
want cereal

Scott Back to the Future 3 is on I don't
want to sort of fight the words back to
the future we had this all the time what
is your favorite back to the future I'm
gonna go on record number two is the
best one ever made except my me number
one is pretty awesome as the original
but number two for being a sequel is
badass number three is this is so
beautiful quiet
right on the water and everything so
nerdy so stupidly I love it I guess
that's what the barbecue is the thing
I'm gonna walk back in the future this
is kind of a random question I don't
tell if I actually asked this in a blog
when you walk past somebody and you
don't say anything do you go like head
up or do all head down or do you just do
something else like give you your eyes
I've noticed that I kind of do this I do
that with my eyes
all right go like that there's somebody
said that fish's been off when you do
something like that and they just walk
past oh they don't even look at you it's
like a stupid thing I know anyway guys
I'm sorry if I've been a little bit out
of it today

planning to chill wink too early but
