hey good morning everyone so do remember
like what was 16 months a year ago when
we like pre-ordered the iPhone 4
together remember that and then I kept
like reloading the page over and over
and over again
and it was like getting hacked or
something I don't know guess what it's
happening again
dun dun
now seriously I'm getting that kind of
deja vu a year and a half later right
nerd moment I know I'm embarrassed I'm
embarrassed I'm up this early
okay I'm usually this stupid thing is a
light I can't
they're right - I'll see you in a couple
hours I'm not waiting it'll play it'll
work hey no fighting no fighting
hey no biting yourself your hair finally
grew back don't take it away again
your own best sticker ever some cool
t-shirt okay I'll try
no do one more coffee
yeah it stinks it's kind of funny on
that face it's kind of funny cuz I
remember trying my mom's coffee and then
the first time I ever had like beer I
thought it was disgusting like coffee
beer and then we get older and hot sauce
I hated everything like that and
broccoli I hated a lot of stuff I didn't
know but when you get older it just
changes like for some reason I don't
know why the taste of coffee tastes good
I guess if it's like when you're a kid
you just have either like you have sugar
or syrup sugar and like just think of
all the kid candies you know a that
that's what you're you're cute
accustomed to accuse them you accused
him to that and then you drink coffee
it's like that but now I like it when
you have more taste fire while your
taste no general do you have more than
more since it is the more sensitive yeah
it's why hot sauce when you're younger
it's like you're very sensitive and then
when you're colder like me I just put it
on like a spoon I just drink it and a
like it's really disgusting yeah I
really do like on some have take a
second and just think of things that you
used to hate like you tell us in the
comments think of some things that you
used to hate and now you absolutely love
you think of anything halfway
broccoli hated it when I was a kid
what about tomatoes yep
yeah I like tomatoes she had she's so
weird she hates raw tomatoes like if the
tomato juice gets anywhere on her pizza
or something but she'll eat spaghetti
sauce things like that in pizza sauce
weird that I feel like I need like a
corncob pipe right now what do you think
