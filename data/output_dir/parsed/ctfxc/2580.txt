go go go go go go process process for
the fourth time today's being really
annoying YouTube is I don't know what's
going on with YouTube I've been trying
to upload this video everyone asking why
the video was uploaded really late
yesterday actually I started at around
12:30
maybe I'll 12:15 and South three almost
four and it just keeps getting stuck
right here like it's like one of those
things where I shouldn't I can't really
complain because it's free and all that
stuff but at the same time it is it's an
inconvenience I guess so I don't know
maybe we'll chase the squirrel
seems to work for Marley well the video
is still having problems but Ali dragged
me outside because I need to get some
get some distressing because that it's
so annoying but look I found I was um I
was cleaning off my desk
gave me some time and I found some stink
bombs really oh I should've waited I
should have done it to Ali when she
wasn't looking but when I was younger I
actually had a stink bomb that's what it
is
like it's like ammonia or something
we're taking this little little
container vile whatever and I used to
hate my music teacher so much she was so
mean I broke it off in his class and
once and they had to evacuate the class
so that was my rambunctious stage it was
I think that was like 40 that was fourth
grade it was fourth grade got him back
alright look at this look at the back of
this looks so scared not a toy
keep out of reach of children but if you
turn it around looks very designated for
kids doesn't it I think it's a goat like
a plexiglass or something but it looks
like the top part I see what I did is I
just threw it in the classroom I went
like that and stomped on it Oh stick
will work
really all right grandma oh god smell it
over there oh there's hands down the
smelliest thing I've ever smug I don't
smell any more
that is grossest thing I've ever smelled
my life don't worry for those concern
there's all the glass throwing it away
oh my gosh there's the smelly thing what
is she doing the stinky part no it's
cleaned

the horse oh you say it still smells
like this smells awful here you smell
and somebody always smells okay you know
what it smells like it smells like a
combination of poop
rotten eggs rotten deli meat and sweat I
think that's pretty much the the the the
contributing factors of that smell

think it smells like the smelliest fart
that you've ever farted look at your
face are you still smelling it smell it

side she's pretty smart she's like kind
of caring she doesn't even care that
much I'll go all the sunrays oh cool the
Sun going through the trees this is
cooler than a lens flare baby acorns

always poops in like sensors her own but
