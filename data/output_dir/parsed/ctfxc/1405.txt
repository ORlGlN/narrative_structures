by Priscilla you're gonna taco bus thank
you it's been ages since I've been here
like a really long time we used to come
here a lot when Andrew and Rachel think
last time we were here we actually saw a
couple of rats but you know don't worry
don't worry about it don't worry about
it
they have favored at traps I think now
but they were outside not inside
Yuki got our Chavo which may be think of
Spain
remember me so I'm trying to get some
rest before the show I think what it is
is my bodies I use is freakin cold
weather so let's just do this from now
on for the rest of tour if you guys are
waiting we want to say hi just get your
camera ready on FaceTime load and just
get whatever you want signed and I'll
just blast through it so that way you
take photos with everyone and you guys
can get warm and I can get one that way
can team effort right brick three two
one these mice
alright guys let's see if you can hear
what I brought home about 20 minutes ago
hear that that's a puppy here's the
story with this puppy there he is
I've been calling Chico because he's a
little boy puppy and he's kind of spaz
and that just came to mind when I first
saw him so this is Chico for now sorry
but my hair and everything's gonna mess
I just got out of the shower we found
him on the side of the road on Fowler
tied up to like a maintenance pole just
turned by himself no note no collar no
tags nothing it just sucks I don't know
what happened I'm hoping that I'll hear
from someone that they're missing a dog
but it was a pretty deliberate dump so
yeah I don't really know what to do I
think I'm just going to take him to my
vet tomorrow morning and have him check
him out kind of get him a clean bill of
health because I want to make sure he's
taken care of I want them to do some
blood work check for worms that kind of
thing so we can get him started on
heartworm pills if he needs it or you
know any kind of vaccinations that he
might be needing I want to make sure
he's up to date with all that stuff
there are a lot of options you know for
stuff like this guy's like no-kill
shelters places like that where they
won't be put down there are tons of
places that rehabilitate dogs and raise
them to be adopted back out into other
homes so just I would encourage you if
you ever run into a situation where you
feel like you can't handle your animal
try to find someone who can handle it
for you rather than just leaving it
because that's just kind of sucky and
again I don't know the full
circumstances but it's just a sucky
situation to put in so Zoey and Marley
are going to stay the night at my
parents house tonight
because I don't know really what his
situation is what kind of is going on
with him health-wise so I don't want you
know I don't know if he's been
socialized with other dogs I don't know
what the situation is um sorry I just
like tripped over a dog toy I just want
to make sure that he wasn't threatened
and it's only Marley weren't threatened
so they might meet each other someday
just not right now
my Chico we're gonna get you taken care
of you should keep good boy
