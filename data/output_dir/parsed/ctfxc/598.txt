they were due
good morning Internet so we're at the
bus
Fixit shop was in and breaking down but
their snitches
get a little tune-up we've put a
selection pretty badly
that they won't walk around
so I say good morning I'll stay hold on
this is actually the venue like right
here I remember was raining where our
good friends Brian and Kelly took my
all-time favorite photo
that's been my favorite photo of all
time and I remember like it's like I
tell you every single day these scores
every day like a new memory just kind of
pops up just because
it's the familiarity you tell try to get
rid of the stupid ten cop tan right now
as much as I possibly can so these guys
are so much happier today and feeling so
much better especially that one he's
getting better slowly working on some
new ear stuff for him so that hopefully
you know we can figure out a really
strong long lasting solution for the
ears but she's doing doing better you're
just looking at me really weird right
now
and so are you
frig welcome my fridge
welcome my table yeah I can't find my
frickin camera I pulled it Danny
you pulled the Charles Charles no that's
Danny's dramatic zoom that it does have
a fuzzy thing I didn't but has a fuzzy
thing it was of course right under here
oh okay Danny we're okay you're done
get in there though email okay there's a
new little mattress pad now it takes
away even more room now I have this
let's try this out
oh my voice is so loud it's bouncing up
right here
that's a let's hear your glasses we
measure with the glasses you're sorry
one and a half glasses Duncan how many
glasses are you do it to your chest cuz
you're lower oh you're two and a half so
you lost a glass the Sun is hitting me
hard today
guess we need a funny story so when I
was eighth grade I had a girlfriend
really loved less than Jacob and we've
just watched her there and I had her CD
was a hello Rock view I think and when
we broke up she wanted it back and I
didn't give it back and because of that
I learned a couple of the bass lines on
the couple of the albums and I'm not
condoning stealing of the situation
I don't know if I'd be so into bass had
I not done that kind of weird right
eighth grade so if I ever see her again
I owe her a CD that's a weird story
right random it's random when you kind
of I call it daisy chaining like when
you go back to like an instance to your
life and I think about like this not
happened this wouldn't have happened and
then that wouldn't have happened then
this wouldn't have happened
and it just keeps like daisy chaining
like do that every once in a while it'll
blow your mind on how things work now
I'm playing on the same stage as them
how freaking cool is that so I guess if
I ever see her again or she's watching
this videos without it eighth grade I
owe you a CD and I will get you another
CD
because that's the least I could do for
getting me into play today
okay loan is inside writing up a
contract really quick and I decided to
come out here and check out this
beautiful view right now
clouds look crazy actually super super
crazy so check that out
one thing that I love about Florida
storms is that it does make the clouds
look pretty incredible beautiful
definitely a storms coming right there
breed dogs gonna be freaking out
it's a beautiful day though I'm sorry
about my like weird negativity yesterday
I wasn't trying to be like a grumpy Gus
I just wasn't a funk you know I was just
in a funk but then by the end of the day
I was getting a little bit better so I'm
glad that happens I never want one of my
days to like go in a negative manner and
then last the whole day it's just some
weights of a day lease of the day I'm
about to jump in there though no joke
Duncan's losing his mind you don't like
to shoot graveyards act like
the shoe rack amazing the little things

shoes 24 shoes at least
