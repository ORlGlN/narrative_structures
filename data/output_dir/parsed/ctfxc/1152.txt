Christmas present clothes smarten I did
it online hey Marley sending me to
voicemail you send me to voicemail
I'm going to kick you right in the butt
so the other day when I went to American
fries the golf cart plays go pick up my
my seat covers I was talking to your
owner
and he told me that once this thing's
out of warranty we can actually soup it
up so goes 30 or 40 bucks
so the second this thing goes out of
warranty I'm taking this thing in and it
becomes a speed demon I didn't know golf
carts could do that this is Harley on
stroke patrol at 20 miles an hour
make sure you see a mark tell me if you
see one sub dog get it cuz you're
actually a dog I'm so clever
we should race totally race how can
nobody not smile with two dogs in the
golf cart I feel like that's the epitome
of somebody having this fort you have to
automatically smile if you see two cute
dogs and a golf cart sitting like this
is chilling it's like an automatic
doesn't matter what day you're having
you have to smile it the law I'm making
it a lot you guys never see two dogs or
one dog in a golf cart just chilling
like this then you don't smile if
somebody has to smack you like Travis
says it's not out of violence it's
motivation attack
