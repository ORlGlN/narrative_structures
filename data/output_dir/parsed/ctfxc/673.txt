so as we tell another day of flying
today we're playing a show Virginia
tomorrow we'll playing a show somewhere
in New York and we're at my favorite
place in the world
Lana I've been noticing more and more
that when I vlog in the airport people
kind of start looking at me a little bit
more like funny I get the strangest
coolest funniest looks like one after
the show I think I had Monday off and
then Alan I get ready I could choose
here Wednesday we fly for her Tribeca
Film Festival and then I come home for
two days again and then we don't know
one day and then we head over to
playlist no flying thank God
see you guys later
we'll be back behave behave behave
otherwise and Katie is gonna throw down
the fist of doom she's not gonna punch
the dog fix where she won't I was gonna
go like this but then this just came out
I was gonna say the wrath of Thor but I
don't know if that's like a proper like
this yes so Tom they have a so I don't
know Sam turns later bring the hammer
down yeah I'm terrible there with all my
movie uh terminology and quotes I'm
terrible I can put a movie for my life
except for probably the labyrinth
pingu's okay will the ladder you remind
me of the babe what babe the babe with
the power what power the power of Voodoo
who do you do what for mom you're the
babe some my baby
on the 19th really to go out of town to
go to New York for the vlog you mentoree
premiere which is going to be very very
exciting I know Charles is super
overwhelmed nervous ready for the street
sings I know they have been working on
this for a really really long time
it was really cool to be able to see it
before it was out and to see everything
that he went through before I was around
and to see Shea's life and to see other
vloggers their life and I think that
this is going to be such a cool
opportunity for everyone else to see
what it's like to actually be on YouTube
and to actually be a vlogger because it
is a lot it's a lot of work it's a lot
of stress it's terrifying you're putting
your life out there for everyone to
judge and to nitpick
so volume entry kind of opens up this
whole new world to I think people that
don't expect it to be the way that it is
so my golf cart has more space
it was so small kind of felt like a
private plane though where are my arms
tired
Brothers prototype I have really did it
right
Oh laughs something Connors at you
you're chasin devil
since why it's good to be on a small
plane I guess you have to run around too
much well we're all here mentally I
don't think we are left my heart which
is weird cuz we never went through that
that is weeks ago anyway we are in
Roanoke Virginia and we have a mile no a
hundred mile drive more like Roanoke
your nope ah no pays to have a massage
therapist on the family my sister is
giving my mom a massage because your
back hurts and Melissa and Tyson are on
their way over because we're gonna do
the podcast a little bit late for us to
do it but we wanted to make sure that we
got it out on Friday but I did want to
show you guys got my nails done all you
guys out there I'm sure you're so
excited about that even the girls out
there I'm sure you're so excited over
the fact that I got my nails done
what
mine
I got a Clark the Clark
is that gonna care he he wanted to give
it he's not letting us have fun with him
he's just giving us nothing
now the rules are not to use like that
yeah he doesn't give a what's the
shittiest Hornet like I would not get
out of the way of that throw bag
I'll ask him like bring it on for us
straight on he business these
are was way worse right now the car with
a little little yellow video red body
that my son has has a lot of work well
look who's here making himself real nice
and comfortable they're terrible
I would look at her sad I know I was
Melissa but I you look so comfortable
I'm kind of dull and I don't know if you
guys remember when this little thing
happened to his leg but it looks so much
better
dont you judge me I'm not judging you oh
my gosh this is like the start of a
Sarah McLachlan commercial that's what
Coley lives or the deli tray the deli
tray the tortilla chips and the cheese's
yeah we should get deli tray tattoos
we're the deli tray yeah look at this
diva
get nice you're not work out he did so
much work on it so the pinball machine
yeah guys had that pinball machine - got
a couple people from the school and they
explain something called foosball which
is like mud volleyball I guess I
expected
guess it wouldn't hurt if all looks
pretty damn cool good job team no idea
what you said oh wait like you know what
you guys just won right so try to figure
this whole thing out
very odd apparently what they were
saying is that they do this every
weekend during this whole festival thing
and it goes early in the morning and
they do it late at night and took the
whole tiered system a goal school does
an old college which by the way we're in
Farmville Virginia and there's like a
population of like 8,000 93 people good
so good for the team on that one I love
it it's very interesting that's unique
and never seen it before
yeah all my life from touring to fans
that this population of this place is
like 8,000 93 so it looks super freakin
small and I think the majority of it
actually go to the school I got one of
these things we try to light it on fire
I think it's what happens things
load those girls actually toss them told
us to do this so we're going to try it
right that's kind of cool when you put
in when you put in slow-mo it's gonna be
so long so that last one was pretty cool
so we decided to get a bunch more
keeping our tradition alive ability to
do some college shows place the
basketball we got some more people this
