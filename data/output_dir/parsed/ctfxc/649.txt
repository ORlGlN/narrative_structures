so I found
Alys completely Alli's toughing it out
right now I think she got the flu you
guys ever remove that cold I was
watching the blog
like that crashing and everything so
remember how yesterday is like I put um
like the screen where says almost lost
my face well apparently I did you can
see it I don't know if it scratch my
face yeah right there see it it's that
and this improved that right there
looking giving off such a tough guy I do
my own stop sounds like Tom Cruise now
yesterday yeah total blogging it's
pretty hazardous so he actually
officially made it to Tennessee
and remember things these chairs
are here I don't think we're actually
camping until tomorrow night be pretty
crappy today I think it's
and kind of see it off in the distance
the weather it's not looking too hot and
I don't think they want us out there
when it says that he refuses to sit with
me because there's no outlets here
he said he's too cool he's like Ali I
have electronics I have to sit where
there's an outlet I can't sit in a
rocking chair with you because
hmm for now you don't think I'm pretty
impressed with my ability to not throw
up right now
nice view I like this phew it's almost
as good as the view I just had not this
though you're an asshole there's some
really really beautiful artwork that
they have here
that's all pastels that's pretty amazing
actually I'm super impressed with that I
like that one I like the simplicity of
it just being like I think that's pretty
cool it's very lifelike
look you're standing in front of a
building
yeah
morality
regular economics out for you
the grandmas have to look like insurance
it was my girl behind like a whiner like
I was over there sitting him waiting for
my computer to upload the video and I
was just like kind of sitting and I
completely remembered how the airport is
the best place to listen to the dumbest
conversations if you just listen to
people on the phones or just talking to
each other you can do really listen you
can hear the dumbest conversations in
the world if somebody was listening to
Hal and I talk dumb conversation you
that won't go back there
it sounded almost like office space like
the TPS reports we got get the TPS
reports within by Thursday almost dead
on to the office space funny
welcome to Knoxville
okay so we're here in Knoxville and this
is Michael he's out here with ABC and
doing this whole thing with GMA this guy
is just like me he runs just like me so
we're driving we don't have anything to
do today we just drive and I see
NASCAR like go-karts and he's just like
you want to do it all right in the
comments right now who do you thinks
gonna win Michael
Ali or myself mind you Michael could be
this sneaky underdog because we just met
him so we're not really quite sure if
you might be a NASCAR driver this is
just kind of all ploy just to like so I
can drive like really fast Speedway we
want
closer
that's walking all right everyone Green
is gas red is spring
I almost missed that up I was trying to
be condescending and I almost messed
that up
like what you said back he just went to
a bachelor party and all the guys were
like jet fighter pilots in the law
I was pretty good at this
she the phone rule number one hair
tied back I've had gig of the green one
I think I got the kid one
Oh
he's coasted over there
now remind you I stopped wait for her
and she did away from me by accident
I've waited for all of you the records
show Alligood win this one should be
Mike one myself however let the record
show that we all stopped to like have a
fair start
she posted their dollars this is a
faster one I think that's possibly the
fastest one so much faster
battling around
that was been a promise was the guy who
knows what it's frickin doing that guy
in the back no not him
that doing a hat good at it good like he
 me or one of the one places you
can't go and expect them to not play
dirty they're good they're good at this
so even though Charles is a punk and
wiped me out I still feel like we beat
yeah yeah exactly yeah exactly
yeah at the old Hey yeah jokes all
around oh that was a good one though
whose cover I'll give it to you my dad
would definitely say that oh yeah there
you go
Oh King Kong just hanging out we're just
kind of discussing a second there's a
castle I thought this was gonna be very
calm very this
serene place where this place is popping
it's got a lot of places maybe once we
get into those things over there that's
where everything's will be calm and
awesome well there's the dinosaurs
no those are real the dancers were real
everything's real good

thinking of interesting this place is so
many that's five be the competitor over
there as seventeen and right there the
70 adventure which we have no idea what
that is please let me know how many
senses and dimensions there are you know
like one tears before I get that five
you lost me seven you're totally on as
you can see we did some serious camping
today in the hotel or no the hotel or
the airport so basically the reason why
is we're still waiting on people since
we're gonna be in the Ripley's book this
this year I forgot we had the business
cards for Ripley's so we can go in there
I think there's a haunted one which I'm
sure out oh my god oh my god

this place reminds me of International
Drive in Orlando so that a bit don't
lose your head get it cuz it all said
get it did she got it how did you get it
did you get it cuz he lost his head you
got and it's kind of funny look this is
what these ancient things are used for
now this is a trash can

there'd be a little more electricity
around
no I mean like so when true Charleston I
like fashion oh you're having pizza

thought you're gonna get a piece of
cheese spread so we come gap in to
Tennessee and we buy pizza thing I
