let's paint this beast ready ready okay
take a deep breath and hold on your
childhood
oh yeah hi breathe this seems way less
fun than what we did yesterday that was
looks good huh I understand why don't
you get it all right now
yeah yeah there you go
it's our first pumpkin no it's not a
first pumpkin my baby baby pumpkin when
you get one community baby ones for sale
and how are they gonna carve it no it's
just to represent them they expect the
idea you can put non-toxic paint on
their paws and they can put their pants
on them
we're gonna back away now I don't want
that one I want the albino one this is
the one I want
we're not gonna be able to put the pain
in here now she is she is obsessed via
carts but oh my god is broken this would
be the equivalent right there exactly
yep we need to get tape when you gotta
get some tape masking tape blue tape red
tape clear tape duct tape red duct tape
Gorilla Tape oh my god there's some
white options I just want a stupid paint
roller
this one says better that one says best
ally says this one's the best
that's all best me but what is better
than best there is nothing can you get
better but you can get better than the
best
but what if now you this is a better
best that does not exist the best is the
best I think there's a better best the
best can't always be the best because
something new will always come then that
will become the best and that will be
rank'd down to that so will it be better
than the best oh because that's
impossible it becomes the best and then
that one it's not so the old best is no
longer the best and the new best is now
better than the best my logic internet
solve this but when this is not the best
it and you know what I'll prove to you
$14.99 $9.99 why would better than the
best be cheaper than the best because
this was the older best and this is the
new best so this one is now better than
the best huh come on agree with me right
agree with me as here's the thing about
Ally she's a sucker for marketing she's
like oh it's yellow we should get this
one it must be better that one has more
yellow so you're drawn to it like a B if
this is better but this is best this one
doesn't say best so how
I give up I give up I give up
you're gonna help okay you carry this
okay you carry that can you carry it you
carry it
okay get it make it I'll you ass
so the winning color is the excitement
Simon's building that one we went with
the middle one there's so many people
wanted this so many people wanted this
compromised and now we paint this is why
I love the Internet
I thought primer we should just use the
white but you guys suggested gray so we
can get the darker colors this is why
the internet rocks I would have done
this completely the wrong way the wrong
way
dr. don't--it don't--it don't--it dun
dun dun dun no she's just keeping that
color
kinda looks like a penis yep
you really hope they're Marley you know
what I really hate about Halloween the
fact that spiders pretty much have it
made neither's decoration with spiders
and fake spiders all the time you don't
know if they're real fm4 spider was
smart they would just you know hang out
on these webs you bet oh it's a fake
spider no big deal just creeps me out
every time I walk by oh my god spider oh
that's fake okay just imagine if there
was a spider of a little think that is
look getting there oh my God look at how
he's doing can you see a little spots
it's kind of crazy this already feels a
little bit like like homier like closed
off a little bit I like this is oh my
guess is just a primer all right we're
making some progress
all the primer is on there now we just
have to wait for it to dry actually can
like this color too it's kind of a cool
color isn't it oh no no no no no just
finish this last bit oh my gosh you're
so not that much it's just a little bit
are you ready yeah wait what I'm excited
I feel like you're doing I feel like
you're up to something no no huh Zoey
I want man
if you how long you should do this is
good they're cool
I go to the bathroom I come back out and
this is what Ali does it's a rocket ship
I hope I hope that gets permanently
stuck on that oh ha ha
so he's just staring at it like I'm not
amused where's my bed where are my
chairs where are my toys I do not like
this painting oh you know we just could
just do graffiti you need to grow a
little bit cream abdul-jabbar
isn't bad luck to walk under a ladder
much less to stand under it for like 20
minutes
okay crashing crashing watch the show i
watch the watch the watch the who did
all this your little peace heart those
ghosts done it peaceful girls just love
man oh thank you big strong man give him
a drumroll ready
there it is is still drying put that
Zoey
it's on camera she admitted to it all
right so what do you guys think it looks
so much better
what do you think Zoey yeah pretty good
all right I think she just wants her bed
back now
I'm really happy this is this looks so
much better it looks like it's like a
more homey feeling I guess you could say
like it was so wide open with the white
oh so much white so I feel like this
kind of closes it off it makes it more
homey feeling Oh where's mommy
now I think they want to come in
you guys win
worse they attacked me
with child trippy
