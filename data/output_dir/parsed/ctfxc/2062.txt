Australia that is complete rainbow
brings us good luck speaking of good
luck we've just found out that we're
like arriving an entire like pretty much
12 hours early so that's awesome also
the new MacBook Pros came out I'm having
a nerd fest right now near death that's
what Ali just sent me when I told her
the new computers came out wow that's
not in the braid that hurts
Coco all right so there's a baggage
thing that's one way I just toss that
that would give me an extra kilo so we
basically have to figure out how to get
stuff down to 23 or 24 so I was super
sneaky I put it on the thing and I just
did this one by me I'm just kind of
waiting and trying to make it like
leather a little bit less and stuff like
that kind like this
it's kind of jumping all over the place
and the girls just kinda like looking at
me like okay and try this looks I mean
like sir do you uh do you have a living
animal man they you so we got through
half what we got through security and
look at this I was not sure yes
the Rainbows following us
that's cool in LA in Atlanta and then
home our private jet that's not some
private now we this planes trains and
automobiles jerk she did you get us in
trouble again going to prison this is
kind of sketchy we are going to the
airport right Kat has just discovered
her own Indo board
she's just rocking back and forth on his
basket she flipped it sideways I think
that's what she's been trying to do this
whole time
and now she's riding on it I'm always
like I don't care I don't yeah
disruption of what was once a feast I'm
getting into this really bad habit of
like editing in the morning and then
doing all these errands all day without
eating so like three or four o'clock
rolls around and I haven't eaten
anything so I need to get much better at
that this will start it at all this is
the cookie that started the debate any
rowdy I'm sticking to it
second ears howdy oh my god

trying to like get the wall but it's
pretty freaking scary looking okay

room on the plane then this little guy
what do I think it's a softshell turtle
I don't know what these things are
actually called they live in lakes
though all around Florida so cute
alright guys there she is she's a beauty
I don't think I told you guys that I
bought that yet because I didn't want
anybody to tell Charles ahead of time
cuz it was supposed to be a surprise for
him so there she is I got him a golf
cart for his welcome home present
because he wanted one for a long time
and I found someone who was selling one
so there we go

paper and put little bows on it it's
gonna be so cute I've never wrapped
anything that huge in my life it's his
very own personal spaceship oh man

never wrapped anything that huge in my
entire life well guys listen I feel like

numbers is that a bad thing no I feel
like it's a good thing right

now it's still the 12 that still blows
my mind in Atlanta still the 12 and now
the only ones here are Danny basically
what happened is Travis and I just had
to leave our bags behind us we just left
them and then we're just gonna say they
got lost and hopefully they'll find it
and send to us otherwise we're gonna
make the flight and then we would get
home at like like the 13th and I wanted
to get home on the 12th
