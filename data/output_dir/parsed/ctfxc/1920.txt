of getting tired of editing on the
kitchen table and not using the office
so I want to kind of clean up my office
and get a new desk because I have a rule
I have an office I just don't use it cuz
I'm so stubborn trying to find a nice
desk for me to utilize all my editing
for you guys that's as big as the other

slimmed down a little bit or this one so
the dark brown or the light brown you
guys are pretty much is decorating our
entire sauces did your booty in there
the nice
I don't know if I ever get any of the
videos done now I had to drive around
all over the place to find the perfect
chair but I found one alas I thought
what's gonna happen is I have a lot of
editing to do tonight I have to do drunk
gaming which is gonna be live tomorrow
or live right now on Ally's Channel
then on Wednesday I'm hoping to have
that video where Steve remember the
human Wikipedia guy I filmed a video
while I was in London and I'm gonna put
it on the Charles Trippy channel it's
actually it's one of these like hidden
guy hidden camera but like candid
walking a man on the street things and
I'm just basically surprising a lot of a
lot of people a lot of CTFxC r--'s so
I'm hoping to have that done by
Wednesday drunk gaming is live now but I
have a lot of editing to do so you know
make sure I'm comfortable editing my
goal guys and I need your help is to get
that video featured on as many news
outlets as possible and to get Steve our
ultimate goal is to get Steve on 20/20
or some news organization because I want
a lot of people to see that that's
that's sheer talent to know like that's
just that's mind-boggling literally that
is mind-boggling that somebody can like
recall dates like that just like
serialized like people and - it's just
it blows my mind so when that video
comes out it's your job guys
to get that video share to all your
friends send it to all the news
organizations Ellen I don't care
anybody but that's our goal and this is
that for me this is just sure I want to
get Steve the recognition because it is
fascinating and I think more people
should see it so I'll keep you guys
