I guess it's day three in New Zealand
gets technically gay too
today's actually the show day so our
first show here it's to be really fun
because that's been walking around with
a meeting like we've had probably about
20 people so far that come to the show
just walking around offering I just
pretty go right there I just looked over
there and I balanced this dad got off a
little bit well nothing beats yesterday
though
we didn't see yesterday's video go check
it out because we jumped off a freaking
skyscraper that thing right there that
little guy
well there goes Oh knock grass out
bring back tuck then I'll punch it write
it but think I hear more over there
though
there might be of those beetle from
oh yeah those little pinchers on it
okay they're all over the place about
mouthing oh that's got all over the
place I just noticed there's a cemetery
right there in the middle of the highway
though creepy that is I think it's from
the 1700s oh there's another one down
here too that's pretty cool the ground
is just kind of overlap this building
this is all that's left for all the
earthquakes I'm just totally have no
idea was like that
yeah Coley's Michael Jackson right now
big the best angles I'm gonna get our
program is Charles Trippy
oh yeah hold the trope yep what's going
down all right you got pulling back oh
it's terrifying what three Marley you
tell her say this is my house better
come and say hello to me okay so my
sister just came over Claire we've
already talked about this a few times
getting married Wednesday and Highmark
bar and yeah also I just want to clarify
with everybody that's getting really
upset right now or it's thinking that I
smoke cigarettes guys I do not I don't
smoke cigarettes I was actually holding
my brother-in-law's cigarette while he
was letting that fish go yesterday I
really appreciate your guys attention to
detail but I can assure you 150% but I
do not smoke cigarettes
one
so uh oh yeah
if you're new to the videos Kohli always
goes running for like 50 miles every
morning doesn't matter Scout basically
the city he always finds the cool stuff
coffee food things to do here we go
we're on a pole let's fix that forum
let's fix hunter there we go
someone see if I can find the oldest
thing here God what you privy me after
falling back
like I don't want to say it's creepy but
eerie that it's just in the middle of
everything like this
that's 1868 that's really sad
two days old what's kind of interesting
is that the older of the tombstone bit
more that's written on it like how they
died and who they were like it's like a
story it's not just like breasts and
peas the reason why I wanted to come
down here as soon as I hear that this
place was actually haunted that's just a
crypt right there above the ground they
get mad it's haunted so I want to try to
come here at night and be if it to be
creepier
I shouldn't say creepy that's really
disrespectful if there's anything out of
the ordinary Asians there's a road right
over everything all right so far this is
the oldest one 1875 85 years old
that's pretty crazy so that's like 17th
century there seventeen hundred's James
Stevenson as much as this is frightening
to me or uneasy to me
it's actually really freaking beautiful
down here Oh kind of end up in here all
right that vlog in and walking around
yeah they attached a little bit more
what's interesting is that they're
trying to make it like a little park it
seems like they have little walkways
here and they have walkways up there
it's not a park I normally go through I
just wanted to go through because I
heard it was haunted I'm trying to be
really really respectful not to step on
anything but it's really honestly kind
of hard because other the spider there's
really a lot of tombstones in here and
some of them are so like decrepit and so
old that they're just kind of like
hidden like I think that was one they're
just kind of like molds into the ground
like this probably entire area is filled
a lot of kids really unfortunate there's
a lot of kids in here this is what I'm
talking about the other just kind of
like broken and scattered everywhere
alright this is the one I really wanted
to check out because it just seems like
a scary movie
that's really sad that one broke - I
mean they had like little trail through
here
pardon me who wants to go down there and
then a part of me is smart but the other
part is not so smart so we're gonna go
it's actually really kind of cool
alright that dips right down I don't
want to go anymore if I fall off I'm
gonna end up great in here
the stock was there
the was it my head ready some just
brushed my hand I'm literally just brush
my hand
Monica I'm not even kidding I know I was
kind of kidding earlier but I'm not even
kidding someone just brush my hair
and say I don't know the superstition
but I don't think I'm supposed to try to
fix that even though I kind of want to
1884 that the oldest one we've seen like
honestly think about that 1884 and it's
2016 right now that's so long ago these
types of tombs are graves I don't know
why it's gonna freak me out a little bit
cuz they're above-ground you could just
break through that with a sledgehammer
and you'd see something we're digging up
something which I would never do
obviously just kind of click your tail
of it I just saw something over there
hopefully it's just a person thinks
people die walking through here but now
I'm like so freaking nervous
you see it I'm a grit hut as a haunted
graveyard yes I've had something already
brushed my hand once something brushed
my hand once and I keep seeing things
moving no Travis is I thought it was
Travis - but it's Ivan here with me all
right so the creep factor of this place
it's probably an 8 out of 10 for me give
them a big baby but I'm gonna see if I
can get Ben to come out with me tonight
maybe do a time-lapse
I guess the legend is or whatever it is
if there's a legend - whatever you want
to call the urban legend I guess it
would be is that at night you see things
like random things so I want to put a
GoPro out here tonight they'll put it on
a Ledge or something and just see if we
can see anything creepy sorry
want a cookie hey big old dummy
that's funny I'm gonna go take a nap
before the show I love you hi Hey
I love about everything about New
Zealand screams Lord of the Rings like
there's some reason to these stairs
never going back to the cemetery to try
to do that time-lapse and see if I can
find any ghosts
I don't think I would lay on that one
though morning
all right so it's not like it freakin
spent enough time in this haunted
graveyard area I had to come back at
night like everyone not who tells me I
have to do got the GoPro let's see if we
can find anything
about too weird way too weird to be
noises probably not even a haunted doll
on my brain and just creeping me out
first show and healing second show in
guys enjoying dump fishing there's a
couple of angles I'm trying to get these
get all technical freeze IDs and get one
up here really I want to go up when you
want to do story I'll go up all right
