another message from future Charles to
pass Charles when people are telling you
that you're wasting your time on the
Internet
and wasting your time playing news they
can bet you should just you know get a
nine-to-five job be normal just just
laugh in their face because what's
normal right
totally another message from a you know
future Charles Tabasco you're going to
have a smoking hot wife and two awesome
dogs
you know you ask you know how do you how
do you get a hot life how do you get a
hot husband and that's pretty much it
that's the secret security big deal
you just do what you love make yourself
happy and then you know awesome people
will gravitate towards you so secret is
out

as rare as to be your tree that's that's
a lot harder to find do you guys still
you're on tour - one more run you have
one month one month down one more to go
