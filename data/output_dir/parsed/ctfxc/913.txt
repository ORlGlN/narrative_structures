some gadgets now porta potty diapers so
today I have to find a splitter because
the PlayStation 3 we tried to do reverse
new gaming episode 2 with the
PlayStation 3 and elgato hd60 doesn't
play nice with the PlayStation 3
so I have to give the splitter

no idea the last time I you can see for
a regular standalone phone forget the
whole freaking distracted I need a
splitter for HDMI it's for USB nope

hey stop it but put another coat on here
I am uncomfortable so Ali's coming back
from the gym
and I'm trying to find some kind of
unique games to kind of play and first
one goat simulator
it's almost random one I think might be
kind of fun that or farming the
simulator just trying to think of some
fun games that are outside of like you
know like Madden and things like that so
if you guys I keep asking you guys I
want you need like a happy wheels like
indie games like goat simulator it seems
like the weirdest one we could possibly
do the most fun so you look who's here

next can you imagine that thing open up
we have a couple hundred of these
clothes pins yes it's just to see who
can get as many clothes pins as possible
on their body what we're gonna try and
do though it's like we're switching up
to this area so neck up do boobie
tassles

before cutting hi
the words are checking out the pinching
like the visor I'm watering your
beautiful bit you know you can probably

lost the first round I definitely lost
the first round it hurts so bad this
round what we're gonna do is we're gonna
put them on ourselves we're gonna do a
timer tianmen can get on our face in one
minute one minute I'm gonna stop the
timer
I'm very confident in this one be really
honest I am really not that confident

turn it we think that's good all right
we're starting the timer for one minute
and see if you can get as many as
possible on their face oh my god you
poor thing is you you pinched it right
there
all right ready go then go
I get it right there

jugular 18 it's crap this one I think

anywhere but your lips so anyone on the
face except the lips except for the lips
the lips are started yeah it's kind of a
cop-out hands in the air three two one

really give Chuck your teeth so I'm
taking place at herbal tea and herbal

I was just telling Ali I'd take an exit
out of in every once in awhile I was
very rare I'll give this a weird feeling
like it's just like my brain goes dead
like that's a terrible way to explain it
it's like a blank it's just weird
so every once in a while that happens it
just happened so hey Ali was like Kate's
dress always dress
what we're seeing like it's always
stressed but now that we're traveling
more and more things I think it's just
more things at once it's not bad stress
