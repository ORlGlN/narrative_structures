why would you even watch it there you
can watch it like it's on TV
but if you're the Fitz's Dali's
protecting my armageddon covers arms are
covered by most
trying to notice this like this that's
Phil and that's a giant screen and
that's the football game I'm realizing
that all of us are looking at the screen
and barely looking at the field
Oh
Ali and I are trying to think of some DJ
games where's DJ press play DJ volume up
DJ Dan be okay press pause
CJ pause yes DJ I'm putting him out so
you like the football game
fun times a long drive home
these are all dogs you're going to
hypothetically adopt or breed vacuously
and Linus is Phil's dog which okay
points
Oh
you know your head Michael Henry is I
like that better
and then chubs is the leader
for sure hanging fun over the car how
you doing little bun stop finds a lot to
get see your butt
so all that crazy talk in the time-lapse
so I figured instead of like music I
would just do that because it was kind
of made me laugh oppa made you guys
chuckle a little bit
it's been fun fun fun fun day go Jaguars
anyway so we just got some wolof
sandwiches time to devour it mmm
anyway I hope you guys had a great day
