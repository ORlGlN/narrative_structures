good morning Internet two guesses where
I'm at right now that's all you get
did you guess all right intro I know
where Ted is I found a knee condom
what's up buddy aren't you swimming it's
always fun when you get there super
early because you want to be there you
know punctual and then something goes
wrong and then your end up waiting for
hours we want to try to find a place to
sleep but I know if we do that we're
gonna end up missing our plane you
should pull these snuggle up clothes
keep our bodies warm you know okay
that's it you cold push back to 8:45
right now we're trying to find places
where we can sleep so we don't get
stepped on the airport in what about the
behind the desk just sleep with a stick
yeah yes do it you first buddy I think
I'm gonna just do under here
for a 10:00 a.m. I just could say using
p.m. I don't think this is gonna be a
fun trip just the right amount of stuff
in my backpack right now
laptops are not no that's a
million-dollar idea dude
pillow laptops million dollars in debt
ideas anyone want to invest the only ray
of sunshine when you get a delayed
flight seafood get your pack six jumping
on me all right so we got two hours
minimum as well hearing now turning in
the worst day that didn't even hurt
right now so numb to the pain check all
right let's go recheck them again so
their sales could be at least two more
hours until we can at least take off we
won't get into the show area to like 3
or 4 p.m. then we play it like seven or
eight in one of the worst days I think
as far as traveling I think I've ever
had but I mean the silver lining I'm
trying to think of is that this is an
airplane and I'd rather be the fix
they'd be up in the air and not be fixed
I think it's like one of those louis c.k
jokes where is like I have people
complaining it's like you're in the air
and it's kind of crazy to think about is
like you are flying like 700 800 miles
an hour will complain about that while
they're eating their pretzels
went to the youth sandwich area I
dropped you and we made it on the plane
fix plan that's the most important part
fix plane hate to do it but it's
becoming a little tradition
Glenn Airport by hand right foot good
luck
how cold is it outside
it's about 45 degrees Fahrenheit I don't
find that particularly cold

a perfect balcony right by a pool yeah
