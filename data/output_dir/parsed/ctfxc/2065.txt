where's it going where's it going so
seven bags is way too much for these
full full kangaroos eat one I dare
somebody to eat one I think we found
where all tennis balls go to die being a
weirdo ting all the grass vegetarian
sounds Oh head so I used to think that
the only reason the dog did that was if
they were sick and they had to throw up
or something like that and they were
trying to you know induce vomiting by
eating the grass but actually a
veterinarian told me that sometimes they
do that if they're just craving
nutrition sometimes they just eat the
grass if they feel like they need a
little extra greens in their system it's
interesting right riveting shut up cool
story bro master help
it's your but you must Australia's
largest lizard I could take them the
worst part is like when you're looking
into an empty cage you're like where is
it is it gonna jump out at me
they hung over there you hard
it's a cool looking down it's crazy
since I'm so used to alligators the
round nose like how pointy their nose is
it's totally different that's basically
if you guys didn't know the difference
between a croc and alligator is their
nose or are always moving pull on a
Zowie

down here in Australia I've been
watching TV randomly right I decided to
be kind of like a super tourist and try
something like the candies and the
coffee so I got this this weird-looking
