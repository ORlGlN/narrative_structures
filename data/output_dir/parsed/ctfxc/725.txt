driver's seat but I'm not so today all
those people from the sky jump Anna all
those girls hooked up all been JJ and
myself and we're gonna go do bungee
jumping which goes into the water on the
Harbour Bridge and then I think we're
gonna do a helicopter tour if we can get
it all in one day are you gonna hang out
with your cousins for a few days oh I
hope you're doing sighted I hope you're
still excited hi buddy

to remember that it's called a rehearsal
dinner I'll go wake up gonna be relaxed
and beautiful no hangovers exactly
that's our bridge this is actually
something I always said to myself I
would never ever ever do what I would
have do it yeah JJ's been convincing me
the whole time and been back there he's
kind of be my voice of reason
he's been my good agent that's my bad
angel
so it looks like I lost weight but look
it was still the same we both lost a
pound that's just moving the same weight
together get these for traffic cuz man
you jump high whip chomp - you know he's
totally missing an opportunity right now
jumping off a bridge while singing
Skyway Avenue or something like that

a bridge but jumped on the frickin
we're right over there my buddies over
there hooked us up
in is this so funny like when you say
you'll never do something similar to get
like mom mentality with your friends and
you end up doing it this is like on my
list of everything I've ever try to do
yeah do you know the differences between
this and the other thing is that you
really have no perspective on how high
you're actually up you have no buildings
you just they have green water so the
stairs are freaking me out more than the
danger
kaylynn just do it ticket ticket

that guy he's a hero
that's why I want to be doing it I don't
know actually look more intense on
camera but I can promise you guys that
felt like I was just jumping off a
bridge like because there was no
resistance it's the sky jump was amazing
but there's a resistance II thought of
being like actually safe this is really
safe but I mean you literally have
freefall you're literally falling
there's nothing holding you back until
you get the end I'm talking about that
amazing all right so this day is just
actually beginning because next thing
we're doing is we're getting on a
helicopter now we're going to go see

car but yeah

stupid shark face well that was pretty
it was weird because it's like felt like
it was like like what it feels like it's
literally flooding yeah I mean literally
exploding like a big drunk yeah I'm in
this big giant drone that was amazing
the coolest thing that describe is that
you literally feel like you're floating
and then you kind of feel like you're
twisting back and forth right you think
a magic carpet you're literally you were
literally floating in air
and showed me a whole new girl there's a
Latin over there today he's been I'm
exhausted out today so after a crazy
freakin day Ben and I are currently
going to hell and everywhere else why
not see wasn't lying

into like a little coffin
