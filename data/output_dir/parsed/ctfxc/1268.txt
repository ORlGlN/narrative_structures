think you guys are really gonna like
them since I'm always up here with
Melissa I'm just basically gonna deck
this room out to be basically awesome
get a nice little bed maybe a cool TV
just basically a home away from home
like a vacation home I guess you could
say since they can't really be home
alone a lot it makes more sense to be up
here
when I can't be at home you know this
cool stuff to do up here it makes the
vlogs a lot more interesting and fun
stuff like that it'll be a fun day today
