morning j-jane Santa Bob good morning so
we are currently trying to trim the
dog's toenails and this is like the
hardest thing to do with them and Marley
and Zoey were both sleeping and I got
the bright idea to try to do it while
they were sleeping and they ran no it's
smart well I mean you've got to kind of
do it that way because we have to chip
we've tried everything we've tried
everything and all comes down to I know
she just is so mad and she's hiding when
she was when Zoey was little I took her
to a vet to have it done because I was
getting concerned that I wasn't doing it
too too short and I didn't want her
quick to grow too long and then
eventually you know the nail is long
because the quicks long I did it and the
person at the vet a complete idiot and
snipped her and ever since
Zoey has been deathly afraid and we've
tried everything we have this little
like dremel tool and it were yeah we
have to I'll show you guys what we have
to do we've seen in the past but we
literally have to sit on her and a pin
her down and feed her cookies and that's
the only way to do it and that's only
kind of the way to do it we have a
problem little tool thing is out of
batteries okay this is like the only
thing oh we have batteries okay that
means seriously is like the only thing
that I still think electronic wires that
uses C or D batteries i what name one
one other gadget we own that has a C
better one of the gadgets that we own we
even on a flashlight yeah
so we you'd rather take a shower they
get your nails done it's not that bad do

trim dog's nails cuz this this is always
a fiasco there we go see it's not so bad
