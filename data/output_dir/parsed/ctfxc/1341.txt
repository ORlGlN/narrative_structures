hello guys so I obviously have way too
much energy right now it is 3 a.m. where
I'm at now and my body thinks it's still
1:30 p.m. literally I have no idea if I
should go to bed or is it edit or first
you go to run a marathon this is a the
crappy thing about traveling is time the
timewarps
does come time warp since live jet lag I
don't jet lag it's kind of like lame
wrong time warps so been laying in this
bed right now discussing in music and
playing on Twitter and Danny wandered
off to go find no goth everyone else
yeah so I guess technically I should
start the vlog but I mean nothing's
really happening so I'm going to stop so
I'm going to try to go to bed and then
that way when I wake up it's gonna be
Showtime and it should be really fun
really interesting because we're first
time ever playing a show in Japan I'm
looking forward to it so much all right
so I'm gonna start fake sleeping and up
in use as a transition the little things
in Japan okay so you know when you get
out of shower you know and you can't see
anything to be here so you have to wipe
it down
look at that this is automatically ready
for you if we're really in movement each
time to leave like khari did re where
are we negara just doing the critical
nerve-wracking thing of seeing over guy
don't forget your holy your money with
holes in it so i don't know how it
always happens with Danny I always end
up being the last people down to the
group because we're either uploading
vlogs or doing something like that would
get distracted by some shiny this time
we were 30 minutes early and we're the
first people here getting our stuff done
I think I got probably the best laundry
bag I've ever gotten takes out
anytime something Fred look at this
picture I took in the laundry room when
you put that th a mind you laundry in
the dryer be sure not to put in many
betta causes the trouble please take the
clothes out promptly after you causes
the trouble gonna cause of the trouble
where they got Bo right on the second
time right
anytime something fresh it's gonna be
full of dirty laundry
mmm thing is tuner in there no I'm
supposed to bridge the other side no use
the Doritos think I eat your camera
before do you want bread with a bread
sandwich that's an egg bread sandwich
it's not bad it's just different guys
I don't ever say anything's bad it's
just different hold on I knew what it
was now we are off to Tower Records
right nerd tower records I'm no idea I
don't either
Nate where are we going Tower Records go
to the venue first entire records all
right Nate knows where we're going at
least in soundcheck walk the Tower
Records acoustic show and real show high
five guys was it two years ago a little
sprinters we bickered
yeah that's right little sprinter on a
simple plant are you guys remember row
like this I mean I can't get there
anymore I was much younger that much
more agile
without New Yorker smoggy
you know what that's interesting if the
people that are wearing like our doctor
mask yeah it's not because they're
scared of getting so they don't give it
they don't it's like the most respectful
thing yeah that wasn't far at all
ah the embassy where to Danny go it
stops at 300k you want an umbrella
really you just set it down when you're
done
that's very nice actually which is the
Wi-Fi password
Duncan which was the Wi-Fi password so
we just played the bunch of the songs
and I think we can actually pull this
off what do you think Olli I think so
so today's show is going to be a little
bit unique we're gonna be playing every
song from the first record front the
back so it's gonna be one of those shows
all right I think we can actually do
this but it's going to be very
interesting we were walking to Tower
Records to do an acoustic show look a
little dougie and I just found this in
my pocket I just wanted to let you guys
know that we have the guitar picks CV
puppy in black that are back in stock
right now this is crazy shouldn't be
walking in the middle of John japan-land
right left and right be careful that the
guitar pick packs are back in stock and
they're in black at this time we did a
limited run in black because I wanted to
switch it up a little bit so if you guys
want that CTFxC verse comm links down
there description tiller sold out
are you doing back there we're on top of
the tower records right now in Tokyo
Japan that is kind of crazy right now so
join again but I'll do it this way
maybe you should sit down for more
leverage
Oh your insurance cover this they're
ready yeah yeah got it
solid you're getting arrested
are these like mp3's epi once it was
like in d1 yeah it's like you sign our
form of music okay they're called CDs
and that's a champ you won right
we lost Danny let's do the texting me
now so someone will steal my own record
oh right there look at that Duncan I got
to purchase this I'm purchasing our own
record there you go so we get a discount
I'll buy my own record oh I can't read
English hi guys cashiers over here drop
picked up trash bin things are priceless
and the nice pendant man I feel like
we're getting older we reckon that's a
good pen this is fantastic that was like
one of those cool experiences because
with one of those things I think you
feel like very rare that somebody gets
up we buy their album at a major record
store in Tokyo Japan so it's just one of
those moments where I just had to take
back just take a deep breath and just
take it all in you want to mean it's
just unbelievable like literally right
now guys I'm in Tokyo and we just played
a show playing a show that I swap CD
that we recorded last year in that big
ass building

Confucius on Japanese it's just gonna
complete complete cause I wanna go
outside
Cole and I are going to be completely
touristy and we're gonna we got our
album I'm gonna take photos in front of
Tower Records with our Japanese record
Japan you're weird you're weird
that normal it's absolutely beautiful
my favorite things to do
I do it
nobody else is covered
nobody else's but what do they know that
we don't know they live maybe we
shouldn't do it
crazy 50 as thing one of those crazy
things today was one of those
I swear I kind of realized you know that
I was living in living the dream one of
my favorite sayings is like fear kills
more dreams
and failure ever built and it's really
true I mean like if you guys have a
dream go for it it doesn't matter what
it is like I said
dragon beer drank just let
guys live your dream please do that for
