such a creepy morning to start today
good morning guys I don't know how I
have this much PAP I think it's actually
cuz I actually went to bed early
it's 5:45 Ali's driving me right now I
don't I have no idea how she's actually
got any energy Kushina the whole vlog
yesterday so I'm just picking a thumb
now before getting outplayed remember we
talked about yesterday being kind of
crazy about being our plane and leaving
on the fog
that's how that is apparently
emotional what it's like
every morning or every time I leave for
like the flight or something or leaving
in general Ali gets so cute and so
emotional
let's have I get home you're gonna be
gone for the bachelor party him to be me
and I think I'll pick up feeling around
I can work so I'm gonna be puppy-sitting
little Finley we're gonna have a little
adventure about taking care of a puppy
I have not spilled my cereal
so yeah that's not engage my day but
that's spilling something the drop on
windows anymore I think I'm the only one
on this plane nope okay to get better it
still sucks let's go check out look at
snow for the first time this year for us
at least for you guys
prior to menace amount of it that's ice
I learned I brought my ski socks this
time so their water move there we go get
that heat going
Sonic the Hedgehog Lucy the other day
like this is like scarred into his head
the sharpest and sharpest Clippers in
the world not even New York and get
their hands on the America that lasts
the life Sophie do that
breaking loose earphone assault show all
the Android people that you switch to
the iPhone he's got iPhones everything's
weird with them right now we're pets
don't worry I know you guys probably
think I'm crazy this isn't just a pretty
I have like four layers on this right
now but Danny and I just had to go out
here cuz better hotel you tourists
they're technically wasn't a science and
I can't do this so naturally Oh
so naturally I had to do it I think I'm
done let's get out of here I walk in
there and apparently that's where you're
at the skis and they're just like doing
this shaking her head like well it
doesn't say I can't do it right oh wait
everyone on ice my swear skates what I
was doing was incorrect got to feel like
I should get like a hot chocolate just
to have something hot in my hand
vlogging right now and this cold weather
is little my hand look out you see how
red they are look at that that is insane
to me I am not used to that
obviously I'm not used to that guys
remember in Park City we now we got to
see snow but the snow man she like loved
it and then she was like okay I'm done
I'm done like within like three minutes
I feel like that's the thing with
everybody everyone loves the sight of
snow and then once you touch it they
realize is it actually ice and they're
done and they're gone I could be
completely wrong but I'm not aware of
any cheddar cheese that has holes in it
that's what I mean like I've never seen
in real life Oh Charles there's an
emotion probably there's no Z you're
right there's the project completely to
be my word that's probably the smartest
place to stop got some clothes Danny got
a hat he's in a noggin before we freeze
it off
do you remember these back in the day
for voicemails were digital oh my god
this is the things I think of Wisconsin
still use these do one's the copyright
date on these things look it's yellow on
the back 1996 a dvd-r or six hours on
your JVC Premium camcorder huh this is
what an SD card used to be like a
quarter of an SD card maybe even that
Danton and I dumped it and attacked it
and at that would you say you look like
Kevin McCallister right now it really is
they have the the ropes on the tree and
everything you can knock it down as a
booby trap no no there she is guys we
were playing like wiffle ball we had to
hit it up into that area and I think
just probably a bunch of wiffle balls up
in there this place doesn't look nearly
as creepy with all the snow everywhere
that's for sure
by the way here's if you ever hear this
in the back right now you hear that it's
because my camera is totally dying what
not dying
the back is flipping off
here's an RC shot
here we go
goes through that
I honestly have no idea where I'm at
right now might exaggerate I have no
idea for that I got into some sort of
subjects stairwell within a sub
stairwell this is what happens when I go
and we are at sea take photos I get lost
in a completely green place yeah so
we're actually playing at the ego bottom
right now see there's another stairwell
we're going to the pool I couldn't find
where I was going so I had to go find
Sophie and I look out now I find all
this now it's clearly marked but it
wasn't earlier
30 minutes later or walking down doing
this places we have to take showers down
there
there it is McAlister
we're gonna find with the Kings from
last night oh you find it where is it
you're immediately out
last time there was disgusting water
I love and hate this venue at the same
time see right here Zak you can go you
go they're not supposed to be but you
can walk in here and there's like you
can walk around the entire pool you know
like those exploring videos all over
YouTube they need to come here because
we were doing that last time in 2013
this they probably would find more crazy
things that we ever did if I was I was
scared so I had to take a shower and
this thing by myself it was scary
I don't sound stupid but for some reason
hearing all the stories in this place
and then being by here down here by
yourself and just it's frightening and
just messes with your brain it's kind of
like what it is this I remember there
was the creepy
there was a creepy chair right here last
time really
definitely not it guts now that's
everybody's getting high
get your feet wet find it there we go
flashlight what happened to oh I
remember this is all making sense now
during the company party a couple of
children actually mountains really its
boiler oh man oh my god
don't touch the pipes no I think you'll
see the pool when there soon
you saw the four windows you would not
be that Collin's you saw some things are
so pretty hot
do these poles are hard no yeah just
keep going forward just keep going
forward we're right behind you Zack
let's keep going forward I don't
remember this part of the actually doing
back here I don't think they took us
this way Oh
it's hot in here
dead end
it was creamy so before me there that's
a dead end
I was at a dead end the spiders that's
the scariest part I remember now that
was the scariest part for murders of
spiders are you doing the breaking right
now always these Frankie's but your
shoes off man
I know another brown on the brown floor
I think this is where we went no way
there's nothing on there is it no
ooh someone had the sex that's the
freaky freaky baby oh yeah I remember
that whole broken pipe I surprised we
weren't paying attention how we didn't
do that all the way out here Oh Oh what
is that a book wait I'll check myself in
the mirror display like the Redrum game
in here
look at these tools dude
they surprisingly cool now
oh we got sound check we've done playing
you see the Luther King thing from 2013
it looks like they tried to cover up
some parts of it there we go guys
throwback 2013 so that's the hutch how
I've said a few times
that Jeffrey Dahmer used to go to with
these victims and I'm super girls super
Mulroney still interesting I went the
wrong way

I'm gonna decide this put it right into
my other pop more than just a seat look
at that really tail you should eliminate
oh yeah cold cold cold
I'd go shirtless because I don't want to
sweat all over the place I guess it's
gonna be like 5,000 people here
