plane

our own jet
except her we hired her though I just
found out this is going to be an 11 hour
flight
the good news about being on tour though
is that the vlogs are really interesting
because I get to meet a lot of awesome
people and see a lot of cool new places
I've never been to and I feel like
that's why these things exist like
document my life whether it's positive
or negative or anything like that that's
what these exist you know they'll
document my life is the ups and downs
and it's really cool because these are
definitely obstacle to travel all over
the world playing music was just
something I truly loved and meeting all
the CTX eaters which I truly love and I
hate flying that's the only thing I
don't like but it's worth it in the end
so you know it's just one of those
things you know I was loving
