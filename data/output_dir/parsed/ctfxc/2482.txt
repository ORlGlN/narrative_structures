last time we visit Gordo's we're gonna
come back early we only have like five
days after you guys the whole thing
you're embarrassing
my voice can you tell my boys and I I'm
gonna try it anyway
all right thought for a long time about
whether or not I wanted to film it
and I feel will be in
are you very much need to share this
with you all so I'm going to do it
last night a really good friend of mine
lost his mother
and you know I don't even know where to
begin
except to say that I'm confused
about what's happened
and if any of you out there have ever
lost
I'm very close to
you understand the confusion and anger
that comes with this understanding of
losing someone who you thought was
healthy
I was going to live
for many more years
there the fact that he is going to have
to go through his life he and his
brother
graduate they are into the nature
we never put anything negative in the
vlogs and I just feel like we have to
share this moment because it's extremely
real and I apologize that I'm upset I
apologize didn't cry but this is
something that happens in everybody's
life
loss is something that nobody really
happy it's true stupid but you just have
to kind of be out together and deal with
it that's all I feel like I just have to
say that everybody always talks about
how you should stick your life for good
and how you should thank God every day
that you have the people you have in
your lifetime
whether or not you're religious you just
type of thing whoever did you get to
share your life with the people with
whom you share your life you get to
share your life it's so happy so I just
have to ask you do please appreciate the
people with whom you share your life
every day because you never know what's
gonna happen you truly don't and it's
not to say that you have to live your
life in fear it's not to say that you
have to live your life wondering what's
gonna happen the next day but it's just
to say that you have to make the most of
it and truly appreciate what everybody
has to offer it what everybody has to
share
I don't even know if what I'm saying
makes sense because I was thinking fetus
oh but I just felt those are needed to
think this and share it with you because
we promised we would never lie to you we
promised we would always share
everything with you this is very much
serious things going on sorry that your
feeling is to deal with your lost
that's it
appreciate hee
you
