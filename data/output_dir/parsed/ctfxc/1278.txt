completely late to warp tour so today is
the day that I get my special tattoo
Craig is working on it right now it's
badass yeah I just want to show you guys
it's going to be a basis basically a
piece of one up I was gonna do the green
mushroom one up but I figured I needed
to do something a little more unique
basically just representing he's in my
second my second chance in life he had a
funny way I love the pond some door and
getting calls the curve basically slept
with
so I got to print out the little tattoo
so Craig can give it on my arm the other
thing I was asking them is if I can give
this tattoo
my sprung out tattoo updated or touched
ups like just well as this thing is
probably 12 to 13 years old it's having
it a touchdown as once the Nerds
collection so far at or so
CM Punk Xena Triple H Brock Lesnar so
now they can all fight and then oh and I
also got a sweet Tag Team Championship
belt way so you have two belts now I

sterile environment all set up

when was this day one of worked or three
days left of work boys
you're like a little elf what hat and
everything no one took that guitar as a
case and gave it to him no one pranked
me beautiful now it is time to step into
bees lethal chambers or office you will
drive I am a little disappointed that
you didn't try to prank me but I am a
little disappointed to try to prank me
week before we have you know the
stressful part of getting a center
oh yeah taking his face right here to
get attached to you yeah give this right
there in between everything and here we
go
what up pizza one up
Cole you're gonna be the hot seat later
again are you done wait let me see you
burped I haven't seen I think what the
police showed the internet your Boulvard
have you named your bird yet no you mean
you know my
you know the bird was also referenced
for prep chat but need like a special
one of noise for this thing now think
the pixels are the best part
see anyone could have a pizza tattoo or
a pixelated pizza tattoo but it's one
thing to have a pizza feed into a
pixelated tattoo no one has that one
so I go onstage in about 28 minutes and
this is how you do it on the road go
right up until stage every minute counts
and timeout time have a go play a show
we'll put hold on the speed set almost
done
looking pretty fuck cool though so we go
put some white in there fix up some of
the pixelation
but gotta go onstage posted first
getting tattooed and then going onstage
the getting rid off stage get tattooed
again
I like this they turned out to be a
really blossoming yesterday kind of
sucked a little bit he turned into an
awesome day is the day progressed but
today is even better
how to port money everything
so I think they're not guys my new
baseball setup oh my god it's ready

oh my god how many shows until this
thing is all right
Internet the common wood
it's like one said hi to everyone in
Kansas and now we gotta go back off the
bus and have Beasley finish this tattoo
and then it
I'm actually really really excited to
get this thing touched up
was that first tattoo
so it's my oldest one I remember when I
first got it I bought was so we hang
now right back into the hot seat EMS
break while we're off the bus one show
easily calm grape easily that calm
everybody please well right yeah I'll
put us up in the description below so
you can check it out and we are done
there it is guys one up pixelated pizza
fucking killed it dude hey killed it
awesome loved it loved it
bad lighting but that is before and I
will come back with an after
great for this and after yes it was once
read now it's back to read that's crazy
that toppled is completely gone his read
fate more than other colors or is that
just mean I think yeah yeah I love the
pixelation that's crazy
that's irradiation I remember this venue
now this is the venue where I ended the
Invisible Man right there and then Danny
I played a homerun Derby and a Grand
Slam was over that thing some time to
find something to eat
I forgot every time I got a tattoo my
endorphins just make me super tired and
hungry but everything came out freakin
amazing
freakin love it so before I get a
million one questions on why this tattoo
the main reason was I was gonna get a
Mario crap I was gonna get a mario green
mushroom you know the one up but I feel
like everyone and their mom has that one
and the reason why I was gonna get that
was because I feel like I got a second
chance at life as I'm reloading down
here you know with all the things that
are going on with my life I feel like I
get like a second chance so I wanted to
do that kind of represent that and to
make it a little bit more meat and mine
I believed like a pixelated pizza and I
thought that was a lot cooler than just
a mushroom that literally everyone and
their mom
so now every time I look down to my arm
but I'm playing bass I see that and I
see the smiley face I am reminded that
life is beautiful and I got a second
chance at it and to make it the best
life I possibly can no matter what yes
all that meaning out of a piece of pizza
yes don't tell Ally I'm doing this right
now for my mom
we're just in the air just relaxing I
just thought of something random so
consult sir water exists in space is
that oxygen in it just like bubbles just
like not exist it does it just become
water
I'm too lazy Google right now some
random thought hello by the way guys I
think just three more days left a warped
or three more days and then I'll be back
home but who's counting
I'm totally not counting or anything
like that so I was just talking to Ali
and it was leaning back way over there
on a cinder block at this water you know
behind my head and I'm gonna demonstrate
on how to Ryan hold the camera this is
what I did so there's an open can of
water right here and I'm just laying
like this
she calls I'd like to get up so I grab
the water rather did going like this
you're getting up I just went like this
dumped it all over my jokes right now
piss myself basically dried all this
thing I've ever done my life wallet in
the past 20 minutes that's more
appropriate
a wrestling match
guess what fun little story if you
follow me on instagram which is Charles
Trippy on Instagram
basically I lost my phone and whoever
found it posted a photo saying that we
leave it to the tenth some Good
Samaritan found my phone
they gave it back well battery's gonna
die and on that note a warped or
wrassling I'm gonna go to bed thank you
