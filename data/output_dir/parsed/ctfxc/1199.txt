little bit of history for you guys
13 years ago today October 23rd 2001 the
first iPod came out the very first iPod
and I got to thinking about it I was
thinking about like you know like the
lightbulb was considered one of the
greatest inventions you know the wheel
is even before that but I feel like
other than like you know the computer
and the Internet I feel like the iPod
would be one of the greatest inventions
of our generation at least when you
agree
do you think yeah now before you go man
an Apple fanboy let me just explain not
had a creative Zen I had a Zen jukebox I
had all those other mp3 players and
Tamagotchi the comic God table gachi
greatest invention of all Robert Morse
all these kids wanted pets but didn't
want to take care of them oh you have to
take care of your Tamagotchi I think I
did take care of your Tamagotchi more
they need to have their own real pay ha
ha but it didn't cost any money except
for purchasing the Tamagotchi you guys
to tell me the greatest invention of
your time modern time dollars the
greatest invention of all time I mean
the lightbulb in the wheel obviously we
get that excluding the Internet
Zoe would you say no porta-potty
greatest invention Romano ok uniting
