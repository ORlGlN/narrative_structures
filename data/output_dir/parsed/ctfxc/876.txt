that's your treat you guys do whatever
you want to do I don't really understand
why you keep doing this do you're such a
freak
what are you doing you weirdo so I don't
know if guys know this but I guess fall
officially started two days ago I guess
fall officially started two days ago if
you didn't know here in Florida wait a
second this might sound like a really
stupid question so nevermind I'm right
I'm gonna ask it go so we decided that
because Florida fall is not really fall
at all it's still summer we were gonna
take the dogs out to the dog beach today
because it's just too pretty not to be
out here and I know that they would
really enjoy it I mean it's been a while
but I think I think he could be better
come on Dee kind of like Bob they're for
little baby swims out and then he does
just like somehow floats backwards but
he could be better now you never know
still pretty out look how pretty the
clouds are and now
unfortunately diesel she's actually
doing well not important
there's wonderful thing he's a clean so
well swimming but it's different listen
very well so so I have people want to
leave oh my god I'm so happy because
usually he's these like floating he's
like a bobber they're like best friends
right now Marley gets something she can
swim with oh good girl
anything if they're all like having a
blast right now
nice and calm right now see this little
fish everywhere though hold on
see you guys can find
wait like you're fishing you caught a
giant fish see you later
you think Marley's got a new swimming
partner now is this gonna chill she's
she's too old for this she's above this
crap oh my god guys this is crazy
that's crazy
you got this entire beach right now by
yourself come on what are you going
excuse me Marley excuse me ma'am that's
right got an idea was super tiny and
when I took her to the park in Tampa and
she would always dig at rocks and pull
rocks out of the water
here's walk down there Joey
not a bird found a bird I finally just
chilling what you gotta do for your
arthritis silly diesel still trying to
figure out the dynamic among Joey and
Marley because you don't sue me Marley
always like play fight so he's like
trying to figure out he's like no you do
it he doesn't get it quite yet he's
understanding it little by little
Marley doesn't handle it
see you Marley see you in Australia I'll
be there a few months when she swims
give it a little rudder going Pete what
are you biting that fish Marley got one
and dropped it a TD kicked in
they're behind you okay a lot of you
guys keep asking if we're gonna get a
pool in the new house the answer is yes
see what happened just like in Florida
getting a pool installed in the summer
is literally I don't want to say
literally insane but close to impossible
that's why it's insane we're having to
wait until about now / winter to be able
to do that so Marley beam will swim
right now she's digging it those birds
have got to be brain dead they're just
like like pelicans you guys ever know
how big of brain the Pelican has it's
like the size of a freaking walnut
google it it's really interesting well
