for the Internet to see when you do that
kind of stuff
hope you guys aren't getting too sick I
just gotta stop that what do you doing
the internet that cannot see when you do
something like that so we talked to the
doctor this morning about what happened
yesterday with the whole like nappy and
I'll speak in the Disney nests
basically what they said is I overdosed
on the vim Pat which is scary to think
about like overdosing on anything you
know what I mean let alone to the pills
that I'm supposed to be taking for
seizures and then it's what sucks what
ends up sucking is that you know this is
the medicine that's supposed to help me
and not be doing the stuff so the doctor
said the only thing I should be doing
today is just kind of laying low and
just drinking a lot of water and letting
the chemicals pass through my body and
then that way and then once that ends up
happening
I think after south-by-southwest I have
to restart the chemo because they don't
want me doing it right now because they
don't want any more chemicals in my body
as it is I'm not doing that again
