Charles is talking to the sprinkler
system guy because guess what something
else did break it's not a happy camper
right now do you guys don't care you
guys are really happy you're like
whatever mom and dad you're just gonna
have to pay $750 for a new pump not a
big deal
though you have the exact same face I
had when he told me we needed a new pump
exact same face not that face the other
one four o'clock in the evening
you know we decide to go to Disney World
that's exactly what we're gonna do whoa
you know I'm gonna be immature I'm gonna
put fart noises now when you do this so
much funny
funnier do you think Marley way funnier
with fart noises
and we love this scenic view from the
bridge because you never really get to
have this view when you're driving by so
fast so it's actually not that bad
really good when your bridge is a
parking lot then you get to appreciate
the bridge
how many bars you get out here so first
off I got you this is a new Gator and
flavoring ooh I'll take that with me so
I can whip you with my meat of course
we're trying to decide which Disney park
we should go to this time you always
seem to go there we always seem to go to
Magic Kingdom because I feel like that
Stephens we believe in magic basically
and I feel like that's the one that you
want to always go to and you go to
Disney I don't know I don't know which
one Russia puts it this time and I'm
sporting their CTFxC ikt hats right now
cuz I found one in my drawer I was like
it's freaking hot and I'm wearing out
his glasses can never get mine
I'm sporting CTFxC in my heart second
giant Clark you don't want to lose it
out
entering the happiest place on earth is
it really the happiest place on earth
though
sardines
it's actually my big good idea
by all means
it's really cool don't worry about a bed
I couldn't find a spot to sit there so
good I couldn't find a spot you know
it's really cool is there gonna be block
you I feel like this could be the one
vehicle that they would actually allow
you to drive this Delaney I wanted to
right now this is the fastest monorail
I've ever been on though
that's sarcasm if anybody Wow look at
the trees flyby so guess who was
randomly selected again to go through
the metal detector not alley this time I
think that's I'm not like God born I'm
three for three right now that I'm
randomly selected we want to know if fun
little fact when he designed the
entrance of Walt Disney World in Orlando
he designed it so this was felt like
super grand but when you're walking back
it felt like super short so you can go
home quicker we actually met a like a
family of CTFxC is really cool people
what's the son's name Hamilton he was
hitting on Ally I had to watch him I'm
gonna talk about it he was blinking
I have to watch out for him now
that's not we were here we did Thunder
Mountain during the nighttime and I feel
like that's kind of like it it's kind of
blast miss you have to do it during the
day we really need to have been or Danny
here so make sure we go in the right
direction
oh wait no no no I remember this because
this is a Swiss Family Robinson house
right over there all right they're not
working now
it only works events here I got so much
money
wish
no problem with this ride is that lower
and lower it snows more and more like a
dirty floor dirty diaper shower degrees
it doesn't look like it's gonna rain
Wow hope that's actually true still
every time you come to Disneyworld it
does rain though so that way
for the scenic off it what
Ali's getting some exercising in right
now well I'm just curious if when we
walk on you see how much walk we're
strapping on that guy's popsicle
frozen lemonades 7 you want a wiener
banana I mean a banana with nuts Ali and
I have this rule on who pays for things
literally we do paper rock scissors and
that's how we figure it out I already
won this is this demonstration right
paper rock scissors shoot they chose
yours usually those rock paper Rock
scissor shoot Paper Scissors shoot
that's how we determine who actually
she gave us some fast passes for free so
we get to just go right through to the
lines you want to tell them expected
mothers cannot ride yeah not going to
get married first
