easy I'm just an idiot I got to say
today is one of those days or one of
those shows where I was just sitting
back behind the drum set and just what I
showed you guys for the lights those
were like moments where I just like
remember that I freaking love my job and
I'm so privileged and honored to be
doing not only the music stuff but
YouTube and get to talk to you guys all
the time so YouTube as well so tomorrow
what we're going to do is we're going to
get on a flight for North Carolina to go
to South Carolina and then what we did
we actually got smart and we looked on
the map probably should have done that
right and it was less time to drive to
where we need to go so we cancelled our
flights and we're all just a road trip
down to South Carolina for tomorrow's
show and then after that I get to go
home like every single day I hope you
enjoyed today's video and I will see you
guys tomorrow as always good night guys
