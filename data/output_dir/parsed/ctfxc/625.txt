was the first time ever Ali wants to go
to the Apple store and drag me to the
Apple store I was get really nervous

because there's new computers they need
to update the computer for blogs or
cameras
there's something something as simple as
that would probably your wedding dress
would name
very simple okay
not my mom for me shoes that's our thing
you know
I'm not a smoker
headlights balance the Ginga was another
way though those eloquent lights and can
thumps how many euphemisms we can have
up with the boobs
that need to say titties are Kappa
it's a nice little summer dress I like
it the curtsy good on your skin tone but
duty do I like it that's even better
yeah for this one in my opinion I kind
of like the ones little flowers on it I
drop something walked or is coming up so
close I think it's like one day thirty
days maybe in that I've been like
stocking up trying to find all the
comfortable stuff that I could get
always uncomfortable or the toy rushed
it is everything so hi guys remember
that one year with bus broke I figured
that'd be nice and comfortable for the
bus on top of stuff from the stage so I
got some shorts every time I take my
medication and ever
I was like super freakin weak
very much as much the alley

yeah just get some food

of a rhetorical question I apologize

my shoulders okay one in the car yeah
we're right there in the car
during my own study but when I'm like
driving down the bridge try me it falls
off we are I actually terrified
all right I was just looking at like a
news blog and the headline was 72 new
emojis coming for the iOS they're
dumplings salad a sled the curling stone
because that's that's definitely in the
knees the curly
has there ever been a moment where
you're like I need to express myself
with a curling stone you have no idea
what that is that's one of those where
you slide on the ground
and they do the room and they sweep it a
sandwich there's not a sandwich on there
I use them sarcastically what is your
favorite emoji and if it lets you type
it in the comments I want you to put
your favorite emoji in the comments mine
as of now let me go my favorites there
those are my most used emojis I guess a
gun with the I don't know how use the
gun that beer he's got the TV and the
gun that makes sense maybe does the
internet kill TV getting some donuts
just because save that for tomorrow what
was that laughs are you losing it okay
it was perfect timing though I like hit
there's nothing left
all I got to do is make a fake day and
then use doubt thing was that one donut
you shared sit down that the donut you
sure
hmm they was not the right one I'm a
drone three miles that one little donut
to national make everyone unhealthy day
my taking 45 years so this is the thing
I've actually been waiting to show you
guys for a long time
yesterday I teased you guys and said I
had to wait till something was done so I
don't know if you guys remember I tried
to create recreate one of my favorite
all-time drinks as a kid it was called
ecto cooler it was in the 80s early 90s
for the original Ghostbusters it had
Slimer on that the front I tried to
recreate it it tasted like absolute
garbage mm-hmm in there there we go okay
moment of truth the good news is no
matter what this is gonna be a win
because I always never had it take the
cooler Slimer smells like a slammer do
you put anything in it you put sugar in
it what's awful I basically was
bootlegging my favorite drink and 80s so
long story short they did all these
petitions and they actually recreated it
this is not a sponsor I'll be completely
honest this is just my love for this
drink as a kid why don't the wig it was
completely cold they sent me this giant
box it looks like one of those things
that and Ghostbusters whatever look
wait pheasant do that exact and then
opens up and it gets the ghost but it
has the drink in there this is dumb I
know super dumb I promised them that if
they sent me something I would stop
bootlegging my own version so they sent
me this and I've been wait and dying
since they discontinued this is me 80s
or 90s or whatever was oh my god it's
gross oh my gosh that's nuts
I didn't get it closer oh this is
actually pretty freaking cool this is
like Slimer
I feel it Oh Marley you can't eat this
sorry ken maybe I don't know what it is
got it there you go good job the moment
of truth I think you should go for the
old school I think older I think they're
both equally as cold because they've
both been in the refrigerator
alright save this for later yeah don't
worry don't offer it to me I don't does
it taste like you remember I literally
just got blasted back to like middle
school right there that is weird
you know like one like smells remind you
trying to be a rind you have certain
things taste I guess as well you wanna
try it
sure oh yeah remember that
can you remember like a time where you
drank that last this might seem really
stupid to a lot of people I know it is
really stupid because it's a stupid
drink it's actually blowing my mind
right now we can just okay don't drink
it all don't drink it all hey you know
what you used to do like when people
would be drinking it like and you go up
that and squeeze it and then they'll be
drinking it like normally and then
somebody would be sitting next to me and
I would just walk by and just squeeze it
and just go in their mouth it's kind of
a jerk I know something else did that
don't I like a Capri Sun we'll check out
the slime it's not food
yeah sea-doos
oh shoot I did actually Oh Marley no no
