so speaking of coffee cough sorry I'm
liking reading the Sun right now
speaking of the coffee coffee coffee a
CTFxC her name's John seller compiled a
saying coffee coffee coffee amongst all
the vlogs over the past five years into
a quick little montage video it's
actually really funny I'll put a link
down there in the description but it's a
little CTFxC bonus video right now it's
46 seconds long so you guys have no
excuse so make sure you go check it out
and give props to John in the comments I
think it's about time I patch this up
get some ventilation down there all
ventilation bomb wait are we on TV
that's funny you get those cool lights
but that is the Edison ones yeah those
are awesome lights like I'm literally
the words that just came out of Ally's
mouth is that that is cool really so I
guess this is kind of cool I think I'm
having a nightmare right now I'm stuck
in the past or I have no idea where
anyone is
ooh what's your treat this is cool
I just call down
Lauren
I don't know I lost her the way I always
hides toys and food in her bed like we
always have to like vacuum it out so I
was driving a little phantom around the
neighborhood and I scared one of the
neighbors when she was driving her bike
I was actually following her what is
this I was following above her on the
bike so that she games they're talking
and then there was a nut how old was
that kid 11 then there was eleven year
old asked to come on tour with us should
we bring him with we the Kings I don't
know he's a punk rock kid co-lead the
Jameson look at it no what is it
this is a giant spiderweb why would I
want to see it anyway he was pretty
adorable though he was like you're that
rock band right I'm like yeah I play for
we the kings he's like a I go on tour
with you and I'm like how old are you
and he's like 11 I'm like no I don't
think you could legally be going because
I was in his position I probably would
do the same exact thing maybe he'd be
the next Yoshi or nerd Rock I don't know
there's only one nerd rock all right so
once this is done charging I'm going to
do the unthinkable and I'm going to fly
you guys over the pond I'm going to do
it I feel confident enough
hurry up
patience is going away
I think it's turds enough that should be
enough ready for this I'm gonna be a
like in Amelia Earhart but I'm not gonna
do what she did I'm gonna do this but go
and conquer this we haven't named this
