actual wheatgrass really so this is just
an embarrassing video today

is what I found when you guys are gone
so three years is what we gone in like
three minutes now and Marley wants
around with it show you and then
hopefully it down and go right to me
but Marley wants to eat it such a dick
Marley hey she's out of breath right now
say I only have a little bit of time I
gotta eat this before it comes home holy
crap we're watching 90s commercials
right now and I was blown away I feel so
old right now right back oh if you guys
want a blast from the past look up 90s
commercials on YouTube YouTube has
everything I have five more minutes with
that dude can you hear her all right
maybe we should think of the way now
slow down dude that's a big bone this is
why we can't have nice things guys we go
for a walk
when I go for walk does that mean I have
to get up it's so comfortable
bird dog alright so we're going for a
walk
apparently moose have found my socks

front of my face whole frickin time
dammit it's definitely a freaking hot
day to be walking right now
those was Warped Tour is gonna be like
got a river board shorts Warped Tour the
one thing I learned from last Warped
Tour is board shorts no more jeans you
good back there looks like the entrance
to Jurassic Park by the way guys did you
know they're making a dressing Park for
I can't tell if I'm gonna be doing
stopping I can't tell if I uh I'm
excited for it or just kind of bummed
out sometimes I stop it so a rooster
what is that bird
this suck suck I can't cave and speak
right now it looks like something gonna
find an egg you've got to stop doing
that
everything in there well it's empty
nothing worse than finding an easter egg
and thinking you're lucky and then it
finds out it's nothing in there it's
pointing with my emotions
aftermath good you guys won't mess with
me so I can pack tonight so this is just
a random thought that I'm having right
now there's gonna be dumb do you think
when they invented the Rice Krispies
cereal that they had the intention of
doing the snap crackle pop or did they
just invent it and go well and then see
that it was a snap crackling popping
dumb thing I think of the dumbest things
mmm I was just thinking of something
else it was always so funny my mom would
never let me have really sugary cereal
chewers give Rice Krispies for Cheerios
or something like that
but then I would always would grab the
sugar and just push a load of sugar on
it so it didn't matter anyway anyone
else do that tell me in the comments I
definitely know I'm not the only kid I
thought that we have a couple shows in
New York and I think Pennsylvania I
actually forgot about to Pennsylvania
when Tom posted on Twitter and the
complete fun little thing speaking of
shows if you guys aren't following me on
