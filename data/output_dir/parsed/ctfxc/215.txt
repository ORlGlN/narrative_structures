good morning guys so that's gonna kill
me one day I know that's gonna kill me
there ma'am you guys that negative food
we'll be right back
can my coffee right now not until word
last night we decided Vista pull over at
a random Flying J because we didn't
wanna just surprise on every truck stop
in the country now we honestly just
thought it'd be kind of stupid to try to
like check in campground it like
midnight it just felt like a bought you
here a little cheaper just to go do this
yeah yeah and it's a little cheaper so
resize this will do the smartest idea
Mac no that felt very well
you know what I was just thinking back
in old colonial times like helpful had
to do the board the buggy the completely
insane
here probably like one
yeah and your ops we die
you get dysentery and then you would die
Oregon Trail that's all I pretty much
know about traveling the country exactly
that's a minor detour where we're gonna
figure out the best path
wannabes he went up into torsos turn
back in Florida and out are driving
process and analyst Laurel
why little learning curve is amazing on
top of that being spontaneous we don't
know where we'll get everything done in
the two weeks that we have so we might
extend it to three weeks
who knows everything's up in the air
well no trip
how could the road getting super
beautiful about where we're at right now
you don't have scars it's not as past
like three one why we my pen is pretty
bearing we wrote like right now we're
going to high ten towards with and
Pensacola flash Callaghan and I remember
having to do this Heather I are we
already went through it with Phil type
and I remember I can be the most boring
highway or interstate ever
eggwin Sorby never learning inside
grabbers you eight miles per gallon
right now so it's not terrible
considering we have a Holley
yeah
yeah I mean it I'm even if - like four
dollars a gallon this might suck but
right now gets relatively cheap right
here in the same we're bad I don't know
I think what we're going to try to do is
we really have no plan but today we're
going to route yesterday we had screwed
up on but we didn't really get much of a
travel day so today we know we left like
three or four I think four so I think
today we're going to really settle to
the metal and push to get where we want
to go and I feel like I feel like that
won't matter
yeah it's still annoying I'm going to
lose my mind instantly no idea like what
we're going to try to do is there's this
cavern in New Mexico you might do that
first and then we might hit Roswell then
go up shoot up the Colorado there shoot
to Utah that may be moving on we don't
know we don't know that or hydro water
chase
there's so many plot that's why we try
to climb ability to support morning
animals of doing
now that we're probably spending this
real pills brushed and we can kind of
take our time because the map I'll show
you guys next to I showed you the
beginning the video the math had a lot
of things we do know about
yes
now very very important friends
yep bitch day hi
we have resting bitch days
the door this well overhears using a
board truck drivers should the mommy
drives Mary - you liked it so much
I look some people hug in a tunnel right
there's a joint for you no matter how
can issue ha do it you're doing it to
make the echo my turn to shit all the
time
I swear to you I swear you best movie so
that's why beards are so easy now
or is this mouth come from
one under water my family in the desert
then the other adventure to get their
kapok physically lock your door Wow
another State Fair bud high-five you
slipping and sliding over there okay all
right he's going to get our water I
think Zoey get a tail right up your legs
right now I got my new co-pilot

shut up I want to go back to the head
30 I got the back coming up little
I said wanna show
so zoey is just sleepin away so so huge
so snuggled up so far the actual table
turns into of that because all she wants
to do is be responsible this actually
makes it so much easier and then this
lunatic she's like mama take your jacket
and Emily right on that's all I want to
do I am pretty amazed Oh
well the doctor cooing I don't think
these but they did pursue and just like
driving in a RV like Rosa to me probably
because you do feel everything to Harvey
really
I'm adjusting to it but let me tell you
what she doesn't look like she's having
a difficult time 3 doesn't like senator
full-time and neither does he
it's Ricardo yeah it helps out a lot
like a bus driver goes back yeah it's
just learning how to sort with it then I
come by like you're driving down the
road like a big semi or like a plus or
something goes by it almost makes your
car kind of go in it or I cannot explain
it this yeah that's the reason we go
it's kind of like a suction very
interesting is when I was the one thing
I was trying to warn him about it goes
like designing so here's the army and
here's the semis so go ahead put your a
down
and
this one keeps trying to sneak over
there might get up to do something yeah
yeah
evil
I can't move my boobs
but happening
just like true nature of Tor do it yeah
you're losing your mind then you can
and no way got to do a late-night
Walmart stop last night do the thing is
with our D you're not really supposed to
run a generator all night it's just not
good for the generator so you're
supposed to turn it off every four to
five hours just a helpful FYI if you
guys are ever going to go to try an RV
and take a road trip don't overheat your
generator that would be bad so I had to
cut waking up in the middle of the night
to turn it on and turn it off we decided
today would be a good idea since we're
getting the hotter speed get like a fan
that's sort
you're 30
I guess I've no room early to talk
all right we just like the total bus
driver is waiting for us and Duncan is
currently getting pissed we're taking
too long there you are you hit the once
part never affected what's wrong with
you I feel like I have been locked a new
cage we can't technically spend 14 hours
in a cage since today we pretty much
dedicated completely to driving so that
way tomorrow when we get we're going to
New Mexico tomorrow right that's why
we're going right now we're in Texas so
that way tomorrow
when we get to New Mexico we can
actually start our vacation flash I
guess the road trip is really kind of
started but I mean actually doing some
cool stuff we're going to go to a cavern
I think tomorrow I think it's called the
Gladwell hey what was what's the caverns
called
I can't either it's on the screen right
there those caverns right there we're
going to go to those caverns it's one of
those ones that we didn't have anything
planned and I just kind of looked at an
old school classic map and that's how I
found it old school style no GPS no
Google search just straight-up looking
at a road map but this is not hiking for
today
hiking in front of Walmart I was getting
a little bit of cabin fever so she's
been running around Walmart where she
goes
cabin fever strike end of today day two
we got kind of lucky right now that's
all I want that's for the pooper now we
got kind of lucky we found a another
truck stop because tomorrow we're just
going to wake up super early but we
actually found a free hookup so now we
want to run the generator so we're a
little bit stoked about that also I
actually wanted before I in the video I
wanted to ask you guys this playa stupid
question but what do you guys think
should we extend this thing for another
week like should we think the road trip
go three weeks instead of two weeks if
you think so let me know in the comments
I feel like it's a pretty much a
no-brainer question but I figured what
the hell advice would ask yet it's
actually perfect I didn't mean to do
this I still want to say thank you to
Lazydays for making this happen
and allowing us to do this
as I said this might happen a couple
times in the videos for the next three
weeks just because I just want to show
my appreciation for these guys they're
amazing they're supporting us they're
allowing us to have an amazing honeymoon
and you know show the love right that's
how I feel no pun intended that were
actually at Lowe's right now where's the
cable and all these cables are on here
somewhere so the trip has been going but
tomorrow is the first actual day of not
having to drive a super amount we have a
live drive early in the morning you
you're killing it I've been killing it
she's a little truck driver yeah so
today we drove 15 16 hours now we got a
good chunk out of it now it's just a
matter of getting to the caverns
tomorrow early you remember how to do
this all right guys I'm going to go help
right now so we don't get electrocuted
have a good night see you tomorrow bye
hopefully
you
