your windows at night all right we're
secure deeds are gonna
we gotta get back in there could we
actually got to go and switch hotels now
not because of this because I don't want
to switch hotels out or not do what we
did we just did it because we all want
to say we're trained percent
professionals for professional idiots
and we didn't see any sign saying we
couldn't do it the windows were actually
not lost usually you can not do these
things because they're locked so that's
kind of why we did that I know it's
quite incredibly stupid but you know had
to do it we thought it was part of the
boardwalk part of the hotel right
