little bit we got on that plane almost
missed that one because I was like the
last person on there and they changed my
flight my seat on the flight I felt
something else last minute it put me
next to this guy was you know really
insisted on drinking I guess and had
like four drinks on that I saw like a
seat and I knocked it down on him and I
mean rest of the guys and get on the
flight to Chicago which I hear is 23
degrees which is what I guessed
yesterday I'll be honest I'm feeling
weird this medication is supposed to
help me makes me feel super weird every
time

favor all these favors be my least
