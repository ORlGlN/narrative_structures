morning guys so I just have to show you
how Charles gets ready in the morning
now that I gave him my little one iron
this way
I was always opposed to blow-dry my hair
and how I got to be doing it like my
hair just naturally stays out through
there
what you just do it wrong all the time
and then you just have a leak coming she
does it for you
secret plan
they're so clunky up by yourself I got a
little 2 volt Encanto
Wow bring my face very we get very here
no guy has a lot of power there we go
wait I need my armpits other one
excuse me warmer so Charles is a
practice where whoa all right kitty
belly oh she's mad okay all right
I don't belong around cats well Charles
is at practice we're all just kind of
hanging out with my parents and the
doggies are over here playing with the
cats as usual his cat hates me so much
she totally hates me Coco she's like let
me show you my butthole as I walk away
but all I think that's the first time
ever I'm the last one here I think this
is the first time ever it's gonna record
this part wait wait
is Danny here headhunter hundo mondo
stop buddy and Travis all right I'm
usually like about two hours late I got
here and I picked them up Koli sat in
the backseat of the Jag oh my god that's
a fail for me so Cory and Yuki and I are
going to buy a Charleston your underwear
Victoria briefs or boxers oh good oh
let's not give it all away you know
let's keep them guessing
we got to keep the mystery alive and
well that was part of the allure watch
me get hit by a car in the middle of a
parking lot I've rode a country song in
28 minutes
I don't have speed looks like things are
breaking everywhere I see
he's crashing down on me
do you like the slide guitar now whiskey
out the bottom
you're my favorite thing when my life's
too tough to handle I handle you sleep
huh down on me and I just wanna hear you
that even when there's no hope
come on ships that we fill late start
Gared rocket slide guitar going I didn't
hear eagle soar and where's your dog and
your girl nothing about a girl and being
on the porch I was going Nate good Ryan
good everyone's doing well Danny
you know I was in surgery on that shirt
you took me straight to surgery that's
the shirt I wore in surgery yeah
you guys didn't know we're gonna be
bringing back Kings carriage this this
coming tour because I know a lot of
people been wanting to get that back so
Danny's gonna temporarily stop vlogging
and bring back Kings carriage or did I
just ruin it for you you did you became
first announcement so I guess I just
broke the news Danny will explain all
that for you guys tomorrow in his vlog
if you guys didn't figure out this is uh
where the hometown show is so lot
cleaner right now
this for people to chill while we're
practicing I don't know if you guys I
mean I don't know if these are popular
anymore you guys know anyone from the
90s I used to have a thing of like 20 of
these hanging from a ridiculous keychain
contraption on my backpack and I got so
excited when they made a dr. pepper
flavored one that was my all-time
favorite one I think that's still pretty
popular actually today but this is cool
this is like a bunch of different code
flavored ones good times I've got to
show you the road case the nerd rock
bill it's all one piece now this is nerd
rocks domain they built that by hand
making the boys walk down the aisle of
all the feminine products
ooh stuff you've never seen before oh I
don't know why that's such a funny thing
although I still do get embarrassed if
I'm like checking out and I have like a
box tampons and the cashier is like an
under twenty year old dude I'm just kind
of like oh nothing to be embarrassed
about it's just kinda awkward
now witness Yuki and Cory harassing my
mom weird hats on to find a bad bathroom
don't think you do the work Wow it is
then the hero 3 plus Duncan stealing
work with some father
they were practicing Hanukkah puts down
so it's obviously been a long day we've
been here so far about six minutes well
five hours and five five or six songs
done which it takes a long time because
we're figuring out the whole you order
of the songs and how we're gonna play
them because we're kind of rearranging
the whole like how you hear it on the CD
and not exactly how because you'll
Travis that's hands-down my favorite
song in the record right there
Danny and I are pretty much begging to
play this song and it's coming this tour
so you have to come
let's preserve his voice because they
know when you go on a long tour so we
have to play the different keys to
preserve his voice so it lasts the whole
tour so we're figuring out that and
adding cool little things like at the
heading of sad song so the whole band
can come out and so it's not just like a
you know piano and acoustic it looks
like the fun part of Zoe hi she
literally just bit my face she literally
did you know because she doesn't close
her mouth when she's happy what are you
doing
