possibly see animals mark the grass is
taller than you dude ma'am okay hello
friend
it's definitely try to get a closer
today so you're just taking over bud and
we are now officially leaving
Yellowstone
goodbye is that honest
beautiful and I feel like we didn't have
enough time
like obviously we didn't even realize
there's like a thousand no I mean the
big says and it was a beautiful - I was
really really people actually get to
drive by the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone
which we make if you do because was so
far away there is also leaving
Yellowstone high summer moose birthing a
deal is goes for all the blue if you
people
I go I want to take a big Lord yeah
plumber on the floor everywhere of the
first one I don't know what
I don't know though it's usually I
prefer Grand Prismatic yeah no
Philippines
- apart
I told charlie this pretty cool my
question to you guys what was your
favorite part of Yellowstone just yellow
so not the entire trip this yellow
stomachs up these little just once
confident phrase right now they're now
in the Grand Teton so that one's called
seafoam Randy found and I associate pig
dogs and people whatever it is we're at
a peak on whether its grandeur simple I
don't know at the peacock for this hold
on hold on your breath look how
beautiful that is
now you freaking out don't fall don't
fall don't fall don't fall wow I feel
like if I go down there I'm probably I
can really get back up free speed
careful grandma walk just do the grandma
walk down can you guys see this swarm of
I don't know what these are they're like
finish like a school fish but they're
like bugs I've never seen that before
very odd are those bugs
why am I so fascinated by this you guys
probably can't see what I'm looking at
so I found like I'm a crazy person we're
not the only one that thought I was
beautiful
pretty much everyone like almost scared
it off the road they come over here
we're trendsetters babe nobody was here
and then we pull off and now everyone's
here yes this is our spot we created
this spot all our this is the Charles
and out a few point right here I don't
know why I've been still fascinated with
the bumblebees
reference of receipt
oh my god
hell for you yeah all right
just this
Oh
so on our way we stopped here car had a
little mishap and crashes drone
somewhere how in the middle these bushes
which who knows I'll say this is but I
really care
gotta find a drone I will of whatever
field this is because I turned off the
obstacle avoidance to make sure I can
keep up with the stupid-ass car crashed
into one of these things I think it's
right over there I'm afraid it goes over
there though awesome
so kind of got myself in a little pickle
I'm in the middle of all this however
our whore gone girl how the hell do I
get back oh that sucks
worth the shot worth it do it for the
vlogs so I know something terrible
happened with the drone crashing but
walking through this incredible place
doesn't bother me at all it's so
beautiful this is honestly a
truck
this is what's making my trip as silly
as I may sound it's so beautiful
and I just had enough left I love it w
placate we're good
is it destroyed be careful alright
getting a little thick down whoops did
not want to lose another one but no this
was and I did keep stopping it feel like
every few miles because there's so many
awesome views
as always freaking out I wanted to go to
Lake Fontana why else
I'm not going to share to the public
amazing how I'm jerking like a lot of
like really kind of really uh crazy
grabbing a thing she was like now who's
playing things like that
therefore even single month or even
fifth
it's like overwhelming
the things you feel everything this is
why I love this woman she got a big
heart
I'm serious like a coil of you is it so
adorable
it's so crazy to be able to suit
how do you probably forget lucky tell
there are Bell in Wyoming I just
realized deliberate the top-left corner
of Wyoming so we're driving diagonally
through the state and I'm trying to find
some cool things along the way I want to
go check out the Badlands and maybe
Mount Rushmore stuff to fill it up but
unfortunately a goal like this and that
will require a thing like that
we didn't run out of time so trying to
think of an issue I'll show you
they never mind our rip that is
definitely seen better days we're right
about here next to Casper Wyoming and
the idea is that we're probably going to
go we'll bounce nothing
we're probably going to go like this get
away so probably go to Kansas maybe
Nebraska all the way through down to
Florida
so this line I know this is those make a
fence because you can't see much if
there's any cool tourist traps or things
that we should stop at nothing over here
obviously nothing over here because
they've all gone to us but this area to
Florida let us know and that way maybe
we can just stop by not something
the treacherous triangle now for the
biker game bed new meaning good
we just had to stop really quick to take
a quick break and we found this trail
it's called Johnny behind the rocks
Zoey don't move you have a grasshopper
on your back that's the weirdest name
ever it's kind of cool it's got a cool
little rock right there
I guess Johnny's behind that rock oh hey
everyone let's take your breaks let's do
this get some stretching and okay looks
like a little shoe cleaner that's kind
of cool
we've learned that if we take breaks
every you know a couple hours that the
ride doesn't seem as long because you're
stretching you're waking yourself up
going to try to do that a little bit
more we're kind of rushed obviously to
get up here so we didn't actually do
that so we do not move you have a
grasshopper on your butt up now he's
gone I turned around and see what's
going on indeed literally as much--but
literally laying on top of us
well here's a girl though brick service
over here the three-headed dog this is a
three-headed monster that's a myth
Marley where'd you go we're the third
head go alright guys well we are kind of
tapping out a little bit
we had like twenty seven ish hours let
hopefully we find some cool stuff on the
long way right now we're kind of taking
our time don't forget to subscribe guys
and I will see you tomorrow so it have a
good night
this is where we're sleeping tonight
it's just much easier much faster much
smarter
