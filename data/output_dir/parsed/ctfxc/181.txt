good morning Internet it's actually kind
of nice right now so we decided to ride
bikes I get to ride my brand new one so
I'm pretty stoked rides like a dream
guys I genuinely forgot how much fun it
is actually throughout I got nope not
there to ride a bike stunts and tricks
and stunts there we go
it's okay getting cotton there yeah now
do a back flip this is actually really
enjoyable I think I want to do this
every day running is fun but riding a
bike yeah that was an amazing gift I
really appreciate it
I mean running is fun but riding a bike
has always been more fun you can go out
farther it's like more practical plus
this was pretty fast duck passing good
ducks
I was fine one time currently assisting
other colors o my keyboard
like it's typing like it makes you feel
like ha I talking to a robot now I think
the most annoying and patronizing what
did you type there mr. robot we are a
budget big old stain guys a weird day
after the bike ride dropped mascara I
was putting on my skirt somebody wanted
us to throw some makeups like her drag
mascara on my white shirt and I forgot
my wallet
what else can go wrong today and I need
my driver's license luckily have a
photocopy of my driver's license but I
just don't know if they're going to take
that but no I can't believe over a bunch
of idiots I just hope they take a
photocopy of my drawer the person who
knows me watches the videos is more
because he knows that it's me otherwise
we just made a stupid alley didn't bring
her a receipt for her clothes they
couldn't print out my receipt so they
emailed it to me but I kind of shot like
Charles now or I don't always try things
on and I'm just
so email you can log-in an email on my
phone I don't know my password huh
in other words computer hospital and
it's back yeah there's the keyboard some
of the keyboard and I didn't do it this
was not my fault
most of the time I'll give you that so
we just kind of realized between the two
of us we make one person she has her
wallet I had my phone doesn't have her
phone I don't have my wallet well here's
the nice thing is that you get the job I
can't live without my wallet because I'm
always wanting us to drive and heat
God knows can't live without his phone
yeah I'd rather lose my wallet than my
phone that would actually be an
interesting question to survey what
would you guys rather lose your wallet
or your phone like you can't have that
all day you only have one of them I
would say my phone because I have Apple
pay I just don't think that I care that
much about having my father everything's
all in it though got Apple pay guys no

since I was little I always thought this
was interesting for like coffee like
they would make it into like this
perfect square or rectangular it's or
when like your husband and kids are
actually a few discipline wop-wop them
on the head I don't know like there's no
reason why they do that but it's always
like one of the kids like what could
possibly be in there and that was an
adult like how the hell do they do it
yeah a lot of cold brew do what I can't
drink coffee anymore
of course rate when cold brew and iced
coffee becomes a giant thing I stopped
drinking coffee I know it sucks that's

possibility but I've read that cold
brewed coffee
