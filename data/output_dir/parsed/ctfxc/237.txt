Wow gonna make it I think that's so high
on that one I'm not giving up one more
time I'm going to be pointing that
although if we lose it I get another one
it's not my fault we helped just tryna
understand it
hey what's wrong guy what's wrong come
on
so today is the 4th of July
obviously in Ali and I got this really
crazy idea she's found when cleaning up
the house which is fat and sad that we
still have this and guess what it
expires July 1st 2017
so that means let me show you how they
got ok you guys want to see where I'm
going River yesterday we got a bunch of
em 1000 they're not m-80s but they're M
1000 and then dos we get extra wick what
I'm doing today is going to celebrate
with a bang no pun intended the guy
actually told us how we can get the wick
through like and we're gonna go get a
cake and blow up up for July cake too
so we can only do fireworks well it's a
it's a way to celebrate the 4th of July
a different way you know because there's
always fireworks why
ah today we're celebrating our
independence day like I have what was
the name of that guy please somebody
tell me what that was we have a few
people I can't turn my neck right now
as you probably saw from oh those
terrible flips I thought it for sure I
was going to actually be able to get it
I can't turn my neck get falling on my
back I gotta go get some months when
it's tough so to make it safe I got
these extra fuses versus just kind of
doing the whole tying things together so
what I could do basically take it
wrap it around really super tight
there's going to be a test because this
is what I think I'm only going to
probably need to for the gingerbread
house to be realistic Charles's famous
last words good scotch tape to tape the
fuses alright so this is the final test
basically I got throw the wick through
the straw which would go through the
cake or the gingerbread house and then I
have them attached with cellophane tape
diesel you do not want to go out there
buddy
oh it worked so I think it's actually
going to work the only problem I don't
know if you notice it kind of rolled
away so I got to figure out how to make
it not do that but the thing is both of
them actually lit they wanted to keep if
it's in a cake or a gingerbread house oh
by the way you like this little thing I
call it the trolls now like that just
keeps flopping around
it's my little cowlick I guess so just
our luck just before literally five
minutes before somebody comes Ali heard
this big bang and I think oh and the
power grid I think that a transformer
blew like it was a huge explosion and
now the lights and finishing
everything's off Wi-Fi that's crucial
right there for me
literally five minutes before people
come over sometimes we just have the
worst water I can accept it but here's
the thing so if you look
that looks like that exploded right
there our neighbor has a generator so
they're lucky but you can see exploded
up great timing
now the cookie it is untested no hi
so what we're going to do is I put a
hole in the bottom got a straw put the
straw in there and we'll put the m-1000
in the bottom and we'll lay it on the
ground and then we will watch it explode
alright we're going big how many is that
who's looking you will fit oh no the
house knock there already today we'll go
to pick their pack I don't look like a
big bag transformer is theoretically
this will go through here
well now it should've done that what you
really think about he and everyone on
the internet do not do this at home I
had my father would be as parental
supervision okay here's the Dominion of
all the toys that no little burn okay
don't
trust me I tested all this I was very
worried my friend well the good news is
you don't need electricity for this the
bad news is our neighbors taunting us
right now because they have a generator
I don't know if you could hear it but
like I said that's people thing and now
it's raining we're having a great great
old time right now good luck
but here here's a cool thing as you guys
saw I didn't tell Ali there are six M
1000 s in this thing over it be careful
oh yeah that's got to keep that away
from me happy fourth of July
whatever as soon as this rain stops I'm
going to explode this thing alright so
this is the wick we're going to be using
obviously for this raining I want to
keep inside you're playing around oh no
what
well was working waterproof my ad great
girls that you tell us - when G roms
Oreos people what I'll want to be able
to see what what so we got so pissed off
I tested out one of the fireworks
nope not allowed
what do you been doing though okay so we
have six of those things in there as you
guys saw earlier oh yes
six well well well you can't be over
here you got to go in the house go come
on you put out the fire after okay so we
are sings i buy - the gingerbread house
apparently there are six in one
thousandth is that what it is yes six in
one thousand
yeah I don't know what that means either
but I'm sure it's going to be a bang uh
uh disenchanted two-digit - Jessica
learn my lesson yesterday about not
filming so we got three GoPros we're
going to have a drone
she like stand back I don't know
they wax away get often is often Oh blow
your house down so it looks like you

wonder if we get tapers to the side of
the cake inside Oh what we always do it
