good morning Zoey time to be killer
again come on good girl okay he missed
all right let's go there we go
that killer I wouldn't mess with that so
we've just kind of been traveling and
organizing and moving shit all day but
we just got to our hotel in the city
here it is lovely and I just washed my
butt in the toilet did she walk your
butt in the toilet it's actually so
awesome I haven't one time use the
little butt washers in the toilets in
Japan because I was always really
nervous and I didn't know what to do and
I totally used it in this bathroom and
it was incredible it was amazing
boys are currently super excited because
they hooked the laptop up to the
television I need to show you guys the
view from our hotel room and then we can
go back to the butt wash anything
I was letting bachelor mode getting a
little bit out of control like grape
bowls and drinks right there
and all that paperwork that I had right
here so I'm trying to like D bachelor
mode so that way when Ali comes home in
a few days it's less work so this is a
view from our room and that right there
is the Tokyo Skytree and that over there
is the Tokyo Tower so I think like
pretty much looked out on the view
situation I don't know what to panic
right now but it's the way
I deal with every day
back to the butt washing thing that was
seriously incredible I just you know
it's not weird it's just different
none of the toilets in the states that I
have ever seen have that and I'm totally
down with a warming toilet see it's like
every toilet I have sat on in Japan has
had a warmed seat yes thank you and
please and thank you again so this is a
really cute good like little thing right
outside Ted Baker it's not a real puppy
but it's really cute but Yuki's grandma
was awesome as grandma's are and gave us
some money to have a very nice dinner
out just three of us so excited to come
to this holy toilet a place anybody tidy
that up did you have truffle fries which
is pretty fancy and delicious you guys
can't tell already I really like food
like a lot I was gonna show you dinner
but we finished it just completely
forgot to film it but here's the dessert
a berry tart and a piece of cheesecake
that looks like a little Hershey
chocolate bread y'all come on chocolate
rage at the last restaurant double
eating at you know the one just now just
now that you're just eating at they
forgot to give us one of our orders but
it was kind of late and we felt that
asking them for it again and they didn't
charge us for it so the boys decided it
would be a good idea to just walk about
a hundred yards down the road and eat at
a different place so that's what we
right now oh my god
that is the most terrifying thing I've
seen since we've been here and I'm kind
of half expecting it to just come alive
all that sudden
what did I say about a hotel party most
Awkward Oh No
a joke you ever gotten to see it yet
awesome that's right stead doing I was
like what is this little thing like how
do you play this thing does this fit my
iPod yeah it really is that is so I'm
trying to deep Batchelor the house a
little because guess what it means the
toilet seats have been up this entire
time I don't want to ten scale how drunk

judging you right now on a desktop zoey

a.m. Tokyo time and Ali just got home if
you look you can see she had some fun I
don't see a squirrel friend here the one
thing I keep meaning to do is clean my
closet oh wow my pants aren't done

like that because I have way too many
t-shirts as you guys can clearly see so
I want to donate some update my wardrobe
if you will although I kind of like
wearing CTFxC shirts

still my favorite one so far what's
really funny is that without our shirts
I think I wouldn't have half a wardrobe
right now think half of them are just
basically our teachers as I'm wearing
one right now the other half are just
shirts that were destroyed by tor holy
shit who remembers this t-shirt that is
old school

some older ones who was that shirt

god this is the oldest shirt I think I
ever made

favorite ones too this is like blast
