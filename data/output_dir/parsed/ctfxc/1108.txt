forgot to upload the video before we
left so I'm doing it right now mobile
office guys gotta love it
you know what if you would have told me
as a kid like the kid I wanted to be a
baseball player kid that my job would
have been like to talk to the internet
every single day and upload videos going
70 miles an hour it's kind of like I
just made that up but this happens by
always guess why you guys always have to
keep your mind open accept challenges
and then stop on them
this is Ali's new song I could knock her
all yours no this is gonna be Grammy
award-winning do your balls do your
balls through blow do they took the
lawyer dose don't lie got it I got it
do your balls drew low do they took the
lawyer turn did they hit you in your
back I believe I believe it is a fact no

Danny were and they said they were the
Addai gun alley the Train thing never

around the corner but Murray here found
