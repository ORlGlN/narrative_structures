it's a good day to go on the boat but it
is so we decided today oh wait you guys
are really dirty come on
we decided today that we were gonna try
to jump off that giant building that we
saw apparently you can make this like a
combination of bungee jumping and BASE
jumping so I'm gonna try to make some
phone calls to see if that works from
your paddle why we think okay why
they're gonna bring up just in case I
think they're gonna leave me out on an
island okay you're gonna wrap that chain
around something first
okay better idea
all right so that's what we're gonna be
jumping off of you don't want to do it
yeah we got duck vision I'm taking one
for the team I'm not Josh so you guys
can watch it at home do you guys see
those cables so that's where would we
jump off that
hopefully that's what happens Brewery
yesterday okay so this is Sarah and
that's Jean here for Germany that's even
crazier Danny knows German because of
Danny Travis
all I want to read these on the books so
bad I just don't know
but he probably would like it he's
kiddin swim them
doesn't a flowback
I think we found the first dog actually
in New Zealand hello dog I know the
first one I found actually here other
than the drug dogs

superhero I like how they just put the
cigarette in the mouth see I told you
they just put it in the mouth pretty
close

the problem I always forget to look at
the right side Oh myself in this car
Kalin is going to be our anchor for the
boat because we forgot the anchor back
at the house
let's go up here and I think we're just
gonna chill a little bit because we're
just means actually figured out that
we're not the best fishermen in the
world you might be on certain days but I
think I'm kind of bad luck when it comes
to fishing
my shrimps arrived though now let me go
all right so it's it's safe it was
blinders for people ignoring right
blinkers blinkers and then beans in the
ears and I hear Kenna here and it must
