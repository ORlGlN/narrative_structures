good morning Internet fancy seeing you
guys here we are now in camping honestly
this is the most frustrating part of
work board is trying to find the bus
otherwise you just looked like a lost
child they all look the same I have no
idea where the busses
and I'm gonna ply say that a million
times on these vlogs for what Frankie
and I have the same addiction it's still
hide your face
Frankie's blur price we can't show
Frankie's face so when he's bored he
comes here and just looks like gadgets
just like I did I think right now do I
want to so much work dude these lens
cleaner I just thank you johnson hashtag
dunk johnson so look at who it is
painting that you're gonna go
paddleboarding today and I'm excited
Tom's gonna sit at home hang out with
the cat but yeah we figured why not it's
kind of overcast and kind of gross out
and I feel like it's the perfect time
every day I'm warped or we're gonna have
a personal Polaroid today Camden right
here we had trav every signed it on the
back and what
gonna put it at the merch table every
day with j-val maybe the first person to
get it the only person to get it
descendant one-of-a-kind we're only
gonna be one of these in every single
city
most beautiful part about playing in
Camden did you go one direction you can
see the harbor which is a nice beautiful
scene because you have the giant look
there's the battleship er there so guys
I was think about getting a boat and
surprising Ally and this one was
actually for sale so I thought you know
what the hell it's funny to see the
contrast I take an old-school boat I
don't think it's a war boat but if you
go over here obviously this is a war
boat modern not so modern
I always forget the little things that
are actually in the parks that were up
but sometimes I always say you know
there's only just like a parking lot but
sometimes if you venture off and I
remember entering off last couple years
I always find out like kind of a cool
stuff take out the moat MAGIX gonna
we're gonna take out these bad boys you
know Kailen get it together
I mean it looks a little crazy out but
we have no fear of that leather all
right what do you want me to grab
here we are
that's like Danny's dog like doll
pods where's Ashton very
your Gatorade
for
those guys
for doing the signings right now this is
Kate and she has one of my favorite
things on her body
today she suffers or suffers yes she
suffered from seizures and she had that
saying on her body and I had to show you
guys I have to show you guys how thought
was the coolest thing is she's got the
humor
step down the signing which is like two
and a half hours and when I got that
super dizzy
so Frankie just kind of walked away
and I'm just a big welcome to sit in an
app called we just emptied everything
out so I would take it quick now
that's making everything better because
right now I see like treated everything
I see two cameras sucks this is so bad
that I got one stage in less than 45
minutes so I'm gonna turn this off and
I'm gonna see you guys on stage
great excitement all lubed up newbie up
the way that way it shines when I put my
hands in the air and I like a makeup
courtesy
Danny refuses to walk like the rest of
the human being obviously you see him
walking around right now
to be completely honest I feel like
complete crap but show must go on I was
trying to walk through he was like
grabbing me I was like walking all over
like I haven't been drunk in years but
it felt like I was drunk
barely able to walk a straight line
every time I see it all the time I don't
know what it is about the stuff
relax a little bit more I already talked
to trap
water offstage
and if I do not be concerned that's
going to do
sure I don't fall off the stage Gazoo
and they have to be there to fill
what
I don't care I'm gonna go
because
I don't wake up this vacation makes me
feel
already talked my doctor several times
about the situation
they're trying to get me off cuz
dilantin is like literally one of the
oldest love drugs
it's like prevented in the fifties or
sixties
so we should not be on the market
anymore I feel like they should have
something deal but I think the problem
is that when you get something you and I
were together you have the craziness
that is my life the uniqueness that is
my my I should say
it kind of makes it a little bit play
more
troublesome mess troubles that's that's
a terrible woman you need that's where I
should be living for
but at any rate going onstage guys show
must go on the level warped or the
leopard
you guys I'll see you guys out there
show
hopefully I don't bring leg if I will
get here's the thing if I break a leg
literally in the sense a natural great
way I only hope that I get Dave Grohl's
Mike from
that would be the greatest thing
actually
I started feeling really weird actually
I don't know if you guys noticed how
their first part of the show I was
feeling really weird and then towards
the end I started feeling good I was
running all over the place as you guys
got to see the glasses came off I was
trying to hide my face that looks like a
raccoon
I got to feel like kind of a baby
earlier earlier today like I was saying
that I was having an issue with the
whole medication I think it's because I
did eat I just didn't eat I think right
away
and I exercised as you guys have to see
and I got to see you guys saw yeah you
guys got to see get the privilege of CBI
exercise so you saw me exercise and I
think because of the key and everything
I think i overdoing self but that we did
the sign language was two hours I think
hello few days hotel without me telling
you right now if there was anything
along because probably can't I'm pretty
good at faking it on finish like not
faking on stage that's a terrible thing
I'm pretty good at having fun on stage
so so it's pretty hard for the woman no
90% of the time I
having fun today it's just very very few
times and I'm not the Laura saying was
at the beginning of the set I kind of
felt like I was in fall off the stage or
fall somewhere like you know I was
running around between the the risers
and Danny's drum stage and I go back and
forth there's cables
I don't like you can see that it's kind
of hard to see go to a show you can see
there's always cables running around the
stage
and I'm always pretty good at skipping
over them that's usually why I'm
skipping around rabbit today I kind of a
little therapist loved doing that
a faceplant what am i great for a viral
video at any rate all of trying to say
is that I have a really bad day at the
beginning I shouldn't say bad day I had
really bad couple hours and then
no show must go on I always believe
thoroughly the show husband this is my
favorite outfit
Travis ever wears looks like he's
fucking going to the Catalina Wine Mixer
right Danny said we should put the
helicopters right here no I think it's
the greatest outfit in the world
right now
I'm not knocking it I'm just saying it
reminds me it's a lot like you're
knocking it
by your friend you're my best man and
I'm just saying I appreciate your style
I had I had to break that out you
actually get married yeah it's like they
poked my head
so quiet right now
but it will call Ali on FaceTime
get your beautiful days
you've been sent my attacker run me over
all I gotta say is technology I don't
know how I'd be able to do all this
touring stuff without being able to see
and her stupid croissant on her head
every single night
anyway I'll see you guys tomorrow as
always don't forget to subscribe and
have a great night say goodnight
did I go we will go find a truck that is
a Spanish truck and make them fight go
hit lemon to make him lemonade is that
persuasive
