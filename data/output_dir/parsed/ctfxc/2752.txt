what you said okay what are you fiddling
haven't had a war since beginning of 39
this gun shoots a thousand rounds a
minute you do the math you're looking at
about 20 rounds as things
Wow so you're suggesting that I need to
quicker no I'm not I'm just giving you
some information judgment I just nerd
alert nerd alert
he should be a finish to me from 1932
Finland has had a war since 1939 it's a
thousand rounds a minute you're looking
at 20 rounds a second
she's a 9-millimeter and it is really
fast and awesome there currently is a
son like you
yeah that is awesome and it is an
excellent zombie killing machine I think
he's doing some damage to those pretty
little eyes and the brain that was such
a nice pair check it out
I just Roy to that zombie are you guys

pretty cool that was pretty sweet how
about you what are they doing for you

touched the barrel on that logo yeah

pretty non-toxic frangible ammunition
bunch of gun-toting hippies recycle the
brass we do not use recycle brass here
47 stands for automatic coalition akov
1947 the guy that patented it
47 stands for 1947 the guy that patented
his birthday is like a big-ass holiday
in parts of Russia Rico like one of the
most resourceful inventions ever anyway
what that means is that they have taken
other pumpkin companies are taking that
patent and move them on to make other
ak-47s none of them are Russian some
from China Bulgaria Romania you name it
they've got it they are not limited to a
certain caliber either there you come in
seven six two boilers you're shooting
two to three she was shooting at two to
three ak-47
where the hell okay hey when I was born
they told me that you would know I had a
premonition that that would happen
my line is complete I could die happy

happen in attires are you can slap it on
there oh that's a good shots though
I know it was like a shock wave gun

guys hang out with you probably can you
can try have some visitors go go to the
gun store and find those guys Jeremy and
