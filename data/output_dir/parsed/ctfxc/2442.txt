telling the comments for shame
it's so funny they're like when I was a
little kid and I wanted to well I guess
not get drunk by the pool but when I was
a little kid and I wanted to go to a
pool I didn't have to go to a rooftop of
the fancy hotel I jumped the ropes
the guy was tackled me are you saying
you think I'm sorry that we're all
touching with the ropes that's gold
right there so gorgeous
as it goes up into space

I have Gina recording so I don't look
like the weirdo at the pool so that's
why I wasn't filming myself I was hoping
