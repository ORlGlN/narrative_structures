the other oh there's another one and
make it toothpaste this hygiene is key
going to Scranton Pennsylvania so you
know what that means
I want to say thank you to the CTFxC
here for making that this time got to
keep the tradition alive
but I got the serious live going on now
just like an old man huh Jarrod's here
huh huh so many more buttons I just
walked on a different bus that was not
my bus that was not my bus now time to
go to bed okay good night you want to
see my awesome find
Miko ready ready for this don't have a
cow man like Billy just gonna stolen
like two days in the warp tour
he was what gives these are factory like
mothers eaters many familiar
Marie
if there's one thing about you guys
doesn't matter it makes things a lot
easier
except that my coping this
shake up the shitty things and make one
done
so nerd rock and I are going to find the
bathrooms and by the way this is so I
remember this place vividly I don't know
if I ever told you about the story but
this is the one where Travis pooped in a
bag of the bus which is a big no-no so
but so he wrapped it up at the bus right
off the bus
and roll back slowly right back to him
it's actually one of my fondest war
moments they also got an email saying I
fell into the hills there's a lot of
rust rattlesnakes I guess oh my god I
remember last time - right - son of a
bitch I'm gonna make sure the video
uploaded because last night I uploaded
in the middle of the night and it's sure
enough Zak so I'm gonna force myself to
go take a nap
real play till like 7:00 we got a deal
guys dr. Torres
my mom said she pulled me off the tour
if this happened again and at least say
she kicked my ass so I'd actually don't
know which is worse and what pray tell
is the reoccurring theme a warped or
Charles can never find his fucking bus
that is doesn't balance pretty well it
takes me five seconds to turn around
there please go ahead
timing okay one two three
yeah I don't snap your neck sue keep
going just go yeah that's still pretty
awesome how long do you think this in
the last about if it busts it is - 45 -
okay
I would like one Santa would like one
so trabb's done now Hondo is in the seat
the seat defeats the hot seat
put some cats on there what they don't
even know what it is not in the original
picture but it's the perfect shape for a
cat head that would be really funny if
you put a cat and like the back of the
background I think you have to do it out
hunter it's a cat made out of a pop-tart
let's listen to the song how it's
missing is a unicorn horn
you can put one alright guys between my
mom Kaitlyn and Ally I have to go take a
nap I've been ordered otherwise people
are gonna start kicking my ass so I'm
gonna take a nap before the show I'll
see you in a cut so I just woke up from
my nap and in a very very unfortunate
way I thought I heard some weird things
going on the bus I walk out I'm like did
I hear poop on the bus and everyone does
confirmed
somebody has sleeps on the bus
drunk out of his bus you sleepwalk from
his nap slut walked out pooped in the
toilet left it took all right guys it's
time you're ready for the show
I just took a long nap like I said
between Caitlyn being on the bus my mom
yelling at me and Ally Helen at me I
have to do what they say otherwise I
guess the doctor said if it happens
again they were trying to threaten to
pull me off of the tour which not
wanting that at all all right guys let's
do this
ready for it transition is not working

black bandages
