completely serious Wow

what to help our little story okay
here's the bad story so this is why we
were like going to blogger fan when we
got off the flight
it's I was like okay where's our next
plan making flight and it said f-14
sexually sub sorry it's a G 14 and for
some reason we were in F terminal
I just thought us that F 14 thing was
because I was like really sleepy so we
walked the f-14 so I walked f-14 and see
this is why I kind of thought since
coincidentally there was a there was a
flight to Seattle the same time at f-14
as G 14 so we're sitting there waiting
for f-14 waiting for at 14 gets
cancelled we leave at 1 a.m. to get on
the plane or try to get our plane and
they're like oh you guys should have
left at 9:30 yep you guys can put these
together now wrong gate day one
with more
we've hit them again so long story short
we waited on a broken plane they need to
what have we learned
Charles is impatient life lesson look at
everything on the gate
if it says g14 it's not at 14 I was
really nervous to tell you guys that cuz
I was really embarrassed so I waited
until we're going home to tell you -
where's 8:24
