this how much would that suck if you
were in there and nobody said anything
just like some cruel joke that like
somebody made to make sure she drives
got it
vanilla ice
baby fingers are stupid they're like a
wave for a minute you can do it too it's
ready
you got that freaking claw that's right
about that this is vanilla is a symbol
of ice ice baby
it's hard there's getting rides don't
let the good looks fool you look great I
love it
first things first since we live
Starbucks on location you have to find
Ally the local coffee you found it
all the bees the honey
put me in a cliche Joey we're gonna play
this show got a beat agree and then
we're taking a plane home for the day
off gotta be nice
that's why grace freaking yeah
jokowi funny
now
ah
bring it
oh my god
Oh
that's like
it's called Sunday breakfast or brunch
and we got some syrup and we'll put on a
hash brown
that's a hash brown I know I thought it
was like french toast in there I don't
know what that is Chris showed me some
fever
then I was wrong
you look bad well maybe you should
frees up either no no what
my bus seen a couple days
therefore it has so many of the pokey
stops they really are look at all of
them their ports loaded level eight Mike
that's I don't know if that's a good
thing or a bad thing
now you're like addicted I want to know
which some VFX here is the highest level
in the comments tell me what level you
as if you're playing the game
admit it it's how we get Ally eventually
G what
17 others focus on no focus on where we
have to go baby so on that last flight
Ali had to sit at the front of the plane
in the middle seat and I got stuck on
the back plane in the middle seat and I
wanted to tell you guys a little bit of
a story and I hope this is kind of
encouragement for enable you guys on a
plane was in front of me one of the
servants wife with his ten month old
baby and the guy would not give up the
seat to sit like two rows back and so
much I float hundreds of thousands of
miles in just the last couple years
given my seat up so many families and so
Delhi I don't care if I'm sitting in the
middle seat as long as like I don't like
I don't like seeing my family's being
split apart especially like it was a ten
month old baby so I hope any of you guys
watching this video please if you ever
see that kind of stuff I know it sucks
but just kind of put yourself in their
position just think about like if you
were being separated from their family
or for example if you were terrified of
flying for example she was stuck at 21
and I was at 41 so she was terrified the
whole time and we didn't even ask
anybody because we didn't want to put
anyone through that situation I guess
the lesson is don't be an asshole
be kind there's something everyone's
already stressed out flying
that little coming stuff just as you
witness makes things even crappier so
otherwise ELISA Kalyan you yeah she's
beautiful
looks like you've got a new friend I
believe his name is thank you
that's really long I guess happy I'm
home
alright I think I sure I stink like a
bus
alright Internet oh it's so nice to
honestly be like literally am i king
this would be the perspective of the
hallway of the bus actually this is
actually more now I go all this we're
happy to be home
he's let's see you guys tomorrow good
