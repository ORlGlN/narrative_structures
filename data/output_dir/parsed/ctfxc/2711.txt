hey you yeah you right there right there
did you click thumbs up yet yeah I'm
calling you out
mm-hmm beer be getting a haircut much
better now I don't feel like a hobo you
know what the most frustrating part
about getting a haircut is like after
you get a haircut you have to take a
shower otherwise you have little bits of
hair like all over your face see like in
my ear so it looks like I just a bunch
of like dirt and right here but it's
just hair like Marley but good news my
car is done it's finally fixed fixed
we'll see what they did they didn't
replace the bumper what they ended up
doing is covering it up I guess filling
in the holes and repainting it so I want
you guys to inspect this with me so that
way I have some witnesses I'm gonna go
pick that up I got drop this just this
cover you know what's really funny is
this car the entire time has smelled
like smoke even though it says no
smoking like right here that didn't
happen
it is dizzy I'm sorry it's kind of
almost dropped you does this look at my
car now before I kill you right before I
kick this car back I gotta felt the the
gasoline but I don't know which side
yes Gor all right so according to the
paper we're gonna take them to the car I
had three eighth of a tank of gas is it
bad that I don't want to put too much
gas in here see what we got
I put 12 dollars in high five okay she
just got dunked in the fountain I'm so
sad that I missed it but I heard him
scream from behind me it might be her
birthday that's a tradition at FSU you
get thrown into the sound on your
birthday unfortunately I will never be
allowed to what allows you but I will
never have the Gloria for taking in that
because my birthday is an old summer I'm
never here for summer turn so unfair
also you've never met my friend
Christine here she is hi Christine knows
it I space I love it
we're just chilling outside our
classroom waiting for our exam we had an
exam this morning we were both very
nervous about it not sure how it went
I've spoken Spanish forever but this
class makes me feel like I don't speak
Spanish so we'll see how that goes I'll
let you know it's my car all right see
what they did see what they did see what
they did it wait a minute they were
supposed to replace this thing
what oh the good news is I can't even
tell where the holes were that is pretty
impressive huh wait is that normal why
is this popping out like that that isn't
flush well looks like this screwed up
they were supposed to replace this the
guy said and this isn't normal right
there so I talked to him and apparently
they forgot to install the new parts so
it is turning into a frustrating
endeavor basically that bottom part is
not right and the top part isn't right
so I have to bring it back on Monday and
yeah so anyway I'm gonna tell you guys
the insurance company that I'm dealing
with the person who hit me is using an
insurance company called USAA apparently
it's a small type one based on my
experience with this company they have
been rude
and they have been a pain in the butt to
work with really annoys me how like
frustrating it is to work with any
insurance company like you pay all this
money for them and then the fight and
then finally the day you need them you
have to go through like an hour of phone
conversations
if callback people they say they're
gonna call you back but they never do
like the guy said he'd call me back once
he found all the information
two days later I had to call him back
and still haven't heard back from that
guy so I don't know that insurance
company has been the worst the best
insurance company I've ever been with is
State Farm they've always been very
helpful they have bad commercials I know
that bad commercials but they've always
been really helpful based on my
experience with this I'm very displeased
with that particular insurance company
and it's it's annoying it's very
annoying I mean why do we have to have
insurance if we pay all this money and
then when we actually need it they're
like no well yeah you're not covered
we're not gonna give you any money I
know you'll have this we're not gonna
give you the whole thing no no we're not
going to make it a patent Vance alright
I'll stop rambling I want some coffee
but I'm afraid to go to that parking lot
again maybe that girl's just like
looking for me and gonna hit my car
again in positive news it's great to
have my car back actually you know
what's really funny I call it I've never
named my car never been the type of
person to name my car so I'm gonna let
you guys name my automobile
so whatever name you think is
appropriate for my car tell me in the
comments
hey girls do you like my new haircut
barley you don't like it
is it scary see what you would look like
long hair okay I'll take it you'll like
it
this is actually the wig that Zoe was it
what was it called it was the Nintendo
Wii sucks where Zoey is doggy Jesus and
Marley's the doggy devil this is
actually the wig Zoey
first I want to see what it looks like
on yet Oh eat it destroy so you never do
it again and clean up your mess
so when I first came home I was trying
to figure out why they were acting all
strange and I walked in here to check
the video and yeah looks like they got
into whose packages this from Bethany H
yeah so Bethany eh looks like the dogs
decided to get into your head sorry
that's the thing is guys if you can try
not to send food because Marley I swear
can just she just knows there's food in
there and this was like perfect for but
she doesn't look like she ate anything
she just destroyed things so uh thanks
Bethany
I think Marley is feeling a little bit
better I wish you guys understood the
fact that you need to clean that up so I
don't have to do it alright Easy Rider
come on
so and the request of you guys I went
and got along the problem these things
is that I guess one of these little
things that holds the camera now so I
can pay attention so it makes it a
little bit easier to
when I'm driving the automobile and it's
safer this way and I'll have the holding
karatbar anything like that I can just
two hands on the wheel you know nine
o'clock and 3 o'clock because that's the
proper way to drive and now I'm safe
yeah she still asleep
I was asleep I'm going crazy got us to
do I can't see where the cameras
pointing so hopefully it's pointing at
my face and I congratulate follow like I
think it is you tell those truckers
Sally's teaching me out of Spanish
there we go
three
what am I even saying
I'm gonna give you part
I'm getting a new car today
a single
well if it's like saying see a deal
expensive
I'm not saying car so car oh is it car
it's expensive
oh yeah that's a change that's how you
say chicken and Spanish guys oh yeah
so if you want if you want to say that
you are beautiful you are so if you want
to say somebody that you're very
beautiful you go boy puta and then they
will fall in love with you Spanish with
Charles you will learn something today
teach me some more Spanish lessons
how do I say I would like a banana
I didn't get to work what was that
so fast she tries to teach me say what
you just said just humor me how fast
yeah did you guess
okay Sierra
what a banana you see there
I would just point to a banana sympathy
yeah I can't I can't follow this he's
trying to thank you see coming back to
this whole reason why you just watched
five minutes of randomness is because
Ali's trying to teach me Spanish so when
we have kids she can speak in Spanish
and I can speak and American I can speak
American and the thing is I don't want
my kid speaking Spanish and myself not
understand what's going on so she's
trying to fill me in on the Spanish
language anyway so we're almost to

half left and then tomorrow
