here to help me focus the camera and so
I don't know how to do it and I usually

usually do it on Wednesdays but I just
have been super behind I've just been
trying to get a bunch of stuff done as
usual you guys always know that we're
chickens are the heads cut off and I
have a million people calling me and I'm
a million things to do and Charles is in
here and I'm just like oh my god I'm
still in my pajamas I need to get going
so that's what I'm gonna do I'm just
gonna like go I'm gonna go like this
I'm just gonna leave my hair like this
and just go out in public and see if
anyone will help me and keep all
carry-on luggage down that's saying a
lot when you get off the plane and the
stewardess just looked at both you and
you guys were how do we use left
proposing I'm kind of bummed I was kind
of looking toward having some snow when
I woke up this morning I looked at my
forehead you see this from all the tape
and everything I know exactly what I
said but apparently I'm having some sort
like a skin reaction so it looks like
somebody just punched me in the forehead
all right so I've had to adapt a new set
up today for cinema because my office is
currently like in shambles because I was
painting in there everything's been
moved around yeah I don't know it's
looking like it's not gonna be bright
enough hi I like your hair

awesome they're doing better than I will
be oh boy oh man I could totally do that
just don't want it right now
I don't like skating with Scottie to get
out there yeah you remember doing this
last year and then snake totally fell on

Chelle Rae oh man I can't believe it's
been a year already they're showing you
up behind you

okay I can effortlessly skate and text I
think that's that's pretty good I can't
do that
we're trying to get scooter to learn
something good right can you jump
that's pretty impressive all right we're
all going forward we go skews going
backwards there and back so what we're
doing do something impressive oh that's
I know I was like a plastic
showoff I was always hoping for a fall
on camera
that's fancy right expecting console to
be in one of these things
I mean nerds oh man okay we talk
big-time oh I found out how you can do
this on your computer
Danny you're playing it too right goal
you want to play I playing ball in the
cup this is so cool

Danny has been knighted at one point
coolies born in 1985 apparently oh there
I tripped and fell down a well
attacked bike was a window wouldn't the

mouth is about yeah

it doesn't hurt surprise
I want the honey bacon in the Lord
- good that's a fine-looking skateboard
oh hey honey bacon
I switched hats
head-banging ban we just came up with a
billion-dollar idea queen on ice come on
Freddie Mercury my name is nerd rock
this mustache it's gonna go
I know it's Movember but it's time that
you guys are awesome
you're dedicated I love that about you
it's been a crappy day for me to be
honest I don't like to be negative but I
mean I I don't know I'm just going
through a point right now not in my life
I don't want to be that dramatic but I'm
just going through some stuff personally
and Charles has been you know really
instrumental in making sure that
everything gets done and so I just wanna
you know cuz today I was pretty short on
footage I just didn't really do anything
that interesting today and I think the
person who really deserves the credit
not just for today but for a lot of a
lot of other things is Charles he
doesn't know I'm saying this the truth
of the matter is that Charles has a
drive for this job and for so many other
things in life that is unmatched by
pretty much any other person that I know
he will stop at nothing to make sure
that you guys are entertained and to
make sure that you guys feel good at the
end of the video whenever there's a day
where I wake up and I don't feel well or
there's something negative going on in
either one of our lives he still pushes
through I mean the man had a brain tumor
eight months ago and he's still he's
going stronger than he ever has and so I
think today the secret phrase should
just be Thank You Charles because he's
given you guys and and me such a great
thing to look forward to every day and
he's just a really powerful person I
think that he doesn't ever ask
for anything I think that we should give
it to him just for all the hard work
that he's done over the years and just
trying to make you laugh because he's
pretty good at that well get emotional
anyway so I just wanted to say thank you
honey I love you and you're an amazing
person you do so much every day I'm
gonna cry so on and the camera hock now
I just miss Charles it's been a crazy
day I have you in the palm of my hands
oh hey she says I'm awesome huh she says
I'm awesome
that's your wife she's my Marlee they're
pissed well now I got a thing connect to
you guys I'll see you tomorrow
it's Pamela it was a long day by the way
is this still here that's still there
does anyone have any ideas on how to get
rid of I don't know
all right well I'll get some sleep back
to wake up in three hours again
