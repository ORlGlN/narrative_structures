mmm mmm grads after drop it
Ali Ali I broke the camera broke Ali's
camera again broke it but I dropped it
well Internet is time to go to bed
I just want to say thank you guys for
watching the video hello from the future
anyway so I was editing yesterday's
video at the end of the video and I kind
of felt like I was giving excuses a
little bit at the end so I wanted to
kind of re Reese say what I wanted this
because you want 3 a.m. you can never
say something perfect what I was trying
to say is when the CTFxC started it
started with the anticipation of filming
my everyday life
good bad sad happy amazing boring
whatever it was that was the plan and
because of doing these videos because of
you guys and sharing my life I've gotten
to do some of the most amazing things
that I never thought would ever be
possible that's one of them right there
but sometimes I got to remember that
can't all have crazy amazing days
traveling the world doing all these
insane things and then sometimes I just
got to come back to reality
oops there goes gravity but the reality
is I'm just a normal guy normal guy and
this was the camera but I'm still
filming my everyday life so the last
couple years have been quite an
emotional roller coaster all those
emotions all those feelings have been
said to this camera me about this camera
because I've broken so many of them but
a camera whether they made it to the
internet or not they have been spoken to
a camera without that I feel like I
would have gone insane basically what
I'm trying to say is you guys are the
cheapest therapist I've ever ever heard
of these videos started with the
anticipation of just filming my everyday
life like I said and lately I put so
much pressure on myself to make sure
that these videos are constantly
entertaining because honestly if you
really think about it these videos are
always crazy it would get kind of boring
I'd be bored of it it just gets
redundant and boring so you kind of have
to have those reality check those back
to reality things that make those insane
things more and more special I'm trying
to do this guys without rambling a lot
anyway so I guess what I'm trying to say
is thank you guys and now I'm gonna back
to the video don't forget to subscribe
you guys are brand new and we will see
you guys tomorrow as always doodles
doodle
this new girl can I take a selfie
ooh
camera
a little bit ball getting on my plate
please go over there so not sure if you
guys can see it but this is what the
window said to my hair the weather
tonight is just insane so you know that
moment
