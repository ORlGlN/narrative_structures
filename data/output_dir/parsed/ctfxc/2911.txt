okay you know what I was just thinking
about someone on my Twitter I tweeted
about eating Girl Scout cookies for
breakfast was just really good by the
way
um this kid in ireland said that his
friends gonna send him some because he's
never had them before but i was
wondering are these really that special
like if you didn't grow up eating these
would you like them i don't know if
they're like the best cookies in the
world like they're really good and I
like them cuz it's like this oh my god
once a year you can get them and they're
amazing but like are they really the bad
grade of cookies like I've had better
cookies I feel like so I don't know I
wonder if someone from faraway lands
would appreciate them as much as we do I
was just wondering about that
straighten your head
