it's rough is out there searching the
waves no nose boy from the wrong chair
little mini grounds kids we're learning
things you hang ten brah it's kind of
funny I caught more waves when his heart
like big busier and rougher out than
when it was calm shirt gotcha you ain't
got one it's focusing
since it's our last night I wanted to
make sure I showed Ali the Opera House
and the bridge and everything at night
because I think it looks a lot nicer at
night or just a new atmosphere I should
say by the way I just found on this trip
that little thing right there is called
Luna Park it's like a little amusement
park thing can look at Coney Island
oh that about it there yeah but
apparently it's closed every day until
the weekend so we weren't able to go
this time next time we're in Australia
though no I like it so much better at
night
so Ali and I haven't really properly
celebrated our engagement together so we
are going to do that today
trav engineer with Kinsley yeah Travon
Jenny are having their romantic family
dinner last night and we're having our
romantic engagement party
everything we love us because we've done
it really invited two people what we
haven't had a chance it's the first time
we actually got a chance to just
actually go out and do things and even
tell them the boat is moving Danica how
fast do you think it's actually going
though super funny well right now is
that having parties in quiet
when it's out in the water wheel on the
back and local businesses if you fell
off that thing you had done
I would literally say a tappa size for
that bridge probably
there's so much more like
about every emotion ever in the handbook
all in one like I created a new
Ali's first time he's ever seen a
kangaroo
like the enemy
like just jumping in the water today
only Kenny
they're apparently the season a perfect
season to come bungee jumping in
Australia which I didn't know that
existed but that means we're just going
to go bungee jumping when we got back
actually back at home feeling which is a
flight away we're not doing that
but this was
that's a watch this that's janessa this
is the greatest moment for both
I really was shocked
I was almost hi oh yeah I don't know if
we actually said that you guys Ally to
keep it fairly neat of Lisa and get to
Australia we didn't know that so
literally as Ali was driving to the
airport I had to buy her of email
wouldn't I couldn't get my ticket home
my phone and they can print it out for
me makes it then there was a reason for
they were withholding it from me because
so as you can see me knowing what I was
going to do freaking out the whole
freaking time purge is freaking out
because you couldn't get on the plane
gonna be something works I walked up on
top and I go don't worry I have my visa
I did good man everything else kind of
fell apart real funny Jenny called me
