I would only give you this the only
thing working against us is everything
we're gonna actually get I was just
explaining to Ali like when I come to
the beach I'm like the opposite of most
people on point being on the sand just
everything about Stan just annoys me
most people go out you know I'll sit and
get all the Sun and things like that I
burn very easily plus my ATV kicks in
now I would have to do water even though
I'm terrified of everything that lives
here like if you really think about like
all the crazy creatures they could
actually be living in the water
I'm just swimming along I always think
of the jaws poster you know the one we
like the girls swimming and then there's
Josh looking right out about the either
faith so I just wanted to come up here
and get some Sun and of course I don't
know if you can see him in the
background
I can't get chart out of the water ever
honestly Memorial Day weekend usually is
kind of a bust here it always rains
something bad always happens and it's
been awesome so far in July
yes so sharks
