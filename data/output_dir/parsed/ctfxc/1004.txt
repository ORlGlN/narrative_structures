all his disgusting slobber I was in
finest alligator I just went and got a
few things at Nordstrom's because girls
let's face it every once in a while and
guys you need to treat yourself to
something new and one of the biggest
people that I know that does not ever
treat themselves as something new is
Charles so I went ahead and got him a
new pair of board shorts which I think
that he's gonna be very excited about I
literally didn't buy myself anything
unfortunately but that's okay because
saving money is a good thing but do you
think it is okay that every once in a
while you do buy yourself something new
and reward yourself there's nothing
wrong with that I just went to the gym
kind of had a really productive day I
think that chars hanging up with the
girls getting some work done at home as
well I have to say getting up early and
getting things done really pays off
because
the day to do whatever you want there
