this came out of nowhere my back porch
is flooding looks just like a friggin
waterfall coming down I just had to jump
in the pool because there was a bobby

drove into the water and then

I just never do it so I was super
excited oh my god you can't do tricks on
it so we're playing rummy cube here and
this is this game gets ugly it's pretty
funny it's basically like you just have
to make runs and sets of different
colors and then you can kind of
manipulate them and move stuff around
but it gets so confusing and I'm looking
at crap right now so hello you're doing

it's been really trying you know being
away from Holly and Zoey Marling's
being away from home for so long but I
mean this experience was
it's you know life like
once-in-a-lifetime thing or hopefully it
maybe not maybe not but I just it was
such amazing time
think about all the crazy things we got
to see you guys got the seed in the past

play our games just think right now and
tell me in the comments your favorite

later it was really cool it was amazing
experience and you guys have been
supporting us the entire time even with
