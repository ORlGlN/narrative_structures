french fried potaters hey guys good
morning I'm so last night since we had
the spider incident and this was my room
right it's California king bed I gave it
this year because I didn't want a spider
going in my mouth when I was sleeping so
I slept up there in the cold but it's
day to day I was gone um this is what
happens when you get a bunch of
youtubers in the morning everyone just
sits on their computers except Jess
except Jesse it is so beautiful out here
I really wish I was feeling better good
news is surgery went good actually went
perfect
and she's back to normal so I'm gonna
have her explain a little bit more what
happened and all that stuff when she
feels a hundred percent better but good
news is she's great

I want to walk up a hill I just walk
backwards I find that easier than
walking forward I can't be the only one

message a couple people wanted to say hi
