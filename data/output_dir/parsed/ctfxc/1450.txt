good morning guys good evening guys
smart like you looking away from me
I'm not stupid you sound like you're
gonna throw up every single time you do
that you only do it the alley huh
welcome to day two and eHome we are
adding and I am really excited about
that gonna buy some nice clothes yeah
whatever
they're not underwear their inner shorts
make your own green tea at the table
that's so awesome
okay at the table like a sushi place
that's a conveyor belt sushi which is
awesome and the last time I was here I
think that was with dot at one in
California but we were also at one
o'clock Yankee in Hawaii creamy latte
and a can baby welcome to Japan
and now we are heading down to the train
station I'm gonna hop on Starbucks wife
I've got the coffee and I think we're
gonna go to an arcade or something a
little bit more like in you know the
centralized area Tokyo cuz we're just a
little bit outside it right now with
Yuki's family we're really
fight it all right so chest and I are in
Wonderland right we're in a toy store I
think we're in LA cheetah I know this is
the tiniest claw machine I've ever seen
okay I'm gonna get ripped off in Japan
ready I'm gonna try oh yeah
all right let's see if I can get one I
want to get that one in the back get
your bed good is it it's good
come on come on come on
oh I don't look you up the Santa Claus
one good even in Japan you get ripped
off with these things so this is
something I've never seen in my entire
life
Goku speaking Japanese I've never seen
that because I've always watched the
American novels so he's gonna play this
game it apparently it spits out a card
and then you put the card on there and
then you like like you slide them up if
you're gonna like chromosome and they it
reads the back of the card I don't
exactly know
just put the car down it reads it and
then if you move it it moves the
character
you can get like figurines like little
toy there's like pretty figures
so I paid to get phone underwear for my
iPhone so let's pop these on real quick
you see how they look charging hole
somebody tweeted me a cool little recipe
for a cauliflower pizza crust basically
make pizza out of cauliflower and
totally I have to try that cuz either
you guys know I love pizza wait how did
I end up here
this is not where I need to be it just
naturally gravitated there by the way
you like my snazzy no shirt no we're at
round one which is like an arcade
you can like it's like you're in the
cockpit like you're the pilot of a
gunman soon
you can standing in one right here let
me show you here you pilot let your
Justin this is amazing it's like a
panoramic view
hey youtube check out so now we're at a
totally different level of seriousness
in terms of claw machines this one
you're playing for food I'm not just
fooled ice cream
come on now come on Oh it's things like
that that age-old thing it goes like
this again and then it goes
so Yuki with his mission was he was a
superhero there was a truck that was
coming and a punch the semi truck out of
the way
gotta warm up a little bit
yeah go
going down
all right buddy you ready to fly we
haven't flown you in a while I pretty
much figured since Ali's doing all this
crazy Japan arcade stuff I'd combat it
with my crazy technology crap where are
you return home no you're coming home
better not lose you
hell yeah this is what you get when
Charles reads the instructions
ChIP chip be in the house hurtful it's
not your time all right so what you got
to do first is put the cauliflower or
how I like to call it the albino
broccoli into the food processor so we
can grind it all up all right so now we
got this nice little albino mush and
we're gonna cook this with a little bit
of water for about five minutes
ish now you gonna let the damn thing
cool but thankfully it's cold outside so
I'm just gonna put it outside for a
little bit or open a window
I put outside squirrel-friends gonna get
to it isn't he we've been working that's
going 15 minutes
No
you're not gonna dumb you all the way
back
what if it hooks the plastic and then
tracks it off
this is one of these things you'll get
so mad you get so mad at it and it's all
your fault at it and then you know
you're not gonna win
come on fun
oh so I won this gigantic bar thing and
I was trying to win these choco babies
look what I did so it turned out like
that I turned it on its side and then it
didn't fall like I should do that
I'm the skill-shot do you guys hear that
do you hear that
alright you don't hear that because it's
the quietest subway system in the world
Jessa and I were talking about how quiet
it is compared to New York New York is
like so loud Molly this is like silent
when it starts it's so quiet
that's really good nothing in New York I
friggin love New York but this is just
like a totally different experience I
should be listening but I don't know
what you say anyway so okay alright so
the next step is gonna require muscles
your manly or womanly muscles because
what you got to do is but nevermind this
it's this from T it's not poop or
anything like that so you put the
cauliflower paste or mush in the center
cool don't do it when it's hot otherwise
you'll burn your fucking hands you don't
want to do that don't be stupid
let it cool so you put all the mush in
there and we're gonna squeeze the water
out basically I should probably make
this smaller coming out that man
not that manly smells like Bo the
cauliflower mix we got then we add some
Parmesan little goat cheese and then we
add an egg and a little cayenne pepper
if you want some spice sorry sorry a
lies somewhere in this world facepalming
right now I apologize
alright so the goal is to take this
sludge and put it into like a nice ball
put it on parchment paper on like a
cooking sheet and then we're gonna like
spread it out and make dough like spread
out like pizza you guys not a fucking
make a pizza what do I talk about what
you guys yeah why am I even doing this
yes I would make a pizza oh hopefully
fingers crossed this is actually gonna
work I have no idea if this is gonna
work in the comments right now play the
Charles guessing game will this Pizza
work or will it just flop where's my
oven techno music going almost a 400 you
can do it come on I want a dance party
that goes dance party in the oven if you
guys are trying to do this based on my
recipe I could luck although I think I'm
gonna do this alright so looks pretty
delicious now we're gonna flip it over
and now we gonna make the pizza Wow
