we're reminiscing about when the bustle
was saying so if you guys don't know
Kevin Lyman is he's the guy in charge of
work for it and apparently I guess it
was a couple days ago he body tweeted
one of the nicest coolest things that
I've ever seen I think ever
as amazing that is cool that is so cool
and that is honestly one of the coolest
things I've ever read here are some of
the nice responses we have a bear rug
downs what you ever wonder what a bear
taking a selfie looks like bears taking
selfies and it's a great selfie on their
fix bear head thanks
alright hold a drink
do this I kick the bear off
hey the bear doesn't have a pass don't
let him in rough him up you barely get
him though I was like doing the Titanic
thing I was literally pulling out the
camera fell face-first
I promised I kept my promise I also
promise you I'm wearing the shirt yeah
who'd you get today new sing all right
Internet got a question for you
old sting when he was wearing the green
in the yellow are you crows
you have no idea what I'm talking about
just Google sting I was gonna get
several thing tell me the comments I'll
be watching you
The Fresh Prince here what does a lawyer
wear to court briefs a lawsuit diapers
said it that was it that was actually
really good diapers back to hate your
butt
there Drock I broke it there doc I need
a tech I feel like Travis gonna punch me
in the face
I am I completely forgot how amazingly
awesome Toronto is how crazy is I think
it's just because we don't come here
often Travis I made you to sign for
every single person took about two and a
half hours the one thing I want to just
kind of say because I don't know if I
mentioned this but I have to do chemo
again and a couple weeks and my doctor
suggested that if I can to not do any
more hugs so he said to do fist bumps so
if you see me I don't want to be rude
but I have to do fist bumps just because
I need to keep my immune system up for
the chemo which is coming up in a couple
weeks so hopefully you guys understand
remember I was talking about my SD card
being dead look at us
I've never had this happen before with
an SD card I don't know things like four
years old so Josiah just hooked me up
with one as we're talking right now on
the new SD card my her selfie dude
you're right selfies in a bear suit
nothing better nothing bear
come on guys we need more bear puns
we're starting to suck we're getting a
little L I could barely stand it
the funniest thing about this bear suit
is that it smells like Travis this is a
good smell if you ever met Travis he
makes sure he smells good guys offer you
guys
so true but you just smell good I forgot
it's a 4th of July here it's so funny
that we always celebrate 4th of July
here in Canada hi
so I just got off the phone with Ali and
I found out she's gonna be on tour with
us from Atlanta to Nashville so I think
that's the 24th through the 29th I'm
really really excited I'm pretty much
greeting ear to hear once I found out
that it's like this
that a grin that's just weird smile I
definitely miss that goofball not the
fourth of July unless you go to a
barbecue so Nate and I are going to the
barbecue America I don't know if I
mentioned this but Cyr and Damon are
here sup fear worth the way worth it so

personally thank him for the wonderful
thing you said the other day Jake comes
our bus and just messes everything up I
