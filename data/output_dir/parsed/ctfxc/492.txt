people with this giant freaking thing
right at one time
was in London Malaysia and those places
where I had the love feliciano case
which is probably three times his size
and it didn't have a meals
the airport here's number that and I was
walking so this is probably an
indication what my day is going to be
like today yeah okay I can do it okay

Galli let's just do a summary what
happened to me today
Walter I'd like first I was late because
of traffic second I couldn't check my
bag my taking my guitar so I've had to
carry that through the whole airport
third expose material all over my stuff
and now for the airplane is broken we
were about to take off and they did this
Holloway that
I'm afraid and I'm so happy - I gotta be
tempted by poor Danny and fully utter
all back to have a little seat - didn't
check the flight before we left to
switch their planes
i govern the easy
maybe I think I'm bad luck at it now
cornflakes my shoes one of those days
where it's just like you can't complain
because you're so fav what it's just
breaking in his samsung galaxy 7 isn't
it coach 7 would have taken flame down
yeah all right well Frankie Fort Bragg
he didn't even have a note 7 here's a
stick they just give them so much tap
for an outlet on the airplane there was
like you have a note 7 please turn it
off and everyone just looks at Frankie
and he literally has a reaction
looking at it and Richards looking for
somebody else's
on it the headset
so
oh good here sure
explain what happened in southwest and
out one and one actually caught fire on
a plane which is terrifying family
HathiTrust and everyone on this plane
I didn't trust the rest of the guys in
the band I hardly trust him trusting let
alone random people turning off their
phones
nobody turns the thought up worth the
wait
I'm sure they do the good things all the
time right Houston just blueberry back
to them
oh yeah to get the glass
we're allowed because when they get up
here they do the same thing
I'm a blueberry now we actually just
wait for the van because Colin is 24
years old and you can only get a van at
25 for some weird reason but you can get
a car at 23 cannot come to California
and not do in-and-out burger remind you

girl with a Batgirl shirt on and so I
put her sign up in the sky in just a
case that this room that's supposed to
