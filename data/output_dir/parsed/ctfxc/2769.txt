you look like a beached yourself hon I
tried to show I'll go all the crabs and
then she found a lizard and a chaser
there's a baby lizard she got chased all
right so today we're gonna actually
really try to test this thing underwater
we haven't really got any chance yeah
handle over here the thing about this
camera it's really amazing like I don't
like to tell you guys about what cameras
begin what you know you guys are have
your own opinions but in the daytime
this camera honestly is really good at
night time any like any you know lower
lower
consumer based cameras they're always
gonna be a problem with low light but
this camera from day and you're shooting
underwater honestly it's pretty it's
pretty good wait so you have are you
recording so if I push you hear about
things being attached like buoys and
stuff to the do it really fast you can
do it out
it's nice and light I'll make it it's
really low now
every day hope you just slide up you're
like a seal like a seal
hey I'll just get on this side and kind
of flip you up it's ridiculous now throw
you off you just took the fun out of it
hi Sophie what's going on exactly they
have to not only wrestle here put the
wrestling on that thing yeah and this is
probably would be the most interesting
part two random ladies they found on the
beach
I'm gonna stop this is so inappropriate
so inappropriate
we have younger viewers the censoring it
out I'm just gonna start censoring this
shark
look at this this is so are they sure
they want this on the Internet
I Love You Man

plague right here yeah I could have been
better
I saw August directly below us that's
her room so I'm willing to stomp on the
foot do it where hey one two three four
so nice
so we're going to find this waterfall
well actually what's the name of it okay
so we're gonna go apparently it's like
one of the views from most beautiful it
was the most beautiful in the Caribbean
I think it's what I heard you know it's
the greatest waterfall in the world yeah
I I'm dubbing this without even seeing
it the greatest waterfall in the world
it has to be - is like where
sorry goats hey that's a pretty good
indication not to go faster there's a
couple goats so we jump down
so we're here at the Falls the homemade
stairs I don't know
this actually really an ingenious way of
making stairs it's like in a mountain oh
there that's as an added touch it's a
road trip yeah don't trip and then grab
on to that look at Nate Dean's blogging
go you're gonna be on YouTube mr. goat
what what what oh yeah I'm one with
nature he's not I was just this touch
him and they just closed I think they
called mimosa plants or they call shy
girl and that crazy they just killed
that plant it's been taking so many
photos at the end of this trip I'll just
have to put it on our website because I
can't go through it all that yesterday
alone she did 600 oh I just want to eat
this yeah there's part of it
bush one Bushman Sifl we care where our
shoes are my rainbows because it'll just
like get swept away so these are the
shoes that I have to wear this must be
the place
hey hey hey hey whoa whoa careful yeah
hold on to the rail that's that is cold
water
oh man oh my god I am so cold I don't
know how you're handling this they have
jumbo the jump then you're on fire quick
what do you do I don't know how the
audio sounds because they keep falling
in the water so if it sounds like you're
underwater just pretend you are
tell me when you go under jackknife this
you just pull a jackknife on that one
we're really testing these cameras
this is where we're gonna see the
Velociraptor you have so much to live
for that heads up in trial and error to
find out where they can go just swim
against the current so Moga swim I got
you Oh
Hey

I actually go see what's under here for
me I think no no that's not it actually
touch it maybe fail plant well so my
betters about to die I just want to say
that was probably one of the coolest
things that I've ever done that was what
my life cue Green Day hi puppy
it's a raptor
oh look it's a raptor yes ginger is so
good so apparently this is real ginger
root
it smells good I've got to say this is
probably one of the most beautiful
places I've ever been
I'm fine Al Ahly Appleseed over here
barefoot they literally just cut those
down to make these that's so cool
Ali really misses Zoey Marley obviously
hi
what's on your foot something on your
foot hi cleaning them don't care don't
dare
they're like Marley yeah yeah they sound
just like our Doug look at that sky this
is part of the adventure and the worst
the worst part is that we don't have
Google Maps so we went the wrong way
right there to freak out out yeah so we
are we made it we gotta give Big Ups to
Nick and Nigel right there no I
seriously the thing is you got us back
alive so everyone's got to say in the
comments Thank You Nicky Nigel because
without them this vlog would probably
not be uploaded it might be on the side
of a cliff somewhere so you know this is
the funny thing we took a wrong turn
because the guy with no teeth on a
bicycle told us to go right we should
have gone lesson lesson learned yeah
don't trust the guy with no teeth always
trust a guy with no legs because they
always know the shortest way that's this
should be today's secret word the secret
word today never trust a guy with no
teeth that's the secret word I like that
one if you have no idea what I'm talking
about read the sub bar it's for a free
camera by sanyo does act evil that's why
we're here we're gonna get some some
dinner the meetings answer their phone
they ran through
stop we just end the night in the dark
by the way I was introduced you guys so
we'll do that tomorrow yeah over there
wait why is there a pentagram in the
middle of this thing
it's a great challenge you have to keep
your eyes on the cigarette
three people on video do that
now you have a new trick at parties
inside

and his fiancee Allie
