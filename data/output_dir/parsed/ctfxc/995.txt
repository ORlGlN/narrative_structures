sorry wheelie out of it I was just on
the phone trying to fix the hot spot we
have no internet here so until like
Tuesday so I think Ali and I will need
to try to mow the lawn here's the fun
thing Ali likes doing it so I'm not
going to argue it it's getting so tall
the grass is stopping the spray
oh shit water unfortunately I had to
take diesel back to the vet because his
ears been bothering him blind intend to
chew on his paws too a while ago I had
to take him to the vet because at a
hematoma on his ear that had to get
removed which was from him scratching
recently isn't scratching his ear a lot
he's been you know chewing at his paw
and it just kind of worries me I just
want to make sure that I can go ahead
and get it checked out so it's not
something bad you know I want to prevent
it from being something far worse than
what it can be so we're gonna go to the
vet today it's definitely knows her it
spot but better to do it than that to do
it well he just got out of the vet me is
it this bad I want to say that he's a
little bit more well behaved but he is
just not a fan of the vet and as soon as
they walked in he was like hiding under
the chair he was just not having it but
he has a little at your infection so got
some medicine and he is on his way to
recovery so you need a cool off dude for
the first time are you ready
like woman just open up the door Oh

peeing on the grass

you guys how Marly stole Diesel's bone
and the grass is super long we have to
cut it today but tell me this doesn't
look like Honey I Shrunk the Kids
you know when the dog comes Ali's mom is
miss fixing
there you go man paper-rock-scissors
all right so Ali is gonna do that and I
want to try to get the the card garage
door working team work guys
I can't fit there this is a bad product
I think I'm gonna have to like take this
out make a good little garage door for
the golf cart I don't know if that's
gonna actually fit gotta figure
something out for my golf cart you can
mow my lawn anything having blog-like
just found a Whelan party like two or
three years weird right guys
look how frickin tall the grass was guys
now if all lawn mowers looked like you I
would pay extra I have an irrational
fear of a rock shooting out at me so I
would have to be on the opposite side if
you go over the poop yet there's food
everywhere I was like sweeping it I saw
you sweeping and I was like there's no
way she's gonna sweep the whole lawn see
now the bounce house is a great idea
right yeah I gotta see this see if this
thing works that's as far as you can go
cuz it's meant to blow blow houses that
lon
well it's kind of working
better than you and I raking
so it's 5:00 in the afternoon I just
moved the backyard and he's moved back
from tweeting I work he poops I guess I
felt like hey you missed the whole spot
you're fired all right I will get the
rake you did a good job set the spot so
as you guys know I don't have internet
the house still I have been paying out
the butthole for like hot spots just to
make sure the vlogs get up because I'm
not missing a day just because the
internet has not been hooked up so I'm
trying to find a rake so I can get up
all the grass for alli help her out a
little bit so I just come home with one
of those how funny would it be if I just
came home with a freaking bounce house
instead of a rake I'm sent to do one
thing and come back with the complete
opposite thought wheelbarrow all right
show Alli what I got break you up is
gonna suck
I should make things fair Ali do the
back I'm gonna do the front feel like
she got the good deal there's something
very satisfying about this right now
and very annoying to instantly
gratifying about lowing Millan
I have less than 50 minutes until the
sprinklers go on then I'm screwed
you're right Ellie has a stomachache
what's going on you have a baby baby
alien you don't feel good mr. 1d
supposed to take care of your mom
Zoe take care of her wait how did he do
that oh crap
so Allie just got a cool little email
she's been working on this new product
for the CTFxC like a new merged product
for a while it's actually been for like
probably months now I want to show you
guys but I want to I think I want to
keep it as a surprise you know fuck it
hold on she's like ten steps ahead of me
something that you guys have been asking
for years
Allie knows all about this stuff and
she's been working on this for a very
long time and it will be coming very
very soon guys very soon since I'm in
charge of food to get pizza for dinner
and I couldn't find Marley luckily she's
right here this is a bad thing about
this house there's way too many places
for them to hide I don't want to have to
always go upstairs if I can find them
all right good girls and boy I wish
drink it there's our boy now worth it I
just gotta show you guys this get that
bottom left little circle I think I
freakin deserved it guys
