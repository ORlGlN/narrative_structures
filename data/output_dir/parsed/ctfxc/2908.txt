well so I just learned something new um
apparently if you try to buy something
here let me look it up I just like
talking to the pharmacist
it's called pseudo this this word right
here micro that word right there pseudo
define hind heart or whatever that um
but apparently like if you try to buy
like a through the Fed I see I wanted to
go sudafed and claritin for an ally
because their allergies are gonna goof
it up um but if you try to buy those
things you have to like sign all these
paperwork all this paperwork because
apparently certain individuals decided
to make mess with that and you can only
buy us actually the government keeps
track of I think Michaels in that little
lump too but the government actually
keeps track and you can only buy a
certain amount of like sudafed or
something like that per month that's
kind of funny actually it's kind of sad
I should say that's incredibly sick then
