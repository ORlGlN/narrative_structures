a lot of you have that's not a very big
area you know what I just realized
didn't the Cloverfield monster attack
I'm New Year's Eve I'm a little worried
no that would actually be pretty cool
baby ride him like a horse or at unicorn
we got through the barricades we
actually had a police escort and keeping
us safe so this is pretty awesome that
is so
look at that there is
our police officer is uh she's that she
knows how to have fun just gave Jesse a
beach ball there's a bunch of like I
don't know a bunch of Jersey Shore d-bag
yeah those I don't know why you were
complaining yeah there's a lot of people
you chose they come down to Times Square
I don't understand but anyway we're
we're beyond we're in the secure area
right now it kind of feels like
Cloverfield does because there's have
you ever seen like New York dislike
barren these streets
look at that's that's ketchup - ketchup
it's ketchup performing over there
Koch kids Hatsune antoine antoine dodson

look at all those people
you say hello to CTFxC just a seat
and the aftermath look at that craziness
you've already cleared out
we go
that's Ally's ball right there
all the trash
what Time Square looks like about ten
minutes after
so that was pretty pretty awesome yeah
so Jesse had a really smart idea so we
were able to film luckily we put our
phones right behind her belt so they
thought it was part of our belt and I'm
really really thankful because we know
to go to that thing and not be able to
take any photos and be able to remember
it you know I really wanted to show you
guys so we did it say again you got to
say thank you to Jesse's like the man of
a million ideas I was brilliant
and now apparently Deena the new cast
member for Jersey Shore alley made
friends with her 2% CTFxC invited us to
go to an after party so we might do that
if we can figure out where it is there's
so many get the whole thing know it's
video you would say hi no why no now
you're on no I'm not gonna stop I'm not
gonna stop why would I stop myself oh
man I really I kind of enjoying this
just blocked off area this looks pretty
bad
I don't know how these people are gonna
think
Oh Ali made friends and they gave her
all the blood I'm like she's like do you
want the Blues that like please do not
give her balloons she already has a
vuvuzela and then Jessie's got the
glasses oh it's best New Year's ever I
