we learned today and last couple minutes
gambling freakin sucks or if you're me
don't do it because you suck at it I
want my 14 cents

when I do this rollercoaster how it's
it's fun for a second and then your neck
starts popping around because of the way
they have everything just like feels
like it's gonna cut your head off very
good

Vegas you got to do it it's expensive
that's the only problem stupidly
expensive just to do one ride that you
go to a theme park for a quarter of the
month of the price but that's at Vegas

cents
