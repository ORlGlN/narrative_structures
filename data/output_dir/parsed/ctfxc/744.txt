so today we're going down to Sarasota
and working on the other house and
trying to get it ready to for sale and
all that fun stuff they're actually
coming to do hopefully before it rains
the actual roof you will go to stairs up
and go for a ride in the car oh yeah
come here come here right away get over
here seriously come on you're such a
punk come on you can go to the other
house this is before the pavers won't be
done until next week and I think that's
what's gonna really transform everything
look at my freaking weirdo
but I knew Marley was gonna do this and
I had to put my sandwich down so I can
get the computer and everything and hold
on I just want to show you what I had to
do with my sandwich great interests
Marley I've known her long enough I had
to put my sandwich in the glove
compartment can't figure that one out
feeling a lot better than I did
yesterday but now I just had this like
crazy pickle on my throat
we decided today that we're gonna go and
work on the other house going on the
other house because I want to sell that
thing and get it done so we are going
down there right now to kind of you guys
can see that it's beautiful
next time i vill see that we get
your thing done hopefully yeah like what
what you want see my family it's right
here
we'll see my time for it's right here to
think about that
I got this down what you want what you
really really want I'll tell you what I
want what I really really want
I'll tell you what you want that's new
oh wow they knocked all that down too
it's still funny when I was a kid
there's always a house right there and
the reason why I didn't remember is
because one day my reason was walking
there and there was a scorpion outside
in the driveway and I've always
remembered that area the weirdest memory
and it's just always there so for vine
land there you're buying scorpions it
was less was a fake rubber remote one
unless Jesse was like tricky me before I
even knew Jesse
we're just waiting for my mom because I
don't have a key to this house anymore
so my dad did the garage was a nice it
looks now he's got to do a little bit of
touch-up painting so I gotta go up into
the attic to them the only one wearing
tennis shoes today actually you got it
all cleaned out which is good oh we got
tile oh yeah I don't you know what I
don't even know what that is look up
there I don't I don't know what it is
I'm not really sure what that goes to
that's tile for inside the house I don't
know what that is
man can you imagine if I was this tall
would you still date me Annie let me
pick you up
do-do-do-do-do-do
bat bat bat yep okay okay okay
you do what you want she was running
around the house and she wasn't
listening so I used the c-word cookie
and the T word treat didn't give a crap
then instead the R word ride and then
the O word that actually worked was the
S word swimming since swimming she ran
right into the house you remember that
one time where I bought the pressure
washer I did this for like three or four
days well we didn't sell the house in
time so I got to do it again got the
hurricane shutters that's what these are
if you're wondering and if you ever
noticed in our videos there's he's like
like tracks with these screws and bolts
you put those right in front of them and
it protects your house from things
flying into your window you never had to
actually use them though that's not even
where it is dude move corkscrewing down
go get not very elegant at all code
Zoe did you just push him in you guys
remember how clean these used to be they
used to be like that that's annoying
come on
I definitely don't miss chasing Marly
all over the place Toby you're into it
come here painting this trim what you're
annoying need to do or at the door right
we're at doing the door right I don't
think so because I think it's gonna be a
lot more done doing the door we did this
wrong it's glossy but only semi
just a little bit actually I find pain
because you paint for fun yeah I think I
think a painting is a chore how about I
just put a bunch of paint on your tail
and you can do walk up and down the wall
you know what she couldn't get away with
anything either because I can just hear
you do picture back there okay the
 feet she keeps trying to sneak
out the door like always
you just put I didn't put paint on you
you literally just put paint on your hat
on the right side oh she's honestly get
no higher it's really late
that's her bedtime why nobody loves me
so we got a lot done today really well
just seems like a minor thing to people
but like we did the trims on almost
every piece in the house 16 pie player
there's some light down there you're
some light over there I don't know I got
really country sounding right there our
southern I don't know what that would be
country something anyways we got a lot
of that time which is very
time-consuming because obviously since
there's color paint in his house you
don't want to mess that up because it
looks really really pretty we just
started doing the trim to kind of slowly
get your photo blurry from the white see
black fur white paint no go I don't know
why this is a funny image to me hmm
yay we just got home
how's it look liking I don't think it's
leaking I think it's just wet
yeah probably is just what this is nice
looks good
well it's leaking a bitch is that done
cuz they that wouldn't be normal that
doesn't look normal
