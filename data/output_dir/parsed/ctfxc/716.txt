so right now it's Ally's birthday and
she's on a plane over here with Jenny
and Caitlin fun little story last night
we got a call from Caitlin telling her
that they wouldn't let her on the plane
so I guess you'd be the visa just to
visit Australia so we hit the scramble
to get Jenny Kinsley and Allie visas I
met Sean bombed if they just like hang
out they couldn't get out here is Jenny
and Kinsley on a plane I wouldn't told
Jenny to go on my daughter
on this flag but anyway today's actually
Ali's birthday it she's on a plane I
told Jenny to make sure she gets some
champagne and just kind of just kind of
chills on plane they're almost here it
should be here when we landed Sydney
which is in a couple hours traveling we
see that ancient artifact right there
this says you are super tourists she
said we are here run up here problem
with this for all of you new
technologies we don't know where we're
at if you go the wrong way don't say
like rerouting so we're on uncle and dad
duty right now trying to get some
diapers his trap you know has a little
accidents every once in a while I'm very
afraid of flying other life remaining
nervous
don't want to inconvenience Huggies
I was love watching tried to this I've
known her for years
and I never I knew he would be like that
dad one though it looks like just is
just correcting me out a brand new IT
it's like me trying to fax something
it's old technology but you still can't
get it maybe the harder you press it
you know I just ruined my chances I'm
gonna sit down and I'm gonna sing happy
birthday since it's your birthday and
I'm gonna have Duncan do the harmonies
happy birthday to you happy come on
who's your flight okay
yep
like the black black socks
you got this oh wow you've got this yeah
I definitely don't get wallet out
oh wait good dish come on
all these little weird little things
everywhere but it's got this intriguing
thing over here Wow
it's weirding my face out
hey Australian seagull been on the
corner and it's that was a big salty but
it's not something she describes they've
been and I were to stay and like speak
other than the Arctic Ocean I think I've
gone in every ocean which is insane to
think about getting all fancy over there
son
yeah we got snacks over here
I don't I don't get it I've always say
what's going on yeah Ali can't do it
that well yeah well you know and she's
really into such a simple idea but it
was so amazing surfers out there kind of
like bodyboarding
look cool sand looks huh now it's done
we couldn't tell if this person is
either a terrible swimmer or getting
attacked by a shark but apparently they
must have fought off the show clearly
clearly if you think this is not a
routine is what you do all the time I
don't know if you guys see all those
awesome girls over there
what they did was we took this photo
with Duncan this photo right here is
Duncan in a freaking hoodie and we
thought it'd be kind of funny we thought
it was funny
we say about society alright guys woman
end the video a little bit early just
because we're about to get on an
airplane to Sydney so I'm just doing
some editing yesterday's video took
about seven or eight hours I was up all
freaking night making sure was actually
uploading so I want to do this right now
so when I get on the plane that can
actually just rest
Ali's actually on the way right freaking
now I just talked to her just before she
left and I'm so freaking excited it's
her first time ever in Australia so if
you guys have any cool things that we
should do obviously koalas kangaroos
things like that please let me know in
the comments because I'm definitely not
an expert at all of Australia I hope you
enjoyed today's video I thought was
freaking hilarious that Duncan came out
with like a freaking hoodie and socks
and everything like that anyway I hope
you enjoyed today's video and I will see
you guys tomorrow always bye yes
slash Australian tour
