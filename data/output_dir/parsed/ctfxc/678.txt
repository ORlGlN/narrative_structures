now it's ridiculous
I had a later flight and I just checked
and they were able to pop me up for like
two hours earlier so over there and I
think I'm not actually going to explain
surprising her
you're the most more surprising the dog
or worse than other than the obvious
about me out here and the
uncomfortableness that helps people is
it messes up your balance to be equal in
the real sound like walking into walls
right now you gotta get this fixed
pleasure to work to temple over five is
9:30 for you I missed you so much stuff
oh here she comes
where's mommy she's sleeping
so it's quite an awesome surprise having
chard come home early I was not
expecting that I'm super happy I'm just
like huh

cuz it's it's been a while so I feel
like it hasn't been that oh my god I
just recently but still I I don't know

let's apply to it dick I'm tired of the
old man ways all that great kicking in

like that comment I just made say
something I said all that gray hair
kicking in trying to pop your ear or you

talking to Danny and I didn't want to

coming out my frickin socket

eyeballs did you hear it you know what

and that's gross dude she just peed
right there
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
if no one has an idea what I'm talking
about with the barf barf let me show you
really quick Oh Miley you're too pretty
girl yeah super cookie go get him
Marley are you over it are you are you
over it
save dad you're annoying
one you see
what happy to be home I can hear ya I'm
very happy okay oh that's disgusting so
keep it with my tradition of when I come
home of doing a walk with the girls or I
like to call it letting the girls to
smelling pee on everything I've got to
say it is freaking amazing to be home
Ali went to go get these little from her
mom's house right now so we're gonna be
a giant family again I didn't realize
how long this past tour was actually
going on until I guess she got home and
I sat down and I was like wow a lot has
changed in this neighborhood even at a
time that I've been gone so I've got to
say the tour was amazing
100% worth it but I have to say also
it's amazing to be home with Ali
Zoey Marley and diesel and it nice to be
normal again
quote-unquote normal even though we
really kind of walking around my
neighborhood talking to a camera which
most people wouldn't consider normal
normal for me was just a normal for me
yeah oh hi guys remember I was telling
you
apparently Luis from one direction came
through the show last night apparently
just after I left
Zach you know Zach our guitar tech went
and talked to him for a little bit and
he got a photo with him just to prove
that it was actually at the show that is
so cool isn't it weird that's really
cool you went to your show yeah really
nice its sister might be a fan of we the
kings anyway he told exactly he liked
the show
so that's kind of yeah that's kind of a
bad that's kind of like a random hey
it's like that's cool but like but you
know what's interesting is I think One
Direction is because zach is younger is
that is like 90 years old
Oh 20 okay still 19 or 20 Zach is like
19 or 20 years old still really young
compared to the rest of guys in the band
so we think one direction to him is
comparable to like our generation at
generation like Ali and the rest of the
guys in bands like NSYNC
no no NSYNC and Backstreet Boys yeah I
think that's what it would be equivalent
to because One Direction was big when he
was younger
98 degrees did you say 90 degrees 90
degree angle and then LFO right yeah
there's LFO 90 degrees extra voice in
sync
O'Town o-town was the other one and then
okay there's there's another one I can
write here what if you guys can think of
any other boy bands in that genre or
that era
of Music's yeah I think late 90s early
2000s let me know in the comments cuz I
can't think of others up I just had it
and just had on the tip of my tongue
what are you doing your pineapple smells
so good
it smells like a pineapple parlor you
don't so close I got it when he was like
really dark green look you could see it
right thing so I keep hearing some
barking and I think it might be Marley
going under the bed again so now she's
trapped in the bedroom mom are want to
hear it oh you're in here so you can
open the door to get in but you can't
open the door to get out she has not
left my side the entire frickin day this
is the fun part you know when you come
home you gotta go through all the bills
and junk mail so I've been doing this
for the past like 10 minutes and so he's
been just chilling they're following me
everywhere and this one's sniping me
over there yeah I see you yeah that's
what's time to go to bed I just want to
show you Ali has gotten the dudes and
the girls and a pretty bad habit so I
don't even know where I'm gonna sleep
tonight because
i what because they wanted to get up
here I didn't want them falling who
created the problem so these are the
funniest ones anyway guys it's good to
be home I will see you guys tomorrow as
always I guess
they keep it like this you know anything
I don't know
