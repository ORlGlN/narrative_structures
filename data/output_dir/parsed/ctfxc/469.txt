yeah I'm like losing my mark
are you so excited you're like the only
one with us today you're the Lone Ranger
Kate and I are taking a walk
we have Marley here as you can see
Marley is with Caitlin and Ally right
now cuz they wanted to go for like a run
slash walk and we all know Zoey's
attempt illegals over here and her hips
kind of hurt a little bit it's just kind
of got like hip dysplasia window up suit
right here me ever since
of course ever since she was little to
me this work ever since she was little I
think like maybe two weeks after I got
her they told me that she would
eventually have more and more like
arthritic issues in her hips like look
at her just look how she's sitting she's
a goofball little ding dong so Ali and I
didn't think would be smart for her to
go for an actual run because we don't
want our later but Marley on the other
hand is just like a speed demon she's
always been a speed demon so I have to
carry Marley right now because she's
getting a little too hot
mm-hmm Walker I was saying earlier this
week that I want to try to like be able
to take maybe like one day a week like a
Sunday you know like she used to do one
take Sunday's I want to do kind of like
a challenge video is Sunday so that way
we kind of have
I'm sorry the stupid thing it's like
distraction
talking window is very cutely
heids up so you ready to go thrive
hey hey driving the car
I like that she looks back at noon
how're you doing now
so
hey I think if she looks back into it
how're you doing now
hey guys so we're here with another like
game challenge day so this is one
somebody suggested to us and I found it
at the store it's called boom boom
balloon or something like that by the
way let's address Ali's hair right now
this game is really simple obviously
there's a balloon and it probably is
gonna go boom and you roll it this is
too so you would have to take wherever
you want to go and you can divide it up
you have the two notches basically you
have this dyeing it has the numbers one
through three on it whatever you roll
whatever it lands on yep once you think
whatever it lands on that's how many
notches you have to push in now you
don't have to do it on one particular
thing and divide it all around exactly
you can do one here two here one right
there or whatever whoever makes the blue
pop the other person wins and if it pops
while the other person is waiting to do
the other one the last one who touched
it touched it not touch it did it wins
there you go Oh loses that make sense
then game is so simple and I think as a
complicated everything so let's just
start camera Rock Paper Scissors shoot
always do scissors no I know
you got to do the dice to roll the dice
person who is going to win which is half
team charles team ally because I always
got three so you can move it anywhere
you want to go and it's got a click into
one right just push it in yeah and it
should pop like click that one click it
won't let me do it oh that was too poor
you don't do this I can't even push it
in it's nerve-racking
one really scary one that was like this
oh my god like this I'm like explosion
start so that means you win which you
didn't pop like pop she just like lesson
he's real sad now so round one is face
whose face that really gave me
I just clicked okay I'm like this so you
get that's yours that's my that's one
click immediately sorry I have done
honey one great nothing
one two three
Oh Danger Danger
one two three
it was little fish just one balls two
balls three yeah I'm like that means one
two just because the waiting thing Janek
this is just so intense see what it did
is if this gas rates really stopping we
should leave that as like a battle wound
should I blow it up first before the
doesn't yes ladies faces through another
corner just for you don't have to
obviously but and then just wrap it
through there that'd be one more time
they say put a stick in it did you take
it off you do it again you gotta go
first again they're not all these people
go about he's looking so scrunched up
three kind of a plan that if you kind of
work it out look at this oh guys three
is it I'm gonna win the game I like look
at this it's just got the guts of the
balloon just it dangling now this is
really I like this game my heart
look how much it was going into bloom
and what it may have been three oh yeah
I know I just remember listening to it
in my head yeah yeah it was three
how come I'm screaming every time
this is doing dude this is so intense
one it's like it's not like scary it's
like one of those it's just unnerving
it's like anxious if you have anxiety
don't play this game
