good morning Internet this is Seoul I
got punched in the face well I didn't I
saved a baby from a shark in a house
that was on fire I fell over
not for real though I just actually fell
on my face during a seizure if you guys
are just watching this video brand new I
think it's kind of getting better though
I think the glorious beard is kind of
like covering it up I think actually
this is your eighth obviously doing the
No Shave November on the CTFxC and right
now we are in 1212 days this is what I
get twelve days in oh eight more days
until the album comes out - so whoo and
by the way really quick if the album
gets in the top five just like last time
I will get the tattoo of the album cover
because last time we did it I told you
guys I would get somewhere somehow and I
totally did so this time if we get in
the top five I will get the heart
tattooed somewhere maybe on my heart I
don't know
be like the CTFxC heart so if we get in
the top five again that's what I'm gonna
do we got top three Marley gonna get
tattoo if we get in the top three you'll
get a tattoo right shake oh you heard it
first I'm just kidding so today we are
playing a little game called boomerang
Ali is misplaced her eyeglasses
basically pull the Charles and Danny at
this point and I'm trying to help her
with the whole finding process but I'm
kind of like playing along the lines of
the whole boomerang effect you know
where you just don't care and it'll
always come back because I think it's
been like 80 or 90 percent for me it's
actually worse it's also kind of an
interesting day should have happened a
long time ago but today is the day I
actually canceled our cable completely
in the house because all we're obviously
do is just you know use streaming things
and you know like Netflix and YouTube
all those things so I just knocked out
our cable which is hilariously it
because I couldn't get out of it it was
actually the problem for the longest
time but now I can get out of it so for
the same price of cable that I don't
watch I was able to get internet speeds
of 150 150 megabits per second say
actually cheaper but market November 12
cable died in us
sold so I feel like a complete idiot
this morning well I was up doing I can't
find my glasses anywhere and I can't
even remember where I put him down
honestly like ever since I was sick like
things have been so cloudy and oh my god

people that I can trace my subs back and
find something half the time that he's
missing something or he can't find it I
can always find it because I can't find
my glasses right now it's like driving
