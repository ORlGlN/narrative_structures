high five for cutting it close I
probably just hit you in the face and
the Internet face smells weird in here
as you guys know today is April Fool's
Day I'm gonna go on record saying it is
the worst day on the planet to go to any
tech website or any actually any website
in general for example I am looking at
MacRumors right now and it's saying
Ashton Kutcher - plays Steve Jobs in
upcoming indie film don't know if that's
true or not it could seem plausible or
oh yeah I know or iPad Hungry Hungry
Hippos I would have thought that was
true look at there's the iPod iPad and
stuff and then when you go to YouTube
they have the little CD thing up there
right a little CD and it's like oh you
could buy everything on you know
basically DVDs all YouTube videos on
DVDs let me see let me show you
everything so you go through the whole
shipping process yeah 101 I want him on
a laserdisc the shipping is OH 90,000
discs only a half a million dollars and
so this is a funny one but obviously I
know that ones that you but everything
else is just so confusing I was telling
Ally in the car I can't I try not to go
I'm glad we were traveling today because
I every April Fool's
I am so gullible or just I forget it's
April Fool's and every time I go to a
website
like I believe it and I'm just like oh
wait that's really awesome oh no it's
it's a joke be honest tell me in the
comments today what April Fool's prank
that any website like tell me what it
was and what website it was in the
comments and be honest that you fell for
it cuz I know I know every one of you
fell for one of them don't lie I don't
do it well I can see you right now
I'm looking at you don't lick your nose
not you lick your nose the exact same
position you were just in I went on an
adventure with the dogs to get some
pizza I took him for a car ride but my

kick-ass show with Mike Posner so that
