it's a bitch completely relaxed over
there she doesn't even look real right
now she's just good I love the one ear
all he sees your head bobbing up and
down babe so remember I told you guys
that I'm going to get more hard drives
so now I literally have six six terabyte
hard drives and I was doing some math
meaning I was asking Siri what comes
after terabyte because I remember you
being curious when gigabyte came out
that wasn't really sure after terabyte
is petabyte Panta byte exabyte Zeta byte
your devices know to bite that same way
is Yoda would you vote both movies you
guys have not seen matter Yoda bike
anyway here's an interesting fact guys -
petah bytes which would be equivalent to
20 thousand gigabytes try to do math
six terabytes isn't six six thousand
gigabytes so every 20 that I think is
twenty thousand anyway - petah bytes
figure out the math would store the
entire contents of all academic
libraries every single one of them
that's kind of crazy
but it needs thirty six terabytes to
hold every single CTFxC vlog maybe one
day we'll get the two pair that pay the
bytes that time then fair time we're
actually gonna go to the forest State
Fair yep there she is
you see that girl out yeah I don't even
I mean I wasn't even in the room so
Ali's getting her coffee and then we
were heading to the fair so thanks to
