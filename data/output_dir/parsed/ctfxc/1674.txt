time to get up it's time to get up it's
time to get up in the morning because I
get the camera morning
this is why I show you in that me tack
you're not helping her right that's what
I do to Daddy
no whoa that was a leap I like that she
digs her face rate and Zoey's mouth like
yeah you won't do anything you won't do
anything
come on fight me doo doo doo de doo doo
doo doo
it's like one of those I'll take that
back out sugar-free day too
look I watched what Yoshi nerd rock have
been doing all the little labeling
they've been labeling everything just to
make sure dumb proofing it right my
Asian side shown alright this is for
Ally
I'll learn it better for you oh boy
rain is literally coming down in buckets
and this dog has not left my side
but thunder is so close to our house and
it is so loud literally everywhere I go
she follows and I'm gonna try and fight
Marley now I think she's hiding in my
office
Sara Marley in here she moved she was
right there a second ago
Sara Marley Annie oh there's a Marley
there's a mommy's this storm making you
upset doesn't take long she's always
right behind hi dog could I use the
women's room the lights are now working
these are gonna be so sick oh my god oh
my god I'm very excited so I never used
to like this as a kid but the truth is
that it's friggin delicious
it's supposed to be a bundt cake but my
mom decided to make it in tiny little
loaves and this is Charles's absolute
favorite cake in the world so here's
another example of me doing something
great the child loves what are you got
here he'll get it later
like my birthday what are you doing a
little yeah what are you doing go go
there why do you always keep your mouth
open you're so weird oh I just missed
the kitty cat being nice to Marley it
finally stopped raining so we're gonna
let them run around all there's some
daylight left and make some poops and
pees and all that fun stuff
hey Zoey we did go one here's something
kind of funny I was looking at my bass
and I noticed doesn't this look more
yellow than it was before I think the
air is kind of messing with the color
cuz well it wasn't white when I first
bought it now it's like yellow
two bases of one
Florida
you remember a Berlin
who remember this dead
Berlin Oh what that beauty with that
beauty
sure enough as I say that it finally
stopped raining it's starting to rain
right now so we're gonna have to go back
inside
couldn't do you've been missing yourself
that's my list for a target earlier you
guys never do that even though I have an
iPhone and like 14 other devices and
applications and clouds and things that
sync up all my data and information that
I could ever possibly need I write what
I need on the back of my hand instead of
making a note or making some kind of
reminder list on my phone I'm just that
kind of person like I know it seems kind
of annoying it's like why would I not
like just use what I have but I don't
know it's easier for me to just because
then I see it and then I remember it's
funny to me because when my mom first
started learning how to use an iPhone
she was the same way she was like really
resistant to using it for anything but
now she's like all about it like my mom
is really good with her smartphone like
and it's so funny to me because I never
thought I would be that person but I can
already tell that I'm gonna be like one
of those like parents or like one of
those old people who's just like I don't
want to learn I don't understand I just
just do it for me like I never thought
it would be that way but I'm already
getting like that with like new apps and
new technology I'm like oh someone just
show me how to do it I'm gettin old
Zoey oh shoot
you little Butthead I lost tracking you
for five seconds of you're back there
making a gigantic mess Zoey Trippi get
your Fanny out of it what a complete
spaz widow spaz nutcase
