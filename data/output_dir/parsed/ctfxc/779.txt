come on buddy you can get out of that

okay breaking character whatever

okay what the fuck happened
Becky or Becky everybody if you could
please come up forth to the lobby ask
for your full cooperation to this
investigation it is important that no
one lead the reception as you're all
considered suspects best friends no way
between your man back much and so this
is what we know somber so you might want
to pause the video hey Elvis but now
that she's dead down there on the ground
Patricius becuse that's right that's
right now I was giving the speech right
there so everyone's starting to think
that I know something like that that's
what's going on right now good luck
trying to figure out the rest for you
I was right
nobody hears gunshots come on hurry I'm
the same why would you need some other
team because
I think there are some interesting
things and here we'll display for you
and then shortly after we will find out
who is behind us pour L'Amour the last
will and testament of Tony Giovanni this
is a will I have put my daughter Thank
You Giovanni yes sir together as the
executor of my state the family of the
business and wealth all of my personal
and professional wealth I again would
like to pass on to my eldest offspring
that being Thank You Giovanni if she is
married if Becky does not survive me by
30 days or he's not married the wealth
will be passed along to my youngest
daughter Gina Giovanni assuming that she
is marry evidence that is Harry
with a loaded gun what do you mean if
saying something suspicious about this
who do you think it is
he's on a Sunday but there's a character
named Mike who's also hit Mike first
Mike
maybe weights in it you are in care time
not know what you're doing you're a baby
cutting it up I know what you're doing
yeah that's very heartless wait well you
know damn well who is this man guilty as
hell right here nobody called the cops
there are no cops at all here except
above them security cards you you think
I we firmly accused bit of killing in
cold blood are you telling what okay so
here's the deal
Tony is the mob boss right yeah and Biff
it's with Gina who is now second to the
hole in all the money and Gina's
infatuated with Biff and so if Biff
kills Tony who was standing next to
Becky
you know Tony he's dead so now Biff is
now the leader but if you miss you hit
Becky meant that he's dead right
interesting
yeah wait yeah cool thank you so much
for your submission
oh hey Trish good there that possible
so that way you don't know and that's
exactly what happened this entire night
for the highest after reviewing the
evidence I've come to the conclusion
that although there are many people who
may have wanted Becky dead for various
reasons the evidence can conclusively
finger only one culprit the killer used
the note to frame Harry head in the
murder next I examine the note framing
Harry head the notice sign TG is
adjusting that Tony Giovanni the father
of the bride wrote the note if you
compare the signature of the Tony
Giovanni from Exhibit A you will find
that the signature on the wheel does not
match up with the handwriting enjoyed
with some of them
further if you compare the handwriting
on the note to brood a sentence
signature I'm on the exhibit be the
prenuptial agreement you will see that
the signature matches the handwriting on
the note leading us to conclude that
Brutus wrote the note this was never
planning for Beckett to make it on our
honeymoon when you look at the passports
and the plate statement that Brutus had
arranged for the couple you will see
that Becky's name on her passport and
her past and her name on the plane
ticket do not match as you can clearly
see
Brutus Simpson was the one without a
doubt Roberta the bride thank you drew
your Bonnie not
would you do yeah I know the money with
Assam morning in Charles baby my wiener
I can drink for them right Arnold did
you bully Ray Charles
it's uncanny look at the resemblance
buddy look at that it's a hair the
fluffiness the photo of all time
- I do not spin cheese Holly
oh okay so the gun that has six events
chambers yeah pull the car up
swipe right guys I'm swiping right
no no I don't like it stop it stop it
right away so we'll see you guys soon
well as always have a great night
