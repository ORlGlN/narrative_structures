getting into it big Marley pal / love
this afternoon gosh you just created a
dog toy master right on our floor I mean
really this is like a crime scene right
here
Marley Vernie wrote the whole thing
apart I don't think you could do much
one oh don't even
that's a 20-pound weight that she's used
to that idea actually
I do that too all the time okay and
she's back you want to carry me
so you want to carry it what what it's
20 pounds we thought instead of going in
the car that we would just take a walk
to Starbucks no I'm not walking this
purpose we're walking I'm gonna call up
oh I didn't know that what's that is
that another coffee place yes I actually
really like it I can never go there
because I have all that month I have
that gift cards on Starbucks so we're
going to another coffee place with
regardless we're deciding to walk there
and so Drive why because it's more
exercising and it's healthier later
today we're going to go to Trav's I
don't think it's a surprise party but
it's a party over at TopGolf which is
one of my favorite places now because
it's fun I don't know anyway so I got
the wagon this is the long walk just in
case though we're Marley get tired that
way we're going to make them walk like a
bunch of miles love like because it's
not really hot but it's it's cool but
that's the long walk I might actually
need to get in this thing
a monster oh that was a hill oh crap you
want to hear something creepy about this
place feel like it was Durango's I think
a drain goes you know like therefore
those crime shows and explain how
somebody gets killed or time to guess
whatever it was this place we guys built
here
yeah so this guy actually my
ex-boyfriend his sister a very first
boyfriend worked here and knew the guy
and news and managers I got killed and
you got it killed the manager what do
you do I stabbed him like 35 times he
was trying to rob the place
and the guy stabs the manager was
actually like in his wedding
ya know what seem more serious a lot of
those crime shows that you see like on
Investigation Discovery or on any of the
crime channel networks whatever you want
to call them a lot of those crimes
happen in Florida have to close in a
game like like a drinking game on the
Florida great no he's like you know I
can't figure out if I'm digging this or
not I gotta give these dogs some credit

wouldn't it be funny really we're good
reporting ran around our last prize 40
times and then into her neighbor's house
and then into our neighbor's yard after
walking on probably 4 or 5 miles we were
like how does she have so much energy
bolted that I would be like I thought I
would be upset with him because I would
be so nervous or we hurt him and I we
sure seemed I was like upset in there I
was worried it was her hurt she's done
it before she's eaten more chocolate
than me when I know they got it that
dark chocolate down on that note I'm
going to say goodnight to you guys
because we have to clean up this little
Easter mess my question to you guys they
today is in the comments tell me the
worst thing or the craziest or funniest
thing your dog or cat or pet goldfish I
guess anything has eaten and tell me the
story behind it like fun he would stay
in my loft house or whatever or even at
my house Belgian feminine and he would
take toilet paper like a roll so Zoomer
and words it to shred and so he walked
into the bathroom or somehow get it out
of the bathroom and put it into the
bedroom and just pretty shreds
so it's your turn guys now let me know
in the comments your favorite craziest
whatever story of your pets so now I got
to go run Marley another seven miles you
you're in trouble look at me look at me
look at me
she's so happy to get yep that was all
me
