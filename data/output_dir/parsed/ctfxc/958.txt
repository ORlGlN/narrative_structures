Happy House really high pitch happy
fourth of July so far hasn't rain which
typically every 4th of July in Florida
it does rain which kind of sucks because
I don't think we've ever had like a
normal day of fireworks he's not feeling
too good so why are you laying with him
don't you try and get up if you think
you need more rest you can sleep you're
gonna have 15 minutes you can even had
20 if you want it the morning my bar I
think I'm gonna go for a run
does that mean you want to go hello now
Internet I'm back up my stomach I think
is all the sudden yesterday I think I
may have been a little bit dehydrated or
something like that feel much better now
and by the way happy into Penn State or
like I like to call it happy day
Will Smith saved us from aliens day it's
about the rain on top of fireworks and
the girls get really neurotic so I'm
giving them a half of benadryl don't be
too smart eat the whole thing yeah you
you'll eat the whole damn thing all
right Zoe you have to hide a little bit
more you don't eat that pill good now
you guys are gonna be very sleepy you
won't even know there's fireworks ma'am
you reverse you got a reverse back it up
back it up I'm gonna push it backwards
hope you massage every time I stuff
she's like what you'll be making else
when I do that oh boy
I'm Mickey I don't wear pants and let
the fun begin
you know why or if it's just temporarily
it looks like they closed the wooden
roller coasters yeah those are always
the scariest ones because you don't know
if like a plank is gonna fly out or
something like that probably why they
closed it look it's your old family down
there they had on pretty much hassle
Mego
I love this camera because of the
quality but the one thing that really
sucks is like when I try to do those
like anything that filmed the lens is
like protruding it like the trees this
much on actual like body of the camera
pulling out of my pocket it's very very
scary yeah lose it that's one smart
orangutan chilling in the shade in the
pool
pull the belly right now yeah you call
them Marlene's over there right now
okay go on one of my favorite roller
coasters Goomba was I think what I hear
is going to be retired so I definitely
want to get on there and take you guys
one last time sports on that the best
part of the another front is actually
the back and is never a line at the back
probably on an airplane house
all right the day goes on we're
realizing that's getting hotter and
hotter might have been a big mistake
because it's now and I'm out but
we're still having a blast
I'm gonna win you a flamingo well you
have to like walk walk around all day
I thought welcome back not worth it hey
 didn't smother yeah

just cell phones are getting worse and
worse that you have to have these
charging stations

days unless you've snapped it putting in
your pocket

coaster in before
