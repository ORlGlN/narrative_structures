we decided to make a little table out
under the palm trees
oh these are probably good that's a palm
tree that's not that's a beautiful tree
hey good morning good today isn't we
super fun I'm very excited and you'll
just have to see what happens and
Charles is super awake and feeding Birds
that's that's why I want you guys to try
this at home my mom told me this so you
take your foot and go clockwise and then
with your hand go counterclockwise smell
but you can switch your foot switch can
you do it yeah I think you're doing it
the best though
you're actually doing it to that you're
doing it that way work Alec try it
mangle we're supposed to kind of go like
this okay like that and then
counterclockwise with your hand
is it hard oh yeah that makes sense to
do a right and left hemisphere yeah I
want you guys to try that right now in
your chair so try this smear
hard make you wet
so your right foot you go clockwise and
then your right hand go counterclockwise
big we do the best that is so cool
I want to go do that whole like go to
the lost thing of the dressing park in
one of those I don't know if I mentioned
this for today's the day we go swim
listen shark okay it's ready so I his
dragon it'll ever be you got a little
something on your face it's not rough
yeah I got it yeah good yeah it's
actually good actually
nothing right here you do why is rubbed
in compared to other life oh really
II was going to loop now we're good I
got the extra sunscreen corset
you're gonna regret it yeah and we go
just do it even if yours we get
specially for a yeah the elements stick
it out there exactly lady ready babe
so we're all getting ready
constitute press right now
like that I think it something totally
worthwhile
if L blew this water is oh my god
they're like right there all of the
louder don't hold this square bar along
the wall tighter hang your elbow in and
if everybody's up climbing on the rail
it's going to sink the case I was going
on was a big old shark turbine is early
I'm getting that I love the largest in
Hawaii huh third largest that's big
enough
over 80% of the 400 shark species in the
world are under five feet in length so
generally plan oh yes I got a while it
was beautiful anyway he's first
gestation probably not fabulous women
yep are you are you deciding on
different life choices right now I want
to know anything
Holly that's so cool I just can't stop
looking at the water let alone the
sharks in the water
since I was price legal handling one of
the coolest things in the world
you like it that was like oh yeah wild
Wilder absolute but got a little
nauseous or at the end and we're still
alive yeah well check this out they just
showed us these that's a Megalodon right
there
imagine that like show me how they do it
okay oh my god that's the I could just
imagine we would have never won take a
little little chomp India is going to
get on one dude this blows my frickin
mind the size of my hand and they're
heavy
so we survived hanging out with shark
yesterday and that was probably one of
the coolest things I've ever got to do
like I've always wanted to say like I
said a million times I always wanted to
punch a shark in the face but after that
in all honesty like how calm and docile
they were I don't think I'd want to do
it maybe a mean like tiger shark or
something like that
it was kind of interesting is everyone
had like little sticks but there wasn't
enough so I use my Go Go Pro pull and
like if they get too curious you're
supposed to just kind of push them away
so I got to Boop a shark in the nose
like this
Sophie Boop to a shark it was pretty
funny but this cool little this is kind
of a truckstop not just aa little down
before Concord who thought if we try
without really food trucks it's kind of
like really permanent like the Dutch
it's actually kind of cool
what'd you get good
wait do it again slower slower and this
is Hawaiian snow I think it's what's
called right it looks almost like like
pulled chicken Wow I am peanut butter
Terrace Drive Toby just noted the
rainbow
so we survived we did we survived with
only minimum Gary Packers oh by the way
