get that so cool and second thing since
the summer is coming up I wanted to
change the pic I actually just ran out
of pics so if anyone has this one you're
lucky because it's the only one left
because this literally is the last one I
have able to play it tomorrow and throw
it out at the show in Phoenix but since
the summer is coming up and we have a
warped tour coming up by the way I don't
know if I actually officially said it in
the vlog we are headlining Warped Tour
again this year so I will see you guys
at work torn but I wanted to do
something kind of you know summery some
fun kind of thing for a walk tour so I
have new pics coming and I just got a
design and I'm gonna show you guys right

then you know we're gonna keep that the
same so this is gonna be our summer pics
you guys like it and come to the show
and I will try to throw as many of these
to your face as possible
the reflection this is what Ben did to
be a nice guy
instead of like throwing away the shoes
I told him just to leave it out maybe
somebody who actually needs the shoes
will actually see it since we don't
really know where any donation things
are otherwise we would have to obviously
done that I think that being a really
nice thing to do they did it such a nice
dude Ben stacks is such a good guy to
rule in a different way I'm gonna buy a
tattoo and Charles is gonna put it on I
never knew temporary tattoo this perfect
with fear panic with fear oh and it's a
skull of dynamite some tribals great
dude lucky I know I could put thank you
very appreciate it

literally says panic with fear on it
where should I put it
I'm happier now and that has to be fully
right there yeah
right there right we go actually well
100% dude give it a real badass all
right I'm gonna put up my arm just
because I don't think it'll actually
work you don't remember the last time I
played a temporary tattoo and so gotta
figure this up your washcloth FDA any
clip here

gotten
yeah yeah you got to make sure you're
gonna put the ointment out though that

that chair not so sure I didn't know
that they did litter tattoos them yeah

to clear out all this space we do this
whole time I've sold
max didn't want to play with us for this
one it's satisfying for this many that
noise gonna be amazing so close there we
go
oh yeah this is the most genius game
because you're literally just put
