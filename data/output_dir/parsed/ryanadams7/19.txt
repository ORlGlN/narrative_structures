oh hello when I was a kid
Christmas was my favorite time of the
year making cookies wrapping presents so
happy and full of cheer but now I'm
grown and away from home and my job is
on YouTube so click along
it's my vlogmas song
I've spent so much
I stopped to realize ain't gonna get no
views but you can't fail if the gum nail
and a title that isn't true
and everything is going
the trees on fire and now
and you can I'm honest just click like
it
you
