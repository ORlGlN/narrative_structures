good morning everyone and welcome to
another vlog so we're gonna start today
by going to buy a canvas a mummy hello
basically the other day when we were
talking about getting a canvas the
reason we didn't go was because it was
the shop was open till 7:30 and we went
out I like 8:00 so we were kind of late
on that type of thing but today it's
like signal 5:30 so we can definitely
make it let's go we just arrived at the
mall my mom and sister are gonna go
upstairs but I wanted to show you these
really cool cars in the valley these are
just so cool you're not even gonna
believe it okay you ready for it
BAM we've got a blue g-wagen and then a
white and blue rolls-royce look at these
their colour combinations are actually
really amazing Wow these are cargoes
it's even got like the crystal badge
okay I'm gonna go back to our car they
look really cool
Wow they're actually really awesome
anything I can back shop for you guys
amazing absolutely amazing anyways we
came to the wrong floor because we were
supposed to go to the orange floor we
didn't know what they meant when they
said that but now that we got here we
just realized that the first level is
green and the second level is orange
like you can see from like the pillars
if you know I mean okay let's go where's
my sister oh by the way I really love
this black Mustang whoa fresh the cars I
just showed you guys those would be like
kind of card dreams for me like not
because of the cars but just like that
colors I really like funky colors if you
can't tell like when I spray-painted my
shoes blue and that's just something I
would definitely do like to my car in
the future I just go all out
creativeness with it and you have car
goes man car dreams I even car goals
guard dreams it is so so awesome okay so
they have this like outdoor section
we've been here we've been to this more
like a hundred times that I've never
seen this place okay on the red carpet
you made it I want to thank the yo-yo
squad for making me this famous I can
walk on the red carpet I've never been
here either she I'm so famous I get to
open the red carpet I have your
autograph
alright let's go find this art shop so
we're in the art shop and they have like
loads and loads of things like okay I
don't know what these are for they just
look like loads of brushes to me the
coolest one is sister look at that looks
are you going to paint a wall this would
be like art heaven the canvas we're
going to buy is this one it's like this
one meter 50 by 2 meters one one and a
half by two Wow they've got loads of
stuff I found something that I'm
actually interested in they have loads
and loads of high quality spray paint
look at that they have like colours you
wouldn't even get anywhere else you know
what something different which I feel
about these I feel that much heavier
than the scraping I have like they can't
feel much heavier you know it'd be a
good paint because if it's not it was
always tired are you doubting my skills
yes you got this huge huge canvas and my
sister's new project it should turn out
good I don't know should I slice Oh
should I leak out what you're going to
draw no okay I'm not going to leak it
but let me know if you want me to do
like a learn how to paint challenge or
my sister teaches me how to paint
because I'm bad I'm really bad so maybe
I can use like a small canvas and try
and learn but for now where I'm going to
fit this I give I&R take your energy I
need to blog and hold the cam side you
take the camera you take your camera
it's impossible it's impossible
where are we going down there I don't
know
where's my money that's too bad I'm
sorry
we need to do you know how to take this
up how do you take this up like how to I
don't know how to dismantle it we need
to learn how to use this scar right I've
got a better idea don't do anything on
it look it's right we don't need it you
can just can't you fit it through here
we finally found the way to fit it in
the boot is that good right let me go
see for the are close the door yeah here
we must look like such amateurs right
now huh the back of the car looks super
weird with this it looks like we've got
like a small little tent halfway through
the car we're heading off to the souk
right now because the souk is that place
downtown is in downtown Dubai next to
the buy more so we're just going to park
in the mall and walk our way out because
it's the most convenient way and we can
go check out something that we have it
will be good for a change
leggo I said this is the type of design
I would go for I really love being like
a super busy house obviously we have
conflict in my household because we have
a very simple house I would love to have
a really really busy house everything
around the place I'm in patchy which is
one of my favorite chocolate stores and
they've actually got decorations because
of the Flag Day that's coming up the UAE
national flag day look at that these are
so cool but apart from that if you have
like awesome chocolate it tastes really
nice they gave me a trial one and I got
so tempted that I got myself a box of
chocolates so you can custom pick the
ones you want they came soda
so that is my custom box of chocolate
guys looks pretty cool
we
Oh
I think I found this exclusive place is
already exclusive but no one else seems
to be here any it's this really nice
view of this pond but it gets back is
behind me on this side look at the view
you have the address hotel down here we
have like loads of palm trees and it
seems empty down there I'm gonna walk
down there and we even have the birch
leaf up here okay I'm gonna walk down
over here because it doesn't seem like
it's too busy on this section so I think
we can get a good view of like the area
where the show goes on I just realized I
am so dumb the reason it's empty isn't
because it's an exclusive place it's
because you can't even see the water
show from here this is the second pond
they have the war show is over that side
so this oh wow I feel like an idiot now
I really feel like an idiot I'm a huge
cheat guys basically if you didn't know
the valley over there in the middle they
have a section in the hotel where they
put their cars and I found out because
last time I saw loads of supercars there
and I came to see if there was any there
and there wasn't so that's kind of a
bummer because usually they have some
nice cars there and I wanted to do some
cosplaying but that was a complete fail
guys do you see that that's movie go
Louie Figo's and divide you see him he's
the one with the microphone next to into
one of the yes you are right there I
could see you and that's so crazy
NUI beagle if you guys don't know him
he's a legend in football I remember
watching this guy's matches wow I just
sort of don't like weights one I'm going
to just see if there's any way I can get
a media master going it's just on the
squad I can get Lama let's see okay so
apparently anyone can go and I thought
you needed a fast but no anyone can go
in let's see Figo he's playing a FIFA
match today
you're worried about V go man
we'll see about that the work people
always wins
I don't
see the conscience so you know your boy
came to trial
Oh check this out
I'm just too good at this game I'm too
good that's it I give up
I've never played yo I don't think I'm
allowed to wear
how does this protect you this hurts
Kandi's football helmet actually protect
yours just like one for show I put it
back up man
it escaped heavy huh I actually can't
see how it was to help my head it it
looks like it's gonna injure me
maybe I wasn't putting it on right we've
come to this kebab joint I said that
good Americans a night let you know like
a cabana boy in a burger joint and
something really funny cool type of
thing happened to me right now
I actually signed my first autograph now
for me that's just so light it's so
weird because I've never done it before
it felt like I was famous without being
famous you know I mean it's just I don't
know how I feel that I it just feels
weird I guess I've never done that
before
I just tried doing that no idea thank
you

Pinocchio can I see this one move
is that real eggs oh that's so cool
thank you
can you teach me I don't know how to do

at it they've got like little bags in
there it's like a hand version this is
for the girls I guess that watch my
channel look at this this is from Dior
yeah they're all coming out one by one
that is actually pretty cool I am NOT
into this type of stuff but it looks
pretty cool I'm going to take a bet with
you guys that that is extremely
expensive that dominoes set I'm going to
go inside and ask it was fairly pricey
but not as pricey as I thought it's five
thousand dirhams which is basically a
thousand pounds one and a half thousand
dollars around that I'm just saying this
on the top of my head I don't know the
exchange rate we're passing by this
place that sells tea charactery and the
smell is so nice that even though it
like to me it doesn't really have much
of an effect but it doesn't let my
sister sleep and she really wants up I
don't know use your choice you can I
might and keep it till tomorrow morning
at morning no no I don't think it works
like that
