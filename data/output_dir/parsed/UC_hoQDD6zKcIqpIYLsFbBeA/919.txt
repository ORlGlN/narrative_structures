my skates so I feel to go out skating
with them might go sometime today I'm
not too sure my room is still a mess
upstairs I haven't fixed it and the real
reason I haven't put my computer into
place is because at the moment in my
room upstairs the internet doesn't reach
there so we need to buy like another
internet adapter to make like make the
connection a bit longer so it can reach
my lot can reach my room I mean not my
loan so yeah I'm not sure what I'm gonna
do today let me quickly just take my
swaggy way and go and play in that room

just put it down and switch it on there

just going to let him sleep in peace so
I was just in the hallway and I saw
kitty is chilling in the suitcase so I'm
just going to leave her there hopefully

want to be back upstairs in a couple
minutes anyways because I'm gonna give
this memory card to my sister and see if

we go go on all right okay so I'm about
to go shopping and I thought I might as
well try out my skates that brought from
London to get to the shops Kitty is
sleeping here and I'm just gonna sit
over here where he's and see how they
are ah these are kind of tight I need to
stop the camera to put these on oh let's
see yes Fitz I've got my skates on time
to leave and go shopping I'm just
practicing with them in the house I
haven't scared in a long long time and
I'm finding it kind of hard so I think
I'm gonna go slow towards a supermarket
because I'm not used to DS that much
whoa feel fresh
Oh honestly can we do this I'm going
backwards I think I can manage okay so
time to go I can do it let's go oh you
got the cars we need to take this for
our wash and the Ranger I don't even
think we've taken any of them for a wash
but let's make our way to the shops with
these rollerskates I need to watch out
for cars
feel good it's actually does feel good
so let's go
I can't even lie this feels amazing on
the road and the weather just helped it
is so nice so I've completed my shopping
now got the bags making my way home just
flying past these roads then we have the
lake on that side finally made it home
and I can conclude that skating roller
skating days is the fastest way for me
to get to my shops and back home put the
bags home with the dirty cars and it's
bad gold jeez okay no dead birds duck
and go inside
whoo it's at night guys were about to go
out and my sister randomly told me I'm
driving so I guess I am
why not let's see down up the car yes I
did so I had a night driving but I'm
kind of nervous as well I haven't driven
so I don't know what side of the road it
is and the only times I really drive it
to like the corner shops here so I guess
it's time for me to learn to go on the
highway or wherever you call it right
yeah keep to the right got it got him
or in the mall right now and I wanted to
show you this Ferrari I think it's the
new always in a nuance there's a third
one very nice very the lights are on so
I could I go straight all right right we
just arrived at the more you know good
times this is literally how most of my
old clothes were but I just came here

burgers the case like I'm gonna meet
distaste or

head

for the food right now like like a look
at the happiness in my face I want this
 forever like it should be the whole
time I was in London I was like I wish

to go to the cannon shot and see if they
have any new cameras anything cool I can
maybe young get in the future I don't

trying to get my sister into the habit
of blogging so just keep on commenting
on her Instagram constantly she - I
don't think you hear me like keep saying
lonna start blog - on the stock mode and
I think I can eventually with your help
persuade you to do so alright so I'm in
the Canon store and I'm taking a look at
the Phantom I've got the fan here is the
fan and you know the airplane type of
things Bowser took a look at some other
cameras I took a look at the way I don't

moved cameras across but I'm not sure if
I should get the Phantom or if I should
get like a proper DSLR camera so let me
know I'm just going to leave I just
check all of them out my sister was like
you came here for no reason I'm looking
around she was like you came you to buy
nothing as a yeah pretty much just
looking around see why should get next

would be in the Virgin store 9 the Canon
store but they had in the Canon store as
well so alright look at these shoes guys
Virgin Megastore big issues in the world

penny boy
