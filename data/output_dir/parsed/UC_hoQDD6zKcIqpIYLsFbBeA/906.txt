nice it's too much niceness yeah that is
how you make someone that stinks smell
nice it's my sister Stevie I just spray

finally found some stuff for The Cooking
Channel heart-shaped stuff we're not
sure what time I'm going to get them all

well so we found was a little ones yeah
that's the type of thing we would
actually perfect Liz yeah isn't that
good it doesn't work with that it
doesn't work so your heart-shaped stuff
would be fine and I'm not sure he's that
joining it like circles for cupcakes or
okay so that's what we've gone for we
just quickly need to go get my sister

how we do I can let's quickly go get the
shrimps before it's too late and my

going on hand and it stings like can you
see yours did it go red I did like my
one it was right there you can't see

the food like because it was like spiky
right and it stings like she told me my
hand stings I didn't believe her and
then suddenly something when my hand I
was like what is this I think it was
that you know that spike you threw me
