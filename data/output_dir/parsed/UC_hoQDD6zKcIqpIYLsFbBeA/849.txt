weather is nice hey would you mind okay
co-op with your squad over there so what
parts is to change the spoiler is that
carbon fiber wing oil oh okay
I'm getting a run-through of this

the edges Wow
and the front is well I see the carbon
fiber is this a body kit yeah
but they kill me Wow and today
oh you're getting something extra why is
that
like someone picks you up
my favorite hurricane today looks
gorgeous the interior is also red or
black it matches everything
this is the only time you can come
downtown and have the road to yourself
but you're basically going to blocked
off for the event and then that side
there's cars going baits and to the
reason we're my flight
keeping in line thank you John yeah
that's really amazing I mean my favorite
is that retro rock and I showed them

that I think it fell out
no no it fell out I'm pretty sure
it's not it's not every day you see this
many Lamborghinis revving here ready
so what's the plan after harmonica hey

heard the plan guys after this Ike rally
that we're going around I think we're
heading up to Burj Khalifa Wow
that is the flag and
those are the police guys guys police
super guys there's some awesome people
here we're talking to ya it's just a
really nice event like just to talk to
people should be the place crazy for
those of you love these surprises you
should be here it's really exciting
and say like all different colors of
Lamborghinis
the UAF is absolutely yeah it's amazing
I think even if you guys can do it like
first of my new partner arrange your
cars into the flag like that if you guys
even I've got you I know that
you can do now but next year even if you
come around this area trust me we wait I
like quarter-section EMR it's the
ephemeral Boulevard like when they take
laps around so it's really best but we
won't take some shots with the cars is
pretty nice pictures you can take
yeah just cut me dumps down by trust me
you're gonna see a long we stopped
inventory stop go stop go pictures with
the cards
I live in shock
I don't know
I think we have to go
you
on
the turnout doesn't stop every time we
stop that's it
everyone's on it where it's gone
I think we're getting out again at least
the fans are enjoying it its value of
the fans the crowds thank you everyone

videoing for you guys but you can see
the entire valley is going to be
surrounded by Lamborghinis from us

lighting them up right I don't know

that
okay I think we're just gonna line them
up we're going to live out the car just
for like a new photo shoot me and then

beautiful yeah today's like the you know

just gonna have an extra battery in my
pocket all the time when I go around

battery anymore
I should be fully energized we've come
to our favorite spot PF Changs i don't

is so amazing like some days I don't

pulling a day to day basically I didn't
want to go buy some glosses but my feet
hurt so bad so I'm gonna wrap it up and

going to rush for anything so it's
alright I think we did way too much
anyways today it's going to be a
headache maybe you guys will enjoy
today's and longer vlog I'm not sure how
much I'll put in there but it's a little
revving I know it's a lot of revving for
sure anyways I just got home guys we're
gonna wrap up today's vlog here after
that event I'm partially deaf I was on
TV apparently that's what people are
telling me by now because they said the
parenting on loads of channels had us
live broadcasted and yeah it's just
overall a generally awesome event I'd
love to go to more hopefully you guys
enjoyed it let me know in the comment
section if you did but wow my feet look
I'm barefoot right now because those
shoes killed my feet like they were
there are kind of full shoes I didn't
know what to wear I was okay let me just
try and be a bit more prepared and then
you know I could've worn trainers I
don't think anything would have happened

learned something anyways if you guys
