good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog so today is the last day I haven't
really mentioned when we were leaving
but today is the last day that we're in
London and tomorrow we are leaving to
Dubai so that's a bit of news for you
guys I guess now this morning all I was
doing is everything's a mess anyways but
what I was doing is see my Canon bag I
was sorting out all my camera equipment
and I was like why not show you guys
everything I had so the only thing that
is not here is my GoPro so just add that
in your head I guess cuz I put the GoPro
in my big suitcase so going into the bag
just got a pen that's pretty much it but
when you open up this section I'm not
sure how well you can see let me just
readjust the camera
alright so I've done instead is I put
them all on the floor so you can see
them a bit better so here we go these
except from obviously should have like a
GoPro here so imagine there's a GoPro
here and my main vlogging camera the g7x
we have this one I think you can find
all of these in my description I've
already written what they are the Saudi
one of these projector cameras that I've
got my main camera the lens and the 550d
I actually never use this I don't know
why I really should and then I've got
the spare vlogging camera not really a
good volume camera the g7x is much
better but there you go so so since
today is the last day it's gonna be a
very very busy day now you can probably
see I'm outside now walking
got my umbrella since it's raining
heavily you can go sort out a couple
things at my bank then go sort out a
couple of things on the internet which
is YouTube and stuff so pretty much
gonna be a very hectic day also my mom
and sister are gonna vlog today I gave
them the other camera so let's just see
how this vlog turns out so I'm in town
and I ran into this awesome lady Louise
now they're with a charity called action
against and she talked to me about it it
sounds pretty cool you can research it
online on their website also make sure
to follow her she's awesome yes I've
made sure to follow as you think she's
really nice library now and quickly
upload my video so I'll see is the
little fund I wanted a video to either
day but it was way too busy but
obviously now it's raining and no one's
here alright so I'm done at the library
it seems like it's not raining so I
don't think I need my own friend anymore
while seeing the library is pretty much
trying to reply to a lot of comments cos
when I don't have internet it's kind of
hard to reply and I've seen a lot of
comments saying oh why you not replying
so I'm really sorry it's just kind of a
struggle and I don't have internet to
see the comments and my phone also does
not have internet because I think I
already told you this like yesterday or
the day before I maxed it out and I have
no more internet but today's the last
day it's okay tomorrow we're leaving
and that internet is gonna be fine my
mom is just are also on their way here
I'm not sure they said like two or three
minutes
they're going to the post office so I'm
gonna meet them there and see what
they're up to
alright here they are we are finally in
town it's not raining that much they
just put their videos on so what you
have to say so we're done at the post
office finally my sister at like fifty
thousand questions and to be honest the
lady that works there is kind of her
friends so they talk way too much
tonight half an hour and they were just
talking about blah blah blah blah blah
but I think wait wow that's so bright
whatever no it's not there you go fixed
up I think no I did they just took
they're just like it's a talkative
friendship but I'm gonna I was reading a
card right there and it said men speak
15,000 words a day and women speak
30,000
I don't I don't talk that much sir I'm
gonna go

crossing to life

of coins I think I'm gonna go to Kyra's
