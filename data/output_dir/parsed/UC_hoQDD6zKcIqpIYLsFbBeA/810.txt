good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog I'm looking extremely black today
black sunglasses shirt pants shoes and
watch yeah boy swag anyway so no I
deliberately decided to everything back
I don't know why I thought would look
cool but now that I've worn it it looks
kind of normal so who knows maybe I'm
just retarded I just went in to get
myself some M&Ms because it is delicious
they just are done doo-doo-doo woo this
is why I mean guys see that
check all tire pressures good luck
getting there without crashing yeah I
promise you this boy's happens to us so
we're taking the car in for service
right now and look good there the
notification is gone last time my sister
came because the brakes are making noise
and when we got there they took it for a
half an hour test drive it didn't make
any noise you guys saw on our way here
there was a notification saying four
tire pressures were low and now that's
gone - what the hell is this it's like
it knows you're taking it to the service
and it's like you know what I can do to
mess up these people I'm just gonna say
I'm perfect I'm just gonna pretend like
everything's okay I saw at least I have
on camera if they don't believe me at
the service center I may be like look my
cat I recorded this I like elevators
that have mirrors because then you get
like a huge reflection Lego we just came
to Wafi because we had some papers to
pick up for my mummy and now we're gonna
go to the Ranger replace bro yo sup I
needed to find a way to get to the other
side
hello from the other side that side hey
lil that is a human sized pyramid
in Dubai Dori my subscribers understand
my language here humans
you can fit inside there so it's a human
sized pyramid it's working for humans to
go into not like so did I make a mistake
no it's a human sized pyramid so you're
telling me he no because when you saw I
said that normally they were smaller
like this side another no no no I can't
let my subscribers the Earth's God know
what human sized is looking at one is
yellow head you shower I had chiseled
everything into the head I choose a hood
every piece of art into that wall
they told me that Monalisa
you guys the road response to take is
this road how do you get to that road
they stole your car have I didn't was
your plate behavior that's pretty funny
when you see a white her I can check the
plate no magenta right now I just
completely forgot we don't even have our
Lamborghini that's our sister was joking
around saying check the car because he's
given the edge was like oh
check the car imagine that have been the
most hilarious thing every saw a
Lamborghini on the street whatever like
they stole my pistol Milo Bob I love
died more wario we have an emergency
all right guys we're done at the service
center we need to create a new rush over
because Lamborghini closes in about half
an hour we're super super late let's go
Wow tell me that's not unique guys I've
never seen something like this hey my
sister's cars ready we're gonna leave
soon madam this is very nice
I found this red hurricane hiding behind
that four-wheel-drive car look at it I
actually really love red Hawkins they
just look so they stand out if you know
I mean look at it anyways as I said my
sister is just wrapping up inside we're
gonna take this home you've got a
beautiful unique
yep the exhaust just ruined my voice we
have a unique event two-door and then
another white hair again anyways let's
go home I think my sister should be good
to come out soon guys that's how the
Aventador sounds when it's turned on
that is so loud you don't even know
my picture
yeah
the Range Rover went out today to go to
service and the Lambo is back from
service like I don't know why at the
exact same time they were both cheaper
service isn't that really ironic some of
you awesome guys sent me these toys I
can't remember the names I think it was
a blow wrap on newer and someone else
I'm really sorry if I got that wrong but
basically these are supposed to expand
up to six times their size when you put
them in more that's why we can do right
now I love stuff like this is so cool
okay I think I should put both reflect
in like a anyways let's go put these in
the war and see how big they become look
at that there's a rule you want to drink
of that water apparently okay let's just
chuck Nemo in there as well
three three one
you're so GUI design not they feel
really gooey I kind of feel disgusting
when you touch them so I'm not going to
touch them anymore we're going to leave
that to expand apparently after 10 hours
we'll start growing but it takes three
weeks to reach its maximum size bubbles
guys so sigh who sang Gangnam style has
a new song out now and it's good daddy
my sis has no idea this song without I
just showed her right now it's so funny
that is actually a really really funny
song like I stress is really so like
unique when it comes to the song I got
it from my daddy daddy daddy where to
talk to you guys right now for a little
bit
so about I think it was month a month
and a half ago I was like brilliant too
like oh I'm gonna get car car shopping
etc except right it never happened
it's finally that time to start looking
for a car again basically long story
short some stuff came in the way and it
couldn't happen but now is the time to
look for cars again and I'm having a
huge problem so when I did go looking
for cars you guys knew I was in love
with the Mustang that's just the honest
truth I really like American cars
especially the Mustang that's why I was
in love with as a kid now where we went
to that Motor Show everyone was like
more the Mustang gt350 and to be honest
I didn't have a look at it I didn't
really look at it too much I went by
kind of saw it and didn't think anything
off it now that I look at the car cane
let me just show you you have to bite
yourself look at this okay
first of all look at the car um look how
beautiful this is just just a small
walkthrough okay nothing much yeah
beautiful that's what I say beautiful
but not even that listen to this car
please I have another link do you hear
that this is not even max volume here's
max sorry
did you hear that oh my god that just
sounds so amazing oh you know when you
just hear something and it's so gorgeous
now however I'm going to have a problem
I must say I'm gonna have a problem
number one when stuff like this comes
out because I know it's recently been
released in the UAE I know that thing
has probably been like sold out or
pre-ordered out to be honest I have no
idea I haven't even seen this car I
don't know if it's hour whatever so I
don't know if it's still on pre-order or
they've actually released it but
whatever is I'm pretty sure it would
have been sold out regardless even if
it's just pre-orders or orders you know
I mean so if I don't go for a 350gt I
know this sounds really weird I'm even
going to try and get that or the lowest
base model you can get I'm going to tell
you why so you're like wait mol so
you're either going to try and get the
best one or the worst one isn't that
kind of weird the reason is if I can't
get what I want then I'd rather get
something that's just so base model that
I won't even mind trading it in like
within a couple of months if I can't get
why I want if you know I mean I don't
know if that makes sense I might be
really stupid but just listen to this
one more time please oh my god that's
music to my ears anyways enough of that
I also want to talk to you guys about
two more things so first of all New
Year's is coming up and I'm talking to
you guys about it now for two reasons
that's kind of the two things I wanted
to talk about I'm kind of being really
early and talking about this I always
mess up when it comes to going to places
and doing stuff for like events
or days now New Year's I know there's
going to be loads of things going on and
I'm pretty sure that the Burj Khalifa
has firework shows going on because last
year it was amazing I never got to go
but if this year is anything like last
year it'll be amazing for a video so if
you guys know anywhere they'll have a
good view of the Burj Khalifa let me
know you might even know people that
like have places around there just let
me know and I'll try and be there so
comment down below if anybody knows
anywhere that has a good view and yeah
that's the first thing second thing
getting onto New Year's I have
officially started doing YouTube blogs
for a year now oh it's been a one-year
anniversary it was like three days ago
which I hit one year and somebody
messaged me was like no it's been one
year why don't you make a one year like
vlog you know all the best parts of the
year so this is where I'm going to leave
it to you guys
I'm going to have a competition whoever
makes me the best like compilation I'll
put it out as my one-year anniversary
video and I'll give you a huge shot the
beginning of the video or the end I'm
not too sure I'll just see what fits in
