going to go check our mail we're going
with the Lamborghini
so Lamborghini mail run or mail checking
so let me see how do you open this
there we go my sister told me yo you go
turn it on so I was like cool I'm good

let's just put it here or mo drives a
Lamborghini no ok so you flip the switch
hold your put on hold your foot on brake
and there we go I have no idea what
these me
I'm going to go back into my side
let's give you a close-up up the exhaust
it's firing at him the chorus firing on
the
I went to video it because I thought it
was shaking like just like you know door
shake and then I saw it's like spitting
out some liquid okay time to go you push
this side of the door
ah let's do it one hand and then you
pull I just want to clarify this for any
of you who want to send us post I always
leave the pure box information in the
description and in my About section so
if you do not send us stuff that is how
you send it to us but yeah let's see if
there is anything I know post takes a
long time to get here but we will
definitely see it so yeah let's go see
if there is anything because we checked
kind of recently like a couple days ago
we could go who knows but yeah hopefully
there is something so we can open it for
you guys and I know you know they may
want that red stuff this ever since I
left the city you started wearing going
now glasses of champagne out on the
dance floor
all right so let's go
I can just imagine the day we take the
Lambo to check the mail that there's
going to be huge boxes we can't take
home imagine we get like a huge budget
and have you seen the boot on this Lambo
it's like tiny like I think it will fix
like wondering yeah it can't fit like a
couple boxes but imagine you get ten
boxes you like jarred it today you won't
get like much fur or just be really
funny no just
haha
we are finally here that's our post
office over there
listen to this crackle guys
ready for it
all right there we go all right so time
to check the post that is ours open it
up let's see go to the better the DA
yeah I can't even open up the Oh box
really I don't know I'm doing something
wrong let's still we got something we
got something one rose okay let's go
time to go home think they're gonna get
annoyed of us coming to the post office
of the Lambo again and again like whoa
all right let's go Wow my sister
literally turned on the car and the
camera fell but we're gonna go home and
open the mail and yeah whoever said we
can show on camera will show it to you
so yeah successful mail mail run we
don't really come from the mill my
sister needed to post out something but
since we're here we decide let's just
check the post office anyways to see if
we do anything so time to go home
the other day one of you told me in the
comment section something that made me
feel really dumb but what they did tell
me was that apparently
all right apparently if you want to
record in 4k on the iPhone and every
year you had to go to this settings go
to photos and capillarity
generally on the back camera you can
choose all of this eggs so you can have
720p 1080p and 4k
they swore no I don't think so I'm not
sure outdoor shower correct me if I'm
wrong - I don't think so or justly just
a song that was it all right
let's see if we can hear the car in the
tunnel
I think it's going to be too windy
Oh
you hear the crackling deceleration does
like the best part
I saw the deceleration guys nasty
render an event
something like this would be the best
baseline registers like the the view
seems kind of nice right like trees and
stuff imagine just having a tracks
straight line
yeah but mind you I went to a racing
track and they need like a big opening
yeah like they need at least four five
just in case the car struck topic my
name even
three cars racing it's going to be
dangerous right yeah let's go and we are
