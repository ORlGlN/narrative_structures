through there's other cars we just
arrived at the mall I'm gonna give my
car in for a wash because it is
absolutely filthy right now like it's
disgusting I thought I'd show you this
ra ra
okay there is a 458 speciale in the
parking lot let's see that
Oh
it's coming in the valley too so let's
go around and see it check that out guys
two Ferraris the red ones leaving I
think and the white one has come to take
its place not bad at all not bad at all
so there's actually a lot of really
really nice guys here today look at this
it's like this classical car which looks
really really funky I love these like
tubes going across it but wow that would
be something awesome to drive around in
I followed the four five eight special
all around just to show you a bit fare
absolutely gorgeous gorgeous car however
I have some big news for you guys
because I know how much you guys love
our car videos this Sunday my sister is
going to be test driving the new
Lamborghini Huracan
that's the read for five a tresor leave
anyways yes she is going to be test
driving the brand new hurricane now the
difference is in the brand new one is
that it's two wheel drive just through
rule which makes it more exciting we're
going to see this son they should be a
really cool cool blog anyways we're back
here with the OTR a I was meant to
record this first but then the special
er took away all the attention but the
re is an absolutely gorgeous car
I just love this car because it's sporty
and it kind of blends in at the same
time
anyways I missed that good old car
spotting days I used to be 24/7 running
two cars to see them but I guess I kind
of stopped for a while which to the bad
thing so check out this street fire
thing they have going on in the middle
of the virgin snow here this is really
really cool and they've got loads of
machines everybody's playing that's
awesome this bigger as I think I'm
stronger why are they laughing at me
they think I was smaller than that
Street fire guy and it's very heading
off to down
again I've come over to the night office
so now I'm going to the magic planet
because I've got a couple of points on
my card and I can buy like these toys at
the moment I'm not sure if I should get
one of them bubble machines or like a
little gun so that's what me and my mom
are trying to choose right now by the
way the space is really really really
loud I ended up getting the bubble gun
because I want to see how bubbles react
with the bubble gun that's like a tongue
twister so because I came over here to
the valley I had to show you this car
because I kind of fall in love with
these Mercedes GLA this one in specific
is a GL II 63s it's the V a Biturbo as
you can see it says on the side as well
and I just absolutely love this car it
reminds me of the x6 but it's just like
an AMG Mercedes version and it just
really really does look aggressive and
mean you've got the four exhausts at the
bottom and yeah it's just it's just one
of them four-wheel drive cars you'd want
to have at the moment there's not many
of these cars but I think once there's
more production of these these are going
to become a very very popular car
anyways moving on next to it we have a
really really nice ghost a white ghost
absolutely love Rolls Royce as you guys
know and yeah just a couple other cars I
love that g wagon especially because of
its plate number just the number one
saudi-arabia plate pretty cool
anyways I did say I was going to have a
quick stop at the mall because I need to
go for my conference school but look
what showed up in the valet a BMW IA now
I'm not sure if you guys watch a lot of
youtubers but there was a youtuber by
the name of optic nadeshot who bought
one of these and he actually sold it
three weeks later to get a G Wagon so I
don't know I think I would have kept
this car because it looks really really
cool but he needed the G Wagon because I
it was more practical for him so where I
read like guys and I've got a Corvette
next
to me a killer red light white Corvette
next to me I want to see if he thinks to
be honest I'm not even gonna speed guys
don't worry this is one battle I'm not
going to win like a green light
we stopped by the supermarkets because
we need to go get my sister her favorite
Nesquik powder
I hope the percentage she wants is
unavailable she has to do with like the
rubbish one she has a whole like thing
with it she's like no you have to get
the one that's the highest cocoa
percentage or something like that
my mom just made a huge huge scene in
the supermarket and everybody was
looking tonight where's my phone where's
my phone
and guess where it was it was in her
back pocket how do you feel everybody
was like trying to help they're like
where is it
I started cooling it she was sure that's
embarrassing mommy what's even worse is
once it started ringing she was walking
through the I was trying to look for it
while it was in her back pocket the
whole time shake my head everybody was
looking at us mommy everybody so I just
got home
and my sister has a new painting okay I
can't show you it guys I'm sorry
basically it's a fresh idea she came up
with and she doesn't want to show unto
this fully finish up because you know
how it goes when you have good ideas
people take them so once it's finished
up I'll show you I think is this the one
that's going to go for our house if I
want to sell it then it's gonna be you
know like a good offer other words I
really want to keep it so you heard it
that guy's it's probably going to stay
in our living room unless like you know
a ridiculous Afrikaans but she really
does want to keep that and it looks nice
I think would it really don't when she
finishes it okay in about five minutes
time I shouldn't be going into my
conference cool guys let's see what goes

oh no the left with a bear was what
bubbles crying about
anyways requiring today's vlog I want to
talk to you guys because you're like my
family or my scores and I like giving
you as much advice as I can and today's
advice would be guys anything you're
going to do in life make sure you also
do it with patience just keep pushing
forward but never rush into anything
take it one step at a time I always say
this and the reason I'm saying again
today for example as you saw today I had
a conference cool this isn't my first
I've had so many other meetings and
business-related stuff in regards to
YouTube but the reason none of them went
through is because there's gonna be a
lot of people coming forward they are
not going to come forward for the good
of you and if you wait enough and just
have enough patience eventually you're
gonna get what you want and today as I
said I think this could be a
breakthrough for our channel we're gonna
see about that anyways and yeah just be
patient guys don't play yourself because
people are trying to play you constantly
and you got some over the another blogs
they also happy and positive young yolo
goodbye
