good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog I'm just saying you're above me
what's wrong bubbles I already do like
but was he so cute so today has been a
bit weird my mom to start one out now
they had some stuff to do and I'm just
sitting here with bubbles the
complaining cat nobody doesn't like me
that much
alright so I'm gonna be completely
honest with you guys today I'm on the
best of moods I just didn't want to
really continue the blog and try and act
or happy when I'm really not
I don't know today I've just had the bit
of stress haven't really had a good day
and that's why I'm seeing at home I just
didn't really want to go out with my
sister just I didn't want to bring the
negativity with me so I'll decide it's
better if I stay at home but I might go
with my skateboard and have a little
ride around just to get my mind off
things and this guy definitely helps
when I'm in a bad mood I just love him
to bits
so yeah that's what today's vlog is
gonna be like I'm sorry if it's gonna be
like me not in the happy mood you're
normally used to but yeah that's just me
being completely honest with you guys
by the way guys this is kitty the
suicidal cat she always sleeps up here
and looks down the stairs so I don't
know that's just her but I am making my
way out now taking my skin cord and
going for a ride so that's the whoa nice
catch okay so let's go and take a ride
I'm a skateboard hopefully this should
make me feel a bit better
at least the weather's nice
okay so I kind of want to apologize and
I know this seems weird but it kind of
leads on to a topic I want to the
toolbar now the reason I wasn't in
apologize is I'm sorry for vlogging
today and if it makes any a few few
lights down if you're already down but
the reason I am I shouldn't be about
this is because I want to get on to the
topic of daily vlogs now I did I was
going to say I want my other vlogs too
every day but I cut it out I don't know
why I just didn't feel like it was
appropriate but I'm not sure if I will
continue to do daily vlogs cuz some days
I just I'm not sure if you guys want to
see it that's the problem I'm not sure
if you want to see days that I just
don't feel right and which aren't like
happy and stuff like that so just let me
know I'm sitting here by the river you
can see I like the lake I'm sorry I
think yeah it's over there should I go
over then it's it where like the
fountain thing is but that's pretty much
what I wanted to talk to you guys now
let me know if you guys are fine with
bays I'm just not too normal happiness
and stuff like that I can still put out
vlogs show you my real day and talk
about real stuff like me saying I'm not
in a good mood which I'm not or if you
just prefer me having nice happy blogs
you can just um you know what in days
which are not feeling alright before
just take the day off though and
we don't want to see you down and I'll
be fine with that as well so that's the
topic I wanted to talk to you guys about
let me know your opinions and I will
take them into consideration okay I've
taken into my own hands I want a better
view off the little one type of thing
capable of hurting along this very bumpy
pavement the trying get a bit closer
look at the Sun it's so bright I'm
actually starting to feel a bit better
now that I can see more just you know
that feeling when you're around war and
then like kind of feels a bit cooler
that's how I'm feeling right now
not bad look at all these trees are
these like baby trees I'm not too sure
I'm not sure like will they grow out to
be the size of these big trees or are
they just like tiny trees let's see I'm
not too sure okay I'm not too sure about
the trees they might just be little I
know sticks and stuff like that but we
are now closer to the little water show
pretty decent and it's calming let's
just say that there we go
nice you know what as weird as it sounds
I actually do feel a bit bare I'm
actually gonna go around the whole area
I just feel to see everywhere so let's
go you guys are gonna come on this
journey and trust me it's gonna get
smoother I'm just gonna go on the road
and skate over there okay so besides
from whatever is going on today let's
talk a little bit more about the games
which is happening tomorrow I don't
think I mentioned this but I actually
have a media pass so that's what they're
gonna be giving me so your voice is
gonna be a news presenter tomorrow at
the event now I'm not too sure they
think they said I can do interviews with
people or something like that I don't
think I will cuz I've never done an
interview before I don't know how to ask
people questions and I'm just not that
type of person but the good part is I
can video things I think so like behind
the seat exclusives maybe I'm not too
sure whatever it is it's gonna be
amazing I've never been to an event this
is my first one so yeah make sure to
check out okay well for normal lives
make sure to check out tomorrow's video
I think it is gonna be tomorrow yeah the
day after this vlog and yeah it should
be pretty interesting okay I think I'm
going the right way I'm not too sure but
I'm just gonna follow this road and see
where it takes me
so dark okay so I'm finally home I think
the trip outside did make me feel much
better so if any if you are in a bad
mood let's go for a walk good for like a
little tour around wherever you live and
yeah I'm feeling that helps but I think
we should restart the vlog here I think
everything should just start going
positive now back at home with the car
and a special guest while if you named
him Toby is Toby a good name did you
guys vote I don't know someone said Toby
so dart you can barely see
oh yeah there's Toby for you guys I
think I'm pretty sure I saw someone say
name him Toby but let's go inside and
clean up a little bit oh so hot outside
but something that always does make me
happy is the first 20 seconds of this
video I don't know I just love the
bigger this every single time okay so
I'm upstairs now in the bathroom and I
want to hang this thing I'll show you
what it is that pretend like it's never
been open just just pretend idea and
open it let's hang it on the mirror okay
so I'm just taking out its package right
now there yeah got a little hanging man
from this type of thing no wait I think
I dropped something so let's just try
and figure it this out is it like that
is he supposed to be on the outside he's
supposed to be like climbing this thing
I'm not sure okay it's the man that
smells bad back someone's calling me so
I'll see you after I'm on say okay so I
just got off the phone with my mom she
was just checking how I'm doing a home
that told her I'm just being me on the
setting up this weird good smell type of
thing so let's try to know if he's
supposed to go nice I like that see way
let's try it I'm gonna bring a bit down
there so you guys can see you're gonna
see that he's gonna up slightly
something like do that I'm not too sure
how exactly but let's try to figure out
okay you see this sticky thing that's
supposed to go here and I'm sure dish is
supposed to have something I connect
this to this and then
should just think I could never turn
around and then that should hang like
that not sure it is I'm not even gonna
play around with it anymore looks pretty
cool smells very nice and yeah I'm gonna
wail till my mom gets home to see if she
knows where the missing pieces if there
is a missing piece I could literally be
doing something so wrong right now and
you guys are yelling oh you're so dumb
you need to like put something I don't
know if I I'm just confused right now I
can't find any other piece to it but

wrap up the blog here now I wanna talk a
little I think the beginning of today's
vlog I'm not too sure about it so I'm
sorry I like quickly cut to know daily
vlogging because I'm still not sure
sometimes it does really get difficult
to keep up with everyday vlogging
editing it putting you out so imagine my
every single day you just have to do
something and I really don't want like
the quality of the vlogs too full but I
think Long's like this are sometimes
needed just a bit more down-to-earth
show like maybe the other side you guys
might not see cuz I know loads of
youtubers it's just like everyday
happiness and I just wanted to show like
sometimes you can feel down it's not
every day happy day and that's kind of
hard today is beginning of the vlog was
but I do appreciate your support so just
make sure to smash the like button if
you do want me to continue daily
vlogging even if it stays like this make
sure to let me know but tomorrow we have
the gaming event coming so I need to get
good night's rest for that I'm quickly
going to edit the vlog you're watching
right now so this will be out tomorrow
and then the gaming event will be out
after tomorrow straight after this book
so I'm really excited I've never
into a gaming event or any event that is
except from a football match this is the
only thing I think I've ever been to so
it should be different hopefully you
guys will enjoy it and I'll see you guys
tomorrow your squad junior squad for
life and there's younger you're the guys
deuces goodbye
