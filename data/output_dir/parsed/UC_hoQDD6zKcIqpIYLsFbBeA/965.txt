vlog today I'm finally gonna be
customizing my penny board like I told
you guys I would I was originally gonna
spray-paint I don't know if you can see
the spray paint on my table over there
so I was gonna use this to spray-paint
it but then I tried out and it was going
off the skateboard and not staying I
know a lot of you told me I have to sand
it or use some other things to
spray-paint it so instead I'm taking a
permanent marker pen here you can see it
and I'm gonna be drawing out in every
single circle you can see I tried it in
this bottom one and let's see how it
turns out yay alright so I'm gonna get
started doing this guys it's gonna be
fast forwarded since it's gonna take
forever so let's see how it ends out
