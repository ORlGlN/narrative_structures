oh hey guys what is up
good morning welcome to another vlog
what are you guys doing in the fridge
it's hard to know anyways today is a
brand new day I feel positive the energy
is flowing inside its exact time
camouflage with the walls I don't know
why but yeah today I'm flowing with
energy so hopefully I can pass on to you
guys any of you are having a bad day I
really want you to try and make today
the most positive day of your life just
just be happy because that is the
hardest thing in life go for it
today we're playing some football with
oh-oh-oh playing football with bubbles
and kitty so on what your part is so bad
you go go let's go go it's your church
boss oh he made it
this was supposed to be a bouncy ball Oh
watch out but I think Kitty and bubbles
have relationship issues he's just
taking it he's getting abused oh I heard
that you want me you hold me back cuz
hold me back I wanna fight I will whip
his ass this is my job I work on YouTube
I have to record everything please with
that you're saying please please don't
hate me and saying please don't record
me I'll start recording if you stop
beating me up
the reason I'm sitting on the floor
right now outside is we were discussing
because my sister thought the plate
number was coming off but I've come to a
conclusion that
is pretty solid because she thought I'm
not sure if you can see that that gray
part was supposed to be completely stuck
on but we kind of figured out that it
can't be because then the plate number
would touch your car and even then it
still wouldn't be on what you've even
got trees going in your engine
we have a special yesterday in my
balcony look at that
toby is upstairs so Toby actually comes
from downstairs you go get your slippers
yeah he jumps up that tree runs across
here and then jumps in here
Oscar Toby house here man she never
touched him hello told me to touch you
here we go and then he tried to attack
you yeah that's before but now he's kind
of got used to us so you guys ready to
leave wow it's such a small bag you have
to fold or one tissue you can't even
have a whole pack but first let me take
