space but that side the core is
completely like what what do you see
that that is insane like if you look at
it from an angle like that you think
it's hit look at how hard is like I'm
trying to not hit this guy's car so I
ended up getting into the car through
the passenger see and just jumping
across guys but I also got on I checked
the car to see like if there's any like
scratches on the side but thankfully
nothing happened on that side anyway so
yeah oh my goodness up like if I was the
