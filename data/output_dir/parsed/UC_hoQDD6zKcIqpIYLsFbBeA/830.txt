good morning guys welcome to a nother
look I said they're making these so
heavy right now I thought I thought I
can't do it with one man I thought did
you try it please my mom is making fun
of me this whole morning cuz I can't
lift that was on hand let's see her try
one hand know one hand one hand exactly
so happy I just can't find any power in
my head so as promised yesterday I'm
gonna cut you straight over to a clip I
recorded about a month ago off my money
collection and then after that you're
gonna see bits and bobs off a vlog so
hopefully you enjoy if you do smash that
like button and I'll see you guys after
the collection piece alright let's get
started with this money collection video
so initially I was planning on showing
you an old video I shot the collection
after watching it back I so I didn't
really show the money to properly so I'm
retaking it now there's two parts when
it comes to my money collection the
first part is my $1 so you guys know I'm
completely obsessed with $1 bills I went
and bought myself 101 dollar bills from
three different like currency exchange
places because apparently nobody really
keeps $1 because they're like not really
valued what nobody goes in there to take
$1 so I have to go to three different
places together but when it comes to my
main money collection it's in this
plastic bag so I'm going to take you out
for you guys a lot of these were gifts
look at that look look at this money
connections strapped up with an elastic
band
okay by the way I just recently added
this which was from one a few
subscribers I think it was repair it's a
Canadian $1 so that is where we're going
to start this money collection so first
of all obviously the Canadian $1.00
moving on I found this like really
ripped up $10 bills so I'm
going to put this to the side from now
okay now let's get on to the foreign
countries I'm also going to try and tell
you which ones were gifts and which ones
were not we're going to start off this
collection with my Durham's that is
money from the UAE which I live in right
now okay that is a 100 dirham nope and
this is a 500 dirty know if you guys
wanted to see BAM I've actually got
three five hundred dirham notes and one
100 dirham note in the collection so
this is just like keep it to the side
type of thing now the next note or next
couple of notes I just because I keep a
lot of notes from specific countries is
the Singaporean dollars I think that's
what they're anyways I've visited
Singapore twice and I've collected these
in my times there so this is to 100
dollars in Singapore then I brought a
top of the 50s which looked like this oh
okay
okay then I've got a ton and I've really
been a ton of ten dollars like it is
that is insane I don't even know how
much that is and finally I've got the
smaller notes like the fives which are
green and then the twos which are purple
there you go and that is my Singapore
dollars and if you're wondering I
actually got these myself when I was on
holiday there so these are not gifts the
next currency in this collection is
South African brands I've also been to
South Africa twice I mean Singapore
twice South Africa twice I think we have
like a tendency of visiting everywhere
twice so that is a 10 South African
brands
these are twenties next up we've got the
50s
okay that's still a 20 by the way these
are the 50s they look like pinky boom oh
okay I've got a load of hundreds now do
let me know these are worth a lot in the
my section because I've actually kind of
lost the value of my currency collection
so I want to see if any of you can add
it up and convert like all to one
currency so I'm not sure how many 100's
I see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 I
think this might be like I don't know 80
pounds 70 pounds but there you go that's
the 100 and then this is the 200 grams
and got four of them
okay that is South African money that is
a mix of stuff I got holiday I took some
of my sisters when she came back from
holiday and saw my mom's and yeah I
think that's how I got the Rings okay
next up in the currency collection we
have the British counts obviously a
couple months back I was living in the
UK and I decided to bring a couple of
pounds with me this is 5 pounds actually
that's one more firepower for you this
is 10 pounds and then finally to 20s I
actually have no 50 pounds in my
collection which is very very odd what
are you doing no are you slacking are
you slacking with this collection okay
next up is my dollars and probably like
more you just showed us your $1
collection no actually okay I do have a
couple of $1.00 here but this is my $5
we have my $10 which are here about
three of those a $20 or two of them
anyways and finally yeah now 500 bra I
don't know I think these were action
give it to you by my sister she had like
some change when she came back from
America and so she gave it to me so yeah
that's where they came from and the rest
of it I think I just got from the
currency exchange places okay now moving
on we have the Crenn or I believe this
is Swedish money if not please correct
me I think this was given to me by my
auntie not exactly sure to be honest I
feel bad that I don't remember
but yeah that is Mike Rinder I've got
100 and a 20 not sure how much that is
worth I hope it's really a big amount
this whole thing I'm going to show you
was actually given to me by a friend now
boom ah I actually could not believe it
when he gave it to me but he did tell me
that although it looks like a lot you
said it's not worth a lot now this is
real short amends its Persian money
Iranian money so this is ten thousand
reals
all of these each yo if this was like
ten thousand pounds I'd be a millionaire
like damn bro I should know I think it
says a hundred thousand what a hundred
thousand somebody let me know how much
these are worth in the comment section
then moving on we have the five thousand
yo okay no fifty thousand sorry fifty
thousand reals and then we have the two
thousands this is insane or the twenty
thousand
I keep wondering a zero from it then we
have the ten that lessens there we have
the five thousands I can imagine Sony
watching this collection and they're
like brah look at this all of this money
that we have I don't know the 200 the
100 I really love this currency just
because it makes my collection looks so
much bigger than it is
so shots my friend that gave me one of
them because it's completely made my
collection look much bigger than it is
and last currency in this collection is
the Hong Kong dollar yo this bill right
here is my favorite Oh time bill
actually except from the one dollar
which I think looks dope this looks
really cool like look at the colors in
this No yo shout my homie Carlo because
he's from Hong Kong but damn son this is
some don't know life anybody is this
real because look I'm not sure if both
of these are Hong Kong
because this also looks like it's from
like Hong Kong but what's the difference
is this like a special one that somehow
acquired these were actually given to me
by somebody but I can't remember who
exactly so I'm sorry but damn some you
got the $10 and we got the $20 anyways
that was a really long collection video
I hope you guys enjoyed let me know what
currencies I should get next a couple of
my friends said I need to get rupees

forward to getting yeah let me know of
other currencies I should add to the

I didn't look too much my kind of
explain why but if you did enjoyed this
collection video smash the like button
and enjoy the rest of the vlog peace
guys I've never tried this in the qaol I
know everyone always puts their
sunglasses up but I don't think it suits
me okay so we're back from that money
collection video hopefully you enjoyed
it so let's continue the rest of today's
vlog it's still the morning actually
and my mum decided to get some tea with
milk so go ahead and show them how it's
done okay this is how you do it guys
check this out you put the tea in first
oh okay and then this is the part I love
oh
that looks so awesome I love doing that
I'm thinking about getting a new watch
guys and I kind of want your help
so before you start commenting what
watch I should get I think it's
reasonable to tell you my budget so I'm
going for anywhere between obviously
zero and one thousand pounds I've been
looking at a couple one they watch
collections here and they have this
really nice I don't know if you can see
that let me zoom in it's like the ones
where they have like an open face they
look really really gorgeous look at it
you can kind of see a while it's ticking
so anything really nice like those
watches or anything really really cool
so if you find cool designs and watches
I don't know send me the Amazon links or
whatever you have and I'll take a look I
really want to get a new watch like I
used to buy watches on every couple of
months and it's actually allowed a year
and I haven't got any tied to my
collection so I think it's about time we
can all like maybe you bite your ideas
down and please don't write anything
like I know your role is your Audemars
but yet because those are way out of the
budget at the moment I just want like a
casual watch so anything between zero
and 1,000 pounds ish so maybe I can go a
bit over but it has to be something nice
if you know I mean so yeah let me know
what you guys think upstairs or the roof
my mum always wants to show you the roof
here like we've been here 10 times every
time I'm here just I look at the roof
blow and look at the roof that okay now
you have to add to the budget on my
watch okay I feel so so scruffy it's
been a good couple of hours since I lost
blog today and when I was with my mom in
the mall after that I went out with some
friends I told you guys about this
yesterday and basically why I did today
was take the day off
vlogging right even though I'm vlogging
now it's not really proper vlogging if
you know I mean but tomorrow's bugs
gonna be on point and if you're
wondering your ball why didn't you blow
with your friends a lot of the people I
hang out with surprisingly don't like
the blog camera they just don't like
being on the camera so sometimes you see
we're out with people not just like
vlogging myself I guess after a while
that even gets
imagine you're trying to hang out with
someone and they're talking to a camera
light yo what's up what's good and then
pro dude I find it freaky so I was like
today would be the perfect day to take
one day off blogging kind of rejuvenate
and yeah had something prepared for you
guys so you guys weren't even missing
out
but for now before I in today's vlog or
mini vlog let me know what watches I can
get within that budget I gave you guys 0
to 1000 pounds you can convert in any
currency you want and yet it doesn't
need to be any designer watch it could
just be a random brand like send me the
links like this this is a Western watch
I have no idea
the about the company Western and I just
bought it because I thought it look nice
so leave me links and I'll go check them
out and yeah hopefully I should get a
new watch soon because I haven't had one
in my ages for now I'll see you guys
tomorrow with another vlog and yeah that
do that creepy talking to the camera
think y'all know Yolo bye
