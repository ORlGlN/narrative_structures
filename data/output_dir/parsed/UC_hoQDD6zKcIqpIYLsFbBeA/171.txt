hockey and he gave me extra extra hot
cheetos and look at my tongue

we're heading onto the first ride and I
know this sounds weird wherever you're
watching this and whoever's around you I
want you to put your hands in the air
while you're watching the video and try
and feel like you're on the roller
coaster that sounds like a good idea
right

happening but right now there's a bunch
of dancing happening hi guys so for now
we're actually done over at the theme
park the thing is I only blog the first
ride for you guys because it's like the
coolest blog one but we had a ton of fun
doing other crazy things but before we
leave I want to show you this area like
this is the VIP area guys what is this
sparkling water no no no that's why they
don't like any water with my hand
apparently that's good for when you have
like stomach problems anything before we
leave my boy Marilyn I'm always lugging
okay you're like what's happening to the
ice but before I leave my boy Marwan got
me a ton of things from when he was in
America and they're all like food and

things anyways for now we're officially
heading out for you guys I just realized
this is all in the Louboutin bag this is
the coolest part the VIP lounge oh look
what we have over here guys but now
we're officially saying goodbye to

it is I'm sure most of you know I'm a
young Don he's a 15 year old businessman
mogul he is the owner of sprayground
in Dubai and then East Boyle a Middle
East how are you so business minded at
15 years old he's hanging out with my
father mostly before because when I was
9 years old I was working with my father
yeah because we had like we have a
driving school yeah so when I was
printing the license booking the
appointments when I was 9 years old for
2 months when I had the summer vacation
yeah so the mind is like starting you
want to I want to make money I just
don't want to depend to my father when
I'd be 20 or 30 I just won't do my own
thing you know
yeah I don't be normal we rushed her
good friends I I know all of this but I
feel like a lot of you guys don't know
I'm nine years old he was working like
full-time in his father's company I had
my own office I was booking appointments
when because we have a dummy school
where a book appointments license I take
the picture of that they say this guy's
younger like sorry

because I you know when you bought any
place he said yeah this number come to
this table

matter what age you are watching this
video

want any age by if you're seven eight
nine person in the Middle East this year

do y'all still my buddy a few moments
later a few moments later were reunited
any words of wisdom for them
just work hard that's actually something
actually alright
people think once you reach that level
cost you haven't know but you always you
have to work yes hard and maintain that
I know we always joke around in the
blogs but if you guys want to make you
successful you have to always grind like
marijuana wakes up like 6:00 in the
morning every single day and it's just
hard work man it's hard work guys
anyways for now he's heading out I mean
listen guys look hard work pays off and
this car is absolutely beautiful so yeah
sometimes you just have to appreciate
the people around you and I'm not just
saying this because marijuana is my boy
but I serve when you have like positive
minded people around you that work hard
they kind of like give you energy if you
know what I mean
so that's what I'm trying to say guys
