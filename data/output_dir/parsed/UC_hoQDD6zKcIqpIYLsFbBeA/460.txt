vlog how you are doing I'm actually
going over to a car event today is like
over 45 cars it's gonna be like a really
sick Drive the thing is the reason why I
love going to these events it's always
great to build new contacts because it's
really important like a lot of the crazy
stuff I do it's because of the people I
know so yeah anyways let's go to this
event let's have some fun and then go
we are now here at the event guys the
lineup is pretty crazy I have to say I
probably found my favorite colored car
here look at this
there is a chrome baby blue mclaren over
here with a red interior Wow amazing car
this is just oh so you have somebody
else you just made over to the event
which you guys may know check it out we
got the blue Bugatti that is right and
he's turned up with the whole squad of
cars if you remember the Rolls Royce the
Bentley and the Beast
so the turnout today is actually way
more than I expected guys like I don't
even know half the cars cuz usually I
know most of them but we have a lot of
special people here today we had the red
Bugatti now we have the blue guy we have
a nine one eight over here oh my
goodness look at these beasts you got an
Aventador or okay you know what I am so
excited for the drive that's about to
happen you don't even realize it so
let's see how this goes I just want to
say the hotel where all of us are being
at this place is beautiful man

it's about to get crazy
that is a McLaren p1 by the way what a
gorgeous gorgeous car Wow hey I call

probably the best events of entry for a
while I'm gonna be honest one I didn't
know expect this go now we got the
McLaren ladies over here that's what's
up hello
there's so many cars are extremely loud
right now my sister hasn't even got here
yet she's running a little bit early
look what fuck me the car is honking I
hope she doesn't miss the drive is the
drive is now starting we got all the
boys on the road so let's get it here
goes nothing
the thing is I actually think we have at
least a hundred million or probably way
more in cars today so
we made ours everybody
Oh
we're no longer lost boys as you can see
a bunch of Arty's 11
I think we've been split up into like
three groups the first group which are
trying to catch up to right now is the
blue guy the p1 the nine one eight the
group we're even
in the middle and oh my goodness this
cars quicker
the loss group is like my sister who
hasn't even made it to the event or
anywhere close so they're just going to
get your leg
whoa
to say
it just
you want some of this
so it's been a crazy crazy drive so far
I think we've just stopped by the road I
don't know why but I'm enjoying it man
the deserts over here
thing is all the cars are like scattered
like we have the Bugatti he's actually
behind us I thought was in front of us
now it's mined us and now everybody's
just parked alongside I think to just
like recoup and see where everybody is
let's go let's go
but look at it oh my goodness these
noisy cars
another quick stop ball look at the road
right now boys oh my goodness there's so
many cars in the road we finally made it
over to the p1 and everything else boys
so that's a pretty good sign look at
this bad boy
Oh Oh black p1 out here Wow
I'm not sure exactly where we are but
look at what there is over here there's
like a bunch of horse riders that is
insane hello so you finally made it over
to our first stop and look behind me at
the ridiculous lineup so the first place
we are I don't know what they call these
places
it's an old colosi okay I can't
pronounce you guys you know where they
used to do like bull flying and stuff so
they're actually parking all the cars
off to take some nice photos so now that
we're here I can show you them a little
bit bear this one oh the p1 oh my
goodness guys's just look at this view
right here this is like a futuristic car
that I love we got the flying stuffs
over there and then I'd I don't even
know it's just car heaven right now I
really feel like just jumping and trying
to get that drone like it's so close to
me if you thought it couldn't get cooler
a horse just turned up to the event
yep I don't know how this is possible
literally a horse in front of all these
cars what is going on today guys I do
have to say this is a very unique event
free oh Jesus I don't know more selfies
upon guys look who finally made it over
to the event guys three hours later what
the hell yeah we were helping you out
with your video - yeah honestly my video
was taking ten minutes guys these
they're three hours late yeah I'm so
sorry so by the time my sister made it
over here I think everybody is heading
out but I was like why not check out the
place we've come to because this space
is really really cool and unique so
basically it's it's an arena guys and
they have like events going on over here
and what I said at the beginning if I
didn't cut it out I said it's like
bullfighting it's not bullfighting guys
but it's like a really really nice irena
where they do shows yeah like shows and
events and cool stuff I actually stepped
in the horse poop yeah like I'm I'm in
the sand burries and I'm trying to get
it out of my shoe Wow there was a
barbecue going on right there it had the
flames and everything
whoa do you see that yeah I know my
sister has the audacity to do a photo
shoot on her own you could have had a
hundred cars next to you but no you're
so late you only get one car let's head
out of here I think everybody's gonna go
have like dinner or lunch or something
I'm hungry that's all I know so we gotta
eat
I don't know why I prefer drives at
night
you already know we got the Aventador
next to us
oh why did you see the flame on that car
what that was like a flamethrower
bugatti race me brah
we're in a ton of right now and I don't
know where the cars are like the second
group of people but I can hear them like
they're rapping all the way up front I'm
pretty sure something has happened in
this tunnel right now because it is
never busy guys and if you can hear
there's some sort of police or ambulance
coming so I hope nothing serious has
happened with the supercars because
that's the only thing I can think of
right now but let's see so we finally
made it over to the hotel were having
dinner guys there is a ton of cars if
you look behind me they're lining them
up and they're still coming in one by
one by one so I've actually heard the
place we're eating at right now is a
really really nice place so let's go
ahead and head inside I think all the
cars have made it except to I think the
Aventador and Bugatti turned the wrong
way guys so they're gonna be stuck in a
little bit of traffic the last two cars
finally made it over here boys the ones
that got lost the Bugatti and the
Aventador look at that oh so we just
made it into the hotel guys and this
place looks insane
like I've never been here before so it's
always nice going to a new hotel check

it just gets better bear look at this I
didn't even show you this but look at
that staircase
