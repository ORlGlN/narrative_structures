actually got so many nice cars in this
showroom this Bugatti is one of my
favorites they also have this car which
is cool decay MT it's like a road leak
okay TM oh my god I'm gonna get worse it
for that but yeah this is like a road
legal racing car if you see that the
inside looks pretty cool and how did the
doors open on this thing look at this
guy's it's like a little glass that
opens which is really really awesome
over there the wings go up as well but
yet amazing amazing cars Ahmed was
actually the one that set it up for us
today to drive the Bugatti but before we
actually go for the ride I want to go
show you on the cars in the basement so
let's go what are you going to show me

classic sports car some other cars they
have over here guys consists of two
event doors now the black one you see
over there is an Oakley design Aventador
in this matte black color and that's
actually like it's paint job it's not
even a wrap and if you look on the
interior of that thing it looks so so
cool I think it's like what is it is it
leather or Alcantara yeah it looks like
a really cool material but moving on
