local starting this vlog of my sister's
bathroom oh let's go wash our hands key
let's go wash our hands I turn it off in
the I won't okay let's leave we're
starting today's vlog by going to pick
up the Lambo I think anyways if they're
still open we left it with them for a
couple of days now I should two days so
we're gonna go pick it up so we're here
at the Lamborghini service center now my
sister is just inside picking up the car
it's actually loads the Lamborghini
share obviously it's very better than
here but yeah got like a really nice
white Aventador there's a red Gallardo
going and loads inside but yeah I'm
gonna go with the Range Rover my mom
sister I going with the Lamborghini I
might give them the camera I'm not too
sure exactly but yeah so tired right now
it's the morning yeah everything is just
going on alright she's coming out I
think they're going there you go alright
okay well I'm gonna go get inside the
Range Rover that's them going and yeah I
think we're gonna go home drop off the
Lambo and then go out with the range so
that is a plan look at that guy's a
helicopter in the sky oh yeah okay so I
just got home
and Nick oh wow they got here I was
literally waiting for ten minutes and
that's the reason I came out to record
to see when my mama sister get home so
there they are
is that dem but yeah once they park up
we're just going to go head out to eat
I'm literally starving and then I'm
going to come home and on vo why I got
yesterday at gtex which is like the
gadget place so let's see if your
guesses were right in yesterday's video
okay this is not a good idea to stand in
front of a Lambo imagine she runs you
over
okay two women in a Lamborghini I
already need to go turn off the Ranger
override call me guard because we're
going straight out okay I did I press
the once okay then it should turn off
the turn off I can't see it's too
reflective okay though I've come to the
divine a lot of action never comes in a
food court with you guys look at the
amazing things they have they have like
stuff like that producer Bob not sure
exactly where I'm going to eat yes I did
shave today a little can you tell not as
much of a mess in there are deers
let's go pick lolli we ended up coming
to Hatem it is a Persian cuisine it a
zipper in here so I think I'm going to
go for the kebab
yeah I think not be the best choice I
ordered minced kabob which looks like
that my sister got some chicken kebab
which pretty much looks like that so
we're about to eat I really like about
to be honest you guys probably know that
about me
yeah even comes to bar and they put on
top so milk so you can put it straight
onto your ice I came to show all the
cooking things to my mom because this
shop is pretty cool like especially if
you want to make like cool things so
like I don't know moon-shaped
staff or stars you know I mean so I came
to show my mom what they have what is
that that's a timer I think you twist it
probably male they have our gingerbread
families
that's cool the thing is the same mods
that we got with the little family
because that's the one I got yeah okay
let's go oh my god guys we bought a
green Lambo as your car there's a little
version of your car it's a mini
hurricane all right so it's time to go
home guys let's go and show you my new
phone okay unboxing time probably know
what it is from the tile got a huge
knife to unbox it so I'm going to tell
you everything I went to gtex and
basically I told you it's an event and
all the greatest deals come out so I'm
going to tell you how much I've waited
for and everything that came with it so
first of all let's get into why I got so
I did get the iPhone 6s I got it in gray
simple person you can tell I always wear
like black and gray stuff so there is
not to open it with dish knife you know
and yet this was 3300 Durham's at gtex
and it came with this a 64 gigabyte
version as well just to let you know
free speaker alright that's the first
thing it came with got a whole bag of
goodies that came with it I got a case
I know it's pink but I'm going to go
exchange it they didn't have any more at
GTECH so I'm going to go to their shop
and get another color so it came in a
free case and just quickly show you
everything else it came with a car
charger adapter okay not that a screen
protector oh boy it also came with a
magnetic holder I'm not sure exactly how
this will work let's try and use it
today and also a power bank so I think
that is about it yeah those are loads of
leaflets I got their vent so let's get
into opening this phone bye
I don't think this knife is meant for
this job but we'll do it anyways okay
Wow if you didn't cut it perfectly but
yeah the last time I bought an iPhone
was in forever let's pull this I know
everyone waits for it to come down but I
don't have that type of patience so
there you go there is my phone Dinah a
lot of people were like oh my god it
looks amazing to be honest it looks the
exact same thing I'm not even gonna try
saying and looks amazing because it
looks like exact same as iPhone 6 which
looked really good anyways so there
there's a phone let's press the button
to see what happens is it on no it's not
go I don't even know how to turn on
iPhones anymore oh yeah you guys can see
yourself in the reflection there so I'm
gonna start opening all the gadgets and
stuff so standard box in your Apple
comes with headphones blah blah blah
everyone knows about this stuff I really
want to start using the camera because
that's the main reason I got it a 4k
camera and I know a lot of people say it
feels heavier actually does so
hello guys can you see that hello kind
of you hallo hallo there you go
hallo
hello no more broken five there you go
completely cracked up that is the main
reason I got a new phone look at that my
phone actually went green Omid are they
and the new phone is the iPhone 6s and
think so I think I'm going to configure
this later I don't even know the
password for my Wi-Fi so let's just get
through all these little gadgets like
that as well so a power bank let's see
what this is
oh okay so that is the power bank and it
comes with two cables okay whoa look at
that
it comes with cables for everything the
five the six and I think yeah Samsung
phones pretty cool power BEC gonna use
that layer definitely then we got the
screen protector these things are so
hard to put on I swear I'm going to get
like a hundred thousand bubbles okay
actually I forgot to do the main thing I
love that noise I really love that noise
ah okay that that was the most
satisfying thing now so I'm gonna I'm
gonna use this with my old phone so
pretty much you just pull out that wire
plug it in look at this even extends
what so I'm gonna play one of my
favorite songs for you guys ever since I
left to see you sorry listen going now

addicted to this song lately literally
