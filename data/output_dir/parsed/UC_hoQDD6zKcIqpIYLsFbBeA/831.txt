hey guys mo here and welcome to another
vlog today I run into too few awesome
guys hello
it's Harry and Ali they just came by and
I even gave my little autograph I'm
sorry I don't have like a proper
autograph but I hope that helps anyway
so it's good to you guys I'll see you
guys next time high five good morning
everybody and welcome to another vlog so
I was just standing outside here and I
was thinking to myself it was this very
view this view that I made a video on a
couple months back I'm not sure if you
remember it called my divine life that
is my first ever video with 1 million
views it's insane to think this exact
view was the thumbnail of that video
which attracted so many people to watch
the video wow I'm not sure if you can
hear that bar neighbors are having some
sort of construction done there's loads
alike going on I don't even know what
you call that but me and my mom are
going out today to do some oh and we're
going out to do stuff like office work
Eastern or not we're not really doing
office work but we're getting at some
stuff sorted out or my mum is anyways
you ready you're ready that's scar look
at that incredible view in the morning
I'll try and get myself some cornflakes
and they have these crocodile shaped
Coco Pops look at that that is pretty
awesome so I think this would recognize
that my normal cereal
I'm not sure if it's gonna taste the
same but it's it looks really cool yeah
okay I'm gonna get one of these this
supermarket is taking it to the next
level that you can buy five I saw one
whoa we're finally home okay it's not
even a it's just 12 o'clock we went
outside to be honest we didn't do much
because the place you went wouldn't even
saw our stuff out were like through we
got these documents all right no you
need to go get it stamped blah blah blah
but I got myself some go-go pops come on
open up let's see okay that looks odd
being completely honest when you open
them they don't actually don't like
crocodiles they just fly blobs let's see
what ball with inch bubble you want some
is that a yes or no okay that's enough
the funniest thing happened right now
and I seriously don't know how to react
to this so I was just sitting here
editing one of my videos and my sister
came downstairs it was like mo are you
doing a signing at the Dubai wall and I
was like what do you mean are you going
crazy like how did that come into your
head and then she told me that I
commented on my own YouTube video
letting people know are we doing a
signing like an autograph signing I was
like okay that is completely ridiculous
so I came on my video and look at that
Moloch's hey guys I'll be signing
autographs at 6 p.m. tomorrow night at
the Dubai Mall so wait there is a fake
Molag commenting on my videos guys that
is not me I'm just telling you from now
because at this current moment this is
the only con I've seen them write but I
want you guys to not listen to any of it
the way to check is like this so if you
see anybody by the name of mo blogs
comments hover over there
name and you'll probably see zero
subscribers that is proof that it's not
my account because if it was my account
would say a hundred K there and at the
moment nothing biggest happened I've
only see them write this comment but I'm
just saying it in case some sort of
weird stuff or weird comments come up
anything rude or disrespect me check who
it is commenting by like hovering over
their name and seeing how many
subscribers they have because I
guarantee you they're going to start
doing this a lot more in the
conversation because I've seen it happen
to bigger youtubers and this is the
first time it's happened to me but damn
brothers am i the fake mole blogs or
who's the fake mole blocks here is it me
or is it then anything that you see in
the comment section question it hover
over the name make sure it's me and
don't get bored please face err I forgot
is something I always thought I've used
every day and I'd fall in love with
because cuz all my friends had it and I
was like yo that's so cool I wish I had
one and when I bought it I never hadn't
got using except in the first like two
days I bet this happened so lucky
whoa okay something just broke yo the
handle just completely came off okay
wait what a handle just rust it off
hello
we're outside
by today I'm going to be doing a smaller
experiment for you guys so have you ever
wondered what happens if you shoot your
underarm deodorant you probably haven't
but I'm going to do it anyways so that's
the only thing I could find in my room
that I didn't want so I'm going to just
shoot it and see what happens like what
type of damage
you reckon will happen I just think
maybe like a hole through if anything I
don't think anything bad will happen
can't do the job I may never just try it
is empty let's go set up our target
which is the underarm deodorant what you
reckon is gonna happen to it I don't
think much should happen to it okay
right there I think maybe we need to put
it right against this so when I shoot it
wait sure you have the UM like I don't
take the lid off this is gonna leave us
a little tiny tiny target but if we can
hit it dobry pretty awesome don't you
reckon okay let's go okay we'll just put
this you're good measure I can't even
see the target it's so dark out here
I saw I think I might hit that
onto the target
you can hear again
as long as I smoke I don't think I hit
it I don't think I'm gonna be able to
hit it guys we're coming super close
because my target accuracy is so bad so
hopefully you can hit this soon
close your eyes buddy okay wait let me
get my glasses I get my glasses
hey be right back I can I'm fine I'm
fine
like it yeah you see that yeah it broke
it the hole actually went through it and
passed this side yo that is awesome I'm
gonna shoot it one more time so I can
completely destroy it damn
everything just completely shattered I
lost the rest of the pieces how look at
it there's pieces everywhere do you see
that
yeah yeah that is awesome so I hope that
answered your question if you guys were
ever wondering what happens if I shoot
my children this is pretty much what
happens it kind of just breaks up into
loads and loads of pieces like this
thing just came out completely like flop
into the air Wow
whoa okay that's a wrap we're going
inside
good job this is the last we're going to
be seeing off this broken absolutely
shredded deodorant I mean damn okay
let's just put this in the bin now sorry
look at the sky is gorgeous I'm going to
show you my absolute favorite thing to
have for dinner so it's these nuggets
like I don't know chicken nuggets you
call it and you put this like what's
this powder hold on it I don't know what
nothing
that's not flour there's no flour mommy
here oh yeah erases these chicken
nuggets with this like powder and it
makes it crispy and it's my absolute
favorite dessert to have so if you're a
woman out there and you want the way to
my heart make that I sweat I tend to get
something stuck in my throat when I'm
just chatting rubbish I can't even
breathe anymore yo my eyes they just
completely faded out and redness so
tomorrow I'm actually going out with a
couple of friends and I won't be
blogging all right hold up hold up
before the head colors come in so
instead of blogging I will be doing
parts maybe bits and pieces in between
but I don't really want to hold the
camera too much tomorrow maybe it's cool
like a day off tomorrow instead though I
have something planned which is kind of
special anyways I know you guys might
like it and it's a video about my money
collection so you probably like what
money collection I'm going to show you
the thumbnail I don't want to give away
too much fame okay nope I'm not showing
you more than that but guess what
currencies I actually have in the
collection to be honest it's a video
that I really liked and I don't know why
I didn't put it out maybe just did a VIN
with the flow and I thought I'd keep it
for a day that I wanted off so tomorrow
I'll try and edit that and put it for
tomorrow's vlog I hope you enjoy it
because I personally love my collections
of things and I think it's really cool
for you guys so guess what currencies I
