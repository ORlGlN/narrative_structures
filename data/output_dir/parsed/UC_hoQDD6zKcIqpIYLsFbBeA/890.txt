all the way to the portal are you can

these roads because obviously the beach
is next to here and I'm guessing people
own these yachts or maybe they're used
for commercial use not too sure exactly
what it's going on but yeah it's really
nice just walking by loads of little
like boats and yachts and stuff like
that yeah this one's like a little
speedboat not too sure exactly what it

really nice Rolls Royce and I ran into
another green Hawk and I really like the
front ends that have like like different
color top to the bottom I think someone

you know what your boy would really like
but I want to see your opinions too and
why I think you should be one color yeah
you know that's the thing I really like
I told them my in the floor I really
like it when it's like the roof is a
color and then the body is yeah a
combination definitely alright now that
I want to apologize for two things
first of all I apologize for doing this
with my hands a lot I don't know why I'm
gonna stop so that's the last time you
would have seen it from now at the
blowin anyways but I'm just the type of
person that always uses my hand to
explain things you can see now second of
all I apologize for always swiping my
hair also another bad habit I need to
get rid of now that that's out the way I
hope everything is fine with us so I
