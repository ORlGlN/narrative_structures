have a rest and have fun it is so hot in
the parking you guys don't even believe
it so I'm going to go inside and record
the rest my sister mom just got out so
let's go and all right my sister decided
she wants her car washed
all right so that's just way until she
does that hi guys so I'm currently in
Dubai Mall and look at this dinosaur
thing they have I think this is real
bones by the way
and that looks awesome I'm here on my
sister she's going to do her vlog as
well look at that that is so cool like I
think it's a real dinosaur I'm going to
go read about it
yeah one second let me see if there's
any information
it's a dip low dose forever longus and
it was discovered 2008 in america that's
pretty cool guys over there he's
cleaning the screen there guys we're
gonna head off and we'll see you in a
bit so recursively I'm with my sister
and mum and we found these great seats
in the corner like if you guys know
we're dividing them yeah it's got like
what type of theme was that oh yeah that
is you go Leah we're next a nooner kabob
which is here and all the other
restaurants are there obviously my
sister and so now we don't need to look
far to get our food they give you like
these things it's like okay
and that tells you when your food has
arrived so once you start eating is
going to be delicious and I'll see you
guys when our food comes sorry
this is upstairs and a shot that's so
cool they have like a skateboarding ramp
I'm trying in the skateboard shop and I
just picked myself up not any more than
that guy's hand so I really wanted some
I've seen them in looks I just decided
to buy it yeah so that that's the board
opportunity I can learn it quickly and
the eye looks decent to be honest I look
at one of these other funky boards they
have like this is the one I'm getting
for everything else that's really cool
so we're gonna go home now my brother
bought a skateboard and he's gonna kill
himself soon lasting back like alright
pretty much the guy genius idea was
actually a good idea to put two glassing
bags and tape them together but we
didn't have staples for one side but
it's actually pretty cool it goes really
fast okay does anyone have the car keys
because we really need to go I like the
moral force
dude something's missing from the car
what the logo all right so the logo just
went missing off the Range Rover as a
wheel that's how it should be but I
don't know I guess what can you do
so we're currently in IKEA my sister's
picking out a wardrobe because she has
some space in the room I think this is
what she's going for let's open it up
just standard and also sides standard
with some lights so yeah we're just
waiting she's actually customizing it
she doesn't walk the wooden oh I just
showed you here she doesn't want these I
think she's going to get something that
might rolls out and there's shoes on
them or something but yeah we'll see
it's taking really long and I'm so tired
but we should be done here soon and then
we have to go pick everything out from
the storage room so yeah that should be
interesting so we finished up I only got
loads of things literally it's like
three pages and each page is like that
big I don't know if you guys can see
that look at that big list yeah that's
like half the list is like two more
pages but like some are smaller than
this just loads of stuff so we're just
at the cashier now we're going to pay
for it and leave thank God there was
like a picking service they offered and
they're gonna pick everything out for us
and they just pay a little bit for that
and they bring it straight home so
that's a good relief but yeah here are
