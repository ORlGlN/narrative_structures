when you are in these cars guys you
seriously
seriously feel the power of these
vehicle especially the lapper re scars
it's a saying it's my first ride in one
actually so it's really cool to feel it
like I can't even explain in words wow
I'm feeling right now we're in the
downtown boulevard area with the Laffer
re all the bars are next was there's
actually lots of likes as well we just
made it to the Burj Khalifa spectacular
view of this building and they have the
war show going on so it's really really
cool I've never been here when the war
show has been going on at night so
that's a really really cool thing to see
Wow
every time you see this building it
looks fabulous but yeah as you just saw
we just arrived at the Burj Khalifa my
sister and her car and I was in the lap
arari but wow this building I just every
time I come here I can't fathom how tall
it is it's just ridiculous but we have
the laferrari here gorgeous gorgeous
thing honored to sit in it
Wow Wow look at it anyways guys it was
an absolutely amazing experience with
this car today can't believe the drive
but yeah now I think we're gonna have
lunch in the Burj Khalifa we're actually
going to go see like how it looks from
up somewhere there so it should be
really really cool
yeah I'm just super pumped today I'm
excited though Ventura not dope so check
out this entrance everybody Wow in the
roof it's like you know that drum thing
where you like it's like that part of
the drum I don't know what you call it
her it looks really cool anyways let's
get in amazing lounge over here Wow look
at this it's like a water table that is
really cool anyways we're actually
heading inside through here and we need
a pass so let's go get it by the way I
just figured out what this is for this
base over here it's called the world
voices and basically there's drops of
water dropping on these to make like
these sounds and it's supposed to
represent like all the voices from
around the world and it's really cool I
did not know that so can you guys hear
that like once in a while it hits them
metal things the water droplets are
hitting it and making that noise really
really cool I've actually never been in
here and it looks really really cool and
elegant and I think each of these
elevators take you to specific floors so
we're going in this one okay so look at
the residential boys they have over here
it's absolutely gorgeous we're actually
going to check out the view from one of
our friends bases who lives here so it's
going to be really really awesome
they've actually got like security doors
that close so I need to go past this one
as well thank you so so much in but yet
each of these doors closing you can't
open them once you go past them with a
pause so it's really like securitized
and everything so the show just started
guys look at this view let me stick my
camera and it looks amazing Wow Wow
look at that view that's incredible it's
like so much better yeah I know from up
here it looks gorgeous that is really
cool that is really cool it's like a
quick line it's like a snake going
around it
the pattern before
we're actually going to go up the Burj
Kalifa over 100 floors and this elevator
we're going to take right now is super
super quick so let's get in and your
ears start popping like it's that fast
guys I you can only go to 120 third
floor from these lifts so I think it was
made to be really really fast
check this out everybody this is the
whole of Dubai you can see from here
absolutely marvelous like that is a
skyscraper and it looks tidy for up here
Wow I'm scared I'm just gonna back off
you know I do trust this building but a
hundred is just amazing anyways we're
doing like a little tour of the Burj
Khalifa at the moment which is the
tortoise building there any cool to see
spaces we've come over to this library
they have on the 120 third floor as you
can see my sister going through some of
the books and again we have the vision
of the whole of Dubai beneath us like
this is just out race just amazing like
if you think about it how they built
this tower and it's just so high it's
just amazing and to have like a little
library up here you can read and look
over device just and this is a lounge
they have on 120 third floor which is
really really cool you can go there and
eat as you can see or you can just come
sit and chill what are you doing
checking yourself in the mirror
123 floors up I don't think anybody can
see you I'm up right now like cuz I'm up
right now outside the Armani restaurant

already cool hey that's head over is it
a restaurant so you know that entrance
we come by with all of the water I'm
actually behind all of the war so you're
wandering while talking about we enter
with our cars from there and this is
what we see but now I'm behind like I'm
behind all the war you normally see so

wrap for today and super super late
