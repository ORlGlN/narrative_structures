yoyoyo good morning everyone and welcome
to another vlog if you look into the sky
look at that
it's gray it's completely great it was
raining this morning it looks so like
London he looks so London you know
whether if you know I mean look at it
anyways the cats have no food right now
so we have to go by the night bubbles is
complaining because apparently the food
we got it wasn't to his flavor like he
was like I don't like this rubbish get
me better food this is how you know the
weather is weird it's not normally windy
here in Dubai I'm gonna head out to
somewhere I think you guys are gonna be
excited about so I'm heading out to the
Ford dealership here in Dubai our timers
I think you guys might remember last
time when I went for the car shopping
and the reason I'm going there right now
is I actually didn't want to go there
today but Lyndon reminded me of
something yesterday and I was like oh
dang you're so right basically he told
me your mole are you sure that it's even
going to be an availability on a Mustang
because then things are hot like in
Dubai Mustangs are like the thing like
loads of people have Mustangs yeah I
know like in London I never saw Mustangs
but here they're extremely popular and
he was like bro you're probably not even
going to get your hands on one lad the
rate you're going so you should probably
go there and check it out as soon as
possible that's what I'm going to go
today I'm going to see a first of all if
they do even have an availability of one
here sometimes you can actually be
waiting for like six months and then if
that happens I don't know what I'm gonna
do I'm just going to start crying in the
show room another reason we are actually
going is last time I didn't properly sit
in the back seats of the Mustang this
time me and my mom are going we want to
see if you can actually fit because last
time I tried to squeeze and I was like
you know what leave it but I want to see
how how spacious it is I think it might
be like my London Mercedes it might just
be like kind of tight if it is like that
then I'll be happy
I don't want it to be tired than my
Mercedes in London let's you see that's
the out goes just arrived wait let me
lock the car open there we go
let's go check out the cars and see
what's up inside ok we're inside the
Ford showroom as you can see there what
there are two Raptors behind us there
seems to be a lot of popularity around
the Mustang there's loads and loads of
people the bonnet is open so you can
actually see the engine that is what the
v6 engine looks like if you guys are
wondering there was loads and loads of
people around the Mustang so I just came
into the used car section to see what
cars they have here they actually have a
pretty cool Jaguar f-type as you can see
I actually love this car it looks really
really amazing I'm gonna go back where
the Mustangs grow there was so many
people around I was like wait let me
just walk around until I video it
because I couldn't know just like
everybody wants that car ready
ok I'm gonna see if I can actually fit
into the backseat of the Mustang I'm not
sure if you can see the head space is
kind of limited so ok let's see how
tight is it good
good not bad anyway don't see if I can
sit into the driving seat as you can see
I'm sitting inside the Mustang my mom's
in the back because we're testing out
the leg space she says it's like my
Mercedes
so it is tight though like head space in
the back is much less i sat there I'm
not sure if it came out decent but this
is what you'll be seeing from me so this
is the steering wheel with the horse on
it which looks really nice display
everything with the only problem I'm
having at the moment is the back two
seats because they are tight light even
my mercedes-benz was super tight so I'm
not sure if it would be smart because
it's basically going to be a two-seater
car if I do get this because unless
someone's like as small as my mom and
can actually fit in the back to seat so
we're gonna have to see about that I do
like the front though which is pretty
dope if you know I mean look at it it's
even got these really really cool like
air vent type of things here there we go
that's how you open them I'm trying to
struggle how to open these okay so you
could you push on the sides with that
white line alright there you go and
that's how they open so interior I like
just only problem is the backseat which
my mom is seeing in mode you have
someone saw like my is it really bad or
is it like okay it's okay
if someone's too like my mom you see my
mom's head doesn't hit but my head in
the back it hits the roof yeah my
friends would definitely I have I could
friend that's like six foot four
shout-out to Chris like he is tall I
think his head would just be like that
at the back so we're gonna have to see
this is actually the v8 one I'm seeing
it let's get out I think if I do get
this car this is basically going to be a
two-person car you know I mean
you can't get out it's really hard to
get up okay I'm going to run through the
pricing with you for each of the models
so this one which we were just setting
right now the gray one this is a v8 you
can see it right there
v8 and it costs two hundred thousand
dirhams now the white one over here this
one this one's a v6 and it costs a
hundred and thirty thousand Durham they
actually look exactly the same I think
actually no no no this one has the vents
you see I mean this one has that like
events I think because it has more power
you know I mean I don't know what to do
because I really like the car you know I
mean but imagining out like even to
friends like it's going to be hard
because one person has to sit in the
back you mean I mean like the joining
are to BMW and check them out okay I
think we should head off to BMW I just
don't exactly know where it is you can
check out our three series 5 series
check out the prices on them and kind of
compare because I really do need a
comparison I've come over to Mercedes
because it was really close to the
Mustang showroom and I'm going to take a
look at the c-class because that is what
in my price range I think it's this one
that's the C so this is the c-class this
is the one that I might get instead of
the Mustang is around the same price tag
I think it is a bit more let's go sit
inside it is a four-door which has much
more space liquid interior these are the
back seats as you can see so yeah it
does have much more space it is more
like a four person car if you like it
it's good yeah he's been on my side so
obviously my mum prefers this far
because it is foreseer like loads of
people can sit in it to be honest the
interior is gorgeous like it's gorgeous
let me show you we've got these air
vents as you can see right here we've
got the classic lock on Mercedes this
opens like that where you have your two
cupholders and finally this this is like
my all-time favorite thing this size
scroll and then I don't even know how
you use this to be honest my Mercedes
had the old version it just had this but
this one's got this new version so I
might ask about this car I might ask me
I really do like it if you are wondering
how it's just cars I think it starts
around two hundred and fifteen thousand
dirhams I'm not too sure I have to go
slight if I'm serious about then they
start talking to you about pricing and
all the options in the car but it does
look very nice anyways see 200 thumbs up
looks amazing I don't know why I reckon
I will go for this car that and the fit
not the Mustang I do love the Mustang
but this is just more spacious if you
know I mean I know you can actually fit
people your friends can come for door
love for doors because you don't have to
like bend you see and stuff like that so
the Mustang really is like a sports car
it's like your second car okay final
place BMW let's head out take our final
looks and then we go home and decide and
then hopefully next time I'm back to
actually buy a car if you know I mean
all right sounds like Vlad sounds like a
plan let's go I ran across this g-wagen
and this is literally my favorite
combination of Ag wagon so colour black
rings black and interior red please tell
me the door is open for this yes it is
look at the interior on that car that is
gorgeous it smells war just let me sit
inside it okay this this is a really
high car wow you feel like you're on top
of the world so the interior on these G
wagons is beautiful I mean beautiful
look at this look at this the sea
my mom's outside looking at me yeah it's
definitely in my price range it's like
probably over half a million for this
but yeah damn I love this car
I don't know how much it is but it's
probably way too much anyways I had to
just come and show you this car
regardless of me knowing I can't buy it
anyways because this is way too much man
I know it's way too much I'm not even
going to bother asking but on a serious
note guys imagine you had the money for
this Maybach Maybach wait please tell me

another level

dreams let's say good bye guys look at
this awesome Batmobile they have here

4 Series it is more expensive it's like
280 and the 5 Series and the 3 Series
like the base ones I don't know I just
don't really fancy them so I'm gonna
have to say no that's like the quickest
visit ever because we did come so far
why not come and show you some supercars
in the exotic cars so let's go in and
look at sound the car so they have
gorgeous cars over here check out this
Aventador guys it has like a really
beautiful like pattern going across it
the Rings oh my god I think this might
be like a special it might be the SV
actually it does look a bit edgier on
the back gorgeous I am blue I haven't
seen the blue one and I really do like
this colorway but saying that everything
in the showroom looks so nice I even the
Moroccan that we have it kind of looks
more like vibrant here with all the
lights they also have my favorite color
of the event or the matte black now I
love this color
wow it's like a dream car this is the
first time I've actually seen a four
five eight speciality this close like it
looks amazing look at that it's got the
vents here the stripes it looks so much
edgier you've got that extra fine touch
of the vents everywhere this is the
Porsche I wanted to show you now there's
only 25 of these in the world 25 in the
world
I'm standing right next to one I'm so
happy I came to take a look like the
back look so unique let me go and show
you like look at the way the engine is
put out it doesn't even look like your
standard 9:1 it does really look
different or the GTS or the GTS I'm
pretty sure this is the GTS let me check
before you guys kill me this is so nice
yes it is yes it is GT oh geez
okay who unlocked that car I don't even
know I saw that cards made me jump but
the GTS looks absolutely gorgeous there
is so many cars in the showroom like you
can't even pick like which one would you
pick out these I think Lotus people
would go for the Aventador and a load
for the 458 speciale II I'm happy I
dropped by the exotic cars UAE like do
you see the showroom it's got so many
nice cars just it's amazing even when
you come outside they've got like nice
cars they've got so many that outside
they've got like ten lined up we always
do the Lamborghini tunnel run why do I
not the Range Rover
Shh
come come come over here come over here
come oh why is it meowing you got food
my mom came to the rescue eyes at me
ally is he gonna eat it
yeah good job the thing is it only wants
to eat under the car here we're gonna
wait here until it eats it I heard him
meowing and I was like oh yeah there we

take this piece and go give it to him
somewhere else they say don't play with
your food but look at bubbles look at
him
he loves to fling around his chicken I
swear like he plays with it so much
check this out Mima are just sitting
down and I'm going to use this pad I'm
going to write down pros and cons of
each of the cars so on my left we're
gonna have the Mustang and on my right
the Mercedes I think these two are the
cars I want to pick from they're your
Mustang and Mercedes and I'm just going
to jot down some ideas and yeah we can
run through it with you guys so I'll see
you in a moment
Bob will joined us for this discussion
he legit just came and sat down anyways
you pretty much wrote down everything
there is in the main points and here it
is okay so I'm just going to translate
my writing for you so the Mustang looks
good on the outside this is this is all
my opinion anyways I think the Mustang
looks bare on the outside and obviously
has more power however I think the
interior on the Mercedes is better I
think it's more comfortable and it has
four seats like four proper seat so
obviously the Mustang has two at the
back but just to equal it out I'm just
going to put this over here so I'm just
going to put like a little heart just to
say I like the Mustang that's like a
bonus factor you know when you just like
something so it's really even the price
tags Mercedes is around 220 Mustang 200
to the VA let me know about your
thoughts in the consolation Mustang or
Mercedes vote down below help me please
and there is peace from yo-yo squad
bubbles what do you have to say to this
alone publicist completely dead buh-bye
bubbles here eat the camera or
