first time driving this car yeah I've
driven rain service before so hopefully
this should feel the same it is a Range
Rover guys so we're good to go guys see

decided this car would be nice something
magical like one of your fun look how
huge this thing is I have no idea what
two fingers in head
this opens automatic yeah
time to go guys in a long day
all right let's go
so check out who made it back home with
another massive box good morning to our
new living room by the way it's good to
see it in the morning look so so nice I
when I look at this living room it makes
me smile guys I tell me if it gives you
that happy vibe with all of them emojis
Fuu what is it that thing I want all of
you to guess down below and we'll open
it like in a week or something but guess
from now and yeah I just want to see if
your guesses all right I have no clue so
within the next one hour I'm actually
gonna go meet up with a friend to show
you something really really cool and I
probably already put it in the thumbnail
and title so you guys already know but
before I go me and Lana I wanted to show
you something really cool
what is it boom
liar but it is really cool guys when you
click this recharge guys there you go
it's trickling down but besides
something I realized when we are boxed
are led shoes we never like wore them
and use them so today I thought we'd do
a little bit of dancing with our LED
shoes so let's get them on our yeah
let's do this
Hey look at this guy's hey hey Lana's
got hers on kinda you can kind of feel
it if you feel the bun just pressing
like that - here - here you see that so
we managed to find it guys it was
somewhere here where it where's it there
you go boys it's there this is like the
coolest dancing read that ever
whoa give us some dancing boots go on
hit it
oh I can you know I need to turn
yourself it just sounds like someone's
peeing in the corner of the house I
guys imagine working for more like can't
run away from you mom I think you just
move around you see you look good you
know it'll be cool if you can get like
you and all your friends to wear it
together
like that'd be like so rude all of you
walking with these lights on that'd be
so cool you know okay I did get carried
away moment whoa a day in the life of an
LED shoe addict here she goes to the car
guys whoa oh my god that looks so cool
yo seriously guys I think we need to go
on a busy day into valet and get out
with these like imagine you're like
what's up boom
hello you like the shoes they look dope
right thanks van den tada tada tada tada
tada tada
you're even Tobi scared of you man time
to head out I'm gonna go meet up with my
friend now and as I said I got something
really really cool to show you and yeah
it's just gonna be dope by the way I'm
finally gonna take the Mustang I
realized I haven't used it at all it's
been a long time Mustang it's been a
long time engine on
hey that's what's up that's what's up
baby
I Love You Man all right boys I just
made it over to my friend and look
wipeout over here there's an Aventador
being taken pretty nice just gonna take
it off making other things I carry it
and it looks absolutely gorgeous Wow
whoo look at that me
this thing is a monster guys anyways
before I going to show you the special
package I thought I'd show you this cue
agate again you guys remember we stood
next to the black one the other day and
there's a white one now so that's pretty
cool these things are just massive like
look at the size of them compared to the
other cars guys it's just ridiculous
that is a loud Aventador guys oh my god
did you see the flames hi boys so as you
can see right now I'm inside here with
my boy
seh-dee a ka the plug aka lucky as hell
and I hate him having the issues but
let's get straight into this so you guys
already know what it is Kanye West's new
Yeezys the guy came down from America
with a unicorn to hand-deliver to him
because that's how lucky he is
anyways let's open this up so what is it
it's the easy create a great gums we
haven't cited no it's not I'll do
everyday I'll do everything no I started
guys I absolutely love these shoes first
up we have like two bags this is like
one for each shoe right that's how
coolly shoes are I get a bag each and
then BAM so you guys know the Dean is
sharing is caring so I'll give one to my
boy ng a1 to me and here these are the
brand-new Easy's like first of all I
just like the fact that they're
glow-in-the-dark so if you guys didn't
know I don't know what type of like
think on us put into this that this
charges with sunlight so if you put this
in the Sun at night it starts glowing in
the dark which is super super dope and
it just feels like a cool shoe I've
never worn these before but I just like
the materials made out if you touch it
super soft you open these up it's go
like three stripes ready - there's a lot
of things that go into the shoes by the
way just for the lawsuit of my ass
that's the receipt so it is legit don't
play yourself you know it's legit but
yeah man these are the kicks
love them I think they're cool light you
can match it with like a gray outfit I
think you can even match it with like
jeans to be honest but that is it man
like a DJ Khaled said don't play
yourself you know you want to add for
now
catch you later a small little feature
we just found out guys under the strap
on one side it says easy and on the
other side it's got the adidas logo
which is pretty cool and high those are
the kicks man and now I think it's time
which which car would be suit guys so if
you had Easy's what you got in the
Ferrari the brand new Bentley or Rolls
Royce who knows there's so many cars to
choose from here guys so he came into
this room to show you the
glow-in-the-dark guys but we haven't
actually charged them at all they've
just been in the box but they still have
a little bit of a glow to them so I'm
going to close this door and see how
glow-in-the-dark is yeah and you can see
it guys look at that
it's like glows green can you see that
come on yeah I think we should give it
to us anyways I thought I'd come next to
the hurricane guys because this shoe is
actually a perfect match with this car
don't you think like this would look
amazing coming out this rock end and
you're going to put these shoes back in
the box just to keep them mint-condition
because they are like perfect right now
and yeah that was our little review of
the Yeezy 750 maybe my friend actually
gonna head out of this station right now
I thought I'd come here to show you the
Yeezys of the incredible lineup of cars
one more thing they've got like the
coolest ever
coffee machine check this out okay
each of these gives out coffee and if
you come on this side this is a cup so
you just put your cup here and get the
coffee that is ridiculously cool guys
look and the thing is this thing is
limited edition number 23 are 380 in the
world that is
- like Wow anyways let's head out guys
absolutely cool stuff over here as
always and yeah I just love the cars gt3
and one of my favorites the i8 which is
here as well I just loved ih now I've
seen so many like videos on them I just
love the way the door open try we're
heading out to go have like a milkshake
or dessert so I'll catch you guys there
so he just made it over to this like
really cool milkshake place and like if
you see the road you see all of them
cars it's all for this like place just
for the milkshakes and the waffles and
stuff they have so we ordered a block
for stick I like your milkshake and they
have it like these really cool not
telling mini jars so once it get you
I'll show you it's basically pretty cool
check this out guys so the milkshakes
just got here and this is what they are
so look at that this is the small ones
they have my man Warren went extra large
with his you know how is BAM boom and
yeah man they've got like the coolest
things like milkshake in a Nutella jar

alright last thing is they've got like
these waffle sticks as well so check
that out damn son that looks like a lot
of chocolate man anyways boys we just
made it back to the showroom I have to
show you this one last car it's like
this black Aventador but it's got like
darker black like little lines across if
you see that it's got like a really cool
design I don't know I don't know how to
explain it anyway is lost time for today
just look at the size of this thing
I think I just about reach it with my
hand yeah I'm like my same height when
my hand is lifted
hi boys so as you can see I just got
back home and I want to talk with you
guys so you guys so my friend got the
easies and I've been thinking you guys
think and I know this is ridiculous
do you think I should buy myself like a
pair of Yeezys like the same ones you
saw my friend have but the only thing
will be it would have to be for resale
price like not the three hundred and
fifty dollars it comes out four it would
be like more like I don't know a
thousand and something so and let me
know do you guys think I should pay
resale for it I just get it and start
like a collection of shoes because I've
never had like exclusive exclusive shoes
like that I have a cool shoes like the
Jordans and stuff but I don't have
anything like that
you know so let me know hit the thumbs
up button if you want me to get it like
I could buy one for resale but ah the
thing is I hate Perry so like you know
that's the only thing so let me know
maybe I'll get it who knows by the way I
fall in love with this like you know
this surfboard thing it is so fun to
play around let me go let me try and get
going bye
look at this guys I'm actually really
good at this like whoo oh my god
oh my god I gave my mom actually just
asked me to help her put this up into
the cupboard up there and you know what
this really reminds me of I'm gonna put
a clip of it right now a couple months
back we were trying to put this up there
and we didn't have a ladder and it was
so hard but hilarious at the same time
I'm gonna try and pop the clip up right
now I'm good
ah here's the shirt without your hand in
the middle of the night if you don't
push you in properly well I did okay
yeah that's but yeah this time it should
be a little bit easier that I have a
ladder just I don't have anybody to love
me so-oh-oh oh my god I did help last
time the only thing was guys that it was
extremely hard this time it's
potentially dangerous
oh my there's that thing that's bent
like can't you fix that it's already
opening oh okay we have a major problem
on our hands guys this thing just does
not fit like it just does not fit in
this cabinet like holy moly how do you
get this thing to fit especially because
under it we've got a bent wood okay yeah
that's that's even better right now you
know what I'm gonna sit back and relax
while you do that yeah it seems pretty
easy from this angle now I know what you
mean yeah really easy Lana you look like
an old lady
Oh Ricky legit seems easy like that's
the hard look at that now it's rolling
out just die
I know what she did it guys there you go
she did it but that's not my photo
because you told me yeah that's what she
told me guys she didn't tell you to put
it in here she told me to take out that
wood which I couldn't do so that is what
kind of got me stuck before I go to bed
I just want to show you where the cats
are at night guys and try and bring them
in look at that they hide under the bed
and it's just impossible to get them
because they just keep on going further
away from you look like they just walk
away and it's impossible like each time
they got a enjoy it look at look at that
come back hi and then they just end up
walking behind me out the room where did
she go oh yeah my sister got herself
like a makeup tray so because you see
guys every time I do my makeup I put my
makeup on my bed and leaves lots of
marks Hey makeup marks yeah so I thought
what I'm going to do man break up I'll
be honest guys I thought this was a bad
idea like you just looks ridiculous
having makeup in like a tray but there
you go a makeup cooking here what's up
this bed is getting dirty
so I thought I'll put it on a tray and
when I'm done so there you go guys that
is Lana's new makeup tray here there you
go oh man in today's vaakyaartha Lee you
have enjoyed stay also happy everybody
as always don't forget just be happy
keep doing you don't let anything affect
you and just chase your dreams guys
that's the main thing live chase your
dreams and be happy because those are
the two things that we all want to work
towards and you guys more y'all Yolo
