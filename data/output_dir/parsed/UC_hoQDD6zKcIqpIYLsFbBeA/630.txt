yo everyone and welcome to another vlog
so today the weather is absolutely
amazing and mommy Milan are finally
heading over to the PIO boxes since we
haven't been there for a while I would
go guys but I've got one of the worst
belly aches ever right now by the way I
would actually address something because
for the past one week there's been
hundreds of conspiracy theories about my
sister's car and if you guys haven't
already noticed there is a new plate
number
we actually never addressed on the vlog
so that's why everybody's been like
going wait that way is that Carl is that
Lana's car what's going on I need to
know so there's been comment saying this
car is not theirs anymore it's leased oh
my god is it guys how would I tell you
the comment section like it's been going
crazy on my sister's Instagram it's been
going nuts so let me explain why there's
a new number place my sister's best
friend actually gave her this as a gift
you so much I love you so much because
we're now matching they actually have
matching plates now which is absolutely
crazy like matching plates and matching
cars it is what's a matching out route
they want to be like the squad out here
so that is why the new plate number is
there guys no it's not because somehow
the car disappeared out of our ownership
and went leashed it was just a gift we
put on it which looks amazing and yeah
anyways hopefully that addressed that
because the day when I was telling you
guys that we wanted to put the plate
number on the side we were actually
swapping the plate completely but when
we went to the RTA they didn't have the
small plates because the ones you've on
the side are small plates so we just put
the normal sized one otherwise anyways
my more line are heading out to the post
office hopefully they can fit everything
in the Lamborghini if they caught it's
not my problem guys I warned them to
take my mustang but they're confident
that they can fit everything so fingers
crossed they get like 10 huge boxes and
they can't fit it in the Lamborghini
that's gonna be hilarious and yeah you
guys can join them hi you start mommy
mom so we came to
one slip so that means we've got some
happiness to collect guys alright guys

things I've ever played like it's so
like cool like you're playing with your
boat like turning a left or right and
the cars turn you have weapons that is
absolutely crazy you guys do not realize
how best up my belly is today guys I
woke up at 9 o'clock sweating like in
bed I was sweating and I couldn't do
anything I got up I was like what the
hell is wrong with you okay I quickly
came outside again because I feel like
in the morning maybe you guys got a
little bit confused just to clear up
guys
no this car is not least and the thing
is the reason I'm saying this like I'm
not something to mention stuff like this
but since I started my youtube channel
this car actually let me say something
else it's not least I saw a lot of
people say that we want it from the
competition and the thing is guys I'm
gonna pop a picture up where people are
using okay it's gonna be right here and
this picture is when my sister went to
the Lamborghini Academy after buying her
car so people are using that picture
saying that she wanted serious I'm not
something that really cares about saying
oh we own this car but it's been crazy
like unfortunately no we didn't win it
cuz if we want it you best believe I'll
block that cuz that'd be crazy imagine
winning a Lamborghini girl anyways I
want you guys to guess something guess
what because I did mention my sister
might be changing the color again guess
what color is gonna change dude don't
tell them actually if you know my sister
you might know the color okay that's all
I'm gonna say I want your guesses down
below you guys better go get me some
medicine quick cuz this belly is not
healing oh I need to go to the toilet
guys so we're just heading out to get my
brother some medication he's not
feeling well today we got my brothers
from digi I think sparkling water and
hopefully that should help his stomach
don't you need somebody so when my
sister mom won out I thought they were
coming back with some pills some you
know medicine this is my medicine guys
mommy said it's good no Josh it takes
bloody delicious to me Jay stop Brighton
I hope you get better I hope I do I
really hope I do
oh my goodness I was just watching a
video on YouTube right now which I
bizarrely found really interesting it
was like 25 places you can light your
match stick up except from you know the
normal way you die up so I thought I'd
give it a shot with different I am so
first things first I'm pretty sure my
skateboard should be able to turn on a
match right here goes nothing guys oh oh
it broke ground two boys what the hell
it doesn't light up what No it ruined my
skateboard
mommy no why did I think this is a good
idea oh my god
okay I kind of got it off guys don't
worry I think if you just keep rubbing
it it will come off after a while so
we're not trying you on anything like
this again I don't normally use my car
like in four-wheel drive car guys but
there was no parking and I have to go up
here to park it in the sand so check it
out hi boys I finally found myself a
normal pakya matchstick so the thing is
these are waterproof
what is the waterproof match I don't
know but if I if I lie on fire forward
is it does it stay on like what is a
waterproof bag
I'm in the fish section and the ice is
just so cool oh oh wait no my hands
gonna stink of fish now no Brad round
two boys
we are back in action this time we have
some proper matches let's see if we can
light out this time on this skateboard a
gay cheer goes nothing
what does how are these videos so fake I
want to do a really cool trick with this
you can lie it up while flicking it and
it looks amazing let's give it a shot so
what you're gonna want to do for this
trick is hold the match just like so and
flick it and it should catch fire while
it's going okay let's see how this goes
Oh oh good I told you I told you
attorney Wu as always you guys are going
to wrap up today's lucky I hope you have
enjoyed it I was super sick throughout
the day so hopefully by tomorrow my
immune system can kind of soar out
