Hey what up everyone yo yo yo how is it
going
I said I've recently been thinking about
changing my intro let me know you guys
want me to stick to the yo yo everyone
or should I change it up I'm not even
sure hello what's up how are you anyways
I'm actually start today by doing some
trick which I saw online I'm not sure if
it's even safe okay I'm not sure if this
is even safe so what we need is this
plasma bull which I bought the other day
and you can use it to light a fire okay
so what you're gonna want to need guys
is a needle as you can see here is our
needle and you're going to want to take
aluminum foil just like this and cover
your bowl with it please don't try this
but if you do make sure the sphere is
off when you're putting that iminium
foil on or else it could go horribly
wrong
here goes nothing let's test this out
guys so you gonna want to take some oil
and you're just going to want to cover
your hole like this I'm doing so good
okay it's on it's on you see that hey
watch this watch this guy's
so it should start catching fire Hey
oh-oh-oh electrocution see I told you oh
man attention okay okay so I don't know
what I did wrong guys but I actually
burnt the tip of my thumb I'm gonna show
you a video now if like five seconds of
what's supposed to happen so check it
out
and it's just supposed to be a really
basic trick where you just like catch
fire to the paper but I don't know what
I did wrong like it literally
electrocuted the tip of my thumb so I
actually want to show you guys something
that my sister did to her card she
actually had a little upgrade I'd say
upgrade I don't know what else to call
it installed to her car so yesterday she
took it to the lambo service center and
this thing that she had added to the car
is actually something I think that
Lamborghini just introduced because I've
never seen it before so in order to show
it you guys I actually need to move the
car forward so that gives us a little
reason to turn it on and move the car
let's do this oh my god y'all this car
is so deadly to the legs look look at
this
I can barely fit Oh anyways let's start
up the Beast you guys should already
know how to do this you just flip this
red switch over here and you press the
star button yeah there you go pretty
loud stop I'm going to bring down the
windows
see how much louder is
okay whoo
all right so it's time to show you the
new feature guys let me let me come
outside all right that car is super hard
to get in and out guys but the new
feature is she actually had Lamborghini
lights and you're probably like what the
hell is a Lambo light she had these like
lights installed on her doors and you
can see them better at night so I'm not
sure how well you guys can see that the
moment check it out there's a lights on
the side of her door which light up when
you open the door let's go around and
show you the other side as well
ah there you go this this one's nice
guys hey so there you go that is what
she's done to the car let me know you
guys like it
oh yeah mommy let me cover it actually
yeah let's put mommy's dress on it oh
look at that guys whoa that is so cool
anyways let's move this car back into
the parking space guys oh my god I just
realized I don't think it was the best
idea turning it off but let's turn it on
again
it's actually considered be quieter
after the first time you turn on my gosh
oh I have to hug my mum right now
because otherwise she would kill me but
right now actually heading out to go
look at some more bikes now lost she's
at work heading out really okay we are
but lastly if you guys remember me and
my sister were showing you one of our
friends super bikes and I said that we
really want to get one now all of you
pretty much all if you're like yes-mo
just do it just do it so mummy mum has
agreed to come to come look it's a lot
of bikes for now for now here we go I
want to just get a feel for like how
much they are obviously I'm not gonna
get because I saw your car - I know
that's a 1000 horsepower
CC bike you kill yourself with it okay
guys I'm not gonna go get something that
powerful but I want to look at a very
decent sports version anyways let's head
out let's see what there is and yeah
hopefully we can maybe change our minds
about the situation hopefully yeah like
toys you buy me more my truth the first
stop today is at Yamaha I should here a
couple months back look they were like
some cool dunes and stuff all right
let's go inside the showroom and check
everything out oh my god
we're just looking at that's all we're
doing here today guys whoo look at this
right to be honest I don't really like
this but still a bike
alright guys so check it out I'm just
taking a look at some bikes they have
over here this is the type of stuff I
love man just take a look at this bike
oh it looks so so cool it's called the
r6 and it's got 600 horsepower just
having a look around with the person
you're telling us everything about the
bikes so this is 600 CC and the thing is
apparently for beginners it can be a
little too much
I just like how it looks like the other
ones that have lower CC look different
I'm going to show you a couple others so
that's the 600 CC one guys there's
another one over here which is 900 this
one also looks really really me Mike
just take a look at this beast and these
are the ones I like like these are the
ones I really really like but the ones
that have less power the ones that are
safer are just like the ones we walked
into so something like this I just I
don't like it I don't like these ones I
really want the super smart ones he said
you can actually buy it without having
your life so it's just park it in front
of your house and then whenever you
finish your license start driving it but
I don't know I'm not sure right now
we're just sitting around looking
there's some awesome quad bikes like
check this out this is one we actually
took a look at a couple months back on
the vlog when I was looking for a car
like we ran into this and this looks
like a beast as well or I can just go
for something tiny like a little tiny
bite the bigger this imagine having I
think this would be the safest option
for me the guy here working here is
super dope he was actually telling me
they might invite me because they have
like days where you can test out the
yachts they sell like these speed yachts
which are over here and it was like are
you are you down to come one day and
just test out the speed yah I was like
oh yeah
well I'm not so yeah we just say you can
look around here to see some stuff
anyways guys let's head out they're
actually closing right now I never knew
about it but so you could buy to the
bike so a couple awesome things in here
not that y'all so check it out guys I
just made it to the Jordan store as you
can see
and you know the shoes all setting I was
coming to get like the blue or white
ones and yesterday they told me about
them I was like maybe I'll come by and
buy them so I came here to look at them
I wasn't even sure if I was gonna get
them they're already sold out like they
were actually really exclusive I didn't
even know like I thought they're a
normal pair coming out both said they
had a red and white one coming out and a
blue and white one and they both sold
out but what they do have is do you guys
know football they've got the limited
edition Neymar's now I would buy them
but honestly I don't play football and
they're kind of expensive like I would
just stop them but I don't know they're
like 1,500 Durham's and the normal pair
of Jordans I buy which I actually wear
like 1,000 so yes so I'm trying to teach
you guys Daniel and Amir and Daniel
Asian face football and he got the name
art so check it out hey yo these are so
nice by the way I would get them but you
know I just can't play football man I
can't play football anyways thank you so
much awesome meeting your man and those
are some nice kicks peace so he just
came to the other shoe section over here
I look at this they've got Mario shoes
Hey look wait can you play this with
your feet no it doesn't work I thought
it might actually work
you back at it again with the white
bands these are like gaming vans right
here that looks so cool what that is so
good mommy more has come to get her
glosses guys so basically what happened
is her loss has got scratched up even
though there were like scratch
resistance so we came here to like say
why but we didn't know apparently if you
leave your glosses in the heat the empty
stretch melts off so she's gonna have
another eye test right now there's where
she got it you know I'm coming with her
they're gonna have another eye test and
then get a new lens for a mummy more
about to have her eye test one all right
guys so we just finished off my mom's
little eye testing the head out of here
gonna go pick her frame and we can head
out mommy mode chose those bosses for
now are still looking around for what
you guys think they look nice but I
actually found these whoa these look so
cool they're like literally circles on
your eyes okay now I definitely found
the pair of glasses that make me look
cool guys
whoa look at that I look like a fish I
know this might sound childish Opie but
they were like a huge little gaming
section down here and this is massive
guys I look I'm on the first floor and
this thing almost gets here the floors
here are like big floors like five
meters guys and look at the size of that
thing
oh my god it actually reminds me if you
guys have seen that Roman Atwood like
experiment hey what's up man
no I know kind of like hey what's up
Alex dope right what we opened you know
oh really yeah I missed it guy that is
awesome see you on so we're back from my
mom's losses right now I guess so we're
just going to collect them and go you're
gonna have your glasses back you want to
see how it is
oh wow that's a really nice box that's
fancy
there you go check them out check them
out guys
let me see oh I look bad they look bad
oh my god they look so nerdy okay so we
just came into this store and I think I
found one of the coolest things ever so
they have a bunch of skateboards as you
can see and like everything to make them
but what is this guys oh my god
this is tiny like seriously guys look at
the size of this we prepared for normal
skateboard
like all of the normal skateboard right
now what and the thing is it so nicely
built like it's really solid guys right
now I want to go have some dessert so
I'm gonna have a quick no ice cream over
here and what should I have dad I got
mango I love mango oh my god oh my god
all right we're about to go home now
guys I sure I feel like God is signaling
me to get more bike look to sports bike
as soon as we leave and there's never
two sports bikes over here guys like and
they're beautiful oh oh look at that
guys that is one of the most beautiful
bikes I've ever seen God and it's next
to another sports bike like even this
one look how beautiful this thing is Wow
okay you know what guys I know I might
be sounding stubborn but I'm getting one
like no way after I see stuff like this
you just thought not get one like I have
to get one look gooey up next to us guys
purple lime
Oh
so we just stopped by the petrol station
I just filled my car with some gas but
now
Lana's filling up yeah it's done 110 all
right thank you I'm gonna go pay for
guys so yeah we're gonna head out here
now go home
mine only cost 80 hers was 110 guys so
you can see the difference just to tell
you guys back in like us that's like 30
dollars to fill up the Lamborghini which
is not much to be honest I think it must
be way more in the u.s. probably like a
hundred dollars did you hear that that
was my sister's car look at my sister
she is literally parked next to me and
if she presses the acceleration my ear
will pop like look how close their cars
to mine guys literally next to her
exhaust is in my window it's crazy like
that's a big risk I'm taking okay let me
let me bring out the window because I
don't want to death in my ears as soon
as she gets a take off going but yeah
since it is night now I thought it'd be
the perfect time to show you my sister's
door wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
I want to show you on the dark side
because the lights do turn on so open
your door I want to show them what it
looks like so check this out guys
that looks so dope that is the upgraded
car guys there you go I'm not sure if
this the best place to wrap up my vlog
because my room is literally the
messiest place on this planet guys but I
was just reading this fan know that you
guys gave me like two months ago and I
don't know you just clicked with me
today says life isn't about waiting for
the storm to pass it's about learning to
dance in the rain and that is so true
guys you know I I had it sitting in my
room and I never really paid attention
to it but you know the days where you
just I felt like this today like what
this quote says I felt like I woke up I
wasn't feeling the best and throughout
the dance I you know what just just slap
out of it mo why are you feeling
stressed out about what like the small
things in life the thing is everything
we stress about is probably temporary
it's gonna like be forgotten about in a
month so it's just it's nice to know
that people have similar quotes and
thinking processes like us but yeah guys
I actually want to say one thing I
started using Twitter more often I just
I don't know I'm not really a Twitter
person because I never have anything to
say
but recently I've just been tweeting out
what's on my brain so if you guys care
about that follow my Twitter
moe underscore vlogs on your score no
it's not like some other stuff I've seen
people with like names like official
more vlogs and more vlogs official no no
they're all fake accounts guys and they
don't even say their Fanny counts like
they're just like no I'm all blows guys
yep official mole blogs I'm like goddamn
and it is sad because I think one of
them even has more followers than me but
it's right at least they do tweet nice
stuff anyways that's besides the point
you guys could if you could go and tweet
one of my blogs that you guys enjoy like
I've really enjoyed the $30,000 sweet
tour you guys could tweet out what you
guys enjoyed and I'm gonna try and
follow you guys back and if you guys
could follow me on Twitter as well that
would help out you know your boys kind
of slacking I've got 12,000 followers
which is good don't you every room
because I don't even tweet much but
let's try and boost the numbers on that
anyways they also love you I'll see you
guys tomorrow for another epic adventure
