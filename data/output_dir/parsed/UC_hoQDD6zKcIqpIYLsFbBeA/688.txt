Friday listing vlog today's vlog is
gonna be so so hectic we've got so many
things to do we're gonna start off with
a lambo event and then there's a huge
drift event going on and how would that
be so today's gonna be jam-packed you're
not gonna miss out on anything cause
we're going to both so let's get on our
way with the new whip whoo that is such
a sexy view with them black rims
okay not a good idea to do a drive-by
shot when you're already late for an
event right I feel like my sister thinks
this car's Fosters you don't put your
foot down
whoa what a view so we just got here
over to our destination area but you
might be wondering where it is first of
all so we came here to the new
Lamborghini service center and they've
got the most ridiculous lineup of cars
over here look behind my sister
Aventador Aventador murciélago hawkins
this place is just filled with cars for
you classic car lovers as all the
Lamborghini I think this is the old one
I can't remember the name Diablo I think
I'm not too sure but there's so many
cars over here I'm just gonna run down
like when are you going to see this many
Lamborghinis parked outside that's ours
over there but the colors here are
gorgeous so many limited edition ones as
well just like this SV and I'm not even
going to bother walking down it's just
filled filled with Lamborghinis anyways
we're going to head inside now show you
inside the place because I've actually
never seen it and then I think we're
going on a drive this is the showroom
floor for everyone that wants to see the
lineup of cars they pretty much have
everything on the start with the
Moroccan Spyder
cuz these are pretty rare and I never
see them I actually really really like
the interior on this the brown and
they've got so many other cars over here
we've got the new hurricane as well but
awesome stuff I think you guys want to
see the ride so I'll catch you then
they've even got a drone here today yeah
what's up
that is also Wow
I can't move out the way move out oh hey
the cars are getting started up if you
can hear them trust it's gonna get
gonna get very loud
everything is dang rep right now
this is lavender yep over 2030
Lamborghini
area I know it's extremely loud
amazing
you know in those pictures on Instagram
of like 2030 Lamborghinis I think this
is where they get them from look at the
lineup wow this is insane
the tribe has begun everybody
Wow
everybody has started this ride
okay we're now in a bigger road so you
can see the cars a bit bad let's go
let's go
oh boy oh boy
Wow place their damn
huh
Wow
guys that was insane
I just had my ear bump right there
this area has completely been
Lamborghini bide right now
lotta over there lost mursalata if I'm
not mistaken I think this is actually
the most Lamborghinis I've had an event
at once I might be mistaken I'm not sure
but awesome awesome turnout we had a
good variety this time we had I think
Aventador Baraka Gallardo the new
hurricane Diablo for Salah go like
everything you could think of we had at
this event so if you see behind me
they're trying to park up all the cars
in this air
in front of the hotel doing a pretty
good job at the moment there's like I
think 10 or 11 parked up we have a
really really nice lineup we have the
Aventadors in a row all over here if you
can see that 1 2 3 and then another 3
over there and there's loads more cars
coming in so all of the cars have now
been parked up over at this hotel and
look behind my sister how many cars are
here like you don't have a shortage of
Lambos like there's so many we're just
about trying to squeeze them all in this
small area and this is really really
amazing
everybody's waves that last one to fit
into the puzzle look the morsel logger
is coming in wow wow wow yeah we have
everything so we just got over here at
the hotel and this is my sister's best
friend that you guys have never seen
this yes so we're just entering now do
you guys like she was very similar you
what like a same star right now but I
had to show you guys this hotel cause it
looks so so beautiful right now they're
walking along and yeah there is the
person you've never seen my sisters
that's my best friend that's my best
friend this is actually my first time
over at this hotel but look at the view
they have like we just came down and the
swimming pool here looks really really
fantastic like you know when you just
look at a swimming pool and you want to
just dive in because it's like it's
actually pretty hot as well right now so
my lips are dry and I really need some
more but except from that I think they
have a golf course over there with the
whole view I think this place so who
talked North Shore it's like a hotel or
like a Resort and Spa regardless it
looks really really nice and that's like
the Golf Course over there like the
lakes and the ponds but yeah anyways we
are now done over here at the dinner we
just were eating right now and we're
going to head over to our that me now
for the event so yeah that's good we
just came out but all the cars are still
here and it looks fantastic right now
Wow
this is what you go garage goes
everybody like this is the definition of
garage goes right here
some of the cars have been switched on
behind me and they're starting to leave
there's actually a couple of people from
the Lambo glove going to the aspirator
band with us so that should be fun
yeah the driving part was amazing okay
time to head out now everybody this is
such a nice shot behind you you got the
murciélago at the door up the vent door
with the Dora and yeah our car we were

starting line it's starting now great

let's go oh okay we are now in the pit
area the cars we're getting ready behind
us it's not a lot look to be honest
which it's from the drifting I think
okay so I just saw our guys the main
event is starting awesome crazy little
drifting over that the beginning I think
they're coming back so here goes nothing
Wow
there is so much smoke behind me because
on a boulder drifting is it say
by the way guys I just left you at the
girls one here at the bed and they gave
me check money to add to the Galatian
thank you guys so much as Mark I wish
I'd been more just chilling here
Friday
okay round two cars are coming guys
yeah there's a Mustang
just so you know what's in the engine of
one of these things that's what it is
crazy stuff that I have no idea about
Lana who are your bets on
my bets on the red car red car red car
thank you
I've just been paying a bit closer
attention to these cars behind me this
and this one and if you look like
everything on here is like carbon fiber
carbon fiber on the inside it's like all
like either stripped or carbon fiber
like it is such a lightweight car right
here but this is an absolute beast like
both of them are absolute beast like
they look very very similar in the way
they're like engines are like the whole
thing on the engine you see that full
carbon fiber but Wow they've been doing
some mega triptych today like I'm sorry
to learn about all the rules and stuff
apparently you want to be close but
they're not allowed to overtake and
stuff like that so yeah and I'm probably
making no sense all the best when I got
the drift things but I'm learning guys
I can't even see them I don't know I'm
bringing outside because there is some
amazing cars over here which I want to
show you which are over there we've got
