Valentine's Day
we got a Rolls Royce good morning
everyone welcome back to another video
how are you all doing if we are starting
out the day in the garage oh my god
hi guys very much the first thing we're
doing today is we're taking my mum's car
and we're actually going to go and give
it in for some detailing so now what are
you doing you're doing the opposite of
detailing your monster get off the damn
car you are legit destroying the car bro
it cannot handle your weight like I
swear the car cannot handle your weight
right now this is why you don't bring a
rolls-royce into our family
she only did that cuz her car she
wouldn't let me down that car looks nice
skirt skirt yo hi guys so right now we
just made it over here to hotel misty
car care they're actually gonna do the
home paint protection on the car and
everything but you're not about to
believe what I'm gonna show you right so
I'm gonna take you guys inside and it's
very private
look at his face you're gonna see the
craziest cars every night welcome to the
dungeon
oh my god
eisah I think it see right now we are
inside guys and my mum's are all strace
is about to be detailed over here but
they have a bugatti chiron out here can
you see this yeah this is a three and a
half million dollar car bro
so basically this is where they do all
of the detailing in the PPF to the cars
and you can probably tell this is one of
the best places yeah it's it's Vichy
everything about this car is carbon
fiber look at it close you see a carbon
fiber Wow now you know we've given the
car to the best place to get detailed
behind here this is actually where they
work on the car so they have their own
stations for each car and if you can see
inside here there's also a McLaren 720
light it looks like it does now here's
the thing they even have like classic
Mercedes over here that looked crazy
guys so check it out if you guys look
over here whoa they're actually working
on it right now
wax on wax off Wow mr. Miyagi wax on wax

open up one of the stations so you guys
can see inside it check it out
oh my god this thing looks so much nicer
in there we are about to enter another
one of the hospital rooms right it looks
so cool it's like they're repairing all
the guards they're just detailing now so
right now I'm actually gonna go up close
and personal I don't really know what
this procedure is called but it's just
so satisfying to look at okay now this
is what you call a classic car over here
Stan I told you guys there's two classic
cars one over here and another one over
there guys look at the engine on this
thing what yeah that is madness guys I
didn't even know they had this
technology right then what year is this
do you know 60 years old Wow do you know
how wishes are
I guess it's a la I don't know why I
just feel like they're expensive I feel
like it's as much as the Bugatti somehow
somehow its automatic it came out
automatic so here's what I really like
about this place apart from all of those
really cool rooms they have they
actually have like their own photo shoot
studio guys check this out

a car in the photo shoot area and they
have like the biggest lighting ever like
