take a flight here on my own and the
view is amazing

sister guys and right now I'm flying
back to London I don't know what I'm
doing with my life guys I mean it's

snow yep that's my life a few moments
later alright guys so right now I just

coolest purchases I've ever made in my
life Stretch Armstrong alright so if you

it is unreviewable like whatever you do
it's not supposed to rip so today you
wanna bet

Trump when he was younger Donald Trump
oh he's like a piece of meat so
apparently this guy is not supposed to
rip we're gonna test him out gonna fit
you in the frame three two one
it's gonna smack you in the face what
the hell is this thing but it's
definitely not a man it's a bit too flat
bro you gonna need some button plants
for that
okay so right now me and my sister are
gonna do our best to rip this guy
realize the level of torture this guy's
been through we just destroyed his whole
body so now it's time for Plan B okay
this guy does not rip as much as you
pull him
so we're gonna put him inside a bucket
of ice I named him Donnie we're not sure
I still want to go to America stuff no

starving so we're gonna go have a nice
little pizza oh wait what are you doing
bro put it down put my visa - really mom
so basically
this is what you who obesity yo are boys
so we are back at the hotel right now
first things first I actually got a
little gift which I wanna unbox on the
blog a kid gave me a golden fidgets
spinner right whoa one of the kids
downstairs actually gave me this as a
gift it is a golden fidget spinner
I don't Frida spinners are not in trend
anymore modesty I still feel like
they're so satisfying like just whoa
anyways that is besides the point
because right now we actually have
something to talk about so let's go
alright so here's what I want to talk
about before I end today's video so
three days ago there was actually an
article that was written about me on
Qatar DICOM which is like a Qatar news
outlet or something along those lines
and basically it says 20 reasons why
everybody needs to follow more vlogs and
it's actually a pretty interesting guy
oh yeah oh yeah
so they actually said 2.5 million dollar
Lamborghini guys this isn't even a
Lamborghini this is the devil 16 it's
like wow that's besides the point guys
so first things first it just goes on to
talk about me in general guys but what I
love on page number 5 check this out one
of the reasons to follow me he is rich I
don't even know what to say about this
it's just such like a funny point
they've made but I guess it's kind of
true like I know a lot of people do
follow me for the supercars I show and
like the lifestyle and crazy stuff like
that
but it's just funny when it's put into
an article that way guys anyways if you
haven't checked out the article I'm
gonna leave the link in the description
and if you're any other news places out
there yeah just just let me know when
you write some things like a reactor you
know what while we're on the topic of
money I'm actually gonna Google my net
worth right now so let's see what it is
guys here goes nothing Moe vlogs net
worth alright boom to be around to you
can see the estimate my net worth on
Google is two million dollars I'm not
laughing because that's a bad estimate
or anything
the reason I'm laughing guys three years
ago when I started YouTube my net worth
on Google was three to ten million
dollars or I like between three and ten
million dollars and it's kind of funny
how three years later I'm two billion
dollars guys I honestly I don't know how
to find all of these net worths super
super funny like I feel like it just
depends on how the people feel when
they're writing the articles so yeah
guys apparently in three years of me
being on YouTube my net worth went down
eight million dollars God Daniel
Waterside guys what I do want to say is
one question that I always do get asked
is how much money I actually make on
YouTube and I feel like every youtuber
can relate with me on this one
honestly as much as I'd like to give you
like a set finger guys it honestly
depends so much like on YouTube there's
like this weird system I'm trying to
explain as good as I can
it just depends how much advertisers are
paying at that time not to avoid the
question or anything but if you guys
ever want to see how much a youtuber is
kind of making like roughly you can
actually check it yourself guys if you
go websites like social blade this is my
social blade BAM so this is my estimated
yearly earning right and I know I know
it's like a big difference like between
a hundred
thousand twelve million but you can
normally go in the middle and kind of
figure it out if you know what I'm
trying to say and I know now that I
showed you that a lot of people are
gonna be commenting crazy things but
what I do want to say guys honestly I've
said this a hundred times before my
blogs and I've said this before I was
even getting views on YouTube the reason
I started YouTube is honestly just
because I love it so much guys and
besides the money factor of things that
how much youtubers make I just really
enjoyed you asked me why I make youtube
videos and the reason is I enjoy making
the videos there's a lot of things I
could do to make more money than YouTube
but I think should always do something
you enjoy and a better day if you make
money even if it's less than doing
something else if it's something you
enjoy you're just gonna continue doing
and have fun with it in life if you want
to go forward it's something you have to
enjoy it like you can't just think about
the money or how much you want to make
like it's just that kind of just comes
with the passion if you know what I'm
trying to say guys I love you guys so so
much make sure to smash the like button
