yeah what is not welcome to another vlog
so today the man Casey Neistat himself
is in Dubai
so I heard he's in Dubai I'm gonna try
my best to see him I'm not sure guys
he's busy as hell but to celebrate we're
gonna go do some skateboarding
just like him let's do this guy's
whoo I guess I'm high on those drums
anyways regardless today is gonna be an
amazing day let's go have some fun whoo
by the way don't judge my flip-flops I'm
wearing the worst flip-flops you can
ever imagine look at these whoo yeah
this is the time to say what honestly if
you guys don't know Casey is the man
like so much ha ha ha hi as I was saying
before I got tripped up on that speed
bump I've learned so much editing just
watching his videos so that's why I was
so excited to know that he's in Dubai
whoa oh no no so for now guys we're
gonna go inside change my shirts I'm a
little bit sweaty and then let's head
out to have an amazing day let's do this
by the way I want to say the best thing
about Electric skateboards is when
they're far away from you
you don't even need to walk like they
literally just come to you that's
awesome
whoa our voice Oh Ike really changed my
shirt and time to head out with this
beast gonna go drop it off but I do have
to say I had a lot of fun with it
anyways let's go for one last ride in
this monster okay I know you guys love
this car and so do i oh I just want to
see the interior on a Ferrari when it's
black actually looks really nice one
last time Ferrari one last time keys go
in turn press the start button
okay okay we're uh I'm sorry I'm sorry
I'm in my area I shouldn't be doing that
anyways let's go have some fun today
guys just make sure guys every day
should be a good day by the way the
reason the Ferrari is so loud every
single time I Drive it guys is because
if you didn't know I'm sure most of you
do but so if you see on the steering
room guys it says sports race mode and I
always switch it to race mode which
makes it extremely loud so yeah this is
where the key to success is
listen to the noise it makes
I'm gonna miss this I'm gonna miss this
guys honestly when you're in this car
you feel so tempted just to push it guys
because you hear this
oh my god I'm on caught even hold the
camera is that boss anyways guys mommy
bows with me check it out check it out
she's in the car
you see I need supervision they won't
let me drive this alone somebody has to
be with you
alright so we just made it over here
guys the car is going for now absolute
viewing it that's like the young brother
and this is the big brother guys this is
the four a8 with like a really cool
design they've done to it so yeah

crazy just sits next to the cars I guess
he's a car lover yo ho ho ho guess so I
just found out guys Casey nice that is
filming with one of our friends cars
like literally an event the door so that
means he should be coming back here okay
I'm gonna head back I told them to cool
me as soon as he gets here they could
actually be a possibility of me meeting
him anyways that is crazy just to know
that he is using one of these cars I was
here I'm not sure if you see there's a
blue Aventador there but he's using the
white one they have anyways let's go out
I want to go to the mall and do some
stuff and then we should be back

she
foray into fix but while she does that
I'm going to look around at some glasses
