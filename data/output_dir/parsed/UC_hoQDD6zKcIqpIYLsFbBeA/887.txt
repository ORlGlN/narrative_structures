good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog I'm currently looking like this
because we're having our a/c repaired
and you can see your arms over here over
there and they have to put all the a/c
on 18 which is freezing cold so I'm
saying here with the hoodie I promise
you I'm still so cold it's ridiculous
but it's just because they need every
single one to be on the same temperature
which is had to be 18 like the lowest
temperature but yeah it should be done
soon
this is I know it's cold guys look at
bubbles and key they're sitting next to
the window where there's Sun talking to
their friend Tobi outside or wait you
guys to be honest I haven't really
checked the names you guys have left
them yet so that's why I don't know okay
I live way to religious let's take this
off much better our house is literally
getting opened up
you got some stairs there you got
something open there the ceilings open
there and yeah I'm back to my normal
position I give up and it's the ACS are
turned off so I can take this little
hoodie off because it's not cold anymore
yesterday I think I mentioned that we
were having sprinklers put into the
garden now look what they've done to it
oh my god look I saw a garden and okay
I'm not sure if you heard that that is
the sound of all the towers getting
smashed open because of the irrigation
system pretty much like sprinklers water
sprinklers they're opening up the floor
here again I swear the wall feels like
it's cracking and listen listen yeah
yeah anyways they're like digging open
the ground it's super loud my sister
just beast and I'm just here like please
don't fall on me I swear like it sounds
like the wall is looking here this way
let's go well okay so no need to worry
it's the stone thing the water's still
actually the rule making that crackling
I just figured out I'm a genius today's
dessert is cookies with Nuttall on that
my mom made me these she's super awesome
eyes she just brings me snacks while I'm
like editing my videos and I got tea so
it's gonna be sitting here editing and
having these homemade biscuit dessert
type of things but that's quickly got
stairs so I can show you kitty and
bubbles so this is what Kitty and Bob
was doing my sister's room my sister
puts TV for them although key is not
watching bowls is that it's like some
really simple cartoon bubbling kit you
see okay no okay go away go he's gonna
come a likely chon to me now
and they actually watch cartoons in a
room okay so my brother thought I'll
show you what Kitty does she comes to my
room goes onto my makeup table finds
this and takes out all this ear buds and
throws it on the floor because she likes
playing with that look so Kitty has
always liked watching TV um
there you can see her she's focused on
the TV up there don't here's a look at
the addition lid I don't know why yeah
what the hell oh good it's good uh-oh
what the hell was that for bubbles oh I
don't know why he does oh oh oh God
they always do though I minute they're
nice one minute they're not balls is
what you know vlogging oh oh oh oh all
right take your laptop off my lap don't
forget oh I take my laptop take don't
let me take you okay did your name fight
yeah I thought you'd be gonna stop you
told him to fight
oh you got beat by a girl you got beat
which guy said she's watching TV you
know yeah how do you just go from a
fight to watching TV again I don't
understand kitty you're literally
watching an orange stream this is the
baby TV channel yeah but why is she
looking at a screen it's made for babies
all they do is they do color pattern
changes on the screen that's it that
dead is it I'm guessing you've got the
mentality of a babysitter's she's
looking okay now she gave up with a
masseuse oh she just had to sleep on
watch ah
Wow oh my god oh my god yeah it's a
lumen are you no kids
what oh my god I'm getting sucked into
the Lumina life scary no like a horror
movie for kids we're going out and I
decided to bring out my new shoes that I
got like the other day so let's see them
fresh out the box
I actually really like I watched videos
where people do like shoe unboxing it's
not these shoes obviously like Jordans I
don't know you guys enjoy stuff
plasticky sound but yeah I'm gonna wear
these and today the 29th of September
the reason I'm saying their days because
I don't know when this video is gonna
come out David Beckham was in divine
Mall of the Emirates and yeah that's
kind of crazy let me show you some
pictures on Twitter I'm not sure I might
go out to try and see if he's still in
the mall because he did like an ID gasps
door opening but for now I just show you
some pictures on Twitter there you go
there is David Beckham in Dubai I might
try and head out just to see this little
wall he won't be there probably and
anyways even if I did go today look how
busy it was the type of crowd that there
was for him obviously he's a huge star
so there's gonna be loads of people but
for now let's put on my new shoes and go
out
I'm legit starving so I quickly had to
have one of my ice lollies or pour you
out like I don't know what it is I
suddenly got like a new belly starved
thing going on so yeah so we're
currently in the food school I did say
as soon as you get here the first thing
we're doing is eating it's actually got
a pretty clean sound see that very nice
I'm here my momma
and after this we're going to go see
David Beckham or were hoping anyways
even though 100% I know he's not there I
saw on Twitter he was there like two
hours ago so there's no way he's safe
till now or keeping our hope side maybe
we have a chance cause our fingers
slightly this walks by off-mike
yeah I'm going to eat now go get my food
and the head ok time to head off we go
ourselves to do ice creams for our
journey let's go find where David
Beckham is at
ok so we're like four hours late but
apparently he was standing right there
and I missed him he came at 5:30 it's
currently 9 but that is such a bummer I
came in it because I saw on the internet
because where he would stand it was like
a little worn but panting they just put
up something Fermi came and signed a
couple of things so he missed
unfortunately and yep no David Beckham
but he wasn't due by if I do have a
couple of clips of him I'll try and see
if I can find any on internet I'll just
put it now so hope you enjoy
alright well that is a goodbye to that
in a store for now
I was literally washing videos and when
David Beckham was here this whole area

checking like what time David Beckham
