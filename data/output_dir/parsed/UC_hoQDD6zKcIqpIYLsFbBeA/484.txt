guys shout out to these guys videos so
because of national day they have some
shows going on right now so check it out
guys look at that
I came into the food section of this
store and I actually found something
interesting which I'm gonna try out
maybe tomorrow apparently this is like
some sort of cup you put the cup alone
okay nothing inside the cup in the
freezer for like six hours and then when
you take it out you can pour juice into
it and within one minute it freezes it
like makes it into a slushy so I'm gonna
test this out and there's one more cool
thing they have over here it's actually
so fascinating basically let me show you
guys it's this a knife and this is not
like an electric knife or anything it's
just a normal knife but when you hold it
your heat off your hand goes to the edge
of the knife and it cuts through frozen
things easily Solar they've even got
like an ice cube over here you can test
it out on so that with this knife you
see that guys he goes straight through
it like what the hell let's try and cut
it in half what guys this is an ice cube
it shouldn't be doing this
alright I'm done I'm done this is like
futuristic technology right here farm
boy cycle you made a home and look who's
here
me and mommy were are gonna go out and
buy some ingredients right now what
we're about to do was actually her idea
she was watching like a YouTube video
just I'm oh let's try this out so
basically we're gonna try and make a
Pepsi or coca-cola bottle out of
chocolate but not normal chocolate white
chocolate so I've seen normal chocolate
been done before but I want to try out
with white chocolates I think you look
super cool so let's go get the
ingredients and come back look at how
much luck I have okay I told you I want
to use white chocolate for this
challenge and look what they have on
sale white galaxy ahh
alright you know what today today is an
amazing day guys I'm gonna get this and
I also need one more thing I need like
Smarties or M&M so let's go find them so
we're just checking out right now and
apparently they have like a random draw
going on now so if the receipt says we
win we're gonna win all of this stuff
guys and it's worth like 500 so let's
see did it
this receipt yes did we win
did we win nah
alright guys another remove let's get
straight into making this chocolate
cocoa
the thing is it's my first time too so I
got two just in case I mess up so you
guys want to try this out follow my
steps exactly okay so this is our white
chocolate we need to melt this we got
some Smarties and some coke first things
first guys we don't need the coke in the
bowl so go ahead and pour it out don't
waste it don't put it inside oh no like
a warm ball or something so whoa look at
this guys you see that this is cool
conserving that is what coke looks
inside a wormhole so now we're going to
do the cool part guys so we're going to
keep this to the side for later on but
now we get to melting the white
chocolate so go ahead just tear open
your white chocolate guys ah what you
want to do is just go ahead and open
your chocolate guys and just break it up
into pieces you see just bold Oh see
this way actually Mel it's easier topler
more chocolate in case you guys have
never blow chocolate before don't do
what I used to do you have to put water
in your pan otherwise you're gonna burn
the chocolate so as you can see guys
we've got water inside that pan and you
just put this on top okay see you guys
don't burn yourself don't burn
yourselves oh look at that guys oh my
god oh my god
look at the chocolate juiciness
so now that you've melted your white
chocolate guys before you pour into your
coke bowl you need to do one thing okay
you want to take this label off without
damaging it so this is actually gonna go
around the chocolate and oh hi there
here it goes
oh wow oh my it looks like we're pouring
milk into the coke bottle guys but
that's actually all gonna dry up into
chocolate so now that all of your molten
chocolate is in the coke bottle this is
what you need to do guys so you actually
want this to dry around the bottle so
all you're gonna do is you're gonna keep
on turning it like this okay so it
covers the whole bowl all right once it
actually room we're gonna put the lid on
so it doesn't spill on me this is
actually boiling right now as you can
see back and forth back and forth that
is insane so you're gonna slowly spin it
let it dry and then spin it again and
let it dry and hopefully by the end of
it you're gonna have a coke bowl that
looks like this with chocolate okay it's
really good ten minutes where you've
been spinning the ball I'm not sure if
you guys can see inside there it's like
kind of frozen on the side so we're
gonna put this in the fridge for like
ten minutes that's it and then once it's
frozen we have to actually cut off the
plastic okay so for now let's go ahead
let's put this in the freezer guys and
then we should be good to cut the
plastic okay here goes nothing guys
we're gonna put this right there I'll
see you in ten minutes
peace whoa whoa all right so about half
an hour there we left it in a bit longer
guys this is the coke bottle as you can
see it's been frozen and time to peel
off the plastic all you want to do you
want to cut the plastic off without
cutting the actual chocolate
oh wow I stabbed myself ah okay leave it
I did guys we've already messed up the
bottle we've actually already messed up
the ball y'all it's working guys look at
that look at that so just like my mom's
doing guys you want to slowly cut off
all the plastic don't worry if you
accidentally break parts of it it's okay
guys
it's okay just do the best you can so so
far this is our bottle guys um yeah it's
surviving alright so here you go boys
that is our chocolate that's nice it's
actually good it's actually gonna be
fine so there you go boys this is my
white chocolate coca-cola bowl as you
can see the front looks nice the back is
just broken it's not bad nice I know
