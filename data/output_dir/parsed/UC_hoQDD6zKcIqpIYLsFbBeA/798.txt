alright I know you've already finished
the middle time like ages ago but I
wanted to say thank you to anyone who
sent mail that we either opened upon
camera or off camera now you guys
probably saw we came from the post
office with more packages than we
actually opened so the ones that you
haven't seen are ones that the people
have told us to keep it private and
regardless I'm not showing you're
showing it we are so thankful for your
gifts they're so amazing thank you so
much like honestly we haven't mentioned
you because of some reasons we want to
say thank you and agreement a lot to me
after think you sent me so I really
appreciate it but yeah that has been no
time guys if you want to send something
for whatever reason you don't have to
show on camera just write a little note
straight away saying please don't show
on the video and we do respect that
because we know there's people out there
that just don't want to have it on the
blog but regardless I just want to say
thank you coming group hug everybody
group hug let's continue the rest of the
vlog today yeah I want to go out and see
if there'd be any way of getting like a
boxing bag now I don't want to hang it
in the house obviously because where am
I going to hang it but maybe if it's
possible like you see outside here on
that roof but I don't know I don't know
I really want a boxing bag if not I
would probably just get some gym stuff
because I hate going to the gym I do I
hey I just like working out at home more
than going for the gym so maybe I can
get some like dumbbells or something
because I'm going to be honest do you
hear that that is not a proud sound when
it comes to your penny did you hear that
echo that means you're becoming fat and
I don't know why I just can't find the
motivation just to exercise I just can't
find it I don't know if it's I don't
know that's all I'm going to say I just
can't find any motivation to exercise
and it's getting ridiculous
so let's try and start at home and then
build a little exercise routine mo is mo
hasn't got any motivation in life mad
it's tough man it's tough I was just
here safe for my mom to come downstairs
so he can leave to go buy my exercise
stuff and liquor bubbles
he's so snuggled up before I go looking
for any type of fitness equipment I
thought it would only be right if mere
mommy mo came to have some fast food
it's not any faster this Chili's it's
like fast food a bit better you know I
mean it's like mid-range fast food
anyways really up here I was super
hungry we haven't had dinner my beard is
going way too long I might gonna have to
trim it again but yeah after that we can
start looking for someone I don't know
dumbbell a basic fitness equipment maybe
I can start getting the shape I'm not
happy about you know the flabby blog
arms or whatever
and we just have to see I really like
the mugs they have a Chili's it looks
like I don't know you know your classic
hi captain
I I hear they don't wanna say goodbye
BMO they don't want us to have chicken
wings buffalo wings burgers guys this is
how you leave a tip they gave me a load
of coins and it's all going back in
there this is why I love to see when I
come into a sport jock 70% off okay I
think we might buy more than we came for
so I thought because they have a sale is
my lucky chance to buy something but
actually because they have a sale they
brought in loads of new arrival things
and this is the only weights they have
so they don't have you know them set
dumbbells or at least I can't find them
anyways this is the only thing I could
see so I think we're out of luck oh wait
is that oh that's a speed bag okay I'm
going to come back another time I guess
it didn't work out because normally
they'd have all their weights in that
corner issue with these green signs but
they've changed it with their new
arrivals and like t-shirts and shoes
for our block money more I'm going to
show my mum the watch I saw yesterday to
see what she thinks so this is guess
obviously let's see what she thinks
about the watch okay that was the watch
that one she liked it
why'd you prefer anything else oh they
never had that one they have a whole
blue one wait I might actually go for
the old blue one all right I'm gonna
check this out so can I see this one
outside the old blue one I never knew
you had that one
the one put it out on the emitter one
direction this Oh blue one would be good
or the one we saw yesterday do you only
have this here because I never saw in
your other store if you go with it no
this is the new one this is a new one
yeah I saw the other one yesterday this
is the new this is the same prices like
1045 or was it exactly a good 1105 that
one huh now that I've seen this let me
know if you prefer this one or the
silver one because you guys know I love
blue and this just looks awesome so let
me know because this has completely
changed my mind about which one to get
this one or that plain silver one which
you see there Wow
I don't know I just prefer the blue I
really do prefer the blue guys it's like
exactly the same it's just a blue strap
alright thank you so so much
I'll let you know in like two days to be
honest you this just me being honest
with you I really love the blue but my
mom did say something that I completely
agree with she said the blue looks a bit
more not childish but you know I mean it
doesn't look as like elegant it looks so
much nicer in my eyes but I do agree
with all my mom says like the silver one
it looks I don't know a more valuable
you know I mean there's more glossy let
me know blue or silver just type it down
below the comment section
before I end today's video I just want
to talk to you guys for like a couple of
seconds not too long now I do read
comments on YouTube now and then when it
comes to YouTube
and all I want to say you guys is
YouTube isn't something I'm too familiar
with obviously I've been doing it for a
year now but properly only for about six
months before I made the videos then and
there but I am trying to learn the best
I can you the whole YouTube thing is I
can learning curve for me so I really
appreciate your support with it I
appreciate anyone giving me good
constructive criticism and everything
like that
basically what I'm trying to say is I'm
human I make my mistakes sometimes
there's not going to be the best videos
out sometimes there's going to be really
good ones and I just hope that you guys
can just stay with me
on this learning adventure whatever you
want to call it but you guys have been
so good to me so far so all I can say is
thank you for now see you guys in
another vlog Mo out Yolo Yolo boy
