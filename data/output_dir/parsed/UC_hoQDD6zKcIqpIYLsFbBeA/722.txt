been awaited for a long long time we are
wrapping that Lamborghini yes we're
wrapping it today basically this is
what's going to happen to the car we're
not going to do a full body wrap but
it's gonna be more like a design so the
roof is gonna go black the rims are
gonna go black some front sections gonna
go black and hopefully it should look
really really awesome I'm sure it will
because we've seen pictures of like
similar designs and it turned out like
really dope
so we're taking this bad boy in right
now it's kind of got like a zebra design
from the roof right now which makes it
look really cool and yeah it's time to
go take it for a wrap I call it lie I'm
super super excited and this has been a
long time coming I know you guys have
wanted us to change up for so long and
I'm just really excited right now this

a black roof on it with some black like
mines there after my sister

lineup of cars they have over here
starting off with this SV oh my god you

of the other cars this is something
similar that we're going to be doing to

anyways we are back home as you can see
and our only gonna have the Mustang for
a whole day so no more Lambo today where
is it where is it it used to be right
here the poor baby
me and my mom are actually heading out
right now to go and try and find myself
a suction cup again it was actually me
and my mom who bought this pathetic
thing about a month ago and it broke
before we even used it like it broke
while I was playing around with it let's
head out and go see what's up world
isn't it like so weird like that
we're always inside but outside is the
world maybe that's just me because I
spend a lot of time at home on my
computer engine on yeah buddy we quickly
stopped by to grab myself some food but
there's a cat smelling my car what's up
little buddy I don't know the cats is
smelling my car what does it smell good
look at this lazy mummy more she's
sleeping in my car waiting for the food
to come oh my god guys there's also a
black cat here what's up man
what's up I completely love like full
black cats they look so so gorgeous and
this one's like a baby you know what's
up little buddy
don't worry I'll give you some food with
my gums okay so I got him some food but
he just doesn't seem to like it guys
okay know what I'm gonna leave it there
for them in case they want it later okay
so I just picked myself out a suction
cup and I'm just going to go pay for it
now but look at these bikes they have
over here like I don't know what these
bikes are let me know in the comment
section the ones I have like really
thick wheels I think there's some sort
of mountain bikes or something but let's
go and pay for my suction mount I swear
DJ booths are so cool but I wish I knew
what I was doing like I somehow made
this get stuck like bouncing it was
actually going around in circles I just
don't know how to work them like okay
let's try and press some buttons here
okay play there you go okay that's what
it's supposed to do guys
and you should like do that right but
that one is stuck I think I glitched out
or brokest on Honda I think we made this
work so does this yeah oh
I think I completely messed up
everything
DJ more okay so I think I can actually
become a DJ guys I learn a couple of
things number one this is the volume
okay now this is the bug okay I messed
it up loud I do it let us do this song
stop okay guys I swear I knew I was
doing okay take you take you guys this
is the volume there we go
that's how you change the volume and
secondly oh this is how they do it like
knowing they like hyping up you would
like do a hype man mode the building I
like okay I don't think my talent is in
the BJ place guys I couldn't used that
thing to save my life but I always love
coming to this store there's so many
cool things like to play around with yo
this is some hardcore stuff right here
this is a bow and it's a drone guys a
boat and a drone in a toy like what that
is some hardcore stuff right there yo
what's going on at the mall today why
are the elevators blue what you're like
a blue design to it any D lights and by
the way for those of you who love
Heights jump just jump imagine so my mom
came to get her Bund and basically they
all ran out so they're actually cooking
fresh ones right now that oven come on
it's ready yeah
thank you oh yeah I completely forgot to
show you guys the mount which I got for
my GoPro so this is why I got it seems
like a pretty complicated mount let's
open it up I'll put you guys right here
and see what it is I hope it's good
because yeah I need one pretty soon to
be honest four events coming up it is
extremely hard to open this this is the
mount there's a couple of pieces that
come with it pretty interesting it's
actually like huge by the way this mount
comes in four sections which is pretty
complicated but I'm sure I can figure it
out
some way okay since I've fiddled around
with it so much let's actually see if
the main thing works the suction cups so
I think it said something like that push
down and flip I can't do it correctly
push down flip okay this should be stuck
on pretty hard now alright not bad at
all okay you know what at least it does
the job cut oh my god uh-oh mommy I
think I broke it
and now actually it's fine it's fine
it felt so badly though one snacked I
always have and I mentioned this ages
ago in London but back then I had like
three thousand subscribers and no lie
pretty much every single night this is
the snack I have ok maybe not every
single night but once every two nights I
grab myself oh my god no no no mommy no
no my crisps they finished they finished
ok I know one of the flavours finished
but normally what I do is I take two
different flavored crisps but because I
have no more of the tomato on
I take like two of these let's say and I
take myself some plain Greek yogurt my
friends find is disgusting but let me
know if you guys do it is all I just dip
the crisps in the yogurt and here like
plain Greek yogurt but they thought that
was weird I don't know why maybe a lot
of you do I think people do I swear I'm
convincing myself it's something normal
like it tastes so nice people have to do
it that is some plain Greek jogger for
you guys this thing okay and you just
have it you just have it with the crisps
you just dip that into that and yeah one
last thing to mention in order to put a
GoPro on a suction mount you need an
actual GoPro and the problem is I've got
this selfie stick and if you look there
that brown stuff it's rust and what that
Russ does it does not allow me to open
it like legit no joke I have to use this
every single time I want to open it just
to be able to open it and it's not that
easy it makes sense if I actually open
it the right way and it wasn't actually
as hard as I thought moe
it wasn't as hard as I thought I was
actually tightening it more than
anything anyways there you go now I have
my GoPro the winter wrap-up today is
look here but before I do I want to be
honest with you guys I am a failure like
legit I'm a failure so if you guys don't
remember I bought this a couple months
back maybe one or two months back and I
said I was going to do bicep curls
straight for like two months and the
last time I did this no joke it was
probably on the warm which I think was
about one or two months ago so I'm not
even going to hurt my
all right now by doing it I just wanted
to let you guys know I completely
cheated I completely failed and I'm
sorry I'm sorry
anyways I love you will I'll see you
guys two more for another blokes day
also and yeah come back to see how the
Lambo turns out I know it's going to be
awesome
anyways they also already love you all
yo yo lo goodbye
