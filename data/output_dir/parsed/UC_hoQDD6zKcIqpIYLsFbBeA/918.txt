scenery is super nice we're just gonna
go head over to whatever the restaurant

it looks really nice in here fine so
these are our seats and this is pretty
much how it works
what's your seat pseudo you're seeing
and you come into the bouquet and you
hit your food so they've got a huge
selection obviously we're just standing
here so this is the bread it starts over
here you can see everything you can
possibly want and this is one room and
like four or five okay let's keep going
let's get going I think this is oriental
food and then we got this is those
pretty cool nice well you guys happy I'm
not too much of an oriental person so my
mom's having something I'm gonna skip
this section and move on to the next one
that big steak yeah oh yeah boys this is
what I'm talking about
nice yeah yeah that's good that's good
that's it actually what is enough what
is enough yeah
I'm going to show you this little cool
decoration type of thing they have it
alright let's keep going oh I found it
the chicken section did your dick in the
chicanery like that so he's preparing up
like a little dish for everybody and
we're just waiting in line to have them
yeah
so look what my mom's always that Wow
I'm gonna go try and find the rice I'm
not sure is it here so where's the white
rice white rice is here okay thank you
yeah let's have a bit of this
okay wait mom can you help me
see I got all my food I don't really
explain it but each section here has
like a team so the first section was
like oriental food and breaded something
this is more like a perfect Arabic
section and then obviously every single
one had always have a sieve inside it or
maybe two or three themes at once I'm
gonna go sit down and start eating I
finished my first round of food or a bat
for round two to be honest I'm mostly
looking forward to dessert because they
have like baskin-robbins ice creams and
most places they don't have like ice
cream which I literally it's literally
like those Baskin Robbins you're gonna
have any size girl at that idea for this
school but it's perfect I love that
about me as the perfect dessert they
also have one of the chocolate war about
it I think so anyways that's what they
had last time I was here and they've
kind of renovated then look so not sure
that other they still had I just saw it
my mom is picking outside it's really
really that healthy through this I'm not
too hungry anymore
I might just get like one more steak and
go I kind of got embarrassed guys I'm
not having around too because I'm sick I
feel really full so once all my family
is done having their thing even my mom
got a second round and she doesn't need
anything I literally she's not the
smallest appetizer she's even more than
me today because I'm so sick so I'm
gonna wait for everyone to finish their
food and look I'm like the day that we
got this such a nice selection only a
butter and Bracken and a butter and
bread dust I'm definitely how can I just
take one of these okay wait give me a
plate give me a plate for this chop
break it yeah oh my god okay get me by
it can you do it for me my hand is full
please thank you does a great way to
break it yeah yeah let's go actually
dare do they have like softer bread wait
where do they have Lebanese bread I
really like that Belize bread

what type of bread is that that's super
funky right now they were like the
biggest bread collection ever so our
family's all gone at the moment so being
quickly blog what's going on

bread that he like literally you know
what happened it was so embarrassing
I came to break the stick and I slammed
on the plate and it went everywhere yeah

dessert which is over there at the back

Year's but back then I wasn't a proper
vlogger I didn't vlog anything nicely so
that's exactly where we sat for New
Year's and the fireworks show was going
on over here next to Borge should we
take a couple more of those and
obviously you have all the yachts lining
up it was funny because when the like
firework shows going on there was drones

I think like people had it themselves
and they're just flying you around to
get cool jobs and the hotel change got a
Toretto where what right the head oh
