good morning guys and today you're
watching mo vlogs today we're starting
the vlog direction here to take away our
sofas and basically put covers on like
we did to these ones so that is what's
happening for now oh my god it's looking
so much emptier without one of the
couches these are the other two they
just wrap them up before they took them
so that it doesn't get damaged on the
way this house looks empty now no let me
see where they're gonna put it so I
think they came yet they're gonna put it
in the back of that truck which you can
see there and then take them away okay
this is the last guy left and going to
see you soon buddy don't worry you'll be
back you'll be all wrapped and nice look
how empty this place looks now it looks
like we're moving when we're not alright
well there goes the couches see you
later okay now that that's done I guess
we can continue with the rest of the day
I'm looking so dark there we go much
better
okay let's lock the door we've
officially been kicked out of our own
house we have nothing in here anymore
it's not really I'm just kidding
I'm outside again today alone I just
came to do a beer shooting up I think
cuz I just bought a got it just so fun
to play around with so I'm not gonna
bore you guys to watching the vlog I'm
just gonna take a couple shots on camera
and yeah let's try and improve my
accuracy so I don't lose to my sister
again how many locks do these things
have right push that down BAM okay time
to do some shooting I took a couple
shots off-camera
this is going to be my first on on
camera I'm confident I'll hit one for
you let's zoom it in and see if I can
there you go targets are in place let's
get ready to shoot no Mitch
darn it last shot guys let's make it
count
I know I've only taken like two but oh
oh yeah we made it just due to the fact
that yesterday's vlog was mostly about
this gun and us shooting it I'm going to
stop recording and just have
fun with it by myself and yeah I think
you guys are gonna get bored of if I
just keep blogging me shooting the same
target because I'm popping bottles
I've got my supercar my cup doesn't your
fit in the cup it is that time again
finally cooking with mo is back now a
few days ago I think I mentioned we were
gonna do this and I said I wasn't in
opposed to cooking with mo but I finally
come to a new decision I'm going to put
some parts of the cooking the main parts
are showing you the cake showing you
what we kind of did on the blogs
and then the full video Beyond The
Cooking Channel so if you guys want to
make the cake or just see the full
procedure go to the cooking channel to
watch it and if you just want to see the
cool parts just stay on the boat channel
one that's all we will show but today
I'm gonna make que si yes going to be
right this is what we're making a que si
gingerbread man that's what I can say
alright mom you ready for cooking a glow
behind the scenes only on the vlogs
action hey guys so here I am today I
kind of think of how I can introduce my
video
Kings law and ice nothing's going to my
head give me a second I got an idea
this is the problem with cooking Jamal
my mom cut the whole production because
my sister called her look at this I've
got a whole tripod in my hand filming
this the funny thing is my mom was
actually going to use the white cake
mixture
I just thought make more sense raki que
si that's not like the brown cake
because I've been with his face right
okay I can't believe it but we luckily
managed to crack our eggs and a smiley
face came out that is how you know this
cooking video is going to be awesome
let's continue we're kind of cheating we
were unprepared we didn't think the
mixture would be that much
so we're pouring it all into here and
then mixing it there and on the cooking
channel we're going to pretend like we
mix it in that white bowl even though
we're cheating only you guys watching
the vlog will know that but yeah we were
not prepared for that the mixture is so
big it's like huge this is not like we
were gonna make one gingerbread man and
now it's going to be like a hundred
little gingerbread men this is how you
cheat when you're on a Cooking Channel
just pretend like you hand mixed it but
really this is live been doing for like
10 20 seconds it's much faster and I can
just pretend like I did a lot of hard
work Oh
I really did anything all right oh I'm
done cheating for now this looks
delicious
look at that so shiny now that you have
your mixture ready you're going to want
to pour it into wherever you want so
we're going for a gingerbread man today
if you have just like a normal pan like
this you might want to go there we're
going to start pouring this into each
one of these and try and make some cool
things with it I hope this doesn't pour
everywhere whoa
our gingerbread man is coming to life
that's so cool
no it's dripping from under it that's
right I don't think that should be a big
problem he's bleeding the gingerbread
man is bleeding look at him poor guy
he's leaking no currently just saying
waiting for the cake to bake we're not
even sure how we're supposed to use this
oven like we don't know we want the heat
to come from all sides but I'm not sure
what these things even mean like we have
that I know that's chicken that's like
from the top but I'm not too sure
exactly what these other ones do so we
just have to wait and see look at the
cake inside well let's just put you up
against there it's kind of inflated so I
think it's going well and looks like
it's cooking but I'm not sure exactly
how it's going to taste it should be
good though this is how you test if your
cake is actually cooked or not you just
live straight-out up and you just take a
sample what's wrong bubbles and think of
bubbles and key they're coming to do
some cooking with us all right we
finished making the cake guys and look
at that that is awesome we made a little
case I wouldn't let my mom hold all
right you got it you got it
that is so cool we made a ksi cake
ah that is awesome I feel so excited
because just because it looks so awesome
I'm not sure how it tastes I have a
right it yet but don't you is they were
focusing on ksi all right
smash life on anything that it's really
cool leave us suggestions to do and
check out the full video of us making
this cake if you enjoyed it but for now

that time of the day we're going out I
didn't want to stay at home because the
home is empty we have no more couches

so me and my mom aren't going out a QA
let me turn off the lights over here and
yeah it's time to go out to the mall to
the shopping center do you guys called
it shopping center all right we finally
made it I really love this entrance we
always seem to walk in through there and
I see super cars there's a McLaren
they're rolls-royce somewhere over there
let's go inside and just hang out
that's pretty cool guys that is a
McLaren 650s I think looks super awesome
and this is a special insert because of
my mum she really wanted me to show you
this one now when she was younger she
had like a little crystal collection of
her own and she actually had one of
these swans which is pretty cool but
let's go are you happy now I put it in
the vlog so you know your boy came to
the food court guess I got you guys

a reason for it this time

video if you know I mean so I'm gonna go
check if it's ready both me and my mom
are having it so let's see if it is
ready if not then I'll have to come back

put it down without dropping it this is
so risky there you go

today I made my mom site I made Pierce I
am my mom today literally my mom had a
bite out of my burger

know I do for something normal with less
diamonds okay my mom is gone and she
don't even realize so yeah

of Ski Dubai I think actually no it's
too open I see people in there I thought
it was closed but I see like two people

really empty because it's late at night
like 10 o'clock and the malls about to
