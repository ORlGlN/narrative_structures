of the teddy bear is so soft you can
literally cut him with that every day
that is awesome right I like that I like
that a lot
it's kind of expensive though it's like
three and a half thousand dollars it's
super soft that's why I love about it is
super soft you can sleep on this you
reckon you can stand on it and he'll
stay up or nah I wouldn't risk it he'll
fall three years soft anywhere they
actually have a system where if you got
like a newborn baby you can come get his
hands and feel like clarified there's

been that many times these are the type
of stairs that we need to have in our
house guys like a long corridor of
stairs with carpets whoa

mirror now there's a mirror mode I came
outside to show you the view but number
one it's too dark and number two it's
too hot so we're heading back inside

out there all right guys so we just met
up with our friends and basically
they're staying over here if you didn't
know that last hotel they have like
these villa type places where you can
stay at so it's like a villa not like
