here casually the blue Bugatti okay guys
so right now I just made it inside the
Gucci store as I mentioned I'm getting
my mum a purse for ade but they actually
give you like an adorable card where you
can write something for her your boys
the savage guys so I'm gonna write mom
you're welcome all right there you go
mommy mo so you already know what it is
we're in the Gucci store with Ross head

gonna take this in as if it's my bag
all right secondly now here's the thing
my mom and sister know I'm in the car
right now so my sister thinks I'm here
to surprise my mom and my mom thinks I'm
here to surprise my sister so they're
both like thinking it's for the other
