good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog today is go time I've currently
taken all the big suitcases downstairs
taxis waiting so let's head off to their
poor Olympus drop Tron
alright so it's go time guys you filled
up the taxi - is so just going
downstairs and I'm pretty much in here
alone but look at this everything is
just packed up I'm tired I let Hattie
literally carry all them suitcases
downstairs we've got so many but down
that's literally everything now so I can
just sit and relax until the airport
for that
hey guys
we basically didn't own
okay straight to the airport
I've been awake
all right so we're on the way to
therefore right now as much sister was
saying I think anyways I'm not too sure
she's just in the back sleeping on my
mom's lap yeah there you go
that's dead find me at the airport my
sister is behind that if you can see her
my mom is obviously in front right there
we're fine you here today is that the
messiest day ever like it was raining
now we're under this like lossing but it
was raining outside there my sister
can't even push our own trolley
it's just a mess today I'm just glad
we're here now let's just go sort out if
we can even take all of this luggage
because we've got three twenties and
we're three people so you already tell
it's a lot of stuff
so everything was successfully put in I
don't know how it will manage to go with
the amount of weight we had we couldn't
even see it because normally we like try
and look how much your weight and now
it's all the hand luggage to go and just
catch up light I'm literally so shared
right now I don't I don't even know I
don't even look that bad I think it's
you know the swag makes it look I'm
joking but quickly that's yourself out
take these and cap Trump like there's a
one hour delay so that shouldn't be a
problem with catching up light for
finding here our favorite restaurant
with the fam you know and we just
ordered our food service when it comes
to got always get my pizza my sister
always gets her pasta
my mom always get turn chicken in the
chicken yet
so initially every time we get the exact
same thing I think we're just going
stuck to like our favorite dish so
hopefully your food comes in so far
everything's awesome
tell them that you slept and you did not
contribute to practice as for his
medical doctor listen and then me and my
mom stayed up to be honest it was Oliver
stop any rate so none of my my stuff was
already packed and then she helped me
and I still feel tired even though I
slept the whole night it's again we're
just going to have our food a tea you'll
be good my food finally came I want to
show you I'm a simple guy just one
computer then we have my sister's dish
over there which is some pasta things
she likes and then finally my mom's
chicken we're just about to eat and
after that I think we'll just I know are
we going to go to the lounge after or
just pretty is gonna walk around until
the gates are open because I don't know
where the lounge is here I think I'm in
here battling the emirates lounge is
closed and they told us that we have to
use the british airways one so i think
we'll just leave it
I'm working
I'm gonna Jam no there's one hour delay
one hour delay one hour
hae-in's with mom how's the food my
sister got her honey finally was it
showed him so basically it's basically
honey with the comb inside mr. rager
hi who cares no one cares so me and my
mom are in Cafe de niro we're just
picking out some drinks
yes I'm not having anything my mom's
just having like a latte or something I
was going to have a hot chocolate but
then I was like so little with a nice
sandwiches they have again I'm really
picky I don't like any like salads and
stuff so that's what about having
we're on our way to go inside my sister
wanted me to carry that but I'm carrying
my hears you know all right let's go
make it guys our gate open
walking fast faces better the home I
didn't realize my hat was dragging
across the floor for the arm that's
disgusting all do you
we just over Douai we're just about to
land and I'll see once we're in the air
quite
all right so we just touched down guys
literally most spotlight was transits
and my people going to other countries
and they all stopped back there they're
just panicking it's so bad I think they
all should make them lighter it's all
that bad for them because I saw big
groups of people collecting yeah that's
tomorrow morning we're picking them up
between 8:00 and 10:00 so you see them
tomorrow
we haven't seen them in a long time
and then I actually met one of you on
the plane the guy was like it was like
he was like do you have a lamp oh that
was the first question
now that yes oh you know your Fuji
videos she was free so I just said I -
and I was pretty much here but you're
awesome all my fans I love you guys
supporting me and stuff we need to go
pick up our luggage we're so late really
standing let's move we're just standing
on this light little because it's moving
like a 1 mile an hour or a sign that
that really stuck so we should pick up
our baggage I'm super shattered and I
need to upload my video right now so I
don't know how that's going to happen
that's why like I know what video it's
going to be able to be like two three
days ago and it would have been up to
uploaded at like 12 London time 3 a.m.
to buy time probably that's one that's
probably going to go off and not even 2
4 so I'm sorry about that it's just as I
was traveling so you finally come
through immigration and stuff like that
and now we're in there but all we need
to do now is collect the baggage and the
first thing I'm going to do is not even
leave here we're going to actually
quickly go to a coffee shop because I
need to upload my video super late as I
said but it's ok how many do we need two
or three I think these are bigger so we
get two alright so I just want to show
you a bit more of the airport I think
looks really nice
all these pillars and bright lights and
everything just add I think I've showed
you this before and let even the roof I
don't even know I'm showing you guys
anymore but
see my sister's is waving to you guys in
the background and we've got so much
luggage that I don't even know how we're
going to find it well it's just going to
be a mess so my brother decided that you
will pick up all the suitcases on its
own so let's see how it goes the first
one
a month ago five final deal
well that's mine just check the tag
though yeah it's mine because I've
painted over my good
boys you gotta say for the camera didn't
record the court properly okay
I lost suitcase guys we've got every
single one dude and he goes in and he
takes it and touchdown hey let's go
that's it squad is rolling out me first
followed by my sister and my mom you
know squad
yeah the train choo-choo got how we're
going guys they've got the defense
system at the back and then we've got me
the leader we're just about to go
through the place where they check if
you have anything to declare so I'm
going to stop recording before they find
me suspicious time to upload my video
Acosta all right so we're hearing Koster
you can see we're all seeing having
drinks now the reason I came we stopped
those my video unfortunately the Wi-Fi
here in the airport blocks YouTube I
think for safety reasons but it's all
good cuz my sister has Wi-Fi on or Foe
now I'm just going to use that to upload
my video so fingers crossed everything
is going to go good or scenario I just
have to go home and upload it and we'll
just take an extra 1 hour so it's not
too bad it's just a very late video
