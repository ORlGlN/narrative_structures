Oh
yo yo yo yo everyone welcome to another
vlog so if you don't already know by the
Tyler thumbnail of this video today's
log is gonna be one of those special car
vlogs Sol in like 20 minutes time my
friend is coming to pick me up in his
Lamborghini Aventador roadster which
should be awesome in itself but besides
from that we're actually heading off
into the mountain to that car and a
bunch of other Lamborghinis so should be
really really fun I hope you enjoy it
and I'll see you once he gets here okay
I think the Aventador is waiting outside
let's go boys got myself a little bag
with all my camera equipment as well
Lego here it is guys got the Aventador
on fleek how's it going oh doors up I'm
in the Aventador right now this sounds
much louder than I don't like sound like
it
very heavy Rumble compared to the
hurricane should be fun
that entails possible
so behind me you can probably see all
the cars that showed up Wow
okay everybody's starting up we're ready
to leave I thought I'd show you all the
colors because we have like a rainbow of
cars right now starting with the baby
blue Gallardo the green hurricane the
gorgeous red hurricane the amazing
orange of n0 that I've been in and then
finally the blue Aventador so
everybody's starting up right now and we
are ready to leave boys this should be
really fun oh you're taking the roof off
there you go guys
the roof is off on our orange Aventador
I'm super excited right now guys because
I'm going in this scarcer thing we're
the only convertibles except from the
blue Gallardo actually so this should be
fun and yeah look at that beast if you
see my hair super Macias because of my
look ahead
they actually sticks out his Karma
this guy's not gonna like it
when you have a convertible you kind of
the door next to me right now
if you guys are wondering how powerful
the Aventador is this car
my 700 horsepower now
the first 100
really do feeling guys trust me Egypt
and has a begin 20x
moly
I'm not even gonna lie guys I've
slightly lost my voice from all the
shouting it was windy I can barely hear
myself
just so you guys know assets been the
one driving perfectly today so shout out
to Haven
okay we're actually gonna put the roof
back home right now so might as well
show you guys how it's done if you don't
know to push that button down okay so
there you go guys half the roof is on
it's actually like two solid parts or
you just like clip them on I'm sure a
lot of you know this but just to show
people that don't is the roof heavy or
it's pretty light okay
great laughs there we go the roof is
back on so we did in fact stop by the
mounds I think everyone was taking bows
but because we stopped by like a little
snack I think everyone's leaving now so
we won't be here for too long to stop by
there's loads of people taking bows
because this is a really cool lineup as
you can see just look at the colors okay
or game back in the car straight away
which is pretty fun anyway let's go
these guys definitely anyways we're
heading out so I don't have our lunch
now shout out to everybody here like
there's a lot of people that recognize
the channel so shout out to you guys
anyways let's go have our lunch okay we
made it to the is it raining yep
yeah really okay it's raining filling it
so I really like about this place we've
come to it's got really gorgeous light
Lake behind me if you can see that so
there's a lot of wind coming it's so
refreshing and it's actually like I
don't know if it's rained or somehow the
war is getting blown up I think it is
like a little bit of rain here but it's
absolutely amazing anyways cars as my
friend said skills they look like
schools because all the colors but I
think boots should be coming soon we're
going to eat and then have a fast way
back and that is an AMG GTS that just
arrived I guess and he is leaving a few
things
everybody's just lucky so I think
everybody has taken a good amount of
shots to be honest and I think not sure
if we're gonna have our lunch here or
somewhere else but guys after driving or
riding in the Aventador should I say I
swear compared to a hurricane it's got a
massive kick when you like put your foot
down on the throttle like the first time
I said accelerated I was like just like
my heart legit just like went all the
way back into my spine I it was mad but
seriously awesome drive
so there's actually another Aventador
showing up
can you hear a lot pray loudly from far
away it makes
Wow
so now we actually have two orange
Aventadors it should be pretty fun I
think this one has like a spoiler on the
back so since this event door with a
body kit showed up let me show you it's
actually got a DMC body kit if I'm not
mistaken looks really really awesome
look at this thing it's got a huge huge
spoiler on the back really really
awesome man
I actually am becoming a huge fan of
spoilers before I wouldn't really pay
attention to them but now when you see
like the cars with and without spoilers
you're like damn like it adds a bit of
an edge but saying that it still looks
lovely without one like look at this
this is without a spoiler from here from
here on out we're actually heading that
was lovely
we're heading guys to the miles from
here on I should get really exciting far
so let's get into the car and go
everybody's heading off this
okay let's go on fighting my
haha
yeah this is like a proper round
I'm not sure if you guys can see all of
these twists and turns
the reason I haven't been speaking much
guys is because I just want you guys to
listen for the sounds of these cars they
are amazing just listen to that right I
don't want to talk too much the smaller
fun so I'm just going to keep on
recording the cars and I hope you enjoy
it is it some extremely twisty and
winding road that chest is car a lot
like most the time I'm just signing
really see why when it comes to these
cars
Wow
I'm a bit of a breather
I strongly been kidding guys I wasn't
breathing like most of that dragon on
the road I was holding my breath but
insane absolutely insane that was the
craziest ride I've ever been in guys I
did not expect that one boom anyways we
are officially at the top of the
mountain right now as you can see loads
and loads of people here in this parking
lot just admiring the cars really really
cool you can get from above this
mountain I'm not sure if you see it let
me try and squeeze my camera through
here but look down there like you don't
realize how high we are there is a
pretty big crowd around the cars I mean
a humongous crowd like there's people
everywhere these cars have gained a lot
of Attraction I guess up here the crowd
is so big I'm finding it hard to walk
across like there are so many people I
think you'd say about 100 150 people as
you can see just around these cars but
they do that gorgeous I mean why not
take a couple of photos here and there
okay I think we're gonna head off now as
I said
the beasts up it turned on
we came a bit lower down the mountain
somewhere emptier to take balls because
over there oh boy there was a huge crowd
I'm sure you guys saw that so it seems
pretty much impossible to take these
gosh somewhere where a load of you were
don't gather around them I swear we came
down to try and take a nice Bowl but it
seems to be really really busy here so
as you can see there's like no way of
getting just the cars alone okay yes
yes I think Nikki okay check this out
boys I finally think we get a good photo
time look at that things you do for
photography is on the car taking
pictures I'm sure they're gonna turn out
dope hi
yeah yeah shout out - what is it son -
not lame
okay I sounds good huh the cars are
getting moved again we thought it was
the three mentors in the front in the
two Gorgons on the edge and then
Gallardo right behind us as like a
symmetric photo like our OCD like going
into car pose like it has to be
symmetrical there's our a symmetrical
line of Lamborghini Aventador and for
our hands
Aventador doors are all getting lifted
up like ah this is dope this is dope I'm
not even gonna lie I'm taking some the
best both I've ever taken up here but
look at the line of guys anyways we're
heading out soon to go down and home
took some amazing shots out here like
the views incredible okay that is a wrap
at the top of the mountain I show the
Sun starts to get to you and you're out
here bar he's got a flame spear Wow my
ears just bought
that is loud as hell lies extremely loud
not going to lie that human my ears like
I've never had my ears that hurt it
sounds like explosions going all right
Wow oh my god guys I've never heard
Lamborghini louder than that like in
ready
it's actually pretty cloudy now on the
way back it's been absolute madness now
you can see me America today was amazing
like my expectations
we did so much accelerating on the
family
too much bad drivers
right you are the my sister now you're
back to the dirt
actually likes you in the same review as
I said we've stopped by the petrol
station for like a five minute break and
I can't tell you how much I needed this
break because sitting in this car for an
hour or two as fun as it is because of
how loud the engine is it starts to get
you like a headache but now that we stop
we're having like a bit of a relaxed
time and I want to show you the interior
of this car because it looks gorgeous
like it's orange on orange it's just
amazing like look at this I mean orange
on black what am I saying orange on
orange but really fantastic I know you
guys have seen it throughout the day but
it just looks so good like to be honest
I already loved the Aventador you guys
knew that I loved those on my favorite
car but after today my love for it has
gone like beyond bike this car feels way
different than the rock and I know you
guys like Lamborghinis or Lamborghinis
but trust me when you like accelerate in
a hurricane and you accelerate in an
Aventador like you can tell like there's
a 90 horsepower difference but it feels
way different I think the whole system
this car has is different and I'll
confirm that once acid gets back but it
feels remarkable in this car anyways
we're gonna head back home now with the
car wow the weather is actually like
perfect right now like it's cloudy the
Sun isn't out and to be honest the Sun
was starting to give me a headache so
I'm really enjoying this like fresh
breeze right now there's like a it's
like a tiny bill wind just like the
perfect amount anyways the vents door
with the doors up looks fantastic okay
ready to go let's go boys I just got
