yo yo everyone good morning and welcome
to another vlog so I'm starting today
off with my new camera let me know what
you guys think is it good is it bad this
morning I met you guys are gonna roast
me for these I'm sending my mom and
sister off to send out the cameras for
the giveaway winners I know I not said
like 10 days ago but I never got around
to going to the post of the soul this
morning as you can see these are the
camera so we're just packaging them up
putting them in this box and then
they're going to go and send them out so
this one is going to the Philippines I
think and this one is going to like
Texas the USA so that's pretty cool
those are the two giveaway winners we
actually only have one box so we're
gonna use this box and try and make like
another mini box office somehow not too
sure how that's gonna work out I guess
we're just gonna have to see to be
honest too much gonna go outside to see
how this camera records in the daytime
pretty nice actually pretty nice look at
that man by the way I just want to put
this out there my sister is at ninety
nine thousand subscribers so we might
actually have to be doing 100k party for
her or celebration not too sure and the
funny thing is what-what just fell on my
car there how was that
she's got eleven videos on her channel
if you guys have ever started a YouTube
channel you would know eleven videos is
not enough to get you a hundred thousand
subscribers so all I can say is you must
have the best content in the world
hey guys so today me and mommy more
about to head to the post office to pick
up some of your fan mail we're looking
forward to those and also we're gonna be
sending up the cameras that two of you
guys won in the competition so mommy
let's go today we're driving the Range
Rover so brings back good memories guys
so replying at the post office let's see
what's inside
Wow okay we've got a couple of letters
from you guys let's see okay so we
couldn't actually send you the cameras
today because a brand new with the new
something that's new you need an invoice
for it and we left the receipt at home

to my boys showroom and they like she
got two really special cars over here so
the first one I'm going to show you babe
the McLaren p1 guys now if you guys
don't know much about this car this is a
hyper car so there's three hyper cars
overall there's the McLaren p1 which is
this there's the Ferrari laferrari and
the Porsche 9 1 a and basically all of
these cars are monsters so check it out
absolutely crazy car crazy design like
if you look at the cuts and the bends
this car has it's just ridiculous guys
just look at it so I'm gonna put the
doors up right now so you can see so as
I can button around here you just press
the button so I accidentally forgot to
have the key with me so the alarm went
off but let's go ahead and open this
door so as I said the buttons over here
you press it and the door is actually
really really heavy guys so there you go
check it out full carbon fiber if you
can see under the door alright take a
good look at that guys both doors are up
that's just number one that's number one
guys there is another beast in this sure
but first up restoring a flight with the
McLaren p1 so I've actually never been
around a p1 while it's getting switched
on so we're gonna do it right now so you
guys can listen for yourselves
here goes nothing boys
check it out guys that makes a monster
noise
hmm I couldn't hear myself
hi are you guys ready for the main car I
came here to show you guys I know the p1
was gorgeous but check this house we got
the main thing saying no that
double-wide CC me maintain tilling I'll
be double fly I say let's make a clown
with you browsers butter paper or brass
worth me doing
no words are needed for what this is
Bugatti and the main thing I absolutely
love about this car is the color and you
guys should know why just take a look at
this monster I'm gonna go around the car
as you can see I've never seen a Bugatti
like this I've seen red and black
Bugattis but they've been done
completely differently to this one in
the back we got the 16 cylinder monster
engine I'm actually gonna quickly show
you the interior of this beast guys
because it is also red and black and
it's suede if you guys look at that the
whole car is suede it just looks really
really crazy I mean you can tell the
owner really customize this when they
were getting it they made sure
everything was perfect and yeah I've
always said that I absolutely love red
interiors on cars like red and black is
one of my favorite color combinations if
you guys didn't already know and this
just says it all man anyways as soon as
I found out these two cars were here I
had to run down to vlog it for you guys
because you can't miss a Bugatti in a p1
like you don't see them things any day
so hopefully you guys enjoyed my little
mini review about the cars I mean I just
come here to look at them like I'm to
sit in them like I just feel I feel like
I could sit in this car wherever it went
like I could drive down a mountain like
falling off a cliff but if I'm in this
car I don't even think I'd mind
I don't even think I'd mind every time I
see myself sitting and I don't want to
get out and I mean sitting and that just
makes you feel like a million
like it makes you feel special now that
we have the key let me hop in and turn
this beast on guys so you guys can take
a look so he goes in over here you turn
it lights turn on and then this is the
startup oh it's not the loudest of
course you guys are not made to be loud
but they are just really good
performance wise I just realized one
more thing about this Bugatti guys this
is a fire extinguisher right I'm pretty
sure it's a fire extinguisher
this car comes fully equipped light I
couldn't spot it because it was so
blended in because it's red and black
but Wow
see you later boo guys see you later ah
look at the cat guys running away 90
spoken if they can please add like more
legs if possible they can make all I'd
like that please well there you go we
just ordered ourselves a 1 a.m. take
away guys a vacuum not pieces I wanna
end that's breakfast for all of you the
guy was like so confused he was like how
many leg pieces do you want one of them
why not ok food finally got here guys it
took a long damn time look at the order
guys we literally got a bucket for the
legs it's not even halfway filled up
