yo guys what is up welcome to another
vlog I'm starting this vlog in B&Q we're
shopping we're trying to find some cloth
for my rabbits we went and got a super
glue already but once you find a couple
of things we're going to go ahead and
buy them I have no idea why we're here
we're just looking around I think we're
looking at the fate for us to be honest
I'll show you right there we're thinking
about a fake cross I'm putting it
indoors for our rabbits because it's
winter so if we do do that I'll show you
guys once we get it and put it inside
but yeah for now I'll see you guys soon
when we do something else so yeah peace
out alright guys we've given up we're
not even like going to find them fake
cross just because it feels too like
rough and I don't think I'd like it so
now we've given up and we're coming to
the section where it's like carpet so
yeah maybe I am so going to get new
cards I don't know anymore I'll see you
guys soon okay guys final thought is
that we're going to get them a green rug
we thought the grass is too hard so why
not get something green that looks like
grass and they'll just sleep in it and I
try and dig it they'll never dig you
know that was the thought so I think
we're going with this what you guys
think let me know in the comments and
they've also got some super dude but
yeah if we do get this I'll find lice in
a couple of minutes let's go
so guys yes the green one was finalized
there it is I'm putting it in my boot I
hope you guys can see but Hannah hell do
I fit it I think that should do so yeah
see you guys soon alright guys so our
home at the moment I'm just about to
edit one of my vlogs but let's see what
is going on so this highlight at my
blogs I do it on my laptop on iMovie and
at the moment I just got myself some
chicken wings from Sainsbury's you know
how my rose he has to have it they get
killed by these editing but yeah I will
be setting up let go I had to show you
and you can see over there a museum at
NEC
that's that green thing we bought from
being key I think it is being too yet to
set it up for our rabbits but once we
set off I'll show you their little setup
you know rabbit house tour but yeah once
we do that I'll show you but for now I'm
going to edit my video upload it and
this video you're watching now is
probably going to be up in like three
days or something I don't even know but
yes you guys soon all right guys what is
that we're finally at home the green
thing we've always finally been put
to place I'm going to go ahead and show
you that right now
there is my rabbits cages and you can
see the green thing is right here there
is Lulu she's in her little box thing
over there she's very like dark so you
can't see her
and there is fluffy just sleeping in the
corridor how are you doing fluffy he's
really tired I'm going to go get a
close-up of it and see how he's doing
are you good
wow he's breathing so heavily it's
ridiculous but yeah it actually looks
pretty decent I think now they've got
their own little play area which looks
really nice and there he goes fluffy
call it go see your new house no not
interested he's really not interested
but yeah that is how it looks I think it
looks pretty amazing but for today the
vlog is over that's all I've done today
and fluffy is having a little go a house
I don't think they like at the moment
they just haven't been used to it even
Lulu she's up there in a little box
no yeah there he goes and he's gonna
jump straight into his box I'm not even
sure yet but yeah they don't really like
at the moment just because it's new and
they always have like a little fuss with
stuff when it's new ba even his chronic
left there he goes he goes inside but
yeah and that is going to be the end of
the vlog for today hopefully you enjoyed
it I actually decided not to put one of
my vlogs on the other day where you saw
the fail video just because I saw the
vlog and it was really boring or
speaking so darling it and what the hell
just crashed through yeah so I didn't
put it up because I thought was boring
on able to put up a boring vlog but yeah
