yo yo good morning everyone welcome back
to another vlog so today's video is
actually gonna be a very special one
right now we are heading to go look at
one of the craziest hyper cars out there
at the moment we are going over to the W
Motor Show room and we're gonna be
checking out the lichen and the veneer
now if you guys know anything about
these cars they are the most
ridiculously designed cars out there
they look absolutely amazing so today
it's time to go look at them in depth
let's go
check it out we are finally here at the
W motors showroom and behind me is one
of the cars we are checking out today so
this is the veneer if you guys think you
could look at it you can tell this car
is an absolute beast so right now I'm
gonna take you in-depth and show you why
this car is worth millions okay so
before I actually take you through this
car I'm actually with my good friend
psyche hey guys we're checking this car
out together because he is actually very
interested in the car so right now I
think it's better he told us a bit about
this car but I don't know that much
about you know first things first they
just need to look at the car it looks
like a monster guys it's an absolute
beast now this is the final version guys
this is actually a road-legal version of
the car Wow the fenice ounds better all
right I want to hear I'm down first
thing you can tell the doors are
actually I think I do call these suicide
doors right now we're about to switch
this beast on
that's a that has a roar to it oh my
goodness
down crazy right well I'm not trying to
be a bad friend to convince you but I
think this is the car you need in your
life so here's a couple of details about
the car it's 800 horsepower guys has a
thousand torque so this is a very very
powerful car I mean my favorite thing
about the car is just the way it looks
it's the most aggressive car you've ever
seen so yeah not bad at all okay so
before I show you anything else about
the venire I actually want to introduce
you guys that the CEO of W motors this
is Ralph guys he knows way more about
the cars than I do so I thought I'll let
him take you through a couple of the
cool features and the first thing is the
back of the car uh-huh I got to come
check this out veneer has been designed
since 2012 actually okay took us around
six years and it came out this year
you know this year just a month ago was
Wow that's the first video we ever
produced so this is the first one we
ever made the car is world legal so it's
not a concept car it's a production car
I'm happy when I hear legal I'm happy so
it's really a superlight check this out
Wow I was well there you good that is
the veneer all opened up this looks
insane like guys a small touch like this
just adds so much value to the look of
the car but I mean ah it's just nothing
about this car which I can even say out
change so here's one thing really cool
about the veneer they're actually only
making 25 of these per year so they're
gonna limit it to 100 over 4 years which
means this car is gonna be a super super
rare beast to see on the road so if you
see it you better stop to take a photo
now since we are here I know you have
seen this car before but I quickly want
to show you the like and one more time
because this is where it all started so
this is the lykan Hypersport guys this
is a monster of its own only seven of
these have ever been made and yeah this
is the last one they actually have in
the show room so down right now sigan is
jumping in the lichen and apparently
there's something we've never seen
before
this car has a hologram I don't know
what that means I just know it's gonna
look cool oh wow go straight to keep
slides through wait iTunes now that
appears you have all the albums I click
on it almost crazy just to show you what
I mean about this hologram the center
console is empty space if you guys check
out my hand it goes fully inside there's
nothing here and the way you control it
you literally just swipe air guys check
this out what like look my hand is going
in nothing is there guys it's completely
empty this is literally imply how does
it work they're sensors that feel your
hands I told you I'd have to kill you
this is the first car with this hologram
feature this is the first bar and this
was the only technology of exist in the
world that we developed in 2012 and
Tokyo and that is the like and I just
wanted to show you a little bit more
about it guys phenomenal like mind blown
right now
hi guys here goes nothing we are jumping
inside the veneer Wow okay the crazy
thing is the whole inside of this car is
also carbon fiber guys so much so we
wanted to reduce the weight even inside
so compared to the like in where you
have the leather you have the stitching
down Cantara everywhere here it's all
naked carbon fabric everywhere yeah
love box is gone you just have a tray
here we can put your phone oh yeah
there's no there's no like closing
nothing just reduce it as much as
possible this is how the car looks on
the inside honestly my favorite thing is
just this - over here like it just looks
so futuristic I feel like I'm racing
without the car even moving how heavy is
this car cuz it looks really big it's
one thousand three hundred forty
kilograms and it's actually very small
and the car is really small but you
think it's big it looks moving so
aggressive yeah it's actually a very
compact car I think it's just now time
to take it out for a drive can we do
that hmm alright let's go there comes
the monster one of seven in the entire
world right here right look at how
cycads walking to it like you can only
like this is a beauty right here Wow
let's go for a ride
as you can see right now they are
backing this monster up
hi guys so right now I'm actually in a
truck following the video I just wanted
to get some outside shots for you this
car is a monster so we're just trying to
follow her around just to show you how
this on the road this is beautiful oh
I'm so so well you need to push it bro
yeah I did but you know this I don't
think this is an area where you can race
here goes nothing guys right now I'm
about to test drive the veneer let's go
I'm super nervous so hopefully it's all
good and you can do this you can do this
it's just an automatic car you can do it
okay here goes nothing I am inside the
driver's seat guys okay yeah so as I
said this is an 800 horsepower car I'm
super super nervous but sometimes in
life you gotta take some risks
this is the person first one right
there's a first one ever made first one
ever made guys when I'm sitting inside
and driving you're actually one of the
first ever drive it you're the first one
to get the model first on to get the
mono guys I got the toy model right now
one of the first to drive it I might
have a little first girl one of the
streets
Oh F see that's a touchy guy it's all
about feelings when you drive a car
right you have to feel good to drive you
guys and the feeling this car gives you
it's surreal
guys I got scared from the noise in
Maine I was like wait what am i doing it
was like no the car is that loud anyways
we're just chilling over here Wow
everybody literally looks at you and
you're inside this car they've never
seen something like you I've always
that's when I Drive a massive thanks to
rob for letting me try to stir and then
for now it's about time to turn off the
car as cool as it is to drive right now
I'm hopping in the passenger seat so
let's go
that is what a car should sound like I
don't get what the other car companies
are doing you see that noise replicated
yep I know I know
okay the reaction on people's faces I
know I know I know this car is amazing
anyways there you go that has been the
veneer honestly an absolutely amazing
