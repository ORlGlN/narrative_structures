young everyone good morning and welcome
to another vlog so I don't know why it's
actually extremely windy today but right
now they just brought my new shoe
cabinet as you can see outside there so
yes it's finally here so the cabinet is
actually going to go on this wall that I
have over here guys so they're going to
quickly install it over here and we're
good to go
my and there goes the guys so check it
out as you could see my cabinets are
finally done in my room reuse I'm so
happy and now you know what time it is
that means it's time to fill this bad
boy up and I have a lot of shoes guys I
just to show you how many shoes I have
fun anyways here goes nothing as you can
see mommy mode here to help me out so
we're gonna get all of the shoes out of
the boxes and it's time to fill up the
cabinet woo
Wow Wow Wow Wow boys there you go so as
you can see I quickly want to put all my
sneakers in the closet that looks nice
that looks super nice my most expensive
pairs are BAM number one here number two
number three and number four so in case
you guys are ever going to rob me now
you know which ones are worth more well
that was a very nice way to start today
guys laa laa laa yo I was calling you to
come see my sneaker room why are you
watering the plants so comfy yeah let
them die donate one dollar a month to
help my sister smile why so sad I open
your eyes oh oh it's not that's amazing
if you don't pretend to like it more ha
don't worry I have more shoes if you
don't act more happy right now
I surprised I hate you
your feet are really big like literally
the tips are sticking Oh what the hell
are you calling my feet big listen
listen listen
oh why are you questioning my feet
they're normal from the side you're so
big issue you kill yourself anyway the
next mission in my room is to get some
curtains if you can't see that guy's at
the mall my currents are stuck with
cellotape yeah guys listen I couldn't
have the neighbors staring at me anymore
because they keep looking at me when I
change so yeah neighbors man stop
staring high voice oh right now me and
my mom are actually heading out
signe as you saw upstairs I still don't
have proper curtains in my room and you
know what I think it's about time we
went and bought some but first things
first I'm actually out here to turn on
my Mustang as you guys have seen it's
been a long time since I've even turned
this bad boy or look at it it's full of
dust right now it's just oh wow
so yeah I thought I'd at least turn it
on so like the battery doesn't die so
let's try it with the remote the thing
is I know there's a ton of you that are
asking you why haven't you driven your
Mustang in like two months mode the
reason is as I mentioned before I'm not
sure if I want to keep the car or sell
it so I actually haven't insured it yet
so it's not insured I don't even think
I'm allowed to take it on the road
technically so until I decide whether I
want to keep it or not I don't really
want to just pay insurance money because
if I do sell it now go to waste if you
know what I mean so at the moment I'm
still trying to decide if we should keep
this bad boy in the family but I don't
know let me know in the comment section
what you think I should do this because
a lot of people have said yo why don't
you wrap it if you're bored with it and
I actually think that's a pretty good
idea so if I do end up wrapping my
Mustang let me know what color it should
be because honestly if I don't sell it I
want to change something because I you
know I've had this car for like two
years now it's just it's just grown old
if you know what I mean but yeah if you
guys can do me one favor please go and
comment down some colors you think I
should turn this bad boy into but I also
want it to be different like I don't
want it to be something that everybody
has so yes you guys have any designs in
your head or you're like a graphic
designer
hit me up with some really cool designs
and I'll take it into consideration by
the way one more thing before we head
out of here I never knew this but my
rolls-royce also has an umbrella guys
check this out
BAM
oh look at that so check it out boys we
finally made it inside dragon war look
at this rule they have over here this is
insane right look at the size of it
anyways as I said we came here to get me
some curtains because they normally have
some really nice curtains over here look
at this t-shirt they have over here do
you love me are you sure that you love
me if it exists right now you quickly
made it over to the curtain store you
know what I love about these places they
have like a bunch of catalogs as you can
see and they just bring you out one by
one so you can pick through them so as
you can see this is like an example up
on guys I love the way you can actually
feel it like in the book so they have
like a bunch of different samples over
here so yeah not bad at all guys look at
this behind here they have like all of
the curtains Wow behind the currents

current store we got everything dumb boy

come to our house with a bunch of
catalogs and size everything up so yeah

quickly came over to this cooking store

the most insane gadgets ever guys look

thing you literally put a bottle upside
down and it works as a water dispenser

Dubai plate numbers are like super
important I guess I don't I don't know

valuable here so like one digit plate

dollars and etc don't worry I didn't
spend nine million dollars or anywhere
near that amount but I mean it's it's a
decent stepping-stone for me at least
