morning guys welcome back to another
vlog if you're wondering why I look so
sleepy and I'm starting the vlog in the
bathroom it's because I'm about to go
downstairs and prank my brother so my
mother actually came up with this idea
she saw a video on the internet where a
person takes a banana and injects it
with food coloring and she bought like
two different colors but I thought red
is really like a key characters like
looks like blood so we're gonna inject
like red food coloring in the middle of
a banana so hopefully we're gonna be
pranking more - thinking his banana is
so much I don't mutate it or it looks
disgusting inside so let's go ahead and
do that
my brother is actually editing these
videos in the living room and this is
what my mom bought I don't know where
she found this wait I think she bought
from the pharmacy I had to come upstairs
because my brother keeps going in and
out of the kitchen and he will know what
I said so we're gonna do one test run
and see if it looks like like as a key
I'm disgusting as we can make it look
and then we will do the final one and
take it downstairs this is so scary
guys oh my gosh actual syringe so
alright better watch out for that
Jamie there's food coloring everywhere
a few moments later oh my gosh my face
just was sprayed that is great like I'm
what is the bleeding okay this is
disgusting my hands are dirty
what do you think it is rosemarys or
something no it's blood it's sheep blood
no yeah you're high
we bought it from the butcher she there
they said it was sheep blood they said
people would drink it like for health
benefits sometimes okay snap
it was dripping with the Red Planet

with foil and she kept trying to push it
to me as if I'm not gonna realize this
