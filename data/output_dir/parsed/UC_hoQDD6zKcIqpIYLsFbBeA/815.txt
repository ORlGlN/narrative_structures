we're going to be doing loads of
challenges with this we've seen kids do
some extreme things that we can't even
do so we're going to prove ourselves on
the Block today and go all out let's
begin so the first thing you need to try
is you need to sit down on it and
control yourself
basically your butt needs to be on one
side and your feet need to be on the
other side
good luck I don't know but I want 360
turns with everything above the ground
oh we need faster turns your dice so

challenge we're going to be doing
swegway kick ups no no no no no we're
gonna end up many going to the hospital

battle vomit seriously I can't do this
childish anymore sure this lights would
extreme you know there's a glass table
next year and the floor is really hard
to Protea to break something what you
just hit me nearly wounded I think it
might be 5,000 success because do you

able to do both no I don't know how to
do any of them bubbles stay away from
him
so my sister's gonna try okay yeah you

you're gonna break stuff cuz you're
gonna kick the bull so hard
another two feet first two feet first
oh you can't even do two three what the
hell is okay here's the ball take it
three PS if you're gonna try to
challenge first learn how to ride a
hoverboard yeah okay we get a helping
hand from Jedi young one you can do this

kick off challenge successful yeah okay
now this is the tiebreaker okay
the lost one bubbles is being a retard
in this video he's got a tweak from
outside and he's running around with it
is he a dog why is he going swinging his
mouth you're a cat okay let's play fetch
balls you want fetch oh well you're
about to witness
never been attempted on YouTube ever
before this is the most extreme
hoverboard Challenger ever going to see
so don't try this at home so for the
challenge one person is going to be
wearing this box on their hands sorry no
you need to turn it the other way
because as a whole in it if you're
wondering why this box is like this is
because our cat decided to scratch this
entire box we are also going to have on
the hoverboard and the other person is
going to guide us through this obstacle
course which my sister is going to show
you this is the most intense obstacle
course I've ever seen winner-takes-all
we're going to be blindfolded on a
hoverboard with a stick and we're trying
not to anything and the reason we can
guide the other one without making that
hit anything wins the challenge and the
point system when it takes for less hits
you win the game okay
all right I want to draw a face on it
take it
notnot cheating you have to listen to
exactly what I say okay I get just ah
