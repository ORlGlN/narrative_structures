he has eight years oh there's a ladies
if you get with them you'll buy you two
stuff don't you give you the world
I'll give you nice alright guys so
pretty shitty situation at the moment
basically while we're doing the prank I
think my phone fell on the floor
somewhere and pretty much somebody
actually took it right now so you've
been kind of searching on the street for
it they've taken the phone they've
turned it off guys I'm really ready for
stuff right now like so right now we are
on the way back over to the hotel now
unfortunately as I mentioned my phone
did get stolen right now pretty much I
think during the little scuffle we had
in the prank the phone fell on the floor
I'm not sure but there was a guy in a
blue hoodie right I think he might I'm
not sure I'm not gonna name names but
there was a couple people around that
might think in the phone
okay where do we start where do we start
okay as a prank and then it just went
downhill from there so right now we are
back at the hotel and I'm gonna be
honest with you guys as much as I told
you guys I'm not really sad
I'm very sad right now I'm very sad I'll
try to keep it in right now
hey guys let me explain I think now that
we're back at the hotel I can explain
exactly what happens so pretty much you
guys saw that Adam just pranked me they
did like a little like robbery prank but
somehow that turned into my phone
getting robbed
now it's not their fault don't worry
again now there was a guy around us with
a blue hoodie now if you guys recognize
him report him to the movie I don't know
I'm pretty sure I was him because after
that like he literally took off but
there's a guy rawness of the blue hoodie
and a couple of other guys so it could
have been anybody really but that's what
our guesses I think during that scuffle
my phone fell and he took it now it's
crazy because it was a joke to a half of
their I don't understand how it really
happens yeah like and the thing is guys
I know a lot of people might be thinking
I'm using this for clickbait no dead-ass
my phone just got robbed and I'm so mad
because like I even had a cool picture
with fousey holding the 10 million
plaque and like everything is just gone
and also I know a lot of my friends
watch the vlogs please if there's any
random messages you get I'm pretty sure
the phone is gonna get resell or
whatever but in case I mean you know I
might as well use this moment to let you
know I love you guys and yeah to whoever
does subscribe you will make my day a
little bit better it's just a little bit
better so a so as sad as I am right now
the day is kind of getting a little bit
better cuz right now we just met up with
 a little bit tweeted me and said
they said yo in Mo's last video he
showed you so much love and admiration
such a good guy
you know what else I said somebody else
to me and said Wow
in your videos the way Mo's acting he's
such a nice guy he doesn't act like that
in his videos what that's how it is when
we talked about that well the camera is
different yeah hi guys but the thing is
right now if Uzi and I told him that my
phone got stolen Hey I think he's to
blame I just got here yeah bro but like
if I didn't take the picture yesterday I
wouldn't have taken the phone with me
out dude I was editing your photo and
stuff damn whose is all your fault
you're one of the main reason I'm sad I
had a really nice picture of Lucy with
the diamond play button and I know
that's like the only reason I'm sad it
wasn't because you were in the photo it
was the play button in 37-years when you
earn your own I know you're gonna see my
tattoo removal on my head first that's
where we're going really quick it takes
ten minutes
so right now who sees in there doing his
surgery or whatever you want to say
surgery thing is procedure here we're
literally all watching him this is like
that was Oh

does it hurt
so not to sound evil or anything but
seeing this actually kinda makes me feel
better about today because like I'm
kinda in like pain because my phone got
taken and now I'm seeing in pain
