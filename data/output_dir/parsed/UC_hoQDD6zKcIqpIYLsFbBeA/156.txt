few moments later officially back home
right now oh I'm exhausted right now now
that I'm home I actually taught you guys
about something so I was on Instagram
the other day and a fan page started
posting pictures of me like before I was
a youtuber ok and I literally I mean old
school blogs pictures with most of you
haven't seen it so I thought I'd share
it with you guys right this is me before
I was famous guys Oh guys that's me and
my friend James in London I I know I
know
if you may have not seen me with that
hairstyle but I used to have like a a
Justin Bieber mop thing happened
yo it's currently 3 a.m. by the way just
to let you guys know
don't wake anybody up
you're literally everybody is sleeping
shh shh shh
anyways now that we're back guys I
actually want to show you guys something
oh I actually have a very special
package over there and I'm gonna be
unboxing it sometime this week
basically just know something very very
exciting is now in the family and it's
big and if I don't want to show you guys
I'm trying not to show ever it's super
super awesome ba guys honestly before I
end today's video I actually talked to
you guys about something a little bit
like something I wouldn't normally talk
about him because I feel like it's
something I get criticized for a lot but
I thought you know what sometimes it's
best just to address everything and not
run away from it if you know what I mean
so here's the topic I want to talk to
you guys about alright and I know it's
like the worst person this could ever
come from but I want to talk to you guys
about clickbait or the term clickbait
because a lot of people have their own
meaning spirit and I feel like I have
become like a definition kind of early
now if you don't know what clique mating
means guys it's where like you lie about
what the video is all right so let's say
you bro I bought an elephant but you
bought a dog okay so that's kind of what
link mate is but a lot of people have
different meanings about it and I'm not
gonna get too into depth but let's just
say a lot of times people think that I'm
click baiting all right and I'm not
saying I don't know anything guys
I mean it's arguable I'm gonna get into
that but here's the thing I just want
you guys to enjoy my content
and I feel like a lot of people kind of
don't enjoy it as much because they
think it's click baby or stuff like that
so here's the thing for one month okay
I'm gonna do the one month no clickbait
challenge thing okay basically I want
you guys to vote in the comment section
every day if you think that video is a
clickbait video all right and the reason
I'm doing this is I want to see what you
guys think is clickbait and what I
shouldn't do if that makes sense alright
anyways guys as always I'm a wrap up
today's look here I hope you have
enjoyed honestly guys there is a ton of
exciting things happening this month
that I can't wait to share with you guys
so I'll see you guys tomorrow for
another epic vlog
