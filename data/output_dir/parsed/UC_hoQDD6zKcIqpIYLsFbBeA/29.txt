gonna go and buy a very special pair of
shoes so let's go and let me show you
guys what I'm getting alright okay no
more pretending to be a girl I'm done
I'm sick of this alright
no guys so right now we just made it
over to the mall as I told you guys I'm
actually quickly gonna go buy a very
very special shoe that just came out
guys
but if you're wondering why I'm wearing
a hoodie I forgot to bring a hat and
look at my head guys
so your head I think they saw my hand it
sorry madam I'm undercover right now in
the mall okay so right now we are inside
the mall
this is undercover mode with this blond
hair guys you know honestly I feel like
wearing OD makes more people look at me
like people are looking to see why I'm
wearing OD right now back inside the car
it is time to show you the new shoes I
go okay and they are super super limited
edition so if you guys know anything
about shoes check this out guys
these are a collaboration between
Jordans and Levi's and they are so
limited like guys yo just know I got the
plug so first things first inside the
box look look at this this is how you
know it's limited it's got like a card
showing you that it's like limited
edition and stuff like that so it says
this is between Jordan and Levi's
together fusing the signature style and
premium blah blah blah basically this is
like a certificate for the shoe this is
denim shoes so you know the same
material as your jeans they have put
that on a shoe guys check this out woah
imagine they put jeans on your shoe so
like wow listen the price of these is
like two hundred and fifty dollars okay
that's how much you pay for them online
you can't find them cheaper than like
$700 so this is like an investment piece
it smells so weird it doesn't smell like
a normal shoe guys it smells like I
don't know what it smells like by the
way make sure to follow me on instagram
boom mo underscore vlogs underscore guys
the thing is you guys know I buy so many
shoes that I'm actually gonna be doing a
shoe giveaway on Instagram so stay tuned

guys right now me and my mom quickly
came over to the supermarket basically
the reason we're actually here guys as
sad as it is to say I'm actually going
color my hair back to black guys yeah I
know I know a lot of you guys are gonna
miss this blonde look guys but look at
me like what guys I saw people make
photos of me that looked like Donald
Trump but what I realized why is it that
all the hair colors only have ladies
faces on them my bra is it only women
that are allowed to color their hair
like where is the men like what what
there why do men not have hair colored I
think what Eddie's right now I'm queer
you gonna get some hair coloring as I
said I want to go back to black guys
yeah yeah I think I don't even need to
explain anything like just guys look at
my head like I look like a damn lollipop

about me buying shoes on your feet zebra
coucher off mixed in one by the way I
found your husband today on tinder so
there's there's somebody searching for
you to buy 10 people in Dubai are
searching for you now you got a guy
named Brad that seriously wants to go on
a date with you today's vlog here I just
want to say don't worry to everybody
