must have been sleeping in this exact
bed guide which is crazy to think right
really go to my personal office in this
one so here is the Lobos office guy so
as you can see
hello sir hey so are you what's going on

pardon your own guys on the case you're

so they give preferences off to the
light well I didn't like this I like
bond oh wow that's crazy
look at the view like I'm not sure if
you guys can see that let's quickly put
this to the side you're all the way at
the top of the Atlantis yeah yes I'll
take you out in the living room you've
got the best view I said now we're
moving on to the room which I'm probably
going to be spending my most time at
guys the games room so check it out
they've got like a pool table over here
which is crazy
don't even
you're gonna beat me what is this room
$30,000 that is just command center
right $30,000 night guys Wow Wow welcome

Wow this is like your house where you're
just living room bigger than my house
right now this is a hotel room bigger
than my entire and this is just in the
heart yeah that is absolutely crazy guys
couches probably costs more than my car
we'll just ignore that guys watch 100
inch TV behind me like living this thing
even has a full webcam oh so there's
only two places in all of Dubai where
you can see the shape of the palm for
what it truly is
and that's either from this balcony here
or a helicopter ride from above you
heard it there guys only two ways you
can actually see the whole of the palm
view absolutely crazy view from up here
we're gonna head back inside so you guys
just saw the palms you now we're coming
back to the ocean view you have said
there's the only suite with the two
views
only guests in entire bid lantus that
has the view of both the palm and then
the ocean outside the box so you can
just pick and choose whenever you want
from this suite say where do I want to
look at the palm or the ocean honestly
my suggestion is you need a slide
zipline straight into the ocean but make
a little island over there and just like
zipline it to there we're still walking
around in this sweet guy just never
ending like this is like a penthouse
open to my dog feast feast oh yeah one
