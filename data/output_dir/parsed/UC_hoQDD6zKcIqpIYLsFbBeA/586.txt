the bad boy looks oh windows are all
blacked out oh my god can you guys even

go that is the garage for today my
tinted Mustang and the Porsche they go
really nice together guys so if you guys
were watching yesterday's vlog you know
that I put in a spherical ice I don't
even know what's cool anymore spec ice
cube I put in it ah got it rated but I'm
trying to say is I fill this thing up
with water and I let it freeze and look
at it the war is actually started like
coming out so inside this I have an ice
ball like it's it's literally all ice in
there so let's get it out and see what
it looks like here goes nothing guys
this is absolutely freezing and rocks on
it so just going to put it under some
more and then he should be able to come
out okay at the moment it's way too full
all right come on I feel it come on
oh my god guys
that is what an ice ball looks like is
freezing look at it it looks so awesome
outside I think like this can give me
magical powers I'm going to leave this
right here until my sister gets back I
want to show her it because I think it
looks absolutely fantastic we should do
something really cool and I don't know
what exactly we can do in a huge ice
ball but the possibilities are there we
could do ice bowling I mean it's just
chuck it at something right now is she
heading out because I want to go by and
you
ham right you guys don't know I use like
the canon g7x buy hurt the mark ii is
out now and it's better apparently
apparently it's better so I thought why
not buy it test it out to be honest I'm
not even sure if it's out here in Dubai
yep so let's head out let's go you ready
my ball five-o anyways let's go so the
canon g7x mark ii is not out yet however
I'm getting myself an LED light so
whenever you know time my face can be
lit up properly instead of like dark so
that's the first purchase of today I'm
also thinking about a bigger camera the
problem is I'm not sure if I should hold
it around so I'm going to look around a
bit more for now this is the first
purchase with a guys it's like a phone
but it's like a flashlight that's all it
is like loads of LED lights in here so
yeah I'm gonna grab this and look around
a bit more alright guys so I thought
about it for a very very long time and I
finally got myself a DSLR camera she got
a bunch of stuff to prove the vlogs I
think these cameras are mainly going to
be used for like the indoor mail times
and stuff and they look really good guys
so check it out I got the 70d I was
gonna get the AED but I watch a lot of
review saying like there's no difference
and you might as well just get a 70 P
I'm not sure let me know if I'm wrong
also I just got a bunch of stuff over
here I'm gonna unbox all of this when I
get home hopefully it works out really
good because I saw the quality with the
wide-angle lens it just looks like I'm
videoing from super far away and it
looks super cool anyways I'm gonna take
this bag I'm gonna head out and I need
to actually go get a mic now because I
want to get a really good mic and they
sold out here so I'm gonna go to another
store to find it so I literally bought
everything right now I want the camera I
bought the lens
I've got everything and the only thing
I'm looking around for right now is a
good microphone and because I've already
spent so much I got the best line I'm
not sure if it's the best lens but I got
everything I wanted how I wanted it so
or there are other microphones but I'm
really picky right now so I went to
virgin they didn't have it Canon is sold
out as well so I'm going to try one
store right then hopefully they have it
so I can go home and just fully evolve
my camera equipment another store
another fail guy see everybody is sold
out of microphone Lana just met up with
us
Oh Oh change a fashion trend all of a
sudden no I just better load them on
your camera yeah well I I bought I
bought I bought small white custom it's
enough trust me it's not like a be
enough right it's like it's the size of
a boat it's the size of a phone but it's
like bright as hell Oh
all right now yeah it's actually pretty
late guys like all the stores are
closing oh we just stayed home
yeah it's cuz I've heard like dress
she's praying guys
I had this dress like bra and I thought
let me try it today
finally the proper name for it would
have been body but just keep
international would just say dress for
you guys to you I miss the hackneyed
yeah I think I'm right next to my
brother's car so now my god yeah I just
rest on that side this side to turn it
has been normally Park on the same floor
so we kind of just know where the other
ones get apart and this is super busy
obviously that we change I actually
think this suits lonna really well guys
can actually I think
she actually got this like six months
ago so it's actually not something she's
just bore or anything i I'm saying let's
go through the door guys we're gonna go
get in the car now as I said she's got a
new car
for I don't know how long but still she
she swapped the Porsche and now she's

game with you guys I'm gonna show you
the interior and tomorrow I'll show you
the actual car so then a Nana nanana
Nana okay fine you guys get to see the
car so there you go that is Lana's car
for the day guys and then that's my car
me and Lana are trying to debate if this
is the same Range Rover we had it is a
sport but it looks a little bit
different in my opinion don't you think
like the front it looks I think maybe
this is like a new shape guys anyways
let's go oh wait let me unlock the door

used to have except I think this is full
option like this part is wood and stuff
