Kalifa out of oranges that is one of the
coolest virtually for replicas I've seen

then back to reality guys that thing is
huge
this is something I don't like it just
looks creepy I don't know why I don't
like any sort of bugs and stuff even
though it's a recreation - they start if
that if there was a bug that big you
best believe I'm leaving you guys one of
you is going the bait for that little
blady bird looking thing you see when
they tell you hang around a natural
environment this is what they mean yeah

was nothing I'm not sure if this is a
trap and they're not gonna let us go
