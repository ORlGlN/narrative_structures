good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog so I'm starting today and I'm going
to eat the cake that we made yesterday I
didn't show on yesterday's vlog but it
kinda failed I'm going to show you
exactly why like nothing really felt too
much where that this edge quite a heavy
cake because of the melon tenants in but
let me show you what went wrong with the
cake so you never saw this on video
yesterday but pretty much the M&Ms you
see the color-coding it melted and it
looks kind of disgusting still going to
taste nice but it just looks a bit weird
this is why I mean look what happened to
the M&M side like all the colors melted
and they just went in the jelly but it's
still going to taste super nice just the
visual part is not going to be as nice
on this side but who knows if you want
you can just make that side of the cake
so let's just dig in and start having
some since my mom made the cake could
only be right if she did the cutting so
I want about that much that should be
perfect
and I don't really want to really like
this side of the cake is the really
delicious part so if you're only to make
one side I would recommend making the
chocolate cake the special recipe oh my
god look at it's so perfect like it's
like a biscuit type of thing I'm first
going to do an honest taste tester so
let's see how it tastes I'm going to
start with the jelly side
Jenny tastes like normal Jenny other
thing you could go wrong with Jenny but
this cake side I'm going to really tell
you if it tastes good today
all right I'm outside and about to put
the trash in the bin but look how nicely
my sister has parked that half the day
now we're leaving to go eat we're gonna
be with some family friends so I'm not
sure exactly how I'm gonna vlog because
a lot of them don't really like to be in
the vlog so it might be a bit of a
struggle the cooks might not be as tidy
as normally you got this little kid
outside we just fed them today I'm still
trying to making friends with bubbles so
it's go time my sister's waiting in the
car
unless you see how the day goes okay so
I'm not sure if you can tell by the
parking but we're back to our same spot
in jbr we've come out to eat here
because it's Thursday here and that's
like when the weekend starts so if
you're in UK it's pretty much like a
Friday in UK and it's super busy
everywhere else and this place was
closed to us so that's why we came so
yeah let's go eat and have some fun
I just wanted to show you this really
cool Nissan GTR it's a police car it's
super nice thanks a lot thank you and I
asked the guy if I could take a photo
and he was like yeah sure so yeah that's
a really nice car and that's the by
police tree guys there he goes super
cool guy could
well that was super cool the officer was
really nice
and yes shout to him I appreciate him
letting me take a video I just wanted to
show you the atmosphere here it looks
really nice and jbr like this is some
middle area they have like a little I
don't know what it is a slice and design
to the water
it's got like a cool little tree plus
also happy that I got a video for you
guys to show the like amazing supercars
that some police officers have but yeah
and they can see us even like people
going on these things it's a really nice
area that's why we always come here to
eat all right this is another area they
have with more restaurants and even
cooler designs as like trees a water
kind of pond and look at the huge
buildings in the background yeah super
nice but I think my sister going to a
restaurant now so I'm gonna go and eat
all right so we're in the restaurant
right now eating it I really like what
the cokes are in bowls which is super
cool name and have like these lemon
things I'm not too sure if it's right
here we're gonna eat and then leave and
it's super cool like I'm still so
excited so the super cars to be some car
you got to seen it that's definitely
gonna be the thumbnail to do
gals are super awesome so yeah the
ceiling looks super cool Nate let me try
and look at that so while we're waiting
for our food to get ready me and my mom
decided to head out and just video a bit
of the jbr walk it's a super nice place
and obviously we're her friends and
family I didn't want to make it awkward
for them vlogging too much so yeah me
and my mom just headed out the lick at
the walk like the buildings are nice
enough but the beaches on that side I'm
just going to try and walk over but I
don't know if you can see it you can see
them yeah you can kind of see it's there
but let's just walk a bit closer so I
can properly show you here's the beach
guys and look over there I'm not too
short that is I think it might be
Atlantis actually no it can't be
no I don't think it is but it's really
nice building let's try and zoom in and
see what it is but here is more of the
views guys look how nice that is moving
my mom are going to start heading back
now we just came on a nice little walk
and yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed it I
just head back I think our food should
be ready oh yeah one last shot before we
go I don't think I mentioned this today
when I ate the cake if you guys still
haven't made the cake that me and my mom
made and you're planning on making on
another day our device just don't put
some more T's for M&Ms I don't think
it's that great and it kind of just
ruined the taste being completely honest
the restaurant we're eating at is called
Greek eat no eat Greek eat Greek I think
I'm not too sure it like a Greek
restaurant
yeah it's equi it's right over there I
don't know why I came over here there
you go that's the name of the restaurant
my meal got here I just want to show you
what it is
came to this it's like some chicken on a
stick with some homemade fries which are
like these circle shapes of a fool
on your Cheerios result I go for it okay
and my friend also came as you can see
well actually our only orders better
than a suit because I don't really eat
much I'm gonna be sharing with my mom
Greek salad and this is B
