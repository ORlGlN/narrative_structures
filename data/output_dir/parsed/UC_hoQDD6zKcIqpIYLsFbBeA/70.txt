I said it's kind of hard to see this
crazy guys check out the rain this is CJ

the coolest band ever attire
hey nice he's got an iced out G shot bro
this is insane how do you know give me a
special hey now that we're here I
actually have a story to tell you guys
start streaming gaming okay
yeah guys I just wanted my message come
through but it's a reality now ma'am I
don't need to message through the game
anymore God believe in your dreams I
know happened oh so we are back at the
hotel right now what a crazy crazy day
it has been today we met a lot a lot of
people one person now he met today which
I really wanted to meet was fousey no I
know I know I know there's gonna be so
many comments about him like oh my god I
like him more I hate him or whatever is
a K and the reason I'm talking to you
guys about this is I feel like sometimes
when it comes to youtubers like people
are so judgmental like seriously like
even when it comes to like Jake pool or
Logan pool or whoever is everybody has
their opinions and honestly speaking a
lot of the time it's easy to believe
stuff from like videos people make so
I've seen high people make videos are
all look who sees this or fousey did
this to this guy but honestly when I met
a person who's super nice I could hear
of pranking and the reason I'm saying
this I used to watch him a lot guys so
being able to be him in person
I get an opinion that way was just so
much better if you know what I mean
because often what what are you doing
bro I need to look I'm talking I met one
of my idols bro
bro why are you here without a t-shirt
bro it's freezing I've got my tracksuit
bottoms on everything bro listen I know
you need the girls from my vlogs okay I
know you need the girl viewers but you
can't just walk up with no shirt
oh alright anyways as I'll say guys
honestly when I met any of you was such
a nice guy and like I I can't explain it
guys it's just somebody I used to watch
a lot and I know there's been so much
drama about it so I kind of felt like
bad if you know I mean I'm like yo this
guy's such a nice guy and then when I'm
when I saw him online I just kind of was
like thinking different if you know what
I mean it's so excited I love you guys
so I'm gonna end of today's video here
my teeth are still looking white so hey
I love you guys all and I'll see you
tomorrow
Yolo Yolo a few moments later guys rest
in peace case that means no more vlogs
coming out for a one-week really well
you know what that means
tomorrow I need to go and buy a new
laptop guys
