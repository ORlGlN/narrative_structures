one I want this is ah let's see this

this is coffee Beijing but a scientific
way to do it behind you there's a
periodic table it's definitely is
scientific okay so this is the moment of
truth this is the whole reason I came

touch my army oh my god Oh like you want
me to show you something really cool
they have they have like this really
cool drip concept so basically this is
the code drip unit where the brewing of
the coffee happens basically it takes 8
to 10 hours for the coffee to get brewed
down this pipe and it comes one drop at
a time and this way the coffee comes out
like full of flavor and texture look at
that like one job man one drop at a
diary where something does 8 to 10 hours
