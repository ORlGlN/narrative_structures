three-two-one
so this morning somebody rang the bell
while I was asleep but my sister said
that they left a note on my car so let's
go see if it's still here oh okay it's
not no actually it is just money
straight up all right
Wow that's awesome okay what is this
doll we have this is state of Pakistan
20 and the second one is state of
Pakistan ten there you go pretty pretty
awesome oh that's really cool I expected
there to be like a letter but no just
straight-up cash on the car anyways yeah
yo everyone I never got to introduce
today's look properly I swear I just
woke up and came out to see what was on
my car but look what I'm wearing what
are those I don't know why these are so
comfortable I I know before I'm not even
gonna lie I used to get on to people
with like sandals and socks but she's so
come to any way just go do some quick
shopping in the morning fresh breeze of
air morning air so check this out guys
we just finished our shopping and my mom
had like a pouch er coin and she
actually used it all for the shopping
today like look at that like millions of
coins getting counted out her head oh my
god yo my mom just gave $100 a wander
and like she had a huge concha coins and
the lady was like you could give them
all to us because I think shops like
having the coins because they give out
so many like yeah as soon as she steals
the coin she was like give them to us
I've got 99 problems guys and my mum's
shopping is definitely one of them
because I sure we went all the way out
of our area to the main supermarket and
she forgot the one thing we came up for
which is yogurt do you ever do that like
you come out for one thing and you don't
even get it but on some more recent
hip-hop news have you guys seen
Rihanna's work video I recommend if you
are someone below the age of 18 do not
watch that it was very surprising to me
but
nevertheless I think it's going to
attract a bit of attention Drizzy Drake
I like the song I can't even like here
we go boys aye sir when you watch the
video it's something completely
different like the way it sounds choose
different you know what happened lost
money anyway that's why my mum too long
she was giving out one dirham coins
again everybody wants our change now
what that second us like years to
accumulate these I'm not even gonna flex
on you guys the whole day the reason I
have been vlogging that much is because
as a family we've been like tidying up
the place because well my grandma gets
here if she sees the place is dirty she
will roast us you're like damn hell is
wrong with this house do I see some dust
on the ward
what are you guys filthy here so the
holiday all of us have been like rushing
around trying to tidy up the place my
room is like clean as can be right now
let me go and show you right now before
I even get on to my room guys look at
the corridor like everywhere has been
tidied up like I'm not sure if you
remember all of these boxes which are
now perfectly in this corner used to be
scattered around the place but let's
move on to my room because that's where
the big change is going on I don't know
if you guys remember whenever you saw my
bed it's like an explosion it happened
but look at it right now
perfect like there's nothing on my bed
usually I'd have like millions of pieces
of clothes but now there's just this
sheet which is getting like put into the
cupboard now and this which is obviously
been used to clean up the whole place
anyways there you go so how much we are
tiling right now to make the place look
nice just so she doesn't completely
roast us like damn man you guys what are
you doing out here
look at the sky right now guys I love
when it's like orange you read it just
looks so cool
our house is so messy that there's still
vacuuming up ahead okay I've got a huge
smile on my face right now because
something got delivered to my door like
two hours ago and I just kind of
realized what it is so I'm going to
quickly change up and let's get to
opening it be right back
all right everybody I'm about to unlock
something really really special and I've
been waiting a long time to get this and
I know a lot of you guys have been as
well so let's get straight into this a
lot you probably know what it is by the
box but I am really really excited this
has been like my ultimate dream to get
and it's finally here anyways let's get
straight into the box my heart is
beating my heart being I was like okay
so in this box we should have my 100,000
subscriber lay buns so at the moment Oh
bubble wrap and everything oh my god
I changed Alice
I love the rat by the way so the first
thing I should point out is on the back
of this box they have loads and loads of
pictures of youtubers okay not sure how
well you can see that but okay let's get
to opening this the first thing we're
going to see is the paper
here you go guys congratulations for
hitting 100,000 subscribers is written
on that layer again moment of truth I
hope I'm holding it the correct way
around 3 2 1 oh my god guys

is me because this thing right here has
always been my dream not 1 million
subscribers but 100,000 like has always
been my dream so thank you guys so so

I'm definitely hanging this on my wall I
was a bigger smile on my face it's just
ah alright let's find a place to hang

frame let's take the frame out so I kind
of feel scared oh oh ok that is a thick
cream there you go
