section trying to ask questions about
business everything like it was going
crazy so today sigan actually has a
little surprise for you guys it's gonna
talk to you guys about so basically I
received a lot of questions and a lot of
great ideas at the end of the day I've
also figured that you guys might want to
understand how to evaluate an idea or
how to even come up with ideas so
basically we came up with this idea
which is a show where you have the
opportunity to pitch your ideas to us
and my circle to potential advisers and
investors and get the chance to make
your dream come true
having said that for example a very
simple question which I received is how
do I know if this business will work out
where they actually very simple
questions you can ask yourself it's
actually six simple questions you can
ask yourself I'll tell you more about
that in the channel but in general
basics about business as well like did
you know that even if your company is
profitable
you can go bankrupt these are things I
mean we need to talk about working
capital how do you actually make sure
the company stays afloat and
many other basics you will see why I
have to drive them hey guys if you guys
want to know more for now we're gonna go
discuss it a bit more

little houses oh okay this is the king
bedroom they didn't want these Loveman
whoa look at that it's actually pretty
complicated
are they locked it was a nerd
that's the same that's the same so we
just made it over to the project itself
guys look at that Wow
as you can see they're starting building
some palaces over there and Wow this is
literally in the middle of the ocean
guys that's cool right not too bad so
we're here in the middle of the ocean
hanging which one is yours not the one
you're getting oh it's a bit far oh damn
I destroyed that wow there's the
floating sea that is the floating
seahorse guys so as you can see it's
literally just standing in the ocean by
itself let's go check this thing out
guys welcome home it literally did look
like the photos you have your own little
house on the water I think I'm gonna buy
right oh wow look at this in the middle
the ocean oh it's something like this we
should see the the bedroom the bedroom
oh yeah let's go to the bedroom guys
that's crazy you have a tanning bed
right above the war god damn this place
is crazy
I mean it will be all that Wow
and then this is your view how many how
many and all the protein seahorses is
131 floating seahorse and they're all so
it's like we have for some in finding
availability for eight units this is
where you go testing the property you
want to buy you're like should I step on
it should I have to you can't buy
something without testing it oh that is
your swimming pool Wow oh my god this is
the bedroom okay
that is crazy
nice aquarium a nice little area waking
up to the fishes and funny look at this
wow I could get used to this lifestyle
beautiful actually something you don't
see every day
nice you can actually close the blinds
no that is so cool to show the best part
that is crazy love a fish it's like when
you wake up and you want to see the
fishing that is where you go
wholesomeness there's literally a diver
now so this is the bathroom
wow that is great oh my god you're
taking a bath of the fish Wow I is eight
left eNOS ain't left let me see if I can
get the last one minutes until
everything something you see through
look good
this was sealing room shower I'm done
guys I am literally done I think I've
seen the walls down
that's it this this was the last thing I
needed to see in my life a bath from
underwear by the issue is not the coming
here it takes too long you could
actually fly here
really there's no helicopter town so you
can build your own helicopter pad to fly
here where so it doesn't take that long
the bathroom on the roof the pallet is
always a solution for something like wow
there you go guys problem solution the
business mindset that's what's up
doesn't mean I would do it I'm just
saying it's possible I guess a moment of
truth we're gonna fly the drone now
let's see what's up rest in peace
oh my god oh it's dark
hey so won't come back oh the winds
pushing it away but it's slowly coming
down yes it landed on the island yes yes
oh look at this boy that is the blue
control right now how we gonna get lucky
could be able to go thank you very we
get it can we get there yeah now it's
just luck there for the person anyways
guys for now we have to go get the drum
but before we go I actually thought it
mention what the show is good we never
did it's good startup hero and the idea
of the show is we want to hear your
business ideas there's actually gonna be
a YouTube channel that's the one you
have to subscribe to to enter they give
away for the fly out here to de vie and
it's actually sigan investing in your
business ideas as well as giving your
businesses exposure and everything's
like basically leading you to success
the same way this drone just landed
right oh you guys this one laying right
there right on for it anyways let's go
get that thing because it's literally 20
centimetres away from shore that was a
close cool guys that's where you could
drone recovery right there catching the
drone for us as you can see guys that's
the boat that's the drone that little
thing ever there's a drone yeah buddy
yeah you got it okay for now we're
heading as you can see guys awesome
little house over here we got the drone
it's alive now we just need to make sure
go here functional was a hero our champ
got it for us went and got in and tore
his pants while I was in the crosses now
sorry I'm sorry about that
you know what I thought it was a bad
deal but they guarantee you eight
percent return you can stay there two
weeks in a year if you want and they
rent out the rest yeah we just found
that out it's actually not bad I think
I'm just a little bit late on this I got
it all in my pocket
we just made over to the mall as you can
see the starlit roof is a bit more
visible over here we're just going to
quickly go eat and prequel date
time to grub so we just came over here
to eat
and we wanted to taught you guys a
little bit more about this startup hero
channel so it's gonna be crazy is going
to be crazy but the thing what I told
you guys about is the actual evaluation
of your ideas because the main reason
for this show is to turn your ideas into
businesses man site didn't himself why
she invests so we're gonna take us
through what you need to actually think
about before you submit okay so didn't
attend again how do we do it so you were
saying you're talking about the idea of
value yeah so we're gonna talk about all
these things in my channel anyway but
what I would like to see and I think
it's going to help you not waste time
when you when you're talking about an
idea is to answer these six questions
first of all the thing I hinted that are
you solving a problem if you're solving
a problem which problem are you solving
is I hope right now it's a hundred yeah
now right now it's nothing there's my
restaurants work so that when you're
actually solving a problem and not your
own problem should be a massive problem
right yeah we usually talk if you want
to get investing in invention capital
style should be billion-dollar market a
100 million dollar company for 10
you have 10% of the market basically can
be attractive in our form
oh yeah but I mean it doesn't have to be
there enough for smaller businesses so
solve a problem
second one is ask yourself if you can
profitably scale that business how big
can that's become and then how much does
it cost you to actually make it big so
basically we refer to the customer
acquisition Toby
you can also call it the monetization
strength so if you do that you basically
know okay how profitable this business
can be and how easily at one point of
time you can make money without actually
having to require a high cost every
single d-unit I go in it
I read attachment about this do you
really want to build this business
because if you are not you're not really
gonna be successful I state this at the
right timing is also another very
important thing right too early is as
bad as being too late so you need to be
right on time for better you last but
not me
is this idea actually legal are they
official stats that should be number one
battery number one is it legal and I'll
tell you why it's not number one because
think about the very successful business
idea
uber for instance right uber was illegal
in many countries but they're so
successful because it
and wanting it so while laws actually
change it you know if driving cars was
illegal back then because it was scaring
off horses Wow was actually changed so
at the end of you literally have to stop
your car cover it when a horse pasture
back wild laws can change for great
ideas I wouldn't bet on it because it
takes a long time yeah but generally
it's not the first thing you ask
yourself Wow there you have it boys
so like in the elk in the Yeltsin or
y'all go to the Elgin y'all to make sure
it's a good idea and make sure it's
legal awesome day for now we're heading
back in the Rolls Royce let's go whoo
dad let's press the door paparazzi
paparazzi that never gets oh man it's
never a vlog without karaoke in the car
