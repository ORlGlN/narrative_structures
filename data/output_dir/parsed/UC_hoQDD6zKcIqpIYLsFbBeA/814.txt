kitty you tired yeah come on say
something to us okay I'll leave her
alone actually the only thing that's not
normal behavior for kitty is actually
being outside where she's gotten used to
nowadays Richard this is the problem
when you leave Kia bubbles out at night
they are actually hiding in there look

Ghost Hunters in here come out guys how

and go back in go back in hey kiddies
back inside bubbles bubbles go out
inside yeah good boy no no no no no no
no mom lazy okay finally we got bubbles
very good huh this is what I mean they
are hard to deal with old money so guys
I'm out with Linda again today and there
is actually a plan basically so the
other day you guys are so helpful in the
comment section to me when I asked about
used cars and I want to thank you so
much now we will let you know where I'm
at today before we go out so we're going
to go out and look at some used cars but
I highly doubt I can find anything now
you guys know the used card I really
wanted with the Nissan GTR full all
right yeah or the re but the re is like
just to see air which is I and the
Nissan GTR which I really like that's
like the main one I wanted it's kind of
too expensive for the like the DeSimone
like the 2009 or in my price range but
after reading your comments you guys are
like normal that's too old and it's just
the first model when you should probably
get near one so I'm going to take a look
anyways I'm gonna try I'm not giving up
but saying that I really think that the
car I might be getting is the end of the
month of bored Mustang when it comes so
based on that let's just go see what's
up outside in the showrooms and yeah
just have a great day here you go a nice
and wet Lamborghini was is the worst it
because she wants to take you out you
first actually come into Chevrolet now a
lot of you have been asking me more
check out the Chevrolets
and stuff like that so I'm going to take
a look honestly that's all I came here
for to take a look and see what's up
over here so the first one you guys have
been like killing me about is the Camaro
and I think this is it
yes hot offer asks for details
you reckon because of the shopping
divide shopping vessel they have these
offers mostly hot offers yeah okay
I'm gonna ask anyways I'm just curious
that's why but to be honest I'm gonna to
tell you my honest opinion I don't like
this as much as the Mustang I don't like
this yeah I don't like it is what I'm
telling you on the inside it's so simple
there's no touchscreen irony product
that middle part but it's honest
maybe she's preference also I'm going to
ask about that Corvette that is the one
that I would really like but it doesn't
have back seats I choose a green I'd
pick up over the rig up if I was going
to get a Camaro I'd get it this color is
this like super slow look at the engine
supercharged
supercharged ok Linden's back with his
like I don't know why Linden loves these
like huge cars like that Wow ok we'll
give it the attraction future the
Corvette Stingray starts from 290
thousand dirhams it's open right are you
in and I have to figure out how to open
this thank you yeah ok this thing keeps
opening from inside it's a bar okay this
is like robbing a car no long ago really
I kid you actually leave it ok anyways
yeah this is this Corvette Stingray the
inside looks beautiful
it actually does not have any back
sheets now this starts from 290 but I
love it
ya know this car is like a sports car
it's like a really nice sports car
American Muscle and that type of stuff
and the supercharged Camaro that starts
from 255 actually no I think that's just
255 that's the only model they have not
bad actually it's really nice
ok let's see if this one opens ok
anyways that's nice yeah it's nice
because it's black and black rings I
think we're done at Corvette to be
honest the thing I like over here is
this and the Camaro supercharged but
they're too expensive
anyways and brand new so let's just head
out and to be honest I prefer the
Mustang over the Camaro I don't know
it's just a preference thing so let's
just head out and go to Nissan cuz I
want to check that out really badly for
the yeast cars the troll is one of
Linda's favorite God but you know what I
do see
I see a bit of money over there anyways
let's go inside nice and so we're next
to a brand new GTR at the moment I'm
just taking a look at it
brand new four hundred and twenty five
thousand dirhams it's a bit too much
obviously okay so I'm guessing this is
open like the okay it has like a Lambo
open door and it's not open okay great I
mean even the back of this car looks
really really nice that's the thing I
like about it the back I'm gonna go ask
about the approve use ones because I
don't see any out here so I'll be right
back and let you know what they're
saying I don't think they'll be in my
price range so I just had a talk with
the certified pre-owned people now they
said it's very very rare on their half
to get one just because not too many
people bring you in but you said for the
price range I'm looking at I'm not
looking anything above two thousand nine
and that is my only issue at the moment
2009 seems very very old so I'm not sure
and 2016 brand new is super expensive or
anything about 2010 gets so expensive I
don't know why it's like they actually
keep their value quite a bit so
I love this car so much but yeah it's
too much it's too much anyways let's go
see Lyndon oh he's over here that's a
350 said that's that's actually yeah so
they have the 350z open but not the GTR
I'm gonna kick off guys alright we're
gonna leave the GTR right here as it is
and move on Lyndon one day it's even got
like look at this carbon fiber oh oh
it's so nice ok let's go let's go no
point just admiring the car anymore no
point I don't think I can get it if
anyone wants to give me a car for my
birthday yeah if anyone was to give me a
car I'd love to even actually I might
like try and see if I can meet up with
Tom I just make like a really nice video
there who knows I've never had so many
dreams shattered in one car like
showroom look haha
Yamaha was right next to us and I'm just
here to look not even planning on buying
this but I'm gonna be honest with you
guys I'm that type of person I'd prefer
a bike over a car if my family allowed
it and they don't and look at this look
at this oh my god I love bikes I
seriously love bikes unfortunately my
family won't let me have one because
they're like it's too dangerous under no
circumstance can I have one I just love
that so much
sports bikes those sports bike if you're
someone that likes quad bikes just as
much as me like there you go special
edition Raptor 700cc my boys yeah I know
it looks like yo can we show on it I'm
not even sure if I'm allowed to your
friend at this dude the only problem is
if I do get like a Mustang or a GTR you
can't can you actually carry this on the
back of the
DT are always that benefit in science
better the back like have like it I
don't know I don't know that's the thing
I I know you have to have a four-wheel
drive to have jet skis I don't have to
do all years whatever total a tow hook
can we add a total to GTR Mustang we're
a little bit yeah I'll probably be so
weird and then checking out this little

grabby oh my god the music nowadays is

what time is guess what I wish guys it's

thing I said like next day it was like

something else
Oh Luther is leaving in three days guys
anyways for now lifted out we can walk
out together
let's go cat let's go to the car I swear
my Jeep is gonna feel so slow nothing
going alright DP its sorry the Jeep eats
up love - is it really it's rimming oh
oh no it's raining I don't want to try
and Hawai what's the difference a dream
people crazy with people are crazy what
is right where okay what is this rain
thing who invented it before I in
today's law I kind of want to tell you
what's going on in my head and maybe you
guys can help towards what I'm thinking
now today obviously I went and looked at
some cars now the Nissan GTR was why I
had my eye on the whole time now after
looking at it and discussing it with
Lyndon my mom and sister they told me
they reckon it's not the best idea and
I'll tell you why so if you don't know
the Nissan GTR is in my price range are
actually 2009 GTRs now if you think
about it that's a 7 year old car and
you're probably going to run into
problems not saying that there was
already problems with the car but it's
an old car you're more bound to have
like problems occur because it's an
older car obviously and that's what I
want to know I'm really at this moment
I'm kind of put off it honestly I love
the car like if it was just up to me and
no one gave me input I would probably go
for it and it could be a big mistake I'm
not saying it wouldn't be because I
really do think it might be a big
mistake if I do it but it's such a
beautiful car and I don't know I'm like
really is it gonna
that many problems type of thing anyways
at the current moment the situation is
probably going to end up like this if I
can't find any other car by the end of
this month I'm probably just going to go
with the Mustangs that come in the 2016
batch anyways and if I don't then it's
going to be whatever I find in this
month so at the moment it's just like a
tick tick tick until the deadline which
is the end of the month and I told you
if I can't find anything else I'll
probably go for the Mustang and if I do
find anything else on the way then I'll
get that instead if I that's if I like
it not obviously not anything else I
find on the way so yeah let me know what
your thoughts are you reckon 2009 is
good or if you reckon it's bad because
at this moment people are telling me is
really old and I don't think it'd be a
good idea but kind of stubborn I love
the car I love the car I think it's just
not meant to be because I think I'm
trying to force it
so anyways comment down below let me
know your thoughts you guys are always
super helpful and I'll see you guys with
another vlog Yolo Yolo I'm out
