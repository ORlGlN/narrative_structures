hi guys what is a mode here welcome to
another video now quick disclaimer to
all of my subscribers this is not one of
my regular vlogs this is a response
video to three divides video and the
reason I'm making this is because it was
on a topic I could relate to so for you
guys who don't know who pewdiepie is or
I've not watch this video pretty much
what happened it is a couple of days ago
figures of how much he made in 2014 were
released on the internet and everyone
went berserk because they didn't think
he deserved them how money he made or it
was just ridiculous to them how a
youtuber could make so much at etc now
before I get to the topic I want to say
congratulations to PewDiePie and I
believe that everything he made he
deserves and people should not be giving
a paper on it alright so the reason I'm
making this video is if you guys don't
know me or watch my videos basically I
make a lot of videos with my sister's
car which is a Lamborghini here's a
photo of it and pretty much in most of
these videos I get a love/hate just for
people glassing the saz bridge spoil I
was really weird to me is the fact that
people judge you based on how much you
make even though you're the same person
without the money now a topic that
PewDiePie came across on his video was
that
how when he started YouTube you don't
have anything and he was making hot dogs
and he worked his way up and never
thought about the money and I completely
agree with that for example a lot of
people ask me why I make youtube videos
and the reason is I enjoy making the
videos there's a lot of things I can do
to make more money than YouTube but I
think should always do something you
enjoy
that day if you make money even if it's
less than doing something else if it's
something you enjoy you're just going to
continue doing and have fun with it so I
don't want to make this whole video
negative so I'm just going to wrap up a
couple more points and end it here
PewDiePie mentioned that money did not
make him happy and what made him happy
was just doing what he loved and when
the money came that was just a bonus I
completely agree with that and I want to
tell you guys watching this video always
follow what you enjoy don't do something
just because the money I could have
easily chosen to go into training or
stuff like that which everybody knows
you can make loads in but I'm doing
YouTube because I really enjoy it and
it's my passion so if you're out there
it's all watching this video just stick
to what you enjoy even though there
might be something that you hate which
has loads of money because at the end of
the day that's not going to bring you
happiness alright so that is Dennis
video guys I didn't want to ramble on
about anything else too much I just
wanted to say leave the guy alone he
made his money he does what he loves and
that's pretty much it hopefully you
enjoyed the video and I'll see you guys
later but bye guys peace
