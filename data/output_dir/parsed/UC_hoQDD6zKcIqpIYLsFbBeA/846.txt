good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog so we're heading off to the
hospital saw our family are there it's
not too serious don't worry we're just
gonna go check up on them and say hi and
stuff like that so by the way we put so
many snacks like Pringles and chocolate
because a Halloween that we had to bring
loads into the Carlat we've got like a
little fridge in the middle of the car
yeah is it's cold it's cold feel it but
actually no it's not it's not really
cold still it oh you just turned it on
yet it's green now so yeah we got a
little fridge we're gonna put loads of
snacks in the car now for whoever wants
some because when you're out you feel
more hungry than you were at home should
do oh my god she's driving and eating
Wow
obesity nobody on TV shows birth so
funny story recently me and my sister
kept on getting like messages and
comments and tweets and everything
saying you guys are on TV and we're like
really basically what happened is a TV
show I knows who like insiders edition
or something they put a clip of me and
my sister do karaoke in the car on TV it
wasn't good I wanted to tell you guys
something about myself today I don't
really do that you guys know
No okay anyways as I was saying before
this song I put in the videos and I've
got her hooked on it so you guys always
ask me where I'm from and besides from
that a lot of you just generally write
where you think I'm from Seoul today I'm
kind of gonna give a little bit away but
not nearly as much as you think so purse
a case can you stop breaking I hate you
I hate you you break really weird die
she keeps on breaking in my head keeps
going back so the way I class where
someone's from is now please stop it's
so annoying it's three things where
you're born where you've lived and where
your parents are from so then three
things so there you got them three
fingers about where you're born where
you've lived where your parents are from
so today I'm giving away one of them and
I'll be giving away more in other videos
so and the only reason I'm saying this
is because the place we're going now is
actually where I was born so there you
go I was born in Dubai you were born
here is where we were born we were both
born in the same hospital and that's
exactly where we're going to see our
family today so yet hopefully you like
that bit of information now there's a
lot more to it
so keep guessing in the comment section
if you want so if you do enjoy me
telling you a bit about myself smash the
like button and yeah that's the first
key to the puzzle you want the orange
Smarties how am I gonna separate mini
orange Smarties go tiny look okay by the
way I don't think I mentioned but this
was the hospital we were born in it's
good Latifa hospital but when we were
born here it was actually good our Wasel
hospital and yet they've completely
changed it it's extremely hot today like
I mean hot brand if you like I know I
was watching a video yeah and so I was
complaining about a little bit of heat
you should be happy when something is
hot I really like the weather but it's
just a bit on the radial side today Oh
swag
then it
thug life your your squad power stuck in
traffic
Oh yo ye look at that red call it the
red car you the pseudo Oh
the back you saw y'all come with us guys
join the back before you my sisters we
proclaiming so much there you go back
let me show you something really
exciting BAM okay so you guys remember I
told you to set me in cool designs for
shirts a lot of you have done that I
picked these two at random lame print
them out so you can see them a bit
better just give me a second okay they
should be printing now let's go upstairs
and get them okay here they come
is that one wallah nice before I start
talking about the designs I want to say
thank you to everybody who has been
sending me designs I just picked these
out because they were the first thing I
saw my email right now and they looked
awesome so getting onto the designs a
lot of you have been signing me things
really similar to this as well and yeah
I really like this thing so the fingers
a three finger thing I do you know the
Yolo Yolo the win love victory sign that
looks awesome now I definitely want to
implicate that into my design but
something I would say on a change about
these designs even though they look
really awesome I never mentioned this
and I forgot to do I really want a
generic design something that's not too
specific so mo blogs would be a bit too
specific I think maybe your squad could
be something I could put but let's see
if we can find designs that like for
example just one wearing right now it's
just a random design anyone can wear and
it's not really specific so I'm gonna
try I'll show you I mean by this again
well like one really pathetic attempt
it's nowhere near as good as these shout
out to re I think that's a guy who sent
me them I'm not too sure I could just be
saying around me but I mean is maybe
something like this is really bad I know
don't judge me but BAM you can see it's
really simple three fingers and a circle
and that
can be like a little logo on the side
and stuff like that so if you guys can
please send me stuff like that very
generic ones but look really cool at the
same time I'd appreciate a lot and yeah
we're getting there we are getting there
but yeah thanks a lot for these awesome
designs on icy designs like this style I
kind of relate it to me it kind of
excites me I know for the future like
things that you could possibly do
imagine like loads of people wearing a
shirt and like representing the squad
you know it's just really exciting so
hopefully we can do that in the future
and there's loads of things to come with
it so we need to go find someone that
makes good quality shirts people can
ship it send it off safely ah it's gonna
be a big big thing but hopefully it
works out at the end and yeah we will
have the yo-yo squad Jana Yolo clothing
range zone sound that's the weirdest way
of saying soon flex on them real quick
shoe game strong okay I told you were
hungry or I wanted to tell you anyways
so it's time to go eat right right right
right yeah some I'm just really tired
today so I'm letting Maul take over
actually it's not my mistake oh I meant
like I'm not doing much because I'm
already tired
job has been holding the camera on him
the entire time we're finally here it's
the same place we came the other day
it's got a pretty nice area they've got
like seeing outside for like Casta in
KFC so you know you can just relax and
heat something we were originally going
to have some Musa but nowhere is going
to sell it here so it's either Kosta or
KFC I think we're going to try and cheat
the system we're going to see if we can
get some juices from inside get them
heated up and then come sit outside and
have our tea acosta let's see light pack
we just asked the bakery no samosas no
some muscles apparently my sister's just
going to put the sambusa to the side and
get something else since they don't have
any this is the selection you have some
sir oh you do oh is it cheese inside it
not much to worry
one chocolate donut please
totally cheating right now we're in KFC
she's got loads of food from outside she
is allowed to be in here but you know
what do you see here
like some sausage relief of the
I guess your pizza but she's not eating
until I can't come because she's so
embarrassed this is the problem with my
mom
sister always ends up stealing it she
went food great even though she's not
supposed to and still ended up saving my
mother's KFC
okay we're going to eat and I'll see you
off of this here comes the illegal food
dot-dot-dot
da da da and she just walked right
Wow you joined the dark side and he
joined the dark side him
dear notice you I think I made a huge
mistake with eating spicy fries my
tongue is burning so badly it's like
dying okay we're gonna head off home we
just came late night to have like a bit
of a snack
you don't realize I can't read it is
like it's actually burning like
physically burning alright I need to go
have some more I knew I shouldn't have
put my drink wait
job war
it's called into reading wall
the spicy fries
I don't know you monster I don't know
how to break the news to you guys but
something kind of serious is happening
in the blogs it's something very serious
and you guys I don't think we've been
through something like this ever in the
blogging way how we know we haven't
really have it so today is the last day
that Lana's gonna be blonde that's it
guys she's changing her hair color she's
not going to be the same person from
tomorrow and yeah I guess we lost a big
part of the YouTube channel but I know
it's true thank you but you guys can
have a moment to look but uh Nazir's
know make sure to check it out I'm not
sure how it's gonna turn out tomorrow
I'm going to tell you the exact color
cuz you asked her guest you ask from
guessing the conversation you've
probably noticed she has a very similar
color on her Instagram but that's it she
could have joined the normal hair color
family kayaking oh she's not ready but
she's gonna become much closer to the
blog because you can't really go liar
and a blonde can you you have to go
darkest so yeah I know I know how you
got okay
guys stop stop crying I know you're
crying at home realize no no it's right
it's all right trust me it's gonna be
fine it's gonna be fine the Barneses
though make sure to come back tomorrow
let's all see how it turns out I'm not
sure because normally with my sister
cutters her hair I remember the first
time she went red or like yes you can go
red once I was like I hate this color
and then eventually I kind of just grew
into it like it's not bad you know so
yeah let's see how it turns out tomorrow
I know there's gonna be loads of people
like no no that's how a lot of people
were on Instagram when she posted it but
I think you'll turn out
two bills I think I prefer darker colors
more so yeah butcha guys more in our
vlog yah yah no good bye
