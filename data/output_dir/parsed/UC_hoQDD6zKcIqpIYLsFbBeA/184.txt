anyways welcome back to another vlog so
today is actually a sad day guys
yes it's my last day in Spain but I'm
super happy to be going back to the bye
guys
I missed the family I missed the cars
and everything like that right now we're
actually heading out of the hotel guys
everything is packed and yeah it's time
to say goodbye to Spain goodbye Spain
goodbye people goodbye
again the safe is empty I think we're
good to go
okay coast is clear
good morning hi so the first stop of the
day for us is actually over at the kebab
restaurant the thing is we've had no
breakfast that well guys so right now
we're just having some food over here I
go online
the kebab here is on point by it's super
super nice and I love the fact that they
give you glass bottles guys Cheers what
are some good crap so right now he
quickly came over to the supermarket and
they have one thousand gram Nutella like
this thing is insanely large for a
Nutella jar Marco
crazy alright so right now we're trying
to find a special type of cereal they
only have in Spain bro look at this city
unless con CAC or oh my god they should
fill up a box full of them I know right
not yo so we've come to buy some water
guys yes water and they have glass
mineral natural water yeah one thing I
love about Spain they have the coolest
water bottles ever what bro this looks
like some like mad vodka ball yeah and
it's so cheap guys look $1 34 4 3 liters
of water I feel like that's that boring
let's get more bro bro bro chill chill
she lost this why yeah why does all of
their war look like vodka I so right now
we're doing a little bit of water
shopping guys but apparently they like
to put their water in glass vodka balls
yo hi guys so right now we're quickly
going around the streets of Spain for
some last-minute shopping as you can see
I got my vodka in my hand I can
basically retire just do some loss with
a shopping but I think our taxis gonna
be at the hotel very soon so we actually
probably have to go back before you can
buy anything place we've come to right
now is like Oxford Street it's so busy
guys and it's really sunny taxi alright
let's go let's go let's go guys I think
the guys a little bit sad with us
because we can't speak Spanish I don't
think he knows where we're going and we
can't explain it
okay bye guys so right now he clearly
had to come back to the hotel because
our flight is actually right now so the
taxis outside we're actually heading
back to divide but I thought I'd come
back here because the scenery is so nice
in this hotel so for an hour say goodbye
to the hotel and they actually give you
like a bunch of really cool free snacks
guys so I wouldn't mind if I do
all right you know what I'm gonna use
this guy's okay we're gonna take this
before we leave all right okay so for
now we're heading out let's go oh my god

bit so first things first I actually say
a big thank you to youtube for inviting
us all down if you guys didn't know they
actually sponsored this trip yeah
I give up that literally kind of
sponsored it is basically big on us

ticket for me but I ended up paying more
to upgrade to anyways but yeah guys I
just wanna say a big thank you to
youtube for inviting us down it was a
super super cool event and it was even
cooler that we had the whole hotel
anyways I call it light I'm actually
really happy to be going back to Dubai
guys because I have no idea what to do
in this city and
nobody speaks English they look try try
and say something to this guy
mr. Sulu

unless
thank you gosh yes it worked
I'm such a fan all right we're all the
way to the airport right now boys our
flight is in like two three hours but we
are business again so yes you'll by the
way Charlotte's my sister if you guys
don't know when it comes to Emirates the
more you fly you get like these air
miles and my sister never spent hers she
has like a hundred of fifty thousand air
miles so we used her points top grade us
which is pretty damn good cuz it's free
so yeah free of charge guys business to
us
all righty Airport all right thank you
and it's time to go
our boys it's officially time to head
back right now go hold the airport in
spate is actually really cool right
business boss let's go right now we just
finished boarding all of our luggage in
and they said that there's a VIP lounge
here guys so we're trying to find their
will I go to the VIP lounge or like what
alright anyways right now we're just in
the airport going around guys I love the
design of this Airport it looks like
it's made out of wood guys so this is
pretty cool oh yeah but to get to our
location we're actually taking a trade
ball aboard so first stop of the airport
we're getting some coffee guys that is
disgusting down bro your sister take
this out put that in there and we are
good to go this is the moment of truth
the VIP lounge welcome to the VIP lounge
I think that was the quickest visit I've
ever had a VIP lounge in my life guys
there was no food in the lounge
there was nothing except alcohol they
really Spain and really think about a
brother for a second man anyways right
now we're gonna go to Burger King oh my
god religion found the coolest thing
ever in the airport gay they have
vending machines for electronics so this
vending machine actually sells you
GoPros toothbrushes like everything you
could imagine guys look this vending
machine even sells you rode like are you

credit card in we need to buy a drone no

probably the coolest thing about Spain
I've seen so far here you go boys it's
officially time to board the flight
goodbye Spain but now we are officially
heading onto the flight
let's go it was a really really cool
trip guys I don't know why I enjoy
traveling right guys we're gonna miss a
lot of things about Spain or howdy turds
does this turtle have aah what the hell

the way guys look at my french shoes

about his time with shoes so I'm kind of
jealous oh my god

on the flight right now heading back to
the bye
I actually got myself a window seat
which I'm super proud of guys yet all
right sir ah shits on the phone with
Lana and he's trying to convince her
that we missed our flight guys basically
apparently there might be a two-hour
delay because it's foggy in Dubai so
these tragic events are based our flight
because so much no listen listen listen
what happened is even they made it on
time
but then how to do tax refund this event
you do tax refund of 20 euro if you miss
the flight
no flight I did not miss it means oh the
plane is still here they closed the gigs
yeah but they're gonna offload us
pictures of the beach
let's say we have to go catch a flight
or in Georgia which is so bad we somehow
convinced my sister that we missed our
flight star yeah boss anyways the thing
is guys basically the reason we're
actually flying back to the bite today
is because I've actually got the show
schools' Got Talent like tomorrow guys
like the finale so I actually need to be
back for that urgently so yeah that is
why they were panicking on the phone
anyways right now we're on the flight
guys the thing is it's like an
eight-hour flight so I'm probably gonna
sleep most of it so yeah bro cool them
