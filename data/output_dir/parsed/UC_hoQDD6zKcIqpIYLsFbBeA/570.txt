yo everyone good afternoon and welcome
to another vlog so I'm gonna be honest
I'm starting today's vlog off late like
I've just overslept so much and I think
it was cuz the interview yesterday I'm
just I'm just gonna blame that they made
me wake up at 6:00 a.m. I overslept
today but yeah right now I'm heading out
because my boy called me was like your
mole we're out with an Aventador and
Aventador SP in a Ferrari you want to
come join I was like could you say yes I
want to come join so right now heading
over and yeah let's see what's up let's
go
check this out hacks you see a lot of
nice cars out today including a red GTR
over here look at that oh I see the cars
I see them I can't check it out guys
there's my Mustang we have an Aventador
se over there the
why Ferrari so let's go
allowed you in the cars and finally made
it here it's time to go whoops I have to
be honest this beast is just amazing
look at the logo okay it's my first time
driving it this is kind of my first
test-drive of a four five eight probably
hear the Aventadors in the front look at
this view would not mind being stuck in
traffic this loud car guys
I don't know how I'm going away your
summer back there
Ryne our in the slip road guys going
slow now is insane
guys honestly a convertible feels so
nice we're really gonna go change my
Mustang into a rolls-royce Wraith you
know as you do as you doing these little
car beings but yeah man whoa the
Aventador is down another level look at
these guys
oh boy okay this car is quick
this car is quick
okay words cannot describe these guys
check it out this SV looks amazing you
guys don't even realize how gorgeous
this thing looks whoo group it looks
beautiful
and we also have the blue Aventador oh
boy anyways are just about to head out
right now let's go
these cars are crazy on their own like
just the sound alone makes me feel like
I'm wanted in life again I don't even
not to explain it let's go guys but the
Ferrari let's turn on the key and now
time to start the engine
as you can see in front of us guys the
rate that's a people
slow down slow down that's too much
that's too much
I said after driving this car I'm you're
like maybe I shouldn't get one I feel
like it's too much traffic do you think
I honestly feel like I do something the
thing I love about convertibles you can
just stick your hand down the roof
I like BlogPaws like that
yo we were literally this close to
running our fuel on the Ferrari guys
please close now you managed to find a
petrol station so we're pumping this
beast up and then we should be good to
go but just look at it oh oh
this car is on another level guys
anyways you're on the SV lurking in the
shadow over there is that speed you see
that that is a beast of a car that's a
friend you actually by the way guys
brand you and we're taking out today so
well you know I love it says four five
eight spider and then turn the switch
press the button got a nice G wagon in
front of us like a dark purple g wagon
we have a gold one over there as well
look at that well that is a pretty nice
G Wagon guys oh boy let me tell you
something that you see that light on my
face because this car is so low the car
behind me is light reflects in the
mirror into my eyes so it that is a
problem you know this is a banging Drive
today from 86 on see I've got a missed
call from yo-yo it's important
my late night/early late night
guys who remembers this song
music today is kind of weird right now
we're in the downtown area
you know we're going to have a
milk-white to some burgers I don't know
guys we got something to eat
as you can see this cars treat us nicely
today check it out you've gone too far
too far
one more rep
okay no more has no more at number
just got your guy this is
I have to be honest I'll study one of
the craziest rides I've had at the
Ferrari guys so check it out we just
came over to this fresh from guys and if
you guys don't know my favorite star is
actually cheese so we got a lot of it
over here look at that we got cheese we
got bread and some salad okay so check
it out the desert just got here guys and
they have on my favorite desert it's
like this white rice big thing with
lemonade on it check it out it's
actually really really amazing and it
has ice cream and secondly we've got
this huge chocolate cake oh yeah we're
gonna eat here and then it's back to the
four five eight so let's do this by the
way privity they have this thing and
it's like crystal sugar so you just put
it in and then after a while it kind of
dissolves and gives you sweet tea so
that's really really cool so now we're
heading out of this place we had like
huge dinner roof is going back down
because you know you can't have a
convertible without taking the root ball
this car definitely suits me this is why
you need to like just test drive some
cars guys like whoa the same in a test
there's no test this is a full on race
there's a full range guys we just hit
the red light you already know what's up
