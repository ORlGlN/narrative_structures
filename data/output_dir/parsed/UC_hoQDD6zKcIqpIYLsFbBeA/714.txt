source starting today off in my car
I've actually got something really cool
planned out today and you probably
already know by the title we're actually
gonna go see my friend and have a ride
in his 1200 horsepower Nissan GTR I'm
running out of breath saying that just
cuz I'm getting really really nervous
even thinking about this I finally got
my GoPro mount like working now okay so
I'm trying to use this for the recording
because I'm sure even though I might be
holding a camera it's gonna be like
wobbly as hell in there so hopefully I
can get this attached onto the
windscreen for like a more stable shot
and yeah if I cry don't judge me don't
judge me but right now I was away from
my mom she's in the grocery stores right
now over there just buying you now
groceries and then we should be heading
out to see my friend so let's go and it
should be an awesome day
oh my god okay so as you can see behind
me guys I finally made it over to my
friend and this is his Nissan gt-r 1200
horse powers of absolute beast car this
is my favorite car in the world guys and
this specific one has so much power that
I just fall in love with it so mom is
gonna tell us a bit more about the car
and show what's under the hood I love
the details he's gone for so he's
changed the bonnet to old carbon fiber
and yeah let's see what's running this
car hey guys first of all this is a GTR

it's a 1,200 horsepower yeah I call AMS
they do this crazy insane supplement
so we're just going to quickly pop the
hood so you can see what's under there
but this car just a beast even look at
the wing on it just absolutely
magnificent but yeah this is the moment
that all your car lovers have been
waiting for wow wow wow now if you can
see there guys those are the injectors
correct and lonely there's six but this
car has 12 injectors which is double and
I'll let Mahmoud say more about it

Wow okay crazy crazy thing let's go for
a ride but before we do let me just
quickly show you the interior of this
thing so now you can you open up the
door and bam Nissan GTR interior not bad
at all

launch control in this car and if you
guys know anything about GTR just get
ready for a great ride but let me show
you all the screens and stuff in this
car cuz it's just absolutely insane the
mom's gonna tell us a bit more about it
this one is like factory ones and this
one at the external one okay actually
this is reading from the I have a
computer called psychics yeah you know
so this is the actual reading that I'm
getting here like tour Wow
so the main thing that I use here is
that the maps that I have so we will go
we will go for the launch ones of the
highest most if you can see Wow or you
can actually choose it now you see this
is a look as one yeah so I have four
mid-post and this is like high but lower
in 1000 2000 rpm and this is the high
school you know like the more you say
the more I guess so now this is on high
as you see it says hi yeah then we will
see how much total turbo it's in psi
like more so like
the vision part you know I don't know
what's I care so it's gonna be with this
yellow line
yeah to the stop where the gauge will
stop with the needle will okay so maybe
you can show them here goes nothing
Oh
you know when you feel like you're
refolding like mark lies in your back
my friends
this is he said to me this is like the
feeling that he gets when
the carrier
is a late comeback right
oh my god that was crazy Oh like that is
like speed on another level so shits are
taking like five minutes to cool down
and relax I thought I'd show you the
interior trick oh yeah I'm gonna show
you the chair cause this thing is like
open carbon fibers out from the like you
know the middle section to where
everything is like the whole thing has
been carbon fiber and even the Kiwi see
that my custom carbon fiber key which is
really really epic but wow thank you so
much as an amazing Drive and yeah I saw
some stuff
I love the kita that's a very nice
customization
Rossler see my reaction announcement
around to everybody before ii you okay
flyball are you guys ready to hear a
loud engine to get the best possible
angle for you guys to see this car I
thought why not come to the side of the
road and see how it looks in the outside
for this car flying by so here goes
nothing let's give the cool and see this
bad boy in action
so the GTR is gonna be coming back down
this road and I'm sure we're gonna hear
it before I even get to yourself
let's get another shot that amazing
amazing car I hear something I hear
something guys
oh my god anyways guys one amazing today
has been with Mohammed thank you so so
much appreciate it
hey y'all ready
whoa okay we are back home right now
after to that any like a little snack
what do we have no I have no ice cream
you know on okay long thing that makes
me laugh from the day I told you guys
about my crisp and yogurt habit my
friend literally told me that y'all bro
you need serious help what the hell is
that habit of having Christian yogurt
tell me in the comment section do you
guys think it's bad like that bad
because my friend is like on my case
right now saying no that's completely
weird
okay everyone any actually you know what
I don't have my lollipop doesn't know so
that's what I'm gonna take as a snack I
might go to the hospital today just to
visit my friend again if I get some time
quickly gonna edit some stuff and put it
online as you do when you're a youtuber
I just found out this lollipop actually
has bubble gum in it which I'm really
happy about but what I wanted to say is
today my friend actually wanted to put
my mum in for a launch control and she
refused so if we break 20,000 likes we
did please please like you say say
number no no no 100 dad realize that I'm
oh so arrogant I can't no please
anything would you do it 35,000 mics and
you would do launch control in the GTR
no no 3550 it's impossible it's night
impossible okay guys let's try and break
35,000 mics so my mum launch controls in
a stronger GTR than the one today
because my friend's friend has a 2,000
horsepower GTR which is ridiculous
anyways I'm actually enjoying so I'm up
a lot huh I've got bubblegum
oh no dude yeah one more time Wow
that was a good one guys and here's I'm
pretty having a bit of fresh orange
juice prepared by my mom and I'm adding
everything all suppose to go see my
friend and see how he's doing today we
might do it I got a thing we're gonna do
a Cherry's but we might actually go
around our wheelchairs so I just made it
over to the hostel you guys can see
you're probably wondering like what am i
doing right now no joke is freezing in
this room like it's probably like zero
degrees I'm with my boy you can see over
here and he's been roasting me about the
crispin yoga for a week but he actually
wants to try it today so if he likes it
I think you guys would genuinely like it
as part of yours good so let's see he's
gonna give his review on it and he got
this just to taste it because he saw on
the vlog so yeah you have to tell them
if it's actually good and he's trying to
exact Labor's in my blog so let's see
that see if it's good my friend just
tried the Kristin yogurt and honestly he
said it was okay is it fair to say that
yeah it's okay guys alright so he said
it's not the best but it's nice I just
quickly came outside my friends Ward to
show you the hospital because I come
super super late like the place is empty
and a lot of the lights are turned off
but my friend just told me something
which has still got me in shock right
now so obviously you guys know his leg
has been broken and he told me basically
he doesn't have any use for a Rolls
Royce until he gets there so it wants me
to use it for you guys
so
yeah we just kind of got a rolls-royce
to use for about a week on the blog I
don't get it guys I was completely
kidding but I wanted to show you the key
of the rolls-royce it's actually really
really basic I never knew that like wait
let it focus look there you go guys that
is the key pretty much playing black key
with the RR in the middle pretty awesome
thing one thing never to forget hospital
guys always sanitize your hands yep
it's good for you check out this
milkshake they have over here this
chocolate milkshake it is so so cool
like I don't know how they get the
stripes in between it you now work yes
how you get the chocolate into it no but
like how does it like the cup oh wow
okay that makes sense yeah yeah okay
sorry guys but like I feel it's like a
whole line in between the levels anyways
I'm now heading off home it's like half
past 12:00 and this place is a tree like
empty empty obviously cuz I cruise walk
around in a hospital at half-past oh
okay so you guys more for another vlog

really really enjoyed it huge hike in to
Muhammad for driving us around in that
insane GTR and yes they also already
