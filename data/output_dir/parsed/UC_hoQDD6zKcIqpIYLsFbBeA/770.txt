yo yo yo guys welcome to another vlog so
today I'm going to be doing something
really ridiculous now supposed to do
this yesterday but I never knew that
apparently banks can only give you a
hundred thousand if you come after three
o'clock so that was something new so
basically I've got 100 thousand I took
out yesterday from the bank and I need
to go do that again today and then we're
gonna go to the showroom and pay cash
for my car so let's see how it turns out
hopefully I get something like a little
funny reaction or something I'm not even
sure I'm not even sure if I can record
inside there but let's see what goes
down and yeah I can finally check off
something off my bucket list so Lego
okay my sister just joined me she's
gonna be my driver today she's gonna
drive over I'll pay you 100 K and drive
me already hundred yeah let's go I like
bring my money back don't I put it on my
seat yeah you know I've always wanted to
do you know the part in 6-7 I bet you up
talkin Benjamin I got it that's how you
dawn city does I'm like a shingle wonder

beds when I got it Benjamin Altamont
Akkad seven shots okay so we just got to
the bank let's go withdraw the rest and
head off to shore and that's a wrap guys
in that overly big bag we have something
special we have a Mustang in that bag
too heavy yo you don't understand how
full my sisters values we quickly just
push through my sisters bagger like
quick I can now we safe yeah
oh geez yep just ripped bag oh so that's
the first one we had yesterday and this
is the new one make another dancing
video that goes if you wanna make a
music video now's the time I think we
need some more karaoke in the car since
we've doubled up baby guys so damn funny
company exactly we could actually do
that I think it would be the best of
that job if you're ever wondering what a
Mustang looks in cash this is what it
looks like it's actually quite a bit to
be honest I never thought it'd be that
much but as I said if I wanted to take
the biggest note here in Dubai I could
have had the whole Mustang in this much
two stacks of 1000s and that in dollars
is like in in Dubai or highest notes a
thousand terms which is like $300 so
yeah we've got quite a big note but
obviously I took out one in five hundred
200 and 100 just to make it look a bit
cooler cuz I mean two stacks or they
look like this and then I would have
looked like
normal sounds like nah I need to multi
color it rainbow it up make a hole a
hole why did you turn off the car shake
my head doesn't automatically turn up oh
good job are you trying to save money
out yeah but this is like they've
verified our pure bucks word records in
there it's empty oh my god oh my god
no it's okay we checked like last week
though so the only thing we actually got
today the fewer box is empty but it was
this and if you don't know what that
means
after months and months my sister
finally verified her YouTube account
hallelujah there you go she's now
officially youtuber even though she's
made like five videos so yeah well that
was a great stuff at the post office
my sister is now officially a youtuber
from YouTube themselves oh my god that
is like the funniest thing ever verified
verified youtuber hit him with a free
stock go on let's do it I said they can
imitate you but they can't duplicate you
cuz you got something special that makes
me monetise ooh by the way that's gonna
be the new Lamborghini repair center so
once that opens up that's where we're
gonna be taking this car for like
service and stuff like that okay we
finally made it here wow it was actually
a pretty long ride we were struggling
trying to find the exit and everything
let's go finish this payment once and
for all and then I have nothing to worry
about
yeah I'm going to see if he has the
great one so I can see it and then we'll
pay let's go guys let's see what's up
today how does it for you like ah a
heart beating I'm so happy because we've
come at an empty time there's barely
anyone here so it's gonna be less
embarrassing okay this is the red one
okay but I want to see the gray one one
more time so we can do the payment so
that's going to to my guy okay are you
good good
so to one person can I see the great one
one more time yes thank you so much I
can see it first
we go see it yeah like we finalized the
color personalise the car okay Cherie
Currie I think I'm gonna go for the gray
one a lot of the votes edit so I'm just
gonna see it one more time and then we
can pay
ever since I left the city you you you
the color I pick is a great California
special where you see by it's not
actually great it's just like it's very
similar though but I'm not going to show
you the great one just for one reason
and I want it to be special when I do
get it so as you can see we go the
cashier and let's go finalize the
purchase they did have it in stock I
just checked
so yeah let's see how do you react when
you put 200k on that table
let's go down I say this is so funny I
was thinking like a thumbnail shot and I
was scared someone would be like looking
at me like that discarded do you want to
like put the money I don't know hold in
our hands and I'm going shopping and buy
a bunch I'm coming in towards Accords a
car have you everyone had anyone do this
yes really
yeah so there you go guys I did ask if
it's ever been done before and yes I'm
not the first
I guess loads of people have done this
before but I think I'm the first I
should come in with 100 I know or like
500 in stock so that's a pretty good I'm
the first or something this is what you
need okay same places last if you give
em list and time you're going to pick
200,000 lose dependent money up and give
you
and come with it you want to be here it
is really okay how my face I don't mind
yep thank you so much I just saw I just
got the paperwork and I need to go
finish off the payment that's what we're
doing now and I actually where's the
payment is here where are we doing the
payment you around there all right I'm
being super weird today
yes yeah it's the weirdest ways almost
done a before
I liked it to be colorful yeah that's a
colorful day there you go guys it's all
being counted out legitimate nothing
fake here it wasn't fake cash or
anything as you can see it's not at
least as well guys you'll keep saying
more you're leasing the car nope oh that
was a dodgy no that was a dodgy one my
sister has been so shy throughout this
whole thing to vlog like a Jew like go
stag ding dong I know in that aisle I
make finished money was there 200k on
the dot nothing went missing with our
stupid video and yeah I'm glad that's it
five days is when I thank you so much
like my last night oh so much that's
been a stressful day I've been sweating
making this video for you guys the
nervousness I said I was so embarrassed
doing this like it's a ridiculous thing
to do especially with holding it
remotely around getting thumbnail shots
and everything like that and that is a
wrap the color i pick gray slash black
it's california edition it's good
magnetic it's basically this one but the
gray version well that was an amazing
adventure I'm broken oh okay I'm sorry
I'm sorry I didn't give you the money
okay mommy's calling okay we have to
answer her
hello mommy hello were your own vlog I
think she was more worried about the
fact that we had cash with us when we
stopped on three yeah mine was on silent
cuz we were finishing off the deal
that was mean
we're finally in our area we made it we
made it let's say hi to our security
hello security actually knows us now
like before they never knew us until
they were like yeah time to get back oh
yeah damn I just completely remembered
I've got a conference go in three hours
we had to finish it early so I could
come do this conference cool
I'm so loud today me and my mom are
gonna do some grocery shopping before my
conference cool it's only in an hour and
a half so I thought I'd join now we're
trying to get the cats back inside
bubbles will at no cost to come to my
mom he's just running away like it look
at this oh oh oh
Kitty's joining in on the chase good boy
go inside I want to thank you guys a lot
and there's one reason you guys really
did help me out when it came to choosing
my car now I'm not sure if you've
noticed this watching my vlogs when it
comes to choosing things I'm really bad
at it I can't choose what I want in life
at all like I really can't like YouTube
is the only thing I ever chosen I knew I
actually liked but except from that like
when I go to buy a hat I don't know if I
should get red or black if I go to buy a
watch you probably know this I've done
so many like videos where I just can't
pick something to buy and that's why I
was having I was having a huge problem
with the car I wanted and you guys
really did help me out I mean honestly
it was your comments that made me go for
the grey California Edition what's up
there's a Mustang shoe I don't think
it's exactly my car okay one of our
neighbors owns a Mustang that's not a
Mustang mom that's a my mom thought a
Dodge SRT what you call with them was a
Mustang but yeah I want to thank you
guys again for helping me out my mom
doesn't even know my car looks like she
thought a Dodge is my car what's up
Tobey don't be on the street get off the
street good boy let's go let's go mommy
okay no no
this lowly for me oh my god
you could have cured Oh such a cute dog
I absolutely love dogs next thing on my
bucket list would be a dog but the only
thing is if I get one I know I probably
won't like take care of it as much as I
should then we'll go to like my mom has
to take care of it and I don't want it
so I only get it when I know like I'm
gonna have the time for it within the
next 20 minutes I'm going to be hard
during your Skype conference cool I just
opened up my skype after we do the
conference go I'll try and let you know
what's going on
wish me luck fingers crossed we can come
to an agreement and I can start with my
clothing I'd be amazing anyways as I
said wish me luck
crossed your fingers while you're
watching from video and I'll see you
after the conference cool peace
so I just finished with my conference
business type of call and to be honest I
did I had like three pads writing down
all the information all I can say at
this moment is I had a good chat in
regards to everything the company was
clear in what they can offer for you and
the deal they can provide for you at the
moment I am very unsure I'm not going to
say I'm going to go with them or not to
be honest there is tweaks I need to make
and based on if they can give me what I
want then maybe we can go ahead but also
I need to discuss it with my family
that's another thing however I do want
to say one thing a lot of you have been
asking more what company is it or who is
it you're working with to be honest I'm
someone who never mentioned a company's
name until I do start working with them
however I will say one thing because I
have been getting emails saying oh I
also want to start fashion that's the
reason I want to know the company now my
advice would be take your time with
things now there's a lot of websites out
there that do this type of stuff if you
even type in on YouTube starting your
own fashion company and stuff there's
loads of videos that you can get
directed to with loads online companies
that do the same thing
however do not rush into things because
at the end of the day you need to get
the right deal and that's something that
is hard to do a lot of the time but to
be honest me saying I think patience is
the key even if it takes you a year just
take your time and get the right deal
because you don't want to get locked
into something that you're not really
like getting a fair share off or you
know I mean that's that let's cross our
fingers and see maybe we can come to
some sort of agreement and if not
patience is the key to success don't
play yourself don't get yourself into
something that you're gonna regret later
on and that's all I'm gonna say
okay anyways I'll see you guys tomorrow
with another vlog for now stay awesome
Yolo Yolo goodbye
