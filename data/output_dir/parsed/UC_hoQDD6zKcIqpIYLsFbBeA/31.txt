oh my god why are you screaming like

well I am done are you kidding I'm not
doing any more intros I have noted a
video two days ago and I don't know
we're out of nowhere
YouTube decides to driver my video a
Kippur
let's fix them you can't break me and
fix me again I can't break your car and
off and say two cakes I fixed it the
damage has been done what I'm trying to
say at the beginning of this video guys

subscribe button by the way just to put
this out there no no good pool didn't do
it guys so don't don't no this was
literally like a random choice we
actually have a very exciting idea we're
gonna do later on and we're gonna dye my
hair we're gonna make me blond guys I've
always wanted to be a white boy since
I've been hung like it is time to do
what we are about to do we are about to
bleach my hair we're about to burn my
hair as my sister says we're gonna make
me go blonde like like not brown hair
not like brunette blonde no I'm gonna be
a white boy now oh so pretty much this
is actually the acid right oh god this
looks like drugs you want this cocaine
a guy's hair I just hope you don't go
bald either way it makes for a good
thumbnail oh this is the last time
you're gonna see my hair black I want
all of you to take print screens right
now because mo is about to go blonde I
don't know what's about to happen right
now but my sister is applying the bleach
to my hair this is interesting
so we're trying our best to not make me
go bold before my hair becomes blocked
don't you think this like whitish blue
looks nice on my hair no I think this
could be a new trend for me I feel like
I'm getting a head massage right now
don't you think I look like a rapper
right now oh all right so so far this is
what my hair looks like guys I just
quickly came out of the toilet to show
you a little bit better
watch this I actually really like you
like looking at in the mirror damn son
at the moment it's nice like I really
like it but let's see how the end
product is bro bro I touch my skin I
start burning I don't know about you bro
it's all my hair and I'm fine
don't you feel it I don't understand
right I did it touched my wrist and I
started my sister seems more stressed
than me yeah of course because I
if anything happens it's my
responsibility if you leave it the very
long L turn white I'm just warning you
that that's dangerous
so what happens if you travel and you're
blond but your passports black are you
kidding me I might be traveling next
week maybe okay
and what happens if I show up is blond
but my passport is black care so we've
applied to hair color so far it seems
okay but more used to tell me off for
bleaching my hair so arguing I can do
what I want to guys I'm a man I'm a man
better a lot to do anything they want
come back come back it's me it's me
again apparently my cat doesn't
recognize me anymore with blonde hair so
yeah it is moment of truth right now
we're gonna see how my hair actually
looks like you know I slightly look like
a girl I can't even lie you know
exactly can you don't take out from the
top how's my body gonna fit through the
neck you know this is a very dumb idea
this is finally the moment of truth I
know I've said it like a hundred times
but we're gonna wash my hair and let's
see what my hair turned out like this is
the
oh okay why don't you wash every shampoo
maybe if we dry it because sometimes
okay this is the moment we can like
shave your head off now Oh at least
you're halfway closer to your dream bro
why are you three too long
so bad
this looks so bad you know it's nothing
this not even like it's like it's like
it's literally like we like what uh you
know what we could do we can go brownish
there's nothing we can do we can do
right now like are you guys seeing this
like like what like what happened to
that white I don't know I'm questioning
the same thing this is cool this is like
weird orange gold like nobody would ever
do this is their right mind this is my
first time all right let's go get mom's
reaction this is so bad bro is it
disgusting um I don't want to see my god
okay here goes nothing guys it's time
for my mom's reaction are you ready
mommy like eight three two
why go
but you think I look good sorry you just
just found no because if I put yours on
my face I don't know exactly what the
same I think I've made one of the
biggest mistakes of my life to try and
color my hair so different yeah okay
it's getting better now when you trying
it no I think blue is my father I think
like with this yeah I know right
once you've started a little bit like I
think what do you think like my friends
will still be my friends I don't know
guys I actually found the perfect
disguise for my head look when I wear a
hat you couldn't even tell that I
colored my hair yes you can I can wear a
hat and pretend like nothing has
happened and then and then there's a
miracle good hats you just bounce see
there's always a solution if you want if
you have a little there's a way you know
I think this is like my new way of
wearing hats I think a lot of like
