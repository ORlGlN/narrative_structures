good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog so I found it like a mess but I had
to show you guys a drink I've made this
looks like quite a cocktail and let me
explain what it is I had an amazing idea
to freeze water than freeze coped and
freeze water and then put Santa on top
and I think it looks pretty cool so it's
probably going to be a thumbnail and
yeah try at home all right so we're
going out to pick up the Range Rover
taxis here you can see it in the front
and my sister taking up the garbage
cameras fogging up this is a disaster
and I'll see you guys once we get the
range over so you finally made it to the
Range Rover service place there you go
you can see a couple Range Rovers and I
don't know why there's a Mustang which
is a ranger around for days but yeah
once we get the Range Rover we should be
heading off and yeah look at this place
so Chemical I think that's our Range
Rover yeah that's the white one over
there so once we're done over here
continued logging but this place is
actually really nice to bloat that's our
car so clean
yeah I'll see you guys in a couple
minutes alright so I'm currently just
sitting on till my sister does her thing
here and I wanted to show you guys the
Rangers they have over there as those
for fixing I think that's what they do
to every single one just service it
pretty much but once we're done here as
I said we're going to go to the mall and
do some shopping and yah hopefully you
guys are enjoying these looks are we
done over here we're just going to go
get to the car and we'll be leaving what
you have to say we got us a hot
chocolate as well alright so we're done
guys we all got ourselves a little
lattes and hot chocolates or whatever
and whoa finally we have a car again and
okay now to say gonna work out where's
the keys in the car anyways before my
seatbelt got in the way I was saying
we're about to head off guys I've gone
when you join the highlighted route
there's always something distracting me
but yeah that's a black ranger that's
our Ranger or black tell me guys if you
prefer that or the white one we have and
that is the vogue and the Evoque or is
that a sport again I don't I need to
take so we currently have arrived at the
Dubai Mall and as always the parking
here is hectic and I think we just found
ourselves one is that one note and this
guy can't drive to save his life in
front of us I mean once you're in the
mall I'll continue to vlog for now we
have to fight for our parking oh please
don't take that
not they didn't okay no they did yes we
found ourselves a parking whoa oh yeah
free parking boys final checks before
she enters the mall teeth check neck
check god knows what she's doing
what you do so here we finally made it
to the more we had to look for parking
like 20 minutes this place is busy and
it's not even the weekend so in weekends
like most of times you have to give her
valet because it's so busy and
ridiculous but yeah that's the life of
the buyer I guess so we're currently in
this store and this is what I picked up
mustaches I think will be useful for
some video I don't know what type of
video but I think it will be useful so
that's what I'm going to get myself some
mustaches so I'm currently in Muji my
sister wants to buy some makeup box and
