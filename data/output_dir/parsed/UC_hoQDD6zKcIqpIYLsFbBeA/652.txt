yo yo everyone how are you doing hope
you are all having a great day so first
things first before I even start
blogging today I want to say I finally
officially have a Facebook page did you
guys like what the hell I'm going to be
honest there's actually a page on
Facebook with 25,000 followers and a lot
of you guys think that's me nope that
literally was not me that is some random
person I have no idea who it is but if
you want to follow my official page the
link will finally be in the description
let me show you how it looks by the way
so I did just open it today and I don't
want you guys to judge me okay but this
is how it looks like so far there you go
guys that is my official Facebook page
it's got like zero likes none at all so
let's try and get working all you have
to do you know you press that like
button and that's it then you're
following my page so thank you guys but
yeah guys there you go I finally have a
Facebook page the thing is I actually
used to have one which a lot of you may
have known about like I had 5,000
friends on there which is the max limit
and basically it got banned and the
reason was if you're like a youtuber or
someone and you want like a load of your
fans following you you need to make a
page and I didn't do it because I didn't
think anything would happen until they
banned me so now I've got one you check
it out and yeah woah a hundred thousand
subscribers later and we have a Facebook
account so I've realized that a lot of
you seem to like me and my sister do
like double blogs where she does half
her day I do half my day so today I'm
actually gonna be giving the camera over
