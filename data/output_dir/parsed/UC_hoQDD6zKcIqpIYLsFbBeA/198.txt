Lamborghini has such a unique rap to it
look at that guys absolutely love it I
have to say and I mean ah it's just guys
wherever you look you just see a ton of
supercars like I look everywhere
honestly my favorite thing for today is
the new McLaren cuz this is the first
time I'm seeing in person I think
okay boy so right now my good friend a
blow everybody he is actually the
founder of this event guys so amazing
turnout like this so crazy cars lazy
cars but what do you think about my car
my car your car is awesome really it's
for your sister not for you kalana
sorry okay they did a good work yeah
excellent work but I think it's nice for
your sister anyways what's your
favourite car today
my favourite car is the 720 the orange
one look nice awesome double Keeney
orange and the grey that's awesome
anyways guys want to go a huge shot at
him he always sets up by the craziest
events that your Dino shoutout my boy
and at least he likes the car that's all
I rather go for the thing since there
are so many supercars it's really really
hard to stand out guys but one of the
cars I absolutely love is this it's like
this turquoise blue Hawk and over here
honestly if you see this in person right
now it's like glowing out of all the
other cars and it's got like the coolest
rims in the world if you see that
anyways guys absolutely awesome turnout
I just love coming to these events just
because you get to meet so many people
that also love cars if that makes sense
being ashes out my good friend I provide
that you saw he's the one that sets up
with these awesome events and I think
he's speaking the truth because like
honestly I so everywhere I go they think
the Lamborghinis my sisters and I'm like
not nuts kind of my car so yeah ok so
right I want to show you the new McLaren
720 but since I don't know much about
the car my friend case over here who
knows everything he's going to tell you
about it so go ahead hey guys so the 720
was actually a pretty exciting car from
the Clarence
the first time they've changed a car
from the Super Series pretty Wow so
McLaren has therefore super and
alternate series the completely
redesigned car it uses the mono cage to
it now comes with a cage I don't know
what I mean it sounds super advanced
guys you have the keys on you so if you
see the doors the roof panel opens with
the door wow so this actually looks
really cool but it allows it allows you
to enter and exit like oh wow it's much
easier and then it has this trick
holding display so you have the display
that can basically closed down like that
oh my give you an unrestricted view of
the track so whenever you put it into
track mode it does that the car comes
with a lot more bells and whistles it's
a very very practical part for day to
day use I have no issues at all even
clearing speed bumps and all that it's
very deceptive it looks super low low
but it's very practical it has a nose
lift just in case you need that there's
a camera inside that it it records your
driving video as well as track telemetry
so it'll tell you how how much you have
your put on the gap how much Club you
put on the brake what kind of g-forces
are there and then you can essentially
compare your lap with yourself with your
best performance or with somebody else's
but yeah and so you can improve Wow
there's cars like a teacher results like
teaching you how to do every they're
really cool that has closed doors or the
kind of other fancy stuff
check us out the the engine bay glows
red I'm absolutely in love with the
start enjoying every mile of how much
you know about it you know everything it
was a very fortunate to get the very
first one oh wow the first seventh one
PS
in the UE so fortunately congratulation
I'm kind of becoming a bit of an
ambassador for trying to tell everyone
about the virtues of this car Wow you're
sitting on the fence I think you should
get off that fence you're going to make
they're going to make me regret buying
your car right now I should have got
this this and this thing is there are
reports right now saying that McLaren
most probably understated the horsepower
at 720 horsepower and they most probably
understated the horsepower and is
actually higher horsepower than that so
Wow a pretty hard dinner I think anyways
thank you so much for letting us know
how their cars and insane beast over
here guys this is not your normal
supercar this is next-level stuff
okay so right now with my friend
Mohammed over here guys and I'm getting
everybody's honest reaction to my pink
Lamborghini okay so what'd you think I
told you I'm at the epitome here this
guy okay
it's all honestly because look at the
color look at this color in a guy damn
ugly for guys
I love his honesty eyes yeah it's a nice
car by default okay this nice car yeah
the problem is the color okay so I know
for the past couple of minutes I've only
been showing the supercars but honestly
the area we've come to is really really
cool basically it's somewhere that's
newly opened it's good like the lost
exit and everything here is based on the
movie Mad Max if you guys know it so if
you check this place out
they've got a ton of like the stuff from
the movie itself one I'm not sure how
many of you guys have seen the movie but
they have like a ton of crazy tank cars
like this and I think they have like a
ton of restaurants on caravans if you
know what I mean so kind of dope stuff
over here I'm just kind of checking it
out but honestly it's my first time here
I think they just opened today so that's
why I've never seen the space don't
climb don't touch
uh this is so so awesome but yeah for
now I'm actually heading out you guys
super awesome to just come along and see
all of the cars honestly it's been a
while since I've been to a car event so
I kind of missed this scene if you know
what I mean
and honestly in summers there's not too
many car vents because it's really hot
and stuff like that but I'm glad we got
one okay so yeah let's go we're saying
goodbye to all of the supercars right
now bye y'all I'm not gonna lie guys
today was actually a nice turnout
driving the big Lambo is like the most
embarrassing thing but I need to get
your blood pumping again yeah
I'm basically my friend drive on my a
listen I'm done driving this car for
today we need to have turns and we take
this now these are actually like drivers
and these big like truck fans or
whatever you call them just like the
movie guys Hey look
oh what a day it's been our boys are
finally back home off of that crazy
carbon right now look who's here oh my
god what the hell you look so white I in
case you guys are wondering why my
sister looks like a ghost BAM she's got
like a huge light in front of her face
right now

sister's doing like her first ever meet
and greet and you guys like by the time
