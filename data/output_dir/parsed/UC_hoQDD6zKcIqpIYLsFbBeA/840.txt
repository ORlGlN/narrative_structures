today we're going to be doing Bo versus
this racing let's go amazing you were
just getting some preview of how to go
on the last verse 2 laps gonna go slow
and then from there we're gonna start
increasing I probably looks so weird
right now I'm excited to do this
lion roaring in the Morning Sun such a
formal long good day people feeling like
the light has just come we must never
stop the way let's check
my gosh
No
so that
we're gonna go change up now I actually
think I can become our Easter I was good
right
I was also yeah I kept on taunting her
with I think you can't see me but you
can see my face so it's really amazing
we just when you're on the track I think
at one point I suddenly lost what is
really exciting and they're pretty fast
actually I didn't expect to meet up
first the car was like our control my
sister swerve that it's like did you
catch it on camera I turned my head and
I was like please be on Cara's like
really I said that was the most fun I've
had and it's actually really hard to
like it right yeah well I when I was
looking back at you I almost swerved off
the like thing what's your to the track
yeah I was like I don't know look like
oh you're not I kept looking back cuz I
was scared that you might be next to me
absolutely amazing I'm gonna take this
up now
oh you know who's you though you don't
who's you that guy yeah but that's you
there he's that's why Iowa should do as
I said we're finished up now you can
hear the mowers of all the things going
by and they're super loud and Vause
anyway the biggest time that we wrapped
up because we've had way too much fun oh
look at the kitty guys you could cut
here
oh he's gonna rub himself on me Oh
bracing with a bag yeah let's go
okay that's a wrap my hair is super
scruffy now helmet hair
and yet it's time to go so we finished
everything and they gave us our time for
the laps now bearing in mind I don't
know what the results are
but I kept flowing down so regardless of
the outcome I think the winner should be
me
she said the average time is there so we
have to go on average times what's the
average time who won I can show the
camera so so close okay so the bottom
was the average time by one second that
is a wrap boy one even on average time
and to be honest I kept on letting her
go ahead of me so I think I should have
had like 20 seconds ahead of now joking
Oh proving your speediness you're
driving but where's the car keys okay
yeah that's all Sondra I throws with me
for a second let's go we've actually
come to our old area to eat I'm really
low so we've actually come to our old
area t I think you guys should recognize
it this is where we used to live like
six seven months ago we always used to
hang out in this area we're gonna eat
there and yeah bring back memories Oh
speak about the cats guys they're still
here look at them oh I don't remember
this one though look like bubble there's
a baby version of bubbles right there
okay oh so they're still here oh look at
it we have two cats exactly like it it's
like a replica the bubbles is facing
is it a male or a female no it's a male
Oh does he let you touch him oh you
might be a housecat you reckon know he's
really clean really yeah maybe he just
likes it grew himself a lot he's really
clean look and he's really friendly look
at him baby's really cute okay so the
designated place to eat is Pizza Hut I
remember I'd like an Instagram so where
we had like four drinks all the
different colors but they can also visit
