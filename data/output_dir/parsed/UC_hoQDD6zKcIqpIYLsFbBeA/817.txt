good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog so I'm starting today's vlog Midway
into my run my sister's going to be
joining me in like two three minutes or
like five minutes I decided to start off
earlier than her so I can get a bit more
tired anyways I'm not sure if it's in
the title of this vlog but today is
actually the UAE 44th national day so
what that means to you guys that don't
know this country has been around for 44
years that is not a long time at all but
I'm not saying that this country just
blow it up out of nowhere I basically
what it means exactly is before it was
UAE was like separate places or like I
don't know what you could and then they
came together to make UAE as a country
and that is what that is so hopefully
you guys enjoyed today's vlog off the
destroyed I'm gonna head out because I
think there's gonna be loads of things
going on so hopefully we can get some of
the on camera let go whoo
my sister finally join me you can
probably see her somewhere in the back I
don't even know where she is anymore
yeah she's over there somewhere we're
just gonna do a small little run and
then we're gonna go out for the national
day and hopefully stop outside they go

look at the architecture of this
building okay let's just follow this
corner if you go it goes completely
round to the other side you see that it
completely bends it's so mind-blowing
and it looks so amazing I don't know if
the camera can really capture it but you
can see it's like twirling all the way
