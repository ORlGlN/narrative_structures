what's up all right oh boy you just
broke it you just work it
or the caliber these are my fall how
cheap is this thing Oh God not something
you just be careful legit broke it
cracked I'm gonna leave that to the side
and yeah that is the petrol pump that we
have now for war and as you can see it's
just garbage guys so right now we're
actually heading over to the central
post office and I'm not even gonna lie I
haven't been there for a good 1 month
the reason I'm going is there's actually
been a package there one package and the
thing is they they like randomly select
the big packages to go over there so I
think if it's like over 3 kilograms they
send it to the main post post post post
office to see what's inside it so yeah
check it out guys so he just made it
over to the pure boxes by the way look
at the sky it looks absolutely awesome
right now it's sunset yeah
color the clouds have they're amazing so
these are the two packets that where you
got I don't know why this one reminds me
of a chicken it looks like there's a
chicken and so I don't know why it looks
like there's a whole chicken I feels
kind of soft as well which adds to that
feeling and my mum go green box
so we had two packets over here I'm
happy because I thought we had one and I
told them I can you check the system if
there's any other ones and then they're
like yeah there's another one I was a
yes since I didn't promise you guys
about two weeks ago that always make
sure to look fresh I'm actually gonna go
get a haircut right now and I know my
hair isn't extremely long
but I want to look sharp for you guys so
seeing a couple minutes guys
so you guys can see a fresh mole piece
oh hi guys I'm just seeing inside here
about to get the cut I feel so weird
whenever I have these things on you know
it's like you've got like a little
change on anyways just finished my
haircut and my mom's I should come to
buy some shoes he's buying these and
they look like these crocodiles don't
worry they're not real it might like
these white crocodile skin shoes but
they're not like legit crocodile but
what you guys reckon um I think white I
don't know they look very similar are
you gonna get the white ones
so I'm actually heading over right now
to see a pretty cool car my boy called
me and apparently they have like a a
fully Corbin McLaren p1 in their
showroom and if you guys don't know this
is ridiculous let me just say that by
the way my face burns like I told you
it's my first time ever getting my face
righted like I don't even know the odds
like I thought it and I was like I just
do whatever do it you know their days
are your sigh I don't even care just do
what you think is right and it burns but
I'm not sure if you guys can tell my
face looks so vibrant you know alright
boys check it out sigh he's made it over
to my boy showroom and if you guys
remember the p1 this is still here
obviously still a very special car but
you guys can probably see why I'm here
for
so that is actually a one of five fully
carbon-fiber p1 which is absolutely
ridiculous now if you guys don't know
what that means carbon-fiber is like
super super expensive it's like one of
the hardest and lightest materials
that's why they use it for cars I'm not
going to get scientific with you guys it
kind of just looks amazing that's why I
came to check it out and super a super
rare now even on the engine it says 105
just so you guys can make sure I'm not
lying to you look oh there p1
105 and on the spoiler over here Carbon
series now the thing is these are
actually straight from the factory now
like some cars people just like make
them fully carbon-fiber this is factory
made which makes it so much more special
and if you're looking to buy on at these
it's around three million dollars which
is pretty expensive but it is fully
carbon fiber as I said so you don't see
any of these cars like literally if
anything happens to this there's only
going to be four more left so we don't
want that to happen it's good like this
awesome awesome look - I don't know how
to explain it it's just like loads of
squares like piling up it's just crazy
how the material is all like that
anyways let me show you the other car so
we have this one kind of makes it - of
375 over here but this this is one of my
favorites guys you guys already know the
Lamborghini SV oh this car is just so so
mean since I'm here let me also show you
one other car if you guys don't know
this is like a four-wheel-drive Bentley
and the reason I'm showing you that car
is because I think the new
four-wheel-drive Lamborghini is coming
out within the next year and that's
going to be crazy like imagine
Lamborghini with a four-wheel-drive car
shouldn't be interesting guys I'm gonna
try and vlog it as soon as it comes out
it's super cool just being here when
it's empty by the way look at just
have like Veyrons yeah Ferrari like just
you know casual everyday stuff over here
but yeah we're going to go ahead out and
eat as I said I literally only came to
see this carbon fiber car because it's
just we're gonna say goodbye to the p1
for now goodbye p1 number 1 p1 number
two
a Lamborghini s3 we're gonna head out to
eat so we just made it over here and are
having some milkshakes mine's coming
it's like this huge Oh check this out
guys I'm gonna get it right now thank
you
this is not one of the most ridiculous
no Jake's ever is this is actually a nut
tell a milkshake guys I didn't even know
they did these things let's test it out
art oh oh god I regret I messed
everything up guys wow this is really
nice guys oh my god I need a tissue now
cuz I'm messing my fingers up
is yummy
I messed up so bad guys ah ah okay look
at that
yeah I created a big mess in my car I
accidentally left that and it kind of
flipped while I was driving home ah look
at that
yo so check it out guys no home mommy mo
showed me this yes it happened again now
I don't know if you're like low check
the CCTV cameras to see who it is and
I'm actually really really happy I did
it because this time mommy Bowl and
Laura actually met the person I was at
home I was out eating but apparently is
one of you guys from the yo Scott
shout-out you guys so much but they did
say you please don't put them in the
vlog which I respect and this one is
actually probably so first saw was for
me guys the second one over there in
that corner was Lana's and then this one
is finding my Mo's and I think what what
kind of flowers are they mommy sweet
sweet flowers dozen yeah this one P odd
okay something peony flowers apparently
like you special flowers and like if you
look at them they're not really open
they're kind of like a I don't even know
how to explain them they're close though
it looks like a ball like it's literally
a ball guys you see that so recently
I've actually been having loads of back
problems guys so I thought the best way
to fix it is to have my mum walk on my
back let's see how much clicks we can
