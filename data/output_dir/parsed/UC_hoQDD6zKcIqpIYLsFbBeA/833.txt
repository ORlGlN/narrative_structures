good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog so basically what's going on today
is we need to take in the range over
again for service just like the third
time the breaks are still making noise
like there's no problem it's just
they're making noise so we just need to
get that sorted out again I know it's
such a hassle but we're going in two
cars so she's going to be in front of me
going with the Lambo and then I'll be
taking the Range Rover so hopefully we
can get a couple nice clips today and
yeah let's go sort this out once and for
all Lego Toby
wait great this is the problem of going
somewhere my sister like she's taking
forever in her car look at this
she's waiting I'm not even sure what
she's doing sure like checking her they
are there she goes

that is in person okay let's try and get
some way
okay I hope I really do hope the wind
did not get in the way of that
accelerate down is so loud from the
outside normally when you're seeing
inside you do not realize it but that
was crazy that was like one of the best
accelerations I've secured where I
stopped that man
we're finally here let's go to the sky
in my sister is going to fix the
position of our car so funny story the
Range Rover didn't end up making any
noise so what we're going to do is drive
it for a week they said it needed time
to take like setting and we didn't give
it time let's go that was really loud a
seat is adjusted so weird Wow okay

weirdest angle to get out okay I'll see
you guys once I go on the road
my sister's bringing the car out and
look at her parking space it's so tired

there but I do have something very
special that I already did take home so
