hey yo yo everyone good morning and
welcome to another vlog pineapple moe is
back
so before I start today's vlog I
actually want to cut to a clip we
recorded about three weeks ago now we
were about to go out I saw this really
cool video on YouTube but I actually
completely lost those clips until today
so watch it for yourselves it's a really
cool way to solve a Rubik's Cube in two
moves and yeah you're gonna be
mind-blowing after that I'm gonna cut
back to today so don't mind the hair
change that video is from ages ago ok
let's go I was trying to solve my
Rubik's Cube you can see I did one side
but I just ran across a video that says
how to solve the Rubik's Cube with two
moves so I'm going to put it right here
so we can watch it together
it has your net coz it's because the
method is so simple that the Rubik's
Cube with no one would be a mystery
alright okay using only two moves and
repeating those moves you can pick up
any reviews starting in any position
this is big this is biggest right just
by repeating these two moves on solve
acute and as long as you they keep those
moves over and over the cube will
ultimately solve it so it's getting
Messier anything no I boy so that's say
okay he did this this
this this now we're doing it boys
you know what screw this I hate you I
hate this video to all the Lyman
that video was just a waste of time guys
you know you're not ready yet I watched
a really cool video to watch it I check
this out if you keep on pipelining one
yeah you can soak any room issue the
tumors don't you just keep on doing that
again and again it solves it you will
ultimately solve
I think it's completely fake don't even
bother I spent five minutes doing it I
think he's taking a fresh Rubik's Cube
done everything backwards and then start
doing that look at me go what's sick
people say I just paint - I tried the
trick for two days and his new hasn't
worked I feel bad for you man
damn maybe he's right maybe a deeper
four days and even how good is my
Rubik's Cube bro
alright and we are back from that clip
okay I completely showed you guys that
it just didn't work it really did not
work I thought it would if there's any
tricks you guys know that work let me
know because I've been struggling to
sell my Rubik's Cube for like yeah 21
years since I was born
oh no no no it went on my laptop this is
the best way to drink coke from a glass
bottle with loads of ice in there look
at the fizz Cheers
ah voiceover I should do something that
so many of you have been waiting for if
you guys didn't know when I hit a hun
hundred thousand I mean a million
subscribers I did a giveaway released
two cameras and today I'm gonna be
picking the winner so good luck to
everybody
there was over 100,000 comments before I
guess I might even do another giveaway
after I pick the winners to these so
let's get straight into this there's
actually a really cool way of picking
the winner so let me show you guys check
it out this was the video that I did the
giveaway on
as you can see I was super excited this
video got over $100,000 as you can see
and instead of going through all of them
is actually a really quick way we
discovered so all you have to do is you
take the URL you copy it there's just
like website where you paste it and it
loads every single comment so we're
gonna paste the link in there then it's
load comments look at this guy's that is
so cool I've never seen somebody do it
this way 1359 comments Dan it shows each
and it goes through each page and the
thing is this like actually shows how
many comments each person left
what comment they left who the user is
this is gonna take ages to loot load all
of them Luda sages delude them error
loading page 255 ice loading oh I
thought this program was gonna fail on
us guys anyways guys while that loads up
all of the comments I want to say we are
going to randomly generate a winner but
unfortunately if the comment is rude
then you're eliminated from the
competition because I only want to give
out to my supporters so that way it kind
of gives back to you guys or support my
channel and secondly I'm doing another
giveaway ok so you guys loved the first
giveaway this one is the exact same I'm
going to be giving away $500 in cash I
know I was lazy to go out and pick and I
am but I thought some of you guys can
use that so the only rule again is be a
subscriber and comment down on this
video this is gonna take like ages guys
you've been seeing here for 10 minutes
and look at that way it's still not even
halfway so I'm gonna go have a cup of
tea guys and we'll be back to pick the
winner

oh yeah okay today's sports a day in the
ballet is a
light-blue Aventador I've seen this one
a couple of times the it's just
magnificent I love the cutters I just
pretty cool like yo this is what you
call free advertisement guys okay we're
going to put our photo on the screen now
the date of all your recording a video
magnet what are you doing guys I mean
I've always told you the best way to be
successful in life advertise yourself
the most you can put your photo off on
billboards put your phone on computer
screens it's the same like billboard
computer screen somebody's still looking
at it and then we thought okay no let's
take a short video I just put it there
leave that on the screen that's there
you go guys
free advertisement for me let's go oh my
god guys like Oh mum emo found it's like
the world's biggest bear or shade dad I
just figured out they've got so many
more cool things over here look at that
they've got a tower oh the world's
biggest for O'Shea what you reckon is in
there there's more ferocious I'm
disappointed I thought it'd be like one
massive Brera Shana let you buy it in
two and the chocolate starts coming out
out of it dull they should make that
guys okay we found another cool toy guys
what does this do paper scissors
rock rock rock paper
that is awesome Holly don't know yo I've
given mommy more the $50 challenge for
her Eid gift guys mommy mo you're only
allowed spend $50
I liked you about the thousand dollars
you're not getting that okay we're about
to leave when we came in there was one
blue Aventador
now there's a yellow down now that I she
want to attempt the little magic trick
for you guys but I've never seen it been
done with one of these long matchsticks
so I'm not sure it will work but
regardless let's test out so let's open
this up and give it a shot I've actually
never seen these oh look at the size of
this matchstick that is crazy okay so we
want to do is put one matchstick in a
box then the next thing you're gonna
need is your coin and you want to
balance this on the other matchstick
just like so now the challenge is to
remove the coin from under the
matchstick without moving it and
hopefully this works so let's give this
a shot guys wait what the hell this
doesn't even light up guys
what type of fake matchstick is this
what type of fake magic is this oh my
god that is great I really don't think
this is gonna work guys
this looks like a bad idea do you think
this is gonna work I hope this works
no no we don't take failure as an answer
guys so I'm gonna actually shorten these
two around normal match length and do it
again I want to see if this evil worked
because I've never tried it out so I'm
just gonna quickly cut this in my knife
and we're gonna try it again okay who
don't run - there you go I finally made
them smaller and let's see if it
actually works this time okay girlfriend
let's see if this works here we go yeah
it worked it worked mommy well it worked
whoo
and there you go guys that is what you
call a magic trick coin is removed and
matchsticks have not been touched look
at this this one is completely bent like
it was like that when I got it so I
don't like this one or maybe it's a
little bit special you ready whoo happy
birthday happy birthday I know it's one
of your birthdays out there happy
birthday yes fun if it all right if you
guys remember when I got that chocolate
fountain thing it's been sitting here
with the chocolate on it for about two
weeks and the problem is it's really
hard to get the chocolate out so we kind
of just left it in there has it dried up
the chocolate looks dry mommy oh yeah
that's nice I don't know what I'm
tasting I thought I want to get the
chocolate out of there it's been here
for like two weeks and we've covered it
with cling film but I think it's time we
try to just like empty it cuz nobody
