good morning morning yo yo yo everyone
what is that welcome back to another
vlog so this is day 3 in Spain guys so
basically today is actually a very
exciting day because if you guys don't
know right now I'm going downstairs
and apparently Thierry on Reed is going
to be giving a speech for us ok if you
guys don't know who Thierry Andriy is
he's like a football legend like a lot
of you should know him guys unless
you're super young but he is ah even got
a cherry Andriy okay roll the clip
but yeah right now clearly gonna go
downstairs guys let's have some fun and
yeah pretty much the plan is we're gonna
be in a hole like yesterday and there
should be some
yo yo yo yo yo like I so right now we're
grouping up for a massive YouTube selfie
a few moments later yo guys the
legendary ornery you ready No thank you
appreciate yo yo Hamza you just met
Ciaran Ruiz what's up I got a bad thing
I got have to say yo on my vlog it he
said no I need to edit my video oh I'm
going back up could I just say I respect
what you do man he's always there going
back into anything his videos you guys
don't see the behind-the-scenes respect
appreciate right now I quickly came back
to the hotel room
oh we just met Thierry on real lucky I
don't love you that our younger might
not know too much about him but he was
basically like the best football player
for Arsenal back in time he is a legend
all right so right now we quickly came
to explore the train station because we
wanted to check it out there heads man
there's massive baby heads over here
like guys I have no idea what type of
ritual this is but this is weird
there's not just one there's two baby
heads oh my god okay guys I don't know
if this is a Spanish thing this looks
freaky okay this is wrong this one is
sleeping and that one easily guys I've
no idea what Spain is about I have no
idea if this is a tradition or a ritual
but there's two baby heads in the middle
of the street all right so we're
literally just walking around but look
at the amount of bikes that they have
parked up in Spain guys what yo I'm
actually serious
why is there so many bikes over here
guys I it doesn't look like a parking
spot it's legit just the pavement so
right now we just made it into the city
center and I hear a lot of people
cheering your case I'm pretty sure it's
something to do with like a football
match I think they're celebrating
something to do with Chelsea winning or
something there's a ton of guys over
there I don't think they'd like me
because today I met an Arsenal player
that's like their rival okay guys so
right now he clearly came into the
center and they have like a ton of
performances going on even salsa dancing
like you so right now she met a bunch of
cool guys what's up guys basically
they're making a youtube channel but
awesome outfits guys peace out I resent
my god look at that
there is a hoverboarding motorcyclist
what that's crazy
holy moly oh wait what
how could he lift his hands up what
right now I actually want to go do some
souvenir shopping guys because I haven't
bought anything and apparently these
fans are like super popular in Spain so
I might get one for my sister guys I
actually want to get myself a magnet for
our fridge because I've never been to
Spain so I think we need a Spanish
magnet right this one actually looks
really nice to get it there it's like a
little bull bro what is that
that's a bullfight you want to get that
as a souvenir
yes another bike Oh guys estefania
estefania guys this is the closest you
can get to Stephanie
there you go that has been our little
exploring for today I know we didn't do
too much but we're just trying to look
around the city and just explore a
little bit basically we spent like two
hours in the souvenir shop because of
one guy over here right now we're having
a little bit of a language barrier so
he's trying to find out basically moving
I have no I have no idea what he's
saying guys okay okay so since it is our
last day in the hotel I actually want to
show you guys something really cool on
each floor they actually have a
different display so this is the fourth
floor that we're on and there's
basketball nets but on the other floors
there's other stuff
