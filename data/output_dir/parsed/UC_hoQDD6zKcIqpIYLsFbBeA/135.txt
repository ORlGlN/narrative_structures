yo come through just so you know there's
gonna be two Bugattis two it's gonna be
two and they told me that this is gonna
be an exclusive cuz I told you guys no
one is allowed to film in here but we
got the hook-up and you know which
Bugatti that is right is that the Chiron
is this your on no way yeah I've never
seen a shot in my life our going there
to check out - oh my God look at that
guy oh my god that's illegal
there's a guy driving over the pavement
holy moly
welcome to the biggest Bugatti show in
the world let's go nigga we made it here
is the baby you can't smell yet on vlogs
one day will happen but the smell in
here is it's perfect yes
so check it out boys here it is the
bugatti chiron this is insane bro do you
imagine this is my first time ever
seeing a Charan no it's a time it's time
I legit feel like a billionaire right
now
we are inside a bugatti chiron right now
this is insane I feel like if I make any
wrong move that's it yeah so one thing I
absolutely love about the Charan is this
line this line is everything right now
that's crazy and what's this button over
here I don't think we should press the
button go you turned off the lights to
the bugatti chiron is it's such a simple
but beautiful car like there's not too
much going on it's just like the perfect
amount so in the middle you have like
four or five buttons no idea what they
do so I'm not gonna touch that like AC
this like the sign that keeps the air in
and this is probably the temperature
control like the only thing things that
you need but where is the radio and all
that that's a very good question
where do you plug in your iPhone whoa
whoa I know the key definitely goes in
here that's the a/c look how cool the AC
is so everything is based on this design
of like that one line one line here one
line on the light so everything is like
super slick I think it's time we
stretched this bad boy on yeah we should
yeah it's time to switch on a bugatti
chiron oh my god are you ready I'm ready
Oh
all the radio and all the navigation
everything is over there so you may sit
go in there you select it and look
that's the navigation in there so my boy
bliss took my turn switching on the car
but now it's time I switched on the
Sharad for how do I do this I just press
Start that's it okay all you have to do
is just press the engine button what did
I do
loud sound this is the the nicest loud
sound I've ever heard in my life I love
how you put it that was the perfect
frame right yeah this is the nicest loud
sound honestly my favorite thing is I
love the red interior they've gone with
it just looks beautiful you guys know my
feeling towards red ya know why my
favorite color is red
we have so much in common did you buy
this car together yeah it's 50/50 this
is our car I just want to sit back here
and just watch the fun for a while like
I'm watching TV bro you promised me to
Bugattis yeah I know
follow me all right are you kidding me I
said - this is this is what you get
before you get your car I didn't lie as
that - guys don't go I am in the
comments I said - and here's the second
one
here's the thing my friend I'm gonna
have to who hooked us up with this visit
here today by the way I'm caged
he is buying a bugatti chiron himself
and he's got his like super custom and
it's a riot and Suman he told me when we
get it he's gonna let us come and check
out the down so our friend boarder
Bugatti yeah yeah I haven't met him yet
but he's my friend now when we get a
chance to meet him he's gonna show you
like an email like they send you all the
details the process it's amazing it's
not it's not like just buying any other
car like he just shows me all the PDF
that they send him of the choice of the
color and all of that and there's a
price tag in there price is up price is
up so there you go guys
my friend technically has a Bugatti
Chiron all right listen we saw the car
but if you want to buy the car because
listen one day we are gonna buy this car
you got to customize it let me take you
over to the section here all right let's
cut
my car the way you wanted yeah well what
color do you want tell me bro green
right now I feel like we should go
something crazy like a green or
something oh now we're talking that's a
carbon fiber green
what are you configuring my new car for
me I like I can give you different
options of green - I told you we'll go
5050 half of the week is with me half
the week it's with you fire I'm down we
can choose two colors two tones so you
go one color I go on color this is like
a computer game like you just wanna say
anything customize your own Bugatti so
one day you just by yourself you know
what I feel like me and bliss need to do
I feel like we need to go to the Bugatti
Factory yes they just showed us a video
it's in France it's like the original
factory from when they first started and
I think we should go there like we gotta
find a hook up or something send us over
there would you guys like that I feel
like if enough if you subscribe to his
channel logo yeah because I told you I
know the guys who owned the Bugatti
showroom over here and divided I have to
her family but if we get enough
subscribers enough heat then maybe I
could talk dinner let's say these a
ballista mauvoisin ago to the Bugatti
show just right please send them to the
factory because if I could show them
that that would be though they might
even get the plane tickets for us so in
case you didn't think this place was
fancy enough check this out guys one
touch that is how you pick the color to
your Bugatti you can see these are all
the pallets of the colors that you can
choose whether its carbon fiber or
regular you can choose like whichever
one you want
guys this yellow is nice I like it
you know it's funny I want it to make
all my cars yellow at one point really
yeah yellow alright anyways but now we
are heading out of the showroom one-loss
look at the Bugatti down I other guys
some words cannot express my feelings
for this car
savage road but yet there's the car for
now I think it's time for us to say
goodbye before we get overly attached so
goodbye Bugatti we'll see you soon all
right anyways there you go that was the
Bugatti showroom in the same Wow see I
just can't I like this is a luxury car
but when you come out of that into this
like this just becomes a regular car
there's nothing it's literally nothing
to feel the same anymore I think we
should do a pay cash for a Bugatti video

told you all I need is on the weekends
I'll eat it just Thursday Friday
Saturday it's yours I'll give you four
days give me three days I'm good with
