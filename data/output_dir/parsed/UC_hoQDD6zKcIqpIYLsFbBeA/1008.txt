getting ready to go so good morning guys
pretty much yesterday I didn't have
enough footage so I'm gonna merge the
bill today's vlog or stuff I'm at home
pretty much not gonna go out but I did
sort out my table and I thought I would
show you guys so yeah there it is
and he described this was not planned I
need to kick him out fair after district
where there's a bite of some wise but
look I've sorted out my table kinda it's
a bit tidy now my playstation I went and
got online for that and those are pretty
much only two games I play and yeah if
any if you play this game you can add me
or ask my name or y'all add you guys to
leave your usernames but yeah this is my
tiny box sorted out I think it looks
really nice
it's my favourite fill in the world the
one dollar bill I don't know I just
think it looks really cool but I have to
cut this really short because my rents
going to go ahead I bite my wires so
yeah I'll see you guys in a bit
so guys I'm making my way over to Jim
right now I'm going alone since neither
my mom or sister wanted to join me so
yeah hopefully I can get a couple of
clips over there and I'm making this
vlog a bit longer for those of you who
wanted to see longer blogs so yeah see
you when I'm there
so I just did one point six kilometres
or one mile I know it's not much but I'm
really off it so that's why I came to
the gym and now if you can see I'm in
these rowing bases and I'm gonna do a
bit of rowing and maybe just some sets
after that and then after now I'm
probably gonna go home and this will be
my first day back at the gym in like 4
months or like 3 months in a long time
and I'm really unfit so I'm in the air
straight into it and yeah hopefully igt
we don't diagnose I'm gonna go take a
shower around you and I'll see you guys
at home so I just finished up at the gym
and I feel amazing the weather is
amazing everything just feels amazing
and it's just that feeling you get after
you just finish a workout and it's just
been tiring and I just think it feels
amazing yes they I do recommend you guys
work out if you have the time -
sometimes it's hard to find time when
you've got like stuff like exams just
because even though you have time you
procrastinate a lot of it and you just
don't want to like fully waste it you
just think staying home will make you
work but it really doesn't oh yeah
having a head off home and yeah see you
guys tomorrow all right guys so I just
got home now and recording the last bit
today's at home I got one of these it's
like 40 packets of crisps of my time I
love it on camera cuz I should never go

big thank you to whoever subscribing to
