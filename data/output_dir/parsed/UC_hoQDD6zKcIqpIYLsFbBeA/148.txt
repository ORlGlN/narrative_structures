you got the phone yeah boy
you already know yo yo yo what is up
everyone welcome to another vlog how are
you doing okay so first things first
before we get into today's vlog you
might be wondering where the hell are we
date they don't know that yeah you don't
know you just gave away everything very
alright now we are actually in a
top-secret location which I will let you
know more about in the next couple of
days but that is not the point
okay because today's video is all about
this bad boy oh yeah today we're
actually gonna be doing something a
little bit different with the iPhone X
we're gonna be doing the water test yeah
no we're gonna be taking the iPhone X
swimming my sister is gonna be taking a
semi yeah because you can't swim you're
trying to say I'm gonna drunk dive in
fact
normally this vote is about a thousand
pounds so you're telling me you're
willing to lose a thousand pounds it's
for the sake of science science the
science of water resistant technology by
the way the intention of today's video
is not to destroy this foam because if
you don't know at the end of the week
after I'm done doing all my tests I'm
giving away this iPhone X so hopefully
by the time I'm done
it still works for the giveaway all
right so before we take this bad boy for
a war test my sister has actually yet to
play around with this phone so we're
gonna let her play around with it and
then we're gonna take it to the water oh
okay the lens looks very different
it's got horizontal vertical right
reviews of the law oh hey are you with a
vertical shaped amber lens oh my god
that's cream though look at that
now if we look at this it feels a bit
more heavier than the regular iPhone so
it kind of feels like they use metal
like heavy dense metal inside this phone
it's actually liar its liar they've
they've said those dark you so my sister
is gonna use the animated emojis for the
first time there's a box what what what
was that who are you sending that to
nobody
I thought you recording the screen you
don't you do a test will the face I do
you recognize me once I removed my
makeup no please no anyways there you go

hotel or about to take the iPhone
swimming in this place oh oh hi guys so

just say your friend is a hundred
mirrors across and you need to chuck him

nothing it's time to throw this phone to
my sister hopefully I get it in the
water okay ready
