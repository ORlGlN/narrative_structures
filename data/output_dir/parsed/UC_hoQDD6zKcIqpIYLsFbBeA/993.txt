good morning guys mo here welcome to
another vlog so today I'm starting the
vlog out skateboarding gonna go around
my area and skateboard a bit for you
guys so yeah let's see how this goes so
I'm currently just skating around my
area and the weather's really hot I
tried to skateboard on the pavements but
it's too bumpy so the road is what I
have to do with pronounced I think I'm
learning pretty good to be honest I'm
quite quite balanced on this at the
moment as I say that I almost knit yeah
I was gonna go around but I just saw
there's no point and I'm just gonna go
circle the streets of my area just
because it's much emptier there's no
cars and stuff so yeah I'm just gonna
practice over here till I get a hang of
it and stuff like that and you probably
see that home OOP alright guys I don't
know if you guys can see it but I am
sweating I keep going outside playing in
this flat ten minutes coming back in to
have a quick drink and I'm absolutely
swaying I'm tired my sister took the
Ranger for service today so that's why
you don't see her the beginning of the
block today so I'm doing my own thing
today I thought she gets back I think
she'll be back in ten minutes anyway so
yeah I'll see you probably when she gets
back I'm not recording with this because
I'm not too good with it I don't want to
fall over or get hit by a car so yeah
once I get back this I will continue
bugging with it but not anymore for
today alright guys my sister got home so
the deranged area pitched no watches

when these guys work so I'll just keep
on new circles around them and I should
have fun like that so we're currently
walking fun I was gonna vlog and you
just ruined it alright guys so we're
currently out on my skateboard catching
up til my sister and this is the lake by
area it's pretty nice right yeah and
then they have found right there and it
was working as soon as I took my camera
out it turned off and so did the lights
around it so that's a shame but yeah I'm
going to go start the run or my
skateboarding scene who knows and we'll
see where it goes from there so we're
currently next to the lake as I said
before my sister was just taking a
couple photos thanks to it they're
sitting down at the bench and look how
bright my skate point is I really like
the fact that it's so bright you can see
it's over you're lost but yeah we should
start running or skateboarding soon in a
couple seconds once she finishes taking
our photo so yeah there's some bombers
at the lake look right there you can
kind of see something that's supposed to
be in the lake it should be on but they
just literally just turned off and it
should be like a fowling going up there
we haven't stopped logging everyone's
leaving right let's go guys okay no
let's not go let's listen let's watch
let's let's watch her try my skateboard
this is some
all right let me try and help you I find
I do in Chinese see I can blog without
even leading the world oh there
currently next to ed elite that actually
has a working fountain there's going to
be a long wind noise but yeah there you
can see and that's a lot of share side
road which is a really nice view
so hopefully the wind isn't really
annoying I'm going to cut the clip just
because it's going to be so loud and
annoying so guys we just got home that
is the end of the vlog today's vlog has
been a fitness blog pretty much all of
it my sister's legs are tearing red

when I started running is I just sweat a
lot and it really itches so you just
itch it but yeah hopefully you guys
