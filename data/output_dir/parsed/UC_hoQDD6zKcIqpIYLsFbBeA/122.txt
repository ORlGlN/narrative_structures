can be done over here in the key of so
for now we're heading out and lieutenant
happens gonna show us some more over
here so let's go
so this chaos can be
oh wow okay our voice so here goes
nothing right now me and my sister are
going to go for a ride in the police
supercars it's time to have a day in the
life of a police officer
yeah
here goes nothing I never thought I'd do
this but I'm getting inside a McLaren
police car let's go okay right now we're
about to go for a ride in this supercar
so
so right now I'm inside the car with
lieutenant solid he's gonna be taking us
around and it's gonna be a day in the
life of police yeah right now we're in
the Boyd Buddhist McLaren and we go
around the city walk so since we're here
guys I shall ask a couple of questions
that I'm curious about so my first
question what is like the daily routine
as like a police officer
the daily routine here we're having the
tourist police
we drive these supercars and go to the
tourist location argilac jbr boulevard
way mode and we stay there and help to
list if they need any help or any
trouble
ah so that's pretty interesting so it's
more like just showing them to buy and
being kind yeah I'm like super excited
just seeing these cars wow so but yeah
they must be in like shock to see such
cool supercar is especially like police
supercars you know and they shock would
say ladies oh my god you know I never
knew they're like there's a lady
supercar that is so cool like to have
Lisa research supercar drivers who are
women and you know I love that because
they don't also I love supercars so
seeing this here's the thing in case you
guys don't know in Dubai there's
actually a lot of the vibe for these
supercars but what I want to know is how
many are there there are 14 cars but
each one is different starting from the
Bugatti and this one right now we have
the latest one the McLaren the 570 a
one-day resurrect of collection
aasta.martin Lamborghini Ferrari like
you saw the SLS and we have a Bentley
and there is a GTR goes on Wow do you
know any like secret information like if
they're gonna get the new Bugatti that
that's top secret guy that's top secret
but they have a ton of crazy supercars
that's insane and they just keep adding
to make it even cooler so it's really
nice flight tourists I come here because
I don't think anywhere in the world you
get this many police supercar so that's
really cool so before our journey ends
in this supercar the last question I
actually want to ask and this is more
for you guys what is like the main
message you guys want to send out as
police that we are here to help them
yeah we don't want them to fear us for
now we're just about to come back to our
spot guys super awesome being in this
