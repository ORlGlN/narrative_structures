yo yo everyone good morning and welcome
to another vlog so I'm gonna be
completely honest with you guys I am
super super tired right now this morning
I had somebody come by and check out the
car but they didn't want if you guys
didn't know I put this car online for
the past a week or like a classified ad
so far I had two people come by and they
just both they don't want it anyways
instead what I'm gonna do is because my
friend actually called me today and she
really wants the car sold as soon as
possible so I'm gonna head over me out
with one of my friends and we're just
gonna go to the dealers and see if
they'll buy it so let's go and see
what's up I just made it over to my boy
right now there is no good buddy what up
let's go you know her going oh semi
alright let's Google mater sorry right -
this is the struggle of finding the
dealers baby
yo guys I swear we're in the middle of
like nowhere right now and this is what
Google Maps is bronze the selva car look
at what it says on the GPS it's a
straight ok lets straight into the palm
trees I guess oh my god we're gonna
sound before the cameras eye bro we're
definitely - here you turn from yeah
this is somebody's hell yeah this is
somebody's like farm where the hell did
we come all right what's up guys
hello camels did you want the car I'm
sorry not s l have no idea where we go
is this a prank you just drove 45
minutes out here okay well we gotta
figure out
I see Larry camels for yourself we are
currently completely lost guys and I
mean badly like we have no idea where
we're going
I told me is it Ella we're yeah
dealership all our we're used car but
then it's saying here that it's actually
a Russell 400 what we found it the car
dealer haven't landed we made it we make
it it yes all right so I think we
actually came to the wrong area like
they don't actually buy these cars over
here so we actually need to go to like
it's not farther it's like kind of in
this area but just like a different
section we all want to sit because
they're okay about three hours later we
are finally where we're supposed to be
if you can see all the cars around me so
let's see if they buy the car I mean
they have a really similar one to ours
over here so that's a good sign right
kinda today's turned into like a dilemma
like we went to a camel farm trying to
sell a car then we ended up going to
like the wrong place like three times i
boy so we're just in the showroom now my
boy Moe is talking to them let's see
maybe we could trade the car in for one
of these bad boys I mean Range Rover for
Ferrari maybe baby
Ranger for the vent or maybe OC I don't
know I care my boys just asking them I
think the person that values it's coming
in like 10 minutes so we'll see how much
they try and give us or if they give us
anything good then the car is gone but
yeah who knows if they give me an
Aventador Ferrari I'm gone today what's
up what's the deal so basically
they don't like us just like no bro we
don't buy your phone on my why not
so now we're just not gonna buy a Range
Rover we have mostly new cars
what about all these new cars are here
like the haters mad they know the
jacking the coke I want to use all right
try something else alive well let's walk
across over here but this is a way of
him saying no he doesn't want it and
then he was just like oh this one so
he's looking at it looking at the specs
look at that license plate checking up
has any damages day I said had I was
done we're on our way back he's gonna
come and blow bottles watch I know I
know I gave my boy I think because she's
good at negotiation he knows the tactics
they use they just told us no but the
guy came outside now and he's checking
out the car so that one I'm like yeah I
was only outside why if they don't want
the car ID why else come under you that
they're checking our car not how you
want it yeah yeah okay
straight out we got it these guys are
sleeping room they don't even buy cars
wonder what you would have done it you
came alone
we picked the worst day for this boys it
is burning 90% humidity frickin 45
degrees y'all by the way guys this car
is just the beast they have over here
like look at this it's like a tank
Hummer six point five liter turbo diesel
what the SH - original age - dang son
it's like a army vehicle in here so far
unlucky we didn't get the Aventador for
the car over 404 water my just died am i
we're quite tired dehydration oh yo we
just had the maddest thing I don't even
know I want to thank guys so my friend
like once around 120 ish for the scarf
at the Mon I don't even think I can get
120 I just got offered 85 85 and that
was like max they said like that's after
we talked to them so holy moly we are in
for a vowel can mo do it can you sell
the car oh my this is mo as well guys so
when I say much both devices
oh my Kendall
do it wow this is a maestro stretch do
you think they'll give us give us four
like yeah yeah like the Range Rover for
this rolls-royce why not let's go I
think I think we got the bargaining
power but dying the bargaining power is
dire here said 85 he said he sold the
Autobiography yesterday just yesterday
you know I think maybe just maybe they
might give us this one what Percy told
me is too much I'm like oh wait okay so
what happened I didn't realize I was on
the phone guys yeah he's like it's like
no no you won't get that much nice he's
hot so you told him how much I told him
125 he's like okay just bring it just
bring it and we'll check it out
you are drenched why huh Wow
never worked so hard in my life turn as
a CEO what are you doing here well yeah

like something feels like a hundred for

negotiate up to 110 yeah that's not even
worth negotiating right but like he said

other the first first guy we said said
85 oh we're just going down down on the

parking lot and somebody came up much to
be in the nose
I'm completely joking guys I had one of
the worst nosebleeds I've ever had and
you can probably tell like my mom's
panicking right now she was like what's
happening but uh anyways thankfully it
stopped lighting everything it was gonna
stop it's been like going for like 25
minutes and they were just quickly
cleaning up my hands anyways I thought
share that with you guys because I don't
think many of you would know I have like
bad problems with nosebleeds I used to
get them every day but thankfully now
I'm okay they got my hands clean or you
got home and it's so adorable because
bubbles normally like runs when we get
home but that's how tired he is you know
