hey yo yo yo everyone welcome to another
vlog so how are you all doing we started
today with my emo what's up swagalicious
we out here we're actually gonna head
off to the post office not really
because of the mail I'm actually
expecting something from Google and I'll
tell you more about if I do get it cuz
I've been waiting for this for a long
time but I'm actually really excited
because today if you haven't forgotten
we're going for the Batman vs Superman
premiere how did I get invited I don't
know I don't know it's me Mom oh my
sister and one of my friends is coming
along as well so should be dope and I
heard like other youtubers from Dubai
are coming so you know there might be
like a YouTube fest type thing going on
there
we'll see anyways let's head out so post
office see what's up over there yeah
let's go alright we're at the post
office with my mummy for once
she hasn't come here a lot like I think
the last time she was here is where we
had the Range Rover right no oh you came
with Lana once are you with the Lambo so
let's go see what's up just for good
luck I'm gonna let my mum open the box
maybe we'll get some stuff I don't think
she's ever actually opened to have you
know okay this first time first time
lucky I it's the one with the sticker on
it salad okay go for it mommy
go for it we got anything okay stop
joking Brad Wow
okay not bad at all is that it you're
unlucky man I'm just kidding that's a
she quite a bit I'm kind of sad though I
didn't get what I wanted from Google sir
I'm not telling you what it is until I
get it guys I have to get it in order to
tell you I'm away for this thing so long
and it's not really something exciting
like it's not a big object or anything
really visual but I'll make sense of it
when it gets here
so we just stopped at our local shop to
do bit shopping you know how it goes
first of all I think so my mom is buying
me a little you know deodorant but
secondly I'm actually excited cuz you
know cereal like cornflakes and stuff I
saw lately they don't have poisoned them
and this one actually does so that's
really really awesome can't wait to open
up and see what the toys it's like some
ball
and how use it and the final thing I'm
really excited about you know the other
day when I washed my car guys I didn't
have a proper sponge I was using you
know the little dishwashing sponge by
found an actual car washing sponge over
here so let's take this go home I'm
gonna wash the car today
I completely forgot to show you guys
what's in the corvex but look our corn
flakes covered prob it looks like we're
feeding a whole country anyone who has
all of these correlations I don't even
know anyway this is the new one we got I
just want the toy to be us now save the
corn flakes so basically this bowl came
in there I feels like a hard thing but
it's like a sack you see that
I remember having something exactly like
this and I was a kid from a corn flakes
packet it's just like it little sacks
Ustadh let's see oh we bought it out
here being completely honest I was
expecting something a bit better than
this man what the hell took a tiny sack
and it's barely got any of them things
inside it should be right there oh oh
you guys probably wondering is that Toby
no that's actually bubbles sleeping
outside hey get back inside no no no I
hate you since I am going out today with
my car and I didn't really wash it
properly the last time you washed it
this time I'm coming in loaded with some
proper equipment
I bought this pond if I don't think I'm
gonna use that because I just found out
my sister at some like professional
cleaning equipment which she's never
used obviously so look at this stuff
she's got sprays like these are proper
professional like detailing sprays she's
got microfiber cloths and who knows what
this stuff is so me and my mom are gonna
give my car a proper wash right now okay
or at least we're gonna try to so I hope
I don't get as many bad comment saying
you did it wrong again what the hell are
you
let's go how I don't even know if this
is meant to wash your car or it's some
sort of wax who can we're just going to
use a gauge because on most refresh them
car washer is that nothing on the floor
by the way no I'm going to start off by
watering down my car
I think I'm supposed to use this thing
on the clock how many strays the idea a
couple practice ain't working on me yeah
Trotter's ain't working then this one
turn what my campus Oh
so you find your way back
after like an hour I finally kind of
washed the car it actually looks pretty
shiny there we go all right good job

I say it's really cool to walk in an
empty more because I think it's actually
wait is it quite it's 11 o'clock right
okay it's not that late I thought I was
like 1 o'clock for some reason I saw
yeah I haven't been to a movie and like
such a long time
that that felt so long for me like that
movie felt like it was years to me just
that I haven't been in so long
this is what you call she only wore
those shoes to look good and now she's
got the flip-flops on boy how could she
take them off and be like I'm swapping
what are those what are those hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah the food court is
open guys oh my god we get to eat today
and is I'm going down there for like the
fast food section you can stay in the
Chinese section and yeah catch you soon
yep that rule fish type of diet as you
can see very is it healthy free or is it
don't forget guys sanitize your hands
before you eat
germs are the killer ones okay bacteria
that okay why did you not sanitize me
you're about to eat don't even hi
you just heard me yeah my mom's taking a
look at what a goodies they are so
that's the crisper what else came in
here no no
we go to Batman vs Superman diary yo oh
my god what are you doing mommy why did
you chop the crisps
it is a diary whoa
she's a window shopper then a nanana
nanan what are you looking at automata
spring yet guys those watches are
probably like 4000 pounds at least
my sister is legit contemplating to rob
the stores like wouldn't it be cool like
if nobody was in the morning you can
just go into shops and take everything
that's good stealing okay it's good oh
yeah I want to show you how late is that
no more because the valley is completely
empty but look at this place
you're by the way before you go I want
to show them something come back come
back come back hey this is the valley
guys but look there is a valet seating
area over here that is normally full of
people that give their cars in for valet
but right now it's empty
we found the lounge yeah that's the
valet people so when they're waiting for
their car to come
they just sit here this looks more like
the movie premiere than anything you
know it is a great dark event me and my
sister actually have a hypothesis
basically we watched the premiere in 3d
my sister says she thinks it was in 3d
so people can't record it that makes
sense right because when it's in 3d
like the image is blurry and I think
that's why we watch 3d and open what are
you doing what is this all about
but yeah the only thing that guys I
think we watched in 3d so it's not
anybody like videoing it leaking the
film early if you know so that's
actually pretty smart
my eyes actually hurt really really bad
after that movie
look what we have to do recovering you
with a hot towel like it is burning I
saw in the movie I had to keep taking
off my 3d glasses cuz that's how bad it
hurt do I look weird mummy I don't
normally the vlog all right I'll let
normal I guess ah my eyeballs wow that
does go back that feels much better
anyways I hope you have enjoyed today's
vlog everybody if you have you know what
to do I actually did it end up opening
the post you guys gave us I might save
until we go collect more might open it
tomorrow who knows we can do anything
but see you guys more for another boy I
swear like I don't think I'm going to go
for a movie in a while just because with
YouTube and all the editing I do already
stare at screen so much so I think going
for a movie extra actually does like
affect my eyes a lot anyways besides of
that I see you all tomorrow love you all
stay awesome today was my first ever
movie premiere I've been to no school
just getting like all of that I'm VIP
treatment all the snacks you get that
little red carpet you were gone and yet
stuff like that was cool but anyways it
was awesome regardless huge thank you to
people buying us down at the box cinemas
I think are about the best names but
yeah super awesome see you guys support
yelling oh no
good bye
