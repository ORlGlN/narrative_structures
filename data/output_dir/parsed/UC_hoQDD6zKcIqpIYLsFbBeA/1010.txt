good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog and today as all of you guys
requested we're taking out the Lambo
we're taking it for a car wash as you
can see it's not the cleanest that's the
homeless cat we always feed over there
we just read it now but are we taking
this bad boy for a wash getting them all
cleaned out and then going to valet to
Mall of the Emirates which a lot of you
might know and you're just going to
chill there for today so yeah let's go
and yeah come with us all right guys
let's get going this is how you open the
door you push on this side handle comes
out and the doors open and this is the
Alcantara interior that we've got
customed I think it looks pretty good
right but yeah let's go in I'm gonna go
round guys and turn on the car so yes
startup time let's get in to the low
seats but yeah I got the keys here I
don't think I need the keys how do I
turn on all right so all right so you

foot on the brake and press the start
button

you the interior of the car these
switches do a lot of things which I
might explain to you guys later but yeah

think it's a good angle right in the car
being my sister obviously there's hurt
oh my god cameras money so much my
tired go on one side that is the true
story her wonderful tires oh hi guys
I've resulted to hold it in my hand
because it slides around everywhere in
the front I was putting it there in the
front but there's no point we're driving
past our area and there's so many speed
bumps let me go and turn it back onto me
so yeah we can't really put the camera
and your I just have to hold it in my
hand and make do for now I'm gonna put
on some music and have fun so I'll see
you guys in a couple of minutes
hi guys so we're on our way to the car

be there in half an hour but we're
making our way through Sheikh Zayed Road
