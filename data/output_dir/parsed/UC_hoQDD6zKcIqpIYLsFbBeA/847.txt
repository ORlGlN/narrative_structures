basically I can't speak I can't speak
today as you can see I've changed up my
clothes the reason I've changed is
because me and my mom are gonna head out

today and kind of fixed up the house
we're like why don't just go all out and
fix everything up so we need a carpet
that's like a priority and we still
don't have one we're gonna take some
measurements at the moment with my mom
so let's do that and then we can go buy
like a little carpet to put here and

something in here
who created that to agent it she's got a
big booger coming out I know what you do
with it you put on it so I want to buy
this hat which my love's way I swear it

doesn't mean look at it and I lick it
off me okay look at me
but at the same time I just feel weird I
don't know I should kind of like the red
lot more now I don't know why I think it
suits me a bit more though
thank ya but I'm gonna decide it looks
much better on my mum though I should
give the Jimmy a Ferrari models er
Ferrari if you're hiring you know my mum
could just wear the hat Somali well
isn't it I'm kidding I'm kidding but
seriously Ferrari I've just been getting
a couple snapchats and black has been
dominating the hood like seriously
domine I think seven people said black
and two people said red so far I'm still
gonna see what are you a big I reckon
I'm going to go back to the back one and
actually a couple of you did say both
but I think the black one is gonna win
okay we're leaving with no carpet and no
hat I'm gonna tell you the reason I
doing a hat on snapchat
additionally everyone black black black
black black bold black backpack got to
the food court started checking the
boats again red red red red red red red
and I was like wait how does this happen
how does everyone suddenly see black and
then everyone says red so instead I
asked the person that works there they
said the sale is gonna be on for at
least another week so I'm gonna leave a
comment in the comment section one
saying red and one saying black so I
want you guys to thumbs up each one
whichever one you want so if you want me
