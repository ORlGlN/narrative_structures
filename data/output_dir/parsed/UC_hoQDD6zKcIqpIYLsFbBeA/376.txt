sand going on my clothes so I'm gonna
head back inside guys
I just thought quickly come outside and
drips this bad boy in the sand and yeah
anyways good morning I never said that

oh I think I made a pretty dumb decision
punching with no gloves guys ah I ripped
my skin in oh my finger is so messed up
right now look at that I mean look what
happened to my hand
the first thing I'm actually going to be
doing today is we're gonna go out and
buy some current now the thing is at the
moment my room has no curtains
whatsoever so when I'm coming out the
shower and naked like this everybody can
literally see me guys look at this
so I'm kidding I don't come out of the
shower naked but you know what I'm
trying to say guys I need a bit of
privacy in my room so we have to go get
some curtains right now
miss go curtain shopping mommy what are
you doing to my car
what's wrong yo I might be 100 with you
guys I'm not joking this car is growing
on me so much like I love it I feel like
it's becoming addicting driving this car
so yeah harsh so we just went over to
the shopping center and look what I have
to see in front of me guys I fled this
car is gonna walk me for the rest of my
life selling the Ferrari they should
play out everywhere has to be right in
front of me as right in front of me ah
crazy lucky so just looking by the
Leviton store and look display they have
over here yo that is the freakiest thing
I've ever seen in my life what the eyes
are moving first I can I saw I lost my
mind I saw them moving and they stopped
and all day oh wait a second that's
crazy that's where we're at and so right
now me and my mum are looking through
the furniture store and they have the
coolest kids bed

it's even got like a race suit as your
covers Wow if you look at the wall over
here they've literally made a whole race
track guys I look this thing defies
gravity right killer it actually comes
out okay so we just found out the
coolest thing about this bed

happens when he hit the button guys yo
I'm legit done this bed does everything
anyways that is the coolest thing ever
for now let's continue current shopping
we're just getting distracted on the way
again we have a slight little problem at
the moment the thing is the currents I
have at the moment or dark blue but they
don't have any more of them right now so
yeah I guess the neighbors just have to
keep seeing me naked when I come out the
bathroom oh my god the action right here

right okay I'm done so right now he
quickly came to buy me some t-shirts but
I don't know why recently I've been
