so we're not actually doing the event on
the national day hope that cleared it up

we need to rush to get the business
cards it's kind of late and they're
going to shut down soon hi too messy
messy day I'm sorry about the blog
people I'm really sorry look how dark it
is in this car trying to see outside yet
this much of a view this much we have to
bring the windows down
got a door throw my mind dirty
cancel out my eggs
that's a really cool building
oh alright this seems like a tight
parking he found it finally taught me to
get out and said earthing barking thanks
parking brake and now you get the ticket
jumps you get out window da we got it
the struggles of being in the Lambo Oh
what it doesn't give out ticket
you need something just great it doesn't
let us go in it just does it we press
the button nothing happens
gender reversed before any other car
comes behind us
finally found the parking was in some
valley park you know very cheap actually
was like 20 per hour but I think this is
going straight then right and left
somewhere along here so please let's not
get lost anymore
yeah okay yeah actually is all right we
finally found the place it was right
over there my sister got her business
cards it's in her little packet ah such
a stressful there I'm apologize for the
vlog up till now because when you're
busy I don't know you just forget about
what you know you forget there's nothing
to do we're stuck in traffic for like an
hour circling the place because we have
no idea where the building was we just
found the valet just quickly gave it and
even though we had like one minute of
work here ah okay anyways let's continue
today hopefully it can be a bit more
upbeat and exciting from now it's our
cars down here that was like the
shortest vanator probably like did you
come to the wrong place so imagine
my camera always does this it doesn't
open right
three resources Ferrari
what
one imagined for expert
ha alleged The Rake's no longer will be
dead like Rajan is the razor were and
who's stuck on the pedal like what would
you do in that scenario that scenario
I'll say we jump like see where if you
jump out you're dead
no no you jump before you hit a junction
we stopped by the petrol station to
obviously get some petrol since we are
going to go to that event we figured
it'd be better if the car is full on
petrol there's a car being pumped up I'm
going to go stay inside
I just realized you played no music
since you enter that business card place
we completely forgot you're so like in a
rush like where is it it was like in our
heart you just met like what I'm alone
normally when it comes to these cards I
don't seem to listen to music but
somehow with other cars I just love
you wanna lose it - yeah
it's a quiet place because it's just
everything's too
so we're actually heading back out
straight away we just came to part in
Lambeau cover up and then we're going to
head out with the Range Rover my mom is
at Mall of the Emirates we're going to
pick her up at one point anyways but
yeah for now let's just go I'm gonna put
my camera on charge while I'm inside
just in case it runs out and it is come
on back it up okay we got a bunch of cat
food this is how much cat food we got er
hidden there's a feast tonight boys
that's it
yeah we're at the mall I'm trying to
cool someone to watch the guy okay
please anyways you just got sort of more
I wanted to watch the car normally
there's so many people that want to
watch the car like to be working here
but the first time when I wash it nobody
and legit tried to walk around and one
of them was busy working so I didn't ask
you anyway let's go find my mom so we've
come to a restaurant to eat but my
sister wants to show you her business
cards they've actually laminated and
we're trying to see how it look without
lamination joining another close up with
the lamination
business is just
in treasure like a demo version for now
by the way it's not blank the other side
as writing on it we're just not showing
it because all the details okay now
remove the lamination termination
let me feel okay and then see I told you
it's laminated it feels a bit like more
flux under plastic you look at this is
very soon yeah this is something this
feels like rock guys we're shopping for
a dress for my mom so you know your boys
here for a modeling shoot at Dior no I'm
just here because my sister wants my
makeup as always today we've done a lot
of things even though I don't think I've
done a lot or you can write it it feels
weird like when you've done a lot but
you haven't done a lot would you let me
sleep oh it's palms are sweaty knees
weak arms are heavy and fun we want a
sweater already mom's spaghetti he's
nervous but on the surface he looks calm
and ready to drop bombs forgetting the
words mean come out he's choking how
everybody's joking now
favorite song ever and you guys want to
wrap up today's blog here I've kind of
been looking at my sister's business
cards no just looking so cool like when
you have loads and loads of business
cards anyways I'm gonna wrap up today's
vlog here sorry it's been so messy

mean 12 Lamborghinis just to make the
flag and beside from that there's going
to be a load more so there's just 12 to
