yo everyone what is up welcome back to
another vlog so today is about to be a
special day let's just start off with
the fact that we have this and you might
be wondering why we have an Aventador SV
with us today you know why because we're
savages okay so basically today is aid
in case you guys don't know what that is
it's pretty much like the Muslim
equivalent to Christmas but we're about
to prank my sister by saying we got this
for her gift again to be honest if she
believes us she's gonna be pretty dumb
because I don't buy people gifts like
this and I'm just sayin so we're gonna
go and let's see how it works guys holy
moly this car is beautiful guys I love
it
in case you're wondering how I got it
guys you already know I went to my
friends at deals on wheels as I listen
it's Eid please just lend me a car as a
present so they did yo I'm sorry for
being such a savage guys but if you
don't know this is both me and my
sister's dream car so hopefully it'll be
a little bit believable okay hey
okay I know this is really savage guys I
think if we have a boat it's going to be
way more believable I guess this is so
mean there's no need if we find you a to
inside the house right now I'm going to
go over to my sister's room the thing is
I'm going to speak very seriously so if
it doesn't sound like what I normally
sound like it's just because I'm trying
to be convincing okay so yeah I'll be
vlogging it was a bit low I have a
surprise for you
it's eight today and I got you a gift
I got you a gift okay but I have a
blindfold yesterday they asked me how
are you that you're fine they are not
really funny you just can't get into it
they would never understand I did before
I think my sister's to see her gift
guide my sister always helps me out with
all my videos and I feel like she
deserves this gift so I know she's not
thinking me losing right now but
honestly you guys know how much she does
for us so you're never nice to me this
is where I feel like she's a lot you
know if you do something silly I will be
mad at you for like a month and I will
never come downstairs ever again you can
take your blindfold off now oh this is
an s3 that's for you for me
yeah this is for you mom anything
serious I know you've always wanted an
SV and I feel like you deserve one so a
Provari

that I'm not even joking this is my
sister's card you like you I'm shaking

savage yeah I just know my sister was
getting emotional there's actually a
reason I got the card oh it's for my boy
