are you alone on Valentine's Day do you
have nobody to buy you presents good
morning everyone and welcome to another
vlog so we're quickly actually going to
rush over to the appeal boxes because we
got three packages and we decided to
take the Lambo out it's been a long time
so let's go on a heck of a ride
anyways it's been a ridiculously long
time since we've been out with this car
I don't know why I think the Mustang is
just taking over so let's get headed and
go out obviously since we're taking this
car I had to come in my Lambo swag
that noise is so much from outside if
you listen to these guys
the hell inside cycle
life can flip in a matter of seconds
one morning you're waking up in projects
the one points in the dot-com
Oh
let's change up the Sun guys all right
we made it here boys let's see what's up
I have a little bit of an announcement
to say I might stop doing like male
times and just open what we get when we
get it let's see how that goes for a
while and if I see you guys won't like a
whole melt I'm back now we can change
back to that but for now let's get into
the pure box see there's not mail but
there's packages okay that's one time
how to do real time wow it's so sunny
outside we went in and this is what we
got so there wasn't any big packages
there's one more we can't get because we
have to go to the central post office so
I think we'll open all of these as soon
as we get home this one feels weird like
those cushiony is the packages used to
fight I was shaking there's some I think
it's a box though yeah I think it's a
box like maybe like a little you know a
little Valentine's gift Oh imagine our
Noddy so funny
Lana's got a Valentine gift learners
good a Valentine gift this is a
Valentine's gift I think it is you know
feeling it's like a box it feels like
you know like a necklace box or like a
little wrist band mugs it says more
vlogs so clearly it's not for long I'm
warming up oh maybe more boys got a
Valentine's gift you're not ladies send
anything my way yeah I'm free for
Valentine's Day and you know what to do
okay we need to get rid of this music
cuz I'm very sad right now it's like all
this emotional musing let's go
alright boys we are finally home we got
a couple pieces I think I'll just open
them up quickly inside and see what's in
them I'm so hungry I'm just starving
like I think my obesity levels are
hitting an all-time high squat goals my
sister's car is actually running low on
water for a windscreen wipers and this
is the only source we can get oh yeah
where did you fill it up by the way yeah
I don't think that's the smartest idea
to do straight out the hose just know
this one is more capacity no that's good
trust me that's better than putting your
hose in there and try and closing on
time that's as low as you're gonna get
it how would ya go stop it go stop it
thinking that is where the windscreen
wiper goes by the way guys that's how
you fill it okay should I go over there
and quickly close it if you need it
see you guys we're using my idea now oh
is it good
finished
oh my god one it says it love it slow
down
Oh Oh my bad you doing perfect very
carefully there it goes
anyways there you go guys that's been
the tutorial how to fill your
Lamborghini she started out with the
hose then she went on to a cup and
finally the thing you used to heat up
tea or keep it hot lie on feed the
animals water is life they don't want
you to have life oh boy guys this is why

lapsing who still so yeah yeah but still
I have Bay's on the internet you have
nobody like you're just yeah so you know
we out here doing kind of times day big
oh okay huh what is that it's a case a
phone case and there's two I'm guessing
one for me and one for you
I'm guessing basically your eyes I think
you can stick your whole like to any
surface and then like take selfies watch
stuff no that is right cool it's just
watching a video like on the mirror I
remember I needed one of these but I
just don't remember where I could have
used it so basically guys this is very
useful for me because when I when I'm
upstairs in the toilet you know taking a
number two I can just put it on good oh
that is so it's useful though i watch
videos when I'm doing my number twos so
this kid I can stick my phone and his
hands-free thank you so much Johnny or
so it's true though I could use this
what is that sound I think somebody's
peeing in the garden yeah this is
sprinklers no but you could stick this
to the window and record okay I know
that's do I it says it here look so
thank you so so much to Abdul Rahman for
sending these by let's open them up and
see if we can use them right now I'm
checking out you're taking yours off oh
she peeled the stickiness yeah it's like
a let's go put on the window let's come
come let's go let's see how this works
boom okay push it hard and now there we
go nice that's good it's actually pretty
hard like it's not coming off oh yeah
it's really cool okay brough you're
gonna break the window soon and it's
thanks a lot really awesome cases and
that concludes our mail time today so
you want to take a watch videos - I
knew it I knew it I gave you an idea
thank you for the awesome gifts Inc I'll
see you guys for the rest of the vlog
peace I can let me go you just in toilet
be right back
we found a new idea for this case guys
look at this imagine give it as a gift
give it as a gift to a friend put their
phone down and look what happens guys so
imagine you're at a restaurant and then
they come to pick up their phone they're
like what the hell is this it's stuck
what I imagine they will flip out okay
wait let me try this your heart is yo
it's actually like ah it's pretty hard
if you don't know what's going on my
auntie bev solution if you're sitting in
the restaurant and you want to put your
phone look away come to sing it so i'll
try to take your phone yeah they can't
take it easily tell me if you can spot
what i'm looking at guys grumpy hello
grumpy he's actually less scared of me
what's up oh he's not moving
look at him he's not moving he's
actually just saying their handshake
okay no y-you see you're the one who
scared him just to get down low on it
it's gonna be almost animal okay yeah
this is a dumb idea anyways make sure
you just attacks my head while my mom is
just are in the bank I thought I'd come
for my laptop in my car because she's
just like weighing me down and it's so
heavy and the reason I took is because I
was doing a bit editing that's your
really nice GTR behind my car but let's
put this in
car by the way here you go this is the
black gt-r solving now I really loved
these GTR that is they're really
gorgeous to be honest and it is let's
get back to my own sister so banks take
so long my just going in there and
wanting to do something cuz they're so
busy just like there's some Chinese
celebration thing going on I think the
Chinese New Year in the makeup store so

sure if I'm allowed to take chocolate
