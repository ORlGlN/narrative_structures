hey guys what is up mo here and welcome
to another vlog now I'm outside I'm
about to go out today I'm only here for
another two days I'm just gonna go ahead
and show you my view we've got the Lambo
here we got the range opposite it
looking beautiful and yeah I said my
last stop my last I'm going away on the
8th and today's like the sixth or the
seventh but yeah I'm only here for like
another two days I'm kind of sad I'm
going to be missing this car just looks
through amazing and I've been out with
it quite a bit here I'm gonna drive it
today a big at night or two more maybe
and when I have time just to drive for
once cuz I haven't really been driving
out like I haven't driven it just
because I've been really busy and stuff
and also my sister's been busy I will
continue vlogging once we go out
hopefully you guys have enjoyed the past
few vlogs I've made here hopefully
they've been a bit more interesting than
once I made in England or London but I
will be vlogging my journey back and
yeah hopefully as I said you enjoyed
them so yeah peace out guys guys Lambo
is open my sister's getting ready to
take an Instagram for another reason to
follow her because she takes really nice
photos and the interior again you guys
must have seen it before when I didn't
get in it but look there is again looks
beautiful what material is it by the way
for the interior its Alcantara the plan
is quite expensive that material like
it's more than if you want to get a
leather interior but it does look really
nice but it is very delicate I think it
rips quite easily oh yes see I soon okay
guys we are on our way out with my
family me my mom and my sister that
you're in so I think you can see my mom
oh yeah we have to wait for the gate to
get opened we're going out to a mall
today is not even the one but they're
not opening the door
come on get out security please alright
let's wave but yeah we're going to the
mall maybe do some shopping see what is
going on maybe have a bit of lunch or
dinner I don't even know what time it is
to like what I'm here it feels like it's
really early when it's really Taylor
where is five o'clock I feel like it's
like 12:00 or 1:00 we are gonna go to
the 1 o clock their little hopefully the
quality of this camera is better than my
phone and this is the new vlogging
camera icon and left that my sister
tries so badly is actually a joke yeah
yeah I never expose you guys the
interior off the range of this was very
nice as you guys can see and it's got
loads of space compared to the Lambo
which has both space and you can
literally fly over bumps like not fly
but it's not either lamb or you have to
slow down like really really home you
can just literally just go over them and
nothing happens but yeah they say oh my
god there's so much Sun if you guys
can't even see it the one throughout
I'll continue vlogging on the highway
and I'll see you guys soon peace hey
