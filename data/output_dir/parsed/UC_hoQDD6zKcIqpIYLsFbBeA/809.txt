good morning guys and welcome to another
vlog I know this is a weird place to
start the vlog but we're kind of in a
rush what do we need to do today
so we need to register the car
my is a car registration basically is
called like a milky car is a car
registration card car
it's a car's registration boys it cuz
it's been one year
yeah it's Rory I've got the car for one
your second can you believe that guys
it's been one year with the Lamborghini
anyways I thought it's really cool cuz
today I'm pimped out with everything you
guys have sent me like the watch from my
boys IV air this shirt from my boy wash
it like damn bro I can imagine one day
I'm gonna be pimped out with like loads
of things from you guys will just be
like wearing subscribers clothes I don't
know what it would be like okay so you
finally made it to the RTA guys it is so
so sunny and I forgot my glasses I can't
look at this parking we did how tight is
that on this edge oh well we had to
because the type the parking was kind of
tight and we wanted to have as much that
side as we can
our signature Tunnel Rock
I'm sorry since we've been there for
services so much louder guys they
refreshed it
we absolutely curbed the Lamborghini
like scrape to the bottom off but
thankfully it's not on the side I'm
going to show you if you can see that
I'm not too sure that's not that bad
there's only the Rings we can get that
colored but look at this do you see that
oh that is so deep okay we're gonna get
that sorted out you see that's the
problem of having cars this low like
anything you'll curb the car like it was
just a little a little edge and the
cards went and we were like no but
thankfully thankfully it wasn't too high
and we only really got the rings that's
the only problem and look the car you
really can't see that because it's all
the way under it but still kind of sharp
you know I'm trying to feel it out is
that it yeah I think that's pretty much
it just is under edge but enough of that
we did get our sticker basically you
stick this on to show that you've
registered your car yeah that's too
close yeah that's fine yeah put it there
so time to stick our registration
sticker if you got to sticker off now it
is newly registered do you hear that
I got me to tell you a story not just
because of what happened right now but
we're the worst when it comes to luck in
owning cars and I'll tell you why so if
you guys knew like when I was in London
I had a Mercedes when I first bought my
Mercedes within the first week I had
someone hit me in the back like mid
traffic the cars weren't moving and my
luck some guy just drove into the back
of me and I was with my friends they
initially thought I switched off because
they didn't know is automatic they're
like is it a manual like did you just do
something because we all jumped in mid
traffic so you wouldn't really expect it
and then I was like no the guy behind me
must have hit me we come out and we get
hit and now we've crashed the
Lamborghini huh
it's like something always has to come
back I know it's not much a lot of you
are saying like oh it's just a small
little scratch but it's just the fact
that it happened you're so annoying when
you get like a scratch on the side of a
car like this why he why's it always us
guys why they are chasing a fly okay
What's Wrong Bob was like here the Flies
right here hey see that they've been
chasing it a whole day well he's gonna
dump for it I know it what's wrong
he's not your friend I can't let it I'll
make him fly away it's time to check up
on our little toys that we left in the
war yes they do expand so you ready to
see them guys whoa they actually have
gotten bigger but what there look at
that it's got like something sticking
out it's good you see that oh it looks
kind of weird the dinosaur on Nemo
however he's going good and they
actually have got bigger I'm not sure if
you could tell but yesterday they're
much smaller they're like half the size
of what they are now anyways I'm gonna
leave them for maybe another one or two
days and check back on them because I
think they should get a little bit
bigger it's a up to three weeks to reach
maximum size Sian now I'll just leave
them in there for now we're about to
head out I've got some huge potential
news for you guys so if you guys
remember we did that crazy Lamborghini
event in Dubai loads of revving loads of
supercars etc etc and I'm saying
potential because it's 99% sure okay 99
there is a small chance of failure but
in two days time we might be doing
another huge event with supercars with
the Burj Khalifa with the Burj Al Arab I
know this sounds too good to be true for
you guys
timon you like more okay stop hyping
this up I'm not kidding we're going to
be going to the Burj Khalifa for
breakfast
virtually for the tallest building in
the world then I think going around with
the supercars and then going to the Burj
Al Arab the seven star hotel my Cesario
birthday liam for a lunch or something
like that I'm not too sure but that
means if that does happen I'm expecting
every single one of you to watch the
vlog share it like it and just go ham
with it if you know I mean so what cars
are going to be there do you know
exactly now there's gonna be supercars
and not just like everything's gonna be
everything I can mix I woke up in and
you got it imagine of like hey yo got a
guy trying to race us let's go ah my
sister keeps going on about how cute ki
and bubbles are oh no good damn I'm
gonna drop the camera on the rupture
here imagine you don't realize how
annoyed I am that we completely
scratched a car like the thing is I was
going to vlog when we did it but you
know when you like imagine you just
scratch your Lamborghini the first thing
that comes to mind is and all in it let
me record you it's just like oh let me
go see what it is and we were so
stressed out we thought the biggest
imagine we had like a pavement about
that big and just a bit bigger and my
sister turned and all we hear is I was
like oh no and this is our face
you know i hearing money yeah at the
time we're so stressed out so I came
home and I showed you guys what happened
I guess it's not too bad but what it's
like yeah but when it comes to fixing it
the insurance are gonna be up our
backsides is it about what the hell are
you guys doing guests down below how
much you reckon is gonna repair it cost
I that I can't I stopped the only
scratches cost a standard amount because
you have to take out the entire section
I reckon it's gonna be more than you
think
yeah anyways because of that big news I
just told you I want to go guess
selfie-stick to put the camera I'm
holding right now so if we do go on this
like huge carbon I can have my camera
out the window and recording all the
supercars if you know I mean so let's go
and buy that right now all right guys so
we finally made it to the Mall of
Emirates as always signature spotting
car that's an Aston Martin wow the
interior and that car looks so amazing
look at that all red we've also got a
Ross voice drop head matches my mum's
t-shirt look at it pretty nice we came
to the bottom floor to see the Christmas
tree from down here
I found the selfie stick it's actually
really cool because it has the GoPro one
the camera I'm using a Nutella phone
once I guess I can start using this for
everything and yeah that's going to be
pretty awesome anyways let's go pick
this up now and pay for it and we're
good to go
a little cars okay
I need to bend this a little bit more
you say
so guys this is how it's going to look
like when we have the selfie stick this
is not even fully extended again now
this is just a demo one we just bought
ours it's in the box oh yeah let's go
okay so that's pretty cool you got some
test footage on the stick obviously the
one I'm buying is still in its pot so I
was using like a practice one I don't
know if you saw an orange so the one I'm
getting is black I think this should be
a good addition to the equipment it's
going to give us a bigger angle and yeah
hopefully you can get the cars behind us
on the event guys I cannot find them
Hamid where's the Mohammed oh my god you
can't see me did someone actually hit
light with these yes but I'm basically
camouflage
we've lost our scissors so the knife is
the only thing we have oh okay
and I was about to kill me so this is a
signal dog not bad so I take this look
at it
yeah again we put you guys on here that
see the top angle we get alright come
over come over leg up yah the other is
the madness
right okay this is like the worst thing
for vlogging if you just be waiting hard
we are so so far it's actually kind of
heavy because you know and something's
like farts kind of like it leverages out
to be super heavy Oh
anyways guys are gonna wrap up today's
vlog here look at the type of angle we
get with this new selfie stick it's
ridiculous to get is the same even as
far as you can go that of mad I'm like
this is basically hitting the roof right
now anyways if you didn't join today's
match tonight but I'll see you guys with
another vlog Yolo Yolo I can't even
reach you guys anymore come back bye
