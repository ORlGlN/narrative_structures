mall I was so embarrassed about sitting
around because I would put it for a take
away because it tastes nice but it was
stinking up the whole place bubbles is
just being bubbles early-morning sleep
and snow even every morning it's hot
fast too I don't know I say good morning
as if it's the morning but yeah pretty
happy with my new phone just a couple of
days ago I recorded a small little magic
trick I thought I'd show you right now
because I never really put it in into
any blog in there and it fits so magic
with Mobe coming up okay so you guys
know the other day I had 101 dollar
bills so I'm going to show you a trick
I'm going to change every single one of
these into $100 bills you can see
they're all just ones nothing special
going on so take the money you fold it
rather the money you flick the money and
then voila
it's all $100 bills if you guys want me
to share the secret of how I did this
trick make sure to smash the like button
