watches from the first one I got to the
last one so let's get started so the
first one I ever got this one was a gift
from my sister this was the first one
ever
it is a Casio let me go ahead and try to
focus it for you guys that's as good as
we're gonna do but yet it was a Casio I
really like this my sister wanted
something else but this is why I picked
as my first launch
I was wearing quickly show you guys I
don't know how well you guys can see
that
no you girl I think that's focused but
yeah that is my first ever watch I got
and I got this about six years ago seven
years ago I can say and yeah that was my
first Washington so this is a second
which I got it was a Levi's watch this
is what my sister actually got for free
she bought jeans and they gave her a bed
swatch and she gave it to me and yeah
thought was pretty cool so I kept on to
it
Third Watch now this one has a story if
my schools of guy had a Armani watch and
I told my mom about it and I was like oh

pretty cool when I showed her it and
then for my birthday she ended up game

behind that one so that's how I got this
watch

actually this one I got from the airport
when I got myself it's just a guest
watch I really liked how it looked

guest watch I thought was pretty nice so

place right now this is my second to

another vlog today's looks a bit
different we're giving away our rabbits
we found a really nice place it's like a
farm and they match them up because we
have two females that are separate and
yeah they match them up with a male
companion so we thought it'd be nice to
do this for them it's about time they
are no longer inside so we just packed
up everything and I'm going to go ahead
and show you my rabbit or one of them's
in the front seat are there you go
that's Lulu and the other one is in the
back seat I don't think you can see my
dough using his little cage or she's in
she's in her cage I thought let's say
well yeah we're going to the farm if
they allow us to record over there I
will for you guys but yeah I think the
nice thing we're doing and we're first
gonna obviously check it out just to see
everything's nice over there and again

spaces and logs or whatever yeah dick

cross the road and we have to wait
all right guys over here and we ask the
lady and she was kind enough to let us
film this is Lulu there she is
and look how nice and spacious it's like
outside don't know if you can see her
