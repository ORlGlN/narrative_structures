yo everyone good morning welcome to
another vlog me and my mom are starting
today with my big camera so let me know
how you guys like this you know what I'm
gonna give it another shot I stopped
using it for a while but I love it
because you can zoom into my face like
this and then zoom out to get like a
super wide angle anyway so they have
something really really awesome to show
you guys I did mention yesterday I
bought something very very special and
it's time to unbox it for you guys let's
do this so in that packet I've got
something really cool now don't don't
judge you as soon as you see okay so as
you can see guys we got a remote-control
car but this is not a normal
remote-control car this thing can go on
water snow and land let's unbox this
Beach let's get straight into this beast
I think we can just rip the packaging
open oh my god okay this is actually
gonna be the funnest toy I bought for
awhile guys you don't know how excited I
am to use this beast guys if we used it
in the store yesterday
number one it's super fast number two it
should go on war so I want to test it
out in our local sample as long as they
let me this thing actually looks really
cool guys boom these are inflatable
tires and these are what makes it float
on water I think I'm not sure this thing
is actually a beast okay I hate opening
boxes guys but there we go that is the
remote control I think why is it that
these boxes are always so hard to open
guys like seriously okay we've got an
antenna I'm pretty sure this is with a
remote control so let's put this in here
you guys okay there we go seems legit
seems legit doesn't need to do
chargeable battery we need this this is
the coolest part guys I actually have to
use a pump to pump up the tires on the
car
oh my god these wheels are actually so
cool that is huge this is a wheel that's
not pumped you see that and then this is
a wheel that's pumped okay let's pump up
all the four wheels and we should be
good to take this on the water okay so
yeah everything is pumped up and ready
to go you have to admit guys this thing
looks absolutely crazy so mommy rose
quickly gone inside to get a screwdriver
we're gonna put the battery in and see
how this thing does I mean I just hope I
hope it doesn't drown in the war if it
drowns I'm doomed like I actually want
to take you into the lake we have we
have like this huge lake in our area but
if it drowns I can't go get it like it's
literally a huge lake I wouldn't know
how to go get it here goes nothing guys
I just going to put the battery in you
know it's really crazy because it's war
proof look at the on/off by I'm not sure
if you guys see that it's like protected
by some rubber let's turn this bad boy
on and see how it goes
hi oh my god oh this is so hard to get
used to it's go like left wheel forward
and right wait for it so it's not like
left and right three two one let's go oh
my god
your line is so fast ok guys so now I
want to take you onto the lake we have
in our area crossing my fingers if this
thing drowns I'm doomed decay so let's
not make that happen this thing is
actually pretty fast only one hour of
charging look a laugh we could be saying
rest in peace to my remote-controlled
car today like first day I've opened it
we can already say rest in peace good so
let's see how this goes if I the way
kids I don't recommend doing this do
this in the screening pool or somewhere
don't do it somewhere where you can't
get it back ok
hi guys look at the size of the lake
okay you ready I just put it right here
oh my god if this doesn't work I'm
doomed
how am I gonna get it back oh my god I
know
all my Yami
oh my god it's Tucker I don't think this
case you were a killer trap oh my god
guys honestly this thing doesn't even
move look at it why is that mine oh the
batteries finished really okay so I'll
actually really lucky guys the battery
just finished it finished autos in the
war I couldn't get it back anyways that
was a little bit of our guys I thought
it would do it like fast across the
water but I don't know I need the key to
the door man
come on it's hot I'm burning please
don't do this to me why do we even lock
the door this is by the way look at all
this mess we made guys just trying to
get the pieces in here that was just for
a battery change I didn't know what to
do so we took out everything I just want
to say I didn't choose the obesity life
the obesity life chose me my god oh my
god I know it's bad for me I'm addicted
hey every boy Samia my mom are gonna
head out while my RC car charges but I
thought also leave this to charge if you
guys don't know what this is this is
that you know that video I've made
Lamborghini made a hoverboard this is
that red board thing that I have that
one that revs and I thought that that
charged up as well I really like it
because it has its own case so you can
carry around like a that
what a beauty we have here look at that
this thing the person who said it to me
said it's supposed to say something when
I turn it on but it never says it let's
see back then it's not supposed to say
just max burn it's both sighs you talked
you like Megatron activated but it just
doesn't say it I don't know what I'm
doing wrong wait it doesn't make that
resin toys anymore
wait what I'm so confused right now this
is supposed to make a riveting noise
what is it broken already
one more try back then what's next burn
did you hear that
it said I'm Optimus Prime that was so
cool
okay it didn't say okay hopefully you
guys heard it the first time it said I
don't know how to make it happen but
anyways this is all my favorite strength
waves ever it's just so it's so
different like I feel like we have a car
inside the house let's head out because
I just realized we have a bunch of
savages in my house okay I've bought
this bucket yesterday and I just came to

very cool idea in the comment section
which said mo instead of just giving
away to somebody randomly do a giveaway
where I asked one if you guys were us
all of you to like submit a certain
video so maybe the giveaway winner is
somebody that makes me the best intro or
makes me the best you know some sort of
video or something that you guys have to
do something to be entered and I thought
that was a really good idea so I'm gonna
think of something that I need to be
done so maybe like an intro maybe like a
banner and then I'll do a giveaway like
that so
makes me the best one which I end up
using they win the giveaway as well as
maybe like maybe I'll do - I am so one I
am you have to do something for and the
