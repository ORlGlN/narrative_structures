Gucci flip-flops guys hey

fatties out here today the plug sounds
such a sack the only guy doubt
where Gucci slippers service our hotel
man get there hello
like wait you its Ross your turn to do
the bench press let's see he's about to
die i down down down down no what the
hell is that right so he quickly came
over to the small section to look around
and look at me damn this is the jacuzzi
guys who watch this the showers actually
have really cool thing oh oh wow yeah
because to you I'm out you guys still
live we're good
your life anyways as I mentioned we're
just here to have some lunch so as you
can see we're here with the fam about to
order some food yo yo we have fatty as
well this is a good buy Versace hotel
see you soon see you soon
so now that I'm home I actually want to
do something now if you guys remember I
have a very limited pair of shoes which
are white and I wore the one okay I wore
them for my voice keys music video and
they became super dirty in one day I
don't know how but on the plus side my
boy Ross should you guys should know
he's like the ambassador of the shoe
cleaning company and he gave me what I
need to clean the shoes okay so I'm
gonna go get them and let's test it out
for ourselves there they are guys damn
look at this if you guys can see the
whole side of the shoe is red I should
feel super nervous doing this I feel
like I'm taking my shoes through surgery
so hopefully this works out nicely okay
by the way this is actually real gold
like Google Play so yeah like just to
show you which shoes I ended up ruining
it has to be the best one the way you
actually do this is you put the solution
on your brush and you like wipe it off
the shoe so ya guys
you look at that one round to wash in
wash out I will be honest at the moment
I feel like I've made it black yo is it
just me or does it look weird I think
it's because it's wet I'll let you guys
know in an hour I don't want to jump to
conclusions but it definitely made it a
little better so yeah a lot away from my
shoes to dry up right now we're actually
going over to the swimming pool and the
reason is this bowl again okay yo before
you guys start roasting me again if you
guys don't know what this ball is
already it's mostly like bounce across
work and both times I've tried it on the
blog I felt really badly so let's go by
the way my mom is taking the lifeguard
some watermelon so yeah pretty weird so
we just made it over to the swimming
pool and it looks so good right now
check it out
it is absolutely empty right now the
reason I actually came at night is
because you can see the ball bouncing a
little bit better I think but look at
this view the moon looks so amazing
right now
anyways here goes nothing we're gonna
start bouncing the ball and yeah let's
see how this goes I'm actually gonna let
mommy mo do it first guys for you guys
so here goes nothing just throw it oh oh
guys the bull kind of got stuck in the
middle so we have to bring it out with
that
alright let's go home guys
that was a little bit of a fail but we
still managed to do it your heart is
literally at the same will for half an
hour trying to record what this does it
turned out not so great but it's Oh what
the hell oh my god the huge flash
lighting me alright let's go home boys
that was okay at least I did it properly
for once and not on a bucket mommy stop

many memories guys but yeah there you go

that is so cool it's like you know the
events you have for your AC that's what
it looks like so I just made it back
home from football boys I actually want
to have a very serious conversation with
you guys so I'm sure all of you are in
the same position as me so honestly
after playing football right now I told
you guys I want to start working out
more because I felt really unhealthy but
I feel like it's gone to a point where I
could have health issues and I'm not
exaggerating one bit like I was
literally squealing like when I was
breathing it you could hear me whistle
that's how bad my throat had become I'm
not sure if you guys can hear that
can you guys hear that whistle it's
because like my throat closed up that's
how much like it affects me when I run
it by the way just to keep you guys
updated I know this week has been a very
slow week but honestly I've been doing
so many things behind the scene this
week that it's just ridiculous but
listen to my breathing it's like it's
not dying speaking to you guys so yeah
I've been super busy I know I haven't
really been like pushing out crazy blogs
but honestly guys there's a lot of
things I'm going to show you that I'm
working on I still haven't even got
myself a house and I've been telling you
guys for the past two months that I want
to buy a house or an apartment it's just
so much has been overloaded then I can't
