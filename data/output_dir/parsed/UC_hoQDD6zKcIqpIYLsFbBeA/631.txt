yo yo everyone welcome to another vlog
so I'm starting today off by skating
over to my local shops and the reason
isn't the best basically for the last
week I've had like the worst stomach
ache ever I'm not gonna get into detail
about I think you guys know exactly
what's going down I think I've got some
sort of food poisoning to be honest so
I'm gonna go grab myself some like
sparkling water or anything to kind of
get rid of it let's go
but it's hard going around with skates
because you have to like walk on the
grass sections when cars come but you
know we have to do with it oh my god
these roads are so bumpy for skates look
at this I feel my head vibrating right
now by the way if you can already tell
I've fallen in love with this hat and I
think I'm gonna wear every single day so
let me know what you guys think does it
suit me or do you guys want me to stop
wearing it every day hi if you guys
don't already know I absolutely hate
sparkling water so my mum said
apparently like 7up or sprite works the
exact same but thinking women get that
instead hopefully it works out and I'm
not cheating hi guys
seriously look at this look at the size
of the speed bumps they're building I
seriously think they're building way too
many speed bumps again you might think
I'm over-exaggerating
that's a huge speed bump over there and
then here's another speed bump they are
less than 10 meters away from each other
hawkman the finally made it back home
I've got my medication I don't think
like 7up or sprite is the best
medication but regardless I'm gonna have
that later on hopefully it will help out
my belly a bit cuz it's been messed up
I'm just gonna say that it's good it's
been like it ah it's a disaster down
there door is not open did you ever do
that where like you think wait is this
my house and then you realize it is
alright before I take off my skates I
actually want to tell you guys one thing
about these skates that's pretty cool
basically when I went to buy my scape
skates and I bought these in London by
the way I was gonna buy normal skates
because I like skiing your home but you
know when you start watching videos
online YouTube and you get inspired I go
inspired guys basically I started
watching skaters that did tricks like
the ones that went on like rails and
started skidding and basically if you
see the bottom of these skates over here
there's like a little indentation now
basically what that's for so you can
slide across like the edges of street
corners or like jump on top rails and
skid and I honestly bought these with
the intention of doing that
however they weigh like five kilograms
to get these things off the ground with
a jump is already a hassle in itself
because they're so damn heavy and
secondly the one time I tried a trick I
fell oh my back and I promise you it
hurts so bad that since then I've never
jumped again with them so I kind of
failed to be honest I don't think like
I've used them how you are supposed to
but on the plus side every time I skate
normally outside it is a workout for me
because I have to drag about 10
kilograms of shoes with me because look
at these guys solid plastic like the
whole thing is solid plastic and it just
weighs so much now though I should
unbook something that I've been really
really excited to test out what else on
my flight to go to Zanzibar
these things which are like chap sticks
but they've got different flavors just
like Coke Fanta sprite cetera et cetera
and I'm really excited to test it out
now they told me it tastes like one of
these but I'm not sure if they just told
me that so I buy it or not but
regardless I'm gonna open it up and see
how it is oh my god I'm so so excited I
let's see how this goes guys uh hi
boom whoa oh my god that's so exciting
it's like the smallest thing ever
whoa all right okay so first things
first
this smells so sweet oh my god okay I'm
gonna try the phantom first and see how
this is you know what you could do like
you know that videos where they do like
chapstick tasting challenge yeah how
does this work
here goes nothing I got it to work tsch
tastes I mean the smell sometimes I can
taste it from the snow that's how much
it is okay here goes nothing guys oh
please tell me it has a smell like a
tation oh no no no no no no no no it
broke Oh try I'm trying to figure out
who has a taste or not guys
but the chapstick part broke oh my god
this is like the lucious thing ever it
definitely has a taste but is not as
good as I thought it'd be okay that's
just the first one guys number one was
it was okay
all right let's like this off my lips
and let's get on to number two I really
want to test out the sprite let's see
how this one tastes I okay I sprite
definitely tastes much better guys damn
I could use it all day that I this on
this one tastes nice guys anyways guys I
thought I'd share that with you cuz I
thought it was absolutely insane and
it's all the coolest things I've ever
seen but yeah like the sprite and coke
tastes amazing the Fanta I'm not too
sure about that one I personally didn't
like it but I think it's because when it
broke up I was trying to like eat the
chunks so I do not recommend doing that
anyways if I find the link to these on
Amazon or something I'll link it down
below so you guys can check it out as or
but that that's done by the way I've
been seeing your comments guys a few if
you say I need to work out my arms by
your brain so today we go get them games
ok we don't get them cake
oh shit oh yeah I stopped because I was
you like I want to say this guys are cat
kitty has some serious serious anger
issues
okay look at her right now she's trying
to beat up bubbles from above the table
he's done nothing to you
what is wrong with this cat
so me and my more actually gonna be
heading over to the mall right now and I
know you guys might be thinking it's
dark outside
isn't it late well no it's actually free
early very shaky because it's Ramadan
normally the stores are open until like
10 o'clock which is the normal time but
because it's Ramadan right now they're
open until like 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. which
is pretty good because we always leave
the house late anyway lights out boys
whoo before we actually head out I want
to tell you guys something that happened
to me like two weeks ago which I forgot
to mention and it was absolutely
adorable so you guys didn't know when I
unlocked my car there's like a picture
of a horsey on the floor do you see that
and we're in the parking lot and I just
want like a girl taking a photo next to
my car on the floor and I thought there
was like a cat or something next to the
car like what is she doing and then I
locked my car and she was like excuse me
can you do that again I was like what is
she talking about but in fact she was
recording the horsey she wanted to take
a picture of it and I found that
adorable because look once you lock it
like it goes away okay so I just came
over to the shoe store over here guys
and I'm trying on some shoes they're
gonna go get a meeting but I just
realized something
Tamura they're doing the records for the
New Year's Eve and I'm definitely coming

they have left the rest of them have
been sold out but yet you can tell like

stock on my size anyways
I tried getting the you know the flu
game red and black shoes they were
completely out of stock because they're
like limited and I also tried like
another pair of shoes to try black and
red and again they had like half a size
too small but since they did say Yeezys

care I'm just coming back for that and

okay I just found one of the most
awesome things ever if you see that on
my mom's face
it's a wiper glass okay check out how
this works guys so you wind it and it
starts wiping it
what odd peanuts are the most random
stuff here like how do you think of this

wipes it off that is awesome man
they've got like so much random stuff
here but it's also cool like those are
the wiper glasses let me show you some
other stuff they have okay check this
out guys they've got like handcuffs just
random metal handcuffs over here and
like all these funny faces look at this
but you can become bold like they have
this thing that makes you look bold okay
I'm also gonna get myself some party
poppers and I'm not sure if you guys

these will come use in about a week or
two time if you know you know guys if
you know you know anyways it go so much
random something look Renee's plastic

nonsense and they've even got guns this

what did my motors pick up use it
sound like a slap machine oh my god guys
oh my god we just realized how to use
this so you know what this is this isn't
a slap machine in this this is used to
kill flies so you put it back and then
BAM you kill up like what you see why we
guys who think so stuff like this it is
just awesome I buy one look at this guys
look at this that that is cool okay
while I'm in the wall I thought I'd show
you this because I've actually been
excited for this store for so long
they're gonna be opening in a Fisher
Jordan store soon and you guys don't
realize how excited I am because the
stores are so Jordans don't really have
a big selection but apparently this
one's going to like you know the
American Jordan stores they have like
rules full of Jordan that's how this one
is going to be apparently I hope it
doesn't disappoint but if it does turn
out like like a proper store I it's
gonna be dope man it's gonna be dope all
right guys so I personally hate fresh
juices but since your boy is on a diet I
came and got myself one check it out
actually there's really cool light it's
got layers of different color so that's
what mummy logo I got like a plain mix
or like orange pineapple and mango it's
my first time trying I don't know if I
like you or not but what's even cooler
this page sounds like all the fruits
like fresh check it out oh my god be so
cool tat like in your living room where
people can eat it I just got my drink
and
it actually seems pretty nice it's mango
orange and pineapple it's a very weird
mix I chose but you can actually really
taste the mango strong so actually just
tastes like mango juice I did get myself
a fresh fruit cocktail which is good for
you right but I also got myself a pizza
I mean good plus bad equals neutral
right yeah
yeah I think that works now that I'm
home I want to open these up by the way
these are only like two dollars so they
were super super cheap and I just
realized why they use them for so whoa
Dam Bi said hey this is looks like I'm
gonna go diving basically you know what
you're not eating like soup or something
that steams up if you eat that with
these it steams up and then you can use
this for cleaning it off the legs so
hilarious oh and you're a super super
dope they cost like only two dollars and
yet by the way guys tomorrow actually
gonna be going for something really cool
now I'm not sure exactly what it is all
I know it's like this freezing I mean
freezing like ice ball thing like it

thought I'd mention it I'm also one
thing I need to admit something guys I

these Yeezys which I want to go apply
for I'm gonna be honest we're Yeezys

understand it why are they so expensive
they're not even that good and now now
that there's so much hype behind them
I'm like a fanboy of bzees I know I know
it's like a wrong attitude to go about
it but I don't know there's just so much
hype that I want to have it you know
like when everybody else is like so
excited for it and you're like yeah yeah
let's let me just jump into this
excitement like that's how I feel any
ways I am gonna go try
