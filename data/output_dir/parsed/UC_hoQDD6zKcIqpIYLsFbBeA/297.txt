oh yeah everyone what is love welcome
back to another video so today we have a
very special unboxing oh my goodness
so I actually never made a stream for my
life this can probably take a very long
time so if it's night time by the time
we finished now you know why apparently
it's a really complicated procedure to
make this thing yeah guys look at what
they have they actually give you a no
diving sticker sign must be posted in a
visible position within two meters of
the school so if you guys ever come to
my house no diving no cannonballs and
definitely no swimming
we hit it we didn't guys where is the
new swimming pool
I know there's a lot of you saying yo
this is not a swimming pool its budget
okay I only spend $100 on this but I'm
happy with the outcome again forever
I've never been more happy in my life to
have a swimming pool than now yeah this
is going to take years
you know that's it I'm done oh my
goodness
my brother's losing his mind boy your
spring outside the pool it's not going
to fill up at this rate man I'm not
swimming anymore that's it you know our
neighbors like you know us and they're
pretty watching there's closing
happening right now I'm sorry guys my
brother's like losing his mind so I'm
sorry to say we just realized the time
it's going to take for this to fill up
is probably around 4 hours so yeah I'll
see you guys after 4 hours
what's our warble gonna say off to the
same pool bankrupt bankrupt it is it's
literally been half an hour since we
turned on both the pipes and that's all
the war in there are you kidding me so
since the safe was going to take a very
very long time to fill up we're going to
continue with the rest of the vlog and
then later on tonight we're going to be
back to do some swimming so let's
quickly go change the plug and let's
have a good day guys whoa Harold bleak
right now hey ok so these right now I'm
actually heading out to quickly get a
haircut and I know it doesn't look like
I need one but I want to look fresh
because tomorrow there's a very special
event ok if you guys want to know more
about it follow me on Instagram and
snapchat because you guys probably see
it there first so yeah right now I'm
quickly heading out so we can do that
and yeah it's gonna be an exciting day
tomorrow yeah whoa oh my goodness that
looks so cool ok so the thing is my
sister's actually in a room right now
and I decided she's not using her car so
I'm gonna go take the Lamborghini to
have a haircut boys look how dusty the
Lamborghini is she never drives it wait
why do I have the roller skis on you
guys keep their own
or something in Fargo is it just me or
does this car get louder every single
time look alright belong let me see you
okay so there's one thing I need to
avoid hitting right now and that's the
swimming pool so yeah we're gonna try
our best to go around yeah boy this is
are you ready really oh my
this car is amazing so I completely
forgot that it was a weekend today I'm
not sure if I'm even going to get a spot
at the hairdresser's guys because yeah
there's a lot of traffic over here I
don't know why I decided to come we get
my hair cut
on the busiest day of the week it's a
Friday a Friday
okay so I luckily managed to find
parking for the car now it's time for
the moment of truth okay hair
transformation in three two one whoa
holy Boni I look like a pineapple hello
I'm home okay the door is open which is
not very safe anybody home no money are
you alive
mommy do you like my new haircut
what the hell what what the hell is it
do you like my new haircut all right I
know I promised you that I'd be going in
to the super once I got home but I
actually need to take the Rose race to
the petrol station to have an oil top-up
now I've never added oil to a roast race
or to any car so let's go and see what
we need to do all right so check it out
boys right now I just made it over to
the petrol station about to do a quick
oil change Wow
check
out that engine I've actually never seen
the engine of my own car boys so that's
pretty cool to see over there I'm not
sure if you can see that it's steaming
over there is that the oil or what is
that money what is that it's steam
written hit holy moly you don't even
realize how hot this engine is anyways
they're gonna quickly change the oil on
this Bab way we can head out of here so
yeah they're gonna do it for me I'm not
going to touch anything boys I have no
idea how to change a little food and
there is going over filling up the car I
don't know why this looks nerve-wracking
and we're done
okay oil is changed yes I don't know why
I thought it was going to be more
complicated than that but thankfully the
car is good and yeah we have no problem
I'm not gonna lie whenever I get a
notification pop up on the car I get so
scared something's gonna be wrong with
it because I don't know it's a roll
straight so you have anything happens my
bank accounts going down with the car so
thankfully the car is all good now it's
time to go home and play with the
swimming pool okay oh my god oh wow not

before I wrap up today's video we've
actually got an announcement to make to
you guys so I'm not sure how many if you
realize but the video you're watching
today is actually not supposed to be the
one uploaded basically we had to
reorganize vlogs so tomorrow's video is
going to be the one meant for today and
I know that sounds crazy so tomorrow
you're going to watch me without a
haircut like we're going to go back in
time but the reason is I'm not sure how
many of you took this seriously in
yesterday's video I mentioned that my
sister's dropping a music video and I'm
not lying
i'm actually not lying yeah my sister's
video tomorrow is going to be a monic
video our I get our video and that is
the reason why we had to swap around the
days because she didn't edit her video
in time so yet tomorrow is going to be a
very unusual vlog like my blog covers
the behind the scenes and everything so
just stay tuned for it
I'd already know what else to say about
the song because II yeah you're gonna
see you're gonna see what I mean guys
okay we call it it's just don't expect
it to be a song more like a story okay
if that makes ten all right anyway stay
tuned for tomorrow's video guys that's
all we want to say for now so as always
I love you guys will see two more for a
very unusual episode and until then make
sure you subscribe to the channel you
can watch my last video a little bye
