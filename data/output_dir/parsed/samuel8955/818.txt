pick out a sword also I just took off
the coat completely but we still have
the issue of the dogs jumping over the
fence Annie

over this fence craze it out so I got
chicken wire here in a step of gun and
I'm gonna staple chicken wire to the top
of fence and kind of droop it so she
can't jump over it let's see what we can

that fence obviously but this is just a
temporary fix

this job oh sure I'm careful cuz I just
got some bad news
Sam had left to take his mom to the
doctor well to the ER actually she's
been having some really bad spasms in
her back he was following her to her
house he was going to take her to the ER
and while he was following her there she
had a car crash car accident

doing just fine nothing to worry about
she's just having some back spasms
probably pulled a muscle on her lower
back so came home and talked to me about
how many bags we have to take tomorrow
to the airport she said we had six
carry-on bags it seems like every time
six for all four of us guess it's not
that bad that's including a couple
personal bags it seems like every time
we go traveling we always have to unpack
them the very last minute because we
just end up hacking too much so it's
just kind of routine in our family so
it's kind of funny but anyway I gotta
finish packing my backpack with all my
photography equipment and stuff like
that but don't forget guys we love you
okay we'll see you tomorrow
at the airport bright and early and
remember to love each other
