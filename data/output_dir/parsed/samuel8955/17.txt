fan basics suggested that we put a slide
off the porch and Oklahoma I was sorry
about that I really appreciate the idea
I did comment on it and say thanks for
the great idea I'm really going to do it
because it's a really high porch and
it'd be so fun for the kids just to
climb up there and go down the slide

is back
your shoes are on backwards to fix that
we're at it that's what I just did
