good morning guys what are you up to
yes here I come we're gonna go have our
last breakfast in our hotel and a fun
little getaway
by the same guy love but if a heart
in this together the benefit of having
young kids is waking up early enough to
enjoy the continental breakfast I think
if it was a Sam and I travelling in the
same hotel us we probably would not make
it to the wrong a new breakfast we would
be sleeping in don't you think so
anyways we're all enjoying some eggs and
waffles and nice home-cooked breakfast I
was telling Sam yesterday I was like I
want to go out to eat somewhere because
that's like my vacation from cooking
itself
he's like we've had breakfast every
single morning at hotel so I'm really
grateful for it I even think about that
anyways no I want to go out to lunch um
what do we have planned for today mr.
Sam
several recorders what doesn't he always
set the camera down on record like I'll
go to edit videos and most like 20
minute long vlogs just so but nothing
ever just sit here
so just Whitney starts talking about how
nice is having kids could we give their
daughter Cosmo Symphony spilled my
coffee on my lap love kids

thanks for coming along with me to the
wedding shoot this weekend this week I
have another shoot on Wednesday and so
many wedding shoots it's kind of
overwhelming can't believe that you have
another shoot on Wednesday something
like that sinem girl yeah I have to work
on Tuesday night but yeah but I have
another wedding so that's an interesting
day to have a wedding on right Wednesday
that or the venue that they're doing the
wedding at is dealing days available
sometimes that's the case and also
Vinny's are a lot cheaper don't we
and they on the weekend it's a way to
save money also maybe certain family
members could only make home that day

explore with Symphony because I owe her

for my daughter as show her the world
