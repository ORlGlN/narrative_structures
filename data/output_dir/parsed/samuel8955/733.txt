from a couple days ago
we're Oreo proofing the room for the
night everyone's getting ready for bed
and it is a long overdue comment of the
date I'm sorry we've been forgetting
guys we just forgot honestly so the
comment of the day I got to choose it
and it goes - hey mama
okay so comment of the day goes to Sarah
Hardy she said I'm about to be getting
married and wondering if y'all could
give us advice on how you split time
with each other's family for holidays
and get-togethers you know when we first
got married it's been a little over six
years it was really hard at first the
first holiday we spent together was
Thanksgiving and we spent it with Sam's
family for the majority of the day and
to be honest I was in a little bit of a
depression I wanted to be with my family
so that evening we went to be with my
family but like in the evening time like
I don't know I felt like everybody had
already gone home there was still some
people there but the people my age had
already moved on to other families
houses like that so one thing that we
have done or that we've tried is to host
it at our house it doesn't always work
but that way you get your immediate
family and your spouse's immediate
family at your house and if that's not
possible because of where you live then
I guess just flip-flop in between
holidays so like Thanksgiving at this
family's house that way you get the
whole day with that family you don't
have to split it up heavy doesn't have
to miss his siblings you don't have to
miss your grandma and cousins or your
siblings or whoever and then at
Christmas time you'd spend it with your
family and you get the whole day
uninterrupted with your family hopefully
that helps I'm sure a lot of you out
there have other tips and ideas
especially you experienced marriage folk
but until then we will see you guys
tomorrow tomorrow is the first day since
our vacation that we will all be home
together with really no super major
plans and I cannot tell you how excited
I am about it I even got the kids
surprises for a bubble bath
but we will see you all tomorrow don't
forget we love you and remember to love
each other
