you guys dinner is served I am so proud
of how it looks
it wasn't like really hard or anything
we were going to do a quinoa recipe and
then we remember we had some tilapia in
the freezer from Costco so look at this
pretty and healthy dish that I made
does that look delicious and colorful or
what the box suggested to have like
spaghetti with like cherry tomatoes with
it so I did like a quinoa recipe with
lemon and corn and just to kind of give
it some flavor and then we have steamed
butternut squash and apples with
cinnamon and brown sugar over here so
that side dish is not the healthiest but
still it's not the unhealthiest either
it's not like pizza or nachos or you
know come on I want to see his reaction
oh so colorful isn't it cute
thank you kids I personally am NOT a
fish fan but I little bit just because
it's good for me good for the baby
budget all of it and one more he did
want more make a note you don't eat fish
because of the fish taste of the quinoa
head under advance so I said yeah yeah
but anyways guys there's no comment of
