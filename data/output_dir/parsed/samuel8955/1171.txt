working so hard out here okay I've just
been working down my mental that's a
cool capacity oh hey little sister hey
you own in my trash see what Oh
oh yeah whoa look at that huge stack of
Wow cutie where did you take those all
from but my yard looks really pretty so
it's really worth it we were watching
the vlog back from our oh yeah it
doesn't really nice all nice and trimmed
up we were watching the vlog back from
our water bucket challenges and we were
just like whoa we need to do some yard
work maybe he'll let me plant a few more
plants fallish plants yeah that's why
so while sands been out here doing this
kind of work I've been inside boxing up
wreaths and doing some work on my reef
page my Etsy shop page just kind of like
you know working out little details and
stuff that I haven't had a chance to do
in a couple of weeks and so I feel very
organized and caught up on my read stuff
and for the rest of the day when I have
free time I've got to work on little
pillar things I like that plant in my
garden Abram just walked it right into
the garden he loves watching Sam work
yeah this is daddy's Nana here you go
honey
oh sure welcome see don't you wish we
had a pool now oh definitely not
yes you do what do you love just go jump
in a pool and cool off right now we were
supposed to get a pool all summer we
didn't do it we get a pool every year or
we have a pull up every year and last
year Sam destroyed it when he cut down
our trees which whatever we saved a lot
of money by cutting down the trees
ourselves so it's kind of an okay thing
but we're supposed to get another one we
did
go another one yet so
the awkward moment when you have to
exchange belongings with your ex which
my little gremlin doing my little
gremlin mommy had to go run some errands
so she's you and me
oh yeah do did it do
cambered so while I was cleaning up the
yard today I found a massive black widow
right in this little nook in the fence
wait uh guy can you see him right there
do you see the black widow click on the
screen do you see the little black widow
scary guy I've had people come in the ER
after being bitten by local people
usually make it a lot of people say
they're deadly they can be deadly but
very rarely do they cause death for the
most part to just make you really sick
can y'all guess where I'm at that's a
silly question you don't have to guess
because I just showed you up there I am
here from one maybe two things so two
things tops that's why I'm here
so you guys go ahead and guess now how
many of you think I'm gonna actually
walk out with this is the area I need my
burlap from and they don't have it they
never have it anymore I'm beginning to
wonder if it's been discontinued they
have these little triangles for burlap
banners but they're like triple the
price of the ones that already have a
string across them and the other ones
are just much better made this is for
Katie's wedding and so I was like no
long would this feel like real legit
like a really good one so that's kind of
where I'm at with this 100% sure what to
do about it but she's not getting
married until September 6 so I have a
little bit of time still something else
that I could get along here if something
frozen related I'm making an awesome
frozen - - wreath
it looks like I did not stick to the
plan I ended up getting stuff for a
little pillar
I got symphony a big-girl craft as she
so sweetly requested
what else did I get oh yeah that's all I
need a buggy isn't that cute a jewelry
tree that you make yourself she'll love
that she has a lot of different things
and she can make it her viewer tree and
a little bracelet that you guys did or
she could put it on that that's a good
idea maybe I'll suggest that Stephanie

idea of putting his a preview window on
the FaceTime screen like in places of my
face like say his eyeball was drip over
my eyeball and it made it look like he
was part of my face and he's my
identical twin brother so it looked like
it actually belong there but I didn't
because he had a beard and of course a
little bit different facial features but
anyway he put on imgur and McGirt
