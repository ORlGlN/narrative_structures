going out with the kids she's gonna go
pick out I think what she's gonna be
known as picking out some bedding but
yeah now that the snow is melted I could
come out here and do some cuttings I
picked a absolutely wrong time to start
working on a new room so I told him to
grab the brown pants that's bro
Abraham's closet and he grabbed the
khaki ones which is also kind of an
affront okay don't worry way too big
this window down honey

goodbye to your father he's going to
work you guys got your suckers you're
happy sitting he's getting that that
sucker I'm gonna go work on the house

I'm no longer a nurse while I work on
the house I'm only a nurse when I go to
the hospital okay bye Abram bye bye have
fun all right you guys ready to go pick
up new bedding with me and Sandy
oh I've been so emotional thinking about
you Oh
costing all that good thank you I did
that myself I'm a mess
let the decision-making begin there's so
many choices everywhere oh yeah Dallas
Cowboys exactly my style look how pretty
that is it's called real simple okay
which one do you like better oh my gosh
I love this one seven piece decorative
bed set it feels really cute and comfy
this one oh but over there there's
purple oh my gosh this would match our
room perfectly checking that out
I think Abram made the choice for us
this is actually kind of pretty I just
don't like the feel of it sandi now
we're saying that this material it's
pretty so annoying I found another one
over here that I like the feel of it
feels quilted I decided I like the
quilted feel no and it's this one see
that pattern that's pretty this is a
duvet cover which I do like the idea of
a duvet cover because we already have
like a duvet
we were just up like uncover it and put
the cover back on it so I'm kind of
liking this this is a nice look this one
made it into the buggy and of course I'm
second-guessing it now what do you think
sandy I think I like it
do you love it would you buy it what I
buy it
oh he likes it okay so Bed Bath & Beyond
just wasn't doing it for me we are now
at t.j.maxx in the bedding Department
and we walked in the door and there was
this gray and white comforter set and
here it is Abram is currently trying to
climb on it here's a picture of it on
the side I think I'm gonna go to this
one it's cheaper and fill this is nice
I'm doing it I went with this one gray
and white polka dots I don't know what
you call this but I'm doing it it's 8:30
we started this process at 7:35 so an
hour oh man there's a couple more things
I wanted to go with to set like I want a
pillow that's purpley gray and I want
two more pillows gotta give this girl
some mad props she was so helpful while
I was shopping for over an hour for my
bedding she was so helpful with Abram in
this videos and viewers my let me get
this hat braids which is that there's a
cap and there's a brain I think this day
has been long enough but fine so don't
forget you do it don't forget we love
you and remember to love each other
for
