the newness of our home she hasn't been
here since we had the old kitchen and
not wild craft room in the old
yes bedroom which is no abrahams nursery
last moved here it was all being redone
and you had no balls no doors and only
have before oh really
yeah like that was it that bad well I
did it again guys around 3.2 miles with
the kids and it was really cold out
there and the kids were happy
actually everyone started crying about
two and a half mile marker he started
crying but it only lasts about a minute
then he started like humming to himself
is really cute but man I forgot how hard
it is around three miles like the mental
aspect of it it's so hard at first
especially you know not running for the
past several days so first I started
getting really defeated in my head I was
like are you sure you want to do this am
are you sure I had to like get over the
pain in my lower back and my butt start
cramping a little bit but after I got
like two miles is just like really
started getting into a rhythm with my
breathing and it got much easier from
there I was like okay I'm doing it and I
was also nervous about like started
making up excuses do you really want to
get bronchitis Sam do you really want
bronchitis do you want to start coughing
for the next couple weeks do you want
that for yourself you should probably
stop and take a break rather than take a
break this time and we made it in 27
minutes 3.2 miles in 27 minutes it's
really good last time we did that same
round it took me a little over 30
minutes
but anyway went really good I'm gonna
get out there I feel a lot better about
myself I challenge you guys to get out
there and start running it's that first
run that's really hard to get in this
you know the habit of running it's that
first fun because I think we set up in
our
heads like this height these high
expectations like I need to go out there
probably one time our elders know where
I can do that okay when I got good job
that's how you do so you don't lose them
they accept me put the DVDs back so we
don't lose them because she's already
lost a couple of them but yeah guys get
out there on even if it's just for a
half a block I promise you'll feel some
so much better about yourself just a
half a block that first day you'll come
back like hey I can do this next day
you'll maybe do a little bit further do
the same distance but it was good um
this cold weathers really helping me get
ready for that turkey trot I'm really
excited about that it's gonna be so much
fun
