careful it could break okay the last
thing somebody has to put her bag is
something she doesn't like so what did

the bag huh oh hey cool dude all right
guys it's time for me to in my night
with a little lunchbox packing here I'm
trying something new to see if it helps
time and stress and I don't know it's
just an idea that I had when I got
somebody's first lunch ready for the
school year I went ahead and passed
extra ones just got stuff stored away
through the whole week in two separate
little baggies so all I have to do is
just reach in here
grab a few and take them to her lunch
box so for tomorrow we have yellow
cherry tomatoes pickled okra two of her
absolute phase a rice krispies roll
pistachios that are already peeled and
cracked
those are good for her snack time just
at protein at snack time so sending that
and for her lunch
I could either do a lunchable or her
little meat and cheese roll-up think she
like she doesn't like sandwiches Lucy so
I think I'll also add a string cheese
and two mini bananas
just in case she wants one for snack and
one for lunch and then I got her little
water bottle ready it was leaking though
today then I top it off with these
little lunch box notes today's was a
cookie and I said you're a smart cookie
and tomorrow it's your dynamite but for
now I got to figure out this water
bottle situation and tell you guys good
night we will see you tomorrow as always
don't forget we love you and remember to
love each other
we're in this together
