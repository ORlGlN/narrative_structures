Oh breakfast
morning guys don't get ready with me
today I've been doing some new things
with my morning routine and I want to
share it with you guys I've been doing a
four-step skincare process every morning
tonight to take care of my skin to keep
it healthier and hydrated and it comes
from life dances it's called true
science and I just I love it
first step is a face wash it smells
amazing and it feels great step to the
perfecting lotion you always want to use
upward strokes when you're putting on
any kind of facial cream
step three I serum and then the last
step is the anti-aging cream
it's fast it's quick it feels amazing
and it really wakes me up for the day I
love how refreshed my skin feels first
thing in the morning you guys know that
has been on the market looking for
something for my skin for a while
95 percent of people who used true
science had positive things to say about
how it left their skin feeling and I'm
one of them so now it's 96 percent or 95
2005 this isn't it is now time for me to
do my hair and makeup but if you guys
want to learn more about true science
you can click on the link in the
description you'll get this cute little
box and it's also because on the back it
has the descent process that you use and
the directions for how you put it on
which again is super easy and I love it
