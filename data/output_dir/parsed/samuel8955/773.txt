the mood for red vines
I've been craving red vines lately guys
I think it's a sympathy craving with our
pastor kids guys I've had sympathy pains
or sympathetic pregnancy both times with
Abram and Symphony I gained a little bit
of weight with Nia I like pickles like
she did it's called Chabad syndrome and
there's actually something we learned
about in nursing school um some people
think it's actually just a psychosomatic
disorder or psychosomatic condition
whatever
I think it's biological because I've
been craving pickles at nighttime
just like Nia I've been craving getting
in the bathtub and I'm even starting to
have feet swelling I'm totally joking
with you about that one my feet are
always but couvade syndrome guys look it

from Rose Jones when I read the title I
almost thought it was twins several
people said that it's pretty funny that
would have been awesome I keep saying it
would be awesome but being a twin myself
I'm an identical twin brother if you
guys didn't know once we hit a certain
age in middle school started to become
very competitive for both of us we were
after the same women we were just
competing who was smarter who looked
better it was stronger it was a lot of
competition so I don't know if I want
that for my kids I don't know falling
asleep see you tomorrow don't forget
