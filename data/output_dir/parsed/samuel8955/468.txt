hello good morning little dude how are
your pancakes this morning great they're
great
cool I think Juliet's ready for her
second breakfast one thing on my agenda
to do within the next couple of weeks is
to clear out this closet we all have one
of those closets right please tell me we
all have one of these closets
it's like blankets overflowing I am
going to make that my Christmas present
stashing station is gonna be done the
desert yeah it is looking that high more
banana pancakes for the dad
look at that stack of Christmas lights
now that is exciting now all I need is a
lift and some manpower look is coming
next week and the manpower is coming
from right there I see that that bicep
pop up out of nowhere this has 25
packages of lights in each box so we
have 50 100 150 200 275 I made a little
boo-boo when I picked up my stain for
the fence I thought I got transparent
stain but I actually got red wood stain
I was just looking at this transparent
and I thought that would be clear would
not have a tint to it but I was wrong
let's just give it a shot
do you think the better red or natural
redwood or yellow would you guys think
so I asked me to not to keep Oreos in
the house because if we have Oreos I'm
gonna eat them so she buys this instead
only covered Oreo store cream coated
cookie coated almond snacks and they're
utterly amazing really high
welcome home princess what you got there
pretty mug there's no dots on how unique
wait there's dots as he talks just a
little bit you can tell oh oh
slow down I am gonna put some curtains
in the dryer finally we got some
curtains that are gonna fit this new
window shape here we wanted to have a
little pop of color for our chair over
there yeah I think that's gonna look
really good I'm excited about I'm hoping
to get them hung up we have friends
coming over for dinner tonight so I want
to get them ready for our friends come
over I don't know why I just do what is
this senia your pure box is closed

Thursday what is that I have no idea we
need a we need a water bottle play what
do they need oh you just break it
everything close your eyes okay they're
kind of close ready open Wow yeah that's
pretty red that's the reason we don't
have to put as many carbs I don't get
when it matches though it'll look nice
it's very deep orange what do you think
of the picnic bench something how does
it turn bread I stained it it
do you like it head scratcher
I think it's kind of cool but now it's
too dramatic for offense at least that
many coats is I have to put that many
coats because I'm using a spray gun and
when you use the spray gun it goes and
it leaves a little streak marks all over
it so you got to go over that multiple
times to get those streak marks cover it
up step one of my meal tonight is to
sautee the asparagus
