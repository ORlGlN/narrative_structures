not exactly sure how this is all going
to go down but I'm going to take it one
step at a time and I'm going to turn my
swimming pool into one giant emoji
either kills us for exterior that would
be good on class because I want total
class taken with sticks to pretty much
anything
the vinyl aluminum fiberglass
I need a big tarp sighs I need
all right all Prime it's time to get
paint to cover my 19 foot canvas
now I'm working on making the orange
color that is on the rim
don't worry guys we love you
you have to get the eyebrows right don't
you throw off the whole expression of
the emoji and we want this emoji to
express our love you guys
this is it guys
the moment of truth pull the fan basic
emoji crack under the pressure of six
thousand gallons of water
my bags I hope you enjoyed our fun video
we just wanted to express to you guys
how much we loved this journey with you
sharing our daily lives and emotions
with you every single day all the
experiences going back and forth you
