Street we were on it makes me feel proud
of our neighborhood although I do see

with a broom for this one okay
hey guys Juliet's doing some big girl
stuff uh-oh she got tired we're
practicing our sitting on mommy she went
all the way down like this but then she
put herself back up I think she's been
fed isn't it cute Elle mommy's said the
babes are doing good when they're just
not good that much at all I was cheering
her on rollerball like you're gonna be
such a good sitter one day like she has
high aspirations to be a good setter
no God loved mothers write their
opinions on their babies are just the
wild
speaking of opinions guys me used to do
this thing where she took surveys on
Opinion Outpost calm and she'd earned
gift cards for Starbucks iTunes Amazon
calm passive body where nothing buyers
and stuff like that and she would earn a
little extra cash like that when we're
tight on money and she'd go buy our
coffee with my remember Dora I earned
this gift card this is my coffee don't
worry about how I got it stuff of that
so if you guys are looking to make a
little extra cash there's going to be a
link in the description for Opinion
Outpost com go there do some surveys
give your opinion mommy opinion whatever
you might be armed opinions are very fun

Poussin that's true so I'm going to do
comment on the day while we head home
we're almost back to my car then we all
go our separate ways to see me comment
of the day goes to does Juliet drink
formula no she doesn't drink formula I
still breastfeed her but occasionally at
night I'll give her a little bit of rice
cereal mixed in with formula because my
supply has been so low I haven't been
able to pump ever since I went away for
the bachelorette party for my friend she
had had formula for pretty much too
full straight days and it kind of just
my supply just haven't seen since then
so I'm not able to pump anymore and
breastfeed her and yeah so when I'm away
from her she doesn't formula that's not
very often and that's why I brought her
tonight a little baby here because I
didn't want her to have you know I was
just riding in a car eating dinner
chatting and laughing anyways we had a
lot of fun we found out what our friend
is having at the boy CS tomorrow we have
a big jam-packed day don't forget we
love you
we're in this together
