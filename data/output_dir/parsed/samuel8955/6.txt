what up guys hey guys on tonight my
brother Michael here hey dumb buddy so
Michael I decided with little Abram here
of course that we're gonna cook some
popcorn tonight it's just such great
weather perfect weather over the fire
yeah yeah
opera fire just to roast some weenies
and cook some popcorn
chicks are here the chicks how cute look
at these ones over here so pretty this
one looks like a trough full of popcorn
kernels don't say little popcorn kernels
yeah did you have any pots and pans here
done so number this it's nice and flat
look he's one of these man we do
different flavors oh yeah a popcorn
fountain dude that'd be sweet what a
bummer no pots no pants no kettles and
have something here though what do you
think of that I think it's perfect
Haven what do you think of this come
here but it's not good size
what do you mean no too small too big
we're from Texas but bill bigger go home
don't you like popcorn
do you guys see a lot of people cooking
popcorn in these no I couldn't find
anything to cook popcorn in over here
this is all yeah that was the idea
we need some popcorn buddy how many busy
Citylink some you like sir you can't buy
out all our popcorn we don't eat out of
it Burt we're gonna have a popcorn party
tonight better come to wrap up one party
now we need oil for that basket of
popcorn Michael
they say that we're gonna go swimming in
popcorn yeah
there's 11 of those all right we made it
back to the campsite
this is where we're gonna cook our
popcorn right here over this bonfire
we have to use a laser level to throw a
level line across all our states so
they're all perfectly either because we
want this to be level because if it's
not that was gonna go to one side it's
gonna be tricky you ready bro I'm ready
it's good Michaels gonna gas it up here
we go
so looks like we've got enough oil so
far we got one in there and this is the
second one there you go
nice very nice over there
a flash around
oh yeah we take it off to you before we
ruin at all let's just drag it off we
got off the fire who did horrible making
us a part for it now
those bricks whimper Fricks yeah do
bricks don't try this at home kids or
adults I wouldn't suggest anybody try
this at home
I thought it'd be like a lot easier
getting the same level you sent me the
rough six box you need to fly it out a
little bit
yes popping we got to move them to there
see how tools it only needs like a
little puddle there yeah that's like a
perfect spot oh this is looking awesome
yeah it's a firework show it's like a
fourth of July it's beautiful Michael no
cry dude I'm trying not to cry you're
gonna cry
Michael's gone blind our neighbors just
arrived but what in the heck are you
Texans doing out there we are the only
people in the entire world probably that
have done this and sound play humans on
earth they have to pop this with popcorn

and it smells delicious
Oh
what do the pumpers on fire what are you
doing why are you backing up oh my there
goes the popcorn holy moly
that is hot Abram he burned the popcorn
sorry but I did it
no Uncle Michael did it awesome look at
that smoke that's crazy and just so you
guys are aware this wasn't done anywhere
near the trees this is a huge huge open
space we just wanted to make some
popcorn we should have stuck with the
fountain the popcorn fountain that was a
good idea yeah definitely popcorn
