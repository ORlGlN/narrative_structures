I'm just so overjoyed Nia so joy I face
time Nia after it happened and we all
kind of celebrated in the room there's a
couple reasons why it happened here I
felt God pressing me to talk to her
about salvation for the first time ever
after one of the kids who I was talking
about and having Jesus in their heart
and put his hand on Symphony's head and
said his Symphony saved and as I said
not yet and that didn't sit right with
me at all and then simply right after
that said I want to be baptized it's
like wow I'm necessary praying about it
talk to Mike about it and the fear is
the best thing to just get done right

Lucy Lily they're all going to a swan
