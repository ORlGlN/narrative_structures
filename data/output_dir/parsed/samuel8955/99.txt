what color do you think it is I think
it's blue stop let go of it everyone is
bingo time I've got one big blackhead
come on bud brass morning guys how are
you today this morning every man arguing
my little trailer fix I'm saving this
trailer for an ATV that I'm eventually
going to get for the property it's
pretty bad yeah it looks like I got a
little hole right there yeah yeah I'm
learning new tire definitely definitely
the bolts up the room attached to throw
stripped out so I'm gonna pop these out
go get some new ones I think it's worth
it this is pretty screwed
he's finally able to get it off get
brand-new tires on this guy it's
beautiful you ready to see what's inside
this thing what color do you think it is
I think it's blue well look at that
right there
what colors are those yeah that's what
color it is there's a metal frame inside
of it and funny
and I got this for the kids guys for
Oklahoma I decide on this guy over the
power wheel because this is faster and
stronger that's still electric though
it's not gas-powered which is really
cool is that this is yours Anson okay
and there's not a lot of options when it
comes to getting these things with
rubber wheels they're all plastic for
kids and I want him to have something
strong enough to go up the hills over
there and throw all the rocky terrain so
this thing should do the job
and this thing is really heavy
what you guys think of that bad boy I
got it all put together without
instruction did not come with
instructions you're supposed to go on
the website and find assembly video with
the stupid video is for a different ATV
anyway together but I'm missing a bolt a
very important bolt that goes right here
juliette probably took off with it could
be anywhere out here to give you guys a
little perspective on the power of this
thing a power wheel you can only get 12
bolts out of them the highest you can
get 12 volts this thing is three times
that and it goes 20 miles per hour power
wheel only goes 5 miles per hour but the
cool thing is you can set a speed limit
on there so I could prevent him from
going over a certain speed well of
course the rubber wheel delves a huge
plus gonna be fun to see him get on
there three out of this date down
finally got this thing going I've been
working on it literally all day so
earrings he's ran over it your tires on
top of your earring good cowhide one all
