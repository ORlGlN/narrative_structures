completely clean last night these kids
really know how to destroy it so funny
when Sam gets real motivated to clean
and he really goes a lot of cleans the
room and sees how quickly the kids can't
destroy it cuz like that's like me every
day all day I have a really cool photo
shoot this morning I'm about to head out
to go do just want to say good morning
right left I'm photographing a new menu
is that awesome I photographed a Mexican
food menu once before and the same owner
opened up an American food restaurant
and so I'm going there and doing that
today
that's gonna be fun I like to do
interesting or different shoots like
this

got a great poem to the family we're
gonna go out tonight and take my
computer another appointment
about an hour away at the Apple Store
that's the closest one to our house it's
funny because I had a conversation with
one of the owners and I worked for they
home several restaurants and I worked at
a couple of them but one of the owners
not the one you guys met that snowy but
another one we had a conversation
regarding what I'm going to do with my
life he said something discouraging to
me it's been a long time but I remember
it happening and I told him that I was
going to something big with my life so
that's kind of how the conversation went
but
it was really cool I got to talk to him
and kind of talked about where I've come
just feels good to prove to him my
determination and that I wasn't that I
was being serious when I told him that I
also feels good to prove to myself that
you know what I say I'm gonna do and it
kind of reminds me that what I want to
do now I should just go for it and stop
thinking so hard about it because back
then it was terrifying for me to be a
wedding photographer I think I've
already told you guys this but the first
couple of weddings I shot I was just a
nervous wreck wreck I'm telling you but
just feel good they seemed really proud
of me of where I've come and they knew
what was going on with YouTube that that
was awesome he said he sees me all over
the place on YouTube on Facebook and
stuff I'm just proud of myself guys and
I'm proud of me I'm just proud that
where we're going we're just chasing our
dreams
well encourage you guys don't be afraid
to take the plunge you know don't be
afraid to be uncomfortable
because once you get past that point and
it just feels so good you can keep
pushing yourself through uncomfortable
situations you just do it once and you
just want to keep doing
I'm excited about the future guys

juju again who won looks like Symphony
