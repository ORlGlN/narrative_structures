steer the plane
look at all those buttons Wow
to the steering wheel it's different
than a car huh
while or what
Oh to get iPads huh how cool is that
do you want to be a pilot one day now is
it just me and me getting over my
nervousness that there's like this
different kind of atmosphere in the air
form it's like everybody's looking at
each other as if it's that person's last
day to live or something weird cuz it is
here that way everything looking at you
like he's doomed
he's dooms she's doing I think was that
the test missed in any way why did we
turn I don't know why which is where are
we going
it's funny how we get on an airplane and
the first thing we do or I do as I pray
you know that God will be of the pilots
yeah you'll protect them and be with
them helping how to clear mind and a
steady hands I guess you don't know
sitting in for my plane you can but
anyway but then the plane takes off and
you're nervous about and you're still
praying a little bit and you get up into
the air and you level off and everything
becomes comfortable and you stop praying
and you just relax just like oh this is
no big deal
playing scared and that lasts quite a
long time and then we go to land and
then what do I start to do again I start
praying again do you yeah I did it into
this never was scary what does that
remind you of the praying going up the
comfort during the steady part and then
the prayers going down
I guess just like life yeah why like we
think like we God wait people start
praying you know God please show me the
right career that I need to get it to
show me what I need to go to school for
and once we find those things give me a
house give me a car number 12
and once we finally find those things oh
we start to get comfortable with stop
crime stuff furniture place
and then when death comes around we
start praying again right it's like fine
your life is like flying for me at least
I tried to get comfortable but I do I
get comfortable sometimes but I think we
forget that sometimes flights in midair
have problems too
so don't get comfortable guys you need
to worry about your soul or your life
continuously
