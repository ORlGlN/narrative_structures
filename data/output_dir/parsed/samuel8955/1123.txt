thank you babe
he usually takes a morning yeah like in
delenn's like mom it is like an hour
usually takes like an hour and a half
morning nap today it's just like I am
mapping you guys oh you guys are
probably wondering why we are okay with
celebrating Halloween as Christians so
let us answer that for you since a
couple of you guys have asked us on our
Facebook turn honey I'm depleting hitted
celebrate Halloween well cause it's fun
right yeah it's fun that's it this is
like a fun thing to do
i hunker the kids and the kids are going
to end up celebrating Halloween either
way I think and so we bring the kids
into a very godly environment on
Halloween which is in the form of a Fall
Fest Fall Festival at church I was not
allowed to celebrate Halloween at all as
a kid no dressing up no
trick-or-treating nothing I didn't even
go to my first Fall Festival until a 16
and that was at a church that I went to
a private school so they're bringing it
anyway
yeah I end up celebrating anyway is you
know a teenager now married adult no no
it's so commercialized now it's hard to
even get around in America so we don't
feel convicted though in Halloween we
stay away from the evil part and the
real dark part of Halloween of course
that exists but we choose not to be a
part of that when we do dress up it's
not we're not dressing up as the devil
or demons but anyway we stay away from
the dark side we just have fun with it
you going to be for Halloween I really
wanted him to be at lion see it's
nothing wrong with dressing up a kid
might simply be a fairy yeah I thought
about being Jack Skellington oh yes I
want him to do it because we have a
surprise for you guys
yes we do you're gonna do it chose me to
sing a song for mother before Christmas
