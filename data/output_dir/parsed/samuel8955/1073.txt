Symphony wills point Symphony and I are
at our very last exploration our last
one for the year at least we're gonna do
it again but this is our projects the
ending of our 52 a channel this is where
I used to explore as a kid that's why
I'm taking you here daddy used to come
here with Uncle David uncle Matthew
Uncle Michael and uncle Andrew we used
to explore it here a lot when we were
little like you and that's why I want to
take you here on our very last
exploration take a big step
come on big step Nia got her dressed all
cute so the special location on one
takes Tiffany - is that walking damn
it's in wolf point and here it is here
symphony of waiting behind me
well I blog and this is the talking damn
she scared walk on she says it looks too
big and I'm not gonna make her but this
is the talking damn and we lived right
down the road as a kid and us five boys
we used to come over here on a regular
basis and just like explore this whole
place we used to walk up on the dam we
used to go up and down the river that
the water runs into we still actually go
on top of these hills
alright we're headed back to the car I'm
still sleeping probably got two hours of
sleep last night go most of the way but
he relieved me for a couple hours
the goal of this challenge was to just
open up symphony to new worlds and to
show her new things while she's still
young and to show her that it's
important to explore everything even if
it seems like something she would it be
interested in I feel like it opens up
new opportunities and expand horizons it
um it fosters creativity and just among
many other things and just to show her
that the world is large larger than
herself and to look beyond what's in
front of her face if you guys want to
see more about our 52 week challenge our
exploration that we've been doing for
the year this co2 Symphony Raider calm
have been posting the pictures and the
little descriptions are right with them
and I'd like to teach her something at
each of the explorations today I kind of
talked her about control that she has
control over herself just like a dam
controls water overflow and I taught her
the importance of exploring I have fun
