it's early Christmas with Stephanie I
can't see his face
you guys get the whole town don't want
to play with them
yeah here's the little town all set up
isn't it cute this is what the kids
opening this morning they have this app
and they put their little animals in it
now they can play with it in real life
hi baby you playing blocks see ya yay
this is her first time playing with the
blogs like that she's enjoying she likes
it now that she can sit it's so cute all
three of our kids have had blocks like
this
this is Abramson Symphony set got
donated at one point before we had a
bromby and we got more and 'fl they're
so sweet I love seeing them play with it
they all love him just the same
oh hi Mia ha ha ha
what you doing there just trying out a
ponytail on Juliet's hair we just bought
this it's a very first one yes our first
ponytail this is Symphony's it's way too
big but we're just trying to grow now
like bam bam
she's so cute pebbles is it pebbles with
the little bell on top that's right I
have enough hair for it like she was
kind of molded in words and then you
could put a little clip like bow mommy's
phone definitely gosh it's been a very
exciting test three days we'll get my
truck but it is finally ready what buddy
not blended I know why look at my little
uh gummy bear red gummy there here nah
really I was supposed to get the truck
this morning at 10 o'clock but welcome
bad headache and turn into a migraine so
pretty much slipped away the day what
you're looking for you like that tweet
you like that tree jingle bells jingle
bells jingle all the way
are you guys gonna join me or not to
ride in a one-horse open sleigh hey
jingle bells jingle bells jingle way oh
what fun it is to ride in a one-horse
open like I think I'm works on it today
to get the car than I was to say I
bought it but it's natural because
you're supposed to separate the
experience of paint or something and
experience of consuming something
because usually pain is negative and
consuming it's positive and you put it
all together and do it in the same day
buy it and then consume it in the same
day at the same time it's just not as
pleasurable it's not as enjoyable so I'm
glad that our way to get the car
because the pain of paying for the car
it's kind of forgotten it's black
black on black and black
it was parked right there it's not there
anymore though I don't know what's going
on oh no does it go fast
Oh went for a second that was cool
