usually scurry around like a mad woman
trying to get everything kind of put
away so that when the kids are in bed I
don't have as much to do I've kind of
finished the kitchen this was a total
wreck earlier but this room
well guys another good day in the book
today was so good I don't know what
about it but it was just such a good day
and I realized that earlier I didn't
show you guys a close-up of my braces so
there they are
it looks really crazy you can totally
see the crookedness of my teeth by how
each bracket is positioned so you guys
remember my friend Emily I was in her
wedding last fall I was talking to her
today showing her my braces and it
totally just like took me back to junior
high we both had braces at the time some
other friends of ours had braces and we
were like all with each other when we
got our braces off with such a big deal
and it's just so funny how it just took
me back to that time you've been the
feeling I can like feel the light cuts
kinda already coming in on my gums just
like very minor right now I'm sure it'll
get worse over time but it's just like
reminding me of the weirdest things like
sitting in my desk marketing things out
with a red pin and listening to a
teacher talk about history pointing to a
map like it just had random flashbacks
because of the feel in my mouth right
now it's so crazy anyways guys we will
see y'all tomorrow I think we have
something pretty exciting planned for
you guys tomorrow I think it's something
you guys are going to like doing with
our kids so we'll see you guys there
don't forget we love you and remember to
love each other King I'll be the hand
that you get home when you can't make it
on your own
I promise you and not alone
but in this together
if we can say
