you make it plain that like the video of

really boring anything think this I wish
I do the point now we missed you me and
met with Amanda all we were touching
fillet how you guys had like what 15
minutes together it was so short it
really was yeah guys those have the
first time anybody he see people I kind
of just wanted to recreate it from you
guys and he had actually get it yes
comment of the day guys yes I'm going to
address the unnecessary title that I
made yesterday that I have since changed
the kotas logs and stuff seriously I'm
sure there's a better better title than
that because the title you chose is just
racist I do have to disagree with you
and think another Isis if that is racism
then the Toymaker making the option of a
black doll or white doll is racist or
Walmart giving us the option is racist I
was just making a statement saying which
one is she going to choose and it wasn't
she didn't think about it she chose the
black doll I could have put
african-american and Caucasian but
please don't call me racist I am far
from racist I love the black community
always have loved their churches
love how joyful they are a free-spirited
they are I hate that I'm meeting
defending myself right now but to sit
there call me racist over title like
that but with that being said I will
continue to be careful on what I named
our videos I know I say sorry lot but
I'm sorry for the ones I did offend
don't forget guys we love you and
remember to love each other
we're in this together
