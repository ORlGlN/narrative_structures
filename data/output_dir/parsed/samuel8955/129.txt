see what's up hey hey dumb butt huh how
was last night did I really keep you up
all night
pretty much come on that bed how's that
even possible
I was on my side the whole time you
really were you were kind of in the
middle kept putting your hairy toes on
me what would it give us sniffling to
what port you got mad at me you might
kick my legs like get off you serious I
was my like a tens of times I've had
enough sorry man was it on purpose then
kind of sick anyway we're off to the
Bible Museum you already go man I'm
ready to ride the bikes again definitely
not what a little uncomfortable
so excited about this guy
they said this museum took 500 workers
every single day for a full year to make
this museum and it would take you nine
eight-hour days to experience in time
and no one's ever done this before so
this is his yeah
and then well Nebuchadnezzar is what's
600 ish not your challenge of Mondays I
don't know 500 600 BC so this is really
interesting to me guys the Dead Sea
Scrolls which are the earliest findings
of the Bible the earliest manuscripts
are found in little jars like these or
pots like these they were found in a
cave this cave right here this is from
the inside of the cave kids were over
there tending to their flock and they
were throwing stones in the caves and it
hurts something breaking the cave so
they went up there to explore and they
discovered these pots and inside the
pots were many scripts of the Bible and
they found those girls it was a thousand
years earlier than what they previously
had evidence for the Bible
yes they recreated a whole sniffling
matter
the tools Jesus use man as a carpenter
oh wow this is a real plane
you got your wooden mallets here leave
that when you're doing your chiseling on
those a chisel right there look Jesus
chisel
hey Matt there he is the man of the day
for every season's fan basic and basic
basic hey best fans ever
to see the East from you so I was like
an interactive movie you had to get from
their seats in the Old Testament so now
so that video was a New Testament
portrayal of the Bible with beautiful
beautiful art and it was like a
panoramic view almost almost completely
around the whole room what do you think
bro you get like chills all over the
place man I get chills like crazy I
started to get actually a little bit
chilly because I was getting something
so speaking ayodhya fish yeah
hi yesterday we had requested a couple
pairs of slippers and they were brought
to our room but then we left and had the
room cleaned and they took them so I was
wondering if we could get a couple of
slippers up here okay how many pair do
you need probably ten now just two is
fine okay okay yes please all right I'm
going to take as our tech for Heath
tonight so don't keep him up hopefully
got a home yeah I do
it's the least I could do for a friend
I'm sure that you don't have to see you
hairy nipples dude really I don't want
them to know I've hairy nipples like
it's so embarrassing bro are guys common
with the day goes too young which I am
wondering about the history of the Bible
class that Sam was witches were taught
in school I think that would it should
be optional because of how many
different religions that are like the
Christians the Catholics the Jewish
religion and the atheists atheism isn't
a religion but all those other religions
you mentioned all believe in the same
Bible I'm saying despite any religion as
a new religion I think the history of
the Bible should be taught because
there's just so much there so much every
funeral history in the Bible I mean it
all occurred historical yeah I mean
exactly from a historical perspective
it's an affected cultures you know
millennion history is it's affected us
like crazy we just don't realize it but
anyway question the day I go see what is
your favorite museum that you've ever
been to art guys don't forget we love
you and remember to love each other each
other like you and your brother
guys listen up okay do I have
everybody's attention
due to the real man oh he was in here
partying
