like I'm satisfied denim downright sad
inside
tonight now have prepared for the bye
when they all this just dies out please
don't resist trust my
I wish I were still finding this back
I've dropped two times to come I thought
it true
I've begged off
and then some if I didn't care what
the past to make this fast slow to play
with
I just can't find this back kisses
building
not still
with
this
