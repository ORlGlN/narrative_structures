Juliet just keeps going and going and
going and if I look away she'll go what
oh my god see she says watch what I'm
watching as you can't figure it out Oh
good morning guys as you just saw Juliet
sliding down on the back of the couch
onto the cushions she's getting so so
big it's kind of unbelievable
and we kind of wanted to do something
really special since it's just her at
home today because Sammy's been
traveling so much he's missing out on
you know kind of a lot of her little
baby hood life so Sam decided that we
just have to do something over-the-top
really fun for her today while the big
kids are at school and we're about to
get started right now every baby loves a
duck right so what we're going to be
doing is filling up the bathtub with
baby duckies for a little baby Josie cuz
she bought rubber duckies she's got the
baby if she needed duckies in life so
first things first need to go hunt for
some ducks you know I've got some
buckets to go hunting for my duck so I'm
gonna put them I'm excited to do this
it's a big memory that we're about to
make and it's just something different
out of the ordinary that I think she
might remember she's little she might
remember later on I noticed when we do
extravagant things with the kids they
tend to remember them longer like
symphony remembers the big things we did
when she was like 2 years old so well
like these are the kind of things that
really stick in children's memories
first things first though guys if I'm
gonna go duck hunting
