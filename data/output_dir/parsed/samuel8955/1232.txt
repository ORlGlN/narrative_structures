Tanger I'm at Tanger and I needed to
exchange some shorts for a smaller size
and they didn't have a smaller size so
I'm just keeping the same shorts and
hoping that perhaps I'll finds them
online I don't know it's pretty
nostalgic being out here I just went
into the store that I managed my old
store maurices and they are getting a
new layout here we are passing it again
they're about to be getting a new store
and I'm just so excited for them that
was one thing that I was working really
hard towards when I was there and I'm
just really proud that they kept at
going and it's happening now I almost
did it in my career to stay home I was
very tempted to stay and just keep going
and moving up but I didn't and I'm glad
now that I did quit when I did because
if I stuck around and waited for a new
store or something new to happen in my
life as you know a retail manager my
kids would be almost four and almost 1
and I would still be working and you
know it's still just under way and I'm
just grateful I'm glad that God showed

just went in her room is she
she got a bottle of nail polish at the
foot of her bed and our pillow and she
was pretending to paint her nails while
singing frozen cute and pretending yeah
and I was like she didn't have the
notebook she didn't over him no I was
like simply you're not supposed to get
out of your bed she was like I didn't

bouncing around so I thought that was
just my feet in my bed I found my nail
polish under my bed and I just reached
down and grabbed the pillow I didn't
tell her she's so cute

though she played we were still really
proud of her she just couldn't talk and
she had to wait for the sleep to come
