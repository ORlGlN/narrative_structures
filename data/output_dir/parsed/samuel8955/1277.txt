going to do my hair in my makeup and we
are gonna go out with some friends that
we met at church

we're going to dinner and I believe
we're going bowling so we'll keep you
updated on that this is what I'm going
to be wearing tonight this blue dress
it's a maxi dress this was actually my
reveal dress when I was pregnant with
Abram I knew I was having a boy and
salmon Symphony thought it was a girl so
this is what I decided to wear to my
reveal party it's all different shades
of blue so I'm gonna go blow-dry my hair
and start getting ready and I'll talk to
you guys later this is how it is a mom
is getting ready not have the baby this
right here he wants and he hates it
why do you hate your daddy what's on his
mouth you ask I just gave him some
teething tablets some homeopathy
teething tablets
look you got relax okay all done with
blow-drying my hair had to take a break
in nurse Abram and now he's just gonna
go with me to get ready because he it
did not likin this he says no mommy you
are mine I like to get ready in
Abraham's room because there's a lot
more room in here so I'm gonna do my
makeup
I'm very minimal the way that I do my
makeup got eyeliner here this came from
my Birchbox it's liquid eyeliner Cynthia
Rowley mega plush Volume Mascara this is
what I've used like
my symphony I'm getting dressed clowny
cool I've used the same mascara for like
ten years and they have all different
colors I do yellow there's teal there's
like a turquoise or a purpley blue and
right now I'm using the teal today but
my favorite one right now is actually
big yellow I like that one longer and
then I really like this this also came
from my Birchbox it's lip and cheek
stain it's called Bennett Benetint I'm
almost out of it so I use a little bit
of this too it's bronzer I've also had
this for a very long time
it's just mineral makeup I don't know
what brand it is and I don't wear a lot
of makeup like I don't wear it every day
when I do I don't put on a lot so my
makeup tends to last me a long time I
can use like I've had this for over a
year and it still works fine and I like
it so now I'm gonna do my makeup now so
I'm gonna do my hair I use a
straightener to curl it to get like
beachy curls I use a Corollas down the
middle I just started the front and I
take my straightener like this and I
curl it backwards do this anyway so I do
this all pretty much all over I skip
some spots and then I'll show you the
final product okay so I'm all done
curling my hair with my straightener but
I don't leave it like this this is just
like I don't know this reminds me what
my mom used to do my hair when I was a
little girl these kind of curls so what
I do now is I want straight I get my
hairbrush and I just run my brush
through my curls see how they just like
fluff right out makes like really nice
beachy
liking curls and I try not to go like
down with it I try to like brush my hair
out because I want the curls to go out
and so then I take my hair and I like
twirling around and stuff and then just
a tiny bit you don't want a lot always
got a that Texas hair going so there you
have it that's how I do my hair I'm
ready for my date
I told java's gonna wear this dress
earlier but then Sam reminded me that
we're going bowling can't wear that
dress bowling so now I gotta go pick out
a new outfit I have no idea what every
where it's getting dark messy bedroom
messy bedroom I had to take Abram
walking walking and we were walking and
talking

that we're going bowling I love to
I can put quite a hook on my bowling
ball he really can't
he beats everyone I don't know about
that that's not true at all I miss Jan
I'm not that good I can just put a hook
on it and if I could get the hook just
right I can do fairly good I can get at
least a hundred points and I get like
twenty getting ready to start our date
night we're almost there and I've been
thinking about why it's date night so
important um you know it's it's just a
night to regroup as a couple you know to
get that together this that kind of
sometimes is missing when you're at home
one's at work or one's cleaning when you
know whatever dealing with the kids and
then with the vlog it's also important
for you know communication you have
communication to be able to for me I
feel like to be able to sit and have a
conversation without a child you know
makes a difference big difference and
you know just what was I'm also um I've
read several times that having
going out on novel dates like going
bowling doing something different aside
from just going out to eat and watching
a movie
yeah something assigned to support your
quality of the marriage as well as the
sex and that's important that's always
important and it does you're doing novel
things just think about it when you go
do something different dear wife it just
may just brings back that excitement to
marriage just for a little while and you
got to keep doing it definitely it was
really cute because today I was
explaining to Symphony what was gonna
happen because her nana is at at our
house watching the kids and normally
Symphony gets a long time with Nana so
she's not used to sharing her sauce
trying to explain to her how she was
gonna have to share her with Abram and
whatnot and she was like you're going on
a date a grown-up date and first of all
the first thing in my head was like wow
like we are doing something wrong if
Symphony doesn't know that Sam and I
date each other so that's got to change
- huh then second of all X ha ha ha ha
what he's just kidding and then we I
explained to her that he's very
important for mommy and daddy to go on a
grown-up date because we love each other
so much and we need to spend time with
each other cuz we enjoy each other's
company and sometimes it's just so we do
date we did about once a month yeah you
never explained it yeah I'm just never
explained to her that's what I meant
I need to just change that so anyways I
explained it to her and she seemed
really excited about the fact that Sam
and I were going on a date
I don't know and she loved that she was
having a baby she did I was like sent me
by I love you she's like don't forget
mommy
