out of this row
hey we'll come sit by me but especially
your skirt can you sit on the other side
at the best seats in the house guys
those little things in their seat right
here so if you feel something whacking
your legs that's what it is we're headed
up to the hotel now we'll go get mommy
some food and then we'll probably head
on to the airport I'm sad
little mention New York today
cutting open up we're all stinky we're
booze so at one point I was wondering
how long I had left to pack the bags I
was trying to see how far away Sam was
and he wasn't texting back into his vide
with the kids so I just looked up the
app on my phone to see how far away he
was and he was 1/4 of a mile away then I
went back to do something I came back
and I noticed on my phone it was a half
a mile away and I went back to do
something else and then they were point
6 miles away where Micah Newton almost
came back there were a full mile away it
sounds like I don't know if he's lost or
especially I don't know but I guess
they're exploring I wasn't good thing
turns out they were lost and I probably
could have just let him know that's all
that York City
there you go with that thank and we
looked at in the car broom our flight
was canceled so we have to figure
something out here honestly I really
know what to do without it so hopefully
we can get a flight that's pretty soon
and not later all right
remember thermal yeah
where do we go well the tarmac guys for
a shuttle
we got our flight change now we have to
go to Detroit or layover we're not going
to get home filling
Oh
you want me to make your box and cloud
so no can't hear ya kinder surprising
they make their own songs of are kind of
like a KitKat they learn to find excuses
there's also no mention as a parent you
want to have like total control over
what you like they're heating and then
there's also long times where you have
to release that control and just kind of
let them be free second an airport for
two hours and Counting is one of those
moments where we kind of have to choose
to let them have some freedom it's my
wing like a key tip of the day
I put a little blue yeah oh shoot guys
on your head boy it was like it was
scary coming down there was a storm
that's why our previous flight was
canceled so we had to go all the way
around out to come into the west side
but coming through it
I like dropped a couple times is
terrifying you can see the whole cabin
shake on the inside
and you see all the people's head to go
up and you come back her beating good
I'm glad your hearts beating we want to
welcome all the smelly billions before
say good night tonight yes thank you for
coming along we're so excited to have
you a part of our family now we're
officially basic belly in and this is
what we tell our fan basic and now we're
going to tell you guys don't forget we
love you and I remember to let me
