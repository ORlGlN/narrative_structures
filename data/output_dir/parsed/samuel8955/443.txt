look Ivan got the ways in there like
Santa Claus and everything comment of
the day guys was picked at random today
Sara Talbert hey Mia I hope to have kids
and I'm wondering how old they should be
to till I stop breastfeeding Sarah I
wouldn't be too concerned about the
right now let's take it one step at a
time let's uh find the men your dreams
let's get married let's have you know a
couple or a year maybe at least
you guys work on that marriage and learn
each other and then have babies and then
let's see if we could get through the
the pregnancy that's a hard thing to
come through to get through but as far
as breastfeeding goes when you get to
that point in your life I'm thinking I'm
talking to probably a 13 14 year old
maybe 10 year old when it comes to that
point you want to breastfeed your child
for as long as they'll latch onto that
nipple because the milk is so good for
them so good for their immunity and it's
so good for the bond between the mom and
the baby and it's also good for the
husband and the father if you're not
breastfeeding then you're bottle feeding
and when that happens the couple
generally takes turns the dad gets up
and feeds in the middle night and the
mom does but when you're breastfeeding
the dad doesn't ever have to get up it's
always the mom because you got to go
breastfeed this is something that can do
except change the diaper here and there
which I wouldn't suggest but anyway yeah
knows my thoughts on it we'll see you
guys tomorrow for that stuff I mentioned
um don't forget we love you guys
remember love each other
but in this together
