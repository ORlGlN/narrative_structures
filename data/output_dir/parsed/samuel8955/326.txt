of comment about this here you are my
brother you are my sister made by the
same guy loved by the same heart lift up
two things up we've got to give oh we're
in this together together
a depressed I heard this really cool
thing on the radio about depression the
psychologist or doctor claimed that most
of the world's depression which is the
number one disease in the world right
now has a lot to do with FOMO fear of
missing out sounds comical but if you're
one of those people who like to be on
their phone when you're with the friend
then you suffer from FOMO fear of
missing out moms out there will
understand Juliet fit me while she was
nursing the other night and she's bit me
since then three more times on the same
side excruciating pain I did not even
want to get dressed before you because
again this morning in the same side on
the same time she's shaking the camera
oh I'm going to bite it
I'd rather you bite that I'm putting
linseed oil another shelf from redoing
and it just looks beautiful on board
especially oak wood the grain in there
you guys can lost like this so simple to
get into things just requires one hand
could be dark outside you just do a
combination up up down left right look
at this boy he totally took it to heart
when I said he could get dirty are you
glad mommy said you could get dirty just
got a choose to let our kids get dirty
outside sometimes moms it's hard because
you want to keep things clean and nice
and neat and in order sometimes it is
really time-consuming but I am thankful
that had that realization today it's
kind of jelly
