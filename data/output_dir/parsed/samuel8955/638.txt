- cute good morning guy my brother you
are my sister made by the same guy loved
by the same
we've got to live
we've got to give love
in this together good morning guys I've
got to show you all what we're having
for breakfast today so we got this big
huge box of peaches at the orchard the
other day for twenty dollars basically
because they had fallen on the ground
before picking date so I made an
overnight peaches and cream oatmeal and
here's what it looks like looks
delicious but now we're off to something
really special for the final countdown
five days left
we sure do look at we're twins today
crippling triplets and that would mean
three of us match
oh yeah Juliet so what you're thinking
oh you're so cute I mean even think
about that first off is our favorite
place what is it that little bit that we
up and we're gonna get some little jelly
cubes and coffee we're gonna have some
good talks and play a game don't you
maybe it'll lift me up any I know you're
so tall now and I can yell Oh
do you know why we're having a
five-year-old day today why a million
that's right there's only five days left
in the final countdown first thing we
have to get our library cards replaced
yes
I know I mean because we both lost ours
hey perfect chase a symphony got her
booked and she's about to check it out
can you show us which one you chose
do you remember what it's called mm-hmm
well can you read it ma'am it's the
first two words good job with
Miss Mary Mack good job that's what it
says good job baby
me and Symphony had such a sweet time
you guys we're home now we're just kind
of relaxing
we were out pretty much all morning and
came home around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. and
so she's a little exhausted so we're
just having some down quiet time
in-between her date with me and her date
with Daddy Abrams playing to two trains
are you gonna hang out with mommy
tonight Oh Tiffany I'm all ready for you
where are we going it's all up to you
wherever your heart desires would you
wanna go yeah you gotta think of Home
Depot Wow careful with that thing dude
this is fun guys I get to take Stephanie
on a date night or spoiling her today
I'll probably end up buying her a toy or
something I don't know if any it did the
same thing but you know what today is
about just recognizing symfony as the
oldest child and making sure she she
knows that we love her and that um that
things are gonna change we do that
Kempsey when Juliet gets here we're not
gonna love you any less
wouldn't love you more you know I've
been Julie yet no we're gonna love you
we love you more every single day
let me just say guys I'm pretty proud of
me and I the way were going about
parenting we didn't grow up and very
stable homes I didn't have a father look
up to and so all these decisions that
we're making are based off I'm just
thinking about what it looks like to be
a parent and um planning ahead and
having an action plan that is done out
of love you know as long as you're doing
something out of love for your children
you can't go wrong I think a lot of
parents don't act because they're afraid
of failing
so they fail because they don't even act
but anyway honey where are we going
still are you gonna figure it out about
the head out of the driveway what do you
want to go what buddy
can you give me a kiss come on I mean
huge there's no other suggestion what I
think I should whisper in daddy's ear
what
whisper it Tommy what I was thinking
Lucy's plane there's nothing you want to
watch we could even go to Chuck E Cheese
what do you say that loud I won't do
that instead of a movie either whoa ROH
other cool day
don't get me wrong guys this isn't about
knee and eye this is about Symphony but
I think a lot of parents I feel like
they think the end product of raising
kids is about the child and how they're
going to turn out how they're going to
behave the raising children is also and
a lot about being a parent and a person
I think being a good parent helps helps
shape you into being more like Jesus and
to just being a better person overall
here we go Chickie's
you're supposed to stay together
y'all ready play
25 tickets yes with my ticket sis good

different game

she said yeah simply got this for Abram
a sword and shield he is he's gonna love
that and she decided on the bikini
Barbie unfortunately you ready to go you
want to play with that thank you
alright guys the days over I think one
of the best traits to have and a child
is gratefulness thankfulness she's
Symphony has just been so thankful she
thanked me so many times on the way home
it just made my heart so happy she's
like this was the best date ever
it was just such a beautiful thing
beautiful thing to see in your child I
loved it so much comment of the day a
few of you are asking this question and
this one comes from Olivia T did you
guys choose this to do on day six
because she has six letters in her name
and the answer is yes and today we did
five so all about the five-year-old all
about the five year old so what do you
thinks gonna happen on day two that's a
little hint pretty good oh what's you

remember to love each other
