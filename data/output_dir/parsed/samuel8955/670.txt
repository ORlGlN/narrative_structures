all right God before the vlog starts
today let me apologize for yesterday's
24 frame rate you guys made yourselves
loud and clear that you did not like
that
and I want you to back up my cell phone
from afterwards upload to YouTube and it
didn't look as good as it did on my
laptop so today most of the day will be
in 24 but for the rest of today's vlog
and tomorrow I'll go back to 60 it's not
the cameras to frame rate I think so you
guys just tell me it doesn't look bad
right now it's in 60 now I think 24
isn't good for handheld video anyway
guys enjoy the vlog today

Queen was so nice to reschedule our
cleaning to two o'clock this two o'clock

price which is that I'm getting his

Museum of Natural History this trip was
just like any other Raider trip very
unplanned we just took off or like what
should we do today so that's what we're
gonna do right honey that's right and
this right here is mr. Yukon
I Love New York City I love over to a
couple of youtubers and either honey
this is where I ran this morning right
over here I read it about three and a
half miles this morning go running but
it ended up being like four cuz I got
lost so many times and it took me about
50 minutes because I just stopped so
many times for people and for lights
running in New York City requires some
skill and some experience in order to do
it you know successfully I feel like I
went a little bit faster I usually do I
think because the motivation and the
energy of the city just makes you want
to run fast
god bless man take care
this is exciting I'm gonna get it in
stacks
guy's legs a compliment your eyes no
memory no memory ice cream now this
place is awesome
but now I have to go up all those stairs
I mean really tights compete Wow look at
that this awesome
there's some really nice people here in
New York one guy help me get this
upstairs and another guy watched it as I
went inside to give me the camera yeah
it's like man you guys are awesome and
then a couple other guys help me get
through the rotating door with this big
ol thing
she's so sensitive she looked at the
dinosaur I was like it's Anna said mommy
means it

cities are more dead sheis our kid
a jungle book
this is like looking at an art piece
guys like a painting on a wall
that was the daddy
by the spider going to be looking down
and made everyone's pump to the side
we're going to be looking down loudly
chairs it
well have you ever wondered how it all
began
wife
the earth
the answer lies to the stars because the
father arms into space we look the
further back in time
that was pretty incredible guys everyone
were you scared in there Tiffany lovely
they're just extremely immersive I felt
like cousin space once it opened up
looking at this floor it's like you're
looking through a hole into space
30 billion years ago guys a single atom
exploded it's everything that you see
now and they know this because of a
little bit of photons that will flip
behind what happened this is the way I'm
trying to get down to my new diet
or 0 48 pounds
is it awesome
I can't imagine digging to hold my
backyard and finding a bone and then
keep on digging and finding something
like this
that's how they found these things right
I've always dreamed about when I was a
kid which to dig holes all the time
looking for fossils

territory
look at that face
that was the goal his whole body looks
like
we were one-and-a-half miles from the
hotel and we've been driving for 30
minutes is that not crazy
