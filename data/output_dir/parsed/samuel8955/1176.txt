wear pull-ups anymore do you just feel
like a big girl symphony you do what
makes you feel like a big girl
sadly yeah but with April we have some
visitors and Abram is just stressing his
little friend out Halen brought me some
spray paints I can finish my project I
went to Walmart to get some today and I
forgot about it had the worst Walmart
experience ever oh I forgot to finish
telling you about that we got kicked out
of line at Walmart then I got outside
after doing the self checkout and I
realized I didn't check everything out
I'd meet Heidi underneath my purse look
at these cute little monkeys crawling
around he was like mom I think he's
figured out that when he crawls on his
knees out here it hurts him so he
started bear-crawling Wow can you walk
oh I'm getting ready to work on this
shelf from doing some nighttime crafting
it's kind of breezy out here tonight and
so I have paint like all in my arm it's
kind of a weird feeling I feel kind of
bummed because I did some of it I guess
kind of thick when I first started
springing it on and there's bubbles in
some part of it can you'll see those
bubbles I'm really excited about this
though it was all like a rusty orange
color gray and very deep olive army
green it was ugly and I'm making it
white and coral and cheery okay guys I'm
gonna say good night here I hope you've
all had an awesome night and we will see
you all on tomorrow's vlog
