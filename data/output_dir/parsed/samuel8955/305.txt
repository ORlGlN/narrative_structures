don't kick me out of here and show me
right
a mess together didn't say good morning
can they sink can you say that
go say good morning go say good morning
say good morning Saturday yeah sorry
about that
and of you Wow yes hey girls how you
doing out there I say girls because most
of you are young females I wanted to
offer you some encouragement this
morning something's been on my mind
these kind of things I feel like God
puts on my heart
recently I happen to hear that Facebook
is a type of foam well for people that's
why they get on there for fear of
missing out and in doing so they're
actually missing out and they're
actually showing with studies that
people who spend more time on Facebook
are less satisfied with who they are and
they are more likely to compare
themselves to other girls so I want to
challenge the fan basic our younger
females especially to take a break from
Facebook for a while I think you'll find
that your confidence will improve you'll
stop comparing yourself so often on the
people and feel more comfortable in your
own skin and who you are anyway
hope you'll block today now what are you
doing
did you find a little Cappy you spend a
quarter on the floor nice dangerous who
do you get do you be in daddy's big
helper oh we're like so fun out here
hi like Juliet she always notices when I
get my nails changed alright Juliet you
all ready to go for our walk
let's do it you hear the doggie trust in
him say our
politely for lunch I've been giving
Juliet location of cheese and bread
broken up like a little cheesy bread
sandwich and she loves it here you go
little princess cheese one at a time one
at a time it is time to move on to
Abrams room this is all the laundry you
saw me doing last night I usually pile
it in front of their doors at night and
I take care of it in the morning all
right so we have Sam Abrams Symphony all
that's left to do is Jill D and myself
and that will happen over the weekend
I'm so calm to God it's very nice being
ahead of the ball when it comes to
packing for a trip especially one like
this one we're going to need extra
clothes we're going to be getting wet
and sweaty and it's going to be so much
fun whoa we got to take a body on her

yes sir that that is the sound of a man
in the making it goes back to the
conversation this morning guys
in his Facebook page people aren't
creating things that are permanently
tangible and I think that's missing a
lot of people's lives and I know when I
get outside and I start making something
something I could say hey I made this
I designed it with my hands it's here
it's permanent there's a satisfaction
being met and that's missing when you're
on Facebook and you're on nothing but
the internet go create we're made to
create our Creator created and were made
in His image
