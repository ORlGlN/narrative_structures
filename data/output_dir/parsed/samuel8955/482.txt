moment I feel very regretful that I did
that to him especially watching it back
again and seeing how badly he reacted to
it he almost went into like convulsions
or something I scared him just like so
bad and I watched it back because I was
reading some you guys's comments and you
were pointing out that last year I guess
his last year that I had told you guys
that I wasn't going to provoke my
children anymore and that was a problem
I had provoking my children and is
unbiblical and know something I won't be

not mistaken I actually asked you guys
to hold me accountable and that you have
