day in Iceland where the chili is extra
worm and the people are extra cold I'm

unique about Iceland and things I've
noticed so far and this morning a couple
things I noticed in the bathroom the
handles to get like this and they have
less cold water than they do hot water I
cannot find how to flush to it and while
I was looking I accidentally elbowed it
it's a big old button the flusher the
water when you first turn it on stinks I
rinsed up my mouth after I brush my
teeth and I literally gagged because the
sulphur is so strong tastes like rotten
eggs that you put leave it on for a
minute

the corner of the shower and the trash
