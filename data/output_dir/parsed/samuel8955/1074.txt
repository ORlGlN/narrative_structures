Manitou telehandler there was I think or
two hours but we're going Dick's
Sporting Goods and buy a new GoPro I
have to have them because we're doing
that lip-sync for the Jimmy Fallon show
lip-sync battles so I'm gonna get a new
GoPro so I can do that and I'm just
going to consider it covered by Jimmy
Fallon because they're paying us for it
not very much but enough to buy all my
GoPro stuff so it's pretty cool we get
to do lip sync and they're giving us a
GoPro I'm excited because I want to get
an update on GoPro anyway it's always
asking me if you're gonna be depressed
about it and hold like yeah right now
I've got an excuse to go buy new one to
this there it is guys a GoPro Hero 4 I'm
also going to get a suction cup symphony
has for me already here this is gonna
help stick them to the window we have to
worry about mounting it on the dash
anymore and then I'm probably gonna get
an extra battery
we need a store clerk to help us they
have the key to take it off of there the
GoPro is now in our possession
I'm so excited to have a hero for it's
too good to be true
I'm so excited to unbox it I was really
nervous that we weren't going to be able
to get it because I left my wallet at
David's house of all the things I left
my wallet my license me his license all
my cars
luckily Mia had a card in her wallet so
we're able to paper gas to get home and
David took a couple pictures of our
licenses just the kids we get pulled
over not that I'm gonna be speeding
anything
it has been a long trip so far I guess
as you know heard him hello we're only
in Alabama and we've already made like
four songs and Matthew died injured left
and they made it home back to Terrell
and all they made was more stops the
whole entire trip it's been our crazy
I know like if you drink a lot of water
so they're surrounded now to talk to you
guys about all the way up here how David
and I are very close now it was just
sort of distant I feel like we really
bonded and our relationship came
together as brothers I just kind of had
a like a have a breakthrough in
relations brothers
so that's really cool bro
the first
so right now we are gonna go work on our
lips II prefer to be felt and we've got
a long way to go so we are going to
really nail this lip sync I'm so excited
about it just like as it gets closer and
think we're filming it tomorrow
and I'm just so excited is 1157 it is
about to be tomorrow so we're going to
take us
pick up right here in three minutes
Sam has taken Symphony on their very
last exploration for 2014 I'm going to
