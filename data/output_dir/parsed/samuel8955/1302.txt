like to garden every year even though
I'm really bad at it I still do it every
single year and I like nothing ever
lives but it's art Charlotte but it's
just still so fun to do it and I'm a
homemaker and so like I'm supposed to do
stuff like that so ok so last year I
spent like please oh look at Sally hi
Sally so um
okay so longe are spent way too much
money on really cheap ugly pots like
even the ugliest ones at Walmart are
really expensive so this year I decided
I'm going to paint my pot and make a new
again and so I got all these spring
colors like coral and lavender and I was
for the garden turquoise
yeah therefore outside so anyways I'm
really excited about this because these
these paints are here only costed costed
only class $10 sugar and to buy all new
pots would have been like like 30 or 40
bucks even for like the cheapest time
England or and I don't want to reuse the
same colors I have because they're just
really like luckily they're red and
yellow
it looks like kind of pumpkin flicking
in my yard
like area that we using like this we
like this weird rectangle right in front
of our house it just gets harder
we can get a shape structure that we
really like
flowers in the vegetables I usually grow
tomatoes onions and squash and last year
kind of abate I got one squash and like
three tomatoes all year long
and yeah so
job good job baby
