you ready to get out one arm this arm

hardly resist my anymore
oh my goodness you guys I was talking
with the doctor about changing my birth
control because it making me feel a
certain way and so she had me come over
to do a pregnancy test we were done with
the appointment or meeting she was like
I just gonna do one to be sure because
these symptoms you're telling me about
they sound like pregnancy and I was
complaining I had just this birth
control makes me feel pregnant I felt
tired and loaded and moody and all that
so you know I take a certain one because
I'm breastfeeding anyways no wait I am
like 75% sure that I'm not pregnant but
anytime I take a pregnancy test that is
recommended by my doctor I get a little
nervous my heart's beating pretty fast
right now actually five New York City

real good good bye
my dad together you wanna stay nobody
know
I was taking home taking home
this is what way
yay pokey
not sure if you heard that other nurse
picked her head in there but it was
negative
all those heart palpitations for nothing
oh goodness don't get me wrong always a
beautiful blessing especially having
lost a baby before I would be overjoyed
if they came back there was a small
percentage of me that was kind of hoping
she was gonna tell me it was positive
but a very very very large percent was
hoping that it wasn't I'm just not ready
yet and I know these things are up to
God and so that's why I say if it was
positive I would be overjoyed and happy
now I've gotta go pick up symphony she
wrote at home with a friend of her so
that I can come to this appointment
