on one of the so bad walls in New York
that I had it mailed to this hotel so I
could receive it today and use it cheer
while I'm in New York I'll show you guys
what this does soon enough basically it
rotates 360 degrees or actually it can
keep on spinning and do time lapses as
long as the battery will last it'll keep
on spinning very very slowly or you
could have it's been the fastest it'll
spin I think is a minute guys it is 1
a.m.
ok not 1 a.m. almost 1 a.m. me and I
have a smart idea of going to bed early
we got some shut-eye at around 5 o'clock
so we tried it out and everybody's
wide-awake we woke up at what I hope at
8:00 everyone else woke up Abram woke up
around 9:30 everyone else woke up around
10:00 so we're like a super late nap

well sleep schedule I'm sure you guys
have noticed the video looks a little
bit differently today I'm using a
different candidate but not just that
I'm using a different frame rate I'm
trying 24 as a more cinematic look we've
been shooting 60 frames per second and

shooting that 24 frames and just kind of
