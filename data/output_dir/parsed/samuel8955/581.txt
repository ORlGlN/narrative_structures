the waterproof outfits and it's also
been raining a lot on the way up here
I'm just really nervous and excited
about you man I'm excited

behave the way I do so though I
understand it now and I maintain your
manliness right yeah it's super manly up
my kid not having a good time by the way
he's a really good travel partner
easygoing really poofy but but I have to
so it works I don't know if I can bring
the drone in the backpack oh yeah we're
getting close we are getting closer you

extra happy to be together there's some
about being in nature and with the
person that you love most that just
brings so much which one you go down we
go that way go behind it or that way and
get a higher view of it okay we'll just
do both then oh wow so small
look at it guys look at that
Sakura buddy oh sorry guys got a
buzzing-noise on all the previous
footage I had Wi-Fi on and it causes
interference come on Mike slippery
yes praise God for beautiful beautiful
nation

this kind of thing very motions giving
took like God and it's just you have to
make this type of experience so
incredible
it felt longer socks on
it was a madman
it's so powerful the sound of it hitting
water does this sound like water hitting
the guy that smells like planks of wood
just coming down put the magic feel like
just stand right inside there take a
shower it's a fighting life

little thing right here not sure because
it's just too much yeah we're trying to
walk that City is useful
dude really
does incredible guys I'm still in Oliver
you can't wait to see the drone footage
our next stop is I don't know we don't
know it in this office but we're headed
for the glaciers hey that shot right
there we're in somebody's driveway but
we're trying to get to that waterfall
look I'm massive that is yep there she
is
alright you guys ready for the big
reveal this is probably at least double
the size is the last one right yeah at
least double maybe even triple we saw
this we're like what the biggest
waterfall we have ever seen
look at this thing oh my G
with that is incredible so we are going
to make the hike up there there's a hike
all the way up to that spot and Mike and
I are going to make it and I'm gonna fly
my drone from there so to get some cool
shots coming over the waterfall because
at the last location I try to do that
from the bottom that couldn't go back
very far because I lost signal really
quickly because it because the top of
mountain got in between me and the drone
you ready to go hike that or do you want
to get as close to the campers don't
wanna get close down here for some
gopher oh yeah a couple selfies first in
my camp
Oh
this is your idea the steps are gone
you're gonna make it man you gonna make
the Paris oh yeah
he's bringing in here for both of us so
I keep going was it worth it okay I
guess pulling a few more steps might as
well I don't know it's literally right
there these are the last four steps I
don't have to get to go any further I'm
turning around I can't keep going I
can't do it Mike I'm too tired to keep
going I can't make it man we'll do it
together okay
Wow
I can't believe we actually did did I
need my bronchodilator
three
here for a big hole of mist maybe
there's better angle over here
I came through my drought but that's
okay
this doesn't seem legal
I made it guys made it to the tippy top
of Iceland
well I can go home and say I did it
from the back off of here very slowly
whoa most exhilarating part of the troop
so far by far I'm going to stay away
from them just as it falls all be blamed
for pushing them you know
Wow why didn't I get my drone on over
here
I should have kept walking Texas is a
nicel in check it out I'm gonna make one
video of all the drone
for the Bison
but I think now instead of going the
glaciers we're going to head back home
and check out the city
gotta make the hike back down it should
have a slide on the Malheur instead of
climbing it you just lie down we're
going to check out this other overlook
here somebody said this was better than
the top one Oh
keeps going oh wow it was a cave up here
too yeah don't there's any dragons in
there right now I bet there is
hibernating oh pretty pretty civil up
here
yeah
Burgie this guy
I need to go up there
you
