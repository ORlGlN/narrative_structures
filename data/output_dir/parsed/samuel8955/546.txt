to give love

in this together good morning everyone
it is a beautiful Friday morning which
means Symphony has no school so we are
off to a play date with some of her
friends today be excited I already have
next Friday's play date lined up to this
family lives about 25 minutes away from
me and so I am having such a nice time
in the car listening to worship music
it's kind of quiet Juliet's ready to for
her morning nap so I was just going to
encourage you guys when your car if
you're feeling like you can't really get
away just make the most out of your car
time usually that's a really good quiet
time for me even though I'm with kids
and it's just a nice time to have the
radio cranked up listening to worship
music and just refilling your soul which
I totally need it for made at dad
playdate my friend has four kids her
little boy is two weeks older than Abram

bit of mom talk while the kids played

from our playdate and we were supposed
to go somewhere really fun as a family

Sam's gonna stay and work on the room
and I'm just gonna because I really want
it to go so I'm gonna do enchiladas corn

Poe of Abraham's tears except now your
eating is very fun oh it's so sweet what
do you guys do when they're toddlers
don't eat dinner you make them go to bed
hungry aren't you giving one banana
shouldn't say that I'm thinking told you
give me a banana no way we're eating
dinner twice voice yeah you lie too baby
bananas make one big banana
I throw baby bananas away did you guys
know 50% of all produce is thrown away I
thought about that when I threw where
those babba Nana's that's crazy
really 50% of the produce that is put in
stores versus throwing garbage that
makes me sad economy bowls
yes the meatballs
now hold you over for a couple days you
might be Bach oh I see you like it buddy
ya wanna use my chili I can't stop
eating this honey it's so good
don't you like it
okay guys it's a finish off our night I
just read an article about the first
week of school it's pretty much known
like all across the board that the first
week of school back to school towards
the end of it begins to be like meltdown
time and that has totally been true in
our house the evenings have been pretty
rough with symphony and some of the
suggestions in this article was saying
that like on Friday and Saturday of the
first week of school you should have
like lots of bubble baths and movie time
just lots of downtime so that the kids
are not provoked to have bad attitudes
and bad moods and so I wish I had known
that before going on that playdate today
I think it was fun for symphony and she
doesn't go to school on Fridays but I
still possibly might not have done that
but she did good she handled it well so
I'm gonna take that suggestion and end
our first week of school night with a
movie I wish for the add pop Clark you
know we love pop oh so do you
I am whoa
maybe that's why she couldn't know today
super that that was in ooh
Avram he'll be late bundle it up - one
no idea what this symphony make you feel
safe buddy that's so sweet
remember what we did left because a lot
into our dough pow good labor let's make
our little bucks
what a great day to go play in the rain
hey I don't think it
we're really stormy
oh I'm taking a shower
right guys
awesome whoo kind of a bummer that the
color changed here boy burning bush
story watch the fire and saw that the
bush was not burning
he went closer then a voice called to
him from the fire Oh Sam's taping off
the wall back there and all the kids are
asleep all three of them and I'm going
to do comment of the day it comes from
Dean Norton we had a huge unanimous
comment of the day today
seriously cried when the flashbacks with
Abram happened it's so sad yet so great
you guys have come such a long way
raising him into a little gentleman

way to wrap up everyone's feelings for

sweet and amazing all at one time

pretty fun day planned gonna wrap up
