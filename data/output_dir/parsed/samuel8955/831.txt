plants are growing around this tree guys
these were small when I planted them I'm
really proud of these these things I
never have luck with grunt plants out
here these ones however I cannot get

maybe that's what's going on
oh man as you guys know we've been
having a lot of dog drama around here in
our neighborhood dogs keep trying to get
in and get Annie and Oreo
I think Oreos in heat we're have a
schedule to get her neutered faded a
couple other dogs in the neighborhood
came here came in pulled my chain link
offense apart right here
she got in and they all escaped to that
then I covered that hole and a new dog
is around here and she just did this
this morning this whole look at this and
they all got out there and they all
escaped again
we got Annie back I have to go chase
Oreo down and there's that dog
making soup you guys been craving it
unless soup that my parents always made
lots of kid and so I'm going to attempt
it's never the same so engine cover
tomatoes carrots not your corn dog I
just had my girl beef in that's all
that's in here right now I'm gonna put a
tablespoon of garlic and then have some
of my chopped vegetables this is celery
and bell pepper I bought my onion arty
chop at this time because I've been so
sick and they're not baby carrots
I usually don't cut those up they're so
tiny this is how you make like the base
of this new that I'm that I'm making and
while we wait me and Abram are snacking

well two guys more on the dog drama
I fixed the fence with a clothes hanger
as you can see in some different spots
so when I'm going to go pick up Annie
the other day like I said Annie xscape
she got picked up I went and picked her
up when I went to go pick her up the got
there said he reset he received several
calls from people saying that we're
abusing our dogs I was just so thrown
off by that I don't understand why some
people think we're abusing our dogs one
person complaining about the way I use
the leash because she had lost her
collar so I could take her for a walk
and that's how the animal control handed
her back to us no joke they had a leash
tied around her neck not tied but where
it can move around just like I had it
and that's how they give back that's not
abuse and then somebody said we don't
let her in the house and he said he had
explained to several people that we
weren't doing anything wrong that the
dog looks perfectly healthy that we
weren't abusing the dog I'm just so
confused I guess it's just part of being
the public eye some people are very
sensitive about dogs and I totally
understand that but it's kind of
frustrating hearing that people saying
we abused our dollars I mean does this
look are going to be his dog we bathe
here we feed her very well yeah we don't
give her as much attention as you know
some people do their dogs but she
definitely gets attention definitely by
far way far from being abused but sheesh
guys give us a little break here we're
not professional dog owners but we
definitely don't abuse our dogs that's
for sure okay once the meat is brown you
put in a can of tomato sauce then you
feel it half way full draining
you know to get all the excess and then
I don't want to go by myself I don't
want to go by myself but I guess I will
