of the day and it goes to Caroline
Richie this vlog brought back so many
childhood memories for me between the
felt coloring posters and the trips with
my dad to Home Depot my heart I have to
agree
just watching Symphony around the house
today with her little felt posters and
seeing the kids going home depot with
Sam today it was just really sweet and
heartwarming it reminded me of trips to
the stores my dad and trips to Walmart
with my mom where I'd pick out a craft
and I did often take out felt coasters
so I can relate to you on that one and
we'll see you guys tomorrow don't forget
we love you and remember to love each
other
we can't make
No
we're in this together
