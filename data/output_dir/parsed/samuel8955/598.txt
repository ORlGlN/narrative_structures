in this together wow this looks amazing
today
what a big awesome difference
yesterday the water looked really dirty
because you couldn't see the bright
clear ones because once the went under
the water they did basically disappear
so today they're all revealed and the
Sun is all today the Sun was that oh
yeah
and now it's just incredible that's
where the blue ones all migrated through
this ah edges of the pool or the outside
of Paris
very interesting the dunes on the
outside
wow this is incredible that did
you know when I laugh you're told
yeah you through it and good luck
finding that Universe toy
a lot of people were asking yesterday
how do we plan on getting this cleaned
up and the answer is I don't know the
clean up is an afterthought for me I
feel like when I think about the cleanup
and the effort it's going to take
afterwards and that's like one thing
that debtor's me from doing a lot of fun
things for my kids and not just that but
for things for myself come on buddy
let's go see the trash man come on we're
about to go out to eat as a family this
is Michael's last night
I just got my motorized boat in the
middle I got it for the swimming pool

that really made my day I've been
craving to drive a boat on the water for
a long time a motorized boat and this
thing is perfect is less than 100 bucks
and it's really sensitive control really
fast when it capsizing you can flip it
back over and a bonus is that it's
strong enough to hold my GoPro that
makes a lot funner I could go back and I
get footage what I see all right let's
go get juice there's just still a little
boy right throughout the surface of who
I am and no matter how hard I try to
suppress him he keeps coming back and
lately it's been the former done crazy
things with my kids they're like a
mixture of Benjamin Button Total Recall
with that little boys living inside that
guy's stomach and big and it's just
something I'm I've struggled with all my
life and I think I always will because
