it was such a fun day gosh I just love
these spontaneous days like this it was
so so so awesome to call and Adam to
take us into their home very last minute
I mean we weren't sure what day we were
going to Disneyland until practically
like the day before we win so I told her
we're coming she was like oh you want to
stay I mean it was just all so
last-minute unplanned and just perfect
that was cool that he actually had
access to kayaks and I used something
that he'd really enjoy to do and that
was something I really wanted to do
while I was out here like I didn't have
to plan for anything here sight
hey Adam has some kayaks you guys want
to go
I just love Nicole to if she really
reminds me of like the community we have
back at home like their family they're
just very gospel-centered and we live in
their life for Jesus like we are it is
so awesome to be around those kinds of
people and their I don't know just
there's this really awesome so anyways
guys comment of the day goes to Amco
eight one four she said how do you deal
with Disney while pregnant Mia I'm just
laughing cuz since she said I want to
take my son for his second birthday but
I'll be almost nine months pregnant and
I have no idea what I'll even do there
so I'll just say it was really hard on
my body I'm just gonna be really honest
towards the end I felt like my body was
kind of like the lower half of my body
felt kind of what's that word numb I
would do it again I would go back again
and do it while I was this pregnant for
my children it was really awesome even
though I didn't get to ride many of the
rides I don't know I'm not a super big
roller coaster person anyways and I just
like to see everyone else having fun and
loving it Stephanie we got it had a
chance to talk a lot while walking
around with the kids and waiting in line
so I suggest that you do that with your
two-year-old son anyways guys we will
see you all tomorrow we're having our
meetup right now while you guys are
watching this we're meeting and shaking
hands that's right I'm so exciting so
we'll see you then we can't wait and
don't forget as always we love you and
remember to love each other
