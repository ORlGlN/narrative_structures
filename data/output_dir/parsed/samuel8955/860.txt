comments and messages from you guys
about our news from yesterday's vlog and
I'm just blown away by all the love and
support first of all thank you so much a
really good friend of ours that we've
known for a few years she reached out to
me a couple of months ago and told me
that she had had a miscarriage
and she's not someone that I talked to
like daily or weekly she's just someone
from our past week we do very well and
she said I don't know why but I feel
like I need to reach out to you right
now and tell you that I had a
miscarriage this week and that was
really it we didn't really talk about it
again which again I'm like such a dummy
I should have checked on her ashes and
all these things that I'm fired
realized I would have she messaged me
today and she was like I told you that
God God had me reach out to you two
months ago for a reason and I didn't a
lie and this could be why now now him
knowing that he would have needed me two
months later and that we would be
needing to go through this together
isn't that crazy
it was like 100 grand
I wanted to do it wait in a little bit
what about this alleged man
named Elizabeth this one's late
you
