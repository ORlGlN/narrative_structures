how're you guys doing today I'm at
Sandi's I'm about to drag her to the
nail salon with me I left my wallet at
the house so I'm gonna let say any vlog
about her pregnancy while I'm running
I'm supposed to have clear skin and I'm
obviously breaking out my fingernails
are supposed to be growing and they are
not um although I guess the I'm very
sensitive and emotional I know so I
guess that's on point um this is awkward
is it over yet okay I'm done
I finished it was great you are my sis
made by the same guy nobody say
No
well
in this together
this is the life so these are the cards
we were dealt or the cokes should I say
ready
mine says friend and San he says BFF
it's plate so Abram ran into my foot the
other day with his Walker I seriously
took off like half my toenail and the
lady starts rubbing it on my so these
are the colors I'm getting pale pink and
kind of a minty color I'll show you the
final result get some kind of design on
my big toe maybe where's your colors
needing this and gray and white I don't
have the grain
there's no music here
Ceyda have been playing the guess-who
game so we've been playing guess who's
pregnant I love that
Sam is no good at this game he's like
I'll just tell me I don't care
so it's always nice
Hasini we had to guess who's pregnant
today
can't say who it is because I don't even
think anyone else besides like close
family friends even really know yeah but
soon maybe you'll find out but it's not
me don't start assuming date it's a very
nautical channel too it is a girly
nautical feel I feel like we've been
gone forever go bad because Sam has a
photoshoot later and I thought I was
going to go kind of quick I thought I
would be able to just leave during
Abraham's nap and come home by the time
he woke up and that's not going to
happen because I'm not even done yet and
it's already 11:30 he better be awake if
Avery was not awakened it's 11:30 that
I'm gonna be like trying to get symphony
up we're gonna go to a water park today
it's not really a water park essentially
a spa a slash slide but they call it a
waterpark they have a slide there I
think they have kind of like a lazy
river that's what we'll be doing today
Sydney's always very cranky when she
wakes up in the morning you okay
she's a very quicky sleeper there she
takes it up to me it's kind of sad I
shouldn't give an excuse ISM and we are
off to the water
can't wait to catch some Sun I majorly
need a tan I think it's all indoors were
and the water partners it's a lot of / /
ball
it's all indoors yeah I'm a lot of like
theory about going I read some reviews
about an online
today I honestly did not read one good
reviews just kind of like oh sorry one
lady said that she had to take her son
to the bathroom she was there along with
her son and he was traumatized
supposedly the naked people are only
like in the bathroom / locker room area
so if you gotta go to the bathroom
you're gonna see my keys
I don't know anyways and then they said
the customer service was absolutely
horrible
like I read several at Sunday customer
service is just terrible here but
anyways it's gonna be fun no matter what
because we'll be with family will be
with each other it's really all that
matters yeah it is you're right that's
all it meant
going to be with each other so the vlog
is late today and I have my computer
here I've decided to do the vlog a
little bit differently last night
instead of sitting at my computer doing
it I decided to do it on my laptop in
bed just to mix it up a little bit you
know I uploaded the video for some
reason is exported in a different format
from the program that I was using so I
had to export all over again when I got
home today so I'm trying to rush to my
mom's house to get the vlog up with in a
timely manner today but it's going to go
