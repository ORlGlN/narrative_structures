good buddy what's uh look any Morgan
yeah even better with your mouth open
that was a lot of fun that's what we
decided to do instead of having Sunday
service because falls on Christmas
because Christmas falls on Sunday what
do you guys think of that should we'd be
having church on Sunday
are you guys having church still on
Sunday just curious what are you guys
doing on Sunday for Christmas here I'm
really curious what you guys are doing
but we had a really great sermon about
the love Jesus how he has set an example
so high and his compassion for others
his enemies as well as people who are
just completely unloveable leather
people and how we should be trying to
live up to that as a really great sermon
early spoke to me how we should be
loving people no matter what there's
never an excuse a good excuse not to
show your love to somebody because if
anybody had the best excuse it was Jesus
and he gave it all to love us everything
but um yeah do you want to do comment of
the day cassadee a I think jessica is
coming sorry
it was Nana not sorry but we loved
Jessica too hopefully just go come out
soon or we'll go out there I love
Jessica alright guys don't forget we
love you remember to love each other
