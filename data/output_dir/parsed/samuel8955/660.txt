guys welcome back to Sam Ania today I
started a new little thing my friend
told me I'm doing too much oil and one
day of the lemon she said not to worry
it's not a danger but that I need to
probably tone it down a little so I
pulled out my little glass jar or my big
one and I've got some real lemons a
little bit of lemon oil and that is my
lemon water now I got to say the taste
is not as good I'm so disappointed when
she texted me Oh like no it's really
been like a major craving of mine having
like that specific lemon flavor
the one from the oil and not a real
lemon in my iced water that's pretty
good limit water right there the carpet
guys are here see him right there I'm
gonna pick his nose Thanks oh I didn't
maybe pick a spot as an action
good morning princess
don't you look like a little doll look
at that hair look pretty in there look
like it does look like that robe but
it's not quite the rug are you guys
ready to hear including India to hear
what I saved by doing this myself
I saved $550 you say 550 yeah no bad
it's a good savings a bet that's it full
again okay she thought I was gonna say
we saved over a thousand he was charging
100 how's that even possible and the
positive side of do it myself
is I got to be perfection it and that is
a word I made up that is a word I made
up honey
that is not a word yes the word of the
day perfection and perfection it is
where you get so like focused on the
details and so into a job try to make it
perfect that that it almost becomes
intimate perfection it it's a mixture
perfect and intimate and that's what I
got to be doing it myself paying
attention that tiny details little
scripts I'll make sure everything's
covered somebody else doing it probably
wouldn't have done that good of a job
I don't think Savannah come here come
look at the cast the final product it's
really cool because it stands up on its
own look is that cool
it's like a little art piece I don't
think we should let the kids paint it I
really like it white and I think I'm
gonna like put some more paper on it and
fill in hey guys you like my cast uh-oh

moving stuff into the room and the only
place for it is the kiss craft area we
are running out of space but we're
making do

in there since the new carpet was put in
I don't think this is what fit the

in front of me hey if you guys are going

right honey good message that's the
Mother's Day message from salmony at
work with what you got I'm gonna take a
shower you guys have a good night and
lovely thank you thank you for all your
hard work I have a special message for
your mothers out there too
just kind of summing up what we said on
our girls day when we did our shampoo
hair washing party thing as mom you tend
to get lost in all the laundry and the
cooking and the cleaning and crafting or
diapers and potty training and all those
other things I mean there's so many
other things I didn't name just now that
we get caught up in and we lose
ourselves so often we can lose ourselves
so I just want to encourage you moms
that today remind yourself of something
that you value in yourself whether it's
something you're good at something
you've changed something that you have
improved on in yourself and your
personal life and if you're sitting
there and you're thinking I wish I could
come up with something because we were
all just kind of racking our brains that
night at the hair washing party then do
it just sit there until you think of
something and really hone in on that for
the day and anytime you're feeling like
you're at your wits in don't forget who
you are as a woman a mother a wife a
friend a sister a daughter cousin
whatever the case may be
and as always guys don't forget we love
you and remember to love each other have
you Mother's Day
