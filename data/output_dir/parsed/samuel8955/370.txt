kind of in a rush we are preparing for
something really really fun tomorrow in
Houston you guys are going to come back
to see what's going on
the first comment of the day comes from
Katie done it it warms my swim
instructor / lifeguard heart seeing you
take your baby swimming Thank You Katie
we try to expose them to underwater
swimming early we didn't do that with
symphony we regretted it because she was
terrified of water so we started a room
early he seemed to catch on and warm up
to water a little bit earlier than
Symphony did although he is still pretty
scared so with Juliet were probably
going to be even more hands-on with
getting her used to the water and going
underwater and just kind of not giving
her the auction to be scared or say no
anyways we'll see you guys tomorrow for
some more fun don't forget we love you
and remember to love each other
in this together
