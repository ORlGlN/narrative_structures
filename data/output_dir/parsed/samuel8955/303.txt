got to get to that statute that that
pole the flagpole the trashcan you guys
are going to get to the trash can't wait
everyone wait you guys sure that not
working out there like out whatever you
know winding down with our phones in our
face any calling today how's it coming
up on this forehead over here Oh what
adding bad anyway Khan today is a funny
one it comes from Paige Meyer why do we
always see me and driving fish Sam love
you guys it's not always okay watch the
vlog every day but everyone's well
she'll Drive if I need to do some work
I'll do it in the car cos we don't live
very close to anything all the faces of
go to takes quite a bit of driving and
now that's a good time for me too
sometimes editing the vlog and so like
that but for the most part I Drive yeah
that's why I thought was funny to see
everywhere it was absolutely magic but
did you die to do die
what did you die hilarious so today guys
we got to help bones show with their
adoption fundraiser garage son it was
really cool because this last week we
didn't do our GC meeting which is where
we normally meet and we eat food and we
talk and we pray and sometimes do a
study or whatever but it was cold this
time she seems different
okay you serve on Thursday during a sale
a couple of people from our group came
and on Friday some other people from our
church came and today we came that's the
benefit of being a community
when you decided to do something like
this you have all these people around
you to help you like if we ever decide
to do something like that we would have
verbal community you know like moving or
anything it's just so great for just to
have a community that you can lean on
when you're doing so like you know I
have no joy I'm very happy that Bo and
show were the first people to utilize my
truck because they've done so much for
us something so simple but it's still
really cool enough that they have to be
the first to use it so so you guys don't
don't get I matter I'll be the hairnet
you get home when you can't make it on
your own I promise you and not alone
puttin this together
Bob - eh it is
yes cheating destiny
