what a dinner
I wonder for dinner everyone I love that
guy
yeah you're shaking I bet you one thing
though in my room taking
baby corn dog for baby sister doing it
part hoodie
you ain't even awake yeah you'll be in
bed date night is over today what was
your favorite part about date I don't
have one I like you know it was all
pretty amazing I agree okay you guys so
Sam and Symphony are still on their date
they have been gone now for about four
hours they left it for it's almost 8:15
and so yeah the two little window and
then I'm going to do comment of the day
Sam and Symphony may do their own
comment of the day but here's my take on
it and it comes from Alexis Cochran she
had one of the most active comments at
this hour anyways eight o'clock
I don't usually choose a negative
comment but have a good reason so from
your point of view Alexis it looks kind
of like symphony bullied him but now you
are writing words that are bullying
toward Symphony and so I told you as
comment of the day because I just want
to say especially younger kids who might
be watching teenagers you know preteens
that might be watching just because you
see someone doing something wrong does
not mean that you should go do something
wrong to them you should show them love
you should show them kindness and joy
and if they have a problem showing
kindness and love to other people then
maybe you will spark to that inside of
them or inspire them to start living
that way now we all know Symphony is a
total sweetheart and she is not a bully
to her brother at all she's also not
hateful so yeah that's my two cents I
just want to encourage you guys to love
each other you guys know that's our
motto love each other there's no need to
tear someone down because they tore
someone else down we need to just
inspire kindness and joy and love and
into each other's lives so yeah that's
my comment of the day I'll see you guys
tomorrow don't forget we love you and
remember to love each other
Oh
and Lester
but in this together
