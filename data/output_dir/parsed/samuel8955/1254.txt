I love you I am off for some very late
but still appreciated mother's day
pampering the weekend of Mother's Day
was very busy and I have a mom and Sam
has a mom so of course we celebrate them
too
and so Sam was telling me for Mother's
Day you get to go get your hair done and
get a pedicure and get your nails done
I'm not like really big on getting my
hair done but since he offered it I was
like okay I'm gonna go and get some like
if you guys ever seen my blonde poking
through I like to have pink abou
highlights in my hair and I haven't had
those touched up and over a year but you
can't tell that they've grown out
because they're underneath and right now
I'm just the kids are napping and Sam is
skateboarding he said he's having a
creative block and so he went outside to
do some skateboarding and I just get
some energy out and think and so I'm
gonna go and get my nails done and I've
been debating on a color or if I should
get like a design put on it and I'm
thinking that what I want to do is get
like coral and maybe navy blue so this
is how the construction of the Shelf is
going to go it says get four of these
they're like screw mounts and put them
in board II okay board II so what does
that say there is only one board e or
two e
and says take board e get for these
these mounts and put them in the corners
and the holes that are in the corners of
board e board e where are the holes in
the corner board e wait a minute that's
on the other side oh there they are
never mind so I'm done with the shelf
and Nia bought the shelf to fit these
cubby squares and these cubby squares
don't fit the shelf I don't I guess you
didn't look at the measurements before
you but both of these so here's the
shelf and the cubbies are huge they
don't
inside I mean I guess we could set him
on top that's what we'll do we'll use
this shelf as a stand for the cubby
cubes but I'm done with that and I hear
