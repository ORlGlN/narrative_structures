all right so it's that time of the week
again Symphony and I are going exploring
and it's worth of July obviously and I
was trying to do something fitting for
4th of July I asked you guys your ideas
on where I should take her some of you
suggested a memorial one person forgot
your name sorry
Carolyn something like that suggested I
take her to explore the Stars that was a
good idea I think I'll do that another
day though so instead I think I want to
take her to a graveyard this is a
graveyard
this is really barium after they die
and why
everybody's running
yes
dad says juice underground no he doesn't
live underground but that's where we go
until he comes back
oh okay see like this look at this
tombstone take it this one so this is
really strange teaching her about death
she's got some interesting questions I
hope I'm not doing her disservice by
teaching her about death so early she
seems interested though so what are your
thoughts on that guys I teaching her too
early steno is so weird
before we left here I said simply we're
gonna go explore a graveyard she said a
graveyard can we pick some and she's
adamant that she's gonna see grapes and
guess what she just found grapes let me
taste it yeah I think those are grapes
yep those are grapes oh go ahead loose
our grapes at the graveyard mm-hmm
