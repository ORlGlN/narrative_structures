yours and I just won with the color
belly so cute hi guys
Mia and I are standing here debating on
how do you satisfy your children who
want a snack away how do you do
that right there you feed them very
healthy snacks like peanut butter I did
some research yesterday because I felt
like the kids were just constantly
wanting to chat and I found that giving
them snap full of proteins um really
helps to satisfy them longer than just
whatever you have it should be something
also children want to eat more when
they're actually thirsty so giving them
a big drink of water or you know water
with your juice with a lot of water can
really help satisfy them
so yeah the Raider family tip of the day
for all you young ladies out there with
no children heck is this what the heck
is going on down here
what the heck oh he wanted more pina
babo what bubble mmm you got the bubble
it's peanut butter you stealing see is
he think he's trying to say butter like
caramel okay I don't worry I said butter
eat it eat it
hmm no it's so good you want another bar
no the blown the food thank you guys
he's such a ham we were doing this like
together go me
mmm look perfectly aligned and he goes
amia
and that's how he says caramel like he
knew they even looked at me and said
yeah Mia I said oh you with the camera
okay we'll get the camera and film it
pretty hard I'll get you one look at ya
you are little ham watch daddy how
particularly what kind of a practice is
gonna have on Abram I'm curious he's
gonna be growing up his whole lot out of
a mousehole life but for years to come
a bus with a camera is face I'm curious
what kind of effect that has on a child
long-term effects
what do you guys think do you guys think
you'll end up narcissistic I guess of
course we can you know make sure that
doesn't happen in various ways but we
think narcissist

to perform in front of people in order
