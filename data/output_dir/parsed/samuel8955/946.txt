since she added a couple extra she did
yeah April just woke up from his nap
mommy and Symphony are out getting their
nails done so Abram and I are hanging
out here I'm folding laundry I don't
remember the last time I folded laundry
it's been a long time I I just hate
laundry I have so much trouble bringing
my mind to doing laundry I feel like
there's no into it and I think it's it
overwhelms me I don't know I think it's
part of the nature of men which it's
just really hard for us to get our mind
around doing laundry
that's one of the benefits of you know
working full-time and allowing me to
stay home with the kids she can do the
laundry and I don't have to
ah
ah it's a beautiful day in the
neighborhood
Loulou
Wow big mom is definitely tested your
multitasking abilities right now I'm
trying to entertain the kids keep them
entertained by playing with them I'm
also trying to do a thumbnail for the
Mother's Day vlog Mother's Day special
and I'm doing laundry at the same time
and now I have to plan for dinner where
in the world am I gonna find time time
for dinner I have no idea what I'm gonna
make her dinner
oh no idea I mean oh it's in the freezer
she's in the freezer yeah we got some
burritos what we're gonna have for
dinner that's a great idea have fun yeah
so I guess we decided what we're going
to do we're just going to have a
breakfast for dinner love to talk to me
about it right after my tummy it gets
home we have to talk to mommy about it I
mean daddy I mean Mia I mean okay these
roles are you confusing why my dad's
like this this is getting really weird
Abram wanna watch wheels on bus so we
instead decided come outside and draw
our own school bus and symphonies
coloring it in can you help sissy color
it so another appreciation that I have
gained through this being mommy for a
day thing is I've realized how hard it
is to vlog and do all these house chores
and you know people the kids keep them
entertained it's difficult
all right you ready here we go Abram
don't go to sleep don't go to sleep that
out don't go to sleep okay wake up
please don't go to sleep in the grass
Abram no please don't go to sleep in the
grass don't go to sleep in the grass
Abraham oh don't go to sleep in the
ground I said oh well guys I didn't
recognize me when she came out the car

gonna get it died I didn't really know
