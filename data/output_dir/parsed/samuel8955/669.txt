there because we have them in Dallas but
I gotta say the pizza was really good
you know we're travelling we should eat
somewhere traveling but anyways we're
gonna go ahead and do comment of the day
and tell you guys good night until
tomorrow
Sara air is mook I hope I said that
right
wants to know Sam Ania what has been
your highest point in your lowest point
so my high point was the museum
yesterday welcomes mom I just walking
around the city I just love it he was a
noun to me it's like that little being
goofy I was like honey in New York City
you can be anybody on the streets and
nobody cares because there's so many
various kinds of characters here people
just you know just yeah and he's like
good going up to incoming people who
like that's his own language and
whatever he's been so embarrassing a son
of like language oh the iPod cousin
about but nothing drama but I know what
you're doing how is your low point
definitely like restroom breaks in a
place like New York City like you got to
find a public restroom and get your
stroller into now that's been kind of we
need a vent like a portable restroom for
kids we just pop open a tent over your
whole stroller hey that's a good idea to
change him in there
and just fold it all up nothing like
this and have a little party I don't
know what though that's pushing it
that's just it's just change it to that
procedure or changes that you need yeah
my little point probably was riding that
uber oh yeah here they go uber a car he
took us way out of the way end up
charging us almost 40 bucks to get to
less than two miles away
it's the idea be kidding me that I
mapped it myself when he's driving me I
was like why are we going this way we
could win right stricter here he's like
Oh trust me I know the traffic is worse
over there and my map tells me what the
traffic looks like everywhere and it was
the exact same on that road as it was
the world
second there's not a point but we'll see
you guys about wait the subway alright
guys we'll see you tomorrow we don't
have any plans as usual but I want to
see the Statue of Liberty and around the
ferry coming to talk to this everybody
yet well gonna die okay
we'll see you guys tomorrow don't forget
we love you and remember to love each
other
we shout
