one says big sister is the end of the
day I have got some laundry like mounds
of laundry there woman and I'm nursing
little doing it to sleep hopefully and I
thought I would do comment of the day
with her and it comes from Wendell
monster he says Juliet is so good does
she ever cry and thought that that was
fitting for tonight because we actually
just had a really sweet moment Juliet
got really mad like kind of like a
little miniature newborn temper tantrum
and it was so sweet Sam got her and held
her really tight because she wasn't
wanting to nurse or anything with me and
held her really tight rocked her and
bounced her for like a while like 10
minutes
long time to rock and bounce you got her
all quiet and still and she fell asleep
that it was just such a sweet moment and
she slept for maybe 25 minutes and then
she woke up and she was crying again so
yes she does cry as do all babies but
she has been such a good and sweet baby
and we're so blessed she makes adding a
third child to the mix really easy and
we feel like I don't know what were we
afraid of before so anyways don't forget
guys we love you and remember to love
each other
we're in this together
