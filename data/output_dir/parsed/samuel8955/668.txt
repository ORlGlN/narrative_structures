right there as a broken panel apps
where's those left right I guess listen
Hershey building you have to stand by on
that I don't know what to tell you
I've seen what happens Marcus downstairs

deterioration there it is I think that's
one piece and that's the other Oh Caleb

love you love symphony do you see the
Mickey Mouse sign yet
we're headed back to Disney before we go
to the
Statue of Liberty because I want to get
the kids such arts to around the ferry
we didn't catch any sweatshirts or coats
or anything and I think this is the
closest place to get them one cheaper
and better for what they're doing but
why not just scourge something that's
totally totally related to what we're
doing and you know the character they
like
I've reached my destination vlogging and
pushing that stroller is not easy let me
say let me just tell you I gotta get Sam
some props he does it sometimes so
something like this for Abraham making
point for Symphony I left my sweater in
the hotel room I'm lying on my phone
right now
Nia went down to the Disney Store to get
the kids a jacket before he had his
Statue of Liberty it just happened to
stop at the fifth floor on my way down
to the lobby and there was an office
door open I was like hmm I'm in Lincoln
here and then there's another door open
that door right there and I came over
here look out the window it says where
my GoPro fell to our Bell and then guess
what else
there's a little window right here gotta
go get it
I think this is it
Oh
nope it's not a
that's it right there that floor okay
we're upstairs now they didn't have any
Statue of Liberty ones for Abram sighs
so I'm showing him this Captain America
one and I was gonna give him the option
of this one or many or Mickey Mouse

overwhelmed by the the people here
I was so extremely nice The New Yorker
values guys is a real thing herb is so
blessed by people here pretty awesome
you
yeah
what kind of metal wasn't made out of
what color was it before it turned green
brown and why did turn green
because whenever it gets wet through
this ocean if it gets greener and
greener
I said fire on it the second look at a
guy it's beautiful isn't it everywhere

he is nervous of me putting the camera
over the edge she said I don't have a
good record with cameras and I said to

camera every single day and takes risks
with their cameras like I do

bit too late we are here at Staten
Island Park and everything is closed or
about to be we wanted to take the kids
to the museum a Children's Museum here

there's so much to do here
you know these games you know that step
outside
we had a good time at the Children's
Museum now we're just out here in the
middle of nowhere it seems waiting for
bus at a place where we're not supposed
to stand yeah this is really weird guys

no standing and there's not even a bench

doing really good and I'm going to be
commented a and we're going to enjoy our
meal here in Times Square
before we head back to the hotel Aaron
delay wants to know how is potty
training going with Abram on the trip
basically zilch it's pretty much just
not happening at all he hasn't gone one
we'll have a place
yeah it's we didn't bring like a
portable potty seat to go on top of our
hotel toilet and so that's made a big
difference anyways guys don't forget we
love you and remember to love each other
check it out guys
there she is what a great security staff
they have I found your camera on the
roof I hope you can repair have a nice
day
this is busted my GoPro huh the battery
pack is inoperable obviously but the one
thing I wanted back the most my SD card
is still intact yes still intact
so hopefully I got a good time ups out
of all that I know the down does nothing
still can see the world when it spinning
spinning compensating for which I could
fly like an airplane
won't be breaking easily now
I could make it even around
