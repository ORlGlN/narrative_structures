my truck which is right there just died
we literally forgot all the fittings
that's why I recorded all because I knew
you wouldn't believe me
we have no receipt the blower fan basic
today Andrew and I are trying to get
some access to the water meter here that
I hadn't sold sure so we got water for
the trailer for now we have to get a
machine at digging this is just way too
hard oh we're gonna make a little faucet
right here Andrew and eyes first time
doing this kind of plumbing so we're
running as we go
hey buddy sucka Oh fun man I'll miss you
I'm sorry I'm sorry I upset you we
literally forgot all the fittings for
the plumbing right here we got all the
tools that we need to let the bag on the
counter so he's gonna go grab those
hopefully there's still a distillery all
right guys so we got a little trench dug
Christie's first gain access to your
meter here like you an 8 day have done
right here we don't know what size that
is so we got 3/4 inch fittings and then
we got a 3/4 inch to 1 inch just in case
or one in two three four let's see what
we got right here so we have this
fitting to fit on that meter here this
is a push-to-connect fitting we're gonna
use on PEX tubing it's a male doctor so
let's see if this it's a 1 3 4 so okay
let's see here dude like I said record
the pecs to V this was popular in Europe
in the 60s and we're just not catching
on to it that it's better than copper
and better to the PVC for water so here
to see how these work guys a little vise
grip do you know
andrew figures out how to do the tape i
want to show you guys what we got here
this right here is an adapter we're
using sharkbite products this is a
female adapter to go I don't know so we
bought a tee as well because we're gonna
go up out of the ground right here and
create a water faucet a drain we brought
this is a boiler drain what this is
worth congratulations Sam you are the
best plumber of all time I know you are
today is the first of our 2017 family
Thanksgiving and I think I'm gonna bring
we're gonna make turkeys out of our
hands and give them to bebo today
uni gets little smaller ones and you

guys probably wouldn't believe it if I
told you but Andrew and I just did all
that that's why I recorded all cuz I
knew you wouldn't believe me
we gotta floss it there and we use the
hose to access the trailer line so this
is a very exciting moment for Andrew and
I there it is right there

tastes like a rubber hose we just gotta
wait for that taste to go away
this is the Rue manger now going next
this is the utility route water heaters
are here the heating that's right there
how about search this wall will be
stretched out with the front all the way
to the end of that porch
make it nice big space laundry so
definitely want to keep the shelves like
brand-new you can even see the box I

le time is over and I am getting ready
to cook my mom suggested me bringing a
meatloaf I know that's not super
Thanksgiving ish but I'm going to heed
her advice and I'm gonna make a meatloaf

load it's a loaded but before we go I
turn the tree on cuz it'll be dark when
we get back so this is what the room is
looking like so far we got all the
paneling off this wall right here though

is actually a load-bearing wall how are
we gonna leave it Andrew that's holding
up the ceiling yeah just don't hit the
other one alright don't hit the other
one out woah my balls man
I mean the ceiling is coming down on us
okay I guess that's not a load-bearing
wall at all there you go
that's how your job but really that's
how you not take out an outlet okay now
I was just showing you guys why not -
it's exactly what enough to do we have
water there you are you got it
let me make you a little wider though I
thought we're keeping that we were we
