don't know if you guys could tell but
the photo shoot pictures that we shared
with you guys a couple days ago that's
the book she was reading in the shots of
her laying down reading um we I took
that one because it's currently her
favorite book at 4 years old she has a
new favorite book and I think it's so
adorable anyways the concept of that
book is we're going on this huge task
we're gonna go find a bear which is like
huge and scary and a long way where you
have all these things pop up tall grass
thick mud and basically the book is
saying we can't go over it we can't go
under it we have to go through it and I
love that it's instilling in her mind
that when a problem arises you can't you
can't avoid it you have to just forge
through that work through the problem

out of some pool tonight

I got really hungry it's like two
o'clock in the afternoon so I ordered
some dominoes we're gonna check out the
gym Oh woman what a nice little gym
Abram wants to go and walk on the
treadmill
good job working out in style Oh
all right I know this is gonna sound
really silly but just like holding this
weight in my hand and working out a
little bit feeling the different muscles
in my upper body like tinting it makes
me want to go work out at a gym I should
probably go a little more often I
planned on starting to work out at a gym
when Abram was about six months old and
now he's 10 months old and I've still
not got a gym membership what you lift
in there bud can you do some squats
Abraham's working on his chunky arms hi

swimming poke and now we're not in
Washington Cooper and aware what I'm and
we're gonna look what's down here
symphonie found yep this is where you
can come to laundry yesterday when we
were driving to the rehearsal dinner we
saw this on our way out and symphony was
like I want to see that look at the lily
pads in the middle well I just got word
that Sam's going to be able to come and
pick us up for the wedding and we only
have one car and there were some friends
here that offered to pick us up and take
us but I have no car seats for them so
we're kind of like stuck in the hotel
for another like I don't know five hours
well I mean we're stuck in the hotel for
the rest of the night but you know like
the kids will eventually go to bed and
then I can you know go to sleep too or
whatever like we're kind of not ready
now how far away are you guys
there she can
look at this handsome baby Abram never
dresses up
he's like the typical boy he's act only
dressed up when you have to so here is
the story of what happened how I ended
up at the wedding
Sam was like you guys are not coming
you're not coming I can't make it to get
you it's just not gonna work out so
Abram was asleep and when he woke up a
gotta make it he was in his diapers and
he was in her play clothes for the day
and I was in my like just Sun dress for
today I'm coming I'm coming
she didn't have and so then hey over
here text me and she's like hey we're on
our way which means we're like right
down the road and so like sheep no one's
dressed but that's how I ended up
playing my casual dress I had children
at a wedding outfit he wants you to go
cut like oh oh my hair it wasn't
headlining in food
I don't think I should do it
I believe he'll continue from is with
you right now it's so cute
