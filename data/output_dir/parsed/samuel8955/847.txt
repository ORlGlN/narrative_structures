hey guys we're here the car with Davey
and April and he's back there what
oh I'm editing with lawyer yet last
minute and it man I've been horrible
just at the end of these days I've just
been exhausted and that's like one
reason why we posted at 5:00 by the way
because I'm horrible like getting it
done the night before so I give us that
wasn't for you guys man basic for you
guys that's right babies right I love
using my fan basic so yeah we're off to
our first day at vlogger fair we're
excited today is just registration kind
of meet-and-greet with the fellow
vloggers and then there's something
going on tonight I'm really not sure
what to expect but
we'll see you guys will see guys I need
you to be honest with me right now okay
I need your honest opinion we're about
to show up to vlogger fair and I feel
like I look a little bit too touristy I
got a backpack my SLR travel around with
this guy the middle
goodnight oh I see the needle the needle
just the needle the needle I told you
you put it in the toilet I don't even
know it is sweat yeah that's because
that computer so hot okay guys I think
we're getting warmer but this is a cool
place I think we're gonna come play here
later it's weird it's Seattle a fuse
like there's an echo wherever I go no
seriously we're lost me and I've been
lost this whole trip and without Davey
and April could fix that for us but in
fact they actually made it work soon
seven dia we're gonna know way more than
they know I there does guys we found it
I found it all by myself
oh it was behind me
there's actually all Randy where to go
inside already
what do you got there babe would you do
me the honor of lighting me a badge
there it is guys our first vlog affair
thing I think those are some things
trying to stay young jeezy protection we
don't do chicken because the chicken
don't we say you do it go
let's do the check before Kelly but
would you know long before good steak
okay we know they value each other just
be yeah yeah okay so is this complicated
yeah Nia is cooking right now opening
sauce on rice we have rice we have
different sauces yeah yeah we have this
little peace sign in the middle
it's a chose that baby looks like Union
did you not watch this anyways guys I
like yes baby I need it done I kind of
get in that in or if you want some
people like set on separate chopsticks
other people cuz it is boiling so close
I think I got something ready to meet
slower because only 20 seconds to cook
oh did you get that I don't know how
many times I've read it oh okay so this
is how it works guys I've figured it out
you have your meat your uncooked meat
here you dip it in other side of this
these are different flavors so if you
don't cook it over here you just cook it
over there takes only 20 seconds then
you dip it in one of these flavors you
got this arm I think this is kind of a
soy sauce and this one is kind of a
spicy sauce and then you put it on top
of your rice you grab vegetables and
place them on top of the rice and you
just kind of combine them all eat them
all
so that's how this works that fine
figured out because I listen for a
minute
look at this jello creme brulee check it
up what I want to go ahead such I want
to touch it to I'm breaking it
that's like caramelize sugar right
unless you're simply sugar on top and we
melt it with the creme brulee torch I
want to smell
