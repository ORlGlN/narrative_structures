we're back at the Crockers again there's
their house and we are gonna go run some
errands I'm having one of those days I
did not feel like leaving the house but
the longer we stayed in the house the
more messes the kids are making and I
was just getting fed up so I was like
whatever we're just gonna get out of the
house it's still kind of blah outside of
rainy so I thought about taking them to
the part and I thought no I'll just go
run some errands so we're here to get
sandy we're gonna go run the errands and
then I think we're just gonna come back
and do our naptime I think mommy's gonna
do naptime
you are my sister
by the same guy love butter stay
to give
in this together
you
you
you
you
well it's raining now
and my gun just got clogged so perfect
timing I guess
yes
but I'm gonna kick the burden Wow
good morning hey broom huh I hear
somebody else she she that was she huh
you okay there's a larger bitch yeah
good morning Symphony very good yeah
Tiffany and I are out you're painting
the house we're painting the white now I
decided to go ahead and just show you
guys the paint job today because we're
outside so often there's no way we're
gonna be able to keep the secret oh
that's finished the things gonna be a
couple weeks there's a white painting
it's very tedious and it's gonna take me
a while I gotta cut all the trim for
different areas of the house it's gonna
it's gonna take a while so yeah there it
is you guys saw the time-lapse no no it
looks pretty similar to the original
color it's fun and that we end up
blowing with the color that looks pretty
similar there she is
it's kind of purplish on the camera for
some reason it looks so much bluer in
person if you want to take a picture of
it picking up a color that my eyes
aren't picking up I guess or not picking
up the color up my house or figure out
sitting these getting these all creamed
up done a great job since me
and yeah so this is pretty tedious work
especially around the brick over here I
can't really tape this off it's kind of
hard to see where to stop where this
trim meets the wall it's not like a
definite line it's definitely not a
straight line all the way down so as you
can see this kind of take a while but
that's the color were using it looks
pretty good it's gonna look really nice
when we're all done that's for sure
what's it fee sure and look at this
tragedy that is going on with my columns
here I made them really tight when I
fitted it all together and the wood has
expanded
I guess stuff four by four of a center
has expanded and pulled apart some of my
trim go back through it put some wood
filler look at this look at that yeah
such a big gap I mean just massive look
at this I glued and nail these together
and they're still being torn apart
look gaps just like everywhere on the
top and bottom parts
the Capitals up there though they look
fine so that's good I think all the
moisture that's been in the air made
these expand a lot because we haven't
had any moisture in Texas this much
moisture in Texas in a very long time so
even the wood at Home Depot was just
like very dry I should have I don't I
guess I should have considered that one
building these oh well life goes on
Abram can't come out here because he's
making such a mess you got paint that
man paint all over the concrete all this
concrete is going to be stained somewhat
too worried about the paint do you like
the house or is it too blue you know
that's fine that fine what you think
what your cream gonna be now
it's gonna be like a cream creamy white
like real the same as the clothes a post
cuz I close the post I work out of work
come on it's gonna be all right just all
right you know why my eyes keep seeing
purple all right cool it's gonna be
different he says honey
he's just using those terms like my dad
uses like I think it's gonna be all
right yeah it's gonna be all right we're
gonna look like I'm so excited to get in
the car buggies here at Lowe's up on
that little squirt come on
see we're gonna go in there with that
little clip in his hair come on yeah
he's a monkey a little koala bear
sissy's gonna strap your shoes
we pretty much came to load for the car
yeah you can't have both Styria knows
mr. this little sissies not only let you
drive
oh that thing's heavy
but came to Lowe's today instead of Home
Depot because they carry something here
that some people don't have which is
this stuff right here
it has tape and paper or wrong and you
get the gun with it
come on housing works but basically tape
on paper covers and protects in one easy
step the only problem is is that this is
plastic I'm using this for outdoors and
if it's windy at all this stuff will
just flap all over the place and they
don't have it in paper where you can
like stick the paper up little all with
the gun so I'm not gonna buy it just
enough to do it all manually I've got a
huge job ahead and me taking off that
whole house I know what that means
I'll help him out
stiffly thing lots of these is a tough
job
