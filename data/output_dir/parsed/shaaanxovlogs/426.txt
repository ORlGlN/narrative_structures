I'm just getting ready to go get my
nails done because I haven't hit my
dad's in the ages they're just terrible
I'm so lazy finally doing it because
I've got a car now so I can actually go
out and get stuff done at the moment I'm
just Miss Jane fabulous is present so
yeah I'm gonna show too much because
I'll probably get this up by the time
she's received it hopefully but if not I
might be a few days out and I don't want
to ruin her surprise so I've got a roll
wrapped up completely terrible at
wrapping on the state of it to make up
for the day I changed my scarf this
one's from came out I think and this top
here I got off indeed sale it's just
like a chiffon makes it can top well got
the back hey birdy was it was it you
batted me don't buy me and then I'm
wearing these shots from valley girl
that I got like a year or two years ago
and then these little pony here well not
real pony here but imitation pony here
boots that I got from wild pair there
are only 50 bucks and my Michael Kors
god watch and I don't think I'm going
airings no no earrings it's actually
such a nice day so stoked
with you I feel so weightless

let's tree
and they go

I'm back at the supermarket I'm getting
some ginger and some celery and what
else was I meant to get but lady it was
like my what a healthy bag you have when
she picked that for me we got some
spring onions beetroot ginger coriander
and celery sorts of greens and yes and
stuff let's put some juicing and stuff
yeah I'm gonna go home
wait no I need to go at the post office
first and then want to go home and then
I'm going to make juice I just fully hit
it driving final moment it is like one
eats it at the post office and I would
think they were wrong right so i jus
like reversed into a cop hat because it
wasn't enough room to turn her out
first like every room is into a car park
and she did it perfect so that was good
but it was embarrassed the goddamn post
cost me like eighty dollars to see that
to the USA like two three kilo package
and I was just like yeah I haven't got
any of that in there
honestly the worst I'm so scared they're
gonna open it up through customs and
like some tiny Catholic out they
may actually see to it so I'm like
praying right now it's like please just
go safe and sound right through customs
like no questions asked
just just yet just please oh my god I'm
so scared and I'll feel so bad but I'm
pretty sure she'll have to do the same
things I'm sure you can't you can't
steam perfumes New Zealand either sirs
hey baby
excited to see me hey what about that
what have I got bitches okay here green
smoothie so I've got a few dollars
celery kale ginger and just an orange
and mostly what's it taste like Hamish
is gonna give me so much right now
under it look what I did
oh my god juicing fail okay this
concoction so fat tastes absolutely
revolting I think it's the ginger can
not do ginger oh my god it's so bad I'm
gonna add like another orange in here or
an F or something to try and counter it
to the taste oh my god that's so bad
I'm cooking up some some pasta we've got
some mushrooms and onions in here and
then some spit good because I just
really feel like cops right now don't
ask me why I just really do so what this
is is an edgy mix it's just like a
carbonara mix and then I just put in
lots of cool almond milk added a little
bit of chicken breast and white chia
seeds I do a tablespoon a day of chia
seeds and honestly it looks like a ton
but you can't really taste them that
much this was inspired by my best friend
you know Kelly you've been watching me
for ages you know Kelly she's my best
friend Sheila's back and part me though
so we don't see each other much but she
started Oh
music she started a Cooking Channel and
this is what inspired my meal whoo
fettuccine I'll put her link down below
its delicioso
we can take you
understood a video it is it a video I'm
gonna uploaded it yet but it's first to
his skin using cream products and it's
only 3 minutes and 12 seconds long so
it's just a really short video and I
just spit it up and showed you how I
achieved like my Joey skin kind of
routine using mostly cream products I
like liquid zinc creams not much powder
I use like one eyeshadow and a little
bit of bronzer I think that was about it
so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this one
when it comes out that took me like half
now to get it down and it's only three
minutes long so there's a bit crazy
anyway
by the way guys this is my new favorite
face mask and I don't know if I showed
it to you but yeah this is my favorite
face mask and I want to do a light
review tutorial thing on it on my main
channel Eric and I did buy this myself
by the way
but yeah it's just a real cool it's real
gross because it pulls out like all of
the crap out of your pores and uses a
spot treatment as well but yeah I'm
pretty keen to do that at some point I
just need to wait a few days for my face
to get really yuck so that you guys can
get the full effect
killing me

would you go shoot everything to me
don't let there be a distance between us
because this is so beautiful
Hamish takes me like I like your nails
cuz he saw my picture on Instagram

taking the camera with me because you're
not allowed to film people with the joke
