hey guys so shitty news I lost my camera
I think I put it down somewhere and
someone took it
so I'm vlogging on my like photo camera
this is the Sonia a5 100 or whatever
it's called hopefully is okay I know
it's not as good quality people would
say that because I started using this
for a while and people liked the other
one better but go on
at least travel insurance will come in
handy for once but anyway we're in your
resort now you wouldn't have seen me
like this all the way to start logging
it really lost the camera I lost all my
footage which is such a bummer this is
what's the split source last means so YT
pointing from the desert boating village
and today we're going off to explore
around boo-booed and look at the rice
field hopefully go see some monkey so
I'm gonna blog and yeah I've got some
drone footage at least and some GoPro
footage of some random stuff before I
lost my camera because yes I lost quite
a bit of footage but so is life this
place is probably one of my favourite
places I've been so far it's just very
relaxing like this area
Ubud or whatever its called it's so like
calm and just great like it's not right

rice fields around I'll show you the
little villa

pool and it's amazing the items find a
place to be super relaxing so

then when housekeeping came in they
wrote us and they were like I'm sorry we
couldn't make a bed like because we had
all of our expensive like you know drone
and cameras and all sorts of stuff
though we didn't want to touch it
so our rooms like such a mess we're not
tidy on holiday you know me I'm not tidy
belly about that we have like a little
outdoor kitchen so this whole area is
outdoor some Claire's artwork as well
and then we have a huge table and then
as you can see it just opens to your
outside and over here we have an outdoor
shower so cool own private pool which
usually looks a lot better it's just
filling up at the moment and it's got
like jets and stuff I should have shown
used today when it was really pretty and
then rice fields out the back and that
sculpture there puts water into the pool
too and then we have like the deck and
then nice little chair table and this
usually has the pillows on the house and
then we have the table over here with
the ate a pizza last night and like a
bit of like plants Bush whatever you
want to call it
so frogs in there and then our room so
stay sincere in there and then me and
Peggy turn this one and it's just got a
huge beard you could fit like four of us
on there and then yeah just all that
stuff in the bathrooms in there but
