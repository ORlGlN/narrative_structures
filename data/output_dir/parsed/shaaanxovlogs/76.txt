of boring I just constantly forget to
vlog because I'm like also snapchatting
and I keep forgetting to do both at once

secret projects for work until today
today's our first proper like holiday
day we were not doing any extra video
work so hopefully we vlogs will get a
little bit better now but yeah Hamish is
also blogging out here like he's so much
more on top of it I guess because he
doesn't snapchat and then we're going to
go walk towards the water now and just
walk across so pretty I love this
silhouette
I love the buildings or the color
