good morning I'm hungover today so
today's vlog is probably gonna be very
boring but it might be filled with
exciting food I don't know
last night was intense but it was pretty
fun we'll hit a good time went out
dancing and stuff so we're on a family
trying to play God I mentioned John the
frontman me and Amy the bass is wrapped
up in a blanket and way out off to
Ocampo to get some pasta cuz posture is
always a good idea when you're honnestly
though okay it's so amazing I'm totally
gonna eat some garlic so happy right now
would you go for lasagna lasagna looks
really good someone's jealous proceed
stop being greedy look at him he's like
pie person his food this is my pasta I
got the henna so good
how do we get this picture as well and
as you can see it's kind of
weird-looking
it's like folded in half this is hotter
like how amazing is this it's like a
pizza burger so good it is 342 and I'm
on beating at Korea doing some shopping
because I feel like it and Hamish and
John are playing you yeah
in John us very well
he's losing every game online yeah he's
playing people online and they're just
absolutely threshing out so that's fun I
used to love watching you you as a kid
it was one of my favorite cartoons
economist go watch it and spongebob in
Pokemon and digit mom was on in between
I hated Digimon today's vlog is probably
very boring because I literally just
died
yep so I've decided I'm gonna try out
this Manuka dr. purifying facial peel
for skin imperfections one that I showed
I think I was on Friday or Saturday's
block I'm just so confused
I'm gonna be dr. API clear so let's go
buddy go
oh that's very thick oh my gosh it's so
thick it can be did what I thought it
would be for some reason by henna
hopefully it's enough space between my
eyebrows I kind of screwed up but Flay I
don't pull out any eyebrow he is look
like glow-in-the-dark it's not working
now I'm so annoyed because I should have
taken this jersey off before I put on
the face mask no really self-conscious
that I'm gonna get a face mask all over
it it feels so like cold on my face at
real refreshing this isn't me
interesting I hate peeling masks
normally I don't think the other day
that I completely realized that it was a
proper like peeling or ask I don't know
what I thought I thought maybe it was
like a peel like it peels your skin not
like a peel-off mask if that makes sense
they just always hurt my face I've got
such a hairy face and it just like rips
all my little hairs out for some reason
as soon as I'm hungover
I just want coca-cola and I drank three
friggin cans of it today Hamish Hamish
is making me a green tea cuz I was full
stomach and I haven't had any dinner and
I don't know how I feel about this me
and him she's just getting really like I
don't know if we're gonna play a game I
don't know if we are going to watch a
movie just gonna chill in bed cuz I feel
so sick every time I'm hungover I'm just
like why do I drink I've been playing
this game all afternoon because I saw it
on TV for it's called alpha BG it's
really fun it's like you join words
together

off let's believe my face is hopefully
my camera doesn't die it's like blinking
real hot out right now okay
it doesn't hurt around my nose I guess
I'm not really have any here's they're
screaming onto my beard oh this is such
a big piece this must be so satisfying
to watch ah I wonder if it's like any
gunk on it I'm going to examine it
afterwards I don't know if you'll be
able to save it it's really cool it kind
of pulled out but some like crap out of
my pores at the same time my skin looks
so friggin perfect now how vain do I
sound I meant rinsed off the extra but
it's bet it's just like my skin feels so
freakin smooth like it's just pulled off
all of like the dead skin I think it
feels so even it's made me very red
though I think it's to be expected
does like feel my skin does feel like
really soft though look at this cute
bracelet my mum found it she said that
she's headed for like years apparently
my dad gave it to me years ago like
before I was ten and she just like got
it first because she had at ages ago

fixed for me so that's cute so it just
