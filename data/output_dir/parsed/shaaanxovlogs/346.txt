good morning so now my face looks normal
amount of turned don't mind me I'm just
in my sports bar right now just woke up
and it's like probably almost ten
o'clock slept in great bad that's normal
for us today on a Saturday we normally
go the gym about 10:30 or so or even
later just depends when we can be
bothered it's kind of like a chill day
and we'll spend a longer amount of time
at the gym as well so Hamish wants a
pre-workout this is the one Hamish uses
it tastes pretty good actually and then
the one I normally have is this one
ignite it's not as intense and I think
it's got like less bed stuff in it I
don't know but I might try this one
today because I used to use this back in
Auckland it's pretty good tessai real
hard at raro which I think in America
railroads kind of like kool-aid I think
could be wrong someone correct me if I'm
wrong like nasty powdered sugar juice

this is annoying way at a rock did you
bring that inside was that you so yeah
we're going to hit the gym and we'll be
back later

smoothie I just made the exact same one

pineapple lifts over

dinner I've got some rockin
lamb shanks and chick peas in here so
hopefully that's nice I'm going to put
some potatoes in there and a bit some
carrots and stuff I guess so I've had my
shower I've just put on some potato and
carrot down there hopefully this turns
out all right if it doesn't turn out
