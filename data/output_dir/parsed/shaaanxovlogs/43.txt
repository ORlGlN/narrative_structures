still but I'm sure we find it's like
6:00 a.m. and I'm so tired
morning so we after typing the reference
7 the PAH a challenge so it off to
Christchurch have a look at this
for this you can scroll right em right
really
we're in the clear launch and it's so
freakin nice in the Wellington one I
haven't been to the Wellington one yet
it's huge
no what's up guys so we are just going
down the road and the South moment we
just got here we loved it yeah but we
stop vlogging wouldn't say what we're
doing I'm doing I'm going we're watching
which just you've wanted to do that for
ages I cried we've just stopped here
they're like fixing the road so we have
to stop for about 40 minutes
was it 45 yeah you guys know or is
whether it was like the Mexican place I
vlogged about it you guys watch my
clothes religiously or remember me
talking about the big earthquake day and
we felt it but then I was like where it
was Santa so the roads are like
destroyed you know very well prepped in
your sandals you wish SCAF see
everywhere so I think we're probably
just gonna what are we gonna do in here
sit in the car relax
yeah just appreciate I guess while we're
out here
we'll continue on we're staying at this
place called the Hamlin so we'll show
you what it looks like
I think it's gonna be decent they
weren't there weren't many hotels that I
could find maybe I wasn't looking they
wouldn't have any so they won't have the
movies either they know I kind of want
to say that Annabelle was it called
Annabelle creation then you enemy or
remove it that looks really good
this is our rental car and we're moving
so while we waited I don't know let's
see if we can figure it out so we got
Sam Lodge there's only a few places here
which is to be expected I got witches
then we got this like seafood basket
with chips and spring rolls and stuff
and we're at let's play wait what's it
called
it's pub it's like on the corner other
Pier Hotel these chips like the best
chips I've ever had this so crunchy and
they're like beer better there's a good
amount of sour cream yeah thank you
not like one little tablespoon need a
whole lot of that building that's
the best word but I feel bad for like
business or news it's just one of those
things and you Dylan art could hit me

woke up super tired
we thought we missed our watch thing but
luckily we didn't this is the place we
say that the Hamptons it was really nice
if you guys ever come up it's a good
place to stay
would you think of it nice eh yeah so we
had our own room it's just like it was a
call yeah he didn't breakfast at Sur and
we had a like you get TV sky at only a
corn the bid was comfy and this was the
bathroom
so super nice this is the view you get
so you can sit out here that's always
some would probably be a bit nicer since
we came in winter it's not super warm
and it's really nice and clean and tidy
and you're just coming through the store
and then the other people staying
upstairs and I think there's another
room off to that side so yeah and if
you're wondering how it works they can
lock you out on the aside and you can
lock them out on this side so yeah they
just kind of do their own thing and you
do your own thing
