quite long and I think we left it one
and then we got here it for who just got
a little apartment it's one room and

so for good thing got free fruit but
it's really good this place is like a
5-minute walk from heaps of the
attractions in Naples like the historic
centre shopping
hopefully there's no ashes look at this
place like narrow roads and houses it's
so different to New Zealand a taxi
driver like dropped us off down here

want to go to the old Naples but we'll
do that tomorrow morning look at this
car yeah it's very overwhelming do you
see the front of it you must yeah it's
like the mental over cheese that our
rooms really good and we're in a good
spot like because it's close to the
historic it's close to the underground
like tunnels and catacombs stuff and
it's close to shopping if you want to do
that but we're not really here to do
them and honestly it took us so long to
find a restaurant last night this area I
swear it's just like pizza on the road
and that's it and of course it was the
only time I did not feel like pizza but
the weather's really good down here it's
like 16 degrees so it's way warmer then
