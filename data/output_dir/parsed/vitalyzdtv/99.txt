what's up villains most of you guys know
me that I climbed that beautiful
historic Hollywood sign to be specific
the D that happened in June 2016 after I
got arrested the police took all my
footage and I finally got it back so
today I'm telling you step for step how
I did it and fuck these tourists around
me I'm glad I wear these shoes they are
helping should I just in case none was
water my mom should put his in you back
you never know how his thirst to be
gonna be
yeah I'm good I'm just going to be
careful because some of these rocks you
grab and they just fall off
gnarly hike quarter of their way up
beautiful view downtown Los Angeles
the hike is pretty pretty pretty epic
hike but we're not giving up
failure is not an option in life quarter
of the way pretty safe to say it's just
that one week when we came out of that
cliff we're out in the open
I'm gonna go up that side I'm gonna sit
down and chill
what smiley smooth
you think I'm gonna be able to run up oh
yeah I'm thinking me we take a flag up
first not gonna get my hand let's just
go that's it
there's no one there's no turning around
it was like a literally 4550 minute hike
with my nail sticking into the rocks
climbing up out of breath I was
literally about to give up but no
failure is not an option there's only
way up and I'm going
and all the sudden I hear the police
officer get back down now you're
trespassing no I don't give up on my
mission I'm going up nothing stopping me
so here I am five feet away the letter
is actually higher than a dog I don't
know how to grab it so I kind of jumped
on that D grab the little thing that
sticks out here you see me grabbing it
how many climb it is and that pull
myself up and I was so out of breath I
couldn't even tell my friend to give me
the flag he's trying to hand me the flag
he untangled it he messed it up by
accident and I'm just like using it give
it to me he finally gives it to me I
climb with one arm up just pull there
just pull up the flag come on yeah take
the bar give it to me come on bro

YouTube's been waiting me for a while I
disappointed my villains for not
uploading for two months I told them

minutes NID I look around I'm like fuck

I'm like no problem I'm going to climb
down the ladder and climb back up

and a half hours I'm like okay I'm gonna
climb down so I climbed down walk down

helicopter go this way surrender
