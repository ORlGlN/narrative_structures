nice beer Taylor Swift while you're
walking over to your Park it is now half
past seven in the morning I think it's
our earliest start so far so boiling
today is abusing our ability to go into
the park one hour early and we have
unlimited fast buses throughout the day
so we're walking along this beautiful
section that is between Universal which
is over there Nonna's adventure which is
over there so we're going to do is hit
up all the stuff we haven't done
starting violence of adventure so let's
get this day started shall we

and it worked out so bad and I thought
this broke and now I'm boiling hot let's
go find the others guys were back not
old hotel room it's so messy
oh my goodness it's so messy I just full
of all our shopping and stuff but we're
back from Universal how did you like
Universal it was good it was good
yeah so I don't know if you heard me or
like she was kind of loud I came
thinking on the Hulk I waited it was
Fast Pass so I went by myself because
you know these guys didn't want to go
and I got to the front and then it broke
down and they said oh I'll be fixed a
minute and then it closed so I was like
all upset all upset and then I went to
get food and then that took about a year
and a half to get and then we just came
home because it's super hot and we done
everything we thought everything we
wanted to do the new Harry Potter ride
was so good but you've hurdled out
already and now because it's only 2 p.m.
that's a jelly bean what's a given user
Michael Knight

little bit soft
yeah we're gonna chain the pool because
look at this glorious day we are have
palm trees we are having look at that
another beautiful day so nice shirt
again the pool chill and then probably
go out for dinner afterwards but I'll
let you guys know in a bit right so we
got in from the pool about an hour and a
half ago and we're just chilling in the
room and this happened so this is the
first a bit of rain we had I think
sister bought it but um it's definitely
a big bit of rain look at that oh my
goodness that is crazy

lightning because it's like really
cloudy we might go to see some at some
point look at that though
