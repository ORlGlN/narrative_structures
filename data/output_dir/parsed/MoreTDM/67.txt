we're back and I've had a glorious nap
so I am ready to venture out into this
oh geez this beautiful weather yet again
to go ahead and go to Magic Kingdom so
it's 5:00 p.m.
takes about half an hour to get to Magic
Kingdom so we're gonna order a taxi and
get in that now and head over to a
dessert party which is going to be
really really cool and hopefully we get
that early enough to be like near the
edge because I know you if you get that
earlier you get better tables but I
can't find thatis it go but for this we
did the mini-golf went out to eat which
you've already seen there's been a good
chill day so let's go to Magic Kingdom
because I'm running late guys we made it
to magic ink and it's now I think it's
about it is coming up to nine which is
when the fireworks start and today
Disney is open 24 how yeah
there's been open since 6:00 a.m. and
then is open to secure the most open
like a couple hours the 2006 am as 12
look how pretty everything looks that's
why there's so many people here look and
they move the fireworks forward to 9:00
so that we can spend more time I think
they've got like special parades and
stuff but it's so pretty
you saw lighting over there as well but
we're the third party right now which
means we've got like brownies chocolate
unlimited chocolate ice cream
it's very very good but now I'm gonna
leave it to the fireworks
long
the
that's cool
you
you
now we're going to try and stay around
for the parade I think depends how much
stuff we end up so we're going to go
through the Little Mermaid ride that's
like a 20 minute way maybe so you should
be ready to go for the parade it's like
a light parade because in dark look it
looks so cool at night though okay so is
it so only the Little Mermaid X and then
hopefully the parade
and we could make it to the parade with
Sol so sleepy it is it's half 11:00 I
haven't even edited or even started to
edit this vlog this is definitely that I
just not so far I think it's even later
than Epcot I think so anyway it's which
thing that usually we stop until like
1:00 in the morning at home but now our
body clocks have changed we've been
walking loads and loads of steps Swedish
you done like 15 16 thousand steps every
single day which is a lot more than I
usually do because usually I just do
steps from my office to the fridge and
back that's what I usually do but anyway
