hey guys so today we are in Pensacola
today off and I'm kind of got this
hombre lip going on I don't even know
how that happened as an accident but it
looks cool so we're in Pensacola
I've never even heard of the city before
but it's like a little beach town in
Florida
and look how cool and beautiful it is
it's so pretty
that's our view from our hotel room it's
amazing so we have the day off we just
shot a video with Josh I waxed his legs
that's probably gonna be up today I
think we are having a day off we might
go to Walmart or do something really
cool like that look how beautiful this
ocean is I'm kidding me right now
love it alright so we are all out of the
hotel finally which I was like for but
we had stuff to do we're all filming and
editing I waxed Josh's legs they brang I
ate Japanese food with Cory and Rebecca
and I edited the vlog and so a bunch of
stuff I upload around video but um now
we need to eat some food because none of
us have eaten and it's like 3:00 or 4:00
this afternoon so on the way to our
hotel last night we saw a restaurant
called right he got crabs crabs we got
them Oh crabs
we got them we're gonna try to find that
place but we'll see cramps we gotta open
every day at 11:00
Gold front dining check it out oh look
at a big crab we're excited look how
beautiful this is
here we got this beautiful view of the
beach and we're all sitting here we
ordered a bunch of crab and fish except
for Becca we're at crabs we got them and
Becca ordered a freaking cheeseburger so
lame but anyway I love it here it's
beautiful I love any beach town just
 take one degree me look at this
Oh see I only need a little tail or a
little I'm not gonna lie I'm very
disappointed everyone at this table
because we're at a place called crabs we
got them and I'm the only one who got
crabs I got crabs look at my thing I got
a crab cake and this other crab thing
I'm about that I don't even know the
name of I got a 40 judge I don't have my
Bloggie sorry for the crappy footage but
we are at a Walmart because I requested
that we stop I like to stop at Walmart
and get makeup and crafts for some
reason that's like my favorite thing to
do on tour so I stocked up on lipsticks
cuz right now my obsession is lipsticks
as you cannot tell right now by how
horrible my lips like and my skin is
like all blotchy but I am obsessed with
lipsticks right now so I got a bunch of
fun colors and now I'm looking for stuff
to decorate shirts with because I want
to make shirts for the crew so that's
what we're doing right now oh we're done
at Walmart and I bought a bunch of
lipsticks but my favorite one that I
bought is this purple one I've never
worn a bright color lipstick like this
before and I figure the bus is a perfect
place to try because no one on this bus
will judge me for it
tipper my house
but I'm going to try it because I think
it'd be fun to have bright purple lips
so let's see how this
cool - we think
backwards lately my
of dark shades of lipstick
and yes she looks good in it but in like
I can't kiss her because it gets all
over me
and so I kind of feel like she's doing
it so that I don't kiss her because it
looks cool I think that looks cool
I don't they got everywhere like out
curling
you look great yeah but I think it's
cool we got a bunch of civil Walmart and
one of the things we got was cool
tattoos so I think we're going to try
out those tattoos a little bit
I'm excited because I'm really scared of
needles so I could never get a real
tattoo but it's fun to pretend to play
around so I'm excited to play around
with them a little later
hola we are now in step away taco mine
I'm very excited
Japan scary kiss heavy do you make the
Taco Bell menu sounds elegant any
possible veneer Katya
Wow well who knew DD shoe she deco bed
man like if you talk like that and then
ask the girl to go to Taco Bell she
would think you're the most romantic
person ever game should Egypt I
mentioned echo bed difficulty mo that
goes oh my god he asked me to go to Taco
oh oh I am BRE yes
I bought these tattoos at Walmart I was
going to at it my whole neck and arm I
pull out the game and it is empty long
hard tough snatch at Walmart saw all my
tattoos and I spent like four dollars on
this package of tattoos and there's
nothing
ll√∫ria I was so excited to tap myself
out I'm really pissed I was really
excited tattoo my mommy Corey's always
asleep in his bed you look like a demon
right now you look like a demon that was
expelling a demon out of your mouth
oh I'm not getting you didn't get Ken
and Rebecca's reading tabloids and she
thinks it's all real okay
since my tattoos didn't work out you are
yes about it I bought a bunch of makeup
at Walmart so I figured for the end of
this little vlog I will do kind of a
Walmart makeup haul we all the makeup
wasn't stolen out of the packages
I thought that means I could've been
was excited to try direct store stuff to
see if I like it because if I find a
cheap drugstore version that's just good
and like why would I go spend a billion
dollars so let's go through so if you
don't want to watch me crown different
makeup I would suggest you change her
tip video sure right now I'm wearing
what's left of my purple lipstick I have
put on earlier that you saw it's kind of
rubbing off but I'm surprised at how
long it's stayed because that was a few
hours ago
and it was like a few bucks so the fact
that it stayed this long and I already
dinner and it's still kind of on my lips
kind of cool okay a lot of you guys ask
me what lipstick I use as Miranda this
is my favorite brand in the whole world
it's NYC Ruby or retro red that's the
color I use as Miranda but I can't get
it anywhere this is the only lipstick
that's bright the right color red and it
doesn't stain my skin so every other
color every other gram stain's my skin
red and it stays red I have a red
mustache my whole day is the only one
that doesn't and it's incredible and
it's like 69 cents but they discontinued
it so it's really hard to find so when
you're at Walmart you saw they had one
tooth but I bought it and I wish they
had a million I would
this is the purple one that I put on and
I loved it I'm gonna have a lot of fun
of it it's fitted matte liquid it's
Maybelline and it was cheap and it was
really fun so I know people hate like
colored lipsticks but I thought it was
fun I got mineral where I don't know
what business
lifting effects natural beige airbrush
finish I don't know it's powder but I
needed a new like finishing powder so I
thought I'd try this we'll see
let's open so okay it's a weird package
I'm not gonna lie that's kind of awesome
this little crappy brush so probably
never used well Oh
it does not smell good
I think this one might be a fail
now I know
Lane product think I hate it
like product it's also like super bulky
like who would witness their makeup bag
like this is a really not
I also got a ton of lip liners this is
L'Oreal and these are pretty cheap at
least at Walmart they're cheap and I
love lip liners and so I got a bunch I
got like a pretty like Barbie pink and a
plum and a dark brown and a deep red so
I got those I'm not going to turn them
all on right now but I think those will
be fun to play with
I got this really fun like Barbie pink
and it's NYC which is that cheap crack
that I use this brand is so I don't
think this will last very long it'll
probably only stay on for like
thirty minutes back
super 8 and lip colors right now got
this one light
teller I'll swatch them and that what we
do here is do the colors that I got
but I want to try
I just tried on a liquid matte purple
one but I want to try on the liquid
matte
okay this is what it looks like that's
fun
trash you like this one better
I like the purple one better I'm super
into like dark lipsticks right now
I know it was cool
but this is kind of fun this is more
summery though I don't think I'd wear
this right now okay I'm going to go
that's my little clicky Nihal those are
the colors
bright purple so these are kind of team
I will see you tomorrow we're going to
go to st. Augustine tonight
tomorrow we're going to drive again and
we're going to end up in Fort Lauderdale
