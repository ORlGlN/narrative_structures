just had the weirdest experience I was
in a little bookshop looking for some
knickknacks for my family and friends
and I saw this magazine of Arianna and I
pick it up and I was like that

of magazines like you know I know she's
famous obviously you know weird to me
cuz I know her as like smoogle Ariana

Ariana just in Dutch on a magazine cover
in a bookshop it was very weird that's
the first time I've ever seen my face in
a magazine and it happened to be the one
