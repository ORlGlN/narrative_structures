my day by getting a bunch of shots in my
freaking shoulder and then I'm going on

all doped up you get to see me nice and
high I'll go back look I don't know if
you can see anything probably not I'll
show you when I get home but I got like
50 shots it was so painful and normally
I don't drive after I have someone take
me because I'm so super and I just try
to look over my shoulder and it was
awful
I made it to the airport and guess who's
coming with me to Vegas hey you can
