fine I'll see you later have fun at work
baby's asleep I'm gonna try to sneak in
a quick run hi buddy hello there hi big
guy you want to say hi bye bye that was
the biggest dog I've ever seen that was
11.6 miles at a 751 pace it is hot
you okay in there Francine and I are now
headed to the beach you want to go are
you doing let me see your flip
that's it for today maybe I'll jump a
little more later
my little brother Dean is here he's
never ridden the hoverboard before it
might be too much hoverboard in these
vlogs whatever I'm not going to stop
okay Dean you want to ride the
hoverboard it's really easy to just step
on it and go here we better take it out
to the street actually of course Dean is
the only person on planet earth who gets
it first try he's literally the only
person who figured it out first time
driving on the curb whoo lunch
all right later
our little brother Dean didn't he looks
very cool when I found him on his
motorcycle before he wanted me to
include this little video clip in the
vlog so you guys will know that he's a
good motorcyclist and really cool dude
I'd like to apologize for the video
quality it looks like he may have used
an actual potato to film this hey I've
got your clog when I left out today so
provides that shot of me leaving the
house with this shot here
so yeah he can do wheelies that's pretty
cool I wanted to shoot this fun scene
until day's log using my big camera but
then I noticed that the batteries were
dead and then we didn't have the right
battery I'm going to go to the store to
get the right batteries for the right
microphone and then come back and then
shoot the scene for the vlog so I was at
the beach today and this lovely woman
whose name escapes me said Katie why
don't you make a movie to help sell the
lighthouse in the lighthouse Inn is this
gigantic mansion house that was a hotel
and now it's just kind of abandoned I'm
not interested in selling it but I
thought I'd make like a little history
lesson about the lighthouse Inn alright
quick history lesson the lighthouse in
this thing which was owned by one guy
his name was Jeffrey and just kind of
parenthetically Guthrie is the name of
the beach that we go to that is all the
way down here got three beach anyways he
used to owned all this land here before
it was turned all these houses okay back
to my history lesson the lighthouse in
here he like sold it in the 30s or the
20s or something they turned it into a
hotel and the hotels had like a whole
bunch of different ownership over the
years and I have like kind of a personal
connection to it in that my whole on
wait for it
my mother's third marriage the wedding
for my mother's third I'm serious third
marriage was here and then like all of
my grandmother's parties after her taps
shows were always here and like we would
do family dinners and like holidays in
this place then some lady is some like
rich lady bought it and she put a whole
bunch of money into it and then she got
arrested because apparently she wasn't
paying her employees
and she skipped town something like this
this is probably like 80% accurate what
I'm saying I think they put her in jail
and the place has just sort of been
dilapidated and slowly falling apart
since then and totally like everyone in
this town wants it to sell and somebody
to make it into a beautiful hotel I have
zero interest in that what I want is for
it to remain like all gross like it is
now and for it to stay quiet what's kind
of cool is when this place was shut down
it was super abrupt like literally
everything in this old haunted mansion
house was left like someone just walked
away so I'm going to finish this history
lesson with a montage of creepy
cinematic shots that I'm going to use
this zoom lens to get
I think the city owns it now and
honestly I'm pretty sure you can buy it
for like a dollar if you're willing to
put the millions and millions into it to
make it nice but I really mean it when I
say I don't want this place to sell the
last thing I want in my neighborhood is
a busy restaurant and hotel with drunk
people and noise and I don't want any of
that what I love having in my
neighborhood is a creepy old haunted
mansion and that's the story of the
lighthouse Inn okay I think that's it
the house is locked up canvas is waiting
outside and we're leaving
now
you
