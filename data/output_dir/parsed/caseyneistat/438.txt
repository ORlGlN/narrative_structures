I totally realize what this looks like
but Francine spill their chocolate milk
on my pants nobody do I eat all that -
is that okay well I have you
we're leaving for Connecticut this
morning but we have to wait for the baby
to wait job she's been asleep for like
25 minutes there was like hair all cuz I
never brush it so like cuz I had to
brush it to straighten I was like hair
getting a little funny cheek awkward but
she isn't that funny
you should do your hair like this again
Candace is on coffee detail I'm out and
watch the car detail we're both about to
be on keep the baby calm while we drive
for three and a half hours detail it's
right there right here Francine you were
there you want to get some McDonald's
I'm gonna get some candy
is it good
back in the car two more hours
don't have my pants they need voters all
right Candice is gonna drive now because
I am a terrible driver
five minutes after Candice made me
switch drivers positions with her she
asked me to drive again because
Francine's lullabies we're putting her
to sleep cuz lullabies are soothing from
up here we're gonna think up on my dad
thanks for bringing the baby bye bye dad
and the beautiful wife to you guys she's
adorable kids kid hard bite out of this
car yeah we're home now
where's your brother huh sit oh and if
you don't start it up a couple times in
the winter when summer comes it won't
start up at all
I'm heading down to the beach down on
the scooter I'm going to do some testing
with this new toy drone that got trying
to figure out if it's suitable to be my
go-to drone I don't feel comfortable
filming myself on the scooter so I
brought in a stunt double my kid Owen is
going to play me I'll I eat from you
it's like driving around the scooter and
I'll film you a key digit
okay I crashed it I crashed it minor
Christ's not a major crash it went down
gently it was going so well too
how's the scooter
shaky okay my feelings on drone so far
go like this I've got the DJI phantom
that's the drone we use for the
snowboard video incredible it takes
amazing pictures but it's like huge and
I have to put it in the big backpack and
it's a lot to carry and manage and what
I want is something tiny that's
autonomous easy to use
please don't suggest the Lili drone it
doesn't exist it's not on the market
maybe it comes out in February who knows
Owens back in any event I'm testing this
toy it seems like this might be a good
stopgap measure until technology catches
up with what I want so I'm gonna edit
together a little action sequence of
owed on the best spot now theoretically
if this thing's worth the damned
sequences like this and the future will
be of me that I filmed of me I won't
need a stunt double let me know the
comments below this campers good enough
or I should just wait for something
higher quality come along okay cue the
action sequence
the verdict on this thing is that I
liked I like the controls but the
footage is like not super sharp
especially compared to DJI the DJI is
like razor sharp
we're in target now friend Tina isn't
feeling well
Owen and I are going to go to the movies
her in can I see in your home
Oh blah blah this is what we're seeing
this this is what we're seeing you are
13 hours is in number boring did you
like it I've seen better my review of
that movie may Michael Bay should stick
to making transformers that is a little
jingoistic for my taste
all right we're getting yeah we're
getting pizza now for Candice you know
I'm just gonna end it there
it was hard boys didn't like me just
show my boobs a lot
