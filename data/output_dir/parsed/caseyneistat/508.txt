franciene what are you doing over there
this this is yesterday's vlog here it
was not November 20th 2011 yesterday I'm
sorry I always screw up the number of
the vlog and the date of the vlog I
literally can't read numbers this title
sequence took me almost an hour to do
which means I was staring at the wrong
date for an hour I never notice it sorry
you want to go for a bike ride
yeah you know like you have to wear that
we were on the bike you okay
take two I stopped and got her a
all-natural
raw vegan organic fruit roll-up she's
been quiet ever since I think she likes
the bike but hates the helmet can't
blame her
Francine look it's Uncle Dean don't you
look back there yeah you a little more
you got some on your face I think she
likes it she delights in her she
absolutely hates it one of the two where
should we go anywhere thesaurus okay
bike ride was an unmitigated disaster
we're going to get breakfast now they
offer anything did you have a tough time
yeah I can make it through thank you
the bike ride did not go well at all but
she's having breakfast now she's
starting off with some fruit and then
I've ordered her some donuts
don't tell Candace Barrentine those
donuts are for you and I know they're as
big as your head but there are no
problems that sugar covered doughnuts
cannot solve Randy how are you don't
know
we see fancying the sugar in your hair
it's in your eyes photobooth five bucks
I was breakfast was it good
yeah it's so good see you later
it's rare that Candice is completely
right about something but she's
completely right about the bike and the
baby we're abandoning the bike we're
leaving it there we're taking your car
home I'll come get it later you want to
come with us leave the bike yeah I'll
see you later
thank you sir my phone whoa
100% made the right decision not to ride
the bike home was it nice to get away
yeah
did you miss Francine did you miss me
baby's asleep
Candace's home I didn't get a chance to
run yet today so I'm taking this
opportunity take it after it no excuses
accepted for not running all right I
know I said I'm not stopping for runs
anymore but look at this light look at
that hashtag no filter the whole city is
pink and orange look at the George
Washington Bridge hey I know I almost
only speak in hyperbole but this might
be the most beautiful sunset I've ever
seen in New York City and I mean that
look at those colors go
okay Sunday which is a long run day I
was scheduled to do 16 I'm stopping at
13 for two reasons one I want to get
home and time to give the baby bath and
two I'm not gonna finish running home
I'm gonna ride home from here I'm just
glad no one stole it
look Francine's helmet still here
okay I've been very disappointed in your
New York City if you had stolen a bike
with a baby seat and a baby helmet on it
thank you for not destroying my
confidence Lyndsey don't be upset with
me for cutting my run short today I will
make up the mileage this week I just
couldn't get all 16 miles and I have to
get home for what it's worth I've got
another dozen miles in me right now
Francine on a scale of 1 to so much how
much did you miss mommy
Oh
