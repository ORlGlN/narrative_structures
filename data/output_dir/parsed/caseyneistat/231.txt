and then oh and did you want to get uh
did you want to get a little pop up Lola
I saw that that's really weird right
last night we get in it like 4:00 in the
morning
hotels dead quiet everything shut down
we drag our bags in the check-in go to
hotel room wake up this morning and I
really just left our car like just left
it in front of the hotel
it was either stolen it was towed or
maybe the hotel got it and found my keys
that I left somewhere and that's exactly
what happened I had like apparently left
my keys in the counter where I checked
in they found the keys we're like what's
this card they
you
broke one that's belts on the PO
keyboard man I'm only a half power
bow job don't work on water unless
you've got power
oh and was still asleep when I left
hotel this morning
he's gotta be up by now I'm gonna go
back and see if he's this is a weed
store
weed is legal in Colorado this is a
legal weed store
so this is inside the weed stores are
super friendly in there it's really
fancy
these are definitely weed edibles
cookies other cookies gummies
paraphernalia here these are like
candies don't know what these are cookie
dough
we drink of some sort and look how fancy
this is the that's the marijuana there
and this tells you about it this is like
the Apple store of weed that was cool
it's like super professional down there
in like mega fancy the thing that didn't
film was there was like an armed guard
who's like a very sweet lovely woman
who's totally polite and cordial it was
like an Apple store but instead of iPads
they sold weed I feel like I can't do a
whole segment on a weed store without
sharing my position on it I think it
should be legal I think it's stupid that
it's not oh hey boy
