late-night rap battle a late-night rap
battle kind of cool with that it's a
little late it's nearly midnight Candice
is asleep Francine is asleep so I'm
gonna have to record this in my closet
so I don't wake them up hold on
everyone's been watching this vlog for a
while knows I've been planning to move
to Los Angeles I've been planning it for
a while talking about it for a while
then we went there for Christmas for
like two weeks for a lot of reasons I
can't move to Los Angeles I need to be
in New York City at least right now I do
so there's that then today we were
looking at new apartments there's one
place in particular that I really liked
and I had a bit of an epiphany bear with
me here this is my living situation
happiness matrix ready first the reasons
I've been thinking I need to leave New
York City these are all the reasons why
I've been feeling like maybe it's time
to leave the city
theoretical list of reasons why Los
Angeles would be a good juxtaposition
for New York City Theoretical is the key
word here so what we've got here is
problem and solution the trouble with
this solution theoretical this is a list
of the current conflicts I have with my
current living situation there are a lot
of parallels between my current living
situation issues and what I had
previously assigned to my problems with
the city at large okay here we go
now this new apartment we saw today's
situation perfectly dressed opposes the
issues I have with my current living
situation which also parallels my
problems of New York City since this is
theoretical this is factual this is more
presumptive than it is practical this is
entirely practical these problems are
actually these problems
and these solutions are actually these
solutions I think we just need to move I
gotta talk Anderson to get in that new
apartment don't understand why it has to
be so tall because I have money
Oh
