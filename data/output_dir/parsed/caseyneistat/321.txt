country good country and I love it

going on today is exciting this is one
of those days where I have all this
stuff to cram in then I have to get into
a car and go to the airport and I have
to fly away so it's like two days in one
day so this morning that means one
business meeting already did it second
business meeting about to go to now then
I've got to pack up all my gear then
I've got to go home pack up all my
clothes but have to figure out to get my
boosted board into a broken boosted bag
board get everything into a car and then
make it before my flight takes off
that's exciting
all right this is a quick meeting here
with Matt then I got to get home
I've got about 20 minutes to get ready
get out of here get home get packed get
the airport
I do need to get out of here I am
running late but look at all these
packages
look I can do like a two-second mail
time
a rugged coffee maker where'd this come
from
whoever sent me to rugged coffee makers
thank you I guess
why rip surf all right I don't know what
this is it looks like some sort of
surfboard skateboard thank you whoever
oh hey so nice a suitcase a nice
suitcase thank you for the suitcase
uh three packages three cool things that
no letters I don't think it knows a
letter
dear Casey thanks for taking the time to
read this letter thanks for taking the
time to write it
inside you'll find something I
personally created from looking forward
crazy Joe alright crazy Joe
crazy Joe I appreciate this but I can't
show this to my alright this is a ring
holder and then what that literally
means if you wear a ring you hang it on
this now I'm going to pixelate it but
try to use your best imagination as to
what this is it's a muscle man flexing
his muscles see which part is pixelated
in real life it's anatomically correct
thanks crazy Joe I got to get out of
here I don't know why I always wait
until the last minute to pack
the key to packing a drone is to pack it
upside down and then bury it with
clothes so when the inspectors see it
from above they just see this
weird-looking camera thing and it raises
a lot less suspicions strumming all
terminal eight Charlie yeah
be comfortable thank you Hey long drive

traffic saying they're talking about 50
to 55 meaning I can handle that you know
how long it takes to get to JFK in a
helicopter

helicopter from here right right there

forever to get here I've got no time to
dilly-dally here in the airport and take
a shower

plane wait for 15 minutes
my flight just got delayed three hours
American Airlines what the fiscal shower
I'm ready for my sleep and guess I'll go
back to the lounge
flights delayed super-quick travel QA
let's do 51 seconds on the clock
have you ever had a slide that make me
nervous and scared the only flight I've
ever been scared on was when I was
flying into Afghanistan and we had to
fly in a circle like this and when I
asked why is because it's harder to be
targeted if you're landing like this
versus landing like this something like
that it was terrifying
window or aisle window always favorite
sweatpants to fly and my favorite are my
um the skeleton one because everybody
loves them but they're not the most
comfortable the most comfortable are
disposable ones ones you get at Walmart
like five bucks you just throw out after
you wear them works why do you travel
mostly without Francine and Candice have
you ever traveled with a baby I travel
for business and traveling for business
with a family is like impossible
favorite airplane food the cookies 100
percent how do you deal with turban it's
dark now flights doesn't left 3 hours
and change late headed to the gate now
thank you you're welcome
there are a lot of very unhappy people
here but check this out
snacks that's a nice gesture awkward
enough for their business class cabin
not the first but not far behind
66k this is weak
okay

five and a half
I like I've been sitting in this seat
for almost two hours now also I miss my
connecting flight tomorrow
America oh hey come on
ah thank God

I guess I could address my red nose
tomorrow May 26th is red nose day red
nose day red nose day is about fun and
being silly but it's for a good cause
it's to support children here in the US
and around the world who are in need
it's a really great thing they're doing
a big thing tomorrow night at 9 o'clock
on NBC where they have like a million
celebrities get together all to raise
money to help kids that are in need here
in the states and around the world I
donated money because it's something I
believe in you should click the link

really like kids and I hate the idea
that kids are suffering ok if you're
even thinking or considering of
contributing thank you
