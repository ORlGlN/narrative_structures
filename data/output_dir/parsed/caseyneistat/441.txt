look at this ridiculousness a
Lamborghini
with a sign on the top
that is the dumbest thing I've ever seen
I mean there's just there's no
aerodynamic efficiency with a gigantic
television on top of a Lamborghini I
don't like this subway I don't I really
don't like taxicabs the only way I know
how to get around this city is on my
bicycle or preferably on my electric
skateboard when the streets look like
this it makes skateboarding impossible
and it really like gross to ride a bike
until the city can clean up this snowy
disgusting mess it makes it impossible
to get round
don't look another school for the baby
Oh doesn't that make you want to have
more kids come on king of little baby
shoes we have one he's very cute you
imagined - this is a crazy conversation
next year well where are we gonna put
another kid they'll share a room where
y'all are you walking back to work yes
I'm halfway there I'm gonna go now but
see you later yeah probably
what does that mean we live together
wifey is really getting excited about
the idea of another baby it's not that I
don't want another baby it's that come
on that's crazy talk thank you very much
what trying to get back on that healthy
tooth tip tastes like burning they taste
like burning heading back to the office
let's talk about 2 million
my landlord
last night at 1:13 in the a.m. our
YouTube channel went from having 1
million nine hundred ninety nine
thousand subscribers to having two
million subscribers I stayed up all
night and I I just I missed it I missed
when it turned over to 2 million right
that's kind of a big deal now if you
remember back a little less than six
months ago when I had this huge youtube
celebration for crossing 1 million I
crassly ended that vlog by saying I'll
see you at 2 million subscribers see you
at 2 million and that was crass because
I just sort of said that to be funny
it's kind of like an arrogant kind of a
thing to say in a million years I didn't
think it would happen this quickly
I remember reading this story about
Facebook ding it took them four and a
half years to reach their first hundred
million users and when they reach a
hundred million users they had this huge
celebration that they did it and then
eight months later they doubled that
they hit 200 million users and there was
no party
there was no celebration it was much
more of like a oh shoot what now that's
a much much much much much much much
much much much bigger deal than getting
a million YouTube subscribers so it's
not it's Apple story I'm not making it
this is not but when I reach 1 million
YouTube subscribers it felt like I had
achieved something that was impossible
at one point in time and I did it and
now here I am at 2 million and I don't
feel like I've earned a pause or a break
the biggest takeaway for me is that I'm
kicking myself in the ass for having had
a YouTube channel for five years and
taking five years before making a bigger
priority in my life I'll continue to
work as hard as I can to make the best
content I can on this channel every
single day
two million it's actually the number of
people you can see galleries number
Calkins is any larger how do you think
one eats this I mean should we eat
together do we have you come down to get
juice green juice and then you find this
I can't not eat it Jack okay guys let's
piggy is it good okay what a really good
 because I think there's some
things that you and I should be doing
that we're not currently doing okay well
let's do that okay no nothing like that
I just mean like there could be
opportunities here like he was saying
all day non-stop meetings my brain
literally hurts from having so many
meetings I've gotta go home now I think
Candice are gonna do something with the
baby tonight feel so sick from that
gigantic cookie that cookie by the way
was from Candace's mother and her sister
very sweet of them
when I say sweet I mean that is a pun if
you guys wanted more clearly there's
still some much I went the entire first
half of the day eating nothing but green
juice and vegan smoothies in the second
half of the day eating nothing but
chocolate chip cookies
feel terrible balloon jin-tae balloon
