I got something mildly exciting to share
with you in boosted board news
the original boosted board that is
boosted one has been returned to me from
boosted board headquarters where they
were fixing it new belts new actually
other they fixed anything is nothing was
broken belts are aware item they just go
they replace them listen to that power
see these those aren't scratches those
are scars of usage yesterday's vlog I
had some very serious technical issues
with this very microphone here my audio
is completely formed and a lot of people
in the comments suggested all these
technical fixes
I appreciate your suggestions but I find
them frustrating because you're not
telling me I don't know the truth is
like yes I could attach like another
reporter or a really high-quality
recorder or I could even attached like a
small recorder and then I'd be recording
audio independently and there's no
chance that be screwed up or I could put
like a better microphone on there or I
could use like whatever this new
microphone is or I could just go
wireless and record it that way I mean
there are a million options that I could
absolutely do but I wanted to explain
today a little bit about like to share a
little bit of the understanding of why I
don't give a about these technical
innovations I just want what's easiest
I'm gonna do some drawings here these
about principles principles principles
principles internet filmmaking
principles it goes like this here's me
with my ideas on the other side of the
spectrum is you the viewers who want to
receive my ideas I think otherwise why
are you watching this stuff I need to
get my ideas from like conception to you
the viewer and what stands between me
and the viewers are these factors like
the cameras and the editing and the
posting and all this other tech stuff my
job especially when it comes to vlogging
is to marginalize all of this stuff the
more I can remove them the more simple I
can make the process the better on the
y-axis here it goes from easy-to-use
to tremendous pain in the ass on the
x-axis here is the quality it looks like
a potato
is like the highest quality there is so
the more of a pain in the ass it is
the higher the quality and with these
vlogs I want to hit a sweet spot that's
like right here so the quality is good
and it's not too hard to use so I want a
microphone that I never have to think
about I want a camera that focuses
without any input from me I just want to
hit a button and have it worked and I
want it to look as good as possible
that's why I don't use any more
difficult to use hardware than what I
already use that's why I really don't
get excited about new camera or tech
gear I just do whatever is easiest I
have this leather jacket not this like
an actual leather jacket it's my
favorite jacket I've ever had but it's
not super high quality I got at some
store on Broadway and it's starting to
fall apart I've been looking Wow
I've been looking but unable to find
like a suitable replacement so I asked
my friend who custom makes leather coats
here in New York City if he could
reverse-engineer my coat and remake it
using like the highest quality materials
he has access to
just to give a shameless plug to my
friends store if you're ever in New York
City on Crosby Street come to gene shop
for the finest quality jeans and leather
goods around it's okay man now you know
I'm just trying to appreciate it
I appreciate it you're the good one who
says New Yorkers are rude just for the
record my favorite jeans in my opinion
the greatest jeans in the world come
from Jean shop they're fantastically
expensive but super super high quality
stuff this man here
this is Eric he is the proprietor and
owner of Jean shop
what are you go into Midtown
and this is Midtown huh look at this
place this is insane so you don't think
places like this still exist in New York
City but they do now when people like KC
where'd you get that leather jacket I
can be like he'll just come up to this
place on 38th Street alright so this is
the original here uh-huh so this is like
a cloth version of what's going to be
the leather jacket right now we're
sizing it and it's just too small it
doesn't fit the arms so they're gonna
they're gonna modify this one we come
back up here I'm gonna try it on again
and then it fits the next time they're
going to turn it into leather no you
don't eat anymore no no no no I can take
