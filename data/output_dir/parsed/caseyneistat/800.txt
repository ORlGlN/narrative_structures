name-o a nice time
age 13 driving experience none
whatsoever
ground rules - driving standard don't be
afraid of the clutch stay in first gear
go really slow put it in first way down
all right slowly let go of the clutch
and get a little bit yes
a little bit of yes and you starve it do
you think you drive to school now second
gear into second
what part of driving do you think is the
hardest I'm probably figuring out how to
do the clutch and then the gas clutch
and gas the shifting you all right well
I think this is a good lesson do you
want to try by yourself before we leave
okay all right don't go too fast here
you go have fun don't go far
good luck don't do anything silly am i
nervous now the boy will be fine
hope he has fun he is driving like a
sissy though there
some people will tell you that slow is
good but I'm here to tell you that fast
is better I've always believed this in
spite of the trouble that it's caused me
being shot out of a cannon will always
be better than being squeezed out of a
tube that's why they made fast cars Owen
how did I do that you did good you did
good you did well in the turns how to
feel
