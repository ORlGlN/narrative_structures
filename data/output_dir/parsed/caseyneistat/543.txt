it's good to see you guys but where's my
new car right there oh god they weren't
kidding
these guys are from Mashable and
Mashable got their hands on this car to
like review it or something and they
asked me if I wanted to do something
with them and I was like McLaren of
course I want to do something that's
what we're doing is just this guy here
in the cycling gear he's gonna race me
through the city on his street bike and
I'm gonna be in this car and this part
was 200 miles an hour and his bike goes
25 miles an hour but if you've ever
driven in New York City before you know
that there's no chance the car can beat
a biker still gonna do it so it met me
driving a McLaren
sir did the field you to look at those
helmet cams that's right
no girl grows today man
this is what this is what I'm gonna be
racing here how confident are you
feeling pretty confident on this I'm
pretty confident you're gonna win - okay
we're shooting the Mashable video now
right
okay I think that was a pretty good take
my acting skills are on par this morning
this is like the starting line shot we
both pull up to the starting line
my favorite part of this McLaren on the
license plate
it says transporter today I'm literally
the transporter
there's a top hand out right
NYPD loves fancy cars I've been ready
since first call man more this car right
now
I think I'm in the lead so far
shoot there he goes whoa I don't stand a
chance
so I'm now like 15 minutes into my ride
and I can conclude supercars are awesome
but they're worthless in New York City
I'm exactly as fast as this big white
van in front of me
that's to say not very fast at all you
like this fucking game ride it's crazy
dude fucking it what is it somewhat
Clarence McLaren yeah McFee known

sound I do i do do it you meet the right
fucking cab driver to know
I just got the Westside we're
approaching the finish line now I can
see it I don't know who won I don't
think it was me I'm gonna end this
storyline now if you want to see what
happened don't you got the video on
Mashable's YouTube channel it's linked
below alright guys thank you this is
awesome good race good race back on the
boosted board back on my normal ride
I'll see you later McLaren till next
time bye guys
my boosted board battery is halfway full
I have a hundred and ten blocks to go I
don't think that there is a snowball's
chance in the hell that I'll make it I'm
making a calculated conservative
decision here to get off the boosted
board take the subway and then use the
remaining boosted board juice to get me
from the subway station to the studio
downtown
uptown the McLaren downtown in the
subway
