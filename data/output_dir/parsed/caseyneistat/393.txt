drone in Austin and no one has
permission to fly drones in Austin
because of the festival they like shut
down all drone flights we've got
permission so I'm super excited about

at at dinner they had these bowls and in
these bowls was like rice and bacon and
this gravy and nobody was eating it so I
ate two of these huge bowls and then
Paul informed me what was in those bowls
