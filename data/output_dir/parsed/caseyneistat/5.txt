this is gonna be like kind of a sappy
love story videos I'll be back to making
like drone and skateboard videos to
birds do bees do even educated fleas do
it let's do it let's fall in love
dear Candace I really really like you
let me explain why
I love that you married me after knowing
me for only three weeks even though your
parents made us get it annulled
I love how much you love dogs I love
that you eat ring dings and doughnuts I
love that 10 years ago you helped me
with a video about our relationship even
though we were broken up I'm sorry I was
such a jerk to you all those years I
love that you don't give a fuck that you
never feel like you have to address to
impress anyone that you were sweatpants
and Uggs to work on a Tuesday I love
that you don't look in the mirror before
you leave the house I loved it in six
years eight years of us living together
I've never once seen you brush your hair
I also love that when you do dress up
you own it like a movie star
I love that you're down for anything I
love that you add it when it's cold love
it when it's hot I love that even though
you totally hate exercise you climb
Lions head with me once in 2011 and I
love you so much for that one time you
thought you were eating raisins but you
are actually eating live maggots I loved
that one time in 2012 when when in order
for me to get back together with you I
had to sit down with you and agree to
terms that you had typed up and
presented to me at a meeting in a park
I love that you support my races even
though you need my races I'm like the
homemade spectator for mild
and I love I love that when your
business partner bailed on you and you
could have shut down your business you
should have shut down your business you
didn't shut down your business you
didn't give up you pushed through and
you started another business that was
more successful than anything you ever
did with her I love that I love that
you're such a troublemaker
check it I love your parents treat me
like I'm their kid I love your sister I
love how much you love me I love how
Chile where that time you thought you
were pregnant
being pregnant and I loved how cute you
were when you were actually pregnant
I loved what a champion you were when
things didn't go as planned in the
hospital
and I even love that she likes you more
than she likes me I love that you gave
me the one thing I wanted more than
anything else in the entire world
not just good
you're just
