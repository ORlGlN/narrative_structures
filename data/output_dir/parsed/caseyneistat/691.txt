are you gonna accept your packages it oh
yeah well you keep you keeping me
walking - it'll keep me busy yeah you
scratch my back I scratch you exactly
that's what somebody asks in the
comments what this um black bag is
that's always on my hip this thing is
just a little like camera pouch it's
where I keep my point-and-shoot and this
is just too bulky to like fit in a
pocket you know it's like that's a lot
to deal with Owen says I look like a
grandpa for keeping it on my waist
yesterday this company called moment
send me this cute little thing what do
you see how tiny that is and in here is
it tiny iPhone camera lens it clips on
like that and it's like this is the
wide-angle lens so it looks like this
instead of like this but I honestly
don't know if I can actually deal with
carrying anything else on my waist I'm
starting to feel like Batman with all
these like attachments on my belt so I
just yesterday finished a new video and
anyways it's like a short video about
how I made these Google glasses so I
thought I would take like a few minutes
of today's vlog and give like a little
bit of behind-the-scenes perspective on
Google glass so I was a pretty early
adopter when it came to Google glass
who's that this is one of my early pairs
this is with Google's frame on it like I
thought the whole face computer thing
was super dumb I still think it's super
dumb but using a Google glass as a video
camera is incredible literally anything
you saw with your eyes you go like this
and then you can film whatever you're
seeing and
like a year of my life where I literally
like wore these things all the time and
I was able to film everything in fact I
made a video I'll link it I'll link it
here all shot on Google glass of me
running around the world this is some
footage from Amsterdam when I was there
last year with my friend jack harries
let's see where's Jack's handsome face
but it's all captured from my
perspective this clip is just called
highest people ever it's a real one yeah
and you got gold right I do it both
faces yeah listen you guys those are
just like the two most stoned human
beings on planet earth and like Jack and
I were just walking around Amsterdam we
ran into them and I happen to film them
so that's why I made these because I
just like I love the camera but I
couldn't stand the ridicule so I thought
if I made them and made them look more
like like my regular glasses that I
could get away with it this is the final
build they're like super sturdy and
rigid and they're pretty tough they fit
me really well they're super comfortable
these lenses are like transitions when
you go into sunlight they turn into
sunglasses and I don't wear them so much
anymore because I did it for a year and
a half I don't know why else what else
to do with them watch the video if you
haven't seen it yet and I would say make
your own Google glasses like mine but
that's a terrible idea do not do that
