camera
I'm on the plane

minutes issue we started taking off more
move
pressure acrostics be away from home
nevermind
ah
there's been some pretty serious
turbulence on this plane
shaky-shaky since we left Mexico
most productive on
I think we have about another hour maybe
out
here
the fact that you don't have to speak or
talk to or interact with a human being
when you rent a car that's how
everything should be and this is not an
endorsement of Hertz rental car so you
sort of have to deal with a human she's
very nice thank you so much total
sweetheart
something bad has happened
see what happened it wasn't my fault
okay it's okay
I've always wanted to go over those
spiked things there's my life today you
gotta see this
I only blew one of four tires which
really not that bad definitely pop
though this is all ran over just do that
is sharp yeah
that'll pop a tire oh it's not alright
it should say this on the other side
no one else sees the humor in this but I
think it's pretty funny the gate also
crashed out in the car look at this mark
has this happened before
you could have
how does that happen before and they
don't fix it you would think that all
right this is my hotel room seems pretty
nice great trip see you tomorrow
that has never happened to me before
