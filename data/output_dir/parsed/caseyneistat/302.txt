home and now we're in the middle of the
Bronx even if you've never been the
Bronx before Francine there's the World
Trade Center
nice work Candace you did it we're home
Candace has given Francine a bath today
was one of the only days out of the last
I don't know five hundred days of making
daily videos where I really struggled to
make my normal like happy true fun video
this morning today is june 13 2016 and
this morning at like 2:00 a.m. something
like that there's a horrible unnecessary
vicious terrorist attack in orlando
florida here in the states 50 people
died unnecessarily at the hands of one
asshole
and I think days like this is really
important to have fun days like this
it's important to smile it's important
to laugh it's important to be around
people you love but the news of that
attack weighed on me like a heavy
blanket and it sort of dampened my
normal sort of daily motivation to go
out there and find really fun
interesting cool happy things to share
with you that's all I wanted to share
that with you tomorrow's another day
it's important to keep your head up
seek out happiness keep smiling and
really appreciate the good things in
life and most importantly to take a
moment look around and appreciate the
people around you appreciate the people
you love
