definitely make this splash no we're
cutting it close
so far the trip is off to a fairly
irresponsible star
and so it begins
we got to heresy 17 degrees outside the
airport look up the barrel
No
all very successful
we visited Tahir square we rode horses
Maximas novice
not the minutes don't dispense Cheetos
for the faucet see forefathers
educational we're in Johannesburg in
South Africa right now just got cheese
we're stuck in Nairobi Brett to that
right now if we're leaving Rover
rent-a-car
the trouble is all of these street signs
are written in squiggly line
like boards two minutes ago we're in
Bangkok in a terrible taxi drivers
taking honey what's up we forgot to eat
today and I've got the shakes real bad
airplane food I've ever seen
look at this wiener
you
