trains are probably my favorite form of
transportation when I was a kid I always
wanted to get on a train by myself
have it take me somewhere great
hey buddy how's your train ride that kid
there in the red shirt that's my kid
Owen is his name he's a good kid he's a
great kid in fact when I was a kid I
wasn't a great kid I wasn't even a good
kid I was bad I ran away from home when
I was 15 years old and got my girlfriend
pregnant and then I had a kid
being a parent was much easier for me
than being a kid especially when he was
little he needed me for everything and
when someone needs you it's easy to be
there for them though yeah my camo
it gets harder as they grow up and
become more self-sufficient they need
you less
see a kid is closest to a parent at
birth it's this tiny little person that
needs you for everything but with age
comes independence and that distance
starts to peak when the kid turns into a
teenager it's weird that little kid you
knew so well you wake up one day and you
don't I didn't want to drift apart like
I did meet my parents Oscar Wilde said
the best way to make children good is to
make them happy
Owens first word is hot pink the dance
school I just thought like we didn't
understand each other
I wanted to remove all these factors I
wanted us to be in a place where we'd
have to depend on each other
we put on vacations before but I wanted
it adventure a little uncertainty so I
got us tickets to Peru but we go find
the lost city of Machu Picchu
one hour layover at my one hour yeah
we're not there yet
the travel was endless after Miami we
flew to Lima where we waited for another
five hours
how was your breakfast but
this is our third and final flight it
was a day and a half of travel and the
kid was beat
I'm making Yellen fill out his own
liability waiver we signed our lives
away and got into a station wagon with
five Peruvian guys
from there was a four-hour drive into
the mountains
we've taken three flights 5360 three
miles then we drove another hundred
miles those is far from home as Owens
ever been
yeah what do you want to be when you
grow up on fireman I hold an astronaut
know what else the kids want to be you
want to work in an office the plan was
we didn't have much of a plan we hired a
guy named Roger who would lead us
through the mountains and valleys and
whatever and eventually we'd get to
Machu Picchu
this was how I understood it there was a
five-day trek day one up the mountain
day two over the mountain day three down
the mountain then some more hiking to a
town where we'd sleep in a dirt bag
hotel before climbing up Machu Picchu
all in it's about 50 miles of trekking
none of this worried me with the
exception of the altitude fourteen
thousand seven hundred feet is higher
than anywhere and that contiguous United
States and certainly higher than
anywhere this thirteen-year-old from
Connecticut had ever been Bowens not
feeling well so we're giving them some
altitude sickness medicine
it'll help funny
he was struggling but he kept pushing
through
Cullen is not going to be thrilled with
these bathroom facilities boy I gotta
warn you these aren't the kind of
toilets you used to I got you some
toilet paper
stop
it's dark out and we're going to bed how
was that do you hear that yes it didn't
sound like any sort of an one we're
going to bed now it's it's 6:45 p.m. any
thoughts of the day on
it's warning time in the tent I'm so
sleep
the kid just puked
I gave him some Peruvian alka-seltzer
forced down some food but he's just a
kid
and he's hurt climbing another 2,500
vertical feet just wouldn't have been
fun at all and that was when we found
the horses would you prefer hiking or
horseback riding this feels particularly
unsafe this is the highest point in our
Trek about 15,000 feet right now you
know feeling so well
I can't believe how tough own is being
right now just handling it like a boss
yeah this seemingly arbitrary moment
here
it was huge for me as a father this was
the moment when I learned the first of
three virtues of Owen nice that it was
his unwillingness to be discouraged his
ability to persist his tenacity he just
pushed God
Owens hitting on these girls he met on
the trail as we hiked down Owen came
back to life no more being sipped
we eventually made it to a little
village
I love arriving in a new place when it's
dark out
then wake me up to find something
amazing
this thing was the longest part of our
trekked mileage wise but also the
easiest made easier when we hitched a
ride for a few miles the guy that's
driving this bin looks a few years
younger than Owen
we got kicked out of the minivan a few
miles down the road and this was when I
learned the second of the three virtues
of oh and I stopped
there's a fine line separating bravery
from stupidity okay
see this table here
in these remote villages there are these
cables that cross over the valleys
locals use them to transport fruit and
vegetables in these steel baskets and
from what I understood occasionally
people will also ride in the steel
baskets that's what we sit in yeah all
right so whatever you do don't rock this
okay ready
it wasn't that he did it that made him
brave it was that doing it was his idea
it wasn't scary was it the next 10 miles
were spent following the train tracks
it was very stand by me hey we're back
here with boss man Bob Cormier from the
racks and stacks it's the best dog wax
it's the cornets
even when he was little I never babied
Hoenn instead I tried to teach him
critical thinking skills then let him
make his own decisions
oh if you get sucked in don't panic and
your feet beneath you and stand up
he wanted to get to the other side of
the river this water was freezing cold
glacier runoff and it was flowing pretty
fast in my best judgment I just didn't
think either of us could make it across
that's ten feet deep
I know it looked like you can't hear but
there's nowhere but there's enough of a
gap Owen didn't share that same judgment
he thought he could make it across
and just like that he was in the water
you did it you laid it across I've never
been more proud of my boy
oh look you can see Machu Picchu
time to wake up
when else Deus for I am relieving aquas
Caliente on our way up to Machu Picchu
it's about 5:15 now we're almost at
Machu Picchu hey doing on
they say how many a kid changes here I
don't know anything about that
I've been a parent my entire adult life
before Owen I was just a kid myself
I've had a lot of experiences in life
but if I had to pick the greatest
