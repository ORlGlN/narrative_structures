because of the romantic nature of this
thought I'd sit on these rocks but this
guy's really reckoned the moment for me
poor little duck
I'm about to have on a run but look at
this technology explosion that is my
desk this is what I travel with all this
stuff this is what my hotel room
filmmaking go-bag equipment dear setup
looks like running a city is the best
way to get to know a city I am four
point two miles from my hotel now I'd
figure out how to get back dropped it
again last night I was exhausted I went
to better like 10:30 or 11:00 last night
I got up today 4:00 in the morning to do
my email as an edit do all that stuff I
finished at like 9:30 I did not want to
run this morning
this dramatic lighting is a reflection
off the table see I had all these give
excuses not to run this morning but I
forced myself to get out there and I
feel so much better for having done so
there's always a good excuse not to do
something
just waiting on that
play
a quick lunch at a restaurant Matt
picked out this is the right amount of
food to two people I would thanks off
you're hungry it's a lot of food I think
good lunch right now I'll see you in an
hour
I thought I saw this interesting thing
on the news near town called Pacifica
California
turns out it's like 25 minutes from San
Francisco so I'm gonna try and find it
Kandice my lovely wife is on our way
home from South Africa right now
we haven't seen each other in two weeks
and the more time we spend apart the
more we like each other right now we are
in love with each other like never
before so I thought today's Q&A could be
love advice from KC to you the audience
KC how do you tell if someone likes you
ah I don't know addict you know what I
have no like it's easier as an adult
when I was in middle school I had no
idea I thought Melissa liked me she
didn't like me but how do you get back
into the dating game after being single
for a very long time there's a monologue
in the movie swingers that really nails
that see Mike the only difference
between giving up and not giving up is
if you take her back when she wants to
come back how do you and Candice keep
the spark going for so long well
basically Candice and I are always on
the precipice of like divorce and just
like each other and chopping each other
up into tiny parts and throwing us in
the ocean so that keeps it excited I'm a
big believer in opposites attract and
Candice and I are like nothing alike and
that keeps things exciting most of the
relationships that I've had that haven't
worked out have been because of boredom
so if you're with someone and it's easy
to keep it exciting that person is
probably a winner my dad asked me not to
date until I'm 16 what's your stance on
this I got a girl pregnant when I was 16
I was a dad by 17 I highly suggest not
dating as long as possible how did you
in Candice end up together after
everything
you know Candace I would like get back
together and break up when we break up
it'd be like years when we were together
and we'd fight we'd be like you suck I
can do better than you you don't make me
happy you're the source of the problem
and then we would start seeing other
people who'd be like this sucks I miss
Candace and then ultimately we're like
no no I'm the problem let me work on me
and that brought us back together
it's still not perfect but it's as good
as I've ever had it why get married you
know I never believed in marriage for
like the longest time I was anti
marriage but if it's important to your
significant other you have to give that
them and what marriage represents it's a
way of saying like I'm completely
committed to you
just for the record like I don't believe
in any of the societal or like political
aspects of marriage I think it's a way
of showing commitment and and that's it
Benji asks my girlfriend broke up with
me how do I make it not awkward when I
see her every day in class
Benji it's going to be awkward every day
when you see her in class there's
nothing you can do how long after
meeting Candice did you know she was the
what like literally a month after our
first date we got married and then we
had to have it annulled at all us others
but we really liked each other right
from the first time we met
I don't know what that means but yeah I
totally I totally agree with you in my
experience there's only one infallible
way to get a girl to like you and that's
make her laugh that's the best advice I
can give em I love with work I'm
completely in love with work I love work
so much I love work cuz work always
loves me back the more I love work the
more it loves me back the more I give to
it them work is my relationship with
work is a perfect relationship I wish my
relationship with my wife was half as
good as my relationship alright that's
the last question now I'm going to
explain why I'm down here there used to
be these houses on this cliff here and I
saw the news that the water was coming
up is eroding the cliffs so much that
the houses were literally falling off
the cliff a neighborhood hanging on the
edge as a powerful el nino eats away the
coastline and may take homes with it
look at that people live there and there
used to be houses here
in fear there used to be another set of
building who knows the ones that were
falling into the water
these ones are crazy close to the
I do respect why someone want to live
here though it is amazing looking off a
cliff over the ocean
that's one of those things that I
remember seeing and thinking I would
love to see what that looks like in real
life
almost back in the city
there it is
that was a really long day
Wow it's exactly like that Aerosmith
song
you
