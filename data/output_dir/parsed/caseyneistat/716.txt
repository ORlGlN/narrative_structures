Jerome has tired my camera I don't know
where he's going
I don't know what he's saying but the
man has my camera and he's taking off
with it you know and you're friends with
a guy like Jerome you just have to
expect things like this to happen okay I
have to say something but I don't want
to say it in front of Kacie so as I took
his camera for a minute I think we can
all agree that Casey's vlogs are a
revolution it's like it's like the
French Renaissance and I've been clearly
completely addicted to these vlogs like
I never watch anything I never I never
watch TV I recommend everybody to never
tuning TV they watch all these
crappiness but I'm completely addicted
to Casey's life which is amazing and so
well told and with so much honesty
anyway Thank You Casey keep doing this
Jerome it's 9:40 7:00 p.m. I'm up
editing and I just saw your clip for the
first time thank you

coming from someone like you now usually
I'm just up the slate editing but I
actually have a commitment later tonight
it's 947 and I saw another hour before I
have to leave the house
okay quarter of midnight come on my
bicycle here's what's going on on the
roof of a hotel in Soho and I'm here
with the Voges een vogue invited me to
some sort of fashion party tomorrow
night and I'm going to make a video for
them but tonight they're doing like a
fitting and they asked me to come they
said it would be fun and that's what's
going on right now I'm just very tired
but it is kind of fun so now I'm signing
a release you are you read this
carefully I will do this that they're
doing a lot of the shooting with selfie
sticks and iPhones which is kind of
amazing and I'm like helping them with
advice as to how to shoot with iPhones
apparently that's my specialty
aside from I don't think so why did I
have to say like they look incredible
Wow one two three
it's almost tonight and it's an action
for the Midgard and again yes in one
hour to get one line shot on an iPhone
with a selfie stand look at these
fashion people with their cigarette
butts look at that just cigarette butts
all over the ground
this isn't France you put your cigarette
butts in the garbage

heading home I'm not much of a
late-night kind of guy but that was
pretty awesome and I'm glad I hung out
