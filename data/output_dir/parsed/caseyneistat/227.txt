you're not bothered by our luggage
Institute don't care I'm so happy to be
on holiday and no work and no baby
no fucking cell phone ringing hi
yesterday started out great it was a
great day then both of our flights were
like canceled you got a different flight
and instead of going to where we
supposed to go we ended up going to
Dusseldorf where do we go we're never
going to Frankfort for we got here this
morning the flight attendant does an
entire hot cup of coffee on Candace
should have known it was going to be a
rough day a laptop who's also their
safety dispatch
I'm so sorry
then they lost our luggage if I were you
yeah
and just so you know that luggage was
everything all we brought in our
carry-on was like are you freaking out I
just spent so much time copying it like
arranging everything frustrating right
I'm just gonna get wasted tonight make
the problems go away we took a taxi cab
to this ship where we had to like check
in and whatnot that was actually the
highlight of the day
cuz we went and checked out the room in
our ship I had well okay thank you how
do they possibly get this here oh my god
I just asked for the phone yeah they
sure do know how to make a guy feel
special ooh here this here it is whoo
then we were on a mission and we only
had like an hour to buy all new clothes
for this entire week so far I've found
flip-flops but I don't have anything I
thought a bathing suit underwear

we're all the way in Italy and I bought
clothes in Beijing and in the end we
actually got all the clothes we should
need Canada's got a bathing suit and
that great hat Italian I do have time
honey but whatever we're on the boat now
which brings me to the point of this
whole movie which is to announce that

don't think I just like I need a break I
think today is my 530 fourth day in a
row where I've uploaded a video and I've
uploaded like 550 videos or something
like that in those five hundred thirty
something days like that's crazy and
when I was booking this trip the first
trip that me and this one took since the
baby was born like a proper vacation I
said to her I'm not going to daily vlog
it and kennis actually encouraged me to
daily vlogging it so I want to take this
week off I want to take this week no

made a mistake but I said in a really
nice way just taste the chocolate the
