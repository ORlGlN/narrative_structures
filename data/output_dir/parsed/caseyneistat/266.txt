all right just just bear with me here
before before today's episode begins
just do this do this exercise with me
ready I want you to really think of
somebody you you really love
maybe it's like your mom your dad or
your kids or your girlfriend your
boyfriend or your wife or your just
somebody you love and then just just
picture yourself holding them and you
hang on to that thought while I play
this music for like 10 seconds there's a
fondue apathy usual to gravity be cool
to noodle a tyranny a little of saga
love elevate each other so great a lovey
Oh Tony budala Campania find find more
of those moments hanging on to them it
brings a key
it
boom
gummybear got me there look at the size
of this thing today in the crazy world
of weird that people have sent me the
world's largest gummy bear ready for
this 51 servings a hundred and twenty
calories so 50 this is 6,000 calories
right here thanks Alex I don't know what
to do with this
did you see the video online where the
guy made this for me I made one for you
I do like machine this mini tripod out
of aluminum
I made this by hand brilliant a couple
days ago I showed my new office space
and I explained my big ambitions for it
that I wanted like hire people and now I
did not say in that video that I wanted
people to be sending your resumes or
that I was actively hiring anyone but I
got like 500 no joke 500 emails from
people asking me about you know working
with me me hiring them this segment is
gonna be called yo let me get a job I
would say most that's like 80% literally
80% of the people who sent me their
resume did one thing and that one thing
is completely wrong and I want to
explain it to you because if you're ever
applying for a job don't ever do this
all their emails all their cover letters
bells started by saying something akin
to dear KC I want to work for you so I
can fulfill my dream of KC I want to
work with you because I want to learn
work for you because I wanted to take me
to the next place because I want to
fulfill my goal of all right all of that
is wonderful and I mean it when I say
it's tremendously flattering for me to
hear I've built and run like four five
companies in my life I've been hiring
people for ten years and one thing
that's never really compelling is
dwelling on what I can do as your
employer for you and it's because the
employer is hiring you the employer is
paying you to do a service instead of
talking about how it's going to benefit
you
you should always focus on what you're
going to do to benefit the company
meaning I find it much more interesting
when a cover letter says here's what I
can do for you I can build things I'm
gonna deadening video I don't mind
working long hours I'm driven I'm
focused here are all the things that I
can do to better your operation when I
was younger applying for jobs that is
all I focused on was how I would be an
asset to whomever was considering hiring
me
all I have to say here lower your
expectations this is not a miniaturized
phantom4
this is a tiny baby toy drone look how
little it is tiny look how small it is
compared to my hand it doesn't have a
camera but I bet I could attach one to
it all right it's on little lights
whoo
you want to play it
I don't know
the lawyer
Oh guys got killed literally dad got
done I let some stranger fly it now it's
in a tree oh no I can see it
