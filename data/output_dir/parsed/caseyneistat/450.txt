never gets easier leaving the baby in
the morning
never gets easier big day today leaving
town first thing tomorrow morning lot to
get done is this sign here yesterday yes
it's been there for like a month now
running out quickly to buy two things
one is really interesting and one is not
interesting at all
you saw the New York Observer yeah you
have it oh right side oh thank you
this is last week's this is not what I'm
looking for
that was last week you don't have this
week's well that's disappointing
I did awesome hands Casey hi Lina Lina
nice to meet you take care
New York Observer observer
maybe what I'm looking for is not out
yet all right
this was where I was trying to find the
New York Observer I couldn't find it but
it's did you just take your teeth out
again it's I don't think the print
versions out your breath online look
observer meet the power couple you want
your next dinner party
look at those two and look we're
trending number one isn't that funny
okay back to the blog all right I'm on a
trip to do two to do one thing that's
not very exciting this next part of the
vlog is pretty like gear tech techie
kind of thing so if you're not
interested in gear tech just like skip
the next minute and a half or two
yeah what's up in case you take your
hand I've been checking out your YouTube
channel evening pretty dope always can't
run hands I needed iPad
are we cool can I take this now hey take
it yeah thank you very much okay hello
there is no better experience in all of
retail than buying something out an
Apple store in and out in two seconds
got exactly what I needed
they were super helpful and very smart
what's up yeah so like I said unless
unless you're a big camera geek you
might not care about this but it's a
really really big deal to me and I'm
super excited the bummer is I had to buy
yet another iPad to get this contraption
this contraption that I'm building now
to work I'm going to set it all up then
show you what it is making some progress
not a lot of progress
sorry if you guys get stuck outside hey
what's up guys how much it's been
minutes I'm out fifteen months all right
oh yeah good now I'm literally losing my
voice because for the last like 40
minutes I've done nothing I'm going to
cut him off I've done nothing but tried
to convince Adrienne here to go back to
uploading dailies because he had a
one-month long series on his YouTube
channel it was like a vlog and it was
some of the best daily content I've ever
seen on YouTube I tweeted about it every
single day and I said to him like I miss
it since he stopped and I've been doing
nothing but trying to convince him to
bring it back how am i doing good you're
really good I think so yeah yeah you you
give me a lot to think about
and I really won't won't be so you took
that YouTube misses you I'm gonna link
your stuff I'll link his stuff here but
you don't know this guy start it
vlog just start here and watch everyone
and order it incredible stuff
I'll see you on the Internet and I'll
see you in very City very soon bye guys
I love those guys but back to what I was
doing before all right and you see what
I'm talking about all right all right
cool that's it thanks for taking my
crisis call it works now and I'm psyched
to play with it awesome I really
appreciate the love it you giving us a
look how much channels every day so do I
look good yes all right later thank you
okay I literally called the company that
makes this thing because I couldn't
figure it out but I got it oh my god let
me show you what it does
see this big fancy camera here this
thing is it's it's hard to use but the
biggest liability of this camera is that
the monitors in the back here so I can
never see what I'm shooting unlike on
this camera where you just flip it
around so this thing that Manfrotto sent
me yesterday is a way of connecting the
iPad to the camera so I can fully
control this fancy camera including
focus and everything else on the iPad
let me talk to the fancy camera here
this makes my whole operation easier all
right I'm going to stop I'll stop
talking about Gearrin I'll stop I'll
stop talking about the gear now I'm just
really excited about it just one more
thing about the gear I upgraded the
drone so it won't crash so much I got
these guards so when I fly indoors and
it bumps into the wall that it won't hit
the rotors
I think we're going to dinner tonight
leaving tomorrow morning 5:00 a.m. if I
totally freak out again I'll call you
