opportunity to be taking a big dog
alright bye dad alright my front lawn
looks like a set from Jurassic Park so I
have to mow it but the lawn mower
doesn't have any gasoline and it's
either gasoline and I don't like to take
the car to go fill up the gasoline so
I'm gonna take the scooter to go to the
gas station you get gasoline through the
lawnmower so I can mow the lawn
okay exhausting
safety first
the tough part here is driving home with
a two and a half gallon container of
highly combustible gasoline between your
knees should be fine
