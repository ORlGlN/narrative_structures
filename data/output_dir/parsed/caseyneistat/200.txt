there's a bird there's a parrot a bird
on this guy's shoulder
hasil
solid run got straight 7.17 miles in
there to 720 per mile place this is
Prince Elmo Fork I'm back on that raw
organic vegan smoothie tip over I used
to only raw organic vegan smoothies
thank you
I have a like a Google Alert set up so
anytime my name shows up in the news or
any like pump online publication I get
an email because I don't know like you'd
be surprised how often like I make a
video when my vlog anything I just like
to know whatever my name is so this
morning I get this bonkers email and
there's like there's like a hundred
different news outlets that have written
about my airplane movie I haven't had a
movie go viral like this since probably
since the snowboard video you see mis no
board movie this is like a nine minute
vlog that's done ten million views
that's insane okay in any event why am i
bringing this up okay because there's
one article here it's in a it's in a
publication called the Gothamist which
is like a big New York City blog
alright here's here's the part that I
like it says recently professional fun
have or KC nice that professional fun
have our greatest title ever Casey nice
that and then here's the part that makes
me AKA real-life Poochie now look I make
a living by sharing my life in the form
of videos on the internet being called
names is not something that is new to me
but I've never been called Poochie so I
look up what Poochie is I think he needs
a little more attitude
there it is right there I am the
real-life Poochie hold on ready and by
the way I don't always wear a backwards
hat I just say have really curly hair
and like if I take a shower like I did
in the airplane I don't wear a hat it
I've started doing something that's like
a little bit stupid and a lot a bit
risky
it goes like this ready
I take my boots to board and then I take
this bike lock wrap it around the pole
and then lock it through my truck just
like that
so it's locked the trucks there and then
this is locked here and then just sort
of leaning up against like that it's
risky and stupid because that's really
expensive and this isn't super safe but
for like five minutes
it's so much easier than carrying that
heavy heavy boot Saburo what's up I like
all your videos when you do a great job
to take one take one I see your video
seriously you don't agree job you see my
wife in here oh you see my wife teachers
at school said Francine loves playing
with water but they need more shirts for
her this is where I can despise baby
shirt
so just buy a t-shirt we have like a
photo shoot with the cousins
yeah this is all you I don't know honey
Nancy keep up the good work man I like
watch all your videos I appreciate all
right I'll see you around
what's up look it's still there
it held you would wear the coca-cola
dress
awesome-looking to choosing me and then
and then I'll go back to the office but
you don't like these taxes don't have
the ones that I want my size I like
these but they don't don't have them in
11 oh good right bye honey
see you later I try I don't always
succeed but I tried like take a half an
hour an hour out of every day to spend
with the girl like out of the office or
doing something trying to keep that
relationship keep that marriage on the
level you know
this is my main camera great camera mm
good camera its weakest link is this
right here this mini jack always fries
in fact I have I'm going to show you I'm
going to show you what I have I have one
two three four and five
oh okay four and all of these have the
same issue microphone jack broken I
think there is a very good argument
there to say it's completely my fault
that the microphone jacks broken because
I half the time I put the camera down I
put it down like this not cool
this metal clip here is meant for
attaching a camera strap but I think I
think that I can use that to attach a
piece of wood and make like a protector
for this the Japanese pole saw is more
precise of a tool than this
you see the trouble is after navigate
around all the precision movement and it
can't get in the way of the screens
ability to pivot so it's like a very
specific size piece of wood here
this fit is absolutely magical plugging
it handled a lot so you know definitely
want soft edges on this yo do it will
you get out there man
is that your vlogging camera parlous
whoa what is that this is a red it's
just like your cameras it just shoots a
little bigger good look on your shoot
thank you sir
I love this building just all people
making stuff alright this is the this is
the sketchy part given this a lot of
thought and I really think drilling into
this camera would be a bad idea so I'm
going to glue it thermal adhesive hot
glue it's the only one that it's pretty
forgiving one time I use an image
similar to this as my thumbnail and
everybody thought I was like smoking
crack or something get in that crack get
about four seconds before this fully
cures so hey thus concludes the arts and
crafts portion of today's episode it
never touches the table
I'm going home we're putting the baby in
the stroller and we're taking her for a
walk because tonight is well tonight's
special good job
Francine yeah you're the best scooter
ladies job Cantus you know the reason
why we had to come out tonight is the
last day of summer officially officially
for me you know if you go back 365
episodes that you'll find me saying this
one year ago today but for me the year
always ends when the summer ends so
there's the time do you want to get the
most bummed out and weird and
existential or not but it's also when we
get the prettiest sunsets I get a lot of
these requests it's impossible for me to
address all of them give kids I've got a
friend who watches your episodes
religiously he's a marine in the US
Marine Corps and was just promoted to
Colonel so I just want to acknowledge
and congratulate you
Colonel Dan wisten wisten started on how
to pronounce your name from Asheville
North Carolina congratulations on the
promotion that's a very big deal and
thank you for your service
