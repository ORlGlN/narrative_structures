it is like 10 p.m. I'm on a train right
now I shot an amazing vlog today so just
looking at the footage I have no audio
for a lot of it it's probably my fault
although I don't understand why this
camera doesn't have audio level while
your report is infuriating so today's
vlog is gonna feel super montage me I'm
sorry where I can find audio in there
the not it's such a good blog too filled
with adventure and family wonderment and
all kinds of other awesome adjectives
miles
you
oh okay super early paddleboard ride
here where should we go
the lighthouse have you been to
lighthouse that's just a you faked all
right let's do it we're gonna go there
Brady is still out there
gotta respect that
so there's a really nasty crosswind
coming out so we're anticipating it
being worse on the way back what that
means is when you're on the paddleboard
and there's a crosswind or waves from
the side it throws you in the worst way
the most jarring way possible and that's
what it is the entire way back which is
from where we are right now all the way
to that shoreline that you can barely
see out there here listen to this wind
ready that's what we're about to paddle
into
you
I just fell in oh it's not a big deal
it's just really jarring these ways is
he from the side and it threw me in the
water and I'm soaked
Brady's back alright yeah nice job man I
fell in did you see me yeah

breakfast and then we detoured and went
to Scott's lobster dock

rolls for breakfast instead of going to

lobster dock we're still go to my mom's

dad's coffee shop so he can see the baby
