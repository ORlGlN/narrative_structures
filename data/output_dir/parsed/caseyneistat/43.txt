she had Jakarta I'm here just for today
and I fly back to New York which is
challenging since two days to fly here
two days if I only here for one day but
I'm here for idss I do want to try to
soak up as much of this amazing the city
as I can in the next few hours before I
have to be at the event
we're seeing those pictures of what
donald trump's apartment looks like in
new york city
I got to show you my hotel room here
looks like so what we here for one day
and I'm here by myself but this room is
bigger than any apartment I've ever well
pretty much better than any apartment of
our binning so let some snacks that they
generously put out for me
more responsible snacks yeah this is
like the dining room table I guess this
room right here that's probably the most
interesting part of the entire hotel
room situation this room isn't for me
this is for my Butler I have a butler
he's always here he's never not here
watch it bitch he's outside this door
right now this part of our coloring on
my Butler's quarters there's a coffee
machine which I I broke but they fixed
it say it's just in case I need him to
prepare something for me I don't need
him to prepare anything for me look at
the bedroom I haven't actually seen the
city or seen any event in eg yet because
I haven't left this room yet but there's
just one more thing I've got to show you
well two more things well this is one of
three toilets in this room and watch and
then the last thing is this shower I
don't really know what this is about but
it's like a like a shower tank or
something
how long have you been a butler almost
true yes do you like it yes is your
phone ringing
punya do people expect you to be able to
speak the native length no they don't
they don't I love it it's not a lot of
it's it's really fun this is P at what's

couple hours it's really soaking with
this city has to offer
I've only been on the back of this car
for about three minutes but doesn't feel
like there are any real rigid traffic
laws here it's more of a every man for
themselves kind of mentality which I I
do appreciate
thank you yeah that was way better than
a car yeah so much faster so much faster
this is this is the welcome to Jakarta
statue okay I was it was created way
back when they were building the city
this Hotel Indonesia is the first hotel
I was ever built in Jakarta and then

aren't traffic laws or just that people
choose not to obey them
