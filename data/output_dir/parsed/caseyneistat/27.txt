so I get emails companies reach out to
me I get contacted all the time people
wanted me to review or talk about their
new products I almost always say no so
this company called Rilo contacted me
about their new 360 camera
I was super skeptical it's a 360 camera
and I already have this 360 camera this
360 cam this 360 camera and I even I
even bought like this 3d printed GoPro
360 camera Wow well I do think 360 is
important I just don't so that's why I
wasn't super interested in this camera
but then they sent me this video as to
how it works
so what that was is using a 360 image
the same kind of 360 image that one of
these would give you and basically it's
like pick whatever camera angle you want
pick it in post-production and they also
made software that enables that
but it grows your hug
so again I'm just holding this I'm just
holding this thing still and like that
spinner on so you could see that guy I
did that in your app app I recorded this
now what's particularly compelling here
is not so much the hardware the
hardware's it's nice its sturdy it feels
well built but it's the software here's
how I was doing all of those shot again
unfortunate they don't have Android
software but here's what it looks like
on my iPhone alright so that's the image
that's the image as it was shot there
but then in their software you can
navigate what the camera is pointing at
so there I am yapping at the camera just
kind of tap to pause on that ready then
hold on my face like this okay now look
I'm locked on my face I can tell it to
or follow this face so if I do follow
this now no matter what my head is what
stays level on the shot
so that entire skateboard ride I just
had this thing out it's charging had
this out in front of me like this I
wasn't spinning it I was doing I was
just holding it in front of me oh you're
here or we gonna go do something so fun
Franny yeah yeah did you take a nap
you did sleep my man how you doing cool
baby everything good everything's great
how you been I'm good I'm good
happy holiday happy holiday Claire to
see you in two come with us
traffic so the question is is there real
market for this camera and its
technology or is this just another cool
gimmick that people will get sick of
quickly and and the answer and I don't
know the answer see tomorrow is the
Macy's Day Parade and they fly all these
floats down the street and this is where
they fill them up with helium the night
before see the big helium tank right
there
so at $500 who is the Rilo camera
actually for made a chart I see the
whole camera market as bifurcated into
two groups and this is an
oversimplification but I think it does
sort of illustrate the point anyone from
an aspirational creator all the way to
professionals are in one category the
other category I just call casual as
here's some concern for this product if
you're in the first category that is the
aspirational it's a professional
category or around the same $500 you
could get an entry-level SLR camera like
this thing or you get a high quality
point-and-shoot like this so if I'm an
aspirational creator I don't know that
I'd be spending the $500 on this because
it's not quite as dynamic as a
traditional camera and then on the other
side of that spectrum you've got
professional users and if you're a pro
you're not going to use a consumer
marketed product like this you're going
to use maybe one of the fancier GoPro
rigs or something like that so I don't
think this fits in to this category so
does it fit into the sort of casual as
and my feeling on that is also a no
because casual as creators they just use
their phone
so that's it that's for that's it for my
my Rilo experiment seems like a very
cool device had was good
yeah and for what it's worth I really
appreciate that this is a startup
company meaning a student coming from
like a huge corporation or anything in
fact when they sent me this device they
sent me this little video Chris from
Rilo I'm definitely rooting for you and
your company I hope this thing finds
success
do I see a place for this in my own
repertoire of filmmaking tools I don't
know all right that concludes another
case united side tech review I think
maybe cuz it's Christmas or something
but people are sending me an insane
amount of gear there's like five new
electric skateboards over there I don't
even know it's in these gigantic boxes
over here expect a lot more reviews
coming from this channel soon
