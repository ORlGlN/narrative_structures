hi there I want to share my VidCon
experience but not share it in like a
regular video I wanted to show what the
actual experience is like and that's
something you can only really do in 360
so this is my VidCon experience I'm
gonna start here in this hotel room it's
not a particularly glamorous hotel room
it's got this couch it's got this bed
there's one window with a great view of
the parking lot like this kitchenette
situation over here and I probably
shouldn't show you the bathroom
it's like pretty disgusting in here
don't don't look around too much this is
the roof of the parking garage it's the
only place I could find in all of VidCon
where I can safely fly that grow without
having any security or police give me a
really hard time ready
what's that on the big hair oh I'm a fan
of you Casey
ah my name's Casey just I'm like
shooting a scene for my 360 video right
now this is what it's like to be in a
panel at VidCon I make daily videos
mostly to say revolves and then
sometimes daily other videos and stuff
it looks like it'd be Khan when you're
trying to get a car to leave the hotel
that's what you want to be let's do it
playing almost like a penny only so I
set it down
like a hobby yeah yeah
Casey you should probably take this
thank you
this is what the ballet looks like at
big toggle design
and this is what it's like eating good
time it's a little sad goodbye
hi guys
you
