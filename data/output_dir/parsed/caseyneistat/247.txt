nobody wants to sit next to a screaming
baby so it's pretty easy
welcome to the Saturday edition of the
vlog today will be a travel episode the
rolling suitcase is it okay what else
oh we do it downstairs going down this
tunnel in the future is a lot more fun
on a skateboard
apple juice orange juice box here you
don't squeeze it don't spill that
do you know what I call Hershey's Kisses
why because the sound the chocolate
makes when it's pushed out of the thingy
it's like this yeah we're getting out
now frenzy baby headphones headphones
those Hennis they come Francine
so we are going to Texas we're going to
Houston Texas for a less than 24 hour
long trip it's a family thing Candace's
grandmother passed away when year ago so
we go back in it it's a family issue
quick trip though
we made it on the plane we don't have
the correct seat so we're gonna have to
two people from their seats no big deal
forty minutes later we are still sitting
on the runway have not moved
they're not sure on how long they
intermediate Austin Daye Hatun our
modern
now been on the runway for over an hour
I don't know how much long as the last
and we still have like a three hour
almost a four hour flight ahead of us
the baby's freaking out Candice is
freaking out I'm freaking out it's not
Jeff Lewis fault there's a I guess
whether something we can't take off I
mean this would suck generally but with
the baby it really says we're gonna have
to go back to the gate right here I do
apologize I'm profusely for this latest
delay we're back at the gate all hell
has broken loose now everybody standing
up the pilots have to switch because
they've been on the plane for too long
Francine is kind of a champ though we
just keep getting more sweet Candice on
the other hand
we're on the plane for three hours even
now we're getting off the plane we
traveled nowhere
so Jeff JetBlue gave us some free food
vouchers thanks JetBlue probably
includes alcohol we're getting some
snacks for part two the plate Candace
Evans and wine
franzine is just chilling
still here no change they told us 15
minutes we've been gone for 40 minutes
it doesn't look like they've boarded yet
daddy will open these for you we're
giving up we're throwing in
here's our Francine
I love eating marshmallows we're
throwing in the towel we're going back
home we spent the whole day here at the
airport well it was nobody's fault I
guess is the nice way to say but we're
not going to Texas you're not upset I'm
upset about not seeing my sister
don't mean to take Francine when you fly
out
that's it mission aborted getting in the
car driving back to the city
you know these things happen you can't
be upset I mean it sucks but it was the
weather's fall it's not like there's
anybody to blame these are just sort of
the pitfalls of life at the end of the
day we still had a fun day with the baby
running around eating junk food you know
it could have been worse
you know what I just realized Candace we
went literally the entire day without
being outside except for when we walked
to and from the car the whole day
I'm a miserable human being unless I can
be outside at least some portion of my
day especially in this city
