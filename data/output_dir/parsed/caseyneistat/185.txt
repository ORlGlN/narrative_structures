point they picked up there these are the
Nike mags these are what Michael J Fox
were in Back to the Future 2 these shoes
that Michael J Fox won Back to the
Future 2 our electric didn t what are
they what do they do how do I explain it
they Auto list it auto listen they
automatically close they automatically
tighten yep and they stop at a
comfortable setting based on the foot
that's it how do you guys build these
very carefully sheesh oh you're you're
the engineer behind so you did all the
math um not all of it I'm the senior
innovator so I have a big engineering
team your title senior innovator yeah
explain to me just give me the rundown
on how it took 10 years to build these
things well it started in 2005 Tinker
Hatfield there was a petition with like
30,000 people saying make the backed
future shoot you know tinker is like the
designer of all state of all Nike
designers like he's done all the Nike
Air Jordans almost he's like he tinkerer
is like the he's like the he's like that
I can sew the lace engine that's in here
sits in the bottom right about this area
what does a lace engine mean lace engine
pulls the laces tongue we charge it you
there's a little jack right there plug
it in both shoes it's a Y cable that
looks into the wall what did you just
turn the lights on yeah
oh my god can I try these on absolutely
okay now releases all right
oh yeah the asian titans red loosens
whoa I mean obviously which one group
yellow yeah Wow
is it a generic tightness or does it
tighten it's different for everybody so
there's a tension that's in there and
it's waiting to see the tension so like
if your foot volume is larger it'll
it'll tighten less the color scheme is
did you just work off images were you
able to get the original prop we had
some in our guys yeah so how these
things work is there three little
buttons here when you push when you push
the yellow button lights hold on ready
lights to get them to tighten you just
put your foot in in like really step on
it and it tightens can I tighten it
without my foot okay or get yourself a
green arrow and a red arrow and you just
look at the laces
and then
the reason why I want these guys here
and the reason why I'm going to show you
these awesome sneakers Nikes giving
these things away via raffle it's ten
