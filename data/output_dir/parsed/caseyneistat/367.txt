we're having an early-morning date
chandus wakes up early now because our
new apartment has more sunlight in our
bedroom than the older part are you
cutting that in half
important to starting today with a
healthy fish honey how's the date going
so far it's great great way to start
today well you're not having fun I'm
having a great time this is a great date
Candice has a doctor's appointment very
close to the office so I'm sharing a
taxi with her so we can have a little
bit more quality time together I don't
need to be in this taxi though I got my
boosted board I'm just doing this so
because Candice basically begged me to
ask to go
I'm getting a lot of questions about
studio renovation how that's coming it's
going really well this room is done my
desk is done all that's left out here
really is to finish this area up which
is getting their shelving is still
imperfect and perfect and perfect and
perfect it's not right but it's almost
right this is an art school for a friend
made I'm going to remove that and make a
bike rack here and then that's it
the studio is completely done out here
all that's left is in here and and
that's a huge amount of work because
this is what it currently looks like I
don't know it just looks like a total
train wreck in here it's a disaster and
when I'm done this is what is this is my
inspiration my camera layout is going to
look like the gear closet on the movie
the Kingsmen these are going to be
cameras gear microphones this is what
it's going to look like in there I
wanted to live somewhere between like a
camera rental shop and a museum that's
it so the studio is like 70 to 80
percent done but progress has really
declined because I've been traveling and
just been busy
this just came in the mail I thought I'd
open it on camera don't know what it is
but it feels very very um it feels
important or special that says comment
comments know what this is your book
oh is this from YouTube Wow
all right what this is what this is this
is from YouTube they made this for me
it's a book and it's all like comments
from my videos and then they had artists
interpret those comments and turn them
into like artwork this is so good and so
special YouTube why not you deserve this
thank you wow I love it when people make
things for me look at that look this
lets me still have work to do here at
the office but Candice just texted me
she went home early the middle of an
afternoon
Janice and I are out having another day
Candace earlier today I'm not supposed
to say that there are some people
looking at us over your left shoulder
spotted
it is so nice taking a break from work
for a minute say hi to the lady and now
I'm on my way back I wish I did that
more often trying to figure out why all
I can hear in my office all day were
fire alarm say the entire block is
burning down
five I guess I bet that scaffolding you
fell it's like 6:00 p.m. the days over
and I don't feel like I've gotten
anything done today I had a fun morning
with Candace I had a fun afternoon going
to see Candace again and then I was just
kind of doing a bunch of nothingness
they got me thinking about distractions
distractions distractions are everywhere
and if you're a youtuber or filmmaker or
somebody creative who tries to make
things you know how easy it is to start
something how hard it is to finish
something because between starting and
finishing like all of these distractions
all these forces that keep you from
getting from here to here the way that I
combat that like my thesis for this show
is to embrace the distraction and have
the distraction just be part of the
narrative so today
Candace calls me and then when I come
back here and I'm like sitting I'm like
why haven't I had anything done today
it's because I'm so distracted so I'm
like okay let's talk about distractions
distractions now part of the reason why
I redid this entire studio at its core
the purpose that the studio serves is to
remove all of the distractions or all
the obstructions between me and making a
movie but it becomes such like a total
mess in here such a cluster then it made
it hard for me to actually make movies
so now so now we're redoing it all so it
makes it really easy for me to make
movies and the last thing the Kingsmen
style closet back there is where all the
gear goes so it's like perfectly
organized and perfectly accessible and
that is essential having your deer-like
situated not having to think about the
equipment that's involved in making
these videos is essential and that is
best summed up by a quote by my good
friend max Joseph gear is the ultimate
procrastination the reason why I like I
hate it when people ask me what did you
shoot that on it's because like who
gives us the gear all of this is just a
tool to facilitate the process this says
the stuff doesn't matter and spending
too much time trying to find and manage
and deal with that gear near has
distracted me so soon the studio will be
built it'll be perfect for dealing with
all the equipment for now like look at
this
like 12 left sitting on my desk
okay I'm finishing up and going god my
hair is long
sorry
better don't get any ideas Candace
