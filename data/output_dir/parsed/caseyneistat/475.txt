I almost forgot the camera
we're at lunch right now
we're somewhere in Beverly Hills it's
Candace and me and her mother and we're
going shopping there are a few things as
awkward as logging in the bathroom and
somebody walks in and you have a camera
recording and you're talking to yourself
kids we are in Beverly Hills having
lunch with Candace's mother we're going
shopping today I'm not good at shopping
especially two days before Christmas

monument to man's contempt for nature
like one rainstorm will just wash them
off that hill it's now two hours later
we've been driving around for the last
two hours do you feel like we've
accomplished anything Candace
we are finally heading back home
I left the motorcycle on the other side
of town I'm riding the boosted board to
go get the motorcycle I had to bring the
helmet with me so I could ride the
motorcycle so I'm wearing the helmet I
don't know how I'm going to ride the
motorcycle with the boosted board but
I'm sure I can figure it out
I wonder I wonder if that's the first
time anyone's ever transported a boosted
board on a motorcycle before what the
rainbow on the roller coaster
Kenneth and I got in a date we left the
baby with a granny and wait do we know
we're going

to do it yeah

chocolate chip cookies well we ate them
all but they were amazing and then
Candace asked for more free chocolate
chip cookies let's go are you eating
