Hey
this is the New World Trade Center
oculus situation I've never been down
here it is insane it looks like a set
out of Star Wars today's episode begins
earlier this morning 7:00 a.m. I was on
a walk with Francine
so here's the deal Candace doesn't get
back from her trip until tomorrow today
it's just Francine and me serious
daddy-daughter time let's go
go get some food Francine
first stop this morning coffee for me
and a muffin for the kid
I got you a blueberry muffin Francine
yeah good
hundred percent of what we're going to
do today lovely day in the city the
world is our oyster
yeah got him with coffee we got dressed
now we're headed to the park I guess I
never really know what to do with the
kid cuz we can't go more than like one
hour from the house cuz she has to have
her naps and she needs snacks and you
gotta change her diaper so like she was
a park we like to go to Whole Foods we
like to what else we like to do Oh
playing the fountains
Burn Center here I see you
go home and have a nap Elmo helps us get
through lunch
franciene is stretching her legs while
we wait for our lunch to come we're in
the lobby of the hotel next door that's
a pancake
that's sugar look
I would say that was a moderately to
highly successful lunch pick now it's
nap time gets tired kids in the crib
down for the nap now her afternoon nap
usually lasts like two and a half three
hours she sleeps a lot she's like her
mother now Candace has a babysitter
coming this afternoon to sit here while
the baby sleeps she thought I might have
some work to get done I really want to
go to work so not sure what to do this
afternoon I really only have like three
people that I ever hang out in this
world and that's Owen Candice and
Francine when you text them all the way
I don't I don't know what to do with
myself on a day that's not a workday
those people it does
you
remember when I helped my friend Henry
and rel shoot they're like big Hollywood
movie and like five months ago or
something like that look the movies
called nerve and they actually put me in
the trailer what box it says my name
look that's me
all right well that movie comes out next
week or in a couple of weeks or
something like that they're doing a
press thing tomorrow they asked me to
come do something for it but I haven't
seen the movie so today just for me
they're doing like a private screening
of the movie nerve so that's how I'm
going to spend my free three hours this
afternoon I've been to these kinds of
screenings before they're not as fun as
like actually going to the movies where
you're surrounded by people but you do
feel special because it's like there's
not a lot of people there and you get to
see a movie that should be in the
theaters
I don't know if I'm allowed to bring
someone to this screening but I just
invited someone I got out of the date
the real question is do we get juice
press or go get cupcakes completely off
sugar no pastries
what about candy no pastries no candy no
ice cream but what about vegan cookies I
think they're fine are you doing get the
same person bye-bye
