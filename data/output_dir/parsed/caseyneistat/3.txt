I need a can of tuna for breakfast
almost seven days a week just like
Cheerios but with no milk and instead of
Cheerios tuna
so I've got something so check this out
this is the box where I keep my snacks
my healthy snacks to the studio this is
the box that this is the box that came
with from like DJI with some drone parts
in it or something and it makes the DJI
drone sound okay speaking of drones I
there was this drone that I read about
in the New York Times and it's like this
crash proof drones with it's like this
crash proof drone that's supposed to the
drone of the future it's not out yet
these MIT grads made it they gave me one
they gave me one to review it looks
insane look at this thing it looks
outrageous I'm dying to test it but but
it's been grey and rainy every day this
week in New York City I don't think it's
fair to test a drone when it's grey
outside I've done it before but like
when this city's great there's no like
texture and there's no depth it just
doesn't make the image off of these
things look good and I don't think
that's fair to the you know if I'm gonna
be testing this thing I'm reviewing it I
want it to be like the best environment
possible so I need better weather and
then I'll test that so ever since dollar
Pizza went out of business
