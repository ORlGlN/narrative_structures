it's super early in Marfa Texas I'm
finishing my vlog from yesterday I just
want to show you my computer so in
yesterday's vlog I accidentally smashed
this computer the crack happened right
there but this like broken part keeps
getting bigger and bigger and reducing
the usable screen size smaller and
smaller so I lowered my resolution and
minimized final cut so I have like a
proper window to edit in but this
encroachment just keep getting more and
more and more so soon I'm going to be
editing like this I need a new computer
bad but there's nowhere to buy a laptop
in this town
the wedding is at 9:00 a.m. this morning
it's 8:31 right now feeling pretty good
about it
Candice was supposed to come and leave
the baby with her mother in Houston she
kind of decided last minute that she
couldn't leave the baby so I have to
leave here and figure out how to get to
Houston to get her and the baby and get
them back to New York so that's like a
stress that exists in the back of my
head as I go to this wedding
there's no shuttle and I didn't get a
rental car so I'm going to skateboard to
the wedding awesome car because how else
would I get there really I couldn't ride
with these guys

school doesn't let's keep what looks
like a tour next to it taking the long
way to the party thing but this road is
great for skating
Border Patrol I think the wedding this
afternoon is like a hula-hoop
competition some sort of golf
competition what else 20 hour - sack
jumping yeah it's like field day in
sixth grade
it's whoever can hit the golf ball the
furthest we put duct tape on the golf
ball so people wouldn't hit those cars
over there worried where you are here we
go there's an event this afternoon the
egg toss Clinton I think we can win it
we're hedging our bets by practicing
back here while everyone else is
distracted with golf ready ready
when you got it's a good egg
fix you got to get egg yeah this is the
hard-boiled one earlier for this size
starts about to begin feeling bullish
this is it
we're just about to start we're
literally the first people disqualified
the very first people disqualified
that's the groom's mom this is the
20-yard dash

you man that's the level of commitment I
brought to the sack race wedding games

events I took third in the sack race
plant took third the sack race so now we
have a few hours before the wedding
dinner events this is a long day

thing

gigantic hill flipping yo-yo for a while
I have a pretty wild time-lapse going on
right here how you doing
later quit all right I just slept for a
couple of hours feel refreshed going to
the party one of the themes is
fluorescent colors or something like
that I really didn't do a very good job
preparing for this party but I think
