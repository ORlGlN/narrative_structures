friend Sam they got one in Assizes truck

building here yeah good luck on Sunday

bye again why is my dad getting sir I
think he's looking at your multi
some sort of issue with my bag secure
he's given another once-over that was
the most lovely polite kind TSA agent
I've ever interacted with having that my
bags checked was a borderline pleasure
this airport has the best food and the
most expensive food of any airport
nope that's it thank you what he does is
my lunch and two drinks were 40 dollars
and forty cents forty dollars and forty
cents alright time to catch the flight
it's so much work to do but Emma's gonna
sleep on this flight pretty exhausted
hey zero okay see that's man put on a
meeting well normally it's like a fist
fight for me to board first that guy
called my name nobody even behind me oh
yeah I'm great how are you yeah
sometimes and they let me on this early
actually feel guilty oh they're like
still working and prepping the plane
look
there is still not another person on
this entire plane not one other person
just me and the crew okay no one no one
all right just checking back in still no
one else now I'm sitting down and
there's no one else on the plane
my 10 minutes don't know what pick up
someone here comes somebody
I'm no longer alone
all right I got my shorts on and we go
to sleep and wake up in New York City
let's do a walk Eric's time community
airport the five years nine ten
your charger which manifested a salon
thank you yours
I woke up this morning at 3:00 a.m. in
San Francisco I was exhausted right on
the point I didn't sleep for one second
they had a really good movie selection
by the way the main reason why I keep a
skateboard with me is to get through JFK
Airport it's probably an honest mile of
walking to get from the plane to a car
in escape work just makes getting
through the airport so much more
efficient
it is positively warmer in New York City
than it was in San Francisco its
February that is scary for a lot of
reasons yeah you Boris okay hello how
are you I'm good thank you very much
this is like my 10th uber of the day you
see where I'm going there
all right the baby's asleep so I have to
stop recording before I go inside but I
went to San Francisco and back
that's like 7,000 miles of family in 36
hours that's amazing
