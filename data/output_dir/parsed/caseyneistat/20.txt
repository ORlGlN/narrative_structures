but you are going to the hotel in Dubai
Mall right hello
what does that say it's midnight I just
got to Dubai I'm not sure what's
happening what's happening I think we
are fighting over you right now they're
fighting over me right now
thank you for every boat that's it
my Dubai trip begins now first little
sleep like you
the city of Dubai is absolute madness
hadrian sir feels like the city of the
future it makes New York City feel
antiquated old when you're here you
spend a lot of time in cars hey how far
ever drive is this
I am about to speak here and apparently
His Highness Sheikh Mansour is gonna be
attending your session he is the son of
the ruler of Dubai
make some noise that legend the man
himself is coming up next on stage Daisy
how they give a shoot is this how many
people one photographer videographer
hair makeup for our directors there and
I think we had a sand border we have a
sand sled as well
I'm gonna put on my costume now
where do we begin hair and makeup first
make me beautiful oh my good
we're at the doom so he just says like
20 shots for I was flying off the ridge
and then crashing down the sand dune
let me show me your cellphone footage of
me flipping a lot of fun but it really
takes a take a beating doing that
had I come out good I really like these
way to close up shots
so we're just about done with the shoot
went pretty well I did some sand
boarding and I like jumped off of the
ridge and I rolled down the sand and I
wore like a dozen different suits I'm
just telling this because I see this
fancy Maserati SUV right here completely
stuck in the sand one hundred percent
let's have a look they're literally
trying to dig the sand out from under
the tires is that funny anyway
all right last shoot of the day last
shot of the day this is for the cover
what are we doing here oh it looks like
my Q&A setup ready
feel good yeah we got it
that's a wrap on the shoot nice work
team
I have head to toe covered in sand look
at sand in my ears in my hair bye guys
yes yeah such an awesome day take care
guys
well that was my trip to Dubai great
trip yeah I didn't go jet skiing it's
like swimming a gigantic cappuccino and
the water is so hot
didn't raise any Lambos
get dragged behind a Lambo 3 2 1 stop I
didn't go into our skiing this is
without a doubt the best ski mountain
I've ever been on in the shopping mall

great to be back in this city Thank You
