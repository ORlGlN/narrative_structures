Oh
weird wasn't it
maybe didn't like your Invisalign
so you think that was just a bad egg I
think he was mad at me because I
believed
because it's like as the flow cries I'm
in it away but then they have to go you
know you just said as a flow cries today
yeah it's as a crow flies
flows don't cry Candice I've not copy at
today's vlog is a mission a rescue and
recovery mission how about someone who
likes to set myself up for failure but I
do think I need to be honest here I'm
not expecting this to be a successful
rescue mission but that's not enough for
reason for me not to try so I'm gonna
give it my best shot
yesterday I left a drone on a rooftop
today going to try and go and reclaim it
there are a lot of ways this can play
out to gain access to the roof I can try
to get to the interior of the buildings
climb up one of the interior fire
escapes gain access that way or I can
try to go into one of these buildings
then just go up the inside of the
building
both have inherent risks both probably
count as trespassing right now I'm
surveying the block I don't see any
clear means to access the roof yet now
there is a construction site here hey
doing
or not judging by the look of that
security man
I just snuck into a building there is a
delivery man coming out of this building
and I just trying to blocked in that's
right
I think it's on the roof of this
building
I couldn't get any higher than the
second floor
no that's the wrong building it's on the
roof of this building
that's a rooftop it's right there
there's a hardware store over here maybe
I can sneak out through the back of the
hardware store how you doing they don't
have roof access from here let's lean in
the right building
there she is the drone is still there
the drone is still on the rooftop I can
see it just behind me I can also see
there's no way I'm getting on that roof
it's all residential buildings they're
all highly secured I can't go to an
adjacent building and climb over there's
no access I need an entirely new
approach
this is a wildly different approach this
is a high-risk recovery attempt but I
don't know what other options are left
I've got 900 feet of industrial twine
at the end of that nine hundred feet of
twine I've got this grappling hook that
I shaped out of baling wire now I can
think of quite a few things that could
go wrong in this scenario but the one
that I'm most worried about is after I
hook it and I'm pulling it up the 300
feet if and when it falls
that's goodnight that is lights out
that's doom
all right see how this goes
lowering the grappling hook okay we got
contact
is much further down than expected pull
up close I'm close I got to swing it out
swing it out come on very close I touch
the blade and drop hook
I think I've got it I think I've got it
don't touch the building goes into the
building got another 100 120 feet to go
come on you're almost home
nice and easy I can see the drone I can
see the drone so close
it's right there
you
I got it
that is mission accomplished
we
