largest port in the America no the one
over there is the largest port in the
Americas oh that's the largest port in
America that's the largest port in the
Americas that's our tour guide said
going for a quick run here in Cuba if
ever there's a good reason to break my
rule of no filming while running it's
been in Cuba so I will be filming this
run I am 3 and a half miles into this
run I grossly underestimated the power
of the Cubans son my whole run out was
along the water is pretty amazing
did you go beautiful day out there
Candace are you ready to wake up
check out these dudes painting we have
the tech conference today which is why
we're here and then there's a bunch of
other like and there's a bunch of other
touristy things that have been planned
for us today
I think Candace wants to escape and do
our own thing at some point in time did
you figure anything out yeah but can I
wait to ask about the converters we were
coffee he is better than my Spanish
where's your resident Kate for breakfast
ah but not okay take it I literally just
said to Candice that since we got to
Cuba to the first time in memory where
nobody stopped and asked me for her
selfie didn't last long

bike taxi guy for a ride to we're
