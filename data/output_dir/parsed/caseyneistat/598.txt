silly string maybe balloons should you
get balloons

nice night
this thing has never been driven this
much is this the corn we ate for dinner
I actually think this is just field corn
and they actually just feed up like cows
and stuff your vlogs on YouTube do a
million and a half views I think a
millions a safe number million a half's
like a good ball that's that's like
that's crazy
what do you attributed to because I know
my audience cares about this stuff
because a lot of aspiring new youtubers
watch this channel I would say for me
it's the consistency's huge because this
is huge and also you know I I motivate
my viewers and I believe in positive
energies and I've copied everything
you've ever done so it's made me the
bigger youtuber basically no I will say
if I get a million views on vlogs you're
gonna it's safe to know that you're
gonna be pulling to mental on a blog
soon you started with prank videos yeah
yeah well sketch comedy I failed
miserably I started with sketch for a
year and it didn't work
nice I was terrible but they're still on
my channel they're embarrassing I should
probably delete a currently and
your background
comedy film making do you have any
background in the industry nothing
completely self-taught in fact a factory
worker for 12 years and how long it even
YouTube in I think five years
successfully knows maybe times line six
years maybe six years
that's the samurai but one piece of
advice for young people that want to get
into the YouTube game man this is a
tough one huh
I always push originality be original
there's no reason to be the next guy
he's already doing it be you like that's
the best advice I can think of we could
definitely say sir I have literally shy
to message you to see if you ever wanted
to get together throw that outward
making friends and wall bar get one job
we don't need the suitcase all right
take care now
well that went well now um give Casey a
little launch in the GTR what what's a
lot what are you doing here so the car
has a little launch sequence we can push
a couple buttons and it basically takes
the RPMs up and then you just released
ready
alright I'm gonna I'm gonna end this
blog here right here right here go check
out Roman Channel I'm gonna link it
below thanks guys he's gonna post his
day that's the same day as this day but
from his perspective my shot is cool
probably but but we'll get five times
the views of this so you can see what it
actually takes to do a million and a
half to use a day compliment of Roman
Atwood thank you dude towards me awesome
yeah tomorrow's gonna be fun
