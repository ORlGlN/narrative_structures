driver was like turning left and there
was another car right there and the
cabbie saw me he just thought he could
intimidate me by like forcing me to jam
on the brakes and I didn't I just run
right into him because it's not going to
damage my bike but it definitely damages
his car and then I was sort of stuck
there sandwiched between a car and a
taxi but I banged on his window and he
like smiled at me like an apple and
