awesome I've seen a little we're gonna
make an error I'm gonna make an airplane
video today so yeah this will be a
comprehensive review of Qatar Airways
business class experience
now I do want to say that this video is
not an ad I wasn't paid or hired by this
company to make it but the flight
attendants didn't recognize me last time
I made one of these videos and they're
being extra nice to me so maybe take
that into consideration let's begin by
having a look at the amenities kit now
in addition the amenities kid I was also
given some pajamas I don't need for
jobless immersion wearing pajamas but I
feel like because of this video I should
at least try them on
from a comfort perspective cannot attend
home run from a style perspective
I would find a little bit of color or
maybe like a big fat supreme logo but
I put my clothes back on
better this slides like 11 and a half
hours so the entertainment system is
very important
looks like about a 20 inch screen or
something remote here that sort of looks
like an iPhone they have these cameras
on the outside of the plane and you can
see what's around you
that's pretty cool it's like I put a
GoPro up there or something
impressive bar looking area behind me
here I don't know what this area is for
I always find planes to be really
crowded I like having a little space
where I can stretch out maybe do a
little exercise get the blood flowing in
my legs again so
this feels good what are they our planes
have Chin's
I mean if they can put showers and
bars and lounges and airplanes we can't
to put a gym on it here business class
menu now one thing the lady explained to
me is that I can order whatever I want
whatever I want there is into mealtime
so a lot of options here can I have the
pancakes and smoked salmon yep perfect
how about a drink before that make some
smoothie eat some fresh orange juice
I'd like the smoothie please you know or
just mix it up for me so I trust your
judgment very excited about this
whatever coffee we have four coffees you
like a cappuccino yeah but you know a
lot of days espressos decaffeinated
can I have a cappuccino please
like a restaurant where's this agency
right thank you best thing so far is the
cappuccino but the food hasn't come you
see I'm not the only one who does that
sir
I'm not the only one who exercises on
airframes the quad deep squat my foods
here thank you
right second course here this hasn't
even my lunch yet I really know what
these things are like that I also know
remember we're in the soup but they
brought me soup in peace
good that's the core nineteen weeks
thank you salmon scrambled eggs the
salmon has caviar on it she's making my
seat into a bed now I'm gonna go to
sleep the bathroom's here they're just
kind of like regular airplane bathrooms
but the lighting in the mirror is sort
of a nice touch that and the day also
unlimited toothbrush and toothpaste it's
a nice gesture body mist kind of smells
like an airplane bathroom and like all
they're playing bathrooms it does serve
as a nice place to go when you need a
little alone time all right
tours of this nation doorman
International Airport where wisdom in
the white earlier well I guess that
concludes my comprehensive review of
Qatar Airways
the verdict for Qatar Airways - thumbs
up sailor
Oh sailor sailor
