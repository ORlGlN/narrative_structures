that on purpose to test our marriage
what do you think did we win
we just went the last how long 45
minutes tearing the entire car apart
looking for the car key because
somewhere between unlocking the car and
getting into the car I lost it and ruin
as far as the call came this is mom and
tell her to come pick us up an hour away
who's it hour-and-a-half way and listen
to this brilliance her mother said take
all the bags out of the trunk and put
them in the front of the car and press
the start button and that's what we did
and the car started and then Candace
found the key right where I lost it
which is inside of my camera gear bag
somehow I got in there I think it was an
act of God like God
the god of lost car keys
Ron Chapman speak right now which is a
road that goes along the edge of this
gigantic cliff into the ocean on one
side it's absolutely incredible
sorry that took so long
to drop the baby off at home now run a
parking garage because we're going to
try and get a present for Candace's mom
