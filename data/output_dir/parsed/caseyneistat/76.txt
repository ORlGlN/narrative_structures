summer is the season in between spring
and Paul it occurs when the Earth on its
axis tilts the direction of the Sun
resulting in longer hotter days this
summer is 93 days 15 hours 38 minutes
long plumber in short summer is special
and today is the very first day of
summer in honor of making the most out
of summer this video is going to be me
trying to live out a stupid teenage
fantasy it starts with some ridiculous
hotel in the South of France the hotel
has an amazing shower you can tell
everything you need to know about a
hotel by its shower it also involves
room service lots of room service the
costars my friend jet bracelet there was
this fantasy car but this this is nice
but this wasn't it
so let's have that far a sure that the
problem with our driver's licenses
because neither our tablets so we had to
get this car instead oh alright back to
the video on the left school system
or sanity it's something like James Bond
jay-z but again car wasn't right it's
cut sorry for the interruption we're
taking this car back we're losing this
car were going to drop the whole car
seems hard decision it's not matching
the vibe that we're going
the power back in play we got we got the
way we got pile with the hair
ah neck goes Hawking
I spend the rest of the year waiting for
and wanting summer summers always been a
time when I'm in a bathing suit all day
kind of
you look like trying to dork
summers always been magical it's never
been like this but I've always imagined
something like that
that's all you know what a guy can dream
you and Jess here too close and the
girls are too far
Tyla come on I mean this is a hard shoot
case I don't know how we're gonna make
it this is my favorite favorite part of
the bluffs and thus far yeah we had a
huge boat other think we should make a
video like this unless you had a drug
database it's the south of France would
you expect oh come on this is my
childhood fantasy
just go with it we've got a big magician
on the scale of one to throwing up on
closes do we move we get moving
now I'll be the first to recognize this
is not the most original fantasy in the
world I mean look at us we're like want
to be rock stars who just got our first
advance but that's summer I think summer
is the world reminding us to get outside
and live a little
here your daughter now
it's not necessarily about realizing
absurd sounds in addition but it is
about having fun and being free to play
and enjoying every damn minute
my twelve year old self smells a lot to
learn but summer leave it without a
crazy hotel room a big boat jet skis or
that car we never drove it's about the
spirit
it's about being a lie you've got to
make the most out of every moment don't
worry you can sleep in September the
time it's only 10:00 p.m. come on come
on Casey sister make the most of every
second what are you doing downtown
everything longhand I'm ready to
get turned up I'm ready Nana
you
you
