all right we're going on a run wishes
luck now I've never used this jogging
stroller I don't know what to expect

yeah when you run with the stroller you
have to be responsible and stop at every
red light that sucks how do you like
running are you like Daddy and you love
it like mommy you don't you love it

the princess requested a tiny quick
snack break so
okay things have things have escalated a
little bit she wanted out of the
stroller we get back in the stroller so

yummy yummy it was a delicious run she
was a good sport all right we made it
like almost seven miles not bad she
started to freak out after about five so
I was happy with what we got is that
exciting for you yeah let's hit it lunch

I always feel bad about the mess that we
leave in Whole Foods and we try to clean
up a little bit but I mean she destroys
that place I feel one the best ever how
