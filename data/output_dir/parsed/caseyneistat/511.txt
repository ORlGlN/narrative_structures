I don't know
they make purple chickens this morning
was one of those mornings where I really
wish I had to fill my run but but I
didn't and I probably ran faster because
of it but a solid like thirteen point
three mile run this morning feel strong
do you think it would be too distracting
to do both mail time and Q&A at the same
time these boxes are piling up I do want
to do mail time but it's Tuesday QA day
I'll pick a couple of boxes okay now we
can be in QA
all right QA here besides filmmaking
what are your other passions or hobbies
running and parenting is parenting a
hobby you love messy this is lovely
Nick asks what's the best part of owning
your own company you know it's not
owning your own company it's working for
yourself that's amazing and I've been
working for myself now I think since I
was 21 or 22 years old it's the sense of
agency or sense of control over your own
like destiny or outcome of your career
my success or my failure depends on me
and me alone I've got no one to blame my
failures on I have no one to attribute
the success to but myself I think these
are lights for my skateboard thank you
there's no button no name yes hey Casey
we're in Murfreesboro and we're actually
in the small animal lab of our high
school and we were just wondering um
what kind of childhood pets did you have
what kind of childhood pets all I ever
wanted was a dog and all we ever had
were cats I liked cats but I prefer cats
in Internet videos and I prefer dogs in
real life because dogs are rational
creatures and cats are just like well
whoa I can't see my name is Chad I've
made you a little package thanks Chad
thanks these sweet bean stickers these
are actually pretty good stickers what
do you miss most from your childhood
there are no consequences for your
actions when you are our child I'm you
like get grounded and make it suspended
or detention but compared to being an
adult where things actually matter when
you're a kid you can do anything and get
away with it it's just like that sense
of recklessness is really amazing I
don't think there's any responsible way
to maintain that as an adult Peter asks
do you have any scars are you crazy
Peter I have more scar tissue than I
have actual skin yes my entire body is
covered in scars and
scars are kind of my favorite tattoos
because a scar much like a tattoo
represents something that happened to
you or experienced and all of my scars
like I'm just looking at my hands like
look at all the scars just on one hand I
mean that's from like fighting a lot
when I was a kid and Jose asks were you
ever bullied in school if so how did you
deal with it
oh yeah I was bullied in school when I
was a kid I was really weird looking at
big ears and I remember like
specifically when I used to wrestle in
the sixth grade I'd have to take the bus
with the seventh and eighth graders and
those guys really gave me a hard time in
the moment like I was as much of a spaz
then as I am now they didn't care how
small it was I just wanted like totally
ate and tried to this is not good advice
but like when I was a kid nozzle and I
was fight I just fight we wanted to send
you some leather swag to put on your
phone and keep your phone looking fly
okay oh no look I have a sitz and you
sent me a cover for a six plus so yeah
thank you I'm gonna get some more
packages did you practice any sports
growing up uh yeah I used to run
cross-country in middle school and then
I played lacrosse
I love lacrosse did people ever say you
were going nowhere by making movies does
it ever made you doubt it people who
have abandoned their dreams and
aspirations will always discourage
others from pursuing theirs you have to
have a blind overwhelming confidence to
chase down your dreams anyways so I
would just hi buying that confidence
when people would discourage me nice box
I'm ready to thank you for all you have
done for me oh that's very sweet from a
fan Jacob Weiss whoa Oh Jacob you are

I live in New York City just order the
food here how do you get in contact with
agencies or film studios if you're not a
studied film mate you know my feelings
on this my feelings on that have always
been you have to do the work do the work
first and if your works good and if
people like your work the film studios
and the agencies will always come to you
don't worry about pursuing others worry
about getting others to pursue you
