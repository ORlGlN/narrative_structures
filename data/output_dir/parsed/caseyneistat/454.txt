today is without a doubt the coldest day
of the year
a little late for my morning meeting not
late yet but I'm about to be late
good morning guys are they here yet
oh yeah it's the way perfect it's four
hours later as in four hours ago I was
just walking through that door I spent
all of those four hours downstairs in
the office doing office see things and I
decided today is not going to be one of
those days where I don't go outside I
packed up a camera grabbing the boosted
board and I'm getting out of here
you go
the officer
it's just so cold it's so cold
you know the cruel irony that is living
in New York City is that in order to
exist here in order to thrive here in
order to live here you have to work and
bust your ass all the time and that
level of work precludes you from
actually embracing this wonderful city
see this beautiful this beautiful woman
right here here have a look her right
there that's Lady Liberty
I've lived in New York City for 15 years
that's this money I've been to the
Statue of Liberty exactly zero times
that's this money and that is true for
so much of this city so when I do get
out that is these little moments it only
just makes me love this city that much
more look where I am right now I'm
standing on top of a picnic table with
absolutely no one around with the most
amazing view of the Statue of Liberty
in downtown Manhattan this place is
amazing
yeah what's it called leaf leaf for that
leaf deck is there you can carve on that
thing yeah lose you the bottom so cool
Oh leaf East no board awesome
I think it's so cool
she was so cold outside that my camera
hand literally froze and I dropped the
camera I'm in this hotel lobby but I
think they're about to throw me out
Wow that
move is that
okay I'm back in the office that was a
very very cold little adventure my
camera batteries froze my cell phone
battery froze and eventually my
skateboard battery all froze they all
stopped working I think this is a
bicycle
you know people send me all kinds of
stuff I never asked for any of this I
always appreciate it
you know as big of a bunker as I am I
don't think I've ever fully assembled a
bike before a switchblade is not the
best tool for cutting zip ties these are
nice
putting the pedal on
all right now I got it from the brakes
front brake
alright I think that's it
thank you for the bite thank you for the
bicycle mango bicycle that's very sweet

go home

good luck man thanks the first
there are there are only a few things in
life that directly contribute to your
day-to-day happiness as much as working
with people being surrounded by people
