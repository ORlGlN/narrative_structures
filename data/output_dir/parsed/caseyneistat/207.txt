if you got it
I arrived in Sydney five and a half
hours ago my first time ever on the
entire continent of Australia and I'm
being picked up here in my hotel in like
one hour to go do rehearsals for the
YouTube event that I'm here for chose
raining this morning when I got here and
now is like sunny and lovely outside so
that I'm gonna try to get out of this
hotel room superfast here in Sydney much
like London they drive under Yetta
remember which side of the road to be on
while skateboarding Sydney Opera House I
feel like that was the only thing on my
list of things to see while here now
that it's been checked off go back to
New York
this is incredible I'm in the Botanical
Garden which is right next to the hotel
everything smells nice it's clean
everybody smiles at you
Australia FTW
train
what do I need to know about Australia
um it's hot
I'll get blue friendly have you got two
days two days go to the beach
what is the Australian policy on boosted
boards no policy the pretty chill let's
write them some fine very very fine okay
do it Casey nicely I'm starts you take
care Casey good it is absurd how
friendly everyone has been thus far if
you make eye contact with strangers in
New York City
you might get cut but here when you make
eye contact and say hello nothing but
smiles
it's 12:55 supposed to be just get one
I'm on time I'm good just have to find
another find the hotel yeah ready yeah
we're at the venue right now where the
event is tomorrow we're doing a bit of
rehearsal jessica here basically
Jessica's job here in Australia is to
babysit me would you say it's a fair
characterization of your
responsibilities while here what to
babysit me yeah so Jessica's our
babysitter
sorry girlfriend great well let's drop
your bag this good not this yeah yeah
this is my night coffee today I brought
smoke to come off of me when I when I
walk on stage
doesn't really stick what kind of does
and this lovely will point cross here is
for you my friend and basically just
stand there yeah I don't like to use
teleprompters because I find it inhibits
my spontaneity so I'm going to use the
teleprompter today just for her so I was
just talking about camera but now I'm
talking to I'm use a teleprompter stay
just for the rehearsal but then tomorrow
in front of the audience no teleprompter
here we go
that rehearsal that I just did that was
it for my our our responsibilities yeah
for today so now we can do it ever we
want the trouble is we don't know what
the hell to do with ourselves Bondi when
it's pronounced Bondi do you want to go
play on those rocks over there okay cool
that's good yeah yeah so this this is
the world-famous Bondi Beach the trouble
is it's currently the offseason it's
like spring right spring ish right now
in Australia so it's not a super
opportune time to be here but we're
going to make the most of it
they make it across this chasm OCO you
got it you got it nice huh
nice fun
leaving the tides coming in are you
stuck
why don't you just jump this little
ravine right here did you just fall
you need help
sorry I abandoned you the gentleman that
drove us here said that it was a little
too cold to swim but there are people
swimming so I think if it's sunny
tomorrow we're down here it says high
tide came in just like you warned I did
word as you didn't listen
are you into the triggers are you gonna
be able to get across this I don't know
I'm so sorry
yeah that's not gonna be hard to go out
there
Oh fine oh I wouldn't go under there
yeah time this one Jeff how they could
have made that every man for himself
you got it we made it out no Falls no
injuries no wet feet minor minor
injuries and wet feet because she felt
one besides that we completely laid
I want to do is just curl in a ball and
fall asleep somewhere jetlag is kicking
by I think we're going to leave the
beach because I'm just mumbling and
wandering and torturing for Jessica any
ideas what we should do
go eat more candy my gosh go eat some
candy yeah this is our car
we've left him in there for last couple
hours how you doing did we miss anything
no no I think so okay goodbye
I had fun at the beach with you I'm
struggling I'm struggling
Jessica warned me she warned me about
what this jet lag would be like ah I
don't get jet lag I travel all the time
I never get tired and the only way I can
describe what it's like right now is
sheer pain because Australia and New
York are like opposite sides of the
earth so it's complete 180
I'm on the roof of the hotel thought it
might wake me up a little to come up
here it's pretty incredible look this
view my goal was to make it to seven
o'clock before I went to bed to try to
combat the jetlag
it is currently like 650 which I
consider a win so with that this
concludes day one of my Australia trip
tomorrow a prompter today just for
rehearsal I was just talking to my
camera but now I'm talking to I'm use a
teleprompter
okay you can make me loud now am i loud
have an out now super loud voice of God
