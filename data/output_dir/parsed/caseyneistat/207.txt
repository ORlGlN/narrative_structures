afternoon I have a semi exciting morning
plan you want to miss this place mostly
I'm going to miss this breakfast in the
scenery and loving to miss this place no
I'm only here for a couple of days the
reason why I came over is just for like
a one hour commitment but to make a trip
like you know worth it for me YouTube
organised all these great events I
missed all of them because I missed my
flight and was stuck in Dubai today they
organized something kind of special for
me hello see I supposed to be on a
seaplane but I'm here in the office and
there doesn't seem to be anybody oh here

than just going back to the hotel I had
Richard in the Tesla dump me here
somewhere in town with the boosted board
I got a I got to get a little bit more
Sidney in before I go no way thank you I
just seen your compassion photos like I
recognize that thing I get see didn't me
then I've been on a bit of a tear to get
new sneakers I met a guy at a different
seeker store and he sent me down this
alleyway garbage fancy store
this is a crazy store I'm Casey hello hi

I didn't get any shoes because they were
too weird with that store and those
girls were awesome
found my way down to this park it's like
on the other side of where the city
where I run to the other side it takes
like three days to adjust the jetlag it
takes like three days like get over all
the stress of problem get excited this
is my third day that I'm I'm like most
excited to be here it's also the day
that I'm leaving
the bets in the rocks thanks Mike
thank you very much
solid lunch at the I gotta head back to
the hotel now
start packing doing the not fun stuff
what do we have here dear Casey dear
Casey we hope you had a wonderful time
at brandcast we couldn't let you leave
without an iconic Australian gift from
the Intercontinental magic to take home
classic tom-toms it's been a pleasure
Nicole and the team
dear Nicole on the team at the
Intercontinental Sydney I have had a
lovely stay in thank you to this basket
with slippers and Vegemite pajamas for
the airplane event in my eye mask for
the airplane and a baby koala bear and
another jar of and all this other stuff
you Australian sure to know how to make
a guy feel special I really can't feel
bad about spending just a little bit of
my afternoon napping being on a plane
for two days straight without having a
proper bed to lay down and it's
punishing so just I'm just taking a
little bit of advantage of this
opportunity
I've got an hour left before I have to
leave this hotel room considering it
looks like somebody tried to rob the
place
I should probably spend this time
packing but again I gotta sit on a plane
I'm getting a getting a run in so pretty
Sydney Sydney you will be missed
51 minutes until the car picks me up at
the hotel to go to the airport I think
that this has to be my turnaround point
well it was a good run
I'm glad I got it in now I have exactly
12 minutes before a car picks me up
downstairs and somehow I gotta pack up
all this mess
thank you so much regarding Fisher
almost uh I lost it arm there
hey guys I'm like a little big morning
there's multiple outside
I'm gonna go say hi to them cool can you
I'm happy to tell me the mines better
food security the sport a lot of spooky
outside better
Emirates is giving a really hard time
about the boosted board they wouldn't
let me check it and they said Security's
going to take it from me so that's my
skateboard yeah no problem
cool
getting a supervisor this is it
they're going to take it
you you can take it from anything that
is sporting Congo
there's nothing else I can do
one
the back
I would just make me sad Australia what
the I travel around the world I think
every single month if the policy is no
boosted words I understand
then no boosted words if the policy is
booster boards are great I prefer that
but you can't have this ill-defined
malleable flexible otherwise it just
doesn't seem fair like the burden of
information it shouldn't fall on us like
get your together I mean I'm not
mad I'm just
I'm mad he did I got a question is there
any way I can sit on the pontoon while
we fire you can give it a guy you have
to hold on really tight I've got a great
grip
all right
uhh
