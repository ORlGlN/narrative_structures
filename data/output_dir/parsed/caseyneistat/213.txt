as always family days but even on family
days I try to sneak out when Candice
goes for coffee get a quick run in
that's what I'm doing right now quick
though five maybe six miles I just read
all the way back to get the camera I
don't know why I wore a long-sleeve
shirt today
it is like the thickest sweatiest air
out there get a shower and then I'm
going to take the baby after lunch
coming over here
he's getting mac and cheese I'm getting
chicken Oh are we need to do something
for your dad today is Candace's dad's
birthday

Roxy this is the restaurant it's right
next to our old apartment we used to
come here all the time we don't come
here as often but it's great there so
this is weekend 2 of this new initiative
we're in on Saturday afternoons Candace
and I get a babysitter for two hours for
three hours or something so we can have
a date last week for our date we came
here and I worked and this week for the
date honey we have to do something you
go to the movies don't you want this yes
okay Wow look at this 111 2006 this is
what we fell in love with yeah so when I
first met Candace one has film in it
whoa that's scary
maybe I should develop and develop I
first met Candace it was like pre know
they had this camera is what you had
they had digital cameras I just like
there's something really cool about this
camera in particular if you're into film
at all it just takes the best pictures
it was all I use when we first started
dating I don't even have this phone
number anymore
let me see nine one seven seven five six
nine three two eight nine eight two
eight yeah
not wrong Center
put you in the video then what's your
son's name
Matthew oh hey Matthew what's up your
dad's a really nice guy
Thank You Katie an extra bowl on the
side and some extra lemons oh yeah
on top of this being the best Vietnamese
restaurant in the city they'll set the
best air conditioning and it's obscenely
fast I know I haven't been here for a
while they literally got Candice's food
out before my soda even showed up thank
you
what is an ice cream roll it's just like
the picture the ice cream rolled into a
roll it's not like the pastry magician
or getting ice cream rolls I don't know
what an ice cream rolls like that's
disappointing no ice cream rolls because
they only take cash yeah I was really
excited what country did I hear was
going cash cashless do you know the one
told me to get out of his car you nubert
Rock yes you're the head can you turn
right on Spring Street but his map said
do a different way I reported him they
said they can't do anything because
they're independent contractors I don't
know
don't let him be a contractor that it
was I was shaking I was like oh my god
you're kidding me right now wish I had
been in that car with you well so then I
was like he went slammed the door but I
did not instigate which normally I do
and not at that time I did not I said
Jordan moved would he gonna go see we're
gonna see the the one about the plane
about captain Sully yeah Clint Eastwood
directed take care of sir that was like
a real New York City taxi driver he had
the Brooklyn accent the whole thing
we started three minutes ago but at this
theater you choose your seats ahead of
time so no pressure got previews and
stuff serious AC and is dead
the prophecy is fiction prophecy whoa
this movie either has the reclining seat
all right we're seeing the captain Sully
movie expected this is the cup boyfriend
what
say what you want about Clint Eastwood
the guy knows how to tell a story and I
do think Tom Hanks is one of the
greatest actors Berg he's unbelievable
what are you disagree we were only rock
he really is that good that's two thumbs
you know was that your nose yeah that's
two thumbs up for a pickup a pickup shot
in movie making a pickup shot is when
you need to get another shot or you
missed a shot so you have to go back at
a later date and shoot a pickup shot
that video that I shot yesterday with my
friend Carly we have to shoot a pickup
shot tonight it's now seven o'clock and
I'm leaving the house to go like to go
work
it's only at the end of the summer when
you get these purple sunsets like this
also for what it's worth the Ken this
this building right here is brand new in
the penthouse the top floor costs 50
million dollars
Candace showed it to me on the Internet
yeah okay see take care
I'm meeting up with the production team
first I think I'm meeting them here and
then we're here shoot the scene it's a
quick scene but it's like once you get
all the balls moving and everybody in
the right is like ends up taking two
hours and I know that's what's gonna
take tonight yo yo yo what's up yeah
no surprise at all it's very simple like
five second shot is vastly more
complicated than we anticipated
Brett is like building a light out of a
binder out of a binder and a flashlight
is that work it works you keep getting
yelled at by security we're gonna get
the shot but it's like the most simple
shot it's the most complicated thing to
get
all right Brett so we got to be
johnny-on-the-spot quick with this
because we're only going to take or two
before they play tell us we can't shoot
here that light looks great pull it back
just a little bit further off the binder
to defuse it there you go just like that
yeah all right we got the shot at the
hotel but only with security like
yelling us over and over and over
because we didn't have permission to
shoot there who's mostly on the side you
ever follow the rules my distinct
remission gums you up so much what were
you like in grade school did you in
trouble
thrown out did you yeah no no but this
is it I'm just driving with you right
now for moral support thank you
yeah this is a rapper leave me and says
nice hanging out it's funny yeah this is
a good excuse we should do this mom we
should make video see you later are ya
by the way I'm using my phone as a light
right now that's why we're so long with
this is probably costing her best Casey
nice that impression like that good boy
what he's staying with you
remember I was on my way to that
shooting I was like this is a
five-second shoot and it's going to take
two hours it didn't take two hours it
took three and a half but we got
everything we needed there's a big
success now it's late and I still go to
the studio because I left my backpack
there yesterday
I'm so seldom if ever in this studio at
night this is a really rare experience
it's dark in here
I'm just in here because I keep
forgetting my backpack which has all my
important stuff at it like this lens I
don't know if you realize how little of
this blob is actually filmed at night
it's because I get home at 6:00 every
day and that's it family time bedtime
I'm not a big nightlife guy around here
we used to live right there do you miss
it
a little bit a little bit no just
nostalgic but I'm not like any wish they
lived there
boo taxi
