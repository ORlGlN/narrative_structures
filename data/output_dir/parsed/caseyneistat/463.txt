winter is here winter has arrived
that was 15 miles I hope if I was loved
this morning I can't feel this hand
back in the office but today is not an
office day I'm just here to grab two
things number one number two okay now I
go and then I come back and get the
camera now I actually go
Candace and I are trying out a new
babysitter today so she's saying the
afternoon to go to work and I'm going to
take the afternoon to run around the
city and catch up on some time lapses I
know the ones in the recent blocks are
really sucked I'm sorry I haven't had
any fresh ones in a while
hi I'm literally obsessed with you I
just said mr. Darcy I'm Casey I can see
much weirder when I write the people I'm
just talking like my camera top it off
inside good luck with everything thank
you bye
I'm feeling low
I'm feeling ambitious today so I'm gonna
head out to Brooklyn so I can shoot the
Manhattan skyline from across the river
it's a great idea except for the range
on the boosted board is about it up to
get me to Brooklyn
but not enough to give me home so when
I'm over that I figure out how to charge
this thing
this is the Williamsburg Bridge and it
has these metal like that connect each
part of the each part of the bridge I
skateboarding down this bridge 11 years
ago and broke my shoulder because of
these damn metal plates ready
you
I was skating down the wings Berg bridge
and my skateboard went right into that
hole and completely stopped moving and
then I had to run it out
all right look at this view this has got
to be one of the most beautiful
locations to see the skyline anywhere
you know rich roll who is that tall
super cool looking guy one of the height
within la he and I were having the LA
versus New York conversation and he said
something prophetic to me he said when
you're in LA you don't have a story hit
you in the face when you walk outside
your door like you do in New York City
and I think that just sums it up so much
for me it's like there's just so much
life happening everywhere all the time
in this city and I just like thrive on
that is so hold right where I'm standing
right now and having standing for the
last 15 minutes okay words cannot
describe the cold of currently feeling
I can barely grip the controller it's
not that back hold on it's probably like
30 or so that's been standing the cold
is not moving for the last
two hours all right tiny problem these
five lights here represent how much
power is left five lights is full power
blinking one light means there's no
power left right
no no no no hello
I asked if I could plug this in because
being polite and I do not the bearded
hipster behind the counter was like it's
our policy not to let people use our
plugs that's the most
I'm getting typhoon I'm not hungry
I just Satan Francine I'm getting Thai
food because I knew they wouldn't give
me a hard time for charging my
skateboard
you
yeah thank you I just want to give tae
tae a quick plug those women in there
were lovely my lunch was delicious only
cost $13 and they had no problem with me
charging my boosted board so if you ever
in Williamsburg maybe you want to check
that place out instead of going to buy
an overpriced coffee for me
Oh
on three lots of poem it's both
literally and figuratively downhill from
here
I don't even go on for like two and a
half hours but I feel like Odysseus
right now I shot some of the better time
lapses I've ever shot but I can't put
them on this blog because I need to save
them for future vlogs but I will show
you one this is my favorite
it's like uber for it's like uber for
when you mess when you need new Wonder
underwear
