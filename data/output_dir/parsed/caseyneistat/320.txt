because I won't look from all those
people but that's just the way it goes
we're in London now because our flight
was like five hours late yesterday I
missed my connection so
not sure what to do here well I thank
you
you
and literally dump everything out of my
bag and they still rejected it
Wow and this is my new play so now I
miss the to play
I going to spend the day in the airport
that's okay you got great snacks here as
much as I'll bitch about this Airport
there's a lovely woman that just helped
me happy I'm okay
I'm gonna get on the flight that's me
I take it back this Airport and everyone
in it they wouldn't let me out in the
flight
all right I found another lovely woman
who helped situate me I'm now fine
Amsterdam but in three hours so I'm
stuck here for the afternoon
all right so I've had like four
chocolate croissants calm down a little
I no longer want to leave and fly back
to New York just going to relax I'm
going to take a shower I'm gonna go to
Amsterdam I'm going to do the talk that
I was brought here to do everything is
going to be great
in the future after the water wars and
we all get one shower this is what I
imagine the shower rooms will look like
it's like a tiny is nicer than prison
but it's like a tiny pod that everything
is plastic everything's a little bit
gross and and this is the shower it is
truly remarkable how much better a
shower can make you feel but seriously
what the fuck is wrong with this airline
happen to add me missing two flights
booked
the food here at the wild is pretty
legit it's British which is disgusting
it's pretty legit three coffee machines
which I always appreciated decent soda
options with appropriately sized cans
cheese fruit soup or coffee machine
sweets sandwiches booze and a bunch of
weird British hot food as far as lounges
yes
that's pretty okay
I'm
let's stop the Amsterdam
thank you very much
right I am now
that that was insane two days with a
problem the real question is did my
boosted board make it here
this guy's got a pretty sweet scooter
no sign of the boosted word no sign yet
of the boosted would I remain optimistic
cannot believe the boosted board made it
alright that's it now you can leave the
airport
right on cue
now stand pretty cool
all the taxis here are Tesla's are you
kidding me that's also communicating it
in nice way I think then in the
beginning I like that right all right
just got to Amsterdam and these guys
here pick me up at the airport you know
to ignore you know and where are we
going right now
I even looks like a lake or something
the pond it's part of the outside Irving
offense but we're going wakeboarding
proper right now yes it's freezing
outside I just got off the plane we're
not even going to hotel we're just going
straight to go wait for me wakeboarding
we have really narrow window I should
just it apparently my mother hey leave a
theater feeling yeah Bob Duncan
are we good yep there was this idea for
a stunt of me like wakeboarding through
the really narrow canals of Amsterdam
I wasn't sure they were serious about it
but I've just never wakeboarded before
so that's a bit of a liability so we're
here at this place so I can actually
practice wakeboarding but it's freezing
out and nobody's here can see us nice
DVD you all right again I'm a little in
the dark on everything it's going on
here I think that we're going into where
we wouldn't be in wakeboarding
I literally just got the plane I didn't
go to the hotel and shower to haven't
changed
it's cold and it's dark here it's also
7:00 p.m. so so excited alright I think
this is our stop
are you gonna teach me you're gonna be
one teaching me how I'm not me that I've
never done I think I think that's the
professional and that's a professional
over here you're gonna be teaching me
how I think so Casey hey Duncan nice you

wetsuit for me yeah all right you've
