heading into the office right now I have
a photo shoot this morning like a fancy
big deal Photoshop but I'm not a hundred
percent sure I'm allowed to say where
the photo shoot is for am I allowed to
say what this shoot is for strictly
forbidden

that give it away
I think it'll work so I'm gonna have to
pixelate your face don't see Inga vana

gonna go this one tan so this is a good
boutonniere this is very Nucky Thompson
yeah how much you takin I'm gonna just
gonna clean around the edges so you kind
of like look good full photo in I mean
ready yeah
these are serious
like $1,000 really yeah
if you cut air and you use like a $200
scissor versus this you can see a huge
difference you're getting the tuxedo
ready and then we're going to leave and
we're going to do the actual photoshoot
in the street somewhere the rest of the
details have not been figured out yet
but I do know that there's going to be a
skateboard involved and that purple Jeep
that's going to be the chase car that
probably chased me around in and shoot
photos out of the background hit it down
to like Wall Street area to take this
picture there's some test photos now
that's what the situation looks like
it's kind of ridiculous but
we're in Midtown now trying to get the
shop but traffic is really making a
difference see I'm trying to skateboard
up the middle of Fifth Ave with its long
Cameron drivers in Midtown are crazy
I don't know much God you know the
driving in the back of the Jeep like
this through midtown Manhattan is
against the law
oh dude nice to me but let's get you out
here safer let me help you
all right maybe broken ha quite sad your
bike Kumari art yeah just your
handlebars his bikes broken but the more
important thing is that the cyclist
still can happen what he was no I got
him he's not going anywhere I told me
hang out he'll wait take care thank you
take care of him
I think that's it just by the way this
photoshoot started at 10 a.m. it's now
3:15
getting snacks down that I'm going back
to the studio the kid on the bike got
noon ambulance should be okay I've got
his bicycle otherwise we would have to
have left it that idea okay bye guys I
think it went well

years I did not think that would be a
six-hour photo shoot

Internet you seemed kind of somber but
I'm glad to see you seem happy it's a
new chapter let's see the 180 nice
Jessie Jessie do you miss daily vlogging
yes or no because I love the blog right

many years like
six years of daily vlogging he's got
nine million subscribers on that channel
and he just quit what one week ago five
days ago sometimes you got to live your
life not through the camera I don't know
