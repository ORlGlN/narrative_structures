South Africa with a 10 hour layover in
London I'm going to make the best of
that layover where is your safe travel
to your final destination this is a left
I made how about the side and how ill
they chew it up most of the black kids
are brainwashed putting a brother down
to fit in his tux intelligent maybe but
not very bright
I'm living in a world of right this
ain't right trying to do good but all
these bags losing faith in the printer
cuz they want I like
two of my closest friends in the whole
world are in town right now and it's the
hotel I'm not gonna get in touching one
of your guests here ever knows remember
though I don't have no answer here I
just can't understand why this happened
he might try one more yes for me Jessa
first name is next
yeah but your life is like damn
something ain't right
born up in the right way but something
went wrong and this is a sad time the
government is for others
kyouko she's cute I don't think so
in a box so I go right to run for people
to listen to and then the knick cook
gets my from here the house the door so
you can wave your hand side to side and
just ride and glide like the rhythm dog
but it's a new decade 91 I'm here to get
pain bring in the back
even you I take the roof hey jewel
that's been missing on West polishing
know myself cuz it's gotta be done
showing people that I'm not number one
