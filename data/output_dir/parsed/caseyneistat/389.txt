you see Candace out there with the baby
that's her fourth glass of champagne
this is stressful travel first today's
vlog can be very very short I apologize
second whoever sent me this jacket thank
you I think it looks great on me it's
really nice soft third let me just
explain you what's going on
so last night at midnight we got on a
plane that flew us six hours from New
York City to London England where we are
right now we've had a six six hour
layover here then we get back on another
plane and fly 13 hours to Cape Town
South Africa we're doing all of this
with the baby who is like not psyched on
travel and last night things a little
hairy shoes up cry
when she was crying she was screaming
it's kind of a rough night for the baby
weird about 15
then we got here to London Heathrow
Airport
and we got lost or lost in the labyrinth
that is Heathrow Airport and Candice is
navigating then we got trapped in some
weird room we're to push green buttons
to escape there's no way this is the
right word crazy then Candice got in a
fight with I think four different
officials here in the airport
ultimately we made it here to the lounge
which is kind of nice they've delicious
food and now we have two more hours
before we get our next flight it all
starts again also right now I'm using
this old tree which is covered in dust
as a tripod check this out
see there's the camera and it's in a
tree
all right I got to get back in there and
help Candace with a baby we're going to
be divorced by Friday
a kid it's left he's stuck in the
curtains Francine just not leaving the
lounge
Candice picked a fight with literally
every person in there
plane takes off in one hour
all right this is it
we're about to board they let us wait up
here because we have a baby we did it
first ones on the plane family edition
that's the more hematite about are you
ready so I think we'll fall asleep for a
while again to wake up
and this and I move seats four times and
then we're in the back and then this
couple offered us their seats we got
their speeds and now we're sitting at
the very tip like the pointy tip of the
airplane without clothes we are number
brothers point us front of the plane
pilots are above a 747
it's like five in the morning or
something I have no
two hours two and a half hours the
baby's been awake for last ten hours
screen
has passed the diamonds
and feels overly
this is it we land every 20 minutes when
Keith minutes
have to always sit on the left side of
the airplane flying into Cape Town is

windows
Table Mountain
welcome to hate town we not is located
on your handheld electronic devices
okay no rush this is it
we're saying goodbye to this plane also
I will just want to quickly address the
fact that we're sitting in this deluxe
first-class cabin Kansas and I saved up
for like five years with of airline
miles to make this happen
