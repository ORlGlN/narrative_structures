like a Jamaican guy he's a
superintendent next door and every time
I'm out here filming he asked me when
I'm gonna put him on YouTube because he
like is a reggae artist or something and
he just asked me and I was like that's
not it's not going to happen and I think
he was really upset I didn't mean it
like in a kind of way I just meant that
I'm like trying to do something here and
you're preventing me from doing that now
I feel terrible
it does get a little frustrating when
other people expect other people I'm not
going to say anything negative but just
not feel bad alright gonna run the west
side this morning
all I can smell is weed right now it's
7:00 in the morning then all I can smell
is weed who smokes weed outside at 7:00
in the morning run on the west side

peanut butter for dinner feel like crap

awesome going to meet the team for lunch
I didn't join them for lunch because I'm
eating raw vegan today but it's such a
beautiful day out I wanted to go hang
around with the guys so I'm gonna go

stoop somewhere over here

electronic electric unicycle these guys

instruction this you need a Ghana sure I
can write a regular unicycle this thing

extreme caution read manual before use

own there's no way we're doing this

have a helmet
