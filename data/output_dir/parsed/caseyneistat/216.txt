good to be back in New York I always
complain about airports and I want you
to know I'm not biased New York City
airports are some of the worst this car
cost six dollars to borrow number one
I think there's what still one more
okay got my bags time to get out of here
it is breezy and hot and summertime
still here in New York City I miss this
place it's 5:00 p.m. it's rush hour
Google Maps says it's one hour and 12
minutes back to the city that's often
happen don't do drugs I don't have many
addictions in life but um helicopters I
just can't stay away from
frenzy is a school thing at six they
don't have enough time to wait for a car
so I'm going to try to escape work are
really business and like that once a
week at angle MJ thank you goodbye
I'll try go god it's so heavy alright
pusta to don't let me down there's
nothing more fun than taking a
helicopter and escape for home from the
airport boosted board saves the day
again there's no way I would have made
it back if I didn't have that boosted
board I've got seven minutes of shower
then get out of here and that gives me
four minutes see it to Fran teen school
orientation where Candice is there
waiting for me now wish me luck

orientation it was very cute and a
little sad he believes his in school
already I'm so excited
tiny toilets and tiny chairs and tiny
little things that kids have to learn
and play with tiny screwdrivers
franciene lately has been sort of
running wild and the structure that
schools can provide that kid is like the
timing could not be better I promise I
read it I read it you don't read the
stuff I'm the one that goes online
meeting all the time about what to do
Candice learned how to parent on Google

well
