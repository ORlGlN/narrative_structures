flying to Vancouver British Columbia to
hang out this dude named Brad Bryson

recreationally but I thought it was time
for me to start a YouTube channel yeah
that guy I'll link his channel below
anyway he's got helicopters
he's got jet skis icebergs we're doing
all kinds of crazy stuff in Canada but
I'm doing it all in 24 hours so we're
flying out there tonight and then we're
flying back tomorrow night now the
flight is not till later tonight there's
a lot of things to take care of between
now and then plus I have like all this
work stuff that I was supposed to do
today and now I have less time to take
care of it so I've got a pretty chaotic
day that's going to end with me falling
asleep on an airplane on my way to the
icebergs green light
I had to bleep that out of yesterday's
episode and he's in that's all I got
because nothing was confirmed and I
don't like to make promises that I can't
deliver on I didn't mean for it to come
across such like a secret you're not
Oscar I'm not asking where is it you
bought these glasses just for this trip
I bought it yesterday
you're gonna look so cool on icebergs so
these class is on all right I'm gonna go
I'll come back when you win with the
side things I have those really those
appropriate I'm gonna go I'll come back
and get you when I'm done let's say that
I looked it on your neck

the entire shoot is blown if we are you
can always take the train is that crazy
take a train to British Columbia Oh to
JFK oh yeah we guarantee can our I
always take the subway when I'm going
out it's a guarantee
you see this whole trip is sort of
twofold I'm gonna do like my daily
videos my daily uploads but the mission
is to make like one core video that's
why I have this budget so I'd like the
story for that video I think should
start here in New York to do that I'm
going to need some like really quality
drone footage of the city skyline so I'm
on a quick drone mission right now
also because I'm leaving tonight I'm not
gonna see Candace for two days I'm gonna
go say bye to her you know some people
complain about heat waves here in the
city I don't complain about heat waves I
love it it's probably like it's gotta be
100 degrees out today
I cherish these days you know the winter
when it's freezing I fantasize about
these days this is the first time I will
have flown the Phantom here since we got
trapped in that storm a couple days ago
soaking wet
mission accomplished the drone flies
perfectly I can use too much of the
footage in this episode so I'm saving it
for my video but here's a tiny itty
bitty taste of what I shot going to find
Candice gonna say hi to her I think her
mother might be in town now then I'd go
