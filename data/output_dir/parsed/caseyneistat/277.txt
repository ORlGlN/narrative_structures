Hey Dude uh sir yes they say huh
you like these ones yeah
wait you hesitated these ones swim
trunks what about these ones with the
elastic waist I haven't taught my shorts
in Connecticut super hot today sir
somebody hands me shorts that's a good
fit
much much much much much better today is
Monday but it's also July 4th and after
a holiday here in the States what else
would you say nothing all right
are you gonna get a boozy drink this
Italian family has came over and said hi
took selfies with me it turns out these
are the people that own Manfrotto tripod
okay it's great to meet you guys I'll
see you in Italy okay bye guys that's
the Manfrotto family it come over to me
like do you use a menthol to thrive on
taking advantage of afternoon naptime
go into the office and take a broken
camera audio
while I'm in here I thought I would take
a second to talk about camera equipment
namely this thing here this flexible
tripod thing it's sort of my mainstay
it's my go-to it's not great this is a
really good compact tripod and when you
set it up it looks something like this
this is a really good camera mount you
can put the camera on there clip it on
to anything this is a really good selfie
stick put your camera on the end great
for taking pictures or video of yourself
this is a really good camera mount you
put it there it makes it easy to hold
the camera steady all this stuff's
amazing but the problem is this stuff
takes up a lot of space this thing does
everything these do just not very well
and the reason why I'm bringing this up
today is because in every atleast once a
week this camp hey watch my camera falls
over people in the comments give me a
really hard time for it like I'm doing
it on purpose which is an outrageous
thing to suggest that's how that's how
my camera falls over I think I'm setting
this thing up securely it feels secure
is it secure yes it's secure and then I
walk away from the camera to turn around
to talk to camera or whatever by the
time I turn around the camera has fallen
over of course if I were using a proper
tripod that wouldn't happen a proper
mount like this that would never happen
but usually this is all I have
in an average video like yesterday I set
my camera exactly
so the chances that it's gonna tip over
one of those times is pretty good so
it's less of a matter of carelessness
and more just like this is super
versatile small light easy to use but it
like does have a tendency to tip over if
you don't really take your time to set
it up I hope you now understand why the
camera falls over so often and I didn't
do that on purpose
so I have to replace this camera with
one of my trouble is here
most of these cameras are also broken in
one way or another like this camera for
example this is my old 7d d great camera
but I also broke the microphone thing
there so it has to stay in the studio
and be treated like really carefully
otherwise it gets all wonky that's one
of my ad DS great camera but this one
broken LCD so this doesn't turn out at
all this one took a fall I think this
happened I think this happened where I
fell off my skateboard but it seems to
work
alright back in action that's backwards
whoa good luck I don't know much but I
do know that boosted boards are not
meant for skatepark Hey
yeah I don't want to steal this from you
nice to meet you nice to meet you bye
guys those were just some kids at the
skate park and one to try out the
boosted board ha Chinese jet skiers I
gotta get one
yeah what else Brooke quiz it weekend
trip to the grocery store Francine is in
a mood of all moods today
we're gonna get some pizzas and some
empanadas and then get out of here
I could hear the fireworks from our
house but I couldn't see them so I'm
going out to find him
so these I think these are the Liberty
Island fireworks these are shot from New
Jersey then New York City fireworks show
is on the other side of the island on
the East River and that starts it like
that starts in like 15 minutes
I don't know that I'm gonna go over
there see it's pretty crazy over there
I'm heading over to the east side right
now to see what's going on all right the
police just told me it's too close to
firework time and they're not letting
anyone else on the FDR like where you
watch the fireworks but I got the boots
aboard I'm gonna try to sneak around
maybe I can get through here this cop
back there knew me so they gave me the
VIP treatment let me keep my skateboard
brief update I was stuck in a jam back
there and then they opened the
floodgates and now all the people are
going up though now all the people are
going up the FDR
what's up guys okay the firework barge
is right there this is the prime vantage
point but I don't know how to get out of
here after the fireworks are over this
is the spot though they have all the
peoples who are out in just one there of
thoroughfare here after the fireworks
they're going to open this up for
getting out of here this guy's in charge
he's super cool it's starting but you
can switch up our building
does it look cool should I just come
home pretty cool fireworks go it's
starting to rain out I'm going home
I was just about to walk out the door
somebody left me this bag of candy and
it's called shrimp and bananas I could
think of a more disgusting combination
then shrimp and banana
they're kind of good things like shrimp
or bananas
