these
flights on the airplane are nothing more

this way the flight also is not as much
of a party atmosphere as the previous
flight where I decided I couldn't focus

these snacks for days

with the bar what
one song because this is you know I had
to fly New York to divide then goodbye

that time asleep really
really burned myself out yesterday

would gladly take two or three more
hours in this plane right now but I'm
also psyched to finally be landing in

guards there made me delete all the
footage of me coming off the plane which
is like fine as nothing interesting it
was just so embarrassing as I go through
first he's like Mike what are you gonna
do with all this footage and it's like
footage of the carousel we think of that
it's like really embarrassing to
confront just how uninteresting the raw
footage for this video well welcome to

electric skateboard do you want to ride

the first time in three days that felt
great I want to explain what I'm doing
here in Australia but first I have to
explain something else I walk into this
hotel room and I was like oh great they
brought my bags up and then I realized
those aren't my bags my bags are over
here over here over those are my bags
these appear to be presents yeah if
there's one thing I enjoy in life its
presence and I'm thinking that these
probably have something to do with why
I'm here so maybe this will provide a
nice segue into the next part of the
vlog how this is the biggest present
gotten in a long time
I hope it's filled up $100 bills Oh nope
