Monday morning back in New York City
things are sorted back to normal very
happy to be back here VidCon was amazing
and a super fun time met a lot of people
but starting to freak out so I missed
the baby in Candace in the office
I go away for two days and this is what
happens I really wanted to make sure I
have some time today to talk about
VidCon and what a crazy experience that
was but they just told me that I have a
borderline obscene amount of mail over
here so good god so it looks like today
might be a mail time episode
thank you for what might be the
creepiest thing anyone's ever sent me I
mean I don't mean to be ungrateful but
this is going to give Francine
nightmares Boris thank you for my alien
heads Thank You Riley Bennet for this
gigantic selfie stick I was just about
to say thanks for the dog food I'll feed
it to Gigi try prefer human food and
then I saw this tiny little package of
gummy bears in there thank you very
little
Thanks metal hanger shop I don't really
know what a metal hanger is Oh a metal
hanger not a metal hanger c26 - that's
the distance of a marathon you hang your
marathon metals here thank you
not sure what that means that's kind of
awesome thank you
I'm gonna use the knife these are from a
guy that makes these little things is
the name of his operation thanks for the
stones Oh gonna use the knife but I'll
be very careful I don't know how else to
get through this
hi Casey hope you're having a kick-ass
week I Congrats on launching beam thanks
will will you know the way to get my
attention this box is all beaten to hell
these are the scariest packages
all right this is from my friend Zack
Zack loaned me his skateboard in Dubai
and then I was being towed behind like a
super fancy super car I tripped fell
skateboard was run over by the car my
foot was run over by the
No tasty nice and robust keyboard
Zack you're too kind thank you and thank
you for the t-shirt whoa cool check out
that bean sticker and that's pretty
awesome okay check this kid out go to
his YouTube because he sent me this and
this is awesome Thank You Dustin you're
a good man
so yesterday Jack had this brilliant
idea that we should go get double
cheeseburgers with cheese fries
milkshakes and that's exactly what we
did and they were delicious but I've
been feeling pretty sick ever since
I don't really eat much food like that
and today to rectify the situation I'm
eating like super healthy raw vegan
plant-based foods and I'm gonna go get
like a kale salad or something right now
and it just seemed like a great
opportunity to take out the boosted
board look at these
yo what's up guys hey see I've been here
since he's been here since 11 o'clock oh
you're in the vlog I wish I'd known you
guys were here to come out say hi all
right guys nice to meet you you're all
probably in the vlog unless I cut this
scene six hours of waiting in it I'm so
sorry that you waited for six hours
shame those kids have been waiting
outside my office for six out it's a red
light for six hours man poor kids I feel
like such a jerk
what
so part of the reason why I'm going on
this Odyssey to get some raw vegan
healthy overpriced food is its 704 and
the p.m. and I have not left the office
since I got in it like 8 o'clock this
morning so I'm forcing myself to leave
the office once before it gets dark out
okay thanks a lot okay so this is like a
fruit and hemp raw drink which is like
okay these are rock health noodles
they're not as bad as they sound but
they're not as good as a double
cheeseburger
speed
my 40 friends like it's time I said hi
you
