skateboard it's electric right
Gold Sora yeah here's the thing they're
not allowed of course proper keep it on
the bike path just consider bars
property that's a $500 summons will ya
so write it on the freeway you could but
that's yours up to your safety net I
wouldn't suggest it but I'm going to
have to do manual you just push it yeah
I believe in the rule of law I really
genuinely do except when you don't think
those rules are just
and that's unjust that I can ride in the
middle of a freeway and that's okay but
I can't ride on a path that's meant for
wheeled vehicles
with full respect to that officer and
the NYPD and whatever all made that law
I'm gonna ride back on that bike path
every day
yeah
that's a bad day right there
