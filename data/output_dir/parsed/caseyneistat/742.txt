this is what your
this is what New York City sounds like
I I fell off my bicycle this morning I
was like doing a tight turn and there
was an apex of peak in the pavement my
pedal was at its lowest I was leaning
the bike the pedal hit the pavement
light came out from under me okay watch
right here right watch that again see
and then this woman is here it's not a
big deal there's just like this woman
came running over and asked if I was
okay and just kind of name was feel like
a dope Sonia Saracen
anyways I have a pretty early business
meeting this morning okay I like this I
like to schedule meetings early in the
morning when someone pushes back and if
I don't want to eat that early it's
probably somebody you don't want to be
working with today is a bike day there
really is no point in complaining about
the weather that said this weather is
total
it's the second week of April and it's
33 degrees out right now I go on and on
about how much I love New York City what
do I not love about New York City by
connectivity a little bit more like Los
Angeles just like this much more Sun and
this much less whatever you call this
great bush this is not a safe way to
lock your bicycle but I'm eating right
there so it should be okay
today's the day of meetings that was the
breakfast meeting
then I'm lunch meeting chu afternoon
meetings and then a late-night meeting
hall meetings all day a rolling paper
company designed this skateboard yeah
but it's like a pretty solid skateboard
considering and you just were like you
know what this office needs is a weed
escapable I think that's what we need is
a weed skateboard I will say this is not
I will say this space is amazing for
scape back ok next meeting of the day is
a brief lunch meeting there's going to
be a deeper lunch meeting but we're
gonna take outruns meeting with mr. Finn
Harries all right you really get on
camera and you should think about
starting a YouTube channel why are we
eating today the same place I ate
yesterday and pretty much every day walk
over I did all the proof if you've been
following chase nice ass plots like I
have the last two weeks you'll join me
in applauding him for creating such well
produced high-quality narrative content
I hope we have more people like you will
need you how much
dude thank you for coming by it was a
pleasure to see you you know how to get
out of here yeah I got up there you did
get up here later Finn thanks for coming
by there's there's a critical mass that
your brain hits where when you've been
doing so many things at once it's
thinking about so many things at the
same time it just kind of seizes up and
your ability to process new information
fails I hit that point today it's okay
though
okay p.m. a new day starts for hours
