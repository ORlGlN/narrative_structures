what's up guys man
take care Bend's yours we're on a
mission from God this terrible shirt I
sleep in this terrible shirt seven days
a week because when Francine wakes up
and she sees this she smiles good one
easy just because I don't put my rugs in
every episode doesn't mean I don't run
every day because I do and I'm going for
a run right now anything I love as much
as a summer run in New York City never
find that on days when you exercise it's
easy to eat healthier on days when you
don't exercise you see garbage all day I
don't get that running it's
cheeseburgers and no shakes I was
looking at old footage yesterday
and I saw some video footage of this
studio from last summer here's the thing
about this studio this place I built
this place from the ground up this
studio this is like my sanctuary this is
where I work this is where I make things
this is my happy place it's just me in
here this is my tree fort this place is
like a physical manifestation of Who I
am
and as I was looking at whoa
and as I was looking at the old footage
in that video it was immaculate in here
this place was perfect all the time
and now and now it's like this
claustrophobic dump in here I've got no
one to blame for the current state of
affairs but myself I guess I've just
been prioritizing making videos over
taking care of the studio and those two
things really are mutually exclusive I
should not be decoupling them I also
just keep telling myself as soon as the
new space is ready as soon as the new
spec the new space is ready it is
magnificent over here the white lights
are up right now that's why it's so
clean and white in here but look how
nice this is
I heard about the fluorescence and it's
just these warm soothing incandescent
hello all the garbage is out the floors
are robbed this place is ready for work
there have been a lot of haters
questioning the integrity of this loft
this is sound especially when
considering this is only a storage loft
nobody see me working up here if
anything this loft was wildly over built
there's
that this is going to fall out and
anyone beneath it like it would take
something bigger than an earthquake in
order for this to come down I mean
that's just basics
big night tonight tonight
date night we don't get date night often
because it's like it's hard to get a
babysitter and then we just like our
nights with the date but tonight is date
night I'm very excited about it we're
seeing some sort of movie about grocery
stores or produce or something like that
can be great here who's here
oh nice man
No

which part of date night I don't know
you don't seem very enthusiastic my
stomach's
what's wrong with your stomach these are
control top genes
what does that mean it means like spanks
Graham not oh I am skinny I'm very
blessed if you like that kind of thing I

been thinking about that you don't want
