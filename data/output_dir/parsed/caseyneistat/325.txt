I got you guys some snacks I got you
three doughnuts in $3 slices from Julia
vanilla pastrik aqua bank Wow
3 million out of this world 3 million
subscribers when I cross the 1 million
threshold and then when I cross the 2
million threshold I tried to make videos
that share some insider some the things
that I've learned on my process to
getting there and it feels a little
different this time I will say without
reservation the first million is the
hardest the first million took me five
years the second million took me like
five months something then this last
million took me even less time you know
it's like it's like a snowball when it's
really small it only picks up a little
bit of snow but as that snowball gets
bigger it picks up more and more snow
and the channel just grew so fast this
is not cocaine this is fake snow I was
going to use it to illustrate the
snowball analogy but I'm not sure what
happens let's see
oh I'm dreaming of a wide
I hope that analogy makes sense I only
have one piece of advice to offer on
this round on this three million and
that one piece of advice was given to me
by a guy named Roman Atwood and it's the
best piece of YouTube advice I've ever
been given and it was three words just
keep uploader God bar what's hot in
high-tech I know so austere you've seen
him in the videos before Oscar and I
Oscar Oscar
moved here from Argentina was looking
for a job he applied for a job to work
for my brother and he hired him on his
third day in New York City and he and I
have been working together ever since he
associate produced my HBO series and now
he's like a big-time movie producer but
my short advice for Oscar is that he's
too good of a filmmaker to be a movie
producer and that he should just be
making videos more specifically just
putting them on the Internet
hearing it from you then that's about as
encouraging as it as it can be oh but I
just think you're like you have a unique
skill set that would just do so well on
YouTube should we just go yeah this
house yeah
you remember how to ride that thing yeah
take it easy
it's pretty good for a newcomer do you
make it so getting through to that this
is where you're going
she's the greatest milliner in here
what's a milliner
Oscar is 100% the only friend I have we

them that often but amazing oh that is a
good-looking hat man oh the cowboy
