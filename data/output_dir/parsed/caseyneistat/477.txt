got a gas motor on there and it's a
regular bicycle and what does the vacuum

care in case you missed that that man
had taken an old beach cruiser bicycle
put a gas-powered motor on it and built
a motorcycle and then he also had a
vacuum cleaner attached to it that he
just found which he was very excited
