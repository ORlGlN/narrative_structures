here comes the wave
Roy's had this plan for us to race
paddle boards across the East River from
Brooklyn to Manhattan and then we'll go
paddleboarding
you know you already went for like a
two-hour run this morning that run was
one hour it's hot humid I'm not gonna
turn around and run back now here's the
deal
we're gonna do all the Candice's things
first then Roy and I are gonna go on our
paddleboard in the East River mission
check out this shirt I'm getting
profession you know this guy's the whole
DP as you can see FBI don't to be
watching me I don't want no plans on the
board sit down
I don't have any shorts my cousin I'm
sure let's go hi hi hi Candace are you
mad at me
your fuel this paddleboarding across the
East River was Roy's idea we haven't
really fleshed out any of the details we
also are a little vague on the
legalities of paddle boarding in the
East River but I think it's totally
legit based on top once and he said yeah
I wouldn't recommend it yeah this is the
river gonna cross
let's shop in windy there's a lot of
boats down there
so if that's one board and this is the
other one it's inflatable yeah Debbie's
mom she'll take your card off I borrowed
some shorts from Roy's cousin check
these out USA baby yeah
get me the Pope it seems like a really
long board to put on the roof of this
car
he puts it on that smart card is that
your electric smoke pot Thanks what if
we don't have life jackets write a bill
probably uh you know if they see you
they're going to come up to you they
approached me before without in the bay
in Long Beach and they're like yo you
can get a ticket to get out of the water
and all of you
surf shop surf shop surf shop
it's a much easier place in Malibu now
no care in the world the best surfer sir
they are Kelly Slater
it was given Kelly Slater they've all
said it was really dangerous so if that
was you guys I would say out of the East
River and go to the Hudson I shouldn't
do that the other Hudson all right
change of plans we're gonna thank you
thank you
change of plans we're gonna go to the
Hudson so we're not yeah we're going to
go check out the water then I think
that's it I think we're going to we
don't have life jacket and I can see the
current from here it just looks like
absolute madness insane current seems a
little a little rough
what do you think I'm looking I know how
to judge the water man I'm looking at
this right over here and it's like
intense currents they're going in and
out there's a lot of wind on it too like
if you look right over here like I let's
say just hang out in this little pond
right here you go into here this is the
Death Zone it's going to be a fight then
it's going to be a big fight
it'll be fun
all right this is it we're paddling out
really final thoughts all right David
leaving the camera with you leaving
t-shirts on it looks so confident we're
not going in
have fun guys
we got trouble coming
those are the bad boys like that we've
been out here for like three minutes
NYPD is already visiting headed right
for him this looks like a short paddle
looks like a showdown right

major traffic
here comes the wave yeah I'm not
thinking across over think so
another
Scarah
Oh
I know
how're you get the board's over this
fence well they're going out of the
water
yeah I could see them taking the boards
out of the water
no they're getting out onto the land
understood understood
you know what I mean yeah sorry for the
trouble
NYPD Harbor Patrol is great ah
but we don't have life jackets which is
not okay Roy kept asking them to give us
a ride back into that which is bold Roy
bold plan
the cops were super super cool and it
turns out we'll break any laws we were
just supposed to have on life jackets
but both the NYPD in the end y FG the
fire department because they thought we
were doing something wrong someone
called him a drowning yeah so we
apologized or anything yeah to to
everyone for causing such a stir
it's good right we still wanted anybody
get the wrong idea and anybody else
tries it make sure you wear a life
jacket
definitely okay let's go home now go
thank you
dude good to see you too bye guys how
you doing
