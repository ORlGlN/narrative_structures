like this is my hero
what is this woman appears in your and
it no delay will be it was equally
sound then I am baby found them let's
run let's run
solid solid 13-mile run this morning a
little bit of green just bright head
into the office really feeling the
summer health cake punch
summertime that's good
and three
what's up man
I own six six boosted boards and right
now four out of six are broken three out
of six are in the shop two out of six
kind of worked so you had to make a note
on that because it's got a limited range
maybe the battery's dead might be one of
my really old ones it doesn't go very
far
so tomorrow tomorrow is the big day for
Candace tomorrow's the day of her like
huge party an event and whatever it's
called for her company Billie sue most
of the day today's going to be spent
working with her to help prepare for the
big day Thursday May 11
I would say only three to four times a
week I heat my lunch up using a paint
stripping gun direct heat kinda like a
broiler get the job done
it's great I was supposed to meet
Candace there but then she just asked me
to meet her at home so now I'm going to
meet Candace at home
you know 10 years are you I'm doing hey
how many lost party got in this one hot
I got the G Wagen but it's what I wanna
buy for my girl no fun I like it damn G
maybe
Candace and I are on a very special
mission right now see tomorrow well
tomorrow when this is posted
Thursday is her party her event and we
have a fun idea which involves a super
car or a cool car being parked in front
of her office we're going we're going to
we're on a mission right now this kind
of do it just right Houston I want to
say he's so sight
look him and his friend of the same
exact car this guy's got the coolest
cars ever believe these cars
manling up a Lambo the Ferrari McLaren
Porsche is that how you want to our car
have you ever been here before
what about that
this is your favorite make my high
school life this is a car that canvasses
dad had when Camus was in high school
and shoot on occasion borrow the NFS
from him and drive it not even a Hello
if you see a guy man Candace here in the
bike walking shoes hey chase you're
missing what's going on here this is the
New York City Classic Car Club Mike here
her Candace is beating on my cue
Mike's a friend of I'm and he's that
giving us a tour of the newspaper you
guys tell you everything about it's
going to be the greatest event this week
definitely on the side
so here's the concept she's going to
have loaner this bright orange bronco
park it in front of her shop during the
event Thursday night and then on the
side it's going to say Billy company
vehicle five inches 6 inches 7 inches I
think they've got a tape measure it
should always be bigger than you think
father this is not mine my lips look
like it but personally I would have gone
with the Lamborghini here but Candace
and I have different tastes
thank you Sarah for having me thanks for
loaning my wife your car I'll see you in
a couple of days the way that that
operation works there is you have to be
a member of that Club but if you
remember you can borrow any of those
cars whenever you want I don't know why
anyone alone want to be a member of a
country fun right and they don't even
have Lamborghinis at country clubs just
dolls
this is a safe here this is where her
party's gonna be it's going to be well
her office is just down there but this
is where the party's going to be in here
it's going to be awesome in the window
is where there's gonna be the guy who's
welding people's gold bracelets on and
then Jeremy is going to be in there
doing free tattoos for people and then
let's go in not digging here I don't
know what else popping you've gotta
where you're going to have a DJ you're
gonna you get pizza yeah she has
somebody giving you booze are you
getting the keg know what else I want
everybody to know how cool this is gonna
be it's hot I'm here what else is there
music this is the big one
look at this is the big one this is the
big launch for Billy well yeah it's
happening this is big deal of succeeding
one two three one two three
funky so this here this is the VIP rooms
if you're a privileged invitee you can
come into this room and just just enjoy
yourself really maybe you want to maybe
you want to find the ladder let's go
home now so that's where that's where
the parties univee can be great it would
be exciting how many people did you
invite not enough Morgan
are you excited or nervous about the
party I service because when you get
involved I get nervous if you put all
these expectations on me I know are all
party that was not the response I was
expecting kind of naively realizing
right now as I finish this edit that a
lot of you might be wondering if you can
come to the party on Thursday night the
answer for me is yes but the answer from
campus is probably no it's a small space
and she's going to have her like
magazine editors and important people
for her new business there but I mean
I'll be there if you want to come say hi
take a selfie in the street or something
like that I'll be there with my
skateboard I don't think that Jeremy
should have enough time to tattoo all of
you
also those pictures right there they're
not that's not Candace that is not that
is not picture that's kid
