you start that's how all vloggers start
every sentence you go okay so okay so
and then say something interesting
something okay so hey guys

never fully recovered to the work taking
a taxi to work today hey keep up thank
you thank you thank you Mateus and
Thomas for this tiny license plate I'll
put it on my boosted board y'all
remember last week when I was
complaining about how my studio which
was my sanctuary has been destroyed well
I have a big update in that it's
near-perfect once again let me show you
ah it's not near perfect again because I
did the work the gal just got in here
and kicked some serious and on top of
that we move the entire mail time
operation over here to the annex which
by the way is filling up and really I
think it was the whole mail time
situation that was like at the core of
this studio falling apart
I just wasn't proactive enough in
opening the boxes and they started to
pile up we got a visitor who's this it's
like a librarian of some sort out there
hello sir can I help you mister smell
this whistle smells big didn't work
Jesse you interrupted me I was just
giving a tour because the studio has
never hasn't looked this good in months
but you just looked into the war room
and I haven't shared that yet what do
you think you told me that you're gonna
do this like months ago and I'm like did
you do it it is like yeah oh my god this
is like a filmmakers dream right now but
done not done what's that yeah looks
like a an armory
this is oh it's an armored Lighting's
not done yet
Oh drone setups not completely done the
camera set up some needs to be flushed
out this is the microphone setup an OCD
look at they gotta be for phase apart
everyone look at these GoPro mounts
what about this is like military-grade
come along though right looking you a
red strike I get good I got a selfie
stick set up there I got my GoPro
stabilizers there this would be good for
vlogging I don't go there you go use
that it's like our actual daily vlogging
apparatus but you must yeah you can't
like throw around I need to walk Fame I
made the whole thing okay
I'm gonna finish this segment about the
studio I really want to lose
Jessie might have crashed back there you
crash no I was getting towed by that
truck they're slower than yoga

smoothie Jesse tell me something that is
like a Jesse exclusive here so I can

moet and Shawn Don I used to drink a lot
when they start ship and they're gonna

ready
what happened to it sick
example 2005 right there I'm like a
child I was a job look like 15 this way
you can get the rest of your lunch by
Candice of the day 5 Morgan Jesse
good to see you you too brother I'll see
you guys later on the interwebs I don't
know where but the Internet is you Jesse
I'll be around man I robbed you
great to see Jessie always good to catch
up with that guy this building this is
like a secret Nike gym they've got real
plants outside and it's raining are you
getting wet
a little bit
all right now I can finish my bit before
about how the studio has been returned
to its previous glory it's still not
done here and even the gear room that I
showed you earlier when Jesse was here
even that's not done it's it's far from
perfect the studio it's a little like
xenos dichotomy paradox where you're
never a hundred percent done you get
fifty percent done than 75 percent done
than eighty seven point you're only ever
getting halfway and halfway and halfway
there so you're never actually done
because I've been in this space for 12
years now if there were a finish line I
would have crossed it it's like fashion
you have to keep iterating on it I love
where it is right now especially with
the new gear closet expect constant
updates on the progress of this studio
it's a package for me I'm sorry you guys
had to deal with this it's okay we're
just excited to see what it is I have no
idea what it is all I know is I
definitely did not order it I'll let you
guys know what it is sorry
you can see this thing is enormous is
very heavy I don't know what this is but
I do know that I gotta go home right now
so I'm not gonna tune in tomorrow on the
vlog to see what's inside of this
gigantic box
