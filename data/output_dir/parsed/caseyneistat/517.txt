it's raining cigarettes okay
you
the QR new to this blog and maybe
today's the first episode you've ever
seen I highly recommend not watch from
today's blog maybe watch one of the
earlier ones because today's long term
is suck today I go back to dentists for
another super-fun root canal
means the rest of the day on the top but
it sorry guys it's time all right don't
get my root canal again are you still
drinking this crap how's it going I keep
smelling phantom foods there you look
different
I smell like Cool Ranch Doritos
yeah careful with that stuff ain't
knowing the dentist I ain't go the
dentists I hate going at this I hate go
what's up David to get a root canal
another yeah man I love them
savatthi we'll get you one soon
thank you good what are we doing today
something awesome ah just kidding that
really wasn't that bad
this was much easier than the last time
I was at the dentist a little numb but
not so detrimental never mind what I
said before about not watching today's
vlog
a little numb nah
lunch here so shoot the niversary store
keep trying to make a bigger effort to
leave the office a couple times
throughout the day
right now I'm literally going nowhere
fast I'm riding my board through the
city with no purpose and no direction
it's the middle of November I know that
like a horrible New York City winter is
on the horizon
I've seen every episode of Game of
Thrones winter is coming and I feel it
out this is well that's a one-way street
what are you doing come on it's a
one-way street also as a side note I
haven't really gotten to break in the
brand new boosted board yet it's
incredible
really painful foot massage I avoid the
Brooklyn Bridge like a plague because I
can't take these crowds but I completely
forgotten how incredible the view is out
here look at this
I want to look them up here I wanted to
come on the Brooklyn Bridge to talk
about what it means to create or make
something more specifically how hard the
act of creation is I work really hard to
make these vlogs seem like effortless
and that they were very easy for me to
do and the reality of that is very
different like yesterday's vlog was
about hired to buy a new microphone
which is expensive and the vlog still
sounded like I had to buy a new
microphone because the vlog the day
before yesterday sounded like almost
unusable because the sound was so up
again I make that part of the narrative
I make it fun but the truth is when I
sat down to edit and I see that all my
audio is messed up I want to not make it
I want to embrace the excuse that
technically this could have just I can't
use it in no video today and overcoming
those obstacles or overcoming those
obstructions I would say is the biggest
challenge between any one person's idea
in any manifestation that is actually
realizing that idea these vlogs for me
these videos for me everything I've ever
made has been a battle and these little
videos are no exception that whole
diatribe aside why the audio was so
screwed up and my last two vlogs was not
because of the microphone at all my
Canon 70d camera microphone input port
was fry so no matter what I plugged in
it was going to sound like
all right
check out that license plate
you need help I can fix it yeah I can
pick break
anything
try now
good
no problem you're welcome
that's the luck welcome to New York City
I can fix anything
like a check
it's not late but it's so dark outside
winter is coming how do our door break
already so it's our fault yeah
