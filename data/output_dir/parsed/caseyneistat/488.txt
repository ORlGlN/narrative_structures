by never drinking again
where we going this guy's definitely
getting a ticket for riding without a
helmet that's where you're getting a
ticket full right
it's 3:30 in the afternoon in Kansas and
I just left the house for the first time
today we're both a very very sick is not
fair we're very hungover I don't drink I
never drink I'm not speaking holy
see I would always rather wake up early
and go for a run then wake up and throw
up into a toilet but last night was the
company party and today's vlog is gonna
suck I'm just preparing you for that
it's gonna suck does it be me being over
eating bad food yep okay thank you
I called free soda lemonade
thank you yes I think you might have
gotten too much stuff
was that good
you feel better
we've been in this place for like an
hour just sitting here Candice said
Vietnamese food would make me feel
better
I don't know if I feel any better that's
it we're going house food we didn't need
this place is the best by the way I give
not wrong Center I get this place by
highest recommend
we just left the restaurant that's it
that's probably the whole vlog for today
I doubt there anything else
I still feel sick gross and hungover
stupid drinking is so stupid
there's nothing less interesting than
talking about the weather but it is now
mid-december and this is what I'm
wearing and I'm totally fine
it's like 65 degrees out alright see you
later
I'm not much of a fan of drugs or
alcohol I probably drink like a couple
of times a year it just is so incredible
it's so unproductive it's like the
opposite of everything I love which is
like accomplishments and doing things
and self-improvement I mean I'm not
hating on I'm not hating on drinking I
like to have fun sometimes but god today
is just like today today was just full
of regret for me I still feel awful
it's like 6:00 p.m. right now Candace is
already asleep the baby's asleep I left
the house once today so I decided to go
out the movies with my favorite movie
date going by myself
stop I'm Casey I know you can't take a
future with you
okay okay here we go
the movie I saw is called the Big Short
it comes out in a couple weeks I highly
recommend it
I know I always give positive movie
reviews but it was brilliant it was like
it was like a fast paced YouTube video
that was two hours long about the most
boring thing ever
the financial crisis but it was
fascinated and Selena Gomez has a cameo
in it I'm gonna go home now I feel much
better that movie really fixed my
hangover I'm glad I left the house why
is that funny cuz it sounded money
