yeah these photos are pretty great this
one is probably my favorite it's not as
easy as it looks
today's Monday on Wednesday super early
in the morning Candace Francine and I
fly to Los Angeles in two days today is
one of those days where I'm going to do
some explaining here on the vlog but
before I do well my friend Dan is here
from South Africa
say something South African what's up
fruit that's pretty South African you
know how to ride one of these
you'll be alright alright
like surfing it's just like surfing but
through the streets of Manhattan yeah
how's New York City been freaking out
here but I could live here I could fully
live yet you think so yeah I've been to
events all the South Africans do so
follow me here maybe this is a really
bad idea you gotta lean into it Dan
you know dan is like one person I cannot
give a hard time to because when I was
in South Africa with him this guy's like
a champion surfer and he had to put up
with me sucking in the ocean and he was
very sweet about it so

yeah we're safe this time well sir safe
in the sea not on that street sweeper
good to see you sir good to see you hey
travels like a children bye
okay back to today's YouTube video
there are a lot of reoccurring themes in
this vlog and lately there have been
there have been two themes and the
trouble with those two themes is that
they're entirely contradictory they
really don't make sense together
whatsoever and that's what I wanted to
explain today those two contradictory
themes are how I absolutely love New
York City and all that it represents and
then how Candace and I are always
talking about moving and leaving New
York City and I did want to preface this
whole thing by saying my work my life my
business which I have no intention of
moving they're all here in New York City
so this conversation that Candis and I
are always having about moving out of
New York City it's not like tomorrow or
this week it's years in the future it's
it's
this this is how I see Life this well
this is a book called No Country for Old
Men but a book a book is a perfect
metaphor for how I see Life now a book
is made up of chapters just like life so
your life is broken up into these
chapters and for me a chapter is like a
segment in life that feels kind of
compartmentalized
like my childhood my childhood is a
really compartmentalised aspect of my
life chapter 1 in the book that is my
life this is literally the last time I
graduated from any school in my entire
life I was frustrated for the vast
majority of my childhood
that's me crying and that's my dad and
me in Central Park I don't know I was
like four years old there check out my
hat anyway childhood chapter one now
this next chapter which is chapter two
when I dropped out of high school ran
away from home had baby Owen was on
welfare like living in a trailer park
this was a really challenging time in my
life it was also from when I went from
being a kid to being a dolt
look that's Owen and that that's me it
was own second birthday how fat I was
look at that fat face I had that's Owen
that's my mom and that's me with my very
first video camera now chapter three
chapter three started when I moved to
New York City it was me leaving behind
like a life and me pursuing a life of
the unknown like me chasing a dream this
is my very first press book that says
nice that press October 2002 till August
these were the very first time that
anything I ever did got any recognition
this is the first time I ever saw my
name in print a film that my brother and
I made got runner up in some Film
Festival and look it says my name right
there in this part this segment Chapter
three
if I had to put one title on this part
of my life I would definitely call it
New York City this hugely transformative
phase in my life took place happened
because it is completely married to this
great city all of a sudden I'm like
married and I have a one-year-old baby
and a kid that's about to go to college
and I have a business and I have all of
these I have all this established stuff
and if there was something that was
missing from all of chapter throughs any
sort of establishment that entire phase
of my life was about recklessness and
spontaneity so I think that right now
I'm entering into a new chapter I never
ever saw myself living in any one place
for the whole of my life and I've been
in New York now for 15 years and when I
think about the future I think like an
environmental change is something that's
really interesting to me and I don't
believe that liking something so much
should preclude you from trying
something new what that literally means
is even though I absolutely love this
city that is not a good enough reason
for me to not try something else so yes
my affinity for and obsession around
this city
absolutely contradicts my curiosity
about leaving the city but I've also
always said New York City is only for
the young and broke and the rich and old
and I'm entering into a phase of my life
where I'm neither of those two I hope
that was helpful
also for whatever it's worth we're not
going anywhere for years like who knows
were all being a couple years
for context I only been vlogging for
like eight months just a special end of
the vlog announcement I'll be posting a
second video today this afternoon at 3
