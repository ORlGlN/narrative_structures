want to see the coolest thing I've ever
seen in an airplane seat
what I think of the greatest days in my
entire life I think of when my children
were born or perhaps when my son
graduated high school or today when I
was upgraded from business to first
thought Emirates
I don't know what I did to deserve this
I really don't God
smacks writing kit we're in the air just
left Dubai I got my own door
it's like my little house over here
total privacy
the TV here is enormous it's like a
movie theater
it's touchscreen
but you can also control it with this
thing
it's like a mini iPad remote
now if I want a drink and I don't have
to call them
and the fact that that's motorized is
just ridiculous completely unnecessary
Mercer told me that I just order
whatever I want whatever I wanted
there's a little mealtime you just tell
him to cook you something and they cook
it
like being at a real restaurant
this this is caviar
if you don't know caviar is efficient
salty
in addition to the amenities kit
this lovely thing which has all kinds of
great surprises in it shaving cream and
d / and all kinds of like that
they gave me this big bag see
in here
slippers
I shade
and pajamas very nice I brought my own
pajamas but I appreciate the gesture
alright this is what it looks like when
it goes from a seat from chair to a bed
this is more comfortable than my bed at
home
so cozy
the moment has arrived she just told me
my shower is ready so you have to
reserve the shower like make a
reservation I reserved it for as close
to landing as possible he'll and in an
hour 45 minutes so it's shower time
enemy so so Oh
once you're inside yeah you close the
door to the water and you adjust the
temperature once you find you press that
button the water will help you press
again it will stop
real deal the dream showering on an
airplane I've got 30 minutes in here to
go whatever I want I got five minutes of
running water in the shower I get 25
other minutes to fill
that's a real workin
dreams do come true I am showering on
their friend
this is amazing it's everything I hope
you woody
I am 43,000 feet in the air right now
I feel fresh and clean
thus concludes my airplane shower spots
experience
thank you
truly extraordinary experience did you
shower how was it incredible right
see you later thank you it really does
change your whole relationship with
travel when you take what was the most
painful part of traveling and instead of
that being a terrible experience goes
from pain
like a meatball
fish
