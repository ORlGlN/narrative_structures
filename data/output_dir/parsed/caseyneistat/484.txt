do you want a drone or a camera or a
boosted board this is just a moment this
has been a pretty crazy year for me on
YouTube since I started uploading daily
videos my channels grown like for a
million new subscribers I wanted a way
to thank all my subscribers so I thought
I would do a year-end giveaway some of
my favorite things and let me know in
the comments below be specific which of
the three year-end giveaway prizes you
want
so DJI phantom 3 professional drone this
is a 4k drone this is a drone that I
have I also figured you need a case for
your drone that will keep the new drone
safe and also you can take it on an
airplane don't quote me on that this is
the camera I used to shoot almost all on
my blog this is the lens I use on it and
this is the gorilla pod thing that I tap
to the bottom of it and this is them and
the microphone that I use for it so if
this camera kit is what you want make
sure your subscriber and let me know in
the comments this is a boost to dual
plus the top-of-the-line motorized
skateboard this is not the cheap one
this is the one that has two motors
super high speed this is the one that I
ride all right so that's the giveaway
I've never done this before so I don't
really know how I don't know my life has
changed so much in the last year it's
because of you viewers coming to this
channel and watching what I make and
this is like a way for me to give back
to three of you but at least like the
rest of you will feel like there's a
chance you could have also one just make
sure you're subscribed make sure you
comment below to let me know which one
you want we're going to get I will get
in touch with you and the last thing I
did want to say is that this is not I
repeat this is not a sponsored giveaway
I paid for each and every one of these
presents out of my pocket all right good
luck guys
you
