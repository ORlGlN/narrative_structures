I learned a new trick check this out
it's 653 in the morning I had this great
idea to wake up super early get a drone
sick the 360 camera on the bottom of the
drone fly around Austin get beautiful
shots before the Sun comes up and that's
a really great idea to have at night
when you're awake and alive but right
now I'm really questioning I'm necessary
this is I'm very very tired you guys
know the address because I have no idea
what that is yeah I'm gonna put him in
okay the City of Austin wasn't super
keen with us flying drones over the city
itself so we are we're starting out here
at this park got a big enough drone look
at the size of this thing this is our
smallest one actually how many times did
you crash this thing never so we've been
fine commercially since oh nine and
we've never had a claim on our insurance
you know I've never flown a drone
without crashing it you're not flying so
that's the shot that's the camera let's
put it on that ridiculous drone let's do
it that drone is the most outrageous
overkill I have ever seen the camera is
this big and we're putting it on a drone
that can carry a gigantic camera we got
the first 360 shot now we're going to
get the actual drone 360 shot and I
think that's kind of it literally it's
not a whole lot to this drone shoot this
morning Paul I'm putting you in charge
of this camera
fill me in stuff okay I see this blogger
this is this is how you record start
stop right there red light and then grab
onto the big grippy part to zoom in you
can handle it right go go go
it's so big okay now
gunshot that felt like it was our use
like normally pushing so much
thank you see you later today I love
those guys alright let's go the hotel
now
great bye guys that sheet this morning
was so fun I'm finishing up a little bit
of work right now in my hotel room then
I have to prepare for this panel that
I'm on this afternoon about virtual
reality which is really the main reason
why I'm down here that's hot
is that the helicopter people can I
climb out the door of the helicopter
well then let me tell Casey
it says for us to bring a harness but
he's not 100% sure that it can hold
someone so we got a we gotta clarify
that oh no he is 100% sure I can hold
you I want to hang it out of the
helicopter tomorrow then it cannot hold
him the helicopter
this is like the green room at Samsung
right now we're about to do the talk the
panel thing you're down here preparing
and what that means is eating all the
snacks they lay it out for me the tacos
are yeah from a panel of experts in this
space okay so our good afternoon
