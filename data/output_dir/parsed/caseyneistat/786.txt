yeah crazy yeah it's really crazy make
account was a movie about seizing the
moment grabbing life by the balls
I made that movie for Nike because
that's an idea I believe in now the
FuelBand are motivation for the movie
keeps track of how you make it count but
back when the movie was made it hadn't
been released yet I wasn't actually
wearing a fuel band but I have one now
so I thought I'd revisit the idea
so what this thing does is it provides
you with a number a number that keeps
tracked how active you are active can
mean a lot of things give me a budget
and asking me to be active and I'm on
the next flight out air travel is the
closest thing to time travel start in
Africa always Africa we had an idea of
what we were doing but the idea was big
it's the only way I like to do anything
you can see two oceans from up there
that counts only flight we can find was
to Amman Jordan no this guy kept us out
of trouble one come and go to them
motorcycles in Vietnam jet skiing in
Doha so much wind in Amster
we missed the train but the adventure
doesn't begin till something goes wrong
we were always moving always the stairs
never the escalators
got a car in Israel played in the mud
1,300 feet below sea level then went up
way up from 12,000 feet you fall for a
full minute that counts
I had heard about this waterfall in
Africa
there's this great quote and I really
said it but it goes without a goal you
can't school
you see it's not a bungee cord it's a
static line a rope
bought our tickets at the airport we
planned nothing because when nothing's
for sure
anything can happen
