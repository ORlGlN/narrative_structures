acceleration how many do we have
welcome to the team nice
since yesterday there's been some
discussion of a golf cart race across
the golf course

laps through the rocks around this and
every time you go through the rocks it
has to be a different driver you're been
the flag girl before in the golf cart

speedboat great okay now okay
fix it feels better let's see
I broke this today like when I got back
it wasn't working and when I opened the
little trapdoor all the water poured out
and then I left it open in the Sun to
dry and it turned right back on very
impressive GoPro second
how did water get in there you know
business just like relationships or
anything else and get stuck in these
ruts and at work there's so much
day-to-day to keep us busy we don't get
the opportunity like zoom way out and
say what's going on that often and this
trip has been just a fantastic
opportunity to do that

this abandoned hotel resort kind of
thing a little bit scared we're on foot
now look the front door is open no look
at that door come on we got to walk in
there we made it inside of this
abandoned building it's pretty
terrifying in here and just be clear we
didn't break in class I thought we just
walked in it was wide open there weren't
even any no trespassing signs right I
mean where did he go there's an ups to
