yeah you guys want to get a dollar slice
no all right here's have one slice
please
thank you this is day seven of the vlog
it's been a week my main motivation in
doing this is I wanted like I wanted an
impetus a reason to be making movies
every day it's been effective in that I
haven't run around New York City with a
camera in so long I'd forgotten how
photogenic this city is it's like one
gigantic movie said one week of blogging
down second week begins now good morning
Francine daddy's gonna go for a run I
think I'm gonna run the West Side
Highway this morning it's pretty over
there okay this is my halfway point for
today now I turn on run home okay that's
a wrap
ten point three miles at
a 7/16 cage Oh take that there's no hot
water in my apartment building
look that sucks
oh so holes trying something a little
different today on the vlog I don't know
what it's called but it's like a Q&A
segment ashes by you answered by me
that's my friend Alec but first here's a
quick intro sequence Jack and I shot
last summer
okay Q&A got me good micro okay I never
actually plugged in the good microphone
so the sound you're hearing is from the
on-board microphone which is terrible
and super echo II I'm sorry it was a
mistake but I'm not gonna rerecord all
these questions and answers that's
ridiculous okay Sebastian wants to know
what is your favorite kind of sandwich I
like peanut butter and jelly
what do you regard when putting up a
video in order to get more views likes
shares etc I don't consider any of that
I try to make the best movies I can and
if people watch them great if not as
long as I feel good about them that's
all that matters you should never try to
like pander to an audience it will never
get you anywhere what do you wish you
could have done differently that's a
tough question
done differently I don't know I try not
to look back because I'm really happy
where I am
had I done things differently I might
not be where I am today so I maybe I
wouldn't have done anything differently
well how do you always have a brilliant
idea for your videos thanks for the
compliment I don't always have a
brilliant idea if you were to reduce any
one of my movies down to a single idea
we would find a perfectly mediocre idea
it's the execution that matters never
the idea Giovani asks what's the best
thing about having a baby having kids is
like it's a having kids
it's a sense of purpose it's like before
you have kids it's just you acting for
you but when you have kids it's you
acting for someone else and that just
makes life feel so much more substantial
Lily wants to know what editing system
do you use I currently use Final Cut Pro
10 that is not an endorsement Andrew
asks what's the business you just
launched I will get that Andrew I
promise but not now Natali asks what
advice would you give us someone who
wants to travel the world but doesn't
know how get a job what was your biggest
dream when you were a kid I wanted to
live a life where no one could tell me
what to do how do you fight distractions
I don't I embrace distractions can I do
a kickflip hi can I do a kickflip I
don't know but I can try
you gonna be here when I get back I
don't know like an hour 45 minutes maybe
are we doing SoulCycle tomorrow morning
