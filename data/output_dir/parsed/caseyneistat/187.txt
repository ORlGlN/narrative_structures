so if I get home quick I have like an
hour to hang out of the little one
this is a sunset flight into Manhattan
one of the greatest experiences of any
man's life
look at this New York City missed you so
much
okay I didn't record anything there and
then because I was too upset but right
after I like got home the son there was
like a little bit of light left so I
took out my favorite thing in the whole
world my my matic drone and I flew it
and like I don't know what happened
I think I went I think it like went but
I lost signal
I lost the drone is gone it's gone
forever it's never coming back
that drone was my favorite thing it was
my favorite like filmmaking tool video
making tool YouTube device camera that
maybe I've ever had and it's just gone
and on top of that that was like a I was
like a one-of-a-kind thing like it's not
even out yet dawn my little troop drone
my favorite it's gone a bit of a late
night mission here I emailed the guys I
know a DJ I explained to them that I
lost this thing basically I emailed them
begging them to send me another one and
they said as long as the drone still has
power I should be able to see its GPS
location so I fired up the controller
and then sure enough there's like a poop
showing me where it is
the other thing is brings a map it's in
the middle of the
middle of the river
see that middle of the river a little
further that way to see if I can find it
I mean according to the map it's on that
boat right there that's not possible
all right I mean this has to be a to be
continued there's only one of two
possible outcomes right now and that's
that this thing's confused or it's
sitting on a sailboat
I don't know why it would land on a
sailboat so I think it's tune in next
time to find out actually I'll probably
never find out but tune in next time and
find out
Yeah right you I've seen you on like on
the internet or something you do these
crazy like definitely you later
I know I see yeah that's a Katie case
obtained I think Casey
