so it has probably been the busiest day
at the new company since I started the
new company with that it's also the
first day I've literally done no
vlogging whatsoever and right now it's
5:17 p.m. what I did do was earlier in
the day Candice and Owen stopped by
why'd you have a fight with the post
hole she showed me the ugly stance and I
said no the pretty ones the flowers
right this is all we have I've never had
a problem with postal employees in fact
I said if I didn't usually probably want
to work in a post office you'd be the
most miserable postal employee in the
history of post offices perfect right
and Candice like yanked my camera out of
my hand and was like I want to film I
want to film
you have to be strong to hold this thing
so I gave her a camera of her own and I
asked her to shoot the vlog today take
this camera take Owen
oh shoot the vlog just hold the camera
steady that's the most important thing
no shaky camera okay go shoot the vlog
my microphone broke so I'm sorry the
sound is so terrible I'm headed home now

all riding on whatever Candice did or
probably didn't shoot honey did you
