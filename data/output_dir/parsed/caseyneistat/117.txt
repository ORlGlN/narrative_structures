go on before I get into this review I
want to disclose that this is not an
unbiased review as in this is a biased
review maybe you've seen the commercial
that I star in watch me I mean I wasn't
I'm not being paid by Samsung to make
this video I just like worked for them
in the past in fact I had to beg them to
give me this thing to make this video
alright in general never get a tech
reviews the let's get started
so as you can see the si+ is a fairly
large phone when compared to the s7 edge
it's really not that much bigger or
wider and when you compare it to the
iPhone 6 plus it's a little taller but
it's more slender like look
touchy-touchy know well almost
touchy-touchy
and it's all about it's all about
holding them in your hand this is the
key comparison here how they feel when
you're holding them s8 iPhone 7 plus now
one critique that I had of the s7 edge
is that there was like a little too much
edge like my fingers would always a kind
of accidentally activate things and
touch things because they touch the edge
on the on the s8 it really feels like
they fix that like there's nothing
awkward about holding on to the edge of
this thing they're side by side screen
real estate comparison that is how much
surface of the phone is dedicated to the
screen as you can see the s8 here is all
screen this has got a big fat chin a big
fat chin and I gotta say when you hold
this thing when you hold this thing in
your hand it's like the screen is sort
of dripping off the edges it feels it
truly feels it truly feels like you're
just holding a screen in your hand and
that's kind of amazing the s8 here feels
a little bluer this feels a little
warmer like this is more of a pink
orange this is more of a blue I will say
you can definitely see the pixels on the
iPhone and Omni I say is nothing but
pure butter like that is a clean clean
text right there
no sign of pixels nothing just razor
razor sharp this is where you can really
see the difference and you like a
pointer look at this this huge chin all
this wasted surface area and this is
just an amazing image versus the iPhone
I mean even even versus the older
Samsung it's just so much screen this is
where the screen really makes a
difference it's just it's just so much
more screen for the phone size
all right because this is like a because
this is an unreleased one I can't really
go outside or film anywhere interesting
with it so I'm going to go ahead and do
a film recording test indoors with this
thing alright this is going to be the
front facing like the selfie camera
video camera test got an iPhone 7 here
and I have this galaxy s 8 plus here
ready on the lighting conditions very
pretty dramatically here in my office so
nice I can't tell looking at the screen
which one's better this is what the
audio sounds like on the iPhone this is
what the audio sounds like on the s8 let
me light my stuff ready okay this is
with extremely bright lighting in my
face
this will backlight action little my
glasses action alright okay let's try
the mirror camera why do they bury on
iPhone why do they bury the 4k settings
in the setting menu instead of having
them in the camera
alright this this is the 4k camera test
they're both shooting in 4k trying to
give you some camera movement
I mean it's really it's so hard to tell
you looking at the screens as far as
which have the wider lens very hard to
tell it looks kind of framed on the same
it looks about the same I think that the
SI has a slightly wider lens than the
iPhone but it also ends up just a
massive screen so it could be the bigger
screen again I would take this camera
test with a grain of salt I'm just
filming in here I would love to film
outside I'm not allowed to let's have a
look at the still photos
okey-dokey now I'm going to test the
selfie camera that is selfie stills
again I really wish had a prettier test
subject but I'm not allowed to show this
thing to anybody so it's just me me I'm
going to test the flash on the camera
alright that's kind of it that kind of
concludes this I think this is like a
hyper rush first look at the Samsung s8
I don't know how much time it is they
just they just gave me this thing and I
got to give it right back and while I do
work with Samsung so we take that for
what it's worth I was definitely not
paid to make this video and I wasn't
paid to say is it like this thing's
pretty amazing this is like it's almost
a cell phone I've been waiting for since
I was a little kid the cell phone's been
waiting for since I was a little kid is
nothing but screen all the way like a
pure did you just holding a window to
the universe in your hand and this is by
far the closest thing to it just yet
soon this will be my full time like real
phone and that's when I can do like a
super deep dive review especially on the
video camera because that's my number
one priority and this is another kind of
terrible like super rush kind of like
not that good tech review from Katy nice
day
not sure if you can see that can you see
out right there that little hole you
know what that little hole is that's a
headphone jack
