Mexico City on Saturday I think so if
you're in Mexico City definitely come
say hi but then I'm going to LA and then
I'm going to San Francisco and then
somewhere else so everything's like
crammed into today the thing about these
kinds of days is that it's just back to
back to back meetings and phone calls
and email and stuff so I can be situated
for when I leave town not a particularly
exciting day my little brother my little
brother just texted me he's apparently
he's outside right now
hey DC guy out there it looks just like
me yo what's new Dean anything new no
well then it was good to see you how's
that little brother we did talk about
stuff I just didn't put that in the vlog
I don't want you to think that he just
came and I said what's up and then he
took off okay this is one bright spot
and otherwise like really abysmal day
tomorrow I fly to Mexico City I didn't
want to leave my electro scape were
behind so I called this company in Texas

wearing a funny outfit is my sweater on
over my GC hi puppy Oh are you eating

bummer about going on this trip for like
11 days or whatever is going to be not
seeing Candice and not seeing Francine
and not seeing Owen I hate that heading
home now
got the boosted board can I drop my
stuff off give the baby a bath and then
we're doing a little company party
tonight for bean I got to go catch up
with the bean squad till see you guys in
an hour
bye girls bye fanny hey cuz I headed to
meet the squad now they are at Chelsea
Piers I think they're bowling I'm gonna
stop by ooh
I'm gonna stop by the Apple store first
I just want to see what the lines look
like for the iPhone which comes out
tomorrow morning
so last last year for the iPhone 6
launch I made a movie about how the
iPhones were sold primarily on the
Chinese gray market and what that means
they were bought here in the States and
then sold in China and I got a lot of
trouble for the video because people
said it was racist because it was mostly
Chinese people in the line race had
nothing to do with it it's just that the
market for these things was in China so
most of the people waiting in line
happened to be Chinese it's like if the
if there was a market for in New Jersey
everyone in line would be from New
Jersey
and this is the iPhone line situation in
New York City
it's an amazing phenomenon it started
already where what would you call it
exporters of the good pay these people
sit there
last year there was crazy with the
fights at broke everything
it's such an interesting phenomenon that
waiting outside to buy then resell the
phones I don't blame those people if you
need money and they're getting paid to
wait in line like why not do it I also
don't really understand why Apple
doesn't just end cash sales
it's the bowling alleys in here
somewhere actually I have no idea where
I'm going we want to find the bowling
alley
thank you
yes it's my fried food sorry I'm late
guys
we're getting out of control that
I didn't actually drink any that was it
just for show hey my name is Josh you
one know what life is like part-time
lumberjack musician or whatever else I
may be doing only on Dean Kansas
underscore Josh
