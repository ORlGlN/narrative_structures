each of the 6378 cars that comprised the
New York City subway system have one of
these the emergency brake making each
and every ride and opportunity to bring
a train to a screeching halt I'm going
to touch it
the article is about the emergency break
and the confusion as to when to pull it
hopefully this movie will clarify things
the emergency break a constructive
analysis step 1 define emergency break a
break to use in an emergency step 2
define emergency fire medical and police
step 3 define irony the first rule is do
not pull the emergency brake an event
that seems deliberately contrary to what
one expects when do you think it's okay
to pull the emergency brake
no kid you definitely do not want to
pull the emergency brake if someone is
throwing up
this would strand you in the subway car
with the vomit in between stations
no fire is not the best answer
hit the brakes when there's a fire and
you'll burn in the tunnels when is it
appropriate to pull the emergency brake
just pilot bag who's going on
violence is one of the worst reasons to
pull the emergency brake as you'd be
trapped in the subway car with the bad
guys Richard our test dummy
shortly after shooting this scene
policemen came to arrest me for throwing
a fake baby on the subway tracks
eventually they let me go no hard
feelings
so I asked them what is it okay to pull
the emergency brake and they explained
the golden rule only use the emergency
brake when you're in the station like if
a bad dad lets go of a stroller
or someone gets their arm stuck in the
door or if there's a baby sitting way
too close to the platform it's not that
complicated really the solution is in
new signage simple easy to understand
use the emergency brake cord only when
the motion of the subway presents an
imminent danger to life and limb
