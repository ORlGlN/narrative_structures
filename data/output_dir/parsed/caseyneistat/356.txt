you know for years like literally years
the majority of my time in New York City
I would fight to get out of this city on
the weekends I never wanted to be here
on the weekends and since moving in
since having the baby and now the only
place I want to be on the weekends is
here in New York City there's just so
much going on and there's so much life
and there's so much excitement it's
because the company shut down in the
office is shut down I can like embrace
the city in a way that's impossible
during the workweek
it's Sunday morning that's Francine
that's Candace I think we're getting
breakfast I'm not sure what we're up to
this more what are you doing Francine
I'm not sure what we're up to this
morning
Clemence down candace picked out the
baby's dress this morning
excellent choice Candace what's that
it's one foot down and she kicks out of
one
job holder look who's here he's been
climbing the steps for the last 20
minutes
and seems trying to stick her head
through the fence had a lovely breakfast
with the family Candice was asleep
baby's asleep my dad left my little
brother joined us for breakfast which
was fun I'm gonna seize this opportunity
to get out of the house for a minute
until the baby wakes back up and then
I'll get back into family mode
what is going on here 100 cops were cops
love seeing other booths borders out
here
how many blocks in you older for all
right

my back

how's it going we didn't put my thumb
off let me I met before

I didn't feel like I was in New Yorker
until walking down the street and ran
into a friend of mine the first time
Washington Square Park is packed right
now
power
I didn't bring my charger which is
really stupid I definitely don't have
enough power to get home maybe I have
enough to get to the studio for recharge
come on give me that do it
oh yeah you never let me down boost the
door hi honey is the baby up okay I'll
come home now I just stopped by the
studio because my um hi Francine I just
my skateboard battery died it doesn't
matter how nice of the day it is out
doesn't matter that I absolutely don't
need to be here I'm in this office on my
shoe there's all this work I could be
doing today is literally an off day a
vacation day a family day and I'm
fantasizing about work it's it's time to
get out of here wedding-dress shopping
again stress out will we peed outside
that furniture shopping that we tried to
do yesterday or last week or whenever
that was and we never actually did it
more of that today
what is mommy doing in there Francine
what's she doing
let's go to restoration Barbara and I'm
not trying to rush us but is the next or
the last store maybe Candace in the last
five episodes we've been in the city on
a weekend
we've spent it shopping mostly for
furniture yeah but what have we actually
bought nothing that's probably worse
than if we bought stuff
you're so indecisive it's one block this
way
it has to do with being a Libra that's
what the problem is one more sir yeah
what are you doing in there friend yeah
I see you what are you doing
I know I know Candace said to stores ago
was our last store but this is our last
store in the store we get to go home we
get the pillows this is so many pillows
we need that that's so many pillows
there's more supply all the tools that's
more pillow they pout honey well I
thought house is much much bigger large
black garbage bags that's the only thing
you need painting so why did you have to
it's just one thing right that's right
you don't forget it but I thought you
said there was a list you'll come home
like all right I'm like yo there's
anything more than this singular item
list just let me know I think I can
remember that time okay no take it just
hold it until you get there okay hold it
that's it fun family weekend is over it
ends here alone at the pharmacy I got
the garbage bags
