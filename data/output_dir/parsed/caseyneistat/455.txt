you think it's destroyed no it's just
wet it's fine
here's Nastya
look at that my good-ass the street
Tennyson Francine are shopping own is at
work
I'm permeate the gym rain clothes Sunday
morning in southeastern Connecticut I
wish I was running
I think I saw you good is my mom here
yet hey sleepy Sunday brunch with my
mother she took the baby don't know
the kids been up since 5:00 a.m. just
like that chef
I like it more than anything else are
you guys having an awesome time on your
phones I have to check something
trackback the city now baby's asleep
I was asleep Candace is a soldier
Oh
in there
Oh
can't you hear the something-something
Dinah blow your horn are you okay honey
we first found the client who's crying I
started singing she's not dying now
she's a thing she just wants to go home
you just got back this city ken has
brought Francine up I'm in charge of
emptying out the car last week I was in
California in New York and then we were
in Connecticut going away somewhere this
week and then again next week and then
again the week after I love running
around so much in life but there's a
struggle that comes with it and it's
hard to characterize what that struggle
is but it's like either you're never
able to just kind of hang up your hat
somewhere and have it feel like this is
your home base in trying to stay
grounded while being scattered is it is
a real challenge I'm not coming here to
work just dropping off the skateboard
and the drone it's not that I don't feel
like I have a home base New York City is
and for the foreseeable future New York
City will be my home base it's just more
a matter of feeling scattered like
everything kind of shook up and never
gets a chance to settle to the bottom so
you know to god that's how describe how
I feel right now in life and Plus
Candice and I are starting to get
frustrated with our apartment here so we
think like so we think maybe moving to a
new place here in the city will make us
happy and honestly I kind of want to
move to Brooklyn then I can get a
motorcycle and have a good excuse to
have it the excuse would be so I could
ride it into the city there's this thing
I try to do as often as possible
it sounds silly but it works every once
in a while when things feel really good
you just stop and look around and hey
really close attention and then say
remember this moment I find that every
so often than life kind of becomes an
aggregate of those moments and when you
look back it's those moments that you
remember but if you forget to do that
you end up looking back and instead of
seeing those little moments you just
look back and you're like what just
happened it's just remembering to stop
and think sometimes you're so busy life
is so fast you forget to think you've
got to stop and think you think about
what makes you happy
you think about what makes you sad what
makes you fulfilled what's a waste of
time what's a good use of your time
think and that's that's my favorite part
about running I love the physicality I
love the competitiveness of it but my
favorite part is having a piece of the
day every day set aside no distractions
just like just think time just brain
time running is much more of a cerebral
experience for me than it is a physical
one
seven miles at a 7:39 pace he does windy
out there almost lost my hat all right
time to go home go to bed
