Misquamicut we are deep deep in the
offseason now so the entire round here I
saw like three people Miss Rama ket
state beach I don't know if you can see

great that this place has unlimited free
malted milk balls and that I wish this
place didn't have free unlimited malted
milk balls or the sunroof I think my
mom's coming out for breakfast and then
we got a special visitor and then that's
it we fly back to New York

it took us longer to go the four miles
from the airport to the city than it is
to go the 110 miles from Rhode Island to
New York we just got home can this one
to go to the movies so we got tickets
for the movies not can this doesn't want
to go of the movies so it's just gonna
be Owen and me I invited Dean - but he
didn't text me back Owen he never text
back all right let's go movie theater is
kind of far away well it's on the other
side of the sea it's actually where I
used to live I'm going to take boosted
Owens going to take a one of these here
one of these city bikes where's the
machine where do you pay
why would they put it there are you
supposed to access it Brett as a member
correct I'm not a member they are oh we
are going to see Ben Affleck's new movie
called the accountant I'm a better
athlete fan I know most people don't
like him I really like that aspect I
don't think Argo should have won Best
Picture and the Oscar goes to Argo I
don't know how that happened but I still
think he's a beads a great filmmaker
good actor great uh-oh what's taking so
long buddy now because Owen is 50% of my
genetic makeup his favorite place in the
city is also juice press that's so much
stuff you get a spoon here I hate books
peeler okay the movie starts in three
minutes do you remember where we live
right there
that apartment was awesome I used to
live in this building right here and
then I gave it to a good friend of mine
he moved in and a week later the
apartment burned down his dog died in
the fire very very sad
I'm gonna put this away now last time
they like came into the theater and they
thought I was trying to like film the
screen and boo like the movie so I'd be
a little bit more discreet from now on
hasn't started yet we expected full I
can't stay here all and go I say you're
the head of the Sinaloa cartel Hulya
trusted director stolen cash he's
capable of coming in cold on cooking
years of books and getting out alive
go
here's the thing it had all the makings
to be like an a homerun action flick but
the Edit was not good like it was too
slow the movie was a little slow
honestly like if I had four hours and I
movie I think I could have taken that
movie from like c-plus - and a - it was
still a c-plus all right Ben Affleck
though good cast Owens in an uber
I'm skateboarding humps it's faster I
really want to see Francine before she
goes to bed she still away okay
