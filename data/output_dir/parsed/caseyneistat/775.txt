most people are good people there are
bad people and that sucks but most most
people want to do the right thing
see I have a tendency to lose things
everything but to an astonishing degree
things seem to find their way back to me
I tribute this to the fact that I write
my phone number and please do the right
thing on everything I might lose I could
offer a reward or a threat but do the
right thing is encouraging it puts the
onus on whoever finds it to be honorable
and nothing's more valuable than honor
anyway I made these stickers left a
blank spot for a phone number
stick them on anything you might lose
then write your number in and that's
that if you want me to send you some of
these stickers for free follow these
instructions
