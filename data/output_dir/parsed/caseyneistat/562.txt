you know you're in San Francisco one
when the ship when this all right
Saturday morning I'm still in Mexico in
my hotel room and I'm gonna go do
something right now that I don't really
want to do but I feel like I have to do
I'm posting a new 360 movie Ted it's
gonna be awesome and I want to do one
shot in the swimming pool here and I
have this crazy dildo looking underwater
housing for the thing so I'm going to go
okay this hotel has a really a really
amazing pool for 360 because the pool is
half glass so if you spin around the
camera you'll be able to see actually
through the pool check it out
okay I'm glad I did it so cold leaving
in an hour I'm not gonna do the one
thing that everyone back in the states
in here in Mexico advised me against
doing the boosted board you know I
didn't carry this thing all the way from
New York City to not ride in Mexico City
these streets are closed down only I
think that these streets are closed down
not this street but this street is just
people running and biking this is great
a skateboarder
so I just met a guy who explained every
Sunday they shut down these main streets
in Mexico City for cyclists and runners
and electric skateboarders that's
incredible
I wish they did that in New York City
every Sunday when discipline don't know
what I did wrong but now I'm in traffic
