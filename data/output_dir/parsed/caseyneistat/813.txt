much like the story of Romeo and Juliet
Napoleon and Josephine
or scarlet and red Jimmy's gotta stop it
or that time this love story too has a
tragic ending this is the story of my
love for the Guthrie Beach raft and its
ultimate tragic demise
if I had to pick one story one highlight
of the raft it would be the popsicle
stick game the climax the crescendo of
any good beach day is a visit by the ice
cream
everybody gets ice-cream the six are
saved and swim out to the raft thus
begins a game a popsicle stick
you
I just can't imagine summer without that
raft
it's always been there
this was last Sunday just before the
storm hit
Ã¶and wanted to see the big waves then
he talked me into swimming out to the
raft what I didn't know then was this
would be the last time anyone would make
the swim to the Guthrie B track
today is August 22nd maybe 2010
I was the first to find it the mooring
chain had snapped and the fiberglass
bottom was torn off I did try in vain to
save it that's my kid
you
after all
