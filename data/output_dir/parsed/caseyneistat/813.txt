- yo yo close to wiser
Oh
still works
watch the bike scrub
there's no definitive set of rules for
what's good and bad and with moral duty
was using taught Sunday school with like
Bobby
those are you if you got somebody
stealing your bike chased it down and
what will you do if you possibly sit on
your bike set their fucking throat
some people think stealing any bike is
unethical I don't agree with that when
it's okay to steal bicycles there are
two kinds of bikes in this world only
two kinds of bikes
somebody's bike and nobody's bite
somebody's bike means it belongs to
someone anyone
nobody's bike I mean that's just taking
up space in my book if it's nobody's
bike it's okay to steal
not okay not okay
not okay not okay
you can't steal any of these bikes even
this fucked-up one it has nothing to do
the facts there's a cop's are right
there
still not okay
this one's a tough call rusted chains
flat tire two flat tires but it's really
well locked 3u locks which means
somebody cares about this bag I don't
think it's okay this one's okay to steal
tools for stealing bicycles on a scale
of shit too good
we begin with a total piece of shit the
hacksaw this thing is good for nothing
only an idiot would try to steal a bike
with a half's off
never use a hacksaw next up or bolt
cutters these are good for robbing
lockers at the YMCA but just okay for
stealing bikes we end with my favorite
tool the angle grinder an extremely
dangerous device this is by far the most
effective chain cutting weapon for this
video I use the slightly inferior
cordless version
