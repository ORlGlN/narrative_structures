there's no blog today there there's no
blog today I'm sorry
instead there will be a special
presentation moreover this special
presentation is not for is not for you
my blogging audience this is a personal
special presentation and it's for my
in-laws I'd appreciate a little bit of
privacy because this is kind of a
personal video and if you're not either
Candace's mother or Candace's father
please stop watching right now so June
Stanley Candace and I made this for you
or we we tried to make this for you like
a year and a half ago we wanted to make
something that's a way of us saying
thank you for what was the greatest
wedding South Africa has ever seen
it really was like a great wedding
saying goodbye was tough last morning in
Cape Town Oh goodbye mountains goodbye
12 apostles by lion's head by Table
Mountain is that it are getting in the
car honey say goodbye to the house okay
we're leaving Cape Town and I remember
Candice cried in the airport when she
said goodbye to you June
and then we left and I think we're in
Singapore the next morning when Candice
hatched this idea to bring you guys
along with us on our honeymoon
via a video and that's what this is
yeah
now I'm sure you remember I didn't want
to go on this boat
it was Candace's cheerleading that made
it happen but how she convinced me to go
on this this this boat ride thing was
that she kept promising the most amazing
beautiful weather I'd ever seen
when we finally did get on the boat that
afternoon we were so tired we passed out
and we woke up at like 1:00 in the
morning and there was like no food so
Candice broke into the ship's kitchen
and stole a bunch of cereal
it's 4:00 in the morning and we're
spilling cereal
first stop on the boat was somewhere in
Malaysia and Candice was really excited
about going mountain biking the thing
about being stuck on a tiny boat with a
bunch of strangers is there's really
only one good way to pass the time now
the only problem with Candice
staying up all night drinking every drop
of hooch on that boat now besides the
fact that if anyone tried to do karaoke
when she was around she would violently
and aggressively commandeer the
microphone from them every day every
morning she would be so hungover their
end up having to like play by myself I'm
never drinking again one of our favorite
stops was in Thailand I think was in
Phuket because I got to have a pedicure
where those fish eat your feet and
Candice got to go buy a bunch of jewelry
our cab driver tickets Thailand's
largest jewelry store
and and I saw an old white guy like 90
years old buying an engagement ring for
a 30 year old Thai girl
it was also in Thailand where we saw
this couple in Kandace said that's going
to be us in 30 years
I feel good
Kandice would order room service and she
would just say bring one of everything
on the menu we would eat like one french
fry and then pass out so every morning
we would wake up and the entire room
would just be covered in food
where
last night of our honeymoon goodbye
relieving the honeymoons over
that's it guys
