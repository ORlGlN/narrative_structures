hey Carly class what do you think of my
new vlog I love it I'm a super fan I've
already watched it five times over and
have you been watching daily Carly or no
I kind of binge watch don't watch daily
I watched like five in one day okay okay

you're actually watching yeah the one
that I liked the most was where I love
that I'm on the spot right now to
explain it I just you know in my
homework I promise I watched your blog

Barths where where she didn't say okay
now you're making me nervous because
you're sticking a chair in my face I did
hey I give up Sisyphus was this king who
wouldn't stop lying
so as a punishment for his line he had
to push this gigantic boulder up a hill
and every time it got to the top of the
hill it would roll back down to the
bottom and he'd have to roll it back up
to the top and then fall down the bottom
and he'd roll it back up at the top and
that was his life for all of eternity
it is a ridiculously beautiful day in
New York City today but like every other
day I will spend it inside at my desk
writing emails
I am Sisyphus and email is my Boulder
I'm sick I hate being sick
morning I don't even know that guy
Candice parked on the street last night
and needs me to put money in the meter
so her car doesn't get a ticket but the
money needs to go in the meter 37
minutes ago there's a very high
likelihood that she got a ticket $65 I
shouldn't be running because I'm sick
but I'm gonna do like a quick run to
three miles just to start the day off
yes three miles at a seven-minute pace
what that going for a run is make me
feel better
it didn't feel dizzy and just generally
horrible died finds a little have a nice
walk
have a nice walk so a lot of people in
the comments were asked how I film my
runs I actually just used my iPhone
which the quality is like astounding
that the video is on this stage and then
yeah I just stick it wherever so like I
don't bring a tripod I just like rest it
against a garbage can or thermal lean it
up against the curb or whatever there's
not a whole lot to it I feel terrible
today terrible
in today's vlog I want to tell a story
tell the story of the studio space and
and how it came to be
so it was like 2002 maybe two thousand
three and I was like 21 years old I just
like found my footing in New York City I
had a full-time job where I have a
really good paycheck and I was hired to
direct a candy bar commercial and these
weren't just regular candy bars these
were Atkins low carb diet candy bars it
wasn't a particularly creative job it
wasn't like a super awesome gig but is
the first like really paid job I had as
like a filmmaker and the paycheck for
the gig was the paycheck was ten
thousand dollars which seems like a
whole lot of money you know what ten
thousand dollars is a whole lot of money
but after I got that paycheck I
immediately quit my job it was like a
really good really safe job with like
lots of potential if someone were to
come to me for advice and say I've got
this $10,000 should I quit my day job my
advice would be no but that's right it I
quit my day job I had 10 G's and I
started looking for an office space and
I came and looked at this building which
is in Chinatown in New York City and
they showed me a bunch of spaces in my
price range my price range was like five
six hundred bucks a month can't get much
in New York City for that amount of
money and the places they showed me had
no windows they're really small crappy
they were less than what I had hoped for
and then they showed me this space
if this space was like a 250 square foot
box and it's 14 feet by 14 feet but it
had these two enormous windows that
looked onto Broadway but it was like I
think was $1,100 a month
but I signed the lease I took the space
anyways and after first month last month
security deposit and whatever other
stupid charges they owe I had to pay
like several months in advance because I
had terrible credit I was left with
enough money to last 30 days to last one
month in this space so I was like hustle
figure out how to pay next month's rent
or I was totally like up creek and on
top of all that I had quit my job so I
had no real income source it was a major
leap of day but it worked out I don't
know what the first paying job was but
it happened and the rest is kind of
history on the space this here is their
ghent ik hole you see this was in 2007
when I started production I'm an HBO
show and actually had some money we
evicted the woman next door and expanded
from our little space into this much
larger space combining the two making
what is now like my production studio I
looked through all my old footage and
the only the only content I could find
of this studio space when it was really
raw was the raw footage the unedited
footage from a from a commercial shoot
that my brother and I did for a fancy
totebag company called Jack Spade and to
show off the durability of their bags we
thought we would fill up one of their
tote bags with fireworks and light it
off and then show that the bag could
withstand the explosion and in the
process we accidentally left the entire
studio on fire just the disclaimer this
was a much younger much more
irresponsible casey than the adult
married father of two that i am today
please do not try this at home
Oh
