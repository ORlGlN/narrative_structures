I like what you guys got going on right
here guys are awesome
you
Monday Monday Monday Monday
there are two tools I need to make
videos number one is a camera and number
two is a computer this was my first
computer an iMac DV it had a 10 gig hard
drive this thing was amazing
now this this was my second computer
this might have been one of the coolest
computers that Apple ever paint look at
this thing
you guys remember this it's like a half
a basketball and the screen is on this
floaty wingy thingy then I got this
which was the titanium power book Power
Mac power MacBook I don't know what it
was called but this was my first laptop
yeah I used to baby this thing I don't
know how it got so destroyed whoa
but I broke it at some point in time and
then I retired it in 2007 from there I
got this thing total powerhouse this is
what I edited the majority of my each be
Oh series on then I switched over to
this laptop after I stopped using it for
editing I used to just leave like a
picture slideshow playing but after like
three years the battery literally
exploded then I replaced it with this
this one still works then this which
definitely still works I still use this
and now I use this which is just an even
newer one also I have this g5 tower here
but it's all wired in so I couldn't take
it down I do love a laptop for its
portability but there's just something
about sitting down on a desktop and
diving into worth it just feels more
formal it feels more substantial and
that's why I built this disaster behind
me I wanted to have like the best system
I could possibly have to sit down and
tackle like more ambitious videos I
never really took advantage of this
system I think it's because I don't like
sitting back here I built this office
because I wanted privacy but I work
alone in this space now I don't need
privacy so today's the day I relocate
the tower set up
this thing is a really cool object
this feels better I don't feel like I'm
gonna closet out here in fact I feel
like I'm there's a lot more work to do
but this is a really good start
marriage is sort of like a business
right now Candis and I are organizing a
bunch of stuff together I'm heading to
her office right now to tackle a couple
of boring husband-and-wife things
in this whole line for supreme
just booked it
are you recording me right now how do I
make it stop peeling trust me
you put refueler strawberry-flavored cuz
the red and the red who yeah it's not
it's a special cure are we booking this
now or not are we doing it right this
very moment stew it how do you get
anything done with your level of
indecisiveness it down we've been trying
to book this trip for like two months
now alright then I gotta go okay thanks
for coming by
we didn't get anything done you know we
got to see each other
Candice is South African she was born in
South Africa we try to go back there at
least once a year to see family and all
that jazz but last year Candice blew
back alone with the baby it did not go
like she was crying in the bathroom with
a flight attendant watching the baby at
one point time disaster so she's having
a really tough time booking it this year
she wants to find like the perfect
flight but we're supposed to leave in
like ten days and we haven't booked it
yet so it's becoming a very very real
issue well this guy already know we are
here
what's up dude Ali nice date of boost
jesse is the only person I know on
planet earth who also has a booster
you
here
which videos on the Facebook
yeah that's me take care are you
watching this on Facebook or YouTube is
the question put in the cup comment but
that doesn't make any sense I don't know
how you don't crash your drum every time
you fly it like I D Jesse that's why I
don't have the fancy one like you have
well then like learn I go I don't want
you bought it crash it Casey that's the
problem
you're like eyes of crisis yeah yeah
it's so fun money loaded 60-mile wins
and didn't crash I hear the drone expert
I can't fly it so bad at flying drones I
always think of like making a video of
like sneaking out over the Sun yeah see
Jesse and I made the Aladdin video
and then we made the snowboard videos so
we try to come up with ideas for future
videos the bars just set really high I
gotta kick you out Jesse I heard your
home is don't crash the skateboard
I've got mania if the YouTube community
in New York City is not like it is in LA
so it's really awesome to see Jesse and
to see other youtubers here in the city
and Jesse and I we're going to make
something awesome together again
whenever we work together we do
something great
yeah the new Qatari a because before it
what I'm thinking can she walk around
anywhere
