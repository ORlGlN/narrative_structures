the girls brings a popsicle stick down
to the bottom then they wait see you
seize it for whoever jumps it and gets

photo shoot

sad about putting about putting the
truck back together it's like the
excitement of taking it apart is
inversely proportional to the bummer

yang of life the ebb and the flow let's
