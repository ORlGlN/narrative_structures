the brown algae Theo's the sea yeah this
is seaweed okay I'm still keep eating it
but I guess I ignored it what I was
eating seaweed seaweed every day I want
to talk about something serious for a
minute I think all youtubers especially
like successful youtubers they love
showing we love showing appreciation to
you our viewers there's a zillion things
you could be doing with your 10 minutes
a day but you're choosing to spend it
with me and that means a lot some
youtubers show gratitude by saying I
love you I don't do that I don't know
how to do that without coming across as
being obsequious I struggle like so I
did a couple giveaways which are really
fun but like there's 5 million
subscribers like I get to give away like
3 boosted boards or something god it is
so loud outside the short of it is I'm
just saying I'm not good at showing you
how much I appreciate you spending a
little bit of your day with me but you
are very very very good at showing
appreciation you all of you are

remaining money that you guys donated is
going to three extremely reputable
nonprofits that help people who are in
