it is about 7:30 p.m. on Friday November
13th 2015 I'm on my way home from work
right now in today's vlog you're gonna
find me doing a whole bunch of fun
meaningless inconsequential things that
I really had a good time doing and I had
a good time making a video about but as
for the last few hours
glued to the news reading about the
horrible terrorist attacks that are
taking place right now in Paris and
before I let this fun vlog begin I
wanted to take a second after New York
City Paris is probably a city has spent
more time in than any other city it's a
wonderful place full of wonderful people
moreover I was in New York City when the
terrorist attacks September 11th
happened and I'm all too familiar with
the feeling that is you're taking for
granted your home which is this
sanctuary this safe place that that
you've only ever understood to feel safe
and having that change like that
and all sudden being terrified in what
is your home and that is the that is the
worst feeling that is a horrific feeling
and right now it is that feeling that I
have that I'm empathizing with the the
people of Paris enjoy this vlog it's
silly it's fun it doesn't matter I hope
it makes you smile but your thoughts
should do with the people in Paris
it's 9:30 2:00 in the morning I have a
meeting at 10:00 on like 30th Street and
side to side that is loud tire decide
whether or not it's responsible to take
the boosted board up there it's probably
fine oh how is this legal
you
that man had on no ear protection
I went ahead and made the executive
decision I'm riding the boosted board

there it's Riley there happy Friday my
brother Marlon there was a guy standing
right there wearing a suit smoking pot

stating a fact a to the fact I'll see

you've ever seen this blog before you've
heard me mention that a thousand times
smart man know-it-all bikers are a fact
of life here in New York City they're
the kinds of people who were told on you
in seventh grade for chewing gum in the
classroom
coming up on Park Avenue this is like
the most dangerous stretch on the
boosted board
