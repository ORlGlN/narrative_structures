does that look clear mine focus crispy
yeah
refrigerate upon arrival I want to say
this the camera before I open whatever
this package is this is filled with
cookies or candy something bad I'm
probably just going to eat it because I
need some sugar
hi Casey we're big fans you mentioned
you want to be serious about eating
healthy so I think we have a perfect
organic kale smoothies Oh kale spirulina
spirulina broccoli parsley cabbage
whoever sent me all of these healthy
green drinks thank you very much
they look delicious and I'm really glad
that this wasn't a box of I'm really
glad it wasn't a box of candy
no I wish it were candy I wanted it to
be candy watch this guy load his
delivery truck
this is incredible this is a shot of the
studio from 2007 I won money literate
nice watching I get a ton of questions
about how I catalogue all of my footage
how I keep track of everything and the
truth is I am like meticulous about
everything every shot I've ever taken is
perfectly catalogued some days like
today I get stuck in this like black
hole of a vortex digging through my old
footage it's a beautiful day today see
tonight they're opening up that tiny
Museum in the back alley and I was gonna
find some archival footage and do this
whole thing about it
instead I just like I want to show all
these little clips to you here is crazy
long-haired Casey and outrageous bikini
body Candice Cove vlogging together in
2008 this place is exactly like summer
camp except fancy
cool there is so much good footage from
that trip
unfortunately Candace is like topless in
most of it I'm not going back but I
think instead of shooting a regular
episode today I'm here I'm going to use
all this unused footage from 2007 until
the story of canvas and Casey pre
Francine pre-marriage like pre
everything good we broke up after this
was like early in the relationship
get a little wet
I'm sorry for the bad image quality but
but here's back to the future blogging
from eight nine years ago gets a smile
apparently we're really late to the
airport my vlogging style has not
changed in 10 years the plane is broken
everyone has to get off
the bathroom is the only place on the
airplane where you have privacy
you brought a laptop it's like your own
personal office I have no idea why she
dated me when I had that haircut
you dumped out the crumbs fix the pad
basket
I'm sure plate mixing with a local and
made a bite something watching this back
I really remember what was going on here
so let me share a little context for you
what do you think of these recipes
we had broken up and gotten back
together like a dozen times and maybe
like two months before we went on this
trip we broke up once and for all like
we're never getting back together and
then like we got back together and I
thought maybe we both thought that if we
went on a trip together we could fix all
of our problems and I think I can't find
the footage of us actually fight it I
think we gotten like this huge like
apocalyptic fight somewhere during this
trip and while we're there we disagreed
like when we get back to New York City
let's break up and agree never speak to
each other again there's no way this
relationship is going to work are you
winning
whatever flip-flopping that last fight
away
I fear I'm going after it
oh yeah holy cow oh they're your hair
look at my hair
look at mine Oh so disgusting
how could you debut with hair like that
probably why I didn't want to be with
you this is my hair oh here's a do fall

fuck yeah you know what I'm realizing as
I open this for you my hand is a little
messed up you hold it I like the

arms we have to loosen it somehow I can

taste like it's been sitting on my shelf
