thank you
thank you thank you thank you guys
try not to die out there
no forgot it thank you
okay this is camera set up in the middle
of Broadway during rush hour thank you
no vengi
I'm tempted to leave the camera here
when the cars come I just don't know if
it will survive getting hit by cars
let's see what happens if I just stand
here
came out of the way people trying to get
through here this is an active wood here
extremely active I can't believe no
one's at the camera yet bored no snake
not even a store
not even an ideas how do you leave
this is the intersection of Green Street
and Broadway and this is Soho and this
is what it looks like when the light
turns green ready
I'm just taking a picture
sorry about that sorry
it is now 6:00 in the morning the next
day I'm in Connecticut I'm not in New
York City anymore
I have literally been up all night
trying to figure out how to do this 360
vlog I haven't my computer here how do
you can see it's too bright out here
but this sort of looks like two Spears
that was the final shot for this video
that Roman and I did yesterday and it's
a really important shot and I spent the
entire night trying to figure out how to
incorporate that shot but it's an m4v
file instead of being an mp4 file and
when you convert it to an mp4 file it
loses the metadata that's needed to tell
the proprietary software to convert it
to a flat image from two spheres and
there's no way to correct that and
without that metadata when you it's just
a mess and then when you upload this
high-def image which is very nice to
youtube it looks all mushy so I tried a
number of different codecs to get that
to work at different bit rates none of
it works so it looks the way it looks so
I think like the hardware's interesting
and the finished results amazing well
mushy but amazing I just don't think
this technology is ready for primetime
yet and that's probably why not more
people are doing it
I don't know interesting experiment I
want to do this more let me know what
you think also be sure to go to Roman
Atwoods channel I'll link it below
because he did an entire
behind-the-scenes of our shoot yesterday
we actually see what it was like to do
this don't check out Romans Channel okay
that's it for my first 360 vlog I
haven't slept in like 36 hours
thanks for watching
like we always do with this
