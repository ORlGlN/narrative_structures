today's vlog today's vlog is going to be
a slow vlog we're going to kick it off
with a new segment this new this new
segment of the vlog is going to be
called casein eyes - book club if Oprah
had a book club then then I want to have
a book club when I was growing up books
were my friends when I didn't have
friends I had books a book club is
literally where I just talk about what
books I like and then maybe you read
those books and then we can talk about
them together that's a book club you see
I don't think people read enough anymore
and well I don't think that's a good
thing
reading is like it's like leaving the
house yes you can go your whole life
without doing it but you're not really
experiencing all life has to offer if
you never leave the house books are the
same so for this inaugural inaugural
Katy night that book club the book I'm
going to feature is American kingpin by
Nick Bilton now I know Nick a little bit
he's a very smart guy he's an excellent
reporter I knew him when he was a
reporter at The New York Times now he
writes for Vanity Fair or something the
thing about Nick is Nick wrote the book
called hatching Twitter and I've talked
about this here on this show before
because it was reading his book hatching
Twitter which is about how Twitter came
to be that literally motivated me
inspired me gave me the confidence to
start my own technology company this is
his new book and it's about um it's
about the Silk Road which was a like
drugged website on the Deep Web that I
didn't know about but apparently I was
the exception a lot of people use Silk
Road to buy an insane amount of drug
and guns and poison and human body parts
and all kinds of stuff see the Silk Road
was like a like amazon.com but for
cocaine and heroin and guns this book is
about how this like 20-something year
old nerd started this literally 1
billion dollar drug and at one point in
time before this kid got busted this is
all public like I'm not spoiler alert
like this happened in real life he was
like he was trafficking more drugs on
planet Earth than almost anybody else
it made him like worth nearly a hundred
million dollars it sold billions of
dollars worth of drugs that's what this
is about this is a work of narrative
nonfiction meaning this is like a
truthful story this is this is a
completely true story it's based on news
reports FBI reports this guy's personal
journal everything in here is factual
but it reads like The Da Vinci Code it
is unbelievably riveting it does that
thing where at the end of every chapter
it leaves you with just enough we're
like aah
and you have to read the first paragraph
of the next chapter and then before you
know it it is a downward spiral and you
end up finishing this book which is took
me four days to get through this and
that's it for the first episode of the
Kishin I stopped book club I hope you
enjoyed it
you
clearly that guy didn't get the memo
that today was a chill vlog dick he's
taking his pants off so the reason why
today is to chill a chill vlog well one
last night we canvassed his party and we
were out till like 1:00 in the morning
so whatever but - it's only midday I'm
going home soon because this weekend is
Mother's Day here in the state and I
planned this thing for Mother's Day that
if I'm going to be totally honestly I'm
a little a little nervous about I've
been planning or we've been planning for
like a few months to take everybody away
for Mother's Day so I'm literally going
on a trip with Candace who's a mom
Candace's mom Kenneth his sister who's a
new mom Candace his sister's husband
Candace's dad and then we're meeting my
dad and my mom I'm not sure if you got
all that but that is a lot of family and
we're going away for like three days so
one it means no vlog so next couple days
I am going to be embracing that it's
family time and - yeah I'm freaking out
a little bit so all that family they're
all at the house right now
I'm going to go home and see them
hi Phyllis I'll get Francine nightmare I
also need to get a present for Candace
for Mother's Day not sure what this is
but maybe I'll get this to Candace I'll
figure it out thank you provide all
right that doesn't get me any closer to
solving the problem that is not having
God's hand as anything for Mother's Day
so I could get Francine a whole bunch of
toys to distress
so I think I'm just going to go ahead
and call it there I said it maybe a
chill block I got like ten people in the
house to go home to right now so I don't
want to definitely not blogging on this
trip but I'm gonna bring my camera my
gear so before I go give your mother a
hug on Mother's Day if you don't have a
mother to hug on Mother's Day I'm
thinking of you also I want you to know
while I was standing here setting up
this camera a pigeon shit on my head
right here and my jacket right here that
that bird yeah bird
