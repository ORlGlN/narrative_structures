Francine earlier this morning I'm going

day holds the Candice does have the car

today also I'm wearing Candace's purse I
kind of like it
let's get man you know that was waiting
I think they're in here hey where's the

crazy dollar toy store everything's real
cheap Sheila she loves in here
go buy a hat looks less if you get push
it did you like it are you going
no cars summer streets every summer in
August they close down these streets
some people can just walk and hang out
it's a pretty special thing
thanks New York City
dad
this is our first weekend in the city
without the Connecticut House and we're
having fun so far and the summer is
almost over but yeah it's a it's a
change correctly but clean break I've
been sitting off the table sweetheart
what I didn't like was going back every
single weekend and we need to sell it
it's nice it's done
great I had a salad Candace had ribs I
think we're going back to the we're
going home now hi
we're in New Jersey now the baby's
asleep
and we're going to some shopping outlets
this is how we spend our first weekend
without the house in Connecticut he's so
excited
we're going to go you're going to leave
with all the stuff that's what happens
this is it nestled in the bosom of the
hills
you just wanted to say bosom we've
arrived at the shopping outlets oh I
need to go there because I ripped my
pants from there how do you want to do
this
hello there my boosted board I could
just skip word around and what about me
I'll see you what I'm done Fanta neat
are you away we're there a gallery I
need to get for a nice mugs which story
you're gonna go to Gucci what are you
looking Gucci yeah really
I want shoes good shoes maybe you stop
doing this to me you do it every time I
go shopping these would be so cute on
you
I'm not shopping trip at best was a mild
success I always wanted all these things
and I thought if I just had all these
things that'd be super happy and now
that I'm like an adult with a job most
things I can probably afford like if I
want a new pair of shoes or a new pair
of pants or video games or like within
reason if there's something I really
want I can just go buy it but the
reality is no matter how much crap i buy
it doesn't really move the needle on
like my happiness or sense of
fulfillment or really anything in life
the other thing that I really want is
more time 5:15 I wish had more time
today
I'll go on the 42nd Street well I
thought you get to my house faster it
doesn't make any sense
I thought you wanted to see the baby why
did it family trip to the movies that's
my brother Dean and my kid Owen back
there we're going to go see the port
identity there's a movie theater that's
like one block where we live but I want
to go to Times Square so we're going to
the Times Square theater
come on loose it
you might have to tell me the other rope
I got a belt I went through an ankle
deep puddle got soaked got soaked
boosted bored got majorly wet now it's
no function no function we still haven't
caught up to us boosted's not working
never came back to life
this is a boosted board it's still
automatic this requires Dean to pedal
instead of the motors your jockey
does not appreciate safety ran me into
the curb
you got a Dean this is Time Square where
the kids
lost the kids this is Times Square
here's Dean here where the kids are
let's run out of here oh and
that's why I take it major situation
here at the movie theater for everyone
considering coming to this theater with
your skateboard they have a very strict
no skateboard policy I had to put my
skateboard in my backpack it's not
really my backpack if I my skateboard of
my backpack in order to bring it in
I know the Yellowstone they they
optimize people the movies starting now
expect a full review when it's over
57 on Rotten Tomatoes I thought it was
great I give it a big fat thumbs up for
Jason Bourne
especially that car chase at the end my
god it was crazy if you want to
I linked you out of time square I would
also like to still can't get the boosted
we're going I'm going to have to run a
city bike home I don't have to carry my
boosted board on a city bike home
I don't think I've been on a city bike
since God invented the boosted board
recliners
goodbye city bye goodbye
Kandice send me a text saying get milk
honey and this kind of bread alright
that's it this has been a very long
weekend edition of the vlog I'm gonna go
ahead and end it right there it really
isn't and you know you do it too that's
why you're laughing when we go shopping
goes like this okay I go first and I
figure out all the things that I want
that I pay for them and then I harass
Candace until it's time to go is that a
fair characterization yeah
