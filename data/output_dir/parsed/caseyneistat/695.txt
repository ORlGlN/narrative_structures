the first time Reverend an airport you
had a Cinnabon
I know I happened I really like Cinnabon
breasts stop Cinnabons a little bit like
doing drugs before you do it it seems
like a great idea and then immediately
afterwards you just filled with regret

beach for the very very first time when
I was like three months old my mom
brought me to this exact beach this is
the beach I grew up on parenthetically
we were kicked off this beach because my
dad was taught burying dirty diapers in
the sand I told you that story this
Beach is one of my favorite places in
the world I made a movie by the time it
got destroyed by a hurricane I'll link
it there there there there there

way back to the city now the baby's

stressful thing for me see oh I really
all I really wanted to go do today we'll
shoot some time lapses like jumping out
my bike and doing a time-lapse mission
one of my favorite things to do
especially on a Sunday it's a little
late but I'm going to go for
every vlog has new time lapses I try to
I don't think I've ever reused a time
lapse but I don't always get to shoot a
new time lapse every day in this vlog I
did one with all the motorcycles and
like last week in Washington Square Park
those were all shot same day but for the
most part I set aside some time to go to
amazing locations with amazing views of
the city and shoot like as many as I can
in an afternoon I've been here shooting
on the West Side Highway for the last
like 40 minutes I'm gonna move now
because I feel like all the shots on
getting here are starting to look the
same I try to do these little time-lapse
adventures like once a week
you're on your bike chasing the Sun
around the city looking for pretty
things bye guys see you later

o'clock tonight to get started on this

on my way home so it's gonna be a late
night
