this whole thing was just so we could
get prepared for this weekend check out
the Carpenters in where we can and can't
be this is the most precious thing I
can't show you what's on this side which
is the actual badge if I did show it to

event very secretive stuff on this side
of this badge but the good news is like
I'm gonna be allowed to film almost
anywhere I want to get to bring this
vlogging camera I'm definitely made for
the 360 camera very very excited about
this
back in the hotel I gotta say I was
really expecting the Oscar people to be
much more like uptight

to do which is amazing I'm gonna be like
email stuff now and then I feel like I
got to bust out the boosted board who's

gnarlier than in New York City I'm going
kind of far I would say like the
absolute maximum ah the absolute maximum
boosted board range go see some of my
yeah I do love gossip you go see some of
my homies I'm hoping that boosted board
can make it if it doesn't make it's
gonna get me close a lot of cars though
feel it
halfway there and just about out of
juice can you lay off a gas and just
kind of coast I'm still pretty far

throttle and I'm going like two miles an
hour get have to pump soon first pump is
