two three four I I decided that this
weekend I needed to leave town going by
myself
San Francisco spend a little time with
my older son
oh I didn't mean to do that so my older
kid who's never in the vlogs he goes to
college here in San Francisco I'm just
out here to hang out with him for like
today and tomorrow I'm not uh I don't
know what what he and I are you know I'm
very excited to be here
last year Owen was in the dorms College
this year is he on his own apartment
off-campus kids all grown up
oh and I really appreciate how clean you
keep your apartment
Thanks that I'm gonna do an apartment
tour now okay so the bathroom the
kitchen that's the bedroom it's a good
apartment it's great it is a good this
is Owen this is a hundred times nicer
than my first apartment all right let's
go
manchild sometimes when people make fun
of me on Twitter they call me a
man-child see ya I'm an adult
I have responsibilities I see those
responsibilities through every single
day but I still see myself as a kid see
that stems from my life's mission and my
life's mission is to as an adult realize
all the promises that I made to myself
when I was a little kid
this is dog oh so the kid maad are
getting breakfast now we've got a fun
day planned in the city I'm not filming
today like a vlog sir let's spend some
time with the kid but I should be able
to piece together a nice story without
messing with my precious father-son time
but bear with me that's it there
now I've been a parent for the last 19
years just being a parent's easy and it
makes sense when you have a cute little
little baby but now he's like this man
this like 19 year old adult who's taller
than me and better looking than me and
smarter than me and more articulate them
and I like keep catching myself just
staring at this kid being like I made
you that's a lot to take in
when you're a dad and you visit your kid
at college you have to buy them things
so right now we're gonna buy Owen a new
skateboard this is kind of a cool thing
to buy them
shoes now our shoe shopping I like the
ultra boosts you like the ultra boost
oh my god I'm fantastic it's amazing
nice to meet you got groceries now now
buying the kid overpriced organic vegan
San Francisco hippie groceries
we weren't able to get a skateboard at
the other store
so Owen brought us to downtown but just
been sitting here and I think I can move
like three feet I think we're good now
as parent it's in your DNA to take care
of your child but but when they live
3,000 miles away you only see them have
a couple of months it's hard to do that
so now that I'm here I'm
overcompensating by buying you designer
sunglasses and $8.00 pairs of underwear
those right there in the middle the dark
wolf picks up a promising trail droplets
of blood from an injured elk this could
feed her back for several days unlike
the pop of wolf and I raised my tub or
my wolf puppy and he gets bigger and
stronger I teach it I teach it how to
fight and I teach it how to forage and
how to eat and how to survive but
eventually have to set that little puppy
at the inexperienced youngsters wait too
dark for smooth free to go out into the
world and hopefully make it a better
place and that is sort of that is
humanity and this time here in San
Francisco in the shopping malls in the
stores there's been a realization for me
that my my my baby wolf he's about to go
off in the world uh by himself
at the place earlier it's a didn't have
the right Cruiser and it brings me back
to my youth all right boy nice to meet
you Oh coming to terms with having an
adult child is something that I don't
know I'll ever get used to all right
ready you get dinner sushi yes
we just finished the sushi 50/50 whether
or not we have food poisoning what do
you say I don't want that more stuff in
the trunk
yeah oh wait no bye great kid
have no fear
monsters gone
and you daddy's here
