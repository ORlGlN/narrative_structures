I'm not filming my runs anymore for this
vlog but if you are interested in
running I post my stats every day on
Twitter follow me there and I try to
have like a little back-and-forth with
people that are interested in running
every morning on Twitter after my run I
love that song
today's Friday the week is over pretty
excited about this weekend got some fun
stuff planned couple of quick
housekeeping things number one I've
decided to switch back from this super
fancy expensive well here's the bottles
sure microphone that looks like this the
sound polish is not as good as the rode
microphone in the end like it's the
quality of the sound that matters and
this thing just sounds this thing just
sounds so much better so also the reason
why this sounds so bad right now is that
I don't have a microphone on that camera
at all because they're both right here
this I kid you not the industry term for
this is a dead cat a lot of people are
complaining about yesterday's vlog how
windy like how much wind noise there was
I'm going to be using this from now on
don't think for a second I don't realize
just how absurd this looks I know that
there's a difference between this
picture and this picture that's because
this camera is just like a canon rebel
it's like their least expensive camera
that shoots video whatever and this is
the 70d which is a much better camera
but I broke the audio ports on this
camera so I'm using this camera right I
don't know if you can tell the
difference
this showed up in the mail today I'm 99%
sure I know what it is boosted to back
from the shot yo I just got my he's
listening to Justin Bieber some users
know I like Justin Bieber - so now I I
just have my boosted board back from the
shop you wanted to get a smoothie with
me yeah definitely go so how do you
ridden it yet
all right you're on boosted - okay
that's this guy don't forget to break
hi I'm Casey
thank you Sam I'm vlogging right now I'm
watching your blog before I'm walking to
work right now good luck at world thank
you you so something you should know
about Oscar is that he was a what
national champion skier more of an
Eastern Conference champion and anything
he is an Eastern Conference camp
champion skier so he should be more than
capable here well this is tight you're
really going faster
how does it feel fantastic we're just so
happy where you want to like rip on
these things and be like oh I hate those
knuckleheads tearing up the streets with
their equipment but then once you get on
its best thing ever the look
ice-cream headache
I knew it was an inevitability but I've
lost off here
yo you seen Oscar
he was on my other boosted board I
completely lost him
I was Xena I made it
you reminded me of the kind of thing
where I want to be like uh you don't
need motors to have fun but then you go
out there like jet skiing or just like
this is so funny so I feel so in the
moment that I can't think about anything
else
yeah man put a hangout gonna let you off
I love that guy
Oscar and I worked together for like
eight years ten years and now we kind of
we do our own thing but he's an awesome
person all right headed home Friday
night the weekends about to begin I have
a very special weekend this weekend this
is a special weekend because Candace is
gone all weekend which means it's just
Francine and me sponsors the kinda guy
