we're still in traffic we're now about
mmm maybe one mile from from our house
welcome to another very nice cat weekend
whysa sleep babies of sleep
I'm going for a quick run I'm at the top
the Williamsburg Bridge six miles into
my run I'm gonna turn around now and run
six miles home right that is nine point
three miles felt pretty good

Saturday we're going to a friend's house
so we're getting them bottle of wine as
a gift it's the thought that counts
whoa cruise ship
it's so hard to time and so you get out
here on the first ships go by look
cruise ship I don't know if that was
exciting for you as it was for me I
never see cruise ships device all right
I'm headed to the studio for two seconds
and then I gotta come home and get
canvassed and we're driving out to my
friend's house in Connecticut to have
dinner there
depending on how long you've been
watching this show you may or may not
remember episode 1 season 1 circuit 2015
so this is the first vlog entry now in
that episode Candice Francine online
we're all with some family friends on
this amazing tropical island ah I'm in
st. Barts which is like a small island
someone say that the friends that we
were there visiting had two little boys
and while we were there like we really
got into making YouTube videos the boys
are still making YouTube videos and now
they're super into drones so in addition
to traveling out to Connecticut to like
have dinner with them and hang out I'm
going to be even these kids a very
serious drone tutorial
just realize that I left my jacket in
the office I'm not going back
got to get Candice got to get the baby
then we're going to Connecticut that is
New York city traffic zero miles an hour
for about a half mile from our house you
think this is for our traffic I don't
know the other day I saw a cop going the
wrong way down Lafayette for no no
reason he had one hand on the wheel like
this the other hand like this and like
those like sport glasses like this just
going down the wrong way of Lafayette we
all had to move he have his lights on
yes we've made it one mile we've been on
the road for 20 minutes run away run
away here we go the isn't it funny today
some people still have their masking
tape on their windows from Hurricane
sandy that's six years ago
this exit we're not going to get them
anything what 40 minutes late I'll just
say I'm sorry for about the wine don't
ever invite us to your house we're gonna
shop 45 minutes late
empty-handed alright we've evolved house
fat
okay Walter the drone is in there you
carry it out I'm going to give you a
full tutorial have you ever flown a
drone of this magnitude before no just
your tiny one
yeah easy you can handle it okay all
right you got your drone hi frenchie
come play with us yeah oh you want to
run around where's Owen
hey friends you don't need that
propeller back if I have that thank you
thanks Francine now the most important
thing to know about drone flight is that
there's two things going on you have to
fly the thing properly but just as
important you have to actually get a
shot that you can use
so what did you learn from your first
flight lesson
you never harass people at weddings
that's number one there you go three so
figure out how to talk your mom into
buying you one she prefers to go down
hill for the record I don't think it's
good for kids to have grown money it's
okay really
kids don't get hurt if I guys whose fun
hanging out with you
on our way back to the city now not sure
what the rest of the ride has in tow but
if I had to guess I would say probably
not going to be that exciting of a
Saturday night remember don't get a
drone
