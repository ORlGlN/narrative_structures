moving right along here next up on the
lick number 2 here mow lawn also I just
realized my microphone doesn't seem to

there's a special place in hell for
people who let their dogs poop in other
people's lawns and don't pick it up mow
lawn done
ready you know how to make the hose work
to you due to a lack of pose I'm going
to go ahead and skip gonna skip this and
move straight to here you want to come
there was so much dog poop in the front
when I mode we have to figure out who
this person is and take all the dog poop
and put it into a paper bag and put it
in their mailbox and say please clean up
after your dog beaches popping look how
nice the water is are you in a sunbathe
in your topless on this beach people are
going to stare the out raise your feet

lost my paddle but but no big deal
they're replaceable to be totally honest
that I'm not entirely confident I'm
going to complete the list for today see
you later saliva wash the car check the
vest Barragan groceries if I'm going to
be honest with myself I'm not sure any
of those three things are going to
happen today
I don't think that makes it a failure
but I wouldn't call it a sweeping
success either driven this thing in
quite some time
