the wind what will soon prove to be
there my dumbest idea or my best idea I
brought the little drone honestly I'm
just worried about this wind it's like a
sustained 30 mile an hour crosswind
Oh

I crashed it like three seconds try it
again
that is incredible I might give this
thing a hard time because the picture it
takes looks like it was filmed on a
potato but they're like gale force winds
out here it just set it up like way over
this island it got stuck in the air
landed no breaky they totally work I
want to fly it on the dock wanna come
