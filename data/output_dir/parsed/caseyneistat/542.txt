I will say I don't like fall because it
means summer which is the best is over
in winter which is the worst is coming
but it has its moments
this morning is the first legit cold day
of the fall
what I need - I'm freezing right now
and there's my car okay I'm beating it
out here thank you I so long gotta go
get Candace gotta go at the baby
I fell in love with New York with fire
carnage and chaos hope the baby's awake
she'll wait what are you doing you're
watching cartoons Dada Dada Dada are you
ready to go huh
no stay with mommy
getting to drive for a while fall asleep
how is your nap positive
did you make a mess how you did and
we're in catechism only home fancy hi
hey Candace do we have a cat just to let
him in yeah he's so cute
okay yo where's my spotless fattest
ugliest hat ironic he looks very sweet
come on you see a cat out there you
didn't take it out I'm gonna ride my
skateboard pretty great day out I'm
gonna head down to Ocean Beach which is
like this public beach and shoot some
time-lapses because the sky is just
incredible right now I also just wanted
to get out of the house that car ride
was like three and a half hours long I
need some air
doesn't say anything about boosted
boards it feels like you're going so
fast on wood there's my pretty view
there's camera one there's camera two
there's camera three there's camera four
just trying to lock down as many time
lapses as I can it's hard to find the
time to like leave the wife and kid and
go out and say your camera up and then
just sit and wait
my time-lapse mission is complete I am
headed back to the house now I was very
close to just taking a nap
instead I came out it was the right
decision
see how the slats that I'm on right now
go in this direction the ones on the
side yep two of my wheels were on these
boards and then two of my wheels went
under those boards I almost went down
that's the closest I've been to a major
accident ever on the boosted board I was
going full speed
so for a walk yeah noggin garden garden
got
bye girl bye bye see you later right now
I'm going to do something that's both
super awesome and really sad tonight is
Owen my kid's homecoming dance and it's
amazing I'm here to photograph him but
