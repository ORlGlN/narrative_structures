clear funds here this lens cost $1,500
and I broke this lens the zoom on it
wouldn't fix so I send it back to Canon
for repair and Cannon said to me this is
out of the lifetime out of this
qualitative picture of what is it sorry
that we are unable to above level the
service light on this model has expired
henan so my only choice is to buy a new
one but how do you build a loyal
customer base
if you don't one of my sister had a line
if you won't fix this huh today's video
is just a quick video I genuinely need
your advice with something and I'm not
saying that rhetorically I absolutely do
want your input on something kind of
important
this Friday January 20th the 2017 Donald
Trump will be sworn in as the 45th
President of the United States of
America because I work for CNN now I was
invited to go to the inauguration by CNN
they offered to send me there but I
don't know what to do there I don't have
an assignment there's nothing I'm
supposed to be doing there I'm not doing
anything for TV I'm not like reporting
it it's completely up to me what to do
there and obviously I want to make
something that goes on this YouTube
channel but I don't know what that
something should be
I'm looking for my invitation to the
2008 presidential inauguration I can
find it on the wall somewhere whatever I
went to the presidential inauguration in
2008 almost in our Eurasian time
and socio-politically everything was
different eight years ago I really don't
know what to expect on Friday but I'm
definitely approaching with an open mind
I live in New York City and the people
here in New York City people I know the
people I'm friends with on Facebook we
represent the bubble that I live in
represents sort of one or a narrow set
of perspectives you people of the world
and this country you know you represent
different perspectives so that's why I
ask and I mean it what would you like to
see I should say I don't know what kind
of access I'm going to have I think I
have like media I don't know like I
can't imagine can be that great but it
will be something and I will be there
and you know obviously I could just go
vlog it and I could sort of show what it
like my experience at the inauguration
was like but act like there's an
opportunity to something bigger here
what of it do you think you're not going
to see on the news or you're not going
to read about newspapers you're going to
see I'm like what what can I uniquely
bring to you so that's kind of it I know
it's not like much of a YouTube video
for today but so you can comment below
you could email me don't don't email me
you could tweet at me sweetie tweeting
or just whatever just send me some ideas
all right that's it
