whole milk in it

today marks day five five days no dollar
pizza I really wanted to go for a run
but it's a it's raining out and I only
have like 45 minutes so I'm going to go
to the gym get pumped up get my swollen
lift up some heavy stacks how else would
you say what are the other ways what
else what a frat boy say I'd always
rather be outside but when you can't be
outside yet improvise
I use the stairs headed home now Candace
had an appointment and I'm home alone
with the baby and I gave her her first
Oreo if it's delicious it's delicious I
know they're my favorite too
don't tell mommy they're a little bit
I know Oreos are so good so good
she's eating a mango now much healthier
than an Oreo is that good Franny looks

don't know what this is but I thought
you have anything better to do
I'm with that ladies and gentlemen ease

fantastic Hawaiian Airlines terminators

alright let's go home I'm gonna go
through up and talk to my camera from
the notepad I'll be right back
this is a baby show why are you so into
it
I'll be right back I'll be right back at
Kemah tsa's enthusiastic recommendation
today was kind of a nothing day as in
spend as much time resting and being
with the baby and doing nothing as
possible and it was great it's a nice
juxtaposition to what is my normal day
which is fighting to find a few minutes
here there to spend with the baby and
sleeping for hours life like my life I
think life goes in peaks and valleys of
like I guess like Sprint's and then when
you slow down a little bit and the word
Sprint's particularly accurate here
because at the new company we're
constantly doing these like these tech
Sprint's you make a list of things you
need to get done and you just don't stop
the sprint until they're all done and I
feel like my life has been in one of
those Sprint's for like I guess the last
two years which is like marriage baby
new company and it means I haven't
really slept in the last couple years
like these dark circles these never go
away they're always there and I know
that there will be a valley eventually
where I get to calm down and take a
break the concern for me is what will I
do when I get the next Valley
it's it's the slowing down that scares
me never the sprint
okay I just came up here to record that
monologue this fog is so crazy I'm going
to do one quick time-lapse
