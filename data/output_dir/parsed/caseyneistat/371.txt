I never take taxis to work
it's pouring right out today I've got
all my camera gear in here and I moved
so I'm kind of far away from the office
huh plus my bike I left it at the office
is it anything in life more satisfying
if you
I gotta get high
this is how I shot this time-lapse here
I put that cone in the middle of the
street I set my camera up on a tripod in
the pouring rain and then I've just kind
of been hoping that cars will dodge me
do not try this at okay good shot
thank you whoever sent me this creepy
creepy creepy coin mate man does it feel
good to be back in the studio I love
travelling I love that I had the
opportunity in life to travel I will
always love travelling but it still
feels good to be home this is a
liability
you
better
yes
have you seen the craft service
situation at Dierkes office no it's
amazing it's got so many M&Ms and
pretzels
but we got something better for skip it
wait were you at that time
yeah okay any other code all right more
than seven cents to do when I snuck in
here earlier today
you got the code I was like why I every
now and then I come in and Casey Casey I
got to change that to work code what do
you think that I love it it's coming
around here let's that set up this is
going to be perfect all the time
never I look at this shelf all I think
of is when I first worked for Casey and
Ben and the I built in I spent like an
entire day building it and then the next
morning some fancy people came over and
I just started working for you guys I
was like hey I'm Oscar and then just
fell down right in the middle of your
meeting it's not done yet
what this is customized I want to
monitor is you this one curve this is
just for cataloging follow the hard
drives this is gonna be all hard drives
all hard drives all hard drives and the
only thing this computer does it's a Mac
Mini the only thing it's for is
recalling old footage
you want to explain what you're doing
here for my late birthday present yeah
we are going to 7-eleven where the best
apple fritters in the world come from I
okay see been waiting for him to get
back to New York
Apple print it's basically a donut from
several of it it's amazing I think this
is us
look it
celebration
Oh
they were sold out in Chinatown so I
thought we'd be lucky to get one we got
yes please I will take another one if
you show me where it is no I don't do
copy rolls well and advice
that's all you got
five apple fritters you are generous man
Oscar but non credit hey dishes really
need all this three or four you Casey
they really are that good magical it's
like it's like they let it go to the
conveyor belt for too long so just
soaked up so much sugar Doug an apple
flavored sugar sponge
they're beautiful Tim everyone's
different but go still float fair
hello doc ah not gonna lie these things
go down easy but hey they hit you kinda
hard this year this is my computer this
is where I edit my videos right now I'm
working on something I've been tweaking
for the last couple days I shot it on
this thing is Samsung's prototype 360
camera this is the same camera I brought
to the Oscars with me in addition to my
daily uploads I want to make more
content like this this is going to be
like a three minute 360 spherical vlog
that involves literally like a six
propeller drone that I didn't operate
this huge throw the hip-hop artist
little Wayne a real-life helicopter
see that guy that's me see I think
that's a helicopter and this was all
shot in 360 another hip-hop artist
called 2 Chainz
and it was all shot at South by
Southwest there's all kinds of stuff
going on been working on this for a
while I'm just going to release it today
this afternoon in like a couple of hours
when I said I wanted to do more in 2016
in addition to the daily uploads this is
the kind of stuff that I want to do like
super experimental short form content it
works on my channel in some capacity
alright hope you dig it
can't believe you just leave this office
unlocked it unattended Austria thank you
I'm gonna go ahead and leave this right
here for you on your keyboard great
birthday present I hope this doesn't
come across as me being ungrateful
riding my bike home today instead of
taking the boosted board it's raining
out and riding a boosted board in the
rain while holding a camera seemed
really dangerous and irresponsible
I just don't see any reason to take
risks like that this is a liability
liability liability liability look
