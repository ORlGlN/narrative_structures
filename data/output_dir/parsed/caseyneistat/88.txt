that's the DJI spark we got tiny it is
look how tiny is also this is it this is
the DJI spark
I wish there the way I could show you
just how small it is
anything that doesn't do it justice you
have to hold the senior hand it is
fantastically small remember how small
the Mavic was when you first saw it this
thing is miniscule its tiny it is
smaller than the old tiny iPhone this is
my red jacket pocket phantom for spark
look at this look at this
could easily carry this around this is
the 747 this is the space shuttle that
flies on top of it all right now it's
time to get out of the studio and do an
actual performance test of this early
version of the spark there is one small
problem with testing us though and that
is that I'm under investigation by the
FAA and I can't fly in New York City
anymore so I don't want to get in
trouble and if you're responsible and
you shouldn't do it either so I got to
go somewhere where I can fly this thing
safely
boosted board is out of range I'm going
to need a better vehicle to get out of
the city to shoot this video
can I borrow swing do you have a car I
can borrow that matches my jacket this
one is that like the 458 Spyder has a
slightly better reign is just a little
bit quicker than the skateboard so I'm
headed out of the city now I just need
I'm going to go meet a friend who can
help me with the tech aspect of this
video review
we'll mark it slowly with a deck review
I'm gonna help you out yeah all right
let's go oh god I don't know how to lock
okay Marquez just like everybody else on
planet earth has never seen the tiny DJI
spark before tiny like time you like
Mavic is pretty matted that's smaller
than your smallest cell phone that
that's a bomb that's the smallest drone
box that's an okay slide open Marco's
right oh you did not lie did not why is
that Wow
all right some very important
disclosures before I fly this thing for
the first time number one this is not a
paid review number two they were very
specific this is a prototype this is not
the final one the ones they ship is
going to be more perfected than this
number they don't actually have a
controller ready yet so I'm we can
filling this with my cell phone and see
this is not a complete review this is
just a first look to see what this thing
is like because this is unfinished to
hardware and software let's fly it do it
alright here we go take off
oh why nothing is super super steady
I mean it's wobbling but the shock
steady that's like saying foot
you never get this close to any other
drum
the controls even just using a cell
phone are really really responsive it's
just like flying a regular big Mavic or
phantom but instead of having physical
buttons you're using the touchscreen
some other things it always use 1080 not
4k it has a two axis gimbal not a 3 axis
gimbal which means it goes up down and
it stabilizes the rotation axis got it
like this but it doesn't do this right
it doesn't turn
brave man
I'm a trusting that it's cable right
yeah rock-solid and there's a little bit
of grief this is the scene in the test
where I'm going to be pitting the tiny
spark again see slightly larger Mavic
we're going to use the Ferrari as the
subject
I think it's early around five six
hundred bucks its marketed for people to
take tip photos of friends and stuff
like that not like a hardcore little
lesson of film tool but more of a fun
tool exactly like it's meant for people
who've never own drum it's unbelievably
impressive I'm not being paid to say
that but I give it a fat thumbs up not
being paid to say anything either but
I'll have a more detailed comparison I
yes and definitely is that a plug for
your channel oh you should go check out
go check out marques channel links alone
that's it okay that's it but seriously
DJ I thank you for continuing to push
the boundaries of what's possible with
drones this is insane sick yes let's go
