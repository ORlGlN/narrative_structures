like you guys going for a walk yeah
we're gonna take it out of the beat hi
little boo boo yeah yo and the beach
with your brother I want to start
today's vlog off with a little bit of
nostalgia I love that old car
winter spring look how little Owen was
just a kid up that's my sister stepmom
me sleeveless shirt and that's my
grandmother
this is like the first year that Candis
is in this photo series because we had
been broken up before that and that's my
little brother pretty badass this is
like when the beach house was in its
prime
Candace was a cheerleader in high school
we had to get into a huge fight because
Candace didn't want to put on her
bathing suit in the middle of February I
think this Mary Poppins theme was
Candace's idea this is when we had a big
family reunion here what's up oh one
here in your underwear and that's it for
that photo series I think I stopped in
2012 or 2013 I don't get sad for my
birthday or holidays for the new years
it's the end of summer that really hits
me today's the last summer day which
whatever I bought this house like eight
years ago and when I bought it it was
probably the biggest accomplishment of
my whole life like having a home for
owning me for the first time ever he's
going to college next year I'm selling
this house which means this is our last
summer here so it's especially sad you
know that's it that's my nostalgia
Brandon you were supposed to fall asleep
you're supposed to take a nap
not play with your brother hi puppy hi
are you doing what did you do don't do
that I put a break up and I went down to
get all my stuff mom goes it's rolling
it's rolling and it rolled in see crash
into Owens car I didn't crash
it's just that monster touched this
little baby and then it may have been
what was the one thing I said to you
before you left I said don't crash my
car and instead you crash into Owens car
the poor kid this car is like 15 years
old did you do this - did you tell his
boy yet yeah he didn't seem upset at all
did you damage the Jeep yeah don't try
to blame this on the car I've never done
that in any of my dad's cars that had
two standard gears I didn't crash your
car I did not crash your car
well do you realize this might be the
last summer day of the house ever ever
