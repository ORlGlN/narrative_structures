different what today's episode is about
is a little different from the normal
see today I want to shoot today I'm
going to shoot a video Shawn's gonna
help me make it and it seems like a
short video this episode will service
behind the scenes what this short video
is going to be about is instagrams new
snapped
instagrams new stories feature which if
you haven't seen it is the most
unbelievably blatant ripoff of snapchat
Instagram just built snapchat in
Instagram and I like downloader
yesterday blew my mind like what balls
on Mark Zuckerberg holy
I mean it like sort of copy it it is a
like carbon photo copy pixel for pixel
copy he's like hey Evan Spiegel how
about three billion dollars and was like
nothing's marked it works like do I'll
just copy your entire product just
continuing Facebook's
pursuit of absolute hegemony over all
social media in any event I sort of want
to share my sentiments on that so Shawn
are you like a short video about it I
think first we need to go get milk fix
we want to do like 10 different shots in
different locations which was trying to
like itemize that now the rest of the
shootings gonna be done here in the
studio it's not that big of like a shoot
it's just having it make sense here is
the shot list for okay we have all the
ideas we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 we
wanted 10 but this is good Shawn gets 0
now we this involves a lot of props like
milkshakes and pizza and flowers and we
need a girl what are your the taxi cab
another milkshake probably just in case
um
hi I remember there was a block there's
an episode a long long time ago where my
friend and I went to this place that has
milkshakes but it was like a two-hour
line to get a milkshake
it's called blacktop burger we're going
to go back look this is the line noon
and there's already this line that's
where we're going to shoot the milkshake
scene but valleys people waiting for one
yeah okay picture are you aligned for a
milkshake I have how long I've been
waiting we're gonna shoot scene one here

waiting for that milkshake alright the
brain knows an opening and see there's a
UPS truck there all of our not for

Instagram the subway shot went really
well what's left is one with a taxicab
and then what else is on the list Shawn
but what else is on the list besides the
taxi cab
it's not easy shooting with a taxi cab
in New York cities really hard to
orchestrate we just got it it went
perfectly taxi was super cooperative I
gave him 20 bucks all right now we're
going good
this is the ATM scene I counted 10 hot
cars out there yeah all right
just finished shooting the day I think
it's our last shot I have to go all we
shot today outside we're like these
little skits these little pieces of the
movie but not the actual movie now that
we're back in the studio it's like it's
time to shoot like the meaningful part
of the movie were explained like you
know the narrative the story behind it
this is as far as I've gotten
and so I don't know what this is for I
just know that like I need a title
somehow in this and this might be it
maybe it's not I don't know we're moving
fast you're moving fast yeah but let's
put that up you know we just finished
shooting here I'm super late I got to
