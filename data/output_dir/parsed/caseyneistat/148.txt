that's a that's keep Town South Africa
down there I'm on the way home now but I
want to tell you all about this dream
we got to go all the way back to New
York City this is a couple days before
Christmas when you're leaving town look
it's not just my favorite waiting at the
airport
Francine loves it too
the flight was pretty amazing
I love Emirates Airlines but the trip
was not so easy Francine is not like
airplanes
made it fancy
I wasn't so bad but then we were there
my favorite place in the world after New
York City Cape Town
my older kid Owen he met us there
that's uh that's Cape Town there that's
Lauren's head there that Signal Hill
that's Nick that's Owen don't fall don't
fall
team two have lost one somewhere
somewhere well we started together down
there ran up and don't know where the
kid is
now when we left New York City was like
cold it was yucky it was wintertime but
in South Africa other side of the planet
it was summer and I just wanted to be
outside a lot of running been hurt a lot
of running here in South Africa I love
running in the heat the kid and she
loves the beach I love beach we spent a
lot of time at the beach
the waves are huge I didn't serve not
because I'm afraid of the great white or
because this sign says no swimming I
just remember it's on the surfboard or a
wetsuit or things I need to surf with
really near ZBrush absolutely then yeah
we're married we don't party much for
New Year's but we had a lovely dinner
here at this place called La Perla and
now we're going to go but on New Year's
Day day 1 of 2017 Maserati the Italian
supercar company they invited us to like
his regatta where they had a boat
so you watch the other boats that was
amazed about that boat there is going
from here to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil
honey look at the seal hi buddy I could
see how a shark can find that appetizing
though right and we just look like a
sausage
on the way back we did some rough seas
how is the boat ride Candace fine I love
boat then after the boat hole the whole
boat situation was over as we're leaving
compliments of this kid Brad and
Maserati of Cape Town they gave us a car
and not just any car that's it right
there that's the Maserati
so the other question I have is what i'm
Ziff i crash it
what else what else I got a haircut I
let it get way too long
then on our last day there we did one of
my favourite endeavor which is we took
the baby to the blue frame all the kids
great
see mommy
she loved it we had a blast there but
was bent a little bit too much time and
mid-race to the airport to catch up Owen
people are gonna make it you got us here
fast June
is he gonna make the flight all these
people are on the same plane so he's
fine
oh yeah I guess that brings us to like
two hours ago
bye-bye Oh

Cape Town
