I think I see a girl walking a pig
situation it's like a huge deal Bert is
sort of a big deal it we have a
situation
quick eight miles I gotta go deal with
the situation you see the video I put
out like two days ago about the flooding
in Houston and hurricane Harvey the one
that had Candace's dad my father-in-law
in it that's super important context
super important context because in that
video you see Candace my wife her dad
Stanley
explained how he was trapped in his
house in Texas during the floods he had
to climb through the roof and he shows
his leg and it's all bruised he
literally lost his home due to a flood
it's been kind of a rough week for
Stanley all right so here's the
situation
Stanley turned 70 it's his 70th birthday
this week now all the same wanted for
his birthday was to go on a family trip
with his with his daughters and his two
grandchildren the trip has been planned
for the better part of the last nine
months
and the trip the family trip this is his
idea is to go on a cruise a cruise ship
a cruise boat that's a Disney cruise
boat you know like Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck and all that and that
cruises you to leave in two days from
Florida all right category five
hurricane winds still 185 miles an hour
on top of that Francine's been so
excited and we bought her all the
stuffed animals and shoes and flip-flops
and all that stuff just for this trip
that's now maybe going to be canceled so
the vlogs of this week are gonna be
entirely dedicated to whether or not we
go on that trip
remember my sunglasses that had the
purple lenses these ones those glasses
well I lost them swimming in the ocean
at my friend's birthday party
I really missed them so I ordered
another pair off of Amazon they came
this week but I think they're
counterfeit here's where things get
fishy the texture of these does not feel
right on top of that they feel a little
too flexible and this shade of purple
seems a little darker than how I
remember it
so what I don't think these
counterfeiters realize is that they're
selling these glasses to someone who
literally lives in a pair of Raven
glasses and I can tell when they feel
different and these feel different I
don't think they're legit now I did
weigh them against my other glasses and
they check out exactly 35 grams and when
I check all the details like the
Markel's they're the etching into the
the logo on the side and even the text
on the inside of the arm that that all
checks out but I I can't place it they
just don't feel right
also the receipt that came with it said
if there's any problem with this package
don't contact Amazon contact us directly
it seemed a little Shady
fashion shoot
behind me here this is the official
raven's Soho flagship store I'm hoping I
can get to the bottom of this suspected
counterfeit inside the store here this
is not an advertisement for a band at
all in fact I'm not a fan of Ray Ban the
brand that's why I scratch their labels
off of all my sunglasses but they are
the ones who make these glasses so it
always seems appropriate
what's up man my name is Dmytro dot no
limit on that
I'll just go man's on 150 Instagram cat
under school camisa you can count on me
gentlemen you can count on me no purple
okay I've got a question for it
I bought these on the internet I think
they're bullsh I think that these are
counterfeits I think they're really good
counterfeits but I think they're
counterfeit I did that look good we go
by the fonts on the inside so one thing
I'm so sorry we can't do like
all right so they're convinced these
glasses are legit but they didn't do a
very thorough inspection and honestly I
still think they're bogus so this
segment the counterfeit glass segment
will happy to be continued I need to
find a real expert on Raven it's the new
videomic pro from road they used to only
use this microphone but I got frustrated
with her or something I stopped usually
this is the new one they're supposed to
fix all the short company okay ready
tell me if this sounds any different
you're now listening to the old mic and
you're now listening to the new mic how
does it sound better more clear this is
what the old mic look like this is also
rode mic I like this microphone I like
the shock mount look I broke it and had
to tape it but I do like this doesn't
take any batteries expect a full
comprehend
are we or are we not going on the 70th
birthday family vacation that this week
but have they said if our cruise ships
canceled which is really step like what
if people need to get medications for
more than five days honey and you do
best assessment are these counterfeit
yes I they're kind of tight um to the
store and they said they're not
counterfeit they just look really cheap
right so what's the verdict fake okay
all right well thank you so much for
letting us know so we just wait to hear
from the travel agent or what happened
Disney Cruise canceled no so I do just
want to say since since I recorded this
vlog episode it's like two days ago that
hurricane hurricane
Irma has has hit land on a couple of
islands in Puerto Rico and it looks like
it's headed for Florida and it is proven
to be like an absolutely devastating
devastating storm so my stupid vacation
to go see Mickey Mouse doesn't really
matter but lots of thoughts and and
really just best wishes for anyone and
everyone who's in the trajectory of this
storm and is being affected by this
like deadly truly terrifying storm
