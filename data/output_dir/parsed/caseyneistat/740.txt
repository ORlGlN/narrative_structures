the selfie stick what in God's name
I really like my cellphone I like my
camera I like my other cell phone I like
gadgets and I make no apologies for
liking gadgets I don't any possessions I
really care about in life but these
little tools enable us to do so much so
with that I think it's totally ok to be
excited about a watch I think it's ok
Saturday morning today is not a workday
just running into the studio super fast
to grab my bicycle I have something
planned for this morning it's pretty
stupid but I'm psyched to do
so my employment begins in five minutes
and my appointment is to go try on an
Apple watch
okay this is the Apple store and so my
appointment was for 10:30 10:30 to
hoping this so let me try it on can I
take pictures of this whole thing

vlog just watching it with my girlfriend

the watches give you a little demo well
this feels good the notification it
feels really good I'm not being paid to
say this yeah this one's my favorite
I bet you that's my favorite thank you
this is awesome
I hate to be such a fanboy but that
whole experience was really lovely the
guy who helped me was great the watch
seems cool will I get one yes but I
think I'm just me at the cheapest one
you can buy the cheapest one you can buy
in the boy size not the girl size
this bookstore is where every mom in
Tribeca in this neighborhood brings
their babies every day I don't think any
of them even buy anything this is just
like the baby hangout for for lower
Manhattan yes they have a stroller
parking area
it is astonishing this whole baby thing
they do here do you think it makes any
money for Barnes and Noble

Manhattan Bridge to Brooklyn and
probably the Brooklyn Bridge back to

more underrated bridges in my opinion

made it to Brooklyn there is just
entirely too many things to take

a tiny preview of what's to come the
long lens
Lady Liberty there this is the wide shot
of the whole city with the Sun
silhouetted behind it then my iPhone is
getting the kind of generic but nice and
level and clean lower Manhattan shot and
the girl froze the wild card who knows
what that Ben's getting sunset update
and Sun is almost gone I didn't bring
any warmer clothes than this I'm just
wearing a t-shirt under here I'm
freezing starting to geta I'd be lying
