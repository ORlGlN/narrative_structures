a lot of exciting days in the course of
one's life and Sunday November 3rd 2013
was one of those days for two reasons
the New York City Marathon and the
YouTube Music Awards same day and I had
tickets to both okay 5:30 a.m. got my
marathon bib is on just got to get a cab
morning
marathon morning is New York City at its
finest the city shuts down so 50,000
people go out to Staten Island and then
run the 26 miles back that's the
starting line there ladies go back
nobody move when you start running now
we want to stay right where I'm staying
right here
very slow very slow nearly 50,000 people
already to run like a coiled up spring
about to explode you want to try and be
at the front otherwise it's like running
through a forest where all the trees are
running with you okay
this is us this is the starting line
ladies and gentlemen we are only ten
minutes away from the waveone start of
the 2013 ing marathon
there will be one command on your marks
and then the howitzer chief three six
miles of new york city
23 word ago
everything hurts
what
okay hours leave it
keep the change
it was a great race now I had one hour
to get home get changed and get to the
limousine I'm out of my running gear
into my suit metal stays on ready for
the YouTube Music Awards
now I don't normally travel by huge
converted cargo vehicle complete with
disco lights and a stripper pole but I
was invited and I'll never say no to a
free ride
ran into this awesome guy who brought a
black plastic bag full of gummy worms
one time I was invited to the Emmys then
got kicked out but I've never done
anything like this before
there's nothing scripted tonight this is
all about anything happening it was like
going to a lady Gaga concert and an mi a
concert and Eminem and Arcade Fire all
in the course of an hour and a half at
some point during the show my camera
just stopped working and my legs were a
little tired but it was fun and reminded
me why I Love New York
because sometimes there are days like
these
