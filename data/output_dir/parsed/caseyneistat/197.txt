here in town for Candace is going to
come with me but the baby woke up so
late that she's back there PT or curios

the spread here the spread is no joke
photos especially by recording video
through fire break scenarios into
emotional data points it's a simple
method to record it some flex tours
alright some fascinating stuff happening
in this tent I'm going to stay here for
another hour and then when they break
for lunch I have to go home and do
homework T I'm not doing a talk here I'm
doing like an interview I'm interviewing
Billy Corgan
Billy Corgan was the lead singer is the
lead singer of the Smashing and the
Grammy goes to Smashing Pumpkins first I
want to know why they make these things
so short I have a lot of homework to do
before he and I speak so I'm gonna like
cut out soon and go back to the hook and
go back to the hotel to do that homework
you guys live here on the island no
we're from Colorado
awesome awesome me man
I'm headed back now at 45 minutes and
hitting hotel room do all my homework
all my research so I'm prepared I left
back with the event I thought I'd come
meet her for lunch but then I took this
candy at a small crisis and then I
remembered my drone but not the drone
charger and then I ran into these guys
all right and we're just shooting the
shit and they have a drone and an extra
battery not a great place this is oh man
you guys are saving me doing my research
I got a notepad I got the Internet up to
batteries I kind of I can deplete both
yeah what are you gonna do this is more
important I don't agree with you but
thank you
Thank You Carly thank you
total stranger matter this afternoon
gave you - phantom batteries I'm not to
make the droning in this video really
good
hardware malfunction of long segments if
today's episode looks a little different
it's because I had a minor hardware
malfunction yesterday we're in yet
another one of these lenses exploded
people love giving me a hard time for
breaking equipment but I make eight or
nine videos a week I have this camera
which is a consumer-grade camera in my
hand 18 hours a day I use this equipment
and because of that sometimes I fall off
my skateboard and break lenses it
happens if it had been in a protective
case it wouldn't have broken I also
wouldn't be able to shoot a vlog if I
kept my cameras and protective kit but
when it comes to me there really is no
hardware malfunction there's just a
little thing called human error so I
don't have my wide-angle lens but I
asked my friends at the Nantucket
project if they had a camera lens I
could borrow they gave me one but its
manual which means like a lot of my
shots are going to be out of focus
because it doesn't focus automatically I
have to guess like this is what the lens
looks like it's actually a much better
lens than the ones it ain't got no brain
in it so it doesn't know how to poke
this on its own that's why today's
episode might look a little different
and that concludes today's segment of
hardware malfunction a human error story
my talk my talk is not back there where
the the rest of the presentations where
the where the rest my talk is at the
church I'm going there now I don't tie
early now to get there
cool camera dude
we're we're talking here she asleep how
do you think I did with Billy not as
like conspiracy theorists as he thinks
he is but I don't think that he really
thinks that there's a wizard I think
he's using big words do you mean I think
well that's what I was trying to
understand I'm going to meet Oscar
episode bit yeah let's do it
she named chief Robinson Keith every day
I love it take care
today was like the main day at the event
that's why it's so manic like a going
from one location to the next and back
