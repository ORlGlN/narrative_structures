you
so just to be clear this is my bike I'm
stealing just gonna look around here
like a criminal
hard to get dressed
it's impossible to get
yeah if anybody stopped feel like
Batman's gonna come fly off a rooftop
and tackle me but unfortunately nobody's
paying attention so for this second one
the second test I'm going to try a
little bit more of an audacious location
here in front of the ninth precinct and
I'm gonna use every criminals favorite
tool the crowbar how you steal a bike
with a crowbar but don't break my bike
this is the first movie right actually
wish the cops would bust me
for this next experiment
my friend Malik is gonna steal the
bicycle and I'm black
I figured we come to a more crowded area
and I'm gonna be using a power tool
which should definitely bring a lot more
attention
we've got my hood up sunglasses on
trying to look as criminal as possible
so let me ask you have you ever have you
ever caught someone stealing a bike
before never
