festivities plan do anything planned so
we have nothing planned except for to go
buy furniture for our my dad's coming to

because he owns a restaurant and he
works like 20 hours a day just like me

and we have nothing planned
look at this beautiful spring day in New
York City but some of this goose poop no

some sort of secret hidden restaurant
here in Boston right probably button
right right says we're meeting someone
everyone just who are you meeting who

someone literally got kicked out my dad
is coming to town tonight so I put
together a bed before he gets here two
days ago I was flying a helicopter in
the South of France today I have to
assemble a bit
all right I put the bed here without
reading the instructions they didn't
make any sense and it's done look
perfect but I have this many parts left
over sure it's fine
Candace and Francine are down through
afternoon nap that's not a joke by the
way
if Francine doesn't get her nap she's
cranky Candace doesn't she's a nightmare
what is this
what I think that was was they were
releasing pressure that was coming up
through one of the manhole covers every
couple of years in New York City a
manhole cover that is one of the super
heavy metal things that covers the sewer
grates just explodes like flies up in
the air well we will have pretty much
evacuate in the building we're waiting
for the children to finish with some
terrifying moments in Midtown today when
out of nowhere manhole covers exploded
out of the ground sometimes they take
out a car sometimes people get hurt it's
super dangerous but that looked like
they were trying to prevent that from
happening
the skater game in the office here just
for a second I'm here for one reason and
that is to see where things stand with
the construction I have a rather lofty
ambition to finish this room here which
is like the last major piece of the
studio renovation puzzle I want to
finish it by the end of this week now
that doesn't actually mean finish
everything in here what that means is
what that means is just finish this room
see before I can like assemble this and
turn this into the library of gear after
actually finish assembling the room see
over the years I've drilled so many
holes in these walls that they're
starting to fall apart like this is this
a hole in the wall so so before I can
actually hang anything I have to redo
all the walls that is a terrible job all
right I'm just going to take some
measurements and then get the hell out
of here
I will finish this renovation project it
will be done piece by piece we're
getting there having a good work
environment is everything and it's
something that I really really hold dear
and important even just the work that
we've done in here so far finishing like
this space my new desk there it's
completely changed the way I interact
with my workspace it's made me more
productive I get more stuff done in less
time okay time to go home
my dad just
thank you my dad just called he's about
20 minutes away excited to see him this
is a big deal for me in 15 16 years of
living in New York City I've never had
an apartment where I could have someone
let alone my dad come and sleep oh it's
a big fit there's also like a 30% chance
that that bed will completely collapse
on them tonight but it's still a big
deal
