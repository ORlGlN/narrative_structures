yeah 11.8 six miles at a seven 34 per
mile pace I'm on the way to a doctor's
appointment for the baby I'm not that
late I'll beat them there they're
walking I'm on boosted board
any traffic this morning come flying
down the street a million miles an hour
zoom straight into the Pediatrics
Candice's even here yet
I beat her here one eternity later
you're not a bad mom because the doctor
said we feed her bad food
you're a good mom Candace a good mom
whoa we just got her just handed to us
by our doctor we're not feeding her
right we're not doing the behavior stuff
right basically we've been doing
everything wrong we've raised a spoiled
16 month old
are you doing in this neck of the woods
hi honey
today's vlog is largely going to be
dedicated to a behind the scenes of what
I imagine will be a failed video now I'm
not a cynical person and I don't like to
assume failure from the onset I'm just
trying to do something very ambitious
and I'm trying to do it with his little
work as possible and that is typically a
recipe for failure let me explain a
couple weeks ago I saw it's ridiculously
amazing video on YouTube of this skier
with like this bullet here's a clip
that's also linked below I got in touch
with Nikko the guy who made that and I
was like dude tell me everything and he
gave me some pointers and he gave me
some tips but then he just made an
entire making up video also linked below
and I thought I could do that in New
York City - the snow - the skiing plus a
boosted board plus New York City
rush-hour traffic and it would make an
amazing video now Nikko put a tremendous
amount of energy into that video to make
it work
I'm in a completely half asset but this
is my attempt this is what it needs to
look like this is what I'm trying to
make
he used a cell phone I want to use my
GoPro the gist of it is like build a
really fantastic paper airplane stick a
camera in it spin around your head play
in slow motion
boom matrix style bullets cam
I'm gonna make it out of cardboard cuz
that's all I have a little bit of foam
core and hot glue but maybe it'll work
I'm gonna try it be as precise as I can
but precision this is not I swear that
was an accident
precision is not my strong suit because
I'm gonna be using a GoPro and not a
cellphone I have to adjust the plans
accordingly I have no idea what that
means
I know this is a moment you've all been
waiting I just spotted Oscar walking
down the hallway so we can go ask him
what was up with that cellphone right
here that was going off for nine
straight videos I think hey I found my
phone I just think that you owe us all
an explanation of what exactly was going
on with the phone ringer what exactly
happened
well I'm when I walked in there was like
an endless FaceTime so somebody had
tried to FaceTime me on my computer and
uh just hadn't stopped for whatever
reason why why didn't it turn off when
they killed the power I think somebody
else got their power cut unfortunately
I'm probably the same person was most
annoyed by being right next to my
endless ringing how much heat did you
get I got about I don't know 20,000
notifications on Twitter that was my
poem I'm really sorry about that thanks
to some of you who followed me I there's
pressure now to deliver quality tweets
something good they're not going to kick
you out of the building no well it's
hard to be mad at you I appreciate you
owning up to to the situation Oscar I
know there was a lot of goading to
sledgehammer a chainsaw down the door B
they were gonna cut down the door wasn't
me I couldn't hear the ringer from my
studio but everybody else could I got a
bunch of stuff for you in my office yeah
come get it yeah those guys weren't
happy with your ring or Oscar all right
good
did I felt some tightness in the lock
anything in this box it's all from
libtech they sent my pants and shirts
and jackets all right I hope you like
that gear thanks man later scarf Joe
this is it this is the thing well this
is my design this is the thing that I've
got to spin around my head like an
x-wing with the camera attached to it
and hopefully all these wings and fins
on here will keep it stable and then
it'll fill me and then I make it slow
motion and then it's bullet cam my
confidence has never been lower I
already feel like this is one of those
things that seemed like a good idea but
is it working see what this footage
looks like
this is going to be the second attempt I
put a much more relaxed string here
which I think will help it stay stable
that other string was very rigid now
this is an opaque string so you can be
able to see it in the shot but there we
go better why is it sideways see all
this twist this is the problem instead
of having to come to a point which
inspires the twist murdered gara gara
world a smidge of duct tape to hold this
I had to really build out the handle ah
the rope wrapped around my neck
ah this is the guy who made the video
he's in Switzerland right now okay dude
I need your help I'm not having any luck
here man look this is what I built try
to have its level and then you just do a
knot so when you lift it up it's always
at the same position is I think I
understand and I okay don't laugh but I
built this handle I said the left to try
to keep it level when it's spinning and
I don't think that this is needed
because no you don't need a handle kick
look at look at it spin
dude that would be amazing awesome to
talk to you I'll speak to you soon Niko
thanks for the insight thanks a lot all
right later see ya hi thanks okay it's
now 5 o'clock I spent the entire day
building this I said it was gonna be a
failure when I started it was in abysmal
failure maybe try again tomorrow one of
the things that doctor said this morning
no don't touch that
was that I can't give her junk food
anymore but Candace is working late
tonight and our nighttime activity is
eating junk food what about your doing
this kid
how are these guys doing on my desk
trespassing
don't walk in out there get in redo this
studio so pigeons on my desk
