ivory recorded this video like 10 times
this is finding the words here's is
challenging but I'm just going to make
this short and sweet into the point
which is that Matt Hackett my business
partner and co-founder in beam a company
that the two of us founded a little over
three years ago he and I are moving on
from beam beam the company which was
acquired by CNN about 13 months ago now
beam is going to be absorbed into CNN
the the media side of beam is going to
be brought in to CNN Digital Studios
where they're going to continue their
work there the tech side it can be
brought in to CNN as well and they're
going to continue development on the the
two products that they've been working
so hard on for the last year Matt and I
personally are are gonna move on to what
you know I I don't know and I'm not I'm
not ready to announce that yet but it's
easy to get sad and nostalgic about this
because I beam has been my life for the
last three plus years and this is sort
of this is the end of the road for me I
am happy that beam to live on I'm happy
that it's going to live on with CNN
working with CNN has been incredible
looking back at my time there I think
that we did a lot of interesting things
I think that you know maybe I struggled
more in that environment that I that I
had anticipated but ultimately I'm very
proud of the work that we did there and
I'm very happy that that that work is
going to continue on for what it's worth
I'm staying on as executive producer of
the beem beem YouTube channel which is
which is awesome it's kind of a name
only but I'm happy to sort of have that
be my legacy alright that's it I think
I'm gonna do like an AMA or follow this
up with something I just wanted to make
the super quick announcement to share
with you what's happening and as always
thank you for your support and lastly
you know the team thank you to the team
at beam thank you for everybody from the
freelancers that that work for Matt and
I for a week three years ago to the
people who have been there since the
very beginning
I feel like I'm graduating from high
school or something and I might not see
my high school friends again but working
with everybody at at beam and everybody
at CNN has been one of the like the
great pleasures of my career and you
know I wish I wish everybody the best in
moving forward I also want to you know
thank you the audience you guys have
been with me since the very very
beginning of beam I remember when I
announced on this channel the name of
beam and what it was back in 2015 so
this is the end of a chapter for me and
I don't know I'm I'm a little I'm a
little sad about it but all right I'm
more to come on that thank you
