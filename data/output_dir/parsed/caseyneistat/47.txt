okay this is it this is it I just got
the word from the doctor he said call
him he got back my MRI scans actually he
emailed me earlier about it but I wanted
to make sure I could record it so I've
been putting off this call for a few
hours now in voicemail
out on a morning run I should hear back
from the doctor today to find out if I
miss my running career is over or not
but I realized I probably shouldn't be
running right now but it's a little bit
like it's a little bit like the final
moments of the Titanic just because you
know the ship is sinking doesn't mean
you shouldn't enjoy the last song by the
string quartet
deadlines when you have to finish
something by a certain time or there are
consequences I'm not a big fan of
deadlines in fact I hate them but I
really I really operate well when I have
when I have a deadline
today it's a pretty it's a pretty
serious deadline I'm not nervous about
this call because whatever he says
because it's like it's already happy
because for the most part it's out of my
control I'm happy to adjust my lifestyle
but it's like the damage is what's to do
is to say hi is this is Casey a nice
that for doctors I speak yeah I didn't
reach him all right yes to be can to be
contained
oh boy this is it you finally called me
back doctor it's Casey yeah I can hear
you loud and clear cartilaginous life
where there you can run and you can even
run now I'm not worried you don't have
anything wrong with your phone the
cartilage is normal except for like a
little normal wear and tear so you're
telling me I'm gonna be able to run
weight well this is fantastic news okay
I'm good nothing permanent
sorry my sister sorry Jordan that's my
sister Jordan sorry you're no you're so
 up Jordan and I'm not up
and I'm not backed up I'm good and I'm
still running yeah okay
so I'm good this is a huge deal I can
still run the doctor thinks that there's
like a lot of stuff going on down there
but nothing that can't be fixed is
nothing permanent but the point is it's
good he said I can run and Lupo you're
in my you're like no you're good
I just I just feel like I should have
acknowledged you you know this is a good
pivot I started this episode talking
about procrastination no deadlines and I
talked about how I really only function
well when I have a tight deadline
obviously I've had a video in my head
for a really long time the video that I
made for for YouTube called do what you
can't do what you can't
I had a part two to that and the idea
behind it is like to celebrate the fact
that anyone and everyone can be a
filmmaker now because of technology and
like our phones and YouTube anyone can
be a creator and I want to make a movie
that speaks to that a much better editor
than I am
we're working on this movie together
it's like 40% done deadlines and
procrastination okay let's get back to
work
that's not blood it's paint this is like
for an animation for the movie that we
are still that we're still working on
we're like 15 hours away from deadline
it's coming along we're just coming
along slowly she is far more confident
than I am which is good because she's
the one in the driver's seat
fine
good luck tonight
I gotta say I'm really really happy that
the running thing turned out okay I know
that seem like like the best-case
scenario just worked out but it was a it
did and I'm thankful but it was a big
deal for me we're probably gonna make
our deadline and good news on the
running
