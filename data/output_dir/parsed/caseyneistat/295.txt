the hell are these kids waving at
it's like 7:00 in the morning here in
San Francisco getting some work done
brothers getting some work done I leave
this morning so I'm going to take
advantage of the next two hours it's
just the temptation is to sit and work
in the get them card and you're the
airport but I've gotta get outside I
gotta get that run-in ready to go
started I started this run in the middle
of the city and now I'm well I don't
know where I am
San Francisco is a great great city for
running all right
Oh
backing up now gotta get out I'll take
the difference between going on a run
using a short run versus no run at all
after so not playing for six hours today
but knowing I have like that good
exercise under my belt makes everything
cool all right that's it
I am going to kind of miss this little
apartment you ready
that's yeah what am I forgetting all
right let me turn the car
doesn't this car have a faint scent of
gasoline yeah yeah in the trunk - yeah
this place looks like a winner
that's budget restaurant in San
Francisco you're on a budget diner food
for breakfast
it's 9:31 my flights at 11:25 it's a
half an hour drive from here at the gas
in the rental car drop off the rental
car we just ordered breakfast and these
people are really loud or on this
coffee's amazing
thank you
this is a canon g7x mark 2 this is my
little brothers g7x mark 2 after he
dropped off his motorcycle but it looks
like somebody tried to take a bite out
of it and the lens cap is gone look at
this mess even turn it
this is stuck on the right is it is it
stuck in video mode does it still work
it's destroying camera gear just runs in
the family
thank you very much okay the food was
good I would say it was a solid seven or
an eight but as far as the most
economical restaurant
it was like $36 for two of us so I don't
know what the hell they're talking
they're car
if I miss my play it will be because I
stop for gas but if I don't stop for gas
I gotta pay the car rental place like 50
bucks I'm just not doing it my man think
I see good luck on your trip don't pass

brother Dean embarking on a
cross-country journey wait there's some
kids behind that are waving like crazy

green light get back to your car

but on a more serious note Dean and Dean
good luck on your cross-country
motorcycle trip it's a really sweet
motorcycle it's a really good adventure
I hope you stay safe little update 10
after 10:00 I'm on the freeway and this
has me getting there in 15 minutes
so I'm feeling I'm feeling totally
optimistic I got this I'm glad I stopped
for gas I'm glad I had breakfast and I'm
glad I got to hang out the little
brother
all right car has been returned next
stop is the monorail trolley thing to
take me to the terminal no no no
that's gonna cost me
I'm SuperDuper late Oh always fighting
I'm doing
got my ticket those lovely people at the
counter seems super Pro hey check it out
thing you can't write that in here but
you get why that's a little unfair right
well I work here and
I understand all the urgency is gone I'm
entirely home free now flight takes off
in 20 minutes I'm two minutes away from
the gate everything is good I see that
out of the kit because fun
see you later thank you mister is it yes
fat guy sir all right
you're everything I see you on youtube
all the time also okay soon come on I
love that now before we take off there's
something I need to tell you something
I've been hiding from you
so far it's because every time this
happens everybody in the comments gets
super mad at me I don't know why they
get mad at need to get super mad at me
what this happens but I crashed another
drone look what it is good
the drones photos really the gimbal here
is completely bent this part this part
right here that's not supposed to look
like that at all
so that's totaled broke the leg off
there this is all separated this broke
out of here
Aven cracked whenever that is see I was
flying it through the trees getting that
awesome like Star Wars shot and when I
cleared the trees which is awesome I
wanted to bring it way up to fly it back
and I couldn't see that there was a tree
behind me and it like caught the very
top of the tree and then just rock and
rolled its way probably 150 feet down
and into a huge fireball explode there's
no explosion but it crashed and broke at
least six week is the longest I've ever
had one of these things so I can't
consider it's a failure I just think
that just as a caveat there were no
people anywhere near this drone flight
no one was ever put at risk or anything
like that another drone it hit hard at
least you have another extra battery and
have you seen what my iPad looks like
yeah I mean every time I skateboard and
drone at the same time I crash
I just shattered this they can do a
million pieces every time just keep
taping it back together
that's what happened not a big deal I'm
gonna have to get another one we saw
we figure out the footage
you know it's light out now and I feel
like by the time I get home it's gonna
be dark out and that makes me a little
bit sad like I missed a whole day
and just like that it's dark out
totally understand happy to get off my
skateboard I comply but I mean come on
she was on a Segway
