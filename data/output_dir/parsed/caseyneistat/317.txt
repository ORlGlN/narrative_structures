close I have to leave soon
I am gonna try and get out there and do
something before I leave this camera by
the way was was purchased on this thing

time I'll be climbing out here on this
roof
this hotel has fantastic food it's
quarter after twelve I don't have that
much time but I'm forcing myself to
leave work leave the computer go outside
and just soak up a little bit of
Amsterdam before I have to rush out of
here I'm gonna go this decision to go
out was the first of several bad time
management decisions to take places
incredible how might a vlog you are oh
my nice to meet you too goodbye this
place just looks like a postcard in
every direction you look
well I think that's kind of it Amsterdam
it's been real
I gotta go to the airport
thanks for having me it is 1:00 p.m. my
flights at 255 I think that's enough
time I am gonna try and take the train
to the airport because it's the fastest
it's also the coolest goodbye fantastic
hotel room if ever you come to Amsterdam
get room 514 at the Hoxton this is so
much stuff I'm not trying to be able to
ride the boosted board with these two
bags and my gigantic backpack that's a
lot of things to carry
this behind me is a three-story parking
garage just for bicycles
and there's the translation
the machine would not sell me a ticket
cave in here stepped in did it work work

is this the right track yes 13 8 7 this
one so I think I'm gonna make it on this
train
you think thank you for everything I'm
glad I met you I'm glad I met yours oh
what a coincidence
I have to say the people I've met here
while in Amsterdam just I will miss this
place
in a big way
alright I'm on the train I got a seat
really not easy at all moving around all
of those bags I was like bumping into
people and I was inconvenient for others
heading to the airport now
hey Bobby told me I was running late
anyway and then when I got the train
this train is actually delayed by almost
20 minutes now I'm playing it incredibly
short departs in 55 minutes
I'm still feeling optimistic but there's
a very good likelihood that they won't
let me board the plane I'm running very
late time is your flight
that's 255
take one so I list that one I'm missed
my flight
so I did miss the British Airways flight
but I got on a KLM which is direct so I
get an hour here to work and then I fly
there and I get back earlier than I
would have that's in that game all right
things are looking great got my new
ticket got my new seat gonna be there at
7:30 get to go to the lounge get to take
a shower I check my bag but I kept this
gate board nice showers KLM
oh there are not a lot of people at that
game it's still boarding but they're
literally boarding the last person
Avinash wife okay I'm pretty sure I'm
last nobody nobody I just dumped the
entire glass of champagne on this guy
he's in the bathroom right now clean
himself up who's a total accident I
thought so
like 10 seats up here so there's like so
much room to move around at this place
in the sky
thank you very much provider
first person off 5:5 this is like the
dream to have a hallway like this to
yourself for skateboarding there's no
one as far as the eye can see going so
fast right now
