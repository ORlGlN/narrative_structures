it's been about 25 minutes and I took a
shower still sweating for my run this
morning I love the summer heat two
backpacks a boosted board a camera and a
smoothie I got this it's a lot of stuff
to carry I'm like a porter from mule who
a nice Tesla
nice test
okay so have a podcast about New Yorkers
no way
it's a Casey stare dude Johnny I would
love I would love to be on your podcast
thank you for this Casey stamp I'd like
to start off this Monday morning by
showing you the progress we've made over
in the new space
I want to do both production and
administrative work in here so I had to
start with the desk then just break up
this case like and then this side here
to be dedicated in production I'm not
exactly sure how this can be laid out
yet but just feel of living and working
in New York City is how to really be
efficient in small spaces most important
about dates air conditioner in video
camera news I'm going to be switching
from the Canon 70d that's what I'm
shooting on here I'm gonna switch to an
80-day ready
that's the EDD you tell the difference
no probably not the battery keeps
falling out the trouble with these is
when this door accidentally opens it
cancels the shop whatever I get new gear
people always comment hey can I have
your old camera just because it's a
little broken doesn't mean I don't use
it I often need more than one camera and
I don't want to give this thing away
I think it's raining how's it possible
it's raining out I came down here for
well brought the drone down here been a
lot of comments lately saying why aren't
I using the drone
I love the drone I just keep forgetting
it in my office
oh you've got to be kidding me I can fix
this but I crapped the glass and the
lens of my drone keys yet but I'm pretty
sure you can fly these things in the
rain so I'm still gonna send it up rain
or shine
I don't think I could have picked a
worse time to fly the drone there's like
a crazy thunderstorm happening right now
it's raining on the lens of the drone I
have time trying to get it back to the
way that oh my god is starting to pour
outside
soaking wet everything's wet
this is all going up
Wow this is the storm
I live that thing in the nick of time my
god it's artistic
it's intestine Wow this coming from over
there
it's so powerful
ah I'm not kidding holy shit oh my god
look at there for the water I picked the
worst days to go out good God
like a 50-mile hour wind like a white
squall or something I don't know what
you're doing all my stuff out here
no I'm not kidding I'm not making this
up I'm not powering the boosted board
right now this is the wind pushing me
let's never storms like this in the sea
was sunny out like ten minutes ago what
do I even take cover
cut me out of nowhere
oh no problem man fucking nut
whoa weird this or Cobra
I know we're out of nowhere Chile
I'm now in a fairly shady but bad for
your glory side trying to stay dry
stop affording businesses of that
pardon the interruption it appears the
microphone here shorted out at some
point in time during the monsoon the
rest of this scene is going to have
subtitles
now before that whole type what would
happen I mention needing to figure out a
longer-term solution for the mail time
situation I need to figure out what to
do with all the mail time packages that
come
I need a system for all that stuff it's
completely out of control every letter
that people send me I catalog I say as
you can see this is not sustainable so I
need to come up with a longer term
solution for what to do all this great
stuff that people send me thanks for the
shoes Nike so here's what I'm thinking
why don't I just give away every day or
something like that the subway company
sent me then I don't know what to do it
like dear Casey we had bracket Tron
really like watching your videos or we
thought you'd find some uses for our
adventure gear okay look at all this
great stuff they're like iPhone holders
and GoPro attachments really nice then
to send me this stuff I don't know what
to do with this I don't need all this
stuff
scooter somebody send me so I'll start
there if you want this scooter just like
just like a hashtag yo Casey let me get
that dang scooter something like that ah
and we'll pick somebody and send it to

what kind of damage was done to all my
gear in that storm uh thanks for
