a nice room is that our baby oh my god

a Penn Station I hate Penn Station I
hate when people get on these trains
they take four-seaters which are for
families and then tickles like and put
their feet up that's very inconsiderate
okay I'm making an emergency run for a
bagel because Francine wants a bagel we
can get any snacks we got six minutes

toughest time in that train poor thing
Labonte
all right let's say hi to the old man
and then you're out of here on the car
then you're like our uber driver
buh-burn no I don't want your lucky
thank you though
the old man singing us home Michelle
setback they're taking us home go your
feet up
now here's the thing I don't know if
this is the last weekend we're going to
come out here but I do know I really
want to ride that damn scooter now I
don't know where my jumper cables are
because I probably loaned them to
somebody or something also not 100% sure
that you can jump-start a Vespa off of a
truck like this and when I searched that
line I couldn't find any conclusive
information but the baby's asleep
and Owens at the beach so I figured I'd
just go buy some tables I don't know
give our best shot
check out the temperature
102 degrees how about the a/c on the
other have the doors on either so I'm
good now this is the most impractical
car but there are two occasions when
it's amazing number one one there's like
two and a half feet of snow on the
ground in New York City
and number two on a hot summer's day
I didn't lock the car battery charger
battery charger jump starter battery
charger the motorcycles harmed power
sports batteries I've got it work
this is cheaper then this is cheaper
than buying jumper cables
I've got this'll work hey doing hi oh
I'm just too hot no problem thank you
very much bye-bye
all right well oh this does the trick
charge time three and a half hours I'll
come on this thing says it's going to
take three and a half hours to charge
the battery up all right it's been an
hour and 10 minutes so I'm going to give
it another attempt that sounds different
still it still won't start
I'm not giving up on the Vespa but the
girls want to go to the beach so I'm
taking a break from fixing the Vespa to
take the ladies to the beach
I know Francine who's more excited you
or her
to the beach look how good Francine is
she's playing with the other kids
she's offering up summer
neither of the kids want to hang out
with us the baby wants to play with her
baby friend and oh and this is something
I just look forward to something I said
earlier and earlier every year something
oh and I used to do when it was freezing
out and now I'm like an old man cuz I
don't even want to do it I just feel
like I have to we're swimming out to the
raft that wrap no floats or anything
we're just doing it the water's not cold
it rained yesterday I'm so scared it
looks cold huh Oh
become such a wimp hmm you're so cold
but you're not gonna rinse off run to
the shower I know but this would be
really good for this would be good for
my thumbnail or something just like lean
your head back under the shower
no you have to arch your back yeah there
you go perfect
wait no your leg posture is not right
that's not sexy you're doing it wrong
Candace what is you look like you're
about to be sick I'm ready to go where's
the baby didn't go home all right I'm
gonna try it and four and a half hours
he's gonna work going it's gonna work

miss this scooter that's a little late
