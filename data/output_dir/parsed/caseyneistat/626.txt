today's vlog is going to have really
good time lapses because I basically
spent the entire day shooting time
lapses
summer speeds this awesome thing that
the city does every summer where they
shut down an entire street the whole way
down the city an Avenue the whole length
of the city and they just let people
walk and ride bikes and hang out and
there are no cars it's amazing
the in-laws are here we're walking the
baby
summer streets is over now we're in the
park Franny is doing better we had a
little toothache earlier twofers are
coming in
yeah now
nope don't mess with the camera
Oh trying to get home now
we took an uber we probably should have
walked traffic is miserable without on
the electric skateboard going to get
snacks for Candace to me and I think I
just spotted one of my favorite people
in local
oh my god buddy I love that guy
Candace and the baby are home now I've
been sent on a mission to go get food
and then a little later today I need to
do something I've done a very long time
which is to go on a time-lapse mission
around New York City I know the
time-lapse is in my vlogs and be getting
a little snail as the plane
I want to go shoot all new ones today
so it's a lot later than I wanted to get
out to go shoot some time lapse but I've
still got plenty of Sun to get a couple
of shots first stop is going to be
underneath the Williamsburg Bridge it's
a pretty amazing view of Brooklyn down
there and I haven't filmed down there
yet so whoa watch it what's up
all right time-lapse session in full
effect I got one going here another one
going right here and then I got my GoPro
right there
check out these jet skiers man does that
look like fun so this is a particularly
rich spot for time-lapse this year my
cameras are a little spaced out here
though there's two here and then one all
the way over there so keep a close eye
on them I'm moving to location 2 now so
all of my vlogs start with a time-lapse
and you have for a couple reasons
number one it's really pretty and fun to
look at out I don't people paying
attention number two it's like we're the
two most important pieces of information
when watching a vlog for me it's like
where is it and what time is it so I
start my vlogs with a time and a
location and the time-lapse helps like
reinforce the location header location
number two right now for time-lapse and
that's going to be right underneath the
Brooklyn Bridge
Yeah right here from this location here
I was able to shoot like I think six
different setups or seven different
setups I take the helmet off when I do
the shooting I'm just about to leave the
fight for the background but this one's
probably my favorite I shot on the
little camera it's kind of like a
perfect half of that side half of this
side and then the lights just amazing
this is probably the weakest camera I
have when it gets the job done
okay next location is going to be the
pier at the South Street Seaport I think
I should be able to get good views of
lower Manhattan from under there not
sure but I think so
this is the pier here honestly don't
know if I've ever been on the South
Street Seaport Pier as long as I've
lived in New York City a lot going on
out here all right that was a really
good Vantage but a lot of people and
people kept talking to me because only a
weirdo has six cameras rolling at once
and they made it really hard to actually
get anything done so I'm going to try to
move to the room to the other side of
the island right now and catch the last
of the sunset over there I'm on the east
side now going to the west side
all right it's just about dark the Sun
is set which usually means the end of
time lapses but there's one more set up
that I want to get but I think I can get
it dust and then I get to get home
so Candice doesn't divorce me so this is
the last set up this is like a Canyon
shot here looking up this street with
the World Trade Center there that was
last one I want to get that I'm going
home and this is it
somewhat poetic end to an otherwise very
successful shoot wah-wah-wah
daddy's camera
that daddy's camera
