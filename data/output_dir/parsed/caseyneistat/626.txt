first things first I'm not wearing a
helmet which is not cool there's one
thing I know about boosted boards that
you should always wear a helmet
I just forgot mine at the office so I am
headed to pick up the car and then I'm
gonna go pick up my little brother I'm
going so fast right now look I'm going
fast in this cab
and I just accidentally blew past the
parking garage
what is that skateboard look ready
so if she's going on it is what I okay
you got to pull the trigger
and then this goes forward this goes
backwards okay it's fast be careful I'm
at Yogi's no boot so if you stand on it
you're still gonna move you with that
yeah yeah fast ready ready
you don't want to try it tip these years
hi my man thank you oh you're good you
take care guys
when I started this vlog I made a
commitment to myself to post every day
no matter what there are a lot of
questions like what about on days when
nothing interesting happens and what
about on days when I don't want to make
a vlog then there are days like today in
today is the first of one of those days
that I've had to confront today I'm
going to do something personal something
that I just have no real interests or I
personally don't think it's something
that I want to vlog it's not something
that I want to share it's nothing that
interesting I'm going to visit a family
member be with a family member in the
hospital I have no desire to bring a
camera with me at no desire to sort of
share this this is a personal day it's a
stressful day it's a scary day so that's
it I spent a lot of time thinking about
this and thinking what could I share or
how could I cheat it and make like maybe
a smaller vlog today or do something
like that and what I realized is that
this whole vlog I feel like the whole
relationship that this vlog that I have
with you the audience is sort of
predicated on a foundation of trust and
mutual respect with that I thought
rather than trying to cheat or hide the
reason why today's vlog would feel less
substantial than others just to be
totally honest and let you know that it
is now eat24 in the morning and this
will be the end of today's vlog
should be back tomorrow with a regular
vlog if not I will have another vlog
like this where I explain why I'm not
back with the regular vlog
