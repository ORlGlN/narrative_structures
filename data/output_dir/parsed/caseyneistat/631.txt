Sloat on getting through security to had
to get the full pat-down I barely let me
on the plane the woman at the gate was
super aggressive saying my suitcase was
too big and in the end it wasn't it just
been to that metal thing that says it
has to be smaller than this but she
wanted me to unpack my bags and like
block the line in front of everyone
