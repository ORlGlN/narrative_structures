it's 6:30 in the morning Brett this
house in Marfa Texas everybody's asleep
except for me and Daniel here we're up
so we can go for a quick run before we
start the day getting ready to push off
now it saves me a long day of location
scouting this is like honestly what is
that day I mean they say it's a mass but
it looks more like that so we're right
here
this is Mexico yeah this interest is all
women
the road now I can remember were and
this was the road like the Halloween
Havoc up turn hours really this is so
now we're on the dirt road the next stop
is the Mexican border of the Rio Grande
but what we're doing here today is we're
doing more location scouting for Max's
movie max made do what you can with me
earlier this year now I'm helping him
with his doing you can't movie it sort
of begins with a crazy idea where we
need a long stretch of road and today's
location scouting is to find that
perfect long stretch of road I don't
think that's
I know this topic about but furthering
reconnaissance here let's go find it
okay I must be really rusty am i
drowning or something so I can't find
new york city anymore i haven't been in
the blogs much I've crashed it three
times today and I just crashed into a
telephone wire any sign of it village
it's gotta be around here in this rock
formation I think is what we do there's
got to be there what that means boom
boom it's right there
you buy that I mean seems fine just
broke its leg this broke off
aggressively I guarantee you this thing
still works should not explain the whole
idea for Max's movie the requires
shooting out of the window of a cause
it's moving at a certain speed to
capture you guys going to test it with
the stabilizer here they come
is there using the stabilizer to see if
they can get a stable shot of the window
of this car traveling at that speed I
mean that's where it in the animation is
playing in here right that's pretty
smooth it's pretty smooth yeah you can't
tell that especially if that's not like
that's not the best stabilizer either
right if this is not the best one it's
not that we're getting Travis okay this
room is not going to work it's now long
enough stretch and it's not too bumpy
you gotta slow down a little big
question uh-huh
gas station about three hours away I
give this road like a be mine okay and
what do you what's acceptable B plus a
month we call all-weather markup syrup
yet I have to join from hell
touch him right by the neck bite the
head off so what's up a fake oh my god
Karen open this idea that may be closer
to the border there'll be a more like
open road that's more interesting
looking so we're headed to the border of
Texas and Mexico
so not a hundred percent as to where we
are but we're definitely right at or
right near the border Mexico Texas we're
not going to Mexico
a guy we just met at a bar the most
remote bar in all of Texas according to
him is taking us 200 feet this way to
the Mexican American border there's no
law enforcement here keith is the only
law enforcement is that water escort
cartel but he says that would no sense
of irony before such spasm the river is
over there behind that tree
so where's Mexico that's Mexico sit the
tree with limbs off of it let's make
showing this out of the Texas Mexico
Texas Mexico Mexico call text browsing
its mobile plan are we in Mexico look
like going to use
it's on candy
that better right there yeah
bring the tech waited every day morning
fun where's the warning sign right here
now you do have to say that it says
warning allele the care farm in New
Mexico oh wait we can't but we can't do
think oh dude I already got a references
turn out yet remember football you let
you far turn around
pull why did you take us all the way
down here can we turn around here it's a
double yellow I'm a tall up there we're
here because you can't go any further
south and the Continental why Mexico why
is that important why is that relevant
here move it the whole idea is that the
road we're going to pick a road that's
going to tell us a story and the only
way we can see that story is by
traveling around is traveling on that
road and the story that that road is
going to tell us is about where it is in
the world and this this road that's
right here basically on the us-mexico
border has a lot of stories to tell
good bad drugs immigration buffalo
soldiers Pancho via there's I mean pick
your poison there are a million things
that happen on these roads right here in
this part of America and like I think
they have something to tell
back there like Border Patrol's here we
go
next why are you filming um I got a guy
got to get this at all cost
I'll pass where you'll like me I'm not
insured miss party is Daniel his lights
aren't on yet
back off take the blade prong angled
over
I have no I had no idea pass out though
for stopping speed sir something off
brown yeah hi guys super friendly police
officer here give us a warning but
there's one small problem with the
insurance the rental we should be fine
we're back at the house right now
and today's pre-production when I think
very well we've got like a pretty tight
Tamela what we're doing here
Dylan helping us writing this is Max
Vidya Max's video and I'm this kind of
like this is a big movie where max can
have done in two months the goal is to
make it like Max's do what you can't
story like his story just really is just
really cool yeah I don't know I don't
want to say too much I just want like I
think it's really cool yeah it's super
ambitious it's going to be amazing
alright that's it is tomorrow and we're
related Martha
