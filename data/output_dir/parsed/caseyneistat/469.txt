just a super quick update the nice that
family has been doing an incredible job
of murdering this gigantic bucket of
Nutella here not bad not bad that's a
significant gap right there
we will have that thing empty by the end
of the week okay bye guys I've kind of
been freaking out a little bit because
work work is my life it's like my
lifeline it's like my energy source my
happiness source work is my everything
and since we got to Los Angeles there's
just been so many variables like getting
situated and the house and Candis has
been sick the baby has been sick oh and
just got here I haven't been as
productive as I normally am productivity
equals happiness a lack of productivity
for me equals I don't know somewhere
between absolute frustration and rage
since I've been in Los Angeles I've been
hovering somewhere between the two
but that's going to change this morning
I'm on my way right now to meet a friend
of mine named Ryan holiday you should
look him up and I are meeting to discuss
this really big ambitious project that
we are just now embarking on hey doing
right thank you very much yeah
welcome to Los Angeles stop ma'am do you
think you have to ask permission to sit
here we have commandeered this very
private
almost cabana style area at this fancy
hotel for our business meeting I realize
I'm being a little bit sketchy about not
saying we're actually doing but it's
going to be big it's gonna be exciting
and this is Ryan right
you
you feel good about good walking out
right now I'll walk out of you all right
cute awesome to see you see you I'll see
you tomorrow morning they'll run all
right all right yeah you guys are
awesome what are you guys doing out here
good luck keep dancing
bye girls
god I feel so much better so it's a
really just stimulating fantastic
conversation that really contextualized
the project that he and I are about to
do there's one thing that I wrote down
with Ryan is said to me before and this
is like a known that people say but
never let perfect be the enemy of good
enough that principle really articulates
what these vlogs are for me prior to
vlogging I used to put out maybe a movie
a month or something like that and my
excuse for not being more prolific was
always that I want what I make to be
perfect and I guess if you're Stanley
Kubrick or Quentin Tarantino there is
validity in that argument but in
retrospect that argument was just an
excuse for me to not make more by no
longer letting myself embrace that
excuse I've forced myself to be more
prolific it was via that proliferation
via that increased output of my own
medium is movies then I found my voice
and I found I think a renewed passion
for what has been my craft great beating
there's like this
oh sorry in original oh hey Matt this
gay porn inside you can see who you is
