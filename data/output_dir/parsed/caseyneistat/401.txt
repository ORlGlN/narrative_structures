still it's still ringing one two three
fuck Saturday morning in the nice stat
household I think maybe we're gonna take
the little one out to breakfast now
this place has toys for the baby
Candace and I take turns like a tag-team
operation she watches the baby and I eat
and I watch the baby and she's nice
balancing job Francine oh yeah
hey mom do
how was your breakfast
my love you
my beauty
baby is down for a noon nap I'm sneaking
in the office quickly to get a little
bit of work done I'd also love to get a
babysitter so Candace and I could go out
tonight but also don't think that's
going to happen
also the cameras in the telephone booth
right now see it's always more fun to
feature the new construction like the
new red wall and mining desk and my
second new desk what's a lot less sexy
to talk about is the deconstruction
that's happening for example back in my
my former office here this whole wall
which used to be beautiful had the
speakers up here decimated in fact this
entire office has just been like
destroyed this office is going to be the
apex of the new studio design so it's
going to be the most destroyed the most
broken down before it gets built back up
right now we're attacking the easy
things the desk the wall should be done
very soon this area here all should be
done soon the very last thing we're
going to tackle the last thing we're
going to take on the room in the back
this is an opaque projector you're
taking image of damage inside here it's
supposed to project that image on
whatever's in front of it but it's not
strong it doesn't work okay yeah
this is a multimedia projector this
should work you should want to have to
move it
sweet feel pretty good about this to do
a nice molding by the play button here
but I need the wood to be black
underneath it so I'm cheating it with
just a little bit of paint ah nice nice
alright gotta get home that was some
good progress though studio renovations
is like it's like chopping down a
gigantic oak tree you go with like chip
chip chip away in it and eventually the
entire tree will fall I think if I can
get in there tomorrow by Monday I will
have like cross the precipice from
construction site to something that
feels look at this light look at that
you can't see it up up the roof
Wow look at this light it's incredible
here here's an amazing time-lapse
isn't that crazy that's like real that's
not even CGI I got really cold while
shooting that time-lapse alright going
home now
I told Candace I needed to run to work
for a minute that was four and a half
hours ago so I'm not entirely sure what
I'm walking into here can't wait you
have to be in the show can't look how do
I see look at the lighting candles Casey

babysitter for like one hour so this is
gonna be a super fast date night

cosmetic store okay come on let's go
