don't show hands now
so hands up
good afternoon well first of all I thank
all of the local elected officials that
are with us for the past several days
we've all been deeply troubled by this
crisis as a pain of last weekend's
tragedy has been compounded by days of
brief and nights of conflict and fear I
understand that the anger fear that the
citizens of Ferguson are feeling and our
police officers will respect both of
those thank you
should we say a different different tone
of the amplitude of protective force my
sense is that will have an effect and I
know the operational teams on the ground
and working on some of those changes
anyway and I appreciate that you answer
for them I harbor no markets we're gonna
get plenty questions here
the judge I'm a witness
we out keep them up that horn
you
you
