oh my god
you
ooh
seven miles this morning fast plus a
little weight training Wednesday workout
I was rifling through all the mail time
packages this morning looking for snacks
I did find these like coffee candy bar
granola bar things but also found this
box not sure who it's from also didn't
know you could mail this stuff beer
fancy beer fancier beer fanciest beer
it's like an entire box filled up with
hooch I'm not much of a drinker
but thank you now as promised I wanted
to do this yesterday I just couldn't
find the time Q&A Q&A with Candice you
you have to go to youtube and bring up
the video and so we can pull up
questions from it where did you get this
where I gave it to me but look when you
turn it he's here we're trying to report
isn't that cool
alright on the episode two days ago
Candice said that she wanted to do a QA
so I told people to ask questions in the
comments below okay so some questions do
you two plan on having more children in
the future what like that Candice do you
ever feel like vlogging gets in the way
of having a normal relationship with
Casey that's a loaded question yes
would you like to expand on that lady
well there's a third person in our
relationship and that third person is 1
million people yeah well yeah what did
you major in in college advertising
advertising does Candice get stopped in
the street much because of these videos
well Candice doesn't but Casey's wife
does what does that mean hey Casey's
wife Casey do you ever edit at home with
the family or does it happen in the
studio I actually do all my editing at
home but not with the family what my
ending I do that at home hmm
but like not with you and Francine
sitting on on your lap oh I do edit with
the baby
I do edit with the baby on my lap but I
think what they mean is do you ever edit
at home when we're there so that you're
paying attention to your edits and not
us no yeah I don't like do I'd never
sacrifice family time for editing
why does Candace always look upset I
don't know how to answer that I'm always
thinking about something other than
whatever is in front of me I will say
all the comments for Candace are like
why doesn't she smile she should smile
for they're almost always from men and I
think this expectation that women are
always supposed to smile pretty is like
bull shun guy said why don't I wear
makeup she's got a business to run
makeup will you ever make a line of nice
fat glasses and sell them
I don't know but Candace is making it's
a little holdup look at this look at
look at this thing this thing not look
at this okay those are actual sunglasses
but that's a KC sunglass can people buy
those mm-hmm online my nerve session is
calm okay I'll put the link below bye
Candace's KC sunglass case by Candace's
KC sunglass necklace who shat in
Candace's cornflakes I don't even eat
cornflakes how do you Candice date you
with that weird terrible hair not trying
to be rude I love your actual hair is it
weird and terrible no you're great hair
I'm not great hair you have perfect
curls
why don't you two say I love you when
you leave each other it's not that we
don't say that it's not that we don't
kiss watch it's just I choose not to
share it because there's like a level
MYOB yeah because and your own beeswax
we don't kiss on camera because of M
Oh be alright I hope you enjoyed this
questions and answers with canvas giving

Bonnie oh good day see you later

oh my god
it's unbelievable
okay I can't reveal any details for
reasons I hope are obvious but I'm
rushing home beautiful day I send the
drone up for two seconds
I accidentally land it somewhere where
should not have landed and then
recovered it like I just believe up
caught up there recovered it hold on a
second
yeah you becoming a regular yeah and I
got the damn drone back you sitting up
there
it's City man not a lot of time not a
lot of time at all my packing theory
goes like you always pack the most
important things first you start with
the things you absolutely cannot live
without and then after that you put the
less and less important things so for me
for example I start with the drone and
then I put in underwear and then I put
in socks and I put in t-shirts and I put
in like all that other stuff ok got
everything now I just gave you at the
airport that wasn't so bad this security
lines a little long though
security at the airport's really really
stepped up they got cops there's
military here tsa is on it I just want
to say I really appreciate it
welcome in your kool-aid all right nice
to meet you guys I do thank you welcome
to New York he's making one and well I'm
not like the first person I'm not the
last person I'm like the Middle East
middle person getting on this planet

unpleasant odor thank you very much all
