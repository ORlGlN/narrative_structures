I what the is this that's not what
it looks like when you take a bite
that's like look what's inside the body
you know it's like when they show your
part
oh no photos okay sorry I'm so hungry
first up is the eb burger with an egg
we'll make like a coconut shrimp
it's kind of sweet very disgusting
I don't know how would you describe it
like a fish stick with an egg mcmuffin
from Dunkin Donuts like the egg patty
fish stick with an egg honey a fish
stick with a microwave egg on it on a
scale like one to take me to the
hospital it's like a 5 next up on our
item a review list is this corn and
mushroom McDonald soup
we me this kiss they're really digging
on the wrapping paper here sort of looks
like the regular make chicken
although considerably more Brown
yeah it sort of looks like that looks
like the bottom of somebody's foot
this is delicious
last but not least the crown jewel a
purple delight and a golden shell sweet
taro pie it tastes a little bit like
children's face
this includes our restaurant review I
think this week terrifies a total
failure failure to explain what exactly
it is
photos it's not photos
you
