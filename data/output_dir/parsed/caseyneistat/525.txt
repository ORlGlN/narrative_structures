I'm just talking on camera here don't
mind just talking about Houston it is
said Wow
it's 7:00 a.m. I'm in San Antonio Texas
right now I'm here doing a speaking
engagement later this morning and I'm
not very long it's kind of a bummer
whoa it's rainy on out the weather here
is incredible I think my talk is at like
10 a.m. or 9 a.m. this morning but right
now I have to go make sure everything
works
I'm Casey I saw the come here at 7:00
hey hey REI nice to meet you
go fast fantastic this is my computer
stuff here that's the screen where my
videos are going to play yo this little
booth
as this guy's in trouble they are that's
a penalty that's right yes I figure like
that
so yeah
whoa
it is swampy and humid out here all
right my talk is in like 42 minutes
feeling good feeling confident
Casey nice dad is one interesting guy
when we're looking for a speaker for
this gathering you know you start doing
your research you get online you look at
their videos whatever
and I'm not want to sit around and you
know look at videos but I got hooked on
Casey so that further adieu Casey nice
side come on one eternity later come on
okay talk to that it went well but it's
an absolutely wonderful I'm Carol I
appreciated Carol having photography
listening to you in your video very nice
thank you so much thank you so much
alright was it good talk that talk was
the whole reason why I came to San
Antonio that's the reason why I'm down
here and that's it now I'm done so now I
leave San Antonio where's that run
around here
where should I run no help from the
gentlemen at the hotel I'm just gonna
run in one direction then turn around
and I'm back
alright that was just over five miles at
just under an eight minute pace I was
also the first time I've run since the
marathon my legs are extremely heavy
this morning I haven't run in humidity
like that since like since July
leaving this hotel for good back to the
airport that's got to be for me so we're
just going to the airport thanks a lot
okay I never know if I'm supposed to tip
those guys or not like it's an expensive
car service that I'm not paying for but
do I tip them I'm not flying American
Airlines here because it was either a
direct flight on United that takes one
hour or I fly on American with a layover
and it takes five hours
sorry American
okay next stop
here's one of my favorite travel tips
always travel with a small bag
and have that bag on a small carabiner
like this then you'll clip your bag
anywhere
then you have one place to put all your
loose stuff it's in your pockets
the wheels are going to leave first one
off the plane
I'm not in New York City I'm in Houston
have a good night I wonder how many
nights a year I spend in hotels versus
how many nights a year I spend in my
actual home there's a situation I'm in
Houston Texas hiding behind a wall
because my uber driver was just driving
me home from the grocery store to the
hotel and they're like these dudes in
the street like punching a car will
excitement for the end of the night
