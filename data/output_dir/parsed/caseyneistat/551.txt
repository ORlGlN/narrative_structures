to embrace it I wanted to take advantage
of this morning so I'm gonna go for a
run right now

nostalgia remembering the first time I
ever came to Spain it was the first time
I ever travelled I was 18 or 19 years
old I was still washing dishes in
Connecticut I hadn't moved to New York
City yet and I spent like nine months
saving up but I saved up I think was
like eleven hundred bucks and that was
my total budget for this trip that my
older brother van and I planned to
Europe and we spent a lot of time in
Spain feels like forever ago I was like
I kid that I had no idea what I was
doing the sun's coming out I'm back
that's my hotel that's my room good run

so jet-lagged and tired from the trip
and then I deleted all my footage that
was like running around there was issues
with my other hotel so I switched this
hotel I was really frustrated but on
that run this morning just made me put
