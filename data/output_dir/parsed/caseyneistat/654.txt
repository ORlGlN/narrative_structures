potatoes is like a vegetable or
something

6:30 a.m. on a Saturday New London
Connecticut going for a run with my
friend Peter get it in yeah we're
getting it in all right this is Peter's
idea this is a beautiful view of
Connecticut and this is a view of Peter
taking a piss so they call it a wildlife
sanctuary but it's actually where the
nuclear power plant is all right these
signs are a little bit more aggressive
but you can still run back there it's
just like the trail just continues you
just have to go around this looks much
more criminal than it actually is all
right and then this here is where I feel
like you have to turn around because
beyond this is where there's like a
security checkpoint I don't want to
break any actual laws how many miles
into here 7 1/2 so this will probably be
a nice 15 mile run and we're back
fourteen point four fourteen point four
miles pretty good run a fourth of July
all right good run man safe drive home
for July 4th we're going to take the
truck off-roading just got to get it
ready
better yes I'm sitting right here
waiting for you my dear okay so we're
going off-roading in these trails behind
Target three concerns number one we
don't have a spare tire
these BF Goodrich all-terrain tires
should be called some terrain because
when you take them on all terrains they
explode number two two times ago we were
out riding these trails we were stopped
by the police and got into some trouble
free the very last time we were out
there I actually crashed the Jeep into a
swamp then we had to get towed out those
are some of the variables we're dealing
with may I please have the 1/3 pound
triple with cheese and bacon just a
sandwich and then the Baconator fries
too
describe it as healthy Oh on a scale of
one to help you where would you put that
fat
I can't be good to the paintjob
house just get on the tree
you
second
in my face
yes seems to be a sound coming from the
motor are you laughing at thinking that
tre well we got to get across this river
somehow I'm more concerned with which
river to traverse let's try this way
this looks deep Oh God all right
that's the way out of there should we
leave or do one more which we should
probably go right we've done a lot I was
thinking we do one more oh really
what the hell are we and now a
restaurant review by owning KC today we
will be reviewing Taco Bell's captain
Captain Crunch delights made with
Captain Crunch crunch berries hi hi
could I please have a four pack of Cap'n
Crunch delights nothing else okay and
that'll do it we don't always eat at
fast food just mostly eat at fast food
it's our family time
it's our family sorry I didn't mean to
be so far away
they
you know her good that's it she said she
liked our Jeep so I said thank you
ladies love this car expectations of the
captain crunch balls gonna be okay
you think they're gonna be good Wow
that color is not flattering this is
what they look like uh really describe
the look it looks like a dead tomato
when I eat this I picture a baker
hovering over the dough for doughnuts
and in his right hand as a gigantic 1
gallon jar of just something that's
called artificial red flavoring and he
sneezes and dumps the entire jar of
artificial flavoring into the doughnut
bucket and then he's just like yeah get
and then he goes on and makes the
doughnuts anyways that's what these
taste like do you think that's accurate
mm-hmm and that is a food review from
Casey and Owen Oh gross look it who's
all over my pants starting to make me
sick okay let's go
Owen and I are gonna go watch TV do you
mind watching the car before you come in
going mutton is cool and all but you
just get home and then have to wash the
car it's not really that fun

you my dear
