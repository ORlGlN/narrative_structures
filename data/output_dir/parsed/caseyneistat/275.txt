one lot of lettuce
taking the lettuce out
it's not that but it's not good it's
like bouncy and fresh tastes like it
straight out of the ocean nothing else
in there but lobster clean just so much
lobster meat and deliciousness cleans a
good word the lettuce flavor is
overwhelming the meat is the sort of wet
and a little bit mealy and it has a
slightly fifth-year taste not to be too
critical but I can taste what frozen
stuff that's been thought out tastes
like that's what you're dealing with
that is the Nick lobster I'm not even
halfway through I'm even suspicious of
just went once you taste it a little big
and you look at it and it looks a little
like - bread it looks me I like I'm even
worried it's over flavored or over
coloured I don't want to go there coz I
have no grounds to believe it says it's
