the Vietnam no sir
this is the story of an adventure I took
with my kid back in 2012
Vietnam was is one of those places on
our list place we always wanted people
right yes to people this is our first
morning it was that kind of tired where
who was physically painful to get out of
bed we were super jet-lagged
for the leg one of our attorney taking a
train from Connecticut to New York and
then a plane from New York to Tokyo
Tokyo to Vietnam it was like a trap
these information is not in my notebook
we're only 44 minutes behind and the
grand scheme of things that's nothing
also it's 12 hours we had to you that
doesn't really have much bearing am i
screwing up you see every year towards
the end of the summer right before we
had to go back to school I would take
Owen on a big father-son trip Vietnam
was our tenth year in a row
this was our first trip 2002 in the
Bahamas it was something I took a lot of
pride in something that was important to
me because as a kid it's something I
always wanted and as a parent it was a
way of kind of alleviating the guilt I
had from working so much but mainly I
just love sharing new experiences with
my boy
I thought it was one two three days but
it's actually one two three days okay
this is where you get a motorcycle
Vietnam
the idea behind this particular
adventure was to get a motorcycle state
going on the back and then drive through
the vietnam countryside a couple of
things i learned quickly a lot of
scooters in vietnam not a lot of
motorcycles i found the guy who said he
could get us a motorcycle then we got
there and it was a scooter so then we
waited while they put together a
motorcycle that they eventually gave to
us that's the bike that's our bike right
there that little blue thing so we start
here yes going to the hobby I was sick
Bobby so we come from here yep do my job
to here and then to here first right on
the bike there are no words that can
describe the lawlessness that is driving
in
I've ridden a motorcycle in New York
City for years but riding in Hanoi was
different it was it was chaos
six hours about two hours in our
motorcycle journey it's much calmer now
it's cobber
it's not top eventually we escaped the
city and landed someone that looked a
lot more like what I had imagined
Vietnam look this is snake one it snakes
in there if some these snakes and snakes
and bees and honey
I guess they just let it ferment and
that snake one
this is just all bumblebees here what
does it taste like
that's why something coming
oh and just had his fourth choco pie of
the day look at your teeth calling us
your teeth give me a smile those teeth
let me see that I know I made it seem
like this was an adventure me a story
about riding a motorcycle through the
jungles of Vietnam but it's not this
this is a nostalgia movie this is a
movie about what my relationship was
like with my kid four years ago see when
I think of my time with my dad
I only remember moments moments of he
and I in the car together moments around
holidays but I was one of four kids he
had a full-time job we never had solid
blocks of time together and when I look
back at my relationship with Owen all I
remember are these huge chunks of time
that we set aside just to be with each
other
we're rearranging all the furniture in
our sleeping quarters to optimize
exposure to the fans it has its 99
degrees up here with 99 percent humidity
careful don't knock down the curtains
this is the bridge we just crossed I
don't know that I'd call it super safe
seems fine no one has a little fan club
over here the motorcycle trip was like
four days it was fun it was hard it was
fun the first day and a half
Owen didn't have a seat he's sitting on
the aluminum cage on the back of the
bike as passenger on the motorcycle
Owen seat which is this metal right here
is not terribly comfortable so we're
going to appropriate this pad for
additional personally I use an old inner
tube to attach the cushion I think it's
pretty good
comfy we weren't going anywhere there
was no mission no real finish line no
destination it was entirely a journey of
experience and along the way there were
things that really stuck out and it was
the weirdest things like I don't think
either of us will ever forget the
hot-water heater in this house we stayed
in okay this is where we're staying
describe to me the shower wiring
situation see this is the shower here
that's the hot-water heater there raw
wires there amazing situation here
the bank I shower situation changer I
literally have no idea how we ended up
down below with two women and a baby
oh and being in the middle downtown and
town I can you couldn't see him either
you could have to trust your father we
eventually made it back to Hanoi the
motorcycle adventure was over we did run
out of gas on our way back we ran out of
fuel but the trip wasn't over we spent
the night exploring the city and then
the next thing we thought 35 percent
alcohol by volume so that's about as
strong as vodka and it comes in a one
gallon plastic jug it cost three dollars
we didn't buy the booze but we did
decide to spend our last couple days in
Vietnam going on a boat trip carabao yet
let's hope that now for whatever reason
I don't have a lot of footage from this
boat trip as you know that there was a
mother American tourists on the boat
with us and and well doing karaoke I got
terrifically drunk off very inexpensive
wine
I spent most of the night peeking
overboard while it was asleep and the
next day on the boat didn't do much of
anything
that was kind of where our Vietnam
adventure ended no my intention for this
was to make a travel video instead
though I found myself editing four year
old footage and experiencing this time
with my kid all over again
do you remember our trip to Vietnam
uh-huh what do you remember that trip
what do you think of when you think of
that trap the cruise the biking team
this trips like that now that you're now
that you're old now there is nothing in
life that highlights just how fast time
passes like watching your kids grow up
and to see this knowing what the next
four years of parenting was I guess to
look back if there was one thing I would
have done differently it would have been
to go on more of these adventures with
my boy but that's the thing you can't
change the past
I am glad though that I can look back on
this time I can look through these video
clips and read this notebook
