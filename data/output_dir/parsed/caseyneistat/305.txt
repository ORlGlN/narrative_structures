we're shooting all kinds of videos in
here there are actual people and actual
people in this spot but hotel management
just took boys and to video cameras no
big deal
6:44 in the morning
we slept zero last night we stayed up
the whole night working which is great I
just showered and shaved and I feel like
a million bucks
flight is in a couple of hours now I'm
staying at this ridiculous hotel and I
want to do a hotel room twerks it's so
dope here but but because we're up all
night eating like junk food room service
the place is kind of a mess so here is
my dope Belfast hotel room tour a strict
sorry for it being such a total mess
you enter through this foyer which is
just lovely then walk into the main
bedroom this is the main bedroom but
there's no bed in the bedroom you have
to leave this room and go into this room
to get into the bedroom the bedroom was
great but the bed's still made because I
never slept in it see this bathroom it's
got my name on it but just a great
bedroom this bedroom would be considered
one of the nicer hotels I've ever been
but the veterans only a part of this
room the bathroom over here is really
more of like a one-person spa there's
this like amazing near showers that way
you know what's that way and then it's
bathtub here which of course I didn't
use is just awesome the bedroom the
bedroom was just really overall
underused I mean we never even came into
this room most of the time was spent
over here this room was like this was
like our main operating base this is
where we spent the whole night I mean
like seven straight hours just sitting
here working and I did want to thank
hotel management this lovely bottle of
champagne we didn't drink it not because
I didn't appreciate the gesture but we
had to work in champagne plus work just
they don't really match this is the bar
it's like a proper real bar right here
it's a little disgusting right now but
it wasn't this disgusting when we got
here
french fries pizza coffee soda you know
we had an all-nighter really the magic
doesn't begin until you outside sure the
views amazing but also private hot tub
look at the sheer amount of real estate
I mean this patio of yours bigger than
my apartment it's humongous
all in all though I really don't feel
like we took advantage of this hotel
I was just thinking we should go to the
spa yeah then let's do it

6:00 in the morning kind of hotel so we
have to be a little quiet and we have
