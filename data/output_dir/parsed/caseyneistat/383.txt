flight I've got 3 hours 11 at 7 hours
back to Neela I cannot tell you how good
that is why about the day
so much it's so much
some sort of release situation
thank you bye police wouldn't let us
leave the plane and they've ordered our
plane like machine guns the whole thing
and then they said they were on the
wrong plane they left
sounds like we situation sure is a lot
less fun without canvas and Francine
there is nothing like a shower and a
shave and fresh socks to make you feel
make you feel ready to start the day
thank you we got a new man that shower
Oaks made me late for my flight and I
don't get to buy food not step to take
yet on executing Chivers 14 thesis

automatic I switch seats and now I have
this whole little like fort here this

clips they weren't very interesting okay

didn't understand that I also asked you
to repeat yourself sometime you that's
what you do it's not what I do
yeah thank you very much
ah good to be back man does it feel good
to be back
I missed this studio so much but lookee
lookee what do we have here ah just the
latest and greatest unreleased
pre-production version of the new Canon
a TD so get this the day I left for
South Africa I got a phone call from B&H
photo saying they had an early version
of the Canon a TD that I could have I
just had to go picture it was the day I
left so this has actually been sitting
here for the entire time I was in South
Africa first huge thank you the B and H
for making this happen so I don't get to
keep this exact model this is like
literally a pre-production version that
has to be sent back to Canon when they
have the production versions that come
in so like this is a precious very early
special thing to have for those of you
who are not total nerds like me the
Canon 70d is the main camera what I'm
shooting on right now that I use for
this vlog the ATD is its successor which
is supposed to be better in ways that I
don't really understand needless to say
I'm pretty excited about this thing
now I'm going to switch cameras from the
70d to the ad D ready this is the ad D
alright you prop this as the old 70d
here you probably can't tell if they
give a difference this is not the best
situation to like but expect a full
review from me if you're a regular
viewer of the vlog you know I always say
that and I never actually do the full
review but maybe this time I will all
right I gotta go well I have kind of an
embarrassing problem here as I was
sitting here playing with this camera
from B&H photo this box showed up from
km photo km is the photo store just
beneath my office they're also great
people I've known Ross the owner for a
while generally they're just awesome
folks I can't tell you how flattering
this is
oh dude first of all thank you nope I'm
always a pleasure thanks for your
support
there's a small problem though you gave
me one literally at the same moment that
B&H gave me one your competitor okay how
do I resolve that how do I be gracious
well we're right below you and we
support you all the time how can you
compete with that okay yeah you can't
compete with that with that
shop shop New York City local camera

take this
quick unadvertised feature of the 54 ho
10 o'clock going home from work now
how's the low-light in this camera any
better this house is so empty and so
lonely without Candis and without
friends scene I honestly think this
might be the first night I've ever slept
here alone that is so sad I don't know
maybe we could be like a human shark
repellent
like exercise yeah what's that would be
bad
I thought Dan was messing with me I
hoped Dan was messing with me
Emily was any last minute words of
wisdom rod wave fiction okay
