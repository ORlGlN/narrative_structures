time
there's a huge controversy taking place
on YouTube right now and it's about
YouTube's restricted mode you don't know
about this controversy there's some
links below Phil DeFranco does a great
job of explaining the whole thing Gigi
gorgeous gives a really smart video
about why it is a big deal my best
understanding of this whole restricted
mode controversy thing is just like
YouTube once again screwed up
communication they stepped communication
with their community and the community
gets all upset about it because they
don't know what's going on and YouTube
doesn't explain what's going on
I know I've spent time with the
executive team at YouTube right and
Susan the CEO all the way down wonderful
wonderful people and they're trying to
do good things but they're failing at
something very very important which is
making the YouTube community the
community the community of creators feel
respected appreciated and and to keep us
informed of what's going on with this
platform that so many creators depend on
for their livelihood and companies that
have huge user bases like YouTube it's
very hard to communicate with everyone I
empathize with this struggle but we'd
love to hear about our the initiatives
by YouTube to help us creator stay
informed and understanding what's going
on and how best to leverage this
platform and just in short better
informing what our relationship with the
platform looks like and what it's going
to look like into the future ok here's
why this is a big deal I'm zooming in
here's why this is a big deal and why
I'm talking about it right now
YouTube as a company has absolute
ownership over this video creator
community that exists on the entirety of
the Internet
nobody's making great videos on
Instagram or on Twitter or on snapchat
or on Facebook if it's great original
video content online it's on YouTube but
YouTube is vulnerable
meaning that YouTube is threatened
meaning that if the YouTube community
doesn't feel well taken care of and a
competitor comes along with a product
that's just as good but to give creators
a bigger audience a better opportunity
for creators I don't know what would
keep creators with YouTube versus trying
other platforms and I think we're on a
very interesting place right now in the
world of technology because we're going
to start seeing other
these gun for that space that YouTube
currently owns FDNY boat rolling up on
me right there so I said this because I
want to express my own frustration that
YouTube at least outwardly from an
optics perspective YouTube doesn't do
enough to make their community feel like
they're prioritize and I know that the
people at YouTube notes but they're
monopoly on the space is not forever it
is vulnerable
someone else could come along and do
what you're doing and do a better job of
it and every time something like this
takes place that upsets the community it
jeopardizes the loyalty that the
community has with the platform I still
love you YouTube I just don't understand
where you don't communicate better with
the Creator
Oh
and he is how scary hey whoa okay lives
in my leg I don't have a thing work
honey
ready their toes
oh is that funny
all right let's put the little drill
away for now your dad you hold you
