what do you think of the autopilot
Candace if you need anything in the back
just let me know
honey it's bizarre she's slowly becoming
more and more convinced we didn't get a
car we didn't get a car and we're
probably not going to get a car I think
we just like to look
all right what is the afternoon
this episode is now going to become
what's up man
the official behind-the-scenes of jesse
wellens crazy halloween video exactly a
year ago Jesse and I did this video
where he dressed up as a Latin and rode
around the skateboard a magic carpet
that we built together it was like a
smash hit
and Jesse's redoing that this year but
like he's taking it to a whole new level
other look what's up dude you look
terrifying that there's a golden
character yeah hi Susie nice to meet you
oh can i watch your vlogs and your looks
thank you are you alright I'm freezing
what's up
how long did the makeup take we're out
five hours she killed it made you look
that's her name you'll meet her
yeah that's my friends I'm looking like
a lost dog with no clothes on her yeah
it's kind of scary on your face right
here
she was hideous let's hear did all this
makeup which means she disturbed Jesse's
naked body for like four straight hours
is that bad
so just like every other production in
production history this is a
hurry-up-and-wait situation everything's
ready to go all the boosted board
batteries are dead so we're just
standing around waiting while they
charge I have a jacket on I'm sitting
the Carm comfortable Jesse's over there
just about naked wearing nothing but
paint poor guy
and film this case in they're all here
to take a bit in Asia
we just finished the Steadicam shower
I'm carrying the gimbal on my skateboard
Jessie's chasing after me we're going
through traffic he's on the surfboard
I'm on the skateboard it's gonna look so
good you taking a peek yeah good oh my
god dog looks crazy look at that
oh she can see me
yeah look at those paths oh yeah it's in
4k so I can crop that mm-hmm oh god
that's a good already
I think we're done here in the West
Village we've shot every corner from
every angle and then just you know
anything where we chase each other
around we got everything we're gonna add
to the West Side Highway now try to
shoot an ending before the Sun sets he
wore how you feelin I'm called Kate and
chilly Ashley's not bad it's not bad you
should work you should dress like this
every day I wish I could took five hours
we are now at the Westside this was my
idea because they want to fly a drone
flying over the city is not safe because
they have a it never saved but they have
a big drone so it's especially not safe
so my thinking was there's this pier
right here where there are definitely no
people probably a good place for the
drone there's also this other pier right
here which is just like a really
dramatic looking on camera the Sun one
away it's like they got fooled so I feel
bad for for Jesse kind got up close on
how this tell them going they'll be up
in like three minutes so great drone is
ready I'm going to get Jesse this is
flash shot I got to get home to Candace
so she doesn't get upset yo you ready
drones waiting on you what's up what's
up
go stand by bit all right Jessie last
shot
