where he's been
750 under the bed aspirin in 50 and I'm
under than in a place for our buddy
you know then we make plan they were
going to be a certain time
I was another super casual thirteen and
a half mile run this morning I've been
writing like crazy lately
I mean I've been running like 13 14 15
miles a day every single day for the
entirety of this summer I just I can't
get enough
not having getting a lot of questions on
Twitter about people who are curious
about running maybe I'll make like a
Casey guide to running video or
something but a quick piece of advice
for newcomers to running if you've never
run before the only thing you should be
focusing on is time like can you run for
five minutes without stopping and then
ten minutes without stopping and then I
half an hour without stopping don't
worry about pace or anything like that
get to that bit later focus on the
amount of time you can spend on your
feet to that that's the first hurdle to
overcome
okay okay today on the vlog I will do
something a little bit different
something I used to do and I haven't
done this is a special edition episode
your driver
mr. Walter Raleigh South survey that was
2008 in Zanzibar vans of ours a little
island off the coast of Tanzania
Tanzania
okay we're jumping on a little plane to
go to sandbar now reach there this
special edition blog is the story of
when Graham and Casey and Clint and van
went to Africa and climbed Mount
Kilimanjaro so we're going to Tanzania
to climb the tallest freestanding
mountain in the world
big Kilimanjaro how about need a blog
about this no right now what you've
mentioned it in different vlogs so I
never made this vlog you've never made
an exclusive Chile law but the doctors
I'm getting here that's what I look like
without a shirt on ten years ago yellow
fever hepatitis typhoid and polio
vaccination so that doctor you had to
get shot to go to Tanzania for like
malaria and malaria yellow fever yeah
pitarrio DMV
lady polio tetanus typhoid so that was
the dream team it was banned KC Clint
Graham this is definitely Graham
sleeping on the airplane we didn't let
we have us we didn't have a plan for
anything our first day here we decided
to start the climb immediately that we
sure if we went there with enough cash
that we would find somebody to take us
up the mountain which was the case later
this month naturally we load the
cheapest least expensive guide we could
find positive to get up challenger
they were great nice guys I think we
realized on our way there that what the
value package got you yeah
very cheap meat cooker get the meat then
we're going to eat on our hikes the top
of the mountain here it is now that's
our cut so this guy turtle is one of the
guys that was the best on the team and
he was the official whiskey impresario
you guys like whiskey that's except it
was weird cuz we stopped at the grocery
store to get food for the climb and all
that the African guides were suggestions
that we buy lots of alcohol for them
guys idea to bring whiskey up to the
summit have to drink we're about to
start our mission up to the top of
Kilimanjaro one day it was amazing of
this climate you literally started in a
rainforest and on the last day we were
like standing on snow and ice that is
Mount Kilimanjaro my thumb is blocking
the Sun we have all these dudes carrying
all of our stuff it wasn't our choice
shooting the porters Porter's are
carrying up all the gear but just the
sheer amount of they're carrying the law
in Tanzania mandates that for every
climber you have at least one person
carrying your gear and it's a way to
like bolster local economies but also
they do it for safety we could carry
around we tried to they wouldn't let us
is that setting up camp on our first
night not actually us setting it up
other people setting up before us
when we're booking the guides we were
told we would have high quality chef
traveling with us this is their tent
where they cooked the food what was his
name
turtle turtle is the chef turtle was the
chef food
Oh crew Graham celebrated his 25th
birthday on Mount Kilimanjaro happy
birthday great birthday and dinner
I don't know why I thought it was a good
idea to climb out so many darling
sneakers supposed to wear hiking boots
when you're climbing the highest
freestanding mount in the world but you
chose sneakers my hiking sneakers are
frozen solid this is going to be a
problem two days then you can really
start to notice me fading I look like a
really ugly woman and this is our
campsite on the second day we thought
it'd be a good idea that instead of
spending six days climbing we'd spend
three days climbing twice as fast then
we used the rest of our time in Africa
to travel it was a great idea until the
morning of the summit climb the craziest
part of being up here is that were above
the clouds I just want to point one
thing out also the Red Hat that Casey's
wearing so Megan the summit push
tomorrow so not only did he not bring
hiking boot but he also didn't bring a
hat that was a hat that I've had three
school camps this is campus third day
freezing out here
you're about to witness the moment when
this entire trip for me went for me a
fun totally a fun adventure to just an
absolute his last day and climbing to
the summit in the morning it's about 20
below freezing
feeling strong hey you feeling grabbed
strong next shot will be from the peak
so in the end we made it we we summited
after some and so we did fly straight
from the mountain to Zanzibar this
tropical island off the coast of
Tanzania and that was like today's our
last day in Zanzibar and then we are
coming home to New York and data that is
the story of when Graham and I with van
and Clint climb Mount Kilimanjaro
just as an aside there's an unpaid
endorsement but this is grams and
company grams and entrepreneur it's why
we're such good friends we share a lot
of similarities
what is this gram man can is awesome why
100 percent California wine hey Grande
this isn't one of your poems over so I
just wanted to show the audience that
you're also a badass entrepreneur okay
that's it see you tomorrow
