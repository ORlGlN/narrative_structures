did you um did you vote it today sure
did
when I ran this morning it was not this
nice out but it is now an incredible day
it's also a very busy day it's also
Election Day
well I do have some exciting news to
share you know I have like a light right
here that it's helpful and it comes from
the side which looks nice but because
it's wintertime now it's like
permanently dark outside I don't get
that really yummy bright natural light
what I need are like lights that are
mounted in the window this company did
send me some lights along well this is
like a lightsaber send me some lights a
while ago maybe I can mount this in the
window for permanent daylight I want to
be the most well lit version of me for
you this is what is this
AHA battery this is here huh what you I
am your father
that's impossible okay this is gonna
change everything look at light on me
right on you and on me light on you how
do you mount this thing mount it right
there some hooks maybe like an L bracket
I think I've got it I needed to put that
bend in there drill for metal it's
really about pressure not so much speed
too much speed you'll end up just
destroying the fit Oh theoretically
there this should just be able to go
like this that's much better
do I look more evenly lit as if it's
daytime outside because it's not today
is election day I got to go vote which
is like a process in New York City I've
been procrastinating not because I'm not
enthusiastic about voting that is my
civil obligation it's just about like
going waiting in line also I've got a
very exciting agenda for the rest of the
week battery power vehicle battery power
vehicle those might be three of my
favorite word's
Electric RipStik
looks like a charger Sapir stay
controller

the battery-powered rip stick

morning at 6:30 this morning yes
good man good man
is just a quick epilogue to the episode
I'm on an airplane right now watching
watching hillary clinton's concession
speech truck one i just wanted to
address that
everybody on Twitter is like what do you
think what are you going to do first of
all and a lot of my viewers are Trump
supporters so congratulations I entirely
respect the outcome of the elections
Trump won fair and square and and I
think the key thing to remember whether
you agree with them or disagree is that
the beauty and the most incredible part
again to live in this trip well live in
that country live in this country is
that no one person whether it's a
politician
anybody else can really control how you
live your life
so if you disagree with our new
president back then then it's up to you
to stand up for your values of what you
believe
all right that's it I'm getting dirty
looks
I feel like I just didn't get down I'm
sorry this is the greatest office
building in New York City but I also
feel terrible for everyone who works
here that's not the three of us
