another another
another drone review video
Oh analyzed our hello for me Farmingdale
Long Island home of Adventureland
because Adventureland is so cinematic
and I happen to be out here in Long
Island it seemed like a perfect time to
do a test of the brand new of the DJI
phantom4 pro quick caveat this video is
not sponsored by DJI or any other
companies this is just a tech review
this is the latest and greatest from DJI
it looks exactly like the Phantom 4 but
it has more sensors and a much much
better camera I just got it yesterday I
did an unboxing press in today's video
is going to be pitting this consumer
camera versus DJ eyes prosumer camera
this is meant for sort of novice and
hobbyist this is them for
semi-professional now for good forum
also can be flying the DJI mavic DJI
Maverick is a much smaller consumer
hobbyist drone also my favorite new tech
of 2016 this thing is incredible but
it's image is limited which is why I'm
excited to try out this pro here today
obviously there are a lot of hardware
differences across the zone to your
thumb avoc is the most compact tiny
controller that you need a phone for
close part of the Phantom 4 Pro is that
the screen is built-in you don't need a
phone for this sucker and then this is
just like now the main thing how to
determine is is this thing actually
better than this thing or is it just
slightly bigger cooler looking and
harder to deal with to figure that out
I've recruited my brother who is
slightly bigger cooler looking and much
harder to deal with to pilot the bigger
drone
we're both flying in full-auto on the
camera so no manual settings
that's some important considerations
here the lighting conditions that we're
flying in that day were not optimal it
was really flat and everything is kind
of even looking this thing doesn't
perform a low light that's not really
represented here
this really isn't like a one is better
than the other situation there isn't
like a winner and a loser here I mean
they're all let me let me explain this
is a prime example of something I talked
a lot about when it comes to camera gear
called diminishing return my name is
Blaine
your groan analysis with thematic
phantom4 pro and the inspire one
professional and its repackage here
you've got your you've got your value
ease of use and the quality of the image
the Mavic clearly has the best price the
phantom moderately-priced
the inspire is expensive when it comes
to which one it is to fly the Mavic is
the easiest to fly no question the
phantom is pretty easy to fly and the
inspire is well it takes a little more
practice it's hard to pitch it's not
that easy which land finally on the
quality of the image image quality
automatic is fine image quality on the
Phantom perfectly good image quality
aspire is borderline professional so
it's hard to say which one is best
it really depends on what you're looking
for what the priority is so if you're
watching this video at all thinking
about buying a drone and then this is
you still don't know where you should
land here's a here's a good way to think
of it this Mavic I think yields an image
that is closely like and maybe what like
a high-end galaxy phone would look like
or a an iPhone would look like really
great quality people look outside here
that looks great but a profession some
with a keen eye might the pro here is a
big step up and I would liken the pro to
something closer to life like maybe a
low-end SLR super high-end point you
like a really high quality image that
when people look at that they might be
like wow that looks professional and
then the big guy my little brother took
at home on a half the inspire I would
like into the camera that I'm shooting
this on right now this right here this
is like a Canon 5d Mark 4 it's a
prosumer borderline professional camera
that people will see and they'll say I
look like that looks like a movie or a
TV show that looks so pro so that's kind
of it which one's my favorite
this one it's just so small thank you
I'll be back soon with more technology
reviews
