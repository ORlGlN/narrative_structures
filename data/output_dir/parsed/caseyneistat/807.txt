you catch anything look
this one by
carlos lives in the lower Eastside twice
a week he goes fishing in the East River
just under the Williamsburg Bridge this
movie was an attempt at a mini
documentary on fishing in New York City
but that movie was boring Carlos wasn't
boring he was interested and he was way
more interesting than the fishing but
the business going slow and slow and
slow
they had to fight a couple of us and I
went on of Avila's
he told me about how he was laid off
from his job in Brooklyn where he
slaughtered chickens and goats for
minimum wage and what hard work that was
he told me about what it's like to be an
illegal immigrant and how his home was
when he first moved to the States
I happily for six months understand the
highway are under the strip's with a
booty about another six times for six
months
let homeless
ask people for quarters to eat and then
I starting work we talked about his
parents and how he's been sending them
money for the last 20 years
you fish a lot in Guatemala
with the net with a big net and no with
the fishing pole I here only with the
net
the people from here they open the arm
to everybody you know they are they they
have no discrimination even the Mayor
Bloomberg he say all the bigots welcome
to New York
hearing that reminded me why I love this
I think I couldn't catch anything
because I when I saw a lot of Spanish
people here and I don't catch nothing I
told him man today I gotta eat my rice
and beans but now maybe ended up
spending most of the day with Carlos he
never caught a fish
it was an interesting guy though
as hard as his life was he never
complained reminded me of this quote by
Will Rogers the guy you give something
to you can't please it's the people that
pay for things who never complain
the best part of the balancer song in
the Cowboys you sing
turns me
No
scene
