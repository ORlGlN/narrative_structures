okay that's it no times over I've been
in a meeting with these guys since like
first thing this morning nonstop meeting
the reality of that statement Senate
I've been staring at your face
I'm so sorry it's like watching ten
hours worth of your vlogs basically
stress well I know you're a fan of the
vlogs there as if that nine hour meeting
wasn't enough it's an exciting meeting
I'm going home now to spend a little
time with the fam because we're
continuing that meeting tonight over
drinks and dinner so I want to get a
little bit of family time in before we
go out hi
where's Candace where are they Candace
Frannie huh come home from work early to
see the family and there's no family
home just an empty house all right after
a little cutie with the baby and the fam
I have to head to a company dinner
taking my bike it's not the whole
company at this center but there's gonna
be like
six or six or seven of us it should be
fun
there's probably going to be some
drinking element involved so I just want
to say now ahead of time that if this
vlog just abruptly ends with no
conclusion to the story it's because the
drinking began and then I neglected to
continue vlogging
