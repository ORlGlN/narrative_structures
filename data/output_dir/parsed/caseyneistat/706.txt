Oh
this shot looks familiar it's because
this is the same shot from yesterday's
vlog because yesterday I came here
because I thought yesterday was today go
inside
somebody said in the comments below that
I need to be spending more time with my
family and more time with Francine and I
can only assume that means because they
don't see enough of them in the vlog so
I thought this is obvious but clearly
not so let me just explain I apologize
if this comes across as pedantic but my
day just like your days my day is 24
hours long and these vlogs are usually
eight minutes long so that means 23
hours and 52 minutes of each one of my
days is not in this vlog and during
those times I'm doing things like
spending time with my family and more
intimate things that I choose to omit
from this law there's a lot of my life
that exists outside of these
eight-minute nuggets and I like to
upload every day and also like this vlog
for me isn't and has here with respect
out isn't and has never been like a
running daily journal for me what this
vlog is for me is a way to like share my
ideas and perspectives and have a
conversation and chat in the comments
and do Q&A s it's a forum for me it's
not a journal
gotta go to the studio
gotta get my bike got a ride to 13th
Street big day ahead I think I never
know so god this is gonna require a lot
of blurring Matt and I both thought that
we needed to give the team greater
motivation to work harder and faster so
this is this little kind of motivational
art project I built this is where it
gets awesome it's this scene I like that
it doesn't get to that ouble below the
idea is that it cuts the second the
battles over you know friend of mine
I don't know this is from
these guys are awesome
I broke the other one
I'll see you later okay now I've got to
get out of here I have to be in 13th
Street at 9:00 a.m. it is currently 8:54
a.m. I have six minutes to get there
mister Jehovah show some love you both
owe me this is literally the first
person I met when I moved to New York
City 14 years ago how you doing how's
the family
I'm great I got two kids in the West
Village right with Dylan Hendricks all
honed their skills I recognized this
genius years ago and I'm always proud
when I see what he's up to
you know I've got two kids no I reckon I
know I know you got a family I lovely I
saw Candace on the street here today she
doesn't know me so I didn't want to cast
her but this is my boy here I'll keep my
eye on him you guys keep an eye on him
too good to see you go
family love that guy I lived in New York
City for two full years before I ran
into somebody I knew on the street and
that's when New York City felt like home
to me rather than this like scary city
that I was visiting Wow
full disclosure I don't really know what
this event is that I'm going to right
now I was invited to it it's some sort
of panel or or roundtable discussion
with a bunch of people that are far
smarter more successful and generally
better educated than I am I was looking
at the invite list and it's all like
architects and designers and politicians
I think Al Gore former Vice President Al
Gore is on that list but I was promised
free breakfasts so of course I'll show
up
it's a pretty intimidating house
last person here but I'm also not on
time
Thank You Casey
you too well that was super fun some
t-shirts and stuff but thank you
get our food jackpot
