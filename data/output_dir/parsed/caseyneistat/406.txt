it starts I can only imagine what it
looks like after it starts just look at
this food
Oh Wolfgang Puck's Aniyah snacks I was
assigned a babysitter today like someone
to keep an eye on me and was told never
to leave his presence there lost them
I lost the babysitter can I see what's
over here and then I'll probably just
come back I've got this great pass here
which basically means Casey goes
everywhere
this is where everybody takes the
pictures this is where you're supposed
to stand they told me not to come back
here cuz I thought I might interrupt
some photo shoots like these yes
we're not allowed to have any wireless
devices of any kind on the carpet

time into the theater now snack
situation here is like social
there's a lot of like potato chips don't
be cares about that but there's also
pizza

cheeseburgers and four tiny slices of
pizza which I think adds up to like
almost a meal also I'm hitting this off

going to see my seat I hate to see the
seat that the Academy thought that I was
worthy of I can't wait it's the other
way oh okay Oh totally cool this is the
seat that the Academy of Motion Pictures
thought that I deserved so up again yeah
okay yeah this is where they thought
that here in oh come on

DiCaprio secret he's not honestly he was
in the seat for like 10 minutes at the
beginning of the show and he's been gone
