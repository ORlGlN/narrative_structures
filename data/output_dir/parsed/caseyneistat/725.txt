now here is an attitude I can appreciate
this man was clearly having trouble
getting his trunk to stay shut and he
fixed it no big deal
my first job was as a paperboy
delivering newspapers I think I was 11
years old or something like that but I
remember vividly getting my first
paycheck for like 30 bucks and it really
like it blew my mind because it was the
first time I was able to connect a
dollar with work or with energy and that
would be without a doubt one of the most
valuable lessons I would ever learn in
life very early I'm gonna try to get a
quick jump on the day by mowing the lawn
nothing freaks the neighbors out quite
like mowing your lawn at 7:00 a.m. on a
Sunday morning
look ass
you ready you ready to go up breakfast
we're having breakfast with your
grandmother and you're on do you haven't
met her yet no fussing no fussing silent
that's a good girl
can I locked up we made excellent timing
leaving the house now yes why don't have
any clothes on
you can't just wear a bra to breakfast
you know I just gotta go with the flow I
guess
our European it is very European it's
very exotic alright I bet the way is an
hour nice butt crack
I didn't even ask well I still asked
what does it look like in there well the
line is wrapped like this my mom was out
all family event and my mom flat Margo
by that is there now we're at the store
buying things we don't need
what are you doing awake go back to
sleep go back to sleep go to sleep
8:00 go to sleep am I paying for this do
you want anything
Owen today's Owens third day of work at
his new job I'm very excited about it I
am definitely more excited that the kid
has a job then he is excited about his
job there he is seeing
he's helping those people get Donuts my
little boy at his first job
how's it going on you look very
professional back there young man I'd
like to say you're doing a very good job
back there so proud of my boy
doing a great job over
goodbye thank you for my doughnuts
is it weird that it kind of makes me
want to cry a little bit
what a great boy anyways if he's not in
the vlogs not much anymore because he's
a working man now eight or donuts and
been up since five so I'm falling asleep
at the wheel
Candice is gonna drive gonna have one
more donut this means I've eaten five
donuts five dollars
I'm gonna drive his canvases flawlessly
we did this rotation like five times per
from you thanks
we're back in New York City finally I
think we spent more time driving that we
did in Connecticut I'll be back just
gonna run to the office super fast and
then grab my gear jump on my bike super
fast and head out to Williamsburg
Brooklyn to get some shots because these
low clouds are amazing packing up here
for the shoot tonight
there's the steed
but first stop here Williamsburg Bridge
pretty amazing Sun coming through these
beams here in both directions this is
the view I'm after now it's not as easy
to get as you think
see this whole bridge shakes so much
when the subway goes by that all the
shots are blurry the subway
there's a camera there so wait you rode
all the way back up here nice to meet
you pleasure so that's like that's mega
wide and this is my new Samsung s6 edge
which has an insanely good video camera
on it
my cameras are just about batteries so
I'm gonna get the hell out of here now
probably about 20 minutes from here to
my thirty nine o'clock I haven't even
started editing so be a long day
