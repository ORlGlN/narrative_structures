you have a nice audience everybody
people are jumping in the water here
it's snowing outside what's wrong with
you Finnish people all right Casey yeah
show me how it's done boss check it out
have the courage to turn yourself to the
back otherwise it's bad I know it feels
a little scary but the best thing is to
land on your back
can you just climb down here and jump
into those boxes like this
hello oh yeah I'm sorry I didn't know
that I'll be right down
oh I think I'm supposed to be downstairs
okay time to go today is my first day in
Finland add a little bit of like a weird
jet lag sort of blackout situation last
night when I lay down and woke up 14
hours later I gotta I gotta pick up the
pace
I didn't mean to go up I I don't know
how to use this elevator so after you
dropped me off yesterday I went to sleep
and then I woke up like an hour ago
sorry I kept you waiting no problem so
longer zoom lens these girls better let
me close on running through the street
no clothes can zoom into the 4k there
this is like this is like a press thing
I'm these guys are all just firing
questions at me about rapid fire right
now okay what else
was that it that's all the questions
can I ask you a question yeah
what are those are those hard to run in
no no they're very nice I think I live
in higher but right now I'm hi yes I'm
time I use so this talk this morning is
phoom fest talk it's sort of an industry
talk it's about like new media social
media building online audience things
like that
love talking to these audience
especially in like an international
forum like this I don't know what the
rest of the day holds I'm hoping to go
see a doctor because the whole
skateboard fall yesterday's hasn't quite
healed like I well still a lot of pain
another that I don't know what to do I
only have two days in Finland so I
really want to take advantage but first
I do my dog
that's where I'm going to be doing my
talk
I'll see you thank you I'll see you
tomorrow in the morning how do you how
do you think the talk button why it was
really inspiring it was first time for
me to hear your whole story great story
Thanks I appreciate it I can bend it
like this I can the motion feels fine
Joe and I have feeling this sore yeah
exactly
did I do the right thing when I put it
back really yeah because I wasn't sure
it just looked horrible yeah it was
completely sideways
yeah and it went yeah so what do I do
now just like there there if there's
nothing usually we can do for that thank
you
I still don't know what's about to
happen
oh you're gonna love it no what are we
doing I've no idea let's find out
I have no idea what we're doing
beautiful beautiful is there anything
you want to say to the people like no I
just have a question all right what are
we doing
yeah the idea is that we're gonna have a
cross court isn't there like a race car
okay and your piece gonna be driving the
car okay yeah a lot lucky you and I
gonna be in it with you what kinda okay
well you're not gonna be in it with me
yeah the idea is that you're gonna be
duct-taped to the rules of the race card
came up with this idea
all right this is it there you know I
tape me to the top of this car now duct
tape and that's kind of crucial part of
this whole like a strap or something you
think duct tapes the best I think I
think duct tape in this case it's the
best way to how fast you're gonna drive
well as fast the 15 goes yeah I'm really
excited I don't know if you can tell
they look on my face but yeah I'm super
super excited right I can tell from your
eyes
you're gonna be back ready
by the way if you lean all over here I
can't see it fine so this is the game
and I can't really tell you to say if
it's too tight okay you need the blood
circulation still that's probably a good
idea also I think we need like before we
go we need to make a test that like
you're trying to get out yeah we go
international
ready to go
don't stop for the roof this car for an
hour now our intent bitch I'm a little
bit sore but I have a great time great
time
so what do I have for a recap it's good
the thing is like all those action
scenes all those amazing shots is that
was a lot of fun but it's 7:20 right now
and they strapped me on the roof of that
thing at like 5:15 so it's almost a
little over two hours sitting on there
and that really started to hurt my man
parts hurt but it was a lot of fun
so they just asked me that okay do you
mind doing just one last fun thing with
us one last fun thing with us before we
break this party up are they sure so
they want me to jump off this building
right here onto a cardboard box don't
know why but it seems I guess I guess
that seems fine I think that seems
perfectly reasonable thing to ask
someone like I said like I said if you
go feet first you will go straight
through maybe you can do this
