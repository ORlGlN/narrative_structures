the fresh one
you keep these in stock just for me just
for you exactly just when you're back in
business
nice and crispy one nice and crispy
thank you sir
okay see this thing happens anytime you
have like a special experience in life
and in the moment it feels right it
feels wonderful it feels and I'm talking
about a birthday a first date a trip
especially travel especially I say this
now because I'm like exhausted right now
and I look back I think about yesterday
I think about this amazing trip that I
took with my kid and it just feels like
this fun thing that I did as time goes
by they go from being these like little
fun things so something so much more
substantial time has this magical
ability to erase all the negative and
amplify all the positive like as I'm
talking to the camera right now I'm
looking into the screen and I see this
picture over my shoulder that's me
that's Candace that was like 2008 when
her and I went on this trip went to my
friend's wedding in Vegas and we had
just broken up and gotten back together
and we have this like amazing time
together in Vegas and in the moment you
know but I look back at it now and I
realized that that was such a big moment
for us in our relationship and forever
we'll look back and have that I'm
launching into this tirade right now
because beyond like the fun and the
whole France and the Mercedes and the
like it was also the moment that my kid
went from being a kid to being like but
no matter what no matter what happens in
the rest of our lives we will always
have the experiences we had together
it is those moments in aggregate that
equal life
scare me hey girl did you miss me yeah
at first I did it and then I did when
you first leave I'm like no one's going
to wake me up at 4:00 in the morning and
I can watch TV till as late as I want
and then after like two nights of that I
was like um when's Casey coming home I'm
in the middle seat do well in the middle
seat like a window seat
Owen likes and I'll see
