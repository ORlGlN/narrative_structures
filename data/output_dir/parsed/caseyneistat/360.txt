deal
Air France properly lost our luggage no
idea where it is which means like all my
camera here and all of our clothes and
all of our things and like my razor in
my monitor hair gel are all lost
somewhere in the Air France universe but
it's hard to be upset considering where
we are right now at what might be the
nicest restaurant view I've ever
experienced ready
that's a swimming pool and just beyond
the singing pool is the coast just
beyond the coast is the ocean not sure
what we're going to do without our
clothing or our things but not really
sweating it right now
this place is amazing you know I haven't
explained why on and I are at the South
of France in this ridiculous hotel
driving around ridiculous cars let me
get into it see a couple of years ago
probably before you were a subscriber I
did this super fun project with Mercedes
Benz

of friends with people at mercedes-benz
while we did that project then a couple
of weeks ago when I was at South by
Southwest I ran into Wolfgang who's one
of those awesome people that works for
mercedes-benz and he was like yo Casey

South of France on April 14th for a new
car it's not this car but I mean come on

press but they invite it own in me and
