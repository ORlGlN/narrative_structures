these guys here selling a big huge
flat-screen TV for 50 bucks top 15 bucks
at work yeah dudes brand-new pretty much
so we got rid of it because it's got new
TV last night 15 bucks huh
look at this town it is a barren
wasteland 9 a.m. day after Christmas I'm
grabbing a quick coffee with canvas and
the baby and then I'm headed to the
airport
very excited here's our baby daughter
Francine oh I can see her little hand
oh just helping her with the baby
stroller out of the car
sorry officer have a good day no ticket
for this guy
no ticket at all I want anything sit
here before he loops back around
realizes that I was in fact illegally
parked okay bye guys bye guys I'm on my
way to Los Angeles International Airport
to pick up Owen my kid I'm at a red
light
Owen spent his Christmas with his mom
but because he's a responsible young man
and
I'm also just psyched to have him here
cuz I need something to hang out with
I'm really outnumbered in the Y 2 X
chromosome department between Francine
Candice and kandace's mom three girls
one guy look at this motorcycle cop on
the back of his bike right there that is
an ar-15 assault rifle that is bonkers
I'm at the terminal but own is not here
I strategically parked the car to make
sure I'm not in anyone's way and now I'm
going to pretend to take the stroller in
and out of the trunk of the car for the
next 15 minutes until Owen gets here
that's the only way to avoid a ticket
on average lager I can play this game
Freight what number look around what
number do you see there he is welcome to
California
do you want to get in an out burger
before we go home
of course I stop here so own can get a
cheeseburger but I had ulterior motives
this in and out has one of the best
views one of the best vantage points for
airplanes land
any can't y'all go to the movies today
Oh Candace and her mom and the baby have
left us oh and I are gonna go see oh and
I don't have a car but we're gonna go
see Star Wars right now so we're gonna
take the motorcycle we'll only have one
helmet so we're only gonna wear one
helmet a motorcycle store so I can buy
another one but this is both illegal and
dangerous so I make it out back there
two more blocks to the motorcycle store
does it look like I'm wearing a helmet
all right we'll make this fast all right
I need a helmet the girl in there was
super awesome but they literally did not
have one helmet my size
we'll figure this out
so many options thank you very much
mission accomplished
got it
you have any idea where the movie
theater is do you like riding on a
motorcycle I think if I were driving it
would be fun I mean I think sitting on
the back motorcycle with my father
why do you find all that love riding a
motorcycle we're here to see Star Wars
again I was in yes you haven't seen it
yet how much do you think we spent on
junk food
just two of us do you like it yeah I
love it
how's my second time seeing Star Wars I
think he's better the second time it's
not a perfect movie but that doesn't
mean it's not a great movie probably see
it again
all right we're going high in the fire
we're going on the freeway so
we are here to find Candace and her
mother and believe it or not our
shopping today
hey guys doing some shopping hi little
one I'll see you guys at home take that
bye honey
it is a lot easier to ride without a
passenger I like riding with Owen it's
just easier without 200 pounds on the
back
I tried to get on iphone for Christmas
but they couldn't ship it here in time
so I'm gonna try and get one form right
now and then return the one that I
ordered for him when it shows up this is
mine now right thank you
mission entirely accomplished no ticket
no ticket no ticket no ticket sweet I'm
sure the whole food let's just let's
just have Nutella for dinner again
all right oh and I have something funny
to share with you okay in California on
the highway there are special lanes if
you're a carpool passenger so some cars
put fake dummies in their passenger seat
so it looks like they're carpooling look
at the guy in this Porsche
