the sports car okay here we go
do it
the great
easy there's a big turn
brakes are unreal in the downshifting it
automatically this road is like there
are no breakdown lenses like an inch
wide it really is in the course on the
other side cravat just like they don't
care they drop like animals out here
can you believe what happens when you
hit the gas oh my god it's incredible
we figured out how to make the drive the
car drive itself look we're on the
highway the car is completely driving
itself right now it's steering my feet
are off the brakes and gas hands-free
straight chillin over here literally on
the freeway look at this at home but
look at this is the coolest cars the
vloggers dream still have to pay
attention
but the car does do a very nice job of
driving see the steering wheel
watch it move look at that snow hands
taking a really quick break from driving
here going to the supermarket
that means supermarket French that's
fine God that is a pretty car huh
yep you're locked yeah what are you
getting in here
what are you getting what about free
books get some reboots for me so that's
it
and so it is 7:00 p.m. now we just got
back from a long drive I'm exhausted but
I promised Owen would go swim in the
water which apparently is freezing and
since we leave tomorrow morning now is
our only chance
so we are going to swim in the water
all right it's called a fur Nick Euler
or Verne it there oh and that water does
not look kosher for swimming in but I
thought what is O'Donnell is when it's
on a cable can we take this yes but we
are closer okay let's walk this yeah
this will Christie

now this is where you want to go for a
cool dip
