mild freak out but so far so far so good

demographics of my audience before
coming here and the average age of the
viewer of the channels like 20 so this
is a little young for you I apologize

entire life this is Francine first-ever

winding down friend seems on her on her
last leg
snap times usually like 12:30 or 1:00
but she's been a total champ
that's so it'll be out there we decided
to make a weekend out of it and stay in
this your hotel in Philadelphia
you know just thought it'd be fun kept
those two kids with us tomorrow's a
holiday in this case we didn't feel like
going straight back to this
sightseeing in the great city of
Philadelphia Jessie didn't used to live
here
if the drone cinematography is enough to
snuff it's because just using the little
spark here I don't have a controller for
this thing yet
having to control it on a little touch
screen cell phone which isn't great but
the fact that I have a drone in this
little purse is just amazing
so we're lucky sir Fanny you are a baby
okay
I think that just about wraps on our day
in Philadelphia and that Sesame Place

you have little kids bring them there if
you have older kids maybe not so much
