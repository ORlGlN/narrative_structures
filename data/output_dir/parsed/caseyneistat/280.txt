get there three more two more two more
subs two one more sub one more come on
yeah three and a half million
here's exactly what's going on it's not
the microphone that's broken
I've localized the problem to where the
microphone gets plugged into the camera
here I think it's because the camera got
super wet in the Dominican Republic
all I have now are these onboard
microphones here it's really aren't
terrible the trouble is if there's any
wind at all all you hear is this which
is the most annoying sound ever I'm
going to try to use this wind sock from
this microphone and somehow attach it to
this camera I feel like this could work
lovely one
we go
lovely one
Oh
take out the paddle boards oh yeah 100
take out 100 percent 100 all right here
consider this is the case that it came
in which is definitely not water from
now but this will float so I did you
pack it in this put this in a garbage
bag strap the garbage bag to the this is
Ian we're going to take the paddle
boards out and I wanted to bring the new
drone on the paddle I've never flown
this we want to take it out in the
paddle boards to get the perfect
location for drone flight all right
let's pack it up we need it to like
balance just like that ratchet straps I
don't have ratchet straps I feel like
this is going to work
put the drove in the iPad in the first
garbage bag and then the twist see I
feel like this makes this basically
impenetrable no way water's getting
through that and then to be safe its
second garbage bag that's impenetrable
no way this is gonna fail that's
military grade I think so
okay let's take this out to see
all right let's go
hi lying
we do this I've got the drone we made it
off the island Shores back this way
that's where we're gonna be flying the
drone to Hey look a boat except Bruce
right right clearly agree bone-dry yeah
maybe you should hold it
the drone looks good pocket pierce yeah
many more of those pocket beers do you
have only one pocket beer
take it off take it off we're born
try my best and eight button my head
I've been drinking all that it's a
so this beach here is just people who
live here but there's a public beach
over over yonder and I'm flying over
that right now it is packed with people
he's a kick Oh afternoon house get it
back cutting it down a notch Oh somehow
I doubt that
now I got this thing like five six years
ago something like that I never use it I
think after I totaled my second
motorcycle I thought that a Vespa would
be just as fun and not quite as
dangerous and this thing is five years
old and it has a whopping 868 miles on
it the problem with these things is that
I have a clutch and without a clutch you
can't pop stardom I could probably jump
started off my truck but but the weekend
is almost over and that's not really how
I want to spend my time still even the
shed and pretend I never tried to start
it she's still asleep honey I couldn't
get my Vespa started I'm so excited we
are leaving right now for New York City
we decided lead tonight instead of
saying here for the fourth of July
tomorrow because the traffic tomorrow
just can be horrendous to go home today
no traffic and then tomorrow we spend
the day in the city which is a lot of
fun it's always a little sad leaving so
I don't know we might be back what else
sitting up front
