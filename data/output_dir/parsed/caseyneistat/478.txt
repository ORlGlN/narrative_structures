about a year ago at one of her shows and
I was so impressed with her she like
inspires and motivates an entire
audience of like young mostly female I
think aspiring creators and I was really
really blown away by that so today was
like definitely something that is not in
my wheelhouse of things that I typically
do but it was super fun and it was
really interesting for me to see like
how she makes her funny fun little skits
that have built this gigantic like
channel Empire

quality
