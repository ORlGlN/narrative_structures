good deal you're going to eat on the
rooftop here which is supposed to have
one of the best views of Chicago and

hour long and we gotta hit the road

church bell are we under attack
come on triangular forest hi sushi
Cohen sushi was not good we have a very
very long way to go I'm tired of driving
see there's this constant conflict
between wanting to be as efficient and
fast with your time as possible and not
wanting to spend the entire trip sitting
in the car finding a balance there is uh
elusive
I brought the Busan board with me lounge

get some air you need the booster board
after midnight now hopefully it's our
last fill-up we're still very far from
Colorado chat the name of this gas
