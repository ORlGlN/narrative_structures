this travel review is a comparative
analysis of travel from New York City to
eastern Long Island on a bus versus
stand air seaplane with a heavy bias
towards the plane since they're paying
me to make this movie
okay the roots go something like this
the bus leaves from fortieth and third
takes the Queens Midtown Tunnel then 495
East 27 blah blah blah blah arrives in
East Hampton stand air leaves from the
East River I'm gliding through the air
like a magical time machine then
gently sets you down wherever you want
on the east end the trip takes about 40
minutes reservation only run bus nice
town you're good thank you
thank you google throw anyone else was a
do you have any champagne for the safety
yourself and your fellow passengers
please remain seated at home in case of
emergency every other window flying on
the sea plane was one of the coolest
experiences of my life
the bus was not our pilot was awesome
like a grey haired James Bond my name is
gone Jay the guy on the bus I am gonna
lighten my policy
he was more like Nurse Ratched mr.
Cheswick you sent down traffic
so thank you fine thank you
like the plane better
