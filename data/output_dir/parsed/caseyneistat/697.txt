the Hudson River because today as part
of Fleet Week they're flying f-16s over
the river and I'm super excited about
that whoa
the last time I saw fighter jets over
New York City was on September 11th they
were armed that day whoo
so it wasn't quite as exciting it was
more scary

really know where the best vantage is
but I'm gonna head to the southern tip
of the island they come here they come
I was incredible oh really
they're coming back here they come again
