I got very very sick about halfway
through
Ricky got very very sick about
two-thirds of the way through help you
nope
no cute very important nope you someone
gave puke though you know that yeah
yeah sheep you
ah
I'm gonna need to explain this so here's
what happened by the way I'm I'm at the
airport now
I'm in the back of the lounge all right
here's the plane and it goes up and you
float and then it comes back down it's
like ah look the g's pull you down and
then it goes up and then it comes out
and like this is how it goes you do it
like 15 times now on this axis on this
axis here we have sick and we have fun
maximum and minimum all right so this is
the first up so this is me floating
right here the little camera in my hand
maximum fun like that's where I started
and I wasn't sick at all no sick then
the sickness started to escalate pretty
quickly and then as this went up the fun
factor sunk pretty rapidly and then it's
sort of like this absolute peak sickness
for the rest and we just kept going up
and down up and down and I was like
turning green I was starting to sweat
and I was like losing and everybody
around me was laughing and having the
greatest time and this is me
and the reason why I got sick was
completely my fault the women told me do
not bring a camera and telling me not to
bring cameras like telling a fish not to
swim I brought the camera as I'm
floating I'm like staring into the
viewfinder which is the biggest nono and
I got sick I don't know I didn't listen
to those women they know what they're
talking about you know I asked my little
brother the jet pilot what advice he
could give me about going zero-g and all
he said was don't get sick I really
can't understand what a fantastic
experience it was if I did it again I'm
definitely listen to them and not bring
my camera but even though even though I
got sick like a wimpy little schoolgirl
the entire experience was just magic it
was like I was like actually being in
outer space what a great day I got to
put the camera away staring at this
thing started
