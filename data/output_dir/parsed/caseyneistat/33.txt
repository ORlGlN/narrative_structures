Kenneth and I are headed to our therapy
our couples therapy session right now
and I had an idea that I wanted to talk
to you about and get your opinion on
we're thinking about doing a podcast a
Casey and Candice podcast that's like I
don't know like an hour long or a half
an hour long or something and calling it
the title of the best part calling it
therapy where it's just us talking there
probably is but we can just make ours
bigger and better and then crush the
competition so let us know you think
like that's a terrible idea just write
terrible idea below if you'd be
interested at all well the only thing is
I'm tired of hearing the comments that
I'm such a like bitching a dud I think
people
we're at therapy now but that's the idea
let us let us know what you think
we finished therapy how do you think
today went today in therapy we talked
about having more children
and whether or not we want to move to
California
we should do the podcast
the laws
who are you taking your clothes off nice
box because Joe to Billy love Billy NYC
calm and by Candice's new cashmere
sweater it's a little expensive for my
audience honey $180 for pure cashmere
bye honey
great girl great girl
check this out ready I want to I want to
show this to you so get it got a screw
here got a string here and on the other
end there's like this pin that can be
used to remove SIM cards I have
permanently attached this to my desk now
this may seem like a nothing but you
know I change cell phones all the time
and getting that little SIM tray out as
a nightmare on my phone here oh and I
want to get my memory card out to
offload all the videos and stuff it's
hard to get out and I can never find
this thing and now look it just lives
here this is exciting for me
I'm gonna be premiering a new video that
I made that I've been working on for a
long time I'm gonna like put it in this
vlog it's like a four minute video to be
part of this vlog
you see one thing I want to do a lot
more of on this channel is talk about
creators other critters that I really
like that I think you should follow that
I think maybe you'll be interested in
and the video that I made is about my
friend Chantal who you've seen in this
show before and she just started
youtubing so I want to premiere her new
movie on my channel even though it's
gonna live on her channel I want to use
in this channel and I want to use like
this big audience that that this channel
has to talk about smaller creators she's
brand new she doesn't have any
subscribers and to talk about other
people that I think are doing amazing
things in this platform and try to sort
of elevate them a little bit shine a
little spotlight on them so this is uh
this is my friend Chantal Chantal is a
fine artist do you go by that visual
this all this find all this and the
reason why I like Chantal so much as an
art the reason why I like her as a
person that's cuz she's cool the reason
why I like her as an artist is because
her only instrument her only actually
have her entire art career was built
with a pan just a pen look this is this
is my apartment
and then this is I have one of chantels
paintings in my apartment that's
Francine in my apartment a couple years
ago had a studio here but we were
friends before that yeah she had one of
the best studios she had one of the
studios in this feeling that has
skylight you almost took it I was gonna
take it it's just like four flights away
I don't want to go up all those stairs
I've always wanted to make a movie about
Chantal and her artwork and who she is
because she's such an interesting human
being and we were kind of given the
excuse actually from Sam
are you gonna stick with that - oh yeah
this is one of Chantell stickers we were
given the opportunity because of Samsung
you know part of their like creator
creator initiative is enabling us to
make movies and they were willing to
sort of produce a case you nice that
movie about Chantal Martin and I'm gonna
premiere that movie I'm wondering where
I should drop it let me finish
let's finish okay let's finish an and
it'll play cool I'm reviving my old
youtube channel that I started probably
10 11 12 years ago right at the
beginning and I forgot I had it actually
one thing that I will say about Chantal
is she is fearless about trying new
things it's like I see everything is a
blank canvas so you shouldn't be afraid
of it you should flip that switch and
then just use it as a challenge and
create whatever you want how did you
meet Kendrick Lamar still in Miami last
year how did you meet Puff Daddy he came
to the show I had a few years ago he
probably doesn't remember okay so
without further ado I'm good this is the
world YouTube premiere of a Chantel by
KC video it's like three minutes long
but I'm really excited you're the first
people to see this ever ready 3 2 1
so what's the point in making our the
point is to make so you can share so you
may concern your making sure you make
your share
I'm Chantal Martin and I draw I'm
drawing on canvases I'm drawing on walls
I'm going on cars and drawing on shirts
and drawing on shoes 99% of that is done
live when you're drawing live you have
no time to think you have no time to
hesitate you have no time to plan you
have no time to be anyone else so this
is the cover of the home and garden
section and it's it's funny I didn't
know it was a big deal at the time so I
only bought one copy so you have an
extra spare copy out there I take it I
remember my art teacher telling me
Chantal don't apply for art school
because you're not good enough and you
won't get in at that point people were
only telling me what I couldn't do
so I ran away
I started my career in Japan in a
culture that was craft based in a
culture where people learn things and
practice things over generations over
long periods of time and I remember
thinking to myself what can I master in
my lifetime
what could I become a family confident
with what about a lie you know I draw I
love drawing we all drop though with
these these I'm gonna draw like this
what kind of hard work and patience
would it take so that when I draw a line
is recognizably mine moving to york was
very humbling because if no one knows
who you are they don't care who you are
and everyone is an artist and you start
to lose your
you start to lose your way and so I
decided well I'm not gonna not make up
because you won't show it I'm gonna draw
maybe the well my canvas and I'm gonna
lose any drawing tool that I can get my
hand I'm gonna draw and villager on
just give me a pen and I'll make
something
we follow the pen and we're allowed to
allow it to go wherever it needs to go
wherever it wants to take you you are a
William passenger
and now you repeat that and you repeat
that and you repeat that you repeat that
but over time you get to extract what
you look like over time you get to
extract what your line feels like
something that is recognizably yours we
have this contact between our head and
our pan it doesn't matter what industry
you're in it comes down to drawing it
comes down to that initial mark that you
make and without this pen I wouldn't
have traveled I wouldn't have
collaborated this tool has allowed me to
discover who I am
did you like our movie we're good
we worked really hard on that I hope you
enjoyed it what are you most nervous
about when it comes to being a youtuber
I think what I'm most nervous about is
continuously making and sharing and
pulling out stuff that I'm proud of and
putting out stuff that you're proud of
to you make in your share and you make
you gotta making sure making sure making
sure making sure all right I'm gonna
link Chantal shadow before below check
it out she's new there's not a lot of
stuff up there yet but it's happening
I'm a big supporter and a huge huge fan
and I hope you guys will but you should
sell those stickers you could bank all
