I'm not going to film my run this
morning because I have a little less
than an hour and I really want to get a
solid run in so the next shot is just
going to be this exact same shot at me
but after I've run for like 55 minutes
ready okay that was seven and a half
miles at a 720 pace warm outside today
look at this sweat by the way this Tom
Brady shirt Tom Brady gave to me
personally so it's kind of special to me
my days are so much better when I run in
the morning Matt is back today he's been
out for three days for his birthday and
today he's back looking forward to
seeing the guy you want to try it
how's the occasion there's fantastic
questions and answers
Casey what happened to your Apple watch
ah I broke the metal part that connects
the band to the watch itself not apples
fault I like totally mess with it and
customize it and I fell off my
skateboard broke it I ordered a new
generic part and it just hasn't shown up
yet still a big fan of the Apple watch
would you risk your own life to save
someone in need like stopping an armed
robber or run into a fire to save a
random child I mean of course I'm going
to say yes but you don't know the answer
to that question until you're in that
situation kind of a crazy question
Gonzalez what do you think about the
comfort zone I think it's the worst
place you could ever be when you're
hungry you want more when you're wildly
successful you can embrace your hard
work and be proud of it when you're in
the comfort zone it's just wow do you
feel pressured to always record
everything from your life no and the
truth is like I don't record that much I
do shoots for the vlog like a pretty
small amount of the day like I need
something to be happening in order to
record it and then I put that into a
story I call it a vogue I post it on
YouTube it's never recording the whole
day Alex asks other than hard work what
advice would you give to better yourself
both in life and in your career field
focus focus is super underrated like if
you commit all that you are and all of
your energy to one thing you'll okay
that's like this diagram this is I took
this from a book called I don't know
what it's called it goes like this
alright you can do ten things to like
the first degree like this right here
and that's how well you'll do all ten
things or you can do one thing to the
tenth degree right there and look how
much better you do that so when it comes
to focus to put all of your energy into
one thing is to do that one thing really
well to the best of your abilities to
take it all the way and to scatter
yourself means you're never actually
polishing anything you're just sort of
chipping away at a bunch of nothingness
and this is true for work this is true
for like dating versus committing
yourself to one person friendship
everything like really focusing and
investing yourself into something you're
passionate about will always yield
better results then scattering yourself
around then spreading yourself thin if
you could do it all again would you
change anything fun question I'm not
really into hypotheticals I'm very
rooted in reality and where I am right
now and to look back and say I would
have done this differently would mean
that I might not be in the position I'm
in right now and I'm really happy with
the progress I've made in life so I'm
much more about looking forward and
thinking what can I do now to affect my
future that I am looking at my passing I
wish I had done this
can you sing I wish I could sing I wish
I could sing I wish I could dance I can
do neither Josh asks how much of
yourself you see in Owen as far as
personalities and mannerisms and what
not a lot but I mean I try to emulate
Owen I think more so than he tries to
emulate me Owen is definitely a better
person than I am
he's more considerate and thoughtful and
concerned with other people's needs I
would say there are much more selfish
than Owen and that's the quality in him
I admire the most so I try more to be
like my kid then I would say my kid
tries to be like me and as a parent
that's like I feel pretty great about
that does it get annoying having kids
wait outside your office annoying
I've never invited anyone to stand
outside my office and the reason why I
go visit them outside is because I feel
guilty I'm always flattered and always
really excited about the fact that
people respond to the movies I make so
much that they want to meet me so I
would never like say no or be mean or
discourage but this is a place of
business like we have eleven people
working next door on beam there's a lot
going on here
and I'm working really hard to make this
work so the distraction is unwelcomed
and I try to do meetups at our last meet
of we bought 500 pizzas like we try to
do cool things like that all in I would
say don't come visit me here I really
like it's a big distraction I will say
though that when kids come into this
building and come outside my office door
that is
not cool at all we're trying to work in
here we're having meetings in here
conference calls like this is a very
productive very busy company here and
having kids knock on the door X I think
it's funny or cute or clever or that
they're special is completely unwelcomed
and not cool and pisses me off because
it lacks any respect for Who I am as a
professional I would never show up at
your office
I would never knock on the door of your
classroom and come in there and say hi
and ask for a selfie because that's your
space I hope that doesn't sound too
harsh like I said I really value and
have such appreciation for people that
respond to my work so profoundly I love
meeting new people but boundaries and
respect is something I hold dear and I
expect that from others ok that's it for
today's Q&A
one of my favorite things always is
