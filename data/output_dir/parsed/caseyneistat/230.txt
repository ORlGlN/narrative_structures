got it got it that's it yeah Casey how
are you thank you very much
bad traffic this is the last time one
yeah it's 4 p.m. for I haven't left the
house yet today I'm gonna leave the
house now sometimes I do really stupid
things and I'm actually embarrassed to
admit them on this vlog but I feel like
I have to somewhere on our cross-country
trip
I lost my boosted board it's gone I had
it in Denver it is nice to be in Denver
Colorado
then we got to Vegas
so I don't remember looking for it and
yesterday in San Francisco just wasn't
in the car that car was filled up with
all of one's worldly possession there
was a lot only on I still don't
understand how you lose a boosted board
what was he thinking right have a great
day sir buh-bye now
it was the PO keyboard to the one with a
custom Pokemon paint job from the video
uhh
my play wall here is getting kind of sad
in positive news I'm going to take my
pants off now
I don't know if you remember but my
favorite pair of jeans are these blue
jeans I used to wear literally every day
every episode of the vlog had the same
pants on but they completely fell apart
and canvas said it was getting gross I
had to stop wearing them because so I
just got them fixed my pants are back I
think you all know my philosophy on
mending is better than ending and check
these things out
look at that repair job clean look at
this in this and this and this nice work
I need to send a plug I'm not being paid
for this need to send a plug to my
friends company denim repair Tom I
shouldn't have to explain what they do
that's pretty intuitive yeah
the point of this entire room back here
is so when I need my equipment it's at
the ready at all times today is sort of
the first test of that uh got here ready
for a shoot
gonna need a GoPro I'm gonna need a
stabilizer work this thing what else
what else
having the year is half the issue having
here organizes the other half that felt
pretty good
I haven't given a tour over here in a
while things are really coming along
this is the best part of the annex
probably the single most important
aspect of the NX The Loft is fully
secured we got the two by six beam
running across here vertical supports
here braces in the walls this thing
backbone anywhere on top of all that
it's upholstered up there so it's a less
echo in here now the constructions done
Dylan is working on admin Ollie's
working out production although all the
vision for this space is nearly fully
realized right keep up the good work
team that's key guys you know this
morning when I got off that plane I was
like I got to get straight to work I got
a whole day ahead of me and instead I
was like no I have to sleep so this
morning I went to bed there's mine I
only got like a half a day today well
Jays like sleep is important
it's really screwing me over today
shopping is one of my but going away
again and I don't have any shirts so I
got to go buy like two t-shirts
quick quick trip to the Apple store Can
I grab one thing in here and they did
not have what I was looking for that's
surprising they always have what I'm
looking for
it's dark out but it's not late summer
is over I really really really didn't
want to come back to the office this is
what I forgot that stabilizer for my SLR
I want to start using this thing feels
good ready to go
got my shirt packed all my stuff that
wasn't that got the stabilizer thing

too missed them family's out of town I'm
going to go see them tomorrow
I'll tie it between my two girls being
gone and dropping off own at college I'm
just a lonely sad guy but it really does
make me realize just how much I love and
depend on my family good stuff
