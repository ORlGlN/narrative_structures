luggage is a pretty stupid thing to talk
about this is a carry-on but it's one of
those things in life that with a little
consideration can make travelling
something that's that's necessary in
life a little bit less stressful
now I'm making this video because my
luggage keeps getting lost or stolen so
the first step to luggage customization
is differentiate and identify
a significant design flaw with most
suitcases is that all the zipper poles
look exactly the same I tie a red tab on
the main compartment to prioritize those
zippers
a single luggage tag with the owners
contact information is never sufficient
highly visible permanent detailed info
on all sides of the Dead the second most
important travel item after your
passport is a skateboard
now most luggage is ill-equipped for
carrying such an object making up for
this oversight will require some surgery
first I fix the strap to the bottom of
the bag using 1/2 inch brass grommets
the upper attachment requires more
flexibility for removing and inserting
the board bungee cord works just fine
for that
and that's my suitcase
just if you're curious and this is not a
product endorsement this is a Briggs &
Riley brand bag it's pretty good quality
but at almost 500 bucks it should be
made in America not China
