then gate you remember city controversy

Bend and it still works just fine so
that's the first time that's up you guys
literally break anything as nona in the
has no Zhanna in the fat has no mana in
the fat summer is starting off right
getting that run
there's no mana in the fat
there's something about running in the
summer maybe it's like the heat or like
just being covered and sweat but I love
running in the Sun hey happy summer
everybody today is in fact the first day
of summer
alright I mean how does it and it just
could not be a better day to bring in
the summer is the fact that the
godfathers always playing behind me
distracting this is the scene where
Michael just escaped Cuba nearly got
killed found out Fredo betrayed today's
episode we kind of have a special
presentation today
- my favorite creators are here in New
York City and they're here like
finishing up this like wildly ambitious
YouTube video they didn't work out for a
very long time and this video is to
celebrate them getting their gold play
button at least to run a channel it's
one of those ideas that when you hear
like why didn't I think of that
it's a dad my friend Dan his son Lincoln
and it's sort of like every episode is
them it's kind of a science experiment
where they like take something they cut
it in half and they show you what's
inside of it Lincoln hello Lincoln
what's your favorite part of YouTube
making videos and having fun and cutting
things open what's been the most fun
video you've ever made the firework
video cuz we put 10,000 sparklers into
one bin
and if you light it off it makes a huge
fire that's pretty fun and your dad make
sure that you don't burn your fingertips
off yeah I was up on a mountain get work
dad that's what I do I try to be safe
these guys are just wrapping up their
like major seriously epic movie and you
need a couple shots of where'd you say I
just want to see maybe skyline or the
River Bridge something okay linking on a
scale of one to Tony Hawk how good are
you want to boost it board
I was just different from boosted
boarding in Utah
and there's the Brooklyn Bridge as
promised
so this is the Brooklyn Bridge this is
the Brooklyn Bridge
that's the Manhattan Bridge and then
it's Louisbourg bridge over there the
premise of their video is like traveling
the world with their gold point you have
the thing with the gold play button as
like this World Tour thing and this is
one of the shots that is New York City
it's a bit scratched after my tour it's
really heavy its own it's 11 pound that
I think it'd be that heavy but all right
do your thing then we got a couple more
good locations for you guys
Oh
oh now hold on on out we sit board down
let us go going down at the robbery mode
/ - you should have been number one I
gotta go get it
oh no I gotta get it back
oh I got I don't have a plan yet so
slippery I feel like I got to get in the
water which ones Islands here

it's doing here naked
I can't see underneath this pure
so they're oh look at that
loose aboard rescue mission yeah

on its feet Hills god what a day for a
swim
Casey nice work my fault no big deal
then they'll be til I see a portal
filthy anyways it needed to be clean
blinking red that can't be a good thing
where's the controller good news and bad
news good news is we have three boosted
boards that it is bad news is one of
them is completely soaked
well to see if I can get any water out
of my shoes my pants
my pants are drench my shoes are
completely soaked the boosted board we
tried to turn it on we got no love it's
like I've never seen the light on the
bottom flash before and it's flashing
all kinds of colors there's literally
water coming out of the motors here
boosted board down Lincoln you and I'll
ride boosted boards your dad has no
Zhanna in the fat just good dry my pants
off you're in time this is a paint
stripper peached so he's really high
feet - uh yes I should probably wash
these pants now is it time to cut that
it's time I have a couple of ideas I
mean we have to use the annual Rinder
here how do you think and then we cut it
this way or do we put it in down that
way and just go down probably down okay
let's sit in that place I can pull you
might have to go in this spot
again let's think this through
there's no sauna in the showing the
traffic came up a little bit all you see
is black has no solid let's turn the
table
everything should always have real
linking where are you when when you're
dead that's it all right this is it
they're gonna do it is that it you have
more things to shoot or just any credit
