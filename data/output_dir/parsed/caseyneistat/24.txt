how you doing I'm all right
we get always here out what's your
favorite part of Milwaukee Packers bucks
yeah football basketball of all the
exotic places I've been to in my career
ha
I've never been in the great state of
Wisconsin never been here never been to
never been in Milwaukee I'm happy to be
here though
the hotel
yep bar that associated with us right up
right up on the other side of the
building 10:00 in the morning we yeah
yeah it's not good to be in Milwaukee
pause welcome bucket and try and go for
a run
oh yeah hi hi so what am i doing in
Wisconsin well well I hope to explain
that thoroughly over the course of this
video but first I got a run see travel
troubles like the easies excuse to not
train I only got a push through that as
soon as I get to wherever I'm going
the walkie go downstairs now connect
with the squad and then try my best to
explain exactly what we're doing
Jessie welcome to walkie I that's right
Peter welcome to walkie what's up man
weird he said hi Jessie here and I and
Paul last winter we shot the holiday
movie with a visa which was nice
snowboarding around where were we
Norway Finland and this year we wanted
to take it a little bit further for like
a holiday Christmas movie but we needed
a location like we needed a shopping
mall I want to shoot in a shopping mall
and the best shopping mall we could find
was here in Wisconsin so today we're
here on a location scout youtuber one
youtuber - enabler one two and three
over here we're going to location now
yeah we're going okay
I think this is the mall that we're
gonna be maybe shooting at burn how you
doing I'm great good to see you in the
walkie okay are you excited for our
cruise I'm so sure we're doing it again
and again
one year later we're back almost exactly
almost exactly I need to introduce you
to people are calling it the best
romance on the Internet
I've heard Nick nice that you might want
to take your border with you really yeah
I think you did I've never seen you so
excited Falls exciting we're all adults
with our vlogging cameras on our
electric skateboards
all right we're going to the mall
see I was thinking for this video that
we need like a big open space like a big
bright woods it's light up here for this
video this video rasa maddening is a big
open bright holy look at this place oh
my god
we have a lot of people down there
because of safety issues and planning
issues to try to get this place up to
code we can actually like shoot
something in here properly but this is
like the canvas look at this look at
this place it's like the childhood
fantasy completely open kind of in
decent condition know in good conditions
shopping mall
so all we're doing here today we're
checking out the space see see what
see if it's safe in here and
kind of plain
so far mine will
these are the blueprints of this entire
mall we just did we just did a tour of
the whole mall we've got a pretty good
understanding of what of what can happen
in here and what we're not allowed to do
in here our Christmas idea is pretty
ambitious but I think it's achievable
it's gonna happen why are you so tan I
live on the beach called Chile and one
thing that seems kind of interesting is
that nobody's given us and any issues
about like like you're the safety or
you're not allowed to do this you're not
allowed to do that it's like open season
you got no nose for once we only have a
minute in here now there's a big
temptation for us to go crazy and film
in here but there's just a lot of people
and we don't want to get in trouble so
we're gonna like kind of leave now
skateboarding
we've got boosted boards we've got three
four megabytes so much storage the facts
never dated 12 18 2002
you guys I found the movie theater so
this is it right we can make the movie
in here all right so it's official this
is it we're gonna buy this mall for the
shoot right actually buy them all but
we're gonna this is gonna be where we're
gonna do our shoot no we're gonna buy it

okay guys good to go guess we've worn
out our welcome
back at the airport that was like I got
here nine nine hours in Milwaukee
Milwaukee it's been great thanks for
having me you coming in so that's it
nine hours later headed back to New York
City you know last year did human flying
drone which was like that that was like
a pretty big ambitious part of the
biggest movie I made last year this year
Samsung said they were willing to do
something again I'm being cryptic I know
I'll fill you in as soon as I can but it
is a very exciting idea
it seemed that abandoned shopping mall
caught me like I'll be pumped all right
I can't wait to make this movie I can't
wait to share this movie for another
times New York City
it's
