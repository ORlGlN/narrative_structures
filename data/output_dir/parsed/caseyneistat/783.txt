is that it
is that our Mercedes
I've had seven cars in my life this is
what my first car look like that's my
kid there
my second car was a hand-me-down
that's me fixing it after a minor
accident then I got this 35 year old
blue truck it was super cool but not
overly reliable loved it though then one
day it just exploded on the side of i-95
these things happen I guess
replaced it with a slightly newer but
equally unreliable truck my fondest
memory of the station wagon was my kid
my grandmother helping me make a video
to sell it come on Owen get with it I'm
cold what a sport which brings me to
number 6 my first real car the car he
learned to drive on he did good and you
stop it
I've always liked Mercedes I like my
grandfather's 1980 300d and the 63 230
SL that my mom bought without telling my
dad and my car it's great so when I was
asked to make a TV commercial for
Mercedes news CLA I was psyched but I've
never made a car commercial not one like
these anyways
I wouldn't know where to begin I want to
make a commercial my way the way I make
all my movies I drew up a plan of what
my way would look like Mercedes said
give it a try and that's the Mercedes
project they asked me what I needed to
get started I set a new car
so that's the mission they give me the
resources I need and I make them a
kick-ass commercial
Oscar is it thanks huh what do you do
now press the button I wanna
yeah
