I don't want to alarm anyone but it's
been four days since my skateboard
accident look at my hand good hand bad
hand how fat it is
what are you doing taking down the
tinfoil just like funny this is serious
no this is funny Candice Francine what
are you going with your own shades Oh
what is going on here this is my normal
commute to the office but the streets
are closed down there's a zillion
children around it is all this
it's like Tribeca Film Festival happens
every year hello this is for the first
of all yeah
that girl has a set of lungs on her it's
Saturday I had to come into the office
and Candace had to go to her office this
is what it's like when your parents but
you both own your own businesses I'm
about to eat out here though yeah but
before I do there's one thing I want to
quickly dive into okey-dokey this is a
Casey nice that comprehensive product
for ah the ink is everywhere this is a
product for review as you regular
viewers know my go-to vlogging camera is
a Canon SLR camera on the end of this
bendy thing with a microphone on the top
the Canon 70d has been my go-to for a
very long time it's stable it works it's
fairly lightweight I've been very happy
with this camera then a few months ago
Canon announces its successor the a TD
terrible name say a TD three times has a
dee da dee da dee dee and I was the
first person on planet earth to get an
early version of the a dee dee sent to
me by two friends at B&H camera store
and kam camera store both great stores
check them out now this thing was
supposed to be better than the old one
in every way and I can tell you after
working with it for like a month now
beating the hell out of it using it day
in and day out it is not the focus works
better and it takes a better picture but
this thing's have very serious
reliability issues like major like this
past week ever do you see that I hit
record and it goes love it now it's back
wrong it just did it I hit record it
flickers on it flickers off it's like
hers on it flickers off happens to me
like at least once or twice a day never
happened with this thing on top of that
I've had made her audio issues with the
Canon a TD across two different
microphones the same microphones I used
with the old one and never had
so today I announce I am retiring my new
Canon a DD and I'm taking out of
retirement my old Canon 70d everything
old is new again what everything oh ok
real quick
protip here if you take a piece of
scotch tape and you carefully and you
carefully make a little pull tab here
for the screen then when you've got the
busi board controller in one hand and
the camera in the other hand
but you need to flip the screen around
you just pull it around with your teeth
it makes things a lot easier you're
curious about any of the other gear I
use it's all linked below
how about tuck your office shake him up
okay I'm coming up now that you're free
now ready yeah hey look at this guy
well this is my old tiny apartment toys
how did you do that when I couldn't hear
oh my God look at this
you hit so you hit something this hard
and you didn't hear it and then at the
next stop I saw that this was like this
and I was like oh that must be the sound
I heard and when I pulled in here and
the guy was like what happened to your
car I was like what do you mean this
