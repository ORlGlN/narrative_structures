with some dancing some early-morning
dancing yeah it's kind of getting into
it
I can fudge
all right you have a good day oh man I
love this town Manhattan is an island
it's really not that big but it's not
super easy to get around the subway is
like slow a little bit complicated
taxis are hard to find in they're
expensive there's over now but the
loophole to the city is a bicycle on a
bike you can get anywhere you need to be
for the most part in all five boroughs
in about 20 minutes
Staten Island notwithstanding the price
for riding a bike is high though I've
never owned a bike for more than maybe a
year before it's been stolen you get
hurt all the time they break a lot but
if you make the choice if you ride the
bike your relationship with this city is
so much better
we packed it in here
yes Candace I dropped the worst thing I
could have possibly dropped yes what do
I do
oh this isn't it and well at all
daddy's trying to get his bike down
the construction workers put my bike up
in the loft here but it's out now
minimal casualties just this and the
paint can of course I did an exercise
this morning
I always feel terrible when I don't
exercise in the morning it's like it's
like a hard reset what do you think
Becca it's like a hard reset that I need
every day like give me some exercise in
the morning and the whole day is great I
didn't exercise with support still
trying to kick this pole

my bike a while trapped in my apartment
see my apartments been under
construction and the entire time is
under construction my bike was sort of
like stuck up in the loft but it's back
we have a no smoking policy here in the
office but that doesn't mean we
discriminate against our employees who
choose to enjoy a cigarette from time to
time let me show you our smoking lounge
it's an outdoor lounge to terrace with a
view and currently it's being taken
advantage of by one of our one of our
team members by the name of Adam swim
how's it going out there

thought what if we go to the apartment
triumphant you know you're like to wait
in front of the light weeks in to the
rest of the room so you'd like okay

usual spot
this place is not a doubt one of my
favorite restaurants

electrical fire waiting to happen that's
the radio awesome

showing us the bill this is like a blind
state that they're going to charge us
