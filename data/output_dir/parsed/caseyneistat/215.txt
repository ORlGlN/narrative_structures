in the show but I remember ever
premiered I asked him I said Owen did
your friends at school see you in the
show and he said dad my friends don't
watch TV and I was wearing to the big
step back in my career would they watch
when he explained to you I wrote it down
I decided to do just that so thank you
very much
thanks Amy stick with me I got this for
making videos and putting them on the
Internet
I say that not from a place of arrogance
I just end this video by saying that
because I click the same upload button
that everyone else can click and that is
like a beautiful wonderful thing that
never existed before we all have access
to the same things and if we leverage
those tools correctly like I have was on
a stage tonight with Elton John that's
insane
