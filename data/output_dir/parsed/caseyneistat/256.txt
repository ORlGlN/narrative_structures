apartments in the sky
it's kind of incredible
I just sleep the Oscar

Center buzzer everywhere today enjoy
your day in New York for eternity clear
over
Minister Lani

play bye-bye thank you very much thank
you all right back in New York see try
to get back to the city
who's to worry about that morning run
just want to reiterate again that was my
all-time greatest airplane seat ever she
tucked me in this is not a paid
advertisement this is not a Peter did
you say she tucked you in while feeding
you cheese she tucked me in and then I
did one morning morning
Kasey's me so Oscar I'll see you in the
office in about an hour
all righty amazing trip Thanks you want
a Jolly Rancher this guy's got an
incredible supply
I got a strawberry coming at you
you
did you miss me did the baby miss me
I came home just to get changed and
stuff but I'm like so groggy from only
sleeping for two hours on a plane I
think I'm gonna go for a run it's so hot
it's still hot it's high noon
high noon pure Sun no wind so ha oh so
hot there's a severe heat warning today
heat advisory today in New York City so
it's like it's like danger hot out there
I don't have a boosted board I left them
all at the office I feel like I'm
marooned on a desert island without a
boat or a paddle walking is the most
inefficient means of getting around the
city
no more cheeseburgers you must be so
sick of me saying that number one it
sure does still going to be back in this
studio number two well look see this see
this severe injury here I'm not going to
go as far as to say this is
life-threatening but that is a pretty
serious wound
tis but a scratch a scratch your arms
off that wound was inflicted by my iPad
see here's what happens this is my
official drone iPad this is the one that
I got for free and all right all those
times that I'm on my skateboard and
flying the drone at the same time I fall
most of the time and slowly but surely
these cracks have turned into like this
life-threatening wound here I don't know
how this thing still works look it
there's literally a hole so this is part
of the reason why there hasn't been as
much drone action in these vlogs as of
late I'm going to take this and see if I
can get it
truly remarkable how often just leave
and forget the damn camera
how long do we have until it starts
raining first yes two minutes
yeah you better get there hurry up
amid the Apple store it's not raining
that was thunder shoot man
question two guys the hair I have to
okay I'm just straight-up chickening out
on this whole mission he said there was
like are you doing a fairly substantial
charge and it's about to start pouring
out and there was a line maybe I'll come
back mission are you getting an
emergency alert are you feeling for the
storm yeah just got an emergency alert I
got to get back to the studio really
pushing it trying to get a smoothie
party Thomas hurries times turned out
yeah did you get that warning I was just
talking to somebody about it peace full
speed full speed back to the office it's
about to get bad
all right I I love a good story I don't
want to miss this one I'm gonna be more
prepared I'm putting on some foul
weather gear I got some pink flip-flops
all right I'm going out switching over
to go wait nothing get through this
13 that's a pretty serious rainstorm but
they said hail I didn't see any hail
Cantus offered to come pick me up hope
that offer still stands
definitely not boosted board whether
this is sort of an impromptu mailtime
I'd like to say thank you to red kin for
sending me this towel I would also like
to thank I'm unique for sending me this
sweet sweatshirt without your generous
mail time packages I would be both wet
and cold right now
oh yeah here
Joey's you out of here okay leaving the
office slightly damaged
food I guess holy smokes it's raining
out huh scary
lightning scared of lightning
you are blocking the entirety of the
Westside it is completely your oh no
you're supposed to wait behind the line
that I was supposed to turn right
