there are there are two things in life
that I think really define who you are
as a person really shaped who you are as
a person there's education and there's
experience and when it comes to
experience there's the kind that you
pursue like a trip or deciding to like
kiss that girl for the first time or
kiss that boy for the first time and
then there's the kind of experience that
just happens to you like when I got hit
by a car and broke my leg and those
experiences they they have a huge impact
on who you are and they affect who you
are for the rest of your life
anyways I say it cuz I want to talk
about an experience today one that I'm
like a little bit I'm a little bit
insecure about talking about because
I've never really gotten into it before
no really anyways this morning I'm
running with my friend Lindsey
a journalist at the New York Times she's
a super awesome girl and she's also a
very fast runner there she is
there's Lindsay she's coming in fast
he's coming in hot
sorry I kept you waiting oh yeah awesome
it's where we going 12 miles of an 805
pace great run with Lindsay it's fun
running with someone else
should do that more do it again all
right do it again Frannie that's a good
step that's a good step
good work friends good work high five
good work
we let the baby cry yourself to sleep
it's called self soothe and never easy
normally my vlogs are about really happy
things and like super uplifting
narratives and today I want to talk
about something that's Lou that's not
happy I want to talk about something
that's super scary so I just wanted to
give a warning that if you want
something that's like happy or chipper
like yesterday's vlog that you just
rewatch yesterday's vlog because today
is not going to be a happy wanted maybe
you should skip it
I want to share my September 11th story
now I've told pieces of this before in
other videos I've referenced this before
I've never really gotten into like what
that time was like for me personally or
what that day was like for me personally
this seems like an appropriate forum for
that first just like a touch of context
I moved to New York City in on June 4th
2001 literally exactly on June 4th 2001
when I moved here I had a three month
sublet so in a place to stay for three
months after those three months I moved
into a friend's couch that was in the
financial district that was literally a
half a block from the Twin Towers like a
friend's sweet apartment and he was
broke so I had to stay on the couch on
the morning of September 11th I remember
a noise just like a crushing noise and I
stuck my head out the window like this
and I just remember seeing paper falling
and then my roommate came running out he
turned on the TV and there was no news
there was like nothing he's like what is
that and there was nothing and then like
it came on and it was the first shot of
like the building on fire this is before
like terrorism was all anyone talked
about it wasn't even in my my scope of
consideration but I immediately like
grabbed my bag grabbed my video camera
which was this hold on literally
literally this video camera I grabbed it
I grabbed it and I ran out the door I
remember walking towards the front door
of the apartment and my cameras recorded
it turned into something that I can only
describe as
an unbridled fear and confusion and
absolute terror so what I saw and I
remember this like vivid I could draw
you a picture of where everything is
located it's so vivid so vivid in my
mind was what looked like car parts and
they were clearly airplane parts
scattered along the street like pieces
of parts and then there were and then
there were like pieces of along the
street and there was a guy there there
was like an EMT or something and he just
had a stack of sheets this high and he
was running around throwing the sheets
over that to just cover it I was seeing
the sheet hitting the ground and then
like red coming through the sheet and I
was terrified like I was recording with
my camera like this and when that
happened like the camera went down and I
was terrified
and I looked up and the building was
burning it above me and then I got on my
bike and started right away when I got
far enough away from the the towers
actually like see them I picked my
camera up to film it and I remember I
like zoomed it on this shot of all these
firefighters just rushing into the
buildings like them parking their trucks
right under the buildings rushing into
those buildings and that is the most
haunting memory of that day because
there's no way any of those guys
survived they're all just rushing in I
biked to my brother's apartment I
grabbed him and he and I raced to the
nearest hospital we were just like
people don't need help let's go in the
midst of all that chaos looking down
what is it 6th Avenue 7th Avenue looking
down the Avenue which was my favorite
view of the World Trade Center like this
long Canyon asked Avenue these huge
beautiful towers at the end and I just
remember seeing one of the towers fall
and I can only describe it as like it
looked like CGI it fell and there was
like this long spine which was side of
the tower just remained it like fell and
then this just like poof turned to
powder and it
so that was my day it's haunted me
forever
I always said like there's really only
three times in my entire life
where I remember being scared like truly
scared too or when my first kid was born
in my second kid was born because that's
a terrifying experience and the last
time I was really genuinely scared was
trying to go to sleep on my brother's
floor on the night of September 11th and
all you could hear were fighter jets Wow
they had Humvees and military personnel
outside the apartment because you
weren't allowed south of 14th Street
unless you had ID and I just didn't know
I didn't like the night before I went to
bed and I woke up to buildings falling
in people dying and now I'm going to bed
again what's gonna happen tomorrow and
that feeling of terror is very real and
has never escaped me here's some of the
footage from that from that terrible day
see this was when these are the firemen
like all rushing in this is me biking
through nearby these are all people
waiting outside that's a real Trade
Center right they're burning
that's that's 20 year old Casey scared
out of his mind riding my bike up the
Westside Highway to get away from get
away from the towers and there they are
burning don't take this the wrong way I
was glad to have been here when it
happened
can't imagine something like that having
happened and having to read about it or
see it on TV
being here and knowing what that was
like he's an experience that I hold
great value in okay sorry for having the
vlog this part of the vlog would be such
a downer for today I felt compelled to
share that the reason why I was
compelled to share that whole story is I
have to go to a fitting or that I put
clothes on me today at Conde Nast and
their offices are in the New World Trade
Center building
Oh
One World Trade Center two that photo
locked hi this is Casey I'm trying to
meet Alison I can't figure out how to
get out of your Lobby this Bank so much
there this is exactly like the men in
black headquarters look at all this
amazing clothing I think this is the
right idea we found a winner
regarding the suit go with blue look so
good
let's try it with the white right now
I'm being fitted for pajamas
I want a kung fu champion that's the one
where I live for so what's the problem
I mean I like to have them I love the
flow unit I feel like a Mortal Kombat
character I don't look like I'm a good
like through our thing
thank you for my pajamas see you
tomorrow night okay just to make sense
of that the Met Gala is Monday night
this is my pass for the Met Gala
tomorrow night it's some sort of Vogue
magazine pajama party which this sounds
too fun not to say yes to especially for
giving me pajamas that special situation
was about I forgot my mom's in town and
my sister organized this lunch I feel
like such a bad family member right now
nice that family you know those days
where no matter how fast you ride your
bike no matter how brief you keep the
meetings there's always behind you can
never catch up today
