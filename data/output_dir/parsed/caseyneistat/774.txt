a lot of people talk to me about my
glasses so let's talk about my glasses a
few months ago I flew out west to shoot
a car commercial at the Bonneville Salt
Flats now it was a two-day shoot and the
weather was not in our favor so day one
and it's raining out now we
definitely should not have been shooting
on the salt in the rain the super toxic
salt water gotten everything wrecked a
bunch of our camera gear and pretty much
everything else it touched for some dumb
reason I kept the window open during
most of the shooting
so I too was covered in this viscous
liquid eventually the rain stopped and
when that happened everything turned
white including me and my glasses
we finished the shoot blue back to New
York I was looking through the footage
and I found this picture of myself with
the salt bordering my lenses and I
thought that looks awesome
salt washes off I needed to make it
permanent started with these folding
black sunglasses step 1
an important step removing the label
from the lens on pair of sunglasses Jake
didn't have a label elwood didn't have a
label no ma'am we're musicians mine
can't have a label
you
for the white to look right I had to use
primer not flat and not gloss in primer
the first rule of spray painting is
short even sprays but I didn't want even
I wanted the paint to soak into the
border of the lens popsicle stick wood
is softer than both the plastic frames
and glass lenses
it shouldn't scratch shouldn't sometimes
you have to wreck things to make them
your own call it creative destruction
you
