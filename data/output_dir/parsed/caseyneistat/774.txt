I've got a whole bunch of tattoos my mom
hates them but I keep getting him like
when I got hit by a car broke my leg in
27 places then two years later did an
Ironman I had to get a tattoo for that
or when I was in that slump hadn't made
a movie in a year and needed a reminder
I never thought I'd see 30 I never
thought I'd have to say goodbye
and there's no way to unsee Glengarry
Glen Ross a always BBC closing always be
closing
always be closing anyways for me tattoos
represent a moment or an experience or
idea something I don't want to forget
something I want to be reminded of every
day for the rest of my life
okay so this was 18 months ago
Max and I had flown 27 hours to the
other side of the planet what do you do
the common law of the protocol because
we read online about the devil's pool
this tiny natural infinity pool at the
end of a 350 foot waterfall in Africa we
thought it would make a good scene in
our maked town movie we got off the
plane got in this dude's car and asked
him to take us to the devil's pool to
which he explained unfortunately the
difference between aesthetics clause
because water level has a reason we
traveled a very long way to go tell the
devil no oh yes the water levels were
too hot these two dudes in their
underwear took me swimming told me if I
got any closer to the edge I'd be sucked
over
and that was that we left in defeat we
never made it to the pool even at a
conversation on the ride to the airport
about how we'll probably never be back
here again like do you know when you
might ever return to Zambia in your life
now fast forward to last week I'm back
in Africa this time with my kid our
mission was singular get to the Devil's
pool and you know what we did it
get up go to the ball I don't know why I
made such a big deal about this I guess
I just hate trying and not succeeding
so there was this moment when I was
swimming across the river the pool
subsidy Oh
falen tiger fish I was bitten by a tiger
fish how cool it was like a rite of
passage this incredible experience
biting on my leg
saying don't forget this moment
you
