for me thank you
today's agenda for beam news includes
beam codes there are no more beam codes
anyone anywhere provided Road iPhone can
sign up for beam and it just works
thanks for your patience with that we're
now good no more codes so what that
means is either update your app and
you'll just be in or if you don't use
beam just download it and you're just in
Android akshay and our Android
development team are working really hard
to get beam on Android
look that's an old Android phone look
that's being here's what it looks like
this is broken early but we've got it so
far where you can almost post you can
almost send reactions it almost works
next up beam cards this is awesome now
when you go into your settings you'll
see at the top a really cool picture
that says beam and there's four images
there those are randomly selected from
your last four beams click share send it
to Twitter or wherever you want to send
it and this amazing beautiful card goes
out and then if anyone clicks on that
card or your link they automatically
follow you in beam so share those
everywhere Facebook Twitter wherever you
want also everyone now has their own
beam address
I'm beam dot-com slash Casey go there
and you'll see the same beautiful card
so you can put those anywhere they're
pretty awesome

out we're gonna have a bean store where
we sell all this crap
eventually until then we're just like
arbitrarily giving it away to anyone and
everyone and I do mean everyone we have
a team of four interns that work
full-time doing nothing but filling out
envelopes and stuffing them full of
t-shirts so if you're psyched on the
bean shirts but you want some of these
sweet bean stickers you can find us on
Facebook you can find us on Twitter send
us a message we'll try to get in touch

really trying to grow the new users on
Dean who's a lot more fun with friends
so like figure out how to get all your
friends to join and we'll send you a
whole bunch of stuff I don't know how
when we would validate that or whatever
but if you can figure out how to
convince us you've got all your friends

have a couple of these made they're so
expensive but we put in a huge order and

away and eventually sell them next up on
my daily vlogs that's not being news
that's my vlogs I'm going to now end
every vlog with a tiny video that you
guys send to me it's basically like a
30-second video where you say why
everyone should follow you and here's
what the video should look like here's
jack with all these guys and my username
on beam is Jack you should totally
follow me next week I'm wearing a tuxedo
for a very special event so stay tuned
he really is good by the way
email us your little videos at follow me
at beam comm make sure you say your
username and say why we should follow
you keep it under 30 seconds and they
don't have to look good or be pretty
like that one Jack's on his cell phone
