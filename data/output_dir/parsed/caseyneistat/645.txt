together and say it together all right

I told Candace I'd move her car this
morning I wish I hadn't told Candace out
mover caught this morning owning a car
in New York City is a terrible terrible
thing you can't park in the street or
someone will definitely with your car so
you have to put it in a lot but parking
lots are crazy expensive in this town
one hang one bye-bye
these are the new beam stickers I didn't
like them so we cancelled the whole we
cancelled the whole order I mean I think
they're like nice stickers is what they
look like the idea is right there just
like I don't know they don't really look
like anything so we cancel the order
every time I try to record here these
sirens go off and they mess up my sound
and I can't finish my recording oh great
it's my building
that's my landlord
so yeah being on Broadway is cool at all
till the fire department wrecks your
shoot every single time you try to
record something I'm filming in here
there's like so many kids outside right
now uh okay just take my point-and-shoot
say hi for me
give them all the stickers okay okay not
all okay thanks Jeff okay apologies to
the kids outside
I'm busy vlogging I can't come say hi
anyways before I was interrupted by the
Fire Department of New York City we're
not going to go ahead with these
stickers I didn't like them we're going
to make awesome bean stickers I promise
and we're give them to everyone speaking
of beam this week is beam wait on the
vlog and that means this whole week I'm
going to be talking about beam about the
new company which is a mobile app a lot
brace yourselves
today though I'm going to talk about
talking about I want to talk about
talking about beam let me start right
let me start by saying some really kind
individuals have commented below and
some equally kind individuals have
commented on Twitter saying Casey's just
blogging so we can talk about his app
and they've said that's really lame well
let me confirm yes I'm vlogging so I can
talk about my app I started this vlog as
a place to like share Who I am and my
life and my experiences my stories with
the universe and this company is my life
this company is my everything and I'm
really excited that it will be revealed
for the first time on this vlog to you
the people that I've tuned in every day
to watch me like paddle board and hang
around my baby you will now be the first
to know about what I have been up to
what my team has been up to what we've
all worked so hard on for so long
I think Marlins here you got something
huge and heavy for me Marlin yeah really
okay always a pleasure thank you this is
not mail time this is something else
because I'm pretty sure I know what this
is and let me start by saying this is
not a paid endorsement if this is what I
think this is it is what I think it is
this company in San Francisco emailed me
saying that the hoverboard that I use
this thing was not a real hoverboard
that that they make a real hoverboard
mystic and that they'd set anyone to
check out holy good God look at this
thing can't wait to ride this I will say
that the dudes at one wheel the company
that makes this when they send it to me
they said make sure you read the
instructions first but I like to I like
to see how intuitive these things are so
figured it out this feels much more
dangerous than then the hoverboard oh
god it's heavy
okay it's a little bit like surfing this
thing is way more robust than the little
plastic hoverboard it's like riding a
surfboard down Broadway this thing blows
the doors off of those plastic Chinese
hoverboards american-made
videos on YouTube man hey I'm Casey -
awesome
Shay nice to meet you
Oh
I think I'm just gonna leave that there
for now you know I like when you go
skiing in your backyard on a sled hill
or whatever and you're like I'm really
good at skiing so then you go to the
biggest scariest black diamond mountain
and you get the top and you're like this
was a terrible idea well that is the
bunny slope and that is the Black
Diamond today was an incredibly
stressful day in the office everybody
always asked how I'm always in such a
permanent good mood I'm not it's just I
only feel like hitting record on the
camera when I'm in a good mood so in the
vlogs it seems like I'm always in a good
mood but I promise you I'm not today it
was like a stress ball nightmare tornado
hurricane of a day and my only moment of
happiness is racing around on that crazy
crazy super fast death machine
you
