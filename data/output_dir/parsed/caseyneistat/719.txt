keep calling man you got it
for all the romanticizing I do of New
York City there are frustrations there
are times living near is really tough
and those frustrations are really
amplified since we have the baby it's
little things like if you want to jump
in the car and go to the store you
actually jump into a taxicab if you want
to go for a walk down the street you're
going for a walk on the streets of New
York City on sidewalks that are like
super densely populated with people you
don't know this isn't meant to sound so
so negative but it can get frustrating
can get tough and it definitely at times
leave you like yearning for some some
wind that doesn't involve taxi cab
exhaust all that I'm in my apartment
right now by the way but I record this
inside Candis is over here giving the
baby a bath what are you guys doing in
the bath pretty early on a Saturday
morning today we are giving Francine
real baby food for the first time ever
so Candace asked I run and get my big
camera so we can film it which is a
great idea but I am realizing that I'm
out in public and I'm not dressed
to be out public she likes it she does
this work
Oh shame shut it criminal thing in her
mouth today's family day
Candice is over there negotiating
whether we can or cannot bring a
stroller in here hey where's my sister
Jordan how'd you find this place
Jordan we ordered a picture of
margaritas I'm in
what are we doing now
walking up up where

idea DSL bells for bikes

or the baby like it yes long day out
taking a taxi home now
finally home after a long day out
straight to the tub Candace straight to
the top straight to the tub for the baby

begin to tell you how infrequently we go
out and socialize

go out and socialize all the time
