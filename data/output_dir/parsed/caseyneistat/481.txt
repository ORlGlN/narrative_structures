I have a lot of responsibilities here at
beam headquarters today those
responsibilities include making
everybody grilled cheese sandwiches
how'd they turn out holy this is so
good
glow tomorrow morning bright and early
we leave for LA for Christmas break
later today something I've been looking
forward to for a very long time remember
I used to go to dollar pizza every day
anyway today's a very full day but first
cute head
eight-time cute and eight times I really
want to do a new QA intro but that one
is so good and it was so hard to make
richard asks have you not lost your Ray
Bans Richard I've lost like 20 pair of
these I just have a whole bunch of them
and on top of that I actually engraved
my name into the side and funny story
one time when I was shooting this movie
for j.crew I was surfing in Mexico they
fell off my face into the ocean gone
forever and then like a month later I
get a collect call from Mexico in
Spanish a girl found them and she mailed
them back to me what are you most
excited for about 2016 you know I love a
new year time to hit the reset button
think like what do I want to do this
year set goals for yourself forget about
the years past and just focus on the
future so I know that's a very generic
answer but I am always looking forward
to like starting anew I want to become a
photographer but nobody in my family is
supporting me and they think it's a
phase what do I do
jaesi anytime someone doubts you
like there's only one thing you can do
and that is prove them wrong
I was wondering number one what is the
happiest moment in your life so far and
number two what has been the happiest
time in your life so far good questions
happiest moment very easy when when my
kids were born the happiest time in my
life that's a much harder question
assessing a happiness in life is easiest
to do in retrospect meaning it's really
easy to look back and be like god I was
so happy then it's much harder to like
examine where you are at any given
moment and be like I'm so happy right
now and I hope this doesn't sound
annoying but I really think that right
now is the happiest time in my life I've
got like a new baby that's no longer a
baby but it's like I'm still married
which is a miracle and it's great I've
got my company which is like exciting
every day I've got vlogging which is new
to me and I love it right now is a very
exciting time in my life and I feel like
when I'm an old man some day I'm going
to look back at now and be like wow
that was it that's why I don't sleep
right now that's why I'm like go go go
right now is because I have such an
appreciation for how awesome every day
is and I don't think that that is
sustainable I don't think that will last
I'm just trying to like absorb it while
I can
great question George Cortez asks when
you have free time what's your favorite
thing to do I don't I want to know why
are you so focused on New York City in
your vlogs these days my relation may be
because my relationship with this city
is changing so quickly since having a
baby and I just think about it a lot
wherever I think about is what bleeds
into the vlog last question this
question dovetails nicely with the
previous question how did you feel when
you moved to New York City from
Connecticut how did you cope at such a
young age the hardest part was the
loneliness like I didn't really know
anyone in the city when I moved here I
remember going home after work to my
tiny apartment it was like I had no one
to hang out with that no one to call I
had nothing to do and that lasted for
like I feel like years
that kind of loneliness what was your
question hard like taupe I spent a lot
of time like in my head dreaming and
fantasizing about a life in this city
that I aspired towards alright thank you
as always for Q&A that was fun now
this is something I've been looking
forward to for a very long time my

amazing the story of how I met him I had
a pair of jeans from Jean shop from his
