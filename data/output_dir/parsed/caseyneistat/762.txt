I've been making movies for as long as I
can remember
you see I started somewhere around 2000
2001 but I didn't launch my main youtube
channel until 2010 so there's this
entire decade of work of my movies that
isn't online and that's my new YouTube
channel Casey nice fat classics if
you're into nostalgia and low resolution
video you should probably check it out
you
