supposed to be there in about ten
minutes and it's about a 25-minute bike
ride from where I am right now
so I'm going to bike over them
I'm going to bike over the Williamsburg
Bridge which is a pretty steep incline
for about a 1.2 miles up 1.2 miles down
I think maybe it's 1.2 miles across
anyways it's a pretty gnarly workout and
it's 92 degrees out right now so I'm
going to arrive at this thing covered in
sweat which is the only way I like to
arrive at anything Hey all right I'm now
over the hump of the bridge I just
passed the apex so it's literally
downhill from here all right
