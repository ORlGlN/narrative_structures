Oh
welcome to the Sunday edition of the
vlog today is kind of a special day
today is the last day that Owen my older
kid will be in New York City because
next week he goes to college
we're going to try and do something fun
SoulCycle is somewhere between like a
spin class and going to a nightclub how
did you describe it
just to hear for like one second to pick
something up then we're leaving we're
going to get out of the city now for the
rest of the afternoon
gonna head south we're going to the
beach
alright that was a long ride out here
so this part of the world is called Far
Rockaway Beach and this is technically
New York City like we're within the five
boroughs here on this side of me is
Jamaica Bay which is a body of water
there and then all the way over yonder
is the actual Atlantic Ocean it's a very
interesting part of the world Owen how
it's ever been here before
is rock
we're good
right
this is Jamaica Bay Queens
never in my life live it out here look
at these houses that are just on stilts
over the water and this is Queens New
York this is New York City
this is the coolest boat I've ever seen
it's got a diving board rope swing a
waterslide two trampolines what else is
on that boat two trampolines rope swing
three different levels of high dives a
motor a bunch of kids climbing all over
it
and a water slip of this page incredible
just is not carefully in both being fun
is really what's the best thing to jump
off I like the diving board I think
because like it's so high like you feel
like you're going to smack your face in
obliterated a so the best thing is the
roll because you swing off and then at
the end II let you come back up I
thought I'm going within that rope is
awesome opponent you want to go on this
thing
yes so look we're a little old for it
it's fine whatever right going down to
the Tarzan boat you're going to swim out
there and meet him I wish there were an
easier way
come on the Tarzan bow Oh what's the
verdict you know flip somebody do a flip
I'll do a flip
that was a ridiculously super stupid fun
afternoon heading back to the city now
we're like super late on mrs. train he's
trying to reschedule I got a milkshake
and an Egg McMuffin yes
oh and don't you kind of feel that the
that Tarzan boat thing is something
you'll see on BuzzFeed in like four
years that says can you believe this
actually existed before it like about
the the fact there's a relationship
between danger and fun
take a selfie where everybody gave me
like that I remember I made some fans
here out in Rockaway
