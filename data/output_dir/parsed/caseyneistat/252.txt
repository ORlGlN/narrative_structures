Oh
Oh
this this is the story of failure we
tried to do something and we failed the
facts as to why we failed are relevant
because in the end we failed this is the
behind the scenes of a short movie which
if you haven't seen yet you can see here
it's a fantastic movie
and what about happiness and success but
underneath that is a lie because we try
to do something and we did not succeed
and that failure is not represented in
this movie so this behind the scenes is
that story
all right so we're taking a quick break
here all right so ready that keeps me
what's happening right now okay so now
we filled up we're going to fly another
20 miles that way and we're going to
pick up the jet ski on a 50 foot long
line and sling it into the icebergs yeah
we're gonna zap strap it just cinch it
down I don't know any of these what the
hell is as abstract as a strap it's like
those little things that SAP okay let's
go
I think I'm gonna go on the grass in
front of you and I'll go farther down
Bianca you could go right in front of
the truck and I'll take farther down
well okay I'll move the truck and then
you have all this sounds good
there's the jet ski yes place your help
Tama groans good the helicopters gonna
lift us huh hope so so too
if not we've come a fucking long way fur
cut now we got to get this thing in the
sky wait whoa what do you think I mean
why not right
what's worse could happen Oscar and Brad
just informed me were like two hours
behind schedule things thinking here it
is hold the wakeboard a jet ski will
pull the wakeboard yeah
what's happening um I think the
helicopter is spinning in a way that's
making Brad uncomfortable does he bring
it back down shit major issues major
issues safety is the most important
thing here we don't want to take any
chances so he's bringing it back but I
don't know what I don't really
understand the details of what's
happening
what happened up there that thing is way
heavier than 490 balance holy crap what
about a helicopter ah she doesn't
longline so can't fucking do that
you know it's private here's a real eye
is it ten thousand dollar fine this is a
pretty critical is a pretty critical
situation not sure what the what the
solution is
we're contemplating getting a different
helicopter but there's no way to even
call down there from here you know I got
in reach I could text that Meeker
okay it's been about an hour and a half
here's what we decided we've got another
helicopter coming in to lift the jet ski
it's going to be like an hour and a half
to get here we're going to go up the
icebergs now and shoot everything we
need to shoot before the ski gets here
so in the ski gets here we can get the
money shot and then get out we're going
up the glacier now we have some food
we're going to wait for the other
helicopter that's gonna bring this key
make it happen
you
this is the location this is a clay
through the jet ski
all religions are just kids
crazy hey hey hey buddy
oh my god so the other helicopter with
the jet skis gonna be here about two
hours throw me that camera
your homes their center chamber fell
better chambered on next chamber next
chamber
alright inflatable boat is ready now it
is time for some iceberg reconnaissance
this isn't quite as exciting as
I'll sit in the front by the way let's
straighten that iceberg
spin out on this year inflatable raft
about 20 minutes now let's cut through
there off here and see if we can guess
about passing on the wakeboard all right
so we're on the iceberg now not sure
what the plan is or how to get off of
here but it's pretty amazing never have
I ever set on an iceberg before the
chopper with the jet ski should be here
any second
like icebergs moving cuz I took it as a
way to get over here
Oh God
if you're anything like me and you
fantasize about climbing around in
icebergs it really is that awesome
still waiting on the jetski not entirely
sure when it's coming but I'd save
another hour and a half of sunlight so
gonna hang in there it is getting colder
out by the second but that's a fair
we're running low on food we're down to
our last protein bar did you eat all the
sandwiches hey most of them there might
be one turkey
jetty in the third helicopter I've
arrived I'm gonna put on the dry suit
it's go time
jesse is working go oh God
so cold I stepped in it for one second
and my feet both of my feet have like
brain freeze that's what it feels like
I'm ready my long list of bad ideas
how's it coming over there it's a ski
working no we're uh we'll stay out here
biryeo this way smaller stuff I can take
you in there but
get over here trouble this was it this
was the moment the singular mission of
wakeboarding through icebergs was about
to come to fruition the board was
trapped on my feet the ski was ready to
go the tow rope was fixed this was when
the moment of realization turned into a
moment of failure
after after all of this after all this
Jeff our jet ski driver drove for like
two minutes and I think there are rocks
in the intake and the jet ski is not
working I'm ready as ready as I'll ever
be to go
how much more light do we have honestly
35 minutes what's the alternative what
is a helicopter capable of tugging you
on a wakeboard get your ass is there
anything else that can tug Casey if the
jet ski doesn't work suturing colors
supposed to be well he's like the whole
fucking thing's all wonky
Eugene oh fuck fuck
they won't go it all here we heard
something fuck
you
we got three fire logs left well you
know that's it
that is what failure looks like
