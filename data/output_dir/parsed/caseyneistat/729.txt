is pouring rain outside and I'm soaked
so I have one solution for that this
heat gun is made for stripping paint it
will give you third-degree burns all
over your body but if you use it just
right it will dry your pants
ah
I probably get like five or six emails a
day that say Casey if you have any free
time I'd love to take you out for a copy
or if you have any free time I'd love to
buy you a beer and that's very sweet
it's it's very appreciated and extremely
flattering I thrive on the constant
stress that is having more things that I
need to do then I have time to do them I
always keep a backlog of things that I
need to do just in case I have a free
moment so I can do that I never want
free time free time is the enemy of
progress I hope that doesn't make me
sound crazy

go for a walk you want read Gigi come on
