what's up Sam you know Monday I think
you Monday
yeah pretty sure it's Monday I always
know it's Monday because you dress up
today's Monday back to work day you
might notice that this image is slightly
bumpier and less smooth than normal
that's because today I'm taking these
things just regular old feet to work
instead of my usual glowing hoverboard
it's kind of a disappointing way to
start the week nail time everybody loves
a tote bag some socks thank you

mail time package to date you win I
didn't mean to rip this in half help
yourself and if you want some lollipop

I met these guys in the street yesterday

that might be the most nefarious gift
I've been given to date but thank you
thank you thank you and yes that's
extremely relevant and that concludes an
L time for the day
Matt has taken advantage of the caramel
popcorn

I'm starving a candied apple with
popcorn so glad you're taking advantage
God look at my desk
finally out of the office I'm in a car
now with Matt and we're on our way to a
very business II business meeting so I
don't think this counts as getting out
of the office this is like getting out
of my office

the new company at a place called bata
works which is some sort of startup
thing
