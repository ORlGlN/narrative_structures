it's Sunday afternoon we're going to get
lunch right now
Candace's father is leaving later this
afternoon so we're you know we're doing
the family thing first but I have
something important and not so great
that I have to talk to you about get
into that later here they come
Candace does not look happy all right
let me help these ladies
ready close lunch is over
it was mildly successful crime scene at
a couple freak-outs
but then when her food came everything
was cool now we're like shopping what
are we doing now they were just walking
oh when we got into the Pakistani city
so cute hi City
Candice is leaving me at home alone with
the baby so she can go out with her
friends and her mom which is totally
great by me see
Candace's family her mother her father
they've been here since like Wednesday
so today is day five and it's great
having them here because that means we
have somebody help us with the baby and
all that stuff but it also means a lot
of family time ready for bed time
Francine watching cartoons while
Francine is entirely occupied with their
cartoons I thought I would answer a
question it seems to be coming up quite
a bit in the vlog and it's about both
these two photographs here which
honestly I'm surprised the lack of
maturity with my audience about these
two pictures um no that's not Candace's
naked but this is like a South African a
very famous apparently South African
artist and photographer Candice is a fan
these were gift for her but if you do
want to see like a really cute picture
of my beautiful wife okay that's Candice
on Halloween cutie huh show us your tips
get it that is a picture by some
photographer that he took of Candice
like God knows how long ago I hope you
guys will stop commenting about our
artwork in our apartment I think it's
very tasteful what you do bedtime
Candice is home the baby's asleep I'm
making a late night run to the office
there are a few things I have to take
care of before tomorrow morning
hey what's the code in 201 that was loud
I literally set the alarm every day
including yesterday and yet I still like
tonight just completely spaced on what
the code is for my own office and I set
the alarm off it was like the loudest
thing ever that's like the fourth time
this year I've done that the reason why
I always screw up the numbers of the
vlogs is because like I don't know what
it is but I have this disconnect in my
brain right just like I can't read
numbers I can do like big math problems
in my head I can't read numbers so
sometimes when I look at the alarm
keypad it's just like hmm just glad Jack
answered okay why am I in the office at
8:30 at night on a Sunday I started
today's vlog by saying I tend to share
with you that's not necessarily positive
I'm going on a trip this week one that I
am tremendously excited about I'm going
to Cuba on Tuesday the day after
tomorrow
family is making an investment in Havana
and I'm going there legally which is
amazing and Candis is coming with me I'm
going there as part of like a delegation
of technology entrepreneurs to meet with
influential people in Cuba to talk about
how tech can I don't understand all the
nuances but I'm very excited about it
like the thing that I was alluding to
this morning is that I've tried
everything I can I've done all the
research I can I don't know that I'll be
able to upload my vlogs from Cuba now
today is vlog number 250 and in 250 days
I've missed exactly zero uploads I'm
going to be horribly bombed if I can't
upload from Cuba I mean it's not the end
of the world I'll still be making vlogs
I'll just post them all when I get back
but I wanted to give you a heads up and
appeal for a little help maybe you're
not American maybe you are American and
by some loophole like me you got to
visit Cuba can you let me know in the
comments below or on Twitter like what
is the internet they're like alright
that's it I'm going to get back to
packing there's one big question mark in
my packing that I don't know if it's
going to come or not I mean the
temptation is strong
turn returns EEP
