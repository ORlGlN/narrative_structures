just straight up stay here Shan State
John you okay
Hey
I normally I ride the skateboard to him
from work but last night I came home on
this ridiculous electric motorcycle
thing so that time getting to work today
feel pretty ridiculous on this thing
haven't done an update on the new space
in a while things are really coming
along
now during the last update people
express a lot of concern over the
integrity of the loft behind me here
firstly I shared those concerns I just
didn't want to say things I didn't want
Dylan up there to feel bad but the lots
been reinforced and I mean you can have
an entire family of elephants up there
that thing's not going anywhere also the
lighting under the loft here is just
about done so now we have this space
here a space up there and then this
enormous space behind me where
production is going to take place major
progress
I haven't done a proper like tech camera
review and all the time people always
ask me about technology people is asking
about cameras it's something I want to
talk about more I think a lot of the
people that watch this channel are also
interested in filmmaking and things like
that so any opportunity I have to like
share insight having the gear is
something I'm psyched to do what this is
here is a piece of technology I'm super
excited about so I have like this I have
this big expensive camera stabilizer
here and then I also have the DJI Osmo
which is a tiny stabilized camera that
looks like this this thing's pretty
great but the image quality
it doesn't quite match like the digital
SLR this is an image stabilizer
for my camera that's supposed to be
really small this is not a product
endorsement I'm not being paid by these
guys
if this thing sucks I promise you I'll
tell you it sucks whoa all right so
theoretically how this let me get it
theoretically how this thing works you
take an SLR camera like this put it on
here hold it like this and it keeps it
perfectly steady seems a little too good
to be true for me but let me set it up
test it and I'll let you know what I
think
I must've done something wrong stings
going absolutely eight I got it balanced
it seems pretty good I'm going to run
around the studio now shooting in selfie
mode to see what this thing looks like
get ready
test number one
all right it looks pretty good I need to
play this thing I need to get into it
before I can give like a proper
thumbs-up or thumbs-down but I'm glad
the technology exists
Shawn it has brakes I don't know how to
use the brakes
I feel like it's gonna break so I just
jump off Shawn us for the best pizza in
New York City naturally I took him two
Joe's pip we got some sushi Canada to
New York City today what's up guys oh
hey show you to Miami high five
Shawn yeah come on dude
yes Jessica whoa
by itself this little bit light though
I'll boost it it's not dollar No
oh that is yeah what do you want nothing
for me I'm just it's not that I don't
want beats I do want pizza I'm just
trying to refrain from pizza for a
couple of days I'm meeting a lot of crap
lately so - pizza and the Snapple
Shawn wanted to eat in the park so we
ordered the park which is like three
blocks away but he's carrying his pizza
on the skateboard oh top impressive
Shawn
Pizza right there on the left Shawn your
other left here I am gonna die in that
intersection because there are cars
coming and I couldn't stop so I just had
to turn and go with it the look
successful pizza I ready for this first
fight being unhealthy is the best
feeling in the world Casey Jones RTD is
crushed so it's cheating but it's not
really
either you can live in a place like New
York City I like K I hated New York City
when I first came because I was just
like the town's your question no you
couldn't lift it out I couldn't I
couldn't hack it I'd die in like 18 days
do you recognize this is where we got an
hour per month slice this is where we go
so we're just doing some Jesus
straight-up stay here Sean straight you
want to raw vegan organic juice that
looks so much less cool than pizza
how was your New York City ish tour it
wasn't a tour it was you had V tide
juice it's gonna sort of sums up my
afternoon pizza's way better than juice
though yeah I don't think anybody's
gonna argue with you on that
this is Broadway show see Broadway is a
slight downhill lot of pedestrian
so don't beat yourself in subway
Shawn is a fantastic skateboarder but on
a boosted board
it's a booster board is so different
from regular skateboard and I don't
think he appreciates that enough
case in point him attempting to go down
these stairs here on an electric
skateboard
I told you oh sorry I didn't hear you
I'm sorry I won't skip mark we've
confiscated that to the rover dear oh no
I didn't hear you I won't skateboard
though no skateboarding on those stairs

town this joke this scene is going to
involve a profanity so if you're under
the age of 18 stop watching the next 40
seconds okay look somebody sent this to
