hey Francine would you like a cookie you
can eat that
okay she's still asleep
but I got on all my running gear and
when she wakes up we're gonna do a
daddy-daughter run which I've never done
before
okay I don't know if this matches but
look how cute she has this little dress
on and then look at these little look at
these little bloomers here we go
all right that's like two and half miles
we're gonna take a quick break here
because Francine needs a snack how does
this compare to your normal pace good
yeah oh we're gonna take a pause just to
take in this view
all right we're now about three and a
half miles out I'm having fun yeah it's
fun running isn't it I know I don't know
why mommy doesn't like it I'm gonna turn
around now and head back because as much
fun as Francine is having she is a
ticking time bomb
who could explode at any moment start
freaking out
she's started crying so do you want a
dummy yeah will you be good stopped
again I'm gonna make her a bottle move
the stroller seat back and hopefully
she'll fall asleep do you feel better
you just needed a bottle
ended up doing kiss under six miles at a
7:43 pace Francine got a croissant for
her recovery snack
we finally make it outside it's raining
out what do you want to do should we go
back inside to training I have this
plastic cover for the stroller to keep
the baby dry but I'm currently using
that plastic cover to keep my other
camera dry I feel like the baby's
waterproof whereas the camera will break
is that okay with you
it's sort of stopper
it's sort of stopped raining so we're
just chillin on a stoop
we have fun
oh yeah and so much fun Rani look it's
your Uncle Dean what's up Uncle Dean hey
Franny it's like the music nice to me
this definite like like chewy
it's straight up pouring outside swear
you're hiding
like 15 blocks from home there's no way

place here I have the baby under plastic
we're stuck in like we're north of
Houston and look it I got the baby
