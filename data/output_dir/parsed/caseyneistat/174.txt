therefore so we missed the plane
it is straight pouring outside this
morning I mean torrential rain for the
entire run no one is out here running
not one other runner no one just a
little wet though that was an even 10
miles at a 735 pick a very wet 735 pace
it is porn right now
look no one drop my controller I really
don't like taking taxis oh so we're
outside
man like garbage bags on the back
Courtney nice to meet you Carly I travel
across the country doing charity work on
my bike I love it then that please put
me on to your future
very cool nice to meet you should email
me I love you get in touch about your
charity works all right cool definitely
it's very nice to meet you stay dry you
just need the greatest people in this
city the poster board performs pretty
well on the rain it's a little bit like
riding a motorcycle in the rain
Jackson's still there you just got to be
careful generation 2 boosted boards are
supposed to be water sealed ask me if it
still works tomorrow I'll let you know
okay well I made it okay very very wet I
got a change of clothes in my backpack
and uh I don't know that was kind of fun
these heat guns are really good for
drying clothes and reheating food and
things like that they also work well to
strip paint which is their intended
purpose just never ever make the mistake
of trying to dry your hair with one of
these because they will melt your hair
Casey I met you in Nashville a couple
weeks ago skipper it's the kid that was
in the video from Tennessee that I was
skateboarding with skated the other side
of town now I met a kid named Austin
what's up Austin Austin it was awesome
to meet you in Nashville
thank you for the snow globe and I liked
the Confederate flag was appropriated
with stars in there ah Real Talk I don't
know if you can tell but like I've been
a little distracted lately extremely
distracted lately I try as hard as I
tend to hide that like from the vlog I
don't try to hide it because there's
stuff I don't want you to know I try to
hide it because because I'm not at a
place because there are things that are
happening right now but then I'm not
quite ready to share with the universe
with you and that makes me feel bad so
much of this so much of this vlog is
predicated on honesty and like me being
open and transparent with what's going
on in my life in my career with you the
audience and I'm definitely withholding
information right now I'll be in a place
where I can share very very soon but
there's a lot going on and it's like a
big sort of turn like a pivot or like an
inflection point in my personal life in
my career in my family life it's
wonderful and it's positive but it's
weighing your on me and it's like all
I'm thinking about and the fact that I
can't like sort of vent to my therapist
/youtube audience only sort of promotes
that frustration so yeah I don't mean to
sort of bring things down here I just
wanted to share with share with you a
little bit of like what's going on with
me right now that's all that's all like
regular vlogs everything's staying the
same nothing's changing everything's
changing nothing's changing I'll just
share more later
when I was driving my kiddo across
country to go to college we drove in a
minivan or some sort of weird vehicle
I brought my boosted board with me and
then I lost my electric skateboard in
Denver Colorado and I could not figure
out what happened to it like a week and
a half ago I got an email from I gotten
Alex
he works in a hotel that I stayed at and
he was like I think I've got your
boosted board because it has your name
engraved all over it I found you on the
Internet I would like to send it back to
you
booth said three the poky board is back
why do I always write my name on
everything because I always lose
everything so thank you Alex I'm going
to send you an awesome awesome thank-you
gift package like send you as much love
as I can you're part of everything
that's right I really immensely
incredibly appreciate your honesty and
like the effort you must have to go
through like mail it back what a pain
yet
headed home early today Candis and I are
leaving tonight and the baby we're all
leaving tonight
so assisted media at home before looks
like quite frankly still isn't enough
time I don't know how we're gonna we'll
figure it out I don't know who's less
responsible with timing stuff New York
and probably me we're both pretty bad
dude nice to meet you take care of run I
have your spoiler for instance I think
we got this everything cool
okay so this is a six minute ride then
we're at the airport between security
checking in I dropped my phones thank
you
hey you and everything so you to Delta
also method
what do they do thing if there's any
other options
remember when I said who's worse at
planning me or Candice I am we're at the
wrong Airport and there's only one
flight out of New York City today and it
leaves in 20 minutes 30 minutes no I was
just saying that earlier I was saying I
don't know who's worse that planning you
or me but it's definitely me yeah so
we're kind of screwed we can't do
anything we do go home we're gonna go to
the other Airport now we're back in the
car missed our flight we missed the
other flight went to try and get a
different flight from a different
Airport you know you guys always give me
a hard time say I always pretend that
I'm rushing and I pretend I'm gonna miss
the flight
sometimes we actually doing you dumb
computer answering stupid mother Jeanne
agent Seitz you have coming up for three
people to adult you one in just to
reiterate exactly what's going on here
we went to the wrong
we flew to the wrong Airport our flight
was out of it it's not funny
don't lash episode like this is why
I met you this has been my leg it's also
exciting but it's also like but it's not
it's entirely my fault but we went to
the wrong airport so there are no
flights out of this Airport so now we're
going to the other airport where we see
there are a couple of flights we don't
have any tickets because it's like too
soon
so we're just going to go to the airport
show up there and just get on whatever a
flight that I have that'll get us there
or we'll go somewhere different
the choices are this figure out how to
go tonight we go in the morning or we
don't go at all what do you think
Francine come here I thought it might
think for the one for one second that
she could fall asleep on our side say do
it I'm going to get there at 11:30 which
is 12:30 our time you just you just
throw it in the towel you know I'm just
folding the towel so we can open it up
again tomorrow morning but you
definitely wanna go tomorrow all right
it's a long weekend in New York City if
we don't go I could still make it to my
dinner with my friends
you and your ulterior motives I've
definitely not all right let's go
I'm coming Francine this was nothing
more I'm going to sing a helicopter ride
the airport and then taking a ride home
which is fun
one time I was responsible for getting
five people on an international flight
to Italy and I was driving and we all
missed the flight
the backward is waiting for taxi now
you're not mad at me are you this is
kind of fun right yeah was like a funnel
just like a family trip the airport you
got I think you're supposed to be back
there lady
the baby's asleep Candace is out with
her friend Marcy having dinner
everything's cool you know the only
thing about tonight that was a failure
is that we didn't make our flight it was
a great night we have to ride in a
helicopter spending time together as a
family have popcorn we are going to
leave but tomorrow morning I think I
just wore since winter
I put my backpack in a garbage bag
