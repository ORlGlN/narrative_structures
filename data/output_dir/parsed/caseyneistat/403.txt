is the keyboard I have to have so this
is the keyboard I've got a clean desktop
is imperative here which means no cables
can pollute the surface
see how much cleaner that is no cable
goes right who's right through the desk
no cables now I gotta do the same for
the mouse
nice that is clean no wires just look it
just it's it's all I've ever wanted in a
desk in a studio of total chaos this
desk is order look at these clean lines
look dark with all the screens up here a
nice white desk and then clean beneath
it just realize that neglected to
install my USB hub
alright gotta clean up the wiring but
that feels good I love finishing stuff
