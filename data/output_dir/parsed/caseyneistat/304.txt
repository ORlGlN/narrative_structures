it

it worked out perfectly
7:45 now going for my run we got a
situation
ghost boat right here no one's in it
stuck in the corner just smash it up
against the walls these guys here coming
in to the rescue or with a boat they got
their ropes ready good luck guys I'm on
the Upper West Side about 7500 and 2010
maybe a hundred blocks from my apartment
turn around go back I found my dress
hoops up buddy see later see you later
okay
solid run eleven miles at a 741 pace a
lot of people were asking me what that
means that means I ran 11 miles and each
of the eleven miles took me seven
minutes and 41 seconds each to run a
mile equals 1.6 kilometers that's like
running 17.6 kilometers and 46 second
per kilometer pace okay hope that clears
things up now cup half empty says it's a
gloomy chilly day here in New York cup
