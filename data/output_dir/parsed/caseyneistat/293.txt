things two days until VidCon we are
having a huge party on Thursday night

fun the 360 project I don't know if I've
explained it well enough but it's
essentially like no one knows what to do
with 360 video like I mean I've done
some fun stuff for that other creators
have done interesting things with it but
it hasn't been defined so what we do is
we pick 10 youtubers like wildly
different youtubers from across the
spectrum we gave them these things when
they make a video on whatever you want
we're going to like a presentation and
everyone's going to talk about the video
they made and then we're all going to
screen them on VR goggles it's going to
be amazing this is one of my favorite
presents that anyone has ever sent me on
