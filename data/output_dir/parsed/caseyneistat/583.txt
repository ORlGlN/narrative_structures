welcome to this week's Q&A Jeebs asks
how do you define work where does the
concept of work begin and end for you
how I personally feel about work is when
I discovered something I love doing I
decided then in there to do that for the
rest of my life
and figure out how to make a living at
that and figure out how to survive off
of that and for me that's that's making
movies making videos sharing ideas and
that's what beam is and that's what
these videos are do you like reptiles no
kind of a what no why do you only bleep
out your cuss words you know I didn't
used to and if you look at my old movies
I swear like a sailor some mom emailed
me and she said my kid loves watching
your videos but I won't let him because
you swear and I don't know that
profanities make this vlog better so I
just take out when I swear and if other
people want to swear that's sort of fine
there's not much thought to it honestly
how did you meet jack in neat is spelt
me-80 you know I just Jack started
working with me like five
years ago I think he started as an
intern and is just like kind of them
working with me ever since Jack now runs
community for beam along with myriad
other responsibilities but you know he
is like he's an essential part of the
team and a friend what made you want to
be a youtuber I love that YouTube is
something that we can all do and when I
worked in television I didn't feel like
it was something we could all do it was
something for the privileged few that's
what I love about YouTube I love being
part of something that was big and
egalitarian and accessible to all and a
venue where I could share my ideas and
perspectives uninhibited that's what
turned me on the most about YouTube how
tall am i somewhere between like 5 foot
10 and 6 foot 4 closer to 5 foot 10
right at 5 foot 10 I'm 5 foot 10 Breana
