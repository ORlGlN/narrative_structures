took Francine out for Chinese she is not
abused you want some chow mein 740 in
the am heading into the office early
today there's a problem at the new
company it's like the technical thing
it's not interesting it's not critical
and I'm going in early to address it
what's up guys morning Casey nice dad
carefully
ah come in join me yeah
ladies and gentlemen this is Sarah Sarah
works with the new company she's our
head of business operations it's true
have you ever been on camera before not
intentionally why don't you pick the
questions to ask me for today's Q&A this
is a special edition Q&A featuring Sarah
all right okay here we go
pick good questions all right let's ah
smart questions all right Casey what is
your favorite quote okay it's in the
foreword to a book called Hertzog on
Hertzog and the quote is something like
don't quote me on this it's something
like never have a plan B people with a
plan B will invariably fall back on it
that's why they have it in the first
place it's good right yeah let me know
let me know in the comments below doing
like these tandem cuties are good or if
they're boring I mean no no offense to
Sarah where do you see yourself in 10
years time Kippy
honestly I never look more than like
maybe a year and a half in the future
are you looking forward to VidCon Casey
VidCon I'm gonna be at VidCon this year
I have no idea what to expect
yes I'm looking forward to it yeah come
say hi at VidCon yeah come say hi well
be there you're gonna come sure why not
I'll take a hoverboard ah how do you
find being a YouTube filmmaker different
than being a real filmmaker real filming
that's that's a good question the
question is what's the difference
between being what is known as like a
traditional filmmaker
and being a youtuber and that is when
you make regular films you are beholden
to external forces to get that scene or
distributed what that means is like I'm
a traditional filmmaker I make my indie
film or my Hollywood film and then there
are studios there are people there are
agents there are all these avenues
standing between me and the audience and
when you're a youtuber you make the
decision when the work is done and then
you just upload and you share it to your
audience and that's a really big deal
and that's why I think YouTube and
distributing on the Internet is a way
that you're deal and show you a movie in
a movie theater
there's no nepotism here people watch
your stuff online because they like it
what will you do if your new company
isn't as successful as you want it to be
well you don't need a new job I will be
out of a job so we'll be problem
together if the new company isn't as
successful as I hope is as I imagine it
will be if the new company fails I will
immediately start over and start another
company that's what you think because
that's what you do how is your style
evolved over the years let me add to
that do you do you try and evolve your
style of videos do you think it's
important I think it's important to get
better
so there are filmmakers that literally
just keep doing the same thing over and
over and over but they get better every
time Wes Anderson he does the same thing
over and over and over but each film is
such an evolution of the prior film
because change is easy but getting
better is is really hard
do you regret any of your talk to
do you get bored no and the reason why I
don't get bored is because there's
always a list whether it's like in my
head are literally on paper I'm sure
you're the same way things that need to
be done so anytime there's like free
time that would be occupied by boredom
you just have their stuff to do there's
work to do
do you ever get bored I do but it's my
own fault
if I'm bored I gotta change it up yeah
yeah it's time to change okay Emily you
know this is you not doing your job
oh excuse me from Emily Volpert thank
you for writing an m' label print how
will you be marketing your new company
this vlog for starters this vlog is
where i'm going to talk about the new
company that was like the main reason
why i started this vlog but mainly like
through other social media and i like to
think that like the new company what
we're making is something that everybody
is going to love so we're counting on
the people that use it the people that
like it to spread it around we're not
going to be doing TV commercials we're
not going to doing like billboards or
banner ads or what other really
annoyingly marketing is there out there
yeah like like paid tweets
yeah we're I can do any tweet he'll be
notated no paid tweets alright I think
we have to stop it there when will you
tell us about the new company soon soon
yeah there's all these new company
questions will the new company be
something people will use on a daily
basis hope so hope do I pay attention to
timing while editing videos timing is
everything when editing videos ok we're
going to stop there thank you for all of
your tweets if I didn't ask you here's a
mini plug for you ok tune in next
Tuesday for more questions with Casey
and Sarah although it's probably just
gonna be Casey next week thank you for
