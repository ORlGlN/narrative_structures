see that foot outline that mark right
there sort of shaped like a foot the
reason why that there is so you know
exactly where to place your foot to find
the center of gravity to do this cool
right
it is it is just after 6:00 a.m. I got
up super early this morning to take some
time lapses of this amazing town it's so
pretty
so I'm back at MIT today super excited
about that love being in Canberra jalath
working with with the folks at the Media
Lab Owen will be up at MIT this week as
well
this is his spring break at school and
he's doing a student internship curious
when it's going to be like to work side
by side with the kid parenting it's like
an enigma wrapped up in a mystery
I really wish I spent more time at this
house needs to be here all the time it
she's gotten so tricky with the baby
do me a solid if you should ever find
yourself in New London Connecticut come
to muddy waters cafe go in look to the

for it
three of my favorite people in the whole
world just chilling out working here hey
Owen how's work
hey that how much of this cake did you
eat Owen zero zero and I just realized I
forgot to put money in the meter right
there's the meter maid
stupid ticket
in the lab that's my iPhone there and I
want to use the window as like a tripod
for it I mean it's kind of like the
perfect tripod but if it falls that's
pretty severe so far so good so I should
start by saying ivory recorded this
scene like three times and I seldom do
that with these vlogs what you see is
what actually happened and you should
trust that but I said I would mention or
I would talk about my new business in
today's vlog and I'm super anxious about
it see I feel almost dishonest and not
having shared the details of my new
company on the vlog yet this vlog is
about me it's about what I'm up to it's
about my life and this company is my
life it's my only focused career wise
it's the reason why I'm no longer doing
advertising it's how I spend the vast
majority of all of my time in the office
but there are very legitimate not that
legitimate but there are legal reasons
why I can't get into the specifics of
what I'm doing so all I can tell you is
that my new company will be a very big
part of this vlog moving forward but
there are some very specific short-term
legal hurdles that we have to overcome
before I can really share with you what
I'm up to
I hope you will bear with me continue to
watch my vlog and trust that in the
future
in the very near future I will be
sharing the details of everything that
I'm up to on this blog that's all I got
all right
where is that kid we're going to go to
the mall really quickly just do a little
father-son shopping
thank you I would have put my hair yeah
