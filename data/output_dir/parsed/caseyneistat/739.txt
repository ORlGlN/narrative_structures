machine that pumps out Jamba Juice and
this machine pumps out free chili
that's everything
alright this this is a theory of mine
but I genuinely believe this I think you
can supplement sleep with exercise what
I literally mean by that is say you
sleep eight hours a night if you took
two of those hours and spent them
exercising and only slept six hours you
would be less tired and in general feel
better it is just a theory though
Candice is preoccupied today so I think
I'm going to go for an afternoon run
someone commented that the running part
of my vlog is getting boring so in honor
of that comment and whoever wrote it
today's vlog will be dedicated in its
entirety to running Sunday morning long
run I'm gonna check in every couple
miles
what
let's talk about running all right first
big picture this is what matters and the
body is just there to like keep this
thing running the brain big picture this
is the Westside Highway
this is where I run almost every day
it's lovely here river on that side city
on that side this is the one-mile
check-in and I feel great I have not
always been a runner
I ran cross-country in middle school
when I was like 11 I didn't really start
running until I was 26 27 28 28 what
years
so on the Westside Highway
now I'm in Midtown so I'm halfway up the
island where I was before
this is mile number six and I feel great
I didn't start running till I was 28
because when I was 26 I was told I'd
never be able to run again here's what
happened
I do this okay so I borrowed Candace's
scooter and I was driving down the
street and this dude ran a red light and
straight up just cremated the scooter
and my leg I was in the hospital for
about a week I was in surgery for like
12 hours this is my busted-up leg as
soon as I got to the hospital they did
drill through my leg with a drill to
quickly put pressure on it put it in
traction to slow the bleeding so when I
was in the hospital right before they
were going to release me I asked the
doctor how long till I'm 100% how long
till I run and I'll never forget he said
to me you'll be able to chase after your
kids and you'll be able to chase after a
taxicab down the street but you'll never
be able to run again I cannot tell you
how much that freaked me out I was 26
years old and being told that I would
never run again
it was devastated absolutely devastating
okay that's still the Westside Highway
on the other end of this tunnel
now I'm uptown I'm coming into the
island here this is the 8-mile check-in
and I feel great
okay I found the footage all right so
this is two years after I go to the
hospital
this was well here just finished my
first marathon
like those are my feet this is gross
you get the point
so my first marathon was an unmitigated
disaster I really like got beat up I sat
down I was walking my time was abhorrent
I hate doing something and not being
great at it
okay this is the Upper West Side that
Central Park I just ran across the Upper
West Side I'm now entering Central Park
mile nine check in I feel great
four months later I ran my second
marathon and I really got I really got
it together okay this is the
southernmost point in Central Park
that's 59th Street this is check-in
number like 10 and change and I feel
great
somewhere I decided that running wasn't
enough and I started to really get into
triathlons here's my favorite picture of
myself running a triathlon just look at
that intensity
easternmost side of Central Park
that's Fifth Avenue there mile 12 and I
feel great
since being told by that doctor that I'd
never be able to run again
I've run 22 marathons at competed in
four Ironman triathlons probably a
hundred other triathlons and other road
races and I never looked back okay this
is the northernmost tip of Central Park
that is Harlem Chucky and mile 13 still
feel great I made a movie a while ago
for for Nike about running you should
check that out I'll link it there
okay now back on the Westside Highway
mile 16 and I feel great
I always prioritize running I would
definitely love another two hours of
sleep I'd love to get into work a couple
hours earlier but I make it a priority
this is mile 19 and I honestly I wish I
had had a little bit to eat this morning
reading just a sip of water before I
left the house I feel like an auntie
saying that so I take it back mile 19 I
feel great
after you run for a certain amount of
time you like completely forget about
your body it's in cruise control a lot
of the ideas for my work and my plans
for movies all of those were birthed as
I was running that was 21 miles at a 754
pace but you know I ran further it's
just a my tracking app crashed on me
like three times I use the Nike+ running
app and I do not recommend it it's a
terrible app that fails on you
critically when you need it the most
anyways mile 21 still feel great control
with burning
3000 calories first thing in the morning
is it's really hard to replace those
calories
