I never shoe this
it's currently for 14 in the afternoon
today's New Year's Day it's a holiday I
haven't left the house once today
Francine and Candace are gone I've just
been sitting here the entire day trying
to finish my 2015 year-end roundup video
which I'm so proud of okay I'm gonna
take a shower and try to go find the
family
this is the first time this winter I'm
going to have to wear tights
apparently it's freezing outside
no your homage just about to meet you
well that's the most disappointing thing
in my entire life just as I get ready to
go Candace comes home baby goes down for
a nap
running uninteresting errands now I need
to get packing tape from the store and
try to go to the grocery store need to
run by the office
thank you very much
now this place open
why are you guys open to that company
one to stupid
I almost feel guilty when I solicit
stores that make their employees work on
holidays
almost but I still shop here
that sell-by date is one year ago
so long down boy
thank you grocery mission is complete we
run to the office quickly oh man this
place is trashed how much you're pretty
late last night shooting that
end-of-the-year video and that's why
it's such a mess in here I didn't want
to clean two quick things while I'm in
here
number one is more pragmatic and that is
the giveaway I am giving away this drone
this camera kit in this brand new
boosted board there she is
I made the giveaway video for that
before Christmas it's right here if you
haven't seen it yet and those are really
expensive things to give away so I'm not
going to do this again soon so I have to
do it right that's why it's taking so
long
that's it I will be announcing the
winners this week maybe in two days
something like that if you haven't
entered yet again watch this video here
you just comment in this video not in
this video
next I just wanted to get like a little
bit introspective I spent the last like
16 hours something like that editing
yesterday's video which was like my 2015
year in review and I've never before sat
down and examined an entire year of my
life before I got like a little
nostalgic like a little sad the thing
about the past is that you never ever
get to experience it again as I'm
sifting through all of that footage as
I'm sifting through literally a year of
my life that's all on video I was just
thinking like how the did I get
here the time my life I identify with
most is right here that's me that's Owen
that's the trailer that we lived in in a
trailer park in Connecticut I catch
myself getting frustrated or angry or
pissed off I just like take a deep
breath look around and be like I have
nothing to be upset about nothing
appreciating what you have is the first
principle of happiness okay today's the
first day of 2016 and I spent it sitting
at home in my underwear and then in my
office by myself so I'm going to go home
now and be with the family
these mittens here I made for the
stroller but not only to my hands in
them
