all right yeah that was those 2014 three
years ago so yesterday was lizard Stella
the storm of like the last time we've
gotten 21 inches of snow and March was
back in 1888 20 inches of snow was the
fall on New York City New York City
could see between one and two at least a
foot of snow one to two feet was the
blizzard never came I did start to shoot
a video but I never finished it because
the storm never came but I wanted to
make a video about this non storm anyway
so here is my failed Blizzard movie
in kz6 p.m. March 13 2017 we're supposed
to be hit with a horrible winter storm
called winter storm Stella in about six
hours I'll check in again in six hours
no here here it's not midnight yet it is
um
9:30 no snow yet thoughts on the weather
Candice oh it's freezing out next second
we'll be in exactly two hours okay
2:30 in the morning it's snowing outside
this is a stupid idea I'm gonna go back
to bed next chicken will be in the
morning it seems like it rained or like
frozen rained all night there's not that
much snow it's also not that cold out
noon o'clock I'm with Max we're in the
West Village I think better flurries at
McDonald's nice backside 3:00 p.m. what
we're on the wet side Iowa it's still
like fleeting and icing but there's no
snow this video is going to sucker I
want to make our just know so I hope you
can see like what were the sort of the
foundational elements of what could have
been a great movie like I check in every
couple of hours there's more snow more
snow more snow until we have those like
two feet of snow the city shut down and
like
oh I want to share that with you
and I also wanted to give a little bit
of a history lesson on both this movie
and this snowboard video from last year
2016 okay
I know these videos look like I just
grabbed my snowboard in my truck and my
friend we were out like the truth is I
had been preparing for this video and
the one I'd literally been preparing
since 2001 see in the winter of 2001
2002 there was a really bad snowstorm
that hit in New York City and at the
time my boss had like a huge pickup
truck and he and I've snowboarded up and
ever since then I was like that would be
an incredible movie to make in New York
City so it took me like eight ten years
to to buy a jeep that was snow ready
once the deep make short work with this
snow bank and then having snowboards in
New York City that was ready then having
the perfect storm and this is what
transpired okay
so that's why I'm making this video I
want to ask you what should my next
Blizzard movie be because I need to
start preparing for it now even if it's
a year or two away I really don't think
it should I really don't think it should
be me or my friends snowboarding or
skiing behind cars or drones like I've
done that was it's all jumpy but I do
mean this if we can come up with the
right idea I will make it no matter what
it takes I'm just kind of like
I'll chop that down that's the hole
around
you
