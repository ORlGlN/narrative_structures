this is the second vlog of post today
this morning's law was from the day
before yesterday this vlog was from
yesterday I've been behind since Cuba
which was three days ago but tomorrow's
vlog will be from today I hope that
clears things up sixteen miles at a 725
pace great great run thanks Candace
Sunday brunch with the family except on
no one will be here later today I don't
know what time he gets back
Owens flying back to the city today yeah
let's go go
today is what you call a lazy Sunday see
the past two days were pretty chaotic
with all the travel and the birthday
parties and the non-stop nests so today
taking it easy
I left Candace and Francine at the play
place I have to run to the office to
grab my boosted board I'm gonna go meet
my brother Dean and my brother van and
see Ma'at I need the booster board to
get there while in here there's one
quick through sabor de nada fication
that I need to make this is the charger
for the boosted board which you need to
travel with so you can always keep this
thing fully charged and this plug which
connects to the part that goes into the
wall goes into the charger like this but
it always comes undone which is
completely unnecessary so I'm going to
make it so these two never separate ever
again I'm just gonna put some glue in
the hole then cram in the plug and hope
that holds whoa
coat this in hot glue cram this in the
hole and then hope that holds and hope
that the charger still works should be
fine
let me just make sure it works before I
leave the office another successful
modification and this is our destination
looks fancy not barely brothers
where they are they are
this is like a hardcore real-deal
old-school New York City Jewish bakery
man what do you get here Dean that black
and white not my friend where's the
black and white for you oh they're still
on the cookie sheet primarily I gave up
sugar no you I gave up sugar I don't
need sugar anymore did you just have it
one more time what should I keep telling
myself but no I like my preacher it's
really bad okay thank you so much taller
than I am
bye guys see you later
it's good to see the family I don't see
the extended family enough especially
considering both van and Dean live in
New York City then Dean are my brothers
yes high five yeah oh what a cutie
man I can't even train my dog to poop
outside clever pooch all right good to
see you take care
when your day starts at 7:00 a.m. with a
16 mile run you really don't want to
spend the rest of the day on your feet
for shopping now
are you tired yeah daddy's tired too
let's go
look I said at the beginning of today's
vlog that today was like a relaxing lazy
Sunday today is the non-stop chaos the
entire day do you like this restaurant I
don't like this restaurant yeah we need
it
I don't know why mom likes this
restaurant
