best way to make cookies is from scratch

scratch before and I should really scrub
harder in the shower so I'm freaking
excited to do this
let's get Hey
okay so let's read this recipe huh wait
a second why is this burnt out candle
sitting here so let's see what this
recipe calls for hello flour sugar eggs
baking soda butter salt chocolate chips
that way call for a interesting
reference okay so I have butter it's
buttery I have milk chocolate chips and
I have my salt and sugar whoa finally
take this jacket off that's literally
the only reason why I wore this anyways
I also have my whale but most
importantly I have my flower yeah you
may think I'm predictable for that one
but did you see this coming
you can expect that did you yeah some
people call me random yep that's me but
now that we got our ingredients nuts
yeah okay so here are the baking
instructions right here dude who keeps
blowing out these candles okay so step
one mix all of the ingredients in a bowl
okay I have a bowl you have two cups of
flour check we got 1 cup of butter check
we got 3/4 cup of drugs the sugar don't
do drugs check now I couldn't think of
other checks so check out our other
ingredients uh-huh
teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of vanilla
extract now it calls for two cups of
chocolate chips but you can never have
enough am i right don't judge me and
don't forget your two eggs which I can
actually crack with one hand okay
clearly we know I don't excel at that Oh
oh that was so forced yeah it was just a
little too extra oh god I need to exit I
crack myself up but okay I think I got
everything
wait a second ding how did I miss baking
soda do I really need that though you
got an idea
yeah I knew I had soda this will do
I think this will work hopefully it just
doesn't explode explosion of fact what
I'm not that good at editing cool now we
just mix it together like my mom and dad
mixed white chocolate and dark chocolate
and made me milk chocolate okay
this took forever to star together and
it got everywhere okay now we have our
cookie dough which my mom always told me
not to eat or I would get sick but guess
what mom I ain't here right now it's
just me Liza but you can call me big
papa doh no now let's get on to the next
step we start rolling our dough into
balls
now here's me acknowledging that this is
gonna take a long time it's gonna be
really uninteresting to watch so I'm
gonna fast-forward it all and play some
really cute baking music over it

preheat the oven to 425
would I say hot nice pun in the oven

burn cookies mmm maybe a little dark on
the outside but it sure is sweet on the
inside am I talking about myself
