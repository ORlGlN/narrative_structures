Oh who's that
if I heard to hide a bouncer
you can have that'll be on Oh what's up
adieu me gang I hope you're having an
amazing day because I'm having an
amazing day so if I'm having an amazing
day you all should be having an amazing
happy day today is officially aid for me
what do my Ganga state's for me and I'm
so so happy but the only thing is I woke
up really really sad I woke up thinking
that I'm gonna see my whole family and
that I'm gonna see Reema Home Office's
say yes and everyone but I woke up and
no one is that my house actually I'm
really really happy because I'm
stress-free and I don't have to babysit
any kids but not seriously I woke up and
my whole family is that my other
family's house and there's a bunch of
ladies there so I am NOT I repeat I am
NOT going over there so I'm pretty much
stuck alone by myself during AIDS it's
all good we still turn it up because
slim called me and he told me that he's
alone also and that his family left him
and went over there family's house so me
and slim we're stuck home alone during
the by the way I've been looking at your
tweets and all you guys are looking
fresh
swagged out your 8 outfits or on point I
need to talk to you guys real quick
about something really really important
so as you guys know yesterday's vlog I
put up the vlog where Jason pretty much
threatened me and I showed his voice
messages and in the video I kept after
you guys should I go see him should I go
see him because I still have that little
urge in my head and my heart to go see
him like 90% of you guys were telling me
to not go see him because he's dangerous
and I completely understand like I
completely completely understand but I
feel like if I don't go and see him it's
gonna end up being worse because New
York City is my home and I'm always
walking around the streets of New York
so what if he does bring people on me
and they try to do something really
violent against me so I feel like if I
don't go and see him and try to at least
resolve the issue in person he's going
to try to bring people on me and then
it's going to end up being back and
forth and it's going to get crazy and I
know a lot of you guys told me to go to
the police show the police the voice
messages but
feel like doing that is just gonna make
you even worse so I came up with a
decision my decision to go to him and
confront him face to face I really hope
you guys understand where I'm coming
from I know I'm putting my life at risk
jason has been calling me non-stop I
haven't picked up his calls because I
was reading your tweets and I was trying
to decide what should I do and I finally
came to a decision and I'm sorry if this
puts you in a really scary or nervous
kind of mood but I promise you guys I
know how to keep myself safe and
inshallah he understands and everything
will stay safe I am NOT going alone I'm
going with a lot of you guys are telling
me if I go I should bring like security
or all my people or my homies and stuff
but I'm not gonna do that I'm just gonna
go with me and split because whenever I
walk around my city I'm my own security
guard New York City is my city so when
Charlotte everything goes well it is
easy I just want to have positive vibes
with you guys so I'm gonna call them
back right now I'm going to tell him
that I want to see him and we're gonna
see how it goes at doom again we take
you guys with me
bismillah let's do it do me I'm feeling
good even though I still know that I'm
kind of putting my life at risk a little
bit but I'm still thinking really really
positive so I'm going to call him and
we're going to see what goes on

because I want you guys to hear
everything that goes on because there's
