hey guys I'm Shane we are true story a
essay and today we're gonna continue on
with a depression topic we have a
storage from you guys you guys sense us
we had a lot but shake chose one and
yeah we're not gonna say the person's
name because this person does not want
us to say their name but hopefully
although we can help you out with this
issue and hopefully Shelley everyone can
help each other out because we love
seeing people helping each other and we
love helping people out just to clarify
in our last video we meet on my
depression we weren't actually meeting
the disorder we were talking about how
people are sometimes depressed and sad
we talk about that kind of depression
not the depression where people are like
it's a sickness really not that kind
depression so I just need to clarify
that I read this before it is very hard
touching and yeah yeah he didn't hear
you so much did you hear me now
there he goes I always used to be a
happy child and very energetic but when
I got older I understood life more and
my life has been such a roller coaster
it's unbelievable anyways - when I was
growing up I had to move between
Birmingham Manchester and Bristol a lot
and because of that I never had any
friends and the friends that did have
would always be like oh haha
look you're a gypsy you can't even live
in one place and you're so fat does all
the money your parents have going to
food you eat and I got so bad that one
point I should come myself and that's
the only way I could get out of my anger
and I thought that I was not gonna
survive I thought the best way out was
suicide or to overdose but as years went
by I finally moved to Manchester and I
met new people and I realised that there
are many loving people out there but
people try so hard to find them and I
have never told anyone about me cutting
or trying to anyway sorry for wasting
your time I just thought I'd tell you my
story I love you and and then I forget
to mention that soon is started watching
your videos I was such a happy girl I
was such a happy girl out there and it
put the biggest smile on my face
mashallah and so until this day I'm a
survivor thanks to you tomorrow I don't
know man it's just really sad to hear
and you have a I have a pretty similar
story too about say mines
like that but for you I guess it's more
like a small I get people hating on you
or some like that or people being racist
or stuff that calling you gypsy whatever
I guess the best thing is just ignore
and that's really hard even with us like
when we get eight whatever we just feel
like who's saying that you want to come
at them back whatever but the best thing
is just to ignore them and never you
know never reply or never pay attention
to whatever think about it focus on the
good stuff people need to think that and
remember that focus on all the
positivity be near people who were
always positive never be near those
people don't stay away from them that's
what you got to do stay away from them
because I don't know I never even told
this I don't know if I should say this
in a video because it's like I never
told anybody about this I never told
even my parents I never even told
anybody I don't think that's all shake
or anything about it but especially with
cutting yourself and stuff like that
don't do anything to harm yourself why
would you harm yourself I've been
through stuff like that I didn't call
myself but it was one time I was really
sad I was just pressed like no reason
just thinking about always thinking so
much and I was so depressed and then I
basically took one of my father's
cigarettes please forgive me my dad is
watching this please forgive me if
anyone was watching this and my family's
watching this sorry and I'm sorry I'm
like breaker but yeah mom I was really
sad and I took my dad's I took my dad's
cigarette and I lit it up I don't know I
don't know I lit it up and then I put a
burn myself and I made a smiley face on
my wrist and yeah I don't know if you
can see I don't know if you could see
about it was there about a year and a
half ago I don't know I felt like like I
was so depressed samih
I just wanted to see I want them to see
it happy I don't know what I don't wanna
sing I wanted to see a happy face myself
or something like that but even how
long's even do that but we all do stupid
stuff when we're young
and stuff like that and to be honest I
do regret doing that because I just
harmed myself which I would never want
to ever do again I would never want to
see you all or see you harm ease of
cutting yourself
I burned my eye literally primals I have
a smiley face I marvel sometimes the
pictures you guys would notice I would
take a picture like this like that I
don't have to cover up myself and stuff
like that and I don't know I didn't feel
strong enough to tell you guys gotta
feel like if I would tell you guys
you're like oh wow you're so stupid why
would you ever say that or you guys
would make me feel even worse but that's
me just thinking negative I just feel
like I should always think positive and
screw this hurting yourself and doing
something because that's just that's
just playing dumb to be honest when I
did I realized the next day my what did
I just do because I literally burned
myself I had bubbles in my arm for the
whole six seven months it was a burn
right now it's fading away a little bit
but it's still there and seeing it it
just it's just really sad and just
knowing then the people in the future in
your life when they end up seeing your
cuts or anything we did think about what
this guy's psycho but actually now just
going through something serious and
life's we're not psycho nothing like
that but I would never ever do that
again I would I wouldn't ever want you
to do that so remember I won't do it
makes you feel any better I went through
something like that I finally said it a
center for the first time but just
remember stay positive stay happy don't
don't let anybody any words those are
words they can't do shit for me the
message I give to you is as you said it
just ignore it because see when you pay
attention to it if it bothers you and
you know I'm not suicidal but I have a
story that not even Adam no one knows my
family doesn't even know it
there was a point in 10th grade I was
white how the ER in tenth grade 6 15 16
and I'm not saying right now I'm not
suicidal but the thing is during that
moment I felt like no one cared about no
one give a crap that's how I felt and
then there was a time where I tried
overdosing drugs and I took about you
don't know about see there I never told
you this but I took about 10 20 extra
pills just just to see an effect just
because I was so irritated of life
because of everything that's been going
on I was so irritated and I took all the
pills I put in my mouth I went to sleep
in a couple of hours I was in like the
worst
never humbly luck thank God I didn't die
but I was in serious pain and as soon as
I will as soon as I was feeling it I
took my mother and my dad segments and
our hospital right away and the reason I
felt like I did it was I felt like no
one cared about me I felt like you know
I was just walking this earth with no
one carrying us so that's why I took the
pills and I went to the hospital just
cuz you know when you're in the hospital
that's been everywhere that I get I
swear I'm a beach well if you do that
I'll be I'll be I'll beat you up I swear
I got no job the Devils on telegram I'm
not doing anyone so the reason I felt
that way because you know when you're in
the hospital everyone cares more about
you like you know when you die god
forbid you know all these people that
passes away people care about the more
after they die and people when they're
in the hospital that's when people start
caring about you so I feel like the only
way to get attention and the only way to
get people to care about me or at least
have a little bit care for me is if I go
to the hospital so that's exactly what I
did and I did get care but I got a
negative way I hurt my body affected me
and basically what I'm trying to say is
you know stay strong don't let words
affect you because as we all know words
can kill like reading this story the
person was about to cut herself the
person was about to die because of what
other people told him you know so watch
your words and be smug what you say
because your words can be the reason of
someone else to death these are
basically mistakes that we've done and
we don't want you guys to it because we
did these stupid mistakes we regretted
it is just it's plain that we'll ever if
you guys ever think about hurting
yourself or harming stuff please do not
ever think about that there's just plain
stupid don't ever do that don't make the
same mistake we did don't ever harm
yourself please if you guys are watching
please don't ever do that it won't get
anything anywhere just be he just
hurting stuff for no reason
what would your mom think your mom will
go through so much if she's knows you're
hurting yourself let's say you have a
kid and you know and your kid is harming
self wouldn't you feel like crap like oh
my god your kid is already hurting
yourself you don't wanna you don't wanna
see anyone go through pain of some like
I so remember don't let anyone put you
do depression and stuff like that be
happy you know say Samara do whatever
