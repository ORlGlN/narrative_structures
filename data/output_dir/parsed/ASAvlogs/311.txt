just gone making commotions I don't know
what I'm doing hi Nanak okay doing again
so I just put mustn't sleep
rimas knocked out because of the whole
long flight we had a super long flight I
wanted to vlog you know a flight our
experience with Rima me my dad there my
mom and everyone but this is what
happened this is why I couldn't vlog
like this new rule that Donald Trump the
worst president ever came up with anyone
that's going to the Middle East you can
bring whatever you want but if you're
going back from the Middle East to the
USA anyone they have to take away all
your electronics they took away my
laptop
Slim's laptop rimas iPad all my cameras
Slim's Nintendo switch they take it like
this myself they take it they wrap it up
in bubble wrap but just once they wrap
it up them over up they put it in a box
and they take it to baggage claim and it
took so long to do this because they put
bubble wrap
then they tape it around and they take
the camera and it's scary because your
laptop can break your camera can break
your camera can get dusty and it'll mess
up and it was such a waste of time it
made the flight delay like two hours and
everyone is complaining I was asking why
and everyone was saying that this is the
new American government rule that Donald
Trump made it so that whoever goes to
the Middle East and comes back to the
USA they need to put their electronics
in like a box just it's a waste of time
literally a waste of time so I could
have lied Remo couldn't use the iPad to
use the iPad all the time I couldn't use
my laptop literally it was so boring
if you're asleep I leave to come play
with the bubble game also I gots
magazine from the quay times I'm on the
front page newspaper of the quake times
which is literally and saying thank you
so much great for showing so much love
I'm going to put this up on my wall in
the new house that we're getting real
rose
by the way we're getting out real real
so but we're going to do something right
now Yusuf has no clue
so I'm have to blindfold him and then
we're gonna see what's up that have to
do this okay last time you said that you
come here sick
I'm not because you have problems is
this something that's been bothering me
and at door okay nothing so my mom's a
job can I combine hold you to this can I

number what if you get either death or -

do Yusuf does not drink soda like that
but it's not good so I'm sorry you can
have to drink some soda for this little
mini challenge that I'm doing right now

cup okay try it and just guess what it
is oh oh cool what is it

decline and drink and just guess what it
is I don't wanna see it up until the end
okay spray it okay okay
okay drink it
this is the third one be careful holder
Club this is the third one last one
Mikey sniffing it there's nothing in
that I drink it got a spot okay
the same is the same one similar thought
first one coke I take away the blindfold
Coke and Pepsi tastes the same thing let
me look this was Pepsi and this was
coca-cola sprite was the only ones
different when he tasted both of them he
thought they were the same thing
literally he thought they were the same
exact that's coke Cola and this is
toughy tasty you can taste the
difference I'm trying out with you was
it take the same thing what did I say
I'm sorry that I had to take this
situation even further but some people
were even tweeting me saying no it's not
they taste a little different but a lot
of you guys treated me saying they're
pretty much they're pretty much the same
thing like if anyone wants coke and if
they don't have Coke you just be like
let me get testy but the other day DJ
it's not as Slim was telling me like no
they're totally different this so
different man
you don't understand how different
they're making it seem like like this
one is like some necks like there's no
difference but don't ever argue with me
because I took law I took 1 year of law
and criminal justice so I know about law

wanted to make that point clear but yeah
