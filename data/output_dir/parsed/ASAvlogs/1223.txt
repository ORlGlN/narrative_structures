hey guys I'm Hannah and I'm Shane and
this is true story ASC news the news
channel that shows what the media
doesn't so today we're going to be
talking about a topic that has not
gotten much attention in the media a 31
year old Muslim woman was stabbed 16
times to death because she was wearing a
hijab and an ab diet she was walking to
her University in the UK and she was
stopped by a random stranger and stabbed
16 times this is just unbelievable like
why shouldn't this be all over the media
this is something really serious you
know
16 times stabbed in the back in the head
arms this is a hate crime it should be
everywhere you know one sad how some
people don't value every soul the same
so right now we're off set of filming
the movie on married Nigeria and we're
at a police station right now we're
gonna ask people even police people off
the film crew if they heard about this
gruesome hate crime so let's see how
this goes so have you heard about that
woman that was stabbed 16 times /
because their religious dress code
no never everybody never did hear about
one yesterday soccer game yeah one good
have you heard about the Muslim woman
who got stabbed 16 times to death
because she's wearing a hijab in the UK
no no have you heard in the news I
didn't have you heard about Spain
leaving in the World Cup yeah you did I
did it I just want to ask you do you
know about that woman who got stabbed 16
times because of what she was wearing in
the UK no you hear about that do you
know about Kim Kardashian did she she
got married fortunately yes have you
heard about the Muslim woman who got
stabbed to death in the UK because she
was wearing a hijab no have you heard
about Brazil winning game in the World
Cup yes yes so have you heard about that
girl that was stabbed 16 times because
of her religious dress no never
do you hear vacuum guys and getting
married ha ha tierno out that yeah have
you heard about the Muslim woman who got
stabbed to death because she was wearing
a job in UK I have not no read about
Miley Cyrus torture yes yes
his a woman in the UK she was wearing
that she wore her job and somebody
stabbed 16 times to death and the media
hasn't showed any of that or anything
you want to bring it out there and give
awareness and show people that why why
isn't that in the in the media this is
girl right she was going to school and
she got stabbed 16 times because of her
hope what she was wearing and you know
it's sad event with girls got stabbed
for no reason like and don't need is my
shoulder right right here in show it it
gets not entertaining the only media we
have as young youth is beautiful
so what we try to do is you're trying to
record all this put on you can show the
world use this as a media to to show
everyone about where we have it so I
feel something
neither do i this issue hasn't had any
attention in the media so we're trying
to bring it out and raise awareness that
of this hate crime it's not just like a
crime or any normal things a hate crime
and when I see I see it as a terrorist
attack with what he did to that woman
because I know damn sure if a Muslim man
almost a woman did anything to somebody
and stab somebody 16 times to death they
would consider them a terrorist so the
fact of the matter is the media only
show you what they want to show you
whether Kim Kardashian makes the news or
whether Brazil winning the World Cup is
a Muslim soul important enough to be
shown on everyday news I don't know
because what happens when 5,000 people
die in Syria for a week why is it
national the media portrays us as
terrorists when they're not they claim
that in our Koran it says we have to
kill people when it doesn't what we need
to try and do is help educate the masses
around the world that Muslims do exist
we're not terrorists we're not murderers
we have to help them understand that
that's what this land that's not what
we're about
what we're about is family respect
religion peace and
that's what Chinese we're trying to
raise awareness and spread the word to
everywhere so media doesn't show it we
show it
you
