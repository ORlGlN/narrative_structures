way who are you
how do you away Oh spring
Joey spin you faster I'm gonna I have
some really really really bad news um
the footage that we record today has all
been gone
unfortunately the stuff that was all
recorded are all gone now so I can't let
you guys have another day with no vlog
so I'm gonna do a quick rant usually my
rants are about like public opinions are
about like the outside world today I'm
gonna be ranting about myself so what
I'm going to be talking about is
something that's been bothering me for
the past few years now and it's like a
huge problem in my life
it's acne I've been having acne since
ninth grade and right now we're at I
mean I'm at third year of college so
that's about about seven eight years and
since then a lot of stuff changed like
as soon as I started having that acting
development or the acne years a lot of
stuff has changed
I know it's love stuff my acne honestly
became worse because of the way I
treated it like for the first few years
from ninth grade to like 12 grade it
wasn't really bad it was acne here and
there and then I used to like touch them
I said like pop in my used to I
shouldn't I used to scratch them or I
used to like oh I need to take care of
him
but after after I didn't take care
became worse and then I notice Li and
then after that I started taking care of
her a lot but I don't know you're just
not working out cuz cuz every time I do
try to take enemy comes a lot more and
till today
my face is clearing out hum delay it is
actually really clearing out but I still
got here and there and people they start
looking at you different they start they
start like they start having this
something inside them that says no come
go talk to he has acne or no like
someone is like bigger something they
were like oh no go talk to he's kind of
big like you know it just bothered me
how people focus on this but not you
know your personality or your heart
sometime when I go to the cops for the
videos there's like some comments that
will say oh she Shay got so much so much
acting on his face he should clear that
out or shake has this or oh my god does
that look so bad yeah I know how bad it
looks alright like I I understand and I
do my best I go to dermatology I do
everything I do our procedures to get it
cleared out the doctor says should be
cleared out by age 22 and I'm 20 right
now so about two years they should be
cleared out before then but you know
it's it's not something in control it's
not like I tell I tell like my facial
acne grow or something like a lot of
people they look at you different like I
had this one time where at tenth grade I
tried getting a job and I went in and
before they even asked me a question
didn't ask for no questions they didn't
ask me anything didn't even let me talk
they said listen I love to ask questions
regarding this job an interview but but
we have a set requirement of looks for
this job and unfortunately you don't fit
that requirement two years they would
repeat people they would be looking
different at me
like everyone in my class in my high
school class everyone had clear skin
except like probably one little person
and then there was me I had a horrible
skin texture I had
like I had Harbor Paulo's and I tried
like I tried fitting in with everyone
I tried sitting with the more I tried
talking to them and one when they saw me
when they see me they have this look
they had this expression that I knew
that they gotta say no good idea
so I seen that expression and I noticed
the hate that they had and then they
pushed me up they still like they said
like bully me they tell me no don't say
what those go say what that will do this
like I used to be picked out a lot and
mostly because of because of my acne so
as years went by it just just opened up
to me like people don't look at you
because like people don't look at you
for your heart or who you are like even
you could be the on this person inside
but people won't care as long as you
have that beautiful face which really
bothers me because beautiful faces is
like a bonus it's like a bonus to you
who you are
the inside is what really matters
sometimes honestly I even there was a
time like in high school years where I
would cry ever like I would ask God why
why me out of all these people in the
world why did you have to choose me
- why'd you have to choose me - like
why'd you have to choose to give me I
but you know it's it's not like you know
whatever happens happens that's why I
always go by I have confidence in myself
I know he's gonna go away and I know
that hopefully each other my face it
does clear it out but you know I can't
let me I can't live my whole life being
upset so you know I just stay strong and
I just go forward I just I just do like
the vlogs and the videos I just do it
for you guys I don't focus on that no
more because I know it still bothers me
till today but I try my best not to
focus on that because if I focus on
there's gonna bring me down and it's in
a room my room my confidence and my
interest so I just want to say that
anyone that has acne or anyone that is
big or anyone that has other flaws you
shouldn't worry about you shouldn't let
that bother your life no one is perfect
every single person has a flaw and you
just have to like don't even look for
the plot just look at the inside see how
they really are if they have a good
personality they have a good heart it's
like get them closer that's it don't
look
they seem like oh here's a mole on the
right right cheek oh my god man I talked
to him oh no he had a key or no he's
kind of fat or you know this so much
flaw is updating you shouldn't focus on
that you know that's not something
you son you have to focus on what's
inside and that's what really matters
