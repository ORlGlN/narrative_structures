I am leaving to jet that in a few hours
you guys will see my journey from Mecca
all the way to jet that's my first time
exploring Jeddah staying in Jeddah for a
few days so is getting me so so amazing
I cannot wait to take you guys with me
right now I have something really
important to talk to you guys about I do
not know if you guys have even heard
about this I just heard about this today
and I seriously thought it was a joke
but this is legit this is real-life
padule-- gang so people in the UK have
been getting letters a lot of letters of
this paper right here saying punish a
Muslim day which is April 3rd yes the
dumi gang I'm not joking it says punish
a Muslim day this is a legit holiday
what the heck let me read you guys what
it says here because this is all over
the internet and I feel like the media
is saying nothing at all so I'm gonna
have to tell you guys and we're gonna
have to raise awareness on this issue
because this just causes more hate and
more violence it's crazy out people
religious getting this letter like you
can see the picture someone's holding
this paper but what it says in the paper
it says that they have hurt you they
have maybe your loved one suffered they
have caused you pain and heartache what
are you gonna do about it
are you a sheep like the vast majority
of the population sheep follow orders
and are easily left there allowing the
white majority nations of Europe and
North Americans if you come overrun by
those who would like nothing more than
to do us harm and to turn our
democracies into sharia LED police
states only you can help turn this thing
around only you have the power do not be
a sheep I'm not even joking this is what
also says you get rewarded with every
action that's taken it says this you get
ten points for verbally abusing a Muslim
you get 25 points
he pulled the headscarf which is the
handjob all we must as a woman you get
50 points to throw acid on the face of a
Muslim we have 100
if you beat up you get 250 points if you
torture Muslim using electrocution
skinning or use of rap you get 500
points if you butcher and Muslim using a
gun knife vehicle or otherwise and
thousand points if you burn or bond in
mas 2500 points if you nuke Mecca which
is the place of that right now I know
this is hard to believe
doing this is legit this is real life
seriously where does the media when it
comes to shedding light what Muslims are
getting attacked are Muslims not human
do we not exist or anything but media
literally mentions nothing about this
and I feel like this is a serious
serious issue because people are getting
letters of this punished on Muslim day
and you want to know what's crazy people
will actually do this so my message to
my Muslim brothers and sisters is that
please do not respond with violence I
know I probably don't want that response
about this I get crazy at our boxes that
I'd rather not respond with violence we
are people of peace and if you are not
Muslim watching this please do the right
thing and stand by everyone who was
getting harassed its 2018 let's not
judge other based on their skin color
faith or where they come from
I'd rather us care about what's in their
hearts what's inside seriously this is
just spreading ignorance ain't never
told us this just causes more violence
and the media ain't stayin ish they're
not saying nothing at all and this
holiday that's coming April 3rd it's
gonna be a scary scary day because
there's actually people who would
genuinely do that when they see letters
like that it would actually go out and
do that but I'm going out there
especially the UK because these letters
have been going out in the UK please
stay safe it makes you guys raise
awareness about this so everyone can
know and we can have the power to make
it stop just I cannot believe that it's
actually real stuff like that
it gets me really really angry but at
the same time we have to know how to
handle a situation like this so make
sure I say seek media they're not
mentioning it but everyone who's
watching this Muslim are not Muslim as I
told you guys make sure you got stand
with people who are getting harassed
we're humans too and we don't deserve
this man throwing acid at people's faces
pulling the head job other people's it's
not a joke it's something that every
single one of us have to take seriously
so dunya if you guys can raise awareness
on this issue stay safe
I love you guys I'm gonna end the vlog
here tomorrow's gonna be another during
you're going to gender I cannot wait to
bring you guys with me because the vlog
is we're gonna be even more lit this
whole thing kind of put my mood down
because I thought was some kind of joke
but ended up being legit like legit
legit Cena all over the internet all
over Twitter was getting like twenty
thirty thousand retweets and so many
people were getting this in there man
seriously I'm trying to find out who was
sending this stuff but there's like a
number we could call now it's legit
gonna call the number while like doing
the black but there's no number or
nothing like that
I want to know who started this what I
started this God do you have no life
and what you're doing is not gonna face
us because we're gonna stand together
and make sure this does not happen and
do me a I love you guys so much thank
you guys for listening I appreciate
every single one you guys Muslim or
non-muslim doesn't matter we're all one
