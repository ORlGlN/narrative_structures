have some crazy crazy bad news for you
guys literally some of my family members
are even crying our hamster
dumi has passed away he died
yes Dina it died we do not know the
reason how it died seriously my family
would take care of it every single day
especially Hamza's father he would feed
him everyday and take him out every day
and just do the right things because
he's a really pet guy I wasn't there to
see what happened behind his father and
having his mother which is my sister she
texted me she called me she let me know
and she said that'd do me fell asleep
and he never ever woke up so I'm
seriously so devastated I'm so confused
I'm heartbroken because our hamster dumi

feel I actually felt like he was part of
our family and to know right now that he
passed away seriously breaks my heart
