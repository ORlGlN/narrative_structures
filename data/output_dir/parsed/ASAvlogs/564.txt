and how I freakin almost died so I
started off the vlog at this amazing
beach called Siesta Beach it's ranked
like one of the top three or one of the
top 5 best beaches in all of America so
I start off the vlog there and I started
by saying thank you guys for helping me

working their butts off trying to get my
luggage I still do not have my luggage

me so much and getting American Airlines
on there but to trying to get my luggage
so I start up to like at the beach and
then I started vlogging this turtle
buying this turtle I was either gonna
buy a turtle or an alligator and I
sacrificed the alligator and freakin
bought this turtle I thought we was
gonna be friends but this turtle he's
the main reason of everything today
so I took this turtle I went to the
beach I was blogging the beach I was
doing amazing shots I was showing I
literally was having an amazing vlog so
far and then like the stupid idiot I am
I get I do like really like dumb stuff I
decide I'm like you know what I'm gonna
take this turtle I'm gonna put it into
the beach and I'm going to put myself on
it and vlog since this turtle is huge
and I wanted to do something cool I
wanted to catch some amazing footage for

gonna let you all know how I lost my
frickin vlog camera and how I almost
lost my life and thank thank you all for

dope footage I feel like I've been
having horrible aha give you guys a
whole block today so I may give you guys

couple minutes later I put this in like
the beginning of the beach I go on top
of it I was slipping I'm so vlogging on
video is crazy man I'm slipping rotors
is crazy this is crazy then I finally
get on top and I start vlogging and like
swimming you know a little bit away so
while I'm vlogging and swimming a little
bit away
I'll get you know I'm comfortable you
know this turtle was really comfy I'll
start laying on it and just started
chilling and vlogging and I was just
like venting and talking talking just
talking so much to you guys and I was
talking you know talking deep in the
heart and I was talking about a lot of
mazes of Aussie guys I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you guys I love seeing
you guys I love meeting you guys I just
met a lot of you guys and don't ever be
afraid to ask for to take a picture with
me because someone came up to me so
scared to take a picture you guys are
the ones who you know who got me here to
where I am said you guys the ones who
made me so of course I'm gonna take a
picture jobs don't ever be afraid and
that I was talking literally on this
turtle crazy thing is I was even on this
turtle I mentioned slim and I was like
slim loves turtles you know his turtle
speedy and I was like y'all I love
turtles too man and I was like slim in
some has some had my GoPro now it's mi
regular black camera I'm risking my life
this is exactly what I said I'm like yo
I'm risking my life slim if you guys do
me a and said I'm risking my life and my
camera cuz slim got my GoPro and I
forgot to get from him before I you know
before I came to Orlando my I didn't
mind using my regular vlog camera
because you know I thought you know I
thought I didn't know I didn't expect
anything to happen but I should have
expected something to happen because you
know turtle and slim person loves
turtles and speedy turtle I'm blaming
slim and speedy and turtle for killing
my black camera ya killed my black
camera
slim don't I trust me I'm still gonna
roast y'all my family right now but that
roast is coming soon that ropes is
coming through and just wait on it just
wait on it I'm still vlogging on top of
this turtle and chilling like I was my
hand was literally hurting from lagging
but I just enjoyed because it was you
know the weather was was coming through
it was the little breeze I was basically
chilling on the turtle but the thing
what I didn't know was the little waves
like little waves would come and it
would push me further out like back back
and I did not notice that I didn't
notice that I was just lying to children
I also mentioned on the blog while
vlogging I was like guys nas is right I
would never want to get stuck in the sea
because you know look at this is crazy
man I feel like one of those movies
where you stuck in the middle and like a
shark will come out of nowhere I'd
rather be stuck in a desert and then I
started messing around like fooling
around saying don't let go of my camera
don't let go I'll be here Jack you be my
bros don't ever let go don't ever let go
and I come back up and I'll speak in my
black hair mouths I love you black
hammer I would never let you go you're
amazing I was seriously saying all that
to my vlog camera and now that I think
is it like they are a seriously thing my
black camera was actually like a person
I like it probably hated me because
while I was talking about black hammer I
was like I know I use you every day I
hold you every day and hundreds of
millions of people have seen you every
single day but don't worry I still love
you so after vlogging with the camera
while on this for a long long time I
decided to come down and like don't go
back into the water I'll still holding
my black camera so while I go down I'm
thinking I'm still like you know kind of
in the beginning like the water will be
up to here or at least here the most but
when I go down guys when I
off this turtle I'll go all it was
literally around 30 feet deep because
the lifeguard who came to get me he told
me you were in the area in the danger
zone where I was around 25 to 30 feet
deep so when I get down I started
panicking and swimming with one hand and
the block camera is out I didn't want to
get it wet out swimming one hand because
when I got off of it this turtle started
going away from me so I'm following the
freaking turtle well while my vodka was
applying myself screaming I'm like kept
swimming towards the turtle but the
turtle kept moving away and I was
swimming really slow because one of my
hands was out my black camera was out I
didn't want to like I didn't want I
didn't want to let go my black camera
and then I had like I was forced to let
go of my vlog camera or else I would
have literally probably died I would
probably cuz I got so tired and I
started paddling I didn't know what to
do I'm like what do I saved my life do I
save this this turtle or do I say the
black camera but I was forced to let it
go I had to let it go and swim with both
hands straight to the turtle or else I
would have died like I needed to hold
this turtle to keep me up everything was
happening so fast and I got so scared
and it was it was so weird because I was
talking with my flock Cameron I was like
yo don't let go I'll never let go of you
like Cameron like the black camera I had
to I had to let it go I'm sorry it was a
scary scary situation and I recommend
everyone who's watching do not ever
record anything while being atop of
something like this make sure you guys
are like on the lookout because I was on
the lookout and I ended up being on a
danger zone so when I threw my black
camera I run on top of the turtle I'd go
on top of the turtle I'm on top of the
turtle and I see my block camera
literally sinking down and I'm like oh
my god my freaking fly camera down I get
off the turtle again I try to grab my
black camera but I couldn't because the
thing was way too deep and was way too
scary there was like the sign that said
danger not swimming zone that literally
like maybe panic I started thinking like
sharks were gonna come I started like
panicking I thought I freaking well was
gonna come and Amy's all screaming so
loud help help someone help someone
would help a lifeguard that shoot
shout-out to Siesta Beach a lifeguard
came in a matter of like literally ten
seconds he came so fast
through like this Arthur yeah me and
grab me and I was holding on to the
turtle and the orange thing he gave me
me swimming and I literally went all the
way back to the shore my whole family
was waiting for me there like literally
like 10 min I'm just waiting like this
they were all looking at me like
literally ashamed like what the hell
Adam like are you dumb I get back to the
land in the sand and of like that I've
heard of the first thing I do I thank
God I'm alive because I seriously could
have died being literally in that
situation if the lifeguard didn't see me
I wouldn't know what would happen and
these past couple days have been
probably one of the worst days of my
life and you guys are the only reason
that like brought me up and everything
and Allah is the main reason why I'm
still alive so thank you a lot for
literally keeping me alive my whole
family was mad at me like are you dumb
why would you be if why don't you notice
don't you think what's wrong with you
why do you keep risking your life a lot
camera and I wasn't the thing is I
wasn't risking my life I just wasn't
thinking I didn't know I want to go like
further out but my whole family was so
complaining I mean Rina was there like
they sponge about take it's my not took
at the Bikini Bottom agreement don't
even start like I'm like him I if Sponge
Bob freaking took my camera like like we
throw in the hands if Sponge Bob took my
spongebob

funny about for Patrick Squidward
anybody from Bikini Bottom if you have
took my vlog camera we throw in the
freaking hands I know it's my fault I'm
an idiot for bringing my vlog camera in
the ocean everything but I'm blaming
this turtle

killed my block camera I almost died I

scariest situation ever I'm sorry once
