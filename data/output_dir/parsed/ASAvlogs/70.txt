is red slim
you've ruined my freaking here now I
can't change it to the color that I want

see it getting darker they look high
guys they just took off the plastic
there's so many people getting their
hair done there's one two I'm like the
only do it here but it's all good in the
hood I'm representing the men out there
who are into fashion man I'm into
fashion I'm into hair I'm into
everything man so they're making it a
dark dark brown not a black because they
said black is too dark to my hair color
my hair color is dark brown gonna be lit
another plastic I got another plastic
one follow this side of the hair cuz now
they combed it up my hair is dark brown
now they're washing it all and I should
be good to go let's do it gang gang yeah

out there was do me gank after an hour
and a half my hair's finally back to
normal but I'm still not done I'm
heading to the barber shop right now you
guys always ask me what do I say when I
go inside the barber shop I always tell
them that I want a skin fade or a hi
tape up and I also tell them to make it
zero in the bottom over here skin fayed
is a whole fade over here in the back
and on this side
hi tape up is the same thing but a
regular tape up is low so I like saying
hi tape up because tape ups are usually
really low so when I say hi tape up it's
a really high kind of like faith so it
depends on which Barbra you go ask in
faith or hi tape up and I line up at a
beard and the line up of my hair so I'm
heading to the barber shop right now and
get my cut I'm gonna get my glow up and
then I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna
show you guys how to magically turn your
hair into gray white whatever color you
want purple blue seriously it's insane
man oh she's she's out man yeah

cuz this is like the future man this is
crazy but I'll see you on the next shot
the barbershop I'm at the barbershop
with the homies easy without man how you

chillin my G is always I see me the last
time I got a cut was two weeks ago with
you it's the longest I've been without a
haircut so I'm uh yeah it's crazy how Z

you already know Z gives the best
freaking cut everyone's gonna be slided
in my damn family oh my God my g-man
thank you so much now see right see you
guys okay do me gang so I just got done
with my haircut I got bad news so when
they dyed my hair there was still some
black dye around the side and the back I
don't know if you guys can see it like
this black guy right here so now I have
to go by color removal and I'm gonna
remove that color so I can fix this glow
up this is what I got to go through a
new me and whenever I get a haircut
whenever I get a coloring this is what I
go through it's not just you girls who
go through six seven hours well actually
you guys go to like ten hours so I know
how you guys feel get so so annoying
it's like wasting time but after I get
the color removal I'm gonna go home and
I'm show you guys how I'm gonna get
white or gray hair
so I'll keep you guys updated it's right
here it's inside here so let's do it the
rest the under next shot okay one thing
I do not like about Long Island look I
need across the street but look how big
this street is man it's like a freaking
Highway man and the cars are going super
super fast so I need to cross it I think
I'm getting lucky no cars here all right
this is jaywalking okay I'm in the
middle the street oh my god oh my god
this is one Street and I got to go
through another one I mean I made it I
made it coaster usually there's so much
more cart but I got lucky there's not
much cars cuz it's nighttime so let's do
it let's get this freaking removal for
the guy on the side of my head I'm
trying to look good for you guys I'm not
gonna live before when I saw black ice
to always try my best to look so good
for you guys but now I feel I don't know
I always feel comfortable with you guys
you guys already know how I look at my
best and you guys know how I look at my
horse yo man this really really sucks I
just got inside here and they don't have
the freakin dive removal so now I have
to go home and just use rubbing alcohol
and wish the best I'm doing a home
remedy so hopefully alcohol works out I
don't know let's see I don't know if you
guys can see it but I can't see it but
it's like died in the back do me gang I
am back home with my normal hair color
yeah buddy
I actually like my normal hair color
better than the red color series I hope
you guys are noticing a little
transformation
I believe I'm still like halfway through
I have a comb with me because I'm trying
to grow a beard you know what I'm saying
for the beard I never go like this
because if you go like that is gonna
look like armpit hair so you don't want
to go like that always brush it down
keep brushing it down and if you want to
stick it out a little bit just go you
know just go just just a teeny tiny bit
like that like hey just a little bit you
know is it got the beard oil in my hair
go like this I love your beard and my
beard is officially ready now I have to
take out the little black parts the
black dye on my skin the only bad thing
is I don't have the color of oil and
another bad thing is I don't even have
rubbing alcohol so I'm doing it bollocks
huh I'm doing an Arab style
I got freaking hand sanitizer here and a
and a towel and I'm putting hand
sanitizer all over here let's see if it
removes the black dye I hope it doesn't
burn my iron Ethan but let's see okay
let's see it's actually working man look
some of us coming off dark-brown as you
guys can see is kind of red here here I
feel like the hand sanitizer only worked
like 20% freakin which they would have
liked color removal so I can remove it
but it's all good in the hood this died
thing he will stay like two three days
and I'll be gone but in the process of
this glow-up that I'm trying to do for
you guys and to show you guys how I'm
gonna get gray or white hair I have to
go and take a shower so I'm gonna go
shower and I'll see you guys in the next
shot aw ain't doing any doing anything
we're doing get going gang do me gang I
am back for my shower and I am feeling
better than ever do me gang I'm feeling
like myself again
seriously the past week I was not
feeling like myself I was so like
insecure and I know there's a lot of
people out there who are always so
insecure and to everyone who feels like
that just know that everyone in the
world has flaws no one is perfect I'm
like that a lot I'm always so insecure
sometimes but then I think I'm ahead
like no one no one's perfect and you
also gotta learn to love yourself so any
of you guys out there that are watching
if you guys are ever insecure like me
don't don't be insecure man you're
beautiful and as I told you guys learn
to love yourself but yes do be gay it is
time to show you guys how I'm gonna make
my hair a different color so I'm finally
back to normal finally got my cut even
though I got some dial over me
fixed up the beard fix up the outfit got
everything on you know what I'm sure you
gonna do me gang it is time to tell you
guys my secret on how I'm gonna change
my hair color in literally 60 seconds so
while I was at the salon I was speaking
with all the workers and they kept
telling me all how often to dye your
hair and I kept telling them I diet like
pretty often and they were telling me
like look it's not good to always dye
your hair because I was kind of telling
the lady like please make it silver
please make it white please make it gray
and they were telling me that it's
impossible because it's red and I've
already bleached my hair and it would
have completely damaged my whole hair
and that's why I was forced to pull my
hair back to normal but to be honest I'm
so so glad that I got it back to normal
because they told me about something
which is called I don't I don't even
know what's it called it's this right
here I don't know what language it is I
don't know if it's Chinese or Korean
this is wax look it's blue wax this one
is gray wax this one is purple wax you
literally put it on your hand and then
rub it all over here and then your hair
turns to that color
I'm not even joke
now I know why all these k-pop artists
to be looking dope man this is the
secret man and the funny thing is this
is like freakin 20 bucks and you can use
it so many times if you go to the salon
and get your hair dyed it's like
hundreds of dollars I'm being smart out
here and this is not a sponsor or a
product placement that I'm doing on
YouTube this is something that I just
found out about today I don't even know
the name of it but I'm about to use it
right now since she told me the color
white is the best one I'm gonna try the
color white I forgot to tell you guys it
comes off after you take a shower but
that's still really really dope that you
have a different color without dying and
damaging your hair so now that I have
these and I can get any color I can be
whatever color I want any day thumbs up
if you guys think that's a great idea if
it's a yes thumbs up if it's a no let me
know in the comments below man I wish I
know what this said but let's let's try
it out let's do it man are you open it
up let's get a good amount I believe
this I think this is good rub it on my
hand like this
well the heck it looks like freakin
paint man hope this works out then you
go like this oh my god you're doing my
hair is turning white oh my god is this
crazy so the lady was telling me it's
okay if it goes on your skin or anything
because you can just easily wash it away
she also said if you want it to be more
lighter you can get more white and do
more
I got tissue and water and let's move
this out the way not the way you can see
it looks moving really quick
it'd do me good my hair is gray or white
I don't know what color it is but it is
insane you guys ready one two three oh
my god what is this legit yo this is
legit this is crazy man a freaking cream
just turn yo I don't know Loki man looks
kind of dope actually like it alright oh
do me gang sis my hair right now is
white slash gray from a little cream a
little wax cream from I don't know where
it's from let me tell you guys the pros
and cons to that item let me show you
guys right so the good thing about this
is that like you get something and it
colors your hair pretty much right away
the bad thing about this is that it
takes like 20-30 minutes to like get
your hair done like mine like I really
wanted to put everything but if you just
want like a little small piece or a
small color I think this is the best for
if you want like something you know like
you know a little white there or a
little blue there this would probably be
the best thing for it
but to do like your whole head it might
be really long and it gets messy and
your hands get waxy but it still extol
buying a lot still looks really really
dull so the great news is I got I got
whatever hair color that I want
seriously let me know your guys honest
opinion I think this this will come off
like clutch it'll come in handy whenever
you want but like doing the whole head
it's like kind of a long process but let
me know in the comments below what you
guys think today was like the most
random day I'm supposed to have real
gray hair but now I have fake right here
that looks even better cuz I can just
make it black after my shower but a
doobie gang I hope you guys enjoyed the
transformation do not forget to love
yourself and if anyone out there hasn't
told you today you guys are beautiful
