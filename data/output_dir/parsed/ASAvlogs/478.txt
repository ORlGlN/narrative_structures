alright guys I'm on my electric bike I'm
on my electric bike and caius slim I'm a
pilot everyone for Costigan to take in
the over right here and we're gonna have
like a little race I got to show you try
to make it to the location they're going
to go to the location we're going to see
who's going to win I'll see you guys in
a few so let's see how it goes
a doobie gang and I made it to the
destination and I won they're not here
it was supposed to be a 19-minute drive
for them I made it in 12 minutes this is
the reason why I got this election fight
so I want to take overs and I could just
go through traffic what I do need is a
GoPro so I can show you guys how crazy I
Drive really wild almost got hit by a
car like five times I need to get a
helmet I was driving through literally
everything and I got a GoPro have a goal
progeny to get something to match it on
to put it on the bike so I can show you
guys all the way matter of fact I'm
gonna do it tomorrow
so mom would go through this crazy Drive
and I don't put the GoPro in there and
I'm gonna show you guys how I do it guys
it's been around 15 minutes and they
still haven't showed up so I think but I
think the uber driver took the long way
or he's taking a long time or he's
driving bad cuz guys texted me saying
that but they were still gonna come
later than me anyways but I think the
uber driver just took even longer
because he drives really really bad so
watch until they come they're gonna come
out and complain guy said all I'm gonna
complain like yelling super drive is
crazy man it's over drivers in New York
they're not as good as the one in the
ones in LA this is dumb come on we're
here
Bobby oh you went to the fucking side
roads I went a long way yeah yeah no is

crazy pics of my family and I'm gonna

age of 17 years old was just pretty
crazy because my whole family
so let's not mama tell you guys
something sorry i'ma talk a lot but my
whole family like no one went to college
I was the first one in my whole family
to go to college so I didn't want to get
married they were like well I the only
Adams your trying to get married I'm
like nope I ain't getting married I'm
gonna go to college and I'm gonna try to
do something I love me passion and be
dedicated and then I can find you know
whatever wife that I want that I love
and I can continue on as I'm gonna take
care of my family and then I want to
make my family myself and take care of
my wife and my family but also take care
of my like whole family because when you
get married I feel like that's like a
whole new life like yes you got married
at the age of 17 he got remot age of
like 18 19
nice 24 but I don't know I feel like I
feel like all my sisters are married
he's married but I'm the only one - son
married a my younger brother he's not
married my older brother left school at
a really really young age because he was
a bat he was a badass he used to fight
the teachers and bug out and he left I
mean I'd do the same thing bas stayed at
school I had good grades I CV badass for
good grades he's a badass with bad
grades so he ended up getting married
but with me I came with a choice to not
get married I want you to continue you
know my life and try to do big things
I've dreamed of and right now I'm doing
one of them which is YouTube like this
is like a dream come true I would have
never knew in a million years I'll be
vlogging to millions and millions of
people right now who are watching were
literally you when I'm asleep thinking
in my head when I'm
like people watching when I wake up
people are watching which is pretty
pretty crazy at doom again you guys are
seriously insane and you guys have
changed my life so so much and I still
cannot thank you guys enough till this
day I cannot thank you guys enough
because you guys changed my life and I
just my life view has changed my whole
family's life like I'm I'm trying to
give my family a huge like really good
house right now because right now we're
living in an apartment and I feel like
you know ever since I was young got my
whole family me get you guys a house one
day I promise you I'm gonna get you guys
a house one day I was like six seven
years old and around that age I told my
dad I'm gonna give you a car and I did
giving him a car because I just thought
positive and I just focused and worked
hard and now I'm remembering the times
when I was like mom dad whole family I'm
gonna give you guys a house and I'm
gonna be living with them obviously but
I'm gonna give them my house and I'm
waiting for it and if actually let me
get personal with you guys but in this
house I know you guys seen my room like
the video with Rima the clown prank
whatever you don't see a bed in my room
because I have no bed I don't sleep on a
bed I sleep on the freakin floor I put a
pillow mattress and I sleep like that I
do not sleep in a bed I took out the bed
because it took up so much space in my
room and I feel like I don't need a bed
right now like I want to wait until I
get the house and so we move to the
house and then I'll get a better not
hook it up and it'll be a crazy makeover
what you guys see right now is literally
nothing like literally nothing I'm
waiting I'm still going house shopping
and I'm still waiting it to like we find
the perfect house I have been going
house shopping but I haven't been
vlogging or showing any of it because
the last time I showed it everyone knew
the address and I feel like that should
that'll be just like I don't know really
you don't know you can't trust anyone
out there because there's give me a lot
of kids and I was like Rima Marcin
there's gonna be more kids maybe Mauston
is gonna have moss and Rima gonna have
another sibling there's going to be a
crazy bigger Addams Family and I just
want to keep it you know keep it safe
but the main question is for you guys
and for my mom and dad who always ask me
oh when you're gonna get married when
are you gonna get married out of you're
23 when you're gonna get married he got
married at the age of 17 you should get
married - um nope I'm not getting
married anytime soon
I want to get married at the right time
there's no specific age to get married I
want to get married after you know at
the right time where I feel like it's
right and right now it doesn't feel like
it's right I wanna I want to I want to
accomplish things
first and accomplished you know I want
to get everything done which is get a
house for my family and then get my
license get my own car and then maybe I
can think about getting married after
that and I can move on with the next
chapter of my life as of now I'm still
waiting by getting the house and the car
for myself and a car for maybe another
car for my dad and just having a whole
family and then after that I can maybe
