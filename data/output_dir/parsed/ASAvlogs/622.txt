because I feel like it has like really
dope cool stuff I was gonna put it in
the vlog and like make it a long vlog
but I feel like this video should be a
separate video so you guys can share it
and like I want it to be focused on that
topic and not mixed with a vlog so I'm
gonna be posting it after the vlog which
is going to be around 4 p.m. Eastern
time so if you guys are watching this
before 4 periods in time it's gonna be
up 4 p.m. eastern time if you guys are
watching this after 4 p.m. eastern time
go to the link down below and check it
out it is called the 7 I'm not gonna say
yet because if you guys haven't watched
yet you guys will see you down below if
you guys tweet it to me on Twitter which
is my Twitter is right there I will show
you guys in tomorrow's vlog talking
about Twitter I was looking at my
mentions and you guys keep retweeting my
old tweets at my AltaVista like really
really embarrassing I'm gonna show you
guys some of it just a little bit
because I'll show you guys too much is
really cringey and alright this is one
of them ok so this is this is what I
tweeted the Arabic alphabet is so
friendly it even has a smiley face which
is the letter tap and boobies ohh
what what I'm such a Dumbo what was that
tweeting that actually I do remember
tweeting that I wasn't I was writing
Arabic next to my dad and like I
realized I was like you know like that
looks like a smiley face and then oh my
and that is also gonna be tweet that I
see tweet the stupidest stuff so please
don't judge me with my stupid dumb
tweets that's why I'm Twitter you guys
barely see me tweeting unless you guys
still want to see me tweet stupid stuff
the thing is when a tweet stupid stuff
like that you know all like all those
people that don't know me well like
you've divided Iommi's
don't know me well they judge me really
hard and they just like bashing me stuff
like that I rather not see all those
negative stuff out to see the positive
the positivity so that's why I always
lay off Twitter because Twitter can be a
good place or it can be a really
horrible place I tweeted this in 2012 it
says confession number six I guess I was
making a confession tweets I make out
with my pillow Sarah like why like I
give you guys permission to roast me on
my old tweets like why did why okay I do
