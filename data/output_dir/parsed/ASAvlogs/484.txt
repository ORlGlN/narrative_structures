you are having an amazing day because
we're having a crappy day so if we're
having a crappy day you all should still
be having an amazing happy day today's
video is going to be different it will
not be of like it will be a message that
me and Rima are going to give to Donald
Trump so I didn't vlog today because I
went out to go protest and it was a huge
huge protest I was with Chris Rock so
many dope people were there protesting
for the right right reasons because
take much courage for me to stand up
against the mayor or a governor or the
President of the United States it takes
this is our country and wakin up and
feeling like we're not wanted to be here
not loved or anything because Donald
Trump is president it's a horrible
horrible feeling as you guys know those
a video on Twitter I'll put a little
highlight of a video of Rima how she was
crying because Donald Trump is winning
on Twitter and it went viral all over
Twitter so many news channels were
interviewing me and Rima the independent
BuzzFeed they were asking us so many
questions so we're gonna answer some of
the questions most of the news channels
were asking us these questions that were
about to answer okay so what is your
full name
Rima Sally and how old are you ah she is
five years old and what am I to you I am
her uncle she is my niece but we lived
together and I see her every single day
cuz she is the love of my life
I love Rima so much she she is super
amazing so I did not know another
question is how does Rima know about all
this election stuff and all the stuff
like that it's literally everywhere even
little three four year olds know about
the elections it's everywhere everywhere
in our school everywhere another
question that the news channels were
asking was what happened that day when
she was crying so this is what happened
the elections were on and whenever Remo
to see you know Trump winning she would
see my whole family upset and then she
knows that she knows that she's Muslim
she also knows that Donald Trump has
said some racist remarks right racist
stuff about you know about Muslims so
she knows that if he becomes president
it's it's gonna create you know more
hate crimes is gonna create you know
more more people being racist towards
Muslim I'm not scared of Donald Trump
I'm worried I'm not enough I'm not
scared for myself I'm not I'm not
worried about us I'm worried for people
like her I'm worried for people like her
who go through schools and when they see
all these hate crimes
going on I don't want her to go through
what I went through because when I was
in school after 9/11 I got all these
racist comments towards me and now 11/9
this issue happens and she goes to
school she's Muslim I don't want her
going through all this stuff and I'm so
sorry that to bring this in the bus
bully to it people what people are being
bully to me at school
some friends of beauty to it and so
family to her friends you guys are
hearing it right now from her own mouth
she's going through what I went through
what I don't want to happen is that to
see other people saying oh man he's our
president we have nothing to do now no
you don't speak up we should speak up
and we said you know maybe us speaking
up whoa whoa what make him stop his dumb
policies maybe us speaking up what make
him love everyone saying you know
nothing all he's president we have
nothing to do don't give up man I will
never give up from our family look at

being you know being in a being America
America is a country where it's made up
of immigrants America is a country where
it's supposed to be peaceful and it's
supposed to be a place where you can
walk freely but having someone like
Donald Trump be President is literally
scary it's really really scary I don't
