guys know my dad is in the hospital
right now so I want to give you guys
literally almost every single detail and
it's gonna be kind of really hard for me
to tell you guys really hard for you
guys to even listen to this because it's
just really really hard but if you guys
can't listen to me and see what's going
on with my dad so um the day I'll ended
from I'm gonna Saudi Arabia I was with
my dad I was chilling I was hanging out
with him one thing with my dad is that
he never ever admits like his weakness
he never admits taesik he never says I
like oh I'm not feeling well we have to
like get it out of him he doesn't want
to make his family you know you just
want to make me my sister's my brothers
the kids be sad or be afraid for him and
that's one thing that I really really
hate for my dad like let us know man
like I know you're getting older and
stuff let us know we're we're all here
for you but my dad always wants to give
this strong you know look that he's
strong and he doesn't want to tell
anyone anything so this is the hard part
this is what exactly happened with my
dad and why he ended up in the hospital
and everything so as you guys know I
always tell you guys my dad has been in
hospital the past few months getting
surgeries you know he's getting older
you know his organs they're not
functioning as he was when he was at
least a bit younger and the day I landed
to New York my dad went outside to go
throw out the garbage and when he threw
out the garbage he fainted and fell from
the back of his head and there's this
video of it from from the security
camera that I have but I don't really
want to show the video so I'm going to
show you guys pictures of what exactly
happened so this is the first picture
I'm gonna take you guys through with me
and this is just really hard like to
even let you guys know about I just feel
like I want to give you guys everything
because literally every prayer counts
like I want to take advantage of every
single prayer every single dime from you
guys who watch me every single one you
guys because my dad my dad has been
asleep for like almost three days and I
don't know like I've broken down I've
cried so much to the point where like
like that I need you to wake up but this
is the first picture so as you guys can
see my dad just finished throwing away
the garbage he's heading back to go
inside the house so he's walking back to
another house but then as you guys see
in the next picture my dad literally
collapsed he collapsed and fell on the
back of his head really really hard and
it was so disturbing to watch like I
broke down in tears watching this and
after that he was laying down on the
floor legit laying down on the floor
without anyone knowing none of my family
no one knew because he was outside were
like what the hell where's my dad
where's my dad so that my mom goes out
and she sees my dad on the floor five
minutes later my dad was laying down on
the floor for five minutes straight just
knocked out completely so we all go
outside we go literally go insane and my
dad's been suffering with like dizziness
and like you know he doesn't really go
outside like that go to the store he
never lets us know and I know he's dizzy
and everything like that so when he took
out the garbage and went back that's
when he collapsed and fell on the back
of his head he hasn't woken up since so
I went to the hospital and like
literally my whole family's there and we
just just seeing my dad he's he's asleep
but having to let he's breathing and
like when I hold him and like I've been
holding him every night with him for
like 14 15 hours a day so here see doom
yeah you guys do not know how hard it is
seeing my dad like with his eyes closed
and just just seeing him like just I
don't have gone like that but but still
alive and like I believe in I believe in
miracles I believe in dads I believe in
everything shall I I know I know I know
I know he's strong enough to wake up and
that's all I'm believing right now
neshama he just I just
I hope he wakes up and it comes back to
me stronger Shiloh every single one who
does I know you wake up I just don't
want to think anything negative I'm
gonna stay by his side
yeah that's it I hope you sorry guys I'm
trying my best not to like break down
anything but I just want you guys every
single one you guys to pay for my dad
and I ma sha Allah he wakes I know I
know he feels me and when I touch him
and I know he hears me when I when I
speak to him because he he moves and you
can see him like when he's laying down
in the hospital bed you can see him like
moving his hands trying to like try to
get up and stuff but like he can't he's
like powerless or nothing like that so I
just really really hope shuttle um he
wakes up and he comes stronger like and
shallow or your dad wakes up and that's
it I love you guys and thank you guys so
much I believe in my dad I know he's
strong I know my dad is strong I know
here I see him I see him being strong I
don't he's asleep right now but I see
him being strong we doing here
I know he's strong and I'm not gonna say
anything about him being God nothing I
know he's gonna come back
