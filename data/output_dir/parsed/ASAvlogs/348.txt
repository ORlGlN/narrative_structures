into me gang I hope you all having an
amazing day because I'm having an
amazing day so I'm having a great day
you all should be having an amazing
happy day so today's video is not going
to be a normal blog or regular video I
have no script in this video I'm just
going to say whatever I want to say
because it's an announcement but it's
not a regular announcement is just
something that I want to that I want to
say I was going to wait until I was back
in New York City to say this but I'm not
going back to New York City until like
middle of April because I'm going to
London right after I finish the first
part of this movie so so I decided to
say this now because it's like 100%
confirmed and I want to show you guys
all of it let you guys know and I'm not
I'm not ashamed of this because I know
youtubers who have kids who who are
married but they're ashamed to the shame
to say it to the public I don't think
anyone should be seen if they're married
or have any kids as like that but I'm
here to let you guys know that I am
getting married I'm getting married this
summer it's not a marriage that I chose
or anything it's the marriage that is
kind of like an arranged marriage
because my mom chose the person for me
and she's happy for choosing that person
I know the person it's not I don't know
if you can consider it arranged marriage
but I am getting married this summer but
it's confirmed 100% confirm my parents
already spoke to her parents and she
agreed the parents agreed I agreed and
my parents agreed this is like a whole
nother chapter like I never know in a
million years I'd be making a video like
talking about me getting married because
I know this day would come
I just didn't know winner would come
like I'm 23 years old right now 23 years
old so you guys do not know I'm I'm from
Yemen I'm from a country where everyone
gets married at the age of like 1718 my
mom got married when she was 15 all
three of my sisters got married at the
age of 17 18 my older brother got
married at 18 it's only me and my little
brother to be honest my mom and dad they
they they didn't want me to go on that
path of heisting like like a girlfriend
they're like you know being like a
couple you
Coover like a couple youtuber and it's
like showing her even though I would
have been you know really happy you know
doing that but I'm not going to be
showing the person I'm getting married
to but I will show my kids and I will be
having fun on the show my kids show in
the next chapter because my mom and dad
are getting old so they they really want
me to get married I had a long long it's
been going on for like months and
whenever I put up like a crush or
something they have they always speak to
me about it I was like you need to get
married now you need to get married now

I guess I have like enough to to support
my wife and to have a family I can't
believe I can't believe I seriously
cannot again I do we get I cannot
believe I'm actually like saying this I
don't even know what to say anymore
because the only thing I'm kind of
worried about is just like like whenever
something like I don't know whatever
something like something like this
happens it just it becomes I know just
becomes crazy become like a whole
chaotic thing so I decided to to say now
