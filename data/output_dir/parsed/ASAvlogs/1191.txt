police in Paris are giving tickets oh
I'm sorry
so I've been walking for like 30 minutes
long trying to look fly for tower and I
can't find anything I'm lost and I'm
alone I literally do not know what to do
I've trying to ask people where is the
Eiffel Tower and they don't say what I'm
saying
somebody told me walk that way I've been
walking that way and I wish I was a
suicide as somebody else that I went the
opposite way so now I'm gonna keep
walking and see what's up I mean I don't
mind being lost in Paris but I'm just
kind of worried because one of my phone
dies and I don't even know the name of
our hotel I forgot the name of the hotel
so if I'm lost I'm lost I need to find a
charger gay I found the Eiffel Tower
it's right here with you
hello wait
this is so cool I'm looking at the
Eiffel Tower right now never in a
million years I thought I'd be right in
front of the Eiffel Tower this is
amazing oh my god I'm about to cry this
is beautiful myself Wow

touching it ho ho ho ho ho
look everybody taking Instagram pictures
right there oh she's having a photo
shoot I'm gonna have my Azorean picture

cooler than hers I'm try to go on there
right there and i'ma show the background
right here so if you guys want to check
me on instagram my instagram is adam
solid so went on there the cup to me to
get out and i could have take no
pictures alright it's pretty crazy that
people going up steps she goes at our
hotel I wonder how many steps are those
look they got to go up all from down
there all the way to there maybe you can
go all the way up this crazy this is why
the people of Europe are healthy because
they go up stairs if it would have been
America they would have had like
escalators elevators are probably
something to push you all the way up
there in a matter of seconds this is
under the Eiffel Tower anyone
I've never seen Under
zoom in I see what
we just like a bridge I really want to
go with the Eiffel Tower but the line is
huge I probably have to wait like three
four hours just to get a delightful
Tower but look at this line from here to
there we continue on there and there and
it continues thing is huge
people are still waiting so something
happened over here they're not letting
us pass
whoa I don't know what's going on I have
no funds receiving record this oh yeah
oh nice
what happened earlier
ah just security fire yo how do I go
around we are kidding
