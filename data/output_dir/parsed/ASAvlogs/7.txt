Jimmy gang so I've been reading a lot of
comments from today's vlog and a lot of
you guys like oh my god I love your
editing I love your edit I love when
it's natural stuff but the thing is it's
not even about natural or unedited if
anything the new editing skills that is
right now it's more natural it's more
organic because more footage is in there
usually I take out like half of it
because I would look at it and I would
see it and I'll be like I don't want to
keep that but with the editor they'll
keep literally everything man like
almost everything I don't know I've seen
a lot you got saying that's too much
edit they overdid it but I feel like
it's interesting like it makes it more
entertaining to see you know a crazy
dope at it and if I would do that it
would take me such a long time instead
of making like a no edit I rather have a
nice Q edit so you guys have been all
the comments below the mean egg what
what what huh am I talking too much yes
do me getting so right now I'm about to
show you guys a video the most random
video I've ever

years ago I had this street boxing match
and a hat on YouTube around I think 13
to 14 million views but the thing is
around last year a year and a half that

Kanye West in the song so let me tell

fight that I had because a lot of guys
don't even know the story behind this
fight so I was filming a main Channel
video in 2014 and I seen this guy's in
the street in New York Union Square he
just boxes strangers he used to be a
professional he used to work with Mike
Tyson also one time I've seen a picture
of that dude who boxes strangers of him
pop boxing a girl like he actually
knocked some girl down so when I seen
him in the street I was the youngest I
said dude that not to go down so I
wanted to say if I said mess with him or
like you know when it comes to boxing me
act funny act dumb you don't have stupid
I want to tell him like your mailbox we
made a box woman and I didn't know he
was actually get a box me and it was
gonna end up being serious and stuff so
I'm gonna box it it had jeans on I had
freakin no boxing shoes on I was fasting
