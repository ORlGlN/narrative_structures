I took off the C part of life but fine
internal what's up you're dooming I hope
you're having an amazing day because I'm
having an amazing day so if I'm having
an amazing day you guys should be happy
near easy
you got that right buddy we're right now
on the way to the airport I am heading
to month odd though how I thought I've
been there before - like the airport
place you still series this is like this
this has time it has always distracted
me when I was doing a snapchat she was
distracting me now she's distracting me
in here combat assignment Siri by the
way as a galaxy phone right so Google
Maps what's her name
you guys are probably reading the title
wondering why is it that title but me my
friend were talking about Casey and I
stats his title like never wear this in
the airplane never wear that and the
airplane is really really though Casey
and I set has one of the greatest
probably the greatest vlogs on YouTube I
was telling my friend I'm like I'm gonna
wear this one of my old friends my
school by the way that's what I'm gonna
wear the folk and the machette that are
clothing to Toccata is like your boat
never wear that and I'm like you know
what you shouldn't say that because like
in divine utter any Muslim country
everyone wears that in the airport is
like normal but wearing in America is
probably awkward that's what he said but
he's trying to tell me to not wear it
and like it's not safe
you can Adam just stay in the safe side
don't worry I'm like you know I'm going
to cut that so I have to put on the top
I wanna you know I want to put on some
good so I'm gonna put on my phone
Adam Austin yes Allah is heading to
Qatar
I'm so so happy and I'm so so excited
but it's gonna be like 120 degrees o
Allah okay my brother he cared more
about about his car than us actually
getting it his car is like his life is
on yeah but yeah it should be fun this
is more one of my favorite um my
favorite homes if you guys have seen my
fashion video on my clothes and my
what's in my closet this is one of my
favorite those because I love the color
of it looks gold like like dope and it's
really comfortable and it's really like
even if it's even as hot outside you
still feel warm with this so but one
thing what
do you know who you look like - big bird
from Sesame Street but I'm not big those
all a whose movers know I said so some
guy came up to me and is like yo mom

only arrow you'll see wearing some fresh
easy winneth oh this is the problem here
just looking at you like I see nothing
a lady was looking at me and giving me
like this
dirty dirty look like what the eggs
crazy thing is you can wear whatever you
want like in America when you wear
something like this she'll give you
dirty looks but like in Muslim countries
when you wear like normal clothes like
American iPhone damn nobody says nothing
the Muslims walking walk old slim ten
times and he's not picking up he's right
there my brother's gonna go to
no city sir let's get it going back sir

have to skip whatever belongs to you

body scare anybody got them so about

closer and just cause it's so
embarrassing before I'm embarrassing now

when people would dress like Americanize
they go through so easy but America I
was getting dirty looks people looking
at me people were like checking my bags

to divide been hectic so the thing is
with this probably never wear timmer
American planes but if you don't care
who cares this you wear whatever you
want but we don't want to go through all
that little cause people gonna judge you
