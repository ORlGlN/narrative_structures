an amazing happy day so this video is
going to be a little different but
really really interesting I'll be
telling you all seven mind-blowing
miracles of Allah first of all I'm gonna
tell you guys the meaning of Allah Allah
is the Arabic word of God if you guys
are a Muslim I still suggest you guys to
watch the video because I respect all
religions and I would love to hear your
opinion on it so I'm gonna start and
tell you guys seven miracles of Allah
number one
allows name in Arabic which looks like
this is on Africa it's literally written
on Africa when I went to Google and I
looked up the 3d globe earth if you go
on Africa and look closely you will see
a Las name I went on so many Globes and
I still seen a Las name on it number two
on your right hand which I just outlined
with a pen is the number 18 in Arabic
this is the number one in Arabic and
this is the number eight in Arabic which
is 18 and on your left hand is the
number 81 in Arabic this is the number 8
and Arabic and that's the number one in
Arabic which is 81 if you add up 18 and
81 it equals to 99 which is the number
of all those beautiful names that appear
in the Quran and if you subtract 18 from
81 that equals to 63 Prophet Muhammad
peace be upon and passed away at the age
of 63 subhanAllah that's amazing i
remember i was younger nice to know
about it i'm like well that's so cool
everyone has arabic numbers on their
hands number 3 there is a tree in
Australia that is doing Iraq I like it's
praying literally there's a tree in
Australia that's doing like ah that's
like this and the amazing thing is is
that the tree is making the coat is
facing towards the cabin which is we
pray facing the cabin and the tree is
facing the cabinet which is really
really amazing
some people go there and take photos
with it some people go there and pray
next to it if I ever go to Australia I
need to visit that tree looks so dope
number 4 there was a tsunami in
Indonesia in 2004 and everything was
completely like destroyed and gone other
than the messages over there all you can
see after the tsunami is the messages
just there and nothing being destroyed
in the message after that had that
happened a lot of people converted to
Islam a lot of people were closer to
Allah because they seemed you know they
seen the power of Allah like a las home
is always protected maybe some of you
guys are thinking like all Adam was just
they're all just a coincidence but in
the Quran chapter 41 verse 53 it says we
will show them our signs in all the
regions of the earth and in their own
souls until they clearly see that this
is the truth so remember these are
amazing signs amazing miracles by Allah
number 5 this is a video of a baby that
was crying and once they put on her on
it just started to be you know feel
really relaxed and just like calm down
and take a nap and go to sleep

Quran the word devil and the word angel

hundred and eighty-nine verses from
surah dokomade moon all the way to the
end the year 1389 in the islamic
