good I'm not you know losing weight
stuff like that cuz you never know I
might be fighting soon we got a lot to
talk about do me gang today because I
called something waiting beforehand I'm
gonna let you guys know why but let me
eat real quick and I'll see you guys in
the next shop do me gang once again I'm
so so sorry I keep making videos like a
response - ksi a response to Vitali
today I'm doing another response to one
of one of the phase members his name is
phase sensei and I'm also gonna be
telling you guys the truth about ksi
because this whole thing has become like
a trend like a boxing you to trend
so yesterday I made a video about how
Jake Paul I think would be the toughest
opponent for ksi then I saw all these
comments now like I said before I'm not
a big youtuber watcher so I really
didn't know who Adam Samba was so that's
no shot at him of course he's a big
youtuber even fouseytube so I said okay
let me look into this guy honestly when
case I made that video out even here to
say Adam Sala all I really heard was
fouseytube so I didn't look into him so
I decided to watch this video in
response to chaos on and I saw a comment
saying that he was 13 and O in amateur
boxing let me show you what he said
we'll stop calling out these other
youtubers none of them can find they are
not boxers now before I go any further
what really frustrates me is I watch
some other videos about Saleh and this
is probably a guy that I'll be really
cool with you seems like somebody that I
can actually hang with he loves
basketball in a lunchbox
but striking in the martial arts and
basketball are like my two favorite
things and then I saw this video
actually to the blog he's showing face
rug I'm like oh my god who's that guy I
don't know why is it their faces I got
bothered by his response is because he's
an experienced fighter yes ksi called
himself the nightmare just won the
fighting edge to whether the mind you
can decide is not saying oh I'm a best
boxer I could beat anybody
you understand all right I'm gonna stop
there right now cuz I've already seen
the whole thing but first I want to give
my love my respect to the homie face and
say been cool with Facebook since like
two years ago he's one of the nicest
guys ever I knew of you guys or the face
clan like the face can I love the face
clan you guys a so so dope and I believe
I've seen one of your fights you had
like a professional you do professional
UFC or MMA but I did see that you don't
really upload much but that's that's
really dope are you doing like keep it
up and you also seem like a really
genuine guy you're mining myself so I
appreciate that seriously I appreciate
but phase sense I I gotta tell you
something I know you're super close with
ksi I know you're his trainer and I know
you guys are talking right now and I
called this out beforehand and I will
show you guys proof also I know you're
challenging me right now we can do it
but Kisise the one who got the YouTube
belt that everyone is saying that ksi is
the man to beat and I know you saying in
case I said oh I'm not the best boxer
this and that but if you've seen in his
fight at the end of the fight he called
all the youtubers out he's like any
YouTube wants it how that I mean
I taught the talk and I walk the walk
motherfucker OSE Matt's got this boat
right now if any youtuber wants it he
even put me in his video to make a poll
and everyone was voting for me I want
that belt I want to take that belt from
him and after I take that belt then face
inside then you could try to take the
belt from me
Vitali you could try to take the buff
from me a hold up wait wait wait phase
sense I I've seen a couple of your
videos and I've seen you train ksi so
that makes you his trainer so as a
trainer you're trying to give him an
easy win you're not trying to give him a
challenge you're making it seem like I'm
freaking Floyd Mayweather if anything
you're the professional and I'm the
amateur also ksi is now an amateur
undefeated fighter - oh it's about this
boat right now he's won a known yes I
may be 30 nano back a few years ago but
we're both amateur fighters we fight
with the head gear on and I also
remember when I was wanna know when I
was two and oh when I was five and old I
used to fight people who are like 30 you
know and you don't see me getting scared
telling my trainer hey man we need to
find a way to duck this fight cuz that's
how I'm feeling I feel like ksi is
trying to duck this fight and I called
this out the day ksi released a video
but let me show you guys who follow let
me give a horn of the day KS I released
this video
slim texted me saying this I think can't
sides gonna fight you everyone saying
your name in the comments I replies
saying laughs Matt saw I saw I'm making
a video it seems like he's down but at
the same time he might duck it and then
slim said nah he will look really bad if
he ducks it he said whoever got the most
votes and you got the most votes so far
and I told him as I told you guys bro
the comments must be scaring the crap
bottom that's what I felt like like
imagine seeing comments saying oh my god
Adam starts you know Adam says you know
but we're both we're both amateur right
you had your first fight you're one to
know and I was 13 to know as an amateur
and I was never worried to fight anyone
even if they were 50 you know and that's
that so I'm pretty sure he might try and
find a way to duck me and then slip said
he shouldn't duck it because it's pretty
fair you're both undefeated he's much
taller much bigger he got the reach
advantage and body so I don't know why
he shouldn't accept the challenge and I
kept talking to slim and some was like
da man
just be you he looks confident as hell
plus he's in really good shape and you
out of shape
smoking shisha in ish you got to be back
in shape son then I was like of course I
will bomb sure somehow he's gonna try to
duck it and try to get an easy
and that's upset if he does he just
doesn't want to look bad in front of all
his subscribers and then I said that's
what I'm saying he's gonna def try and
get an easy win bro
he said low-key he might duck it but if
he that's confident as he shows it then
he won't it's crazy how I called it
beforehand and I also set some stuff in
that text after that I think might
happen and when it does I'll let you
guys know matter of fact I'm gonna say
it right now and I'm not gonna post it
and it still it happens so you guys can
know that I'm saying it right now
beforehand I already said what I have to
say and if it does happen I'm gonna show
you guys but yes face sensei seriously
you seem like a cool dude and I know
you're trying to backup your boy case I
you know you're training him it's tough
but everyone wants to see ksi and I
fight and if kid-sized bringing his
trainer on me let me bring my trainer
I'm you face and saying here I'll give
you choices okay I have one of Anthony
Joshua's personal trainers he's also
professional like you he weighs around
the same way as you and he's a trainer
like you I'm really close with Amir Khan
I trained at his gym in San Francisco
and I already know his trainers over
there and I'm really close with Saddam
Ali and I know all his trainers also so
you can choose which trainer you want to
fight since chaos is bringing his
trainers I'm bringing my trainers
Anthony Josh was trainers Americana
trainers or sat down Molly's trainers
you choose face inside and after I give
ksi his L since he's trying to get an
easy win and trying to be slick and take
his way out of the fight I'll get any
one of you guys next ko mother can K so
let me know so I can get into train
thank you guys I love you guys so much

appreciate every single on you guys
thank you so much thank you
