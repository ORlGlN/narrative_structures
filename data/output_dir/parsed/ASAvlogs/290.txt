cannot find a charger so now after you
slim camera so huge shout out to slim -

I need to buy a charge of myself right
now the minneapolis show it was
literally insane so insane and i named
the top 5 so and I said New York and I
have to say Minneapolis you guys are
both at I'm Minneapolis in New York City
you have the balls inside I'm saying it
now because Minneapolis you guys turn up
literally and I learned some Somali
words you guys I try to teach you guys
Twitter squad I try to treat you guys
like to teach me some Somalian words
because there's a big Somali community
here in Minneapolis and you guys kept
tricking me and telling me to say like
these different words like they mean
that means I don't know they mean who
met like I don't know donkey or
something like that but you guys tell
you that I met beautiful ass someone in
person somewhere not someone who's not
Twitter squad because Twitter squad
you guys always trick me into people on
Twitter you guys always always try to
print and the person that asked they
told me a lot of amazing words they told
me 17 that means like hello how are you
they also told me why need Java height
which means like I love you all Waku
jolla Jaime's like I love you just like
a person but wine each other means like
plural like everyone so thank you for
teaching me that I'm still trying to
learn a little more Somali because the
language is so close to like Arabs
especially that I'm Yemeni like Yemeni
and Somalis they have like a lot in
common
we're pretty much like cousins nozzle to
go on because all he does Luol here how
do you change it up every time to go up
change it to a pint break my top 5 no no
it's a time New York City in Minneapolis
is a type I Got News for cities I just
kicked you out there
Wow it's crazy out video just took over
like that I'm so now me was there really
of these didn't it yeah no I love
Australia man I love love but we
definitely come back soon we might come
back sooner than you think Australia you
still be so amazing it was so awkward a
lot of points because milena the two
most awkward points today that happened
in the Minnesota Minneapolis show I was
telling the audience I was asking them
is there any that in the audience so
when I asked is there any bad here in
the building
someone screamed out you you're my daddy
and I was so so awkward I didn't know
what the heck to say I just I guess I'm
a daddy now I'm a nosy I'm proud that
now but was really offensive just like
lowly and the second awkward thing is
I'm gonna tell you guys right now to be
the minneapolis community we're taking
pictures with a couple fans and slim
slim farted next to the fan man he
farted or and it smelled Souls nobody
because I live any moved away use moving
ways out of come here right he's gone
like this news oh no he said I don't
like what are you doing he's not in cold
water as well oh man he farted and he's
like yo walk away from their brunch part
of their oh my clothes cuz they gotta
know yeah whether I gotta be careful yes
you that's so awkward imagine like like
when you guys are taking a picture and
they all smell like a lot like something
really like eggs and you're like that
was that that was a horrible way to
Miller's human to real foot okay my guys
are taking a little mini stops in
McDonald's the only thing that I like in
exams on be honest officially that's the
only hell out thing anyway officially I
probably Kate's the best things out of
everything and there's only paper you
can stop cuz we need like quick places
we have a 14 hour drive to Dallas and me
not we always fight to pay the bill so
this is what me and nos do it every
single time now for every bill and I'm
gonna keep vlogging it so my card I have
I give him one of my credit cards which
is a dark blue card and his card one of
his credit card is a light blue card and
we left the person choose the person who
was you know charging us will attempt to
and every single time they've already
chosen not this card because it's like a
bright light blue top so not you want to
keep doing that we'll keep doing that
but he's going to be charged the whole
time and if you keeps getting charged
also it's kind of unfair because they
haven't charged me he's like no it's
okay it's okay
I'm like okay you know what so we're
going to try that right now for me
we're going to see who they choose I'm
guessing straight up not as well because
the light-blue who would not choose a
label on it like a metal stars blue one
so let's see this thing in the one you
gave I got a hair tutorial if you like
we can fight over the bill so we're
going to let future guys money you know
inside where's the ball all right what
doesn't paper not I got me a
filet-o-fish is mine with extra cheese
in Douma gang I'm back here in our tour
bus as you guys can see we have a new
tour was easy it's not here anymore you
have to leave to London for the last two
shows not it's about to be the DJ but
this tour bus I like this almost even
better because they have PlayStation 4
and you this could turn to like two beds
and it's much much better because the
other beds were like really small and
like six ounces like the cards are the
little bounce you can balance them
literally fall and like straight down
the floor and then you've done but I
just want to say to the people who come
to the show you guys do not have to
bring like all these expensive gifts

hi guys we just got back to the tour bus
once again and I decided to go back on
my facebook to see what's going on on my
face because I never go on Facebook and
the reason why don't want facebook is
because

never ever post on Facebook so I go on
Facebook I'm trying to give it another
chance of trying to you know like see
