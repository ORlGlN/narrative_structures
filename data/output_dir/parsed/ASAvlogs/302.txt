me on Facebook
basically cursing me out telling me you
can beat me up cursing my family out and
when I got home two days ago my mom told
me to just block him just ignore it and
to not give it any attention and I
didn't want to expose the haters name or
nothing like that so I just did what my
mom said because my mom raised me that
way I just blocked him I just ignored
him and I've never wanted to like give
him any attention anymore but today I
thought we can do something fun

for Ramadan Ramadan vlogs or Monts kids
let me tell you guys a little bit about
what's going to happen in them alone so
the only trip that I have during Ramadan
is sneaker con Chicago for the
basketball game and for those two three
days that I'm going to be there I don't
think I'm going too fast but I am going
to make it up after because I have a
really big basketball game and last time
when I did something like sporty during
like Ramadan which was the boxing fight
two years ago I literally almost fainted
and I felt like almost died which is
kind of like a dump thing for me to do
if I'm boxing or like doing something I
should like especially if I'm a waiter
cago if you're more than like a distance
you're allowed to like not fat so for
those three days in Chicago I'm not
going too fast and I've agreed to like
the Chicago basketball game a long long
time ago I didn't even know my birthday
with the number on so I have to go by
I'm gonna make it up so inshallah
everything goes wrong but for the rest
of the whole Ramadan I am home
I'm chillin and with the family I'm
having ramalon vibes I'm planning on
doing Ramadan skits obviously Ramadan
vlogs long Ramadan family vlogs Ramadan
challenges Ramadan pranks I have a lot
in hand and like really cool ones don't
ones coming through so I really hope it
turns out great and some Ramadan live
streams maybe like maybe double down
like Instagram lives I don't know what
line you guys let me know the comments
with what live streams should I use
Instagram lives or something live I
don't know you guys let me know the
comments below
