what up guys welcome to another AS a
daily rant today our topic is about our
favorite sport and we're gonna talk more
what we like and what we don't like
first off if you go to my Twitter you
probably already know what my favourite
sport is my favourite sport is cricket
so creamy you guys probably like happy
guys by like what is creaky and other
props like all creosote warning
well basically cricket is like this 8
hour long game it's like it's like
baseball with the flattered bat and we
have like three sticks behind us the
batter has three sticks behind them and
they have to the person that's pitching
it or bowling it he has to try to hit
those things and get the person out I
don't explain it properly but that's
like my favorite favorite sport like
like right now I just finished watching
about a tower match between balance and
Scotland and guess who won guess just
Rama's guess yes yup Bangladesh won
it was a crazy crazy chase like this no
knowledge had to chase about 318 runs or
you guys probably think as points or
whatever but they have chase 318 runs
and they caught it they got it in
they made 323 runs and the destroyed
Scotland so Big Ups to balanced Corral a
shoots all the bonnet supporters out
there we did it one more master goes to
the quarterfinals what I like about
cricket is being a closer to my country
I was born here but my family's from
Bondish and when I watch cricket ish
it has like I get this pride aside me
Obama this and like when I watch these
like it's like ironic split it just it
brings you pride basically so that's why
I watch it I can praise a lot of
Pakistanis I watched when Pike's time
please and let unions that watch from
the Indians played they have that pride
inside of them like every time Pakistan
is winning
they'd be all hype they're all the
Pyke's times we build have been stuff
and the waiting is waiting all the
Indians be happy it's like it's a matter
of pride basically and you know that's
what I love about kriegie just it brings
everyone together every single fan of
Bondish they all get together all the
Pakistani fans they all get together
lndia fans they all get together all the
sri lankan fans all the South African
fans all the English fans everyone gets
together the best of you
of cricket and the sport that I least
like or dislike would be boxing
I feel like boxing takes so much energy
from you like I have nothing wrong with
boxers but I feel like boxing is like
you know it's like biting it but some
people who know how to box they take
advantage of it like it would probably
beat their Dean up and get kicked out of
the school as something an atom bomb
that my favorite is cricket my least
favorite I would say is bucks but all
sports to be honest is good be it as
gifts of the body like everything you
play is good
I said golf I don't think that's good
for you are you just finger a long thing
and you swing the ball and whoa and make
it make sure it goes far something but
I'm that I feel like every other sport
is very good for you yeah I don't know
is there anything humble is any sport
that's not good for you besides golf
maybe that's the end of this round hope
you guys enjoyed comment below your
favorite sport and it's whether you
dislike and like the most and let us
know so yeah so tomorrow that's a wrap
peace Missy boy ace lazy a a sleazy
about to spin a freestyle so please take
it easy I'm a weird dude and my bars
crack I'm just sitting here chillin but
the brush my teeth with this miswak you
better not laugh at me cuz believe me
believe me I'm Adam aka a sleazy a
sleazy hey guys what's up this is Adam
and welcome to a si dirty Reds today's
topic is sports so I'm gonna tell today
what's the sports that I like and what's
the sports that I don't like you know
I'm saying number one I love basketball
I started playing basketball when I was
eight years old and I just fell in love
with basketball I was in the basketball
team in middle school and high school I
still play it every single day and I
still do play it so if any of you want
to play me let me know
and my favorite basketball teams are the
Lakers and the Knicks number two I also
love boxing some people think boxing is
a really dumb sport because you just hit
yourself and stuff like that but what
you guys do not know is that you know
boxing is like boxing is a science you
know I'm saying boxing it takes it takes
the brains to do its box you know when
you when you have to fight somebody you
got it you got to know what the diagonal
you gotta know what to do let's say you
bout to throw a punch I'm gonna teach
you
some boxes kids right now cuz you know I
started back to when I was 11 years old
and you know I used to do amateur boxing
I had amateur fights I was undefeated
and then my box and Isis got taken away
because people want to take away my
license because they scared if I'm gonna
hurt them now this is the other side
most of you know the story I got my box
nicely taken away because I had too many
fights in the street and the reason why
I got into boxing is come because my mom
told me to get into boxing instead of
fighting in the street since I was
younger so I got into boxing and I just
fell in love with I felt like it was it
was a great way to like stay in shape
it's the best way to stay in shape to be
honest I still do train in boxing and
like stay in shape that way but I don't
have fights anymore like that but let me
teach you guys and tell you guys why
it's a science because it's all about
brains you know like the distance the
time management and just everything
let's say I might have a fight with you
I would stand in a certain distance from
you just to like control you and beat
you in that boxing match but if I want
to get close to you I have to throw
quick punches and get back out so you
won't try to hit me or something like
that but if I'm far I can just don't
quit boom quick boom also takes power
and strength and stamina and stuff like
that but also takes a lot of thinking so
don't think boxing is just a dumb sport
it is a cool sport so and if you guys
don't know the enemy box of Prince
Naseem Hamid he was a legend if you
don't check him out on YouTube Prince
Naseem habit number 3 I also love soccer
I mean football sorry don't kill me
European people gosh yes I also love
soccer / football I started playing when
I was really young back to me em and I
should play it barefooted and I just
play almost every single day with my
friends and I just fell in love with it
cuz it just involves a lot of like you
know moving and just trick shots trick
stuff like that kicking it and also
keeps you in good shape
alright so I'm gonna tell you guys the
sports that I personally do not like
this one's for shake I do not like quick
and you guys can blame shape and also
cricket games or eight hours long six
seven eight I don't know how long but
they're over 670 hours long some of them
at 12 hours long like how do you stick
with what you be eating breakfast and
lunch then dinner they be going to sleep
waking up and still could play in a game
like boy what a sleaze you don't play
cricket a sleaze don't play cricket but
if he don't play cricket
he would beat you or cricket nah but
seriously congrats but unless they
wanted a number two bull riding
first of all bull riding is just so
dangerous
and it's just pointless like what you
gotta hold on a bull for eight seconds
and go like that like what Americans
which I think it was who created bull
riding and plus you guys are hurting the
animals hurt me I feel bad for these
bulls I like sometimes when these Bulls
these people that are on top of them so
I I feel like they deserve it because
you're just torturing the poor animal
and just holding it using it and in like
a sport that's not really fun I
understand if you make it race or
something like that something cool
something nice but if you're hurting it
and just like torturing it and just like
messes just you know how would you feel
if a Bulls on top of you and you're
carrying it like that like and he
doesn't like what's wrong with you
what's wrong with you
number three golf don't get me wrong I
like miniature golf and I like playing
golf on the app but when you play the
real real golf you gotta hit the ball
bro it goes 300 feet down 30 minutes
passed by and you're still walking to go
think that's golf that that's not a
sport like that's that's just not a
sport like that's walking you got to
walk then do it again then you gotta
walk another 85 minutes and just go like
no now will ain't nobody got time to be
walking or taking a golf thing you just
just to go there that beau that stuff
golf driving then I find the sport
really boring to watch like I'm sorry
yes sir my brother so sup was good he's
distracting me man I didn't tell you
