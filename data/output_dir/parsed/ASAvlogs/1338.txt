harima say good morning nice actions to
go outside already we woke up and we
didn't even know it was snowing outside
so I'm decided I decided I'm gonna take
him out so we can go check the peel box
and hang out outside don't be sad smile
so we could leave Rima look here say
cheese no smiles et's no say cheese
brill so we could go up okay see okay
let's go outside
let me get so excited before she leaves
you know whatever
say yes say Allah I cannot hear you
why do you take your purse everywhere
you have nothing in there you gonna buy
me something you didn't buy me something
you gonna buy me something Rima are you
gonna buy me something huh what are you
gonna buy me why what are you gonna buy
me a coke Oh give me Lucas
on the deck ahead of you it's snowing
outside and this is the only way I could
take out Rima because of our parents
rebo
put on your blanket you know putting on
a blinker right cuz I gotta go check the
pill box in I can't carry this stuff and
take room at the same time
come on Rima by mu visa look here you go
yeah so the weather right now is
freezing it's a finally snowed after so
long and me and I've gotta meet up
because of this weather me and my
brothers gonna head to the to the
laundry to do some quick last-minute
lunch before we head to Florida and yeah
there's a laundry
I mean fold it out
just for Twitter your head take a stick
for this typically once just one by one
press Start press Start start oh it's
not working
so cool right I see next time we will
put you inside
no it's easy you'd have to shower over
an hour wait for the laundry to to
finish so Mira liberals are outside they
want to make a snowman but you guys
don't do what all right let me see how
much you did so far you guys got a long
way to go
look let's stop stop
all right let's how this goes so
eventually they both got tired and yeah
they're like oh it's to go bah-bah-bah
so I'm gonna take them out to get some
hot chocolate or hot cocoa I'm gonna get
hot coffee the love coffee I don't know
why this is I'm addicted to coffee now
but yeah I'm gonna get some hot
chocolate
yeah what you guys doing look at this
one behind me put it there
what is the head and we have one more
where's Rossi do you know who he is
oh I forgot the next time things get the
map all right here's a see Rossi what
are you doing I gotta get up get a logo
all right so it's hot cops time we just
got to dump donuts and I got myself a
hot coffee
what'd you get all right so today's rent
is gonna be about being yourself what
bothers me is nowadays people aren't
being themselves like they're always
trying to be like someone else
God created everyone a different way in
a different shape in different form in a
different personality if God wanted he
could created everyone equal but he
chose to give every single person a
different uniqueness like some people
they they become something else to get
people to like them if people do like
you it's not for you it's for the person
who became its further person you trying
to be you know they're not like you
they're basically liking that person
because you're being like that person
they're not liking you because you're
not yourself some people also believe
that if they are themselves no one's
gonna like
that is definitely not true because
there are people who find taste in you
behind anyone else there are guys who
likes girls with straight hair but
doesn't like girls with curly hair and
there are girls who like guys with small
muscles but not big muscles you see
everyone has different tastes and there
is someone in this world who has a taste
for you if you are yourself you're gonna
find that right person
how long in your life are you going to
keep trying to be someone else you know
there's gonna be a point where you gonna
be yourself and that point can probably
be too late you probably lose the person
that would like you for who you are
because you were someone else
a good example for this is Miley Cyrus
back then she wasn't herself like as she
grew up she she was what society wanted
her because she was on Hannah Montana so
she had a role in in society as soon as
she left Disney Channel she became
herself I respect it for that because
she is who she is now I'm not saying
that she's a great role model but what
I'm saying is she has a great mentality
of being herself before I leave I just
want to leave with a quick note no
government no person no state can tell
you who to love and who they hate thanks
for watching that was just a quick rant
of what I believe in and know be
yourself hi guys so it's time to wrap up
this blog I hope you guys all enjoyed
