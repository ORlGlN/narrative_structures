come time to show the new jersey turn
off sick
so I'm back here in the hotel in New
York City this whole issue happened in
Philly that I couldn't perform me my
whole family couldn't perform in there
because of like the contract agreement
and then they didn't know that kids will
be performing and they were like oh
we'll do two like health and safety
reasons the kids can't go too late
and the kids can't perform with me and
that kind of put me down like it kind of
had out of the kid first of all let me
start up first first of all the moment
we got in the security asked for ID for
for me slim nah the ass for like ID and
like they were asking for so much stuff
I'm like like ask you where I'm like
we're the ones going like to perform
itself like then they're like giving us
a hassle to go in so that was kind of
weird and another thing is the security
was being so rude to so many people and
when I seen that that was already like a
bad bad turn up and I hate seeing
security that's funny to you guys so
that's when I was like your best like
I'm working with a lot of you people was
telling me like security is being really
what's up and give him a hard time so
that's another thing I didn't like and
then they were like oh she got Rima
can't perform Rima can't go on stage
with me because she's too young and I'm
like boy like you should know I'm coming
with like you should know I'm coming
with Rima and to perform I was the one
around with three my perform I'm
performing I could have performed alone
but I chose not to because I'm not gonna
let Rima Jomon and hams and Hannah they
came from three hours away I'm not gonna
let them stay there and stare at me
perform Rima is going to be expecting to
go to go sing her songs to come on stage
she's ready tell me I don't know if the
mic Isaiah Congo so that's why I don't
perform because it's gonna torture her I
could have entertained you guys did my
whole thing you know but it would have
tortured her like sitting there and
looking at me like if she would have
never got on though with a broken heart
she would have never stopped talking
about it like I know I could have spoken
to her make her understand but she would
have been like torture and I didn't want
her to go through all that but I hope
you all understand filly I will come
back but I did decide to meet every
single one of you guys they're not doing
apologize for everything that went on
there it is what it is sometimes stuff
happens tough crazy stuff happens and
today was one of those so I hope you
