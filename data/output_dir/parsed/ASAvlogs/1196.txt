Germany Poland in Paris but for those
three cities we are not three city
countries will not be doing meeting
greets there we're just having meetings

and I'm you are asking why just meet and
greets but this is what our manager told
us he said I do want to go to Europe and
do meet and greets in August and then do
shows in a couple months from now and go
to Europe again or do you just want to
go to Europe and a couple months and do
the shows and we're like no why not we
go in August dumi degrees then we come

first time we're coming is only me to
greet the next time we're going to come

to be something that you guys are going
to enjoy watching and it's going to be
something really crazy because when we
