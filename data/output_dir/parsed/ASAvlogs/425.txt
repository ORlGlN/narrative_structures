hey guys what's up a doobie gang I hope
you're having an amazing day because I'm
having an amazing ex-wife I'm having an
amazing day you all should be having an
amazing happy day for the past couple
days me and slim have been working on
our music video that we're doing our fun
track which is called partner-in-crime
so I've been spending a couple days in
the hotel and I do not want to show like
most of like the music video I'll rather
let it be like a surprise when it's out
so I decided to do a video today called
ten things you don't know about me or
maybe ten things that you guys may not
know about me because my ride-or-die do
means they know everything literally
everything about me so I'm going to try
my best to say ten stuff that you guys
may not know so we can get to know each
other a little more and plus I have a
lot of interesting stuff that you guys
definitely do not know and I feel like I
could share in this video so let's get
close and let's get ready number one
this one is kind of mean but when Remo
was born I was really really angry not
because she was a girl because I didn't
want any more nieces I had so many
nieces that I wanted and that's you so I
was really angry when Remo was born so I
kind of like not showed her any love for
like a whole month I was you know I
don't know man
I want you to thinking nephew there's
always another girl and another girl and
another girl I have like eight nieces I
wanted enough you but then a couple
months later I mean Rima were like the
closest ever like I love reaches Rima is
my recent number two I don't know to
what age you guys can remember but I
remember this day as if it was yesterday
I was three years old I remember when I
was three years old only this because I
almost died this was the first time ever
I almost died so I was at the park I was
three years old and I found a coin on
the floor and I decided to take the coin
and say swallow it and the only reason
why I did it was because one of my
cousins he would come up to me and show
me a magic trick and say he could make a
coin disappear but then you'll put it
under his tongue so I believed it and I
took the coin I swallowed it and I
started choking on the coin this lady
saw me choking so she came up to me she
try to do like CPR in my stomach or like
I don't know she tried to like grab me
from behind and like let the coin out
but that wasn't working my mom saw what
happened
came to me and did this literally that's
literally what my mom did she put me
like in wrestling Undertaker kind of
tombstone position and hit my back so
hard until the coin came out my mouth
number three I know I've said this
before but feel like I should say in
this video to any new viewers but in
high school from ninth grade until
twelfth grade which is four years I lied
to the whole school to all my friends
saying that I was not Muslim and I was
Hispanic because I was so scared of
being bullied because my past my whole
middle school years in my whole
elementary years I would get bullied for
being a Muslim I was the only Muslim in
my school me and my two brothers so when
I went to a new school in high school
someone asked me like hey were you from
are you Hispanic ELA Hispanic I
automatically said yes because I was so
scared if I said I was Muslim I would
get bullied how I used to be because I
used to get bullied like there was no
tomorrow people used to try to kill me
in my family so I was so scared
if that would happen I don't regret it
because everything happens for a reason
because it just taught me to you know
never be afraid of who you are and
always be proud of who you are and say
it loud and whoever has a problem with
it who cares and I want you guys who are
young and and going through that to not
go through what I did so that's why in a
lot of my shows I speak about this a lot
more number four I never told you guys
this one this one is pretty insane so at
the time where I would lie to throughout
the high school saying that I wasn't
Muslim we had this pizza party right so
we had a piece of party the whole class
agrees to bring pork pork pepperoni
pizza so the whole pizza came I don't
know slim and to keep you know the story
so they're listening listening to it
right now so the teacher brought
pepperoni pizza and I'm there everyone
gets a slice and I'm dad I'm getting my
slice and I'm waiting I'm like yo like
if I take away the pepperoni give it
someone else
they're going to be kind of like
suspicious and be like why is he eating
like the pepperoni I try to take out
that pepperoni and I was like oh I just
don't like pepperoni I don't like the
way it tastes I was in a position where
I was like peer pressured into eating
like eating like pork so this is what I
do and it's completely my fault for
doing this I take the pepperoni and I
eat it in front of the kid who tells me
to eat just to prove to him like like
that I wasn't Muslim and say they won't
like bully me or find out any so I eat
the pepperoni and once he turns around I
spit it out in my hand and I throw it to
the trash and this is completely
mouthful I was peer pressured into doing
it and till this day I mean I don't I
don't regret anything that happened to
me in the past I feel like whatever
happened was was a reason to where I am
today so yeah anyone who's you know
Muslim that growing up in America or
anywhere in the world and it's being
peer pressured into doing something
never do it make your own decisions
number five a lot of you guys know this
but I did amateur boxing since I was 11
years old my record was 13 and Oh 13
fights that I want zero losses that I
had in my fights I mean I did just
because I didn't lose doesn't mean I
like I was hurt like a lot of times I
have bloody noses my nose is really like
someone smacks my nose even just a
little bit I would start bleeding from
my nose sometimes I believe from my
mouth if someone taps me and I would get
a lot of black eyes like I would get a
lot of black eyes so whenever I should
get a black eyes I used to never ever
ice my eye just because I thought I
would be considered like a punk if I
will do that until this day I kind of I
kind of regret that because till this
day I still feel like I have like
bruises on my eyes because I never ever
iced my eyes and I have something that
you guys can't see and they laugh
something in my eye and it's like it's
like a blood vessel in my eye and I'm
supposed to get like surgery to like
remove it I was too scared to get
surgery but I have something in my eye
because of like all the black guys that
I had in boxing and to be honest it
makes me really really insecure like
this this thing right here is like my
biggest insecurity now you guys know
what
biggest insecurity sitting in my eyes
seriously against me it makes me feel
down sometimes I'm like what the heck
like I want it gone but I'm too scared
to get it gone and like I regret it you
guys should have put ice in mine I
should have fixed up my face man when at
the moment when it was bruised up but I
just I was too much of a tough guy
number six six as you guys know slim is
my best friend my partner in crime and
I'm gonna tell you guys how he became my
best friend so in 2012 I met like a
whole group of people and to be honest I
feel like the whole group of people went
out when I met them at the time everyone
will like come up to me and I didn't
feel like they were genuine because a
lot of people were asking me like hey
Adam can I be on your Instagram put me
on the Instagram Adam put me on this
blog Adam put me on there Adam give me a
shout-out I want to gain followers Adam
I want to do this I don't do that every
single person other than slim so slim
stood out a lot like I'll see I'm like
yo man like this dude is like not asking
for nothing he would always come up to
me be like yo I'm happy for what you did
man keep it up bro he would never ask me
for anything and like to other people
around I guess I would say no I can't
really do it because this person is
gonna get mad they would end up hating
me because I said no I can't give you a
shout-out on Instagram because that
person will get mad as it was like it
wasn't really genuine some was the only
one who stood out that's how he pretty
much said he never even told me he had a
YouTube channel until someone told me
that he had a user channel then I
stalked his YouTube channel and I found
him really really funny and really dope
and just genuine man he was like he was
just like he was it straight up and
honest and ever since that day I mean
I'm just had like you know this
connection you know like we just felt
loved and since that day we've been
hanging out a lot and now it's like the
past couple years we've been hanging out
like every single day that's why he's my
best friend and my homie you know what
I'm saying number seven I used to make
rap songs when I was like 9 10 11 years
old I do not know where they are I need
to find my mother's phone her really old
Nokia phone I used to like record it I
used to record the beat with my mouth
and I used to make rap songs me and my
nephew Yusef they were probably the
worst every rap song I remember doing
this song called this is the hood and I
want something like this I wish I can
let some of you guys hear if I don't
have it but if I ever do from the phone
I will let you
here but I want something like that this
is the hood on hollow Bay rich bad stock
could not see I just named a lot of
hoods in New York City it was just
really really horrible but I had things
like rapping number eight okay guys so
this is the scariest moment of my life I
was 6 years old and my dad if you guys
do not know my whole family we didn't I
didn't come from a family where it was
like rich another like that I came from
a family who rarely had anything so my
dad didn't pay a couple car tickets so
and he didn't show up to like the court
day or nothing like that
oh six years old at the time so cops
ended up showing up to my house to
arrest my dad so they take my dad
downstairs and I see the cops handcuffs
my dad and I started crying
my eyes are cried so much and the cops
felt so bad to me seeing like seeing the
Sun cries like that that they actually
let my dad go they took away the hair
cuffs this also like they said sorry and
let my dad back in I remember this
moment like it was yesterday every crazy
moment that I have in my life
I remember it as if it was yesterday I
remember being six years old and crying
so much for my dad and then the cops let
him to go so huge shout out to the cops
that let my dad to let my knife slide
because he knew he was innocent and he
couldn't pay you couldn't afford it man
number nine okay so I'll spoke about
this once and Twitter let's talk me and
you know me and una gang goes taut um I
didn't want to mention it but I'll speak
about it so if you guys do not know
around 2013 that was my last ex
girlfriend but I'm not going to say much
in details but I ended really really bad
she would get really mad at me if I
didn't book her a first-class flight and
if I didn't give her like any surprise
gift things like that she would also get
really really mad if fans spot me
outside and she would give like dirty
looks to fans and from that moment from
all those moments I hated it so much
because if anyone disrespect you know
adieu me Yang and the people that I meet
outside
that's one like that she liked it it's
literally done you can mess with me but
don't mess with it do it again
especially when I'm meeting them outside
and taking pictures and stuff like that
when it comes to fans
give me roots anyone when it comes to me
meeting fans I've turned to like the
nightlight I get too nice sometimes and
that's another reason why she disliked
me after she was like are you too nice
it's creepy and I'm like I'm sorry like
is this it's just me like what do you
expect me to do like I mean like
uppercut she was driving by a headlock
and it's go pop but but but it's just
it's just me I'm not going to change
myself for for anyone I'm just going to
do myself in continue honest that person
doesn't like it then I'm moving on
number 10 when I was 18 years old I
started YouTube but also when I was 18
years old I got on The Ellen Show I was
in college at the time I had finals week
Ellen and her producers called me and
they told me Adam we want to fly you out
all the way to LA for you to be on The
Ellen Show fouseytube was also there my
homie Jeffery was there and other two
people were there Ellen and her
producers called me they're like Adam we
want to fly you out to LA and put you on
The Ellen Show and then I told the Ellen
producers and Ellen that I have finals
that week like I needed like take these
finals and I can't make it up so if I
leave for the Ellen show I would fail my
classes if I would stay and take my
classes I would pass but I would lose a
chance of getting on The Ellen Show so
it was like either going risking taking
a chance sailing class and leaving
school and going on with Ellen and using
that to continue on was like a career
that I want or to just stick in school
and just ignore it so I took the chance
I left my finals I was like Ellen I'm
coming and I'm going to get on your show
I missed all my finals I failed pretty
much all my classes and I stopped going
to college after the Ellen show
everything was going insane literally I
took a chance and like I feel I feel
thankful and blessed because a lot of

in a position where like nothing would
ever happen and nothing would ever been
the right way so I appreciate every
single one you guys who has been here
