oh my god hey guys what's up adieu me
gang I hope you're having an amazing day
because I'm having and not so amazing
this so fine having a not so amazing day
you guys should still be having an
amazing happy positive day I'm gonna
start off the vlog by explaining
everything that went on yesterday around
2:00 3:00 a.m. so after us playing
soccer yes it is like we want to go play
basketball me some months ago a basket
we're having three on three means me
slim in my nephews if versus vikas and
his brothers we're having a nice fun
game slim sprained his ankle first right
he jumped and sprained his ankle really
bad like was really bad and then after
that five minutes later you can see me
playing I mean he's still limping never
like that and then I was telling him I
was awesome just continue playing you
got this you man you got this isn't that
and then he continued to play even while
his leg was limping everything 10
minutes later my leg literally I jumped
for rebound and I felt and my leg
twisted so hard alright like so hard I
don't think it's broken I don't think
his fraction like that but it was a
really bad sprain and then after that I
got it to continue to play I didn't want
to because I told slim continued to play
to play so I didn't want to sound like a
punk him and like I like punk out but my
leg was destroyed like I couldn't even
move it
I could even play I'll just stand it up
just not moving just passing a ball I'm
like a statue just passing a ball puzzle
because my leg was so bad or hurt so bad
to the point
Yussef man if you had to piggyback ride
me home that's how bad it was
he had to piggyback riding me home those
people looking at me news of the
thinking who regaled finally got home I
was told my mom to go to the emergency
room she they Adam go to the emergency
room I'm like no mom I had to edit the
video that was up yesterday I had to
edit it I did I forgot it done the vlog
added I got it done but like 6:00 a.m.
everything was ready I finally went to
6:00 a.m. I woke up around 2 3 p.m.
uploaded the videos and then after that
my leg was like this it's super swollen
right I was super like this and right
now I still don't want to go to the
hospital so don't go to the emergency
room the reason why I don't want to go
because and mom and dad
bugging out on me saying why don't I go
but I don't want to go because when I
went for my thumb I went and then I
didn't go back like I like did she you
know the lady the doctor my doctor she
fixed up my whole thumb and then I
didn't go for the follow-up and I didn't
go I took it off you know I basically
just like didn't care about it so if I
go back I'm gonna get violated by that
lady so I don't think I'm going but I
might be going right now to a different
hospital with a different diet because
I'm scared to approach that lady so I
may be going to a different doctor and
get checked up right now but if I know I
can't take the pain then I would have to
go but I can I can take the pain the
pain from 1 to 100 percent is like 80 90
it's not like 100% but like I can't walk
like I'm literally crawling I'm
literally to the point where I have to
pray while I'm sitting down I'm getting
ahead to the hospital right now my older
brother is gonna take over for the vlog
for a bit and this ain't stopping me I
feel like you know I feel like I feel
like the haters when we want me to stop
you gotta stop but this they stopping me
this same stuff i'ma continue vlogging
i'ma continue going hard I'm gonna
continue going up and shaolong
everything goes well take an atom to the
hospital - what's up what's up Oh cookie
sprained his ankle bad I don't think I
broke it but it's just like this is like
it's like it's like a bad sprain but
it's not broken because I love his
broken are swollen this first thing
first thing you said my brother a couple
months ago he sprained his ankle playing
basketball now madam my religious
brother food now Martino it is I'm
telling you man someone freakin because
it's a some spring single - but not as
bad as mine so sprayed up but he can
like need advice on it my spray did to
the point I cannot walk like a lookout
so I'm telling someone someone jinxed us
with that basketball game or something I
don't know that's what I think but now
we take him to the hospital we got to
see what is the time for gonna say
as I got walk
I feel like someone like a hater trying
to bring me down to not like is up up up
so walking apart of the doctor's office

him up right now filling up the
paperwork's getting the information some
casual dr. McCollum add a new crazy spin
