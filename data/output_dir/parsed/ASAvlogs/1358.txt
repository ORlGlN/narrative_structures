you muscles on the same muscles let me
see your muscles while today's rant is
gonna be about desi stereotypes there's
a lot of stereotypes out there about
desi people like this people are cheap
they see people smell bad they see
people have weird languages and there's
a lot more first of all they said this
is a cheap
we're not cheap we bargain I'm going to
be honest with you we bargain we try
saving every single penny but we're not
cheap like we if we want it we'll get it
by in a lower price cheap is when you
want it but you don't get it because you
don't want to spend on money that's
cheap are you going to get it and a
discounted price at the original price
if it's five dollars we'll take it home
for two but we're going to take that
home that's for sure they say they see
people smell bad there is people in
every single race who there's people out
there who doesn't take showers who
doesn't stay clean who doesn't put
deodorant on it's I mean this is have
some of them this some in DC this evil
that does that but there's that in every
single race the why is the stereotype
today's your widest a stereotype to
brown like it doesn't make sense we're
all humans why splitter race and say oh
let's put this you'll let's just make
digital smell bad let's make our get
drunk and let's make and other
stereotypes like why the last one that
way we're talking about is based halves
weird languages that is the biggest
biggest bf ever because they cease have
the sweetest languages we have languages
like Bengali Hindi Urdu Punjabi and so
many others we have over a hundred
languages in South Asia and every single
one of them are so similar and they
sound so beautiful like when you hear it
you just want to hear more and more and
more that's how beautiful it is
so that lie is false because they hear
something on TV that they don't hear
from us they have to hear from us they
have to get the real voice other than
what they show on Simpsons or whatever
and make the South Asian sound mad weird
it's tough but there's a lot more
stereotypes out there but those are just
a few that I had to clear out to the
people watching this I I love every
single race but I just have to defend
the desi stereotypes that's that's out
there and I just had to clear that out
and hope you guys change perspectives
and change stereotypes Dacey's and hope
you guys enjoyed and that's family hi
guys it's time to wrap up this flag I
have an end of the vlog and so long and
I'm
sit so what's up you guys mister me did

ID and we're so excited to meet you all
and looking forward to everything wanted
to talk about something that I've been
seeing people tweet to me and you know a
lot of people have been asking me stuff
about I had this fight I had this kind
of like fist fight I had back in high
school three four years ago and I don't
know how it's just been like I'm gonna
spit it's been it's been going
everywhere now this Facebook like called
hood fights shared it and a lot of
people have been seeing it a lot of
people have been watching the fight and
seeing and then judging me the wrong way
and saying that why did I fight oh this
is not the way I was supposed to do so I
don't want to show all of it because or
some of it because I don't want to like
promote I know there's some kids who
watch the hwacha vlogs and stuff so I
don't want to show like violence or any
fights here so yeah basically I had a
fight with somebody and the fight was
couple years back I was I was 16 years
old when the fight happened is walking
home from school and the kids family his
mom and uncle as you can see from the
video the mom and the uncle has his
hands around like that they approached
me they came up to me and they told me
fight my son I don't know why any pair
or any family would do that they told me
fight my son because we had this little
issue we had we had a problem which was
something you know high school drama
stuff like that but I told him that I
didn't want to I told him I didn't want
to fight and stuff but the mother told
her son
swing at him swing at him he started
swinging at me and I don't ever want to
fight or I don't ever fight unless I
have to so the kid started swinging at
me and I had to do what I had to do
because I don't know I won't ever let
anybody swing at me like that so I mean
I am a lover but I'm a fighter to our
time I fight for the ones who I love I
was basically defending myself I didn't
want I ain't trying to I I don't I don't
I'm like people trying to underestimate
me at that time I took boxing classes
and I wasn't supposed to fight in the
street like that and that that what that
fight got leaked on WorldStarHipHop my
trainer actually saw it in my boxing
training that I saw it and that was the
reason why um my boxing license got
taken away that could never have anymore
amateur boxing fights ever I used to
have like this dream when I was 16 years
old of being a boxer but ever since that
what happened I can never ever have any
more amateur boxers the boxing matches
ever again I just love having my boxing
matches because my mom would come mom
would scream Allah walk button just
embarrass you so would get crazy but now
I can't do it anymore I'm just yeah I
guess I found something else that I love
which is YouTube and vlogs and videos
doing stuff and that video when we're
not when I will start that was the cause
of me getting expelled from our public
school because I had an issue with with
the Dean and the school and they talked
to me and this whole racism issue King
and I had to transfer to a to a private
I trans it to a private school of my
last year and I went to the school and
that's where I met shake so everything
happens for a reason I had that fight if
I woulda never had a fight I would have
never got expelled I would have never
met chef so yeah that's basically what
happened I got expelled and I want to
assign my school and ham to let
everything's great right now and
everything is yeah everything is fine
happens I'm smiling yeah um yeah I just
wanted to clear that what you guys to
say all jokes aside and I wanted you all
to know that I am NOT a ignorant person
ever don't ever mess with people that I
love and if anybody messes with you guys
you can always hit me up I swear to god
I'll handle it in the most nicest way
ever so yeah that's what I want to say
so take care if anybody wants to come to
the show on New Jersey it's Monday yeah
we have a show on Montreal I don't want
one for 22nd November 23rd and we have
many more shows coming through I'm going
to keep you guys updated so take care I
