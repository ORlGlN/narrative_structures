people that are sitting next to me is a
fan and offense that it was the most
awkward thing ever I just felt really
really weird the fan was literally
staring at me the whole plane ride I
mean I still have five hours left but
I'm not even joking I was watching a
movie and she was there like this and
then I fell asleep and when I woke up
she was right but mostly staring at me I
got so so scared because the first thing
when I opened my eyes she was right in
front of my face and she was like did
you wake up and I was there like what
the heck I don't even know if she took
pictures of stuff while I was asleep
but I just felt really really weird
because she literally was staring at the
whole plane ride you know when you can
feeling the corner of the eye of someone
staring at you that's how I felt the
whole time so I do me gag I'm sleeping
