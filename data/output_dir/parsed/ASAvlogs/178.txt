another game

gotta ruin it with the hey do me gang I
wanted to talk to you guys about
something and it is about the comments
on my video Adam Saleh the intro chapter
to cap it there so the only reason why
I'm talking about this is because the
key he kind of like encouraged me to
talk about this he said this is good
layer viewers know how you feel and that
you don't really care about the
negativity and you're only focused on
the positives and positivity so I was
reading the comments and like I was
really worried that like the comments
might affect that I'm you know cause
like there's a lot of stuff in the
comments that you know I don't want I'm
seeing I was like an accident actually I
wasn't he was like you're honestly like
all the positivity I see it all boost me
I'm really happy to see that he focus on
positivity you guys goodness and this is
what I also told Nikki Bella first six
hours especially on like when I was like
leaning on me so heavy man bono saying I
was like as long as the real ones out
there are excited for in this project

chap the two means so much to me because
it's not just like oh I'm usually
whatever it's like it's like I see as an
art this is my thing that I want to
explain and let it out to the world so I
want everyone out there to know that
this is something that means so much to
me it's not with any other company or
any other like you know someone who
signed me like hey I'm a sign this is

label infinity I used my own funds

album I got my own studio stuff I got
everything on my own and I just want you
