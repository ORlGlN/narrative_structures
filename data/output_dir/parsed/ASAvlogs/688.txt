guys in a few
what's up for Duma gang so I just woke
up from a nap and I feel so so lost I
feel like right now everything is like a
dream or like you know when you wake up
I'm like a 2 3 hour nap and like your
brain is just like half functioning
that's literally how I feel right now
and I just woke up from the scariest
nightmare ever like it was so so scared
it felt so so real and I want to talk
about it in the vlog so I can inspire
you guys because I feel like this was
like a sign from a sign from God sign
for love for me to tell you guys to
never make you guys quit I had a dream
well I could say more of a nightmare
that I wanted to quit like everything
life in life like I wanted to quit
YouTube I wanted to quit everything like
I didn't want to live no more I didn't
want to like doing anything anymore
because of like certain people that like
made me feel down or anything like that
so I was literally like that's it I'm
done I was making a video and this would
have been my nightmare slasher dream I
was making a video stating that I'm like
quitting not even know where the
location I was at but I was making a
video saying I quit and the only person
that knew behind the scenes with me
making the video was to let my someone's
like Adam don't do it you literally have
almost 2 million people who are like oh
like you know counting on you to con
tell you to make you to make them smile
every single day and I was just like
Noah I don't care like I'm just gonna
quit because of these certain people and
he's like why would you let these
certain people make you quit and there's
like millions of people out they won't
want to see you continue going and then
my family was talking me and I was even
cooperating with my family and like I
was just like acting I don't know acting
so and I really wanted to quit then I
woke up and I'm like well like thank god
this was a dream and it felt I felt
weird because from the vlogs every
single that you guys know me I'm a happy
happy happy guy like happiness comes
first for me if I don't have happiness
then I will never continue on doing with
whatever I do and I suggest every single
one you guys to do the same always have
happiness first - is is number one
happiness and family is the number one
key when you have happy as a family then
I can continue on making you guys smile
and making you guys happy because I'm
always a happy I right now
happy happy person I've been a happy
person for the past literally happiness
is hard to explain it's like a hard
definition of happiness but I will now
art down happiness with you guys
happiness is waking up and seeing your
family and saying good morning to your
mom and giving your dad a hug and saying
I love you dad
good morning how's your day going and
Rima coming up to my room to hit me and
wake me up that's happiness Muhsin
coming into to cry telling me to hold
him that's happy and it's seeing slim on
every single day and him motivating me
and him telling me he loves me his
happiness Rima telling me Adam I love
you too I love you more I love more
that's happiness going to germans'
birthday parties and my nephew's
birthday parties and seeing him smile
and seeing him you know be amazing and
seen him grow with my own eyes is
happiness seeing my family happy and
being around the people that I love
makes me happy and that's happiness it's
so many so many definition that you can
say but happiness comes within family it
doesn't come with money it doesn't come
with fame those things fadeaways it
seriously fades away like you can get
the biggest house you can you can get
the biggest car you have who would never
go anywhere if you have happiness if you
have your family it'll always be
happiness and positivity and this is why
and every step I go in every like up
direction that I go I will always bring
my family like I want to get a new house
I don't want to move in alone no there
will be no happiness on the move alone
with my family I want to move in with my
little brother even if our little
brother kicks me out the rooms that's
that's happiness that's my happiness I
love it it makes me happy that's that's
what makes me a happy happy guy don't
ever quit don't ever let anyone bring
you down because just because 10 people
are saying something negative to you
there's almost 2 million people which is
in the new meaning I tell them to count
on me to to make them happy to make you
guys brighten up your days every single
day while I let those 10 people bring
you down there's millions of people who
want to see you happy
millions of people want to see you
positive there's millions of people who
want to be inspired by you so focus on
those majority of people who want to see
you happy instead of those 10 people who
are behind you they're behind you for a
reason they're my dad down there down
that you're up there always be up there
and be around family I'm telling you
guys right now family comes first and
this is what I'm telling you I'm a happy
happy person because I'm always around
family I have that let's see my dad
vlogging with my dad is happiness
messing with my dad is happiness dab in
with my dad is happiness crates a lot is
happiness literally like that's my
meditation praying to Allah people are
like Oh Adam do you meditate the organ
that's my workout praying to Allah
that's my happiness oh complain or let
the negativity don't complain be
thankful for what you got cuz a lot of
people have it worse and I've seen it
with my own eyes with so many places I
don't want to Africa Iran to Pakistan I
seen it with my own eyes people go
through the craziest like they go
through a lot of stuff so don't think
like your life is done don't think that
you going through going through the
worst thing possible because a lot of
people have worst just be thankful stay
positive and be happy and be around
people that can make you happy and you
will be happy thank you guys so much
