and and tell them that I watch the story
in my city in London UK I watch your
story in my city in Scotland in Ireland
or Malaysia or wherever your heart
desires wherever you live email that I
let them know
because what they do is they take the
most fair they look at where the most
fans are and they they organize where
they talked to organizers of that city
and they they try to get us me and Adam
they try to get to story a sa in in a
show there so if you want us to come to
your city the best thing you do is do
that and yeah we'll see you guys soon
