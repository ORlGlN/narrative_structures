happiness cannot be biggie biggie biggie
can't you see sometimes your words just
hypnotize me
hey call the cops when you see 2pac no
eastside roll you doing oh yeah west
side repping over here oh you live in
Brooklyn oh yeah thanks hey guys what's
up I am Adam Saleh and I am Yousef solid
but I got the same last name as me hey
I'm here with my nephew my oldest nephew
you guys might know him from way back I
know this is super off-topic but I'm
gonna go off topic right now until you
guys share with you guys a story that
none of you guys know and not even my
own nephew so now you don't know this so
this is like this is like an opportunity
that I have like and home did I get so
much opportunity but I do not agree with
every opportunity I'm always so picky I
choose the ones where I can interact
with you guys the most wherever I can
interact with you guys see you guys
that's the one that you like the tours
that I'm gonna be having in future like
the movie with Omar Egan like so many
stuff that I want to give to you guys
only the opportunities that my parents
agree that I like and that you guys like
so I had this opportunity I don't know
if you guys caught opportunity this guy
approached me he's like this really huge
businessmen in Abu Abu Dhabi
he contacted my booking EEMA everything
is like Adam salary we want you for a
20-year contract we'll give you 20
million dollars $1,000,000 each year if
you work with the company with their
business I can't say their company or
business like like nothing like that and
this is what I had to do ad to go to Abu
Dhabi live there for the next 20 years
of my life and I only get to go back to
New York City to see my family for two
months every single year so only two
months every single year I can go to New
York City I see my family they told me
you can still do vlogs you can still do
YouTube videos like that will pay you
this much about 1 million year just for
you Adam for 20 years and then your
contract is done and then you'll be a
millionaire here you go this and that I
felt like they were trying to bribe me
that look Adam we're gonna give you this
money that money but to be honest I
don't give a damn about any money 80
million dollars I'd rather be with my
family throughout the whole I rather go
through see my family grow up
rather see you guys instead of sticking
in one place and and being stuck like
like an Angele so not seeing my family
for 20 years so I told my parents about
it and my mom was going crazy she was
like who the heck would give an offer
like that Evy mom straight-up told me
like it doesn't matter about no money or
nothing like that mom allows me to go to
tours because she knows I love doing
what I do and I'm always back after like
two three weeks she wouldn't ever want
me to go somewhere for a year for 20
years constantly spoke about it with my
dad and my dad says this look he's like
this he was like you stupid twenty
million dollars are you dumb but do it
you had a man but that mom gives him
this look she's like and then my dad
goes from zero to 100 real quick he just
changes his whole opinion every like
it's so stupid to like I love you I want
to see you all the time no I want to see
you all that I've spoke to them
seriously about and I wanted to tell
them as a son like I would never care
about however however much money anyone
gives me as long as I see my family I'd
be with my family I still be as close
with them ever because with you guys my
family giving you guys doing what I love
I love vlogging every single day I love
trying new things I love making videos
for you guys I love just being myself
and just just continuing with life and
they can offer me billions of dollars if
I do not get to see my family if I don't
I get to do what I love if I do not get
to do what I want well I want what makes
me happy what makes you guys happy and
everything if I don't get to do that
then I ain't gonna do it whatever
opportunity you get with whatever amount
of money you get happiness cannot be
bought happiness is free like I want to
live my life with like an amazing wife
with amazing kids I want to have a nice
I want to travel the world yeah I don't
want to be stuck somewhere just because
you know you're getting this much so
that that's why it just got to me like I
feel like I want to cherish you guys
because these people were seriously
trying to bribe me they kept going up
like they were going up for my ten
million like 20 million or 15 years
we'll drop it down like no I would not
do anything just because you're bribing
me look to the business company if
you're watching this right now you which
you probably are look I ain't gonna come
to you however you offered you can hit
me up right now and tell me you're gonna
offer me one billion dollars and give me
Barack Obama and Michelle Obama together
and let me meet them I would not I would
not go to you if I cannot see my family
if I cannot do what I love I'm so sorry
I even had to share the
with you guys I just felt like you guys
should know just I felt a lot of you
guys can be inspired by the story or at
least learn from the story a little bit
because I learned a lot going through
with a lot of opportunities this is this
is not the only opportunity I have so
many opportunities which are just so
stupid I get to choose which
opportunities that I think is best for
me which open to that I want to try new
things which apertures I want to do to
be with you guys to have fun with you
guys so that's basically the story that
I want to share another and I hope you
guys at least you know learn something
from it or get inspired by it I just
learned a lot from them myself like
money money is nothing money comes and
goes but when you have your family
that's when two children find happiness
