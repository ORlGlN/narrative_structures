so growing up I was always just kind of
lost in religion and then I met um
somebody in New Jersey who's Muslim that
I was working with at Popeye's and her
name is Jessie and done basically like I
got really close to her and she was
doing things that I didn't understand I
wanted to you know understand her
because I got so close to her so she
started teaching me about it and I
started researching it on my own and I
ended up really liking it and I guess I
felt connected
