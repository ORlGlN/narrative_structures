it short
nice and short they all started about 15
months ago I was on my way to work I put
my mouth had a look in the mirror and I
found a big bubble on the top of my
mouth so I went to the doctor we did a
few tests and panel I turned out to be
cancer as soon as the doctor told me it
was cancer I was jumped on my phone
instantly and tried to see where I can
invest and put my money to please Allah
found Allah and to build my here after
so I ended up traveling to Africa
building some private projects there a
mosque in a school and came back to
Sydney opened up a little charity
organization made the video if to do
cancer and this went viral and ever
since then how many loves and a lot of
people have been calling me a being
inspired by mashallah what were you
doing before like all this happened
before this happened I had two
businesses one electrical one security
cameras and alarms so humbled I was
pretty successful my business
but I gave it all up for the sake of
Allah so um when they told you about the
girl you had transferred after how long
did they say you were they said you have
covers and months yeah they told me I
have seven months today and that I had
to jump on chemotherapy and stuff like
that but I didn't listen to him and I
just took the
the natural way up yeah so I was taking
natural remedies and ham the love still
still - unless that's your chosen but
how does it make you feel this is like
do you ever be filled down arguing - how
do you how do you feel about all this
they come strong they come times in my
life where I feel down but probably more
because of my pain and stuff never down
with the last part Allah who would why
he's given me I'm always happy with what
Allah sponsors because as I said before
