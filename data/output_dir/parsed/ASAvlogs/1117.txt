anytime now we just drink enough hey
guys I'm Adam and I'm Sheikh and we are
true story a si
welcome to our first AAS a daily rinse
today we are going to be talking about
uniting as Muslims and a couple issues
that is going on and hopefully this
video can help out and bring all of us
together and change the image on Islam
that the world see us as you know what
the fault I feel like you're not smoke
bombs is that we focus on other people
more than we focus on ourselves we'd be
like oh look at him he's so bad look
what he's doing or he's bad but things
we have to always fix ourselves first
before fixing others and that's a
problem that many of us Muslims face
today that we don't look at us we don't
look at our Muslim community we look at
other communities we like or why is this
commute like this why is that coming
like that you know I feel like it's a
major issue and I feel like if that's
solved there'll be a step towards peace
you know so music we've been watching
the news lately and we've been hearing
what's going on in Paris and all the
taxes going on and what the media is
seeing how it's it's it's radical
Islamic attacks and stuff like that but
I don't know I feel like this whole
thing is happening because us Muslims
we're not we're not united slaw means
peace and us as Muslim is supposed to
show that a peaceful side but today we
don't show that we don't show piece we
show aggravation we show
hey we show jealousy we show so many
other low hateful since all same thing
with us like let's say me and shake we
did like a mistake and we tweet out
something or anything
Islamic relator I just anything related
Salaam alaikum stuff like that the sad
thing is that we got tweets from Muslim
people are Muslims brothers and sisters
would tweet us saying oh go to hell
you're not Muslim don't say that that
deactivate go kill yourself we get
messages when we did a mistake we got
messages thousands and thousands of
messages my facebook Instagram
everything that saying I should go kill
myself from Muslims see how she'll kill
myself don't do videos anymore
because what you do is Haram I don't
know just so much stuff I got
from non-muslims who are helping me you
know tell me I don't worry about you
know the the world you know everybody
makes mistakes just continue on the
stuff like that that just made me think
like why why do I see my own Muslims
telling me like like this hateful
message messages when we make mistakes
say we did a sin and how does you
cursing us out cursing our family out
doing worse sin than us how does your
sin is lower than arson that I don't get
like how does what you're doing make
everything better you're making
everything worse but cursing out is
you're making everything worse by
violating us and sending us hate tweets
but how is he gonna make everything
better what are you gonna get out of
that even on Facebook I posted already
this girl her name is Stacy send me this
whole message and it truly broke my
heart when she said she said like she
saw this stuff we went through so she
was wondering like what if she turns you
know she was already thinking about
turning a turning Muslim and she was
wondering what if she makes a mistake
and just everybody goes crazy on her and
I had this sent her long message back I
told her you know just don't don't see
what Muslims do either put an and read
about Islam not about almost all do
because Muslims aren't perfect Aslam is
perfect just to know that everybody
who's you know hating on each other and
just you know saying all these hate
stuff to Muslim brothers is you just you
make an Islamic so much worse you have
to you know you have to know that the
media is already like just making a
sound look bad you're making liquor
anywhere so if you have something
negative to say that you really want to
say toilets say man write it down on a
private paper or something just don't
say it publicly because that is that
will just create more negative attention
and if you don't um if you don't say any
anything negative then all we have is
positive and there's a lot of big issues
going on but you can start somewhere
right as they say you have to always
start peace among just self first and
then you can expect in the world there's
a quote by Muhammad Gandhi he said be
the change you want to see in the world
and I'm pretty sure you know what that
means yeah yeah it means whatever change
you want to see in the world if you want
peaceful in your if you want peace in
the world you have to be peace amongst
yourself and cursing all the people that
is not peace and you can't expect the
world to be such such an amazing angelic
way if you you're selfish and crazy
others out and violating them and saying
so much messed-up stuff you can't expect
peace like that you feed that negative
and you really want to write something
negative in public so bad
or something that you know that would
cause negative attention right in the
paper something to just stay positive
and we gotta unite and just a lot
everything at least you know can spread
more smiles and more positivity we can
see more positivity from this video and
yes pretty much it you guys want to give
us any topics or any issue that you want
us to talk about comment below let us
know what topics wanted to talk about
and we will be doing every single day we
will choose one topic and we'll be doing
it on that and so yeah let us know and
yeah yeah you can even tweet us about
issue that you have and we'll even make
it like a whole video on an issue that
can help out the whole community or the
whole world so yeah it's pretty much if
