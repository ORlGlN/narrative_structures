up guys welcome to another STD lorentz
today's topic is food and I'm basically
talking about food in general as you all
probably know or don't know my favorite
food is brownie and the reason I love
you guys so much is because of the spice
and the taste and stuff like that for me
I feel like spiciness is a must you know
everything I eat I always want to add
spice as in like say Pizza Pizza my
second favorite by the way say I meani
pizza I would put like pepper on top or
say when I'm eating rice at home I would
add like pepper on - or my mom she
reno's like it's a Bengali thing my mom
always adds spice to everything like
whenever she makes like she makes okay
I mean example like which she makes like
meat and stuff when you cook to me she
adds like extra spice when it's very
spicy but to me I feel like it's mild
but if someone else try like some white
guy tried it mm-hmm this is quite spicy
you know no I mean that's mostly me like
I love spice if you go to a restaurant
they say would you like mild spicy or
normal I have like spicy
I don't like mild something cuz he like
you know didn't taste that spice gives
you you know it makes you very like like
I want to explain it you know it just it
is in me you know I mean my second
favorite is pizza the reason I love
pizza is because of cheesy flavor that
gives the the tomato flavor and the
bread flavor and stuff like that and to
be honest I feel like the best best best
pizza would be in New York New York has
the best pizza
I tried pizza all over the world well
not technically but in many countries I
tried pizza and in many cities soup but
they're never like tasting like the one
York ones the newer ones have this
different even though Italian the Amanda
pizza I feel like you
you know I feel like no other taste can
beat the New York Pizza taste because
those are just too amazing I don't have
a third or fourth favorite area for
savory and no I only have one in two but
there are some foods I do not like I
don't like what doing I like okay I'm
giving example Sam I don't know that's
kind of food but I don't like that I
mean I've never tried it but it's just I
feel like it's so icky and stuff you
know I hate icky stuff like it here or
or like slimy stuff I hate even though
those are disgusting that's why I feel
like disgusting like some vegetable that
tastes kinda icky
I don't ever eat those excited hey
speaking of vegetables I love vegetables
but there's so much I don't like like
the green
what's that think I don't know it's like
green is just like a plan I plan one
won't be honest it plays one of the
vegetables that much too little thing
all right I hate this
whatever eggplant is I don't like that
unit I feel like it plans another I feel
like eggplant is another disgusting but
you know everyone has their favorites of
food and their dislikes and I named mine
please do not judge me but wow stuff
