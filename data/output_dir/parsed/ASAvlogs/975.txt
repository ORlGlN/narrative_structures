now about to have a crazy I'm Madonna
workout I really don't know why I'm
working out while I'm fasting right now
but I need time to pass by and to fly
it's about probably like five six
o'clock right now and I have a good two
hours to three hours to spare so I'm
gonna go work out and I'm trying to find
the spot where I used to work out in
Central Park but Central Park is so huge
like it's so big if you walk for two
three hours in Central Park you'll still
be in Central Park that's how big and
huge it is I'm still looking for this
place I'm liking this tunnel let's see
what happens if I scream whoo nothing
happens this place is super far I think
I went off wrong Street and I'm still
trying to go and I can't find it both I
do financially because I have like about
an hour v automatic get home and I'm so
thirsty already and I'm still walking
and you just go oh my gosh I found the
place about it I have one hour left
first side so I have a good probably
fifty minutes to work out and I can just
run home and eat but I finally found out

but so so long I'm here what's up guys
my crazy mofo hi you guys
I'm here I'm gonna give you guys my
workout routine you guys know I do not
lift with lift weights like that I don't
really poised like that because it gets
me
I guess you slow with your hands and it
makes you like so big and can't even
wipe your ass so what I like doing I
like doing calisthenics or I like doing
like you know pull-ups or push-ups
anything that's like you know simple
like that's not like lifting a lot of
weights because guess you cut alone
hold up okay got the home you are
working out come on thirty let's go yeah

hopefully it can help out if you guys
like lifting weights you can lift
weights I think this is better it gets
you cut up and it's just more acting
more healthy

work after flight because I get so full
bloated and I end up sleeping or end up
just editing so outside to workout right
now and if you do you could work out
when you're fasting but just so don't
force yourself don't like I try to push
myself anymore which was a really bad
idea cuz now I'm like so dizzy
