Oh nature's beat huh
you driving near the car
oh it's so we're about goes when we go
and get some puppies so I just got home
from watching the Mayweather vs.
Pacquiao fight it was I don't know it
wasn't what I expect to expected the
fight to be so much better but it was
just like I don't know I feel like the
fight was just I could have been better
it could've been more interesting it did
go all the 12 rounds and I feel like
these are my thoughts my opinions on the
fight I feel like Manny Pacquiao could
have like fought way harder like he
could have went more aggressive more he
could have went in basically Floyd
Mayweather he was he did a great job in
be honest he did a super great job he
was technical he wasn't even though he
was running and he was grabbing hunk
that that's that's playing smart as part
of boxing and Manny Pacquiao should have
went in a lot more I expected him to go
like really hard but he wasn't so it
seemed so easy for Mayweather so that's
why I was saying that if Amir Khan on
September Americans having a fight I
think may 29th so if he has a fight
September with Floyd I think that'll be
a good fight so it would be super cool
they do fight in September and we'll see
how it goes I think that'll be
sync fight - so that would be crazy if
not if Floyd doesn't accept it or
nothing like that Floyd I'm calling you
out how about I come fight you and I'm
gonna give you a crazy challenge nah I'm
just joking but I'll be a crazy fight
and you guys let me know in the comments
below who-who are you guys going for
what do you guys think about the fight
did you guys enjoy the fight did you
guys not like the fight let me know in
the comments prior guidance and on the
blog we showed you idiot um is up and go
granny I just got home from the
Mayweather and the pack your fight and
to be honest I was neutral and but I
feel like tamanna I feel like bolter my
humble and bolted um you know they both
fought well although maybe other had a
lot of parchment we kept like hugging
patio and stuff and I feel like his
defense was strong but it's just he
stayed too defensive you know like while
Peggy was doing all the moves Mayweather
just like this you know but it was a
great fight although it wasn't how I
expected it it was still a good fight
but you know until tomorrow actually I
want Amir Khan and me with fight that's
why that's the one that I got from row
tickets to see bond that hope you guys
enjoy just like that till tomorrow for
another si daily vlog that's a wrap
please
