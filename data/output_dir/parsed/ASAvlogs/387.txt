going to answer this question that I saw
someone comment on today's vlog the
question was what is the top three
funniest moments at your meeting Green
and I thought that was a funny funny
question because a lot of funny stuff
always happen like during meeting green
so I'm talking about the top three that
happen during the Middle Eastern
tour meeting read the first one is there
was this like eight nine year old kid it
was like really long hair it was a boy
but when he came up to me and hugged me
I was like oh she's so cute oh she's
adorable and I told her that I told that
I was the oh shoot is over how old is
she did that looked at me and he was
like what the heck and the boy looked up
I mean he was like I'm a boy then I was
awkwardly standing there like oh man
this is so awkward so cringy so I had to
pull it off and I was like oh so sorry
your hair was just really long and
beautiful I didn't know and so you put
my back in it I got mixed up like that
before and I'm back in my day okay so
that's number three out of the funniest
moments in the Middle East tour number
two was this girl came up to me like we
didn't exact code pictures we did a
snapchat video and then
and she's Adam can I ask you something
and I'm like yes I've caught something
but let me get your bandana or let me
get like your hat or something like that
but she asked me this I believe this
wasn't a man not a man so the girl looks
at me she was like can I smell your
breath and I look at I thought she was
joking she's like I want to smell your
breath I'm like what like girl you want
to smell my breath whoop I don't know if
you guys sometimes like or joking or
pulling a parent course you guys are
actually serious bow is dying right
after me and not with dying laughing
that was number two out of the funniest
moments this is number one this is the
funniest thing ever this was so so funny
so this was an Abu Dhabi and this lady
came she was around she looks like she
was around 30 35 years old she came with
her kid and then the kid came out to me
oh my god hi what's up Adam how's it
going but the mother right away she came

amazing I'm looking at like Oh like
because fangirling over 67 year old man
my dad and then she tells me does he
have room for his second wife right in
front of her kid I'm like I'm like I got
so speechless because I was caught off
guard so I didn't know what to say I'm
like I'm like I don't know you got to
ask him that in my head I'm like Oliver
like if she like tweets about this or
makes the video on this and my mom sees
it and I said you have to ask him my
mom's gonna beat my butt so I really
didn't know what to say I was just like
ah I don't know you got it you gotta ask
him and before she left she was like
give him a big kiss for me and then she
left and the funny thing is she was like
she was pretty decent looking like she
she was kind of cute so my dad my dad

thumbs up if I should tell my dad about
this so we can see his reaction let me
know leave a like smash the like button
