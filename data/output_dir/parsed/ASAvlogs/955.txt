Wow now driving really amazing see how
amazing we're driving hey guys what's up
so I decided to do a rant for you guys
today since I haven't done a wreck for
so long I don't know if it's a rat or
just talking about the topic but I asked
you guys on Twitter if I should talk
about confidence because I've seen a lot
of you telling me before all can you
talk about confidence and how are you so
confident so I'm gonna tell you guys how
I overcame my confidence when I was a
kid and when I was in elementary school
and middle school I was never confident
I was so scared so I'm gonna tell you
guys how I overcame my confidence and
hopefully he can inspire you guys to
become a little more confident or help
you guys out a little bit when I was
seven years old I went to school in
Yemen I was in second grade it was my
first day of class I literally just left
from New York went all the way to Yemen
it was my first time so I was I didn't
really know much Arabic I didn't really
know much of anything so was my first
day of school we're all in line like you
know like the morning lineup and the
teachers are speaking to like the
students so while I was waiting the
morning lineup with the whole school
literally the whole school was in the
morning lineup which was about like
almost a thousand students and then the
teacher was talking she decided to
introduce me in front of everybody I was
already so embarrassed so shy and I was
not confident at all the teachers still
wanted to introduce me because I came
from America so it was like something
new fir this is what she does because
she wants to show off that she knows how
to speak a little bit of English she was
like this assalamualaikum and yeah I
would like to introduce to you and the
xylophone Rika and I was just there like
yeah so she decided to bring me up on
for them everybody yell attack come on
come on stage cook so I slowly walk on
stage and everyone is looking at me like
if I've murdered somebody
you should bring me to the middle of
stage if she starts interviewing me just
random questions in front of everybody I
was so insecure I was thinking of the
most negative things possible happening
to me I'd always put my head down when
I'm so embarrassed and shy so I would
stay like that and teachers asking me
questions let me just tell you the
teacher was asking me questions as if
I'm the president of the United States
of America she was asking me really deep
questions and she was asking it Arabic
so half the time I would even understand
what she was saying this is how she
started asking me questions and I'm not
even joking this is literally what she
did Burma she was singing in Arabic I'm
saying English right now but she was
asking me if I know why America is
attacking the Middle East and the
Muslims who asks a seven-year-old that
question I was so scared I thought I was
gonna faint I didn't know how to answer
it so I was just like this the whole
school started laughing at me because I
answered like this so that I already
made me feel so down like I was
literally about to break down and start
crying on stage she asked me another
question in Arabic she was like do you
think what America is doing attacking
the Muslim do you think that's good but
she asked me that in Arabic so I had no
clue what she was saying so I didn't
want to make myself look stupid and go
like this again so I ended up saying yes
I want anyway yes the whole school right
in front of my eyes what from laughing
to being dead serious but the thing is I
had no clue what she was saying people
got so angry I mean the sound of
screaming I mean calling me these crazy
bad names
I was called yahoodi throughout like the
whole school year well what she means
like a Jewish guy I mean I have nothing
against Jewish people but they were
calling me that because I said yes but
thing is I didn't know I didn't know
what she was asking so I would try to
explain it to the students after I got
off the stage I was like no I I didn't I
didn't mean it like and they would just
cut me off and just call me your ho D
again and laugh at me so a couple years
later in school I would always have
presentations but I would always think
negative and I would end up being
embarrassed at the end or being laughed
at at the end so at the end of middle
school I was like you know what I'm
gonna start thinking positive and I'm
gonna talk to the people as if I'm
talking to my mom I said I'm talk to my
family I had a huge presentation to do a
huge speech to do I told myself that I'm
gonna do it and that I'm gonna make it
spoke to the whole class as I'm speaking
to my brother as I'm speaking to you
guys right now
I ended up getting an A in my
presentation and everybody in the whole
class was literally giving me so much
props and it felt so good ever since
that day I started being more confident
I realized what I'm being embarrassed or
shy that just creates negative energy
when I get negative energies creates no
confidence oh I started to always think
positive throughout my whole high school
years I was being so confident and it
felt amazing yes I feel that being
confident so many times but I didn't let
that bring me down I'll let him make me
stronger and let it bring me up even
more just got to be strong and just
continue on and once you hit that one
presentation I don't want anything that
makes you extra confident that's what
you need and then after that you got it
you're confident after that look now I
live with strangers now go to random
people and I'm like about to almost get
hit you just have to be confident like
you have to be careless well not too
careless but you just have to be like
you know what who cares I'm gonna just
do it risk your life take a chance but
don't take a chance like that whenever I
have to perform on tour or give like a
speech I always think about the issue
that I had a second grade I don't want
it to end up like that being embarrassed
being laughed at so I just make whatever
I'm talking to whoever giving the
presentation to whenever I'm vlogging
I'm giving it to my family I'm talking
to my family because family you're
always confident with method with family
when you're talking with them so always
talk to the person to whatever you're
talking as if they're family and you'll
always be confident I promise you that I
just want to say to my teacher in second
grade I just wanna say thank you so much
for embarrassing me in front of the
whole school you made me into this
confident guy I felt so down I literally
felt like killing myself at the age of
seven but yeah for that whole year I was
really depressed not so confident but it
made me learn and it made me into this
confident guy that I am right now I got
it's time to wrap up this rant hope you
guys enjoyed this fair hope you guys at
least learned something or I hope it
brighten up your day if you did enjoy
this rant make sure you give it a thumbs
up and go turkey I'll see you guys soon
take care peace I like be confident
remember that peace
you
