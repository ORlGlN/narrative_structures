have to because I've done it but it was
crazy crazy prank that I've done there
so I did deactivate my Twitter the
reason why I deactivate my Twitter
because I feel like all the issues and
the gossip the rumors and the assuming
and everything start on Twitter and like
it just starts on Twitter then just goes
all over and just I feel like whenever I
have Twitter just mess up my head it
gives me stress so I just deactivated I
feel so much better without it I don't
know why just so much stress and I know
a lot of you made Twitter just to see I
stay updated with me and everything like
that
I truly appreciate but if you guys want
to see me and still support me and
everything I'll be on YouTube almost
every single day so thank you guys so
much you guys want to stay updated with
that Facebook I'll still be on YouTube
every single day so catch me on YouTube
where stress free so if you guys want
leave a comment below a positive comment
just spreading some positivity because
Twitter I don't know it just messes up
my head so much you just make me it
makes me so stressed like I feel like a
ruins my life I mean there's a lot of
you show a lot of support a lot of love
yes I do appreciate that so so much and
I love that so much but there's also a
lot of stuff that I know you guys say
don't want to get same but just so many
stuff that some people just start
assuming some people start just talking
this and as like they just want to just
start issue start problems and I just I
don't know I don't really like like this
I'll rather just stick with YouTube I
started off YouTube I stick with YouTube
so there's a lot of people who don't
even have twitter oh I've been use
Twitter and I feel like there's a lot of
supporters who don't use Twitter who
just used use YouTube and this they they
know it's stress free they know they
know stress free to just use YouTube so
