everyone emails me for booking inquiries
or anything they want a booking before
shows movies TV shows to promote
something sponsors it's my booking email
it's my official email for like my whole
career and stuff and today I got a
pretty weird email I went from being so
good to like the total opposite I'm
gonna share with you guys but I'm gonna
blur out any names or any information
about this movie company any people's
names just so I don't want to get in
trouble or get sued so this afternoon I
got this first email this was the first
email this is what it said dear Adam
slash management my name is and I am an
independent film director I have been
writing and directing my own films for
almost 15 years now and I'm emailing you
in regards to a movie that I'm currently
working on so I was reading and I'm like
okay like it's about to go down like I'm
about to be in a movie
I will link below some of the previous
films I have directed or been involved
in which were very successful so you can
take a look at some of my work due to my
constant success
I was recently discovered by one of the
most well known film production
companies I'm not gonna say the company
name but it is a very well known company
name now
announced or say it - I don't want to
get in any trouble I'm just sharing this
with you guys and letting you guys know
how disgusting this is but let me
because - no this was the first email
was pretty good pretty good email I just
pitched my storyline to them which they
were extremely pleased with and we are
very close to signing the deal on having
this movie on the big screen I'm now
certain that this will be a globally
successful film I've been following your
channel and watching your videos for a
while now and think you would be perfect
fit
for one of the roles in my new upcoming
film we have some major investors
interested in the film such as and have
also received the interest of other
celebrities who are interested to being
a part of this film some of these
include mmm and mmm I wish I can say
these celebrities name because the fact
that they want to take part in this
movie is kind of disgusting but let me
continue it we have already arranged
roles for them if you are interested I
would be happy to send over the script
and more information on the film we can
arrange a call meeting to discuss the
role and we can discuss the payment also
please get back to me as soon as
possible we can get everything rolling
look forward to response best wishes
CEO telephone fax website yeah so that
was the first email I got I looked at it
I was so excited I was so happy this is
why I should never be happy before until
it's confirmed then be happy don't ever
get excited too fast because then it'll
go completely wrong so my management
team Naz and Heba if you guys don't know
her but she's like my personal assistant
she's literally she she plays a big part
of like behind the scenes so shout-out
to him but she's so amazing she helps
out so so much and they replied with
this do thanks for getting in contact
with us sounds great can we arrange a
call I can schedule you in for tomorrow
4 p.m. GMT in the meantime can you send
us over a brief description of the role
you would like Adam to play any
information you could give me would be
help will be so helpful I can take it
back to my team to further discuss your
proposal let me know Thanks so my team
sent them that reply and I'll speak it's
an ass on the phone I'm like yo imagine
this move roll wants me to play like a
dead guy or something like that I never
expected it for them to want me to play
a terrorist
because these company names and these
celebrities names were so big that I
would have never thought they would
actually want someone like me who makes
videos like this for like entertainment
and nothing that portrays terrorism
anything about trees and it against
terrorism to want me to play a terrorist
in a movie they replied with this dear
Heba thanks for getting back to me so
quickly
sure I can give you more information I
have attached a brief outline of the
film to the email so you and Adam can
have a look in regards to Adams role we
have seen the videos of him in his
traditional clothing and think he would
be perfect fit for the role of the most
racist company but yes his role will
require him to wear the traditional
clothes he wears in his videos as he is
well known for being a Muslim he will
take part and scene 4 of the script
attached the role will involve a suicide
bomb and will portray Adam as a
terrorist I couldn't believe what the
heck was I reading like they seriously
told me straight up we want you to play
a terrorist and do a suicide bomb dude
do you not really think I would I would
never in my life go that low to portray
and like be a terrorist in a movie let
me continue the email they said we hope
this does not offend you and we hope
this is not if you just offended my life
you just offended what couldn't you get
someone someone white to do this like
play why couldn't you get someone
another youtuber who's not Muslim to do
this role anyone can be a terrorist
anyone anyone who's dressed normally can
be terrorist anyone in any color can be
a terrorist not someone who dresses like
this this is what got me kind of
offended and I felt really disrespectful
I'm sure you understand having already
taken part in a film before the film
before that I was in what's called
American Sharia it was an Islamic comedy
movie and the role of my scene was not a
terrorist yes I was wearing this clothes
in the movie but I was an activist
that's why I went to the movie
because I was an activist I wasn't
playing a terrorist as what you company
who's probably watching this right now
wanted me to be I can send over the
contract and other paperwork required in
order to proceed after our phone call
I'm happy to give you a call tomorrow at
4:00 p.m. GMT please send me a number to
call you on best wishes and I called my
team Naz and hit Bowser yo I do not want
no phone call with them just reject the
offer and tell them thank you and just
good bye
so my team replied with this dear thanks
for the information I have just run this
past Adam who quite frankly feels
disrespected by your proposal he would
like no part in this film nor would he
like to be associated with this film to
imply that he will be perfect for such a
degrading and offensive role due to his
religious beliefs and clothing is
unacceptable not just to him but to our
whole team we kindly reject your offer
so you guys are probably thinking like
oh yeah that's it the offer was done I'm
not doing they replied with hi Heba it
was not my intention to offend Adam or
anyone else
so I apologized and to the company if
you guys didn't mean to offend me I
don't know what your attention is maybe
you guys didn't want to harm me you guys
just really needed someone to play that
role but whatever it is it's between you
guys I'm not gonna judge you guys until
you guys you guys have bad intentions
maybe you guys had good intentions maybe
you guys have you guys are not the one
doing maybe someone else to let you guys
know that you guys want someone from
there so no negative vibes or negative
energy towards you guys I understand
this role is a sensitive one hand see
why my team and I have decided to give
Adam a contracted advanced payment of
$100,000 this price will be negotiable
if you decide to take us on Adam can
really profit on his role on this role
and gain a higher non-muslim following
he will not regret this are you guys
serious if I said no and rejected your
offer and you guys are giving me an
money to offer thinking that I will
agree that means you guys are probably
thinking I'm like a money-hungry type of
dude that will go do anything to to play
a terrorist in a movie I would not play
a terrorist as I said before even if
they offer me a million dollars even if
you offer me a bill
my father my mom raised me well enough
to not do something stupid like this and
they say I can raise my following with
non-muslim found if you owe me play a
role ever terrorist how is that gonna
raise my non-muslim follow up how is
that gonna rain my know who's gonna like
me Donald Trump fans who's gonna like
what don't worry about it I'm good with
my Muslim following and I'm good with my
non-muslim following that I have right
now and I pretty sure I do have a
non-muslim following who still watching
me even if I'm dressed like this and
even if I'm Muslim anyone who's not
Muslim right now leave it in the
comments below and show this stupid
company I can say my opinion stupid
company that I do have a non-muslim
following my management team replied as
I mentioned before we kindly reject your
offer you can keep your money and you
can shove it up your sorry guys I'm
sorry it's every single one you guys are
watching this for being kind of not
heated but like kind of heated the fact
that they want me to play a terrorist
just because I make videos like this and
I'm a Muslim youtuber the it gets me
really matches because I make videos
like this doesn't mean I'm gonna go and
play a terrorist I've never in my life
done a video where I played a terrorist
in a row the videos that I've done with
this on is a belly dancing around the
world and it's tough to make people
smile not to make people look at it and
be like what the Freak was that it's
tough to make you know make spread
positive vibes and do videos like this
too for for a good cause I never wear
this in a video to play a terrorist so
what makes you think that I'm gonna wear
this and go to your movie and play a
terrorist in your movie I would never I
would never be in any movie if they tell
me to be in Fast & Furious 8 to play
terrorists I wouldn't be in fasting for
it I rather be in no movie I'd rather
continue my youtube career and not be in
no movie at all this is why it's so hard
for middle Easterns to be in like really
big movies because they see middle
Easterns and muslims as like people to
play like terrorist roles or like roles
where like you're what the media shows
me being in that movie or any Muslim
being in a movie playing a role what the
media shows just proves what the media
shows is right do you guys get what I'm
saying because I feel like I've been
confusing but I hope you all understand
where I'm coming from I've been offered
so many things through my booking and I
only agree with any stuff that I like
let's say I have a sponsor let's say I
have a something to promote I have to
like that if I don't like it I'm not
gonna share it or or a lot of people and
seeing oh it's amazing and want
something that out I can personally
share with you guys and let's and be
honest with you guys and let you all
know that it is really good and it's not
what they want me to say or what they
want me to do and I'm sorry once again
for even sharing this with you guys
because I feel like it's a bunch of
negative energy but I had to let it out
because I was tweeting about it
yesterday and I decided to make a video
about it because it is absolutely
disgusting and I cannot wait maybe when
the movie comes out and whoever is in
that role may be out maybe I'll share it
and let you all know into that movie
company thank you for the offer but
maybe someone else maybe you can get
someone else to do that role I'm not
gonna do that well maybe you can get
someone else who's who's not Muslim to
do it maybe maybe they'll be okay with
it right and anyone can be a terrorist
right thank you guys so much for
listening to my rant I'm sorry after
rants it off with you guys but when
stuff like this this is literally this
is the only time ever had something like
this has ever happened to me and I
really hope nothing ever happens to me
like this ever again and if it does it's
going to be rejected so any movie
company out there please do not even
ever email me something like that ever
again don't waste your time email me
that unless it's something you know
something good something that shows that
you know something that shows the
positive side you know the good side the
real side I am done here I'll see you
guys tomorrow make sure you guys leave a
huge huge thumbs up just to show that
movie company that life isn't about
offering money and accepting and doing
what the Hollywood people want you to do
I feel like they control people out
there they literally tell people what to
do like their pet dogs or the like pet
rabbit I'm not a pet I do what I want
and I say what I want to say and I stand
up for what I believe in
I'll see you guys tomorrow do me yang
take care and peace I like
every day for the rest of my life to be
I can't replacing a baby
