laptop to check my Twitter and stuff and
I seen all you guys tweeting me check
that Channing Tatum shared our video and
I was like nah man this is this is
probably a fake Channing Tatum account
or something so I checked his Twitter
and I checked his Facebook and his real
Twitter that he shared it means it's
crazy and it's not that he shared our
videos is that he's a freaking celebrity
he's Hollywood and he's sharing
something to help the less fortunate
help the homeless people and to make
them smile man this is freaking amazing
and I gained so much more respect to
Channing Tatum and it's just just yeah
it's the guy who has the the hot body
that's that's showing a lotta love is
usually it's usually the guys you know
who had the hot body or whatever that
get judged is really bad but you know
don't don't judge don't judge somebody
by how they look all right so this is
Channing Tatum's page look his verified
his family and like and the funny thing
is I think chef he watched white house
down the other day and today he shared

just making all the success happen you
guys do not understand how much love we
have for you guys this thing is amazing
I'm losing my voice
freaking out so here let's get back to
what we were saying because we had a lot
of news today
number two we the vlog is I'm gonna be
different we shot a video with cream
called New York and Ramadan and he has
part one on his channel and we have part
two over here so enjoy part two until
I'll be back so yeah do you guys know
what is Ramadan now you know it's wrong
yeah you don't know where it comes from
nothing nah oh my goodness Muslims are
yeah what are they they don't eat bacon
Ramadan is when you can't eat or drink
for 30 days I mean from Sun sunrise
sunset oh you never you don't have
Muslim friends I'm gonna be your friend
NASA because we're Muslims also there's
a month that for 30 days that they don't
eat for each day they don't eat from
sunrise to sunset and they do that
before because you can't have sex you
can't kiss you can't eat you go with
that well now I'm not going that why not
cuz I need to eat I need sex so it's up
how do you fifteen fifty anyone sex but
I thought he would fifteen years old you
too young how do you
13:38 other you're supposed to be
playing in the park right did what do
you know about Ramadan I don't know
anything about Ramadan you know I'm that
much what your poster fast or something
yeah which was the fast for 30 days and
we came from sunrise till sunset mom do
you know why they do that know why they
do that because the homeless people on
the street who starve who starve every
day it's a reminder for Muslims into the
human beings to to to get the feeling
and Hawaii how they we don't starve
ourselves and nothing but that's what
it's for and to be closer to our
religion stay away from you can't kiss
you can't have sex you can't eat you
can't drink it's just a reminder to see
how it feels with that so basically my
life I wanna how many meals a day you
eat you see one or two the most
yeah that's right and yeah what no when
Muslims uh fast they get the same
feeling as you guys just to see how you
guys feel because we're spoiled a lot
the people out there so they have money
they don't care just like that we Donna
that's the reason I'm Ramadan we have to
get into other people's shoes and feel
their pain
so basically it's like you're fasting
like it's yeah oh yeah yeah we got you a
shirt and giving something so thank you
so are the first things prayers you know
Ramadan is know you sorta oh my intern
that go ahead explain it
hi I'm Roman down is when Muslims they
don't eat anything from sunrise to
sunset for thirty days that would mean
you have to give up sex
kissing eating and drinking could you
handle that no why not not eating I
mean oh you know what Muslims are mm-hmm
Muslims yes you know the their holiday
the holiday you don't know what Ramadan
is you don't know how Adam yeah let's
you spell it on the wrong way the
Ramadan you know what that is
yeah what is it cuz we have a lot of
Muslims what do you do one month you can
eat and drink in the day you have to do
it after a certain hour in the night
going down
yeah oh no alcohol no kissing no sex no
eating or drinking could you handle all
that mm-hmm
could you handle all that I don't like
this what do you mean good Ramadan you
don't like Ramadan now why not because
it's medieval what do you mean we are in
a free developed country France is the
country of liberty and there's a big
problem that because the Muslims try to
influence the French people to do also
like that Ramadan is it's not if they
influenced you is not they're forcing
you they're trying to help you to be a
better person because when you're
Ramadan yeah it's healthy he also
because I'm fat but the thing is it's
good for your body and we don't do it
just to starve ourselves we do it but
you know the homeless people who are
poor they get starved they get hungry
every single day right so we don't do it
to be evil I'm going to tell them do it
you know it can be done and a good way
somebody who believes in this religion
it isn't good whenever even when
Buddhism they do it also to get purer
it's also it's not Blum's only to the
Muslims all right so with these cool
dudes over here I want to ask them do
you guys know what is Ramadan
I know Muslims celebrate a special day
our brothers and you know we support
them yeah that's all I know
do you know what's wrong that I think
it's like the Christmas of Muslims you
know saying when they kind of go on a
fast
yeah Ramadan is when you don't eat and
drink from sunrise to sunset for 30 days
in Ramadan you can't have sex kiss
eat drink you can't do none those stuff
cos Angela I mean nah I'm not even going
I gotta help with my wife man but
I mean you know it depends with the
devotion that you got with your religion
so you feel into it you just have to
follow and you know I'd hear to it when
we told you that we're Muslim we fast
what comes to mind what do you think we
do for it but anything we do for it well
to actually talk to Allah what do you
think the crispys some people think that
we just do it to starve ourselves fast -
I'm a Christian I fast - so I understand
the connection but we do it for for the
less fortunate the homeless people that
would starve they starve every single
day so we have to get a taste of that -
you know actually where I'm from I'm
from Africa Ghana this is what they do I
was there they they'll kill like a cow a
big bull or like that's for eatin yeah
you know what I'm saying and he don't
call people to come have some food which
i think is pretty cool because you know
for them to starve yourself to give the
food that they want to eat to some
people what would you tell to the
Muslims out there that I'm fasting and
they're watching right now what would
you like to tell them well I'm Allah is
in command a lot would do anything and
you know he's benefits and he's like the
one that created everything what you
don't know if you can't understand it
just leave it at that
and that is a great thing they doing the
Ramadan it's just something that we
normal people cannot do even Christians
we can't do that
so that's like a pleasent of our whole
civilizations come to and leaving in
America you know how even you make me
thirsty man you're making me thirsty I'm
faster than you can't be drinking in
front of you like that sponsor man I
