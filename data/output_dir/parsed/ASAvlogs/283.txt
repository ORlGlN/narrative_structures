love forget it but my parents would go
crazy and I need a fly not like in my
house like right let's get a penny
dumi getting what you guys just seen is
a lot of boxes heavy boxes that fell on
an old lady so a couple minutes ago
before all those stuff fell on her I was
talking to her and she was telling me
how her bird died today and she's buying
a new bird right now so pretty much her
bird died she was really really sad
so she was buying a new bird today so
while she was walking around shopping
for a bird there was this worker who had
a big like a lot of items in front of
him and he was moving it and then he
bumped into something and it fell all
over that old lady that guy didn't even
apologize didn't even help her I had to
turn off my camera and run to her
because I felt so so bad she was really
really old and a lot of heavy stuff fell
on her so I felt really really bad I
just wanted to clear that up with you
guys okay we're over the hot spot normal
let's get away from here coming down
yeah cuz imma end up kicking exactly
sure you're right yeah sure a nice
little big one what do you think should
we get it or not
stay inside there yeah oh wow I'm
helping her decide what bird she should
get so I told it a green one the green
one was good
guys we're about to sign this thing
right here that proves of us getting our
pet you ready yeah already listen is it
well yeah alright guys we finally
finally left the pet store I'm going to
explain to you guys everything once I
get home and I will show you guys and
tell you guys what we got right now this
is what we got and how is that it's
holding the pet we have right now so in
the next shot you guys will know what
you got see I'm a hamsa and hand in
house and as you guys can see is the
common stuff that we have here for our
pets so let me tell you guys why we
chose this pet so first of all we can't
get a dog or a cat my parents are like
allergic or like I don't know they're
just like they're just really scared and
big tests like that and I can't get a
rabbit because rabbits are like somehow
illegal in New York City and I'm not
going to get like a frog or a snake or
any like reptile because I want to stay
away from snake I can't get a guinea pig
because I told you how the story is long
teaser she's gonna think it's a pig and
she's gonna think sickening so I can't
get a guinea pig so one of the workers
she came up to us and she saw that how
does that really like hamsters and I
told her how I had a hamster before so
she was talking to me and she pretty
much told us it's really really touching
story that made me how does that want to
get it right now and we got it so before
you guys see it let me tell you guys the
story of this pet baby hamster so the
work is fold mean Hamzah
that's a hamster that we have right now
is a mistake like it was unexpected the
hamster had so many babies and it was
really unexpected and they have to like
give it away because of too many
hamsters and not much people wanted it
but that hamster was really loving
really nice really unique it was born on
May 20th too
and 17 there was only two baby hamsters
left and no one wanted to give it a home
so we decided you know what since it's a
mistake actually it's not a mistake it's
a blessing we're going to give it a home
and it's a baby you can grow up with her
we got a hamster right Boulder
I'm not your we get back right here and
do me gang in this box right here is our
pet baby hamster so we have our pet baby
hamster side we do not know if it's a
boy or a girl because they told us that
you cannot know if it's a boy or girl
until like a month after they're born
because you have to see it like if it's
a yeah you have to see somewhere if it's
a boy or girl yeah so the crazy thing is
we don't know what to name it so I'll
let you guys every single one you guys
to help us name our pet hamster give it
a really built unique name because
that's the name it needs to have because
we don't know if it's a boy or girl this
is a new member in the Adams family
we're gonna open up the box right now
you guys are gonna get to see it guys
ready yeah guys this is oh-three pinning
our all it's so cute it's myself I got
socks a hamster is sleeping right now so
