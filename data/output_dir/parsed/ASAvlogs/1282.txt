great today just finished eating of
thought right now about to meet up with
shaken slim I came early I've been
coming early these past couple days so
Ryan opposed to me
and it just started raining I said it's
a 30% chance that's gonna rinse it in
and it rains but luckily I got my
umbrella usually when I don't bring my
umbrella and it doesn't rain and the
brain in something crazy just happened
in the train right now I offered this
lady a seat she was about like 40 maybe
40 50 years old the same age as my mom I
offered her a seat because she went in
and she had no seen that I was leaving
next stop so I was like why not give her
the seat so I was like whisk you wanna
sit then she just started screaming at
me because I try to offer on my seat she
was telling me showing exactly like this
I don't need your damn seat do I look
old I have feet I can stand up go sit
down go sit on your seat then I
literally did not know what to say i sat
back down I'm like okay everybody the
whole train was like literally over 100
people in the train they were just
staring at me like I'm some kind of
psycho that I was trying to attack her
or some i sat back down but she
continued to yell at me she started
cursing and I'm like okay and then then
I pushed and I was like miss look I just
offered you to see because it was like
my mom I would I wouldn't mind someone
offering to her see and I just want to
treat you the way I were my mom or
anybody or my sister's to be treated so
relax but she continued to just talk
crap so I just left and I don't know I
felt like like I never knew that would
happen I thought I mean I just offered
my seat I didn't try to kill you into

with today's society but inshallah just
gets fixed because this is just
