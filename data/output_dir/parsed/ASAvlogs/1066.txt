rants today's topic is slim is calling
look at the picture I have slim all
right so how's it start again what up
guys welcome to another AS a daily rant
today's topics animal stories and I'm
gonna be telling the two stories about
some animal stories that I have first
one both are abolished because in
America we don't really have animals
like that so I found this in my village
cuz I live in a village we had I believe
was a duck or chicken one of them that
gave birth right so we had little
ducklings or little chicks and there
were six of them and I swear to god they
were so adorable they were literally
dismal this is how small the chicks or
ducklings you know I'm gonna say
ducklings this is how small the
ducklings were and we had six and I
swear they were so adorable like the way
they move the way they walk and he was
so cute so we brought the 6-2 we also
live in the town like my grandfather he
lived in a town you know so we took the
six chicks and we took it out of town
and you know I fell in love to me that I
fell in love because I've never
experienced in my life and seeing this
for the first time was amazing so so I
took it to the town and I fed it every
day we took so even give a shower like I
put water inside but clean it and when
they poop sides to clean up the poo
it was just so amazing and then one day
two of them were just laying there out
of six so I looked at the two and and I
thought they were probably still
sleeping so I left her alone so I come
back a few hours later and it still in
the same position so I started moving it
back and forth up down left right to see
if it still moves and unfortunately did
not move two of them had passed away
this is probably one of the saddest
death that I've ever encountered and
then I look I went to everyone let go
what happened to these two how do they
died isn't that and then I found out and
they're overfed I mean you know there's
still a young so they must be fed too
much but unfortunately overfed you know
when some people when they see food they
want to keep eating no matter how how
much is stomach care like taking stuff
that's what the little ducklings it they
kept eating and eating and eating and
unfortunately passed away I called back
a few years later and asked them how the
Ducks or duckling is doing and they were
like dinner
no more they're huge down there now
their official big ducks so the other
four like somewhere so later and I can't
wait to go back this app in 2006 and
right now so those 50s about nine years
so who knows if they're still alive but
yeah that's one story another story I'm
about to tell you this please do not
judge me please don't tell me or animal
cruelty or oh this and that I was so
young there was a dog that was walking
around right and I had a huge fear of
dogs so this dog was coming toward me
this this happen about soon so this dog
was coming toward and I got so scared oh
my god would I do there was nothing
around me except this coconut so as I
was coming close to me
I picked with the coconut and I do that
and hit him right on the ribs right here
and even oh like somebody that he made a
noise like that and then he ran away and
I felt really bad because of the way he
was yelling and so and that dog was a
dangerous but later that night that dog
was in a fight with another dog I'm not
making stuff I swear that dog was like a
black dog right and it was these two
brownish dogs who also lived in a
village right so they they gathered they
met up with the black one in the forest
it would we had a farce right behind a
house they met up with the black one I
swear they were beating him up I I heard
it louder clear I swear I'm not joking
about this louder I heard that the black
one was like oh no no not obviously does
he know like oh he was like howling his
stuff I felt so bad and the next morning
I see the same black dog I see him
walking past and he had like yeah like
marks all over him because I know he got
beat up I seen it I assumed my own eyes
been duh from a distance but then I do a
rock so they ran away but they fought
somewhere else but yeah that's another

the llamas calling she said when you
