about five facts about where I come from
like as in my religion my culture my
geography basically everything about
South Asia I'm gonna be naming five -
there's a lot trust me there's a lot of
stuff that I can talk about but today
I'll be naming five let's start fact
number one the number zero chess martial
arts and yoga were created in South Asia
without zero there would be no time line
a good start with number one so Big Ups
to South Asia for creating the zero and
starting the time of zero one two three
four so after she also created chess you
know you know you guys know chess is a
game Feeny sadly she also created
martial arts you know so like this like
you know that fighting thingy but it was
transferred on to China and they also
created yoga like South Asia was the
inventors of those four stuff fact
number two India alone has 300,000
muskets that is more than any country in
the whole wide world
if you go anywhere around the world any
country will not have over 300 thousand
messages India alone has that fact
number three our most popular
transportation is what we call rickshaws
reach is basically a bite with a
passenger thing in the back and you know
it's like that's like a bike you know
people you drive pedal with day and ride
it and then if you want if you want to
go and wonder if we go stop them and
then you get on top and tell oh I want
to go to that building right there or to
go this where whatever they'll know
really what does it drive or ride the
ride yeah they ride you there what I
like but is
it's it's it's slow it's comfortable you
get to enjoy the view while you're going
and you know it's a nice way of
transporting it's way cooler than cars
is way cooler than buses it's way cooler
than planes personally I love riding
them I feel like it's it's a beautiful
view it's a beautiful experience so I
mean that's just mean a lot of do they
hate you because you know when you're
riding there's a rocking horse and then
you get bumpy and stuff fact number 4
the 8th wonder of the world is located
in Pakistan there's a highway that goes
from Pakistan to China I'm pretty sure a
lot of people they don't know that but
that is an eighth wonder of the world
it's probably one of the most
beautifulest view ever it's like it's
like a non-stop highway it's so
beautiful that goes into China and you
know that's one of the most beautiful
ones and also Pakistan has the highest
peak mountains they have number one the
Himalayas and they also have I believe
k2 which is the second top highest peak
mountain which is also located Pakistan
and if this was talking about geography
here Bangladesh has the longest beach in
the whole wide world so you know all
these beaches you go to like Coney
Island Beach Long Island Beach Miami
Beach all these beaches are not compared
to the one about us but has monsters
wanted super long and it's like the
longest beach in the whole wide world
fact number five South Asia has what we
called the Royal banal Tiger it's an
endangered animal but it's the coolest
animal in South Asia it's located in
India and bound - and it's like the
national animal both countries and these
times it's such special animals in those
countries and it's the way they look
it's the way they act and they're also
endangered so they have a lot more
meaning but bonds and India are
sheltering them and make sure they still
live and not get extinct so yeah
hopefully when I go to bunch one day I'm
gonna see one cuz that's like one of my
dreams to see a tiger a Royal Bengal
tiger and all mostly what's so cool
about them like why are they such why
are they the national animal world
