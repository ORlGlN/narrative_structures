today I Chicago just started snowing a
little bit
as for the city
the cold it is Chicago got this crazy
cold first like oh it's only a cold in
Chicago like if you how come Chicago you
need a sweater from Chicago to be warm
like I don't have my passport on me
right now so because they're checking in
the solder in government American
government fucking even enter Saudi
Arabia soon so I have this idea that I
got from California and it's not even
the legit ID I just found out it's a
fake ID so when I vote really have to
modify me they're like literally checked
like literally in like my pants like out
here we have the Charter left open my
laptop they have to check the cameras I
have to check my phone never took
everything takes about 30 bit of process
we've seen the last time it was crazy hi
guys so I finally went through security
and it took me about 40 to 45 minutes
and this is what happened now the guy
remember when I gave my passport when I
was just out to LA I gave him my
passport and I got an ID but when I got
an ID it was a fake ID it was a fake ID
the guy tricked me and gave me a fake ID
so when I gave him my fake ID they were
like look this is a fake ID and it's
illegal to show it to the government
official to TSA so we're gonna call the
police
so the Chicago police came they
literally like sat me down you have to
prove my identity and I think they
thought I was trying to troll them they
thought of trying to troll them and tell
them like they don't try to mess with
them so they were literally like being
on my case so after like a whole twenty
minutes I had that few of my dad's name
my mom say my dad's birthday mom my
dad's my mom's birthday literally all
those information just to prove that I
am me so I'm like look just go on
Twitter go on Facebook go Nestor you see
me there that's me like I'm I could
prove my identity right there like I
mean obviously I make videos every day
that is my identity but they this guy
gave me a fake they checked literally
everything but ham did I have things
find out I was just so worried so many
like Chicago please they're saying or
you can't go to a mom you can't go to
New York after saying shit I go you
can't travel for 24 hours if you get
caught if like the police don't like the
