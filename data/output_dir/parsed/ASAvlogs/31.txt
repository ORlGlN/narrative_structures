dumi gang we have really really bad news
so our whole everybody house that we
have it got completely completely robbed
I'm literally in the front of the house
right now like I don't even know if I'm
supposed to upload this or anything the
cops literally just left they um they
recorded everything we had all the every
me doors locked the keys that the host
gave us give us two keys to lock the two
front doors but the thing is in the back
the back door and there's extra room
that they added like was even part of
the house there's a door there that you
can easily access and it has a lock in
it and it doesn't even work and I'll
show you guys right now and even the
backyard right now anyone can easily
just go inside and it's really really
unsafe to anyone who comes here inside
this air made me like literally for
inside this house who knows like that
could have been someone freaking killing
us or shooting us or something so
hamdullah was safe all of us were good
right now but it's just we lost over
twenty five thousand dollars of stuff my
laptop people's cameras drones clothes
bags literally everything everything
imma show you guys exactly how how they
freakin robbed robbed us in this whole
place anyone can access this like why
why not do a lock in the back and give
us an extra key for the back we thought
the whole time the lock works it doesn't
work anyone can just easily open it and
we're gonna show you guys right there
anyone can easily open easily open up
then go straight in we left to the
Golden Gate Bridge for like six seven
hours this is Fremont um I thought this
was like a safe area I don't know if
someone did it because they have
something against me I don't know but it
just sucks look right here easily access
into here now look they're in the
backyard already in the backyard let's
just see the doors lock those like mow
don't you easily open up and you're
inside a room
oh here come around this side come run
suddenly show you this is the back door
here if you lock it like this still
opens up see you there if you like it
like that
still opens up even though when the cops
came then we're looking at they're like
what the hell like what kind of home
like does not lock your stuff this is
both ways this is the main door that
that's it that never locks are you you
tried anyway side impossible even put a
push on that's one door that one is even
easier if anyone is sleeping here

doors so what we're saying is like what
could we do that there was no safety in
this house at all man no no safety at

here in this happened it's money that
was lost it was a lot of money what if

outside Yusuf's wagon idiot everyone is
in shock I thought this was a joke they
thought I came in I was Tony's
they thought we were pretty and then we
what they were bringing us in same row
like are like we're shocked still yeah
but for me it's every poll I have none
of us some of us have no clothes nothing
man socks are alive no socks I know that
a lot of people know where we're staying
and everything and the crazy thing is we
locked everything like no one liked the
locks that we had from the Airbnb we
thought everything would not like have
access or anything we could've been
doing nothing and it's crazy because now
that now you can know it might be a
personal attack some people know it was
a person who knew it was personal
I mean I don't know a few people knew we
weren't here people knew that we were
staying here but we did everything Co he
locked all the doors we did our part we
did our due diligence but at the end of
the day it was a personal attack and
they broke in what else can we do about
that you know I'm saying this is so
sucks yeah it's a personal attack this
is so annoying like they probably
planned this shit for so long yeah
they're probably planning it what sucked
and it was like I don't know people like
that that's you like expect it like
we're here having a good time all of us
were getting together after so long
we're just having a good time but I
don't know where we're supposed to
expect something like this we did
everything we could you know yeah well
you don't experience like this to happen
so what more can we have what could we
have done
