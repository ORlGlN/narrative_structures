this one I am one this is me this is my
cousin right there hi guys it's time to
wrap this black hope you guys all
enjoyed this vlog if you did make sure
you guys give like a thumbs up and go
Turkey I told you guys I will let you
guys know what happened to my eye I did
not get punched by anyone that I messed
with her like doing pranks or anything
like that which I thought I would
probably end up getting punched because
of that but it was it I was in the
training city and there was about five
people who came out to me trying to
start trouble I do not know if they're
on drugs if they want something but they
came up to me saying why am I looking at
them oh complimenting me like giving me
sarcastic compliments and I didn't even
know what was going on so I completely
ignored them that I don't know where
someone just sucker-punched my eye and
that's when I fought back and all of
them just came on me just artists
stopping on me and punching me was
literally all five of them on me so I
was completely outnumbered but I was
alone I don't even I don't even know how
to explain I don't know if it was a
setup of these people normally they just
set me up or if they just beat me up
randomly I don't know why would somebody
beat someone up randomly and I really
thought they were trying to kill me but
then after that they ended up running
away and then I was like I'm not gonna
call the cops I'm never gonna do
anything because they ran away and I
didn't even want to deal with any
because I was already
I was already hurt from inside and I
guess I don't know to be honest I'd
rather get physically beat up than
having that hurt feeling inside because
that physical can heal in a week but
when you're hurt inside stays stays
there forever and to the people who did
jumped me
I do forgive you so if you ever see me
you can just you just come to me I do
forgive you I'm not gonna start a war
I'm not gonna get revenge I just want
you guys to learn and to not do that to
anyone else ever again because that's
just cuz I learned this literally no
point of just getting revenge on anyone
a lot of you guys have my back and you
guys were saying oh no let's get him
let's find them let's do this in that I
mean if it was like a couple years ago
where I had like hung out the wrong
crowd I would have probably didn't that
but I learned it's just it's just
pointless
you gotta learn how to forgive and yeah
I don't forgive even though get myself
behind a lot and wait I hope you guys
enjoy live I'll see you guys tomorrow
with another ace a daily vlogs I love
you guys thank you guys for all the love
and support see you tomorrow take care
and peace love you
