hey guys
I love whatever mental breakdown today
I'm gonna get my nails done because I
didn't have time y'all got me a cup from
Starbucks and a drink to calm me down
there are state ways
the recipients and I just plan it
start up the really awful mean video my
disgusting video someone made about me
and
there wasn't just about me is about
another person in my life and I thought
I was so disgusting they threw that
person in there when I had nothing to do
with them
and it set me off and then
one little thing chequered me
I lost it a little bit of a mental
breakdown rights let people let their
lives let people be happy why are people
always trying to bring other people down
I don't understand I'll never understand
it the gossiping
speculating spreading things you've
heard shouldn't make someone look bad
integrity and their reputations
it's gross
as someone that's really bad off the
person it comes back to them you don't
have to do anything you don't get ahead
by bringing others down and I just got
to me and other things just came out I
just triggered a jerk heard this emotion
and I had a mental breakdown and it just
felt really really shitty I'm gonna go
get my nails done and
i lashed out on Sean for no reason and
because of my own issues in my head and
he is just best person I've ever met
I don't know how he puts up with me or
why he puts up with me but I'm so
thankful he does cuz
I'd be in a really bad place without him
we're gonna read the letter start with
so now I gotta get these nails done
before I go out for angel his birthday
tonight
