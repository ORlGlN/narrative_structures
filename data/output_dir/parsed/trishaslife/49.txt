you guys this is the view we woke up to
this morning uh we slept with the
windows open might have been a little
cold but so amazing all right guys
today's the day I have a crazy outfit on
but I want to reveal when we actually
get to the place well my outfit is and
then you guys are gonna be like Trish
you are ridiculous I have to remind
myself I am almost 30 years old but
point of all this is you are never too
old
you can always act like a little Kim and
people have a problem with it then
that's their problem because I'm
actually loving this right now it's like
my mom I was like I feel like a little
kid and I kind of love it I feel giddy I
feel excited I know people are gonna be
like giving me stares and probably being
mean but I don't know the place we're
going they won't but we're in the city
right now and we had to walk down to get
an uber and through a bougie Lobby so
I'm sure there's gonna be stairs just
like there was yesterday when I was in a
sports bra leggings in the middle
December but whatever man he just got to
own it no my mom said because I was at
that I'm like wait what if the East
Coast doesn't dress in costume for compa
that I'm sure they do but I was like a
what-if and then we just show up it's
like when Elle Woods was the bunny and
they said with a costume party and it
wasn't she just kind of owned it so
that's what I'm worth to do that's what
we're gonna do I'll show you my mom's
off at my up when we get there but we're
dressed right now and it's it's kind of
crazy all right guys we are on our way

there
in the backpack car back guarantee mr.
Bober
and I didn't thought this was the most
expensive I Karen took a bunch of kendo
stuff in it and it really didn't end of
it but I happened to turn the switch so
that I sometimes plays eldan so anyways
that piece is a really popular on eBay
on YouTube and I'm scared too didn't
even invite me to get that snake one
time so I miss a dollar so I don't think
they was not in front operatic illusion
okay the first thing it looks like
they'll tell me what is
oh my god that's so funny and the
readers
so funny
so the 3d fit green with the math
I don't know what I would
people popped in here that's gonna be
the case
okay never get this day English
and our trip through
doing a live of us watching
Oh
perhaps like this
it's like Donkey Kong and
Mario Luigi
Yoshii
I love
because we got a luncheon Zelda the
green
then we have
oh it's a Pokemon bug
yeah I like to get you
edit know it's a little like kind of
junky stuff I'm not gonna worry
a foam replica of a council no it's a
replica as a foam and then we have an
eraser Oh mom or socks though Mario we
go with that and then an air freshener
treasure chest okay and then I'm gonna
make my boxes up for you honestly that's
my 8 bucks on this bar I mean you could
get a console for $80 or I'm gonna flip
flop and I got a plastic top hit him up
even if this was my Game of Thrones
thing and I got one stuff though I don't
know if I'd be that excited about it
the box is the coolest part I know so I
guess you're spending eighty bucks for
the box and walking around with it it's
time to be happy
wasn't worth it I don't know but we
should show actually while we're filming
fill a little bag thinking that work
policy
yeah
first off Monson secretive and
it's another one oh it's I think there's
different syntax I think in some way
really
oK we've got some more the race Batman
be there super weird and it'll look like
I got dementia
I'll see there was some wind
even Batman's in this one yeah
well all your clothes aren't here your
scarves that you're like it
what have those
three men on that one miss all Superman
like
well we have your mystery boxes we can
put some of that in oh that's true we
can throw this in a mystery box I wonder
woman's that guy wasn't better than the
next you guys yeah better stuff for your
back yeah now obviously there's delays
planes snow stuff I just haven't seasons
the only one that is delayed which
really sucks because a couple things
he's here what he's doing the group
photos and everything first then at 7:00
and 7:30 is doing the autograph see in
the photos but there's no longer VIP
it's all general mission all groups at
one time so it's really no point
Osuna dollars per ticket we bought four
of these sets 1215 thing so we're trying
to go get a refund no one knows pretty
much anything no one's telling us exact
things and we already watching it's for
our show tonight and that's five hundred
dollars wasted just frustrating but
hopefully look it with something there's
to Aquaman's behind us
that wasn't the yeah that was a good one
oh he's over there
it looks like it yeah or he's just
there's like a look like not as big but
so I really want to be Jason obviously
we want to stay until 7:00 but if it's
all general monsieur and try and get a
refund on the VIP it's not a big deal
it's just money not a huge deal but it's
frustrating because it's not only losing
out of money for the VIP off our show
tonight
it's really sad but hopefully it'll be
worth it if we get to meet and this will
be really sad if we don't even meet him
after all this they said anything rowdy
and is definitely company which is good
it's just crowded and chaos and this is
so unorganized but we did find out this
is the first ace comic-con ever so we're
gonna go up now I'm gonna see if they
same we need a recess so update there we
stood in the roof on I know we Stern the
refund line stand we asked for a higher
time render because he here refund VIP
you can only do single autographs or
single photos and I can do it's
partially but she's like no we don't see
well bus service is there manage talk to
he's like no and I'm like so we're out
talking and we don't get to be VIP and
we don't get to meet him and we also
have a general admission I was like this
is so crazy so we have a really nice
security guard that's like helping us
but he's just asking these info booth
people which they're not how much help
either we've gone to all the booths in I
don't know we don't know what to do I
guess take the loss and just stand in
the general mission wall I know I this
is our source or an unorganized I
emailed them about the photo op days
prior and they never even lose maximum
he's I just email customer service and
they never booked it so if we don't get
a refund today I'm either gonna dispute
it or just
but asses usually work they'll be like
she checked in you know what I mean like
just that's what we're documenting it
it's like is that it to my bacon
that would be worth it like I said if we
got to meet umbrellas like general
admission so we spent like an extra two
hundred dollars per ticket for nothing
I don't blame him I blame is Comic Con
we found out some information the shoot
brothers being on this event is named
Arab and Steven Sheamus said Sheamus
they are posting on Instagram with two
celebrities so they're here we need to
talk to them because oh really a photo
and I would even need a refund but also
I get that everyone wants a photo so I
even want to refund before you
disappeared so would you go on their
Instagram said they were posting on
Instagram track them down I'm so
frustrated and
so annoying but at least the people
around this whole event is our here
we came all this way work on so we're
going to try and say
no one's a very helpful
not 45 we lost out on a $5
to get time for Broadway run
really really
I'm tired my feet are killing me I kind
of don't know all this
I feel like walking on it
no one's helpful they're saying he's
signing autographs Evan
two of our passes from us we didn't get
a full refund for those two passes
they're just really
all right
I don't care so much about it especially
facer or like work from bidding and
honestly I can carry on
they should bring on through if they're
going to knock no longer honor European
descent one journal omission which is
fine I don't care
you know like the worst day
it's not big deal you know
so when you haven't seen like that IP is
not a bit feel like I'm gonna wake up
tomorrow and be like whatever yeah
nothing I looked over them I'm happy
today sorry I try and be careful who's
no one else laws would be nothing a bad
day
that they would like to be it
out here
so I don't know if fishing world's gonna
be in the bath day tomorrow my throat is
Mike tickets for
you know because really anywhere
No
and we have to insert with captions
dear I don't know
guy was like and I don't have any
napkins so stop crying or something like
that
they will like these so everyone's at
all and they will get partial refund but
nothing in the behavior of her badges
- gone and obviously delays or delays in
the site with the sonic onslaught what
if there is
I'm sorry and I'd get back for sure the
lichens are gonna mix it
like you're the first Birds autographs
and you
first
which for me like that super fit and is
work that actually running but not
everybody
kind of us really common
there's a really cool stranger things
that are over there
great in a muscle break
and you
230 over wood
anxiety
lucky of me
I mean
I'm in a better mood I was ok so crazy
story so where are the city okay
yeah what time is it it's 3:30 yeah 3:45
crazy story so we were sitting we were
sitting downstairs like in that little
area and I'm like he's not gonna put her
up to 7 o'clock and the autograph this
was around 7:00 7:30 we didn't know this
lady we had happen to sit next to while
we were waiting first time around stamps
comes to us and she has to dress me
Jason we're like no Chuck he's up there
signing right now keep in mind by the
way did you think to get up those stairs
there's an escalator no one else is
running
okay so the ladies like and so anyways
we're down here this is upstairs
opposite there was people on escalators
getting their strollers up it was
crowded nobody was on the stairs I never
take this here I've never even the
stairs my life I know I'm sprinting and
then so we get in mine I see him I'm
shaking it this way my mom's right there
she's on so I'm pulling the beer and the
things I'm like ooh I wouldn't give a
camper out because he was like where my
mom is he was like right there and
that's like oh and I don't have the
camera out because he gave me a break
and hug him out from behind it was to
give anyone else a hug he gave me a
freaking hug
we got ya this signed which can't really
help and then my mom let me get for her
autograph my Khal Drogo it was so nice
and he came around and hugged me and he
think we're a Nellie oh it was oh my god
because he was so tall my dad took his
ways and like I wouldn't my head like on
his on his chest I mean okay I know this
is that way because if you were to see
me the look before this I'm miserable
I'm miserable but like and that made me
so happy this is why I am a little
what's that word bipolar schizophrenic I
don't know something because
that hug made me so happy I wanted to
cry even his little lady was so nice
like a little person so nice she was
these girls are crazy she was wowed he's
like look at her outfits I've also back
is I didn't let my mom talk I'm like
taking up the whole time I was like
sorry but we have so it's at 7:00
that's the least we should probably be I
said well well we're gonna wait down
there we were just chilling down there
drinking beer eating M&Ms I was like and
then I don't know how she came down my
god so anyway we should probably hang
out the photo op area so we don't miss
that wow it's so excited about the time
it was really weird and I don't even
remember what I said I like blackout
this is what happens to me when I meet
who I love I like okay I don't remember
what I said I know I said something like
I'm 30 and this is embarrassing or like
I don't like I don't know what I said I
I said I cosplay as you everyday which I
didn't mean to say I'm gonna say like I
cosplay as you from Game of Thrones and
it made me say yes
oh now my battery's dying of course this
anyways I don't know what I said we're
gonna go wait downstairs see if we get
the photo-op now in three hours I don't
know what's waiting to come but I hopped
him and I wish we just it wasn't fast
enough I wonder my mom could have the
camera or something that was a moment no
one else got I was so excited oh well
that was good we'll have Pelican right
now
next up the problem we have
Trisha
so I guess it's you guys deliberate
we'll bring out everybody from the big
group right let's bring them all back
stage
yeah go back up
all right that's the body issues we
might have to push you in and do a
couple runs
Wow this is pretty amazing
and universe
so I thought we found a little less
Superman but I think we got Riddler yeah
yeah yeah
thank you that I don't know I don't want
I don't want to be judged I just wanted
to do it
I died
so my mom's out there blogging for me so
funny
so everything
we killed it
everyone just kidding thank you Jeff or
share I love that I love it
yeah
which one No hi again Warren Jason um I
said I think a little success because no

next rant is why it was in there a
female winner and this thing did my
battery to my camera died where is it
showed a lot I went up there no one's
here and I was like why or anybody it
was dad so I was like I'll just go up

pageant
so
and we're damp though but if you never
know alright we gotta go see Jason well
was ready for us yeah wait actually in a
photo op I'm back at my Loeb manic I'm
so tired my fear and mockery
I don't know I'm over my shirt
it was so sweet
we got the three P's they honored them
all my mom had one too sweet for totally
honored them all he was so sweet he
posted three different poses he could it
be some easy and when we went up because
we met him for the autograph and we told
him from LA we went up he's like la when
he knew I was like it's so quick it goes
so fast but honestly I get it cuz he's
Jason Momoa as Aquaman Justice League I
get that it has to go fast but oh my god
like he squeezed me in the very first
moment can find it I know this is about
to die like the very first one he just
gave me like the biggest hog in the
picture like my daddy Jason Momoa it was
I'm not gonna lie I can plain a lot and
there was a rich but we got it I'm happy
overall would I do it again yeah I don't
know if I would do it again I think I
would just I charge at this moment will
say that way well now I know we flew in
just for this which it was said you want
to go on oh I did you're switching side
you would okay this is good
yeah I'll come on the side without me
