my nails I'm looking like this oh my
gosh I'm gonna go crazy a shower can be
hair done today so it's kind of like up
it was bunting I actually look a little
crazy oh my god oh my gosh hmm he's like
an abundant I call me mean down this has
been like me xanax
anyone else done finally it's been
that's until along with the other day I
don't even not like three weeks
I got my nails done and my hair they
start taking care of myself you guys I
haven't eating a little more poppy
pieces of shrimp last night
okay yeah I made arrangements dance
your day or two with this girl that I
know through my videographer who doesn't
take me film finance videos and trash
and that's giving me some motivation to
you know kind of get myself together and
like look good for it and stuff um
dancing makes me feel like really good
and just it gets out some sort of like
negativity so I'm not going to do like
the partnering with guys or anything
like that I'm just I'm going to have a
girl do the choreography and I teach it
to me and have her maybe dancing it to
for another reason just to express
myself and to get my mind off things and
to get myself motivated to look good in
the sense like I don't want to let
myself fully fall apart which is what
I've been doing lately um
sirens that's coming straight C I don't
know what I'm gonna do with my um meals
oh my god I guess I look crazy I need
some like social thing I was terrifying
but I guess so I could be a little
terrified right now to you that's giving
me anxiety I blogged in a while but last
night I check him just like a little
break um till I clear my head and like
breathing things and everything which I
knows if it's been helping or not it's
just I don't know I just feel like this
is what I like to do is vlog and at it
and like upload like I like to do that
it gives me purpose and
yeah so I mean you know I'm still scared
of like the unknown
I've known mutual friends I say that
loosely like mutual people that mean
this person I've had some issues with
has talked to me you guys know nothing
about say that he detects back and talk
about like works that he's doing this
week so at least he's got that's all the
water jars that I've heard from him they
said he texted me this and says they
asked about me he's not texting so at
least he's okay he seemed good is that
alga like doing you know saying what he
was doing and stuff so at least I think
he's good I mean so I don't I don't know
at least okay I was just worried that
about a lot of things but anyways
so at least he is alive and well and
working an engineering life which is
what I'm going to do because what other
