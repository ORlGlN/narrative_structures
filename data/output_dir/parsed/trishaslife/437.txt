so we are intending again and we are
going to be Delaware it races it's my
first time betting on a horse
I already thinked it by the name and
it's something dollar signs and it's a
pink horse and I feel like it's gonna
win the odds are not great my brother
told me but I think it's gonna win
racetrack not the racetrack
oh yeah that's what I gotta do
so yeah all right target dress not
leaking ANSI today and a hot mess but
that's okay not through a chopper to
gate nacho so scissor is trapped I mean
so my money's on two and three about 40
bucks
we didn't all in the first race but
we're gonna bet one more come on Tiger
race
I'm just gonna pick one miss see if I
have any longer
Oh
I get why people don't like white people
they're so pretentious here like
