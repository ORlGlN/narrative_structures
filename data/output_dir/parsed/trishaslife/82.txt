I think good morning guys I am going to
be trying out my ex essentia Rihanna
foundation I am super excited I'm gonna
be trying out all the new products I got
this before yesterday like a first
impression to 24 hours sort of thing not
sponsored just so everyone's doing this
and I actually just like want to do it
because I'm doing my makeup and I
thought why not so I've been using the
Kat Von D lock-it foundation I don't
know which applies the Beauty Blender or
like a foundation brush my hearts on my
Beauty Blender let me go get a fresh one
I don't know about you but whenever I
use a new fresh product I want to use a
fresh like brushes monthly brush type
brush I just clean on the other day but
just clean your Beast lenders with like
make it brush cleaner - I know they have
specific painter for I'm gonna put some
kids are like I'm so distracted um I
know they make I haven't even used this
yeah that's I can't uh it was pretty
thick so I have to like be oh well you
can see that is like
I'm super thick I love it you never need
a lot is my forehead it's not that
discoloration there which was going with
bleaching cream but I feel like there's
an underlying issue there
I love how full coverage this is because
I did try this out yesterday do this
kind of work too because I'm gonna kind
of a hurry its own like taking more time
with it or anything I have a big face to
it so if it seems like a museum a lot
it's like I don't have it really um I
don't even look concealer on
we're gonna do another layer this is
like just the first layer but it does
cover nice cuz my skin is just so crazy
right now and I know I'm backlit - so
you're not seeing the full lighting but
I'll take you guys out good lighting to
see him I literally do my makeups over
half these days like I'm still like a
wreck I got a little concealer I love it
kind of worn concealer but this is
really thick as well
I just need such a little amount of this
but the stuff goes a long way I can't
look more in this mirror
eyes are still like tiny about like open
my mouth a bit underneath it
well this is actually really like about
how I speak a little nuts oh hi hi
under-eye concealer we are here to play
today scene right now
hi so where is Trish I really do think I
might owe me a cup just honestly just
juice my for tie game right now so
oh you know I'm trying to raise the
clock
Kelly honest cuss luckily my makeup
routine is very short these days with my
eyelash extensions but I also kind of
like a boy the back of my hair is super
cool okay not a bad way but just like
you know I'm not used to it kind of way
you know I mean because obviously it's
look I'm going for
hmm
we're gonna do one more round of
foundation I'm gonna sign it with the
Rihanna Fenty powder too
she was love the thickness of this
and also dries I don't know if you guys
can tell but I could tell one day she'd
add support it also drives at different
colors so if you are gonna color swatch
it Sephora if you're doing it yourself I
honestly would recommend like waiting a
couple like a minute and then looking at
the color because it did change like the
first one she put on me was perfect for
my skin and then it changed kind of
orangeade on me so it will change
before hatchery that go away
girl you know I want your love he'll
know hmm I didn't spot conceal at all
I drank with my forehead she over here
lying it open on top no this is like it
looks so good I like - my concealer that
are you fucked up I know it's hard to
guys like see the color right now but
it's looking good I am going to do the
setting powder underneath my eyes as
well I just use the banana colored one
off the next one to set my under eye
concealer oh I
Wow this brush that's super why did I
get super hard
oh man you guys I'm telling you rushing
to get ready
I sell just fully my eyelashes thank you

I've been shedding a lot to which I
don't know I got to do more to that
button blotting powder you know this is
blotting powder and I think maybe
they're just oh so blah I'm just gonna
try it out really
I'm not setting powder blotting powder
and mostly use if you're getting like
shiny so I'm kind of going a little
crazy with the powder
t-zone my cheeks Hunter a little bit
quickly these are the brushes I got at
noon use them on that day and love them
so much
so now we're looking like a face
so guys aren't higher up you don't I do
just cuz I like blending with that brush
I feel like a fluffy brush and kinda
just like blend it honestly you should
probably use the blotting

no technique whatsoever and his chunk as
much makeup on my face a short amount of
time okay I want to use this new
peaches-and-cream one I got the ginger
peach with the third over my really see
