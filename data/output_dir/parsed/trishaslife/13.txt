learner in this place
you guys and this ends another vlog end
this vlog
especially if has this vlog was the vlog
where me and Jason decided we were
officially dating is that at the
ice-cream place Carmela's in los angeles
it's like in the West Hollywood area
which was so yummy and so good and it
was honestly like the sweetest like date
night day / night in my whole entire
life in fact any relationship I've ever
been in that was like the sweetest like
you know I feel like I've never had a
relationship where I just feel like very
no I wouldn't say comfortable so I
usually pretty comfortable myself become
cool and the other person we're like I
don't I don't say it like I don't worry
I feel like this vlog I do seem like I'm
kind of like insecure
I haven't to hear when homes
relationships but it's the first one I'm
like not worried about it because he's
like such a good guy and also it's the
first one where I feel like it's like so
comfortable as if like we were like we
are related or you know mean like it
just feels like like we went home and
watch The Bachelor that's like we knew
favorite but that was like we randomly
went on The Bachelor we're like this is
our new favorite thing to watch now
together because it's like so fun to
watch it with him and then like it's
just so ridiculous that you know is as
jason says he lost use of swords silly
it's so silly it's just so like I
haven't watched it a really long time
and it was like really fun I just came
home and chilling on the couch after
dinner it was just like uh to me that's
like the relation of always wanted where
you don't always have to you know weed
you do a lot obviously this week we vlog
but it's not something where you like
always to be entertained or if like I
don't know we got to worry about this
other person's gonna be bored or they
don't want to be there or they'd rather
be at a club like every relationship
like I feel like the person always
wanted to be somewhere else
which is like we were when I think back
at it I'm like one boyfriend always
wanted to be like out at clubs and
another you know wanted to be it just it
feels so nice to just to feel like we're
just content and happy like watching The
Bachelor like our favorite thing to do
at night I just watch like Jimmy Kimmel
like oh we go actually he flips through
all the different late night shows like
during commercial we were like a
different one
and I love that so much like it's the
best way to fall asleep like uh it's
just so nice to be like comfortable so
like this is the night that he's on this
vlog that literally like I like changed
my whole life and like look on
relationships
it just felt sweet and right and just
normal I just felt normal is it felt
like relaxed and just easy and I feel
like I've never had a relationship it's
just easy and I think people do I when I
talked a lot about the comments in this
vlog too I think a lot of people may
take that out of context where I was
like that's how I dictate my life I mean
it does affect me I'm not gonna lie and
I just decided like I can't really read
comments as much I could read the first
like hour and then that'd be it but you
know I am pretty I was a lot more secure
after that night and like figuring it
all out like I was a lot more secure in
what we were and I made me feel happy
because I was like you know insecurities
and I need that affirmation and that
reassurance and all that stuff so it
worked out really really well thank you
guys for all the love and support on our
official announcement cuz I this was
before we obviously filmed it announced
it and so thank you guys for all the
love and congratulations it's so funny
and once I congratulate I feel like we
got married we did it
I mean but you know making something
official is a big deal to me because um
very few people like I mean I had one
relationship that like they were like
yeah we're official we're not dating
anyone else like I but this is like but
even that was kind of like is this real
you know what I mean this one I feel
like is my first one that it's like
solidified that it's like confirmed that
like both people are in it and it makes
me really happy and anyways that's it
guys enjoyed this vlog and I'll see you
guys in the next well there's nothing
like is he's for elevator shoes
