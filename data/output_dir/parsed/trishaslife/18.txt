all right this is so fucking Gorge wet
them what is it Marriott now they're
we're standing on a place where like
people can get
yeah we took a cab our hotels literally
the way I mean looks far in this camera
for some reason but today you're finally
gonna go swim with the turtles are you
so soaked I'm so stoked pretty excited
oh yeah I'm going to change his ego so
excited and our friends that we might
hear told us that there might be
stingrays but we're kind of nervous
about yeah and people have been dying we
watch the news yesterday and like ten
people died no snorkeling accent people
died snorkeling in the last two weeks I
don't know if that's a high number or a
low number four I don't know actually
really scary um yeah so we're gonna see
that we're here early that I said
yesterday like we were out there I was
like don't go near the rocks you were
like what I said yeah I agree with you
yeah I don't get hit we're stacking
right shit on the rocks
okay fell over ten times I don't know
how I survived that confuse I'm a baby
so this is everything this is like so
open here though like if we go in the
middle like if we kayak out to the
middle it's gonna be so cool
I'm so excited okay you can go run oh I
wonder if does this go down our hotel if
I knock it does we could have walked we
should walk home yeah I'm down the
sidewalk goes all the way down
how'd you know he could've been running
every morning no but then again we're
pretty active so I guess we got enough
work out
people look very active here
guys update
we're going with the turtles
tonight kayak out
the water with soup chopping my theory
is we were the only two so if I make a
private tour leave a little puppy it
wasn't crazy but because you put the
fear of God in us if you I've been dying
Bruce never afraid iam tomorrow we leave
tomorrow

Turtle Beach our taxi driver said it

we're gonna see if we can see some
turtles it'd be true it on this way hit
around that way
besides using turtle team turtle
yeah you could look to see if they're
there and if they're there then go

they're looking at the turtle
oh my god as a full beach
something different yeah this is really
different
Peter waves over on this side ever not
the Banger is that what it is
we
those are Turtles Jason

you're also with me by association so it
turn their pie like wow that's some
freaky people right there guilty

dumb because you know nude beaches

happened people just keep it's more
human name in LA I leave you can we
learn la vaque it's this new Beach which

how do you find your
Adamic I think it's weird I think it's
you're so crazy that you want to do this
Hey oh there's the tower I just left
towers and whoo look so cool
I think the worst thing about going out
adjacent is like you just go up to
people and like ask them like he has a
lifeguard to be like he's like doing
kayvyun a picture with us why bars like
no I'm working like youtuber in an
Instagram where no one just like lives
their life to be in our Instagram

flowers you just wait more for me than I

Pacific show and allow now we've got a
wonderful show for you tonight as we
take a tour throughout Polynesia but
more than anything else this is a
Hawaiian Aloha and that is a very
special celebration of my body this is
much more than just the Hawaiian party
that's easy enough
you want to know how well you've got to
put some things into it we do it the way
the ancient hawaiians did the first
thing they did when they were gonna have
a luau
they got
they're both on them and that became the
way to celebrate a luau with your family
in Hawaiian never you are here with your
cuz here's the tradition that makes a
little of special here in Hawaii we
gather for a little no matter what we're
celebrating we gather as one big family
one big one that everybody's related and
each of us celebrated don't introduce
yourself
you take energy week and everybody
that's gonna do that book on the feeling
the greeting sorry and now I'm sorry
Rosa listen I was distracting you too
