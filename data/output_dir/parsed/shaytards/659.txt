the most the biggest reason why people

anymore
that's good guys you have good taste
she's gonna come to Idaho though I'll
visit of course I'll be lucid my heart
will break and crumble and I'll die and

general consensus of your overall life

Toys R Us store for about four I managed
to get it down to a couple of things
hey why don't you tell her a big thank
you and give her a big hug and a kiss
first oh hey oh I love you so much
quit wiping the kisses off you could you
want to open the card first
let's traditional into it you have to
act like you like the card and before
you get to the presence that's the
toughest part about being a kid you have
to like oh that's a nice car that
requires acting but I know you can do it
right how many of you have open to
presents like only get open the card
first like oh that's so sweet don't let
me see what the president
I feel like I like the cards will be
like when someone says something
meaningful in a card I almost don't know
where what what gifts they could write
even if it was yeah stickers you can
make your own cake that's how CEO look
you put the stickers on the cake and
then you can put the candles in the cake
and that's four candles cuz you're four
and then you can decorate the case what
do you say yeah yeah that's a nice kv-1
