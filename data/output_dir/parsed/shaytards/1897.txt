yeah we don't expel it no you guys know
that some people don't eat meat are they
bad people yes they're not it's actually
really healthy to not eat meat listen
you guys know what our bodies are made
of yeah do you know what our bodies are
made up of 75% of our body is made out
of water
what else are made out of 75% water
fruits and vegetables that type fruits
and vegetables are so good for us
because they're made of 75% water what
the earth is also 75% water or such okay
so if we feed our bodies all of these
things what
Watto stay Religulous those centaur can
you read us your word let's see
obedience yes I was your say let's see a
little paper let me see what it says it
says kindness oh that's good pretty
start can you see what's yours service
what does service mean what does it mean
when we do service for others it means
we help others son hard you know service
the Lord is true who else can we serve
oh yeah I remember that sometime
remember when you made mom and dad's bed
and we didn't even ask you to do it you
just wanted to surprise us to make our
bed and clean our room
that's called service right baby card
what did you have kindness you have
kindness it's backwards around girls
what is kindness mean I know it's upside
to talk do you know what kindness means
what does it mean to be kindness what do
you know what means to be nice to
somebody did it I don't know can you be
nice to Cooper knowing you and Cooper
fight sometimes can you be nice to
Cooper and show him love but we can
still be nice unkind to him huh
wait wouldn't I get weight loss
I got honesty you guys know what honesty
means you don't honesty mean what are
your parents doing give the worst
parents ever okay listen
honesty means telling the truth no
matter what sometimes it's hard to tell
the truth because you're afraid you're
going to get in trouble or you're afraid
that somebody's gonna be mad at you but
sometimes honesty is the best policy
that's what a president said once always
well yeah did I say sometimes unless
unless you don't want to give away
Christmas presents yeah then we then we
can justify the line all right mama tart
Garden oh what a perfect one for you it
seems like this thing was like rigged
just like go through that for the
dramatic effect whoa okay guys let's be
irreverent let's calm down listen to
mommy kind to each other now
what about if we
okay if we're just looking at this food
doesn't do us any good yeah you know we
talk about the food and learn about what
horses just like you know it is a food
or if we just not does that help us at
all yeah
are you gonna be are you gonna be full
if you just look at this food and don't
eat it yeah say you're really hungry
like oh I'm so starving Marvin man okay
you guys we've sat around this food now
for about five minutes we smell that
we've looked at it we're all done let's
go to bed you guys ready can't touch it
did we are we full yet or was still
hungry yeah we're still hungry yes we
haven't eaten it yet right so we have to
eat the food for it to do us any good
and that's just like our spirits we have
to do these things
we can't just learn about them and talk
about them we actually have to do them
for them to do as good does that make
sense you guys we have to actually do
the things we have to be obedient and do
we just talk about being good people on
being kind and obedient service or do we
actually do it all right
we have to actually do it okay does that
make sense to you guys so I have to feed
both our body our mind and our spirit we
have to actually do the things
so let's from now on we'll just try to
do what's right
I guess know what that means to do
what's right all right okay let's be
kind to other people let's be obedient
and let's do service do you guys

those toys for those kids in California

with those toys who'd we give them to
remember where do we take them little
kids yeah we're yeah you remember that
Sun tire Dave ATAR because remember we
check those twice to the fire station
