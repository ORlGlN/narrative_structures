hi login here hey guys so I'm in target
and I'm trying to find three items on my
shopping list
I need eye drops baby wipes that's what
happens when you don't make a list
oh hey she's that funny yeah I know it's
like I know what it's like to have fish
drop in the Storify your child because
that's the best store food is those
little goldfish okay
wipes we're in the baby section that's
my mic so problem that I have with
something guys is I like to browse yes
okay I have to make a list and I have to
tell myself stick to the list because I
like to browse and then I find all sorts
of things that I want to bring home
instead of just what I'm here for here's
the way so what I'm doing is I'm gonna
use you guys to help me stick to the
list I don't remember the list is but I
only have like 15 minutes it's only 20
minutes to buy stuff so here's what time
it is for 47 and when I check out I'm
going to have you guys look at the clock
again to make sure that I'm not taking
too long in the source
it's a whole Valentine section of old
pink red chocolate I'm not browsing guys
i this was on my list I promise it's so
fun going shopping this is I don't know
what I do I just like get lost in just
aisles and aisles of stuff and it's not
even like stuff that I need or or
necessarily even want it's just fun like
oh look at this oh no a little kids
kicking Oh before you know it it's like
two hours has gone by and I'm like okay
it's not that bad guys I am really
exaggerating here oh but I do like
shopping especially because Valentine's
Day is coming up what are you guys gonna
do for Valentine's Day do you have a
special somebody if you don't you should
still do something nice for your family

little Valentines
and leave them on our pillows when we go
home from school so we would see them

the funnest boy Valentine's okay

it I've gotten to the point where I
don't mind like vlogging myself talking
on the camera walking through a store
it's still a little bit funny but I'm
not really shy doing it anymore
however I still have a hard time if
somebody said something to me like
turning the camera on somebody cuz I'm
like oh what if you don't wanna be
filmed what have you know I have our
time still turning the camera on
somebody in public when I'm vlogging but
anyways I am NOT in the section that I'm
supposed to be in oh crap
