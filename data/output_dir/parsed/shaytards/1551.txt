I'm gonna try my backflip I told you
guys before that I used to could do a
backflip on skis when I wasn't such a
big skier but I'm gonna try it on this
run and I hope I don't break anything
I'm nervous about these skis popping off
for some reason in midair that the video
didn't tune them right because these are
rentals so hopefully they stay on my
feet that's always a fear when you're 12
feet up in the air and you don't have
skis on all of a sudden just don't hit
them together bro yeah that's the truth
