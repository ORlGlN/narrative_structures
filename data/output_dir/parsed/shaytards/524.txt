I woke up with a giant headache and a
lot of this happening out of my nose so
I think I might have a sinus infection
this little boy still is not better but
he is still cuter than ever
he likes lots of bath times like bad
times yeah today is one of those days
where typically I don't really let
comments get to me but in my weakened
immune state makes my emotional state
slightly weakened as well and I love the
comments get to me so yes I noticed that
my house is trashed
and that is typical for this time of
year for me because usually every year
we move and I'm trying to get settled in
a house so that has happened for the
past five six years we've moved like
every year so I am NOT going to let
those comments affect me from now on
okay I just washed all those comments
away from my brain because I'm doing the
best I can baby
