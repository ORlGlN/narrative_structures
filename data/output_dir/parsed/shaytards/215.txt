make a video on here everyday I'll tell
you what I'm doing you guys can leave in
the comments what you're gonna do
can happen one of those days you know
not in the best of moods it happens to
everybody I'm sure happens to you
which would entail me making a video
every day for the last year of my 20s
but I think back to a wise man who once
told me sure you gotta build bridges
bridges shape peaks and valleys picks
and valleys bridges brilliant to know
each other
bridges are the pathways from the peaks
skipping the valley and going to the
next peak it's just a little bridge that
you build that you say to yourself you
know what I'm not gonna be in a bad moon
this is a happiness saw oh look at this
happiness board I'm gonna cut this board
of my happiness off now I have a board
I'm gonna build it as a bridge I need
some more tools I'm going down to my
happiness toolshed I'll be right back
this is really getting personal I want
this to be personal should I do this
okay I think I'm done now um like
normally out of you know editor that
part out like when I went down but I
this is I hope this works
okay bye
