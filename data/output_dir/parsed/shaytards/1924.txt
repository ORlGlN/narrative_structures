in the CD years have seen a CD this
window right here is in the background
in the picture of the CD you see baby
tard up in the air and then you see this
house in the background with this tree I
thought it'd be interesting to go and
knock on the door and ask who lives in
that top right room and then to go see
that person and show them the James
Blunt CD and be like did you know that
your room is on hundreds of thousands of
these CDs all over the world and that
person see what that person said about
it anyways we're here to do a few

interesting maybe well maybe we'll do
that later we'll go talk to that person
