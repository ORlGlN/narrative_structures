crazy watching them grow up
hey listen I want to say SAFF you words
of apology about the recent moms view
video you know if you watch the recent
Romsey video we're talking about there
was a question that said what if your
kids don't want to have kids and in
classic obnoxious not thinking about
other people's feelings shaycarl style i
go off on this rant about how everybody
should have kids and if you don't want
to have kids you're a bad person because
you're not you know you know making the
species continue and you know I'm an
idiot and I only sometimes say things
from my own perspective and so as I'm
sitting there saying all these things
like you should have kids you should
have kids
my poor sister and her husband who are
trying really hard to have kids my poor
sister that's all she wants in the world
is to have a baby and she's like
frustrated that she can't and Here I am
saying everybody should have kids and
I'm blessed enough to have five healthy
kids so listen I'm an idiot sometimes
sometimes when you're on a talk show you
feel like you have to be like
controversial or something and I
apologize for that so if anybody was
offended I like I'd like to say sorry
and I am a rude jerk anyways I'll put a
link below or maybe I won't because I
don't want you to go see me be an idiot
but I'm gonna ask you to click on
