attitude will not be tolerated in this
club to the showers hey I love you oh
thank you
hey guys okay
so today I have made it my goal to get
some pictures up on the wall I know I've
been here for what like two and a half
years more than that maybe I'm horrible
I can never like I get these specific
things in my mind or I can't quite
figure out what specifically I want and
I'm just not willing to just throw
anything up on the walls because anytime
you put a nail in the wall that's
commitment or you have to putty it out
and paint it over anyways do I really
need to go through the whole OCD
conversation with myself to you guys
anyway so I tell you some pictures today
that's what I meant to say so I got this
done check that one out what do you guys
think - like it is just Shea and I it
looks a little uneven but like I majored
it to the end of the dresser but maybe I
should have measured it - there I'm
gonna ask Shea his opinion see what he
thinks but like if you stand over here
doesn't it look I mean okay don't look
messy part yes it's a mess but oh here
what do you guys think anyways who cares
what you think
cuz it's up on the wall and that's
Milo's not you guys you always can't
kiss him hi IKEA anyways and that one
we're getting about that time of year
where it's time to take some more
pictures hmm are we doing the calendar
this year babe I don't know if we are
but I want to get some pictures either
way okay I'm gonna show you what my
other project is okay I forgot to show
you I got this one up on the wall to do
this like that it's like a really
colorful elk I think it's beautiful and
it matches our our bathroom colors like
the blue and the DAP color of the sink
