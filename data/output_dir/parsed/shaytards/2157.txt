state of Utah that's all see you guys
yeah Shay Carl has a warrant for his
arrest in the state of Utah so every
time we drive through Utah I'm like oh
gotta be careful should I tell you why
here just leave it hanging out there
five years ago I was working we lived in
Logan Utah and I was working for a
Granite Company and I was doing a job I
was pulling a granite trailer there was
the company truck was the company truck
the company trailer I was driving to
Salt Lake to go do a granite job and
apparently right here on this stretch of
freeway on the i-15 there's like a
quarter mile you're not allowed to be
pulling a trailer in the left lane
and I had no idea there's like some
obscure signs like for the next 103
point 7 feet you cannot pull a trailer
at the left lane
I've never seen a sign like that so I'm
pulling the trailer I pack I go to pass
somebody and I get pulled over and he
gives me a ticket for having a trailer
in the left lane I was like I wasn't
talking about those trailers all over
and look at all these big trucks pulling
trailers anyways so I got a ticket it
was like a $60 ticket and my boss is
like oh we'll take care of it you know
we're gonna paid whatever so I kind of
just forgot about it and stopped working
there we move went somewhere years later
we get a call from the United from Utah
something city ordinances I shake Carl
there yeah this is him yeah we just like
to inform you there's a warrant out for
your arrest
because you haven't paid this ticket
that got like $300 and I was like what a
warrant for my arrest it was like a
stupid trailer ticket and I'm like yeah
what you haven't paid it so there's a
warrant for your arrest in the state of
Utah just like great and at the time we
don't have money to pay for it so I was
like can we just make payments on it and
I'm like sure and then we still haven't
made payment
I would like to see what it's up to now
so if I get pulled over I don't know if
they're gonna take me in or what it's
just a little fact I have a warrant for
my arrest exciting let's just not do
anything about it till it comes back to
bite us we're not gonna do anything bad
