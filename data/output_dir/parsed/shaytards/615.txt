okay okay maybe Tartars a year but whose
butt isn't so big it's gonna weigh heavy
charge your leg
she says it's his leg it's rock tart
sick all right hey guys
Shaytards here yes and you may be
wondering why we're all sitting on the
couch together oh are you okay we want
to have a family stress family
discussion yes this is a serious moment
daddy wasn't 70 pounds overweight we can
all fit on this count all right what's
the discussion dirt smells like you
poured a gallon of Cologne Wow what's
your problem a retard huh all right
mommy turn go ahead you're in charge of
this conversation hey it is it's not a
fault it's just a concern and um I'm
putting my foot down
okay so what she puts her foot down you
do parsley sundar smells so good right
would you let me talk very good this is
the problem we're having
I could smell you doing a crocodile in
Florida could smell you yeah I can't
even to myself
what is your your your your nose hole
Austin yeah your nose holes have gotten
used to it all right
okay here's what we're doing so
we make a video everyday and how long
have we done that for a long time now
over here all I was not like I'm about
to say the f-word
what I was gonna say it's 500 over 500
days I'm not sure exactly what the case
and you know I guess a good thing but
sometimes I just want a little more
shade time for me is it selfish you're
so so so so well I came up with this
idea where we could just do one take
Sunday's that's that's the new thing so
we have a little bit more time to just
spend as a family with me and this is
right this is without not even as a
family just with David we had a talk and
she said the media just says you've been
gone well I've been gone I've been gone
I mean there's please and I hope the
people who get it the people who aren't
for lack of better words stupid
understand that we have a pretty busy
schedule and to upload a video every
single day for over 500 days it is it's
a lot of time it's a lot of pressure
it's every single day do you get the
concept of that there's no days off so
the people they're like this is your job
Shay you should do it do you have a job
that you've worked 500 consecutive days
that are they off no you haven't
so unless you milk the cows on the farm
and that's that's a daily job so if you
milk the cows on the farm videotape it
watch footage um so mommy tart has
requested me I don't wanna sound like
I'm being like basically she wants me
off the computer and she wants me
a little bit more it's not though I
don't like videos just how much time it
takes to edit and you know it is it's
time-consuming and we love it listen
don't get us wrong this is like I'm not
this is a dream come true for our family
we love doing it right guys do you guys
