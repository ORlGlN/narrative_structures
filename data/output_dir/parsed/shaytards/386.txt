that's all full and fresh and we just
put out some sweet oats and there's a
Salt Lick so they know where the sweet
spot is and the three cows that are in
where they're supposed to be they were
at the water already so like I'm not
worried about them there's two more that
are out a little farther but they're
going to come in because they're gonna
smell that water so we have five cows
and they're there they're two of them or
not where we wanted them but they're
