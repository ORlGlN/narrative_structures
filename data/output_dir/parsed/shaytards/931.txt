important one I want to make mention to
this and I've been wanting to make
mention of this like a couple weeks ago
but I didn't if you guys see a fake
Katie let account or a fake Shaytards
account making mean comments click on
the username if it doesn't take you to
our Channel and that's not us with the
infusion of Google+ people can now make
vanity name
and so people are copying our names and
then acting like it's us and leaving
really rude comments all over the place
so our accounts aren't being hacked
people are just copying our name so the
best way to find out if that's us is
click on the actual user on the picture
or the username and if it doesn't take
you to our channel and it's not us if
it's us it'll take you to our channel
page and you'll be able to see all of
our videos and stuff some people can
even like copy the channel so just be
aware of that
we're not leaving mean comments I
