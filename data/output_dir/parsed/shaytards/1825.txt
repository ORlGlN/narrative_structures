listening to me anymore
he's the show stealer
oh I said upset to vomit our backstage
whatever we do don't let rocked art fall
off the stage we'll look like bad
parents
still little catches
yeah so we I mean and thinking about the
on TV we like the freedom of YouTube
because we have control and I feel like
if we ever did a reality show on TV it
would it would get weird like they'd
want us to have some drama like mama
thar maybe Nanami and if there's one's
gonna be some drama so we like to have
the control so 572 next question where
