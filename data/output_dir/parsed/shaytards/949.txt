accidentally turned on a little reruns
of this show it's the only TV I've
watched in the last three months
probably and the new episodes on tonight
interesting show because you know how
you justify when Walt first starts to do
in this little business because you're
like oh he has cancer you know I don't
know I wanted to talk about that but I'm
not gonna talk about it what you guys
think about Breaking Bad you like it
it's good it's interesting how when it
begins you kind of justify his actions
because it's like oh yes cancer
then the more goes you like he is
definitely a bad person now yeah he is
definitely broken back and so it's like
that's it all starts in those little
things man
you can't start on the little things you
can't justify the little actions
everything
think about it if you start with the
little things like one day you decide
you screw to start cooking meth that
could lead to bigger things you know if
you do that only to bigger well I did he
murdered some people I bet you never
thought you were gonna end up killing
somebody and then melting their dead
body huh check it out it's a great TV
show for kids yeah alright my cockles
getting cold love you guys will take
Sunday we'll see tomorrow as usual
