the documentary and I basically without
making any excuses forgot to get much
vlog footage I swear to you I promise
you I will not let it happen again
I guarantee these last year of vlogs are
gonna be epic so sorry there wasn't too
much footage today but exciting news we
have been filming all day these last
couple like three four days for the
documentary I'm really excited about the
things that we're getting yesterday we
interviewed all the kids and got some
really interesting questions or I mean
answers out of each one of them that I
think are going to be really eye-opening
for this documentary and yes we are
using the kids real names in the
documentary so that's something that's
going to be crazy and even the other day
when the cameras for the documentary
crew first came over we were just using
the regular names and it was so weird to
say their real names while cameras were
rolling if you have questions about the
documentary when it's going to be out
