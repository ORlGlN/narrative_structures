for this and it's like a big imagine at
art like a tramp hanging it's blue it's
rubber
polymer and it shoots a spray a flat
line of water at 30 miles per hour up
and over it and it creates enough
friction on the bottom of your third so
you can surf that creates enough surf so
you can just ride it basically I'm
