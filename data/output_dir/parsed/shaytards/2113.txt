do a slow reveal here so I'm just
fishing
I feel like this like heavy thing on my
line and then their leaf like a fish
because it wasn't fighting but it was
really heavy so I thought oh I got a
bunch of moss I started reeling it up I
thought it was a log and look what it is
it's an elk leg and is literally like
the bottom portion of an elk cliff
those are that's the hoof and it's like
cut off right there if the joint it's so
that is like I've been fishing my whole
life and well not my I mean that is
crazy to catch an elk leg when you're
fishing Logan thinks that it's a poacher
somebody who killed an L and just cut it
up and threw it in the river to try to
hide the evidence but that is so weird

fast it's about a two hour drive and
we'll see the baby come but I have no

doesn't and I'll probably go call from a
payphone here in a while if we can find
one just in case you know I'm saying cuz
she'd be pretty mad if I was fishing
while she was having the baby hey we're
having fun
