that's a camera he's seriously smiled
every time I turn the camera on how you
say I think he likes the the flowers
that I Oh be dazzled camera no juice
there speculate why am i doing the vlog
again okay now you can all guess in the
comments below
right now ready go no it's not because
Shay was abducted by aliens though I'm
sure that may have happened at some
point or the other no it's not even
because he is in the airport all day
today it's because yup you guessed it
he lost his camera again he lost it
looked around it go oh what's in your
hair princess charge our princess
she's a pea flower yes wait was that a
question what kind of a question is that
a ballet move wait whoa whoa whoa whoa
strike that reverse it not a ballet move
it looks more like a Michael Jackson
move do it again yeah nice moves huh oh
did you notice that is my room baby
that's right this is the new addition to
the tart family do you love it
dad I I've been wanting a hutch for a
really long time and I know that sounds
so stupid to some of you like why would
you want a hutch but when you get a
house of your own you want to fill it
with beautiful things and I've always
wanted a hutch
that is what this is called right ah a
cupboard item it's the thing that you
put stuff that is pretty in oh no I do
realize that this came at a very
opportune time because Shay just
happened to be gone for a week and we
just happened to have a hutch all of a
sudden is that bad that I buy expensive
items when my husband's gone out of town
hey I have to cope in some way psycho
shopping Jay can't give Adam because I
vlogged about it just kidding
he approved I would never buy a hutch
without talking to Schafer's it did talk
to him first so I'm not a crazy wife
that just goes and spends all of her
husband's money when he's out of town
just most of it I love it
I shove it a show SHINee I'm a producer
extreme peckish Prince's hard what are
you doing wait whoa whoa she realized
right when she said it
oh I was not supposed to say that to mom
talking about whoa I just have to tell
you we just went over to our friends
house princess Hart was wild like the
most wild I've ever seen her you guys
have seen a really wild she was crazy
and you know what I think it is her to
start why are you being so crazy crazy I
love this country you have like marker
all over your face - marker
I love that your tooth is missing right
now it's chicken no you're gonna go to
bed rock hard you just want to look at
the camera like the sparkly zombie
camera he did it was like
the reason she was so crazy tonight is
because che usually wrestles with the
kids like every night he's always like
tickling them playing with him and
they've been without that for a whole
week so che come back we need a tickle
we need I'm sorry about the short video
today you guys che let me know right
before he got on his flight that he had
lost his camera and he doesn't know
where it is if he's on the plane or if
he left it at Kasim's house or somewhere
like maybe it will turn up but once
again he's going to be using mine when
he gets home I think that he just loses
his cameras on purpose because he likes
the way I'd be dazzled mine
don't you think rock card he is totally
pulling on my hair right now
ah ho that mine so the vlogs will be
back up and running tomorrow with the
whole family we're gonna be wild and
crazy and fun and AH or just really
boring it got very boring name that
movie okay I'll just tell you it's cut
all from The Little Mermaid okay okay I
think so the princess starts craziness
is starting to wear off a little bit so
