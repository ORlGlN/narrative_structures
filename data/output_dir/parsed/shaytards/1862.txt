man
hello my name is alpha and this is
honey do you know what
do you know what happens
days
what happens in 16 days
and a little over a man in my two-weeks
around you
every day for two years
to
years think of everything that we've
been through together
so much
brought a life into this world
brought a precious soul to this earth
twice watched our kids
I still watch nobody else from just even
last year it's crazy how much you can
see him grow and
figured out the baby tart can talk
that's two losers now sadness won't ever
shut up
she's really come out of her shell yota
was it was the last time was the last
trip that we went to LA we were Danny
and Lisa's house by a fire and there was
like 20 people there and baby thar had
everybody
what'd she do I think she farted really
loud and everybody got started cracking
up and she loved that she just made it
up she's like everybody's laughing and
she started saying all this craziest
stuff and then almost you can almost
tell you granny
you're almost pinpointed yeah from
that's that specific experience around
that fire that nice I know me and Robert
are looking each other like what just
happened to baby turn but ever since
that night she has totally come out of
her shell
it's crazy today is just gonna be this
this is the vlog because yesterday I was
in a coma
proportions I feel like if I was any
sicker I would be in the rapture I
to the sky
I like I'm on death
