chairlift and I said beard tard this is
your last day do you have any other last
requests and he said other than
motorboating mommy tard
the only last thing that I want the only
last thing I want is to be a trending
topic on Twitter he told me he said all

he thought if he was the first beard to
be a trending topic on Twitter that
would make his life and he would kick it
go into the night without any regrets so
