become deeper his life online you got a
brainless home for - I'm ready for a
baby also let it be clear
Thank You sloggin here
so okay we're going to swimming lessons
aka I pay somebody else to let me watch
them watch my kids swimming that's
basically how it works we go there I sit
on the bleachers and then people watch
my kids as they swim and I watch those
people watch my kids as they swim does
that make sense anybody else no that's
what we need a pool right guys right
guys amen hallelujah I think these guys
are laughing at me vlogging maybe
they're not I'm gonna see if I can get
him do away with me hey guys hi you're
on YouTube hi he doesn't want to be on
YouTube he doesn't want to be on YouTube
guys can you wave at him wait about that
dude was not happening no smiles coming
out of him what are you looking at
I'm obviously too tough
um anyway so that's another one of my
debates about why we should get a
swimming pool but you know when it all
comes down to it if mommy tart ain't
happy then nobody is happy and I know
like you know we can do the whole thing
where I you know I clean up all the pool
and we're very careful but at the end of
the day she's gonna still worry about it
so I don't I don't know I don't think
we're gonna get it just because I don't
want mommy to freak out be more stressed
out than she already is a newborn baby
and there's already
we're not five kids in our house comfort
that's five kids under the age of six
you guys that's like it's mucho stress
so vamos anyway so we can though there's
no swimming pool right here we can go
close to maybe once the baby comes and
mommy settles down a little bit we'll
get the pool but I just you know gotta
watch out for my girl you know I'm
saying dogs and watch out for your girls
I love her love peace mommy try to love
you this one's for you
there's Frankie start kicking her legs
and swimming to the side of the pool
good job there she goes get this Epping
sauna in here
I'm never green to bring the kids to
swimming lessons again Spears feel like
a hundred degrees in our diet
it's like so humid there's like no airs
telling me softly this is totally gonna
make my hair poofing babe I totally
worked all morning on straightening
it looks like he's drowning
but eerily is swimming it's an
adrenaline of faction if I just walked
into here I would think whoever that
person is is drowning but he makes it to
the other side are those Prince's tard
