things what are you doing okay so the
other day we had a picnic on the lawn
and they had so much fun that while I
was cooking dinner they started getting
stuff out of the fridge and they have
pretty much a leftover soup that's cold
my apples chippies bruised and some
sweet Hawaiian bread and it's all
delicious you guys no no no we're having
for dinner well I made a chicken move
closer it's a whole chicken with the
potatoes and carrots and celery and
onions and seasonings I've never ever
done it before and I took all the the
inner the giblets as they call them I
think and I boiled them like that's the
neck it those are for Malachi coz I'm
not even there near them anyway so we
say what you have to be the taste tester
when it's ready I only fruits and
vegetables you know that good because I
made vegetables
well I only 2/3 cooked I don't either I
only know fresh you want me to see yours
oh because I'm not wearing those I just
uploaded my Shaytards video to the
station oh so stupid he was looking at
the state he was why do some oh my down
the station then he uploaded this video
and it turns out so then I go to shake
cards to find it to like edit the stuff
but I'm like where is it it said upload
it back so then I log into the stage
and it's there just uploaded the shaders

zombies little video today and I was
putting the links in the sidebar and
stuff and so I just hit that make sure

upload because it was like three hundred
megabytes it's how to take it down and I
just set the other one to upload and I
said I'm leaving I'm gonna ride my bike
so day three it's tough basically my
goal is this I'm not gonna worry about
anything else
all's I'm gonna say to myself is that I
have to go ride my bike on the boardwalk
in every day I don't care if I eat I
don't care to drink none of that matters
I'm all of them focus on let's just get
my fat butt out here on this bike on the
boardwalk and hopefully by virtue
of that I'll start to feel better and
make smarter food choices like today at
lunch I don't have a coat I had a
lemonade instead there's a light
raspberry lemonade anyways it's just
persistence seek almost attacked me
Plus do you like my headband Vienna I
don't want to get my hat's all sweaty so
this is more function over fashion I
don't wanna get sweat in my eyes but I
don't need my hat all sweaty either

may not get me beat up I don't know whoa
