utterson there for you Cloudy with a

funny I laugh a whole time stop it
that's definitely annoying it's really
good it's really funny there's some some
smart comedy in there and there's a few
like adult jokes kind of a not totally
adult but only yeah only the grown-ups
got it was if you haven't seen you
should see it's pretty good I look her
in the eye when you say it look right
the I say yabba-dabba-doo I love you hey
princess card you got to say it back
yabba-dabba-doo I love you
good job each other anymore
the problem sounds the kids are just
fighting in the back seat and I said
okay look psycho just have to take you
guys home we'll take you in your room
and me and mom we're gonna spank each
other and I meant to say thank you guys
let's make each other I didn't come out
right
super video
yeah but the other do I love you anyway
so they're fighting so our solution is
to make them look at each other and say
yeah be nice with you I love you and it
always makes them laugh or else they
just feel stupid like I've just been
sitting here talking about trying to
remember times when we were kids and how
spoiled if we ever acted spoil those
kids like you do so much you know we
take them out to lunch we take them to
the mall we let them ride the train we
take them to a movie we get popcorn and
treats and still they want more they
were kids are the best negotiators the
world has ever seen they will ask and
ask and ask until you can give no more
literally that's a saying that I heard
is you don't ever get what you deserve
you get what you negotiate and kids are
good negotiators you got to tell him no
and I said you guys don't get anything
else today but I was thinking about when
I was kid and I just remember thinking
I'm just gonna keep asking more and more
stuff it's crazy
do you guys remember when you were kids
and your mom and dad get mad at you for
being spoiled maybe some of you do that
right now if you're like I want one I
want a new cell phone I want new school
clothes I want new shoes and you just
you just bleed them try every ounce that
they have to give you just take it don't
do that
for themselves yeah or speedom with your
battery's blue really know
