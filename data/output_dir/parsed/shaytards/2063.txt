who's delivering your pizza it said
someone so just love to deliver your
delicious piping hot pizza well it said
Skylar on the thing so I was like oh
sweet I knew it was this kid named
Skyler so I open the door and I'm like
Skylar and he goes a big hug and it was
kind of bad timing cuz these two girls
had just gotten out of the shower
what so I shout out the Skyler who had
just delivered our pizza and watches the
straight art videos I should have I was
gonna like grab the camera and film you
but half of the family was Nick
we are watching Footloose by the way on
CMT and it the preacher just announced
to the Big Dance is on and so now the
girls are dancing with their pizza is it
problems over there doing that's right
that's right in their pizza dancing
that's right and everybody is sleeping
I don't know why it's my favorite part
of the night one well maybe one because
it's quiet there's not kids Remi but
let's say most of all but I think
sincerely this is the reason why it's my
favorite part and it's something that I
enjoy a lot of times I don't always
share with you guys just this part of my
day or I get to see my old family
sleeping and I need to see that they're
all taken care of and to me that is my
ultimate job that is the number one
priority that is in my life is just to
make sure that these people are happy
even this guy as long as they're happy
that's all I care about
