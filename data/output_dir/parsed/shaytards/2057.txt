us to their dance so I got me and two of
my buddies and one of my buddies took my
cousin and then I went with my cousin's
friend and then another buddy with one
of their friends
well here in this place up here is where
they had the pictures they are taking
pictures for the dance
right up there we were one of the last
people to take pictures and me and my
friends are up here and we started
looking at this no job that we're like
what if we jumped from that railing into
that swimming pool what we did and we
were like the talk of the town the next
day I was like do those kids from Idaho

off the top balcony into the pool and
the principal yelled at us I was like
