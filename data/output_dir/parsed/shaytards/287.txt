made class you she was showing how to
make the dough for your your thing that
you made for your project dough
what's the secret to the best hot
chocolate in the world what are the
ingredients so you need to go into it
this Stephanie milk chocolate ad that's
the main ingredient so firstly not a
brand deal probably all know how do make
on trip it I'm just telling you anyways
because I'm a Viet thing you put water
in it or whatever one that as a name to
it like Stephanie for Curie's or the hot
chocolate bread oh yeah has to be a
fancy name finally it matters more I
think what matters is how many
marshmallows you put a little spoon as
promised colors and I put in here and
mix how hot does it be did you get it
boiling uh yeah I just like six minutes
you put marshmallows in it
yes where are they in the pantry oh you
can't have good hot chocolate without a
blanket of marshmallows floating on top
that slowly melts in the delicious hot
deliciousness
woo thank you for this by the way we
making this remain your own that means
that needs more sugar I know
alright sorry for micromanaging your
chocolate three reason and you're saying
there's no sugar so put like a hive of
you up its wagon what is what does it
call for how many scoops does it say to
put in no it just says to put a woman's
one hears it oh there you go
that's a marshmallow iceberg watch out
ahead there's a marshmallow iceberg let
me just see how that tastes
