there was a long line in there and they
were double price and I'm like they were
glue sticks are a hot commodity right
now no we should do we should start a
business where we buy up all the glue
sticks in the offseason then when school
starts we'll get online where we'll get
in the newspaper and we'll sell glue
sticks for a reduced rate and we'll make
a little bit of profit that's a good
idea we're going into the glue stick
