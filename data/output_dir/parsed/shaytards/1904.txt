now watching the Shaytards watch just
sit back relax follow
excited hi I'm breaking the law nice to
meet you
what's your name ha ha ha I did I did
pull a little a maneuv little sh goobidy
goobidy maneuver alright so here's the
scenario
today is our 8th year anniversary me and
this beautiful goddess of a woman have
been married for eight years she's got a
good personality she can sing like the
dickens she suggested the dickens can
sing really well she's beautiful as the
sunrise the best mother I've ever seen
in action and this girl can whip up a
chicken tuna casserole like nobody's
business
one of those was a lie it's your job to
figure out which one and I hate chicken
tuna casserole so that was the hint
that's the hit that's the like Oh Oh
Lady is what you're doing okay so here's
what just happened we're on our way to a
Utah Jazz game for our anniversary and
we got about 30 minutes out of town and
mommy turd goes do you have the tickets
I don't have the tickets we flip around
and I'm just like pissed you know it's
like oh it's like a waste of an hour
almost 30 minutes out of town have to
turn around 30 minutes back and then 30
minutes back to where we were so
basically just because we forgot I
forgot the tickets were left now we were
headed back I was going 95 miles an hour
on the freeway passed a cop going the
opposite direction I saw the cop I go oh
crap and I looked at him and the cop
made eye contact and he looked at me and
I looked at him I was like aah
and as we pass he flips his lights off
there was nowhere for him to turn around
there was like these back lights in his
back window he didn't flip his pull you
over lights on he picked he flipped on
these back lights start flashing looked
like he was trying to get over you're
watching the rearview mirror like oh
crap oh crap please don't pull over I
saw like finally found a place to turn
around but at this point I was way down
the road where I was going 95 like I
said so there's an exit there was three
exits earlier than we needed but I got
off on the first exit that was available
so I am in effect running from the
police right now on our anniversary
isn't this exciting
I do not condone
I am yes you do anyway yes you do I you
confuse own it a little bit here's how
she condones it a little bit because as
soon as I passed the cop I started to
have any place at around I floored it
like yeah you're going 200 miles an hour
like we're running from the cops
she's like slow down they're gonna catch
you and I said she will get up on this
exit she was wait where are we I go this
is the first section she goes okay get
off I said AHA now you're in on it you
are a cohort we have to go this
