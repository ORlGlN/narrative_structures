the Shaytards have made two thousand and
one or two videos and that's crazy
that's a cool big round number two
thousand videos and I think about that
as like a chunk of time like a section
of history so much has happened in those
three in two thousand videos I just
think about all the thumbnails of all
those two thousand videos I have some
video ideas I want to do I want to make
a video of every single Shaytards
thumbnail and like put it to music would
that be sweet some day doesn't exist
never has never will
there is no someday there's only today
real supermen don't leap over buildings
in a single
they take small of determined steps
consistently over time
lucky charm fell into the arms of a
Flyway Flyway plane the sunrise fell
into the eyes of a wide awake wide awake

I'm here I'm here to stay cuz where you
are swear I'm safe where you are swear I
feel awake and where you are is where I
wanna stay this heart is where you learn
