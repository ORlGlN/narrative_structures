are you guys ready let's rock and roll
oh good morning oh I just got another
message okay so we are here at the I'm
lucid Boston Marathon we're not at that
one yet we'll work on that one we're at
the st. George Marathon and I just got a
text just barely says marathon Shay see
Butler hold on I have to type in my
password huh all the line dojos is oh
good I'm super excited okay okay
thirteen point one inches at a 134 pace
7:10
okay so he's 7:10 a mile they make it
really hard to eat read this estimated
ETA 954 so he started out at a 6.56 pace
and he's at a 710 pace now so he slowed
down a little bit but estimated time of
arrival is 954 he's he's at a 307 pace
right now three hours and seven minutes
so hopefully he can bump it up a little
bit so you can qualify for Boston
but anyways Oh get back this is Laurie
all right sorry this is Jays mom
okay so sundered wants to show you guys
that he can throw this football over
that mountain over there
the power thing yeah I didn't lunch and
that I ran I don't know if that's a
great idea but I'm gonna let you try it
because I'm in a great mood well did it
go over I couldn't even tell hard
I want a bad mom for letting him try
this I don't know but I'm just gonna let
you guys judge me and I'm gonna go ahead
and do it okay do it again oh okay we
got to go so we don't miss your daddy
pops man at this point we will be in
time to just get a good spot hopefully
so that we can see him so this race is a
little bit different than the other
races for me just because I have the
kids with me this time so I'm not able
to like run to the different areas and
see him I was going to try to make it to
mile 16 because in this race it's hard
because there's only two places where
spectators can really watch because it's
on sort of a desolate Road it's like
they take you out of the city 26.2 miles
and then you have to run into the city
it's kind of like on highway desert area
so there's not a lot of cross roads to
go and watch so there's only two
designated places and I miss the first
one but the second one they said uh
youlet there's only two desert Manila
with love with you can we do wew
everybody I'm gonna put it up I'll try
it again so there's only two spots that
you can really watch them and the first
one is kind of a far Drive and then the
second because you have to go like
around the side streets and then the
second one you might possibly miss the
finish line if you go to the second one
so I was like I don't want to do that so
I decided to just bring all the kids
here instead of rushing them from place
to place bring them all here we're gonna
go find our spot at the finish line so
we can get a nice view of him when he
comes in but that's the plan this
marathon round Hey thanks for being my
little helper are you still trying I
love you you just keep working on that
pretty soon you'll be able to throw it
over that mountain over there you guys
know what movie reference I'm
referencing to huh if you do leave in
the comments below
right we're here and what I'm loving
about st. George already is it it's so
awesome
no I'll show you yep that's the finish
line we are right next to it we're
sitting in bleachers right next to the
finish line awesome and look at this
mesh control EC through so the kids can
stand here and still see what's
happening in the race the LA Marathon
had totally like black ops and nobody on
second they had a totally blocked off so
nobody can see and have to like get on
people's shoulders so that you can see
what was happening to the finish line so
I love the way they have everything set
up here so what are you guys making dad
win love your friend your love if you
win your love how about we love you even
if you don't win but when your win when
you're winning we love you more right

walking like this my legs are sore I am
happy with my time I didn't qualify for
Boston I I got three hours in 11 minutes
bettering my best marathon time by 30
minutes
the reason I'm happy is because I stayed
with the Boston qualifying pack there's
like a pack of like six guys and I
stayed with him the whole time in fact I
was ahead of him for the first 17 miles
and then at Mile 21 I just couldn't keep
up my endurance wasn't there and I had
to slow down I just I was dying
basically but three hours 11 minutes
I never would have dreamed that I got
that good of America marathon time and
I'm happy with it today was a great
experience I am glad it is over and I
can say that I did it and I'm very happy
with my time and I'll just have to do
another marathon and you've lost you got
a really cool medal okay so uh you know

likewise like I wasted all that food an
entire bus tub full of bread crumbs

oh look at that one opens
it was crazy too because before any of
these birds even showed up
we saw the dude throwing all the stuff
on the ground and we were coming this
way and we can see all the birds like
flying from that direction
like somehow they all knew I wonder if
it's like at the same time or if
somebody just tweeted the dude at
Danny's is feeding the birds again and
when I first saw him dumping out the bus
time I thought no way or birds gonna eat
all that but it's like almost cleaned
off the ground
these black versus black birds are huge
