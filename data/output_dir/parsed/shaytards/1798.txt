hustle and I had this amazing chain of
events met and this magic thing happened
where one of my songs was on her stroke
cliffs I think you can dance but it's
because I didn't give up and I'm so dead
serious like I wanted to give up a
million and a half times because you
know following your dream was so
freaking scary it's so awful sometimes
but I know for a fact I'm living proof
that if you just push through that
really crappy stuff that your dreams
just kind of hanging out right there
right after it's simple I wanted to play
the song
and then I bought my daughter's t-shirt
for my really freaking hot wife and then
James Blunt dedicated his song beautiful
to baby tart and then we went backstage
and made out with James Blunt yup oh it
was awesome
