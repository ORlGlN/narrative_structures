filmed all day I'm not gonna have a
sheep Todd's video and you guys are
gonna say hey shy why don't you make
video today today all right what's up
it's Monday Monday just at the office
all day talking about life-changing
decisions um Charles Trippy come in
tonight and go get him
I'm gonna lose weight oh I didn't want
to talk about it I'm mad that I brought
it up in yesterday's video
there's been a lot of you who said that
you want to do it you want to lose
weight I wanted to like set up a contest
or something so bad at planning things
so they will do it anyways we're gonna
call it the skinny September
skinnies September we'll talk about it
morning let's do it I scare you know
everything what are you doing give me
the garbage it's not a man's job
No okay good you can do it see why is it
considered sexist when I'm just no I'm
saying like why is it sexist you TIFF
like dishes are a woman's job like
wouldn't it be just as sexist to say is
that a man's job
wouldn't it be similarly sexist what
that's a double standard and I just have
to live with it another valuable lesson
learned here at the Shaytards Betty
sup guys shake yarol coming at you live
from the Los Angeles Airport
International lax or go to pick up
Charles Trippy oh let's see all
terminals good to blog and try to drive
but I can do it because I'm personal
yeah we're going to go to pick up
Charles Trippy right now and if you guys
watch the CTFxC vlogs a wormhole is
about to open up that is right the
vlogging paradox will collapse here in a
few minutes when the two vlogs meet
let's see arriving lights it's a big
Airport okay so it's just cool it's
gonna you know I met Charles online
two years ago two years it's crazy you
can you can get friendships online
arriving flights that's no longer any
place anyways okay here we go trying to
figure out how to get there to talk
together at the same time I need to just
give you guys a hundred percent
attention that's why I'm not gonna pay
attention to the road anymore anyways
like I was saying hahaha
just get that would it be detrimental to
my health okay bye
JetBlue I'm looking for JetBlue Charles
here we are we're coming up we're gonna
see Charles any minute I think I'm gonna
go this way I'm gonna sneak up behind
him she expects me to be on the other
side I'm gonna sneak up on him up on
this side
should be right here
because I told my be on that side if I'm
going to sneak up on this side we're
gonna our goal is to see him before he
sees us
I used to do this to my friends I met my
friend in the airport one time in Denver
and an art we had a contest I said okay
we're gonna meet in the middle but the
contest is who can see the other person
first and I found him first and so I
call them and I was like I can see you
right now no sea turtles
tomorrow that easily be right there no
crap I gotta get over now now I feel
like he's hiding from me as a spy okay
hold on I
there he is over there that could have
been my fault
I said and I said meet me on the outside
road but I thought he was gonna be in
the middle part but he went all the way
over halfway
it's crazy it's a crazy airport pickup I
am the way alright thanks man
Charles is over there vlogging about how
I told him the wrong spot
oh here he comes were you over there
logging about how I told you the wrong
spot
yeah you made it
whoa that guy comes up to me he's like I
don't know if this will help you or not
but it probably better to be on the
right side see what I thought I could
thought you would be waiting right here
I know that's what I was thinking I
didn't know which one you weren't
obvious I should have said the middle
anyways we did it guys whoa CTFxC is in
the van yes my pilot with a show-off
he's got here 45 minutes our old lady
really yeah I told James my dream he's
like Greg's like I know a shortcut

Bermuda Triangle trying to left it and
