what is fighting for fighting is for
movies and people who are losers and

your words huh there's lots of words you
can use instead of fighting
that's called smack-talking we don't
want to do that too much so huh cuz then
someday somebody will actually smack yet

little bit of competitiveness like come

if I do this video in HD it will go up

about ten o'clock it'll take about three
and a half hours in order to compress it
and upload it if I don't do it in HD
it'll be up in an hour it'll be up by
7:30 so I think because I'm late tonight
I'm not gonna do it in HD so that
explains why yesterday's video because
you're watching this video today right
now as we speak you are watching this
video that's why yesterday's video is
not in HD because I just want to get it
