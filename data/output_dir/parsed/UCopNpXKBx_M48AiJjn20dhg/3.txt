okay thanks alright I don't even know
where to start this is just gonna be we
just decided to set this up and just
film one clip just gonna upload it
straight to you - we're not gonna cut it
or anything yet it's just gonna be a
really quick video explaining um Oh
so due to recent events being yesterday
we were in where we're still in Florida
we're in Orlando we just got off a
flight landed in Orlando but we flew
from Fort Lauderdale we were in they're
staying in Boca Raton if you know where
that is but that is like it was 20
minutes 2025 minutes away from the
shooting that happened yesterday in
parkland Florida if you guys don't know
there was a high school shooting
yesterday at a high school and 17 lives
were lost and then I think there's like
18 also injured so a lot of people are
affected yeah and we don't have like all
the exact facts on it and everything um
but after just reading up on it and
seeing what happened and just I don't I
don't even know what to say but it was
very surreal being that close to alert
to where it happened in that being like
my hometown I've been to that school
before I was home-schooled but I
wrestled growing up all the time and I
had done wrestling tournaments there and
everything like that so it's really very
yea very heartbreaking very eye-opening
we're not this isn't like a video to
talk about political stances or anything
like that that's not we're trying to do
we just want to UM ah I guess should we
go into it now yeah we just really well
we were thinking and talking what about
what happened yesterday and when
something like that happens I think all
you want to do is just like help them
yeah like help anyone that was affected
and it's tough because a lot of times it
seems like there's nothing that you can
do about that kind of situation besides
like pray and
talk about it in people like go on
social media about it and stuff but a
lot of the times you just feel so like
helpless about the situation but we I
don't think it was a coincidence that we
happen to release a piece of clothing
with content clothing yesterday we were
it was a flash sale and it says love
never fails and I think that is a kind
of speaks to what word going to do about
the situation so we decided that we want
to extend the sale that we did so it's
going to be up for another 48 everything
another 48 hours
um and so they're still available the
sale would have ended but they're still
available and we decided to take all the
money that Jess and I would have made
from that sale and we're going to donate
100% of it to the families it was like
everyone that was affected yesterday we
want to bless them and help them out in
that way yeah and I don't know we're not
doing this for like any praise or
anything like that we just feel like
it's a the right thing to do um we just
want to let you guys know where your
money is now going in my works sending
this sale so we thought we'd just post
this letting you guys know what we'll be
doing with the money we're not taking
any we're not going to make a single
cent from these letters that we would
have it yeah so it is the the love
number fail sweaters if you go to cotton
clothing calm you'll see it right on the
homepage just click that and you want to
get a sweater they will it's gonna help
a lot of people
yeah the proceeds to that will be going
to to the to the victims families
so that's all we wanted to come on in
say yeah sorry for uh
I don't know no it not being like a
whole blog or anything like that we just
wanted to address the issue quickly and
let you guys know well this time yeah
yeah so um we love you guys and I'll see
you guys in the next video which should
be a normal father just a normal video
so love you guys
you
