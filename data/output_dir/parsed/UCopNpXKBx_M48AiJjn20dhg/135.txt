we are new to this vlogging thing
because it is currently 742 and what's
starting and I'm starting our blog some
42 at night so but it'll we will get a
ton of footage because we actually have
something like planned for this vlog oh
we have that camera stuff up because the
video we film um this is the last of
what we need - we have so close we're so
closer it's such a good job that picture
of New York is going to be mounted on
the wall we haven't hung up any pictures
that's why this clock here is on the
floor it'll be going red here you got
some way guitar anyway if you do any
sort of social media you have to have
our work actually have a coffee table
coming because um we have like this
meeting maybe medium whatever it's all
that is there but there's no where to
like put drinks set drinks down or
anything like that
oh wait we could oh sorry a good
excitable
so we got this record player look check
this out look at these frames
I'm obsessed with it so much it's so
cool
that's like my favorite thing you're my
favorite
so does this pile of clothes is from the
video we filmed today these all the
clothes just bought me for that for that
video right Jess okay and this is
basically that's all that's changed in
my room because everything else is kind
of the same but this is uh oh
well that picture is going up there it
will go like that
and it is going up on the wall and then
I put the TV there the old TV oh that
was right there but part of the vlog
today is going to get a new TV that is
going to be right there a bigger one
because that one the room is kind of big
in the wall is big so it didn't really
work in this room it looks like a good
size TV but it was too small for the
room right yes cool but above the TV we
are putting these would you want to
shown the pictures this girl on
Instagram amazing she's she's a fan but
she does
unbelievable artwork well basically she
had made an artwork for us um on
Instagram and posted it and it was like
so cool that for your birthday her mom
got a canvas of that photo so then once
that happened that was when I was in a
shrill and we saw the canvas I'm really
upset
blown away it was so cool so I was like
yo and I move into my new place I only
get three canvases all next to each
other and put them on the wall so I
message the girl was like hey can you
make some artwork for us I'll pay you
you buh bah bah so I paid her to make
these portraits of us and they're just
so freaking cool like look at how like
intricate like the coming of the smoke
and everything and there's your
signature image it because of like that
it looks yeah look like the paint drops
and splatters and stuff like that sick
is that yeah I can't wait to have these
there that's all good yeah where we
going at now we're going to get the TV
that will be going there and we're going
to battle each other in Mario Kart
because I have a Wii and haven't played
it since
both times you did it in last two vlogs
I didn't notice you were doing it and
now I noticed I don't like it hey sorry
but when you're meant for each other
I'm gonna crush it at my rakaat and
Gabe's gonna cry I'm going to kill you
Mario part don't even know see mmm let's
go
if I was your boyfriend I'd never let
you that's the ticket right there
yeah yeah
like it's like a sweet-and-sour moment
yeah we got a TV we just don't have the
actual TV they didn't have it in the
back so they're shipping it to us but
honestly I don't even think we could
have fit it in the car anyway good that
means we can't play Mario Khan yeah
which is kind of disappointing you want
to walk to Krispy Kreme it it's right
there it's just that we're getting
Donuts what uh-huh how are you guys good

like what he's mocking us anyway like
what were we talking about not we're
gonna go get donuts and we're just
talking about how it's kind of sucky but
it's also good because it's a freaking

could get matching between it did end up
getting and then there was Chewbacca and
