about that babe okay but whose idea was
it to get another candle mine so mine
you were looking at the candles and then
I was like let's get one no no yes yes I

like oh let's you want to get another
one
I'll buy another one I was like yay

table that this came in what don't
believe his lies just thinks she's super
strong and decided she won't on it no
I'm gonna put it right there and she
thinks she can pick me up ready uh Oh
God very good thinking well what did i
do what did i cable icicle do with my
arm what did I do
one two three go and you go to me for a
second Lina my feet got this rock there
gonna be a stretch my steps you're here
quads up in your triceps in my come here
get sweet get off the floor
yes yes give me your hand give me your
hand come on how you just tie up I'm
gonna spin you Jess come here okay what
stop walking
why the people want to see this kind of
stuff they want to see inside to our
real world okay guys where we spin on
the floor and cook pizza my gonna pick
some pizza Oh what oh okay so this is
out right there
today we're not making the cookies yet I
know but this needs to sit out for 45
minutes before they don't care I need to
let them know that I need to let them
know that I know what I'm doing
as you can tell things aren't going as
planned by the pizza I don't know if
they can see it but it's not a smoky
kind of smoky we're not sure why I'm
pretty sure it wasn't smoking before but
the pizza went in there turns moving a
little bit because some of the cheese
fell and dripped on the bottom so we're
just being very precautious right now
maybe we got the fan on if anything bad
happens in a fire extinguisher in the
closet it's probably take that out this
sweet and no one does this uh everyone
back home literally no one does that
really everyone I grew up with does this
nollie that's the best you cut paper
with scissors yeah you also cut pizza
with sistership it's so like it tried at
home so much better than a pizza cutter
it looks works ten times out of ten oh
but I guess we can tell them that like
we didn't bend the house down oh we
didn't the pizza thing worked my
suspicions of the cheese falling on the
bottom of the oven and causing smoke was
correct yeah it stopped smoking so we
will indeed cook cookies after we eat
our meal the butter we are still on
defrosting so it's almost ready to be
whipped up into some good cookies
what are you doing there we spilled some
of the pizza crumbs on the table what is
that it's my vacuum I had to vacuum I
didn't want to brush it off the table
and then vacuum the floor so I just
watch TV there's two steps of the
process I just completely annihilated
the first 70 in this so we want him to
bake cookies I'm about to start we
realized something very important I was
like to have a mixing bowl
