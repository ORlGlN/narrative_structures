it's ten o'clock right now I'll fly is
that when 11:25 almost well basically I
put it in my foreign plan on whatever
the time was when we have economic back
you know last year in Florida is 255 mm
there because my the time of my sign
change change like the time on my
planner she entered I saw that a flight
that was 11:55 here she answered that in
her planner in LA at 11:55 so when we
got here and switched it to 250 fan time
zone it's a Mason I was like having
everyone then I thought was it like 245
255 foot up
I'm taking our time this money I just
know happen to check I was like let me
make sure that the supply is actually at
the kind of just kind of in the morning
I don't know why my brain didn't very
like guess what's not right because I
knew that we landed in LA like having
scooters in my own but Judge the story
to where I can't look
yeah we have to our sauce slightly which
I think are for me driving on coffee its
own we want me driving not on classy
isn't exactly the safest option but you
know so we're going to go to the airport
and catch a fly by coffee and we're all
we did it guys we got our coffee well I
go to chai latte well you're not a
coffee drinker anymore and it's so
disappointing literally my heart hurt
like when she was jus Magisto me she was
like I don't know managing coffee
anymore I went into hiding for a few
days but I think I have to drink coffee
for the bomb because what does coffee
first
you think I'm going to start drinking
coffee again are you no way babe are you
really don't lie to me that just made me
so happy if we can go on like legit
coffee dates where you don't order chai
lattes and you order actual coffee I
just say me to happier have confused my
third pigeon in the airport we have got
our tickets and plan out plane well you
might be a little late but we are taking
off note that means it was still been
like yeah
and we just made it to security and we
are holding it first okay
it's okay and guess what our flight
started boarding 10 minutes ago so we're
kind of just going to walk right up to
the gate and probably walk right off the
flight it's not on the flock so many
people here and completely the route you
need to need everyone walk on the
husband's army Doc's are coming made on
the fly so late normal like our life
points of actually sitting next to each
other on the flight last night they
separated us I was in the middle of the
office I choose in the middle seat on
the other side in Thailand

almost oh yeah it was the longest Jackie
O my entire it didn't oh my gosh my
heart is full right now okay so I have a
friend who I was best friends when I was
like 6 and 7 years old and me and my
brother were best friends with him and
his brother but stuff happened where
they moved away and I haven't seen him
since since then since I was like 6 or 7
years older however old I was and this
past weekend in Florida as you probably
know we had a wedding reception in
Florida for the people in Florida
couldn't make it to the wedding and
stuff like that and I invited him to
that and he ended up being able to come
he has a wife and kid and stuff like
that and it was so cool catching up from
not seeing each other for almost like 15
years or something like that and when we
were younger one of like the last times
we have hung out him and his brother
came to Georgia with my family and up
there we were I think we're at my
cousin's wedding
got and he stayed with my family and we
watched a movie called The Princess
Bride section again means are kind of
old but we loved it and we wash it
together we run around outside like
swords and stuff like that and so like I
fell in love without moving and I still
watched it just like to this day just
randomly watching the movie like knowing
that I love the back when I was a kid
and it was with him that we kind of mean
Claudio and my friend Nico myself and my
brother's name of my friend Nico and his
younger kind of found this love for the
movie and he asked for my address she
said to me I get a wedding gift out of
this package I have this thing I pulled
out the Princess Bride DVD that's sick
and that is like what good man that's
really awesome
