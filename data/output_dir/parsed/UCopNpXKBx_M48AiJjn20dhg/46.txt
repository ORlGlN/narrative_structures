real talk here is gonna have a real babe
sit down next to me with you I do a
short version I tell you wow you're
making fun of me because I tell stories
not no real time because we have always
had something guests over for like the
past few months is the first like I'm
off that we've have been having people
in the house since February no oh yeah
yeah yeah late March early April and
other reasons because I've been on set
working all the time like last night I
didn't get home till 9:00 no I just
finished until 9:00 p.m. and I could
hotel it was just like tough and we're
always I kind of get the vlog though I'm
planning the freaking tour album out so
there's been a lot of stuff like taking
our attention and then when we have
guests all of our free time has to kind
of be hanging out with them because
they're our guests so we've been haters
and so we went on a date for the first
time in a while guys we went inside a
movie and I love Randleman is really
good impromptu movie reviews vitamin
which show good all the way if you
haven't seen it never mind negate the
impromptu movie review well we won't
give any spoilers but I would go see a
second time I loved it okay I'm going to
say
okay never mind not a spoiler alert I'll
say just past halfway during that whole
beginning like half of the movie I was
like this it's like just a generic
superhero movie not too much is
happening there's a moment and you guys
won't know if you watch it you'll know
the moment your mind just goes like a
door a door open I'll tell you that door
opens then you're just like what that's
what you're like and in the message with
you it was very go on a date which
seemed like the first date was gone you
know what in a while
yeah well sad to think about but then it
was really good I mean I cherish it what
