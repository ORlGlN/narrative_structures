run back into the house or something I
thought now would be a perfect time to
let you guys know that a lot of you guys
thought that this surprise was us

need to convince him that it's a good
idea to get another puppy maybe after
Christmas or something like sometime I
really think my only needs Friday is

very exciting we just got a package it's
still outside in the door yes guys what
everything is like you know it's coming
together the TV's still on the floor but
right now we have like the couch in
place with just as a new fluffy blanket
that's gonna be a disaster for our black
clothes yeah it's gonna be perfect are
you kidding me the amount of things that
are gonna come off this thing and just
completely destroy our black con team
hoodie it is next level but yeah I mean
I would say the two things that are in
place are the couch that plant over
there and the table here sweeping is
very cute with the chance you know what
I think is cute your face anyway anyway
