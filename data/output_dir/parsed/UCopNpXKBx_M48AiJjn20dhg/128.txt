felt weird there's a part of me that
felt weird
that she has a ring on her finger she
has a ring on her finger that signifies
to people like I'm getting married she's
taken and there's nothing that I have on
that you know I kinda felt the same as
well yeah and I felt weird like I want
people to know that I'm taken by her and
I'm hers so we got a ring at Chad yeah
so got a ring and I'm just gonna wear it
until I guess you could say purity ring
promise ring stuff like that because I
did have a purity ring when I was
younger but I I lost it the ring I lost
the ring so that's you know the story of
