rainbow up there it's like a rain shower
right now there's the epitome of Florida
look the sun is shining through but in
that moment is friggin and live and
breathe holy crap there's a double
rainbow I just caught a double rainbow
on the vlog coming justice Jess was just
explaining love Nicki I'm being serious
jess is just explaining to me how
athletic she wears back I'm not greatly
athletic but I do remember this one this
one specific race I did and I was like
that oh maybe second loss and if it was
like a lung it was like a long race it
was like 800 meters I was doing this
race and I was second or third loss I
was kind of at the other end I run past
this section my sister who's two years
older me might they know who they know
who Sarah is she's been in like somebody
long okay fine my sister was like
standing next to the race and I ran
pause little like that lost Jess
and she was like gorgeous that gave me
some oomph in my home and I just I sped
off
I set up the first place for the
remainder of the race where did you win
okay it was like it's like Mario I
caught so I was I was first place the
entire time I was like oh my goodness
I'm about to win I'm about to win this
really long race ahead of all these like
cross-country runner people yes
anyway literally within the last Meetup
okay you remember the girl but I'm not
gonna say her name Elsa she haha she
overtook me and I came second
dang at least you got second you're not
second-to-last yeah true right okay I'm
back again when she shut it off
she continued talking about her sports
life oh I didn't have much of a sports
life but I was just telling him what I
remember about sport that I play she is
such like a savage basically there's
this book called netball I guess it's
similar to basketball anyway so when I
played netball in school if we would
verse another team and we didn't win I
get so competitive and like so mad if I
didn't win after you finish a game you
obviously go shake their hands cuz
you're a good sport
okay if I didn't win a game before I
would shake their hands I'd get my water
bottle and wet my hand and shake that is
so bad yes I'm marrying a freakin savage
guys but I'm not like that anymore
that was it kind of a snobby thing to do
yeah that's like being a sore loser yeah
sometimes I am a sore loser
well even still like when I kicked your
butt mariokart at the Arcadian yeah I'm
a big sore loser yeah except I didn't
make excuses for losing worse if Gabe
loses he always makes excuses for losing
well because the only reason I lose is
because of a something that was out of
my control like the wind draft the
controller battery oh they are the
faulty seats
I'm like literally every time he loses
he has this like excuse list line dog
yeah no you teach excuse me
any day I do not that's all I have to
say I'm not coming back to the log about
another sports story maybe it's a higher
