it was great this is great on the
weekend so good but uh but Jack was back
home and you know what that means we get
to see our son I mean lately
he's only he texted us and he's like I
missed you guys and I look sick this
year too
by the way know all of you guys like
getting serious right now we read
through a lot of comments on our last
vlog and it's very like disappointing
and upsetting that a lot of you guys
judge like our lives based off of the
blog and obviously like we live our
lives on the blogs but like during this
period of our life we're just as
planning a wedding I'm kind of taken
upon all the responsibilities of a blog
channel and like trying to shoot all the
content as you see I'm the one kind of
always with a vlog ever and I'm the one
editing all the videos so that night we
had to get a vlog up for the next day so
obviously when you can do something
entertaining we couldn't film in
we were doing that and I was just like
all right let's just film stuff Jack I
was playing Mario Kart it was in a silly
mood and I was helping her when the
camera was off yeah they didn't see ya
what'd you do help you which is not
entertaining on the blog so I just
started filming and we were being stupid
and Jaco picked up a guitar and it was
fun to try and like last minute get a
video up for you guys and get such
horrible feedback on it was really like
upsetting and but what I feel about it
is that like 15 drinks
September with something in it like
like that I remember and like people
know the type of person that you are
yeah and like how sweet you are and how
caring law and I'm like just because of
this mahn video there was so judgmental
and that's why I was really disappointed
because they do know you better
yeah shout-out to the ones who stood up
for us and didn't write horrible
comments and honestly I went and blocked
people because that they're talking so
much crap on our videos that we're
making for them they don't deserve to
watch it so if you're gonna start hating
on aadum if it's us or other people that
you're talking crap about on our videos
we don't we don't want that we're gonna
let Jacko answer the door she's ringing
the doorbell but if you're going to be
hitting on her videos a matter who it's
to
we're probably gonna block you because
we don't want that just letting you know
Christy Oh son way you that is so funny
dude you brought the bear out to cuddle
how was it it was great it was great
oh now it's being played on TV maybe
you'll see us I'm kind of fond using the
crap but yeah yeah so we were just doing
what you're just giving people on the
you adding comments and
No there will I deleted a lot of them
but we were just getting bonding people
virtual spanking really what no sign
moving routine yeah you know how like
yes I'm better guys no no but like it
was really gross and disrespectful like
horrible comments well that's a lot of
you are sticking up for us I mean most
of them are nice but there's just a lot
of people being so beautiful I say like
like saying that I leave that that game
wasn't right married yeah like and I
came because you said that in the world
like they're just babies
I legit said that in flight I also one
that was like oh just wait what
like yeah so one-sided game atchoo is
yes like serious yeah so I was like you
know I've watched so many pitfalls like
you guys don't deserve to watch our
vlogs if you're just gonna kind of trash
on it but hey shout out to nyle for
killing the game new yeah oh my gosh
so Jaco posted after watching Shawn

Invisalign and I tried to turn it on
just in time for it like they catch her
client I have one more left and I'm a
slime ik brown brown Claire boom it's
the next day by the way if you're
watching this vlog
what was in the first day I was telling
them to stop hating on people
oh that's right typically us but we just
wanted a vlog how amazing this
watermelon is like whoever decided to
cut its weight all right mortgage nice
fricassee focus it supply just oh fuck
man look you mean mmm
are you gonna eat it when you get ready
hey baby let's start out a frame start
other frame I don't want to continue for
a second then what we reply my yesterday
with us if there's ever a problem with
us that we're having we're not going to
vlog it to those of you are saying that
we're vlogging hearing your problems
also so there's a probably not people
also that's so true so if there's
something like she got mad in the vlog
obviously it's not real because really
wouldn't blog us biting or like yeah and
if there is ever any fighting on each
other we don't feel like blogging yeah
and there's like if there's ever any
fighting in the vlog that's fake for
entertainment purposes like when you
make a movie there's always big fights
dramatic stuff is happening but well
because you have to make it entertaining
so when we blog like oh what can be
entertaining for you guys to watch
that's what I did that I was literally
wedding planning that day but I was too
hmm exactly we just didn't shine on
camera cuz that's not entertaining so
usually guys know there's ever a problem
and you're watching and you guys are
like oh my gosh
I can't believe they're fighting we're
not like when I yell at Jap dog he's
running around doing stupid stuff it's
because the cameras on
love each other carry me carry me oh
you're doing it let go my head
the main reason we turned this camera on
today was just to finish the vlog
because we've been very good at
forgetting to finish the vlog right yeah
