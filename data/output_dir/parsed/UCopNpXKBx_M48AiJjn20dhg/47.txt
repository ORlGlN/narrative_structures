about to leave for the airport in this
cafe right we're getting our coffee all
this stuff mom I was getting my cock
we're getting all of our stuff ready and
all that jazz and this guy walks by at
the front door looks at Jess looks at me
and starts freaking out like like really
freaking like if you were a hardcore fan
but we like figured he wasn't because he
was kind of kind of a sketchy like could
be one of those guys that like you just
want to watch I don't mean to like
stereotype don't get me wrong and why
not that and we're not but just like the
way he was approaching us in the
situation was really like you kind of
had to keep your guard up he was looking
at it like if he was a fan but he was
like probably between 25 and 30 years
old okay anyway not that that has
anything to do it but this guy starts
freaking out looking at us
No and all Icicle like what the heck is
going on so I keep like I go and get
napkins or something like that and walk
over like the counter and he heaps like
peeking over right behind the wall
looking at Jess she was so creepy it was
it was a little awkward
so then after all that he decides to
walk in and he comes he's like walks in
makes a scene would you say yes yeah
makes a scene walks away wasn't that big
sorry everyone could hear and everyone -
there wasn't a lot of people there it
wasn't like a magnet thing for people
there than like two people behind the
counter whatever but he comes walking
he's like how do you do a bro
I got to know how you do it and I was
like so confused I was like do what
after our second I thought he was
talking about like I thought he was
talking about games videos and like
games really cool editing yeah but I was
like wouldn't you freaking out like that
like normally guys approached me about
like those videos are like dude I love
your work you know they're like so
moving on he's like freaking out and
we're like what the heck is going on
he's like how you get a girl like that
point that jest and we're both sitting
there like this is not happening right
now and he like is literally sitting
there checking Jess out like up and down
the whole time like staring at me and
talking again and I was like ready to
fight this dude not that he was like
trying to hurt me or anything you just
wanted some advice but you know you tell
stories the longest way yeah there's the
short way of saying it in the long way
of saying I think you guys I go I'm
always a very very long way so anyway
moving on um this guy starts asking what
did the comic what was the conversation
that happened oh yeah then he was like
how do you I gotta know I gotta know bro
he like leaned back on the thing is that
kind of dude I don't know how do you go
to
how do you get a girl like that means I
can looking at Jessica even when you
explain that it doesn't seem as kind of
creepy as it did in the moment imagine
I'm you guys how do I say jess is
herself in this situation I'm the guy
you're me I'm talking to you but I'm
like oh I gotta know how do you how do
you do that how did you get a girl like
that yeah literally like talking about
cooking
then I was like I didn't know what to
say I was just like my waiting and he
was like waiting what do you mean
waiting how long is that like 1 year 2
years what he government and I was like
till marriage we waited and he was like
guys are married and I said yeah yeah we
are and he was like how old are you guys
don't attack I'm trying to just like I'm
oh no that's what he that's when he
asked is like why are you going to get
married when you know you're just going
to get divorced in a few years and we
were both like what the heck and
meanwhile everyone in the coffee shop
was like listen to that like silent
listening to this happen and he's like
well being young at the time you got to
look around and experiment and what else
did he say
I can't remember bit yeah just like the
time what if just like breathing I
basically told him I felt so felt like
it was one of those I dropped the
microphone yeah and we were sitting
there coffee shop everyone's listening
and he's like now it's time you got an F
around while you're John we'll figure
out what you like this stuff and then I
just like looked at him and I was like
oh I wouldn't have ended up with her I
did that and he was like yeah I felt so
do after I said that I was like sounds
good like and he just looks at me as
like okay alright guys all the best yeah
I was like wish you guys the best he
just walks out no no but then that then
the barista behind the counter was like
after the guy left and we dislike to
look at each other than the barista
behind the counter which over he's like
well played man well played and I was
like nah nah guys it was the most
uncomfortable thing ever happened to me
and dude if the guy ends up watching
this he's not so destiny so I'm not
going to watch us but if he does dude I
encourage waiting I very much encourage
it I guess the best advice is a little
relationship is I think it's really this
okay the way you act is what you attract
if you want someone and yet loyal and
has good standards morals is you know
knows what they want morally I guess if
you're doing things that aren't that
you're not going to attract to that kind
of person if you have higher standards
then the way you're living then you're
not going to end up with someone who has
those fans
my last answer sorry if you guys have no
story times maybe funniest story times
or something yeah well the only two
story times you've done or one dudes hit
on you yeah but we have lots of funny
stories yeah we do
what stories we're just like I think
we're just like funny to ourselves we're
like that really gross couple is like
we're just funny like to each other
yeah when I think about it I'm like oh
yeah remember that really funny time
when that wasn't funny at all
