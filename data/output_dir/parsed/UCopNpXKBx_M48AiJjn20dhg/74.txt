I'm another day and another all right
and the clog yes
Flint so today is a rainy rainy day here
in LA but it's still good because above
the clouds the sun is shining somewhere
the sun is shining so what are we doing
today I'm trying to make it through the
stop sign of this intense we're
literally in accounting what are we
doing today we are going to a movie
screening but it's like private it's
very cool and very special they were
like yo just you guys are going to
ensure that time we're not it's not like
a normal screening where you dress up
and stuff like they're like we're really
excited so do your folks nope I'm soaked
and it's going to be lit and then maybe
that we're going to go see is called
collide and it's got love in it it's got
action in it
so it's a win-win for both of us because
I like to look and feel like the action
is action movies I love love - I love
you babe they invited us to go watch a
screening and we were like yo that be
done we can vlog it because that's also
dope since it's like a private movie be
here watch a trailer and the team sticks
we're like yo let's go check it now so
we are going to just future here this is
dope actually Hall is it's awful
yeah little a we need this in a house
man this with office is going to look
like
starting tomorrow should we go back
around we got up there a little bit if
you know what I mean all ash is lit this
is also all lit your unlik Oh surround
sound is laid
Oh lit guess my bomb I love you I love
you
and guess what I'll have to pee so bad
why does that not surprise and I have
the worst water in the world is that
intense or what my meeting I turned and
looked at you and you were like this
this yes we are leaving kind of take
Pyrenees for the road Kimi hit with that
and we're out of here
ah right oh my water we out of immunity
what a movie man I was intense I really
enjoyed it the whole time the main theme
of the movie was like essentially what
would you do for love God would you go
fill up yeah like a girl needed a kidney
transplant and he needed to get money so
he starts doing all this crazy stuff
basically some of the greatest stuff
happens like what would you do for love
and he went to like crazy extreme like
raising it was pretty cool because like
the reason why they wanted us to go see
the movie was because they knew our
story kind of knew that we went to long
distance just moves across the world
yeah it was like really cool seeing like
the movie and I'm like thinking of the
question why should i relatable you know
and what would what did we do for love
well I put a ring on it for LA that's
what I I would say how Bob we went for
love is like we traveled across the
world like several times yeah last year
just to see each other ultimately losing
all this stage you name it
you just don't know so huge you thank
you to open road for having us and
you're like how to Little Theater that
was dope is really fun and by super
lucky to see it Ellie but if you guys do
want to see it it's out every 24 and
there are some like questionable parts
at the beginning so if you're young you
want to take your kid in yours if you
get get a little easily like I do a lot
of actions is like some
pretty intense part because it is pg-13
so just be careful don't look likes it
back to me I really enjoyed it I feel
like I should need to drive this car
like a maniac right now probably
shouldn't could look at the truth I
can't go anywhere Los Angeles gotta love
it still Oh wet and rainy yeah look at
the Sun okay how Instagram is Instagram
Instagram oh my god so weird I apologize
it is the next morning and I don't feel
that well I'm a little sick but we're
fine it's good you could probably hear a
no sound like a pig you ain't gonna have
some breakfast so
we've been pretty busy so you couldn't
finish filming after we left the movie
which is why we decided to start filming
the rest today but we can't for the game
not should be fun it'll be interesting
it'll be interesting you might get hurt
you're little scared a little yeah we're
gonna cook some breakfast and we'll eat
the breakfast while we play the game I
think that'll work out because me and
multitasking aren't friends if you know
anything about me I can't multitask for
the Landman look at Jess right now look
at this but first coffee she has tea
inside are you kidding me babe all right
so basically this game we decided to dem
from the movie we watched kalaiy about
what would you do for love's we decided
to like make a few questions and ask
each other things if we would do that
for each other and well yeah this game
record what would you do for love what
would you do for love challenge look at
I was making fun of just for after what
you were drinking our Kioto and checking
out of the pink monk but I actually have
coffee so okay so we might have a list
of questions that we write separately
because we didn't want each other to
know what we're going to uh Jessica
coffee yes would you shave your head to
me what are the terms and conditions can
I have a way doing it takes it far ahead
I didn't know this was a negotiation
process a yes or no and I guess I mean
shave your head shave your head but
everyone has to know that you shave your
head but then you can still wear way
afterwards yes you would
yes all right let's get the buzzers
right now if I was sentenced to 15 years
in prison would you go in play for me
yeah I like that
yeah that's very sad Mike either way
it's 15 years without the other person
so how is it well I don't think about
them I don't even like jaywalking I'm
not going to be going to jail would you
give up social media like YouTube and
everything yeah I don't know let's do
that
but I like your YouTube channel stuff -
that's like pretty spirited a little
under I can that one of my questions was
it yes my bad hello yeah sorry we were
interrupted because their furniture
being delivered right now and assembled
and stuff so currently the house is
becoming even more of a minority but it
is very exciting and I were going to
continue in Korea I'm Jessica with you
what I was getting dark end of this week
huh hmm let me think about that maybe I
don't know we give you data on evil yeah
I would if you like really definitely
wanted in the workplace so again you
know what I mean this isn't real just
theoretical question that guy she's
gonna get you - okay all right just next
question Jessica would you what you get
a transplant of my name more love no you
wouldn't do that
what if I work I was like there's no
other way this is going to work out
unless you get a trained sample Mike dan
how we doing that probably a pretty bad
relationship yeah it's not what's the
decided you know you don't get a
transplant bond breaking okay just be
weird you get a transcript of it you
know like the name would it be cool to
have it above my car or something like
that time Sam yeah a little weird when
you wrote on it in a very much full of
cockroaches for one hour yeah you know
doctors country but for you another
person
it ain't easy be like or not I feel like
you're not asking tough questions that's
really tough I wouldn't do that B you
wouldn't you wouldn't you rather break
up with me to go to this room the
cockroaches yeah exactly
sooner to tell us because I love you
Simon no I'm going to do anything I
wouldn't do like illegals like I
wouldn't like if you were like rob a
bank for me I'd be like no I'm not going
to do that cuz that's what you know what
I mean that's like illegal stuff and if
that is hurting other people since
that's something that like I just need
to like push through that's like not
something morally wrong yeah
Jenica what would you kiss a toad for me

the way and that giant toad we how I
animal kingdom that were like did you
kiss or not no I wouldn't
