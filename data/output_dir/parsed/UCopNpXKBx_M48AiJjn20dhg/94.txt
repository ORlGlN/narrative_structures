pulled me out of the way from smacking
my face a little thanks babe for
protecting me we're just trying to find
where the harbor is you know what I have
to say about it maybe you know what it's
gonna be it's gonna be lit did you sure
the echo figure it out we just walk down
this road it's very weird because like
this is such a busy road at Sidney and
it's completely blocked off we're right
in the middle just witness cruising on
the street and guess what it is
these right
you everything ready three two one
I'm kidding I'm not gonna do it I'm not
gonna do it I'm just gonna say Cameron
instead it is exactly 20 minutes
until the new year you feel about that

like we're gonna leave here 2017 we
didn't know that the place
yeah like to wear the bridges like the
view of the bridge and like with opera
houses and stuff like that like it's all
blocked off unless you have tickets like
date numbers and stuff so that's kind of
chilling outside we didn't know Happy
New Year everybody
Happy New Year babe Happy New Year soon
very soon but it is ten minutes till the
new year but we're still trying to find
the best spot to be
yeah I don't know I mean that it's kind
of how
like I see it over there there's stuff
but we can't get there but there's a big
crowd all up here so I'm guessing that's
for the best view in the street kind of
goes up
do that we just wanted to be good
because it's our first New Year's kiss
either of our so you know we want it to
be some something good
all we got is a few of this train going
by here I don't know it's gonna wow that

a better I don't know what to do since
we don't know what we're doing we just
place ourselves in the middle
and hopefully we better work it just had

but to be honest this guy's phone is
blocking the whole view
judge Bower TMZ how do you feel having a
person actually
Oh
I feel like a new man
Oh more flowers
20:17 came in
there's a lot of really good fireworks
on the other side of this building
because we hear lots of noise and
nothing is happening oh there we go
yeah there's for sure a lot of fireworks
over there to the smoke
can't see crap so since we're old people
we're grandparents we try and leave
early before everyone else does so we
don't get stuck in
yeah oh look what we found look what we
found there's more fireworks over there
this view so much better whoa look at
that
this is a loudest
my life
the whole city yeah it's 2017 time for
bed
but first no coffee oh look eat that
cockroaches why what it's up moving
oh there there it goes there we go Jess
what are the odds that you pick it up
and eat it ready one two baby what would
it take for you to eat a cockroach
what if it was for $10,000 $100,000 a
million dollars to eat a cockroach a
million dollars ya know a live cockroach
for a million bucks but hey happy new
year thank you happy new it's really
weird that it's actually 2017 but it
doesn't feel I guess 2017 cuz like even
in Brisbane in Brisbane it's 2016 and
America it's just New Year's Eve yeah
Happy New Year I'm American okay but to
talk more about this New Year's thing I
feel like it could have been a lot more
romantic

planned it out better but we did just
get off the plane I was still like
really happy like I was really excited
when yeah when I count down to show
Scott in and I like
