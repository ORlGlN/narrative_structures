really excited about to do this thing

me to edit right now but it will be done
soon and I'm so whoops excuse me anyway
anyway anyway okay I'm ready freaking go
let's do this okay so we on our way
Street we are on our way to show you
guys something first coffee
as always I'm Erin we both posted
pictures saying like oh we're going back
home to LA for a little bit we posted
pictures on Instagram by the way yeah we
both posted pictures and we were like
something huge is about to happen and
there's some reason everyone took that
and I was pregnant that's not what this
is obviously I'm glad that you guys want
us to have kids also a lot of you guys
thought we were getting another dog
psych because I just posted on Instagram
a picture of baby Miley when he was like
a baby so you guys all took that as like
oh my gosh hey kidding you know the dog
no that's just trying to get everyone to
convince me to get out of Milo's a
handful oh sorry the announcement
obviously it's not that we're pregnant
and we are not getting another puppy it
is something else and you're gonna have
to wait we're gonna be there where I
don't know but we're gonna be there soon
okay guys we're here
oh yeah sure a lot of you are so
confused
I'm sure about like this is really
random out of the blue a just moved out
yes
so we're going to explain this situation
to you right here what's going on oh
this is my last time okay so dude we're
vlogging okay you seriously have to get
out of the park babe we can't lay down
you guys we have to make a makeshift
tripod
hey my name's 2,000 years later okay so
we're going to explain everything so we
moved into a house like July 1st I like
the sound of July yeah that was a rental
house and we had been in the apartment
or live a year and then we moved into
the house because we were running out of
space we're in a two-bedroom apartment
we're looking for a 3 or 4-bedroom house
and they were all super duper expensive
and then we found a house that had even
more bedrooms and a cheaper brother
trying to block we found a house with
more space for cheaper than the prices
of all the other houses so we decided to
build into like more space that's
amazing so lots of things happening with
work and everything like that trying to
figure out what the right decision for
us to do is the house was a lot of space
that we could not keep up with and an
opportunity came up for us to buy our
first home
yeah and it's super exciting and through
everything we were like this could be a
thing they're probably not and then we
were like just like a little
and just kind of like if it's meant to
be it'll happen and the doors will open
and like literally each step that we
took we were like okay let's take the
next step and just see what happens we
can take the next step and I was like
okay wow that's actually what just
happened so smoothly and he literally
closed on this home the day before we
had a week off in the middle of tour
like perfect timing for us to just start
moving things in we saw the house for a
little bit so we'll be moving slowly
rather than all on one day are you so
excited and yeah so we didn't mention
yet that we are not moved in officially
yet where you just brought a few things
today who got the keys of the house
yesterday we move in in two days which
we will also be vlogging so pretty late
for that vlog like a subscribe show here
but the main reason that I turn the
block camera again to film this clip is
because we have our box of there's
hangers in here but we have our haunting
goodies the black and white ones which I
happen anyway anyway we have our box of
continuities right there and I'm wearing
one right now representant yes so we
brought this box because I'm going to
start organizing the merch closet right
here and basically we open this up and
we are just going to have merch lined up
it's going to be like the content
clothing is all just gonna be in this
closet right here but the thing is is
that it's not just gonna be the hoodies
because in the very near future we're
working right now and literally we're
just finalizing some of the designs for
like the next lines of clothing that
we're doing freaking cool it is so
exciting we're trying to come up with a
few different lifestyles like a t-shirt
and a long-sleeved thing it's gonna be
dope we're so so excited about it
because like it's really fun designing
your own clothing and being able to
release it and then seeing people
wearing it out in public is even cooler
like when we go to the shows and people
are wearing this to the shows it is one
of my favorite I think
so if you didn't get one of these we
will be coming out with new stuff soon
just in time for Christmas so be ready
for that
um enough talking about the merch
hanging up in the merch closet my love
you're weird and that is the last ready
to go in the merch closet so we got the
blacks we got the way I didn't realize
we had so many hoodies but we requested
that many some people come over again we
can just be like here take a hoodie you
know I guess so anyway one hour later we
back out in here in the new home look
look what we just did well it was mostly
Gabe but I hope they look so cute thank
you so since there's nothing in this
place right now we realize that the
acoustics are just incredible
whoa many hours later hey guys
chivalry's not dead
hey we're gonna dude you look he's
driving right are you ready I'm only one
call away I'll be there to save the day
gonna work kinda song guys but I still
sounded bad oh well you never sound bad
so joke's on you babe shall we we're
back at the house we're back at the room
in the house the house is where we are
now the home is what we're moving into
and what we bought we refer to home and
it's only for the house so anyway we're
at the house anyway anyway anyway so for
the rest of the day we're just gonna be
just doing some packing and cleaning and
don't take on me
don't you dare and that's gonna cut week
yes I would say about first coffee but
it is now the afternoon evening and I
probably should kind of coffee although
I won't what I probably shouldn't have
one so okay let's go
let's get the show on the road shall we
wait wait wait babe one last thing I
love a good ultimate dad am i right also
