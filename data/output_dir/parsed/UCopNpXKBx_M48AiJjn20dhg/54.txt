texted my manager and I like is there
any way we can go tomorrow
no no so did you feel really
uncomfortable talking in the elevator
with the I said everything no you get
you get to a point of logging where
you're just like you know I mean it
doesn't matter when you walk in if you
like look then I really want to tell me
is it because you just kept going on
Vicki yeah whatever yeah but if you're
by yourself talking to a camera then you
look really weird like if we weren't
yeah if we were working she was like not
there and I was logging by myself 100% I
would have just been like about because
she was next to me I'll just I can't
keep going he's alone by himself he's
the one looking we had not talking
we're not funny to keep vlogging you
just want attention
you don't want my heart
maybe you just hate the Sun me with
someone new
you just wanted attention you're like
that family it was definitely better
than the last one well I realized how
much of a nerd you notice every time I
get back in the car call myself a nerd
after you're doing time disciplinary
sighs VidCon business is your very first
like any social nation yeah honestly

more than five people at a time very
kidding me we've been at the malls and
girls look like to you okay
it surrounded by like 20 girls over okay
but you know what any I haven't been at
a place where hundreds and thousands of
you guys all think like 20,000 and
30,000 people go to become what I was
going to say why I look like a nerd was
I have two glasses I have these that I
don't really need aware right now
because they're for editing and I just
wear them sometimes because why not and
