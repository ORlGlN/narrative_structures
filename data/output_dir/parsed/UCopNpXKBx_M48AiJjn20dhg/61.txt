another day another Q&A
another day another Q&A yeah so like
another day and not as a cute and not a
day and kind of cute na oh and mother's
day I'm nervous cute that's enough oh
this is weird man
I feel weird so before we start we have
a little thing we want to address and I
little we mean the big elephant in the
room fairly large hey so we noticed that
you guys have noticed that we haven't
posted a vlog in a while yeah we saw
your hashtags and everything and we
haven't rested a vlog in like a month
since I'll tell you right now we're
filming this on the 3rd of May and we
haven't posted a vlog since basically
there's a lot of April basically one
month exactly a month I mean we posted
the two music videos so it's been a
month since oops vlog
sure and you guys have noted so we
thought that we would explain what's
going on
milos barking let's go bring him so they
can say hi tonight BRB hi he's way more
hyper now and we really don't like him
in our room because he loves he loves to
pee and poop in here my guy gave him a
month to get him a haircut Brad got he
was babysitting him one day and give my
hair you guys tell because like it's
going back really nicely
it's like Mariano honey mom hi buddy
hell oh okay she listens to me more many
cuddles me Mom
well it's already closed okay more look
at home me right now okay but as we
explain every even start out with it we
were busy and like obviously we went
down to two days a week we kind of just
like put it on pause for a little bit to
like we really needed a break um initial
well initially it was just we needed a
break
we hadn't any gifts and that made it
hard to love as well because like I had
some friends come in from Australia and
Jaco we had Zach we had Sebastian when
they were over Braga I was over all but
like it was just a lot of N like for
example when my friends in Australia
whatever like if I had a spare day it
was me showing them around and it wasn't
like it got really hard
for us and we wanted to prioritize life
over the vlog and not have a vlog
dictate what we do in our life we didn't
want to schedule our life around having
to film vlogs but rather we wanted
schedule the vlogs around it work
schedule in our life it was a helpful
healthy Bank up and then um then
throughout that period I was able to
focus on his awesome videos different
filmmaking which I'm sure you guys have
seen them you guys have shown a lot of
support with those which is awesome but
that kind of sparked this thing I was
just getting varied with like what we
were doing I guess from my point of view
how I've explained it to a lot of people
and like with all the meetings I've had
people asking me why I'm doing this is I
was doing vine using my creativity to
film different chops for an angles doing
all this stuff like having to like
create like a essentially like a mini
movie then I'll let the Facebook and I
was doing those I don't really do those
anymore all of our efforts are in
YouTube and I wasn't doing I wasn't
really using my creativity at all I
wasn't pushing myself at all was kind of
why he wasn't pushing himself is a good
way to explain I was kind of taking the
easy route and just like let's film a
YouTube video especially on my channel
the blood trail was what this channel
was a little different but especially on
my channel so I look back at the whole
channel it was like what am i doing so
with that I then was like I really need
to push myself started making these
videos it started with a successful one
and has gone through the more recent
ones and then that just led to me
realizing that I had this passion for
filmmaking and things of that nature and
I need to do something with it so it's
hard to explain
any tactics might not make sense to you
guys
yet yet but I was trying to explain it
as simple as we can okay
so essentially on this channel we'll be
posting every week once and I'm going to
go on my channel and I'll be like I will
be vlogging every other day roughly
three times a week ish it'll still be
our lives and everything like that but
with this passion of mine I realized
that I it takes a lot of effort for one
video to make the ones I've been doing
and I was like I need a way to push
myself in this way it can you know
continue to learn and push myself
creatively and continue down this path
without not without but like it was just
really hard it's just very hard to be
able to make a video like that every
week because it takes so much work and
effort and just that have an idea to be
able to film like there were some weeks
attic skits because I just didn't unlike
I don't have an idea to be able to make
into this awesome like short film a
movie or whatever you want to call it so
we thought it was best that I take the
route of putting a vlog on my channel
and it will still be our lives that'll
be what we do and I have some really
cool idea I'm cracking my fingers and I
have some really cool ideas down the
road of just things and where to develop
this and where I want to take this and
that has just been a process of this
past month and we're not it's not like
we're leaving or going anywhere stopping
YouTube it's just a little change in how
we do things jess is still posting on
her channel like she always has been so
what we will post on the channel could
be like um a weekly vlog it could show
like what we get up to in the whole week
or it could be something like this like
a Q&A we're so figuring that on but um
don't be worried that like I won't be
content because there's going to be a
lot of content coming from his channel
my channel might open there's going to
be a lot of content coming from his
channel content from my channel and
content from this channel also you guys
are probably if you've been like
following this whole thing you guys are
probably like wait why are you going
back to three vlogs a week on your
channel you guys like went down to two
blogs a week on this channel and we were
vlogging uh we realized through the
whole process of doing a lot of stuff at
least for me I real or I mean we both
realize that our favorite thing to do
out of all the work that we're doing
with everything there's like a lot
there's a lot that we're doing but our
favorite thing we realize is cream let
me assume in making creating and making
videos for YouTube which we obviously
were able to do that many videos for a
while and so we got super busy with like
other things that kind of took our time
and we're like alright let's get back to
that because that's our favorite thing
to do I think we explained it well
enough don't be mad
it's not it's still gonna it's going to
be good like it's fine so interpret all
of this um I kind of decided like I
really love talking to and through
sometimes there are more girly things
that I would like to show and like vlog
that wouldn't necessarily be on like
this channel or something for example
showing her outfit for Hawaii okay okay
that leads into a whole nother say for
example um next week we're going on our
honeymoon to Hawaii and I really want to
show you like the outfits and I'm
packing for that so I thought that it
would be cool for me to vlog that on my
channel yeah right there's going to be
lesson videos across all three channels
and we really don't want you guys to
worry about it because because concerts
coming at you everything's just being
changed around a little bit yeah but
still here we're still here
I love this still and I know you guys
have a lot of questions honey needed and
why what are you talking about we didn't
really have we had a little we had like
a pre honeymoon it was less than a week
we had to get back for Christmas right
after we got married and we had decided
at that point that at some point we want
to go to Hawaii for honeymoon and after
I had moved to America and after we was
settled that is happening from Warren
were filming this that is happening in
we'll probably could be in Hawaii then I
could be in Hawaii by now we're very
excited and that leads into the question
of when does this whole thing start like
this change yeah of things that starts
are you tired
that starts when we get back from Hawaii
yeah we don't want to film on our whole
like we'll bring our cameras and stuff
and maybe take really cool yeah we'll
take pictures and I might just film get
some sick drink shots of yeah but like
we're not like filming logs are doing
anything I was like oh I'm going to
start doing the vlog thing this week and
it would have been literally been a week
of vlogs and then you guys be like what
the heck were gone for a while Hawaii
and come back we had nothing
and thank you for being so patient yeah
we're should already start we didn't
explain anything you know we're really
just trying to we didn't know what the
site we were really just trying to
figure yeah especially me I really
there's a big change in my mind and my
heart on what I wanted to do and where
my passions were set and so but we will
still like make videos on this channel
but the vlogs on his channel will be
like they'll be really well made you'll
see what they don't be different they'll
be different I'm really trying to push
myself and do just do something that's
not typical in not the easy route if
that makes sense that's getting to the
Q&A yeah okay now that we filmed the
entire video here's the queue all right
I mean we'd probably answered most of
the questions I mean in that little
thing so if you ask something but then
that whole thing that we get clean lane
you can now click away I literally
tweeted it was like don't ask why we
stopped blogging because we're gonna
explain that home okay thank you one of
the best relationship advice you can
give from past experience this past
month of us trying to work the gown is
see things from the other person's
perspective like really actually do that
yeah it's really important to put the
other person's needs before your own
which could be something very new rich
and very confusing but I'm constantly
working on but um that's really
important and also just communicating
with each other rather than shutting off
from each other
is very important yeah oh wait that the
person the person who asked that Jade
thank you Dave
and now Martina you could change one
thing about yourself what would you
change okay the one thing that I would
change about myself is um that I am such
a people pleaser and I would change that
because I was just going to say for me
care less what other people think yes
because a lot of things I do is because
I'm like what will people think of this
stuff I didn't mean my love and like to
being online and everything like you get
so many opinions and comments through
met you and it can be really hot so many
how do you pray I never know
to say from Julia that is a very good
one
I think praying was different for
everybody but essentially you're just
talking to God like a lot of times I
approach it and it's like a conversation
with your best friend yeah I mean like I
just will sit down to didn't like dear
God and just talk to him as if I'm
talking to like my dad or something
because he's listening yeah yeah I think
that's the easiest way just like talk to
him be like god help me with whatever
like this situation or help me with this
situation we've been praying a lot about
this past month on what exactly the
right thing for us to do is with these
videos it's very serious and we know a
lot of you care about it so I kind of
huge part of that line so we just
approach that with like God help us on
what to do help us some what to say when
we address it and I would say that like
i'ma more like answering it in a simple
way like when we pray we start our
prayers by thanking him for what we're
thankful for like thank you for this day
and thank you for miler and think oh my
gosh he lost a tooth
look at his bottom oh my gosh where is
it um what I was saying is like we write
you would agree that like we start off
by thanking him yeah well what were
thankful for not that there needs to be
a particular order but we oh no you
don't want to be the kind of person who
like what if there's just a friend who
only came to you like you helped them a
lot of stuff and they just came to you
yeah so remember Nellie want to make
sure you everything them thank him for
the blood and release giving you and
then also just talk to him about
whatever is on your heart so that's how
we write what's your favorite song at
the moment oh you want to know my
favorite song alone I don't know if this
is my favorite song right now but this
is one that makes me so groovy what is
what at the Spanish parkinsonism um your
cousin
um yeah I don't actually know what the
words say so if it's inappropriate I
apologize but April asks any tips on
becoming more confident and not caring
what other thing I would say the biggest
thing is like loving who you are and
like being confident in yourself and the
way you look knowing that you're that
you're made perfectly and that yeah
perfect and beautiful and it doesn't
matter what other people really doesn't
matter what other people think I would
say like if you are like wow I have
really pretty eyes then if someone says
you have ugly eyes that were in Bali
because you already know that you love
your eyes some expense but also becoming
more confident you know when people say
fake it to make it and it's like if you
tell yourself you're confident then
eventually you will be confident do you
have a moat awkward moment I've
explained this before in a video one
time I was six years old
I was in first grade it was my first
year in school and after that okay and
up to that point I never really favored
and up to that point I my mom just wipe
my butt who just like why why did I
don't need to wet my butt and my mom did
it like so what I went to school I take
a poop at school and I didn't know how
to wipe my butt my teacher had to come
in what my bell farming those random
bears and I learned very quickly you can
embarrass very embarassing bitch I think
if I haven't are you hiding me like but
that was the time where it's like all
right it's like bathroom break and the
whole class is lined up out of the
bathroom the teacher awesome walk into
the boys bathroom and wipe my butt for
me I had to tell their student hey can
you get the teacher I can't let my but
that it was very embarrassing not gonna
be the cutest thing about Bella ops if
you go to Pantera what would you call it
um I'd probably girl it mom I think
Harry is a cute name for a turtle or
Harry I'm not saying Harry I think Harry
it's the same thing Harry Caray is the
American Way and you just have your
accent on it Harry anyway I think Harry
is a key Kayla our pet peeve without
each other and have a pet peeve for me
um I used to I used to yeah oh wow
Milo playing well was he surprised that
you weren't confident driving and I was
like just try Oh arrived here you're
fine just take the car and dry but now
guys I arrived we can we have a car now
if you don't agree on the landing
drivings great yeah she loves it we got
her a cheap and she's like in this this
big Jeep is just literally in like the
thing assignments uh and I'm like anyway
my pet peeve I would see I don't really
like the one pet peeve but it just
sounds like you're really annoyed
awesome I know which I don't get but one
of my main love languages is quality
time and um he likes to play a game your
son and I don't like it and say if I
want to be cuddling it I'm saying all
fairness her dad showed me the game
saying I have to play and if you talk it
takes away from cuddle time and that
that's pretty annoying okay how about we
do one more yeah one more animal we have
one more question and it's from Ashley
Ashley asks you guys want a baby yet we
got one right here
sorry darlin right here the ductwork a
real amantha like he really takes up so
much time and like that's part of that's
part of what I've been so busy is that
training like properly training is like
trying to do it right and giving him
like the attention that he needs he
didn't know how to walk outside properly
and when P and like everything how to
treat guests and yeah that takes up too
much time it's in like getting up in the
morning to take him out to pee and poop
is like really almost like having a kid
and I know it's really not Mike yeah
there you just love when you have to
take your kid out the pan because you
know that I am my babies I can't wait to
have a baby but I can make tiny baby
