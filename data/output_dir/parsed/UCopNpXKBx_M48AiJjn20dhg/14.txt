about she's like pulling up right now so
another day another year another flight
it's from Florida back to Los Angeles
gonna be a good one it is currently like
6:30 in the morning should have left
probably like 15 to 30 minutes ago so
I'm gonna shut this off real quick we're
gonna check out of our hotel and go to
Los Angeles we're gonna be back at it
back at the freaking thing you know how
it is
can't stop won't stop a new year new me
- like 2018 where was 2017 anyway I'm
turning this off so we can go alright so
we didn't know that when we left the
hotel we'd be leaving in a monsoon month
monsoon it's kind of raining like crazy
though
yeah and we're hardly running late to
the airport this is Mission get to the
airport without dying even though we're
in a monsoon
Florida he literally pick aynd of the
perfect but kind of the worst day to
really see it was something like we're
leaving now
that's what I'm saying that's what I'm
saying it's like on the day that we left
you don't the light just like covers all
the hair but it's great because it's
raining and it didn't rain the whole
time we were here however traveling when
it's raining sucks because we're like
lugging around the edge and also the dog
thanks for all your rain of Florida we
love it he freaking made it I am so
tired so we actually made it through
everything fairly quickly thought we
were gonna be a little late but man we
made it like 29 yeah it's how we roll
dude 75 years later we're back in LA did
you just hit finish we're back in LA
guys we didn't we wanted to spare you
the boring nests of just getting on a
plane talking on a plane getting in a
taxi here so now we're just backing away
and it feels good to be back in this
beautiful place my beautiful girl right
here and this beautiful dog right behind
I love it it's so good on the flight
yeah he's a baller Milo you're such a
baller did you know that you nearly
potentially speaking of picking noses

vlog I have a booger I probably have one
now you know why like I don't always
know I don't have one now I don't know
you down like this but that's why you
always vlog you always like I log like
this and then like literally several
times at each vlog I'm like well it's a
booger in my nose and then it's like
embarrassing like I can't leave the clip
in the vlog without like pointing it out
cuz then people are gonna comment like
oh did you see that booger out there and
I'm like leave the time that it was a
booger alert it's trending guys we're
gonna make merch that just says booger

it was getting hot in here BAM I was
like cuz dabbing is so relevant I was
gonna be like oh babe I'm gonna go up to
him and say dude you're the guy who'd
add to the background of one but like

she discouraged me from doing it she
wasn't gonna actually do it and I was
like why would I not actually do it I
was going to she told me not to so I was
going to yes I was and you're like oh he
totally was way after the fact after you
already discouraged people I'm done
talking about this two hours later you

exactly what we said the first time when
we were like next time Museum we'll talk
to you next time next next next time all
right keep on first coffee oh you know

please and then Milo's like putting toys
I'm not going and you know just like
leave it there and then he took my ow
don't do that he like puts the toys down
and then tries to squeak it and
sometimes he like puts it in the area
where I don't want him to play yeah so
we went to Florida for our anniversary
trip went up to where my family lives
still employed yeah for for Christmas in
New Year's and had a great time however
mmm excuse me that's not the however I
was talking about but was Jess and I
actually had to do some distance again
what are you doing dude we're trying to
vlog about the vlog life don't get it
dog like doc cuz he's a dog he just he's
not he's not gonna stop so basically I
left the Gabe for how many days is it
for three days four nights for three
four nights three days there we go she
went away for a little bit of time in
the middle of the week to see her very
good friend also named Jack Ian Orlando
up this Jess the other just works at
Disney World
yes sir I went away for a couple Milo
stop jumping on the vlog camera dude
apparently it's so hard to be parent
there I went away for a couple days and
we had to say goodbye at the airport and
it was so weird she actually started
crying I did like I got immersion
back
I'm gonna miss mom she's crying a little
bit it'll be really quick then this was
the first time we had been apart since
we were since we've been married being a
part of so is so weird so like going to
bed at night without each other was just
the weirdest strangest I didn't like it
excuse me but it felt like we were then
it kind of felt how it felt when we
weren't even engaged you know just like
we were a part on our snapchat streak
back I know I like that hasn't happened
in a long and a whole year good to have
it since we got married and then all of
a sudden she leaves for like three days
and we have a three days in a fresh tree
yeah and then she came back which was a
great moment which was really fun we
actually filmed it so we'll play that
right now
in the lobby the hotel right now jess is
about she's like pulling up right now so
how bad did you miss me oh my gosh how
weird is it vlogging on this Johnny and
I left that in Los Angeles
and like my family they're all so loud
that I just have to yell if I want to
say anything you got to be back with me
yeah
but the quality is perfection it's
filming in 4k and I'm allowing it come
and going to bed at night was ultimately
the weirdest thing well I still had like
you just yes you like the flowers I
picked them because some flowers are
your favorites Jessica are you joking
means she started laughing after I shut
the camera off she goes I forgot about
you a little that's no I didn't meant
