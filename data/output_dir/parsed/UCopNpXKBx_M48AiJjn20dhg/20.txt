editing in videos and all that stuff and
using my creativity and all that stuff
is always been high now it's my job so
then Legos has turned it to my hobby and
it is awesome and I love so where were

look-alike sorry I think Gabe has some
great videos somebody an old video

the worst thing ever now putting now
putting it on the internet oh here goes
nothing I am so not excited right now we
just got like the video that we picked
three videos we've gotten them ready and
in the process Jess asked my

your next video baby we're in the video
game if you didn't catch that a deer
we were deer hunting Claudio's the deer
probably yeah and he just got up inside
of walk okay so what that thing is is
that Ricky has a deer calling the thing

version of the video we needed something
better so naturally a few of my friends
got together in like the bathroom and
sound recorded off the computer that i'm
just going oh my goodness we held the
camera like this right here
