I cannot believe today is actually here
just a few hours I'll be your wife for
life I love you so much
and I'm so excited to marry you a new
life with you
you're my biggest inspiration and best
friend and the love of my life
you want to know what I'm most excited
for
after all the goodbyes we get to go home
together forever
I'm so blessed to have you and I know
our marriage will be so fun
did Jessica it's exactly 18 hours until
we have both mr. and mrs. Conte and I've
never been more excited about anything
in my entire life
from the day I first met you I have
continually been in awe upon credibly
kind loving and godly you are what I'm
most proud of from this past year with
you is how unbelievably confident you've
become both in yourself and in your
relationship with the Lord
as our journey together continues I know
we will both grow in ways we wouldn't
have ever dreamed a long adventure
together called life will have so many
smaller adventures all strung together
to create such an amazing journey I
wouldn't want to take anyone else
I love you endlessly Jesse
Oh
everyone else here is sort of said
what I actually believe that just guys
met in a crazy way
but you just perfect for HIV complement
each other so amazingly and
I has that this sounds like could you
take a better product for my sister
you're not brother you're my best friend
I love you so much Gabi
I'm so happy for you I see how happy
that makes me so happy
and Jess for the time that I've gotten
to know you and see your pure heart it's
just unbelievable I'm going to edit
whenever anybody asked me about you like
who you are and what kind of person you
are I always tell them that it's
unbelievable that my brother has been
able to find somebody like you on the
complete opposite side of the world and
I see how you care for my brother how
you uphold my brother and how you love
my brother and just I see how happy you
make him
and that makes me really happy
what I'm most looking forward to
from today is never having to leave Jess
again just through like all the distance
that we've had to go through
and just the long times apart sometimes
months at a time it's really been hard
sucks but Jess I wouldn't want it I
wouldn't want it I have done that Sona
never way with you I know years ago
today where I know kicking distance in
the body father God
Jess and I come through now we just want
to thank you so much for giving us such
an amazing opportunity come together in
marriage be united as one under you and
just to live a life together and really
the hope that we'll see you one day of
our journey then start fun and be on my
way into your love again how fun single
I don't know
wishing I could have hugged you for a
few more seconds I will never forget
when you text me good morning as I was
going to sleep and I will never forget
the hours of face time when with call
adjusters each other's company
thank you today is a celebration it's a
huge celebration for those who are here
for those who have travelled very far

friendship of family and of two people
who are one madly in love with each
other and are committing to be in it and
to ever be loved the stream let me to
where you were love is who broke my I
can remember the night clearly and you
had both of my hands clutched ears and
my forehead resting on your shoulder
with my eyes filled with tears I slowly
expressed to you my greatest fear that
one day either I will have to complete
my journey on this earth without you or
here without me they're broken bro let
me straight to you
there's they're broken bro that means
true
but until then with the understanding
that every good and perfect gift comes
from the Lord Jesus I promise to you
