good morning guys we're up super early
this morning we're going to go to the
Vatican I've got my breakfast in a can
super healthy this is where you're
guaranteed to get pickpocketed around
here it's always by the people you least
expect
that like stress this is going to get
very cozy very quickly
I just can't believe the Vatican is
actually a different country we're going
to be going into a different country the
giant wall right there is the walls of
the Vatican City so we're right right
next door to it we're about to go and
enter the Vatican Museums with our local
guide so just let's go in apparently
it's silent - the tour guide has to
whisper on a little thing and then we
have these earpieces
what needs to go through the security
guys check out this metal ball spinning
around in the middle yes so this
represents the time the samurais
attacked Rome and this guy just got
chopped in half so almost all the
statues have their penises missing I
don't know why you can't me did you
steal all the penises did you steal all
the penises show me your bag show me
your bag okay fine I took out my tag on
this the samurais attacks here as well
and locked off both her arms such a
shame
so it's all right it's just explaining
that these tapestries are woven with
gold and silver and like kilograms of
gold and silver a woven tapestries
this guy is stabbing a baby that's not
cool man
this guy's got a cool beard ah this
guy's got an even cooler beard right
we're now heading into the Sistine
Chapel
Oh
the famous Sistine Chapel everybody pro
just come out of the Sistine Chapel
we've walked into some peter's square
and this is simply this church behind us
biggest church building in the world
sorry don't stay on the sea
okay don't stay on the seat coos yeah
okay let's better to please okay okay
nice thank you sir now if you want yeah
circus no circus here yeah you want to
go to the circus then we already did our
circus totally will move back summer
soon we are heading to get a snack and a
coffee I definitely need a coffee and
Joe his offer to give us a little bit of
a tour of the coolest places in Rome I
just had a missed call from Olli and he
got through to will and basically I'll
even get on the train with us or
something I don't know where we got
separated we only just realized
so just got off the train we're going to
wait from here hopefully
hahaha
he found it
I'm back yeah I got loves my ticket like
wouldn't open machine
a few centuries ago their local
graveyard became school
and they needed a way to remove the
bones gracefully and respectfully
without having anything disturbed so
what they did is they painstakingly
removed over 4,000 skeletons and then
decorated them in the creek to this
church clothes alone
we're not supposed to be throwing in a
hair guys this is so weird
this is creepy dark
probably just come out the crypt I
managed to get a few shots in there guys
it was the weirdest thing like basically
the story is that they were overcrowding
a local cemetery and they have to move
some of the bones so they decided to
decorate it so great it's just strange
just weird seeing real skeletons of
humans that once walked around like
hundreds of years ago what did you make
of the crypt up I felt really really
good in there I know I'm sure is like a
cultural difference or something that I
was doing I wouldn't walk on display for
yeah this is the kind of outfit I won
that looks sick there's original old
Roman pillars there and had built like a
newer building around of Hadrian's
Palace it's called the reason the
Pantheon to me is so iconic and so
important is because of what it
represents if it hadn't have been
converted into a Christian Church it
would have been destroyed so when you
walk down this alleyway think of
yourself as a Roman 2,000 years ago and
think what they must have thought the
pantheon you may remember me in Alfea
coming and chilling here last time I was
in Rome
you also might remember around here
somewhere is a massage place and I'm
gonna go on a little mission in a minute
and go and get an hour's massage because
we've been walking around and my legs
are aching right we're heading inside
hello mr. horsey whoa whoa all right how
many this dome is the biggest domed
building in Rome best coffee in Italy
apparently I've got to get the best
coffee in Italy guys just saw this
little car park this is exactly what I
do if I crash my car I would tape it
back together with gaffer tape
that's brilliant that's great initiative
like me Justin and Lily have arrived at
this massage place you're looking
forward to this bro ah for weeks now
I've just come into the massage room she
told me to get all my clothes off and
put this on this apparently is this is
apparently is underwear oh just come out
that was incredible how do kid does that
Justin we are definitely feeling sorry
for the guys that didn't come out with a
massage so good how good is that Lilly
so we briefly went back to the hotel and
now we're back at the Coliseum
there is and we're meeting up with the
rest of the group the Sun is still
blazing and it's late afternoon but when
I went back to the hotel I swapped out
there wearing the vest so wouldn't
overheat Justin decided it'd be a good
idea to swap up wear jeans do you think
that's a good idea Justin worst idea
I've ever had in my life miserable
you bum welcome guys
to the Roman Forum and the Colosseum
this very nice man is Stefano
he's will be on the bike hey Stefano
by these here I've just spotted that
we've got some good cameras and they
think they're filming something
professional happy Monday video again so
much the forum area and the ancient pots
of Rome is all kind of destroyed there's
like little bits left a few pillars here
and there and there's just humongous
archways it's one up here and there's
one down there
so the ground level was here and this is
all underground they would have been
like caged animals and stuff that would
come out the ground and then kill people
noise we're getting kicked out
these are last night in Italy don't
forget and then we're going to go out
with style you know have a real Italian
feast tonight this looks fancy
right we just go back to the hotel we
got speechlessly out of the morning then
we got game up at 4:00 a.m. to the
airport right I'm going to try and get
three hours sleep before we head off
it's gonna be bad it's gonna be real bad
I'll see you in the morning in three
hours
peace out enjoy life if the adventure
boom
