Thank You Ben my dad taking a little
stroll down one of these side streets to
buy some clothes
because our little Cove clothing market
trip fails
Oh sounds like three guys left

you'll be able to know guys I'm going to
be changing my clothes I've got three
white vests a blue t-shirt and some
underwear
check out this awesome patchwork car
cover
go adjusting slate night sewing with
this in the shop so we're just strolling
around some of these kind of local
streets and it's a bit more authentic
and there's this little shisha bar
behind where they're playing checkers or
something and all the locals around it's
kind of the hustle and bustle and my dad
is just saying why we really enjoy this
this part of Egypt as much as the other
parts as well it's cool to kind of see
the local vibe and real people united
not just the tourist attractions
every profession that was sewing there's
people making furniture all out on the
streets at 11:00 p.m. it's incredible
incredible matching vests
I think they look pretty sweet for a
sweet and yeah we've got a few of these
to the next few days on holiday so I
think that's me search for clothes
pretty much why I'm going to sleep
Oh catch you guys tomorrow another fun
adventure in Egypt peace out
