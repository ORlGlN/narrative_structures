hello guys I'm se from London and you're
watching fun foolery well today we're
jumping on the buff again and we're
heading into town to a restaurant that
we were recommended yesterday one of the
viewers and we met a parent oh nice
so we've arrived for lunch this is Tina
she's invited us this is her dad's place
and this is amazing food I mean what are
you gone for that and this is gone bad
in poetry this is banana in pastry
another four and this is lasagna and
chicken and pleasure are all very
Brazilian I'm very excited guys I found
some hot sauce Brazilians are known here
hot sauce so get some spice on there
it's on the time for dessert listen
jelly jelly Ingenio right we're having a
what's that easy
this is pineapple cabbage coconut ginger
MIT now make mint yeah this is laces
have some choice under
yeah
have it goodbye thank you for lunch
thank you
we've wondered across town and we're
about to jump on a ferry and take a
little boat trip across to knitter I
wasted another part of Rio a little
Peninsula quite looking forward to it we
haven't been on a boat Brazil yet there
are a lot of people getting on this boat
mind the gap
we arrived in litter I didn't really
know what to expect it's very very
built-up very urban just like any part
of the inner city really we were
wandering down to try and find a coffee
that's a priority for me and Darcy right
now it's definitely Coffee time
I got my coffee and we're taking a
little stroll down to the speech guys
there are so many mussel shells in the
speech literally the whole beach is made
up of mussel shells this is insane
I love these oily shimmery patterns in
the mussel shells they so cool like
pearl
this isn't a very stable rock I think
this could fall off
yeah it's not stuff so long it
take care
Holly it's often the case so we don't
really know where we're going or what
we're doing so we just follow in the
crowds I think I think it's
it was a short little visit to Nassau
but it's nice I'll get back on the boat
love that boat ride there's something
about being on a boat and having the sea
air rushing past that just is exciting
feels like you're going on a voyage
somewhere I think one day I will go on a
voyage somewhere on a boat somewhere far
away we're gonna head up chill for a
little bit charge our phones and stuff
and then make a little bit of a plan
tonight we're back on the bus
my dad are heading back into the center
of Rio to try and point a sample night
which we heard about apparently Monday
nights and not a big night to go out
this is what place I've got a feeling we
may have come out too late we're going
to try anyway this is our last night in
Rio my dad managed to successfully books
tickets today for us to guardsman house
tomorrow we're leaving like lunchtime so
we're going to make most of tonight
totally if we can't - sampling we'll
find something fun today right off to
find our Samba night let's go dad let's
go
I reckon but this way down there
talking about this way I think
boy let's cut with it
right
we don't know how dangerous this area is
we keep on getting warned not to flash
our expensive electronics around so
of the cautious where I'm vlogging well
we definitely found something
we've been walking through streets
completely deserted and then we turn the
corner and there's this so I think we
found our place
the music ended I'm so glad we found the
Samba music is awesome
and I'm definitely coming back to this
place on a Monday night and we've taken
a little stroll around now just ease
into the surroundings check out this
cool fence coloring pencils how awesome
is that
cheers that this is turning out to be
quite a fun evening
dad what are you saying about these
buildings but wouldn't you like to live
the street like this with the character
displays 1897 there's over hundred years
old but most of the ribs are missing is
like a stage set on the film set from
bit but incredible but it is squashed
upstairs two buildings here half
collapsed and it just carries on just
incredible buildings we just can't
believe they're all derelict and kind of
left in a state of disrepair
we were just chilling on the bus and
then I was like wait I think this might
be our stop and we realize yeah we
realized we've gone way past what we're
supposed together what a fun night
that's amazing
and we're going to try and find it a
little shop that's open now to the few
little things we need to buy before
heading up to my we don't be rushing
around in the morning so that looks open
let's see what's in there just just
walking back just spotted a little
random fire on the floor we don't know
where that is
I think this might be a little more real
thing maybe someone died here there's a
lot of molten wax
Yeah right we're getting some sleep
tomorrow morning we are heading to the
airport and then off to Manaus which is
in the Amazon and I'm pretty excited
about this next part of our adventure in
Brazil
lots of jungle trekking I'm a little bit
worried about internet but I'll update
you guys when I find out stuff see you
tomorrow
peace out enjoy life live the adventure
