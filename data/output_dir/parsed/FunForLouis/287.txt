hug him
so rather I need a koala
so before we go on the ice we're gonna
go to the ice bar
they've got set up here this is Q wow so
many Christmas trees right we're getting
some warm clothes on I've never been in
an ice bar before have you ever been in
one so we're literally going into a
refrigerator
this tent under the toys in here
so there's an assortment of alcoholic
beverages but because me and Raya don't
drink we're just gonna get ice lollies
and these actually ice they're made of
ice so cool thank you
yeah that's great apple and elderflower
yeah lovely thank you - no ated here
so alcoholic
like I can already hear eventually

that's crazy
every noise I have like a little Club in
here where there's a like
how you doing yeah that's good yeah I'm
feeling pumped right again our ice
skates done it's time let's go wait we
never be nice getting together this is
cool
got the walkie-talkies the gherkin right
after ice-skating we are heading up the
shard to try and catch the sunset I
don't know if we're going to get a
sunset today I've never been up there
before and that crazy what you want the
penguin okay I'll go get it okay I've
got a banana for riders huh
okay let's go yeah do you feel more do
you feel more secure with the penguin

do you know pinky guys you know pingu
right
so apparently it gets even more
beautiful here when it gets dark it's
all lit up and there's like snowflakes
projected onto the side of the castle
and stuff hopefully when we got the
shard we can actually see so guys if
you're in London this winter I highly
recommend visiting the ice skating rink
and the ice bar both incredible little
activities today we are now go over the
shard like I said but I was looking at
ordering a new bar or catching a tube
but apparently the fastest way to get
there is by boat so we're going to get
on the boat and this is part of the
London public transport system I think
you can just might use your Oyster card
yeah
Oh
this is way cooler than taking the tube
get that tower bridge their appointed
time this personally for this the sunset
just before 4 o'clock at 350 for me
yeah but Santos
I'm gonna head up hopefully it won't be
too cloudy
I kind of excited this is the first
benefit we've just arrived on the 68th
floor
that is incredible so itself a little
time lapse this view is unbelievable
noticing anything like this over London
they've done their simples Cathedral and
then somewhere where's the London Eye
there it is you can actually steer it
around and what happens I'm glad we
actually got a little glimpse of the Sun
the top
