my name is chase good morning guys
today we are going on a tour of the
biggest favela in South America
this is gonna be crazy
right so is a ride at the top of this
hill in the favela and this favela is
called las indias and like I said it's
the biggest favelas in South America
70,000 people apparently
electrical wires just hanging in there
well that pole is gonna fall over
all right amazing
you
similarly art gallery and all of the
pieces terribly painted by locals was
from the favela air this is incredible
this gallery would set up by this guy
you too unfortunately he passed away in
a moment
calories still running
so one of the concerns and coming today
was that it would be I don't know a
little bit too much separation like
we're tourists and we're looking in on
people's lives and it's a bit intrusive
that the the tour got either said
they've been working this in this favela
for twenty years and he's friends with a
lot of the locals say he said it's not
really a concern and they understand and
a lot of the money that comes from the
tour's goes back into the local
community into projects and stuff so
it's all good this guy in the white top
here is covering his left hand because
he's been punished by one of the gangs
he's been shot through his hand
yeah thank you guys a lot of these
bracelets are made out of old wires like
telephone wires or stuff and they weave
them together bullet hole guys open it
is passed through the shutter but we're
stopping for some lunch pizza slices has
a bit too Darcy chose dub cocktail for
that novella copy so guys we got milk
with our copy locals drink it black with
so much sugar so this is like black
sugary coffee with milk and it's but
it's crazy
guys we were just told this is a house
it's blue building so we were asked to
stop filming for a moment and the guy
back there pull down easy and apparently
there's a lot of shootouts in this area
with police and drug cartels
ah-ha-ha-ha look at this Gibson I'm
gonna take it how you doing mr. cat so
many cats so many cat check that view
out guys that is crazy
these are the chickens that we eating
for their dinner at some stage but the
problem is the chickens are eating out
the rubbish so it's not only too healthy
to eat those chickens guys 14 houses
collapsed here from bad foundations
favilla plumbing this is more damage
from shootouts between the police and
the gangs another bullet hole guys so
we're now arriving at a daycare center
in the favela and this is where parents
can leave their kids what they go out
and work during the day
so we started at top of this hill we've
made a way down to here and we're headed
met down to here this cat weighs 3.5
kilograms so we've left with the fella
and we're going to head back into town
guys
that was an incredible experience and I
can't quite put myself in their shoes
like some of the people living there
one guy we met had scars like bullet
hole scars like three in his leg we
jumped in a little mini bus at the top
you guys check out this bullet casing
from a favela shootout crazy probably
got back to Copacabana and we are
heading up to have a little rest amazing
plans for the rest of the day I'm kind
of hungry I could eat some lunch soon

few hours and now we're coming out to
get some dinner
