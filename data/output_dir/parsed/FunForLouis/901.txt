secret project I can't tell you guys
anything about it that I have to wait
but that is the whole reason why we're
here in China so I'll show you a little
with behind the scenes but I don't wanna
give too much away I'm gonna leave Rio
in charge today she's going to show you
guys around a bit so he's busy filming a
secret project today so I'm going to
hijack the vlog and I'm about to go
search for coffee or tea I don't know
what I'll be able to find
let's go explosion huh sound a really
traditional Chinese coffee shop that can
never find anywhere else
it's Starbucks guys how cool is this
I don't know they do this everywhere but
it's like a notebook Wow that anyone can
write anything oh that's not good no and
if anyone can write a message yeah
that's so cute oh but I left me and I
left a little note
so what oh my god guys we've never had a
green tea frappuccino from starbucks
I highly recommend it so good do they
have these in America or is it like a
Chinese Starbucks thing filming
and a few hours later and I just want to
walk around the neighborhood a little
bit and explore doing inside I found a
fruit jam here
I love fruits at my favorite food so I
really want to find some cool exotic
fruit and
is this an apple have you ever seen a
bigger apple in your entire
what is this this is dried mango I'm
taking that entire bag
I can eat a bag that bag of dried mango
easily oh they're washing dishes happier
oh they're doing her button they're
cooking right here basically that night
looks terrifying
crazy
I haven't done anything crazy yet and
we're in China
something crazy long here I've got one
more day so I will try to find all right
most of the filming is done it was a
success I think thing I went well now
we're heading to lunch with the film
crew I'm hoping to have something a bit
more chinesey than with beanie egg I'm
hoping for dumplings something to be
awesome
u-turn do that no you can get it you can
do it
I get it get it I can so this is like
the best game ever yeah as its spinning
up trying to like shovel the food off
onto your plate before it keeps them
going around I like this I don't have
guys let me show you how a Chinese
dumpling apparently this a year should I
just shoot if we can talk about our to
that you're supposed to bite a hole in
it first met laughs no that's not
supposed up I just go everywhere you're
supposed to drink the juice out with it
on any waiting yeah I bet she's gonna
juice all over the floor
destroyed this one yeah we have still
got a bit of daylight left to explore
Shanghai this is my last day
I'm flying tonight Rio is supposed to be
flying today as well but her flight got
moved or cancelled and then rescheduled
for tomorrow and so she's got a bit more
time to explore but we are off now to
see a temple and a cool little garden
down the road and we should be fun Oh
shaky-shaky so we've strolled into this
old town area and there's all these
really cool traditional Chinese
buildings tellings out
awesome so it turns out guys the gardens
locked it closed nine minutes ago so
we're just going to have to find a
temple instead let's find the temple I
love all these dragon statues I think
that's my favorite thing about these
temples the loneliest fish in the world
so I think the temple is closed as well
unfortunately but we've been a voiceless
ward on each side street I'm a are
incredible so just take a little stroll
actually go ahead guys this is amazing
people just hanging their laundry up in
the middle of the street as a guy
preparing his dinner nice walking
through these streets reminds me when me
and Steve were in Mumbai and we can put
a wonder you're just like peering into
people's lives this is so much better
than the main tourist trap definitely
you like this right yeah this is what
we've been looking for since we got here
I think we both look for the same thing
when traveling we want to experience
what people that live here like what
their life actually is and what the
culture really is and this is a little
taste of that it's amazing hope you
found
I feel like not but are these beads
noise I found a head massager electronic
head massage you just press it Oh
guys all the dogs in China are strange
like really weird this is no this is a
Chinese dog briar just told me in the
dark a little kind of homeless but not
in a bad way
Thanks I don't even mean it's just like
when you DIF first around the camera
your beard is just like really intense
yeah thanks anyway we are now off to
something that you always have to do
when enjoy not she's a Chinese massage
and I've only got a couple of hours left
the money to fly back to the UK so this
is a perfect timing
hopefully they've got space otherwise
don't be so sad
right we've arrived in the massage place
and they have space for us are you
excited
you seem a little scared yeah because if
it leaves like really hard intent which
is what you want but I don't not sure if
I won I am so ready for this guys who
just come out at the massage place
and easily that is the strongest most
intense massage I've ever had probably
also in the top five most painful
experiences but in kind of good way like
I feel like when the bruising dies down
it's going to be better for my back and
shoulders somehow right in a super rush
guys I've managed packing with stuff but
now running like ten minutes late to get
my car to the airport it's waiting
downstairs they're like ring in the room
they're like where are you I'm like I
don't know right I'm off I'm leaving
