Ugghhh. Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.
It's morning, but I still see the moon and
that star that you're probably gonna tell
me tomorrow is actually a planet.
Alright, it's a little bit later and I'm in
a better mood now. Plus I'm vlogging from
the car; that always makes me happy. So Hank,
I really enjoyed your history of the Pizza
John design, but it made me wonder about the
history of pizza, and also the history of
Johns.
We're gonna start with the history of pizza,
but first we have to define what we mean when
we talk about pizza. I mean, we live in an
age of cheeseless pizza, and sauceless pizza,
and none pizza with left beef.
Now some people say that pizza is just like
bread with toppings, and so they trace it
back to Ancient Egypt and India and Greece.
But Hank, I think we all know that those people
are wrong, I mean garlic naan is not pizza.
Banana bread is not pizza. Pizza is bread
and tomato sauce and cheese and possibly other.
And by that definition, the history of pizza
becomes a lot more interesting, because for
almost all of human history, pizza was impossible.
Pizza's central ingredients lived in entirely
different worlds, Hank. In the Americas, there
were delicious tomatoes. And in the rest of
the world, there was wonderful cows' milk
and bread. But then, Christopher Columbus.
Now, Hank, as discussed in this video - and
you will notice my excellent pointing skills.
Anyway, the exchange between the Americas
and the rest of the world that began with
Columbus, in the late fifteenth century, was
disastrous for life on Earth in many, many
ways. But it did make pizza possible, and
also like 90% of the foods that we now eat.
I mean, hamburgers and french fries? There
were no cows in the New World, no potatoes
in the Old World. I mean, can you imagine
going to a restaurant and being like, "hey,
can I have a hamburger and French fries?",
and them being like, "Well, you can have french
fries, but if you want the hamburger ,you're
gonna have to leave the Americas".
Well, among the many New World foods that
came to the Old World was tomatoes, which
was initially believed to be poisonous, but
it turns out that they are just dangerously
delicious. And by the middle of the sixteenth
century, in Naples, Italy, we had pizza as
we know it today, with cheese, and tomato
sauce, and bread and possibly other. But like
most things, Hank, pizza didn't actually have
an inventor, it had, like, millions of innovators.
Like, for instance, the pizza in sixteenth
century Naples tasted very little like pizza
as we know it today. For one thing, it was
sweet, like pizza literally means 'pie'.
So the story of pizza is really a story of,
like, humans coming together over thousands
of generations and across continents to invent
the perfect food. And that's what history
is, really, Hank, it's not really about great
individuals, it's this ongoing collaboration
among the ninety six billion or so people
who have lived here.
Alright, Johns! John comes from the Hebrew
name meaning 'God is gracious', and for, like,
a thousand years it was the most popular name
in England, until, like, I was born and then
suddenly it became less popular. I'm trying
not to take that personally. There's a few
minor Johns in the Hebrew Bible, but the Johns
really took off in the New Testament. I don't
want to brag, Hank, but there are no Hanks
in the New Testament, and there's some pretty
vital Johns.
Like, there's the itinerant preacher John
the Baptist, Jesus' apostle John... Historians
disagree about whether there are other Johns
in the Bible, and I'm going to steer clear
of that argument because I'm no dummy!
But anyway Hank, the most interesting thing
I learned in my research is that the name
John is not the same name as the name Jonathan.
Jonathan comes from a different Hebrew word
that means 'gift from God', and it's a longer
form not of John, but of Nathan.
So there you have it Hank, a brief history
of pizza and Johns. It happens to be lunchtime.
You'll never guess what I'm having. Hank,
I'll see you tomorrow.
