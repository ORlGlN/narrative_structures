we'd have to get off right up here at
the Medical Center and walk like another
15 minutes to get to us the
it would end up being like a two-hour
by a full-time Harry Potter now you're
no longer the wizard no longer any kind
of chemical engineer no quit the day job
I was a biochemistry undergrad really
yeah you got your degree yeah

commitment to this industrial park where

its own unique charm and then it's maybe
one of the dirtiest looking
doors you'll ever open into a place that
you will actually eat everything what do

me wait for them I can't breathe through
my nose that's my first reaction but I
don't know if you notice to do when
you're wearing them you can see more
people than when you're not wearing them

dead people so these are dead people
