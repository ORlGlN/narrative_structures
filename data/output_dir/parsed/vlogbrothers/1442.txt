good morning John it's Monday July 16th
okay I need to recreate this photograph
so first things first I need to shave
different Chin's very different Chin's
not better I can't find any eyeliner or
lipstick especially any lipstick that
color so I think I'm gonna have to go
out and try and find some no I'm not
entirely sure where one buys lipstick I
have good news
I found eyeliner and lipstick in
Catherine's little bag and hopefully she
won't mind me using them but she's not
here to ask but I don't want to wait
until she gets home to do this not some
more colors there mm the same color oh
it is so strange how difficult this is
feel really weird about this
what you thinking you're looking hangs
up son nearly dark enough
my goodness do I look funny we must now
continue to recreate this photograph now
for the final pose we're going to have
to move the camera so here goes nothing
so here I am in the basement
um it's dark it feels kind of goth II
and really gothic at all the gothy it's
definitely a flash when this picture was
taken so I'm not sure how I'm gonna
recreate that effect but we'll figure it
out and then that way my right hand is
out and limp bro success I think that I
should take some time to reflect about
what I've done today and how it made me
feel mostly it's strange how weird it
was to actually be doing the lipstick
thing because that was like this is a
girl thing I can't do the girl thing I'm
a boy
then the eyeliner after getting over the
whole like poking myself in the face
thing was fun I liked kind of I can like
doing that I sang a little bit John I
will see you and you're extremely
embarrassing picture tomorrow
just dude my makeup fair on the floor in
the living room hope them LED doesn't
come by cuz you'll see me doing my
makeup and should think I'm a pretty
weird guy I'm a pretty weird guy
aha
ah huh huh huh huh
