okay I'm bored and I'm tired of having
people look at me funny for doing
something this ostensibly not very weird
let's talking to a camera actors talk to
cameras and they're like our primary
gods
I should be considered Slyke someone
that people would like to hang out with
not a freak this is agata Cameron
Airport but this what I'm about to do
probably will classify me as freak
okay so we'll see what happens
I really have to admire all of these
people's ability to completely ignore me
