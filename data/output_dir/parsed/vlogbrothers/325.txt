well a pheasant is a bird and they need
to be plucked
after being slaughtered
our trucks and you probably don't think
much of me just a lonely pheasant
plucker
wasn't just listening
pheasant plucker and nobody's ever
the pleasant mother pheasant plucker
Faysal documentation
and the days were hard and the nights
were long so to keep their spirits I may
say this
mother pheasant plucker
music as like
blessing pheasant plucker and nobody's
ever heard a pleasant mother pheasant
mother pheasant plucker
and she loved to put the mother
pheasants yes I could tell and she sang
this song as she plucked all day long
she never ever ever got the leer
another dozen news
just as the new music
wasn't pheasant plucker and nobody's
ever heard a pleasant mother pheasant
disguise it just
as I pluck mother pheasants
pleasant pheasant plucker and nobody's
ever heard a buzzin

pleasant pheasant plucker and nobody's
ever heard a pleasant mother pheasant
plucker
