Good morning, Hank. It's Tuesday. I have a
flu-like illness, so you should prepare yourself
for the worst vlogbrothers video ever. To
make it slightly more entertaining, I'm gonna
play some Project for Awesome livestream highlights,
so you don't have to look at my sick mug.
So, Hank, this whole thing started while Henry
was giving me Sharpie face on Saturday morning
during the Project for Awesome, and I felt
a little tickle in my throat. I thought it
was Sharpie fumes, and, you know, maybe it
was, maybe Sharpies caused my illness. But,
at any rate, yeah, now I'm miserably ill,
which sucks, because there are only a few
days left in the Paper Towns shoot, and I
wanna be with those people because awesome
things are happening today in a minivan. But
I also don't wanna get them sick because they
still have to finish the movie.
More importantly, the Project for Awesome
has raised over $1.2 million for charity,
by far the most successful P4A of all time.
Nerdfighters, thanks to all of you who donated,
who made P4A videos, who watched them, and
shared them, and commented, and watched the
live show. I don't know what you guys thought
of this year's Project for Awesome -- I'm
interested to hear in comments, but for me
it was definitely the best one yet, at least
until I was stuck by this terrible Sharpie
illness.
John-from-livestream: Cover it with Sharpie,
yes!
Henry-from-livestream: No, I don't wanna cover
it.
John-from-livestream: Oh, you don't wanna
cover it.
Henry-from-livestream: If you cover it guess
what.
John-from-livestream: What?
Henry-from-livestream: You like... get forehead
disease.
Oh, Henry you were so right to be worried
about forehead diseases, which reminds me
to thank my family for their patience and
participation in this year's Project for Awesome,
not least Sarah, who allowed herself to be
covered in jelly. And I should also mention
that the Indiegogo is still live. You can
donate for the rest of today and today only,
to get amazing perks, from a calendar featuring
YouTubers before they were YouTubers, to the
Project for Awesome exclusive edition of The
Fault in Our Stars. There's also original
art by Minute Physics, An Imperial Affliction,
P4A socks, pressed pennies, and so much more.
Donations are tax-deductible in the US, and
all of your money after manufacturing costs
and shipping goes to charities that are chosen
by the Nerdfighter community at projectforawesome.com.
Ah, man, this reminds me of when #bananaeyes
trended on Twitter. Happier days, Hank, happier
days.
Sarah-from-livestream: Yay!
John-from-livestream: You look adorable. How
do I look?
Sarah-from-livestream: It's gross.
So Hank, the Foundation to Decrease Worldsuck
works because there's no overhead. Everyone
who packs and ships perks at the DFTBA Records
Warehouse volunteers their time, as does Sam
Rudge, who does the website work, Karen Kavett,
who designs it, Lauren Chernikoff, and dozens
of other people. So to everyone who was part
of this year's Project for Awesome, thank
you, thank you. We did it! $1 million! Actually
like 200,000 more than a million. Hank, here's
a sentence I thought I would never say: you
are the most beautiful mummy dancer the world
has ever known. I'll see you on Friday.
