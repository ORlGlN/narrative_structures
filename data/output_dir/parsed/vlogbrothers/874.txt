good morning John it is Wednesday
November 3rd song Wednesday and this is
a song that I wrote
it's about Phineas Gage who Finney's
James was 25 years old 1848 and he liked
his job looking at the rail room but he
had another face he was fasting
something distracted him
and he forgot to put the tamping
we shove a tapping rod into that little
old off to the blasting powder and
suddenly his entire left on a lover been
turned into clam chowder
the story was stabbed in the
and was it frontal lobe finned
you could never go home again
Mini's gage was sitting on his bed he
told the doc of the damping rod shot
straight through his head
or that when the case he surely will be
but in Phineas had a coughing fit and a
teacup full of brains fell out of his
head and that was more than the doctor
could explain
story babies
and once in frontal lobe has been
destroyed you can never go home again
and well adapted to the family to
prepare for gages death cuz the one you
take before your head get stabbed is
usually your last breath
you know
after the accident he walked right down
his stairs as if having lost a quarter
of
Brandon left in Norway
nice game she was tapping the brain and
what the frontal lobe has been destroyed
you can never
but unfortunately for Phineas our story
won't end there the reason we
still no his name is the straightest
part of his affair after his brain
scrambled his friends family said this
is no longer Phineas
instead
we know that I've written on the brain
need not cause death and that'll makes a
person who is it's not the heart of the
head
story Phineas Gage was stabbed in the
brain and once it frontal lobe in
destroyed you can
things game 37 years old when he finally
made his way back to his home and family
he could tell the justice finally
creeping up
cuz he forgot to put the Tampico see
cases severe
trauma seizures - death toll and put an
end to this drama
thanks to Catherine and lemon for
helping me film that video lemon
actually didn't help at all I'm sorry we
didn't think to clean the lens
beforehand sorry that I have not
addressed this somewhat pressing concern
of whether or not you could be my second
lychee player AB simply because I'm not
entirely sure I know how to write for
Sigma Jake actually I think it's because
I thought you were kidding but now that
I know you serious I'm gonna do some
research and figure out whether or not I
can write for singham a jiggle John I'll
see you on Friday this is what happens
when your camera Manning and and the dog
is tied to you tumble we just went over
my MacBook
I love Montana
