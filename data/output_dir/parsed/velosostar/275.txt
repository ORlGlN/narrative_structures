Woah.
It's so hot.
Five minutes.
Five minutes, I think.
Five...
No, two minutes.
Two minutes until I need to be downstairs
in the hotel lobby for a welcome speech.
So today, guys, is the Sony Xperia launch
and there's a lot of people here - a lot of
those people... One of those including me and my
ugly face.
And I'm in group one, apparently, and this
is my agenda for today.
So it's going to be really fun.
So, this, here, is the lobby of the hotel.
There's a man that's in the middle right now, speaking, that I should really be listening to and everybody's
listening to him and he's talking about the
new Sony phone.
This is going to be interesting.
I've also just had to sign my life away.
Hopefully, we're going to get up to some cool
stuff.
OK, so, I'm, I'm group one so, I'm following, I'm following
the group one sign.
WOMAN: My name is Sophia and she is Hannah.
We are going to help you with everything and
spend the rest of the day with you.
ALEX: Wait a minute, I think I'm getting a
phone.
Thank you very much. WOMAN: You're welcome.
MAN WITH MICROPHONE: You get the idea. Let's get you all in to position
and make sure that everybody knows how to work the camera.
ALEX: So, from what I can understand, this
girl in the middle is going to be dancing
and smashing her fists through these glass
panes whilst we record it in 960 FPS on these phones.
MAN WITH MICROPHONE: Could I have number 8
phone as well, please?
OK, so I'd like everyone to make sure that
they're rolling in super slow motion mode.
ALEX: That was so cool.
I'm not 100% sure what's happening on this
one but I've got the phone back again and
there's all of this here.
And I'm assuming we're going to click and record on the 960 FPS when something happens
at each of these boards and then we're going
to get the footage from our phones with the
number on them at the end of the day.
ALEX: That is going to look so cool in 960.
So, that was the first part of the morning
over and done with.
Got to mess about with the 960 FPS capability
of the new phone.
Now, we've got to go and do something else.
I'm not really sure what that is, though.
OK, so this is what's been opened up next,
right.
It's a massive show room in here.
I've come over to this bit with the TV, PS4
pro and here is the new Sony phone, right.
And you can play Playstation on the phones.
So, what is, whatever's on the screen is also
being played on the phone as well, streaming...
How?
Tsh!
MAN: Thanks mate. ALEX: Sweet man, no worries.
Nice to meet you.
So, I've nipped down to the beach, I've got
the phone in my hand now.
Not really 100% sure how I can show you guys
being at the beach - I'm not sure how that
changes anything, other than taking a few
photos, so I'll nip on to the photo mode now.
I hope I can get these photos off the phone.
But, here you go - 3, 2, 1...
That's a photo of my camera using the back
camera and then I'll swap the camera around
and take a selfie.
There you go.
But what about video, Alex?
What's the 4K video like?
Well...
What about that for 4K video?
Oooh - there's people coming.
 MAN: How did you do it?
ALEX: I'll tell you what,
boys and girls.
I'll bet you've never seen a high heel before
that's made out of pots and pans.
Look at how mad that is!
What the?
Sony - thanks for the headphones.
Ooh - they've got noise cancelling.
£179 down from £250.
£329 - I know who's the clear winner there!
Sony - insane.
That's just really surprised me and annoyed
me because the Bose are so much more expensive.
That's wicked.
So, this morning has been absolutely incredible.
I've got to play with the brand new phone
that's not even out yet, test out its slo-mo
with people punching through glass and
jumping through plasterboard... styrofoam.
And then I went to go and have a walk on the
beach and play with the phone and right in
this big hall thing, where they were, where
I could play a game on the phone from a Playstation
4 Pro and do loads of other cool stuff.
And now, I've been told to meet downstairs
in the lobby at 6 PM.
They also gave me the ZX Premium as well which
I have right here.
Right, let's head.
So, this is where Sony have brought me for
the rest of the day to look at the sunset
which is just behind me.
How incredible...
...Is that?
OK, so I've got the three phones here.
I've got the Sony phone, the Google phone
and the iPhone and you guys can be the judge
of which one you like best.
So, first up, we've got the Google Pixel.
There we go.
Next up, we've got the iPhone 7 Plus.
And then next, we've got the Sony.
There we go.
You guys judge, in the comments, what was
best.
What one takes the best photo?
In your opinion, looking at those?
MIDDLE MAN: iPhone.
ALEX: The iPhone.
LAST MAN: I'd say the iPhone, yes.
MAN:  ALEX: Sorry?
MAN: I said,  ALEX: And that...
...That's
how to spend an evening.
Wow!
Just, wow!
And it's just getting even more red and looking
even more incredible.
That is just immense.
Guys, today has been insane.
I haven't been out to many events with companies.
Like, I've been taken to MWC - Mobile World
Congress - I've been taken to...
I've been taken to, err...
I've also been to CES in Vegas, right, and
these are all massive events but this was,
like, different.
This was something that Sony's just put on
- like, they've hired out this whole hotel.
Everyone staying in this hotel has something
to do with the Sony event.
They've used the grounds of the hotel to do
awesome things like test out the phone slow
motion and let us, let us all do it in lab
coats and with goggles on and stuff.
And as I said today, you know, Sony have brought
me down here.
They haven't paid me to say anything.
I don't even have to say anything if I don't
want to but they just said: We'll bring you
down, you're more, we're more than happy for
you to vlog it if you want to, so, that's
what I've done today and it's been super,
super fun.
I really need to stop bringing so much stuff
with me.
Like, I just don't need it.
Like, all that stuff on there, I haven't even
touched.
I've only been here for two days - I've done
it again - it happened again.
I need to stop.
Guys, next time I'm packing, tell me to stop.
Grrrr!
Guys, my name's been Alex, you guys have been
awesome.
Drop a like rating if you've enjoyed the video
- it really helps me massively - and a comment
down below saying "end of video squad" - there
you go, that's a new one - I'll see you guys
in tomorrow's vlog.
Ready?
Adios.
