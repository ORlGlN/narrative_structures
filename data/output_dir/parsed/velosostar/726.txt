floods because Jake of money oh yeah but
2016 is my year so I'm gonna make I'm
gonna I'm gonna try and work a lot this
year but what you've got to do Jacob the
key is separate work and play
so what's that Vella ice cream pizza so
last night I was chilling with my ice
cream and pizza so that was good outside
of Chile now I was having a good time
but in the daytime what was it doing
working yeah so I'm not always working
you have to differentiate the both of
them and you have to have dedicated time
to vote for them that make sense why are
you playing on my phone what's that I
don't even know I have that what the
hell morning guys I've just woken up it
is the first day of 2016 the first
workday of 2016 and I've woken up at
what time is it now sir the time is
11:40 70s synchronize good one a great
way to start off the 2016 first workday
of of the year a few things need to do
today and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
write things down on the board and then
execute them get them done and wipe them
off the board so you know I can write
more down make sure then everything that
I need to do in the first workday of
2016 we've got some tech flow stuff to
do today and yes from the bits and bobs
got me some emails replies some clients
but other than that that's pretty much
it and I'm feeling a bit and what
do I do when I feel you know I do I
go to the gym so let's do this by the
way I hope all of you guys are like
keeping tabs on me doing exercise and
stuff because if I know that you guys
aren't saying Alex what are you doing if
I don't do it then I'll probably won't
do it so you guys need to be like in the
comments like Alex you didn't do the gym
or you didn't go for a run or you
weren't active enough in the vlog be
more active a little and now I will
try honestly
literally right I've just been working
so doing emails came across an email
right and it's literally just blowing me
away it's literally just blowing me away
but it's such a disappointment because I
was looking forward to it so much so
I've got this email here that let me
show you right it says congratulations

the verified badge in your Twitter
account so here's me like jumping around
like holy what the but now now

definitely not fake my question is the
bonus the two four nine or

you guys like the video on techno about
the telephone so you know when you grab
my rice yeah sort a Wi-Fi did you got
more advanced do that before yeah yeah
this is what you buy this isn't a plug
by the way but should you spend money on
this yeah I'm just going to do this it's
the most satisfying thing anyone will
ever do in the life okay there we go
yes it's used to get Wi-Fi in a
conservatory and a route doesn't reach
the conservatory so easy Wi-Fi boost I
think this is exactly what we need
it's just not easy though which is not I
don't know just don't know about anyone
else but that's me in the morning all
right here we go
