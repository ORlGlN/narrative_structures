start off today's vlog we're going to
throw some statistics at you Cystic
number one it's 7:31 a.m. in the morning
statistic number two it's about minus
nine and statistic number three is me
and the boys about to go do some offroad
off-road downhill biking let's do this
oh wait start you morning Wow
whoa look at this place so this is one
of the bungy places where you can
actually jump up and this is only you
jump off but your head actually goes
into the water if the river below it let
you know the bungee jumps where you jump
off the bridge with like a cable
attached to you this is one of those
places now going to let you down I don't
think we're doing it today but we just
come to have a look but yeah that is
sort of what you'll be doing like that
so this is it I'm actually on the bridge
right now it's so weird is all I've ever
seen this place on before is like Devin
Supertramp YouTube videos if you look
down here this is where you actually
drop off
so as to say we're not actually doing
the jumps today we need to plan and book
them to do from later dates but we're
definitely going to be doing like three
or four different ones finally arrived
here in Queenstown it's a hard life look
at that look at that views amazing
why hate it when there's music in the
background I'm trying to vlog there we
go okay cool okay quick room tour aircon
unit lovely balcony with a view of the
mountains got world bar down there
that's what I'm gonna be going tonight
with the boys and then this is the room
nice jinke will bathroom them all shower
yeah I know someone's already probably
commented a probably a few of you have
saying I like to change your goddamn
frickin jumper that's so dirty I don't
know this this thing was literally in
the washing machine yesterday but
because of the the bike riding this
morning it's get absolutely obliterated
so I need to change that now it's been a
super quick stop off at my hotel room to
drop all of my gear off and now I've got
my bag back on my back GoPro is charging
I've got this camera the a7s we're gonna
go on the jet I have no idea what to
expect but this should be really fun
let's go get the boys it's the left here
should I use the stairs I'll use the
stairs I'm petrified of lifts anyway
right floor - okay this is what we're
going on this thing here right now so
this is the bus right here we're at the
on it door very very very fancy
I can feel it I can feel it
it's pressing down on me
I can barely breathe oh can you feel
and I've surrounded
I can feel it I can feel
what I just can't
yeah
so we have just finished the show jest
and it was like beyond amazing it was
just insane one thing
Gus is really like he was so close to
the rocks but I've just quickly whipped
out the a 6300 camera this is like my
backup my backup per vlogging camera if
anything happens to my 7s and well you
probably thinking well Alex then
something must have happened to the a7 s
because you've got out the backup
blogging camera and yeah you correct
I left the a7 s at the jet boat place
the thing that you've just seen is have
a awesome fun time on so I need to go
back and collect that now
you see that I want to get some cookies
that looks awesome with a cookie bar you
get cookies and milk so I want so guys
I'm back retrieved the a7s mark 2 in all
its glory the battery in my microphone
has just turned red which means it's
gonna die very shortly I bought 2
batches with me for the microphone the
one that's in it is lasted like this
entire trip I've been away for like 20

up and away which is insane this
microphone has lasted so goddamn long so
I'm going to change the battery in
