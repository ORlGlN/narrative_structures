morning Logan was happy
yo lightweight just hit those notes bro
okay so uh as you guys know I flew from
Ohio to LA yesterday
normally here in LA how you doing Los
Angeles how you doing LA yeah but I am
only here for a week as you guys know
because I'm shooting this movie into
lands up production got pushed and now I
have a free week here in Los Angeles
which means I can do whatever the I want
for the next week literally I my
schedule is free I can do anything I
could do anything for example I could
dump out frozen bananas I could do that
I could dress up as Donald Trump and
jump around my house I could do that I
could take a teddy bear on a date you
look absolutely fancy I could do that I
couldn't wait until it's night time and
end the vlog right now that's it hope
you enjoyed the vlog see you tomorrow I
could do anything God just kidding just
kidding I can do but before we get all
up into that there's one quick thing
that I want to address what the Oh what
is going on why is my room so messy now
before I left for Atlanta I remember my
roommate mark telling me he cleaned the
house this is not a clean house
apparently he must have met move
everything in the way into Logan's room
I guess what mark gets back today is
almost gonna get their ass beat yeah not
happy about it is my boy glad to be back
in LA I'm talking about so despite my
room being a giant mess something came
in the mail today that I'm pretty stoked
about hmm so this is more than just a
cardboard box do you guys remember the
science experiment that I tried to do on
this channel like a month ago
damn it damn it damn it yeah that was a
total failure giant mega failure here is
what um that was supposed to look like
ah do I that did not happen people I'm
not I'm not a giver-upper dude I don't
give up easy so your boy went online
your boy worked hard he did his research
to try and fix the problem that happened
with my experience so uh nerd time in my
experiment I think the hydrogen peroxide
that I used was not concentrated enough
meaning basically there was like too
much water in it so being the total
chach that i am i went online and bought
some extremely corrosive hydrogen
peroxide ha ha ha let me tell you this
is not easy to find at all but I got it
and I'm open it up and again
so this kit is 35% hydrogen peroxide
compared to the 3% hydrogen peroxide
that I use the first time clearly much
stronger and much better I'm gonna do
this in a small scale first just in like
a tiny cup and nicker works later today
we're gonna make it massive again let me
just reiterate I have no idea what I'm
doing I'm just a boy with a fluffy wool
hat who likes to glow stop look okay so
I know you probably won't you just
trying to explain anyway how this is
gonna work first I'm going to put water
in the glass and then a tablespoon of
potassium permanganate then I'm gonna
dump a little dish soap in that and stir
it up nice and swishy imma fill a
separate glass with hydrogen peroxide
then dump the potassium permanganate
solution in a bottle and then I'm going
to dump the hydrogen peroxide into this
bottle and hopefully something happens
that alone okay
here we go yo yo yo yo what happened
yeah why is it sieving cuz I'm freaking
out oh god is coming off the counter oh
hi yo it's warm why is it warm oh god is
it burning my hand oh oh oh oh my gosh
and it's still coming out of the top yo
what just happened right now at first it
would didn't do anything and all sudden
they just started exploding on itself
oh god I feel like my hands melting hey
okay so that just happened uh not really
sure what happened but it did I guess
the next move would just be to do this
but on like a much larger scale just
about to go down oh I'm hungry though
I'm gonna go get a meal that I've missed
for a while now you can probably guess
what it is
Gainesville game good good give you
though my god I miss this thing and Oh
umbrellas falling so that's another
thing let's talk about why it's raining
in Los Angeles
I'm so sorry Gainesville yo I'm
literally about disabilities oh my foot
okay so sorry guys my game boy just
crushed it and this is a disaster yo see
this is the kind of problems that rain
causes oh hey guys yeah don't mind me
I'm just I'm just eating my games Bowl
yeah do check this out it's raining and
everyone's freaking out why Los Angeles
why how about that rainbows good talked
about that rain young lady
good talk okay apparently I'm the only
one that's freaking out great oh okay so
I'm at the store right now looking for a
bottle for that solution to explode out
I think it works so well the time I just
did it because the top of the bottle was
smaller than the base of the bottle and
it made it like more explodey I don't
know it's just a guess okay I'm not a
scientist in the mean time I did it
again trying out different amounts of
like soap and potassium and I got my
friend wampas reaction so here is that
is our genius emerging oh I don't trust
you oh gosh did you right subscribe I
did my friends yeah but you forgot to be
so it just says subscribe and forgot to
be I'm sorry man okay here we go
oh I smell I smell monarch dogs bad
let's talk about why my room is a mess
mark mark my room is the mess I'm here
doing science experiments learning and
teach you to kid something and you're
just messing on my room that's a better
fuckin bad roommate a bad roommate every
way bear roommates good to see you
brother
okay what is this probe does it kind of
stuff you get in the mail well I get
cool attraction are you closed up the
mail I get hydrogen peroxide in the mail
we got someone emailed me a while ago
and then just getting jealous dude send
me some guys dude I redid the experiment
using the loo hydrogen peroxide
did it work why don't I show you steamy
it's hot - dude you could roast
marshmallows how many times have you
done this this is the third why just
keep doing cuz I'm going bigger and
bigger every time meaning we got one
more run left now we should probably do
it here so the cleanup process for this
is not the most fun and while I was
cleaning up I'm cleaning and I feel this
like burning sensation on my leg not
good
in fact probably bad and so I go to look
at it I accidentally did not see that
there was like a piece of soap like
still on my leg and burned a hole in me
so that's cool yeah yeah this hurts
really bad oh my I guess this is the
part of the vlog where I should say I do
not try this at home please do not try
this at home yo so mark is scrolling
through Facebook and look what shows up
on his profile yo it's a side road this
is a sorrow yeah bro yeah no dude they
are doing something they did not tell us
about like that's not what happens clear
alive minute crap and we've been
finished it's gonna be so worth it
though here's the problem right here I
poured the hydrogen peroxide too slow
into the bottle check out - slow - too
low watch watch again I'm still pouring
right here as you can see as it's coming
up that's no bueno see this is like it
because it starts reacting immediately
we just got to find a way to put all the
hydrogen peroxide in there as quick as
we can a few moments later yeah bro yeah
bro so I glued around the edges there aw
thanks for pointing for me mark I
appreciate you I glued around the edges
here with a hot glue gun so as you can
see this is super janky I have no idea
if it's gonna work hopefully it does
because we're gonna be pouring water and
potassium permanganate and all sorts of
liquid down in here there okay
yeah that's the thing mark hates messes
and I only see a messes coming out of
this by the way Johannes feel it's cuz
it's you for the blog you're not poor if
form is wet see yeah that's gonna be an
issue yeah that's gonna be an issue
that's gonna be a big issue ha ha ha ok
it's almost game time we have to set up
here we got the tube in the middle we
got the plastic on the floor to prevent
four messes mark I know you like that
good talk Hannes we're on the woodsy
marking is onesie good talk and I'm in
my onesie pickle like oh come on mark
look Marty made a big mess here you're
gonna make a bigger mess I live here too
you can't just do this I can let's get
one thing straight I can't do this this
morning I made love to a teddy bear oh
my gosh baby you look so delicious mmm
hey easy bro a box man this can be the
dopest science experiment ever performed
in onesies ever eyes first get up in the
water in the bucket easy
here goes well next time we got the good
ingredient testing for Megan a quick you
mind you I am NOT like measuring this
I'm literally just eyeballing everything
there are so many things I can go wrong
during this experiment but the last
ingredient is the dish dish so yeah I
mean I Oh bro this is nice and mixi dude
nice and steady
this is looking good ladies and
gentlemen I'm just wondering if your hot
glue job over here on this freaking
pillar that's gonna work
- bro I don't think so either it's just
gonna all leak out or gonna be screwed
I'm so sorry mark I'm thinking ahead so
we're going to do the hydrogen peroxide
before we actually publish mouthing over
that that seems like enough nope
please Logan nope it's going YouTube
this is a test in itself because again
the hot glue I was going to hold fingers
garage what up boys what boys what up
boys so far so good boy so far so good
Oh
Oh
what easy oh my god it's steaming bro
it's still going how hot is it yo its
hot bro pull you know that worked too
well bro yo this is amazing hahaha yes
science screen add up you idiot
oh is leaking here this is a problem uh
okay guys so with a successful
experiment and the successful clean up
as you can see that wraps today's vlog
oh that was dope here are the lessons
we've learned today so one never give up
kids that was once a failed experiment
turned into something sick and - ah
forget it let me think about real quick
oh yeah uh uh you know science is dope I
will say the cleanup is not quite done
yet as you can see we're gonna worry
about that later
