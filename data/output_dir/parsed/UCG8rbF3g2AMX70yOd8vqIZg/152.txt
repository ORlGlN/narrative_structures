smuggler and this is that's what I'm

my jewelry is literally worth more than

spending my money and smarter things
this is getting stupid bro this is
getting ridiculous look well look if you
make money and you havin fun buy jewelry
good when you die you can't take money
with you that's all right you know what
we need to do but what we need to just
walk around Hollywood and just like
damn sexy I swear swear swear I swear I
got a leash my gosh why I swear I've
never felt this qualified in sexy eating
burgers kids I also I just want to say
life is not about material objects and I
I am aware that in my vlogs especially
recently I may be like making it look
like that no that's that's not what it's
about
I find my happiness my joy comes from
the high of doing stuff that I shouldn't
be doing I II spending way too much
money on grilled it's just a bonus that
they look cool but be safe no I mean yes
be safe but be responsible with your
money that's what I'm trying to say cuz
if now you become poor and die
everyone's gonna do it and according to
the stats on Google you might die ten
years earlier than me I'm gonna kill you
before me so I don't care oh hey hi no
we outside George's house right now I
can't barking it outside that we're
gonna take my own questions or hurting
my head Brooke sure sure I take em up
now show me you thrown in the garbage
higher yeah favors not wasting your
money on jewelry that you makes you look
like a rapper from the West oh I had
this conversation with the low gang
already dude y'all listen I come if they
did with the light here I said it's not
about material object just make me throw
my 10 does not run in the trash it's
$10,000 whoa
I'm sorry I'm gonna throw this out there
why does your boy look like post Malone
Hughes been waiting to hear that
sentence his whole life you know my
brother that was a weird thing having a
housewarming party bro woman party Paul
okay
Ferran has one bite but we want you to
come bring all your friends who are we
we can't afford $10,000 grills new Gucci
brother my turning in listen little no
quick little message of inspiration
growing up I worked as hard as I
possibly could whenever I was put to the
test I would challenge myself my I would
challenge myself and I would make sure
that I am giving everything that I put
my heart into 100% effort I'm fortunate
enough to say that obviously it has paid
dividends in my life and all has allowed
me to do the through crazy shoes that I
do now including buy some dumbass grills
and and jewelry and stuff that I really
don't need that's a fact but the point
is fricking grinded bro still now
everyday grind grind grind working
extremely hard and I'm able to now
afford these luxuries so don't think it
comes easy one day it's gonna happen for
you just put your head down humble
yourself and work as hard as you can I'm
a believer in the idea that if you do
good things good things will happen to
you so I am down to spend $30,000 now at
this point
my roommate Evan he's not a boy he's my
best friend and I know one day he's
gonna return the favor or maybe it comes
back around full circle and someone else
does something nice for me the point is
when you're doing well
treat yourself treat others because when
one squad member feasts the whole crew
foods that hive mentality we're all on
the same team we're all on the same
families what we do baby it's the low
gang if you're not a part of the family
make sure to subscribe being maverick
because every day we're changing the
world
