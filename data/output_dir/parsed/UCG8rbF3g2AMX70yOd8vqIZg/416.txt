I'm touched by your guys story and I
know you guys have about six days left
in your GoFundMe page and yourself some
money to raise so I want to pay the
remaining balance
I don't wanna write you guys check for
$8,000 and pay the remainder of little
Logan's medical bills
good morning low gangs for the current
time is 746 a.m. mark and I flew to
Eugene Oregon
late last night and we are so anxious
right now like the most exercise I've
ever been we barely slept last night
like four hours and that is because this
might be the most significant vlog I
will ever make in my life
f this vlog goes beyond entertainment it
goes beyond getting to live my crazy
life with you guys and experiencing
really cool things but this is by far
the coolest thing I do this alone Deb
the coolest thing I've ever done but we
have somewhere to be so I'm gonna walk
and talk but here's what's going down
but so my manager Jeffery has Google
alerts on for my name Logan pod is a
fact effect PS Jeff way to go keeping
tabs on me smart last week Jeff got a
Google Alert for a GoFundMe page under
the name of Logan Paul now that's my
name so I decided to check it out
because I was intrigued wait is the same
name as you that's what I'm saying
or were they just trying my boys got
this sick no no the same name dawg
oh so it wasn't like I'm trying to use
low no no no his name is Logan Paul so
your boy started reading this page and I
was immediately touched appropriately
so here is three-month-old Logan Paul
quite possibly the cutest little dude
I've ever seen in my life I know he was
much cuter than I was when I was a baby
so I continued reading this article and
I was heartbroken to discover that
little Logan Paul has had some serious
life-threatening medical problems and to
add to that his family's insurance money
hasn't kicked in yet because they just
moved to Oregon okay that's not good the
family has received a ton of support
from other family members on friends
they've managed to raise about eleven
thousand six hundred and five dollars in
19 days but unfortunately are still
short about eight thousand three hundred
and ninety five dollars from their
$20,000 goal now before I say anything
else I just wanna point out we're
literally driving in the middle of
nowhere I have no idea where we are all
I have been seeing for the past hour
driving is just woods and fog lots of
fog I am so excited for this video guys
I've been planning this for like a week
we are finally out here in Oregon I
could not be sleeping like Mark is now
I'm trying to contain my excitement yeah
where
one last thing on their donation page
the person who set it up for the family
wrote this anyone who knows this family
knows the love and kindness they show
everyone Lindsey and Nick are deeply
committed to their children and
spreading love in this world for all of
the support and kindness they have shown
others in the past now the needs have
been returned well Lindsey neck today
you're going to get your support let's
go nervous yes I am nervous and I don't
know why I don't know why I'm nervous
what I'm nervous I didn't

right now

you're right how are you Lindsay
Logan nice to meet you hi did the head
yeah
that's little Logan Paul yeah yo I love
his hat I have a very similar hat this
has got to be the cutest baby I've ever
seen well and what why does he take
selfie so well why why I'm looking at
these baby selfies I'm like oh my gosh
I want to know about this little guy
right here like what little what is what
has been happening three weeks ago today
actually he was not feeling well for a
week he wasn't showing any signs of
being severely sick like he was i nursed
him and then he looked like he was gonna
throw up so I kind of did this with him
for a minute
step back down on my bed put him in my
arms and I looked down at him and he
wasn't responding his eyes were open and
he like wasn't responding at all and so
I freaked out and I started screaming
for Nick to call 9-1-1 brought him out
here and I gave him to Nick and he came
to Nick got him to come to sorry most
fun like this scariest email and it was
he conscious at this point I kind of
just go into shock like something's
wrong with my baby yeah I didn't check
his pulse and check to see if he was
breathing I just knew that he wasn't
responding to me and his eyes were like
open and really scary I just knew
something was wrong with my baby
that was all Saturday three weeks ago
three weeks ago
after that has there been progress or
did they find out that the like is there
a definition of the problem they started
taking his blood and doing tests and
asking more questions and they found
that he was born with like essentially a
bubble in his bladder the bubble caused
a block so that urine was just barely
leaking what happened was the urine
builds up and stays in there and then
becomes infected so you were in the
hospital for 12 days and you didn't
leave yeah that's a lot of days to be in
the hospital I would do absolutely
anything for my children and to see your
child fighting for their life is like
the V scariest thing you could ever
imagine
and so I can barely set it down and walk
away this is so great something that's
gonna happen and I won't be there to
save them he'll probably be right here
for the next 18 years haha on your
shoulder just like that well let me tell
you something he's gonna grow up and be
this big does this happen my bothering
me yeah but um I definitely hear you I
seriously admire your bravery encouraged

time
um I'm touched by your guys story I
can't say I know exactly why but I feel
like a weird connection to it beyond
just I was having the same name like I
read it and the stuff your cousin said
about you on the go fund me page just
like you can tell you guys have such a
good heart and I really really believe
in that the human spirit and I know you

GoFundMe page and yourself some money to

incredibly generous of course as

yo that was one of the coolest things
I've ever done in my life dude like the
energy in the room was so incredible and
what boggles my mind is that there are
so many families struggling so many
families struggling that was one family
in the middle of Oregon giving back is
amazing if you like do your best to give
back man positive reinforcement equals
success and when you do nice things or
tell people nice things I believe that
good things are bound to have that said
