time right now yeah I don't even know
what yellow looks like you don't know a
little afraid you don't know what these
colors are
Dog Pound the Knux what ah I had to show
you okay so this test has been my
nightmare ever since I was a kid and I
first discovered I was colorblind
basically they give you these little
dots and he put a number inside and you
have to guess the number
I'll not guess I was thinking you you
tell them what you see I'm a certain
type of colorblindness for example I can
see this too now it's three okay one
correct
you'll see anything I don't see anyway
it's a four that was also tough yeah I
don't know I don't know
mild Outen what does that mean what is
it you Tong do tons are people with
Deuter anomaly a type of red-green color
blindness in which the green scum cones
do not detect enough green and our to
sense of two yellows oranges and reds so
what does that mean you're too sensitive
to yellows and oranges like you can't
see them I mean like it's an it's when
colors blend so like your birds just one
color to you what your bird is just one
color yeah to you what what you're
saying but it's like four different
colors he's all those colors he's orange
red yellow maverick yeah my bird your
bird maverick whose burden we'll be
talking about maverick is yellow by his
whole body oh man I know there's a lot
of like curing colorblindness with these
glasses type videos on the Internet I
have not seen any of them so I'm not
really sure how to make mine there's a
lot I could do I think yeah I could I
could go super emotional with it
I've lived my whole life pretending to
be a normal kid but I can't hide anymore
I Logan Paul and colorblind imagine
living in a world without color where
blues green and green is white and black
is red and yellow is fuchsia
I thought LeBron James was a white guy
they made me stare at those little dots
and told me there were numbers inside
but I didn't see matters
I only saw failure and little dots today
for the first time I'm going to see the
world today is the day I see color if I
did not want to do that I could just
make it really simple and call it as I
see it I can't say I think what I'm
gonna do is put them on and see the
beautiful world around me um see the
beautiful world around me wearing the
glasses of course ha ha ha ha I guess I
don't know I guess it's time all right
we're out here on Hollywood Boulevard as
you can see we are out here we're out
here you are here easy I'm using one of
the red walls down there I'm going to
show you guys how I see color but how
are we gonna see what you see
could you edit the video from you like
change the saturation yeah but how do I
know what you see what's good so guys

this so let's try these less Sun yet
