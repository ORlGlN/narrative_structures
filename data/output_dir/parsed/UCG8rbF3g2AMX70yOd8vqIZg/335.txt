good morning ok what's up so yo it's
actually not the morning it is the night
before I would typically start this vlog
but here's what happened so I came back
from set a 13-hour day as you guys know
and said I hate the gym and not just hit
the gym I hit the gym for two hours bro
straight up I don't know what came over
me but I was so savvy that I literally
worked out so hard I popped blood
vessels in my shoulder you see these
purple marks yeah oh look look I popped
the blood vessels in my shoulder this is
not a drill this is not Photoshop I'll
say it again blood vessels in my
shoulder we're pop if you're watching
this around family or friends or
somewhere quiet I apologize I'm Way too
hyper right now but I think it's
important because the day that I would
typically start this vlog tomorrow is a
big day there's a lot of stuff going on

on Dubai's biggest radio show and then
I'm going to a concert at night I'm
