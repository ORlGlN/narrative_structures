gonna be alone gonna be perfect back to
the movie ok it is called superstition
it will be the biggest most legit
project I've ever done to this date
actually that is only kind of sort of
true airplane mode is my biggest project
just because I wrote it produced it and
starred in it which is like a huge thing
in itself what this movie has like tons
of like actual traditional actors in it
it's going to theaters it's a big-budget
movie like most of the stuff that I do
like the thinning for example and for
some those are those are called digital
project traditional being like film
television movie theater digital being
stuff you watched on you know your phone
or a computer but enough of the
educational process I'm not you teach
jesus this is amazing I'm sorry I got
distracted but yeah the movie is called
superstition my character's name is
Preston and you guys are never gonna
believe this but he's a hugger dude
hahaha so that's sort of true sorta kind
of true he's uh he does Facebook live
