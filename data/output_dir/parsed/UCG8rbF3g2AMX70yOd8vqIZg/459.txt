so I told you guys I had a free day off
and because of that reason I'm like yo
let's do something fun so today since my
life is super exciting we are gonna do
something really fun so the first item
on the agenda is I'm gonna test uh
different flavors of peanut butter on
sticks of celery Wow crazy that so sick
but there's a twist
I got raisins baby we make an ants on a
log
somebody is hot man Hanson love you put
peanut butter on sticks of celery you
put raisins on looks like ants on a log
it's very self-explanatory and delicious
I don't really have a choice in doing
this and Mexican took my breakfast this
morning and now I'm left it with this so
let's get started shall we
we were twerking with
when we got better peanut butter I'm not
even sure of his peanut butter Iraq a
lie to you but apparently it's better
dude this is yet not even beautiful er
almond butter okay and three okay I
didn't do my research I just got almond
butter or whatever the physics rip up
one stick of celery rip off two sticks
of celery
we got one stick of celery for each
peanut butter but this is the most
exciting thing I've done all day pro
frickin half right now I was a fun bro
I'm looking at these and I'm seeing the
consistency is a bit uh if you get
different for each one start mixing up
giving that little slush mess Oh the
thing about almond butter is that I
notice it's a bit more the liquidity is
a high your than peanut butter let's
give this first one a go huh what do you
say folks let's start spreading some
better I mean I'm a pretend I'm a
pretend it's gonna be a nice convenience
cut ready okay here we go with the
almond butter let's do it what okay cool
we arranged this camera who cares why
are you watching me spread fever my nose
not just that means goodnight in espanol
action I'm gonna go ahead and spread
these and we're gonna do a nice little
speed time-lapse thing and then when cut
to the final product before we put the
ants on the law here we go go up every
yeah time to put these ants on the log
I'm telling you my life cannot get more
exciting than right now I'm at the peak
of my career I'm so happy
let's put the ants on the log true gonna
attach these out one by one give a
little bite and then uh I know you guys
wait for which which peanut butter
tastes the best
so this one is a one of the almond
butters let's give this a go out so that
was for lack of a better term horrible
okay take two we're gonna try another of
almond butter here we go hopefully this
one's a little better than the last

little bit of
here here we go come on come on better
