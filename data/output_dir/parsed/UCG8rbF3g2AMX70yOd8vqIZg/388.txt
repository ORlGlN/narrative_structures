so hard for me in this upcoming year so
back to the chair okay here I am back in
the chair let's go oh my God my stomach
so full
20:17 is the year of fitness for me
starting tomorrow
January 1st by the time this vlog is out
it will have begun I'm talking pure
savagery I'm talking working out nearly
every day at least six days a week
eating healthy every single day straight
fitness straight healthy lifestyle and I
said this I said the same thing last
year and I didn't end up following
through with it and I've made a point
not to make a video about it and tell
you guys I was going to do it if I
didn't 100% meaning I am so serious
about this I am so serious about living
a completely 100% healthy fit lifestyle
and I'm not going to break the promise
on you guys I know that if I post this
video on the internet I'm gonna do it
you've noticed I've avoided doing like
oh 30 day workout you on 60 because I'm
I don't trust my mental state but for
the past two months I have been mentally
preparing to do this I am so ready I am
going to take 2017 by the throat and
strangling little too aggressive I get
in again and that is gonna be one of the
hardest things that I've ever had to do
the hard part is you know finding time
to work out when I'm traveling always
having to eat healthy and one of my
friends want to go out and eat no I
can't do this are you guys I have to eat
like a salad and a piece of chicken the
hard part is gonna be giving up food
like this like delicious food you guys I
love food like it is one of my favorite
things on earth look at this rope
Johannes we did not even put a dent in
this my man you didn't even eat your
pizza bro I had so many burgers you're
being a bigger head bitch bro what I'm
saying is I find pleasure in eating food
and now with this challenge I'm going to
have to find my pleasure in different
ways this takes a mental preparation
persistence dedication and I've spent
the last like month just training my
mind for 2017 I'm gonna go so huh cause
when I put my mind to something I do it
nine hundred percent I am going to go so
hard and then here's the even bigger
announcement I Logan Paul I'm going to
train for the 2020 Olympics this is not
a joke this is not a drill I am going to
train for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics
Hey hi I'm pretty fast I read the
hundred meter dash when I was in eighth
grade and I was like the fastest kid in
all of Ohio for my age and that was when
I was a little bitch bow before puberty
and I didn't even have muscles I was
like 5 foot and then I raced a kid the
other day and I beat his ass I was like
yo I can I can go to the Olympics and
now that I have this inkling of a dream
of a goal I really want to go to Tokyo
in 2020 and my brother Jake Paul wants
to go to Tokyo too he wants to run the
400 meter sprint I want to do the
hundred meter and we're both gonna
literally train to qualify for the
Olympics that is gonna be my anchor the
thing that fuels me and I'm going to try
my very best to make it happen how cool
would it be if I could be an actor and
entertainer eight and not really a
singer but sort of singer a dancer
well actually just kidding I suck at
dancing a chach a social media star
everything and then Olympian yo.hannes
is the fitness master and he's gonna
have he's gonna be the one kind of drew
driving me through this huh that's
that's it like to see me okay well the

little cheesy and inspirational here

achieve a goal with you

such good shape and I want to know what
it looked like before so let's do it
okay so I am uh I'm in decent shape
I'm granted I just ate but I saw I'm an
okay shape right but and I know because
I know I was a very long you're already
so

a cocky you can always be better
you can always be better you should
always have that mindset and I'm like
y'all I'm okay but I I know where I
could be and it's scary compared to what
I am now at one point in my life you
