birdie we're friends wow you're an
asshole
really I don't have any socks like oh
yeah I have all these like colorful
socks but life is not a joke all the
time so it's just one of those days man
just one of those days I'm struggling

shoes and short shorts none of the above
makes sense
ah I was this shut up it's not today on
YouTube red oh oh yeah this is how I
pull my hair Lajja blast me so cuz they
shut you a straight person I'll chop
this ah perfect
so today I want to try to go and find a
billboard for the thinnest legendary
told me that they had put up a couple of
billboards around the city so I already
go try to find one today so that's cool
also let me just point out how right I
was about these socks I can't be wearing
these white socks with the rest of this
outfit man I look like a total chachi
bro
I'm running late as usual no one told me
that the doctor's office was an hour
away in Santa Monica but have no fear
being a young millennial I have a little
thing that helps me save time that is
called a hoverboard
go fast
good guys guys guys uh look how good
this looks oh my gosh yeah I know one
who told me that this guy was an hour to
Santa Monica we're gonna get real close
man
me and you got a touched it's just the
tip a few moments later he saw me that
crazy could have touched tip tip why go
to the doctor Logan well funny you asked
okay so a while ago uh while I was
shooting my show called Logan Paul
versus one of the episodes diverse a
luchador it's like basically a Mexican
WWE wrestler luchador threw me the wrong
way and I landed on my knee and I'm
pretty sure like popped or tore
something that's why when I workout I
don't know if you've noticed I'm doing
the elliptical like I should be on the
treadmill I mean young kid I shouldn't
be worrying about my joints or should I
point is I like jogging on the treadmill
and I wasn't able to got thrown by
luchador hurt my knee really bad and
finally like a month later I'm finally
here to visit the doctors see what the
verdict is hopefully it's nothing too
bad but we will find out
how did the injury occur it says ah got
thrown by a luchador I hope I don't die
there's a thing about coming to the
doctor's office I don't like it I don't
like it
I've been here all too many times five
in five surgeries and I'm 21 years old
no plain old oh wait but it's okay you
know sometimes in life you get up you
tell hiccups but you got it you gotta
just keep going keep going down that
road
hey what's up man what's up a solo for
an extra nice boat you guys to meet you
yeah
we said I was gonna die guys just
kidding fake tears actor life hashtag oh

haha I'm fine I'm fine I sprained my MCL
my MCL is sprained which if you don't
know what that means
neither do I so I can't explain
point is it hurts but it's getting
better slowly but surely and then I
might may have tore my meniscus
but but but but it's slowly healing so
I'm just gonna keep doing my thang and
then we're just gonna see what happen
for now that I just keep living my life
