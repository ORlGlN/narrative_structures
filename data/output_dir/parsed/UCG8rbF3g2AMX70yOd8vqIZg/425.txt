stuck-up hey now it's time to tell you
guys why 2016 has been the year of
internet destruction drone time look I
started this vlog channel which got 1.4
million subscribers in three months on
Facebook we hit 1.5 billion views in the
year of 2016 by Facebook views don't
count right 1.1 billion 10-second views
let's go cause let's go and that's not
all you're ready for rapid fire I lost
my mind for seven days at Burning Man
swam in a pool of popcorn hung off a
building watched leo win the Oscar went
skydiving spoke at Harvard Business
School about airplane mode and met
Michael Phelps met Terry Crews did a
movie with Terry Crews called where's
the money starring my good friend King
batch met the rock twice today yeah you
built an igloo in California saved
little Logan all hung off more buildings
tilted the kangaroo on the beach are you
kidding me right now
watch my Cleveland Cavaliers win the NBA
championship made a viral video made
another viral video made a lot of viral
videos starting a YouTube red series
called foursome let a tarantula crawl on
my face how the 200-pound alligator
snapping turtle got strangled by a snake
and made it on 60 minutes prepare to
enter scene
now looking back at this whirlwind of a
year there are three things that I have
come to value above all else
one is the hustle every successful
person will tell you that hard work is
the number one key to success
to experience travel as much as you can
ask questions stay curious say yes to
everything and immerse yourself in life
the world will teach you things a
classroom never could three
relationships and your friends surround
yourself with people that make you happy
and people that make you a better person
and with that said there is only one
thing left to say my goal in life is at
the end of every single year I can stand
here and say this has been the greatest
yeah
you
