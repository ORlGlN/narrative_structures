explain what we're trying to do we're
going to try to do something
marisol adult we're trying to adult plan
is we go to the store we make we get
food we turn back here and we cook a
meal for not yourself
that's just us not just the boys but
listen ladies do day I'm excited because
this is where I'm going to pick up my
materials from my Pringles Jim yeah I
make you bring go to jail all the girls
here are going to be like yellow Jesus
how you never said Jam bro which would
be like dude I don't know but I did it
to be honest oh dude there is an issue
who are bringing a girl George is
bringing a girl Johan I know girls we
have to part of it dude but how we just
like I know you got drills on Locke I
thought summer and you're like oh shoot
summer I know you watch my blog so make
sure you like and subscribe and also do
I think so mobile probation so I just
scrubbed my body with warm water and a
small enclosed space most people call it
a shower and we are about to leave but
I'm guessing a lot of people are like
Logan where does this infatuation with
making jelly Pringle Jam come from why
do you want to do this Logan you guys I
didn't know I actually do have an
explanation
you guys remember my boy Hayden the
british-led we saw in Paris please send
me this link you saw on a website called
imager very popular website if you
hadn't heard of it go now I'm just
kidding I don't know why I said that
it's kind of aggressive I just got some
listen bro give me a brick Mike the
touch was slow anyway you'll see here it
says I made jam out of Pringles and
here's some Pringles and apparently this
is the jams I scroll down I read the
directions it is what pisses guy
apparently he was upset that this label
on the Pringles cans said you don't just
eat them you GM he perceives to say like
yo I don't know what that means
how do you Jam Pringles it's not like
they make good guitar picks he's got a
point and he deduced that the only
logical conclusion was that they're made
for actual Jam now that's probably not
what they meant at all like and this man
might be opportunity but on the other
end of the spectrum is man could be a
fucking genius look if you can make jam
out of Pringles you can make jam out of
anything or hey look I keep scrolling
here and like he has steps did he have
solutions blenders and stuff and then he
actually does it at the end so we're
going to try this today I'm going to
pick up the ingredients when we go to
the store and speaking of that maja if
you moments late
oh the boys are entering the store is
the most interesting grocery store I've
ever seen in my life I've actually never
been here what is this this is my vegan
place longer vegan oh this is your spot
it's my spot okay cool whoa whoa whoa
easy boy after you looking at sausage oh
wait wait then for anybody
no that's vegan sausage thank you yo
you're putting so much effort in all
this and it was all out of focus or I'm
gonna play a game see how well mark
knows is produce what is this this would
be no no radishes let's beat on it right
there he's right Organic Kobe I don't
know what happened that doesn't make
sense
I've been lied to bro literally says
organic Easter Egg radishes dude yo come
on bro life is bullshit and now we doin
bro so that is so massive really
whispers bottom you broke the tip dude
how did you only break the tips of these
potato things damage for good and put
this one back oh my god you are such a
dummy mark I give it another like five
minutes before I'm either a ass ass stop
filming or be they skip that step and
just kick us out gonna keep it down huh
are you talking that accent I guarantee
no one's kicking us out okay see that's
okay that's terrifying I don't like that
this is the golden egg talking shake
what oh shit all right this is a move
right here bro prime boneless rib eye
steak powers 3 a 3 prime bone-dry prized
moment your art stick or fortunately
this place does not have Pringles I'm
hoping they might have the other
ingredients like the secret ingredient
to this Jam it's a little thing called
pectin apparently that's what makes it
like jammy again I'm not really sure
okay using my context clues I see
assignments of baking powder some flour
right seems like it could be the right
section pectin pectin where are you
buddy boy oh my gosh yes Pomona's
universal back cells with low amounts of
any sweetener that was actually a lot
easier than I thought oh that's one like
Amazon but nope
we're organic vegan please cook it off
by the way just so you guys know when I
vlog in public everyone stares at me you
can imagine why probably because I look
like a chicken running around with his
head cut off every quarter tried to sort
all I can't did want to just kind of
tell me right now he must've saw you and
he hated my blog
hi I'm Donna saw you just came in Kobe
right now I'm playing said oh okay I
well I'm done
look okay we are out of store that I
does have Pringles I'm checking them out
right here the only issue although the
fingers are here is that I've been
kicked out of the store twice there's
got to be kind of low-key hey Logan Paul
mark they literally have me on a hit
list here what flavor do we make Pringle
Jam it's a cheddar and sour cream ranch
cheddar cheese sour cream and onion
bb2 c/bb BBQ that was the one that using
the example ink because we don't want to
make any mistakes we are going to do the
barbecue right barbecue jam this seems
weird to me but I we don't rock it back
at the crib oh yo you laughed me earlier
you know what I'm using this for Pringle
Jam bitch jam out of Pringles what do
you make of it happy see yo learn from
this girl bro she loves my ideas and
accepts me the first step I'm kind of
just winging in here is to crush all oh
well is the crust all the sprinkles why
are you gonna do everything so
recklessly you could easily just put
those hot why you come on roll can you
just let me make my dear what's the
difference between jelly and jam I'm in
a jam I don't know nice pun George you
know there was been yelling yeah you can
tell you they can do
I found out pretty quickly my fist was
not sufficient enough to crush these so
I'm using one of marks potatoes thanks
brothers and I love the honest review
mark I don't think a lot of people
understanding I don't even understand
myself bring cold quran so we're going
to go ahead and talk in the blender here
flex while you do it
yeah looks nice this could be so not a
thing and someone just trolling the
internet we're gonna give it a go yeah
whether the difference between a jelly
and damn I couldn't tell you I could you
can't jelly a Dinka numbers we're gonna
add in the water oh yeah don't forget
the potato I don't know if you need ever
do what about a potato oh my god
beautiful on the website said this part
doesn't smell the greatest to see
confirmed yes yes
my god show that we had maybe it's just
you now we were going to add the pectin
they did not give me an amount I'm just
going to give the old eyeball it was
everyone stop imploring Factory in
everyone shut up effectively I think
that's good here we go here we go okay
got a mix up the sections here we go
here we go you flip you okay mix exactly
now
oh hi Lee said I'm in good shape
get up later on yeah they're online
yeah we're good this is exactly what
mine looks like all right next up we got
a sugar so I'm setting this to a boil
and then we're going to add in this to
just change sugar yes please I just want
to reiterate one final times there are
no measurements on this website so when
we pour in the sugar it's just kind of
like a fingers frosting that it's
working you think it is highly do you
believe in me my bros and believe you're
marking just on my way yeah I'm gonna
cook a dinner no you are you serious
I didn't do it on 70 advice ah here put
the sugar in and then the boil no no no
oh that's a lot you know I feel like
jelly and jam requires a lot of students
doing mix it around yeah no this is
actually work and do do you like we need
more sugar than that yeah I'm putting a
more sugar
all of my friends laughed at me when I
told them what I want to do this morning
and look this is legit book so I took it
off the cool right now but look it's
like lumpy and and just it's a little
liquidy but I think it's good it looks a
little bit like honey right oh but it
looks good though dude brinjal jam Jam

marmalade whatever it is in the fridge
or freezer which is what I did a club
