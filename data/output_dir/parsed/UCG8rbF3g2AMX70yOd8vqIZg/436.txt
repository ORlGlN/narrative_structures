soup now maybe you won't be a dick about
taking out the trash yeah so both
yourself today we are going to our
friends house
the Dudesons house to build a Glu's now
we live in California there is no snow
let me show you see no snow no signs of
snow no signs of ice anywhere however we
do have this savage Street doesn't
really have anything to do with anything
but condos are more condoms on a tree
though so our friends I believe are
getting ice blocks shipped to their
house the Iceman Cometh at which point I
will make an igloo like my father
wait Logan what I don't get that
reference oh you didn't know you didn't
know that my dad was on the news for
building an igloo in Ohio roll the clip
great Paul loves the outdoors and
decided to build an igloo and now has a
wine rack a candle and a deerskin rug I
think everybody should should spend time
in Eagle at least once it's invigorating
ha ha ha yeah bro I can be an Eskimo but
before we do that your boy is hungry
your boy needs food in his stomach
I got my games ball good good good good
great yo this thing is looking beautiful
that's always I will say though I had
some technical difficulties with my
hoverboard trying to get there a little
hoverboard want to go for a ride
whoa whoa easy easy easy whoa ba ba yep
yep got a demon hoverboard that's cool
why's it doing that you enjoying your
games bull Marc I am thank you so much I
got you bro let's smash together
roommates you gangs together smash
together Cheers my boy really did that
once but whoa that's not gonna make the
cut when you laugh so hard you choke on
your own spittle and die hashtag
relatable or should I say hashtag pocket
whoa been a while but I'm a foot high I
watch water oh he knows a building
nickel ooh
do you support me yes ah B I'm sorry you
can't come buddy you're just a bird you
don't have hands
how you gonna carve an igloo so we are
on our way to the Dudesons house they
told me um to be there at 10:00 a.m.
right it's a 2 p.m. yeah yeah they
pushed you back for hours marketing
you're salty I know I'll dude listen
you're sick ok you can get over it take
a couple pills you'll be fine
oh you just want me to take a chill pill
all right everyone
to feel most bad for mark though cuz
he's a little sick and he could have
been using these four hours to sleep you
know this is true
are you salty but how about this we
build the igloo you sleep inside it huh
how's it warm what blue worm
Jason igloo really hot I find that
unlikely oh yeah leaking puddle more
leaking puddles and some snow prime
signs of ice oh yeah bro
that's my boy why you got chainsaws cuz
right that's what we're doing would tap
you up but you got chainsaws your hands
my dad my father built an igloo once but
you're like you have it in your blood
that's what I'm saying bro yeah you look
like an Eskimo yeah bro all the way from
my last time American Alaska is in
America something to think about
oh snap this is legit never see snow in
California actually no you're sick bro I
feel bad ah I got you bro that's my
roommate bras support you and your
sickness let's go so these are what
we're gonna be making the igloo out of
you've been carving these gotta watch
you carve this one
my guy is going hard is from good almost
got a do it bro
someone's got to cut the ice sold I have
the honor I'm laying down the first
block pick a block and go here we go all
right let's take some ice yo this one is
so perfect
oh my gosh you are so amazing baby I
think I love now I'm getting nervous cuz
like the pressures on me oh yeah and we
just want me to start going going
surround and then we do usually when you
make an igloo you make it four packs no
compromise the odds are not in our favor
it is not
I don't think you know you're doing I'm
the boy he has the bags of snow which
apparently are going to force the blocks
to glue each other together like just a
thin layer like this acts as a glue for
the ice yeah
this right here this is the weak link
bro I'm worried about that block right
there though what is puzzle piece
Oh Hatcher's baby ah what is sleeping or
igloo tonight no thing I really
appreciate the invitation but don't want
to sleep in our igloo what backing up
more blocks of ice this one that I was
just handed has apparently a calcium
deposit in there yeah but to me it just
looks like a dick this has become like
your eyes so technical at first it was a
couple of idiots now it's a couple
idiots for the chainsaw don't actually
know what
what are you doing bro they're just
chilling my calcium deposit or he looks
like a dick the igloo is slowly coming
together as you can see what we're kind
of worried about now is the Sun at first
there's like the Sun melting the ice now
it's the Sun disappearing so we're
probably gonna finish this in the dark
and let's be honest no one likes a dark
igloo but regardless it is extremely
sexy and I do say we're doing a good job
Shaq Ford's almost on bro there we go
what's the last block yeah it looks like
we calculate we did our mathematics
perfect call me the cow got in high
school I didn't tell you guys this calc
god this is lit the Litton little
literally I guess well this is literally
lit
he's talking about cutting a door right
now simple songs forgot to do that
because this could like do you think is
gonna fall oh my god
I don't know bro I don't know
oh well there's the moment of truth this
is it I'm so nervous right now you're
doing it do it
throw the powers in your hands
not making any collapsing movement I
think we're good all the chain another
one to check this igloo is off the chain
bro
cool parties is it is it let's go
Wow yeah oh my god no way no way yo let
me just peel that a glow and think we
did whatever oh my gosh Eskimos I knew I
had it in my blood yeah I'm coming in oh
my gosh jingling you grabbed it up a lot
of people that doubted us we proved you
wrong
yeah even myself the earlier version of
Logan don't be a little bitch
we stand up I mean cuz it is a
convertible it is oh yeah we run out of
yo you'll never see an igloo like this
with palm trees like this ever again in
your life okay I'm gonna do this quick
because my camera is getting dripped on
yo if you want to check out u-kiss
channel what is it dude since vlog dude
just lost the link is in the description
is littering water droplets everywhere
we are in the middle of his igloo right
now this was his idea and he invited me
yo my boy they love you bro you're
always off for a hundred percent Oh son
always say yes to this guy
I'm gonna go sign off at home and get
out of this igloo because it's probably
gonna fall on us and ever die soon so
we'll see the second and cool transition
boom and back at the crib Oh yo that was
quite the day first time I've ever built
an igloo in my life don't just like my
dad building igloos man we're asking
what it's like we're like ask him Oh
Bros or something wait a second never
