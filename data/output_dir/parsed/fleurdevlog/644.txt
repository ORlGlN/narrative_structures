Edinburgh roads there's very bad roads I
could tell you that shows you sometime
they are so many challenges like when we
were coming in there's churches like
everywhere

pretty ones so it's alright

factory in the way but it's Old Trafford

champagne truffles with black currant
liqueur in them and they will like
