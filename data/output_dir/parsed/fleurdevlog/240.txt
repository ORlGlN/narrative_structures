sat down in there but we're actually
what days it's a Sunday so early and we
just sat down to edit day 16 of October
and half the footage is mysteriously
disappeared we don't know where it's
gone the vlog was like five minutes long
and we now have two and a half minutes
of footage Cilicia like half of its
disappeared so it's gonna be a short bog
fan I still watched it and kind of makes
sense
so I'm still gonna put it all together
and I hope you guys enjoy it but there
is some missing and I'm sorry about that
the most important bit today the most
important bits of this I hope you enjoy
it it's gonna be a short one but let's
roll now let's do it
Starbucks breakfast we've gone for an
80s theme today with Mike wearing his
favorite gunship t-shirt
I have only matching train and love
against we're moving
right and I'm riding in the mining photo
so we made it to New York by now and cab
on our way to our B&B to meet my manager
Amy she came by yesterday she's ready
happy I guess great
what do you what kind of food you could
have any food in the world right now
order in and out but is a good answer I
think I think I might say in an hour but
but the burger specifically animal style
I just ordered steak as hard as it came
it was tiny so we ordered some chips
we've got three bowls of chips for a
table of three people but they are the
smallest Bowl yeah I'm not sharing for
you we're here oh there's my coat we're
just going around the corner to the
front entrance we're half an hour early
before how she starts because we've got
to do a couple of things
oh my god like an S is so cool and
really surreal to be honest no wait um
can we film is going on right now
I'm about halfway through I just wanted
to show you guys all the lovely people
here and they're gonna say hi if they're
not too shy I think they might say hi
Mike's having a great time surrounded by
women in the middle I love it we've got
some hot ones Mike's having all two
portions to tell the crab claws weren't
cutting it so if you'd our little
midnight snack

strange way but yes
