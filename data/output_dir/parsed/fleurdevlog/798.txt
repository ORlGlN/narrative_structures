hi guys so it's almost a six and it's
currently 351 in the morning I'm just
getting ready to leave for Florence and
I've actually been really ill tonight
which I see you can probably imagine
like really really sucks I just started
feeling sick uh probably about five
o'clock yesterday and I just thought oh
you know like I probably haven't eaten
enough today or like I don't have eaten
something funny and it's just whatever
but I'm still feeling sick and I got
about two hours sleep because I felt so
sick and yeah I'm gonna go like I'm
definitely going I'm not gonna miss out
on Florence because that would just suck
but it just sucks it's like the worst
swimming in the world I think it must be
a bug or something because I can't think
of anything I've eaten and it's kind of
like that pain where like your stomach
feels like so it feels like someone's
like punch me in the stomach or
something it's pretty horrible but a big
thank you to everybody on Twitter
because I tweeted about it and I got so
many I've never got so many responses to
a tweet in my life on how to get rid of
nausea so I'm drinking Y ginger tea
which is disgusting it's fresh ginger
tea it's really strong in my I'd rather
be walking the dog mug I would rather be
walking the dog right now even though
it's dark and cold I would rather be
walking the dog than feel this sick so
this is gonna be an interesting fight
that really eternity
play and I still feel really really
really sick and I'm I just told me that
my glasses
obviously
you gotta see a lot more than me
today
it's really
boy was that long
I had a little not know I felt better
something but time we love myself
Oishi up to us is vibrant man
if you're watching it's actually going
to be
i'ma show you where these weeks
it was great to meet you guys coming up
so we have arrived with a little bit
tired

yeah a little bit tired but we provide
to Florence and it's very beautiful
we're in the main square now I just have
some told you know we did it was yummy
pasta and bruschetta and they're really
nice

though I'm feeling better it's getting
better so we're in the main square now
give you guys a little bit Oh
yeah and these are the Christmas lights
which are really different this year
every other time I've been they've been
playing like across the street these are
like cute little lanterns I say little
they're actually massive but yeah so it
looks all pretty and my sing Christmas
you down there and then the Statue of
David is over that I think was actually
a copy if the sash of David I think the
real one is inside I may be wrong but
there we go I probably am wrong I'm
usually right now we'll find out we'll
read or read our guidebook read our
guidebook and find out what what do you
think I should do my mother thinks I
should film the tower because the sun's
of it it reminds me of the my life and
they're ripping my shop and it's yeah
so yeah maybe paying them a visit a
little bit later okay so this is dust at
the Ponte Vecchio which is the super
famous bridge influenced with all the
jewelry shops on it
and I think the view from this side is
actually a little bit more beautiful by
showing you down here to put the
Christmas lights
it's very beautiful you can see the
hills and the background and the bridges
no I think what was that I'm just doing
a minute for saying how peaceful it is
it does
and the moon whoa it looks a bit when
you hope if were good guys to me
I think am I allowed to film them I
think they must have is bill way they
are just had bit different to look at
mine proper later it looks like a little
thing wrong with like that remove
leather handbags only in Italy in Italy
that they issued perfect bigger the
lights now Lucci police
so maybe you want to tell us about this
bowl full of delightful miss you have
Reyes made it like a dessert
