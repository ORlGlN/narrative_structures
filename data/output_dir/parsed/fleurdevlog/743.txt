hi guys actually gonna switch the radio
off Taylor Swift song start saying Smith
wasn't playing she didn't hear its vlog
day 23 and today I'm driving which is
probably unseen for you guys for
anything I've ever trained before
because I never have something to film
for me yes we are going to learn a
fashion we had to do a bit of shopping
which I'm very very excited about it's
probably my favorite shopping day of the
year so we're gonna take you guys along
with us we're just heading over to my
mum's laughs now at Miss Lucy and my mom
and my sister and my brother's wife
I have a rule coming with us so it
should be even cool day so I'll see you
later
yeah believe in salem's I apologize the
bumpiness
driver Aggie driving mode so yeah oh
jeez for filming okay guys I have to
show you really quickly we're having
afternoon tea at the Berkeley chomping
and Lucy's here mom Becky
okay so lives which is your favorite
black currant leaves it's painful I
haven't had that one I liked this one a
miniature macaroon on the top but I
don't exactly know because I've lost my
senses this one this is this it's a
little Burberry Mac and if you guys
watch Carly Christmas on YouTube you'll
know that it looks like her without a
head obviously which is quite disturbing
but she has a coat just like that so
it's not so really squirming it looks
good
the shoes are amazing it's got a weird
okay the body is headless which is quite
as tapping but it's a glittery headless
body it's very cool very cool
I like these as well
now the glittery Miu Miu shoes and they
give you the whole thing that shows you
what the looks of it inspired by so
there are the shoes there's this coat so
yeah I'm disappointed by this because I
wanted it just to be like a really good
cake inside is it not
I said you try it lives every time I
feel me you're eating what's the verdict
but do you know like see I don't really
like icing so didn't let me have a look
inside cakey this is the actual handbag
but it's based on what's your favorite
mum which one the same one okay guys so
we're in the taxi now on the way to
London Fashion Weekend which is highly
exciting my sister's laughing at me I'll
film you if she said she doesn't want to
be on camera because she needs to get
her highlights done but I think we're
about to go past impalas are we
so I'll show you guys and here it is
I'll show you guys palace camera
I'm gonna get your rigs in watch out
it's the Queen it's it's like a
oh she's there another team it's pretty
easy run have to probably have
old-fashioned T brother but yeah we just
finished our tea I didn't film too much
in the bar because it's quite snooty and
it's a bit awkward getting your find out
filming yourself me like and isn't
really like straight so that like oh
yeah but we're going to do hey guys this
is not a Natasha my candies
it's pretty mental
hey guys so we're just leaving London
Fashion Weekend now I think I've
actually lost my voice because I've been
a bit ill and then it's been really loud
in there and she couldn't film too much
because they were kind of playing music
throughout so for copyright stuff it's
not very cool but I think we're heading
home now but what's bad naughty
purchases and yeah it's been cool to
show you but Somerset House as well
because it looks really cool you guys
can see
yeah so that's it for today I'm sure I
won't see you tomorrow because it's
still February I'm still vlogging

I think three things so I didn't get too
much but I like got a few things that I
really wanted so I'm really excited
about it I probably film along with that
