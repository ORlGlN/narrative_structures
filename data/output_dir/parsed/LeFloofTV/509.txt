what's frustrating about the PlayStation

friends out there what up or ex boxers
or whenever your console needs are
hydrated new Nintendo one seems kind of
interesting I'm not really an on-the-go
err on-the-go player the viewer thing
which I guys do today is cool except it
makes you sick so I'm excited when they
figure out a way that you can actually
play virtual reality without feeling
horribly sick at the same time maybe
they'll figure something out I don't
know maybe to hide this but I don't know
what it is but I'm really excited better
the problem with the PlayStation right
sometimes is that all year long all
right there might a game might be
released in like February March which is
really good okay
and then excuse me what are you doing
what have you found
close that over what did you find
something in there it's a box of like a
retro retro sweets and Sapphira anyway
you can't eat them anyway what I'm
saying is that sometimes all year long
or for like at least five or six months
to be like no good and good titles been
released you know yeah and then am and
then today or yesterday
like in the last two weeks there's been
like so many good releases coming out
and it's like it's like waiting for a
bus you know it's like you wait for a
bus no bus comes and when one bus comes
seven buses come and you're like what
