is the game is good anyway yeah I did a
few extra steps it was good anyway
my friend seg-y friends my friends I'll
see you for some Pokemon fun tomorrow
guys sometimes as a daily vlogger it's
very difficult to continue daily
vlogging in in the climate of sadness
and misery and you feel like what is the
point to be making a silly video about
me trying to find a Pokemon or me just
messing with the kids and it's so silly
and ridiculous and then I just think
well I should probably make this video
of the silliness because it's a
distraction for some people and it's
just it's just ever everything is so
intense right now the world's just it's
it's kind of scary you know so you know
I just thought I found out after that
clip ended you know of the nice
situation happened and I could just ah
she's so sad at there you know I wish
she could all just get along
I wish she could all be friends I hope
someday we are and your friends I just
wanted to point that in and I'm really
sorry for anybody and I hope everybody
is ok but everybody's not ok and that's
just that point I don't think anyone
will ever be okay
was changed so I can leave on the
several friends I just I had to say
something I have to say something anyway
I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll
see you guys tomorrow
whoa command you Marcy to play do you
walk oh man MCC Bella come on
the bug isn't one
three twizzle
