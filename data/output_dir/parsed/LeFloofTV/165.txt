why don't let me to speak first and well
she's a girl and she's a girl she kind
of whenever I know what's your reasoning
why should I put less in your room she
smiled at me she does laughing smiling
yeah it's tough it's a real tough
decision what do you think do you love
it
do you guys want to sleep in the crib
yes now all we need to do is add a baby
like that well what do you think'll s
yeah what thing do you like your big bed
yes why I don't know what's the dolly or
doe what do you think huh
look at you this is your bag now this is
your bed now back in a big-boy bed a
big-girl bed even huh I think she's
happy why do I think she likes it you
can lay beside her my two babies huh
my big baby and my little baby she is a
real baby what are you a big boy you are
growing little baby which he loves it
what are you trying to do are you gonna
roll over roll over mama called the
doctor and the doctor said no more
monkeys jumping on the bed
300 yards all right
30 miles an hour guys don't go faster
than 30 what I have to say what I mean
it says to me no keep going keep going
we have a 20-mile hike we have returned
from the party was that a good party we
got science things take a book pass it
on take one book pass it to mania a book
for Amelia leave the cakes here but that
was amazing the guy was like that looks
like David Tennant but he was like there
is fire and then there was a disco party
at the end and we all did dancing
together entire short at the end I know
but there was only there wasn't that
many swords you see that's the problem
so we only had a couple you know but we
still a good party wasn't it guys a
science prize did you see the explosions
the fire you know big fire you didn't
disappear time for me you should have
put your hand up you might have
disappeared
oh boy guys we're taking this apart
because we're taking it the ancient town
monitor and we're putting it upstairs in
her bed because Alessia is moving out
and moving on she's got her own place
now I hope she comes to visit he's going
on here why can't they all right she's
placed underneath her cabled up ready to
go we're gonna need to put some sheets
down your blanket Wow
well be careful Thanks oh it's a blanket
going on
now everybody don't touch the bed we
need to test we need to test the monitor
and make sure it works
that's the scary Sam if you ever hearing
that sound you come running in here
because that means that Alessia is in
trouble you know it's not all fun and
games now you guys are responsible you
have a baby on your floor I don't know
anything really means Alessia is in
trouble
you used to run to her aid now what you
definitely do not do is sneak in here at
nighttime or come in in the morning time
too early all right I know you've got
annoying noise all right we're doing a
test you're in your bed
I know I know yeah what are your in your
bed my down but tend to be asleep okay
that was good time guys that was good
timing all right we could probably we
can probably improve on that as you're
Rapid Response Force so just as we're
puttin to bed
we realize that an STI can roll over so
we should probably lower the thing so
I've had to take the whole thing apart
and rebuild it but it's all the way down
there now breathe it here
I told me then there now so now she'll
have no hope of rolling over just in
case I don't mind my messy appearance
also I'm finishing the pastry from our
pie earlier but we're setting up the
cameras in alessia's room because we
forgot that we even had this well we
didn't forget we never used it because
it didn't Oh Jonathan
can't see her
perfect yeah but he's just holding it
ah
yes
and just realize those 22 degrees in
there just a quick warm only has a thin
blanket over here though I might need to
go up and open the door because it gets
hot if the heat rises to the top of the
house that's Jess aw man did you see me
coming in the door yeah see isn't it
we never had that with the other two
it's really cool just gonna go murder my
darling
