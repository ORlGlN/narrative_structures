anatomy but this o judges you're so cute
here's my predicament in life I'm gonna
go see Batman in a few minutes probably
be in a few minutes and I'm like I've
talked about this loads of time there is
a screen in the cinema now we go to all
the time and it's like I don't know if
it's broken or they don't know what
matters I don't want anyone to talk
about it because I'm afraid they'll fix
it
but I've seen Tron there because I knew
about it so when she Tron there and I
was like ears bleeding lovely I went to
see battleships there I was like it's a
battleships is an ear bleeding
experience that's what I want I want to
see premedia is there because I was like
that's really what I want the lab
reading experience but then we went to
see him that's stupid rom-com thing I
don't know do you remember when we're
out of his mom and sisters what does
Cameron Bure what the hell is called
four months long engagement nine months
year engagement and it was in the big
screen I was like oh my god this screen
is really big I was like and now I'm in
the predicament of thinking scream one
bigger screen right it's like
I'm gonna go see Batman do I need like a
huge big screen with like like oh like
it's language you know it's a good
normal cinema normal cinema audio or
scream for it's a advertise screen son
and specialist is like a normal-size
screen but it's loud it's like kind of
loud like that I like that experience
could induce labor but Batman's I think

bed and just being a coma of ol bus
forward your prenatals to them

look at this little fella focus Mary
prenatals Bob that yeah how does this
make any sense bags
how can you fill a bank with stuff make
any sense he needs I thought we came in
for prenatals and I don't know how we
ended up over here
I'm not really sure what's happened okay
I think I think I was I was led here
under false pretense it's fine
hey that's the way you have oh just get
one then hey that's cool look it's like
a little bed little tables
oh just knock the table over my god it's
so rotten Oh what's wrong put them on
themselves
my father's ghost oh come on let's go
seriously Amelia wants to go home
the pups have been alone for like a
billion years if not for me or Amelia
for the pups think about the pups
and I saw this phone actually under
mom's view one of the amounts you had it
they here it is here that HTC HTC X this
is it here see okay it was a white one
will see the size of it that's what I
like about it you know even the Galaxy S
well there's the galaxy s in white yeah
that's zero and see look yeah that's one
book has actually yeah this the one I
have forged of size and then this is way
bigger but am I know I'm really drawn
between these people don't really like
to hate you 1x to the size of the screen
the video on it was amazing it's full
1080p I think it's like a 14 megapixel
analyst putting your size right
I like the size though - yeah - that's
what I mean like they're way too small
like the other thing is the new iPhone
is for August for them I'm really
leaning towards one of these Oh the
painting right over the phone so you
actually don't really care about the
phone dear look HTC one nice did you see
it just probably covers first
but it raised the other side it is like
they're not even move it it just like
stuck standstill
going that way going this way it's not
so bad did somebody call a film t-shirt
yeah it's really nice yeah peanut loves
monkey man but I'll be hates him I'm so
good I was like look I got mad
thankfully not because I think he's a
good talker you little weirdo I love an
airplane thing it's like a spaceship
yeah it's got the autopilot scene as the
villain really yeah the Cena
that's they call her the scene of how
these are henchmen I think Alvin is dead
the villain like he's the head villain
and he makes Cena do you know he's like
he sits in the chair and he has like
Oreo do you like pets Oreo I've been
expecting you you know I don't think
Oreo it's done for the Alawis bad man
making me that is why I get so much in
the Gulf okay
Cena sucks he loved your mommy oh it's
time for away she watches for the card
she watches you know how much fun that
is don't you
what's daddy doing
what's daddy doing he watching the car
well if you know he's just spraying the
tires you good girl see knees I know
not right now see they don't like this
part at all no it's okay it's alright
and if in case you hadn't noticed what
he said notice Cena's Bowl came out
because the puppies like to bully her
we're not bully her that's not really
fair they like to play with her and she
likes to play with them so they ripped
it out of her hair and I was just too
lazy to prop my kid cuz it's an ordeal
to put back to the bows seriously it
takes a lot of work isn't that right
because especially with Sina cuz she
squirms and squiggles around
alby's pretty easy to get his rolling
because he just he obviously likes his
bow don't you don't you he knows it's
for a good cause
so he just lets me do it whatever I want
I may be albe just likes being creamed I
think that might be actually just did
cuz he's better at the groomers as well
as she said she lets him or she lets him
he lets her yeah let her do whatever she
wants like she brushes him everything
and scene on it I had this kind of
feisty which I thought was kind of weird
cuz usually it's still the way around
but like usually alibies kind of the
grumpy one and scene that's pretty much
the laid-back one but when it comes
screaming poppy likes to be clean the
car is covered in suds obviously this
thing wasn't working the other day when
Jonathan tried to get the car washed and
obviously it's it's still like kind of
broken because the car is covered in
suds and there's no water coming out of
the thing of the pose so the thing
the machine just ended it was like you
have 50 seconds left and he was like
what the hell but it was because there's
no water left so it was just gauging by
the amount of water obviously and now
that the car is all set it up and we
have no way of racing it so Jonathan has
gone in to the petrol station to ask
them what's up cuz this is awkward like
look you can see that look at the car
it's covered in sides it's all soapy
great what happened I wish she washes
was cut short he was in there for a
really long time
like there's no water pressure got into
the whole place went I know she's like
that so she's given me another ticket
thing but then we have to like call the
owner and the manager and the president
again permission to do so and the car is
all stained with such so I'm gonna see
if I can oh my god
just really nice though
oh my god okay that's not really nice
I'm pleased that they I know that just
happened okay anyway next day Pizza is
the nicest day I wonder does it work if
you can take next day Pizza right and if
you have next day pizza I mean only any
filling around what if what if we put it
to like 275
what do you think that'll oh yeah what
is it oh my god oh my god oh my god oh
my god a happy meal put a toy oh my god
