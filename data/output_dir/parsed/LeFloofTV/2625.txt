time we've tried to walk : heads come on
I feel them : heads you look like a
co-ed okay so that's what you're gonna
be in a thumbnail of this video if you
noticed that's what the toenail was and
that's something better happens but how
whenever we've tried to walk Alvie for
the last four days and every time every
single day it's been the same just like
Mike was fine this morning
rain rain rain it has not stopped
raining it's just not stopped raining we
gotta do something so we said they're
like okay we're gonna go to walkies now
yeah and we got excited and then just
 rain together this OP yeah okay
it stop for a second we're gonna try to
make a break for let's go let's go it is
so much colder today I am frozen frozen
look at them like a wiggling around you
think your father will get him
when I was younger my mammal which is my
Irish grandmother she as she should tell
us that if you catch your leave as it's
falling you can like make a wish so we
just always like try and wait to see if
you'd catch me falling and then catch a
falling leaf is that a song leave if
there is a lyric or ketchup all and
leaving a song let me know in the down
thingy because I think it is and if it's
not there would be a catchy name for a
song we need to taper off this area
apparently I've had exactly 2 a.m. last
night a pumpkin was seen walking and
violently attacked as you can see here
we're definitely gonna need to get a vsi
down here pumpkin affair
six months that's a negative
please don't get your feet away okay we
could just stay off the grass that would
be absolutely wonderful because I don't
want to have to deal with wet paws
because what's he gonna do what's the
first thing he'll do when he goes on the
wet paws jump on the bed that's obvious
a favorite pastime when he gets on a
walk so run upstairs and jump on the bed
look at him there isn't he sweet morning
have a son's friend Abbi hello hello
say bye-bye showing off my fashion mom
oh look at the way it actually turned
out because it was actually really rainy
and once we actually got out here he's
actually cleared up a good bit and that
there's some sort of Sun there's like a
Sun in the sky sending the sky a B Suns
flying high you know how I feel it's a
new dawn it's new day it's a new life
