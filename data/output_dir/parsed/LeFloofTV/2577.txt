ups have ruined Christmas
the end goodbye I don't like to bring
Downers to the blog at ease because you
guys don't come here for dinners I'm
sure there's enough Downers of neural in
life underneath delivered one part of my
package okay which was like that's
awesome but whenever part two of the
package part one of the package is
completely obsolete at 9:00 a.m. dead
they arrived at the complex over there
protected by those obviously there's
obviously no way to get in that shall
not to call that phone number you're
Tony Christmas Eve it's probably not
that important anyway I'll try just call
ups and I'm sure like DHL or and plus
they probably have a distribution
officer of some way where I can collect
it or obviously it's Christmas Eve so
they probably have some redelivery kind
of a service in her most monotone I hate
Christmas called me the Grinch voice
just like normally they rain well I
don't know why he didn't ring Christmas
Eve sad that that's what you're gonna
leave me with and we deliver in the 29th
the 29th she said it's all right
yeah so what it's just another day
Java's get some Christmas presents this
year
presence you know when the Sun comes out
slightly melts the ice then the cool
temperature comes in and turns it all
into ice so now we have ice no snow it's
nice it's nice to sneaks me let me just
skip ahead all right guys we're off to
do a Christmas special you guys going to
in for that look at the sea of people
you guys get good Christmas presents and
class this morning because it's like
past Christmas Eve you know it's post
kiss was right now on our way
post Christmas afterwards oh I don't
know when you bring you by mid
girls like girls like
groundwater a picture confirmation we're
gonna print it out and frame it card in
all right touch the screen to begin
whatever language you prefer
yeah there's your prints regular media
card and okay the first one have left
ah bingo instead to Christmas Day
weekend we're actually there without
Debenhams because it's so busy at the
moment
you can only spend 1 million dollars you
cannot spend over 1 million dollars okay
so I'm gonna go to split up guys try and
persuade her to get me something good
even though I don't think they're
leather and they seem really good
quality and they have them in black as
well I think black is probably better
than that we liked Oh gasps and look
it's got like a metal arm puck and
everything at magic he could have your
coffee alarm unless of course she's
thinking with saying this me and she
 me one of those maybe I could
psychically tell her somehow here's the
fun stuff and the stuff that I know that
Jonathan would be like all the game
in my eyes this is all ridiculous but I
know that this is the stuff that would
make him happy but Sun tarts are on the
shape large and they're fun
I never even knew what that once before
but I don't know which aren't them like
a nerf look kind of funny - a card I
like all the fluffy commercial meters
long not one that one this one which I
think early how
sorry a minute ago
I think she wants crushed let's get out
of here every dog that's a friend of toy
for now be cute but still looking for
Donna Howard princesses
I would love that if I were seven all
right we've got an inside view she was
standing over here which means she's
probably into some of this kind of stuff
which I agree with the most horrible
thing ever
maybe this one mm nothing right dog no I
think guys which one says me nah this is
me me me me me regardless it stay that's
a cool one nuts so many of them are
there's too many which droid Jules so
many of you told me that I should get
Jonathan a coffee machine like that one
but it's only the display model is less
so we're gonna get that one I think and
I might even get a discount on it that
was actually really good idea and a lot
of you told me that I should get him a
coffee machine or a coffee maker so guys
I found in an alarm clock just to give
you a scale concept right here boy
getting a little long you speak
I think I am on fire it is so hot like
why shopping so hard
Jonathan always says not to buy clothes
but I think this is really nice and this
is by far the nicest game that I've seen
and also he has another one of things
similar to that what cheaper and he
looks really really good in it so okay
this is a lot harder than advertised
I'm so hot and there's so much choice
that is are so difficult to make them
feel better that's a whole shirt thing
I like that pony okay
I think I've narrowed it down guys
slippers or 90 things and I think I
don't was saying talking about it or
anything in this material I think she's
like an 8 I don't know
am I wrong am i right laundry section
probably looks like Pakula no lovely I
think you get a second part to it oh
yeah no thank you right moving on I just
something double headshot boom slips
laughs someone have to comment yesterday
saying grandma wants our slippers back
and I'm taking that taking it to heart
we think she's like a fire and 6mu mimic
my sold sold pop I don't think I'm
supposed to be here let go at this one
I'm not gonna show too much it because
this is a family show but let's get the
hell out of here I can't get him I can't
get him slippers because I'm like you
really wants them but my mom is getting
him surprised but when it was snowing he
was so jealous of my ugg boots they're
not realize they're just you know the
booths that look like Oh boots
then the only problem is that Jonathan
has an insanely big foot
so you beat both of them are big not
just one so I'm gonna have to get a
really big size and they don't have it
all right I'm fine I hate you guys know
a nice hair dryer was broken so I'm
gonna get a treble try mm dry your hair
in 2,000 years all the presents have
been bought and were at home me mother's
you ask me loads of things I won then
what'd you get me also for the first
thing we did in this video we went to
that place we're printing out the
picture for Erica you ever be at the
frame and we were going to your head to
make it enough we forgot about it okay
we come all the way home
but that's arrogance present for her
grandmother's like no we gotta go back
now oh man I was so tired and tax goes
to so full the whole of Debenhams and
divergents faux bob we're gonna drive
over gonna bring out it I can't I can't
I can't leave him here in his own again
I can't I can't do that poor little guy
what I have a free cat wouldn't you
little guy bring it little guy you want
to come with us you gotta write a
fantasy otherwise you can stay at home
oh yeah you guys never done it you're
like boy did something because it takes
too long it was like come back in like
half an hour another half an hour we've
moved on pressure trying to find
something for me nothing you know how
guys Oh buddy coffee thing uh he's happy
to be Atlas no this is becoming like a a
normal thing that's a look at the snow
watch the ice it's like I'm so I'm
actually like it used to just know every
day now when it goes isn't gonna be kind
of sad because she passing here little
sneaking pass her we also have to Anna's
mom is coming mama style that's coming
to bring us a Bible tell them why
because my grandmother has this
tradition that every Christmas morning
before you open your presents
she reads I think it's Luke 210 to 220
it's the Christmas story like are the
story of like Jesus's birth and now that
we have our own house and our own place
and we're actually spending Christmas
morning there I want to carry on that
tradition but then I realize that we
don't actually own a Bible but yeah so
my mom's gonna bring me a Bible and then
I'm obviously gonna do it usually it was
like one of the children would read it
and Donna can't read I need a baby so I
think I'm gonna be doing it this year in
our house I know everyone takes
everything literal I can read okay just
just just want to put that out there
okay but yeah and I think I used to
always do it at home I actually like
nobody else ever wanted to and then I
always use me but I think now that I'm
gone tonight tradition no because things
like Christmassy as much as Christmas is
nice I think that is the only reason why
pretty much so any for you non Catholics
like you apologize if tomorrow morning
cuz we're gonna open the vlog tomorrow
morning with our little we're gonna have
a prayer people were to vlog I don't
know I just thought it'd be nice if you
could all take part in it so if you're
in if you in case you're not Catholic
and you actually set on fire and burn I
do apologize do you not
I can't talk to her anymore my brother's
wife is actually a Protestant as well so
you know I'm gonna set my own religion
