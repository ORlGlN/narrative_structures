not to have Domino's prepared to have a
baby attached to me they paired to have
a baby attached to me I have something
it's not my leg it's attached to my leg
and it won't let me go it's attached to
my leg to me I'll try and scrape it off
here
ahaha I scooped it up you ready for bath
time friend you ready for a bathtub
situation by day she's bashful and quiet
as a mouse she calls up and sleeps
through the house that's a now she's
asleep all over the house okay let's
move on okay well he's built a page so
whenever Jonathan is giving Amelia her
bath I always like to clean everything
after dinner so I cleaned up and I don't
know I just I I really can't sit still
unless everything's been tidied up and
put away and the dinner things have been
cleaned up like I can't relax on the
couch or watch TV or do any kind of
thing until everything's cleaned up so
that's usually my job and then I always
put her to bed like I'll put on her
jammies and her body lotion and read her
story and put her to bed but I'm going
away in November for it's just for one
night but it's gonna be my first night I
think ever away from Amenia yeah so
that's kind of sad so I mean I'm really
looking forward to it but I'm just I'm
like maybe Jonathan and I had started
swapping the routine so that maybe he
puts her to bed I mean I have no doubt
in my mind that Jonathan had put her to
bed like he's an amazing dad that's not
what I'm saying I'm just like if she
gets too used to it always been me maybe
that might be a problem I don't know but
then I mean is quiet adaptable so I'm
not too worried I'm just like hmm maybe
we should change that up a few times but
anyways I love how the house likes all
the Halloween things I put like you know
the Halloween table together I still
need to get a picture for that frame and
the house smells amazing so I'm gonna go
upstairs now put a me out to bed

goodness cichlid here I was looking to
buy bed wondering I'm sure sitting in
