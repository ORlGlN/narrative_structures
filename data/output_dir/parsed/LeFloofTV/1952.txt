I got a me a kitten yes oh my god she's
so cute
you guys she's so smooth there's not
swiping buddy went on her own
oh yeah you can feel it oh poor little
thing he's so cute
smarter than a puppy's like no I get out
can we book everyone in Oh
oh my god you're so jumpy
no very huge Amelia such a gorgeous name
Islam Thanks so if you want to pop this
on and if you just basically you altered
basically to seat you as you'll be
carrying a school bag yes I'll get you
to pull these okay
backwards go back towards your back you
would don't attach that yeah I'm gonna
make your back straight
yeah so basically you curve this behind
you should fear that you're doing your
marketing yeah and that's when you would
carry on put on the front carrier see
you'll see we have an inside harness
adjustable eternities additions okay so
depending on the size of your child you
would adjust this so she's smaller but
I'm still gonna give them the bigger one
looking for first-time minute just for
you to actually see what you'd like so I
would clip either side this thing yeah
perfect
and you'll notice away all of our clips
are at the front thank you to hold a
course like this right I'm be able to do
no fee you're actually supporting her oh
no I think she's pooping so if you
whenever I'm gonna take this anyway cuz
we're gonna Shh she doesn't want to go
for me yeah you say yes strikey strikey
daca scoffs you think of Maca because
it's a Norwegian name it's a Fiat we saw
her family owned business just chauka is
actually their second name it's
Norwegian okay rather conversation
either so no I know I think it's a lot
of topics of conversation yeah her name
yeah she's so gorgeous
thank you I don't know her now is this
child a she might be a bit cranky
because she has been asleep for a while
so I'm sure she needs to be fed oh he's
so terribly good torture is she seven
eight exactly five yeah she has it here
brilliant you can see that happy hips
positioning so basically it's a position
they call the end position it's when
your abilities your legs and every
straight
they're always pea yeah that's the way
they grow and it's ergonomically the
best position they should be in for
growing for their muscle development for
their hip development so by wearing the
carrier you're actually supporting her
growing in a Roma hood British okay how
you feel because you shouldn't feel like
you have to hold you I feel yeah that's
really light it's like a Steadicam as
you can chuck in so like if your eyes
today you don't want all your straps
lemonade you can tuck these into the
side can you also have your little
pocket for her dummies or your keys or
your phone yeah here yes and then what I
would do is if she leaned more towards
that size you could tighten up even
Matt's honor all right keep away
I don't know protect the cheese yeah
that's cool you consider that no you
can't see her face without secrets for
mommy you guys think like well if you
