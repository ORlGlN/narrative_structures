oh my god it's freezing in this house we
don't get our heating on for another
like week almost well that's not
actually strictly true today's Saturday
or Sunday Sunday and we get our canoeing
back on Thursday so it's not actually a
week but it feels like oh my god I'm so
stupid but like seriously it is all
dishwasher informed washer it's quite
comforting but seriously though we
haven't had gas because it's stupid
idiot used to live here didn't pay his
bill or whatever so we haven't had gas
at all since we moved in and that has
never been used in its whole entire life
this right here
he's never been on hot waters never been
on we have electric showers so that's
why we could take chairs and stuff but
um we can't even watch the dogs like in
a proper bath they have to be washed in
it like under the shower stream which is
kind of stupid did you guys like the new
song I made yesterday for the driving
part
was it you get a little piano that was
one D I don't want to combine them all
together
I mean if 200 mistake died cuz I'm like
I am from Dublin I was born and lived in
terrier GE what's my life so what plays
he sees my life and then I moved away
blah blah blah up here in Cork

have some Facebook I was like Dwight I'm
like my life to Berlin to over little my
like one courage okay right here did you
career teaching no
so the people are saying like you hear
from court you definitely can't be
cheering on carry and I was like I
didn't realize there was some sort of a
rivalry I thought oh like we're all one
straw because like no guess not
so I'm do I vote for double vote do I
cheer on don't Lunardi here and Kerry
when he was gonna win like Kerry always
in doing it they're regulars but don't
have one in long long time he'd be kind
of cool if the old dos you know carrying
home the big Sammy Sammy Sammy and then
we should go to Dublin we shouldn't move
to Dublin if they win or move to Kelly
of de winter I want to be a winner I
want to be a winner winner chicken
dinner I'm going for a Ducati that's why
I'm up for so I'm just making man lunch
and I miss me a bagel which is toasting
away in there some ham tomatoes and rock

fridge and it's been like this like
since we moved in

stop I don't know is it too warm or too
cold I don't understand at all
