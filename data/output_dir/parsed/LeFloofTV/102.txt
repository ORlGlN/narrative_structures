thing but like it just shows how
inexperienced really I am just well it

raining happening now or snowing get
distracted by the square-root onna
distracted by the way don't be a psycho
I see them every day
let's hey you might've lost your mind
when you're talking to yourself
hello I'm back
oh I'm really worried for my sanity
sometimes what's going on with his hair
so we're here outside the school waiting
for Eduardo and I was just looking at
the picture I'm gonna switch the
stopwatch but the environment bad for
the squirrels okay Blagh but yes so I
was just looking at the pictures from
the Christmas pictures that we did with
Greg and I love them I just think
they're so cute like I love the one of
the three like the family what it's good
like it's a cute picture and everything
but it's a family ones never work out
like how I want them to so like it's
never the perfect like for example I
like me in it I like I think Alessia is
okay in it I'm not sure if she's smiling
though yeah it's not her best chalk
because there's ones where she's smiling
but like others aren't amelia is fine
Jonathan I think it's fine and Eduardo
isn't that great in it like it's just
such a shame it's because there's so
many people oh my god there's an Elsa
right there little Ian hell no like
right there do you guys see giving a new
meaning to the word frozen because it is
actually freezing in there but yeah
I actually really like the ones of just
the girls and just the boys I think
they're really cute because they're very
like everyone well actually except for
poor Jonathan and the boys one doesn't
look like a hundred Oh
oh my god they open a gate it's open the
whole time I could have gone in ages ago
okay I'm an idiot anyway I suppose I'm
drier in here though
but yeah so I love those ones because
it's like less risk and even so like
Alessia isn't smiling at the one of me
and it hurt me yeah but still
and Jonathan isn't great in his one but
I feel like they worked out better for
some reason I don't know I don't really
know what I'm saying but I love them all
don't get me wrong it's just it's so
hard to find like the right shot of when
there's so many people can you imagine
like throwing all the dogs into the mix
I just don't even want to imagine not to
be honest guess who's back back again
guess who's back tell a friend guess
who's back why toes back back again

can so Edward was back he's had a
wonderful day I okay you didn't so you
