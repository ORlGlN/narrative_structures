blanket I'm like we were gonna think our
baby's like confused why something
damaging oh it's big on her is it it's

although I thought my brother last night
he said that his son was born now
remember he was born 38 weeks or think I
may be losing 37 weeks very early on but
and then was only am 6 Twiggy or
something I think he said and so he was
a lot smaller can do that right yeah I
