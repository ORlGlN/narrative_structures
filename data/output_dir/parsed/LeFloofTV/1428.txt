look you're allowed go into a shop now
you're loud don't listen to places
really I'm having the time for life
right now what
oh my goodness what are you doing so
Jonathan was nice enough to go to I
don't know where he's gone actually I
thought maybe he was going to the park
but I think I could have been wrong with
the media so that I could film my video
and he went off not realizing I didn't
really I didn't remember either with the
only card that works in my camera that I
use for a film this one right here that
I used for filming the style I videos
for the videos on my channel so now I
feel like a complete idiot it's actually
a stupid setup anyway like we should
have two cards that work but there's
only one that works with that DSLR and
that's the one that Jonathan blogs with
so that's why he went off obviously with
his vlog camera and we neither of us
remembered so now I feel completely
stupid because he went off to like so
that I could film and I can't film oh so
I think he's actually gonna get me a
card when he's out but how stupid is
that so I'm sorry there wasn't a video
yesterday that's white for your friend
so uh mom's news break sometimes mom's
needs breaks so I mean is that with me
I'm gonna party in PC world a PC world
party friends

walked around the shop and she was fine
for a while and then she just started
screaming and then if I tried to put her
back into the stroller she just went
mentals oh my goodness and there's just
I just like luck best thing to in this
situation it's just a leaf just leave
the shop just give up and drop her home
because this is not gonna work you know
she just gets in those needs you know

probably seen her vlogs that we never
disciplined her in like that
Oh be sure discipline does be going on
