I was like painting these you know
thinking he might come but he didn't
touch so this might be it maybe this
time I'll get lucky
it's spa day I'm so excited
are you excited you eat your banana she
insisted on having crocodile with her
for breakfast so yeah I think that was
eric has toy when she was baby
my mom found it in her head sandy with
two media so I'm going to the spa today
I'm so excited because as we get to the
end of the pregnancy it's just me
obviously it's more and more
uncomfortable and like in the beginning
when I would go for those way over here
for those spa days and for the prenatal
massage I didn't feel like crap the
beginning it wasn't like as not that it
wasn't as effective but I didn't feel
like I needed it as much because I
didn't have as much back pain and you
know this pain and that pain or whatever
but as the week's go on and it gets more
and more uncomfortable I find myself
really looking forward to it more so I
this one is probably gonna be my last
one I mean I would hope so did I only
have like two to three weeks left and if
I go over that like if I I was telling
this is that our friend Suzanne this I
was like if I have another one in four
weeks time I'm gonna be so pissed like I
won't even be viewing the house at that
stage just when you think there's no way
you can be this 3208
have to leave that another minute you
wanna record yesterday that's the new or
a record 3 enjoy
yeah please when I started number forty
forty and now with a tiny tooth oh my
goodness I don't want to swim I used to
get up at like 5:00 every morning before
school let swim you see like Dallas
International Dallas representing my
country all that I malarkey but I was a
100-meter freestyle sprinter 28 I did
but I was like a 2004 something we were
trying to get that down by like not the
second the milliseconds it's so hard I
think I've reached that point at that
breaking point cuz I'm still moving up
by like seconds in a second and sport is
it's a lot you know that's when you're
trying to beat that milliseconds they're
wearing different shoes or just like
different ages anything to try it
I've reached that point yet we're
getting there see them I'm gonna get
back up just to get back up there just
easier to make phone calls make sure
that I like nice and long distance phone
calls like Australia or Japan or
something you know and it stay on the
phone for a couple hours you know go

much II know you put the bowl with me
okay see okay she's limping hmm she's
getting to that stage where she's like
wandering yeah
very first well I know when I brought
her upstairs to film with me she was
like so angry because she thought that I
was taking her away from Erika off to
her now at least it's not a boy yeah am

this tiny slope my mom her regular girl
isn't here so she's getting a facial and
a manicure for the first time and then
I'm getting a pedicure and a Polish the
same as what I do every time
so it's the three of us today and Amelia
I was kind of sad when we were leaving
because Eric I was leaving too but
she'll be fine because I think she's
going to do something with her dad come
on talking on the main road the scary
switch but certainly to punch because
there's one of those fires
normally they're like two meters but
this one's a 1.8 unfortunately because I
have the new fact you know we're doing
on the Porsche it doesn't do anything so
I have to park down the road huh
in that suck French get you a little bit
extra exercise never hurt anyone and
that's nice and sunny even though she's
just like it's the winter are you
serious - actually had it open they
actually opened the thing I could have
driven down here I'm parked there come
on come on come on so annoying oh well
go go go fully though okay I hate hot I
can't go out that way this is my room
for my prenatal massage which I just had
I feel so much better
like I was not pregnant for a while so
it was so late and jr. he won't kick
whenever she does my belly she like he
kicks whenever she does my legs because
I think he didn't feel like the nerves
but whenever she tells my belly she goes
so quiet but so his personality like
amedeo was the opposite she would react
to everything as people like prodded me
but he always just goes quiet it's like
he's shy so cute so I'm finished now and
then I'm gonna go get my
I honestly got hot huh we're now Jack
Atlas that's carrying the jackets
unfortunately am that's writing his
jacket no one's willing to carry it for
me so I'm a slash like this this morning
huh hey guys like jammers today people
get super sunny and sky thing it's like
school took half ones or things like
timeless feels just over or something
cray-cray friends hmm we have not
decided to just sit down put our two
sticks we've upped our game today we've
got two sticks today are you go drummer
yeah you want to be a drummer okay my
mom and getting this done for the first
yes almost first time and they got the
wax which I'm getting right now come on
that's preparing me I went for a totally
different color this time you guys know
that I love red on my toes all the time
but because the baby is coming
I wanted something that would kind of
just be a bit more appropriate for a
baby boy so I went with this color here
which is this one it sounds nice yeah I
mean it's not like a baby blue like
because I had a baby on my finger and I
still might like you know I don't know
what he's company so it still might be
this on my fingers but it's kind of like
a turquoisey or like yeah I mint but
it's so cute I think it's like I don't
know it's so different than what I'm
used to and it looks really cool on so
I'm gonna get the same on my nails as
well because I had paint I was like
painting these you know thinking he
might come but he didn't so this might
be it maybe this time
