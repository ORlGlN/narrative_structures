taken because obviously people go to
work in town and they leave their car
there for the day so we were too late

kind of a little bit like further away
from the station not by our blood we're
trying to get parking here oh look okay

ATM or to say

when you hit adulthood you just feel
like 25 is where you stay yeah pretty
hard to explain
if you're over 25 before you know what
if what I don't see I don't see much of
a difference though like I'm 34 and I
still feel exactly how I did rose in my
late twenties because I'm a I still make
like better decisions now but I did in
my early twenties I think I should say
you know like I are still making stupid
decisions in my early 20s but somewhere
near the end

of just stopped aging almost and that's
it you're just like saying that
yeah parody covers you for one

birthday I like the worst day we got to
