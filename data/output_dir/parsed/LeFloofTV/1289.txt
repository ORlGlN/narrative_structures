that means it's kind of morning diving
big bad buddy
big bad buddy this isn't a big bite by
one so she chanced on half five this
morning I didn't realize at first it was
already so I was just like all right and
then realize that for those emotions the
time or so I got her back to bed um I
just came back in again at about half
six so I tried to just like stick on PAP
on the phone last about a half an hour
and then once adults like gulp she's
gotta put them up for the go peepees
Gardens picking up the poop there's a
media hi Mina hi Amelia hi
Amelia Amelia look up hi hi I think she
saw it
we I'm taking a bike here but you know I
haven't done in a while which is really
bad for the bike because it's been so
hot when I'm not changing gear last time
I zeth I noticed it was like super rough
look at it's so dry I'm quite lucky that
the changing actually snap or come off
so we're gonna Lube it up it's crazy at
the level of some of the air some an
actual dirt in here like it's probably
from like baloff or I could be for part
amna or go away or all the different
places in Ireland and then I'm sure some
of it there is from em from the UK
I'd say majority of it is from Ireland
just got our Waitrose delivery and the
guy was so nice he was like asking about
the YouTube buttons play buttons there
so I told him about that show and so if
you're watching waitress guy um he was
so nice it's kind of cool that if you do
your order at the same time like every
week you get the same guy so that was
pretty cool
