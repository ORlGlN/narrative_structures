ready for the day well the second half
of the day yeah sakis I'm aware that I
have not really blogged at all today and
I'm sorry for that but I baked oatmeal
and raisin cookies because I have issues
in life that I can't stop baking but I
really want it like we're leaving in two
days but I really wanted to bake these
so I'm gonna put them on my cookie jar
but they are not exactly how I expected
those but my first time using this
recipe
ah don't drop it on the floor okay this
is why I have played all over my shoes
so I took this recipe from like online
it's fine the cookies taste good I just
had one but they're kind of more like
Kate
spend cookies like they're not flat
enough and I feel like they're just like
muffins or cakes like the consistency is
not that of a cookie if that makes sense
I think I may have made them to bake
which is always my issue like I always
do this
no no don't put it in the pan why are
you putting in the bin but it's play-doh
anyhow anyhow yeah so I don't know if I
recommend this recipe I may try it again
and just tweak it a little bit but I
mean I'm so happy I baked coz I love
baking yeah
