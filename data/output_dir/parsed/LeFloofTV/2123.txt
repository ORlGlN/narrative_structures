it's another fantabulous day still sunny
guys still sunny it says it's 15 degrees
I think that's probably about accurate
because in our backyard and we have kind
of like a stun trap and it felt like 18
or maybe even 20 or kabillion yeah maybe
not tiny they were like 18 19 but that's
because we have a sub track so it's
probably about 15 but people are hiding
in short skis and it's just so summery
it is it's breezier than yesterday cuz
yes you even went on that walk oh my god
you know no it's too hot yeah like Cena
was like passing out so we're meeting my
mom I have a ton of clothes I'm leaving
to my sister

though if he actually gave us the Houmas
was it the Basel hummus free nice three
pounds of hummus which is one thing you
know the salmon it's amazing once you
get the crackers in here which one
nobody come home to the market and you
get to eat all the food afterwards it's
a tasty it's like the tastiest food the
freshest food and you guys go to markets
where do I park my car I can't remember
you know that's a Chinese a wash hate
that when it rains and none of these
like drips all over it then you gotta go
wash it afterwards all right
Anna's gonna give her sister all the air
oh my god it's so hot in there
nope this stuff will be okay they'll put
it down there I'll be better matter odds
and survival
doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo
by oh my god I just heard that BMW did a
recall on all five series and seven
series from like our year fault
America's our we have one of the new
BMWs but ours is a 3-series
oh nice oh my god imagine having to
bring the car back so like just bought
it so thankfully if you have a five
series or seven series and it's one of
the new ones no one has a six series you
know if you know if you know cars you
know I'm talking about now people do
have them but they're they're not that
like you pop your 1 into 5 into 7
there's a big long ones but AM yeah you
should google it just in case you do
have to bring your car back but that
would suck I check all of my amp
alright let's go back into the belly of
the beast you always just feels so wrong
from going from like everything fresh
mark you would all like the fresh
produce and everything like that and
then leaving there and then coming over
here to like Tesco and you're kind of
thinking like
it's kind of spoiled with it I feel a
little spoiled not spoiled in a good way
spoiled that's why that's cute Easter
egg don't know if I won t need to have
the hopes before I go to Dublin or to
have them on Sunday when they get home
from Dublin you know I'm like birth case
scenario the Pope's that she had the
pups on Saturday that would kind of suck
you know because Anna doesn't have to go
to Dublin so and I can stay here and
then I can call my own but that means
I'm doing a round trip on my own of like
five hours driving like two and half
than two and half of kind of sucks ass
and then obviously the event in the
middle of us so it's like oh no
so I really hope that M Sina either has
to this now but then if she does
that the cookies now it's gonna like
well it's not like we can like travel if
she has the puppies so I think that
situation would be not to have the
puppies until Sunday I think that's a
best situation or she probably gonna
happen she could be having him right now
as I'm signing the pesco that would be
crazy
Oh 2 to 3 putting the best crack let's
see all right are you sure not these
like Mediterranean olive Oregon O's
the ones that they always Halloween okay
okay okay give me a comment on guys in
case you bought the wrong ones and let
me know what the best crackers in the
world are the entire world's entire
world a nice one today

or the boys look here's one for all
Cena's pops up one two three four or
five taking everyone each is there a
girl yeah
Oh Oh Star Wars underwear 1314 years all

off flying them Oh
going on a road trip
13 to 14 year wait a second how long
does the child responsibility for I
thought something like a year or two and
then they'd off get a job I mean 1314
years the longer than that because task
is on a much higher floor you can't
actually get the trolley where you can
get the Charlie to help but then you
have to bring it back so
this is Xena's little nasty area this is
where she's chosen she keeps trying to
go into what's in there

that though I'm not so awesome it's
actually growing if you notice the
courgettes they're coming true nice it's

in that Jacobs Island get her place two
houses ago like last year I had this
stuff when it's gone on and on about it

then this is a pesto which he said Jay
he recommended it cuz he's like it's a
sun-dried tomato and something else
pesto so it's really good this is salmon
pate oh so tasty

can get he actually has a Buffalo ranch
it's not crazy
these are fresh buffalo mozzarella from
a buffalo ranch in court how awesome is
that

actually taste it like proper fresh
mozzarella balls but actually fresh from
a buffalo in Ireland not transferred not
import
we also got sun-dried tomatoes oh my
goodness look at them they're so good
and I think it's like just normal pesto
yum yum on our weight that's hummus
that's not pesto that's homeless I think
he gave us a basil hummus and he gave us
that for free which was like that um
because he had no humus left and he's
like look I have a basil hummus he is
like I could never tried that and he's
like tell you why here's a little

want induce labor
no so we're just gonna bring them to the
nice green part where they can just run
in the grass and then we'll go home we
