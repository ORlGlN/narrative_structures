let's go drama let's drop it
Dumbo anyway so lazybones over there my
mom's coming any minute now
goal is doing um pictures of me for my
blog
what's the Lighting's better now
my makeup is done I'm not doing my
makeup
oh look at the grumpy no-good the gross
okay all right so I'm just gonna get my
stuff
organized and guys this is the first
Sunday I'm in like the last six to eight
weeks or something that where I didn't
actually have to drive on it to makeup
school because her mom went with her
because she's gonna be her like subject
matter so today I have done pretty much
nothing I sat in this chair I watched
this TV I was watching some films and
playing some games and you know it's
just nice sometimes not to have to go to
my but I gotta start at the car because
I gotta drive to the Uni tomorrow and
it's not working so I got a sports up
now oh and the Tesco we got left behind
Albie we got left behind we're going
with Mama style.i it back to her house
because I'm gonna pick up you know that
car that I teach Anna to drive in that's
a little ol little Punto and we're gonna
take that for like three days so on
Thursday because I'm in uni from one
that you said Wednesday so I won't have
any time to go start at the spark plugs
and everything's closed weekend so
Thursday morning I'll go to motor
factors and I buy a spark plug a
Sinclair spark plug now I'll buy four
spark plugs and I would probably I don't
play need a tool or something how do you
take spark plugs out of an engine that
an homage can't be that difficult so
yeah then I'm gonna get the spark plugs
take the spark plugs out of the engine
put in the new spark plugs and hopefully
that should do it
and the carbon are working so for next
three days we're in the Punto we're in
Cranberry it's a Punto but you know it's
plenty about that Punto it is so easy to
drive that are actually thriving
easier
it's so easy it's like I don't know it's
like a toy car something I like the
gears are also easily maneuver anything
is like a one later it's not matter like
if anything I'm around gorkon is like
little little Punto be like man Kings
will be bad for Joe first but I'm that's
the reason who cares
I said that something really annoys me
that people M people get judged by their
status based on the car they drive
especially in Ireland like you see
someone driving like a nice car and you
think oh they must be doing really well
for themselves well as a matter of fact
that they could be broke just barely
making higher purchase costs and then
you can see someone who just like me
personally I just think buying a car
it's like I know in a practical at all
but they cost so much money and it's
like why don't you just buy a cheap
crappy one or try to avoid paying it or
just don't get in debt that's wondering
that myself and Anna are pretty
I'm Anna Don which is a zero death do
not get in debt so buying a car is like
I just been a 10 20 30 40 grand in a car
like unless you had 40 grand to buy the
car or 20 grand or whatever don't bother
buying it like just get like the car you
can afford like it doesn't matter what
people think of you because their
opinions don't matter but I know that
most people will probably care what the
other person what their neighbor thinks
of thyself but I don't care so much

fool Versailles what kind of Corrections
