day before was kind of sunny and then
today it's like freezing cold and rainy
like oh my goodness I am unless this is
some sort of a move by the
pharmaceutical companies in in Arden or
whoever is providing the labs because I
would buy stocks buy stocks and shares
in left bottle and sip make sure they'd
be careful on the roads this weekend
because this I think last month
Ireland hit like a record of the worst
amount of road fatalities Ahrens ever
had like a lot of it was speed related
so what they've done is at the end the
police force have died here this weekend
they are targeting like every single
road every single speed camera
everywhere they are going to get you if
you're a speeder slow down buddy
because they are out the guard er at
with a vengeance this weekend however I
was watching the news few days ago it's
like all god I remember that like I know
I don't know I'm like I'm like an old

like everybody else you know I had my
first car when I was like 17 I were like
you know stupid about

slower and you only get the slower you
started trying for something I know
where it is cuz I know my dad drives at
like five miles an hour everywhere you'd
be like Oh dad you're so slow I've
noticed that myself I've started to slow
down a lot you know and like right now
like I'm doing like what 80 kilometers
I'm like I can eesti just a hundred Road
here but I'm doing that 80 and it's kind
of like I don't know I don't know why it
happens the older you get the more you
slow down or something I don't know I'm
just out of that I'm just sort of
