don't know them I don't know if you guys
noticed but I'm on them I'm on the
shedding process all the little men I'm
on the sharing process it's very it's
very emotional because towards after
about three weeks they said that the
hairs would start falling out so the
transplant hairs are never falling out
and they're being replaced by little
baby hairs that are gonna start growing
forever but the guy said just prepare
yourself for week three they're gonna
start falling out and it started about a
week ago and every time I was showered I
keep pulling on like yeah it's very very
emotional you can see it now so it's
like it's thinning with a transplant or
unbought but about February I would say
all of those all the transmitters be
gone and it'll be replaced by brand new
hairs you know it's a process you know
it takes months it'll all be a
amazing-looking but I gotta go ahead
okay so remember Amelia's in charge
