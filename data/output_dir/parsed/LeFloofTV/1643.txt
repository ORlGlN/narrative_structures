so many pretty clothes so I just washed
all my makeup purchase they were dirty
because I hadn't wash them for like the
two weeks usually wash them once a week
wash them in the two weeks that we were
in Italy because I didn't bring my brush
tune or anything like that so they were
filthy so I'm glad I washed them and now
never ends and Amelia's down for her nap
thank God so I wonder if she's gonna
sleep for a long time because we've been
doing just like one nap a day really
long because she's wanted to sleep so
long so I'm kind of just letting her do
what she wants
but then she won't have another nap
after all the way she won't sleep so
we'll see
what does it mean not like when you push
around a jelly like a squishy he's just
like not my nail polish just it looks
normal but they made a gentleman I don't
know don't like pride just like stroke

time except we actually never strapped
you in on hollow anytime ever you know
well I don't know is it go under the
stoppers no no it doesn't owe anybody
one asked table number one give Raheen
ever that in oil I've been doing that in
a while there's barely enough room in
this table we're gonna need a bigger
table I think we're headed to Middleton
where we used to live because they have
the best pet shop in my opinion in our
opinion in the entire world
in court that's why it's more because
you don't have to go into a shopping
center to get there yeah I don't like
having to do that it's quite large it's
large and in charge it's the max easy
with militant marks plus you don't want
they're always really nice in there
they're nice everywhere but just for
some reason I get a nice a good feeling
from them so we need to get more dog
beds because now that we've broken the
system with you got a better opening
here to sell dogs Alvey yeah and now
that he has stopped howling and crying
and everything we need to get him a nice
bed because there's only three beds and
two of them are like you could fit two
dogs in and then one is just for one
that was
alibies original bed but it's kind of
somebody having six dogs and one two
three
making sense I know today our seat on
the couch in order for a fact but as I
just ate there should be like a
missional be observes that a minimum of
six beds there should be the option
because how do we know that they're not
having fallen outside we know that like
you know behind can't see they don't
have two five or nine right now storm
off is like she's got nowhere just don't
often yeah exactly
ah he goes generates a russki Jesus got
