lot moving in Eduardo to be poked and
prodded it's not the vaccinations this
time it's the public health nursing so
he's going for it how old is he well
five six one five one five and a half
month or something to check so I'm
they're gonna like weigh him and measure
him and they make him like past hangs
and they do like I checked here check
brain checks all sorts of different
checks to make sure he's a fully
workable human being which I think he is
he seems that way interesting to see
what is weight and height his contract

alright hello little fella you know
little fellow hello hi so the nurse the
public health nurse told me that I could
start giving Eduardo little finger food
which I wasn't sure of it I don't know
why I thought you have to wait until
like six months but I think it just
depends on the baby like if they're
sitting up and if they're grabbing
things you can do that so I gave him
some but no morning that will make me
feel well oh you dropped it here you go
what about this one good boy go try that

have you made
yeah she was like everything's gonna on
the floor but it's good
to them there's like a small window
where he like if you miss it it's kind
of bad like so media I did baby led
weaning pretty much all the time because
she did not want to be fed like at all
whereas he does not mind having a spoon
put to his mouth she didn't like that at
all
but he does but she was saying that like
you have to kind of get them interested
in like textures and like you know
different foods and stuff with them with
the finger food thing but if you miss
that window they could get really fussy
so how that was kind of interesting and
that's what we're trying here but so far
