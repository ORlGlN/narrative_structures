it's smashed it has been smashed to
pieces it's a what is it a Hello Kitty
mirror and it has been broken and we
have a second job here which is a candle
holder and we have one sort of empty top
blue that I co-founded so as we all know
Erica has been given the camera job once
more so this is kind of there already
stuck in which is good so all we need to
do well we clearly tear it down look
they won't come at Nadel this one so
first of all we need to make the jigsaw
okay first problem we got are you
supposed to open it it's actually super
getting closed don't try this at home
Oh hands quickly little Chi it's broken
pop-up tubes squirted the glue
everywhere
Oh what just happened you know it's
fixed like what the mirror is just a bit
wonky wonky donkey
you know wonky donkey we hope not to
stick our hand it would be a candlelight
thing because you know I don't want to
have my hands that think I'm looking for
the rest of my lip ito okay stuck to the
candle No
imagine you're stuck like this often are
they released oh oh oh
what my fingers were slightly stuck
together is that funny
do you remember by the power of
Grayskull he-man you don't remember
he-man the comedy remember he-man and
Shera
yeah this little cat it was a real
scaredy-cat like Miffy right and then
like Mickey there and he was like sure I
need to get a sword you'd like
and he would go from like Justin Bieber
to like 50 cent in like a second and
then really powerful and then like you'd
have the little cat it was like oh and
then the cat would get turn from light
smudgy Darin so like it dibblex
something-or-other vicious animal
Panther or something which part you
stick together this part is now stuck to
this part pretty darn cool a pretty darn
cool a you ever super glued something
together apart from your hands obviously
if you want to remake or rebuild
something so I've been informed it's the
best way to get super glue off your
hands
is to get yourself a little part of
impossible paste and essentially you put
the impossible paste on your hands and
it takes away your super glue straight
away now the only problem the only stuff
okay so it's a small it's a small thing
with impossible paste is that it doesn't
exist it's the only small small problem
with a possible base so if you guys got
any hints and tips I've had to get super
glue off her hands I'm probably gonna
have super glue on my hands for the next
few days so I really appreciate you guys
giving me a comment and let me know
so you think guys this is it a completed
finish it's pretty cool it's simply
looking there isn't it now my hands that
come in super glue so after please let
me know that's a cake do you make that
good to pretend going to eat all of that
