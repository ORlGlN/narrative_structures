secret weight-loss plan going off for my
birthday baby baby why aren't you
crawling yet geez do you and crawl for
your dad come on let's go no I'm some
crawdaunt's I'm walking
ready yes I keep myself this is my
birthday to go and put petrol in the car
Oh so treating myself maybe I'll and
maybe I'll watch the car as well it
needs a wash but then it keeps raining
so I'm like what's the point in watching
a car if it's gonna keep raining if
you're already smart you could like suck
the car up and then let the rain happen
and then reset the car and let the rain
happen I don't know or some sort of a
device that you could like it in when it
rains it reacts and it like explodes
shampoo or something all over your car
and then the car just like automatically
washes itself or something that would be
pretty epic it was actually only part of
my part of my sneaky plan was I should
come in here I got the petrol but now
I'm like hehe I actually wanted to get
something for her
Valentine's Day but I have to do it so I
she wouldn't notice me actually going to
do it the actual
oh here this 162 take look what we got

these to my beautiful white black for
six hours in her co-sleeper and she did
almost the same the night before so

lie I really like co-sleeping I just I
really like the closeness that it gives
and it works for some people it doesn't
work for others and I really enjoy it
