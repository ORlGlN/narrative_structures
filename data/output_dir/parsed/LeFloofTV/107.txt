Christmas is such a magical time for
kids isn't it you know mostly when you
came back here add anything back to like
your childhood I think the first thing
you jump to is always Christmas I sure I
don't remember vlogmas when i was a
child
vlog was has gotten out of control for
somebody who's been creating a jelly
content for nearly eight years my eighth
Christmas documenting it it's a it's
funny how you watch something like
vlogmas grow and grow and grow and grow
I suppose it's cool
I think everyone I think what's
interesting about it is that like
everybody has a different life and
everyone has a different life and
everyone lives a different life and when
everyone does vlogmas it really shows
how unique and different people are oh
my goodness guys have you had the Ed
Sheeran and Beyonce collaboration you
look perfect and I think wow that is the
epic da epitome of a Christmas song I
was sitting there was shivering along
crying laughs and oh all the emotions
you're not expecting
morning everyone not going to bait snap
time where it's nap time
oh the curtains are already closed got
five head just kick the camera so yeah

have this been taken over by lights yeah
we were at for this picture where
everybody white News Cafe and Amelia
