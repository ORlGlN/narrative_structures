checking mom oh geez
and you know what okay I had to come out
because 500 nappies we did the mats
wrong and then she she wasn't really
doing it in for last few days so we kind
of missed it you notice it and then
we're like oh my god we've known appease
up I just used the last one I was like
oh my god I gotta go get nappies one of
those things you can't live with and
again
I don't know okay nothing to complain in
jokey jokey jokey no jokes so onward
friends so Jonathan's not feeling well
so I'm just cooking up some Cortney for
me I don't know for me I wasn't gonna
eat any of this cuz she didn't really
eat any of her lunch which wasn't even
really she slept like all day cuz of her
system still like so out of whack and
like her routine and just everything is
just so like completely all over the
place
last night she went to bed at like
half-past eleven which is nowhere near
her bedtime you just go down at nine but
because she hit again slept through late
in the day she's waking up like at her
right here wake-up time but then she is
going down for like a real long time um
in the afternoon and not waking off
until like six or seven so that's kind
of what happened again tonight she woke
up at six and so we're trying to get her
back on track but I think she still
needs to catch up on sleep as well like
just from being sick so she didn't
really eat any of her lunch when I wake
her back she ate her lunch at like 6
o'clock which so it wasn't lunch at all
um but she hardly had anything
I'm hungry so I definitely need to eat
something but I don't think Jonathan can
have anything because he just feels like
he's got whatever she has and I'm just
glad I'm just thanking my lucky stars
that I didn't get whatever it is but he
seems to have because I felt very very
sick like when she was sick and my
stomach was kind of in knots and
everything but then I didn't actually
get sick or anything and it went away
and I kind of just like powered through
it and it was like it was okay
so I don't know was that it or did I
just look out and not get it I have no
idea but I'm cooking my tortellini now
