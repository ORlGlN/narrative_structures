good morning friends just dropping me at
school and his another really nice one
and thankfully it's raining it's
freezing though and about 20 years ago
hurt one of her teachers said that I
needed to swap her bag her backpack with
her spare clothes for a school
drawstring bag which wasn't on the
school uniform list but anyway
apparently you're supposed to do that so
that's what I went by yesterday when I
went to get my waxing done and I finally
swapped it out and it's been like weeks
and weeks and weeks let's do it ages ago
but basically they just wanted
everything streamlined like in the cloak
area and they're right it does look
really nice and a lot more organized
having just like the coat and a little
drawstring bag but anyway that's why
