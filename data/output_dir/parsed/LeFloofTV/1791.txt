yeah yeah question mark
creepy crummy beer back yeah cool breeze
take please now you've got this
happy Sunday and guess what in one week
and a day so like for you guys one week
till Amelia's six months smart yeah
happily she's turning six months that
for me is like always being I don't know
it's like the time that I know that
baby's the cents really mean because of
course I think Amelia is fun the way she
is now and I've loved her from the very
beginning but I just always I think it's
from like my youngest sister has just I
remember when she was a baby and I
remember the six-month mark for some
reason was when she became way more fun
so I don't know if any of you guys agree
with me but I have been waiting I have
been waiting for your six-month mark and
that's him so me existence like I'm
wishing her life away but I'm not
I enjoyed everyone so far it's just that
I think babies are more like interactive
and fun when they're but six months so I
don't know but she is so ready for food
it's crazy
huh I brought my food over like my bowl
I just gave it to the puppies to lick
but watch this
yeah she is just so obsessed and every
time I pick up my coffee cup is wash
it's so excited but when I initially
brought them over she was just like I'm
like next week cuz I'm I'm waiting until
she 6 months to wean her and that's just
how I've decided to do it
so um next week this well yeah in a week
in a day yes you can have grown-up food
huh yeah we've got some baby rice and
we're gonna do so
apple pear banana gonna do some sweet
potato some squash we have so many plans
for you huh oh you like a tell me yeah I
like us Eric I should stay here forever
take care of me please please I'm stuck
in a time machine stuck in a time
machine let me out on my time machine
man thing's frozen home well it's not
cuz I'm then the first sort of thing
with the time machine because you have
to close it up now and it's like it's
taking like
I think it's trying I probably shouldn't
know this I think if you go to use time
machine you should probably use at the
start why this is it do bad you'll
understand what this is it's time
machine it's your flux capacitor and
your TARDIS system to genres of time to
have a lair and spewed out I can't get
back okay this is annoying though
oh that's kind of cool you oh wait one
now choose a zero and I started in here
so obviously you should be able to flip
back anything you want I wanted to set
it up so I could back up everything but
I'm in a mistake by entering the time I
didn't know it was like enter Time
Machine I was like yeah sounds cool
I think I'll enter the time machine or
maybe t so Amelia is taking a little nap

pretty weird thing could she fed me and
