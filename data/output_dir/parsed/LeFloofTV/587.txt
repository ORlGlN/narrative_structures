something to you guys I know I give you

rallied together as a community and I

it's like the best thing ever
all right let's go I know where my dish
thank you are they ladies I decided to
get them because of my broken
oh that broken but my old
no-name brands ones only ones that I had
on which I've had for like since before
me I was born and
I just thought I would upgrade because I
actually kind of want something that's
like comfy and easy to wear now I have
heard reports that these Chanel
espadrilles not these particular ones
but like in general that they fall apart
mono if you wear them too much
so I mean very good right oh yeah you
know lucky evening but I didn't ever
maybe too hot for to open in the evening
times you know I wear Thompson's right
girl
all right let's ban you drop we have to
go to London Bridge didn't we actually
walk across the bridge to get to our
next destination but look this is cool
and that cool
there's a big cruise ship then there's
like a military ship bridge over there
anyway this is London Bridge sits at our
London I think or something I don't know
I'm new here
exactly which one's falling down
your if you're new to blogging right and
you're like oh no it's really hard to
block the public is everyone looks at
you weird go to like a touristy place
and vlog in a touristy place it's the
best place to like introduce yourself to
lucky because no one here is looking at
me like strange because everybody I'm in
a tourist place and everybody else is
doing it too they just think I'm like
touristy here you know it has to be like
introduction to vlogging to practice go
to a touristy place that's my advice for
you guys holding down look at them
which is a pair of Londoners on the
subway huh
oh my goodness right so all this effort
we came into the embassy today to get
and hook up with him in his passport
then it turns out that the preschool
that Emilia is did not now accept me
anymore as witness and stuff and
everything
unlike the pictures the forum everything
was filed true her preschool and then I
excepting up because she's the preschool
is not technically a teacher
they're like employees
teacher numbers like all my doing
official speaker in sorrento like
shortly and I can't get her passport as
we got to go back home I figure out a
whole new plan if he's gonna witness
it's so silly like that you can't just
buy all my
the disaster now so now we have a
limited amount of time I don't know
immediately to get a password
oh really ignore the effort of getting
in here
keep it all the pictures around all the
pictures are signed and witnessed
and all the forms are signed in winters
but it's good
new pictures we're going to got one
picture not sign
may not find it like
for bank
and you guys work in a bank we could try
I don't know it's like midnight this
week
baby
Bank nearby which is our bike it's not
the branch anything that know me well
I'm gonna try
they let a new passport form and
everything kind of dinner right now the
pictures are not signed by the last
witness but I'm hoping that we can just
read something like get them to sign
over those pictures
yeah hope so and then we can go back to
the passport office because they gave me
a thing
something here so hopefully that means
we could skip the queue possibly get
this done today and hopefully immediate
can come to Toronto with us
the right there wishes
okay so here's the update we're going to
go and try and find a bank which i think
is up here I'm gonna go in here and try
and convince it that I would say George
- I could just tweet out of any you guys
like lawyers accountants teachers police
any one of those things come meet me i
Kensington Park and come inside this
thing for me except I don't think police
can do it anymore
no I don't know that that's gonna be if
the if the bank doesn't work a that's
the next thing we're gonna do we're
gonna do a meet-up find somebody to sign
our form otherwise and you guys want to
mind a mediator in tow I'll be so
horrible oh this is so frustrating if
we're in Ireland right now would you get
this sorted like in a second like it's
just cuz we're not it's just so much
difficult when you're dealing with your
embassy or going to your concert anyway
here we go which is lucky
okay so that didn't work I tried to
explain it's an Irish passport thing
