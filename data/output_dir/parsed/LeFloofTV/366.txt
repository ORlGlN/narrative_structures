food in it because I'm just not eating
that much today which is not like me if

happen in like next month or in a few
weeks like it's imminent
so you just wake up one morning boom

underweight not you
um you supposed to give in your dog is
underweight so like newbies

sardine yeah so I'll do something a
sponsor but it's still healthy for them
as before just ear over I just have a
lot of you know three corners because
the duardo drops it a lot so we always
find out me point in there too and I
don't feed them any human food like they
don't get any human food at all
