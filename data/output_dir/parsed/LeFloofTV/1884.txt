out of my face

value oh no you go head over your eyes
it's gonna change thank you so guys
trying to see what uh what we just
picked up oh yeah
it's the game changer it's a game
changer that's Nene's they're doing her
exam questions and answers this is like
look at 21 euros for this CD
that's such rubbish and then they change
it all the time October 2011

face see you grumpy face like a grumpy
face no she knows your fear but yeah
you're gonna do it Nene's huh you're
gonna do it 2013 the year that Dean is
there to drive that is of course it
demands war right and the 21st of
December this year at the end of the
world which would be annoying which
would be inconvenient let's put it that
way but I'd add it
so I'm taking the dog for a walk ease
that right yeah it's pretty go start
right here I am oh geez
unfortunately Bianca has to wait 40
minutes for her walk because she gets
well last they all get a bit of 20
minute walk 20 to 25 minutes
honestly it's putting more than 20
minutes but I walk her over an hour so
it's like think it's like an hour in ten
minutes or something I thought so they
all get a little over 20 minutes which
is actually it works it would do well
it's pretty good exercise it's dark now
but that's okay because I can look in
people so this is like a stalker hey
seriously hands
who likes to look in people's house it's
not like a stalk or anything but like
when it's nighttime and you can see cuz
the lights are on in people's heads it's
just really interesting to like look in
their houses and you can't get caught
because it's dark outside yeah it makes
me sound like a stalker but it's the
truth so I'll be in seen our first okay
we go let's go gonna get the bunnies
I can you get a bunny sometimes there's
bunnies down here at this part of the
walk see if you can find a bunny guys
