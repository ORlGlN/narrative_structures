the spoons yeah yeah look at you oh so
that's the beach that's connected to our
hotel which we haven't actually gone yet
and I think I read from the college
saying why don't you go to the beaches
of a beach in Sorrento is not actually a
sandy beach it is a pier because there's
no beaches in Sorrento it's just the
Amalfi Coast is like a cliff line but
most of them are just like Perry and you
guys watched last year you want to see
if the beach that we're at was just like
up here you know it's kind of different
so Erica taro is a fantastic plan to
give a meet it is conten war and now
strong we can't look Aleppo of the thing
now she will not let go in the stroller
cars it oh well oh no
so someone left a comment and asked me
to do like a review type thing on the
Debra Cosmetics is their Italian and
then hop Debbie which I guess is like
the younger kind of one but Debra looks
interesting I just always get kind of
overwhelmed they don't really know what
to try out like there's so much or they
don't you know what twice I didn't get
anything I just I don't ever know what
to get like with a new brand I just
gravitate towards the ones that I know
no or the ones that I've heard good
things but so if anybody Italian has any
recommendations with regards
Debra or any other Italian buns that are
right there let me know exact same I
like you know when I buy like Treyarch
Call of Duty games then there's new
games but activation I'm like I know
that Rockstar North Korea and good games
many possums
you know you gravitate towards the
brands that you know we have a
photograph on that bench also framed so
Anna's over in the Moschino soar she's
like I'd love to go in there's wrong
mass like you ten minutes I'll go over
to the park here with Amelia well it's
not really a part I actually have no
idea who that is
