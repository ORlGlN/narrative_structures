morning a nice day maybe it was actually
still sword because I have
I have such a huge breakout on my face
from like I know it's wrong the
pregnancy because usually with my skin I
always broke it on the forehead like
always that was like my area of like
breaking breaking it with all the time
never anywhere else maybe like a little
bit in my t-zone you know Dan here
whatever but never anywhere else but
with the pregnancy it's being like my
cheeks my chin jaw like just all around
this is the lower part of my face and
not my my forehead my forehead is much
clearer so it's so weird and like
sometimes it kind of is like one spot or
two and then other times like today it's
like so many of them like I can't even
cancer man it was really sore putting on
my makeup like it was like
you know like because every time I touch
my skin it's like and even when I'm not
touching like this one right here hurts
and like it's just not nice at all
so my one of my best friend's is
pregnant as well and she told me that in
the second trimester like her skin
cleared off and everything
yeah and it's what Holland Holland who
touched lund
I do sometimes in my head call it Dutch
line because I always forget anyways so
yeah she said that paired up and like
after the first trimester one but I
think my skin is just weird anyway and I
kind of knew this would happen to me I
was like you know one of the symptoms of
some pregnancies is
Acme like breakouts and stuff so I was
like I know I'm gonna get like I'm just
guaranteed to get that my mom didn't get
it like at all so that's one thing Bob
doesn't get it well she wasn't as young
as me maybe that's why I don't know cuz
maybe I still have like teenage acne I
feel like I do sometimes and I'm like I
shouldn't be getting this anymore but I
still do it's like whatever anyways
you are lucky you don't have any acne I
know I never really I don't know I never
really got spots and then I used to feel
jealous because my friends would like

it's a very shaky lift
please take the ticket
picture catches
or should we get how much haha oh yeah
2:22 what you use baby even though it's
Saturday Sunday morning everybody ever
see euros look the two nd between 4a 4b
2a or 2b it's a never-ending cycle of
fun tires down a little bit it's not
that all the way but it's just down a
little bit so it's making a kind of an
odd tracking noise I have to pay for air
crazies not looking at wait a minute so
I found a 10 sander so I'm gonna go for
the one minute mark we can do this one
minute and you know minutes place coin
the game starts now then go over to em
there's a place over there Halfords
think you have that in the UK as well
Halfords and I was looking at they
actually had cuz I was thinking of
getting a sat-nav system for here cuz
it's kind of cool because it drives in
like 3d because normally we're looking
at the phone and you end up dying and
killing your entire family that would be
unfortunate make good blog go I killed
my family will be the title of it and
what they actually have the little
cutting things because the clamp point
that we use at the moment it's in here
somewhere is that although how awesome
it is
um because I want to actually have both
of us in frame at the moment it kind of
fits like that but when it's in frame
see that's all you get in it so I was
figuring oh yeah we should probably get
a much smaller one that would fit
further in here so you can have it all
away back here and then you get much
more in frame that's my plan
poor poor Nina's gonna wait here guys
this is really complicated
so many if you have it's out now we
leave a comment below and tell me which
one you have because like so many of
them and I have absolutely no idea also
the suction cup thing see the suction
cup thing it doesn't actually have a
clamping so I'm gonna have a look in
Dixon's in store and see if I can find a
tiny little tripod thing or in PC world
does that might actually work better but
I'm yeah helping out with the Sat Nav
have no idea I've only ever used my
iPhone I remember actually no look at
all anywhere crap which I like every
store Argus Dixon's Howard's nothing all
the sat-nav stuff but they don't have
the jacking and no one has a small of
tripod to fit the little car campaign so
I'm gonna improvise and make my own
device which I'm pretty sure I could
make with myself all right people we
need an emergency munch
he's an emergency in one situation how
about some hope it's not full though
honey
oh yeah they're all my team a cheese
you're kind of like Xena the warrior
princess yeah you like knock someone out
like they're gonna let us cross I've
been gonna get to butter fried chicken
the fries and the sweet corn this means
that we don't forget dinner later on
though you know stuff like a snack later
on that's kind of cool when you have you
know where you can have breakfast for
dinner know what is it

tiny one but I think this might actually
work in the car also I look at this
right 220 which is the one that will use
vlogging which is like computing they
don't make them anymore they don't sell
how much that means the only one of
those 24p with ten anything film so I'm
actually buy another one just to have
