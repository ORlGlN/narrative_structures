we're going to the beach
every time I say yay I was like man
what's up
you have Timmy wait we're going to the
beach first time this year's yeah first
time this year
yeah first time this year going to the
beach every day
I was like yeah you're way to the beach
didn't seen us first time ever at a
beach how cool is that and she's gonna
love it
she's probably gonna get sick in this
car journey because there are a lot of
we should give her some ginger nuts I
gave her guys I'm still I'm still
suffering shock this morning I woke up
and had vicious nightmares I've been on
a tree swing that lifted off the ground
and jumped up and down and it was the
most traumatic experience of my entire
adult life and I feel that I'm suffering
today because of it I under their hand
want to go again yeah when he was
editing editing it up I was like oh my
god I want to do this all over again
I'm so annoyed that I didn't go on the
octopus with Erika's at the end of the
day
she was like please please and emmalin I
saw it tiny bit sick and we just knew
that if we went on another ride we would
probably be sick so I know that's crazy
things slowly take off yeah that
actually was not
no was it because it's not that it's
it's not the height thing or the
spinning that didn't bother me it was so
painful on my back I have like bruises
all over my back because it's just a
weird like motion that you're doing and
like you're being tossed into the air so
the thing that's keeping you in you keep
leaning into it way too much
like for a natural kind of like crappy
thing that was a pheasant peasant
I'm not a pheasant plucker I'm a peasant
 son say that 10 times fast anyway
so then what I was watching it back in
the editing thingy when Johnson was
editing I was like I should have gone on
the octopus I'm so annoyed that I didn't
but now we're going to the beach which
is a lot more relaxing than Sunderland
well first on the people like there are
some rights that Emma and I were on and
we're just like this is really nice and
relaxing and then something it just goes
all crazy like the battle goes off when
you hear the bass that's it see what I
get on your right the minute thing comes
down I'm like I need to get off I need
to get off you know too many moving
parts too many factors you know it
doesn't work I don't know I'm such a
little baby for that I'm not afraid I'm
not afraid to drive anywhere at any
speed I drove motorbikes like 200 miles
an hour across Europe I was like thanks
cars why I don't like like even if my
new head is right which I don't I
probably wouldn't drive like good price
so we're honest and all the time because
I just I don't like it like I don't
enjoy it that's why I still even
learn which ammonia will learn this
summers is like it's kind of it is
important obviously which is hate it's
like like I understand stop and go why
are there gears
why is there any need for any other foot
movements at all anyway
and we didn't bring her our bathing
suits because we're both it's kind of
cool like it's not like for housing
