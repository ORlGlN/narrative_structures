refer that to like my room is in like my
room is like maybe you just call it a
study or the officers on like that you
know me and so we do actually sleep in
the same room together nuts

other very much
some days more than others generally we
do are just marriage is tough work lads
but as long as they in the core of the
relationship your best friends and
myself and honor our best friends before
were married before we're parents at the
core of it because someday someday and
melee and Eduardo will move off and
leave home and go out into the world and
conquer and we'll be left alone and it's
really important that when we're left
alone that we still love each other and
we still have our friends because we're
gonna be stuck with each other all right
