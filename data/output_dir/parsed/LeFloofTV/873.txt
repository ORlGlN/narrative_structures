oh and in case you didn't know friends
and you're wondering why the vlog was
either an hour early or an hour late I'm
too tired to do the maths right now is
because GMT Greenwich Mean Time where I
live has actually gone into daylight
saving I'm not sure if it's a winter one
order whatever anyway the time has
changed here so the vlogs are on an hour
earlier or an hour later whatever time
it is for you they're still on the exact
same time for us but time has changed
for us time is relevant but thanks for
watching today's video
