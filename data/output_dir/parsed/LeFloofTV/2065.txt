guardian is I don't know making a little
M stay with the stick and all this stuff
onto your secure is how to go skewer
I think we're gonna make some skewers

your face smell of a barbecue family and
friends what more could you want
so leave me a comment what is your
favorite team to barbecue we're finished
now we're leaving we bought lots of
stuff but I'm not gonna show it just in

gonna watch it the videos so I know he
just I think he watches them it's really
nice he watches them like to support our

doesn't sound like it's that bad so I
bought the fuel now I gotta make the
back you this is real this is real like
make your own you didn't make it and
then cook it and this is you can open
all right first problem here is opening
it oh my god
15 euros what a deal huh 15 quid for all
this and three piece toolset nice this
has got me epic guys this is the first
barbecue I've had in like so long
very downside of course the only thing
we're missing is probably the beers
because
that drive pregnant wifey although you
could walk home to our heads from here
but I'm I don't think preggers really be
up adventure so here's what have to wait
till next week because our hotel is
actually in the center of Sorrento well
it's actually at the end but Sorrento
tan is ravine there is very very small
and it's like on a cliff but our hotel
is like on the cliff but the cliff is
actually the main centre so okay I made
184 I'm gonna try my best to get this
done before the Sun Goes Down so we can
actually have a barbecue huh I realize I
have actually build the barbecue you
know that list of things that I have
built you just go ahead and add barbecue
to that oh yeah we cannot do a wheel so

Denmark girls not like Russia one was
crazy but an when I attend Andros like I
know they're gonna vote for us so I feel
like we have an unspoken agreement with
each other yeah
