good morning friends
good morning Alessia with her book
Edouard owners iPad Mini and iPad what
do you watch a mr. grumble scrambled
eggs so let's use reading this book is
it better last yeah huh is it your
favorite book harder watches the
weirdest things he finds that
appropriate right now you only took that
and as you don't be listened to what I
love is that always like to give a girl
screaming turn that off there is a bit
of a problem on YouTube at the moment I
think what people are watching there
like sometimes Bardo watches these peppa
pig videos and then it cuts to this like
weird stuff like into classic Donald
Trump speeches in the middle of a Peppa
Pig video it's very odd and of course he
finds them mean it never finds them
or the weird ones or people are doing
weird things but the problem with it is
that it makes them like one to do the
thing that they see so like if it's like
a baby or something crazy like that then
the kids will want to do that and that's
what it becomes a problem like this bad
baby here oi oi
she did oh she did he did he is stealing
and he found something worth stealing
