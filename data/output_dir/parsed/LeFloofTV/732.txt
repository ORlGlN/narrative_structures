on yesterday
it was nice being in the garden letting
the kids play in the garden a bit and
finding on our toys that we hidden away
for a winter and then this morning was
kind of nice I don't want to jinx it
though I'm afraid of admitting if I say
it out loud maybe maybe it'll go away
it's kind of like if you buy a barbecue
it's gonna rain
Eduardo's home from swimming did you
have fun did you swim did you put your
head under the water no what did you do
