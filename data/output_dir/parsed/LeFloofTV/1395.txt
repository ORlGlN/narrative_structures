falls apart feel like every single vlog
somehow ends up with me blocking from
the bed but I went for a quick nap
actually didn't not that long because I
had to make things just going around my
head because I keep being afraid that
I'm going to go into labor like in the
evening time like you're at nighttime
and
I won't have enough energy and I know
like the adrenaline will kick in or
whatever but I'm just always scared
because I'm so tired right now that I'm
always scared that I won't have enough
energy like to push so that's why I
always try and take even like a half
hour nap every day just in case just to
keep those energy levels topped up I
don't know if that's silly but anyway so
I was just like editing and um blogging
and stuff I have like Monday through
Wednesday of next week
done so if you guys get like videos of
me and I'm still pregnant even though
I'm not in real life don't be confused
because that just means I just by
pre-record like everything now so I'm
kind of like sorted out with that and
we're going to my mom's house tonight
for dinner
excuse me and it is torrential raining
like it's absolutely gross outside
that's the other thing I was thinking of
I was like I don't want it to be a
crappy day when jr. arrives because I
remember Amelia well I don't actually
remember it because I didn't get a
chance but so I thought day but the day
that she was born apparently was a
really sunny lovely day and granted it
was a September not March but still
March or April sorry it's April thank
you for getting it April but um yeah so
I mean it should be nice but it's just
so horrible at today and I don't want
him to be born on a yucky day I wanted
to point him like a sunny sunshiny
spring day it's not too much to ask
seriously I was giving me a hard time
because the stupid wreath this Easter
read that she put onto the ice okay fell
down when I was showing Amelia and I
like she's try to like tiptoe outside
the door so the thing doesn't fall that
it's like made up of eggs and I'm
showing me I just like open the door
