big scene up because she's a little bit
too small to play with everybody so
we're gonna go home now because they
don't wanna push seeing that too much
because number one we had I'll be like
anyone could it'll walk at the start
style thing hopefully maybe today maybe
tomorrow because we're coming up with
some ideas of selling it cheaper because
because we want to do it ourselves you
know and delivery aides were pushing
this like you know the pricing
structured the way they wanted to change
in all this of us talking about blogtv
you know and we're kind of looking at
like okay like to sell it as an actual
book you know the cost is a lot higher
because you know we gotta we gotta cover
like the printing cost distribution cost
like all the other costs that are
involved in it and then eventually after
we're getting a book you know we're not
we're not really making any money on it
so don't be thinking like we're
pocketing all their your change but what
we found is that maybe maybe if there's
enough one eye maybe we could sell it
online you know I get started a PDF or
an e-book style um maybe some comments
let me know but what I'm doing now is
I'm putting together the website so I'll
make this in 3d if it'll look it'll just
what you guys think is that like totally
awesome it's all Anna's books
those books it's not like super cool and
awesome I just whip that together that's
a trouble look at it just what it looks
like yeah yeah and then we van do it it

so super cool I think it looks super
cool so that's gonna be on the website
what a big thing for the CEO maybe I
should write a book you mean the dog
