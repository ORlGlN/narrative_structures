okay so because the media was a little
bit jealous that oh I have got to go to

a it's his classes party basically I
said that she could have one of her
birthday presents early which I know is
kind of like a bit I shouldn't have said
that but it's like a small present that
I really wanted to give her anyway so
no peeking
I can see you peeking close your eyes
right your hands open do you like them

paper you want okay so that's a fun
activity that you can do now that

get them okay
