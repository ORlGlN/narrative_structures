it into the Google machine waiting for
like the last ones
right I ran it through I didn't because
I'm so like not hip to the Giants at all

and stuff and she was really funny you
know so happens that Friday goes in it
yeah I know and even goes out was saying
she was like oh my god Rebecca Black is
actually really pretty like she's kind

but not to any cool that Katy Perry on
straight to be in her music video like
how amazing is that
yeah laughter yeah but anyway so he
watched it last night I had watched it
just like of it say like two weeks ago
when I found it through glozell and I
was like I feel like I'm the last one to
see this video cuz
everyone always talking about how you
were in a second last one yeah because I
hadn't seen it so I was the last one
and also that happened to us with well
know what happened to me with the actual
Friday video no I - yeah you saw it on
time I saw it like ages after everyone
else and I kind of knew what everyone
was talking about but I hadn't actually
ever heard the song then I heard the
song it was just like my trick is that
on the YouTube homepage and the right
hand side there's always trends either
ray william johnson on equals three will
talk about it or it's on the trends
thing so i always watch the trending
videos hoping one day he'll be there
hoping i'll be trendy one day I didn't
get daddy but every like maximum like a
minute long kind of thing yeah you know
our that's music so that's kind of
different oh I was never hate being
never late for the entire time yes you
are you're late yesterday for the last
point my turn of handshake goodbye I was
late everything else
what the hell guy is like is it not
builders holidays that's what they told
on these are canceled orders and cancer
or just don't get holidays
very nice look how happy he looks
she doesn't know we were because we were
told that we couldn't have our fence put
up because it's builders holidays and I
was like first I've heard about because
actually really it's true there are
builders holidays I was taking at the
same time and all these builders here
just because they're canceled people
without building anything
and are building a road I roll fans
built the roads nan Ireland look I think
they only went as far as England as
Scotland or something I stopped
darn it
see I'm originally like a Roman because
I'm half Italian so I can actually
understand where they're coming from and
I know why they didn't come here because
it is too cold and Scotland and is too
cold over here
I am very like what you call that like
cold blooded
yeah I don't I don't I get cold like
very very easily Johnston's always like
it a t-shirt he's like this is fine wait
is your hottie one today yeah and I was
playing and I'm like my dad was like
that as well my mom is not like that she
always wears t-shirts and stuff but it's
my dad because he's a I'm like maybe
third or fourth generation French yes
I'm from pretty I I'm from see my mom is
like total hardcore Irish so I'm
probably pretty much hard forever
ya know but even if you see like
Italians are just like that I've always
been like that to like you have to like
bottle up it's not
over a certain degree temperature like
if you ever see Italian tourists in
Ireland they're always like when
everyone else is running like shorts and
t-shirts they're always wearing like
long sleeve tops cardigans jeans like
scarves raincoats can you see the
tourists from the Antarctic
yeah walking around in like shorts yeah
best don't like Wow oh it is hot do you
guys have any snow right now no it's
just for up for Ireland like if it's a
heat wave or whatever that's like normal
weather for like everyone you know I
guess it's your birthday about two or
three weeks ago it was like I think he
had like 20 or something and we were
like oh my god Ian st lie and say hi to
people like and I wasn't like goose - ha
I love when it's too hot over here
I don't like monkey too much but when
it's too hot in Ireland it's usually not
too hot
innately if it's too hot it's too
I remember when I when you landed like
JFK like in New York and he come from
somewhere like Ireland when they opened
the plane when you walk into that
Airport it's like someone punches you in
the face but a humidity pissed it's like
boom so I went you know when you're on
holidays or whatever and you're driving
in a car or a bus and no windows are
open but it's blowing in flame would it
be like boom hot I don't know because
it's gonna be September so well know at
the end of all this like so
I know it had like I've been in Italy
when it's pretty hot and I've been in
Italy right not tonight but it's still
hot like it's hot for me
not for us I used to have but
it will be nice I just don't think it'll
be like harem
my wedding ribbon hams no no one
readings in the evening our weddings in
half past six in the evening
yeah did you not know that I thought I
knew was round yeah it's a dinner
reception
- late because then we can do light
yeah we can just take our time with what
are getting ready and so on
I have 90 palsy
I know exactly why anyone
and I think we picked one for you guys I
went to work but you need a ring for
natural ceremony
doesn't it rewards you Verizon wants to
get a tattoo wedding ring a wedding ring
like their because I actually saw it on
one of those wedding websites that I got
the time and the guy had a tattoo and I
was like
like I didn't really know I would never
personally get a tattoo what highlight I
would never get a tattoo lighter
I like Jonathan's tattoos like their
parts
but
yeah I was gonna like I didn't really
know having so much about I was like
like I wouldn't do it myself but for a
guy to dance man or like a girl
we like to you what I just wanted it's
more program than a train
I never they go yeah I know but I showed
it to Jonathan ever since then he was
like wow that's a really good idea
my mom I told my mom and she was
no an idea no it's terrible
no way
but
John's installation but I always said go
if I ever got married though I would
caught my wife's name on me like
I don't think it's a bad idea
with the room are the detaching thing I
when I first thought of like
this is a shortcut no no
we're on tell you bro hurry
it's compact whoa
yeah don't worry I know where I'm going
so you means let us know what you think
about the tattoo idea a tattoo ring idea
better than earlier by now it's probably
gonna be like very controversial because
some people don't like tattoos at all
it's a little low of tattoos so let us
know like what your thoughts are
yeah remember I do have those I do yeah
it's not like some little nerdy guy Oh
but like no doctors really clean gunmen
so you getting tattoos like can I get a
devil holding up my heart can I guess
Mari Potter with my mom holding my
playstation oh my goodness which is that
what Xena she's four years old yeah
that's a four year old that is insane
what she's had like plastic surgery is
our jaw
that's probably a way attention
extensions yeah
she's wearing so much meat god she's
wearing false lashes show me
lipstick lip gloss lip liner but it even
just so much makeup that it's like
quickly that is insane so Anna's inside
and I brought my laptop with me yo so I
can actually sit here and watch some
shows
although the reflection is a bit of a
problem but this is pretty awesome
because the battery on these XPS systems
last four and a half hours four and a
half hours while streaming a show that's
amazing this amazing battery quality and
it's not one of those big batteries look
it's just like normally four and a half
hours you can get it updated - or like a
bigger one or like four and a half hours
battery that is insane
Oh then was it good yeah yeah I just got
my hygiene thing done and I have to go

I've got about a million oh not here

okay and then you're gonna start there I
started at the same time
Oh what did I do we already do something
oh yes I make my mold thing oh yeah I
hate that thing
I don't mind it yeah and cuz you're a
weirdo awesome one day culture the fanny
ytt
sitting in traffic on the keys of the
Cork City
no holy um no holy I'm traffic so ah it
is and it's only recently used to never
be like this maybe it's cuz you always
get an area or something but it's never
this bad hunter all the pigeons having a
pigeon time
you see one seagull and a seagull in the
mix he's like hanging he's like I'm a
pigeon Archie seagull I don't know what
you're talking about I don't see any
goals any you guys that are married
right we're just talking about
understanding like all you had when you
walk around we're just like with wedding
and ever gonna like film it and all that
stuff you know and then I was just
saying like shrug like the first look
which is this new thing is install first
of all come true but I like meeting up
beforehand taking pressure off I'm just
like what pressure like you know I mean
you just gonna walk over but I care
what's up what's up you look gorgeous -
gorgeous every single day just like you
know you know we're gonna count the
pressure it's just like it's
like it just I don't think it takes away
from
but I think it just it's like you share
that home would you get in all the
emotions like that out of the way so
it's not - well when I - I was like what
emotions like just like aren't you gonna
cry I was like I'm gonna cry like and
just like hey whatever pose and I was
like I did graduate her pose not right
cuz I was just right you didn't know I
had no idea that about when I got down
on one knee and I looked up and I had
the ring on my hand and she's like and I
was like I'm guys like you know what
seriously like I'm I don't cry that much
you know but you get down in that one
knee like you ask the person that you
love to marry you you just something
over what if something happens you just
write what the hell is this emotional
feeling I am feeling here it is this
going bro so is that what's gonna happen
though like and you any ask your
husbands or boyfriends or well my
boyfriend's dead I might so ask your
husbands or if you are a husband did you
cry when you first are like when you're
standing at the way and like I'm trying
to get my brother's wedding I know Mike
everyone was crying our brothers writing
and I wasn't oh because it wasn't my
wedding though you know
like Stefano wasn't
right but everyone else was my dad was
praying oh goodness
Francesco was crying
concealing the
I started bawling because I retired to
you from way and then he gave her a
little kiss and he just kind of like
passed her on this one
what's Francesco gonna do give me a
little kick no my dad was just those
wedding lasts Francesco for a receipt I
know he's such a baby though you know I
haven't know why of a brother Stefan I
was like pretty ugly he would cry or get
emotional like for justice more like my
dad like he would probably cry and get
emotional what Stefan I was like and you
know and he's like really tall guy and
he's just really like businesslike and
and um he like when he had to give this
he was the best man obviously at
Jessica's wedding he had to give it give
his speech and he talked to it the time
this is way before I was born or
anything like that when what they were
really young and they were doing
cartwheels know the bikes and he did one
of a car like he drove my francesco it
was like he drove up a car to do the we
like it was stupid by anyway he actually
only he like hit his head or something
but he almost killed himself and
Stanford all I think was a little like
they must have been like just can't you
know I don't know there by foot right
through each other but I'm like close I
am Yulin sir he had to like I don't
always do something kind that was like
the first time ever not like you
actually thought that he might well he
didn't start crying me got like really
choked up and he couldn't like but
hardly finished and everyone was like
showing about me what's ask you know
he's kind of supposed to do it the best
one is kind of supposed to we've had
loads of that crazy adventures like that
I think boys always have ridiculous
adventure yeah he just we almost died
quite a few times actually I suppose as
like a younger brother you know
something happens to your older brother
yeah yeah well I did have that moment
its iron yeah
that's not for the rocket engine right
close in last night because I didn't
think they're dry you know great it's
all ended up on the ground but they also
do dry actually when I'm on the floor
just kind of annoying just put the mic
up here it's a normal this is normally
what happens when you dry clothes
outside they all end up on the floor so
trying to be clever with making the
dyndns with our limited utilities so I
got some fresh yeah cause you got some
french fries and I've got some fuzzy
edge peas and youporn and stuff like
that but we don't have a microwave and
we don't have a hobby thing so my plan
is to boil the crap out of the kettle
pour it in there put a lid over because
it says three minutes on the boil so I
reckon if I pour boiling water in here
cover it over for like ten minutes
that's probably the same equivalent to
three minutes on the boil right
how much higher huh he's a trainer huh
huh was a chair all right kettle is the
boils pour it in the boiling water and
the veg top house I'm gonna be a my
little stir Sergio's just make sure it's
all awake in there let's just cover that
over tuna contain all day you need to
talk oh yeah you might actually do the
job Johnny mm-hmm I do too Joey
