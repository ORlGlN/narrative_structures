I'm sorry
we're not even double date or single
digits now holy moly
anyway fastest study partner doggie day
care partner you can't have dogs go off
and stand until ounces has broke week
and I was thinking you know who I like
the time you don't I'd like to take you
guys out a little bit of a journey with
a little bit of music and I just in case
so many you guys are new to the old show
any music that you ever hear on this
vlog is being created by me
cuz some people leave like oh what's
that song and where'd you get that into
something like anything because
obviously for copyright and Roth you
know I kind of crap like we only use
anything that we have created ourselves
so I have like what's it called Pro
Tools and I got Pro Tools down box
itself and then you got like different
files and stuff so any music that is
created is created by us now I have made
a couple that I keep using I do want to
put the other day driving into cork I
think I use that one with 12 into can
sail that times you guys what would you
do you driving to consider in that time
so yeah so I might just mop in a bit of
music we'll see how it goes but this is
gonna be like a time lapse of cutting
steena but have you so cool okay let's
get ready good girls Tina okay let's get
this done now
you
so far we get so far in the blade
attendant kingdoms like quite a lot
during the actual cut its leg gets
they're kind of stuck up right like that
you know because I'm quite as good like
the hair so I'll be it's like any time
make sure how he feels stages
guaranteeing us you just get bored
come on don't
now
shall be continued
okay I'll see if you stopped by this
would make this a lot easier okay
like one of the only times well
sometimes it up but just as well I think
this thing off because sometimes you
don't realize how powerful listening is
one touch without the actual plate and
level of singing on it it's like chunks
but oh god I got my daughter's the skin
oh yeah yeah didn't do much in her face
because I'm trying to let her please go
ahead because I want to give her the
same certainty hair for the how he has
some women are throwing like that
I've seen this heck I've done now who do
we have here huh do we have here
there we go
pretty much it now so done here a little
bit of a little bit of debris hence we
call it thankful which she watches
thankfully she washes she's Betty
editing a style that video she needs
that down sneak peek audio and now the
post choppy chop ease yeah she washes
this is like your mother-in-law - you
suck - you kind of like a good thing one
of our lake breeders told us that that's
you've really good team if they get like
they're called sunspots but they're not
like sighs it's not like there's any
somewhere in here anything but it
happens like so things you never see it
but there's on their fur the hair is
over it but I'll be his habit for a
little while but they could have
developed it when they get older and now
we think he now has it and she looks
like small confident spring about
salvation or sausage yeah you tell me
you're so cute and then I'll give got
like doing bigger ones but it's a really
good sign that means like good reading
or something as well or good health
so I didn't realize that Johnson wanted
to take a shower afterwards and I used
both tables that we have the bowler
doggy house now well I washed them quite
regularly so it's not a big deal you
just watch the dogs regularly and now I
