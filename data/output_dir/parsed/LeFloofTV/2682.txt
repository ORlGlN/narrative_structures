our first one I thought the pace of the
first one was really really good because
it just kind of moved along and it was
like nice this one was a bit like I
don't know started off and it was like I
was trying to
to develop the story and what he's been
up to himself and then it sort of went
from that blue to a massive story really
really quickly built up this archetype
character an evil man I was gonna like
destroy the world that worked on this
huge device for ages made out his robots
come alive I'm like we're in the moment
that he stand upon his plan to destroy
Iron Man but in like ten minutes of same
time it was all over and Iron Man was
like yeah when his friend I was like huh
