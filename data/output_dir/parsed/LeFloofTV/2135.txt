this morning I like the rest of the
world thinks that everybody in Ireland
is out like drinking and causing fights
like we watch 30 rock yesterday remember
but it's like this is actually but it's
really like in our land on st. Patrick's
Day it's nothing it's a good shopping
Mick it's my colleague okay it's
actually what do you guys think we
should get for for I guess for a guest
as a guest going to a christening what
do you think that we should get a child
because I feel like at Christmas they
don't really give toys and so first day
but at a christening it's more like
practical like yes I'm going to buy you
a baby grow and a candle and a silver
bracelet and some ornaments or you know
it's very soon yeah what are we gonna
get like and then obviously Jonathan's
godson's it all but that's great yeah
the day after well that's fine because
obviously you can get a toy or whatever
hey grant st. Patrick's Day parade my
point like consists of eight pointer hit
on them anyways but yeah so you are
looking for you know
give me the feel for them yeah like what
we get because like I feel like clothes
is probably the safest option or like
some kind of cute and ya know but they
grow so fast them yeah I get them it
just it's gonna be over I know at the
point of getting close is so that the
parents don't have to worry about you
know you get like enough clothes that
they have like enough for an orgasm like
yeah I want to see I know but I
brings toys I don't know like I don't
really care men I'm trying to remember
but I think a little pear crisp uncle we
got like napkin a silver enough can ring
we got like brace a silver bracelet for
your communion yeah you got a napkin
ring but no yeah we all have silver
napkin rings with our names engraved in
them yeah but then you the family would
have to keep up that tradition you know
no no I know I'm just saying that like
this is an example of a shoe boy yeah
that's cute Oh
booties where'd you get those shoes for
kids and a shop for children
they're not so much easier you know
that's not true it's just that he's
dream yeah he's three so it's like
you're obviously gonna get a
three-year-old like a toy hmm rather
than like in the pointer oh no are you
and I'm a book actually is about a book
and three yeah hey Twilight yeah or like
you know one of those cardboard you know
the ones that don't have actual pages
they're like cardboard
are you tons of them very small but no
you could get them like um bat toys okay
you wouldn't be read by the toy is ready
to go with that I got that one down got
Dylan's Sorna guys just give me some
comments what to get a stone Ian yeah
Austin is is christening yeah - know
what we should get for a baby's
christening this is also what we do on
time
Patrick's Day we run from the rain why
is it so rainy it was funny there was
fun in the sky
although I did hear that it was raining
in Dublin this morning so obviously this
is the Dublin rain as a has made its way
thanks a lot for that bet it's sunny in
government right now
I got a past hours
yes take
the chicken thing meats I think maybe
they're better for like more fast food
like people's own self
still afraid though we're just getting
those a wine
why not
I remember being a while yeah like an
Isis or a nice mozzarella house on Nepal
a tree behind you
is it
let's go so we decided to try this
bracelet and we almost went to Nando's
kind of like walked in and looked and
then we just ended up back here that's
not real
all right so this is the second time
we're gonna get this place to go so I
hope it works that better there's time
around mm-hmm they don't better having
fun so one of the things you know I
always gotta make the crisps in place as
well
one of the things about this place is we
came didn't even get the bread which is
like the appetizer bribe you normally
put on the table but everyone else knows
everything the restaurant seem to be
getting the red
and I usually never
what's the point but it's the quick
meant about waters and they were like
yeah
tackle panels for the
what's going on it is reminiscent you
only don't have like different levels
like we're in with the poor guy yeah
yeah so we're gonna check the seat if
they drop over the right water and the
right brake so far it seems better than
this better service than the first time
I got a count zone
you got an oven pizza so I'll let you
know if the Redcoats okay
all right to the water right and as you
can see though
so that's one tick down the wrong water
people let's eat the bread comes so we
didn't get the bread
so no bread and Irish water would you
get anything that fish for eight months
nice fancy my jungle this is some jungle
all right oh yeah they said on my
calzone which is crazy like it but it
looks like a massive jungle this one
underneath is it
I just don't know he's just wrong
