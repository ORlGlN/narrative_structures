estimated that's probably more but I
don't know then looking my food I needed
16 26 look at my fridge I got up
yesterday at like seven and I brought a
really a doughnut like eight or it was
actually a little bit beforehand because
she didn't feel like eating for some
reason and yeah I came down at like 8
o'clock and I started screaming at my
fridge I was like I swear I just I'm so
weird but yeah I just had like this
sudden burst of energy and I wanted to
clean my fridge so I did I may actually
have the first one of my music video of
things done a lot sooner and I had
taught it as it did because while I was
sick I wasn't doing much you know it's
kind of like working a bit on it but um

to clean out there's like no way in hell
that I can get everything I want to get
done you know like I really want to
start getting the ball rolling with
learning to drive and all that stuff but

point where I felt like all I was doing
was heads work and I mean not even
obsessively cleaning just like doing the
basic stuff that you have to do every
week and I was struggling to get
everything done because this has is
pretty big plus minding the media and
the dogs like the dogs work you know
