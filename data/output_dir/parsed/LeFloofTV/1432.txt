like I know Ireland you can have pretty
much the same weather but for some
strange reason when we used to live in
London it's just so hot all the time and
it's probably just because it's like
such a big city and stuff like that it's
probably smog and some chemical reaction
to all the industry there but still it's
so warm and he doesn't make sense we
didn't inform it it was kind of similar
to a this here in Ireland and even
though you think Foreman is way much
more subtle under Steve dinner you know
