good morning afternoon because it's kind
of like the afternoon because we spent
the entire morning trying to sort out
the t-shirts and I think we're almost
there we've if you got an email from us
yesterday
could you please as soon as you can
email us back the information because
we're missing like addresses or based on
sizes and then some people it's like I
know some of the names but then I think
it might be like your parents is a
murder so I'm basically taking
everyone's address from PayPal so if you
use PayPal to pay and that's the address
if for some reason your address you know
that you have paid to PayPal and your
dress is different to the dress that
you're standing in till I made sure to
actually say me that's pointing out
itself 25 payments were waiting for it
so 25 people haven't paid yet and that's
the only reason kind of under delay here
because I'm trying to give everyone the
opportunity to actually follow through
on this and because at some point we're
gonna have to put a stop because the
wedding is like in like very soon and I
want to try and get these out even said
I know a couple of people in like got
something from South Korea or Australia
like they're probably not gonna get
theirs for a while because I don't know
like getting all right post that through
me just throw it but people know I'm
they're gonna get them quick in the UK
and then you know way it kind of works
like but 25 people were waiting for to
get paying them from so that's the kind
of delay them so if you got an email
from us about either payment or about um
your size you dress just make sure to
get back to us quick as you can lad
what do you charms still in my system
already was a busy morning for morning
now I think it's time for some subway we
haven't we haven't uh nailed on the
subway up the road and I think it's
about time we tasted some subway crossed
my lips some of that stuff to get some
of the addresses was all in here this is
DM the subscriber what it's in case you
people thought yeah you got left behind
that's Colossus but um
yes you're trying to find the time to
put it back up but um everybody's here
oh hello
how about you this is help me little bro
what are we looking for Albie huh
Hello Kitty monster duckies rock stars
but yeah all the stuff is here guys
and she he just did all got moved I put
it in a box there because there's the
cork board up there but it's try and
find the time where am I going to put it
so I might just actually rebuild it and
put it over there yeah yeah but just
gazing trying to turn all that or
something like that no holes anyway no
bows a way I really want some subway
when Dean was taking like a billion
trillion years to get ready she's like
you've been drying your hair for about a
zillion years are we almost ready
you can drying your hair for a million
years
oh yeah I wanted to point something down
somebody I'm not going to take tonight
can I have that tonight can I have that
all right go ahead someone say about the
Lucky Charms right look right this thing
here where it actually has the warning
okay because as you can see it's
actually separated see see the way it's
actually like being put on you know it's
a sticker over it
so maybe the American one doesn't
actually have the warning on it but when
it got imported into Europe they looked
at like all this information here and
they taught you can't be given that to
the children so yeah so maybe the
America one if you have an American box
it might actually have the warning on it
you know I thought that was kind of
interesting you someone said like I
never noticed a warning before and maybe
it's not on maybe that's why they don't
have merit maybe they're legal think
it's like contraband it was smuggled in
so come on beyond the noise right now
I just put on makeup and for like no
reason whatsoever this ayah right there
just got some heat you read it was the
kind one I so ridiculous and then I got
into the car and I was annoyed about
