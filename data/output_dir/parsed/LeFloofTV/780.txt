stormy here now make up your mind you're
gonna choose like how am I supposed to
prepare for this David keep changing
their heart into
if I interview said I wasn't something
that oriental in ho sounds like we're
still it's a hard decision you know with
the buying or building job you know any
minute like when you're doing all the
finances and all the mots it's like the
mortgage is just such a it's such a big
a man of death you know and I just feel
like I need like a realistic song in my
head I would love to be able to secure a
property and be mortgage free within
five years and I just feel like it's a
huge security blanket for the children
because my home was taken away from me
when I was a kid and it's a river it's a
real it's a hole in my past you know we
go back to Anna's house we can go to
your childhood bedroom when we can see
stuff you know I feel like there was a
hole in my past I have a memory of my
childhood that room and I always thought
I was gonna bring my children there and
showed him in my back garden where me
and my brother used to have Apple fights
and stuff but it doesn't exist anymore
for me yeah you have to be there we
didn't have Playstations back in the 80s
we had apples and abundance of apples so
we go and either into the garden and we
like have an apple fight it was fun but
you know enemy and so I feel like by
getting the children's home but you just
it's just it's just it's such a hard
decision you know it's not it's not a
light decision hmm
and it's like there's a lovely look it's
it's a bill that I don't want stability
Hayes you know I understand why you know
but look we've got a lot of it's out
with a lot of different building

pricing and stuff it's just so such a
big one to pull the trigger on you're on
at the same time we're trying to launch
our startup company you know at the same
time there's so much going on so much in
the air but where we're at here looking
at a house which is really nice
it's in a really nice area you know and
it's what it's a house where
it wouldn't be it wouldn't be a
new-build but just a lot of development
work needed you know it needs to be
modernized but it's in a really good
area and it's safe you know which is
good it's a hard decision being a grown
up in it nope no it's not that one
