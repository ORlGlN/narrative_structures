Morrow Steen well guys this is day one
of no treats for a week
hey you using cocktail sweets yeah but
this is Patrick's Day week you got a
stylist all right you started back to a
package today wherever you are all right
I've got an unfolding can Bri and Apple
tell me how much fun to be honest let's
be honest are seeking to do hang like a
bar of chocolate I'm putting it inside
and like an emergency blasting you know
breaking peso emergency bar chocolate
smash it open away just in case we're
about to murder each other you know we
should have a bar of chocolate that he's
just reaching grab remember ages ago
when I was coming in here do it the
lollipop lady look who's back
lollipop lady the lollipop lady is back
I haven't seen her in ages coming down
this way I just thought I'd share that
with you if anyone remembers back in the
lollipop lady I think before bemused by
the name a lollipop lady because I think
you guys would call her a traffic warden
or something boring like that who wants
to go to a traffic warden
no thank you who wants to go to the
lollipop lady but she can freely box no
she look like a lollipop no
but she does hold a giant lollipop no

banana that's what I'm gonna get today a
banana

and I ain't no chocolate oh but it's a
different story now I find that it's
probably a lot easier when I'm sitting
in the studio and I was done access to
sweeties or sometimes actually the
coffee time was alright because I think
