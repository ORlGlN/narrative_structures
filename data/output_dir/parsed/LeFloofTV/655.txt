you watching the engineering Oh mom I
don't know my channel the bikes are
still in the car I haven't even taken
the bikes out of the car lads Oh such a
Sunday it's Bank Holiday Monday which is
technically double Sundays or is it
double Saturday that's good what do you
think here I think back when I had more
of a structured employment situation I
always taught by holidays were more like
double Saturdays not all Sundays it was
like Friday night you go out Saturday
night night you'd go out like a Saturday
night but Sunday night back on the
Monday night you would go out like it's
a Saturday night and then Monday will be
the Sunday rather than you treat Sunday
and Monday is double Sundays that make
any sense team videos let me know if it
was a public holiday public day off like
on a Monday would you would it be double
Sunday for you or triple Sunday mm-hmm
triple Fridays provide enormous meals
always throws at it I don't know I was
you guys only when he know me since I'm
making videos but I was I was a bit of a
socialite as the younger lad I liked I
