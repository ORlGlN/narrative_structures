seven thousand four hundred and sixteen
million six billion quadruple trillion
hours to get ready to go somewhere how
do you respond to these claims near
Ragland Donna about forty minutes put on
I stopped this morning you're having
problems are you we're bending over you
look really pretty down looks like a
real letter has that have a set of big
scar oh that's nice
the choking effect yeah looks good okay
Joe these pants are open oh you're
wearing two things
oh it's wrong rear end yeah look you
never you never actually noticed that
with the thing up it's just sometimes it
gets confusing
because everything is black yeah yeah
which is which is a cool invention I'm
gonna totally get one and you wouldn't
notice at all we'll just think you're a
regular member of society you haven't
got a person growing inside of you
hey it's okay it's okay I talked to I
talked to the scarf people and they said
hey it's okay you should probably just
go in at this car
at all over there go ahead Dean I just
said that's our family seemed obvious
how about you dad
come on let's blow this place
come on ninis oh my god what why are you
just sitting there looking know why is
he waiting you to put it back which one
are you taking so we're taking none
let's go
okay I don't steal your scarves okay
that looks amazing let's go
what like a house that's it you're
accessorized tune-up earrings done let's
go no don't do it Tina
I see you looking or no I thought she
had stolen oh yeah yeah she didn't did
you
she still needs everything know what she
used to have like no like concept yeah I
know this food and what was this you

Grand Meyer I'm resorting to the old
googling googling system you don't
believe my messages my message is Nina
all right Maps okay where am I hello
hello oh look improved negation accuracy
ooh okay all right that's where we are
now where the frak is glamour all right
save it on a map no no it was just when
you got in the back he's quite small
she's so
they stink it's an mx8 by the way or
what I say
so we would get to the crash very
quickly this is cool cuts never seen an
MXC it's just really small in there
but many damaged space either
no he isn't all like it's not a shame
she isn't that
okay okay okay it's ridiculously
impractical I pretty much made up my
mind I'm pretty I'm uh I was like 99%
sure and I probably would have bought
that car yesterday like I'm pretty sure
I know in a car I want but once you find
a car you want you need to convince
yourself that you definitely want the
way seeing other cars so oh I do
ridiculous like and we just look at the
rx-8 you know and it's like 250 brake
horsepower it's like on the ground
Japanese you know we would get to the
crash in ten seconds
it's so quick but you know it's like
yeah no I don't think it's rust like I
just well I don't know I'm just like
playing about I'm just kind of you know
making sure I definitely want to get her
car so it's kind of once I get into it
because theater car I don't stay in the
batty applet because that we may not
actually buy that car what the one I'm
thinking I pretty sure we're gonna
probably go it's a German car it's
German brand so when I got into it you

luxurious and clean and nice and stuff

more plasticky in just a little bit you
