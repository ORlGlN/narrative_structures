- good plan - good plan now and you guys
a man point on Saturday guys we was
talking there and I bloom someone can
answer me this question because I don't
understand and I was thinking about this
you know when you're giving birth right
the midwives then you know the answer
why did a midwife why did not need
mothers caregivers nurses quietly a
midwife
is she my wife like my middle wife or
something then do it like the
traditional sense I gave my wife
is an old name thing you know I
yeah like she would do to breastfeeding
for you she just embarrassing
yeah yeah to possibly be like
on
Noddy
and I don't know it sounds like
surrogate or something I don't know but
if you guys can leave me a comment now
don't just like say whatever you just
think in your head right there does I
actually give me my truth is that my
daddy called me or is it remember from
my even like polishing
they have shooting with
she
mother was not
go on the girls in are they gonna do all
that first you know I'll be handy and
you got it can you get a minute
easy in that Center as far as necklaces
I do like the fact that it's non-medical
I love the back because no doubt there's
rain and it's not even nurses it's so
and even we were looking at the end the
hotel rooms let's say look I don't they
so now it's like the really luxurious
move out like a big bathroom area and
then a huge tub of that area and then
you can see like all the clothes in the
right area for the medical equipment
you've needed what you might even need
that it just look really nice you know
it looks like total Apple luxury so
decided to spend the weekend
yeah yeah
cracking up
yeah I know totally cuz we were doubling
like we'd have like a tree or for them
we'd have to choose to be so many
Cazares and there's so much class
division there's so much different
divisions up where you from and class
and money and all that crap you know
whereas in quark it's like one image are
they combined into one in maternity
hospital and everybody in the monster
it's seven everyone in Monster close to
that place to be lit and it's kind of
more equal and even because childbirth
is not really about division or classify
or anything it's just about a natural
thing and you want like the best you
want the best you don't want to be
segregated you know want to be around 1
1 or 2 everyone else is doing because
everyone else doing it and it works you
know that's how I feel about that
so what the hell is a midlife all right
we are going to collect my free weather
car

beyond that PC world so like four
bachelors or Curry's sort of actors buy
their TVs we're all grown-ups now we're
going to mother care mmm look at this
thing moves your Spanish you put Moses
in there I like this one yeah you can
have you take this down and turn into a
bed eventually or even take one down hmm
like the thick ones though I feel like
these ones over here just they're just
kind of like I don't know flimsy or
something think it I said oh I like this
one cause it does this look fun now
is that they don't do anything changing
cable Wow
yeah it is with the changing table on
top oh that's so nice
I throw carpet and everything yeah yeah
you see it has an actual changing thing
in half and is this come up and down no
but you cannot do it the one I found was
definitely it's nice and I don't I want
one to come built I'm not building it
okay I don't want it for my key or
flat-packed
okay I wanted to comb build I don't
trust my skills of building well bury my
child he has the same was 659 350 whoa
that's dealer this entry this month only
ah factors I'll take two no it's good
early I think but that looks like you
could fit like a six-year-old in there
yeah because they this one changes into
a red we think it's you can't read I
think it changes into a better I like
that it's really nice because what we're
going to put them originally initially
that's perfect size I think you know
more like that deep fried a darker wood
although uncle's are bad well I bet it's
awkward just a plan to murder
Oh baby hangers the city geared when
she's doing her room tour or he's doing
his room door boom
oh that looks so comfy I feel that now
get that myself
that's how I feel if it's soft that is
Oh Oh baby's face
this is blankets for blankie look at
this thing
bear mobile from birth also it's
suitable from birth
are they good though you know you know
how you know anything today stimulating
or something like good for a child's
imagination
I was the Moses basket over there and
the car seats in the prams got certified
car seats you guys got any
recommendations from real good car seats
a really good trans or sinner word for a
stroller like is the tree real one the
best one to get or should you go for her
one that flat so I'm kind of wondering
is Lobby we use at regular one but then
this is just like a fad or something
yeah it's cute that's the tree we want
to sell me read but it's not very look a
smaller is it's really mobile and look I
think the cars that's the car seat built
into it this one's you want like because
my sister said that she said her car
seat is broken so if the baby actually
falls asleep she took one to wake it so
you can just put it in hi this is kind
of cool look what's the still it's on a
break anyway
they do have right
or you can go this one look at this one
flicker Ferrari or something
yeah no the same ground
oh he's Ashley maxi Cosi
that's for the two Z's that's what we
getting next time high seas mmm little
better yeah yeah no I know I think you'd
see oh look at the way that fits oh look
that's part of the pram or the trolley
thing let's get a little sip out yeah
they look so cozy don't they oh my god
even says in the name
hey see look look look do it it's it's
in like it's got a thing that builds up
I think you have to probably check the
manufacturer they need to check your car
probably to get one that fits your car I
don't know if they actually all work all
right look check the fifth make sure you
don't know seems good to your car we're
not really there yet so it's we're gonna
have a different car
I like this yeah what kind of money are
these things what what what oh god oh
gosh one told me okay I think we found
the one that we wanted this thing here
Waku Waku
because it has the bad thing that you
want like and then it has this thing
it's not in here I know but we'll just
pop it in which is the light anything
and then on top of all of that how is it
oh no it's because I lifted the chair oh
you know there's a chair yeah this to
the sheriff and then on top - bike comes
to car seats you'll know you've arrested
all hmm it has some sort of the thing
plus cupholders that's really cool you
know cuz I think it's better just to buy
it like you're saying just find a one
time crazy you did it all wrong oh yeah
because that's because like I lifted the
the headrest up and I couldn't bother
cuz I couldn't bother putting it down
there very complicated okay you guys
have this one here there's no if it's
any quick I'm come down I wanted to get
these bump
but with the button opened I just have
this on top and they have one black and
one white so for different like colours
and stuff then it just goes like in the
middle so I can have like a zipper I'm
like you know I think I need one of them
you know after we have like a big dinner
and you want to just like open up button

them for guys as well look at the
clothes I love my bum are they are just
like normal clothes or do they design

hyper light clothes now and you have to
buy time to get early to munchie-t
crunchy tea don't you get some tea hey
I'm trying to draw on between coolness
