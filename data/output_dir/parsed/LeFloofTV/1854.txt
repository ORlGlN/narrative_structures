guys that I wanted Pandora for breakfast
because that was like the tradition
Christmas tradition
my mom gave me one yes shake she bought
like five billion of them at their job
and I felt bad though cause like I
wanted to get my own so this is a
Pandora for those of you that don't know
and I just put the sugar on but I
haven't mixed it up yet so basically you
get like a packet and like breathing it
in right now of powdered sugar and you
put it on top you like dump it on top
and then you get I don't know if I can
do this one-handed this is what it looks
like it's so good especially with a
common coffee
choose you you can get your hands on
Pandora taste it because it's really
good

it's my Oma's birthday today and we
invited them over for originally I said
dinner but and it is dinner but we're
gonna have it in the middle of the day
because it's just easier for her like
she likes to go to sleep go to bed
really early so um and I think she it's
just easier for her if it's in the
middle of the day she has like more
energy and stuff because she is 80 she's
83 today I said on one of my videos that
she was going to be 84 I was wrong only
83 so I'm folding laundry but I think I
should probably stop that and start
doing something else because I have to
vacuum and I wanted to just spot clean
