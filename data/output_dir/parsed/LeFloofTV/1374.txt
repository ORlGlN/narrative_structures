chair and help okay so we did
base part now we're going to put the
filling in which looks like this look
yummy smells so good yeah yeah we're
gonna do that one later okay okay I'm
glad I'd I'm doing two batches because
this didn't really work out as well I
don't know so in picture it looks like
they're nice and swirled and I was
looking through the recipe and I was
like why does it look like to swirl them
like I thought that's what you did with
this type of my recipe like I think I've
seen that before like cheesecake swirled
kind things but I didn't say it anywhere
so I didn't do it
this is what mine came it like um so I
mean the cheesecake is through it but
it's like it's not swirl it doesn't look
right Freddie so I think I'm gonna swirl
the next crash and see how that goes
also the cupcake cases that I got
they're happy they're really not good so
they were very small and a lot of them
they all
pretty much stuck so I had to like dig
them out I'm gonna wash this and and did
the second match and hopefully they will
look better I'm kind of disappointed to
be honest but at least I know what else
next time also in the picture it had two
cases now I know why because they
definitely like overflow and stick so it
could have said in the freaking recipe
go decide use two cakes this could be
they'll stick foot it didn't
I wrote a recipe book I would be honest
okay not like this one alright friend

fun stuff like that it'd be like a tree
house or something want to go you press
this button oh oh I wouldn't put your
face up into that because it could just
fire the second match came out nicer
they look better they look more like the
picture but yeah I wish I would have
known that for those ones at least I
don't know if Taunton really like them
to be honest I'm kind of I feel bit
disheartened right now I don't think you
really like them not much but anyways I
just wanted to do something please ah
maybe I'll just give these to my mom or
something wonder will he notice that I'm
filming this
she's so cute I love how she matches the
brush or the broom okay Jonathan you're
soaking her trying to pin ya the broom
matches hurt her hat
hi honey
uh-huh Oh God
hi this is why I never called that's
pretty much everything I do turns out
like crap this is so weird I don't even
know what I'm making
I just basically took what was what I
could find in the cupboard we didn't
have any barnase sauce I wanted to do
some kind of pasta polonaise last night
at least I know how to make I know how
to boil pasta to what it's like
authentic but I know how to salt pasta
too
aside from that I don't really know how
to do it when it comes to cooking so all
I did was I threw in some sun-dried
tomatoes and some sun-dried tomato I
think was 'since yeah sun-dried tomato
or tomato and garlic saw but it was like
a tiny tiny jar and it was like a
concentrate sauce we didn't even have
anything we had posada but it was gone
off we had no tomato tins no tomato
sauce so I mean aside from the tiny one
that I put in so it's really not looking
great because it doesn't look like any
kind of sauce at all and I've been
cooking this on a really low heat so no
it didn't disintegrate it just literally
like the mints soaked it off or not just
seems great evaporate that's what makes
it so I don't know what this
you like but anyways least yeah now you
guys know that's why it all cook and
we're done
huh I want shine here look how much
better this now oh my god okay just look
so good it's a nice and clean
cig on a little bit of weeding I'm gonna
