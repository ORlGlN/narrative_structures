Oh
so if this is the aftermath of party
cleaned up last night of course so my
mom or my aunt brought over a gift
basket for that she won for her like
four dogs she brought it over because
she had like dog clothes and stuff and
her dogs are bigger dogs so she and she
didn't want any of that stuff and it had
a knit like hand knitted jumper oh my
god the color everything was perfect for
one dog can you guess what that it was
look it matches his bow
it's baby blue and it's actually really
really nice the only problem is up the
rest of the dogs get jealous if like one
dog is wearing clothes they all like
jump on that dog and they bully them so
everyone was trying to rip it off him
but he looks absolutely adorable he
cause little fights I see you anyway
Amelia started the taking down of her
cards already yeah don't mind this sexy
comb over hair I don't know what's going
on in my hair I'm just I feel sick

like a little bit sick or you know you
don't want to make an effort and it's
cold out and you have a little bit of
sniffles and you just want to be cozy
this is like perfect outfit ever but
it's so cozy and it's so warm and so
snuggly and this is all I want to do
like just stay at home and wear these I
also have to work on something which is
kind of exciting I've just decided
coming into autumn that I need like a
huge wardrobe overhaul so I'm actually
going to be going through my stuff
big-time and getting rid of like dumping
everything that I haven't worn in the
past year like if I haven't worn them
for two seasons so I'm just getting rid
of them so I'm going to be selling some
stuff and I am going to be donating the
rest I don't know what exactly yet I
haven't figured X I haven't even looked
at my wardrobe yet but it definitely
needs an overhaul so let me know what
works for you guys like if I were to
sell things like do I do it on eBay or I
think there's another thing called
Poshmark or did I just make that up I've
no idea or do I do it on my blog I think
my blog would be quite messy though so
let me know what I should do for that is
eBay the vest or is there another
platform out there that I don't know
about where you can sell your closet
stuff but yeah oh my god look for also
of all the crowd stuff
I guess everybody's sick it's not just
me
that's you know it's also they're asking
to try it's gonna get dis Familia a lot
safer up remember I'm your kid and to
grow but on you so I'm just watching New
York housewives while I do laundry but I
just want to stop and show you guys some
of this is new and some of this is just
like general laundry but a lot of it is
new Emilia is so spoiled
she got all these new clothes from Zara
from my mom she got this amazing dress
all of these leggings new vests new PJ's
well they're actually they've just been
washed she already more them she got
three pairs of Peppa pajamas she got all
these new headphones and she got all of
these clothes for a size 24 months um
look at this Guess jeans shirt and like
crop trousers so cute so these are all
24 months I'm not even gonna wash these
I'm just gonna put them away and keep
them for that size because I don't even
want to have to deal with that laundry
yet um unfortunately this stuff all got
stained and the stains didn't come out
because I didn't like pretreat than
anything so I hope they're okay because
I do have quite a good stain remover so
I think I might just like treat them
even though they've already been through
wash and see how it goes like they're
not terrible but it's like red sauce you
know that kind of thing so if anybody
has any tips on how to get rid of that
please let me know
