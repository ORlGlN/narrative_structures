oh my God he's in hell
the prison we can smile huh your very
good time having a good time don't mind
Oh silly doggies just look over at her
she was just them sitting there smiling
away using their self
mm-hmm she's so cute still trying to
decide you know one option is like terms
in a car
one option is like you could go with the
safe Snorri it's kind of like yeah it's
a motor vehicle and it's safe and
there's a bit of room for the dogs in an
amine or you can go with that both cars
are like super safe for Amelia obviously
or he knows like the super sexiest thing
and it's awesome for the dog and I left
my sunglasses at home and I'm burning my
eyes are on fire burn burn burn the Ring
of Fire
Johnny Cash it was cool I love the songs
all right man so I'm trying to say I'm
gonna go see this car in here it's not
even a car it's like a SUV and I don't
think all them no truck truck truck I'm
actually passing a giant truck in it I
like can't imagine getting a big truck
so yeah don't look at this car so you
would think of this one that's kind of
hard because like I know I go on about
it I do so much research right now I
don't know if anyone's like that live in
common oh so I don't have the crazy
person but but I'm going to look at
something I'm thinking about it I'll do
so much research and I'll try and find
like my top three picks and then I'll
try and you know look for comparison
sites and then I look at all the
different things and I know I'm really
cautious about buying something big you
know something that costs a lot you know
and I always try and like you know
trying to make sure I make the right
decision and I'm gonna have it for and
what do I need a foreign I cannot grow
in it and gonna be none I mean like I
don't know I'm just I'm just one of
those I kind of obsess on things until I
get them right you know Mimi comment if
you like me or maybe you just want to
maybe just like you just go in or like
whatever I'll take it whatever whatever
travel Trevor so this is the a thing I'm
looking at here get the inside so nice
but if you take it back for the back for
the dogs there's like so much space it's
gonna go let's go for a test drive
take on like you're driven enemies big
before shaking like whoa it's just like
too big so nice no goodness so Amelia
isn't that really awkward stage where
she doesn't fit into any of her
she doesn't fit into her newborn things
they're too small and the zero to three
months are too big so she's like right
in the middle and I don't know what
sized put her in like how high up I feel
like oh my god this side feels so big in
here so like nice thing about this cheap
you know I felt like you know it's
enough room for the dogs it is like
super safe for for a media act is like I
feel like a tank in here like I feel
like I can take on the army
and she's fussy right now she doesn't
know what you want here she wants to be
fed but at the same time she's she's
awake I bet she needs food I just felt
kind of scary you know it's like I'm
like pottering a bad driving around but
then at the same time I'm like I have to
find like an insurance waiver and all
sorts of stuff just even test drive it
it's not like oh god oh my god honey
that feels like a hotel you know you
don't feel that he's like at a luxurious
penthouse apartment on wheels it was
like why did they give me this car how
could they trust jofi they have to stay
dry that that's ready hi hey face what's
wrong but yeah this is a newborn outfit
and it's look it's all bunched there at
the pen or at the crotch area
not right isn't that right and give you
no notes
you're gonna be so cross if I don't keep
you mountaintops right now I'm sorry oh
my goodness I don't even know how to
turn it off
is there an off button oh goodness this
is crazy isn't it it's like it is the
most luxurious car vehicle I've ever
been in in my life
how much space do it be for the dogs
back here you can get that Land Rover
have this like cage and put across there
we can get that installed and their dogs
and have their own window at the back
it's not so cool like this whole are you
down here they should make clothes for
her um sighs there's like nothing for
her sighs there isn't even like one
month to close cuz that's not really a
size so it's really annoying
I just like took apart her hole comes in
the boot I took a part in her hole um
like little drawer over there looking
for stuff that fit and like nothing said
it was either too big or too small
okay I need her now hmm I'm still torn
about it though you know cuz I don't
know it's a tube-like big you know like
a lot of big space and stuff like that
you know I'm gonna try and look at some
other things right the same like twice
she like cuz he changed her oh you
changed her and then she she poop again
your phone it's ringing
now she pooped in her fresh nappy and so
he went changer and then while he was
wiping her she like pooped explode
pooped in his hat twice right and then I
clean it all up and she does it again
don't do it all right
I wonder why it's weird
maybe yeah knowledge yeah I know like we
can hear it here yeah we gonna ice cream
so glad that's your job although I do
the nighttime changings cuz jovis is
like fast asleep
well I can do this what are you telling
them what are you saying them what are
you telling them
I'll be is it boring because you leave
me and oh my god the puppies were
actually is the door opened in stir no I
didn't I closed it cuz was pouring rain
did you see that oh yeah started like
torrential raining and now it's like
back to normal again it's weird
my stretch marks there so like it's so
weird my stomach is so squishy it used
to be like but anyways yeah so the pups
shredded a roll of toilet paper
and I don't think that's gonna fix it's
a newborn
this one Street no yeah you need to
fight well I can't find any zero two
threes there would be nursing tanks
three to six that's true to six no no
there's a ton of vests better zero to
three exterior you like the Old Navy
stuff but I think it's still too big
no that is newborn and it's day yeah
that's all no it's too small it's too
small I know for sure that's too small
guys this new one is gone yeah little
footsies through the boys she's so cute
and I realized I think she has Joe
pisses hairline she's gonna have a huge
forehead anyway because both of us have
big foreheads that's like 12 months or
six months or something um but I noticed
she has like the little of eat her hair
line is going in like a v-shape that's
like Joe Fez I don't think mine was like
that I mean I do have a high forehead as
well but yeah or maybe - maybe I do have
a receding hairline I don't know that's
zero to three but that looks huge
yeah it's better I think to put her in
something big than something small
because her point of the toes get like
smushed and I put her in that this
morning and I was just like I felt
really bad cuz I felt like I was forcing
her into something that she didn't fit
into any more like it barely fits she's
so cute and that stuff is um
that cupcake onesie remember we got her
that in next birthday Connexus man no
cuz you put her in the gray one and she
pooped all over it this is like when I
drank me you drive me like makeup
shopping and clothes shopping and stuff
