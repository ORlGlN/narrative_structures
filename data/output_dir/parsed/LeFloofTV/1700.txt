wanted to hey come on oh I never
mentioned this yesterday I think it was
kind of late by the time I actually took
it but I got sent products as whinging
on Twitter a PR company sent me this
prevalent allergy I was taking this
citrine stuff that the chemist gave me
and it wasn't really good okay it was
booked I would say before I took this my
allergies were like off-the-charts like
really really like putting me to bed
every day doing nothing like I couldn't
even get off I felt so just like
allergic literally but the reason why
they send it to me is because they said
this is good to take while breastfeeding
which I didn't even think of what's the
count I asked you ask the chemist at the
citrine and she said that was fine for
breastfeeding as well so I used this
yesterday and it says it gets to work in
three minutes and very shortly
afterwards my symptoms went away and I
actually could now was evening time so
things weren't like as - does that they
would be during the day like the pollen
and all that but we opened the wind it
was still brighter we opened the windows
and the doors and the first time in like
a couple of days I could actually have
dinner with the door is open which is
nice because it's sunny now at night
