oh good girl oh look at that you got
yourself up hmm huh well done girl
well done
du du jour anything I need right you see
the thing about Hollis at the cops right
the cop fits in fine but I feel like I
could get it I want like a fire cup so I
noticed that I am you know in cost the
coffee and stuff it's the cooks are like
they're small but they're why that's
what I need you know the app but the
coffee cup that I like which gives me
love's coffee it's this fella here but
it's too tall so what I need is a wide
thin base one so can't be any taller
than that let's see if I can find him
but look I have a bit of room or on the
side here so you get a much wider one oh
she's ready she's ready to blow hmm
voila
so much so much so you hope put a bit of
an a bit of a process which actually am
one two three oh my goodness is somebody
wet in the rain
oh you didn't there
oh I had everything blurry that's better
so we came up with a set of a process
which actually works really well for us
um I wake up at about 7:00 right I come
downstairs I let all the dogs head to
their peepees in front of that then I go
upstairs I take care Melia from Anna I
change her nappy then sometimes I change
your clothes
sometimes she pees all over self I
change your clothes and stuff like that
and then I put it out back to bed and I
put Amelia back when I we go back to bed
and we get another like two or three
hours and it works really really well so
almost have a system in place where I'm
not walking around like a zombie all day
long because I I'm not really one for I
would wanna get my sleeping over with
during my allocated sleep time than
napping and I like sit another snapping
itself and just one round napping it's
just I don't being like a fan of it you
know I prepare just close up I don't
know I'm just a ferret um do all my
sleeping one time and then not that for
not because sometimes I feel like when
I'm napping I'm like I'm missing out on
doing stuff you sometimes I have to do
it otherwise it won't happen like for
example playing Dead Island I know it's
stupid but when I go for my nap time
when Anna and Amelia are asleep like
that's my opportune time sometimes let
me get a chance during the day to a play
that for a while but that's like my only
time so it's like weird to them our
sleep and even if I'm really tired
sometimes it's like I'm just going
making her a coffee I played that hide
and I've never gotten hit the place
it's my kids my trick all right let's
get this air looking we'll meet this
morning someone tweeted me yesterday and
she actually am drew a little rocket
ship in paint or something's like I see
a rocket ship in the coffee I think this
morning it kind of has a fish kind of

trying inside like should I be lazy and
like drive across the car park but then
what if there's no spots over there I'll

didn't buy the wood stuff because I
don't really know to be honest there's
like a million options I was like I
don't know anything can I can I do it
without having to sand the wood down
because like I'm Paul said he was gonna
like sand it down to extract like the
water somewhere and then like
revarnished it back up again so I'm like
