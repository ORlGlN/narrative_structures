time you're not gonna like this
what's that like tasty so he's a muncher
now he's a muncher don't don't
tiny and then he he wanted to go on this
side yeah and then like she's closed for
eight like videos never like remember
he's a boy he's a muncher remember I'll
go an inch boss hmm always follow people
she was more of like a snacker yeah
what's that you know what if you meet
all the time where he's like a mediator
just like just a few people
oh yeah thirty minutes he's a he's a
potato and steak man like his dad anyway
I just the birth certificate

his name there I'm looking at his head
right now Wow
the name looks so amazing hi Anna look
at his name isn't it so yeah this will
be the video bTW what we tell you his
name
I don't know we did what it were trying
to be the same I can't go home today
ignore like last time I stayed here for
the whole degree three days and I'm
entitled to one more night
like on our plan but I don't know it's
just it's totally different this time
around I'm not nervous at all I kind of
know what I'm doing you know my boobs
aren't a sore but it's great what is
really sore and this it didn't happen
like this last time because I remember
people are telling me this last time and
waiting for the top and I never did I
don't know why I think it's because this
baby is a lot more of a feeder than a
media was like she's just cluster feed
whereas he just goes in for like the
kill what he's leaving like he just
wants to eat and eat and eat and so
right now I finished feeding him and I'm
having like contractions like it's so
weird and last night I was like why am I
feeling like I'm in labor again but not
like you know proper labor but like you
know they're dirty labor
I felt like all around my lower stomach
and like back I just was contracting and
so I said it to one of the nurses she
was like yeah that's a really good thing
that means that your stomach is going
back down and he's doing that like him
feeding the breastfeeding is doing that
and she felt my uterus the size of a
golf ball which apparently is pretty
small like it's pretty good already now
my stomach hasn't gone back down because
it's still all like but when she they
always like palpate your your stomach to
see what where the uterus is and she
said it's like a golf ball so and then I
bleed a lot afterwards like after
feeding to yourself it's not the most
pleasant experience but at least I know
it doing some things
congratulations you passed everything
yep attrition in we had the hearing
people all the sights the legs the
muscles he passed it all the pastor
