gonna find a Joe feat oh my god I got
t-shirts cuz I haven't sure to lose
broth to bring to the wedding but I just
wasn't feeling it because all the other
stuff is new and it was kind of like an
older shirt himself and since you've
been here like cotton and then is the
way for it as we see here so I decided
to splurge at and we got to like really
super nice cotton and then cotton cotton
shirts like woody stiff Hunter so I'm
gonna get one of them for the wedding
nice
I didn't like scars knees and I'm also
gonna get a pair of shoes and I'm gonna
find me a pair of pink shoes these are
the hammer watermelon
the ten fruit shake juice Andrews so it
is super healthy super good
what are you get I think I'll just get
the teeth would take away fruit salad
okay all right let's do it
I get the 10 fruit juice and it take
away free time
trying to find the shoe itself pointing
right these are forty fours
these are forty fours they don't fit
they fit but they're in the wrong color
no is there any other color let's see
just that yeah we think there's no I
didn't actually have it in my size I
look the levitating lady Anna doesn't
believe me so you underneath that thing
there there's a plate Anna a metal plate
that says she's staying upwards because
she's got a a pole stuck into a metal
plate on the ground
trust me go over rip go over there and
put the rope rug up super cheese
he's not everything she's sitting on a
chair it has one meant like metal pole
that's anchored to the ground you get it
okay it's magic that's what it's magic
she's levitating okay okay it's so
annoying I didn't want them in turquoise
the one they had were turquoise so we'll
go to another place and see if we can
find them
so funny isn't it that in one place one
size doesn't fit on one size does fit
this place just keeps going back and
back the cuties are that's so cute
present bravia Tina get them a dog with
chocolate lemon channel suffice stuff is
hard heavy
oh we should want to get a champagne
bucket you know we're always drinking
champagne absolutely cool sit good down
I think that I think I might sell
sandals on here I'm not 100% sure I know
it's so crazy he decided to come back
here because I definitely think this one
here is the best food in Toronto
definitely got different seats yet they
can see some sound but look at 11
the size of some of those things are
there like it was so big if you can put
in a one luck with those things they're
a new message brother says oh you can't
say that these plea don't please Tom
picked in Hammonds it's definitely a
good spot to become one Sorento in the
checkout line
look result to see a wedding behind this
over there - we set last time it's taken
is it just that's how pussy can just
come in the rest
he's just sittin over there to run the
restaurant I was getting any meat I
would give it
yeah we're not getting there you know oh
so cute it's so nice
join all of them just to hang them like
that so that's that would be my take my
review of Sorento food-wise go to the
buffalo Buffalo buffalo Joe best food in
the whole town second to that would be
we're surrounded garden Carrie Cano
garden and go and sit in the Magic
Garden because now there was a cat under
our table flowers and leaves and plants
and stuff were fallen from the roof
I was feasted on by ants and flies and
spiders but if you can put all that
aside and you don't mind eating in a
garden it's really really nice
food is super good isn't it go back to
the same shoe shop man you're on look at
these ones they're like they're like
Tom's accept our call almost there just
like go toms and I actually wanted a
pair of Tom's but you can invite them
not so comfortable yeah yeah they're
nice too and she's tell people I don't
really like that you know the whole when
you put them on like you really feel
them
oh yeah and they've got actual you love
them have this thing give this is our
last night here in Sorento we're like
well we go oh yeah by the way I bought
two pairs of shoes mmm
PS I just bought your shoes I'll tighten
up on fortune on but they come in pairs
so I got I got I got one free each on a
ball when I wouldn't get one free shoes
we were like oh we just had my cows oh
no no no no no cuz the minute we get
home it's like that's it that's yeah
grando so it's like no no I just never
go home let's just stay out all night
long
what about the bright pink one I have
not already yeah we're totally doing at
a haul video it's two rental home video
and stuff over your back yeah yeah
I love how many dogs right just like
Roman or end he's kind of good
you can do it hi finishing up is wrong
go kill they both well obviously hit the
big fellow SB yeah Muslims are better oh
yeah that's crazy for thinking about it
doing it
like a pawn off those tech guns
for sure
this is what I was talking about I don't
think I actually put on shoes for a good
while I don't put in these little things
you know you think that much cuter
because see are never gonna touch the
ground for cancer is it soft yeah it's
so cute this is the stroller we're
getting nice is it everything in there
is like a million girls who's kind of
fun to luck though what if it's like
media you'd have to do a lot of chores
earn that kind of pocket money I think
I've only actually got gelato once right
since you've been here yeah one time so
I think the last thing you should do
before I go inside is to get myself a
little cup of gelato that's nice oh
honey that's all how could you know or a
pastry bar thing would be nice some
pastries if you guys think in some
comments I'll wait here till the video
goes up tomorrow and then I'll go and do
that
but I mean can you actually have all the
names no media oh okay here's the cool
idea that's the same law do you guys
reckon we've walked past these every day
since we arrived and we've said we
should get out for real yeah and
considering its elastic I think we
should do it and I think we're all drawn
but a little
ballerina girl do I that one we're
trying force Amelia to I want that as
our first toy that's her favorite toy
I thought I should probably cool those I
don't think it works that way
you guys right the best one here what's
the best one yeah
all of it
Genda
that's not helpful
like
I might get like a few different ones in
a cup and then that gets to bottle to
water you get the water I get a
chocolate ice cream yeah oh yeah by the
way this is the place we're staying guys
a shade of frontier look my dry house

got a son trapped there it's really
really nice I definitely recommend it my
dry house definitely recommended oh we
