Madrid of me I would like this blue one
but I must admit I really like this blue
one you know I gotta go I left a lot of
my stuff in Casper dream yesterday we
first arrived and then Gosper lost his
room key and then I could get her back
and then last night like I don't know
two or three o'clock in the morning or
something that he was a man so back and
I was like oh just like so I gotta go

see ya see if I can get my stuff back my
key is it really nice hotel by the way
guys no idea what is called me or
something that it's in middle of Madrid
somewhere
I'm very informative
all right I think this is a way it's a
bit of a maze situation we're here hobby
crafts look at this action virus to show
you look at my park nice okay actually
it's not as bad as I really thought but
it's quite bad but I need lots of space
you've got like the double bogey and
then we've got two kids in crises and
it's just really difficult so um yeah
that's my part
alright let's go to copyleft and
possibly next alright we are leaving
Madrid leaving the hotel the big
coca-cola truck we're taking all the way
home so coldly the whole time right here
I really expected to be a lot warmer it
will turn out to be super cold
you like that one yeah
what about Eduardo I'm gonna pick one
for Eduardo - oh that's cute oh that
one's broken
okay let me pick another one of these
actually I think this is the only one I
would wire like snot okay
you sure you don't want like the purple
one I thought you would have gone to the
purple one
hey don't make a mess don't recommend no
no don't put it in there so that's what
you got and that's where it'll go for
Easter yeah they are nice okay let's get
some more things this is so look at this
so we're gonna get some play-doh do you
guys remember click well obviously
everybody work this table but I remember
loving tomatoes so much I'm so excited I
can't believe she's at the age where she
can look she's got a sword got married
oh oh yes it smell a plate I was like
when I opened when I cracked my first
pot I'm just gonna be like Anton I
actually loved passing too but I just
think I think play-doh it might be more
age-appropriate for her for some reason
mm-hmm let me see
look at Portugal seriously look at his
face
he's just so like
so exciting update Casper's found the
lost and found they may actually find
his phone could you imagine if you
actually find this phone iPhone the plot
thickens didn't happen there this would
be amazing when you find it
do you guys know what's the titleist
video did we find it
all right so Casper is going to try and
actually go through the security place
here the trying figure act and we got
true so let's see if this works not the
first one
he just said wait till somebody comes
out and then go true alright we managed
to get through security now a lost and
found I think arias from London to here
Iberia yeah do you have it
we're getting closer I'm glad it's not
my phone though it's more fun cuz it's
your phone yeah of England London to
Madrid at what time
hey we've just arrived it cover two
rifles oh I know it
that girl thought we were looking for a
telephone okay come on over there really
what there's a telephone that's right
yes all right we found another Iberia
place we're gonna try it we're never
giving up
never forget okay that didn't go
anywhere either yeah I feel sick I feel
like the conclusion is the phone is not
in Madrid we have checked everywhere in
Madrid we all one lesson to be learnt
are lights if you're going to lose your
phone do not put on airplane mode you
know we could fund it we could find it
if it was not an airplane yes what are
they supposed to do that is actually the
airplanes fault but it should have some
bypass airplane mode thing that you can
activate Roxy maybe you can maybe you
can thank Steve but maybe there is a way
where you can flip that on you found it
