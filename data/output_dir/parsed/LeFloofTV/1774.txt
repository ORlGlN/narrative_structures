like a little I don't know beaten up
baby or something look at you
what an absolutely the best morning ever
I'm wearing a t-shirt outside seriously
I am wearing a t-shirt I was like
getting up on stage and I was like oh my
goodness I'm wearing like my gym shorts
and my gym my t-shirt and stuff on the
way to the chick that's never happened
normally I wear like a duffle coat and
17 layers and I have like my ski pants
on and my apres ski boots
am I like six layers of starves and
everything and you're just like get into
the gym and where it's nice and warm but
seriously I'm actually wearing a t-shirt
and shorts to the gym amazing amazing
I'm so happy I'm hoping like this the
rest of the year
I'm made for this kind of weather I made
I was always designed there like when
I'm designing a jofi they're like what
can we temperature should we make this
this jovi adaptable to you like tropical
tropical temperatures sounds good when I
came later if the Sun isn't here I'm
very very disappointed look the at my
little special car park was closed at
the park over there good girl good girl
if eaten you feeding yourself it's
definitely like a slower process than I
thought like I don't know I think it's
because Amenia is so she was always so
interested in our food and what we were
eating and stuff like that that I
thought for sure that she would be more
into eating or something I don't know
weaning in here in Ireland and I think
it's the same in the UK it means
something different than in America so
in America it means like weaning means
like stopping basically stopping like
Daboo or like nursing and actually
weaning them off off the boob but here
in Ireland and I think the UK they
say we makes meaning like feeding your
baby solids it's kind of confusing but
so I haven't stopped feeding her at all
I'd say like we probably actually feed
the same we probably she doesn't feed it
as much on the boob but because she gets
a little bit more from like the solids
that she's eating and I have noticed
that I've become a little bit enquiries
which is kind of like not very pleasant
but it's okay but she's still feeling
like I've I probably like four times a
day you always make a huge mess you do
oh this is a little bit chunky
a little bit chunkier them it should be
both we you go when you do it yourself
