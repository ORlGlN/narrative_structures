Eduardo there is no tragedy for me
Eduardo life goes on
so you know sometimes you gotta like put
on a brave face and just go back to the
routine and cause like they need a
normal life
they can't mope around and feel sorry
for themselves you know it's a good and
a bad thing mixture yeah I'm not sure
it's a Francesca came in this morning
to help us out so I'm not on my own with
the kids because I got loves to work

everything bad you apologize aside time
of noses and you bet up in the luminol
still in the truth I don't know
I saw the town going now we're just
coloring it in bright pink so be nice I
really would appreciate it if we had got
as far as actual finding as agender I
think I would have made it somewhat you
know gender specific it looked really
sore but yeah like why don't that was
quick yeah yeah isn't it cuz is that
like you tried to make it happy yeah
because the first thing wouldn't look
happy and I was like no no no they can
look happy
alright see you're here whatever so
that's really nice mmm cute you look
better when it fades down low you know
in a way exited loads are like in detail
shading yourself you know that's not red
that's just like blood and stuff yeah
you know even though you are in your
pajamas wearing a dress and flip-flops
okay but that's okay you are oh that's
okay we live in a free and equal world
but we are locked into the headstone
okay we live in a free and equal world
who you may express yourself however you
see fit
Oh because it's brand-new it's sore at
the start when it's brand-new
but you think it's cool it's a little
squid and other ones are not right no
the other ones aren't store now because
they're older like but the new one is
kind of Thor so you don't put it would
you like it yeah but why God was gone

later on so it's a couple hours later we
decided to have you know outside today

Oreo is a 26 but an Oreo like Oh or home
Oh : or cookie or there's a way a cookie
don't send with like an Ice Cream
Sandwich if you go what do you think
guys come on everybody I came from that
the or Cece a dog-walking team um like
an hour ago
I guess the original plan when I
realized wasn't gonna get dark with
supportive kids to bed or I feel like I
want him to be involved in this but and
have this memory whenever we're looking
back at this video and years to come
Amelia has fallen off her chair so we
have the lanterns here and we're going
to all of us are going to write our
names on the land trend yeah and then
you can write a little something to me
once and then we've got four one for all
of us and then we've got one for squid
this is squid special one what you don't
get a screen special one but you can
write a little special note to little
squid yeah you can write a little note
and then we're going to send it up into
the sky
you
I forever
that's fine
ah
my tattoo
Oh
Oh time
and you're
obviously it's not as darkness or what I
liked it for this but I feel it's better
because I can involve the little squids
involved in this okay so I think as far
as you know we got a light thing we got
to hold them and then we gotta let them
fill up okay Amelia and then you can let
it go
