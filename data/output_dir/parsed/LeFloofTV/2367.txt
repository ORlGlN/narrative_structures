quite a lot of doggies on my chair here
and I must admit you're one of the best
I have to say I definitely find that
actually if you talk away - yeah - Albie
or any dog while they're cutting them it
definitely relaxes them a lot more and
if you were to sit here and not talk
while you're dinner like you were just
being silent only they liked it as much
because they got kind of nervous I think
so you got a little Matthews here and
white shake is always just to rob the
maxi's like that yeah
