pregnant together and everything but her
little girl is sick so she can't come

wanted them to play together last time

like I don't know maybe amelia was like
ten months or something like that or
maybe she's a bit older I can't really

toddlers like this it's just so much
more fun for them to play she was one of
my bridesmaids in my wedding as well she
was the only other bridesmaid
