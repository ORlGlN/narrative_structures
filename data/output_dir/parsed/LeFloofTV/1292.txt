don't know is it a kind of a wearing
clothes in today even though it's rain
storm and thunder storm outside serosa
yeah it's really hard weird day we're
just having to this question while
cooking about vlogging right and we kind
of figured out what Anna does right it's
like who described to me somewhat I have
to comment and said it so they were like
Johnson vlogs his life like John
actually Jenny like daily gossip blogs
his daily life whereas Anna lives your
life and then gives updates like a word
away looks like that's so true cuz like
people are always like oh you don't hang
it with Amenia as much or you don't have
as good a relationship like that because
you just don't see it like actually
there's so much time yet so many times
yesterday when I was like playing with
media or doing stuff with her is gonna
be a bit I was and my head I was like
this is one of those moments where
Jonathan would totally a lot of bits but
I'm like too distracted in the moment in
a little
I'm so far away bruised a like and I've
got like just lot her for the gesture
days because nothing happened if
something happened don't would be no
blood for this mana
yeah you know that's the thing like it's
like when something happens I'll get it
yes I'm so bad at what people set up
women are better at lunch as me I don't
agree I think it depends on the person
because Jonathan can like cook talk to
people like have a conversation like
change not be like do all these things I
can't like I will freak out if I ask you
more than one thing like if I'm cooking
in the kitchen
I don't want anybody to talk to me I'm
Way too stressed out about getting that
right you know like I can't do that I
know a lot of them can be like that it's
kind of funny because I do see Google
comment stick I'll put more violence
footage in there is no more violence
footage what you usually see is the
scrapings of what I can draw out her for
a come on
you know like intentionally not putting
in my yeah yeah and he's like oh my god
