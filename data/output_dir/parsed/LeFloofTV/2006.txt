yum yum only to that pineapple mm-hmm
under the sea under the sea where is it
there's my amazing device I can I guess
what the ball that I play tons of it all
over but yeah but it was like three
o'clock in the morning so I just kind of
set that monster puppies excited to dice
up a few bad we got to a people we have

yep or the tubs are underneath you
yeah the whole thing yeah so now we
disturbed
Frank was supposed to be delivered my
pirate just going cold I was told that
breakfast included mm-hmm I reach my
sorry butt up man this good though cuz I
love pineapple just like during the day
like as a snack or something but I never
know how to cut it so dope is always has
to cut it and put it in a little choke
for me though I still probably wouldn't
know how to combat those it's good price
I know I just I know you talked to the
Apple devices I just I don't do very
well with it was great miss have you
seen er E I don't do very well with like
contraptions you know I just can't I
heard I don't know this is a contraction
it's a it's definitely not heavy
machinery but I think it is a
contraption that drips everywhere yeah
this is better
smaller meanie yeah probably a more
important issue
okay I'll get you your tub yeah cup cups
cups these are all right you might want
to move I'm trying to get in there
excuse me go for the puppies I don't
know Oh then a few times and then do a
fluffy goop's oh we got peaches as well
but they're totally hard like they're
not ripe yet okay yum yum yum yum yum
is that tasty is that tasty
is it tasty a bear hey coffee coffee for
one yeah one have you using this one
lately I'm just finding that the
capacity in that you know I don't get
you a full breakfast video i watch these
guys um it's called you always win
a man across from the fisherman the
concern is that watching like months ago
they am Butler and challenging started
months ago they were in this thing it's
a Minecraft video game thing they
usually wrap 20 or 30 minutes long so I
like that's my breakfast day you're
gonna make a house he's Cena up up up up
up up up huh yeah my nose my nose good
dogs
come on let's go
yes my mouse
jokes so we're going to get some stuff
for the hospital bag because apparently
you're supposed to kind of do the whole
everybody like back and fairies because
apparently you're supposed to do it at
32 weeks and my OB like our doctor said
to do it at 34 weeks which would be what
I am now and then some people like don't
do it for ages but i am i keep getting
scared that like it's gonna happen like
my waters gonna break or something and
then i won't be prepared at all
she's probably gonna be late but keep
saying that but that's not that's not
like we're only saying that though
because we asked the OB and he was like
chances are you running away he's like
well no yeah it's different my fault
obviously be prepared because then when
i said that he said that like tons of
people were like how does he know like
he can't know with his load o your
cervix isn't even like use like a
professor of ultimate object asians and
he has a machine that can see your
insides
you know oh no but they were saying like
he can't have checked yet obviously he
didn't check yet he's just going off
like this was dad like estimation like
he was like okay well most first babies
are late but he didn't say always he was
just like yeah it's really a good idea
like through an exception tigereye so
we're gonna pack my and we need stuff
for me we need stuff for Amelia and we
need a couple of things for you but our
opener you will probably just bring all
those things that because they're like
camera and camera charger I'm like yeah
Jonathan always has velcro sound mics
tripods yeah so we're going to man point
right over there and we I think we
missed the market which is so I really
wanted in his pies I'm gonna pie last
year guys last month yes he's here well
I know what I'm making for dinner
tonight that's all sorted but I kind of
wanted to get like the group where to
get a bite Greek what do to get a bite
I do I get me here's the bones on but if
you don't mind I was just saying hey I'm
forget about we don't have you know
video of a girl dinner her what's in her
hospital up ai-jen marine and oh my god
hurt by she got it free she got it free
with that like oh what not one more test
okay where do you like the moment but I
think you have to have points or
something no this was a really cute bag
it's really really cute and I was like
bring a stupid old bag cuz Amelia's bag
is gonna be the the yeah okay yeah
that's gonna be really pleased like an
overnight suitcase like you're going
away free weekend yeah I don't really
want to pretty much is like a tree day
the tree day getaway
yeah it is did you get a get at the end
well that's why you have to like be so
organized but y'all won't be there
because we have six dogs I'm gonna have
to go home every night yeah and take
care of the dog no but this stuff for
God is like you know if the labor takes
like a really long time and then won't
don't you wanna might be there we can go
to the market record the tree because I
wanted to get the
thing but
can we get that now I'll go shopping
well if it's open okay he's plain if
it's open we're gonna go straight home
I'm gonna have lunch I'm gonna eat my
units pies you can have your pitter
pitter and then we're gonna print out
there the listing that we were looking
online and then we'll come back later
okay if it's not open we'll go do that
stuff now okay let's plan cricket oh
come on come on
two pies two chicken and mushroom pie is
all I want that's all right when you
want it's what I really wouldn't what no
you know you don't like taking pies
you're getting your thingy
the kebab thing with the yogurt and the
chili i he's diner he's always there
from the end last time he was like
finishing up with you yeah but so made
you one
yeah but that was only because I think
Oona only has a limited amount of pies
well if there's one enough he always put
his over on his hair yeah exactly if
just one a not theater one where that
would obviously go oh it's starting to
rain I can't see her I can't see her
shop no it was it was not RunAs pies
your thing was there yeah I don't like
what
yeah
I know I was like um it's so annoying
because if it was just the pies I'd
probably be selfish you just have the
bias well we'll never know so we got a
list of items to buy I have no idea what
we buy all I saw was baby that's all I
need
one baby please oh nice parking spot
oh yeah what in the name what like boobs
and bottle boobs or something hmm okay
anything here get to be mad just give
the award a quick clean wait wait I know
I know I know
jokes yup we go oh man look let's bend
bring that cookie back okay do you know
the new you look at this newborn starter
kit for 211 pounds 27 for 211 pounders
again cotton soft sheets white packs
should we get a starter pick no it's
probably stupid but just because it
looks kind of cool oh it does the same
thing
I thought pampers made Huggies yeah okay
hey but you know the one box that we did
find one little this thing here that we
have at home is that not enough for the
hospital it's not enough you know there
one banker who needs more than that
openness I don't know what sighs I don't
know she didn't be small figures I say
we probably need to factor in a couple
of a a couple of ones that don't work
out so well well you know when you're
changing nappy and you miss a couple and
I'm often a Detroiter
have you I've actually never change
nappy ever in my life okay okay I don't
care
oh not an issue for me at all all the
nobbies when you get three to six pounds
are six to thirteen okay 62 okay
what six pounds no no sorry it's to 6 kg
we block this therefore timely I
wondered Oh like you know this stuff
should we buy this stuff like Casco
maybe the cheaper yeah you can get my
that's it that's why I mean like some of
you should just get your said you know
okay okay
maternity pods I don't know what they're
for and I think it's probably best if I
don't know what they're for
what was the cute max it's like
TV does yep
oh my god are so much stuff
I've absolutely no idea what any of you
stuffers or what I'm even looking
I'll just I'll just hold the paper I
think I can hold the paper
I just think find the big ones is it a
lot easier you know because it's just
like 539 484 79 for 40 so like you're
making a saving of almost 5 euros by
buying the double one you know it makes
more sense anything else
chicken or red storage bags from milk or
something okay check in the list
we both please yeah I have
just yeah just get new stuff anyway
because it could be in there for like
three weeks
yeah yeah okay you wanted to state that
for the record
I was right I was right I took a guess
that is so cute it's a small it's like
it's like toy children you know like a
play shop 1 3 4 cubic so what do you
want
