hello friends good morning Emilia Emilia
is a he's been on the iPad floor but
this is this is what this is what we
call post iPad blues isn't it they go on
the iPad for like I don't know 20 or 30
minutes and then their minds turn to
mush and then you get this you get this
sort of an effect don't you no no no
come on Cali
Jerry wall that's right night Terry the
tingle shop you know man to tickle your
way stop you don't see cuz Dad I do
carpool I'll get them Diggle daddy
Oh Terry Terry Doh Torito Oh what are
you guys doing in here
Eduardo just told me I'm we're brother
Oh careful
good good brother and daddy all right go
to sleep guys hey stop messing up the
home messing up this hmm guess who's
coming who's coming today
no oh my aunt oh yes
ah thank you ah couldn't find my studies
this morning so I'm wearing old Chloe
ones which are not like I do really like
them I don't know where any regulars
okay that's random scarf a bit weird and
this bit of the walk is really creepy at
night time irax you don't really like
going down this path at nighttime so I
tend to avoid it but in the daytime if
it's really hot it's nice and cool
because otherwise you get a lot of Sun
when you do this walk anyways so now in
my walk I've got my Fitbit on and I
signed up for this um app called earth
miles so freaking cool guys so you can
earn rewards by the steps that you take
you get credit to buy things or like to
get gift cards or like vouchers and
stuff it is so good let me show you guys
okay so here it is on my phone so I have
it in health and then you go in there
and here we go earth miles so this is me
and you can link your account with any
of these apps there's worse it back on
oh I'm linked with Fitbit okay so I
currently have 219 earth miles then if
you go to rewards it shows you like all
the different things under nutrition
fitness and gear and bonus all of the
ventures and all of the like free stuff
that you can get and then this is how
many earth miles you need to get them
for example if I wanted to buy let's see
this one right here rude health so this
is 25% off online and free delivery so
that's pretty cool if I want to buy that
I just click into it and it says redeem
for 200 earth miles so I could buy that
right now so there's lots and lots of
different things on here and you know
you can save a lot of money with it you
can get fit with it and it's just a cool
way of being rewarded for moving your
body I think and it's free what I really
like about the app is that it's not like
one of those super like
fitness apps that has like lots of
pictures of like really fit people and
like that can sometimes be a little bit
for me anyway it can be a little bit
like demotivating because you think
everybody's better than you it's not
like it's a very like safe nice friendly
environment so it's not like super fit
or anything like that it's just like
kind of for everybody like anyone can do
it no matter why your fitness level and
you don't need to have a Fitbit or
anything you can just use the health app
on your phone if you don't have one that
tracks your step so long as you take
your phone with you on a walk or like
whatever exercise you're doing or like
just about your day it will track your
step and that's how you earn rewards so
it's really cool it's absolutely free
it's available on US and UK iOS or
Android phones or devices and yeah it's
just a really cool app
I will move up I one more walk a womano
up or one more
a woman bow-wow a one mo I to day today
soon my snapchat a few days ago I
figured out this new way you can go like
a million miles an hour you need to put
loads of balls down like this right haha
oh my goodness I'm so dizzy what are we
at the seaside guys you got a knife
lying these paws then you just gotta
like flip your body like you're doing a
windmill and you break down since
identity windmills you space you flip
yourself like you're in a windmill whoa
I'm working in this big project which I
didn't want to talk about it because
it's one of these ones that I'm like I
can't tell you anything about it but I
feel like a laborer I've been doing it
for the last like two weeks like me
being like hardcore doing it and I feel
like I don't want to talk about it
that's why I like you may have noticed
the editing slightly changed a bit in
the vlogs and like I haven't put a lot
of music in ad because I just I just
don't have as much time right now so I'm
like I'm just plopping it together as
best as I can
