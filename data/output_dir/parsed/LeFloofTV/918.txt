basically I ordered a tassel Garland and
it came from America it arrived here but
it arrived when we were out or something
so we got one of those like little note
card things that says like oh sorry we
missed you and I like typed in the
number or whatever had to do I think I
might have had to pay of customs charge
as well or maybe that was for something
else to count member but anyway I paid
it ordered for it to be redeliver it on
Monday the 7th because and this was like
almost a month ago because I knew we
were going to Italy
and it was like it wasn't almost months
ago that's an exaggeration it was like
two weeks ago so it was before we went
to Italy so that was happening
and I knew we were gonna be like not
here for a long time so I rescheduled
the delivery
anyway the seventh came and no package
and I got like two emails from the girls
that made the tassel guard I'm being
like hey we've just received news that
your tassel garland is gonna be sent
back because it's that Royal Mail you
haven't collected it yet and I was like
what so it got sent back obviously
because like I didn't get it
so I don't even know what happened I
tried looking for like the card I must
have thrown it out and I tried looking
for my email I can't seem to find the
email that confirms my redelivery time
but I could find one that says like that
I paid for something so I don't even
know what happened but basically I can't
get it at garland anymore it's sent back
