of us taking that new house is that we
needed to make sure that when we get it
and the people who had it were just a
little like a king or building a house
or something so they're having delays I
mean I could go on and on and on so
we're like I'll hopefully you know if we
can get the the contracts everything
signed up that it was specify a date Wow
which is
like right now by design and sailfin and
they need they might need to push it
back which could crumble the whole thing
and we might not have a house in London
at all which would be a shame
so our agent guy Dorothy tomato panicky
at a place like them 20 pairs they're
looking at our options today and
hopefully would have like resolution for
you guys tomorrow so I don't know what I
should tell her or not I don't know we

don't want her freaking out and get
really annoyed and upset about it but
I'm like oh my goodness like you know
right up until a week or two ago we
probably could have maybe push that back
but now it's like everything set up like
yeah you know the fairies the moving
company like everything is in order for
us to leave now oh my goodness

bye
so Jonathan and Amelia are at type
singing and I decided to get dinner on
the go just because I thought it'd be
nice to them to come home to some dinner
because Johnson usually cooks but when
he takes her out now it's kind of closer
to our dinnertime because I mean as
routine this kind of shifted earlier
everyone's gonna check it earlier so I'm
making chicken korma and we're having it
with broccoli because you know everybody
else in the family says they don't like
broccoli it's good for you so I need to
cut that one smaller but um chicken
broccoli korma and then we have naan
bread as well it is really good so
excited with that I'm going to pop them
in the oven soon enough because it takes
6 minutes I feel like I want to do more
cooking and I don't know it just I think
it just started after being like a mom
of two kids now I'm like okay I need to
learn to cook because I don't want to be
one of those moms that like can't cook
you know like my mom always disabled
cooks is always an amazing cook and she
never gave us any everything was made
from scratch everything was like amazing
and she put hard time and effort into it
and like these meals that I'm doing her
not only cut by any means I love baking
I don't really like cooking but you have
to be able to cook for your family you
know sometimes so I just think that
before I had like a family I didn't when
you care at all and even just with the
media like she eats so little that it's
just like tiny voices but I don't know
did something like shift it and I'm just
like I'm need to learn to cook the
company I need for a media ad wild have
memories of you know my cooking I can't
have them growing off the one that
doesn't
Joe turn here throw it somewhere throw
it
ah Choo Choo you fall in the tail well
if you ever get a cop or a DUI you
should have experience in walking the
white line it's gettin away
dinner is served
Amelia thinks it's pizza
banana bread you like the nan bread nan
look you go like this dip dip dip I
don't mean me I'm just from the future

like you know what sometimes these
things are to work themselves out you
know if that house falls through and we
don't have to go there well then it was
never meant to be and the house that we
are going to get because this house here
we had lost all hope the house we try to
get before it fell true we'd given up we
are just ready to just

not gonna go back when back in the blood
so much

all like homeless living out of a van
for a week or two cuz it all went wrong

of working themselves out you know you
