this is really cool right so you know
the music that I use any videos well
that's all like commercial music so it's
not like chart music it's not like music
that your phone and apps that look for
music and I'm fine preceding comments
like all I can't find out music's on
yours because it's like commercial music
so it's kind of different but anyway one
of my favorite producers musicians is
Liz Reynolds and I've used herself like
loads of times because I think her voice
is really haunting and it's just it's
really powerful you know I noticed a
comedy today from Liz I mean that's so
cool
I found her to are your network and I
was like whoa she's really good
I am I got some summer her music and and
like bang she like watches my videos and
I was like that's so cool so Liz big fan
love yourself
who needs a playground when you've got a
daddy die and never let the judgmental
in the little sad and a little distant
then little ended oh no children were
hurt in the making of this video we've
gotta keep this we've gotta keep this
dream
we've gotta keep this dream Aaron at the
belfry I'm not 100% sure if it's not I'm
looking for is even in this building
this is funny this is the funniest
supermarket shopping center it was not a
lot of stuff in it
no just carpark level to you before the
upper floor
haha that there is the shop I'm looking
for this one there's a letter level guy
in the inside as well then I got our
luck antique shaft metal frame virtually
unbreakable so this is the virtually
unbreakable friends so the reason we got
the suitcases anywhere by the way is
that we're heading off somewhere
tomorrow I'm the suitcases that we had
every time we travel to get damaged
which really infuriates me
so this time I decided like look let's
invest in some like really good I cuz we
were always buying kind of like you know
kind of cheap ones cuz you bethink like
oh sure it's just suitcases but I've
learned after all the travel we did last
year that invest in a good suitcase I
always notice that other people's hard
cases one I think you gotta plus you
know sometimes like it was if it's
raining and you're sitting in the plane
and you're looking at the window and
you're watching your bike gets soaked in
the rain and then you come home and your
stuff is wet you're like so I was like I
want a waterproof one I wanted to cure
one that won't get dented I want it all
so hopefully that's what we have now cut
out a toy in there we get out for free
for free lights the only possibility I
found it - okay old bakery shop on Broad
Street

directions which would you like every
time I'm at somewhere and it's like what
