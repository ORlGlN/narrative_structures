knock-knock joke last night but we we
were too tired and we forgot to share it
with you guys we were gonna put it on
keek weren't we javis but we were too
tired but it was a really good one it
was such a good joke so she'll have to
share it with you tonight
where is she Bianca Navy sometimes I
call me Navy and she actually responded
that's like her arch enemy right they're
newbies she and newbies are like they're
always at each other it was so funny
they were like jumping up and down
because I was waving Amelia's headband
in front of them and newbies was on the
floor like licking her so and yank I was
jumping off with this and then Bianca
like backwards walked into newbies and
she just like totally attacked her it
was so funny it was like you know when
kids do that when they're like playing
and one of them bumps into the other
accidentally and the other is like why
did you do that that's exactly what it
was like I'm so cute
you on the other hand have a lot of mats
you guys need to be cut they're getting
cut on Wednesday movies on the bear in
there
what's going on what's that strange
sound from inside house schedule working
today not today not today we're taking
weekends off the schedule let's go let's
go I'm ready can I help you there buddy

oh my goodness am I tired today ladies
one of those tired you feeling tired so
right now my job at 7:00 it's like no
this is for life and she's so good she
likes knees for life mom
goodness did like six hundred miles asam
yesterday whatever round trip to Dublin
and the party and stuff I was even tired
before we even left corn meet you I was
ready for bed no tomato coffee I drank
yesterday you make six cups or something
crazy and I felt it that accurately
we were fubar so I brought a line I call
this one tortellini tortellini
it's like all your Collini
are totally nuts sorry
and then this is actually actually
Emilia loves this one it's the butterfly
I don't know why she likes this one so
much but she seriously her face always
lights up every time you see that one so
I brought those two along just because
she's getting more like into toys now
and I have a couple like I have her a
raffle when she's not really into yet
because she can't hold things like hold
onto things for too long so that's why
she doesn't really like that yet I know
she will get used to like when she
starts to like to grab a finger for a
while ya know what if not an object she
will get into that stage where she just
lost noise and that's when her rattles
have probably come in handy but for now
she likes looking at things and the
butterfly and the turtle are two of her
favorites
from her mat so it's good thing you can
actually detach them and just take them
with you yeah I've got a full house
today am I in my bag well it's having a
track today oh yeah we call it sweats
