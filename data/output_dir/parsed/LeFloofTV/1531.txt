been probably asleep since like say yeah
I was probably like one maybe a bit
before one for I actually got to sleep
and so I was exhausted I was not
expecting that at all and she was wide
awake like she when I came in
usually when I come in it's like I have
a sleep kind of job and I just try not
to make eye contact as well and I just
like hush her back to sleep and then you
know put her back down but she was like
looking up at me like hey mom ready to
start my day
so I read are two stories whispering
because I was trying to keep her in like
Snoopy zone for a sleepy time
and she was wide awake it was crazy so
then eventually I got her down but it
took a while because she kept crying
every time I would put her down and she
just wanted to she just couldn't
understand why she had to go back to bed
it was so weird and then of course you
wouldn't wake up then at 9:00 so I had
to wake her and half-past nine so her
