we must have doctors yeah yeah but I
remember getting something I remember
seeing a dream machine and I remember
them calling him yeah it's out of the
results or we didn't call him
yeah they had to call the room yeah we
kind of waited so yeah I think that's
their life it's just funny because we we
weren't able to vlog really anything
inside the main hospital area so we
never really showed an end of its on
it's not on video it didn't happen since
the rules about that's our life
basically our life unfortunately is Ani
60 minutes long every day you guys get
24 hours that we're gonna get 60 minutes
it's a tough life it's like sometimes
