hello this is do a foot hug do a for hug
thank you very much for the sandwich mmm
yummy yummy
she's educating me in war in your world
and I didn't understand so today I've
learnt about begging
what a bag is what a kushti Christie was
about chirps and you guys chirping I'm
down with that
so me and I used to be I needs to be my
bag but then eventually turned into a
chirps and then we got shipped is that
correct
 why I don't wanna say one tells and
I know that snapchat is crazy this stuff
so I'm reading here today lives but any
of you didn't know I don't wash my bag
you see well baked oh well I love the
bank Caroline that's Caroline's arm you
should know that's right I sometimes
don't know Karen do you say what no oh
yo it was to say you that you chase mo
damage I was the bait then we were
chirping horn we were chirps in for a
while and then where did you get
together cuz that doesn't mean you got
together that's me
no no just means we were just trypsin
what we're at the start and then we
decided yeah there yes was it yesterday
19 years ago days ago five years ago Wow
madness don't don't even bother asking
don't get me sorry I don't even know
about the chirping thing up I recently
learned about the shipping and the
shipping on the whole thing I think all
the stuff that exists but it just we
didn't have names for it like the whole
bag thing I did exist but no one had a
neighborhood say oh yeah yeah for
chirping it's a good idea
like non-committed relationships when
you're young not that's not a good idea
cuz you should just be doing school oh
yeah
obviously you should just be doing
school like like Carolyn's is there
