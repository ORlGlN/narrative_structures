budget you know of what what we can like
borrow and our sort of maximum threshold
or minimums the minimum tracks all to
zero we've narrowed it down to sort of
like I think like three prime locations
like we really wanted you to build idea
of what circumstances have recently sort
of changed for us so I don't know if
building right now is gonna be the way
forward for us but I think in the future
maybe building will be fun or maybe and
if they've couple of hours about five
options on the table right now and one
of them would be somewhere that we could
sort of develop and it may be like half
build or sort of a restore a sort of a
manor house and sort of build and
develop onto it you know and I'm hoping
it's all gonna happen in the next few
months I'm gonna slash in right if

awfully complicated process this is our
