of those Oh fine it whoa that's huge 300
Mouse is that how much that yeah pasta

of them we don't need organic chocolate
nice creamy sweeper my dad has like
Maryland's like that's cuz that's where
the chest guy used to work a neighbor

hi try not to get too jealous of my
beautiful tire okay this is my Wizard of
Oz apron that I wear so often so I'm
gonna make attempt to make a two course
meal for my family cuz they're coming
over it's kind of like our hexoren party
we need to do this for ages but we kept
getting sidetracked with everything that
was going on and it was already busy and
oh wow
so finally I'm cooking a meal just like
I said it's your horse meal I'm cooking
dinner and dessert I'm kind of skipping
the starter because I don't know how to
do that and who eats charters nowadays
anyway so this is what we're gonna do
I'm gonna start backwards so I'm going
to do the dessert first cuz it needs to
be chilled in the fridge for a while and
it is what time's it they're coming over
to at 6:00 or 7:00 oh it's my mom my
sisters by the way if you don't know oh
okay
it's five o'clock
and the room over like six or seven so
I'm gonna start on dessert and then I'm
probably gonna cook while they're here
as well which is fine I don't we house I
don't care about stuff like that they
can entertain themselves but we're gonna
attempt to make dessert right now we're
making white chocolate mousse with black
pepper and fresh mint okay this is what
it is it's not gonna look like that now
because I have to show you don't have
any champagne flutes and instead of
buttons or jars that I got iced up like
you know those smell gourmet dessert
things that you can get and I've got
some here too actually
yeah so that's what we're doing because
we don't really drink champagne so we
don't have any and my mom wasn't happy
reading the right side so that's we're
gonna do and you're gonna help me okay
okay so I'm melting chocolate white
chocolate that's whatever that's fine
and now I'm gonna start on I can find
the recipe I need like some kind of
divider we need to go back to the dinner
which is here the main course okay 150
grams what is 150 grams multiplied by
three I don't know
oops this is sticking that's kind of
dangerous this looks really good I love
white chocolate so much
all right I am going to hear again
right makes me feel like I made a
mistake so I added the cream with the
chocolate and then I just put in a
tablespoon of black pepper weird and now
I'm adding in six leaves of mint which
I'm gonna chop put it in there and fold
it all together we'll see how this turns
out and this is what they turned out
like clip mousse pot so I'm gonna keep
them in the fridge and then when I serve
them I'll serve them with a little bit
of that so so far so good and I got six
of them so there's five of us but
somebody might have extra if they like
it sorry Matt I got kind of busy but as
you can see whoopsies I effect started
on the dinner pasta ready to go bechamel
sauce poking in your microwave of course
and dessert
they look cute don't they yeah okay so
we go
oh my mom should be arriving any minute
now so yeah things are going well so far
and I haven't managed to find any house
or anything so that's great yes in the
oven
