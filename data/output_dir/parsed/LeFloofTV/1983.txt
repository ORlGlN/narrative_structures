well of it is who do you think it is huh
we are getting new phones today and I
don't know why but this for some reason
buying a phone waits me
were you nervous I have no idea wife I
have had my old phone like the home that
I have right now which is an iPhone 3GS
I've had it for three years three years
we bought it when we were living in
London
Jonathan has since updated his phone
what I did I stuck with my coz I've just
I know I'm just like I just like it's a
big commitment why it's actually buying
like a smart you know yeah so it's like
a big step for me today I'm actually
finding a new phone and I don't know
what we're gonna get we kind of we did
so much research while jovis didn't tons
of research and I just started
researching it kind of last night and
I'm not a techy person at all like I
don't know anything about your standing
in Utah you're like TechCrunch giving
the other actually read like their
reviews of this phone and I was like
trying to do like comparisons and stuff
it was weird because I only ever do that
for like makeup and stuff you know like
watch makeup reviews on YouTube instead
I was watching a phone review we're just
in between like the HTC One X and the
Samsung Galaxy
and three they're so similar though they
get the same rating on that that tech
bride should punch whatever um website
and yeah they both get a 4.5 out of 5 so
I don't know job holidays you see for 18
months yeah I feel like I like the look
of the galaxy 1 even though they say
that it feels a little bit cheaper plus
um yeah more plasticky um it's actually
not cheaper it's actually more expensive
yeah
but for some reason whatever the feel of
it is a little bit cheaper it's also it
feels lighter even though it's 3 grams
heavier than the other one who knows
their stats and then what was the other
thing
yeah I just like the because it's kind
of rounded and stuff and I loved when
she was doing on the video she was like
touching it and it was making like a
water sandwich like I fall for all that
kind of stupid gimmicky stuff but
whatever so leave comment it'll be too
late
but do leave comments if you have either
of those phones and let us know why you
like or dislike them because I think
that would be kind of helpful although
it will be too late well I mean you
never know yeah I know today one white
one yes she's a lobster a lopsided
Lobster
I think you can see that she's leaning
there more yeah
explain why she does that sort of leans
on one side the galaxy song species is
in black he's not making it as a
painting as I just made our decision
because even if the weight yeah quite
all right you
yeah a mistreat someone artists alright
is heavier feels different are well it
is my older okay somebody's actually go
to a meteor storm which is not here but
after holding both devices in my hand I
do like the Samsung yeah I like the way
and I like the chrome around the edges
and the way it finishes with desi see
like the white one is white right until
the screen it's black then it's black on
the inside is the Porsche beyond it's
our next car so we were just talking
about how many kids
top like we don't know obviously right
now if we weren't even talking about
ourselves we were just talking about it
like in general how many kids should you
have anything because we both know that
we want to have more than one like
that's a given like we don't want to
just have one I don't before you go for
five yeah I come from like three really
but then why can't like my older
brothers
all right my mom's but you know what I
mean so it's nice to know because it's
like your friends kind of come and go
and like you know you might be friends
and people and then you're not friends
of them or whatever it's like a flake
you think but your family is like always
going to be there so you have to think
about like when you're making baby it's
like when you're having kids but you're
making friends for life like you're
making lifelong friends hopefully we'll
give it a while and hate each other but
usually even if they hate each other
when they're small they love each other
when they're older you know I think like
oh yeah you always have your brother or
your sister and like it just doesn't go
away like so I always think even and I
always thought like two is a nice number
you don't - it's kind of neat and tidy
like - Waker all our girl boy or
whatever the parents yeah what four
seats the kids yeah cuz then I'm like or
even three like three or four I'm not
just saying like just before but like
what if something happens
yeah I know it's a horrible thing to say
but I'm talking about like later down
the line like what they're older like
what if something happens to one of them
and then they're on their own where is
it have more games I don't know it's
which it did negative way of looking at
it but I was just I know I have
experience with that kind of thing and
let me get big scene yeah more like if
we were had four kids that means that
we're gonna we're gonna be making babies
the next five years
essentially it takes about five years to
pay for kids I ever say because I was
saying that my once I had I called my
grandmother in my OMA this morning and I
actually had a really nice conversation
with her I don't tell her
but she had sent the gifts that were on
I think that was done she identity yeah
all the bath stuff because she wanted to
do she was like I would have be
interactive on some stuff that was her
gift and she send a lot of stuff and I
was I just called her to say thank you
and I was like oh I feel so big and so
heavy right now you know it's like so
the bump is like huge she was like don't
say that if she was pregnant with twins
at one time and she was like just think
of me when I was pregnant with twins she
said that she used to lean against a
tree but sounds horrible though he
should have you tell the whole story she
had four kids so she had twins five
years after my mom and my mom's brother
my uncle and she had them less than a
year apart they were Irish twins and
there were like 10 months for something
so but I always thought that was kinda
nice but it's just hard that she was
pregnant but then she had toddler well
she had like a for say a four and a five
year old or a three and a four year old
she said she was leaning against a tree
be so heavy and like being with like
full of doors or they were like the
baby's in the same sack kind of it don't
it no separate pregnancies I don't
I don't think it even matters I think
it's just like having more than one and
there's probably I just can't even
imagine it I have so much respect for
everybody who's everybody Twitter it's
our chocolate so she's a she's a lien
against a tree me like wait never wait
for obviously is like a four and a five
year old or whatever and they're like
running off that's in so stressful like
I feel like I would be so stressed out
but then we have six dogs so the
kamancheh you're like yeah baby right
and I move a second baby then we're like
all we have a turd baby get the turd
baby just happens to be like tripping
that's a loop and oh yeah like she
planned it but then it's it's really
nice because like there's so many of
them and it was two and two so it was
like two really close together and then
two you know twin so oh I think that's
nice but it's a lot of work
I can't imagine well for me it was like
myself my brother and cuz it was like
girl boy boy girl so my mom had them you
know but then the boys bonded and the
girls bonded but then I grew up with
girls so I was never like I was never a
weird all the girls like girls or
whatever like I lived with girls like I
knew I knew what went on with girls you
know and then I knew when our boy so I
think it's really good
grounded yeah I think we'll having with
me as I was used to like girly things
glad to see two younger sisters whatever
but at the same time I had my two older
brothers but they were much older so I
always wanted to hang out with older
people like I never I wasn't like you
know I mean like I owe all my friends
were always at least a year older than
me which when you're small is kind of
you know but it's also when they get you
know to get to school yeah like I think
like my little sisters three years I'm
gonna meet so I pretty much dated like
all of her friends because they were all
the right age for me and then she would
like all her friends would like my older
friends because
you know I mean so it's like yeah I
brought the girls I brought the boys it
was like had a good we good partnership
deal there you know and that's really
important I think is well yeah and you
probably wouldn't have had that if it
was just - yeah because roots like four
years older than you know you have to
you need it to be younger like our kids
are how many kids we have they're all
probably watching this block and be like
they're so imposing so we're back to
Tesco but a different Tesco waited on
Mon well this is a 24-hour Tesco the
best one is that but it's too far away
from where we actually live so it's like
way too far to drive but it's kind of
cool 24-hour fish go it looks kind of it
looks the same except for the top holy
 it's about the same size it's not
like you know this you really want to
stay with them if you get what it is
are you having sex I like the feel of
them I know no they're not it's big like
