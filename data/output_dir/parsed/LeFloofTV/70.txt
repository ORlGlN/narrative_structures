so far today's the day they're having
breakfast with the gorillas I don't know
if you guys remember this 2016 something
really really scary happened
a girl called Christina was at a
meet-and-greet
this guy came up to her and hugged her
and met her like we do to hundreds of
thousands people all around the world
all the time every year and then he shot
her and killed her I think about a month
later VidCon was happening and all the
creators everybody freaked out what does
this mean like in this that we never
taught this is something that could
happen we didn't wanted to go to VidCon
because we wanted to meet all of our
American viewers but we made the
decision not to bring the children which
is really hard because Los Angeles is
very very far away you know Eric he came
here she's gonna stay with the kids we
were just gonna fly in that he would
flew in and out for like three days
which was mad but we didn't want to
leave the kids alone nor do we want to
bring them just just just in case you
went to LA and it was cool but we missed
the kids would Easy Rider
nice nice guys except there's no puddles
that is the corner to make all of us
feel a fatty
I'll miss you guys I wanna know a little
adventure
soon
- laughs no hello princess Amelia
you know
tmesis we're in America we're in
California oh I found it oh yay
right here a little bit once
I just realized I freaked up there's
like other buttons I'm supposed to prat
I don't know fun fact
Alessia has never been to sorrento
because that year 2016 was the last year
we actually went to sorrento did you
know that did you know that you've never
been there and it was such a tradition
that we kept up but in 2017 we didn't go
but in 2016 we did go in sorrento almost
mash the camera guys so the kids have no
clothes
thank you excited we arrived here and we
just had to just jump straight into bail
what we've come here before we were just
single we've come here as my age without
kids who come here right one kid who
come here my age was pregnant so he
married one kid and pregnant never come
here were two kids start deep in the
universe we'll put on a show
Oh No where are you going bringing
around a pocketful of posies
good morning for heading into town

one Apple still all right representing
Italy are we going ready
everyone's in the middle of dinner I had
an appointment four o'clock you know
what you've always wanted
I did it for you because you always
wanted it oh my guess
I figure five years I should commit
another very important fact friends is I
was very tan in 2016
because Ana was pregnant with Alessia at
the time we decided we were not going to
go to Ireland for Christmas like we
normally did in December we traveled to
Galway to see Ana's grandmother actually
surprised remember are we surprised her
we stayed in this crazy castle in Galway
it had a train for a restaurant and then
they had all these like birds that they
allowed us to play with it was cool it
was a cool trip good morning friends
from the airport we're heading to our
village it's a very short life but you
have to come here very early

year of year's 2016 like it was
incredible it was incredible and it's
kind of hard to even top that and we
didn't in 2017 we had planned on moving
into our house that we had bought which
ended up falling apart so we spent the
year waiting to see if we could move
into our house which never materialized
and never happened
