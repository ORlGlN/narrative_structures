recognition our room is always too good
so every time you step outside it's like
so hot like on a minute ago I was like
you were like wearing a jacket yeah but
in the air good because today we didn't
do it

started last night and then about two or
three hours last night and then about
four hours this morning and I got a
complete key owed for them just remind

oh the mom the buses are crazy in Italy
okay not here in front of them
interesting car it's like it's like time
now it's not just like time then just
like Italian time and Italian
timekeeping it's crazy it's like
whenever the bus driver feels like it he
turns up we've been eating dinner like
10 o'clock 11 o'clock at night like it's
just like it's totally different like
everything is so chillaxed chillax if I
do not feel under 140 Internet
but it's also a knife though I know what
you're thinking how is that possible I
went here with my friends who will wild
it was what we want after last night it
was like blue 4s sometimes it's like we
were dancing while checking their emails
disco plays but this is prone to me but
they don't have a card reader there's no
way that you put the card into the
computer is there about 100 billion
years olds
so we're trying to find pennies
so we're right at 200 we found another
little place we're kind of funny little
cups how are there this is where it's
over here it has TV has an SD HD slot so
oh god I hope this works
hope you guys see this video some so we
found somewhere the world's smallest
last time when it's actually Auckland I
hope it is not gonna tally we don't just
be completely in Italian says damn
what's at 6% so so I don't how long it's
going to take so if something works
want some peanut 20 wait this is quite
interested but it's in 6% and he's
trying to tell me that it's done but
it's kind of like flicking around like a
crazy person so I don't know what's
going on yeah but it's in that series
publish chocolates at all so that didn't
work guys so we're still without an
Oprah since in a really bad mood by the
way come on Leo he doesn't want to go
shopping with me even though we're on
our honeymoon and I told him that you
guys don't understand
yeah because it's like I'm gonna have to
put it back in the hotel when I light it
don't break down so I'm gonna have to
upload run this slow internet the super
slow no Liam Internet so sorry it was
super late guys but I tried the best I
could
trying to find a bus ticket we cannot
find it nor do we have any idea what
we're supposed to get our bus but I know
you see our apartment our place right is
at the top of that mountain can call the
foreign country and not go to the near
SketchUp can imagine scheana do boots
and shoes oh my god this one's fair like
little buggy could we actually get shoes
for our
he's a really cool look at the beds red
this is how it's just I didn't need a
bowl though yeah I know
squeaky spoke annoy me the beds she's
trying to bring them home you know what
for the whole thing oh yeah yeah yeah
although that'd be more probably imagine
I'll be and see going in a road any
pearl lead oh my god
look farming lean or Italian tough they
don't wear in common they are multi I am
we've seen neuter to Maltese today very
popular around here oh my god that was
it big with this one here
alright this light sleep on that become
free that is
it's always a problem we can bring in
and stuff home late but besides that I
think
oh boy look at the picture actually has
monkeys in the picture like that means
you have to get them if you get him like
for a valley oh yeah yeah so we finally
made it to the bus stop extra bus stop

like slacking if you see it it's the
kind of thing but also outside some
thing we did view from here we walked up
