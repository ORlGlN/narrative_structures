early
you got the time wrong and I was like
what you know what yeah I worked out
really nicely though what kind of yeah
so he got shown ran by the owner instead
but um he was so nice
unlike for us boy I wanted to buy his
house it's just because he was so lovely
and like
I thought it was like an older couple
the whole time Jonathan like it was
right away psychic but iTunes I thought
I just assumed that it was an older
couple
and then like at one point during like
when he was showing us the house he was
like oh my wife died a couple of years
ago and I literally my stomach like
dropped I was just like oh my god I
thought I was gonna start crying I just
thought he was really nice and then I
just felt really sorry for him I mean
like I want to buy his house only
because I really liked him and it was a
lovely plant I just think it's too small
no like it's just it's it would be too
small like we could we wouldn't have I
think it's maybe smaller than like it's
200 years old so it's cool that it's got
much character but he said that period I
did
