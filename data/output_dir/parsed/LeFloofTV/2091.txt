so much except the only problem with
this bed well it's not even the bed's
fault it's actually more seen asphalt is
that senile likes to rip up stuff like
fluffy things like that so it's shedding
a lot just like my rug upstairs which
means that Mommy has to vacuum a lot not

hair is like parted in the middle right

always from town makes his lunch and
leaves like a mess okay some of that is
from me obviously but hello and then
like he never hangs this up it's like it
was that hard to hang stopped after for
some reason there's just these little
things but he does I mean I'm not
complaining because he's really good in
every other way but you know what I mean
like you always have those little things
that your other half does or whoever you
live with doesn't like it when they do
that like I remember when I was living
at home my sister used to always eating
yogurt and then throw it into the sink
but she'd throw like the actual carton
to the sink as well as she wouldn't like
throw that in the bin or in the
recycling she'd throw her yogurt carton
with the spoon into the sink and then
whoever had to clean it up which wasn't
always me but sometimes it wasn't me
would have to like you know wash it at
recycle it and put the spoon in the
dishwasher I just saw this it drove me
crazy or just that little yogurt thing
with the spoon and his sticking out it
would drive me insane
