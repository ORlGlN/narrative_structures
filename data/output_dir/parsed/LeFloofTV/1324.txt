like running around hi Viva be by the
big girl huh yeah Eduardo finally got
some floor time without being trampled
on my his fake sister that's the problem
it's hard um with Amelia because she
doesn't realize that she's gonna hurt
him she's just like playing but you know
sometimes she is a little bit too rough
and you cannot be in a different room
like you have to supervise at all times

okay
I'm going to have a naptime friend we're
gonna have a nap time not enough time in
Irish just say oh yeah by the way I saw
lots of people a while ago we're talking
about this this is what we do we tie it
up show me you can reach her anyway but
we tie it up anyway
plus when her bed is here it'll be all
fine you just won't reach it anyway
oh we know we know spooky
on tonight's menu is pregnant jewels
pasta and no I'm not pregnant
I'm Duffy
um but this is something that I think
the last time we had this I actually was
pregnant and I was craving meat
I'm not crazy meat right now but
Jonathan really wanted a meat dish and
unfortunately the minced meat that I had
bought for a spaghetti bolognese and I
was kind of late this week I thought
you'd gone off already I probably should
have cooked like the I don't know the
things that would go off quicker in the
beginning of the week but I don't really
think I wanna find this like not a very
long time so I'm still getting this you
know I'm still getting used to it like
cooking and stuff so anyway I had
Cumberland sausages free-range
Cumberland Sassy's and I thought I do
pregnant Joe's pants back because
Jonathan was at pump of times and I was
looking at a picture of farms and they
got confused every wonder to meet one
the other option was um spaghetti with
plumb clicking vongola and that's where
my favorite all-time pass edition but I
knew Jonathan hollywooding
the secret and I did make the muscle of
the other day so I thought I'd be fair
and I like penne anyway so there was
kind of a compromise but then Jonathan
was eating crisps or watching Lindsey on
Oprah's network you know and what we
were both watching he's eating crisps I
was like what are you doing I'm just
good to get dinner started and then of
course immediate conversing and she
wants Chris and I'm like why would I get
dinner oh okay so you need to add in
some vinegar and some tomatoes and then
mmm pasta who likes pasta e but like
Monsta
that's it yeah and mommy likes pasta oh
that's a mountainous sausage that's yeah
I gave you the most sausage you call me
the song she could before it goes cold
