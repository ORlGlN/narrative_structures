Eduardo's down for his nap okay so you
have to be very quiet I can just tell me
a new book what you watching
did you do dog parties and still write
for dimday no she didn't
yeah I'd be very quiet and if mommy
comes up don't say I know you have the
iPad because I'm gonna say I don't know
you have the iPad okay so you're on your
own mate give your car your disavowed so
Amelia's down from her nap which turned
into an iPad nap cuz she snuck in to
daddy's room and got an iPad and then
brought it under the covers and was
watching it underneath so no one could
see her in that rate I was very clever
of you anyway so I baked this cake that
my mom used to make I think it's
actually it's been featured on the vlog
before it's called out flow literally no
one knows what that means
cuz loads of German people used to write
anything like that doesn't mean cake
like I don't know what that is but I
don't know it's like a family recipe no
but you can add whipped cream
and yeah right
great start anyway so this is what it
looks like but you know there wasn't
that much batter or I think my ratio of
Paris the batter wasn't quite right so I
don't know how it's going to turn out it
might be a bit crap what what do you
think okay see it look look it's like
think
