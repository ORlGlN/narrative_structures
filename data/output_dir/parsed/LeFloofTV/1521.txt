camera without the thing right and the
problem is to win ones across the
microphones with these at this small
sort of pocket cameras and you get a set

what these actually do is that they sit
across it and they block it like this
story so it uses the original one the
mic come off but add this one here the
skinny one look it's actually the
perfect length I think to cover and just

first well it's not my first vlog mess
but it's my big announcement where I'm
announcing the beginning of vlogmas and
my commitment to you guys to blog every
single day I mean I know I've loved in
this channel every single day but to
make a video every single day on my own
channel so I'm gonna make a pup like I'm
so scared
alright it's done I just made a public
oh I hope I can do this for an actual
month
that's what I'm scared of I'm scared of
failing but I did blog miss last year so
technically you know I proved myself one
year before but this is like making
videos is harder than vlogging obviously
so we'll see how this goes
fingers crossed I do it every day what
do you think when I do it every day for
months

what are you doing are you doing where's
your poo you take it off

here some when we were at chopping today
oh my god I was changing it was when we
were changing Amelia's nappy and I think
I was closing like the zip of my bag or
something and my nail just like got
caught and it ripped like tore off and
it went so far down that it started
bleeding like I had to just yank it off
it was so sore and so gross small it is
now it went all the way down there it
was so painful I don't know what is with
me and nails but like it's weird anyways
that was just and it was in the middle
of like we were in you know a shopping
centre so I couldn't really do anything
I just had to get like there weren't
even any tissues in that baby changing
place which is so stupid but anyways I
had to take like a wet wipe and just
wrap it around in my nail because it was
bleeding and then like we had to
continue shopping I don't know what the
hell is going on with my nails but now I
think I want to cut them off me there's
