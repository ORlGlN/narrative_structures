final word oh no oh oh wait yo yo mrs.
career oh my goodness that world was
amazing it's like West world for kids
it's an old movie from like years and
years ago you know it's like what to do
what you do right is that the kids have
to go and work in like the beauty salon
or like the shops or the bank or just
like make deliveries and everything and
then they earn money and then they use
that money that they have in their bank
account to go and like go to the
nightclubs or go shopping and stuff I
doubt like there's an entire economy and
everything in there it's so mad like I
think I was more excited oh my goodness
just flight simulator thing I couldn't
convince the kids to go on it but I
really wanted to go in it anyway hope
