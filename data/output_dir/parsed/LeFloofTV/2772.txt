every time we go for a drive recently
because Abby's one years old now he's
become quite a big boy and one of the
little traits now is that he doesn't no
longer want to sit here or daddy or
would mommy this is what he wants to go
there got a little good boy he's a good
pony let me take your points here we
have it we're coming out ones
come off on the ovulate
are not going off that road
all the way to little piggy little piggy
when I was in college in Cork I used to
live in this place called Wilton there
isn't much in Wilton but the best thing
about Wilton is a 24-hour testicle right
over there the observant ones below may
have noticed that we're actually in a
completely different car did you notice
that we're going to clashing to collect
Anna's little sister who's I think she's
finished school as she finished school
after her rehearsal and now we're
sitting in traffic we're in the DIY
center here in Cork and I decided I was
going to build a pond for Anna's mom so
I'm gonna build upon before what I did
when I was a kid so I went this morning
we got the lining in the granite in the
sand we got place and and now I'm
looking for a shovel trying to find the
right stone in the pond see I saw the
big rocks okay they're kind of cool and
then this stuff is a bag of stones
here
granite more like naturally-occurring
stones that's right look at these
Glenview things yeah did you get a bag
of them yeah I think you should get 15
quid it's a bargain buster
we've got damage to here
but then over here which I'm looking at
look at this digging that easy get this
thing here see looks like it's gonna cut
you too grandma
go shoot amber have Gary I'm going to
turn you to the pun first good I have
dug that's what you call a team what you
said in the first part which is to dig
out the actual outline of the pot yeah
nice little edge if you can kind of see
it there but you see to move around the
area just step back a bit
No
the hole has been made you know you
might reach the point where you think
that this is crazy idea it's a crazy
idea okay
we hear about this far name and you say
to yourself I wish I'd never started
this because I can't
I could just like pour a lot back in put
this on top
and then say forget about it but what do
you guys think huh gotta put the limp in
I'll be what do you think almost done
with this part the next part we gotta
put the lint in be kind of lumps sorry
have to lose now have 5 and the hole has
been dug and it's being leveled off what
most Gardens of you probably find tons
and tons of rocks so what I've done is I
bought a ton of safety fun things and
yeah the best time in the world okay so
we've done is just gonna put sound into
my hole okay this place is we gonna stop
all the rocks and bursting my lighting
see there's a lining
now the moment of truth
well this ohef let's not hold I hope it
holds so it's day to define project so
let's see you got Tommy fitting up
nicely
the stones right on the side what we got
to do now is put all this stuff and the
slabs around the edges you see normally
what I could do is over here is I can
put a nice edge to it
 because I want this to make
naturally-occurring
I'm gonna do here see I'm gonna dig
under here beneath it and then I'm gonna
took the actual lining in you can press
the ground back again that way I think
you'd look pretty cool again I'm totally
making this up as I go along
and now you can see edge of the pond
actually flows nicely
well I'm still working that area
the pond is nearly completed so you can
see the water comes up nicely to the
edges here you wouldn't even notice it's
a little feature here what you're
building on and now I'm just gonna build
a sort of a rockery just sort of
complimented a little crunch here and
then to sort of finish off the area
planted some little plants turn there
just to sort of make it all seem a
little nicer I shall sit here now and
admire my great work
see
they're heroes with one so you're gonna
grow pulling down now finnaly grass and
here dries up it'll all spread out
nicely and it'll cover the last bit of
the lining I don't know
froggy in there nice vines going there
broccoli here can invite more insects
and creepy crawlies to come in living
upland there we go guys leave me a
comment and let me know what you think
of my pond bye
hey guys quick note it's day three and I
just wanted to point out that you went
yesterday and I picked up some lily
plants and some other little greenery to
add to it I never put them in a video
and I rained last night and the time is
still here kind of adds to it a little
bit
so cost was overall this entire pond
cost me about 40 euros if I have to do
all the labor obviously myself but I got
the liner pretty cheap from Jake a local
garden store in the rocks he saw at the
start of the video pick them up in that
DIY store the show which is expensive
right now I didn't actually include the
shovel in the price because the show was
about 30 euros except I only bought that
because I'm his mum and have a shovel so
if you have a shovel that's obviously
going to say people are just buying the
sand find liner find the rocks find the
plants no for 140 euros but that's
pretty much it it's not that difficult
to do it's a lot of hard work you know
it's fun
