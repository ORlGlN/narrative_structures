good luck good yeah more linen hello
hello my my friend me léa léa strange
best friend
you don't anymore
my goodness could you imagine look at
them all cause you imagine any couple
years are like in two years and Alessi
is like sitting here probably still in
this house let's be honest sitting here
wearing a uniform huh
there's room for one more
there's a mommy and a daddy so for one
more roses it's colder guys start the
car the whole day is going to be set by
the first song you hear on the radio in
the morning go and look what's this 1.8
million subscribers in the channel so if
I was just to Daren think it was 1.8
million people I probably stop how is
the TV show from last night unplanned I
don't know what okay with us because
there's plenty more surprises still to
come disciples feel like I have gotten
nothing done today it's just peace so
hard with Alessia like she's such a good
baby I can't complain I shouldn't be
complaining at all
but it's just she's she's a baby like
and she's at that stage where she just
wants her mom well I think she's been at
that stage since she was born to be
honest like she just really likes having
me like being on me and I know some
people say like oh don't pick up your
baby too much or whatever but I just
don't really agree with that like I
think babies love to be coddled and you
know and Emilia was a very different
baby
she loved cuddles obviously but she was
very very independent like she would
just I don't know she would just sit
down a lot like by herself like play by
herself or like lay by herself
for longer periods now Alessia is kind
of getting slowly getting used to it but
she's still my mom thinks it's because
she was so small like when she was born
and she just really wanted to be feel
like she was still close to me which is
actually a fair point
I can't really remember with Eduardo I
feel like Eduardo 'he's babyhood i just
kind of because it was so full-on like
cuz emilio was still a baby herself and
it was just like having basically like
having two hundred two it was just
madness so I can't really remember a lot
I need to watch Mike the vlogs the prey
or the baby updates to check but I just
feel like like today I really wanted to
check all the nursery which up until a
few days ago was not a nursery at all it
was my office space room filming room
type thing was ringing office and and I
read that's all I wanted to get done
today but I just can't like she won't
let me put her down and this as soon as
I start getting into it she starts
crying again and I can't do it when
she's napping because it's the room that
she's napping in I really should have
thought about this before and done it
before but just wasn't on that page yet
so there's a lot of other things going
on as well like behind the scenes that
we probably that we don't vlog and stuff
so it is just it seems like there's not
enough hours in the day honestly but um
I do love it like I know that this stage
isn't gonna last forever so I'm
definitely not complaining I'm just
saying like oh yeah it's hard
maybe they're hard work okay Mario is
home is why did you want to come and
wake Alessio with me take off your
jumper net say good morning again hello
