this is a doggie toasty I mean yeah I
mean you look at what is eating a banana
he's eating a banana
things like come to town right now he's
smiling about it too
yeah nice
that nice was it wider eating some
banana he's eating it though there's
natural instinct to chew you never you
know he never eaten in his life before
yeah he just new computer you guys seem
to like it
OOP boy he's probably gonna eat more
than you at this stage hopefully they
encourage you turkeys they're nice
Oh none what's the name media really
wants to get in there you want something
you want some weenie a--
no banana poops yeah you fight why are
some food
Eduardo ego thank you for me yeah baby
food baby of me Mia are you a baby baby
oh they're watering him you didn't be
ALS challenge you know what you come
back from holidays and you realize that
there's something that smells a bit
funky in the fridge and then you go to
look at it and it's bad it's really
really bad yep I'm a bit scared right
now cuz it sneaked everywhere all done
nice and clean that was disgusting
so Eduardo had his banana for the first
time and I think he really really liked
it he is just hanging out here it's been
sticking his fingers in his mouth and
getting all the banana I just took it
off him but he had his bib on and he was
trying to get all the banana leaf that
was on his bit into his mouth it was
really cute so definitely think that he
likes that Jonathan's got our picture up
waiting two years later and then is
sometime next year we should have our
picture from the same printer that's so
funny every time we got a printed that's
like the year after so it's not what's
relevant anymore but it's Eduardo is
obviously not in that picture he looks
like such a big boy you know that I put
him next to a media as well because I
felt like they wanted to be beside each
other and they wanted to kind of look
since now that they're both gonna be
eating at the table I'm probably not
gonna I mean he is still only he's five
months on is it Monday I think maybe
it's Monday Tuesday he's five months and
so I'm just gonna take it slow with the
food I'm not gonna do like too much he's
probably just gonna happen not enough
for a little bit and then maybe we'll do
like Apple or some things you go from
there
