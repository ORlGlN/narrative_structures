oh I'm gonna get you happy Friday Friday
Hirakud baby had a Friday we're having
Ready Brek again this morning because
Missy likes it a lot so she's got it
ready Brecon I've got my porridge and
then she's got her blue breeze and her
banana so we're like twinsies huh
there's not the coffee yet and we both
got our waters too just like mommy oh
she loves blueberries big time
what are we doing if they actually came
into your garden we picked up the bin
for you that'll be pretty cool
Xena
wait your mom give it to mom and give it
to mommy give it to mom but what good
girl
mania Cena's gonna throw up for you
earlier Amelie I was sitting at the
bottom of the stairs and Cena would like
push it down for her and then she wanted
a media to throw off for her but she
can't understand that I mean I was too
small so she just takes it into her bag
big girl where's a good girl Cena
yes Oh where'd it go see you now if it's
a toy fetch it we're gonna go where's
the ball who's gonna get it first um
what's this who are you who are you just
wandering in here who's come wandering
in here oh my goodness the world has
changed I see that can I bet see that
you give it to me I'll throw it you get
the ball just organized no not in media
I just organized and maybe as drawer
this one here or under her like changing
station that's covered in laundry cuz
I'm doing laundry right now but I just
organized on her nappies her water wipes
her babes they're big ones and small
ones and just kind of essentials that
we're always reaching for it that was
like a dumping ground like this one so
this one's next on the list but I'm
happy that this is nice and organized
now and it'll be much easier to take
things out because people had just kept
like ramming things in and then just
like shoving them at any which way and
then it ends up being so messy but
things like that make me happy
oh that wasn't stressful I was like
trying to film with video presence Ollie
and Jonathan was busy in the beginning
so Amelia had to be there but I was
using like overly hot
her line and she was trying to distract
her with other stuff but who's just so
stressful and then like there's
construction work going on it's side so
there was that to contend with them and
thanks I mean good see I'm so like
frazzled anyways I filmed my hair
tutorial that's all that counts huh
Nevaeh best friends is anyone else sing
