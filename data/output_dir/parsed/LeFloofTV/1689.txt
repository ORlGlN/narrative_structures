Julianna I need you to explain to me Lia
the idea of crawling forwards just like
that
really you are you are you are you are
you taking it up you picking this up
maybe
oh my god guys guess what
Amelia slept nine hours in her own crib
last night I am so proud and so happy
because I got a full night's sleep
for like the first time in I don't know
how long because you know when choosing
bed without she'd be like kind of
feeding thread and then you know like a
little little comfort reading here and
there but that was amazing and I think
it might be because I seem to have
better I think I did one extra fee that
day so maybe I should feed her a little
bit more in the daytime not like crazy
but just a little bit and that might
send her through the night but she is so
good and then she woke up this morning
and she just was playing with her toys
she didn't start crying she wasn't upset
it's just like insane maybe because
Julianna was sleeping in her crib
yesterday when they were here and she
left her scent and maybe she likes she
binds to an ascent comforting I don't
know it's crazy I was a little bit like
oh what if she smells like another baby
and thinks it's odd or something you
know like they're her bed has changed
but obviously I had that opposite effect
so yay well done buddy buddy buddy buddy
