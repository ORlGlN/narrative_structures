good morning everyone so I do this every
single morning I just wanted to show you
guys because I think it's so ridiculous
I don't know why I do it
but I love my dogs but Amelia doesn't
usually finish her porridge at all her
perch comes with raisins and the raisins
are bad for dogs like they shouldn't
have raisins or grapes and so I fish out
with my fingers because spoon doesn't
work as well fish out all of the the
raisins so that I can give them the
leftovers because I love them and if
they know exactly what I'm doing they're
waiting so I'm just trying to do the
hoovering thank you and Jonathan forbade
me from doing it thanks Joe feed oh
you're welcome I'm here in your stroller
carpark - strollers car another tree oh

like she's wearing jeggings so it looks
like she's has jeans on but the thing
with babies and jeans is that they're so
cute on but they're so impractical like
changing nappies when wearing G which is
such a pity because I actually like
leggings on her on little girls and I
think they look really cute but then on
boys I really like jeans but I bet like
when the baby gets here I'm gonna be

casa su casa

sign actually no Amelia please don't
fall asleep I really appreciate your nap
times zombie did you folks leave a
little bit but I got her into bed so DF
these are the a virtual collection
lights they're nice I like the little
bit in the girl brown bit he said for
the long logs and blue and gray in my
face
they're the decals for honor and the
flavored ones
we also got this stuff right we're gonna
try a different one I think this is the
down here
Aveda it's just a different shampoo
because I think it maybe is getting a
bit of a break out from the other one
that we should be swapped out to I think
she's having a reaction to it skin a
little bit of rashes and stuff so I'm
gonna try to have like this one try this
for a couple of days and see if it
doesn't have an effect on it okay she
got my stupid skin I have like
ridiculously sensitive skin so hopefully
she didn't you know what the good thing
is don't leave home when it's either
like if you maybe I got my sensitive
skin when I was a kid I never ever got
spots so maybe she never ever get spots
but you have sensitive skin Anna
on the other hand Scott loads of spots
but then she doesn't have sensitive skin
so it's a toss-up
so nap time didn't work out that well
