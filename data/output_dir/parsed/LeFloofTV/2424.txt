topped over with parmigiano so I feel
really sick for some reason I don't when

headache like super super bad and I
thought it would go away if I went for a
walk when we just weren't the one that
we were just on if you rewind a few
steps but um you didn't go away so I
don't know what I've been drinking lots
of water and everything I don't know

if anybody's upset or sad or feeling
sick or anything he always comes in like
cuddles brassiness very different than
that but and look starting
so I'm trying to drink lots of water and
like hope that it goes away I don't
really like taking things like taking
drugs but yeah taking drugs like oh I
don't like taking anything like even
aspirin and stuff I usually kind of save
that for like a last as a last resort
and I'll always like if I have a
headache I'll always try like going for
a walk
or taking a nap or like drinking water
just something kind of like more natural
and then if that doesn't work then I
will have to take something but we don't
even have like salt 15 or aspirin in the
house so I went out to go if this
doesn't go away hopefully after I eat
something I'll feel better that rainout
