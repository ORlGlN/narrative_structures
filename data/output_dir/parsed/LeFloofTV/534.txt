oh that was weird just upside down so I
am going to get my braces off
not really so I've got Invisalign I've
had it for the past year and a half
no that's a lie
is it no it's not like I've had it since
I can't remember it was supposed to be
ten months and then it ended up being
longer which I think happens like quite
a lot actually
so no it's probably not a year and a
half but it's at least a year and I
cannot wait to be finished with it
because my last set are like just I've
had them for like 12 we know 16 weeks
which is insane um and they're so yellow
and broken and cracked and I just want
to be rid of them so I'm going in today
to get all my little like I don't know
if so you have even noticed but I've got
little like attachments on the sides of
my teeth you can see when I go really up
close you can see like little like
triangular little bits like sticking out
I think it's it's weird but anyway
they're like the same color as my teeth
so you can't usually notice from far
away but I'm getting them all removed
and then I'm also getting my final
Invisalign aligners which are gonna be
from I think it's for a night time only
if I've got that wrong then I'm gonna be
really annoying to me cuz I don't want
to wear them anymore I'm like so over it
now um so yeah I'm gonna go do that now
and I'm really excited I'm back
hi how are you I've literally been going
around I came up with Jonathan who's
like hi he was like hi he didn't even
notice anything different but all the
little bumps are gone and my teeth are
all straight and I got um I don't have
to wear Invisalign anymore except for at
nighttime that's fine that doesn't
really count I'm so happy I can't
express how happy I am right now
straight teeth because I didn't get used
to like how they looked like straight
but it was always with those little
bumps on and now I can actually see them
I know it doesn't look that different to
you guys because you can't you you're
never like up that close but to me I'm
like
because to me it's just a big difference
