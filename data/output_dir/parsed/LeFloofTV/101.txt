doors we have to change over and add all
the new doors up until 24 20 feet I'm
sure it's in here now you can no you
canÂ´t stop sneaky but yeah there's
exciting stuff in all of the doors guys
but I need to draw on my Christmas
outfit and my Christmas beard and
Christmas everything and on the 24th we
reduce to math or it isn't far we're not
doing fire with friends but this is a
little behind the scenes this is where I
look like on set SJ Xmas said not in
character such a cool I hope you guys
enjoy my SJ accidents idea I can't walk
away a couple of months ago I mean a
team or it's really hard to secure
really cool brands to be able to gift
you guys really cool prizes every single
day for the 24 days of Christmas
it's crazy amount of stuff that's going
on behind the scenes to make this work
for you but I'm hoping next year we can
make it even bigger and better and like
international and just like much better
and cooler but for the moment I'll do my
best
okay it's freezing behind the scenes oh
wow dammed and yeah I better get my
Santa suit on I better get to work
this is our snow by the way this is
where we get our snow from hello little
baby you know little baby I haven't seen
we haven't seen the back door look at
your hair
look at your hair I think we can almost
make a little even mo hogs
look at you partner baby she wasn't
crying a minute ago oh that's tough I
didn't look like wash
cream wash well it's his cream see you
better
I gotta go take care of the monsters
oh really oh I thought that was okay for
the shower all right where's the monkeys
yeah good girl and a fake yeah no you're
just documenting a finding that oh that
time can be really stressful some time
and some and you know what takes the
most energy out of you at the end of a
day as a parent is being angry at your
children like giving out them as you say
in Ireland telling them off as you say
here in the UK but yeah it's just like
that having to tell them are having to
scream at them before anyone comes on is
like I never scream at my kids good luck
that's great amazing because God is a
perfect life right there but no I have
screamed many a time about 20 minutes
ago I was just screaming down the heads
in fact I took a chunk out of this wall
I didn't but it may have I may have done
because when you have three children and
one of them is a baby and the other two
children scream because they're acting
up and they wait the baby you go a
little bit psycho okay you go a little
bit insane and you want to murder
somebody so you take it out on a door
instead of digging it out on your
children that's very healthy okay or
like a bottle of water good like scrunch
it up like throw it in the bin I'll be a
good tip yeah because otherwise you're
gonna go mental
hey there the elfin hand strike that
worked for Bethany I honestly upstairs
was contemplating the elves just sending
them away they should go back to North
the North Pole throw busy and busy
because I was watching just don't even
missed him does know what he's talking
about um I was watching
hey Kaylee's vlogmas so i've actually
been really that's the only loudness
that I've been watching I don't really
like loudness well I do like it but like
I never enjoy it in December it's always
after she's last year she's got four
kids stuck me okay she said that last
year the elf they were just really
naughty the kids so the elf went away
and didn't come back
and I was like good job and I've been
seriously contemplating sending those
elves away because the behavior in this
house has not been ideal I remember the
like you may think that on camera things
appear certain way and it's not any
specific child before you start guessing
because it's not it's just in general
yes like the perfect right now because
she's a baby but all of my baby
touchwood we're always very like chilled
out very relaxed very happy very content
but then like afterwards
obviously they grow up and they get like
influenced by different things and their
lovely children like don't get me wrong
I love our children I wouldn't trade
them with anybody else's ever but there
are times when they are very very trying
so I'm never gonna show that on this
vlog but I'm going to talk about
afterwards
I'm not going to go into aesthetics
either because I don't want to embarrass
them but this is just the reality of
parenting like it's just really hard
sometimes and sometimes if you're like
killing somebody or ripping your hair
out or both or smashing I think against
a wall but not a living thing not a
living thing yes that would make you a
murderer
