good morning everybody and look what
came to greet me on my chin this morning
actually it was there yesterday as well
but it hasn't decided to go away yet it
is my stupid humongous spot it is been
here since yesterday I think and is the
most annoying thing ever because it
won't like come to the surface you know
what I mean
if you know anything about spots it's
just like one of those ones that sits
under the skin and is really sore and
then last night I tried to UM this is
kind of gross but I try to burst it
because I just want it to be gone but I
think it was too early on it wasn't
fully like developed yet and now it's
kind of like still just bothering me so
I put some gel on so that's why it looks
like that's even grosser than it
actually is all the wet stuff is not
actually coming from the spot it's just
like gel like acne gel so yeah so I am
going to make coffee because we have
this tradition that I probably never
told you right
but it's called actually it's not really
call it anything but it's where like on
the weekends or on the days where
Jonathan isn't going into studio I make
him a coffee and he says in bed
and are you doing manicure to go peepees
anyways and it's just like it's become a
tradition of mine that I bring it
upstairs and then when I hand it to him
or put it on a stand in his bed say to
me what I say
or they're up and he loves he like looks
forward to it order up every day that he
isn't
so that's kind of like the whole order
up tradition trick nice or any accidents
in here too sometimes Gary's gonna treat
halo you guys
oh yes speaking of you guys just
reminded me my my train of thought
okay so we're playing around the idea of
calling you guys something and somebody
said to me and I did you know what the
man I said I was like you know what that
makes so much sense you know it's like I
didn't want to call you guys something I
never actually call you guys you know I
wanted to call you guys something that I
actually called you guys you know
instead of like trying to force myself
to call you like the flu FERS or force
myself because it was like the family
and all these different things and I was
like but it's gotta be something that I
say all the time you know and ask again
what do I call you guys it's like I'm
always talking to you guys every day I
spend my every single day we you guys
I'm like you guys are like awesome and
then I thought what Jo Paso duh may I
present you guys that's what I'm gonna
call you you guys it sounds kinda like
uggs it looks like us but it's not
really good you guys that's all you mean
like you guys cuz someone I have to
common otherwise like one comment in all
of 202 came in and one of them said like
near when G you guys I was like going
you know what I do many times I say it
in the day every time I'm like you guys
ready you guys come here you guys you
guys are awesome for this you guys you
guys you guys why I just call you guys
because you know anyone said guys
because that's kind of insinuating that
you're all male but you guys I don't
think specifies to male or female it's
kind of like everybody looks like you

she's freaking out why are you freaking
out Anna why is that
the shower I noticed that my boobs
weren't really likes rolling and like
you know like like this and I was like
that's interesting one of the symptoms
of being pregnant is a need to clean the
house a desire to clean your house what
did you do this morning I feel really
tired and like I found a headache and I
just I feel a little nauseous or
something like oh the notion of food
just kind of just like oh yeah breast
pain no vomiting no temperature drop I
have no idea
bleeding staining no lower abdominal
cramps not unless it was period cramps
hot flashes no weight gain no weight
lost no metallic taste on tongue no food
aversion kind of a missed menstrual

check yeah it's always your head now
okay nipple or breast tenderness yes
fatigue and tiredness yes food cravings
yes
frequent urination no softening of
cervix I don't know what that means
constipation kind of lower back pain no
darkening was areola around breast
nipple I don't know what it feels weird
desire to clean a house yes so hold on a
second so essentially what you have is
your lazy hungry and you have the tender
boobs so you're lazy you hungry of
tender boobs with a slight aversion to
clean in the house I don't think that
