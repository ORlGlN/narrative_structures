good morning friends it's the first of
October and we are Halloween eating and
icing bags I have I had the world's
smallest hammer in my hand I know almost
lots of dog look at this thing I can't
find a real hammer I know they would
have moved out there quick
all right let me hang up well this what
you'd like because I need it to be kind
of like on center of this oh I see what
if you just put the rope it around here
no it's off center that's a problem see
you wanted to run perfectly up the tank
oh yeah okay that's not too difficult we
can do that hold on this is what we've
ended up wish looks cool isn't it and
look and I put these things you guys
remember these there from Hanley's in
court they're the longest later longest
Halloween decoration we have we have
more but I don't even like them I like
them we need to get the inner Pig that's
so cool look all the years the six years
if you're married we need to put the
other one in there this one I'll close
the front door and they all expel all
know the bravest one like see how it's
splitting we should want to get them all
matching or is it better to have them
all by I'm gonna do it like black cuz
then it would be black and silver but I
don't know it's the kind of fun that
they're all like different as in each
year the different reasons I'm Harley
get them that was fine because that was
a wedding present I was actually a nice
frame
definitely brought in really Natalie

gonna get married soon and you want to
think of a thing to do isn't it
it was your idea I never talked to do
that huh

cool idea your hardest thing though is
remembering to print the picture every
year to get it done every remembering to
do it to take pictures of cec but it
seems simple you just say one photo a
year printed and holding your hand and
take another photo but for some reason
it's some reason it's not easy to help
kids especially yeah yeah it's gotten
more complicated each year like oh no
that's not last year although it's the
same cut area like next year yeah I
meant this year
