the McCanns look I like the little ones

back of a GT change
it looks longer this is lovely though
new clients are lovely
the interior is so nice enough you fit
so many kids but you can get a little
conversion kit to make it a seven-seater
my legs don't fit in the car like I
prefer your big car because I can't kick
my legs you know even in her maserati
