careful Eduardo why did he wait so
Alessia
what do you think it is huh this is the
bassinet part of the strolling because
Ana is gonna be on her own she's
bringing this device with her Celestia I
think is ready to escalate immediately
never ever went to one of these things
night by that the Sun got nice and
eduardo went like a couple of times but
Alessia she's all sorry about this one
I'll stand in the way the Sun I'll be
the shadow got its horrendous corner
there we go
what do we think do we like it huh
do we like it look at a slice of it's so
big it just feels so big okay
signor the nest on my head I'm the
screaming baby I'm the phone besides a
screaming baby okay so this is like
parenting 101 what not to do
yeah so I just wanted to show you guys
nice are you tonight yeah it's good 1 2
& 3
everybody done with me sex even left
dude a banana dance I don't know the
worth actually it's not the work dining
no noise myself anyway I'm saying I'm
gonna need to revisit this hold on one
second
I can't wear it down because it's too
hot you HOT are you definitely not
that's even worse I was not giving the
words okay what are you gonna do so as I
was saying unless he was kind of upset
because she wants food but yes I got all
the little things that I wanted like the
add-ons that I wanted for this buggy it
took having to go on a transatlantic
flight to get me to do it but basically
right which I found I found my friend
the cup holder that was in the garage
for a while I also got four of these
well I got two of these and then I got
two of another one I love how this
swivels that's cool
it's a buggy bag hook I really like the
pack upon changing the changing bag is
kind of big like it's a little bit too
big but the pods that actually come in
it are really really handy because you
can just like take that out rather than
taking apart the whole changing bag
because like this one it detaches from
here but like to have to do that every
time it's kind of annoying so with the
pack of pod you just like take that out
and then you have all of your stuff
handy so I think I'm good to go I have
the car seat as well which I need
because if we're going in cars she
obviously needs car see
not for the flight but oh wow they're
bringing up two units yeah
jump a little ass up exactly but I have
to yeah I never saw it that plus the car
seat yeah I know but it's the law it's
the law well actually even if I was
going somewhere else I probably like
she's so small she's not like her yeah
but no I mean you traveled him in the
car seat keeps me in the car seat
practice you're also bringing the best I
know but I think so she can sleep she
doesn't like the other she doesn't like
sleeping in her cart plus it's not
really good for her anyway yeah maybe
she's gotta be mental like there's no
maybe I like this is what I'm doing
there's no maybe Franchesca way you know
so we should I know
might you be done your own I mean I am
kind of on my own
she keeps looking at me like I'm gonna
miss that so much
who knows what you gonna miss me
I'm what you're gonna miss me I'll tell
all the people at home how much you're
gonna miss that milk
