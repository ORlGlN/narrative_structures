concerns when we moved in cuz he wasn't
even in here yet but now since the photo

Jonathan still needs to build these his
bed well this isn't this would probably
be his bed in like 50 billion years but
yeah it looks really cute and like
boyish right now and then he's got his
tent his castle those cables need to be
moved but aside from that that needs to
be hung and then his bed and there's
still lots of stuff that needs to be
done put leaves it's like
coming together it's actually filling it
some and then if they lease at the set
designer and set producers or producer

literally the way the analytics work on
YouTube is that if you go through a
video and it says first view first
comment first everything and as you're
typing f or 100 people of the comments
so it looks like you're first you press
and pull and then I reloads and you're
like 100 and then it was like you are
first so you are first for point of a
second but then so many people are first
you know because our videos goes up I
like 6 o'clock every single day so many
people come to the video at the exact
same time so I can actually be
legitimately the first person to see the
video I can't even do that anything what
would you call a pie made by a shepherd
who lived in a cottage would it be
cottage pie or shepherd's pie or Chicago
pie
