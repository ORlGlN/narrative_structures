like nervous but she's kind of excited

Valentine's Day to all our friendly
friends where in the world is it more in
a while as you dug it up well
makes me miss giver you Skinner a big
well with the zoo yesterday oh my god
it's like lashing out there today
waiting here for the fire and Haley no
idea
yeah BC wasn't worth it all today very
often you with the light-up shoes oh my
goodness what a stormy day like we did
so well yesterday apparently I think
that storm is that it's coming back I
don't think we were probably wondering
why we took the smaller car to camp a
rather than the larger mercy days the
main reason is the larger mistake
if you're in a storm with the Wainwright
this little car here has four-wheel
drive Quattro which I must say is
incredible I was watching cars when we
were driving down from corporate alone
from side to side it's different lanes
this thing didn't move didn't budge it
has an on-board computer for like
drifting around corners this thing will
not move in any storm and it's so small
on the ground that it's aerodynamic that
the wind when the wind catches it it
doesn't it just flies right over the way
the car is designed for his view of a
car like Anna's car you know it's a
rear-wheel drive sale that's gonna just
catch the wind ameba third that is why
we buzz but that's the same reason
brought this car to pause that day when
when the storm happened oh my goodness

had the baby
