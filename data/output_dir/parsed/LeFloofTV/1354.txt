right no tickling before bedtime I've
learned I can lead to a bad place
okay is that her choosing the sleep I
love you it's so funny I came down just
now with my running shoes on my runners
I never run nice let's be honest my
Nikes which are a million years old
and everyone always asked me about but I
don't know how to tell you where I got
them because I mean they're they're by
Nike but I got them like 25 billion
years ago so I don't think they exist
anymore sorry but anyways I came down
all these little doggies her right there
I thought cabinet because they know that
these shoes mean a walk and of course I
have made a goal to you know go for a
walk or do some kind of exercise three
times a week it's now Friday so to make
my goal I have to
do it today tomorrow and the day after
so I'm hoping the weather is nice these
three days because if not I'm kind of
screwed Dibby Dibby Dibby feel fidelity
people do but a needy people do funny
helpful more watch me know what its food
is lunch home from her walk is that you
lunch that you food hmm hmm I think my
lunch hey food
hey food they you know he thinks do they
know what the food okay so it took me an
hour and two minutes my average speed
was five o'clock 5.2 km/h and I burned
excuse me
387 calories we shouldn't seem like that
much I think that's like a dessert it
looks like a slice of cake or like a
cupcake or something so I suppose it's
actually not that bad it's probably my
dessert in the evening so whoa
it didn't eat dessert today even though
I did and then it says the distance was
five point four three kilometers
five kilometers kind of a lot actually I
think so that's pretty good that's cool
that I can do that and I can track
myself what happened
the Tito dear at it actually looks like
a little Tito does get a good look it
right down there and I go right down
into it get a good get a good sniffles
oh no it's ruined we're gonna have to
get the whole garden replaced seriously
