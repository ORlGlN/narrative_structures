little bit of shade so he can actually
be outside we're all just hanging out

little bit too hot out there and I'm

so these outside applying light bread
for the weight I mean I think they're
okay if we toast that what yeah I'm not
short anyway I don't know what
Jonathan's doing for lunch because he
kind of he said he would let me know and

to go into London by the way in case I
didn't mention that but um so we're home
alone today so I'm making some ham and
cheese toasties and we just finished
that so I'm hoping Jonathan did get
something because otherwise there's no
time for Doby unfortunately having our
lunch outside weirdo fell asleep
