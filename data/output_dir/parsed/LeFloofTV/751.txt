weekend well not really what kinda kind
of pretty tough mother trying three
tough boys their training playlist is on
at the same time as the Tough Mudder so
we could cancel playlist and go to a
mountain and be abused well I think I
might go to Florida I could do not so
tough mother easy mother easy father
just got ready for the day it's like 1
o'clock it was so late because I had to
work out a bit later today because I
gave up my slot to Jonathan because he
didn't get to work out with Lucy the
other days or yesterday I'm also kind of
liking my natural hair lately like
usually I don't like it I just think it
looks messy
well I kind of like it lately it is kind
of messy and I think it needs to be like
pinned back a little bit to make it a
bit more acceptable because I did the
bikini wax the last day I really want to
get everything once now so I don't want
to shave anymore and I don't want to
have the hassle of carrying a razor with
me not everywhere whenever we go on
holiday or you know stay somewhere I
have to take my razor with me this is
disgusting but I think letting my armpit
hair grow and like I swear every time I
work out with Lucy she's probably like
what a freakin eight woman is like what
is wrong with her why did she not shave
round beds so I might go and do that on
next week but I really want to do it I'm
like such a wax I'm such a wax figure
that's what I was going to say but I
just think it's amazing it's so good I
can't believe I didn't get into it
sooner I'm like kicking myself so that's
what's up with my own armpits and my
hair growth recently in case you were
