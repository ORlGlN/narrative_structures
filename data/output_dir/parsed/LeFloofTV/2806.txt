my name's Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey
Jeffrey Jefferson now before they're all
thinking what gentlemen of gentlemen
thinking about well I'll tell you right
now little Snicket I'm here today to
teach one so how one should speak when
speaking correctly to a correct person
one must always vomit when speaking
mornings always a sign of one's wealth
no more one box taking in my previous
paragraph one must create one's words
with extreme location for example if I
was to go into the shop in the morning
and get myself a paper I would say hello
shopkeeper well you don't see the common
kale vomiting he'll never know I lost 10
to my snails I must tend to my wife
