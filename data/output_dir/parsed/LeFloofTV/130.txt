anger never wants to get involved wait
guys what are you going to all right so
we have all the leftover pumpkins which
are going mouldy guys and nobody likes a
moldy pumpkin so look Oh No so I guess
we could put it in the compost or we
could take the leftover fireworks and
you know sort of combined and bow
together and create some sort of
spectacular pumpkin pie
now we don't want to put anything really
loud or too big but just something small
okay just for funsies okay maybe like a
fountain or something what if we put it
in a fountain right and the fountain
like comes out and like maybe I should
get a GoPro guys and film it in slow
motion yeah because exactly we don't
want to make a lot of noise right and we
don't want it to like explode everywhere
all right I think so much Bianca oh
that's great goodness me
he's dogs are so hairy young Jonathan
would have taking all of these out
broken all the ends of them and stuffed
him inside of it and that would have
been enough to make that thing explode
completely but unfortunately that
Jonathan fella he's not real well use it
I want to do that all right let's be
honest guys I want to do that I want to
blow it up but I have to consider these
little monkeys here and I think that
