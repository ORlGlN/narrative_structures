year Andre the grandfather of Sophia was
talking on the back on them fishing he's
crazy by fishing itself and I think I
invited me to go fishing I didn't do it

prettier than that and then when we got
here he was like do you want to go do it
this year and I was like you know what

and we're gonna go way over there
somewhere and we're gonna catch some
fish I'm not a fisherman but I'm willing
