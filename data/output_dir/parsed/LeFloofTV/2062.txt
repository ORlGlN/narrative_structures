get them done um whatever yeah that's
cool
what about what's involved in the first
plan using injections or warming or do
they pretty much know I kept ringing but
you guys kept saying like no no it's
fine wiggle eight weeks right okay cuz
they're pretty much like the mother or
now she's having none of them anymore
like they tried to feed off her but she
keeps pushing them away
yeah I'm not reading the normal like the
puppy food now themselves yeah yeah they
are wrecking the house eating everything
yeah
cool alright see that all right Betsy no

like whatever

crying in the corner I'll be end up
holding all the dogs Oh God
there's gotta be a good blog guys whoo
um hello there she was lost
poor she yeah she's on the middle part
even landing she's nowhere to go for
down what are you doing puppy don't you
guys know about the vets he owes this is
what you were born
oh my goodness you were pointing that
corner crazy huh do you remove being in
here I wanted it she remember being in
here give us a quick wrapper give us
Detroit rapper thank you that we do goes
it goes it takes us me favors see you
later thanks thanks for the tricks I
know
hi mr. Cabo box let's go guys Oh
and in ah next Oh catch a puppy don't go
bad in there hip hop up you go outside
I'll visual peepees boy in the pop scene
they're just one posture yep next stay
oh good girl Bianca say they're gone
mental
what new pop stay there now stay there
my god
a box of crazies
holy moly you find a more traumatic than
the dogs think I'm sick to my stomach
the facts are thinking about this we
really hope that they do that injection
on and no artist on injections over in
London when we brought out of it to the
vet for the first time yeah I cried oh
my god he screamed though like but if
one way Sina was thought in injections
before and not scream she just she
doesn't like what
have you do not spring you know like
it's a needle hello I don't know I just
it traumatizes me so much I hate the
buttons we don't hate them I hate I love
our vent I going to the vet
what are they like right there I think
they're asleep there's not much that
else they can do Ruby
no idea let's see Roxy Cena was looking
at the windows
I'm crazy
I'm just not saying for this kind of
thing at all
going down it thank you
don't cute you're gonna fall back
together
Oh Yoshio
no Theodore
no idea
Sammy's gonna get the first time huh but
she's still kind of she can hold her own
I don't think the other ones kind of
play with her and she gets a bit snippy
sometimes
is it the nose one or no no no that's
the next time no much time to get a
seven in one day and a stronghold
properties more steeper grade she per
carry
yeah you know you could tell like she's
so dramatically smaller than right there
we tried feeding her like you got to
melt stuff yeah no just wouldn't ever
get the dropper is everything we even
tried pushing the other ones off than it
was and putting down but you do have a
blue stomach a bit yeah she's probably
like to believe that would be poor
circulation yeah um and so oh good she
did this she doesn't rhyme either so she
probably had a hole in her heart or
something that circulation yeah but you
didn't try a hole cutter it's mostly
still sad
we're not breathers so we're not used to
this he'll probably use any major
very upset about it okay the mix oh yeah
I want take the usual in I reckon you're
crying yeah I need to change to rotation
I dunno oh I'm a sound what a sound
obviously they are probably wrecked that
was so easy like cuz amazing well you
know what the hardest part was one that
cost but everything wasn't about no um
look here all falling all over them like
yeah he was like they're so healthy and
they're so like everything was perfect
he was asking about mini Islam he was
like I think the blue stomach thing he
thinks that there was a hole in her
heart and or something so
but it endures but anyways so we got our
look at these so cute there's four of
them little vaccinations what you call
them booklets or whatever so here's our
checklist first vaccine at eight weeks
second vaccine at eleven to twelve and
then you know what's really cool is that
we wanted to get the microchip
because I will be in seeing our own
microchip it's just bad as if you're
lost
yeah I know it's way better so they're
doing a deal thing where you get a free
Micra come in for their kennel cough
vaccine at 12 weeks they get a free
microchip thingy as well so that's
really good and then the vet actually
recommended because we were like what
are we going to do because you know we
need to get things sorted I we don't
want to do this again
it was fun the first time it was great
the first time but we're gonna help like
four no five females in huge Oh God
so he was like cuz we thought get pee oh
and I'll be done yeah he was like no I
would get the girls all done first so we
have to wait six months for them to be
done but Cena definitely needs to be
done like oh my goodbyes yeah when we
get back cuz it's not really fair to put
her through it like straightaway but um
yeah she needs to be done pretty much
straightaway because I think she goes
into heat around August July August well
last year it was August so we need over
six months every six months yeah um yeah
but last time she went in a little bit
boring so so we'll do that and then
we'll see and then I asked him as well
as that can we get all of the girls done
together like at the same time and he
was like yeah that's that's perfectly
fine because that will be easier and
it's not an overnight thing or anything
so Albie will be happy to hear that I
would like to get I'll be done it's just
that he's had two major operations on
his eye and he's not oh he's just I
don't know he was very excited
traumatized or a traumatic them just so
we'll see but um look how cute this is a
big bundle here so if bring this in the
next time in a month
this one here okay should we let I don't
know like put her in the back in this
thing

giant needle in their neck and then rub
some cream on their back well that's not
