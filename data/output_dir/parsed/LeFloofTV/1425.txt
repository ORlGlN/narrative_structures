we show our friends our little tumbles
look put this here
good morning everybody Emilia and I are
home alone again today
Jonathan's gone off and he's gonna be
gone for not the whole day it's not like
it's not that bad actually but he will
be gone for a couple of hours
hi she insisted on wearing her bow this
morning when she came down she wanted to
wear it to breakfast so she is I have
just spent our the woman that comes to
clean she's coming today but I have just
spent like the last I know like half an
hour cleaning I do this like all the
time it's so ridiculous but I think it's
just like the nesting thing I always
like I'm particular about things anyway
but then when I get pregnant I just go a
bit like more insane than usual so when
I told you that I'm gonna buy a new car
so actually I did it today one that will
ship the whole family is actually a
guarantee this is that nice and spacious
well enough room in there for a junior
and Amelia you know I think it's a
relatively smart car to have you know
sound it just seemed a little family car
definitely room for everybody inside you
guys think this thing so much fun though
isn't it I think in me do it well but
look at the space back there Stephanie
I'm much more practical car to have you
know why not one exam it wouldn't money
where else maybe at mood winning media
and then junior go off to college
I don't are you helping that your Bobo
what are you doing that one has
strawberries on show your outfit show us
your outfit
can we see teen up clean up you're not
doing a very good job though her outfit
is a bit pick on her but it's so cute
it's like a little foxy dress and some
leggings but it is quite big step Oh No
clean up your bows come on put them all
back put them all back in you're gonna
put it in put them in the box
see ya tada
maybe actually I should go with this one
instead it's a lot more practical thing
it's so cooler than that like the size
of it like it's better to me what did
the media do when she first came here
she threw this ball yeah and media and
she knows that if she did that at home
she would be kicked like she would look
at me and go like do you love Alma's
house so I painted my nails last night
for junior I painted them baby blue
what's gonna happen now is that he's not
gonna come until like past his due date
or something and I'm gonna have to
continue painting my nails this baby
blue and then I'm gonna get really like
sick of this color and I'll be like ah
why did I start early but just in case
because I've been getting Braxton Hicks
contractions at nighttime
and I keep thinking that I'm going into
labor and then like what I do is I just
move around to see if they'll go away
and when they go away I know that it was
just Roxton Hickson it's not the real
thing but just in case I was like I want
me to have to be blue because my nails
were pink when I was like induced with
the media's so it's different I was all
prepared but yeah I don't know but
anyways so I was getting her out of the
car and I chipped on the seat belt I
chipped one of them and I was like no
because I did them last night I was so
annoyed at myself but anyways yeah like
I said I'm probably gonna get super
bored of this coming okay this is
actually the car I bought you may have
remembered it from a while ago a similar
car oh look at this thing huh ah isn't
this gorgeous isn't this gorgeous a
median cheater are going to have the
time of their lives in there huh
isn't that so beautiful I like the front
the new front on the air hands it's
someone I've soaked in any fun it's so
cool-looking a guide an auto sports star
a by the way you guys want to get one
they got loads in lying around
this is so this good a space for the
dogs the babies and the dogs huh it's
not several gorgeous about aliens but I
want to steal it on me now okay alright
now I'm trying to get home I hope I
didn't have a baby while I was gone
that would be unfortunate alright think
I was calling my mom first who's eating
cheese are you bidding Parmesan cheese I
did not ever know that in media I will I
know she likes parmesan on top of her
you know her pasta or whatever but I
never knew she liked just straight
pirated cheese yeah I'm not too well I
just I never gave it well we don't get
it like that we always get it pregrated
the funny way I never tight on her but
she really liked it she asked for the
two more pieces she goes hmm hmm hmm
more oh my God look at this big girl
look at you
she's got no handy set the high
chair or like the hi cherry insert that
we have here
she just we decided to try without and
she's obviously big enough I can't
believe I can't get over that see our
chairs are lower
oh yeah like it does not work
yeah it doesn't work sorry plus she has
the trip top anyway you could yet they
insert their what so cute are you
looking at none no who's that
no no no what are you doing okay so
Amelia had like the best cup it wasn't
even a cupcake this is what you already
had George so I didn't think she would
want it cuz most the times she doesn't
really want it she doesn't eat that much
but she okay
thank you she devoured a whole one here
you shouldn't have no I got she because
that was your okay wait hold on I just I
need to wash your hand easel caves good
graphic so excited I drop into my mom's
house and get some double chocolate
Swiss roll we're unfortunately those
doors the price I know let's try to
bring uptown
I almost two years of you to pull your I
need me I mean you're not the one euros
worth looting at one your I don't know
but you know I don't have to share it
with you is to be here tonight first I
have the driver in 1000 I hopefully out
is out baby if you do have a baby she
wouldn't fall over there my father at
all so we just got home it's like almost
four o'clock now meaning out I fell
asleep in the car so
who is this who is this new visa and
Sina I don't ever see you playing
together that's cute
see now you're a bit bigger though
it's kind of an unfair fight she just
got back some time ago yeah I thought
asleep in the car stole I she was
actually so exhausting
I put her dick one and like I took off
her jacket and her hat and her boots and
everything she didn't even wake up so
she was like I'm deaf so she's her room
and she had all fresh sheets put on her
bed and everything so that was nice
so Jonathan said he got delayed I think
you met his mom for lunch and I think he
said he'd be another two hours so I'm
kind of debating I actually feel okay
with my energy levels are all right so I
might film that video that I wanted to
film are you mourning I know I'll regret
it if I don't do it but at the same time
I'm like hmm I couldn't make it up huh
but I think I might just go ahead and do
it yeah I think oh well oh my god is it
so rainy such a rainy situation
and I like there any situations okay
I went to our to visit my mom
while I think
sometime in January I wish I'm kind of
shared spirit I asked her I said
I think it's kind of relatable
the same circumstance
in January my mom that
pretty scary you know when you're around
your parents
they realize your parents
I'm already on our way to deal with that
yet
I remember going through when his dad
and
it's just like saying it's just the
worst thing
she said that like the service that she
got it all was incredible I
the Irish hospital system
got monogrammed some and then hit
biopsies
oh well I'd like a few days ago she said
like she's okay she's clear you know but
I was like two months
certain
terrifying it is the most terrifying
word
word you know
I know she said it to me you know I was
like you know I could just feel my heart
sing
thankfully
that wasn't scary you know hopefully
yeah I mean I had a good day
Jr probably had a good day I'm not a
hundred percent sure Brock I'm gonna see
me
and look at it look at the sunroof in
this thing now I mention it's a whole
roof the whole roof you get you've been
closed by the other way would you ever
want to close that like the whole roof

blown home hopefully I get home so it's
four o'clock the meeting is probably
