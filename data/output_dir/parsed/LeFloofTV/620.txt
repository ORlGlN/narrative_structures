good morning and welcome to this video
friends I don't usually eat
Anna's baking cooking stuff because it's
not that I don't like it it's just I'm
not much good I'm not much of a baker
eater but today I decided you Anna made
me a blueberry pancake I figured today
will be today
what's for that what do you reckon I
should I put with this thing I've got
maple syrup with dairy free so if you
want to keep it Terry keep it daddy
three kids are inside yes if you watch
it on a snapchat this morning or
yesterday we're trying to get into she
put all their toys away because you're
going to give it to the charity box and
it kind of didn't work so well because
we do it all the time with this thing
where it's like anything on the floor
and Kent fives go to charity bike
because they know we give lunch to stuff
to charity and then Eduardo starts
bringing me his toys to give them to
charity I was like well that's not
working come up really good elaborate
things to tell them that you're going to
do they don't do it but then you have to
follow through and it's the
follow-through part isn't it yeah my
first ever of Anna's pancakes I'm going
to eat dairy free the life
here's like banana
there's no panade all right back
I think I like it hmm it's made out of
batter
what how is it it opens our hmm my case
is fried batter and yeah it's good it's
actually good right now I should eat
this part look at this and yeah feel
your nose the media went off the
shoulder tops like it's come you look so
cool head length nothing what what did

yellow box here we parked inside the
yellow box
he's the new ones just so I didn't have
to wait for the cars and stuff that's
the rules go go go go did you know if
you guys want to go in a trolley you're
doing a walk all right
good choice we could do a standing
trolley or do you want to spit in one
oh no their money ones Oh No
okay give up on that plan whoever
invented the trolley but you haven't put
the time in them I hate you a little bit
right now just a little bit go
all right I've come trying to get
something for the children because I've
got it in a garden they love helping but
then they trying to use the big stuff
and it never works that is happening
that causes more trouble so I figured
there must be some sort of children's
options or like really small little
rakes and forks and stuff I could find
are you behaving yourself back there
what's that what's on let's go
do we need all of those things yeah
whatever the hole is to beat you hmm
don't you suck on Andy you might not
actually exist just decide in my action
is something I've made up in my head
that exists but it will be cruel

don't need mittens we don't need to
bring them too softly anymore we can
just bring them here if here to be
having just as much fun do you
