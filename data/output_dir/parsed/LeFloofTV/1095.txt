time
so that's why you haven't it's not that
we have a dog that we just don't like
care of it we never show her so we're
like you never show your seventh dog

stepped on him Joerg under water frozen
solid she weighs towards a mountain on
the other side she sang a song snow
required to write only footsteps in the
sea I don't know the words of the song
so well but I know it goes something
like pasture with Chili Peppers sausages
