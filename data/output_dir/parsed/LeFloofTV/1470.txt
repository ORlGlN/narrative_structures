morning let's cause you see that
I'm like a train I change choo-choo okay
better birdcam away
there's extremely steep drop about to
come up here now and putting best about
doesn't holding this camera get you on
the flippity-flop so I have something
really disgusting to talk about so if
you are not even squeamish but if you
don't like disgusting or gross things
then skip this part of the vlog so I was
cleaning this morning as usual and I was
kind of doing like a deeper clean and I
had noticed that there was a smell
coming from just in one particular part
it was really bothering me cuz I could
swear that I could smell pee but I I
mean I vacuumed like underneath the beds
and everything every single day so I
couldn't see anything there was no pee
and I just I don't know I was just doing
like a deeper clean I suppose and I was
picking up the beds and like turning
them over and like feeding them I hoped
to get rid of any like crumbs or
anything that was in there and that bed
that I was just talking about I when I
tipped it over I smelt like an
overwhelming smell of pee and then I
realized that the bed had been either
peed on or peed in I'm not I think
probably peed on rather I don't think a
dog would actually pee in their own bed
but I know who it was it was obviously
be because he is the only one that is
not neutered and he still marks
sometimes but I didn't realize that he
was still marking that bed but oh my god
I feel so violated I just feel like all
this time that's disgusting stinky bed
was in my kitchen and I didn't even know
but I did know though I could smell it
and I was just doing me insane so that
is in the wash obviously
and I like bleached the entire area that
it was in now Emilia and I have to get
dressed and I'm going to this cinema
today with my sisters and we're going to
see frozen I'm really looking forward to
it but obviously Emilia isn't coming but
