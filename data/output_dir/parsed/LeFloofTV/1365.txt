Oh Peppa
hello hello this fine Monday morning
this rainy fine Monday morning so worse
situation is when you run a nappies I
think it never happened when it almost
happened once to the media but when
you've got we have tons for duardo and
we new to his turns out there and then I
opened this morning I was like these all
say newborn I know what level you got
level one probably hasn't moved up a
level yet I mean there's at level fives
get more careful I know what's a nicer
diaper seems like a nicer word than
nappy give us a second nappy you know a
nappy nappy say there's a nappy nappy
nappy it makes you feel a lot like nappy
you know where's diaper diaper
oh that's a dapper die for you for
caught on there young man as you can
tell I'm extremely surprised with the
insanity avenge all right that's
Baghdadi's oh let's turn the lights off
so today our this morning has been
pretty stressful so far if you could
hear it white oak dance tears crying
medium run out of nappies um I don't
even know how it happened all over
though um Edward I was screaming because
he keeps um waking really early like
before 7:00 and then he won't last long
enough for his next feed like just and
then I'm trying to get things done it's
just so stressful
um so I'm trying to get immediate
organized but I have to work today
and I don't have any thing planned for
her like I never I mean Erik has gone
back to school so I don't have anything
anyone to mind her so it's going to be
really hard like these next couple of
weeks until we move to London and get
something else wrote it out in terms of
like the mornings for her it's just
going to be hard because I still need to
fill money to you know edit and work and
stuff like that but when I don't have
any help right now it's just
even with the two of us here like
Jonathan's working too obviously so the
mornings are like the worst because
that's when we get everything trying it
everything done so I'm going to try and
get her dress now and figure out how I'm
gonna entertain her while I'm filming
today Wow may is amazing Wow may is like
the start of summer gee the wetter so
good guys
maybe I'll go ahead to the pool I go
swimming today so I am here to collect
lebackes live oh it's quite real now
guys our domain we decided we have I
don't know I think about two or three
weeks is a bad enough time I think to
get everything organized so by the end
of May I think I think if we play our
cards right we are we work diligently as
a team we can do this friends so I'm
going to pick up boxes
um sure well I know if you guys remember
but when we move last time we found it
Sam you can buy these box sets and you
specify how many rooms were in the house
and then you buy a box set it's like
Netflix for moving Netflix removing that
that would be a good idea it's that
might have a problem calling it Netflix
okay so it did actually stopped raining
which is superbly handy that's the big
box that on big box one kind of small
box figure that should probably do the
job so you want pepper - yeah sure no
