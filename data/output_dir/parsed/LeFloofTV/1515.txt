this golf and his office is like right
in front of me and now I didn't actually
I was pretty sure it was him
on who was on the phone outside his
office because his pictures up there too
which I didn't even notice but I was
pretty sure with him I wasn't 100% and
so I'm trying to park the car and I
tried to like back off because I went in
really close to it and every time I
pulled out I kept getting closer to the
car beside me and it was like literally
like we were so close there was like
millimeters between us and there was no
way in hell I could ever get out of my
car or that car could ever open their
their door or anything like that so the
guy who was on his phone and he took
because I started having like a meltdown
I was by myself totally by myself but I
started like throwing my head in my
hands and be like I'm gonna do and I
like talking to myself like a lunatic
and he took pity on me he got off the
phone I even heard him like basically
say like oh hold on one second I hate to
come to this woman's aid cuz she's like
having a meltdown
and so we get off the phone and he told
me exactly what like he talked me
through exactly what to do so and he
told me like exactly how to position the
wheels and everything and he was so nice
it's like he was so so genuine and nice
and I was just like so thankful that he
helped me out because otherwise I would
be so stuck and then when I was getting
it he's like don't forget to turn off
your lights it's like oh they're
automatic you probably thought I was
complete idiot like a complete

want to mean is like he's like a member
