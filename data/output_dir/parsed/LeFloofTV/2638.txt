I'm going to try and not fix the screen
can't forget about it
screen doesn't work but now the computer
doesn't really work very efficiently
because it's constantly overheating or
little bugger let's go ahead and fix
them on first thing I'm actually gonna
do is I'm gonna vacuum the laptop are
you thinking like you have to vacuum a
laptop that's insane as a matter of fact
it does help if your computer is
overheating wait a minute isn't that
where all the spiders were you think the
spiders like jump back a lot so it's
just like turning it on finding all the
air vacuum holes the ones in the bag and
you just basically forcing the fans to
work as these crazy things suck in a
crazy amount of dust
step 2 buy a new laptop the m1 710 in
2005 or 2006 dual-core yeah doucour√©
and then you've got the studio XPS which
is a quad core you know that bugger runs
an i7 quad core system 980 my assistant
I think can I help you can I help you do
you want to assist do you want assist
ok you can assist no how could I resist
that little assistant of mine your papa
that's my seat you may sit
see she is she she's I guess not be
Donna it's just a little bit Irish oh
yeah I roll like that so I plugged in
one of my externals in here I've cleared
a new folder on the external drive
o'clock XPS backup October 10 the matter
of pulling all the stuff off this onto
that and then and then we can just wipe
it clean it down this is all we're gonna
need
now expats computer software especially
this drivers for everything and it's a
bugger here which it's Dell XPS service
pack 2 even though I'm gonna have to
download service pack 3 the moment it
installs how he likes the soup
oh boy
oh boy that's noisy oh boy that's noisy
but it's definitely working more
efficiently because it's not stopping
which is the important part
oh great even more girls have arrived
this is becoming pretty much like girls
house
okay I'll be where it works screaming
outnumbered these days we've got to do
something about that small problem I
have with the computer is that I need to
boot from the XP disk or I can't
actually do that because it's gonna show
up on the monitor screen which is broken
not the actual TFT so I've gotten here
to the system utility which is pretty
simply gonna start an eager IMS conf yg
which is Microsoft configuration there
wasn't really do when I want it so I've
gone a disconnected the screen and then
gonna plug it into this and then
hopefully it's defaulted on screen
straight away on the startup awesome
that worked
now I can get rid of this stupid screen
because I've access here and what I want
to do isn't want to boot from here found
Wow Wow sudden thing should happen there
we go oh he does it he does it he he did
it I did it I did it yeah oh for sure
though I'm officious or time for a
reward jelly baby anybody and think now
