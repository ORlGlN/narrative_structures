waiting for your mommy or daddy oh oh
we're on the entire wrong side into town
because Anna brought us the wrong side
into town so we're trying to find a bed

better than the floor
I think they could all fit the media
Scott and they go out sleeping the
blow-up bed huh be cozy
do what everybody what are you gonna do
it everybody welcome home Hey look feels
like business like a nice home but
that's kind of close it but it's not
really like you could actually oh
there just be a spare bedroom
hmm it does have the bars rendered if we
gave it to Amelia
Emma give Eduardo her bed she always has
to leave her stuff behind he always gets
the second hand stuff that's your fault
for coming second
Sheila come first no luck you get this
good maker
see the gun shop I know sorry I kill you
it's partly for like yeah dogs himself
where is a gun shop yeah you should go
in the I saw on your own home
anyway so look just a chocolate oh yeah
okay I have some points out while
vlogging
he's Zoomer oh that was not a success
the beds
we're just Indian we just thought you
start like oh I'll just buy this bed
they're like oh it's a tendon operating
this huh can I have this one
so yeah
we don't have a bed but we will probably
an appointee those my original plan was
to go to Ikea
we're here why not just look in bakery
poking us up for some lunch
I said nick-san here take a look at some
of these let's talk about this on the
other channel about the beginning some
row breaking you know I'm going to enjoy
the man himself but I wouldn't mind
trying look that's right I am Finch the
one triad somebody is that robotic stuff
you know this is a whole lot more roads
and raise up mountains and I'd be good
to get fit like you know doing like 30
40 come on there big long stuff but I
don't know anything about road bikes so
I'll try to come up with tires compared
to tires I have it's crazy so different
like it's a whole different game it was
kind of cold this morning I felt like
we're just kind of dark so I decided to
put on jeans it's the first time I've
ever worn change do you think who's a
huge mistake
I started to bring new jacket there's
also huge mistake
I'm also rushing because I went after
the bike shop while I was getting the
food I think the food is ready the kids
are crying hi hi hi there
oh my goodness hi everyone hi everyone
oh no no no no no no no no no no no hey
hi hi where's Amelia hi hi I heard the
screaming for me you got a cookie it's
not nice you know who did it's Nevaeh
this Nevaeh yeah she's in Eduardo's fire
but she's all wet get more wet hmm
look at her face Oh anything yeah I
actually can't tell them apart like I
can obviously but it's so hard to tell
you apart they're all wet
it looks so like Italy gonna last yes
we're back up here folks it's so cool
when you're right now on Keaney City at
the little edge road there you're riding
through there it's like crazy drop-off
so excel ready she's so amazing you know
carefree ever since trimmer the first
time I went out here you guys watch the
video some I was over neither side I'm
at that tire hill area there I got so
lucky we got so lucky wearing boots in
the UK it's so amazing like I think we
were also super lucky where we looked in
Cork because Bala hora like an amazing
mountain track is like so close you know
am I have a we have a little team of
people working on a meet-up
for our and at the moment I don't have
any information any dates I do I'm
pretty sure it's going to be September
and it's going to be in Dublin because
we're like we're going to Sorrento and
so shortly and then we're not going back
in our until sometime in September or
the UK total September will be home and
then things range again so probably will
be in September and it probably will be
in Dublin because double is the most
fairs you know we think about like
anyone from Northern Ireland can come to
Dublin in from Southern Ireland can come
to Dublin West in come to Dublin East
you're already there so it's cool I
think it's most central location in the
country for Ireland so it's most Coolio
anyway what I was saying this a time
while we're putting into place we're
kind of thinking we're kind of playing
around the idea of what about like kind
of going on tour ish you know we'll
we'll try it out in art and then if it
works like what if we like took like our
top 10 countries that watches right just
a sample just an example right like I
know straight up it's it's gonna be okay
taking my America
we're gonna American doing all the stuff
next year right so don't worry America
and the Pacific I really like to do the
Pacific you know but you know and in
like in Asia Australia and all self but
it's gonna be wild for that but any
would just say maybe at the end of this
you
we could do something where we could
like very easily like do like Germany
Spain France Holland Belgium and Finland
Switzerland Sweden you know kind of like
I'm sorry of a mess you left your
country out you know maybe we can go as
far as Poland Czech Republic I don't
really know I don't know just Iceland
shall be mental but I know we know I
just I'm just gonna like see if it's
something I possible because I love
meeting you guys it was so cool in
summer city when we met people and
something like you know or really
emotional when they met us and they were
crying and stuff and I was like I don't
even realize how much of a support
structure our videos are to you guys I
know how much you guys mean to me you
know me but I don't know how much I mean
to you guys and it's very hard in
comments and tweets and instagrams and
all that kind of stuff because it's not
really real you know but when I meet you
guys we like hugged and we have a little
chat it's like Oh real yo our
relationship is real it's tangible and I
really want I want I want to do that you
know and I have no idea why I start
talking about that or how this got me
into a but I don't know I just think

going somewhere I just I lost it but it
was like put a videos on the Internet
oh that's going somewhere guys turns out
I did not regret wearing the jeans
fantastic information but we always fell
asleep we basically got into the current
velocity because that's the parents show
they just basically hide in their car to
get a babysitter right and then you go
right to the driveway and they just
basically go sleep in their car
that's essentially what happens thanks
