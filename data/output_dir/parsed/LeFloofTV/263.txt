brotherbrother so Jonathan's just
feeding questions and I was just think
Jonathan there's so many things that
I've done not so many like most of them
are the same but like there's a couple
of things I've done with her where I
wish I would have done it with them like
comedian Eduardo I did express like some
handful of times with Eduardo so I think
Jonathan did feed him like a few times
but it wasn't anything like regular like
what I do with her luggage Express every
single day with her so that there's
always a buckle
Jonathan never fed Amelia like when she
was a baby
like he doesn't feel like he missed out
like he didn't miss out because he was
like but she's the bait third child I've
already spent and I was trying with
because she's the first one which makes
sense was so he doesn't care like that
doesn't bother him at all but I just
feel like and then also when I went to
baby massage class I was like oh I
should have done like something with the
two of them but I didn't like when they
were baby babies like Eduardo went to
like classes and stuff in the media not
as much it's just they're all kind of
like it depends on where you are in your
life
Oh
