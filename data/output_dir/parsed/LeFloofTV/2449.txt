looking at a few places there right and
how was it the houses in the country are
amazing and the houses in the city are
always like they all look the same I was
like let's live in Bandhan or y'all
always like diggity hoppity towns you
know cuz they're like gorgeous TVs and
mountainous farms and there's like oh
yeah man you go to the city and it's all
bleating saying pay me off which I don't

make it work like Tesco like off to
Tesco we go tonight what doesn't I can
make it work I can make it happen
you know you need to believe anyway so
I'm going to done stories because we're
sick and tired of Tesco Plus Tesco never
have anything in stock well the one that
we go to like never has anything in
stock yesterday I wanted to buy
strawberries there were no strawberries
there was nothing except for greatness
that makes and some moldy strawberries
and some deformed strawberries yeah I'm
not gonna get those they weren't even
knocked down they were trying to put
their full price they're all deformed
and like green
anyways but we've noticed that before
like done is it's kind of better
probably cuz it's Irish and we get a
story for every pride use and everything
so it's actually better for us to go to
John stores and it makes us more like
patriotic
what else anyways reading
I don't know so that's where we're going
right now and it is another miserable
day it's been miserable every single day
at this summer yeah everything summer
started in Ireland this question I keep
getting as well because people are like
it's not summer but I used to get
confused by this too when we first moved
to Ireland from America and I remember
we're doing like seasons and school or
something and I would get it wrong every
time and my teacher would be like no
it's not that it's this because in
America and I'm not sure what the rest
of the world but in America the seasons
are different it's a way of my brain it
says June July and August summer
yeah put in school in Ireland they teach
you that may need June and July are
summer August September September
October are Auto August then why is
always that actually makes sense
and I just said all cast is still part
of the school summer holidays and that's
technically autumn like that's pretty
weird
but anyways I used to get that so wrong
like whoa I wasn't wrong I was just I
learned it the American Way first or in
a business way they break it in the
quarter
so it's Jenny favorite March quarter one
yeah hi June anyway so that's why people
are like what are you talking about like
me first is not summer but you go in
Ireland it is
don't confuse summer or anything better
than summer we went two days ago it was
spring this summer I'm gonna sit back
down and wine look at that thank you so
miserable but up up up no we're not
