God take an empty
that's there's something about eating
your food outside I think humans have a
lot wrong I think this whole idea of
building rules over our heads is just
wrong and having dinner inside is wrong
that's we're totally wrong if you should
be outside like this
it tastes better everything's better of
course it was raining right now I might
be a little bit young but that whole
situation is so nice
the beach is Ning dinner they're
different they're green let's go did

little bit thinner but anyways to have
tortellini parmesan blanched almonds
a clove of garlic some anchovy Phil it's
some fresh basil which smells amazing
some Chili's and I'm only going to use a
little bit of box in the media and then
some cherry tomatoes different color
change mode we need some olive oil some
salt and some black pepper
and it's really simple so
I think rock this thing right and it Sam
you plug it into your phone and you look
at it this way and you play games and
like jumps and or ramps and it interacts
play again but look how awesome is that
right
