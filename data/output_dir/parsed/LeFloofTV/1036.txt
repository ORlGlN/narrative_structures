just doing chicken chicken like an
Indian chicken dish basically because we
got nine bread I say we I mean I got an
atom present um these ones which are so
good and we've got chicken we've got
this organic multi medium I think this
is one of the good ones for the kids
because it's not - it's not spicy at all
I've got a pepper some broccoli cuz I
love broccoli and stuff in Indian stuff
I don't know why I just think it tastes
really really good
I liked it actually the last stage of it
with beef - with like a black bean sauce
it was amazing
excuse me where are you going I love
that little jump around him he's
supposed to be watching little baby bum
but he's on his way out
think he wants to be with the big boys
ie Jonathan on the media
come here
to stay on with mommy
the cookies
sorry so this is how my curry has turned
out and actually looks pretty good out
first I wasn't really sure about the
combination of like broccoli and peppers
I didn't put a lot of broccoli in there
because it's really only me that likes
it but well if we're I don't eat it and
maybe I is like hit or miss like
sometimes you'll eat everything then
sometimes you won't you should be like
quite PG so you never really know but I
try and sneak stuff in anyway Jonathan
does not like broccoli so I've learned
the hard way that it's pointless putting
tons that you think they just get thrown
out these smell amazing
mmm I wish I was Indian and I could eat
naan bread all the time like have a
homemade good just be careful Eduardo
