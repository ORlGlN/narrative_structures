featured all before with the dogs and
the dogs are good like if you're
thinking about having a child get a dog
and go to all the emotions of having an
animal and then it kind of prepares you
nothing repairs you were having a kid
but it slightly prepares you a little
bit better from going from like having
you know responsibility to being
responsible for a human that's a tricky
one folks like the tricky one
we went from having no responsibility to
be responsible for a dog and then two
dogs and then six dogs and their child
