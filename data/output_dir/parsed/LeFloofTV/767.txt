good morning Fred morning friends word
out anyway our plan is coming together
our car booth has arrived I don't know
so manias bitching off school today if
you are considering possibly bringing in
at the school this morning but I didn't
realize the flight was so late but then
I told everyone I'd she'd be off and she
said goodbye to all her friends and
everything on Friday and he made such a
big deal Raleigh and then it was like I
just come in today with her I look like
a fool I feel embarrassed
so we'll keep her here soon nappies yeah
you need pity not B's we're gonna go
swimming every day with that yeah all
right let's move these toys all right we
got to build this thing it's pretty it's
pretty groovy or do you read does wider
an order fish to us why don't you order
fish this well he has planned a flounder
where what is the fish new yeah new big
win for Pedro and me
well do you know what when I build it
first and then we'll figure out where
the step is we think guys that's not a
good plan so Amelia sits here at the
back holds on and I has a little do the
slide you see do the slide easy oh it's
got a slightly seats got a foot thing
here well Eduardo sits at the front here
and the more like this seated
wait there's enough room for two kids in
there oh no that's cool
oh yeah so you can have drinks and stuff
so there's lots of optional extras which
I took off because Eduardo never eats
like we never feet in drinking water
he's not a baby anymore I don't know
about the cover thing because it
separates them so I think just like this
I'm trying to strip it down to its most
basic element let's just show mommy
you see them I stripped it down though I
like to make it as basic as possible but
there is like there's a cover thing but
it only covers Eduardo there's a food
thing here but they're never gonna eat
you know so now it's just one day I just
try to make it as simple as possible do
you love it media
well yeah it's so cool well yeah but it
wasn't that expensive and plus there's
another front I can put on in front of
Eduardo but that means you can't get in
there himself this way you can get a net
himself exactly
exactly that's feet are frozen off so
we're going back in do we love it guys
