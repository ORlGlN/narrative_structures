really very festively address we are not
festively dress although I'm wearing
green

there were two tourists looking up and
apparently we can't see it anymore but
there's a golden angel who has a trumpet
and apparently at the end of the world
she's supposed to pull over her when I
first came to Cork and I didn't know if
anyone first thing I did was I was
involved in the court Film Festival and
that was their retirement my friend John
all right so what seems abandoned today
look there's like no one in Rhodes it's
a completely abandoned what happened and
about quarter to about 15 minutes or so
well you know were you in court kind of
telling me that apparently if you're not
wearing green today you got to be
pinched all right
so for everyone that's not wearing green
today I just thought I was going in and
pinched everyone we're just gonna take
quite a lot of time wouldn't you think I
think this is the most event people that
have ever been robbed

are gonna get through but the key is
like a billion million people long so
