did you get a fair coin no what she
isn't that coins cuz sometimes coins can
be a bit dirty imma be you're not gonna
get a fairy coin if you keep that up
keep up the good work
this is the fairy garden in question
Amelia got it a few weeks ago actually I
think I have a video about that
here is so this is my favor
as you can see this will come Betty for
me this year the world is retreated on
Windows or rocks but this is a pot acorn
shell made over me so success me the
hairy face you use your hands so classy
you can see how to make very much I hope
you enjoyed this video bye you're such a
good little bugger you know that I'm
very proud of you is there a plate of
real crystal died right
so when various what you did to pick a
friend okay diamond a trap oh well Amina
take my money
does it not work for you does it not no
go and try what your boat a bit grumpy
this morning's that you know what
there's only one way to fix the morning
grumpies thank you put a hater
and that is how you get yourself in a
good mood for school huh singing a dance
party in the car park Amelia check are
you in a good mood
Eduardo are you in a good mood yeah then
my job oh my goodness she's crazy my job
is done
hello Alice yeah you look so cute huh
you look so cute hello hello I know it
so I heard a rumor that you said mama
but you said wah wah wah wah wah wah
mommy be very happy he said mommy if you
can if you can make that happen
no I'm wearing this paternity top that I
got and it is a nursing like
breastfeeding top as well I kind of wish
it was more not because I want to like
show off cleavage but I just think that
okay not that obviously I think that
look looks better you know when you can
see a little bit of the cami underneath
but it doesn't really go like that it
goes like this which I mean it's fine
too but I just in my mind I think maybe
on the module it looked more like that
I'm not sure I could have thought
completely wrong but I think in my mind
I thought was gonna be more like that
but very good like easy access you know
for breastfeeding and this is a
breastfeeding top underneath and a
breastfeeding bra which matches mint
colored I'm really loving mint at the
moment and are probably more so into
spring but the the bump is st√©phanie
it's there but like it looks massive
right now right because of what I'm
wearing just looks huge but I mean not
huge it's gonna get a lot bigger than
that but like for right now it looks big
when I'm I can still see my tummy I'm a
tummy sleeper and I will still be able
to sleep on my tummy at night even at
fifteen weeks or
sixteen weeks I'm 16 weeks now you
forgetting because I can do this and it
just kind of disappears see that doesn't
disappear but apparently the baby's the
size of a navel orange so I had one of
those yesterday actually
these are maternity jeans they are from
supermom and I really like them really
really like them they're a size 10
though and they are they fit small like
I would size up if I mean definitely
Silas size up if you're getting these
because there's no way that like these
are kind of more eight to ten I would
say than tens but they're super skinny
and I just I really like that look
I've tried looser-fitting jeans on me
and I just don't like them so yeah just
not really me so this is where the kids
park the other day so at this time the
kids actually didn't drive
you know I saw someone who tweeted it
was like oh I'm so disappointed that you
let Emilia drive your car you know I'm
gonna take a screenshot it's and send it
