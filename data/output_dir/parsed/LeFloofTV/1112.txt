winning doggy friends oh it's not

look door doesn't close it hasn't closed
all winter long here sometimes it opens
I love all the water stuff gets in

I'd what expands it's the same as this
little gear this is a mean-looking fans
and contracts can you see it barely even
fits so if you have a door at home that
doesn't close during the winter it's
because what expands which is funny the
