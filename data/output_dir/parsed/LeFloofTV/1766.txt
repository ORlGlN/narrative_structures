don't know why you have a car I regret
my decision is in my pocket I don't know
who loves yogurts she just had a peach
or no is it peach and banana yeah peachy
banana yogurt um which is kind of bad
but keep like I know I shouldn't make
noise should technically we all know she
had butternut squash last night but it's
just the veggies take a little bit
longer to prepare height plus you
usually have a food like usually like
for the fur breakfast and then for lunch
or dinner we don't usually do more than
two meals a day although today we are
just a birthday um we'll do a veggie or
like a mixture of vegetables and
um yeah yeah today I gave her a yogurt
and it's like a fruit yogurt you know
like lunch or a bit of a snack what
we're going to try some thank you
tonight because I don't want to forget
about them but it's just so easy isn't
it to like to get to get just in the in
the fruits because they're easier and
like just chop them up and give them
Perry no whereas with the veggies it's a
little it takes a little bit more
preparation like I know you could
obviously chop up broccoli or carrots
and stuff I'm just afraid of her choking
like if the only fruits that I give her
raw are like banana or else I put them
in that mesh feeder thing okay the time
for talk has ended the time for talk has
