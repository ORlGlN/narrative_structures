our clay pen what did I call it again
here to point a wrench or something I
don't have a name for it anyway I'm
hoping that got shipped in hopefully
that's in there today's I'm dying to
give Amelia some more freedom without
having to be terrified all day long
winner ha ha a terrifying situation I'm
a terrified pair of terrified
you know and at home you know and it's
gonna tonight girls might have heard a
couple of our friends are all heading
out tonight so we have a devilish plan
we're going to try and put Amelia down
for enough now for like two or three
hours and then we're gonna try and keep
her awake for the rest of the day we're
gonna have an early dinner and we're
gonna hopefully put her to bed and then
Anna's gonna head out and hopefully but
a remainder of the night because it's a
girls night tonight they're probably
gonna be out quite late hopefully a
meanest he's asleep though all the time
please please because I got a crack open
Bioshock I've never shot it yet so I was
like oh nice to be a nice time to crack
that open so I had a team our devilish
plan works or I'm especially you've been
comforting your child she sucked about
my raw binary nipples and there's no
milk
so I wanted to do the my first time tag
and I've literally been sitting here for
the past like hour trying to get all the
questions because nobody freaking writes
the questions in the info box and now
that I've just spent this amount of time
doing it I'm like you know what I'm not
gonna write the questions either because
I don't think it's fair stuff have to
sit down and type it like every single
freaking question and then not just
gonna give them all doesn't money for
free no I mean but seriously you took so
long and then one of the questions was
my first tweet so then I tried to find
my first tweet and it took me so long
because Twitter has this like new thing
where they don't allow you to see past
3,200 tweets and of course I've way more
than that but I knew eventually I found
it but you guys should look this is my
first tweets ever August 2008 my first
one was watching psych with Jonathan
when I should be going to sleep then
thinking that my website may have to
revamp telling Jonathan about my day
like who says that hoping it won't rain
again tomorrow
vlogging getting ready to do some
serious shopping filming my video cuz
that took so long
Amelia's probably gonna wake up from her
nap I actually can't believe how much
effort I've got you for this stupid tag
oh this thing came I don't this is
though should I open this it says on his
name on it
we have a sneak deep oh it looks like
it's from a business a business business
thing let's have a little people okay
well that is not revealing anything
whatsoever Wow so I didn't call when 4ch
unfortunatly anyway didn't come
oops we need to turn off your monitor
there we go okay but look who just woke
up from rain happy man hmm
little princess face do I have tomato
soup on my lips yeah probably I was just
in the middle of eating my lunch and
then she woke up was perfect let's go
downstairs all right what's going on
is Tesco giving out free cookies or
something today I've never had the queue
and traffic to get into Tesco holy crap
holy what's going on huh hot cheese
cheese I parked in a bowl spot there's
the thing because I parked in like look
I parked like right outside the door on
those lines but because somebody parked
behind me that kind of legitimizes my
stance in the situation you know I think
until someone has to make the first move
and once one person parts and white
lines
everyone barks in the white lines but if
no one's in the white lines that was
like someone else did it well in this
circumstance I was I was the guinea pig
I set the tone hey guys it's raining
when it rains there's different parking
rules there's different parking rules
for the sunshine because you enjoyed a
nice one you can park at the beach when
it's sunny so you can take the lake walk
takes about six hours to get here but
it's a nice walk and when it's raining
you need to this park in the lobby kind
of I forgot to get a meeting Jonathan
always forget to read Amelia I think oh
hey can you get us some lunch and guess
what he completely forgets about our
baby takes a couple of years for me to
kind of get the idea that I am a father
yeah so no put thing on top of that okay
so we're just making her a mini portion
of what we're having this happens all
the time we have had so many fights
about it what I remember
in Dublin and he like completely forgot
and he was with Benji who remembered you
uh no maybe Juliana was not eating no
but he forgot loads of stuff and
Jonathan brought home like tiny thing
for me and like nothing for Amelia and I
was so angry to remember oh my god I'm
so angry anyway anyways it's fine it all
worked out oh come on crazies I wouldn't
I'm that kind of person I'm not like it
express it better I'm like it'll all
work out yeah and then I'm left to pick
up the pieces no one who actually like
always carries better baby it works and
yeah it seems like oh it doesn't matter
you can just she could just be breastfed
for the rest of her life but I'm over
there she loves because it's like a
combination of her two favorite things
tomatoes and bread and she gets to stuff
as well because she loves sucking the
juice out of things so like she'll suck
the soup out of the actual bread and
it's all mushy so she likes it oh I
thought it's done he's bothering you
yeah cuz you're dropping stuff into your
bibzy that's why hmm
