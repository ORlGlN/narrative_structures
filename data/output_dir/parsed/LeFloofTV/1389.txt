your sausage off all right
then roll them into the thing look if
you made a grease that comes awesome as
mentals even though their grills that
they're not you know they're not fried
or anything it's still this is why I
always do just like squish them a little
bit that's my little trick second ago

so Jonathan just Jonathan is like my
savior right now because he just gave me
a little bit of a break so that I could
get ready and Amelia at one point
Amelia and Eduardo so weird to say his
name on the vlog um we're both crying
and I was just like oh my god and I
could hear them and I felt so guilty but
I have friends coming over to visit me
so I just I wanted to he wasn't do a
fused to a feet now so I have to kind of
hurry this up but um so he wasn't do a
feed so I was like okay I'm just gonna
run up and take my shower and everything
and I did that um so I love Jonathan
right now but Amelia just pooped and she
came running in with her nappy that's
the first time she's ever done that like
she's
ever told me to change her nappy before
amazing we change your nappy yeah we're
here two seconds she's already falling
in a big pot of mud Hey all right none
of you should run into the grainy stuff
what is that
sweetheart is it that's like sweetheart
hi hi guys Howdy's there already added
lads oh you mean the brothers in through
Morden no so my friend just came over
with her two kids and they dropped over
a little Prezi for Eduardo hmm so I'm
just sitting I feel like the worst host
in the world though like people come
over and like I'm not getting off
they're not allowing me to get off or
make anything or offer them anything and
I just feel like such a terrible
terrible hosts I'm just sitting here on
my bum while other guests are offering
me things in my own house but Jonathan
is taking quite a while do not realize
he was gonna be gone for so long
alright so um I figure that I'm gonna go
into a florists here I'm gonna get Ana a
big bunch of flowers because I think she
deserves a present a little a little
present huh a little push present though
they call those things a push present
you know like she went in there like a
trooper took everything
push that another amazing baby and then
she left the hospital like the next day
within 24 hours of giving birth she was
gone back at home like op she's like
going around the house and doing errands
and I'm just like you're a trooper a
super trooper so I figure she's not
expecting it at all so I was like you
know what you saying here today she's
like I think yesterday we're talking
about and she's like oh she's joking
like I didn't get a push present you
know thank you for hug
house it is you put spread she's like
now I understand like and you know I was
a joke and I don't want when you know so
it's totally out of her head now she's
getting anything so I figure now uh and
you're em em em hello hey McFly that's
great
you're supposed to help me friend I
don't know is today the baby blues day
or is it tomorrow I think it might be
tomorrow because I'm so far I'm not
emotional like at all so I think it's
tomorrow that those baby blues emotions
kick in the hormones the day I think
it's called like the day three blues or
something like that it's just when you
get really super emotional so I think
for me that would be tomorrow and pretty
short so we've ordered the flowers

kind of Rick's clothes I gotta know what
the word I always called a shipwreck I
guess that's like shipwrecked clothes
like worn or ripped clothes I don't like
new clothes
you're gonna look after the baby you can
occur after the baby all right
see it's a double stroller isn't it you
gonna look after your brother
scented wardo you say baby Eduardo look
at the color of him he's old dark
compared to Amelia and Reno is so dark
when she was born
that's because her heritage is French
Irish and Italian but then she was born
and raised in Ireland that's what
happened
that's where I went wrong this is the
Irish tone Irish skin is kind of blue I
mean it's really really sunny we go
white and after a long long time and
eventually goes red the only way to get
the o-neders at an Irish person is that
it comes from a bottle that's the only
way
he's like Bianca it's like a little
smarter okay hold on a second
