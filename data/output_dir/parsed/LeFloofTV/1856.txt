plus much did you see me text last night
they were brilliant of texting Emma and
has text in an old mat as well and she
was telling me knock-knock jokes
the Christmas spirit brings up business
very good
dropping those two off now I have to go
get Emma's present or present because
I'm getting her a secret sneaky present
because I noticed she mentioned as ages
ago that she'd really like this and I
just basically put her off the idea of
getting them for that like in the boom
perfection Christmas present OHS you
guys can come with me on an adventure of
a lifetime make a big part of it was
closed off and I was totally banking on
next anyways we find something to go
underneath and she's awake grumpy so
it's between these I really like this
because it's like very festive and it's
red I want her in this but then there's
this dress I prefer this dress but this
I think would be more striking with the
red so I don't know so try to decide and
also have them in different colors but
the cardigans but I think the red is the
nicest we have two options we have this
with the little shirt onesie type thing
on this dress or we have this top this
dress so I don't know
oh my god the rainbow is right there oh
my god a rainbow on Christmas Eve what
does that mean leprechaun alright Anna's

it is I hope he loves it I think you are
so we're looking for Amelia again
because dofus is hope so we're going to
get her some tights for Christmas I
can't even remember what colors like
what my god I think this would have to
be match the blue dress maybe red
I think yeah it's too big I'm trying to
find the rate you wanna get her
everything one for your wife is one
thing for your wife's sisters that's a
whole different game that is because I
know her the most but Emma was like I
can't shoot whenever I buy her she has
to bring a with her back to Bonn in
Germany you know I say get her something
stammering with her about the bomb but
that's kind of crowd
I just sent anima taxes like him to
haircare I suggested a curling iron but
all I can find there's a one is a one
and an arm the same thing I would think
an iron is like fluffy and flex
straightening her hair for the one iron
is not for straightening their hair this
is all very confusing
