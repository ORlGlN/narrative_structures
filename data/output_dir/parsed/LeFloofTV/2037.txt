comments now right today of who do you

we'd have to look at our defining
features is that how you tell well yeah

look like my grandparents on my dad's
side which is on the Frank side and then
you've got my mom's family which is the
Irish side yeah yeah but my sister's
baby looks more like her
I think oh no I think she looks like her
he looks like really okay hey I'm
worried about the dill stir um I think
it can looks like me yeah everyone
always says he looks like Simon book
Viking I think it's because he's a boy
yeah I think he's gonna hurt I know
people will probably see different
things in the vacation I know they come
out one way looking like something and
then they eventually more
I think that's I think that's an
interesting thing that they come out
looking like they're the mother
therefore the motor doesn't dispose of
it keeps it something to do with when we
were back in the day it was something
but that was before we had the
intelligence subconscious that would
allow us to differentiate between that
but we look at it and go oh there is
something to do with that wanna be so
cute
yeardley need more keys ah even a fun
name we should totally do that
you should bring Cena up tomorrow next
time she's in heat we'll make some more
keys whereas ireland's never going into
heat again goodness sake there's even a
report on M or T News last night where
they're saying that Irish farming
Association are concerned because of the
bad weather I'm like yeah exactly
that's let's work together on these guys
we should build a biodome leave me
comment you start filling with Pauly
Shore call biodome three years ago is
awesome
they only had to without them
don't you have to a puppy that's crazy
when you do find out if you find out
sometimes done this is cheaper than hi
scones in francesco super nuns but then
super value is cheaper than buns but
then super one has a tree at him mister
all work together although under be no
deals you know what
they last a month don't they yeah
there's only two more now once just by
two and that's it you're done
Aaron isn't it that's it like it's your
second last pack you're ever gonna bite
Oh after yeah you don't get like
postnatal and just um no isn't that
crazy but I just said they're for the
entire year yeah I can
oh well then forget us forget my analogy
what a media's gonna get what she's
gonna help me in the garden do my
gardening okay i'm melia when it is I
know but those before I realized I was
having a baby
only recently I've actually realized I'm
having a baby before I just thought it
was I don't know a joke sweet and mush
Oh God
sweet ones and that's one oh yeah my
stupid I know I like it I'll take it how
many here I'm only here to push this
thing around you're in charge of picking
out things telling me where to go what
to put in it cause we're gonna try to
weaken you again this is crazy and it's
probably not gonna work but we are going
to master this apparently someday
sometime in our life oh yes it is
we have a plan everything's plan that
this has got to work
think of our child for the sake of our
child knees what are they
she peppers ooh the one in award hmm
better clean I said yeah yum-yum
yom-yom bubblegum this area particularly
koruba my trophies
those is call is like a tease my
sorrowful actually
yeah yeah
yeah I need to fray euros let's get to
that
they were kind of crap I must admit I
was not impressed with the saucy Fish
Company you let yourself down
you've only yourself to blame so why
don't we just move on today come in
roaster they're ready they look ready to
eat oh no I need open 20 minutes in the
oven okay we get to before - he saved
two euros if you get - is there is there
room in there for ya do it nice that was
good at good negotiation so we decided
to crack open Breaking Bad last night
we decided after a long review and
everyone telling it was the best show in
the world ever we decided to finally
give it a go and we did and I concur
it's a pretty darn good show - episode 1
& 2 & 4 huh pretty good you know it's
amazing it matters for whole seasons to
watch and I think my brother watched it
he watched it Mia Santa Peters I did was
the new season coming soon really great
like he says it's it's so funny - father
I decided oh my god it's Malcolm's -
like the same kind of character just a
little bit more crazy with it but I'm
totally aware - Joe
I love you I love you I miss you not
just call me not just caught me not just
a I'm not joking
but he does us yeah yeah
mouths an egg and don't you cuss at me
huh okay passive me what does that mean
is that a a translation into something
kaskus does it mean like chuck rice the
students like is like diced up little
bits arise or something thank you
I'm just not a fan of the air of the
polonaise but what is the difference
guys between bolognese sauce and some
our own faeces this is tomato basil so
if this is an onion and essentially OB
bolognaise it's just like no that's
great great oh I wish upon a wishing
star that someday near that not so far
Tesco will stock tuna and peas for I
longed for it in my knees it should be a
port and I don't even know it oh
goodness me do you think Michael and
tomato sauce not the same
they're probably never gonna stock it
you know the sad date no they have it
here only race fish red rice did you
read that
what did you say that oh okay because I
was like did you need that part good
stuff
I don't even know what this stuff is so
I'm just gonna say is that what that is
oh it's this guy hello hello would you
like to buy my food I'll give you a kiss
yeah cuz I kind of run out quick like or
if you just you know I mean I always try
and buy them in bulk like trying to get
forty which is like twenty days so just
pile it on pile it on that's a problem
though within the big week shop it's
like oh my god it's seven billion euros
you think it's cheaper because the other
way you actually end up paying less each
time but in the long run and that to me
way more okay we are going to clean
what's this thing here complete oven
cleaner transform clears tackles inside
of an unbeatable result powerful few
easy you try this carefully place to
write screaming I was just gonna get
like the normal stuff like mister
muscles and stuff hard to want to get
this whole and includes a bag a bottle
and gloves
oh well that's stupid like yes - how
much does mr. muscle 299 whoa oh well
actually that's an oven cleaner that's
just a kitchen cleaner kitchen alright
let's do this this is going to be
exciting and unfun rolled into one
which one the blue the queen one or the
blue one non-bio file what the hell does
that mean my mom
to get money by oh okay well I love
ginger once into the skin rough on
sensitive skin this house me pretty much
I don't know the differences let's do it
oh look because we're a family
okay so that's about twenty years worth
of stuff I'd say this is just to stop
fighting cuz we talked it'll be enough
we got some shoes come on we'll get some
shoes
they'll probably be a fight about the
shoes now but I don't know okay fine
good enough er if she's getting the
shoes all right see how much this bad
boy is gonna call all right so we're
kind of halfway there and it's already
that much right keep on going the last
one
and the winner is oh my good
I'll press it the favori win it so
though he think 150 is like crazy you
know it works at what 21 euros a day so
21 euros a day you would definitely
spend more than that if you were to like
either or not even he air like obviously
probably real fact in a couple of events
in there like lunches and stuff like
that you know when I am to have all the
dinners and all the practices and
everything for a week like so I would
say even when Emilia is here I would say
it might be around 200 I mean she put on
you an add-on because she's not gonna
have that much food because you're gonna
yeah you know so 200 a week so 800 euros
a month on food and stuff yes all right
we should try and do one shop a month
that would never work oh my god imagine
trying to do that like 800 euro shop
wins a month like I'll be Craig Craig
right carry on home
so we have been delaying and not
delaying but like just procrastinating
on this so what back in when I felt
whenever I found it I was praying
January I got this whole pact with the
that after our first visit to something
someone someone registered us yeah I
think I was 12 weeks actually
so maybe yeah it wasn't when I first met
but I was like twelve weeks pregnant I
don't straight nope you're turning in
there you need to live here got it no
we're going use it Frank for you yeah
you used to live like janitor that's
very near I know it's not Frank feel at
its Grange I think if you had said to me
Baines I would it be more fun if I'm
feeling grained you're like right beside
anyways so I got this pack and with it
you get all this like stuff and like
magazines and information and everything
is actually really good what you do get
like you get a lot of information but
they gave me this which is it's with you
mom ie and it's basically a pack that
you get of like free stuff and like
supplies it's mostly like samples and
things like that but you do get like you
know Johnson's baby wipes and like
Dettol and sudo cream and all that kind
of stuff so it's just basically like a
little pack for your baby to kind of get
you started and it gives you information
as well on like child benefits and
but uh indeed free professional
photographs like I don't know just
really random stuff and I have just been
putting it off for ages because it's in
super value which we don't usually go to
