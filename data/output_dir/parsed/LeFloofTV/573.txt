I'm heading out to an appointment this
is actually one of my last appointments
of my psychologist because I'm I've been
finishing up with him for ages but I
used to go every week like last year I
was going every week and then we changed
it to every month because I don't really
need to go anymore but um he just likes
to check up on me or vice versa I need
to check in with him anyway it is like
not pouring rain but it's like pissing
like spitting rain probably better way
of saying it but I say pissing because
I'm Irish and I just had to put boots on
for the first time this season if that
makes sense um this year no not this
year since like summer has started I had
to put boots on person and I don't even
know if they go with this I just kind of
threw them on because like I was going
out in flats and I would have got soaked
so heading out I can't believe it's
raining I can't believe it's like this
because every other day was fine and
then today it just was like uh so yeah
Amelia's asleep on the sofa I'm gonna I
asked Jonathan because I'm going out to
ring the doctor because I don't know if
it's normal or not I think it is but
just to make sure cuz she's really got
no appetite and she's not eating
anything so just to make double sure
we're gonna ring the doctor
hello friends we're a little bit
concerned about Amelia so I'm gonna
bring her to visit the doctor very
shortly
