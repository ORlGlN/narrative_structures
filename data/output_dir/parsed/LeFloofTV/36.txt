know how dad you do some wrinkle look at
that little picture I always get a funny
picture the focuses look if they're
really funny like it
see fine
ok so I am back home I am absolutely
exhausted I know it was only half a day
of shooting and it wasn't probably as
like physically demanding as say a
photoshoot like what we did with benefit
recently I think because what we were
talking about was so emotional it was
just very like draining and I'm so
relieved that I wasn't the only one who
said that because Kat actually the girl
that I was filming with she said it at
the end like I'm God somebody else feels
like they're tired because I feel like
I'm always the one who's like I'm so
tired I'm so exhausted
and that's exactly what we were kind of
trying to do is just like break the
stigma and like stop it being so taboo
to talk about things like that our
experiences with eating disorders and I
had never ever met Kat before I think we
had been to parties maybe that were like
from like under our management where we
we'd be at the same party but we hadn't
actually like formally introduced each
other or anything and I was actually
just you know you never know how you're
gonna get on with somebody but I was so
happy to have met her in that kind of a
environment like that kind of a
situation because I felt like we got to
know so much about each other but we
also were so similar in a lot of ways
like our you know having that in common
having recovered from an eating disorder
and just like having that whole it's a
huge part of your life like no matter if
you kind of want to admit it or not and
it's something not it's like a huge
struggle that you've overcome so to have
that in common with somebody and to just
be able to talk candidly candidly with
somebody about it it's just there's
nothing like that to like bond oh you
know wond you wish bond over so I just
felt like it really um tying us together
I just feel like I need to recover
and go to bed early and you know keep
drinking Oh a nice drink water actually
because um I didn't actually drink any
at lunchtime so I definitely need to do
that I'm gonna go and get some water now
before I disintegrate I wanted to do
something I wanted my due date so I went
back and then the couch again
was reforged with a beat and a hole in
it or mosquitos mosquitos are in the
itches but I don't hop but being and
Hornets do hard and well they didn't see
it but I would be oh my goodness guys
look at this I'm gonna begin see right
there and I'll be the zoom in time but
you see that little sign in while Mama's
