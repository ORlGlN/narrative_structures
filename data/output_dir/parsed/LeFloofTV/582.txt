NOT that person that wears shirts or
that are tied up like it makes me feel
like I'm in school like with a time you
know we're supposed to go to London for
a meeting but then we the trades are
like messed up right now like it is the
most awkward thing ever because you look
at your phone and it gives you a
completely different timetable to the
actual timetable like my phone is giving
me a timetable for London Bridge and
then we went there and there was no loan
for trade at all didn't exist because of
strikes and then there was like if
there's fewer other trains and it's just
a mess so we couldn't make it so now we
just spent the past like half an hour
when yeah or maybe try to figure out how
if we could do like half the meeting
somewhere else
that's like a little bit closer to home
and now we think we figured out a
solution so we're now driving to
somewhere that's still like an hour ways
done we don't have enough fuel to get
there yeah but it's still closer
that makes them in London so you know
we'll see what actually happens and the
most annoying part of the m25 so noisy I
