oh my goodness look at you you're gonna
levitating towards it like if she's been
evil he's gone Evil's give me over I
know what you're doing here okay
my lovely family from how I like them to
today's rock and you have not a cell to
each other
I got Mitch your fan news babe I'm a fan
of those things all palpable directions
like no no that's not that big Oh
driving in the moment will be like every
time every single time Anna's got out
with Steve he's a pet your lights always
on because he always forget the
perpetual in the car
and then what he does he makes an ax and
go and put the petrol in the car you
know cuz it's good it's good practice I
suppose you know for it does not work
you know you know driving the car it's
not just about driving the cards no one
edge I supposed to look after itself and
I think nowadays the driving test they
make you do stuff like that you have to
know about how to put hair in a tire and
put water in the engine and check for a
while and it you know do a little small
maintenance stuff like that so she was
like hayswood picture in the dark I
don't want to do it so I'm like oh hey
look just I'll go down and I'll just
fill it up and then
you'll be done with it you know fish
then she took the good week now she's
gonna head in the road I think today
like it's like fully up in the road you
know and one of these days I say they're
like you know one of these days like
seems gonna just like get out of the car
but like off you pop you know it's like
now actually since I love using these
machines here the gas the gas
that's how much take 76 years fill this
time yeah okay so the first things first
is that I'm not putting in an awful lot
of pressure in the fact that it's not a
he a busy one all right and I nice you
lied Royals a little bit faster we're
gonna be gone fifty kilometers in the
main roads but there's not going an
awful lot of cars on the road either
okay so I'm just going to get nice big
circuits and there's a little random
adder up around here as well with these
as well but it's going to be very quiet
okay that's so into your gear one hum
breakers we're going to release that in
a second and this remember the last
place that you're gonna look before you
go
uh-huh that's the one excellent
exactly
perfect now in second gear just looking
straight forward when you're saying and
now you get a better idea where your
gears are now so we're just looking
obviously low forward numbers and often
ignores indigo for signal that we didn't
sing on it okay oh crap yeah it's okay
yeah okay your next gear again just keep
it straight over for
okay taking the left here as of checking
mirrors first signal to the left
breaking okay and through your three
still cover your right to your three
hoods ranking more now
and I tend to
wine if the curve they're going to stop
the convenience by my user closest yet
get in there stop there for me excellent
okay little bit back into one what's
going on what's going on huh mom has
gone so it's just us lads Oh volumes oh
whoops
sorry that was a mistake that was a
mistake
was it misunderstanding it's usually
when they're getting it excited fun time
that's the sound we are we staying a bit
hmm
and a mommy's gone nothing is going to
get done
no things my friends oh this my boys
oh my gosh
anybody have a bullet set something up
on this lens we're working on working to
anticipate well yes the next weekend me
and my brofist and 200 people we're
doing this a mountain biking thing up am
I know it's supposed to be Ireland's
best mountain biking course thing we're
just gonna like rent the bikes there
it's about an hour from the court I
think it's like two hours from Dublin
boy that's his birthday next weekend so
I was like to have the totes fun so I
think it's like like you know it's not
like cycling on the road it's like up in
the mountains and the bikes we get
enough like dual suspension some I don't
know anything about it but it sounds
like a lot of fun sounds like a lot of
exercise extra see sighs when am I could
definitely use it because you know since
Sorento I haven't done not that not that
piss effects the only bit of exercise
I've done is changing gear Oh Oh
actually wait a second I have a
Tiptronic automatic car so I suppose I
haven't even done laughs if you're just
doing this very even this because it's
an f1 trigger car so I can actually just
did it yeah nothing nothing has been
done and then you don't need go go to
the gym for a while you know the
exercise for a while and you get like
out of it and then you just like it's
hard you can go back and lie
my trainer first even rang me I was like
ah but I suppose it's great
that's brilliant my prepaid at the start
of the year anyway so I make me more
motivated to do it but I should get back
into it we should all get back into a
friend when I start ranking
that's okay I can to one now first is
ease off your touch bring in your
accelerator that's lovely
you didn't panic that's all good
and then maybe your flow stopped at the
line
right okay cool okay so I can go to full
circle here I'm going to come around
again I do the same thing so you're in
one already that's a little faster
as he does Paris will never trust an
indicator so yeah David
different way down the road awesome yeah
you want to go communal prepared for me
then right
okay
it's important that you get that look
left before you commit to that turn
because it could be sitting across the
road here next year

have to come into play now you know
