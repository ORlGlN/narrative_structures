AOA's popping - boy wolfy and welcome
back to more wolfy again the next day I
know I'm vlogging a lot today the plan
is Sylvia graduates I have to find a way
there but I don't have a car I just
called my mom to see where the car was
and she's telling me she's at the mall
and there's a massive sinkhole at the
mall so she can't give me the car and
then just as she said that DJ said this
picture in the group look I don't know
if you guys can see that but the
sinkhole in the back it is deep
as so I might have to over to go to
Sylvia's graduation I wanted to pick her
up like a cake ah like a graduation like
happy graduation cake but now I don't
think I can do that unless I can find a
way to get a car
so yeah I don't know how I'm gonna do
that but I'm just downloading you music
right now it's it's my priority
literally I'm like so behind on
music because when I get like into the
swing of things like I've been grinding
on YouTube so I haven't been downloading
music and so there's so many new songs
like Travis Scott Drake drop some new
 there's a remix of Justin Bieber
chants and Justin Bieber
holy like he just makes you wanna
go
okay Loki I'm freaking out because I've
looked everywhere in my room and I can't
find my wallet I don't know where it
would have been though like I always put
it at the same places when I leave my
room
so hey who but who are these white
original bagels you never see the
in my house we never have bagels and yo
one weird thing about my house we never
actually have milk we only have almond
milk the unsweetened kind so whenever
anyone comes to my house
they're always cheese that
there's no actual milk Wow look at this
setup look at this setup isn't here no
no no should be there honestly I'm
a goof it's a my back
pocket you know of cheese literally like
I coulda sworn a check there you
know when you think you checked like a
place and it's not there so you're just
like not that it's too obvious
it's not in my back pocket literally I
always do that with my phone it's in my
hand and I'm like where the fuck's my
phone and then you have that split
second where you like panic but my
phone's in my hands I don't know
that that feeling is the worst
Cleo this is my cat in the morning she
always comes to my bed come here why
she's gonna follow me two seconds two
seconds Cleo
why are you acting like you don't love
me on blog hmm get off my chair you want
to download music for me you can
download music for me so I need to get
food before this graduation starts and I
don't think the cars gonna be back for a
minute I just checked on Twitter and
like that sinkhole is like everyone
in that mall is not going and I'm all
for like I guess the next hour minimum
so and sorry for the wind guys I didn't
buy like one of the wind mufflers
muscaria but I'm power walking to Subway
to get food so that I might even sent
jogging nobody missed that jogging so
that I can get food or at least some
food to hold me over until after the
graduation ceremony because I don't have
a car
cannot go grab a cake or anything like
that I didn't want to over to go grab a
cake over to the graduation ceremony and
let it melt I wanted to grab it go back
to my house and give it to her later but
you know I called her and asked her but
if she doesn't even want to go to her
grad so it doesn't matter we are going
to be going out to get like all you can
eat Chinese food after at this place

forward to that okay the uber should be
