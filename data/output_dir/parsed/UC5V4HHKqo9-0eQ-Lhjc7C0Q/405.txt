hey yo what's poppin it's your boy wolfy
welcome back to more wolfy so I just got
off the phone with my dad and he told me
there's this website where you can
basically see what different types of
rims look like on your car
it's called tire calm so right now I'm
in the car about to head over to the
place to go scout out rims for the car
and basically I'm just looking at what
different things would look like on my
car so I'm gonna do that and then I
think I'm gonna head to the peel box cuz
I actually called me back this morning
and apparently the girl can switch the
key finally so hopefully and she seemed
really nice over the phone I think it
was the girl who like initially gave me
the PIO box so she's like yeah I
remember you like we'll get it fixed
today hopefully so just swing by later
so hopefully all that goes well because
and that's two things that I did and
it's a productive ass day for me let's
go cheat my brothers in town Hey I don't
know that more wolfy I was the first
subscriber he was the first to say that
every single so yeah we're just
gonna go out around we don't really have
a plan other than that today and see
what happens in the store we got some
stuff up here
bunch of stuff so just waiting to figure
out what I'm gonna do with my car see
the options stuff like that swag on hmm
no this one's nice for sure so I got at
least three of car yeah that was baby
guy's crazy we're just sitting in the
car shop and David's dad is on the front
cover of this magazine shout out to my
boy David alright guys so I just dropped
off my car at the spot basically the guy
was really helpful we picked out some
rims together in some tint hopefully I
don't get pulled over because there's
like a limit of tint front windows can
only be so tinted before the cops
they're just like getting annoying and
always pulling you over because they
can't see who's driving the car cuz
they're that dark but basically I got
nice rims and a nice tint and it should
be ready by tomorrow like early
afternoon so that was way easier than I
thought especially because I went in
there not knowing anything about car
but the guy was helpful but the cashier
kind of cheese me because she was some
lady and the first thing she said was
you're so tall
like do you play basketball I looked I
was like shaking my damn head
hey this is what I'm gonna do I may go
back to work would get something I need
then I'm gonna come home and get my
lunch as you see this party one day one
day like I have my car no I should have
my car for two days and then I drop it
off because I need stuff done to it and
already my mom's telling me what I need
to have her car around for this is why I
got my own car you guys see the struggle
all right guys you know what it is if
we're down in my area and we're hungry
for food you've got to go to burrito
gringo because we with it and we
don't have a Chipotle in Ottawa so it's
like the next best actually I think it's
better because it gives more of
everything but Ryan's about to do
something watch that broke people do
okay this guy loves the same as money
he's gonna attempt to ask her as much
extra stuff as possible and we'll see
how much you get so hopefully it's a lot
I just get what they give me I don't
really care
when I get meat I usually get to half
chicken half beef or half half chicken
half pulled pork and it's like usually
the best so if you guys are going
always get mixed don't get one because
then you get two flavors and it's always
better than one grease bomb on
poor - your buddy do you want lots right
don't make it extra raise this guy's
asking for extra extra rice yeah you got
extra what balls
it's just salsa all right so guys Ryan
actually successfully got extra watch
how would you get extra what extra right
yeah extra race in salsa
yeah and lettuce no cheese me so he got
that the the stuff that's not essential
that they're just like yeah just give
him it I got a full you know good whole
TV TV me and Ryan are gonna attempt
something I've never attempted I'm gonna
try and do some low-key meet up today so
I'm just gonna go to some Park even
though kids are in school right now I'm
gonna go to some Park and snapchat I was
saying yo I'll be here for an hour if
anyone wants to swing by and say hi
say what's good then I'll be there if
you guys want to bring me a nice cap
because it's a hot day you know you
should bring us both ice caps I got

like a donut or something just bring us
something argue please

that oh but basically we'll be at the
park for an hour
like I said kids are gonna be in school
so hopefully someone shows up if not
