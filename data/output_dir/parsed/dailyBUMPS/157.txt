-  This is the little kid area.
That's so cool!
Whoa!
-  Here goes daddy.
Say, "You got it daddy! Get it, get it!"
- You got it daddy, get it, get it!
We are family.
-  We are family.
(laughs)
- We are a tribe!
So Jack is gonna watch us
now, play our little game.
We have a special game we've
been saving for the boys
for Halloween time.
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
(upbeat music)
- Good morning!
- We are getting breakfast this morning,
and the whole restaurant is
decked out in Halloween stuff.
(Oliver yells)
Whoa, it does?
-  Can you see it from there?
-  Yeah, they have
these really freaky pictures
that are like changing faces,
and the boys are freaking out
- Kind of scary.
-  Yeah, what do
you think about that Ollie?
- I'm not scared of anything.
- You're not?
I would say that, yes, Ollie is not afraid
of a lot of things, but
food is one of them.
- Yeah, for sure.
- It's almost like every time we go
to a restaurant it's like going to a
haunted maze.
- I'm not hungry.
- Yeah, "I'm not hungry.
"Nope, I don't need to go in there.
"No it's okay."
I'm like, "It's not a
haunted house, buddy."
(Missy laughs)
-  Finn, are you stacking?
- Yeah.
-  Here, keep stacking.
- Here Finn, I will help you stack.
-  Yeah, Ollie will help you.
-  Can we get a couple ...
(groaning)
(upbeat music)
(Bryan laughs)
-  That's a cool pumpkin huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, are you
excited to carve your pumpkin?
- Yeah.
- We just had an amazing
breakfast and now we are
actually gonna drop Finley
off at Mimi and Papa's.
And we are gonna do
some fun rock climbing.
(upbeat music)
Alright, we are now at the rock gym doing
some rock climbing, and
Ollie is joining us.
This is the little kid area.
We're kinda bummed cause he can't
do a harness and climb up.
That's so cool.
Whoa!
- Was like a superhero.
- Ollie, dude you're like a superhero.
-  Okay now do it but
only touch the yellow ones.
Only use the yellow ones.
-  Oh, its a good
color learning exercise.
Like, learn colors while rock climbing.
Only yellow, Ollie!
There you go.
(upbeat music)
He is such a cool kid.
He just has so much determination.
Can the people who own this gym just see
that our son is four years old
and this is not good enough for him.
He has to wait two years
before he can climb on these.
- I know, there's some really easy walls.
-  Oh, I know.
- You know what though?
I think I know what the problem is.
When we were at the other place,
when he went to jump,
it didn't even go down.
-  Oh yeah.
(laughs)
- We basically had to pull him down.
-  Yeah, 'cause
he doesn't weigh enough.
I love all the little
letters and stuff too.
(upbeat music)
Whoa!
-  God, that's scary.
- You're crazy, kiddo.
All right, we are gonna get,
I'm trying to see if I can
do a couple of runs here.
I don't really rock climb, so.
- It's hard the first time.
You really have to, I don't know.
Even one run will just
make your arms cramp.
- Yeah (laughs).
I'm excited though to get up there.
I did a little bit and then my heart
started beating really fast,
'cause I was getting really high
I was like, "Oh, I think
I'm afraid of heights."
- Yeah it's scary at first.
Especially when you have to jump.
-  Yeah (laughs).
Look at this kid.
(upbeat music)
- Bryan's about to do his very first run.
- I can probably go all
the way up physically,
but mentally, I don't know if I can.
-  I know.
- Might be jumping off right there.
-  No, you can
do it, you can do it.
(Ollie murmuring)
-  Yeah?
Here goes daddy.
Say, "You got it daddy!
"Get it, get it!"
- You got it daddy, get it, get it!
Get it, you can do it!
(Missy laughs)
We are family.
-  We are family.
(laughing)
- We are a tribe!
Right Ollie?
-  Yeah.
♫ We can do it
♫ We are a family
♫ We are a tribe
♫ We've got shields
♫ We've got each other
♫ Let's do this
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
(Bryan yelps)
-  Really?
- It's so high up there, babe.
-  Oh my goodness!
- I think I'm seriously afraid of heights.
I think I am.
(Missy laughs)
Corbin's here.
He's gonna start doing some climbing.
Missy's doing the wall
just to show how much
better she is than me.
-  Only the blue.
-  Only blue?
-  Yeah.
- She's amazing you, guys.
(laughs)
I feel like I have a whole family
of people who aren't afraid of anything,
and I'm afraid of heights.
Hey Ollie, look at Mom up there!
Isn't that's so cool?
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
You did it?
Last blue?
♫ Live it forever
Good job, babe.
Good little workout.
- My arms are already cramped up.
("Tribe" by Bryan Lanning)
- You guys I'm officially a mall creep.
Checking out this hottie
shop in the window.
(laughs)
She's looking at shoes for some costumes
she's gotta wear this month.
We actually have a 1920s themed party
we're going to tomorrow night also.
So I had to get a couple of things at H&M
like hats and jackets, and
we gotta go find a vest
and stuff for me also
so that I look the part.
So we've been trying to get
some shopping done at the mall,
and the boys are just beyond bored.
What are you guys doing?
(laughing)
Are you bored?
Tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle!
- Alright, we just got home.
We have had a crazy day.
We've been shopping.
We have--
- I told Missy I closed
all my activity rings
on my Apple watch just shopping today.
- We're exhausted!
But we really were trying to catch up
on a few things that we needed
because we have some fun upcoming parties
and things like that.
I am super blue right now
because I'm standing in
front of the fish tank!
And we are feeding our fish
right now, and they are happy.
Look at him!
Should we name him?
-  Should we name him?
-  Look at our tank is green,
and that's what it's supposed to be.
- Yeah, it means that
it's cycling really good.
And actually I get to scrape it all off,
and they eat it all and they love it.
- So neat.
You can see it over there.
That's so neat.
Look at, even Kai's coming out!
We had the other day, we
asked you guys for ideas
on what we should name this
big fish guy that we got.
He's really, really cool.
So if you can't tell
he got tons of colors.
He's got blue, orange, yellow.
- Look at, he's coming out.
He's like, "Oh hey!"
- Black.
He's really cool-looking.
And a few people left the comment
that they think we should name him Rafiki.
- So! We were thinking of
letting you guys decide
if we should name him Rafiki or Dude.
'Cause I literally just
call him Dude all the time,
and I feel that he responds to it now.
-  He's a very
surfer dude looking guy.
- So what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna do an iCard poll,
which we've never done
on this channel yet.
So, when you're watching this video,
click the iCard in the corner,
and there should be a little poll there.
And you can choose whether you think
we should name him Rafiki or Dude.
-  'Kay! Are you Rafiki or Dude?
What's your name?
(laughs)
Look at that! Getting all clean!
(whimsical music)
- I'm Jack!
(Bryan laughs)
- Hey Ollie, who's on the pumpkin?
- Jack Skellington!
-  That's right!
We got our Jack Skellington
pumpkin complete!
Finn's favorite word
is Halloween right now.
Right?
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, so now that Jack
Skellington is complete,
which by the way, buying a white pumpkin
was way better than painting one, right?
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, so Jack is gonna watch us now
play our little game.
We have a special game we've been saving
for the boys for Halloween time.
I'm a leave Jack right there.
He's got a good view.
Alright boys!
The name of the game is
Operation Nightmare
Before Christmas Edition!
We've got your bad guy Oogie Boogie here,
and inside of him are all of these bugs.
No, don't touch, don't touch!
We're playing Operation, so
you're gonna draw a card.
It's gonna tell you which one to grab,
and then you gotta grab it out of here.
And if you touch the sides
Ollie, you get shocked.
- All right, the first
person who gets to go first
is the biggest Nightmare
Before Christmas fan.
Who's the biggest Nightmare
Before Christmas fan?
- Whose the biggest fan in the house?
- I kinda think it's Ollie!
Do you love The Nightmare Before
Christmas more than daddy?
Yeah?
-  You wanna go first?
- Just did it.
(whimsical music)
- All right Ollie, you get to go first.
Draw a card and figure out
which one you have to pull out.
All right it says, "Clubbed foot.
"Oogie's leg is shaking hard.
"Play your hand and remove the cards."
(gasps) Can you do it?
-  Alright Ollie.
Use the tweezers and try
to get the clubbed foot!
All right Dr. Ollie!
Let's get that clubbed
foot out of Oogie Boogie.
(whimsical music)
-  Almost, almost!
(yelling and laughing)
What happened?
-  He got it the second try!
-  He got it!
- Good job Ollie, you did it!
- Good job, dude!
- You get a thousand dollars!
-  A thousand dollars?
How many toys can you buy with
a thousand dollars, Ollie?
- Maybe I can get two of them!
(Missy laughs)
-  Maybe two toys, yes.
- All right Finn, it says,
"In order to get Oogie's voice back,
"extract the creepy little bat."
It says, "Bat's got your tongue."
-  Bat's got
your tongue right here.
We gotta get that bat outta there.
Can you use the tweezers?
-  Can you get the
bat out with the tweezers?
(Finn shrieks)
Ah, you lost!
-  You lost!
- You gotta get it out like that.
You wanna try again?
You gotta squeeze it like this.
-  Go ahead, try again!
(Finn shrieks)
(Bryan laughs)
-  Oh, wow!
(Bryan and Missy laugh)
-  He's using alternative
medicine, this doctor.
-  Here Finn, I'll help you, Finn.
-  All right Ollie, you help him.
Good job, Ollie!
- Good job!
- All right, next up, boys.
We're getting the scorpion
sting for 300 bucks.
Oogie's life is on the line for sure.
Prevent the sting to find the cure.
Should I get it?
Oh my gosh, this is so hard.
Okay.
Oh, I did it!
- Got it.
- Here you go, see?
That's a scorpion.
I just pulled it out of Oogie Boogie.
- Good job.
(laughs)
He always puts them back.
It says, "To stop Oogie
from feeling antsy,
"remove the worms to suit his fancy."
Crawling flesh for $300.
-  All right, crawling flesh!
Let's get that out of him.
Careful, careful, Mama!
(shrieks)
She did it!
A little sloppy.
A little sloppy on the
exit, but that's okay.
Oogie's dead.
-  All right, Ollie's turn again!
(Oogie yelling)
(Finn shrieks)
(Oogie laughing and yelling)
-  His bugs! His bugs!
- Got it!
- She did it!
You ready?
(Finn shrieks)
I just like seeing his reaction.
Okay, let's actually try to get it.
Spider veins!
(shrieking and laughing)
He's bleeding out!
Doctor, doctor!
All right Finn, get the
needle and thread right there.
(yelling)
(whimsical music)
And Dr. Ollie is the winner!
Congratulations, dude.
He is actually a lot better at this game
than I thought he would be.
- I know. I'm glad.
'Cause I feel like we've tried
to play a game like this in the past,
and he was like, "I don't get it."
- And Operation is a classic.
I used to play this all the time
when I was a kid with the actual doctor.
His nose would light up.
It was super cute.
