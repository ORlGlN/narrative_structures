- Good morning!
(Finley babbling)
♪This is our life. Let's
live it. Live it forever. ♪
- Good morning guys! Finn
is watching Daily Bumps
on an iPad. Aren't you Finn?
Are you watching Ollie?
- Yeah
- Yeah and Finn and Mama and Dada?
- Yeah
- Yeah. It's just been one of those days.
I'm getting work done and
trying to clean and Ollie's
actually at school so
Finn's super bored and
so I was like, "Finn, just watch a show
while I clean up and
that is what he's doing
and he's actually being really good.
I think he's tired. I think
it's time for his nap.
But yeah, I think he's about
to go crazy any minute here.
Luna Loo, that is not your toy!
Drop that right now! Drop that right now!
Drop it. Drop it. Drop it. Luna, drop it!
Okay, thank you. She's like, "It's just so
fun to play with." I
think this is the boys'.
- So this video is sponsored by Alice
so special thanks to Alice for sponsoring
today's video. I'm trying to
find Missy right now though.
- Shh! I'm trying to hide from the boys
so I can play this cool game
I just found called Alice.
(pops and chimes)
Yes!
The game is beautiful and
just so much fun to play.
I found it in the app store.
You can also get it on
Google Play and it reminds me
of my favorite tale, Alice.
The goal is to get the last
figure, which is obviously Alice
while placing figures on the field.
While matching these figures together
I got a cute little sheep.
(pops and chimes)
I just matched the dog to make this cute
little rabbit, the March Hare.
Look at his glasses!
What's cool about this game is
there's lots of different opportunities.
The app is brand new,
so if you download it
within the first month,
you get ten balloons
which will boost your game a ton.
All you need to do is
download the app Alice
by clicking the link down below
and then connecting it to your Facebook.
Ooh, I just got a cute little mouse.
I wonder what the next figure is gonna be.
-  Bryan, what are you doing?
- I'm leaving.
-  No, don't leave us!
- Yup, I've had enough with you.
I've had enough with the
kids. I'm outta here.
- And just so you know, that is not
enough room for my stuff.
- Yeah, I'm going on a trip on my own.
-  Yup
- No kids, no wife
- It's not our vacation yet. If you guys
don't know, yesterday we announced that we
are going on a little trip and it's
going to be our first real vacation
but this is not that trip.
- No, this is a work trip.
- I'm actually going to San
Francisco just overnight.
I have a couple meetings at YouTube
the fancy website you're
watching this video on
- And I am making some lunch. It's going
to be so sad that Bryan is leaving
but I am also really excited about them
It's such an honor that they're
inviting him out for these meetings.
I'm just really excited that
he gets to be a part of them.
I am gonna make food because I'm so hungry
and I know Finn's hungry and
I know Bryan's hungry too.
So I am running into school to grab Ollie.
All the boys have haircuts today
and so I'm grabbing Ollie and
meeting Bryan at the salon
and of course this one is fast asleep.
So I'm going to quickly put him into this.
Hopefully he stays asleep because
he definitely needs the nap and then
we are going to head
to get a haircut. Shh!
Alright, got him in and he's fast asleep.
Success! Let's go get Ollie.
(lullaby music)
-  Hey dude, how was school?
- Good.
-  Good and did
you have a good share day?
You shared your triceratops.
So, what was the letter?
- T
-  T, yeah, and were
you able to draw the T?
- Yeah
-  Good I'm so proud of you.
Did they all like your triceratops?
- Yeah
-  Good. Alright, let's
go head to get a haircut.
- Haircut
-  Yay! Alright, the real test
is getting him back in his
seat without waking up.
Think mama can do it?
-  Mmhmm
-  Okay
(lullaby music)
Shh. Close your eyes.
Close your eyes. Shh.
Alright, Finn, close your eyes, baby. Shh.
- Mama
- Well, that didn't go terribly
but could have been better.
- Alright, boys, where are we headed?
- We're heading to our haircut.
- Yay! It's haircut day.
These boys love haircut day.
We're walking in now, and
they're actually in pretty
good moods for just
waking up from naps, huh?
Did you sleep good at school?
- Yeah
- Good, alright, they are so
excited to see Travis, huh?
-  Yeah
-  Yeah
(upbeat music)
-  I don't know
what happened there.
He just decided to start
crawling up the stairs.
Did you get too tired?
- Yeah
-  Sometimes Mama
feels like she needs
to crawl up the stairs too. Daddy's here!
- I'm here!
-  Ollie, did you miss Daddy?
- Yeah
- He still barely fits in my arms.
-  Aww so cute.
Ollie was asking about you
and he was like, "I can't get a
haircut unless Daddy's with me."
- Aww, yeah
- You need Daddy here, huh?
You excited to see Dada?
- Yeah
- There he is, huh.
- Yeah
(upbeat music)
- You like my haircut?
- Yeah
- Yeah? Dada's gotta go, so I'm
gonna see you tomorrow, okay?
- Okay
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah
- Okay. I love you,
Finn. I love you, Ollie.
- Love you too
- Listen to Mama, okay?
- Okay
- Will you FaceTime me
tonight? Yeah? Okay.
- Gotta say goodbye
- I gotta go. I literally
have to finish packing
and then the car's gonna pick
me up in a half hour or so.
-  Yup. Alright.
- Alright, bye boys. Have
a good haircut, okay?
- Okay
- Love you
- Love you
(upbeat music)
- That length's cool?
-  Woo!
(Missy laughs)
- Are you ready?
- Yeah
- Yeah
- Do you love haircut day?
- Yeah!
(upbeat music)
-  Look at how
handsome these boys are!
Look at your haircuts. Yours
looks very cool, Ollie.
Look at you! Very handsome, Finn.
Look at that little pose.
You guys ready to go home?
- Yeah
-  Alright, you guys did so good.
You got your suckers and I
even grabbed a couple candles
that smell amazing, which
Bryan will be excited about
but we gotta get home. I think there's
quite a bit of traffic
so that should be fun.
So we are all done with haircuts and
it's actually getting pretty late
but I just had to come up and see Nacho.
Trying to decide if I have time to
saddle him and ride him for a minute but
I was wanting to come up here earlier
but we were just super
busy so now I'm gonna go
see him and they're going
to hang out and play.
You guys gonna play?
- Yeah
- 'Kay. Oh, hey boys.
- Hey
- Are you hiding from Billy?
They are both so scared
of Billy 'cause Billy
does tend to headbutt them
because they're the same size.
He doesn't really like kids, I guess
So I locked him in here while I get Nacho.
You guys being good?
- Yeah
- Alright, I gave Nacho a little ride
but we didn't vlog anything.
Are you guys freezing cold?
- Yeah
- It's so cold and Nacho's
got his blanket and he's good
for the night. Night Nacho!
-  How does horses sleep?
-  How do they sleep?
-  Yeah
-  That's actually a
good question. Do they lay down?
- They do. Some do.
-  Some do and some just
stand and close their eyes.
- Most of them stand.
Really, I've walked in
on Asher a few times laying down.
-  Have you ever stood
and slept while standing?
- Yeah
-  No that would be so silly, huh?
- Maybe they are sleepwalking
-  Yeah, they
basically just sleepwalk, huh?
- Alright we are home
and you ate your dinner
- Yay
- And we are all ready for bed.
Mimi and Papa are over and I think I'm
actually going to make them some dinner
But we're going to go
ahead and end the vlog
because actually I do not have a computer
Bryan took the computer with
him and I actually don't
own a computer so I have
to use my mom's computer
to send Bryan footage so I'm
going to go ahead and end
this video so that I can
send footage on her computer.
Alright, well, we're going
to go ahead and end the video
so make sure you give it a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed it.
Say, "thumbs up!" Oh,
there it is down there.
And we will see you guys
tom- oh, you know what
I was going to say I think
I've owned this shirt for
as long as we've been
vlogging or longer than
we've been vlogging so
bonus points if you can find
the first vlog that I
ever wore this shirt in.
I would not be surprised if
it's our very first vlog.
I really think I've had this
shirt for a long, long time
and I just thought about it
because I was like, "We've been
vlogging for five years.
Have I had this shirt
for five years?" Let me
know down in the comments.
We'll see you guys tomorrow. Bye!
- Bye!
-  Boop
