Yo guy what's up and welcome to the ultimate shooting challenge.
We are going to find out who's the best finisher is.
Right foot, left foot and then volley,
but first JJ, you are going to finish that, go on.
FINISH!
OH!
Yeah, you guy said we don't have good goalies.
Right, round one.
Paint me like one of your french men.
Right foot, it's got to be within the D, alright.
Ooooooooohh.
Arghhhh damn it Ethan.
Arghhhhhhhhhh.
Alright imma, imma just pass it in.
Imma just pass it.
Arghhh no Ethan.
It's a lot different when there's pressure on you.
Go on!
Oh my...
Well that was the worst round ever.
Hit me baby!
One more time.
FUS RO DAH!
Okay.......
What is that?
Oh?!
Arghhhh.
(Laughter)
Yes Ethan!
Last go is it?
Oh my god. Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Bye have a great time.
This is tough.
Yeah Mill wall can do this, who is passing it to me.
Me.
One touch and?
Ah no!
Mill, MILL!
It's always in the middle, right, ok.
Right, honestly, how did we win a football match?
Callux.
(laughter)
The **** is this?!
Yeah we're better from like the halfway line aren't we.
**** off!
Easy
Oh my god, Oh my god!
Now we have the second most subscribed Manny on Youtube.
There's one touch and...
Oh there we go.
Ethan come on!
Yes Ethan!
Good save.
One touch, AND!
Go on Vikk!
The touch!
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
See that was part of my plan.
Maybe if I aim for the crossbar.
ARGHHHH.
OH. MY. GOD.
Do not let that in!
Yes Ethan!
NOT IN MY HOUSE!
Alright, keeper vibes.
NO!
NOOOOOO!
I'm going back in there.
Round two, left foot.
This isn't gonna go too well.
Alright left foot.
He's got one already.
Oh, you so almost let that in!
Lovely.
Wind it up, wind it up.
Winding it up.
I don't know what this is.
Here we go.
Finish me.
Oh there's the touch.
This is so slow.
What happened to go slow?
Yo I have no left foot.
What the **** was that?!
It's not a passing challenge!
The goalie's mugging you off.
He's passing the ball.
Yes yes.
Ohhhh
Can we vote for JJ to leave the sidemen?
Sidemen referendum.
Oh god.
Can we say he has a right foot if he didn't score?
That was alright.
NO come on!
Go on josh!
**** off get out of goal!
Not in my house!
Oh he's flicked it up!
It's in!
Arghhhh
Lets see Mannys' left foot.
Oi that was quickness.
Oh I like this
I was predicting that he was going there.
Last go Manny, can he make it two?
HE, doesn't.
I'm not entirely sure my left foot can actually kick that far.
Oh this is gonna be atrocious.
Hey, wait, that reached.
I don't have.
Come on Vikk.
I TAKE A NAP! You wanna take a nap? I TAKE A NAP HERE!
Final go Vikk.
GO ON VIKK!
FINISH IT!
It doesn't help that he is like Pantilimon in goal.
He's ******* huge.
Nothing in this.
I look like Vikk.
Number four Ethan!
Go on Ethan.
We are all doing pretty awful, Manny's on three, Vikk's on two.
Final round is volleys.
This is where I get ******.
Alright, five goes.
Here we go.
BAP BAP!
I'm drawing with Manny!
OH NO!
Yeah!
I think Ethan should just stand on the left side now.
Will JJ get a goal today?
Let's go!
Please miss.
I like that yeah. It's a good start, good start.
Oh my god. This is so BAD!
Right last one.
Go on Josh.
Wait that could be in.
Oh. That's good hands.
Ok. Ok now you are a defender.
I've got four goals, you've got three, you need one to draw.
Is Manny gonna be on the MAP?!
Yes Ethan!
I'm here for you bae.
Oh there it is!
If i score, i win. If i miss, i draw. Simple as that.
WHAT ABOUT ME?! What about good old, good old fashioned Vikk?
YES ETHAN!
Can I get a half volley, cause i'm like half a person?
Vikk, you can do whatever you want.
I let it bounce, and then...
We'll allow him to do whatever he wants.
No Ethan.
You know, he's still beating us.
It doesn't matter.
I TAKE A NAP HERE!
Final go Vikk!
A goal keepers' strong point is to like volley isn't it?
Alright, out of the park.
Well that just proves how rubbish we are, so, yeah. JJ, go for it.
I wanna score one!
Go on JJ!
Oh my god. It couldn't have gone worse.
