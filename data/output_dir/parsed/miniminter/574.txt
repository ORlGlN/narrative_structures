so this is am i watching by the way this
is vixx but uh yep we're home I have to
edit this video actually now hey Josh
but I don't think you heard that but he
said hi well firstly if you guys want me
to vlog more and there's anything you
actually want me to do like I'm adding
such as blog around the house Lissette
there's any activities you want me to do
with Joshua any of the others or
anything but it'll probably be Josh cuz
we're on the same sleeping pattern let
me know in the comments below and I will
go do it I saw a lot of people say go
bowling so I decided to go bowling and
evidently I haven't done it in a while I
also bought a t-shirt while I was there
bat changed but yeah I always like going
out and doing stuff so I'm happy to do
it more and more because you know as
I've said teachers pretty mad pop from
my one series to series now I need to go
in a business call yeah that's right
I've grown up then edit a video this is
a lifesaver because I write down what I
need to do everyday and to sum up what I
need to do everyday this is how boring
it is okay this is literally all I
achieve in a day edit GTA record and
edit ultimate team edit yeah until dawn
didn't even get that done go Tesco's we
record the forest horror map blah blah
blah record GTA that is literally the
same pretty much every day I've done
then I need to start working on the
setup because I've got this new stuff
I'm waiting for one more thing before I
finish cuz I've got the monitors in
there I've got the new keyboard I've got
the new Mouse everything there one more
thing
there's a style video is complete okay
so don't ask when it is coming out if
when it comes out it will come out I'm
also going to clean my room tonight so
that none of you can say anything
oh yeah a fraud but what is it for is
the question so that stuff is for a QA
that should be out soon I've got the
questions I've like I know what which
ones I'm answering I just need a day to
record it and some of the others to be
free for some of the cutscenes and stuff
but I think that's all I need to show
you today thank you guys for watching
and boom whine and scream come on boom
there we go now why tear that is all for
today if you did enjoy it please leave a
like because it tells me to do more
vlogs saying us watching and that's
a pen how did he lad flour his face nut
star pen you know what this actually
this game is way too close I don't like
