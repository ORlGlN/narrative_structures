a statement no a promise no a vow was
made last time I said I would not lose a
game in Division two as we got relegated
and I plan to continue this vow two
games today those two games will bring
me that much closer to safety in
Division two and that much closer to the
title then I will be returned to my
rightful place in Division one top
