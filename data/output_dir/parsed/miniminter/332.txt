hahahaha that just didn't work all that
was way too dark yo guys what's going on
and welcome to a Halloween special
now obviously Halloween is a time for
getting scared and you know going
trick-or-treating and dressing out it's
also a time for horror films looking at
the analytics of YouTube it seems like
the majority of people that watch
YouTube are under 18 even if you do have
fake accounts which I know a lot of you
do but most horror films that are
released are 18 because of the gore or
the violence or anything like that so
this year for my Halloween special I
decided I'm going to tone down the
horror films a little bit this is
something I like to call PG horror films
over but it's only just begun by
watching this video who have decided
in order to survive you must like this
video return Hey
enjoy wait what well this is your pizza
right you did order a pizza
yeah but there's no need to break the
door down what if you had answered the
door when I fucking not the first time
or when I had to what would you even
have um actually she's carrying an ax
around with you yes this is ends I am
protecting myself all right you know

things roughly so for and I have to help
you out but you know
