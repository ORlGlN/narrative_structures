you're somewhere I'm I'm hitting I'm in
the room down the hall oh okay
we're gonna be playing Top Trumps where
we open that the five rare gold packs a
25k each so we have to choose one player
from that pack and with that play we
choose one start and then we compare
them and whoever has the best staff gets
to keep the pack if you lose you have to
discard the whole pack so if I have a
player that has like really good
defending and he has no in for messy but
I choose defending he has to discard it
also goalies do not count because
they're weird
just I know they my goal is okay I'm a
flipper coin to decide who starts so do
I get to people you get to pick who do
you pick heads or tails
Al's never bells oh it's heads wait am i
trusting you okay yeah okay wait tails
never felt that you chose you chose
tails yep it is okay it is stable
cheating again now what are your daily

early I'm not sure my screens frozen I'm
pretty certain I got the wrong pack no I
didn't do it okay
