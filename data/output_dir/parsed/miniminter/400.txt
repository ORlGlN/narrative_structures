Yo Guys
Whats going on
And welcome to another sidemen vines reaction
Now this is the 7th part. OK
So I know you guys are all thinking;
Let's get all the Sidemen Together
And...
They're not here
Maybe
Just Maybe
We may do a part 8 if there is one
But that would mean the next sidemen channel
Instead of like a challenge it would be that
Which I know some of you wouldn't prefer
Some of you would prefer a challenge
Regardless, the rest of the sidemen say Hi
Oh , no they actually do. Look
Hi
Hello
Hello. Hi
Hi
Hi
Hi
Josh: Why are we filming this? Vikk: suh dude suh
Anyways. As you guys know how this works
This is the best sidemen vines part 7
I've done it with everyone else, it's time for me
Ow !!!
Let's just GO !
I don't get it I've seen this before
*Music plays* You just a motherf**king copy cat
I should just react to my own videos for cringe compilations.
What the f**k
What are they even running away from in the actual film
Oh okay, it was the train
Oh
My
God
That may be the best remake I've ever heard in my life
Oh no I've seen this one
Oh my God
I got sent that the other day
I literally
I saw that on Twitter
And I died
Huh, what's this
*laughs*
*chokes*
*silence*
What the f**k
Right okay this is a normal one
This
Okay
Yeah
Not a normal one now
I said that
I made that exact comparison
I mean I think he looks better as a Mike rather than a Sully
But
Yeah it is, it's a very close comparison
That's
Are these just singing ones
See I feel weird dancing to these
Because
It, it's like i just shouldn't, I shouldn't enjoy this !
What the f**k who is that
I've seen this
Yeah, I've seen it, I've seen it
What
What
There was way too much to handle just then
What is happening
Oh JJ is waxing my legs
Okay
Okay now
*singing* Makes a man go
It's that bit
Didn't even
It was the next
Man
Whoever made that vine, shame on you
It was meant to be the *Woodpecker noise*
It's always Josh
It
Is
There, there was nothing to it
It's just literally showing Josh in his natural habitat
I feel like Josh belongs in a Zoo
Every time you see a clip of Josh it's always him just being weird
But it's him trying to be normal
Alright
Oh badmen
Badmen
Pokemon hunting leads to Police chases
Er what
That didn't fit at all
See, this is, this shows the true weirdness of the Sidemen
And again what's he going to be
Sheep
Yeti
Ah I was close
I don't even know what that animal was, what was that
Was that an Alpaca
I think it was I didn't even know what an Alpaca was until just now
Oh the classic hi again it's me
Yeah
That has been around since the beginning of vines
*Singing* It's a simple equation fam you get bare p's if you get bare views
Yo I wasn't ready for that
You guys are so mean to his music
I like it
What just happened
I felt like I've just been fisted in my brain
There was so much commotion at the end
Okay Pixar
Where does this one, where does this one end
Okay
And
There ah okay there oh and then ow oww owww
Okay
Match
