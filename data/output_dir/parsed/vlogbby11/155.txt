No
oh gosh like a few months ago I ordered
a new coffee table for the living room
and I didn't realize that I just never
scheduled to have it delivered once it
came back into stock I was supposed to
say okay now deliver here and it did I
never did it I was thinking where is
that coffee table and then I realized oh
I could have had it probably two months
ago fail either they are going to come
and deliver it today so I'm so excited
so Ashley isn't here which is okay but I
just have to move the coffee table this
coffee table by myself we actually have
had this for oh my god since our first
apartment I'm definitely going to keep
it I think I'm going to put it in the
office because we're eventually going to
have a couch in there but I have to move
it so that way they can put the new one
in here feel like decorating kind of got
put on pause I mean honestly the living
room is mostly done especially with the
chair like really cute little pictures
or quotes I still have so many of those
urban ones I just need to find places
for them so yeah hopefully it looks good
if the new one doesn't look in here then
the new one will go in the office I
don't know if you can kind of tell sorry
miscues all this all this stuff but it's
the matching coffee table that goes with
this side table so it's like a marble
circle one that's gonna go right here if
you like that Clos yeah yeah okay
progress we didn't shoot people oh shoot
oh shoot
they're already here die don't have like
I'm literally impeding oh my gosh I need
a change but they're here oh my god okay
I need a jacket pants oh my god
guys I threw on Rolla and change in
Japan's and it was you should to see me
for like two minutes it was very
entertaining
nataly's okay coffee tables here as you
can tell here's the thing I think it
might be slightly too small just because
this room is kind of big obviously can
always go to office I'm like well maybe
maybe I'm just used to that huge coffee
table to where like this one's weird for
me because it's a lot lower and smaller
it's a normal sized coffee people you
know so I'm trying to figure out I don't
know no I don't know I think we mainly
need to move it forward and the couch
board because the couch should be
halfway on the rug and it's totally not
right now maybe the and also I could put
like
there is that better kind of I mean
obviously hold on I wasn't even planning
on cleaning this whole place but now we
kind of PS shout out to Remy for the
pillow there is that better that looks
better that looks so much better
oh my god yay I think it looks good let
me know if you guys like the white one
better or this marble one better I kind
of like how this wouldn't make so much
more space like the other one it was
really hard to walk between oh whoa I
totally 7u it was just kind of hard to
walk between the table I like it yeah I
feel like when you're walking it looks
so much better at least I think I'm
still totally open to moving that to the
office though if overtime works like you
know what I think I like white one
better also I really want to get another
one of these side tables for this side
whoever sits here always has like know
where to put their stuff our living room
it's coming together

makeup I didn't bother doing my hair
because we're going to get a spray tan
