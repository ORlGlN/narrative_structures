film I have like a little over an hour
hey guys so update time it is currently

starting to pack for my flights which
leaves in less than 12 hours so forget
the last thing I vlog we finished
filming I went and did a podcast not
sure if I can share who's doing it but I
was a guest on a podcast so I went and
did that and I had my fitting for
Fashion Week so have all the clothes it
was an adventure my room is a mess and I
need a pack so ah I'm so tired we can do
this quick so we have a whole bunch of
outfits in here we have a whole bunch of
jackets in here we got my suitcase and
it's completely empty that is hopefully
gonna be full in like five minutes we
got shoes galore
we got clutches galore oh this is so
heavy guys this is my first Fashion Week
I really have no idea what to expect
oh man also just the current state of my
room is an absolute mess it's kind of
stressing me out but it's okay I think
I'm gonna put some friends on and just
start packing all of this getting
someone back for me well like really
dough well good news is I said I wanted
to pack this in five minutes and I did
bad news is it literally only fits all
of these stuff from the stylist so that
means I definitely need to bring it to
suitcases which is fine that just sucks

is gonna be more like beauty stuff or
like what's the world

word toiletries PJ's all that fun stuff
