good morning guys happy Saturday if you
didn't see yesterday's vlog Tannis news
I think we're all going to go get some
breakfast right now can I have a chill
day so I'm excited yes you guys should
have you should come along I already put
up yesterday's vlog and I'm very excited
about that kind of hot out so I don't
want to wear my hi babe
so friends was so so glad we're going to
go back to the house and then Karen's
gonna come you think that I'd come a few
more clips to get from my main channel
videos my food also I went into the
store and got a thing of coke because I
needed it for my video and I've been
carrying it around and I think
everyone's staring at me looking crazy
because random ones carrying this hey
guys
update time we are back from breakfast
and it was so bomb Ashley and here and
actually left they're actually going
back to Orange County tonight I'll just
into the night there and then in a
little bit I'm going to meet up with
Chloe we're going to go get lunch and
then I think I'm meeting up with Dawn
Marie after that so should be super fun
have to time to kill and I figure it
would be a perfect time I start putting
my bathroom more together so if you
remember from Target when I went
shopping but I'm trying to decide if I
should get some like this this one's
kind of cool I'm not gonna do other
words I'd like even more
I bought some like rugs and more towels
and stuff so yes I also have some more
organizers that are downstairs so I
think I'm going to work on that too this
is the perfect time to put these down
yeah dude it's so funny how much like
these
now we're just laundry
okay so I found it the other organizing
bins that I bought the other day I
remember when I put the other ones then
I was like I could sworn I had more than
I found them they were in the carton
some Millau okay so in a blog not too
long ago I showed you guys using these
as you can tell though they still like
move around so I was really hoping the
other one that I had would fit here so
that way when I open it these aren't
gonna move around oh that's so exciting
and then obviously I'm going to have to
probably get a few more so that way the
whole drawers just like perfectly
organized that makes me so excited so we
can do a little bit of things I'm going
to excessively that down oh my god that
is already so much better
okay so we made some progress you got
everything kind of organized and then
over here I added another one of these
little trades that I bought and then
this is all like math so we have like
two pair masks in masks like under eye
things and stuff so I'm totally sure
that this drawer is going to change over
time but until then this is working out
and then to make things easier just to
save more room I ended up putting some
q-tips here and then putting some cotton
pads here and then putting the actual
packaging underneath my sink so that way
it just kind of like saves a lot of room
and you know looks a little better yeah
so yeah this is pretty much just
everyday stuff that I use we have
toothpaste deodorant any like makeup
cleansers to take off makeup
moisturizers this is honestly the only
product that I kind of had a trouble
finding a spot for because it doesn't
fit getting straight up like it hits the
drawer so it has to be laying down for
now and I use it like every day so I
really wanted it on the top shelf
because this is again stuff that I use
all the flap right now this is going to
go there yeah yeah things that move
around to be warm so excited so I still
have one more little shelf shelf drawer
organizer will play with this drawer
we'll figure it out those organizing
bins are all just so inexpensive at
Target so I'm sure like Walmart were
like CVS or even like The Container
Store and stuff like that but I
definitely recommend it because it's
already made such a difference like in
my daily life I'm not even good anyways
I have some errands that I'm going to do
and then I'm going to meet up with Chloe
and get lunch
so I'm excited for that and yeah also
can't forget about my laundry okay so
I'm going to go meet Chloe right now and
I forget where we're going but it's
actually a new place that neither of us
has been to so I'm really excited hoping
that it's really good it looks like they
have a good coffee so that's all I
really need let's be real
hey guys
update time so how long have we been
sitting here it's currently 559 I think
we've been here for two hours are
probably like can you leave look who I
mean hi it's Chloe I'm not assisting a
person that worried because all life
Elise is alive but she's a cloud Chloe
and I'm just like hi any reason sipping
a restaurant honestly so cute and the
tables are like marbles
I'm not sort of like real marble but
instead I think Phenom is really good so
I'm sure we'll be here again and then
we're talking about having an editing
day on Wednesday I got a lot I should
have blogged it but I put on snapchat
I'm going to put that here
just getting some lunch with guys like

a little flower design on everything
