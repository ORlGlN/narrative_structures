gonna have an editing date tonight I'm
thumbnail to edit Mia has a video to
edit we interrupt Alicia is normal
vlogging program to bring you a breaking
news
Alicia Marie's Instagram was hacked do
not know who the suspect is
however we do know however OS nothing
however they did leave this evidence it
is still unclear where the suspect is
and who she is
however they did leave this anonymous
message with no family although we
really have no clue what she is saying
we do suspect that she is saying I like
skulls or I like goats
both of these were left up for
approximately 17 minutes until Instagram
had to step in and delete suppose we do
have an update that Alicia Marie does
have our Instagram back but we'll never
know who the suspect is
so go home and hide your skull and hide
your mug
we are currently at a cool little room
we came to get work done and we got work
done
I'm working on my thumbnail for probably
the past three hours and still not
completely decided what if it actually
feels it'd be hilarious because this
would be recording for London and then
someone would walk in and just like
