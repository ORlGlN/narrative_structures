someone a hall and you guys I asked you
guys recently and with my last vlog
fresh to a halt and 99.999999 percent of
you said yes so I'm going to fill mine
I'm excited I'm love homes they're what
my favorite videos to watch on YouTube

you like it to the side like this I'm
kind of vibing with us or just trying it

scenes let's go
the aftermath of filming a halt oh I got
so much literally like Wow there you go
one video down I'm going to try my
hardest to film another video we only
have like two and a half hours left
probably of filming time so hopefully
hopefully we can bust it out you might
have to film a few things tomorrow but
that's okay but ideally I would love to
get it done
also Ashley is going to get a Starbucks
generally excited for oh so the one
thing I hate about halls is it takes so
long to film them and to film and edit
them with like the closest and stuff but
it's so worth it but I feel like a lot
of people just don't appreciate the
close-up clip because we don't really
probably to work it is like seriously
the filming halls would be so easy if
you just got down and showed everything
but when you have to show each thing
like I hate trying on clothes I never
try on clothes when I go shopping ever
like I never do so for me to try on all
these clothes for you guys that says how
much I love you guys I hate trying on
clothes and I actually try it on all
these for you I love the old anyways I'm
going to look over the footage I'm kind
of nervous because some of it was
looking laggy which that never happened

thing so hopefully I don't have to film
it again since a lot oh it's so very
