good morning guys today's Thursday if
you did not know what's the date I've no
idea what the actual date is well let's
see mmm it is November 5th can we talk
about the fact that this year is almost
over
like 2015 definitely kind of mind blown
by that and I know everyone says that
but I'm really just like wow like 26
this year flew by but like the best part
of the year's coming up so I just gives
me like super super excited if you
didn't watch yesterday's vlog I ended up
staying that I at Mia's apartment so
that's where I am right no you can tell
and I actually wasn't planning on
spending the night so I didn't bring
anything so low-key gonna be wearing the
same outfit I wore yesterday don't judge
me but yeah I woke up I'm snug with
Kenner's edited oh my gosh and Mia
posted the cutest picture on Twitter I'm
gonna try to find it like put it right
here go look at my Twitter because I
retweeted it like me and Ken were just
like passed out on the bed and it was so
cute it was such q picture so anyways I
woke up finished editing and did the
thumbnail for yesterday's vlog uploaded
that sets up and then I just got out of
the shower because um definitely needed
to show and yeah Mia is actually at the
gym she should probably be back any time
and yeah I actually have a meeting later
we both have meetings later so that's
why I ended up staying the night because
it made way more sense to just stay the
night and then not have to like drive
back and forth I'm from Orange County so
yeah I'm just chillin I was going to
watch some YouTube videos and stuff
right now and I figured I should blog
cuz I'm look at sick okay so yes um
let's see let's see and I'm getting
really excited because I get to start
thinking of what I want to buy like my
friends and family for Christmas I love
giving presents more than I love getting
presents I just like love giving people
stuff like I don't know I just like
really really love it reading comments
on my new vlog you guys are like so
sweet let me turn that down so we don't
hear me talking joy uh actually you were
so sweet yeah I definitely like read all
the comments I know I don't always reply
as much as that like love to you I feel
like there's some vlogs where I don't
even reply to like any comments but I
definitely read them try to work on it I
promise I'm usually just constantly like
trying to think about vlogging that I
just forget to like reply so I just
don't know after I upload I should just
always like spend a little time I don't
know I need to definitely get better on

all right yeah I don't know if I should
like start getting ready it's only 11
