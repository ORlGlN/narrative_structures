good morning guys what is up welcome to
the vlog yes
so today Sunday happy Sunday yes
currently about to get ready I have a
few more things to film for my video
that I'm gonna upload today actually so
I really have to like hustle mic get
ready
some the clips edit it get it up I
stopped doing some nail - so I'm gonna
be probably like editing for a few hours
I think it's gonna like start out the
day you know getting ready so let's put
some makeup on
this big question of the day let me know
what you guys did this weekend like was
it gel was it fun when's yours
oh when's your Spring Break - I'd love
to know that oh my god see her finally
uploaded a new vlog I love their vlogs
they're seriously like my favorite black
spot makeup is done I relation to my
hair I really really really don't want
to like I'm so lazy guys but I still
need to film the intro for my main
Channel video like I said that's going
up today and I feel like I should
probably like somewhat do my hair I also
have a few have packages I really want
to unbox because I've been like waiting
to vlog me unboxing them so I haven't
even been unboxing definitely want to do
a little haul for you guys later well oh
it's like so echoey in here well like we
show welcome to our guest bathroom real
talk
I was gonna do my hair in my bathroom
and I wanted to vlog it but the lighting
was really bad and then I was thinking
about it I was like in Malaysia like you
have other bathrooms you might as well
just like vlog in there partly is
wondering if I should just like get I
should just like in a tripod here and I
could like get ready in this bathroom
all the time do you know I mean like we
never use this bathroom so hold on so
just to give you a little visual this is
the hallway this is the guest room and
then this is the studio with all of the
like camera equipment the lockers like
all of that fun stuff this bathroom is
attached to the studio and we never
really use it obviously guests can use
it but we really just never really use
it I love this bathroom so much more
than my bathroom because it's white
cabinet I really really really wish my
bathroom had a white cabinets so bad
also can we talk about like my outfit
right now it's so cute the shorts just
everything about this is being open
that this is where tripods would be so
let me find a tripod definitely can't
find a tripod we got my weight this is
actually really stupid of me to do oh my
god I'm literally just setting the
camera on this like I don't have the
release plate thing I feel like there's
so corners of the house you guys haven't
seen obviously like there are corners I
don't use as much but you know
everyone's gonna ask when I'm gonna do
like a house or something intro is
filmed it's the videos like pretty much
done I think I just have a voiceover
left to do yes although voiceovers kind
of suck low-key not gonna lie
and then the thumbnail to do so I'm
gonna do the thumbnail right now usually
that takes like an hour hopefully it can
be faster we'll see every youtuber can
relate to this I literally just change
like my top this is the OTD today also
still wash this jacket ash if you're
watching this highest all your jacket oh
and your shirt or so sure - yeah
literally like okay so I feel like now
is actually a good time to talk about
the house tour so I let me sit down for
this I actually had talked about this so
I talked about it on an Instagram live
and I explained everything there but I
really haven't told you guys on camera I
don't think so long story short never
one question I think I'm getting right
now on my channel and stuff is when are
you doing a house tour want to see a
house - where where's the house - or
anything like that
funny story legit story times so I
actually was planning on doing a house
to her when we first moved in the more
that I thought about it I was just
thinking you know what this like it's
gonna take so long to get the house
where I want it to be instead of doing
like an unofficial house to her I kind
of did one on my vlog Channel if you saw
that you can still go see you guys show
like a little house tour welcome to our
new this is still so weird
then over here is the kitchen which
looks like this
we first moved before like it's like
such a throwback nothing is the same in
this house honestly fast forward a year
this January I was thinking you know why
I think it's time to do a house to her
obviously the house is never gonna be
exactly where I wanted to be it's not
gonna be like perfectly decorate it's
come a long way since when we first
moved it was legit planning on uploading
it
in January and then the craziest thing
happens
craziest thing so if you guys watch my
vlog - which I would hope that you did
because with a lick then you would know
that I pretty much every single day
every single day for hours I had the
fireplace on felt like Christmasy and
like winter and it was cozy and like you
know why not come to find out my mom
like feel like she just like I don't
know what happened
low-key I feel like it's a god thing
like she literally like just like has
like a gut feeling about things and
they're always right and like I don't
even know what happened she was just
thinking like you know what I feel like
we should get the fireplace checked out
who has that thought like who just has a
long story short a person comes they say
that our fireplace is a huge hazard and
we shouldn't light it ever the house
could have burnt down anytime that we
had it like on I'm sorry I had it on
every single day in December I'm not
getting for hours hours somehow they
forgot to put in like a huge concrete
slab above the fireplace so it's just
wood so the flames are literally like
exposed to just would go I could've died
like how do you how do you forget how
does how does someone forget to put like
concrete so yeah basically that that
that happened and that was like so scary
when we found that out and if my mom
didn't have that feeling like who knows
what could have happened I would never
know I literally would never have known
crazy right okay so because of that they
actually have to cut open a huge huge
part of the fireplace get rid of the
tile like fix it so then so I don't know
if I've ever said this on camera I've
never really been a huge fan of this
tile especially when the walls were
great kind of had like a greenish tint
to it beautiful it's so beautiful I
initially always just wished it was
white so be
cuz they have to cut open the whole
fireplace it's a perfect time to re tile
the fireplace maybe when it comes down
to it we end up keeping the same tile
I'm not sure yet but but knowing that I
can make this white like literally makes
me so happy
let me know if you guys have any ideas
or thoughts I just need to go into a
place and like look at different
swatches and tiles and all that fun
stuff yeah
that's why I've never had the fireplace
lit ever since because I don't want to
burn down the house is that not so crazy
come in close come in close long story
short because we might be remodeling the
fireplace I decided I would wait to do a
house tour until that's done and I think
we're gonna be moving forward with that
soon I have no idea but again I just
yeah that's my story time of almost
burning down my house not click anyways
I feel like I should come back to my
little station over here and get some
editing done ok update it is currently
12:55 p.m. I've been here for a few
hours and the thumbnail is done do you
want to see it Freddie Freddie Freddie
mama don't know what it is I think it's
just like this time of year like spring
break summer like this is just such an
exciting time of the year and this
thumbnail reminds me of that like it's
just like traveling vacation summer
school being up so this thumb nose makes
me really happy video is currently
exporting snaps for Lita
so once it's done exporting then I'm
gonna upload it can we flash back to
let's see like what two days ago when I
was freaking out because I still hadn't
even filmed this video to film the whole
video and edit it in less than like mmm
48 hours which is okay I got this I got
this it all works out that's all I have
to say so I'm not sure but I think my
mic was unplugged that sucks but anyway
