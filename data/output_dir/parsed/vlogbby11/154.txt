good morning guys what is up um so
target viewing so today is Thursday is
Thursday 16th late so 16 17 18 today
isn't today's of 20th see really the
20th oh my god April 20th my birthday
was a fit
where has April gone this is crazy so
really quick I just want you to quickly
explain why I've been gone and why I
haven't uploaded in a week remember that
time when I told you I dropped my camera
I totally just dropped my ball camera I
was really sad because I thought I broke
it but I didn't or at least I saw I
didn't well fast forward to the next day
or the day after that I forget what it
was
I tried vlogging and it was honestly one
of the best vlogs I think I've had in
you longest time it was such a fun day
we were taking pictures we were swimming
we went to Target we were all just so
excited and happy I don't know what
happened but my audio was been working
for 99% of the entire video so that
night I was trying to edit it I was
really sad because nothing was working
and then I was thinking well should
maybe I should do like a voiceover just
because I loved that vlog so much I'll
literally show you like everything which
is not working
so we have the pineapple the watermelon
and next we're doing the Flamingo which
is the biggest one which is why I waited
to do it to last because I'm leaving
okay we're going to take some pics
seriously let's see if it's like having
a beautiful party but in reality
if you thinking my the entire vlog and I
have so much footage I was really
excited for that vlog we can park
inshallah I was trying to vlog but how
much can you vlog when there's no audio
totally loving my makeup almost very
much loving the outfit a
- Oh bummer for you mash was machetes
and the other agenda laughs she's a new
doctor to look like b-roll stuff it was
such a fun weekend honestly guys it was
so much fun I have to had that much fun
and the longest time ever so much that
were low-key debating going again this
weekend because oh it was so good Hans
Zimmer if you guys guys he was the best
oh my god she was the best if you saw my
snapchat I actually cried crying is an
understatement I literally stopped I
bawled my eyes out I was crying like
hysterical crying because it was so
beautiful and magical and you guys know
I love Disney anything
he composed Lion King pirate Dark Knight
inception like the best scores ever and
Wow so good look good news
pretty sure I fixed the camera so cross
your fingers oh and then also the last
two days I've had shoots one was a
secret one I can't say much about it yet
the second one I was shooting with
Hollister again yesterday so that was
very exciting if us on snapchat but both
of those days we were shooting from
literally like 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. so did
it make sense to fall anyways I'm back
I'm here and I have very exciting news I
look real cute right now I need to get
my hair done so bad my roots are like
just I don't even know I don't know how
do you remember that time when I ordered
a couch for the office couldn't decide
what color I wanted to get without are
going to be Navy or a light blue and or
pink I didn't know which one to do and I
had you guys help me decide and I have
not said which color I got yet but it's
here they came and delivered it this
morning so currently in the office as
you can tell to clean up this area
because we have to some random stuff
everywhere but are you ready for the
couch reveal guy did beautiful like I
love it
oh my god didn't what does that done
better than stunts oh my god ah we went
with the Navy couch and I'm really
excited that I did not mind my biggest
thing was I was scared it wasn't going
to be blue enough and that it would just
look really dark and almost black but
seriously it's the perfect color like
it's the ultimate Navy color I would
have wanted and I loved it so much
oh my god this is the current update on
the office so now we just have to get
like a little table maybe like a sign I
already know what I want to do here I've
known for a few months but uh I got to
figure it out still I'm just saying
that's all so look you want some more
coffee them all so I should probably
make some breakfast because I've not
eaten yet I think I'm just going to have
an egg or two with some avocado sounds
