like I mentioned I have a package I got
this yesterday and I wanted to wait to
show you guys on camera I ordered this
because Ashlee I are headed to New York
super soon so I totally bought this with
my own money this was not sent to me and
it's super cold there so I feel like
when I like the fall haul I did on my
main channel was for me here in LA where
it's really hot and we just had a heat
wave where it was literally hundred
degrees it's not fall but I'm going
there and it's gonna be super cold so I
actually didn't need to buy some little
hope people I didn't like need to buy
but I wanted to buy some clothes and she
oh my god I forgot what I got yeah oh my
god okay
wait I'm so excited I got a few things
just a few physics will do shoes last I
don't know if you guys follow me on
Instagram but I've been all about my
Instagram lately like I've really been
into fashion more so I really wanted to
buy some more action forward pieces
stuff for my closet or sing that I
ordered I feel like these will look way
cuter on I can totally see it style but
they're just these like Navy trouser
pants that are like our crops I thought
this was looks this would even look cute
with like this sweatshirt like how it's
cropped you know everything's from ASOS
if you were curious this is very
different for me but I really like
high-waisted pants I've kind of been
wearing them a lot lately like there's
been a few events for everyone's pants I
really like them they're comfortable
they're super cute oh my god yo this
skirt guys are gonna laugh because I
have so many skirts that looks like this
but you can never have enough how cute
is this this is a white patent leather I
mean it's like pink leather this is from
a pretty little thing and they have some
really cute stuff this is so me I
freaking love it I even like the hoop
right here it's just like so me these
are more pants these ones are super soft
so they're like high-waisted and these
are like full bell-bottoms style like
pants the only thing is I can tell this
is gonna get wrinkled and one of my
biggest pet peeves is like that cheap
material that wrinkles so quick and
online this did not look like it would
be like that but it kind of is so but
it's so soft so that's all the clothing
I got and then I got to person I love
purses but I don't really buy purses
like this not often but I was like so
feeling it how cute is this this is so
me
this is Oh freaking cute it's just this
little crossbody bag I got it's just
it's so cute like even with my outfit
right now like I love this I think it's
so cute this purse which this is from
although actually I don't realize that
they had it I just really like the style
of it it looks so high fashion like bags
like this that are like designer bags
would literally be thousands of dollars
I think this one was like $50 or
something but seriously this is so cute
so it opens like that and it has a long
strap as well that was super cute like I
don't normally buy at purses like this
but I'm all for it you'll see them a
little soon and then
I got 2 pairs of shoes I do not need any
more shoes but cute this box is super
I'm not a huge flat person so I don't
know how much I'm actually gonna wear
these I feel like they actually look a
little big diggin it 36 but I thought
these flats would look super cute with
like mm of the pants that I got I'm
trying to step out of my comfort zone I
usually just wear white tennis shoes all
the time
I'm trying new things guys be proud of
me speedy oh what a house so
embarrassing I have literally wear white
shoes pretty much every single day
these ones I thought were so cute so
they're Reebok I hope you can see it on
camera I feel like you probably will be
able to it's like iridescent it's like a
pearl they're so cute
I am upset so that is everything that I
got in my home don't mind the mess

stuff so this isn't gonna be how it's
