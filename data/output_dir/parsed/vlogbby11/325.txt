scenes we are going to target right now
get some supplies and yeah it's just a
filming day but that's is good on anyone
oh our hair Chloe hi B everyone said
happy birthday
I'm currently looking for a very
specific shampoo and I cannot explain it
any Rossum makes me kind of sad I spied
Ashley oh hi definitely need somebody
better so I really wanted pipe cleaners
but tell me why I can only find jump at
once I can't find little ones and newer
other I like except for the ones that
are in a huge cakes but I don't want dad
MERP guess what I'm getting a new kid
oh that's bigger you want to get these
so I'm having withdrawals I really
really want these but I probably
shouldn't
then by gum yours so having a
semi-successful target trip I did get
something so I'm feeling a little bit
better about it didn't have everything I
needed so that Ashley like tweaked her
neck this morning so she can't move it
hurts real bad I feel bad for laughing
but it's kind of funny we're getting the
Jumbos anyway oh yeah smells so good
how's the neck like the better currently
watching memes vlog having coffee and
doing my makeup gonna be a gonna be good
time it means I mean it's me khlo money
hi babe
hi babes so doing my hair straightening
it and then we're gonna film currently
listening to okay this is like this is
like stupid so have any of you guys
heard of cereal it's like a I don't even
want this to sound sponsor cuz it's
actually completely not sponsored it's
like a murder mystery podcasting and I'm
like obsessed with it it's like really
good and I like can get scared really
easily so I was like no no I can't
handle it and then she was like no you
can and then yesterday I started
listening to it I'm already on like the
fifth episode yeah yeah oh my gosh so
it's like it's so intense side trip and
not a J supposedly take that afternoon
after he's been killed and she's
whereabouts in between
in tents right okay anyways hair is done
I think we're going to film let me
change my top and we got this head up
the comment section because it's going
to be a party on there and I'm so
curious to hear what you guys have said
three suckers really what up guys
currently having a Tootsie Roll pop fun
fast actually hate tootsie rolls like
the actual candy the tootsie rolls but I
like the suckers woo I thought we were
filming I wish I could say it's going
really smooth but honestly today it's
probably been one of the harder days to
film and the pad like of this year I
want to say almost like it's been like I
don't know why it's been really hard
down from not being able to find all the
supplies that I needed for this video
today I'm super super tired super draggy
the words are not coming out of my mouth
and then we filmed like 30 minutes of
the video and then we realized that the
mic wasn't properly like on so we had a
reasonably stressful but it's okay it'll
be good do me a favor and comment on the
video if you genuinely liked it because
it'll make me feel a lot better to know
that it was worth all of this effort yet
also you want some fake lashes for the
first time in a really long time and I
kind of like it hi as you Nick still
stiff mm you guys guess who got some so
I think this definitely calls for an
unboxing of both of them cuz I know what
one is but I don't know if this is and
the box is super cute so why not okay
let's do it so first things first I
ordered this last week I want to say or
anyone says anything I dunno how they
are kind of a little bit a little
expensive gabby has one and she said
it's like magical and I really wanted to
try it and I thought maybe I could even
like put it in a video or something and
to justify me buying it and it is the
artists brush or artist brush whichever
one you want to call it everyone passes
it but it's still a arty is crazy
brushes that everyone like the reviews
of these are insane everyone says they
work so good to make your skin look
flawless like your foundation everything
it's a makeup brush
I love oh my gosh okay so it's a makeup
brush that looks like that that intens
looks like a hairbrush excited to use
this I'm gonna use this tomorrow morning
get excited for what I do my makeups
rocks I'm totally gonna try it out I'll
let you guys know my thoughts on it like
if I think it's if I think it's worth it
yeah I got the oval-8 brush is really
hard honestly to figure out this I see
online because there's so many brushes
whoa from soap and gooey they always
have it such cute packaging then benefit
always have really really cute packaging
see if I can do this
Oh body spray oh this is warm you can
tell it was like in the Sun before you
glow glow mist me up look at this they
always sound like cute so there's a
tinted body lotion and then there's
three body mist so there's been a
smoothie star sugar crush and this one
is original pink body spray there's such
cute packaging I can't get over it
that's cute that is cute we are on you
