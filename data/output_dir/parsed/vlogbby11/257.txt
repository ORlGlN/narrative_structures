hey guys what I am so so sorry that I
haven't vlogged at all today I meant to
and then it just didn't happen I was
literally about to get ready for bed
like I just want my PJs and I was like
you know what Alicia why don't you
sounds like a knife routine skin care
routine just flush get ready for bed
with me I feel bad that I didn't vlog
today and hopefully this can make up for
it here is the om Tien outfit of the
night hoody is from a gym and the guy
section convinced that guy switchers are
way more comfier than girls hedrick's
and I was wearing some shorts fell but
victorious egrants anyways it let's take
off the makeup and one boom first step
we need to take off our makeup wipes oh
not sure if you guys know but I recently
worked with simple I've worked with them
before and I'm actually working with
them again so huge shout out to them but
these are honestly like really good
wipes love these first step gotta use
these poop okay yes yes it literally
takes all of your makeup off I love how
these makeup wipes don't sting like that
sounds really weird but there's a lot of
makeup remover wipes that actually like
kind of sting I don't like that me like
burn your eyes I love how this one
doesn't do that simple is using the
hashtag makeup for makeup which means
taking off all of your makeup and making
sure that your skin is clean but also
putting the good back into it and making
sure that it's super hydrated
oh also life have you actually take your
makeup wipes and put them upside down
and that way when you open it every time
like you flip it over and take a new one
out it's never dry or like anything like
that but what's cool is you don't even
have to do that life hack with these
because they have the Aqua lock so every
single white stays boy I almost said
moist again a boys are just a weird word
won't ever have a makeup white that's
try it out which is awesome and the fact
that I was it here cool
so I seriously love these I don't I can
tell but I'm already like a good third
way through this bag and the next I go
in with the eye makeup remover which
looks like her my friend just like this
and you're just shaken up before and as
you can tell again I love this stuff
usually use this because my eyelash glue
is really hard to get off of my eyes
this seems really kind of gross and why
not focus on my face a lot of the times
it doesn't come off this is literally
the only product that I've used weird
actually
comes off I'm not kidding this is also
really good at the off sensitive skin
because again there's no really harsh
chemicals or anything so it doesn't burn
your eyes again I cannot tell you how
much I hate makeup remover that burns
and just feels like it's chemically
peeling off your face you know that
feels disgusting but you got it you get
what I mean it gets off everything even
if stuff is waterproof it like takes it
off like completely so loved it okay so
makeup is off completely off makes me
feel so good okay so ever since I got
back from being on to where my skin has
honestly kind of been crazy it just
traveling has been a lot on it so I've
been trying to keep a really like strict
routine for it and honestly it's been
clearing up at me I don't look like it
right now but I swear it's cleared up a
lot yeah this is actually a new product
is the hydrating cleansing oil and I've
never used an oil like as a cleanser
before but you guys there's something
about it it just helps moisturize your
skin but it's not greasy
it's crazy what it was the main
grapeseed oil is like the main
ingredients I don't know I just feel
like my skin is actually clean after I
use this but it doesn't feel like it's
been stripped of all its natural oils at
the same time hopefully that makes sense
you guys ooh
start retainers are things and then some
moisturizer and then we're done I'm
gonna take these out so I can dog much
better as of right now honestly I'm
really liking it I feel like my skin's
cleared up quite a bit I think just
having that routine that can be very
beneficial that is chilling in my
bathroom part now what my makeup for
makeup would definitely be making sure
that all of making sure making sure that
all new makeup is off of my face that
way I can actually clean it I think that
was a problem because I got really lazy
this is like late night venting with
Alisha in the middle of her bathroom
floor have a coupon code for you guys if
you want a product trial from some fold
in the description box definitely check
out the link what doesn't want this cam
right who doesn't want that that's
awesome also I love your guys's comments
it like seriously makes my day when I
see them we're in a lot of vlogs because
I don't wear makeup in a lot of vlogs
but it seriously makes my day when I see
you guys comment of how much me not
wearing makeup inspires you to feel more
confident and stuff and I've seen a lot
of those comment I don't know just it
makes me feel so it is nice to feel
awesome realizing that I can help you
guys feel more confident and
thank you for those comments it
seriously means a lot because there's
plenty of times where I do not feel
pretty without makeup or I feel like I
need to look a certain way or I feel
like I'm like just disgusting or I don't
know like whatever some of the best
comments that I ever get is when you
guys are like wow like you make me feel
more confident to not have to wear
makeup and I don't know like that just
it just means a lot so thank you guys
