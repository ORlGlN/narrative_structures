forget the coffee because that is
unnecessary
high club I need you oh don't you feel
like doing my makeup in my bedroom today
I really want to try that new concealer
that I got with man-traps new concealer
so let's go for the lightest one because
me also I've used this timer for like
years
honestly years like when it first came
out Smashbox photo-finish one and then I
feel like I always go to like weird
phases when it comes to timers and
lately I've been using this and I'm
obsessing it like I genuinely can tell
that my skin looks so much better like
my foundation looks so much smoother at
ago maybe not I think about I'm
wondering if primers work better for me
in winter because I have oily skin so I
feel like in summer it honestly doesn't
do anything like anything so now that I
think about it like maybe it's because
it's winter anyways I'm going to do my
makeup and let's watch tell me on
somebody else
make the done today let's dance
today's look features a very natural
look
yeah I'm not even honestly I don't even
think I'm going to put on like mascara
at the bottom no eye shadow no eyeliner
yeah I tried the new sound or I closed
it concealer alcohol come on one second
quick thoughts on D concealer I don't
know if I did the right color and I also
need to read and see if this is meant
more for like spots or under eyes I put
it like under eye and it has Marta
orange tint so I figured cancel out the
blue but the problem is I love the Tarte
shape and tape concealer it's my
all-time all-time all-time all-time
favorite concealer ever I've that I've
ever ever tried it's really hard to find
though which is the sucky part and I'm
running low on my name early then yeah
