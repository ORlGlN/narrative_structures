it's not a donut like I don't know oh
and the free one dozen oh no it's like a
sand pail like uses a bucket for the
beach and then we got my inflatable
donut yeah I got a new PJ service q-b
Krispy Kreme donut wait this is so cute
I still can't decide about the paint
colors I've been going back and forth
out of all these paint colors
part of me is wondering maybe I should
just go to Lowe's and see if there's
anything else that catches my eye
because out of all these three I love
them all but I'm still really torn
everyone has been asking me what color
I'm going to do and I genuinely wait now
I'm thinking delicate pink look at
Ashley Ashley I'm thinking delicate pink
rose now like look at this lighting top
left looks perfect but bottom also the
perf and also right looks perfect
yeah oh my god you guys we're doing
number one it's happening I see it I see
it we're doing delicate pink rose oh my
god I feel it like this lighting right
now is just like is it I feel it I feel
it I also think it looks darker compared
to baby blush but I feel like in general
oh my god oh my god we got it it's done
we decided that's what I was leaning
towards a lot of friends have said that
too there it is
I'm so excited now he's got to get
painters to paint wait so that means
so that means I'm not going to Lowe's
tonight which means I'm not going to be
by a Krispy Kreme but I could also
totally go to cruising but then I might
hate myself afterwards because I might
eat them all do you see my problem okay
so I have some editing but low-key it's
such a nice day out so I was thinking I
should sit out here and put my feet in
the pool and just chillax
like that like that sounds great to me
yeah yeah des ting goals right oh my god
I'm definitely swimming oh my god I have
to swim later it feels like at that like
it's not even cold
