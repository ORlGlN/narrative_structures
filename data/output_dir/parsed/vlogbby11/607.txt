oh my gosh I totally realized that I
never showed you guys what I got from
yesterday
okay so let's start over here I got this
shirt and it seriously looks so
comfortable just it's like leggings and
stuff and it was on it was like 50% off
has like studs right here then these
were buy one get one for a dollar so
they're just like really plain simple
racerback tank tops and then I got to
just plain pocket tee shirts that look
like that they're kind of oversized so I
got this like chartreuse color which I
don't have any shirt in this colors and
then I got a plain white one because I
live in whites but I always get it dirty
so that's why I'm always buying more and
then I saw this tank top which I thought
was so cute and I was like this neck
detailing right here and I thought it'd
be a really good like filming top so I
got ya then I ended up getting the white
bathing suit that you guys saw if you
saw yesterday's vlog it was I think they
were each they were pretty cheap this is
supposedly 36 for the top and 32 for the
bottom but they were each like $12 I
want to say so got that super cute super
cute so cute and then I got this hoodie
which is so soft it reminds me of brandy
melville it's by mud um they sucked it
up and you guys know me and my rings I
always have them on so I got three more
because I'm always behaving the same
ones
I got this one which is super cute it
was not $40 it was like $10 and then I
got this one which was also like 9 bucks
and then this one which I think I don't
know altogether this was like $30 so I
got all three of those super cute I'm
cursed somehow I guess I cannot wear
cheap jewelry I my fingers turn green
and little
minutes like in five minutes my fingers
will be green so I have to get sterling
silver which is nice because it's like
nicer quality but it sucks because I
can't wear cheap toys and then I got
some makeup I got the lorac um this was
a liquid liner and then I got a brow
pencil because I was out of both of
those I used them at both today so if
you're noticing the eyeliner I used that
and then I used the brow pencil and I
really liked both I really like lorac I
almost got the Pro palette but I went
over the gift card amount so I was like
I can put it back have enough eyes
shadow but I may go back and get it
because it was really pretty but yeah
