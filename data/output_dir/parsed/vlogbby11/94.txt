makeup
and then I just didn't so like sorry but
yeah smear in my room oh I feel like
you're always just like in the
background like vlog went up this
morning it is a little later but that's
okay mr. day done in the longest freakin
time ever if you don't follow me on
Twitter you totally should first off
though if you don't follow me on Twitter
you really should because the other week
I did a poll where I asked you guys what
videos you want to see in my channel if
you guys want to see behind the scenes
then you should do and it's you who I
can talk and guess whose vlogging behind
the scenes of this entire video so if
you are not watching my vlog channel you
really should yeah we are filming some
deep wise work filming some D of wise
who update time it's a bit later it's
currently 3 p.m. Chloe's currently at
the groomers so when she comes home
she's go look so cute I want to have an
Instagram shoot with her today for her
Instagram guys follow her on Instagram I
really should freaking love her we're
almost infilling I'm really excited
about that we have like a few things
left to get and yeah so my teachers are
doing cool they gonna eat something are
you eating hungry so we're filming we
are filming
I just need yeah like a quick nothing
that reminded me of not kick-starts me I
starve yeah that makes no sense no she's
like whispered in my ear and I got
chills like good things left do
my last just keeps sticking together so
I'm waiting for this one DIY to dry I'm
going to do to do to do we have a
package I honestly have no idea what
this is and those are my favorite
unboxings because you have no idea or
where they're from I'm trying to think
like what do I think it is it's trendy
you're right is it wait there's one of
those Maps things because I would be so
poor stripped y'all
I needed some of those oh my god wait
this is a charcoal one that's really
cool thank you
I've never never sent me stuff before
and I'm always down with some horse
trips yeah I remember that one time Mia
put horse strips all over her face which
is funny because they make face ones but
she used nose ones like everywhere I
wish I knew where that vlog was because
that would put it in the thing I'm
wondering though is it came with this
little magnet I think it's just I think
it's just to symbolize that they get
everything out but part of me is
wondering this is for something thank
you be alright
ever since Chloe left Toby's been
sitting here so my money's not long no
he said he's like where did she go also
he totally sits pretty and he just like
has always done that because he's part
Chihuahua he has longer legs for Dane
sweet so Mesa pretty yes
like yeah I love you hello literally the
worst because I stick like I usually
like Papa double chins I'm looking down
and like my place hips are forward some
words like pretty much done with filming
Ashley went to go pick up Chloe I'm so
excited to see her oh my god ash and I
were gonna try to go to design tonight
but
ended up not happening so now we're home
I have some packing and random stuff to
do alright show you guys the new office
support we have because we ended up
keeping the neon sign and the phone up
from the diner intro I feel like the
office is like really coming together
and there's something coming which I
don't want to say yet because I'm not
sure if it's really gonna happen but
it's most likely coming and that will
like really just put all of this whole
room together I'm really excited about
that so if we could do an updated office
to it I ended up putting up my computer
it used to be more straight on but in
order you know obviously because the
phone stuff is here I put it more in the
corner I actually kind of like that
better hold on let me move all this much
better okay so I move my computer a
little more in the corner we have the
phone it looks so good there I love it
so it's not like plugged in to be a
phone but like it could be and I think
that's really cool then we have my desk
Ashley's desk of the September calendar
up and can't we like I just I still
can't believe it September not even like
the beginning of September anymore it's
literally the middle of September we
easy to me me I'm I get my computer cuz
it'll look way cuter oh I'm so stupid I
feel like it makes a difference you know
yay and then we had the printer here but
Ashley was thinking that she kind of
misses the plant over there we still
have this because I look you just want
to take a picture with khlo on it
wouldn't she has her hair done so that's
why that's still there but other than
that diner is gone it's kind of fat it
is so nice how it kind of looks like
it's gonna rain though which is weird
oh yeah we should swim tonight ash
perfect swimming weather oh my god Chloe
come here oh come here
Jill everyone your new haircut come here

we're so Bluff E we actually need to
take photos of her for her IG baby hi oh

time we get closer and closer oh my god

I was saying we should go swimming it's
like her swimming leather

printer here or do you want to get the
