good morning guys how are you doing
today it's September 21st where's this
you're gone that's all I'm thinking
right now like literally hearing me say
that out loud
September 21st what's this crazy it's
actually like really crazy so I actually
just uploaded yesterday's vlog so I was
really excited to get that up I feel
like I'm gonna be back on my blog game
and I'm really excited for that there it
is go watch it is huge haul and I'm
finally home so go watch that if you
haven't watched it already and yells
this is so dirty oh my gosh you need to
clean it but I'm going to start my
makeup soon because today is an exciting
day
I actually have a shoot today I can't
say anything what it's about
horse that's so annoying I know so it's
currently 10 24 obviously I got the
coffee also I think I'm gonna use the
new Tarte palette today the one that I
showed you guys in yesterday's vlog oh
so beautiful oh my gosh
most definitely gonna be using this yeah
I really need to go to Sephora because
the solution does not match me anymore
I'm way too pale for this so it takes
like twice as long to blend it out and
Richard sees it also this concealers
still my all-time favorite concealer
after like what two months now that I've
had this it's the shape and tape front
art it's amazing like it's actually
amazing first off don't mind the fact
that there's like powder all over my
face totally baking right now and second
um I started using this palette and
first saw I'm really bummed that there
isn't a overall matte nude color because
that's usually what I always like that's
my goat I use that color every single
day thought this one was it but then
when I put on my lid it's definitely
like pink like it's a light blush pink
color so I was like
dang there's like some shimmery ones but
I really like matte one boom McMahon
hair is done which makes me feel really
good it just feel so much better after
you like get ready for the day so I was
like you know what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna tell you what I'm gonna do I'm
going to unbox my iPhone at 7 whoops
yeah I'm really excited I I've been
meaning to do this I was gonna do last
night but the lighting was really bad
and it was late and then I was like wait
I'll just wait till tomorrow to do it
and I still need to back up my phone so
I'm not gonna turn it on yet but I'm
just gonna film it unboxing I may make a
separate video and upload that because I
know if you're like me when I buy
something new or in like nice I watch
every single review unboxing anything
like that I might do this at a separate
video or I might just put it as this
video we shall see but yes let's do that
so here's the Box got my camera set up
and we're about to film those furnace I
ordered this last week I want to say oh
my gosh okay please like this I worded
it straight off with Apple as you can
see I got the rose gold color and it's
the plus I actually have the iPhone 6 I
don't have the 6 plus so this is my
first time getting applause I did regret
not getting the plus when I got the 6
don't tattoo - boom you don't even see
it Thanks we're just gonna move this and
there it is it's gonna pull this up the
rose gold is so pretty the plus feels
weird I'm like not used to this although
this case is really bulky so it's not
too bad like if the difference isn't too
bad right away I can tell the difference
with how much the lens pops out
especially cuz it has the second lens
this is literally my favorite part
oh okay so in the box we have a cube we
have headphones and the difference and
this one is that there's actually an
adapter on the back because as most of
you probably know there is no headphone
jack with this phone stand where
headphones and a charging cable like
normal so there it is that is everything
I hope that you guys liked this video
and if you want to see what's on my
iPhone I'm gonna be uploading that super
soon on my main channel so definitely
check that out
and yes hey guys so update time is
currently 1:00 a.m. and I have been on
set all day long which is crazy I left
my house this morning at 12:00 and it is
now and I just got back at 1:00 a.m. so
it was like a long long day as you can
pop it up on my makeup it's like
actually off I was just about to get
ready for bed and go to bed I was like
wait on it and this box yeah I will see
you guys tomorrow with new blog I love
you and yes okay
