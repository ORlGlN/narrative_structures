good morning guys how are you so today
is Friday I am just kind of chill and I
probably should have gone to the gym
this morning but honestly just didn't
happen so that's cool but yes today
honestly don't really know too much oh
you know what you know what that sound
means that means my coffee is ready yes
is hello beautiful you are amazing
um but yeah later tonight we're actually
gonna be going to Halloween Horror
Nights at Universal so I'm really
excited for that up until then though we
don't really have too much going on
that's kind of exciting I feel like I
just you know right now I'm going to
edit on this week's video so I'm excited
for that too hopefully I can edit it
pretty quick that'd be amazing boo my
hair it's creepy okay so it's bit of it
did some editing which I was really
proud of and yeah so I'm just gonna
start getting ready
luckily my hair is still pretty straight
from yesterday that's amazing I love
when that happens and you're just like
yeah I don't have to do my hair today
today we're gonna be filming for
Ashley's channel so I'm excited for that
I figured now's a good time to do my
makeup because I don't think she'll be
home for like an hour she went to go get
a whole bunch of supplies and stuff for
the video so yeah yeah let's do it okay
so um let's first of all put my hair
back and now it is time and to do some
makeup what are we feeling today I'm
kind of feeling something just a little
more like natural
whoa guys with my hair back with this
white tank top on why not look like
Miley Cyrus in the wrecking ball video -
the red lip do you see it
based Societas crediting okay
so I look up at my camera and I realize
it's not recording and I was like has
this whole thing not been recording cuz
how really suck I've been sitting here
for 20 minutes doing my makeup and I
don't think it's been courting recording
oh no hopefully not just Carolyn my
eyelashes Wow
what accent was that Alicia I'm just
curling my eyelashes now we're using the
mascara this is the roller lash by
benefit it's good good wanting not to do
too much like I makeup today just you
know I feel her hair oh my god
where is it I thought where is it oh my
gosh oh I see it yeah shape not so much
eye makeup I like it I love it but now
we're gonna do it lips and I want to try
I've gotten so many new lip products
lately as I'm sure you guys have noticed
so I kind of just want to try some new
products out so let's see what oh my
gosh
and while we do that I'm gonna put away
some of these eyeshadow palettes I feel
like the hard part about picking a lip
product is a lot of the time the color
and like in the tube is so different
than what's actually on your lips so I'm
kind of like having trouble picking on
out mmm okay so there's this lip paint
from Tarte which I like it's really nude
I just I'm hoping it's like have like a
pink tint to it I can't tell if it will
or not and then if not we obviously have
a Smashbox lipstick which we can use
feel like we can actually take out the
hair now you're curious this is the
glossy lip paint by Tarte and the color
hella i say hella all the time and i
know people make fun of people who say
hella oh I don't think I'm open to it I
don't know if you can tell but it's
barely on my lips and I can tell it's a
pretty color but I feel like this is
good for a smokey eye when you want like
a really nude lip but because I don't
have much I shadow going on I feel like
I need some color on my lips right now
fun fact I lost my Kylie cosmetics the
lip paint and Coco which is my freakin
favorite one like favorite lip products
ever yesterday I actually ordered a
whole new lip kit so hopefully that gets
yours and doo-doo-doo
now it's too pink first time it was
enough pink then it was too much pink so
now we're gonna try putting this on top
and hopefully it's like the absolute
perfect color okay kind of fail it's
pretty vice I feel like I need more
color on my face instead of trying a new
product I'm just going to use the one
that I used yesterday which is working
it by Smashbox I've been loving this
color but I think I'm gonna add a little
bit of gloss or something so that way it
does get a little more color then
there's today's makeup pretty simple
pretty natural I'm in a mood to it okay
I'm gonna make a shape now that my
makeup is finally done let's do this
well I think I mean I don't want to I
don't want to guess wrong but I think
Ashley might be doing a Halloween video
because it looks like we got some
Halloween stuff here
this is tambourine everywhere I found
always on the way Halloween Halloween
photo babe yeah it was beautiful by
utiful right guys it was a beautiful
okay
so a fun factor this piece of hair was
supposed to be over here but it doesn't
want to stay over here yes it can just
do whatever it wants cool
peanut butter
