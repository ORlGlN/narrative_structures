so I did a really bad job at making my
bed this morning but we're just gonna
pretend that it looks good yeah
morning guys I'm either my hood and when
I have a bun it looks ridiculous because
it's like really tall
oh that's much better I'm currently
trying to find some breakfast I'm hungry
currently 959 and now I have to wait
until it's 10 because otherwise it'll
really bug me any second really any
second any second this is literally the
longest minute of my life
yep mmhmm mm-hmm oh my gosh look yeah
okay I don't even know what I want
hmm oh yes this looks so good I'm
excited got some green tea met up with
Ashe just a mission to get lunch but I
already ate
I'm here for the TV my water bottle
works in the tripod anyway I thought
about I haven't had the passion teen all
time it almost got it that great that
really wasn't the right angle with
service
so currently during clean outs in this
week's is the GE Oh which I need to film
tomorrow I'm so behind it's not even
funny
no not truck I keep thinking Thursday's
one say Risha tomorrow is Thursday
sera doesn't count because I'm busy all
day so there's that hey guys my shirt
with sets of my shirt so I'm gonna go
home and get some what ready tonight we
have a concert we're gonna go see
Hillsong and I'm so excited it's gonna
be real good and I think that's at the
forum the ash is gonna be me ash and
Taryn it's gonna be really good
sure what is it with my shirt right now
like what what also currently an 80
degrees it's so hot kind of not looking
forward to summer because of it it's
windy so spontaneous spontaneously
decided to come to Marshalls because I
need some things for this week's video
although I don't know what that video is
yet I said whistling for videos flies
and next thing I know I'm ended the Emma
clothing section totally found some new
at workout shirts and I actually have
desperately been needing something like
I can justify it so yeah is this not so
adorable do you like it it's so key I
don't know where I'd put it though and
we're home my hair's been just like
bugging me bugging a little bit
impromptu u-haul yes no let's do it as
you saw we went to Marshalls and I got
some goodies so I'm just gonna show you
it's like nothing crazy but I figured
I'd show you okay so first off I did get
beak band that you guys saw at first I
was like where can I put this I have no
idea where it's gonna go then I realize
wait I have so much space above the
cabinet's in my kitchen I haven't even
started decorating that so I was like
wait that could be really cute like
somewhere somewhere up there and it goes
with the whole like retro theme to the
kitchen like my toaster a mixer tea
kettle everything you guys know you guys
know I definitely have a colorful
kitchen so this is totally going to go
perfect next I saw this while I was
checking out so I like threw it in my
basket just cuz I was like oh my gosh
they're really cute they're just folders
but they have such cute sayings yeah it
was only six bucks so I was like okay
done it says be smart be kind and be
fabulous on them and I thought worst
case if I don't use mess folders I could
always like cut this out and frame it
like a DIY or something I think it's
just like super super super cute so I
got that next I got some socks I love
the like working out socks because
they're actual like low-rise and you
won't see them is it bad that I low-key
sometimes like just buy socks if I need
to do laundry like yeah I know some of
you guys do that too and then the
workout shirts that I
I got a like neon yellow one they're all
t-shirts too because I have so many tank
tops but I don't really have that many
workout t-shirts a pink one and then
this one that just says Nike on it and
now that I'm looking at it I kind of
wonder if Ashley has this one and then
when I work out I always usually wear a
baseball hat and wearing my black one
like every single time so I thought I
should get a new one but I just got this
like gray one that one was obviously $10
yeah and that's my Marshalls haul oh oh
hey guys like you're on some I cannot
talk ever like ever ever ever I throw on
some makeup really just like natural
again I've been loving that lately I
don't know what it is I think it's the
fact that it's so easy to do I mean yeah
whatever also I was just editing this
vlog because I'm busy tonight and I'm
actually busy tomorrow morning I was
thinking like wait unless I want to stay
up till 3:00 a.m. I should probably work
on my vlog now also it's weird like
having part of it edited and then going
back you know to media like it's weird
cuz normally it's just at the very end
of the vlog of course when I get
everything yes that's what I've been
doing till drink of the tea ice cream
tea if you're wondering hey guys update
I'm it is currently at 6:54 p.m. in a
while I want to walk but we are
currently on our way to Z forum we are
seeing Hillsong I'm so excited

really vlog too much but we'll see what
I could walk definitely got a coffee

common thing guy I was it was like a
24-hour flu right it was literally 24
