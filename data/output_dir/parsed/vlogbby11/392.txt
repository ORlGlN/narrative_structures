morning guys and oh my gosh it's so
weird to be vlogging back after my
apartment are now like after being gone
for two weeks it feels really weird
that's all I have to say my hair looks
so short right now it's like in a bun so
I just did my makeup and I'm currently
getting ready I actually have a meeting
later and then after that I'm just going
to come back and go to the gym I think
Ash and I might go to the mall later
yeah don't do my hair I don't know what
I'm gonna do I like I don't want to do
any heat to it because if I'm just gonna
go to the gym later I feel like it's
pointless to like get all dolled up and
ready
I don't know Mike's Rubini or I might
put it in a braid or something oh come
on mmm
it's okay um yeah okay also I gotta find
something to wear oh my gosh my room is
such a mess it's more messy than normal
because my suitcase is still like I
haven't unpacked yet and it's just all
over the place okay what did it want to
wear my hangers all crazy still - from
packing before I left it was so crazy
