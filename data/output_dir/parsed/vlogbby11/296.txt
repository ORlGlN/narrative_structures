good morning guys and welcome to beauty
con la let's go yeah so obviously my
hair is like perfect right now like it's
gorge just got back from me a hair salon
I got a blowout just because so easy
like I suck at doing hair come to
realize that I can make it like decent
like my own hair but when it comes to
actually like making it look really good
I would so much rather pay for someone
to do that so yeah I have it up so it's
setting because we don't really have to
I don't think we're really gonna be at
meetings like one and it's so weird cuz
I can literally see the convention
center from here so it's like I see you
guys but we're not there yet
but I see you over not there so yeah
obviously I'm at Mia's and we're going

change

starving I feel like barely in all day
it supposed to be a two-hour meet up
with a 30-minute break in the middle but
what we ended up doing was just cutting
our break and doing a three-hour meetup
because we wanted to meet as many of you
guys as possible so long story short we
paused or meet up for a little bit so me
and I could like grab some food because
we were so hungry and we're like eating
like backstage for like like 2 minutes
then we run back out to have our meetup
like it was crazy but it was awesome
