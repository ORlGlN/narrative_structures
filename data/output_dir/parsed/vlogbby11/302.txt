this lot with my concealer today but I
feel like I was I had to oh no I think I
got cute light on
update so put on concealer put on
foundation and so far I really really
liked it this is the first concealer
that I've used a long time that I still
like actually kind of covers more of my
dark circles because my dark circles
have gotten pretty bad
definitely not doing my hair today I
think I'm just going to probably leave
in a ponytail I think I actually really
want to edit an intro for my blog
channel and I don't know if I'm gonna do
it and if I don't do it I'm not going to
include this footage right now actually
posted this picture on Instagram or a
video on Instagram it was so cute you

one to do there's a couple things that
are different kind music font and
