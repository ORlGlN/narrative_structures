most failure of a failure blogger today
so we filmed most of the video that we
were filming I told him I might put on
my blog channel if it's like funny if
it's not funny it won't be or look one
after Channel I feel like I don't think
should go on someone's channel like you
know it should be Cuse so we are having
a very cozy night as you can see we have
the flyer on the fireplace we got the
char free
we got the beanie we've got the Aggies
fun fact growing up my dad never wanted
to use the fireplace for whatever reason
he just like didn't want to use it we
always had so like TV kind on I'm like
Christmas
they had a like on one of the TV
stations still like I remember when
everyone first started talking about it
in YouTube videos like Oh put a
fireplace on I was like oh gee R right

growing up like all the time like not
even kidding Joey when it crackles it's
like all cozy okay anyways I'm so sorry

the bubbles as you guys know like my
little like signature bubbles but I
think it's time for a little change I'm
still about change right now I've almost
