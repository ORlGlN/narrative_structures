I really don't even know where to start
this at all so if you didn't know I was
on tour for six weeks with fullscreen
Live for the girls night into her
actually got home last night and it
feels so weird it feels like time
stopped it feels like I was just here
but I wasn't going into this we had a
rough start rough start
being on tour is such a weird experience
because you basically are living with
strangers for six weeks all in a bus and
you get close really quick you're on
stage every night you're meeting people
it's just we it's so weird and it's not
normal but that becomes the new normal
there's so many little things that I'm
gonna miss waking up I'm in my bunk
there's our home oh good morning Alicia
Vicki I don't wanna say disgusting green
rooms getting coffee every morning so
Patty and I are going chai we got the
goods heck yes we do you have to get
your your clothes are all under the buys
last time getting my stuff out from
under the bun
you know you you visit places and cities
that you never ever thought you ever
could
I'm in Miami this is legit and you meet
people that you never would have met you
guys this person in the blog they hide
it up a blog and it's such a weird thing
you don't need a man if you are your own
rainbow feels literally like they have
become family I've never really said
that before I'm actually really really
sad this is brand new family is very
friends never see of them they just like
a Twitter family blog the water
surprised that I'm coming back to
reality was a lot harder than I thought
it would be I seriously do that Monica
home right now it literally feels like a
dream you know but it was yet just the
other day literally just the other day
I've learned so much and I'm so grateful
for that this is been awesome
I've learned I'm a lot more independent
than I thought I've learned a lot of
patience a lot of patience I've gained
confidence I have seven daughters out
here and
I have three excellent men that have had
our backs and been there for us through
everything I mean I've been on a tour
before but there's something about this
one I've never really felt so emotional
sleep it towards the toilet I've never
done four it's really hard it Oh freak
I've learned so much about myself that I
didn't know as possible and I didn't
expect that and there are certain people
who they probably don't even know how
much they helped me or they do I don't
know
hey guys it's super message for Alito
yeah happy pirate find out and I give it
away
Leisha beautiful blissful energetic
mysterious woman there's things that I
don't think I ever expected out of you
that I've seen and I love it I love
every bit of it it's the last sound
check your cry oh no how do you the fan
page with haddock McDonald and Pat
Leisha how I gonna miss us
yes just you though trust me
all be about three minute vlog ception
I am so grateful for this tour and what
I've learned and who I've met I know
it's not normal to feel this emotional
after doing something like this things
up but yet I'm grateful because that
means that admit something and it was
special last miking are we ready for the
fountain that's 15 minutes guys last
show I feel like something's missing
being a home and I'm freaking crying oh

dude she's crying but like yo it's real
it's real I'm not crying
but give me like 30 seconds I'm good so
far and it's weird looking back to day
one I have been waiting to announce this
for such a long time you guys don't even
know I am going on who were looking back
I wouldn't change anything because
that's the reason why we're such a
dysfunctional go go go why are you on
the ground and Jessie paper functioning
what am i killing it okay shamily we're
all happy
this is crazy
go side in addition right and who knows
maybe this is the start of something
bigger and better not the end sort of ad
for now
wait say your quote a good torque I
can't
well you're like your quote no you said
it the very first thing that a good tour
is that toward success we've all been
very sad at one point
