editing and I think we're going to some
shopping have another photo shoot coming

good on camera like I'm looking at the
view friend right now and just thinking
this is perfect why don't you look like
that in person oh my god the painter

what color should we get instead Oh also
today we're most likely going to go find
another paint color so I'm really
excited for that looks like I've short

soon I kind of got nervous I'm like
shoot my gosh wait like two weeks to

want starbuck should we go get coffee
you want coffee kidding you can't hack

really exciting if you've been keeping
up with her vlogs she's in Europe living
a life but we're here Chlo misses us
you guys whereas the base plate I got
got goin to the bar for every time I
used to drive to Starbucks I would
always pay fat person behind me do you
guys remember because I remember like
always doing that of Norwich County it
was like a thing and I realized that
have not been that a very long time but
seeing is no one is behind yet but I'm
sure some of old timers I just started
pretty busy I used to always heart I
don't know honestly I was like months
ago I totally forgot about it anyways
we're getting coffee I have a headache
that'll help and then we're going to get
paint watches for the living room and
looking up some new ones we're not gonna
be Lowe's we're gonna go somewhere else
and hopefully find some people we should
be like guys these are they could do a
Saturday blood
let's do outlook Joe there's no one
Thank You Donna honey hi can I get a
grande iced almond latte with caramel
drizzle in the comment I also get a
grande iced coffee and a venti Cup
exercise no sweetener and half and half
I mean almond milk and then can I also
get extra caramel drizzle on that one as
well that's all you're like you're
 sorry
apparently Starbucks this power to spoon
out they're giving us free drinks it has
to be iced coffee or iced tea but can
they I wonder if they're doing like
caramel supports just like playing no
it's like oh my god my worst nightmare
oh I hate spiders I'm going to Damon
this Starbucks guy literally save their
life literally if I ever came over here
when I was trying to get our food and
here are a bit we are currently at the
paint store and we're going to get some
paint swatches pray please pray until oh
my god okay there are so many color
options I'm going for a lighter shade
than I think I want to be so that way
when they put in three coats it's going
to be the exact shape that I wanted to
be there so many options there's
actually so many options like sue meant
like there's too many like any of these
would look good oh there's so many we're
going to get at least seven or eight
color options like I don't care I don't
want to have to come back I'm getting so
many really excited I'm wearing looks
like oh we got so many way up seven
samples they all literally look the same
like a special on camera they look like
the exact same shade but or not okay
guys so we got the paint we have seven
of them right here literally like
they're all so similar but that's okay
got this we have some paint brushes they
were like a dollar and then we got these
really cool I guess they're like
stickers that you paint on this and then
you can stick this to the wall and
figure out what paint color you want
without having to actually paint on the
wall and then you can like remove these
well easily so we're going to do that so
let's get going oh my god this one is so
pretty oh not so pretty I feel like I'm
like in arts and crafts time look at the
time this is like the color of my shirt
ah
saturday is the day Plaza yours truly
this is yours truly it's so funny to
look so different watches look like baby
oh okay
so far I am really loving this color
it's like I feel like it's honestly just
the lighter shade of the pink
fluorescent over there love this one
okay have so many samples and what's
funny is they look the same but they
don't which is the funny part so we kind
of already decided that if you are know
a ballet slippers is just too pink
because this is to coat I mean people
have now it's too pink but I just have a
feeling that would be too pink but then
I'm like maybe it wouldn't be because if
what I wanted was this pink just
slightly toned-down so gonna be so hard
I feel like this is going to be way
harder than the first time having the
truth because now I know what can go bad
huh yeah pink oh oh we sleeping before I
get too dark I wanted to show you guys
they paint swatches
okay these actually look pretty true to
color do you see why we're not liking
this you're like so freaking different
number one powder pink number two frost
cp3
touch of pink like this one and then
less but none of these for ballet
slippers so we haven't narrowed down to
these four most likely ballet slippers
out because I feel like it'll be too
dark so bringing it to the top we have
some option I've been using this plant
to kind of like it looks good I'm liking
that one another on our we decided well
we're not going to be that one one of
these three so let me know line a few or
three I know the lining is kind of weird
right now but surprisingly I feel like
it's rich for the color except this fun
what is this one guys you look how pink
thank you plant you've been of great
service on though that was well it makes
such a difference to have like a green
plant in front of it you know I mean
what crazy here's it by itself here's it
with the green that looks so good here
is it stuck here today they're so cool
it'll sticker things are so freakin cool
it doesn't ruin the paint do you like
this one close hello you guys what is
that I just wanted to quickly end this
vlog I'm editing it right now I was
really hoping to get it up for today I'm
also get excited for tomorrow's vlog
because I can see the new pink skin
it's almost look like as we desert now
okay Eliot you later mom
