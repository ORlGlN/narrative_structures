their Beauty Blender like I'm so freakin
lazy like I'm literally so lazy when it
comes to cleaning these anyways let's do

literally took probably a minute maybe
if that anyways makeup is done so this
is the look we got going on today it's
just like the usual bye I added a little
more eyeliner on bottom could we change
it up a little bit so yes you guys I am
getting my hair done today
dun dun dun dun yeah I got my hair done
it was in November like early November
but it's now like almost March so it's
been a few months not gonna tell you
guys what I'm doing today yet it's
different I hope it's like drastic we'll
see we'll see anyways I need to figure
out my outfit I threw on this top as
well as my pretty little thing a sweat
skirt sweat skirt but I really kind of
want to have like a Heidi or something
this I have this hoodie maybe I'll wear
this hoodie with it that could be cute I
like that okay so yesterday I did a
shoot with Hollister and they let me
keep some of their stubbornness
so I got reaps much it's like like how
cute is this oh my god oh my god we're
good we're good
I thought this was a bug but it's not
it's just I have no idea what that is
okay wait guys this is so ok you it's I
love this it's like the hoodies cropped
and then with the skirt and then of
course I was probably just like white
tennis shoes but super cute super calm
guys I kinda I'm not liking at mynheer
right here because the lighting is not
good for outfit of the day so I'm kind
of wondering if I should move the mirror
like over there maybe there's really not
many other options my room is such a
mess right now guys I'm sorry Michael oh
look at her she's just on the pillow I
love you
but yeah the lighting really bothers me
that's the a bit so here's before it
goes right under my boobs pretty much oh
my god comment below what you think it's
gonna look like if you haven't already
seen the final photo okay there it is
there it is it's almost one-thirty and
it usually takes about 25 to 30 minutes
to get there which means I gotta go so
let's grab our stuff come on khlo
okay phone hearse let's go
okay guys so I just got to at my hair
salon and I'm so excited right now I'm
getting a little nervous just because
it's gonna be different but I hope it
looks good on this cars right next to me
I'm trying to see a date really I don't
know what they're doing are you trying
to come in front of me or behind me I
think they're laughing at me
oh no okay just give me they're trying
to get the car in front of me I was like
ah so here's I'm gonna actually trying
to vlog a little more than I normally do
just because a little more drastic I
feel like I've already posted a photo by
the time you guys see this vlogger so in
case I have I'm cutting my hair pretty
short and I really want it platinum like
a really bright blonde with some roots
at the bottom so I'm getting my
extensions out which is the main thing
because they just it's time for them to
come out they're just it's just time for
them to come out like it's been a few
months and last time I took out my
extensions insert picture I felt like it
was a really in between awkward length
so I figured this time I'm taking them
out I might as well go shorten a little
more drastic and then we'll see if I put
my extensions in for like Coachella or
like something like that like I don't
know that that's the plan right now but
I figured we might as well go pretty
short and what's funny is lately I've
seen a lot of edits from you guys like
when I'm vlogging and I have my hair
back I've seen so many people being like
cut your hair cut your hair and like I
don't know I'm kind of like yeah so here
we go
are we ready I'm not ready I'm not ready
I'm excited but I'm nervous looking
fabulous extensions
my extensions are my hair's longer than
I thought I was gonna be it's like here
oh my gosh it feels so good I can
scratch my head for once oh my god I
can't what is this
I love it I love it we just did the cut
and now we're gonna do the color oh my
god I can't we're getting inside I look
crazy I'm so excited for you guys to see
it I haven't had my hair this short
since 7 I know I know
guys it's done I love it oh my gosh oh
my god I literally have not had my hair
this shortened so freaking long and it's
so bright man has also never been this
blonde before oh my god I'm just gonna
be staring in a mirror all night I'm not
kidding oh my god hey guys so I'm home
and here is the final my battery
definitely died so I changed so lighting
is not the best I wish it was daytime
right now but this is the final look of
my hair you guys it is crazy
tomorrow you'll definitely be able to
see a much better look of it and stuff
but I really like it it's so different
like it's crazy it's so different I said
it before but I haven't had my hair this
short since middle school oh my god it's
so weird I'm definitely still getting
used to it look my hair was so long
before here's the after so here we are
in the same spot about almost 12 hours
later this is the fun look oh my gosh
I'm so excited to learn short hair
hairstyles I really want to get good at
braiding more and then like even doing
like little pigtails and like braids and
like half up steps nice not having my
extensions in for a little bit so we'll
see I'm sure I'll have my hair long
again soon but I figured you know what
like why not like just why not it's just
hair I could dye it Brown tomorrow like
I could get my extensions back in in two
weeks and it would be back to normal
like I feel like I need two more dares
in life you know so yeah I love it
