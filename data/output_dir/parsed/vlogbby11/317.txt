good morning guys so currently 12:22
p.m. I was just about to do my makeup
sitting here at my desk and I'm trying
out my new makeup brush and I was about
to do my makeup like put it on and I was
like wait she waits because I told you
guys I would vlog this I'm gonna block
it for you guys major major fail I
wasn't recording I'm so excited right
now I'm so sorry I promise tomorrow I
will do more of a like hands-on tutorial
slash review with this hey guys so stay
tuned as well as take two because I'm
about to do my makeup with this rational
excited yesterday I finished a weird day
hope that your day has been great I hope
that a past couple days of husband has
been I'm so tired and she'll also don't
mind the fact I'm totally wearing it
likes basically the same outfit that I
wore the other day because I have a
couple more things to film for this
week's video and I figured it'd just be
easier to get back in the same outfit
that I was in I think there's only like
two things I need to get and it'll just
like look weird if I change you know I
mean so yeah that is what's going on I'm
about to start getting ready of course
we have some coffee think I'm gonna
watch some YouTube videos while I do my
makeup and I yeah what else is new
August ago what else is it okay so go to
test out this brush let's see um let's
see you're just supposed to it's gonna
put a little bit of foundation on it
cool okay so because it's like so--but
you can just basically I don't know so
it's weird so weird
it's really relaxing filling
I like okay this is gonna sound weird
but I've always liked when you buff
foundation into your face like when you
like really like buff it in there those
two just like patting it or like
brushing it on does that make any sense
and it's a plus that it's super super
soft so it feels really good when you're
applying it you're just like mmm y'all
don't like you gotta just like a race
away everything does that make any sense
probably not this looks really good I'm
gonna put just a little more foundation
up because I usually like a little more
coverage it's so easy I'm like mine but
how easy it is to apply your foundation
with it it looks like those like cartoon
hair brushes you know like those
old-fashioned hair brushes I think I've
been done using this for the past like
three minutes but I keep just brushing
my face with it because it feels like
really good I'm really really liking
this although I will say like do you
need it probably not you know I mean
like unless you're just into makeup then
I would recommend this or if like you do
it professionally but because it's so
expensive I feel like it's not like oh
my gosh you have to go buy this you have
to save up and go get it but it's also
just like the second time I'm applying
it so maybe like when I start using it
more and then go back to like a brush
that I used to use maybe back and I'll
really see a difference oh my gosh okay
yeah but so far liking liking this
oh I was trying to make good lining
makeup is done yo the aftermath haven't
been using my glamour caddy I forget why
I put all my make oh I went to me as I
think yeah and then I put all my makeup
