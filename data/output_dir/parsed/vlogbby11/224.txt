good morning guys and welcome to vlogmas
day 8 so it is currently like 7:30 and
getting ready because I actually have to
go to LA today I have two things I feel
like I can tell you if not I'll cut this
part out I'm doing a shoot with Access
Hollywood and then I'm also doing one
with New Year's rockin Eve so I'm really
excited because those are two like
really big things trying to leave in
like 30 minutes because traffic is a
thing OC probs but yeah that's what I'm
doing the first half of the day but I
figured I should start vlogging now
because if I don't and I'm just going to
forget to vlog and then I won't walk -
like - and I don't want that to happen
I feel very rested because I saw
yesterday's vlog I was feeling like
anxious and just like just like MERP but
I'm feeling better that's good but yeah
someone upon some makeup also currently
watching Nia's vlog I mean I love you
yeah make Mazon hair is done I have my
outfit and we are ready to go I'm making
some coffee right now to take here's the
full TV jacket from Topshop necklace
description anyone Panther Topshop
booties are Nordstrom don't mind don't
mind all this ok so about to leave and
it says it's the steak hour and a half
but we will see because traffic is
always a thing so I'm leaving early
hopefully does it get any more than that
but yeah
I feel like my makeup looks really weird
today it's that ever happen to you like
you're some days it just does not look
just is not it's not like how it
normally looks yeah okay so I probably
shouldn't vogue and drive so I'm going
to put you guys away I wanna put up my
tripod so I can vlog
so everything went really good actually
I didn't vlog because I'm not sure what
like I can show and what I can show but

weren't expecting me were you oh hi
buddies hi I haven't seen you in so long
I know okay you guys are probably like
Alicia why are you at Mia's right now as
you guys know I left my blog camera here
so I was coming to pick it up then I'm
starving so I stopped by earth to get
some food and then I told me and she was
like oh that sounds so good and I was
like well I can get you a salad and I
can leave it in your fridge she was like
oh my gosh yeah best friend goals when
you have a key to each other's place and
then you bring them food and leave it in
their fridge
so I got the hummus in tabbouleh salad
like normal with a side of grilled
chicken and then it comes with some pita
bread and then I got Mia the Greek salad
with chicken and bread so I'm just gonna
put all this in the fridge also I told
Remi that I was going to come here
because I wasn't sure at first with Mia
could let me in because she's not here
but then I was like wait I got a key
this can work so that I was telling Remi
that I wanted to do like a prank or
something while I'm here cuz me it's not

so Ruby's gonna be home in a little bit
and we decided what we're gonna do is
we're going to switch out all the
Polaroids on Mia's fridge with Polaroids
of Remi and she said she has a whole
bunch of Polaroids so she's gonna text
me when she's on her way back and we're
