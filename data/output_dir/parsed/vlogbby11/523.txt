good morning guys so today is Tuesday
and what did i do this morning I
uploaded my blog that was exciting
so we haven't seen that yesterday's vlog
you should go watch stats we did some
awesome target adventuring and it was
pretty fun and yes what do you see this
it's like one piece of hair anyways I'm
just currently getting ready as you can
probably tell by the way you guys should
be proud of me because I remember how I
like cleaned out my makeup thing like a
couple months ago I showed it in a vlog
it's still pretty clean yeah look at
this boom so excited I mean granted like
these are just kind of like tossed in
there versus like neatly placed and
whatnot but that's okay so like decently
organized so I totally recommend getting
like one of these acrylic trays I forget
where I got mine but they're basically
everywhere I want to say I think I got
mine from Marshall that sounds right you
can get them from like honestly any like
container store or anything and I love
it go so so much because it keeps
everything nice and organized any makeup
collection yo if you were wondering so
we're gonna put you right here we're
gonna focus on my face blush that would
help very much so what color shopping
used a do this we're using benefits
rocket or yeah it's like a really pretty
rose gold so flash this makes me so sad
okay blush done and now we showed you my
Sierra and I think I'm gonna use oh hey
I dropped it um what is this me roller
lash from benefit I really like benefit
products really good so forgot my songs
oh look who came to visit I look over
and she's like sitting right there on
the carpet just staring at me it was
like you to the wig hour so we are
snagging so close you look like a little
furball you were so pretty you guys so
pretty hitting a lip gloss in your heart
and on the old whoo we are done we are
ready for the day do you guys 100 TD
maybe maybe first of all totally
straighten through my hairs because I
don't know I just felt like doing it but
I'm kind of watching it not gonna lie
main reason why I never like straighten
my hairs up is because I touch it so
much during the day but it's like really
really really greasy so that's why I
just like never really shaking my hair
often but I was like you know what we're
gonna do it sorry I have to cover my
mouth does probably annoying by a purple
crop top
boom is from D Kendall + Kylie
collection from PacSun but technically I
bought it off Amazon but they still
packs on on Amazon if you didn't know
they got that and then I'm wearing some
high-waisted shorts so I got from Urban
Outfitters and then faux shoes I'm
destroying my Rainbow sandals cuz that's
plain and Brian whatever made a pedicure
don't look cool so headed out the door I
need to go to Walmart to get a couple
things that we weren't able to get
yesterday for filming and stuff so so
let's go okay so now we are going to
