mine that you ever sold I'm gonna have
so much fun reading all these comments
now like if you've been here since the
pink room oh my god but if you've been
here since the green and blue room I
don't even think any of those videos are
still public oh there might be like one
or two that are still public I feel like
most of them are private though oh my
god I love old videos man you guys I'm
all done with my Christmas shopping I do
have to do a little more wrapping but I
think that'd be like super super easy
powder today's gonna be a pretty chill
day so like no need to be full glam
and makeup is done and also hair is done
because a low-key way too lazy to do it
so I put a beanie on hashtag very
relatable and it looks okay you know man
it might throw I'm not getting sick I
think it's honestly just allergies but
man speaking up man I'm like a man let's
get food I'm so hungry and I really want
some coffee
number one reason why I like soap to pay
for parking everywhere man
oh my god bless we got a latte and I'm
so excited for this right now
guy I'm kind of sad so I realized that I
accidentally wrapped the wrong present
for Ashley that I like I have her to
presents once for Christmas once for a
birthday but I need to switch them
because that one is actually for her
birthday and this one is for Christmas
so I have to rewrap them um no okay
so this needs to be I was so proud of my
wrapping I guess I could save this
Oh
