hey guys it is Monday and I actually had
quite a productive morning let's see I
woke up like decently early I took Chloe
for a really long walk which was fun and
then and then I did some reading and
then what else to do my god else's
laundry I was holding some laundry and
stuff and I even started going through
my closet to get rid of a lot of clothes
if you've watched my blog for a while
you know that I like I'm constantly
going through my closet and giving my
clothes just because I have a shopping
problem
I admit so I try to make up for it by
donating a lot of clothes it like helps
me justify my shopping addiction not
gonna lie so I have a pile right here
that I'm giving away and then I stuff to
go through my dresser my closet again I
just have too much clothes so yeah how
did that and then I was thinking I
should really get ahead on this week's
video or just like just everything in
general for my videos so I was gonna go
to either Panera or Starbucks do some
video planning because I actually have a
pretty good idea and I see to like sit
down and like do it but it really really
helps me to get out of the house so I
like going to like coffee shops or
something I'm just not like sitting at
home all day Ashley's at school right
now I was up really late last night
doing homework all day and also I didn't
vlog yesterday I was literally doing
homework all day boom anyways I think
that that's about that it

go need a jacket because my dress broke

excited to post them like I have in
other videos my boys I was like Alicia
you just need to like take a step back
and be passionate about like uploading
certain videos and just like really like
get creative with stuff different things
and stuff so yeah from now on I promise
myself I'm gonna start thinking outside
of the box for my videos and my channel
and stuff and I'm really excited so I
challenge you to do that also if you
make youtube videos because we need some
diversity up in the YouTube community
and don't get me wrong like grandeurs so
like trendy videos that like everyone
uploads which is totally fine for the
most part I don't know I just wanted to
like push myself I like felt like it
kind of got like in a funk and I'm just
like no Alicia need to push yourself be
more creative like think of different
things so yeah I don't know I am
pointing my toes okay that was a bad
point that's a better point it was like
