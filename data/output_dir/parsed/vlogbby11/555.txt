hair I've yet to do it today anyways um
today's an exciting day I'm gonna be
doing a lot of filming and also today is
the start of me redecorating my room you
followed me for a while now you know
I've really been wanting to do that I've
been wanting to do it for a while and my
dad ended up staying here a night to
help me because I have to like move my
bed and like change over to stuff and
thanks dad for staying and helping so
I'm super excited I'm I'm not sure how
long the whole like I'm not sure how
long it'll take for the whole room to be
done but I figured we might as well
start this because I've been wanting to
do it the main thing that I want to do
is lower my bed and move it to the
corner right here so that way it's not
in the middle of my room I don't know I
just feel like there would be more room
to walk in stuff and yeah so we're gonna
try that and then I also have to order a
new dresser I've tried everything I can
do to fix this one and there's just like
no hope whatsoever it's like completely
broken like the bottom 2 drawers like
don't even open and I've tried
everything cuz I was like hey I'd rather
save the money if I don't have to buy a
new dresser yeah what else but I'll do

wearing my on Wednesdays we wear pink
shirts from Target and whatever these
running shorts are I just it's so cute
right okay so we're gonna lower the bed
move it to the corner over there

whole bunch of space right here update
