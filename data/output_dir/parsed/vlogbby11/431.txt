and I'm also out of my makeup powder so
I need to go to the mall to get shot I
really want to get my eyebrows done so I
think I'm gonna do a too far away they
look good but up close they're like

gonna get my resume oh no I should go
shopping for something in my eyebrows

don't think I'm gonna do my hair today I
think smell it air dry again

got a new penny board so definitely want
to take an Instagram with it because
it's so pretty and I don't want to write

too pretty to get it all dirty you know

packing yeah
bass we just got them all and I honestly
don't really want to buy too much
because I have too much stuff anyways
but I really really really want to find
a new bathing suits because hashtag
white and I got rid of a lot of my
bathing suits when I was moving problem
is it's definitely almost Christmas so I
don't know how many stores are gonna
actually have a lot of options for
bathing suits and definitely going to
Starbucks first because I have not had
coffee yet today I've been trying to
like slow down and instead of having
like two to three cups a day having like
one a day so I really wanted it this
morning because you guys know me I need
it to wake up but I was like no I'm
gonna wait because I'd much rather have
it later when I can enjoy it anyways why
am I talking my coffee I came in okay
you
boom been waiting for them
okay so it's hardly had any luck finding
a bathing suit I got a spot at one store
but it's like a store that only sells
bathing suits
other than that there's looks really no
baby entire mall because everything has
snow stuff doesn't even know here in
southern coast
I got my coffee and it changes heading
up my camp right now insulter okay round
two about to go on target I found I
think I got one bathing suit top and
then one actually two-piece like bathing
suit at the mall so that's guys so
obviously here to see if they have
anything else I really really like but
if not then I'm totally good and I'm set
I still could use like a cover-up and
then I think I need to makeup wipes and
deodorant toothpaste I need something
like that
let's go let's do this grab the purse
rabbit the phone here we go so I feel
like it's literally gotten nothing done
today like I have I haven't even started
packing the mall took way longer than I
thought it would because there was no
bathing suits still haven't got my
eyebrows done although I really really
really need to that Merc whoo we go
target please have something
please don't be broken like last time oh
we're good yeah dude target wins out
having the biggest swimsuit collection
out of anywhere in the mall
I'm really excited now oh my gosh dang I
should have came here first this one's
cute no a buttery smashing that's cute
and I also love this one medium oh my
gosh this is so cute this one's cute too
but it looks like a triangle one came to
the Travel aisle because obviously I'm
traveling tomorrow
I don't do suitcase but as a nice or
something else that I need I think I'm
good I don't really don't see anything
that on aid well because you step behind
I don't think we need any groceries my
batteries washing gonna die any second
I think I'm good I think I'm good all
that weep so cute
literally the coolest thing ever yes we
had a very successful target trip they
live I got everything that I need it I
should have come here first we just have
a lot of swimsuits now um I need to get
my eyebrows done really bad I wonder if
they're open so we are back at the
apartment Ashley we are still gone um so
it's just me here so that obviously
calls for some coffee I actually didn't
even finish my Starbucks today I just
tried to try to put everything so I
figured I'm gonna be up super late I
might as well make some coffee and I
didn't finish my other one earlier so so
it's all works I think snapping it's
like I'm snapping at you guys sorry so
if I ever make coffee at home with your
wondering I love using it the Italian
sweet crepe my better you definitely
died so sorry it's been a couple hours
my battery died I needed to charge
anyways I am currently packing finally
I'm actually meant to do this way
earlier today when it was light out but
that didn't happen
I've never been to Hawaii I don't know
if I mentioned that in yesterday's vlog
has never been so I'm really really
excited okay so the first one that I got
looks like this like a really cute high
neck like mesh type of bathing suit in
the back looks like that and I got this
one it's kind of different but it's like
really really similar to the first one I
kind of don't know why I got to I think
I like this one better it's really
similar like high neck but this one's
more of a cream color and then the back
is like really loose and bohemian and
it's just like super cute from Target I
got this one I ended up getting the
Mint's like light blue one I really
really really liked this one and then
these are the bottoms for it it has
matching like crochet to kind of go with
it so I really really liked that one and
then at Target I just got some plain
bottoms I got white one and a yellow one
to go with the other ones that kind of
mix and match whatever you know um yeah
and then I got this really really pretty
just like beach cover-up now this was
really cute and I can wear it every
single day and it's just like so big and
flowy you can wear off the shoulder so
I'm excited about this and the material
is so soft it's really really like it it
literally looks like I'm gone for a week
and in reality I'm gone for like what
five days four days okay so we just
FaceTime to Kat and we talked for I
don't know like 10 to 15 minutes or just
like I don't know I was officially
excited
oh also I got my eyebrows done so go red
right here that is what I didn't bother
putting makeup back on it but they look
really good and I'm so excited I'm
really glad that I went because it makes
the biggest difference when you have
your eyebrows done what's in my suitcase
it's not completely finished yet but
here we go
like toiletries and all that stuff it's
only a shampoo and conditioner my makeup
makeup brushes curling iron some shoes

also was not expecting this this is from
Benefit Cosmetics I can see I'm pretty
sure I know this is because I want to be
a blog and she unboxed it and in my last
vlog everyone was saying how you really
want me to do more unboxing videos and
stuff so I was really happy that you
