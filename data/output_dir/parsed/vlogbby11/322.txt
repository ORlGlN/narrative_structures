politican of funny door bell rang keep
in mind I look like this I thought was
Ashley because she's just text me like
hey like I'm coming through the gate or
whatever so I brought over there
open it I'm like hey and I look and no
one's there I was like oh my gosh I look
down and there was a package I was like
what it's like the mail guy like or what
if it was a signature time where he was
waiting there at door and he was walking
downstairs when I was and illiterate
open I was like oh my gosh look Oh fine
it's cool like I don't care I really
don't mind but it's just that would have
been you know like one time I was
filling Alli Shawn's video and I had to
sign for a package I had to you like I
had to sign for it I was like I look
like a guy right now the guy looks me
like I was like school project he's like
okay let's open it shall we let's open
this oh it's from Smashbox one thing I
love about them is they always have like
personalized cards anytime they send
stuff which i think is really cool ask
and you shall receive back by popular
demand our halo highlighting wand now
comes in two shades golden pearl
I've never seen this before my gosh I'm
so excited I'm all about highlighting
lately so whoa
thank you okay thumbs up this is
exciting so we have pearl and we have
gold or I'll use it in a blog and yes so
tell me why um today's kind of it fails
literally we film one thing that's gonna
be good like I'm very happy ah that's
your daughter that's cool goods yeah so
we're going to go to the beach by the
pop right now all for like one shot so
it's gonna be like the rest of our night
is what are getting this one shot which
is cool because like at least it'll be
out of the way but I was really hoping
it would be way more productive in it
why I guess that just means there has to
be like unbelievably productive which is
cool which is cool so yeah that is what
going on it's gonna be good it's gonna
be great I really want to get off set
goals so we should probably try to go
soon because I'm sure they closed a
little early layout yeah just yeah
exactly so we're gonna go to Huntington
um it should be fun last time I was
there is rolling around in the waves now
I'm just like a kid so that's cool also
yesterday is a target challenge blog is
off you guys should go watch it if you
haven't yet it was really fun to film it
was just like really different at first
split second I wasn't sure if I was
gonna upload it because it was like
really random and I failed mr. mace it's
okay boom is but it looks like you guys
like it overall just because it's like
it shows so many bloopers and show me
like so many awkwardness
cuz I'm are you know me yeah we are in
not Huntington I just kind of run we're
in Huntington not really okay cool hey
guys what up so um um yeah ha there was
a little bit of traffic I mean like a
little bit you really only have one
scene to shoot and it's also gonna take
like not even that long so I'm getting
an acai ball right now I'm really
excited to that thing Crips vicious
and like walk around I brought my
backpack so for my camera so don't stuff
like you know yeah yeah yeah up so many
palm trees dududu just got a bonsai pole
literally the best acai bowls over in
Huntington actually I think ever at
least the ones that I've had seriously
so so so good I'm gonna eat this and
we're realizing wait there's another
scene that we actually can fill I was
gonna get like a shot at me like riding
a petty board and I realized many words
are in my truck because I keep them
there because I figured any time I'm
going to want my opinion board it's
probably what I'm out and about so
that's why I have many boards which was
kind of casual so we're gonna try to
find a street that we can film like
that's cute I serious out here so it's
it's it's beautiful but it is a little
silikal oh hey we are going to the water
take some pictures and I was saying I'm
telling Ashley that we should go there
here though you know like when you go
into a Hollister store there's like
pictures are like footage of the beach
yeah real live footage I mean I can't
see every single one but a lot of them
it's Huntington Beach totally try to
find the camera and honestly it's a
little windy right now so don't even
know sorry I'm nervous
looking like this getting caught on
camera
in here actually
I do see it oh okay I'm trying to help
you yeah clearly it's just a glimpse
into what Hawaii's gonna be like
we're saying I like ridiculous
everyone's laughing at me you know what
