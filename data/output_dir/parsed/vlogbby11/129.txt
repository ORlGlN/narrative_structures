alpha mika we got another one I feel
like I'm not supposed to open it like it
open is so bad we have Q eyeshadow duo
things I shadow primer there liquid
lighter I've actually heard so much
about elf liquid liner this thing I've
been meaning to open on camera for the
longest time ever it's called bite and
they have a mousse like literally a
million so many lip liners I don't know
if they're new organic ingredients made
in Canada again the last thing is
totally already unboxed because I opened
it this Smashbox came out with some like
cream lipstick things as you can tell
two missing I tried them out actually
like them they're super creamy so
they're different than why I thought
they're going to be update time it is
currently 713 cm so it's a little later
Nikki was free tonight I was free
tonight I was like yo I actually should
do some I want to do some shopping who
said we're gonna go shopping big
surprise I put up the room a
transformation vlog and you guys
seriously like I feel so good to finally
be up I know not everyone is been going
through that I know not everyone is
going to like my room which is totally
understandable because everyone has such
different preferences I think another
thing people are kind of thrown off of
is that it's not super bright in like
neon color I actually really really like
how it's very minimal and white because
you know if it's fall time and I want to
make it more fall feeling all I have to
do is throw on some orange or like like
yellow orange like fall color blankets
and pillows and then it's like a blank
canvas and then I can take that off and
I can put neon pillows on it makes it
like it changes the room completely
I turn it on wait
Oh New York yes Bobby can you like turn
out like here chillin for a long time
what up you guys we are currently at 3rd
Street Promenade do Exodus off I'm doing
some ok
I don't have a reason honestly I sit
summer I like was really odd watching
from summer halls and it made me want to
do a hall and now I was like well I
should move shopping so we just went to
you at Victoria's Secret and stuff we
got the goon and now I think we're gonna
head to Urban Outfitters or Randy so
we're in urban and I just saw this
adorable bathing suit I didn't realize
with a baby to ever talk you but then I
took some price tag a hundred and thirty
two dollars was a hundred and like
that's it like I've got a ripoff
I'll go to Target and get left with $20
bikini so warm and cold Oh so I spotted
a really cute baby - in a shirt Alicia
and I'm I want to get my reaction
because I'm pretty sure it's a hundred
dollars also two hundred and twenty
dollars so glad resources yeah I I hope
I never seen $200 on baby
Hey oh that's cute really loving this
I asked with really cute stuff here I
really want to find some shoot like
those little sandals like with white on
