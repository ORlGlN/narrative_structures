wonderland here this should actually be
lower this should be down here something
like that how freaking cute is this it's
just like a winter little wonderland and
I love it though I want to get another
one of these trees to go over here

when they want me to drive they just get
in my car so we got some food
we got a pizza John ray and I are
sharing all the olives on her side not
mine we're sharing some mac and cheese
looks amazing I actually got a salad
we're gonna eat we're gonna so big
surprise guess where I am headed to the
mall because why I'm actually really sad
but I decided to return only one thing
out of my whole life right at all which
I'm really excited was the the green the
green pants from Victoria's Secret
they're super cute but they just fit a
little tighter than like vase they're
supposed to like you know this must be
super packing some a little sad little
sad not gonna lie but it's okay and then
John reset had some returns to do too
we're like yo let's go the mall it's
gonna be crazy though alright there's
parking was horrible he's probably be so
crazy with people shot baby yolks hey yo
we need confident way I said I said we
need oh my god it's so pretty
like it's like crowded because I love
holiday shopping it's just like starves
oh there it is
I'll be down there in two seconds we got
the goods holiday shopping oh actually
I'm low-key starting to think about what
gifts I want to get people to start
thinking about gifts to get people
really excited I actually really really
really want to just decorate a little
bit more in this room because I got a
whole bunch of stuff at Target the other
day as you remember from a huge ha
insert here okay the biggest target haul
I think I've ever done but I haven't
taken a lot of stuff out of the bags yet
let's do it I got so much stuff I got a
lot of stuff for the dining room table
because I just thought that'd be like
super super cute like these are like
cups they look glass with like gold but
they're really just plastic which is
awesome I got some those yes oh I knew I
had one more of these this is specific
on my room or we could leave it down
here we don't know and oh yeah yeah the
silverware okay wait so we got a whole
bunch of play I think all this plates in
here so you guys I'm so stupid don't ask
me why for some reason I thought there
was more than just one set of silverware
dang
okay so I forgot to get extra silverware
and I also forgot to get the little
rings for the napkin but look how cute
this is good luck max in there how cute
is this again pretend pretend this looks
like this but we have little playsets
and these are plastic these are plastic
Oh some couples so we're we're up it
like it looks so anthropology asked but
it's really just target and it's a lot
cheaper so I got four of those we're
gonna put them on the table well this
was kind of a fail because I realize I'm
missing most of silverware an extra
plate and the napkin ring so it's cute
also this is probably ain't gonna go
here I think this wreath is gonna end up
going up here umm but yeah so that sucks
but um but we're all good so I guess I'm
not really decorating much today I
thought I was but at least you guys got
to see my room because that was the big
thing that was the big thing although
that's not done either oh the struggles
of having a house there was like too
many rooms to decorate is not man
anyways hey guys what is up so I quickly
just wanted to end this vlog I realized
I did not end oh I'm so sorry I don't
hate me anyways I love you guys and I'll
see you really soon with a new vlog and
get excited cuz blog this is happening
so so so so soon angel love you guys bye
