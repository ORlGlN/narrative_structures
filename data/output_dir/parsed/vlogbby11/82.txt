update time just some eye makeup I
honestly like didn't want to do too much
because we're gonna be filming tonight
so I'm gonna have to redo my makeup
anyway later but I want to just to put
on some makeup I'm just a little bit so
I don't know if you guys notice well by
now you would have already noticed but
yesterday I actually didn't vlog at all
and I'm actually kind of sad about that
especially because very last minute we
ended up going to target super late and
I feel like it would've been such a fun
vlog it's been such a long time stuff
gone target it just got really dark and
now it's getting really light it's one
of those days where it's cloudy and like
the sun's just you know being the Sun
Wow I'm magnificent I actually figured
you know what I think I'm just gonna do
a target haul it like it's better than
no vlog just like sit down and do a haul
and upload that today yeah so I want to
film that today but then upload it today
also to make up for not vlogging
yesterday so that's another reason why I
kind of wanted to put on makeup so I'm
gonna go get all the stuff it's
downstairs I guess we can take this main
down yeah better okay now I figure I can
carry this upstairs and vlog at the same
time it's probably not gonna happen
Oh struggle man if I put you guys in
here wait wait okay this kind of works
so then I have my coffee I can't carry
that okay hold on let me hold on okay
now I just kind of wait is this working
wait I wonder if I can even put my
coffee in you oh no no I can't do that
wait I feel like this is like a GoPro
wait this is this probably like the
biggest double chin angle you could ever
imagine
oh my god this is really heavy for going
up the stairs oh my god my workout for
the day oh you guys see what I look like

some really cute stuff you guys like I'm
not kidding like how freaking cute is
