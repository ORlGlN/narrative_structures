filming day because I didn't say that
today but I didn't say that today yeah
what's up it's like noonish and ashen
are starting to film and it's gonna be
it's good fun get some stuff done so
yesterday's vlog I was like still going
to footage to like midnight or something
was so late and I really liked a lot of
the footage that we got from yesterday
so I'm just like on it remember how I
was like I'm so tired and I'm like
dragging today I woke up just like in
the mood to be productive which was much
needed because the past two days I was
looking around today I'm feeling
productive which is awesome which means
it's gonna be a good day I'm gonna love
the footage I feel it it's gonna be good
he's all related like you can't
interview with the Sigma for I want
chicken on yeah

but the cannons so much more sharper and
clearer let's just see both out you hit
my foot anyway I'm a sock

hahaha liquid Ashley brought me cuz she
loves do you love me thank you yes I
totally curled my hair and changed my
outfit if you're wondering maybe worth
maybe were I don't know now we're just
gonna add Mysteria yeah everyone always
asks what I get this is an iced passion
tea with no sweetener in it but it would
not be the same without my stevia I have
to add stevia literally I live on this
stuff just kinda live on but probably to
go through this so fast and I kind of
like a lot it's a sweetener but it's
more natural so it's better for you then
like Splenda or sugar or anything like
that so that's that as you can get at
Trader Joe's it's amazing so I add quite
a bit of that to my tea and then it
tastes just
YUM we gonna get some filming done oh my
gosh

want to upload that video faster there's
one thing I really hate about pre
filming because if you didn't see me

have to like pre filming stuff
the problem is I want to upload all of
these videos like now but I have to like
wait a week and a half two weeks and
that sucks really bad but that's okay

amazing
