feel like it was kind of not
embarrassing but it was kind of like oh
she's like I don't want to have to
explain that like I did something and I
didn't work out and like you know but
yesterday I used the FinTech foundation
instead of the two-faced one because
I've been using this a lot lately and I
wanted to give this one a second try
because I never really gave it like a
full try I loved my foundation yesterday

likely going up today the day you're
watching this because I'm caught up on
my vlogs full freaking finally I know
you guys have been wanting daily daily
daily vlogs but trust me I've been
trying to ease into it because December
is going to be so much logging every
single day and I will not miss a day for
vlogmas I'm one of those people when I
set a goal for myself like that like I
will not break it for anything so I'm
using November to kind of really ease
into getting back into daily vlog
vlogging every single day it's really
really hard so that's why I haven't been
doing daily vlogs right now I'm kind of
cold like I want to start futari anyway
