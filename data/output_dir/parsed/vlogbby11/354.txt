later in the day it's three o'clock not
like lately it's just later cuz my
mentor my blogs in the morning but I
like I don't know I wasn't really
planning on vlogging today because I
didn't start earlier literally two
minutes ago I was like dang I probably
should have blog today oh well like I
don't want to too late and then right
now I just like a literally picked up my
camera was like I'm gonna vlog I don't
know I just I was like there's no reason
not to like it should have been a ball
game day yeah I don't I don't ask I
don't know sometimes I overthink it
that's a problem I didn't overthink like
everything so if I'm like oh it's too
late like I should have flogged I won't
vlog because I don't get enough footage
to like know just blah I'm gonna do it
yeah I'm gonna do it
okay moments of empowerment show so such
as show I mean this is kind of feels
like a morning vlog though because I'm
literally like I mean I have like a top
up like my crop top I'm just literally
in sweatpants
hashtag comfier yeah and I just made it
some coffee yes this was desperately
needed I've like the last two hours I've
just done nothing like I'm stats and
watch YouTube videos so I'm so excited
for this I was gonna wait cause I'm
actually gonna meet up with John Murray
tonight because she's also going to
Coachella this weekend so we wanted to
do some shopping and just like get some
stuff for that so I think we're gonna go
to grow so that I was like well I might
a little vlog then and then I was like
why can't like then like after that vlog
but it I think I can do that even if I
was doing something fun I know you guys
would still watch
or maybe not oh hey I finished filming
every single thing for this week's video
so I'm so excited I think you guys are
really really like a nurse it was fun
for me to film and I feel like the ones
where I enjoy filming you guys like
watching more which makes them and then
we took some pictures and I'll show you
guys if you want see and over the couch
oh oh oh okay oh yeah first of all log
is up so and go watch that our extreme
filming fail and a little behind the
scenes I'm gonna turn off my voice so
you don't hear that yes wouldn't that be
so cool if you just like when people are
talking you just like mute them that's
so weird to say that's actually like
unbelievably rude to say like honestly
you know like and then they're just
talking you're like I don't know
whatever oh my gosh oh I was gonna show
you this picture they'll show you some
pictures
I'll show you one I'll show you boom but
there it is as you can tell definitely
matches my Instagram aesthetic yeah so
sneak peek of an Instagram picture
coming up I'm not sure if it's gonna be
and I also like posed a million other
ways this is the only one that I like
made brighter and like put saturation up
and stuff um yes
but anyways go watch the vlog woo I have
literally been here I have seriously
been sitting in this exact spot for the
past like two hours I think Ashley left
for class at 1:00 and it's 3:15 I mean I
did do a lot though I got my vlog up I
edited thumbnail I edited those pictures
that it's an email so I mean like I've
been productive it just it's still like
I like not been productive but anyway oh
my gosh we would question for you guys
since I had like two hours for you today

hours for you today
so the serum oh I was like debating
doing like a live stream or something I
don't know if has something you guys are
like interested in if you like those
thinking of going on you now because I
know a lot of people like that site and
they use that line so let me know in the
comments if you would totally like want
me to start doing the live streams maybe
like once a week or like something like
that or just whenever I'm free honestly
the only reason I feel like I've never
done them is because Ashley or Mia did
it with me I'd be like oh my gosh I
understand let's do it right now but
it's been such such such a long time
since I've done like a live stream and
even then it's it was never by myself
I've never done one for myself so I'm
like oh I don't know if it'd be
interesting for you guys I don't know I
tend just to ramble all the times I mean
