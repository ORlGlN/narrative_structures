hey guys so I just wanted to say hey
because I was editing this vlog out

involved and it was just all over the
place and I just kind of wanted to give
you guys a little update and I know I
don't like oh this to anyone or
inadequate I'm rambling oh my gosh ian
is hot aside I'm sorry so the reason why
I like my blogs have basically been gone
and I haven't really been I feel like
I've just kind of been gone off youtube
right now beside from being on tour
instead week ago I found out that my
aunt passed away so that was pretty hard
especially being on tour so I'm not even
home
it's like if my family or like deal with
that it was really weird knit was really
sudden it was weird and it still feels
weird because I still haven't been home
that happens a day of RC Lewis show
which was the beginning of this vlog and
then from then on I just felt like my
vlogs were so scattered and all over the
place so yeah anyways I feel like now I
can end the vlog and just kind of start
fresh today new blog but yeah I love you
guys so so so much and thanks for being
there for me and I love you and
understanding it and I love you
