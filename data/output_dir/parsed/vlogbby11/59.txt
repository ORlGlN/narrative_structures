let's go literally think this is the
most I've ever bought from Target before
my wallet says so - okay oh my god
there's so much keep in mind this is the
first year in the new house so I did go
a little crazy like we're gonna keep a
lot of these for next year so this is
for the living room the kitchen my
bedroom like there's a lot you know
yes don't at me anyways so come I don't
know how I like I got lucky and just
found these because there were only two
by themselves it was like yours I think
they're gonna go downstairs I'm not sure
they might go my room I'm gonna have to
let you know I think tonight I'm just
gonna or maybe somewhere I think
tomorrow I'm gonna like officially start
decorating everything so yes
Scot those I think these are gonna go
here in my bedroom so I got two of these
pillows which I think they're both just
gonna like go over here I love them I
got these little things in there
you and I have a mantel guys I have a
mantel that I can put stuff on and I'm
actually really excited about this
because our fireplace downstairs like
super bougie and extra and there's no
mantel so I'm really sad about that
because I can't have stockings on it but
I could have my stockings up here which
I'm really excited for and I'm excited
that there's just an odd ledge to like
put things on isn't he so cute we named
him Wilbur I pull myself together got
this little like plant garland which
might go on my bed or could go on there
or could also go on my dresser over
there this pillow is the pillow that I
guarantee every single youtuber is going
to have this year but it is seriously so
cute and it goes really cute with like
these pillows I'm just then I got this
one for downstairs it says let's
mistletoe I actually also low-key might
just go get another one of these because
I really want this in my room but I
think this would also look really cute
downstairs then I also got this pillow
just it's gonna be cute oh we got some
trees so much stuff and a little tree
then I got this reindeer thing it's
literally it must be styrofoam it's so
light
it was only this it's like eight bucks
suck it so we'll just we'll put that
there for now literally went crazy with
the wreaths initially I was gonna have
this one in my room but then I found
this one which I freaking love picture
that so cute and then I found this tree
it just it just goes together and it's
so muggy rots and plates for the kitchen
because I really wanted to have like the
table set Glen looking like super cute
oh and then how cute is that and then I
got this like gold silverware to go with
I'm like guys I'm going full out it's
kind of that it's kind of embarrassing
it's like the biggest target hall I
think I've ever done and I'm going
through it's so click right now pala
basic but I got some makeup wipe because
I needed some makeup wipes and blankets
what else I know most of you guys really
want to see all of this and me
decorating every room and stuff like I
know the majority of you guys don't care
and like you just want to like see
decorating videos I'm just accepted
there's gonna be some haters but like
that's cool you know just don't don't
crush my Christmas spirit honestly last
year we barely even decorated the
apartment for Christmas because we knew
we were moving so it just felt so
pointless to buy a whole bunch of stuff
is that an excuse to go crazy this year
update time so it is so much freakin
later from the last minute you saw me
small is again feels so weird if you
didn't see the vlog it was the vlog
where I showed you guys cutting my hair
I had explained that I had already paid
for these extension actually already
rescheduled my appointment and other
time so I kind of wanted to push this
one a little back so I could have my
hair shorter longer but I was honestly
like you know I've already paid for I've
already rescheduled I'm just gonna go
through this appointment
right away I was realizing how much I
like long hair again that was like oh my
god I've missed it I still love the
short hair definitely gonna do that
probably after this again but like maybe
like a really short but yeah right now
for now we're rocking the Victoria
Secret curls perfect for the holidays
speaking of holidays
I started decorating a little bit but I
think I'm gonna finish all that tomorrow
just cuz there's so much to do anyways
thank you guys so much for watching this
vlog I love you and I'll see you
tomorrow with new one bye
