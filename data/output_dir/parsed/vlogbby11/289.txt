so I think Ashley I decided that we are
just gonna have a Netflix night so I
briefly mentioned that like binge watch
Netflix sounds so amazing honestly I'm
editing to do and it should be good okay
so since I should be home for a while
now I'm going to start putting away my
makeup to-to-to-to just finished so I
actually missing right now would you
guys want to see a makeup collection
although it wouldn't be like a full full
full makeup collection but at least like
the gist of how I keep my makeup let's
do it okay so if you guys saw a while
ago actually got the Alex Stein drawer
set that literally everyone has from
Ikea and a lot of people use it to store
their makeup which is the reason why I
got it so it fits perfectly here in my
room just like this little light corner
right here
top drawer I have some random stuff I
don't really use this drawer too much
but this is like products that I've
already been using so this one's kind of
like a really random drawer there's a
whole bunch of eyeliners here pencil
sharpeners some lipsticks that I don't
really use but I have them in case I
want them I definitely need to go
through this and clean it out and just
figure out what I want to keep what I
want to get rid of but I'm this is like
a real straight-up makeup collection
this second drawer where I keep all or
most of my palette so to my favorites
are the Kat Von D one specifically the
face one and as you can tell I'm
obsessed with it I've hit pan on three
of them and then I got the eye palette
from her not too long ago I really
really like this palette especially cuz
it's all matte I'm pretty sure tartlet
in bloom palette which I really like I
bought this also not that long ago but I
really like it it's really good palette
I have a NARS palette Too Faced naked so
yeah that's what's that's what's there
next in here okay so just gonna just
lame this now because you're about to
see a whole bunch of new makeup and you
guys are like what this being a youtuber
or any like social-media influencer I
guess you could say a lot and a lot a
lot of brands want to send a products to
you hoping that you'll like show it
feature it and all that stuff so I have
a lot of new makeup actually think I
have more brand new makeup than actual
makeup because of that but I'm
constantly like giving it away give it
Emma what I'm constantly giving it away
to friends and family
and just anyone's yeah you're about to
see a lot of new makeup so trying to
discipline them yeah yeah it's basically
like Sapporo in here so over here are
some bronzers from Too Faced I want to
go through those and see which is my
favorite Smashbox a lot of their liquid
lipsticks um to face concealer the
Smashbox primer water I've actually
bought this before and I have a trial
size of it which I love so so much so
it's a really good product love that and
false lashes back here puts in that
drawer this drawer oh snap has some lip
stuff from Tarte and there's some NARS
there's this mini blush which is so so
cute some eyeshadows I can open it with
one hand come on there we go really
really gorgeous eyeshadows and then
benefit they always like kill it on the
packaging they have really cute stuff so
they sent over a whole bunch of brow
stuff not too long ago and I actually
used this one oh focus come on and I
really like it so precisely at my brow
pencil it's really good so you guys
remember this this is the tarte like
crazy huge concealer it's actually
called the shape tape concealer I'm
obsessed with this this is my favorite
concealer I've ever used as of now I am
obsessed with it I love it so so so much
so I definitely recommend this one I've
been using it every single day since
that oh my gosh crazy concealer blog
where I should try this for the first
time we have some color pop there's some
Sigma stuff back here some brushes some
palettes from Tarte like many ones I
think those are perfect for traveling
yeah that's about what's in here as you
guys can tell like none of this is
really organized I need to reorganize it
it used to be next to our more makeup
now you guys won't judge me okay so in
here I have a lot of mascaras like all
my backup mascaras are here benefit
hoola bronzer and I don't know if you
guys can tell but um that's my name it's
crazy so yeah it's like really cool our
Smashbox stuff that's an that's drawer
now this drawer is the drawer below me
hi obviously I have my mirror which I
love this mirror use at all time and
this bag back here I keep all of my
makeup brushes so I just keep that right
there and then here is the wonderful
glamor caddy if you've watched my vlogs
for a while now you would know what the
glamour caddy is it's just this thing
from Target that I got that I'm kind of
obsessed with because it's just it's so
easy to do my makeup with and stuff what
is my hair day come on Thanks so this is
where I keep all of my everyday makeup
and I'm gonna go through this a little
more detail because this is stuff that I
really really like
I really want you guys to try out
starting over here we have primers eye
primers lip balms tweezers eyelash glue
we have foundations I usually use the
tart tart Amazonian clay as you can tell
this is like gone empty I really like
that and if I want more coverage the Mac
Studio Fix fluid is an amazing
foundation that I've used for a really
long time ech here I have concealers
obviously the tart shaped tape one and
this one is a two-faced one over here we
have powders of Laura Mercier
transparent powders what I use to set my
foundation I have a NARS blush and then
this is the one that I basically use
every single day I can't even read the
name I want to say it with wait what is
breath of plum from Mac I love like
plummy pink colors for like blush or
anything so this is like my blush of
these everyday I have champagne pop
highlighter some eye shadows back here
but I do usually use one of the palettes
for my eyeshadows makeup sponges here I
have some kind of lip kits as well as
some MAC lipsticks anastagia dip brow
Mac gel fluid line that's like my
favorite eyeliner ever these are the two
mascaras I've been using lately the
Tarte one and then the Too Faced better
than sex one if I don't use the honest
taja dip brow I use the honest taja brow
definer because it's a lot easier to
apply is basically my everyday makeup
and stuff that I love like no other okay
moving on this is where I keep all my
curling iron straighteners blow dryer
whatever stuff that I used to wash my
makeup brushes like the Sigma globe and
then the little Tower thing and then
down here is where I keep most of my
like skincare makeup products that I
have so there's a lot of their spacewalk
shampoo makeup remover wipes sunscreen
all that all that stuff and I am
officially out of breath that was at my
makeup collection that is where I store
all of my makeup obviously I don't want
this to be an hour-long video of me
going through every single shade and
color and everything so I keep all of my
makeup and yeah so that is everything
