that public right now yeah yeah
mangas both lungs oh hey guys still been
a bit and good news I just put up my
main channel video and my vlog like

like two hours now that's what's going
on I heard kind of crazy because I
washed it this morning so it's like poop
yeah that's done I'm going to start
getting ready because today actually
have a shoot I'm going to shoot with on
the fine brothers to do youtubers react
so I'm going to try my hardest to get
some footage I mean I can't show what
I'm reacting to but at least like show
you guys when I'm there and Stefan and
afterwards I'm going to meet up with
Nicky and then hopefully tonight on
Ashley and parent and I are going to go
to Hill so I'm really excited for that
it's been such a long time since I've
been and it's like one of my favorite
churches ever in LA amazing that's
what's going on okay so there is anyways
I'm going to like get ready you know get
out of these the PJs I don't have to
leave for like two hours so I'm very
pumped about that quo and I are just
going to chill I closed the morning
bings you look closely so Ashley I have
actually been talking a you know like in
the beginning stages like obviously this
isn't going to happen anytime soon but
we've been talking about if we should
get another dog or not because we feel
like Khloe's kind of lonely like she
just been like you know and like that
happens to one of our other dogs when we
were still living at home so we got
another dog and then like we did they
play all the time it's just good to have
like a buddy so I'm not saying we're
getting another dog but we have been
like open to it obviously like we want
to move first but um I don't know so
yeah
oh yes we did go on a long walk this
morning literally like no Serena's
Khloe's you clean please your toy will
be here too what game are you playing
the yeah like again not saying we're
getting a dog anytime soon
have been like seriously talking about
it seriously like so weird though
because I cannot picture our life before
Chloe now I feel like once we get
another dog we're going to say the same
exact thing about now like oh my god I
can't remember what life was before we
had to the only thing is we do travel so
so much so my parents always watch Chloe
honestly they're like all for us getting
another dog so as long as they're fine
to doggie sit when we're gone our family
might get a little bigger you want that
our butter you want our brother okay
let's put some makeup on my face we need
that
okay crashes I mean I think there's a
nice out of today I kind of want to do
that so let's bring this up oh
definitely need that I'm kind of wanting
to do eyeshadow I don't know what's how
I want to use but you know I haven't
treated like it this is the tart man
your palate and I haven't tried it yet
so let's try it out hair is going up
okay yeah I'm going to watch some
YouTube videos probably also read some
comments from the videos I posted and
while I'm doing my makeup - slowly start
putting everything into this container
even kind of covered using this bag not
museum so much I'm like okay time over
okay so I'm gonna call this way and then
do something with my hair I think I how
fast was I talking right there that was
that was too much I think I'm going to
straighten my hair today because like I
said I just watched it and I mean I'm
kind of liking it I just wish it would
stay like this all day but I know that's
not the case yeah we're just gonna fix
it up a little bit happy time so did my
hair steer right actually I feel like my
makeup looks kind of weird today because
my eyebrows are lighter I don't know
okay so I'm all ready and I just just
packing up and I figured I should say
bye pumpkin run smelvin okay yes okay
so here's an outfit I have on a choker
from Urban Outfitters my jack is also
some Urban Outfitters is by the brand
members-only if you're wondering - my
shirt is from Verizon although these
pants you can sir Ashley's are from
PacSun and honestly like I mean I like
them but I feel like they're not as
flattering honestly I don't know how I
feel about them I feel like they're not
as flattering as my Topshop ones but
honestly I'm too lazy to change we're
going to keep them and then I'm wearing
my Nikes I feel like I look weird today
I don't know I don't know about weird I
feel like I could really different today
and I think it's a combination of my
straight hair with the bangs with the
lighter eyebrows wearing more eye makeup
like I just feel like I look really
different anyways let's go
whatup guys so I just got to LA and I'm
walking over to go to I'm guessing the
studio where they film like peachy Birds
reaction stuff that really should be
really fun I think I think we're doing a
few episodes because kind of would be
important to camp Harris
oh my god you guys I'm not I'm not
allowed to say what it was but I had to
react to some singing is that I am still
shaken up over it and I hope this
episode comes up quickly get a lotta
happiness I'm gonna smell okay I'm not
okay
oh man ah I lived it dead we got down
already laughs doctor God problem
anyways the shoot went really well I'm
currently going to go ahead over to
downtown and pick up Nikki and because
she was doing a shoot there and I think
we're going to go get some earth and
just kind of hang out for the night good

Nikki and then we all went to Hillsong
