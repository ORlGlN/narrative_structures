neon with Sierra who just decided to
have like a picture type of day and like
go take pictures for Instagram and like
go get lunch stuff so I'm gonna go head
out to LA in like an hour or so okay is
it just me but I feel like no one's
really uploading that much lately and it
really bugs me because my sub box is
just empty all the time set aside about
these I went in just okay now we're
about to do our eye shadow
currently applying false lashes and it's
totally reminding me of my last video
because not gonna lie to take me a
couple times so like I cut them all
let's try the next one it's funny some
days I'm like vomited one-take wonder
boom done other days I'll sit here I
think it's when I like think I'm gonna
do it in one try that I don't like when
I actually think about what I'm doing
math gonna lie mascara time if you're
wondering what I use I use the beer real
by benefit so I've been using honestly
for the past like year day maybe like
six months oh my gosh I didn't curl my
eyelashes that's what I did wrong oh I
thought something was different I was
like something is weird something is
weird no no no what look
this is snob from Mac wondering it's
like a bubble gum hot pink color which
is like my favorite lip color ever
okay so makeup is done this is the
finished look if you're wondering all
right hair time get up here
don't okay boys shower soon I always try
to like when I'm getting ready I try to
think of an outfit to wear so I can just
gonna like pick it out but I'm kind of
Lincoln and go and we are curling the
hair because I like my hair curled more
curled but I like it straightened
so the doorbell rings and I open the
door and there is this huge huge clock
but then I thought was from West Elm and
I remember that I ordered a chair for my
bedrooms I have this huge chair that I
really want to open but I don't know if
I have time and I'm like MERP lucky
think they gave me the wrong one oh oh
no moments of truth sorry
oh wait you taking me the right one so
big
hey totally upside down but it's this
like light dusty pink suede chair that's
gonna go in the corner remember I told
you guys it came a lot faster than I
thought it was going to so nice I'm so
excited this is a circle Oliver
found the instructions okay it seems so
simple almost done yeah I am so excited
it is made now I'm gonna quickly bring
into our room and finish getting ready
so fast yeah I am so excited I've like a
white rug that I'm gonna put here then I
feel like I need like a light and a
little corner table with whatever and
this can be at my little new editing
spot every single morning with my coffee
editing my vlogs I'm excited anyway as
Sarah said she was running late so it's
like wait I'm running late does anyone
else here hate making their bed because
I don't know if you can see this but I
like don't even try it's just like so
badly made like really bad and I have
way too many pillows too I need to get
rid of some think that body pillow
honestly I don't know how to put it like
I love sleeping with it but I don't want
it like on my bed I'm trying to find out
an outfit and then we can go for a walk
okay
okay so I was just watching on the vlog
that I uploaded today and I was reading
some of the comments and a lot of you
almost like 95 percent say that you like
text better and thumbnails so I really
wanted to I don't know just try to see
if I can make the thumbnail for Miss day
with text in it see if it like works at
all we're gonna try the problem is I
don't know what words to put normally if
it's like morning routine you put
morning routine but it's like why girls
takes forever to get ready in the
morning that's way too long of a title
to put everything so it's like do I just
put get ready why girls take from girls
take forever is that too much then I
guess what we're gonna do we're gonna
try see if it can look good and if not
then then that's that you know drinking
my tea on this is the crystal light
peach teets
oh good guys you try it I lost the lid
for my Starbucks cook it falls in there
so couldn't I do that putting my camera
on my teas I'm really hoping that it
doesn't um mom I don't know okay wait I
want to you kind of like it's blue
Ashley here okay so I think I decide on
this I think I actually do like it
better with the timer I feel like it
just goes so much more with my channel
because I always have tags do you think
it looks good
but definitely out of it I'm not sure if
it's gonna like switch for everyone or
if it only switches for some people ten
tenten tenten good that's good dude the
only thing I really like about the
non-text is it's very obvious that like
I'm in front of the guy and for whatever
reason I really like like how that looks
as if he's like behind me but here you
don't see that as much oh well okay
