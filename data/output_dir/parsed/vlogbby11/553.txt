hey guys still I'm currently actually in
Ashley's bathroom
honestly it was because I was too lazy
to bring my curling iron from here to my
bathroom I actually do this quite
frequently anyways just finished getting
ready wait I need to have some hair wait
for it if I can fun hairspray I cannot
defend hairspray very well then maybe I
do have to go to my room oh we got it
Emma let me take your foot oh you're
like squat to this and this is the
Aussie of volume hairspray shampoo
shampoo Oh see awesome volume hairspray
honestly I don't like it it's like
really sticky and yeah you can actually
have the same one and honestly it's not
really good it's very sticky so you have
to like barely use any of it but it
smells really really good if you're one
who is very into Coolio this morning i
uploaded yesterday's vlog boom there we
are go watch it go watch it and yeah
it's currently twelve twelve twelve
thirteen so yeah it's currently twelve
thirteen and I had a plans this morning
and they changed and so I think I'm
going to go to Michael's as much as I
don't want to go I know I should cuz I
need some stuff in their rooms
yeah okay so it's totally random but
Renville actually sent over some red but
they're like new flavours of Red Bull
and I'm kind of curious what they taste
like I'm not gonna drink a whole one but
I definitely want to try one right now
so which one should I try there's
tropical wild cherry and we also have
orange so there's three of them and yeah
honestly I am NOT an energy drink person
really whatsoever as you guys know
coffee is my real bag but I'm really
curious to try one of these so I suppose
you could sip of one so which one should
I try I'm leaning towards tropical or
cherry so orange one what else
that's what else what up I don't know
chant wild cherry or tropical I wish I
could smell it through the kid I don't
know okay okay so we decided on tropical
definitely not gonna drink this I'm just
gonna take a couple sips mmm hello
okay here we go here we go here we go
here we go it smells very pineapple e
that actually tastes really really good
I remember like not caring at all for
their actual Red Bull drinks that's
impressive
really impressive okay so I'm gonna go
to Michael's and hopefully get some
stuff for some DIYs yeah so let's go hey
khlo I will be back I promise
at Michaels
okay Gotham Michaels and now I'm here at
Walmart and let's see if we can print
some stuff from there and yeah okay so
got some fabric and some sunflowers and
I think I need some other stuff too I
don't know what oh did you miss me baby
did you miss me so so shopping was
definitely a success I'm not gonna go
through everything just because I still
want it to be kind of like a soprano
like I don't want to give away too much
on what my DIYs they're gonna be incest
because that way you would knowing
everything that's gonna be in the video
you know look khlo it is mr. pig we love
mr. pig wait love me first animal play
love me okay so um I'm really hungry I
only had breakfast today definitely time
for lunch so I'm gonna go make a snack
and get to film it well let's start
filming filming okay so even though I
don't want to give away all of the DIY
since you guys follow my vlog channel
one of the perks is the fact that you
get to see a little behind the scenes of
filming so this one's pretty cool so I
think I'm gonna show you guys I bought
this like peep mold thing I'm doing an
Easter video I'm not sure when it's
gonna be out so obviously you have to do
treats for an Easter video so I'm like
melting my own peeps and then I'm gonna
put marshmallow on top it looks so good
we're currently melting the chocolate
right now really really hoping that it
turns out good because it's not that
would be it epic fail got some peeps
yeah we got some chocolate mm-hmm and
it's melting of course I totally rips
the instructions like the one that I
actually need to read okay this is what
connects like jiggle and move it and
just make sure that it gets like
completely smooth it out it's kind of
hard to do this with one hand cuz I'm
trying to vlog for you guys it's working
it's working except the middle ones
totally aren't dozens are we're just
gonna keep doing this I guess and then
as I put it in for another 30 seconds
they're in the freezer so single morning
I don't know if you guys don't notice
but that's probably why I feel like I'm
very bored right now because I'm just
like what do I do
so those are cooling right now and yeah
I was going to do another DIY but I
cannot find my gold spray paint and then
I started thinking wait how about have I
had gold spray paint like I think I have
but then I was trying to think of an
actual DIY where I used gold spray paint
and I cannot think of it for anything
I found the silver not the gold oh my
gosh you guys they turned out so cute do
you see that oh my gosh they're called
peak pops so that's the actual peep and
then there's the chocolate on the back
and it is cool because you can use like
either side if you neither use the
marshmallow side or the chocolate side I
am in love oh my gosh I'm so excited I'm
gonna rolling bub
