good morning guys so today is Tuesday
and Shay's a filming day as you guys are
most of you probably know Tuesday's are
usually like our hard core so many days
where we film like basically all day
this morning I got up to let Chloe out
took a walk beat breakfast I don't know
that's interesting and I edited and
uploaded yesterday's vlog so it is up go
watch it notice that I say that in every
single blog but if you're watching I
mean I I feel like most of you watch all
the vlogs
so is it pointless to be like go watch
it I don't know yes it was just so much
fun so being able to like look back
editing the vlog I was like oh that was
really fun so Sierra you're watching
them I had a lot of fun and we need to
do it mob okay I'm actually really
excited with how the thumbnail turned
out for it so Friday Friday I thought it
turned out so cute so that's um super
excited about it and let's while we're
at it let's show you guys there it is
let's watch it mom boom there's me yeah
