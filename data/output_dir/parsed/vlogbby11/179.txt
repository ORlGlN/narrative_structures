yes 21st I believe because a week ago is
Valentine's Day which is the 14th Oh
anyways we are currently going to
breakfast today is actually Ari's last
day visiting us which was really sad for
everyone who's wondering she's just been
a friend of ours for oh my god 8 or 9
years just like for so long but she
lives up in NorCal like northern
california so so I don't see her all the
time at but she always comes and visits
every now and then so yes see ever going
to breakfast and then our last day
hanging out we might do some touristy la
things why not ari your dad day I'm
going to miss you you're leaving Mason
why leaving me I'll come back come back

it's so loud here I'm sorry I got an
omelet and then a side of fruit I got

got it on the side there's Ashley and
Tommy so yeah you're gonna eat our food

hey guys so we were back at the house
and I just did my makeup the little one
pen so I wasn't planning on having my
lip be this intense today but I used the
color that I didn't like and I use
another colors try to fix that I didn't
like it and the next thing I know I
realize I should just probably do
something dark too sick what I've done
before
yes not filming today or anything so I'm
not really in some bother doing my hair
I probably should wash it but I think
I'm just going to wear a hat like the
one I was right earlier really really
want to go to the nasty elf store today
because directly closing down so
everything is super discounted so we
really want to do that today a guy
coming for our internet or Wi-Fi is down
if I haven't been uploading a try to
upload one my vods last night but it
wasn't working which sucks so yeah that
gonna kind of sucks but they didn't say
what time they're coming which you still
know they just do what tender coming
there are so PSICOM between nine and ten
and they're still not here and it's
think noon oh yeah it's 12:00 it's just
kind of frustrating anyways I do want to
plan the video that's going up this week

it'd be like the start of something new
on my main channel like a new series

can't you guys I have been trying to get
this vlog out for the longest time
because I have a hot spot on my phone
and even though the Wi-Fi is down I can
still use mouth well for some reason
some reason there is no signal right now
it could be from all those rain recently
I have no idea it's just not uploading
on my phone so I think I'm going to go
over to a coffee shop and try that Wi-Fi

at the pink wall and it's funny
concluding and come here for a picture

it yeah might as well grab a picture and
there's like so many people this is the
reality behind Instagram like bumping
elbows sightings you get a spot on the
wall I'm going to mood right now anyways

so we got out of the the storm is
literally so much paparazzi across the
street like right where we were I said
I'm kind of serious

see celebrities all the time but in
reality real steps not like I don't know
I don't know you guys I literally just
ran into Erin and Austin we were walking
right like in front of each other and
it's funny we didn't even know like we
didn't recognize each other and I turned
around I saw them and I was okay but I
miss it so much
