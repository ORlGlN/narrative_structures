you guys know if you follow me on
Twitter or Instagram and that I was on
vacation for ten days I were visiting
some family in Illinois and it was so
much fun because my aunt and uncle owned
a lake house we were staying there and
it was so nice and then we went up to
Springfield and met my other uncle and
we hung out there for a couple of days
and it was just so relaxing and awesome
the problem was I had no Wi-Fi
whatsoever so I really didn't vlog too
much there I have a couple of clips it
was so relaxing though just being able
to be there we went tubing and skiing
but do not worry I did do some filming
there because it was so so pretty
