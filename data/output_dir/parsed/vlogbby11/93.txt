wear that still fun fact this is kind of
funny but it still has the tag on it now

that and I saw that there was a like a
human one dude okay I need that okay so
I got three things well I got three
clothing items one ooh I'm actually
loving this the material is exactly what
I thought it would be they're like
high-waisted pants like your trouser
pants but they're pink and they're
high-waisted I feel like this is gonna
be really cute with like a crop top I'm
really vibing with it
this thing looks really cool so it's a
bodysuit but wait for it there's like
snaps on the side for the arms and it's
a hoodie but it's a bodysuit but it's a
hoodie that's so it's like super
different for me but it's super casual
like I feel like that would even be key
with those Pam and then I got these
pants they're a little more peace than I
thought they would be you've probably
seen a because I feel like everyone in
their mother has hands like this they're
like the sweats that have the button
snaps on the side like who doesn't want
come and you can like snap them open oh

an end of school Isha there's only a few
more videos left that's okay oh we are

works like you can hear the ticking in
it but it's definitely not the proper
time it says it's 2:22 what time is it
up daytime it is currently 304 and the
clock is not that off but it's
definitely a fun fact I only put a
battery in it because for the school
Lygia intro which everyone knows
hopefully I wanted the clock to be
ticking so I've through battery in there
but I really didn't even bother to oh no
we did change the time because I wanted
it to be at morning time for that intro

boat around
