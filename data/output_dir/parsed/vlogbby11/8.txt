hee-jae's that'd be a huge help to do
that so let's do it okay guys Ashley's

bit and fashion I also leave for New
York soon and my parents are coming over
tonight and it's the last night all of
us are gonna be together before we leave
for New York so while were in New York

subscribers on her YouTube channel so we
wanted to have an early celebration so
that way we can celebrate even though we
won't be together when it happens so I
ordered some cupcakes they just came but
I need to hide them because they were
supposed to come a lot later but they
didn't where should I hide them
