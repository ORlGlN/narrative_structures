were so tired I uploaded my beautycon of
log yesterday this morning so you guys
should go watch that Oh
so if you haven't watched my past two
vlogs we are currently in Dallas cuz we
were here for beautycon Texas okay guys
so it is now see what time it is is 243
and I can't even sit out I don't know
why I showed you and I'm getting ready I
just honestly have been so lazy today
Janine and Mia already left a couple
hours ago maybe our two ago so it's just
me I'm chillin my flight isn't until
five o'clock so I think I'm just going
to finish getting ready really quick I
have a little bit of time to kill on so
I think it's going to head over to the
airport early maybe I can like edit
there or something but yeah I was
finishing my makeup realize I haven't
blogged in a while I'm watching some
movie I have no idea but it's cold
finish the makeup and there's nowhere to
put my blog camera I seem gonna make
like a tripod open this book okay wait
Oh totally got it you definitely have to
improvise so we're just gonna have a
binder oh that's my view by the way I
never showed it yesterday or today super
super cute worse in damn town Dallas
boom so excited hope lead is involved
when he looks in the mask garrulous last
left part it's kinda reminds me of like
old old old tutorials that I used to do
like years ago because I didn't have a
tripod so I just put my little flip cam
on some like books and boxes and whatnot
the row back I'd be like and now I'm
pulling with us yeah I know
boom kidding we're gonna build it in
that finales gotta have some lip gloss
this is angel by Mac if you're wondering
okay so I think I'm going to pack
everything up what let me put something
up here okay so I think I'm just going
to start packing up and head to the
airport so let's go so I actually just
checked into my flight or the airline
checked in I checked in I'm on my phone
for my flight and to my luck life is
delayed so instead of leaving at 5:00
it's delayed an hour and 20 minutes so
now I leave at 6:20 each kind of sucks
because I was planning on leaving right
now to the airport and even then I would
have been there really early so now I'm
like do I just chill here kind of bored
I'm not hungry
really I already had Starbucks today I
could get more star buckle home no I
could edit my video I could finish
editing that but I don't know I was
really planning on editing on the plane
so I don't want to like edit too much -
I have nothing to do on the plane
I have everything packed up though I
also cleaned up a bit because this was
seriously like such a disaster so I felt
bad for the cleaning ladies I put all
our trash right here and Mia's random
shoes she was like Lina's I don't want
them and I was like okay it was early as
it is I think I'm actually just gonna
head to the airport because that way I
can just like get checked in get through
security and whatnot go to a restaurant
there or something and chill maybe I can
edit I don't know I pulled out a hotel
so I think I what I'm gonna do here was
go Airport BAM
Hey so got through security and I have
so much time to kill but I found out
that there's a Whataburger here and so
many people told me I have to try that
I'm gonna get some we should see
supercilious
but you guys know how it is
we got a program and some fries and a
vanilla shake film thing is literally so
huge I totally forgot ketchup for my
fries I'm kind of sad it's like so
though I'm kind of done because I can't
open my water bottle for anything
so now it's 5:44 plane is not here still
delayed fun fun
I got Starbucks for the second time
today I'm so I travel and glacier this
is so fun

good thing
