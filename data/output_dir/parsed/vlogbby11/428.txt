seen the title so obviously you know
what's going on but like I haven't said
it yet
so yeah I having our appointment today
and I don't know what it is this is so
like strange and a lot of people don't
understand it I never have to touch with
my roots I don't know what it is I think
it's the shade that my natural hair my
hair is like naturally like a light ashy
Brown no matter what hair color I get or
I've had I mean obviously I've never
gone like neon but every single time
I've dyed my hair the regrowth like
looks fine it just turns into this
natural ombre like everyone's always
asking me if I got my hair done recently
I'm like no this is legit like natural
ombre like I've let it grown out so much
like it's just it's too whatever so I
haven't dyed it in such a long time so
I'm really excited to go I also just
need a haircut so bad like I don't even
have bangs anymore so yeah that's what's
going on my appointment is at 3 o'clock
and then beforehand I'm gonna meet up
with Dawn Marie I think we're gonna get
lunch and coffee and all that stuff oh
my gosh honestly I would tell you guys
if I knew what I was asking for but I
don't even know what I'm asking for I'm
just gonna talk to the stylist and be
like yo what do you think is gonna look
the best like what shade what haircut
this is it before before or you can
close you need to go to the hair salon -
huh we need to go to the groomers cuz
we're dirty and we need to hear them
anyways I'm kind of running a little
late big surprise there so I'm gonna
pack up and let's go to LA
hey guys so I have no idea if um this
lighting is even good on so I'm on my
way to meet up with John Murray we're
gonna go to Alfred's coffee get some
food I feel like this is like not
focused or it's like blurry or something
that matter wait that's so better I
think that's one er I don't know
question of the day if you could know
anything about your future what would it
be be really big
we're really little its own afternoon
let me on the comment I don't know happy
to my hair today and I figure that's
okay because I'm gonna go get a time
let's just air dried all the way here so
hopefully it hopefully looks different
and we're in beautiful traffic so we are
here yeah haven't seen you in forever
so I got a rap and a mini salad what'd
you get what'd you get I just got a
regular latte I totally should I got
vanilla and then coffee cake
okay so we are taking some pictures
because that's what we do my hair
appointment is in like half an hour
ish so that's exciting just on Melrose
Avenue
beste gal damn cute stuff is just small
the want Santa Monica's bigger Oh laughs
bring people and then this oh I use what
you shoes I look like a two rooms so
we're now hair salon and this is the
before it's like a Tom Brighton normal
no yes
spider haha captain humming I'm a little
nervous but I'm excited
you
hey guys oh my god my hair is different
I don't think so yes
obviously my hair is blonde and I still
don't know how to think about it I like
it I do like it it's just different not
used to it I'm sure there's gonna be a
lot of people who don't like it and
that's totally fine I've no idea how
long I'm gonna have this it may be like
a month or two it may go back really
soon it may go back in like two years I
have no idea but yeah I think it's
awesome for a change I think it's
perfect for like New Year's just like
new change new start everything lighting
is a little weird so it's a little more
yellow
I feel like however if you're interested
in hair because of the hair dye I had
before it was harder to lift this middle
part so the ends are like perfect
the roots are like perfect but if you
can see slightly like this middle parts
a little more warm so it's gonna be a
little lighter eventually I just have to
like go back in a little bit actually
I'm going back Wednesday to kind of
touch-up it a little little bit yeah oh
my gosh flashback to the vlog where I
was like I'm gonna be blood and super
exciting I think the best part about
this is people will actually believe
that absolute I are real sisters yeah
biological sisters we've always
struggled with that every time where
people are like oh are you good best
friends or like no we're actually
sisters and they're like well I guess
like my hair is way more yellow than
yours so cuz we didn't lighter but yeah
everyone's like are you sure like are
you biological are you playing real
sisters or teal I'm adopted cuz my whole
family has darker hair and I'm good one
has red hair and dad have hazel eyes and
grandpa had blonde hair with blue eyes
so that's right I stem from that's where
she comes to the other side of the
family club what you do with that you
see that's my new Betty you dirty babe
so yes that was the big surprise I like
I can't even realize how fast this
happened if that make sense definitely
like how we have like some darker at the
top so it looks more like realistic
opposed to just like foam let me know in
the comments if you liked it no hard
feelings if you don't I'm not gonna take
it personal but yeah it's weird
it's weird I don't know hey guys so
update time it is now 12:15 a.m. is late
and I
I haven't even started editing this long
trying to say if I just started tonight
or if I should edit it all in the
morning and sorry this lighting is like
not cute it's like blue here and then
yellow there and then all craziness
trying to find some music to use for my
