I've been waiting for this day for so
long as you can tell by the title um I
have a huge huge surprise for Mia for
her birthday and his birthday's coming
up and uh yeah we're gonna do something
so the deal is is that this huge
surprise and she doesn't know what it is
but you guys are gonna get a little bit
of an insight probably gonna wait to
public this video until she knows what
the surprise is just so like nothing
gets ruined but basically I'm so proud
of myself I came up with this like all
by myself and I'm just like yeah I'm so
excited I've been home at my apartment
hi I'm heading back over to Mia's house
today's Friday she's been wanting to go
on a trip for a really long time long
story short I asked her the other day if
I could steal her for this weekend so
obviously her birthday's at first so I'm
yeah birthday hello no idea what we're
doing and I'm gonna make it a mission to
where she doesn't find out what we're
doing like I'm purposely gonna say
things to kind of throw her off I'm
surprised
so I came home mostly to pack literally
at 99% of the reason why I came back to
my apartment today was literally just to
pack for this weekend I'm gonna give her
her present tonight and it's a thumb
drive and on the thumb drive there is a
video on it so when she plugs it into
your computer it's a video of me being
like hey we so this weekend we're going
on an adventure

local it's gonna be fun

could just wait for you guys to see it
the huge maybe I should do that maybe I
don't know I'm kind of torn maybe I
should keep it a surprise for you guys
