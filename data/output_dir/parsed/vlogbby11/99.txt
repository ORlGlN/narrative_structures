welcome back to the vlog what is up it's
been a bit so as you can tell I am full
foetus today a.k.a no makeup what is up
today is on Tuesday Tuesday cuz
yesterday was Labor Day and I did
absolutely nothing so thumbs up this
video if you did absolutely nothing to
we're in the same boat what were your
Labor Day plans if you celebrated Labor
Day did you swim to do the beach did you
do nothing always just love vlogs at
home I feel like that's why when I
travel I don't vlog as much just because
I love vlogs oh my god I just saw these
and I totally forgot that I had that one
is mine one is Chloe's if you saw that
vlog you are the best oh my god need a
photo shoot together
speaking of photo shoot I am so freaking
excited because tomorrow I'm doing a
shoot for my channel and I am you just
like like school Isha was lit like this
is about to be so freakin amazing not
gonna tell you yet and I'm not gonna
show you guys until you see it but then
afterwards I'm gonna like I'm still
gonna vlog tomorrow and stuff and show
you guys like a legit behind-the-scenes
do do to do to do to do boo while I'm
here I've been looking up a whole bunch
of like pictures and stuff to get here
I'm back on the whole like home decor
kick which I'm really excited for so I'm
really excited to finally get some some
pictures some painting some something a
little something over here attendance
indented good morning no Chloe Club
love me look at me hey hey Doc you look
extra chunk you need a haircut
maybe she always lays on the tile
because it's really cold so she's always
just like Oh
Navi oh we got some coffee pretty I'm
pretty excited about that oh my god you
guys how sad is this oh my gosh hashtag
solutions done I'm still not over this I
already missed the intro and it hasn't
even been a full week yet
I was literally like walking to my room
and then I just walked up to the studio
and only while I'm here I might as well
open it I've had so many freaking
questions of everyone wondering what I'm
gonna do with this room now that schools
done actually have a few random ideas
but obviously like I bought all this
stuff so I'm not gonna like get a
storage you know anything like the
number one thing is I know the lockers
are staying because they're bolted into
the wall and it would be and they're so
freakin heavy it would just be a lot of
work to get them down to the garage when
they can totally just like stay here you
know so I feel like I also do school
stuff like throughout the year so these
are staying here for sure everything
else might go like in a closet or
something do you have any specific ideas
other than a closet what do you what
would you do with this room like if you
were me what would you do
we'll leave the comments in below like
below I get I still want to keep it
school for sure keeping these but we
have you know option also I still have
to unpack and do some laundry from being
on tour so I should probably learn oh
you know what else I should also do
other than that I should most definitely
finally clean up all of this makeup it's
been sitting here for like two weeks I
started organizing it and then I just
completely stopped because I was really
busy back to like uploading twice a week
so I just like so much stuff of it like
I feel like I actually have a few hours
where I could probably do this today
that would be so nice like look at this
this is actually embarrassing like how
much makeup I have I see like figure out
what it wants throw away but I want to
give away what I want to keep yes yes
yes oh man this is gonna be such a
freaking project should I do it should I
do it okay
fine I'll do it okay so I am so freaking
visual that I wanted to get post-its so
I can put them on the dresser so I can
know what is going in each drawer so if
I can do this one-handed probably not
let's see
face eyes face
that's at four and then maybe to new no
no okay
all right so I'm gonna put face here
let's put the new new ones on the bottom
cheeks lips so I put like face so this
will be like foundations concealers all
that fun stuff what is even in here like
what is this yo old school my secret
candy stash okay
update time it is a lot later but I've
gotten so much done but I still feel
like it doesn't even look like there is
a freaking dent in everything but wants
to give you a quick update here's an
update on the pile of makeup that was
everywhere it still is everyone guys
watch this do you see this yo this is
the foundation and concealer drawer it
looks so freakin good I think I have so
many shape and tape concealers to last
me like five years I'm very excited
about that there is that's here we have
the cheek and highlight like blush and
highlight and contour drawer there's
still a lot more I know has to go in
here but that is that for now and then I
move down to the lips your lips is the
one thing that I feel like companies
always send every single shade so I have
a ton back there I have a ton right here
still kind of organizing this this is
the hardest one to organize so far just
because there's so many different kinds
like ideally I'd love to have like
liquid lipsticks here and then my
everyday lipsticks and then lip line I
don't know we're still working on that
progress guys progress hello guys
welcome to day two of this blouse I was
gonna do a separate vlog because I was
like yo guys I'm gonna be back on my
fucking now and my house fuck but
because we've been actually shooting all
freaking day for something really
exciting because of that I was like you
know what it's probably best if we just
don't we just don't blog I actually I
didn't mean to get more behind the
scenes but that is oh I should probably
take this this thing right here anyways
a little stressful just because like at
first angles weren't working and like I
didn't know what I wanted but then now
we got it I think you're gonna like it
no and
you ways not sure if I'm in frame not
sure okay let's so I got a package
