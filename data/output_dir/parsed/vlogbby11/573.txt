I'll take this and then Ashley Matt and
I three of us we went out to a
Cheesecake Factory for dinner because it
was really late and we did not want to
cook so we're like it let's go out to
dinner so tired I just completely forgot
to vlog I'm so sorry I know it's like
really annoying though since today's
vlog was a little shorter I decided to
do a little mini question / answer only
one question that I know a million of
you guys have been wanting to know I
think it's like one of the biggest
questions that people have for me
especially lately so congratulations to
everyone who stayed to the end of the
vlog you get to know question is where
did your snapchat name lead a Lou 11
come from in a video when I first
announced my snapchat I was like just
don't even ask about ever since then
I've had so many people asking me like
what does it mean where did it come from
every now and then if you hear me or my
family or anyone call me Lita and a vlog
because it's my nickname and like not
even just like oh yeah that's my
nickname like people like sometimes come
without like no my whole life people
have called me Lita because when I was
little I couldn't say Alisha and I would
call myself Aleta one time an elementary
school member like my sister and I and
to our friends we always used to make
movies and stuff so we made like a music
video thing and I was playing piano and
they called me Aleta lou freebush like
that was my name like starring a little
Lou freebish which is from Miss
Congeniality if you've seen that the
freebush obviously just got like knocked
out I was like no that's not happening
but
Leeloo like stuck like no other so much
to worry even my mom calls me Lu
like that's my nickname - my mom's like
yeah like I answered that so funny and
then 11 is my favorite number if you
guys did not know that that is where my
snapchat named Lilu 11 comes from we're
almost halfway through vlogmas ah oh my
gosh
my blinds keep making noises and it's
scaring me the raining outside are
supposed to rain tonight um but I think
it's pretty windy so it like it keeps
like making noises it scared me like
five times in a row not even kidding
yeah I'm going to go and I will see you
guys tomorrow for another vlog and yeah
bye
