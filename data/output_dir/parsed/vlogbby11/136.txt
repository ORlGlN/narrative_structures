extensions I low-key kinda want them
longer next time just because like like
slightly looks little work anyways
Ashley nice why do you leave me using me
to vlog by myself
Ashley and I have some random errands to
do so figuring out update you on what's
going on and yes just my phone she
always has my back
well sometimes in my quote idea without
Ashley Ashley has to our turn own a
camera this looks fun lit working not
work work slow keep thinking about
getting a Apple watch this would be so
handy look for all areas of life
Mia has one and she loves hers you
wouldn't expect her to be an Apple watch
person but she loved it so I feel like I
should like it yeah and every thought I
was ever ever but she was table pairings
we are going to look at camera strap
there's not many options and it probably
our fault for hoping that there was some
like cuter option is about you know it's
cool it's cool just to see you turkeys
with brown inq Mon hey guys what is up
it's actually a lot later now and I
really just wanted to end this vlog
