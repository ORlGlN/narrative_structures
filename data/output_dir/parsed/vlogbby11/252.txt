guys perfectly so I'm excited for this
epiphany that's so funny okay
our pictures nothing younger and I'm
like you know I bet I win every time
you guys I got so much done the video is
like completely ruffcut and stuff so I
saw a lot to do but it's done compared
to where I what at this point yeah so I
want to show you guys some of the new
goodies that I've gotten recently and
yeah so let's just get into it they
haven't makeup off we have a ton of
boxing kind of new makeup that we're
about to look at so let's do this first
things first I don't know if I told you
actually I didn't tell you guys that I
actually ordered the new or not the new
I ordered a new coke okay lip kit from
Kylie cosmetics I ordered a new lip kit
because I totally lost my last one I
don't know where to isn't it was my
favorite lip product ever like in the
world so I ended up just buying a new
one I accepted that I probably won't
find my other one and but watch now I'm
gonna find it because I got no one that
always happened and they actually have a
lip gloss and coke okay I didn't know so
I got that as well yeah so I got new a
Kylie stuff and then this is so much but
Clinique actually sent over a whole
bunch of lip product I'm so excited to
try these out I'm always looking for
like new lipsticks and I tested out one
of these and the color the quality
everything about it is amazing you guys
like I cannot talk about these even more
like oh I'm upset and then I got this
package from NARS and I was so excited
came this really pretty red color and
what it is and I sent over two of their
audacious lipsticks in the color and the
color Rita it's like their most famous
red lipstick color oh my gosh and I'm
pretty positive this is their holiday
packaging to a whole whole and this is
red so pretty
let me just put this in here and then
Smashbox actually said over their whole
holiday collection for 2016 it's the
call to light it up and I thought it was
really cute this is huge this is
actually huge but I thought this was
such cute packaging I am obsessed with
it it's like neon and like lights have a
contour blush and highlight palette and
then they have eyes contour and lips so
this looks a little JIT and last but not
least is this Smashbox
um gloss set I love the packaging I
think it's super cute for like Christmas
or holidays or just any presents that
you want to give people if there's a new
brand called poppin Sookie and it's
seriously like the new bags that are
launching and I follow the owners on
Instagram and seriously like this whole
it's seriously so cute oh my gosh one
second so they have a few main colors
but I got a pink one
and it says Alicia on the bottom which i
think is so cute and I love it right
like crossbody or as a fanny pack or as
a camera bag like there's so many
different ways to wear this I seriously
love this so expect some Instagram
pictures because it's literally like a
Tokyo so so so cute it even comes with a
strap and a little tassel thing there we
go
huge unboxing haul question do you guys
like what I do like unboxings and stuff
like this I mean I always assumed you
guys did but I want to ask you if you
don't I'll definitely stop but I always
just assumed for the most part you guys
like seeing these because I like
watching when people do hauls and
unboxings and stuff maybe I'll just do
swatches of some of this I think that
would be fun let's do it okay so I just
swatch so many colors they go on so nice
you guys I really am loving like I'm
really loving the matte one specifically
they honestly they all have like primers
and stuff so you can tell if they're
actually going to stay on for a long
time another thing that I love is I
don't know if you can tell but each of
these textures are different depending
on what the lipstick is like for
instance this one is a really sheer and
you can kind of see through it so that
means that it's a really sheer and
lipstick this one has some shine to it
so it is a lipstick and then these two
are matte so it shows that they're matte
lipsticks and I just thought that was
really cool I don't know like I'm kind
of obsessed but yeah love now I'm gonna
test out the lip kit I would really want
to okay so now I really want to test out
the Kylie lip kit one because I haven't
tried this blot before and I really want
to try it oh so that's what it looks
like I'm sure you guys have probably
already seen this if you're in today's
cuz this isn't a new gloss it's just new
to me so that's what it looks like so
pretty that's it right there so this
isn't right next to it oh my gosh so
pretty not wearing makeup otherwise I'd
actually put it on my lips right now but
yeah there are some of the swatches I'm
obsessed I love I love I love now I'm
gonna go wash all of this off but I'm
really excited I love playing with
makeup it's just like so much fun
MERP okay okay yeah you guys would be so
proud of me well I mean I think you'd be
proud of me I just edited so much
