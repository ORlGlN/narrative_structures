doesn't she does it all the time and she
doesn't stop
we're not really sure where she does
this the first person we're going to is
party was Wendy
and to be honest I wish we can do this
for all of supporters because this is
like actually really fun I know we
haven't started yet but I know that it's
going to be it's going to be a cool
experience yeah like I know Kathryn and

yes
so Wendy the driver wants to know if you
have a toilet at home because he has to
take a boo boo lip how does it feel to
