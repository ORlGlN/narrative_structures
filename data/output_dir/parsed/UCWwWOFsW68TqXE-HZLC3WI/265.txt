hey guys welcome back to our Channel
it's kind of blurry okay welcome back to
our channel guys so today I'm going to
be pranking Austin back
he's been pranking me over and over
again it's actually to the point where
he's pranking me off-camera which is
really annoying so I'm going to break it
today what I did was I got his friend's
number from his phone the other day and
I texted him and I was like hey listen
can you help me out with this prank so
he's going to be helping me with a car
robbery prank so what I'm doing is I'm
going to get mail and go to the gas
station and then stop into Starbucks
which I always do so he's not going to
suspect anything so I'm I'm going to get
gas oh wait someone's parked right
behind me
whoops so I'm going to get gas and then
I'm going to leave my keys in the car
and then go into Starbucks order while
in on FaceTime he's not going to think
anything about it because we always
FaceTime and I'm going to walk out and
the car's gonna be gone so I'm going to
see his reaction I'm not going to be
able to talk to you guys while I'm on
FaceTime because he can't see the camera
so we'll see how he acts how he responds
oh and another thing too is we have a
meeting in an hour
and I'm such a punctual person he would
never in a million years think that um I
would prank him right now because of
that reason but what I actually just did
is I just texted um the person who were
meeting with and I told him we're going
to be late so which worked out perfectly
so bye
all right guys so I'm parking right now
by the way I literally have no time for
anything
so I don't even know if I did my intro
right do you park in such a tight space
I'm trying to park in the closest oh
sorry out of order look it's out of
order
ah okay I'll prep this one over here
okay perfect all right so I'm texting
Trey right now he actually just texted
me saying he got here so
you should be here I know
like you should be in the area see him
so he's here
I think that's him right there okay
hi all right so I'm gonna say something
right now
I got him to shake my hands shaking look
at my end
when he answers I can't talk to you guys
anything can't talk
it's not answering
Hey
nothing just getting gas oh wait hold on
I forgot my card
Oh once again Hey
so yeah I'm just going to gas right now
yeah
I'm welcome to Starbucks you want
something yeah sorry
what do you want
peach cream lemon intellectually don't
forget that says strawberry freshman
I think that's another regime
anything else all right strawberry fresh
coconut milk
where my keys
okay Austin what
according to print the car
but you said you're getting gas no the
car is it here anymore
the fiery racer it's not here the car is
not here anymore
waiting the carbon so car the car the
car is gone I don't know where it is I
know I was getting gas with it let's key
in the car and I came in Starbucks and I
was facetiming you and now I know I'm
not
some people
the car was right over here look right
here Wow Wow let's run over there this
is gonna call number one right now all
right
all right he looks really bad alright
guys so he said he's on his way I think
he's kind of I but I'm not really sure
could possibly take
know where Trey is all their strength
which is I'm trying okay
try doing it can be here alright guys so
my boss is on his way by foot I feel
really bad so I don't know but I'm gonna
place the camera somewhere so somewhere
where he can't see it so when he comes
we can film this reaction we have like a
couple of minutes so I'm going to figure
out the best possible situation
but
yeah see how it goes
I'm literally trying to put this thing
up at Starbucks so that there's like
shade so you guys could see like what's
going on hold on one second oh I'm a
frickin genius
very good so I found the perfect spots
but the gun the camera when he gets here
soon action he hasn't called me so I
don't know what's going on from the
sound of it it sounded like he was going
to come here by foot and we only live
literally like when I say two minutes
away we look two minutes away but then
again he has L so he has to like make
sure that she's good dress her and stuff
so sorry I keep looking out because I
don't want him to see me at the camera
because then it just wants everything
get me to the freaking camera
I'm freaking I'm just looking around
like Eagle Eye over here alright guys so
when I see him coming I'll film that
part and then quickly put the camera in
my secret spot
okay
we feel like the best price ever
what's annoying is that there's so many
cars and so much going on right now and
there's so many people that like I
literally has to be Eagle Eye and like
look at every single look who they are
because reason why
I don't want to see the camera this is
where I'm at
this is what I mean by there's a lot
going on
there's only one one
still waiting and see
so eagle-eye over here
oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
oh my god he's right there all right
guys I gotta go I gotta go hide the
camera oh my god all right guys so my
secret spot didn't work over there so
I'm gonna put the camera right over here
I noticed this last minute and this is
probably the most perfect spot
he's everything rinsed well it does
fricken Starbucks
