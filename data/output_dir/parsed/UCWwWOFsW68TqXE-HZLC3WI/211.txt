so as you can tell by the caption of the
video today I'm going to be doing a
laxative prank on Austin so I'm here at
Target um I'm going to take you guys
with me I'm going to go get a couple of
things so I'm going to go into target
get the lock cities and then go into
Jamba Juice and put the lock students in
the Jamba Juice because we all know
that's awesome favorite thing to drink
and then I'm going to put when I get
home I'm going to place the camera
somewhere in the house probably in the
living room and then hopefully get some
kind of response from Austin so whether
is him going into the bathroom or him
saying that his stomach hurt oh thank
you to whoever send me this namaste
shirt I love you love you love you and I
love the shirt so I'm wearing it today
cybers check multi-vitamins
check prenatals check who's kidding guy
there's kidding all right guys so I'm in
digestive care now as you can see so I'm
here trying to pick out a laxative and I
was looking over at this one this one is
a powdered form laxatives I think this
is perfect for putting it in his drink
let's get that like alright guys so I
just pulled up to Jamba Juice so I'm
going to text him and see what he wants
I feel like if I ask him it's not going
to be as suspicious as me just bringing
in chumba shoes so I'm going to text
them right now I shouldn't call
yes hey um what do you want some Jamba
Juice Oh once ago why I'm going okay
Mario
so you said white gummy which I really
expected because I know you love that so
I'm going to get in a large white gummy
and then I'm going to check alright let
me go I'll be right back all right guys
so I just got awesome swag gummy and
then I also got myself a apples and
greens and then I also got another white
gummy for us so that when he's done
drinking this one or when he realizes
that this one isn't good oh my god
actually probably not going to realize
it until then so I'm going to drink this
whole one until he realizes that this
has
it does here does nothing
kinda reminds me when he almost killed
me with some hotdogs alright guys here's
why I have to remind all that I can't
drink out of this one so this one is the
one that I put the wax citizen and this
one is the one that doesn't have and
heat is when I get home I'm just going
to place this in the fridge behind some
stuff that he doesn't see it so that
after when he's done drinking his whole
laxative drink I can give him that one
if it's not like completely melted or
anything so are you guys ready I'm ready
alright guys so I just go home and I'm
trying to talk really low but I just hit
the other drink in the fridge and I'm
going to go hide the camera
