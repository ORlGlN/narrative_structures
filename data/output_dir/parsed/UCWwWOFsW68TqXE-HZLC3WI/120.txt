hey Stanley welcome back to our channel
guys what's going on everybody so today
we'll be doing the first prank we've
ever done on Brian for those who don't
know who Ryan is Ryan is Catherine's
brother and I will be honest I don't
know why we haven't got to this sooner
but today is the perfect day so Ryan
asked to borrow my car last night and he
came back super late and he's still
asleep it is currently like 9:00 a.m.
and he is still asleep so Catherine I
woke up this morning and thought of the
perfect prank and it's literally the
perfect opportunity so we've been
thinking of ways to prank Ryan or to get
him because he's always saying how we'll
never be able to get him just because he
knows us so well but we started thinking
really were like you know what let's
just do something which you would
literally never expect so his vision is
that like 100% yes yes like his vision
is the best vision which is gonna make
this prank that much better so we're
gonna bring this prank way back back
when we first started it's like one of
our very first pranks that we did on my
dad so today we're gonna do the car
scratch right so this is about to go
down we're about to create a scratch in
my car and the fact that he's not able
to see clearly is gonna make it that
much more believable for him so after we
create the scratch we're gonna call him
probably gonna wake him up and we're
gonna be like hey listen like we're on
our way to go run some errands and we
just noticed a scratch on the car so
like what the hell like when did this
happen did you get this last night and
knowing him he's gonna be like what
scratch oh hey I don't know what to do
no we're gonna make it no I make it kind
of small no a good size no no because
then that's like no this is not oh you
don't want to make you better feel like
you scratch the car because I'm gonna
want to tell him that it's a prank like
right when we tell
nah bruh ya don't get his ass savages I
don't know what you're talking about we
don't make it legit get his ass so who's
ready hey Stanley if you're ready make
sure make sure get this video thumbs up
right now patty that's kitty
so should we create in the back of the
front the front no no no low
isn't that where people usually hit
their cars incredibly they are a stem so
all you need to create a scratch is tape
and chalk I want to show you all right
now lay it out flat there you go it kind
of looks like a scratch just at the tape
yes yeah it's perfect it's gonna be one
yeah okay I've been waiting to get his
little nasty-ass what if he comes here
and he just like takes it a pop you
can't even see but that's the thing
though is women anybody see the scraps
or initial reaction is what they see
they're not gonna go up and like touch
it wait how do you know how to do that
what it looks so real to me at least
look look what I'm doing it's like look
defining the scratch let me see well
Austin is such a perfectionist this has
to be it looks good but wait look hold
the camera a little bit to square
something no no no no no no that looks
legit better what are you what are you
doing how many
okay baby I see you put your little
touch on it
yo that looks legit
I've evidence our baby now we got to
find a place to hide the camera
