no no no all right so we're getting
ready to leave but we forgot that Trey
and I picked up about a hundred of these
gingerbread houses so make sure you stay
tuned for tomorrow's video because we'll
be building the largest gingerbread
house in the world it's gonna be so big
that elves revealed a fitness model for
me all right guys we are now here at the
pet store I don't know about you guys
but I'm excited we were on the mission
to find the best pet for EM so as you
guys know us as a family we are not
ready for a puppy just yet we have to
first start with some small so L can
prove to us that she can take care of a
dog so first we want to see if she's
responsible enough to take care of this
small thing first before we get her a
dog if she is did we get her dog if
she's not in no dog
so let's find something small bro should
we get a lizard and should we get a bird
should we get a snake what about a
guinea pig
well they should we get a mouse just
getting this boy working out for the
Olympics fish perhaps excuse me sir
we need your prettiest fish that's what
my one-year-old daughter she wants the
prettiest fish you got though she's
picky real picky so he said these ones
are good for just a bowl right by
themselves yeah okay I mean if you
wanted to do a tank with a small filter
you can but you don't have to okay
cool generally just damn so these fish
are pretty easy to take care of yeah
it's my one-year-old daughter she'll be
responsible enough to get a dog later on
oh cool thank you sir appreciate you
excuse me sir
yep you haven't have an orange one by
the name of dream alright guys so
picking a fish is a lot harder than I
thought because I like them all but I am
thinking that we get a small one so we
can grow up with ale I think that makes
the most sense you found one
alright guys so we're gonna pick one out
surprise Elle and we'll show it to you
when we get back to the house alright
guys so we just go back to the house
we're actually the laundry room right
now we're about to put our new pet in
its home and surprise Dale alright guys
so he grubs on halfway perfect who who's
that who's that baby what are you doing
here Katherine come get your daughter
then we have a surprise for you oh I
like those shoes are nice but I bet you
can't be in here
we're gonna come surprise you in a
little bit so these are his treats if
he's behaving then he gets treats and
this right here is water conditioner we
need to put a little bit of this in
there so the fish is safe
perfect that should be good right there
