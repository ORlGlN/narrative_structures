bring awareness and it goes beyond just
what's going on in there five anytime

yesterday about that have that all of

the
in through like I just know now that
life I want to be like a guiding light

compassion to topple
you know things that I would look coming
out of the fall called perceptual
intelligence there's a whole chapter
about people with health problems and
challenges
that is a crime I'd must answer Montel
Williams that in multiple sclerosis
wasn't over misery on earth
chapter 2 about yogurt Asian people
overcome medical director because it has
to do with how we perceive and how
people perceive the medical health
issues as a path there are ways happen
to the brain to help people overcome
them and not let that hold us back what
they want to accomplish tonight
