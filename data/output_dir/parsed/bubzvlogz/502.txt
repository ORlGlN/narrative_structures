before I serve delicious so all you need
is chicken pesto sauce - in your
supermarket bacon and cheese that's it
so first let's do this the way so

Celsius and I'm just going to cut these
Phillips into half so we have four of
them women days and took my knife I'm
gonna make a little slit inside there so
so easy
she's like so quick to prepare so I'll
sit here to look like a vagina grabbing
my test Oh mmm and going to bring in one
spoonful and each little piece you get
in there
I'm just going to stuff some cheese
inside the pesto slit as well as you can
see take more pesto and smear it all
over the chicken breast
give it a nice massage grab the bacon
and we're going to rock this thumb over
so create like a little I don't know the
gold parcel and then get a toothpick I'm
Pierce to it so it's face nicely and
plate so you have it on my knee oven and
I'm just going to leave it inside for
about 20 to 25 minutes

beautiful day there's a lot of stray
dogs in Hong Kong so makes me really
happy that you know people take them in

still dulse in the end of the day and I
love the matter of their like a certain
