Scrabble family tree are you ready to be
a water baby

sweet demonstrated going underwater with
her

asking Allah to water babies she's
absolutely knocked out stone cold
I'm per girl because last time this is
her second lesson her first lesson she
was a baby you should demonstrate like
taking water like upping it and pouring
in their feet basically demonstrated
you're three times okay and then
everybody has subdued so she had to get
her face splash more than another babies
and and this time she was demonstrated
again for the underwater part so she had
to go underwater more than once

but she was really really really good

more to it just to finish it up but so
