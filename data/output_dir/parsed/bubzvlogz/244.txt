is his idea of fun oh well suppose I
shouldn't be complaining about this
spotless
and plan to make his heart
for me
just like his dad what he speaks
we made it guys really easy flights I
think you just skip you sit like oh we
don't even worry about flying this is
whirring just feel a little bit wonder
they're really if you have a positive
mindset

on your mind that is like your stress
you can protect it away

is trying to call Santa
after 20 hours of toppling we're finally
here it's currently 6 a.m. everybody is
dead except for discovered she was
actually really good on the flight he
didn't sleep a lot but surprisingly he
didn't cry a lot which is great we're
all so tired last night that I think I
slept that like 8 p.m. so can't really
believe we're here
I could Northern Ireland okay so to be
really honest I'm kind of homesick
I really miss chubby and Donnell I'm
kind of glad that the ice isn't ready
yet it means that when we move in we can
all move in together remember I was
telling you guys that this guy's looking
tidy well we took her some Lego blocks

tech school and I was like white I'm
typically looking for is something that
has a big bit stopping by for some
Kentucky Fried Chicken
really morning everybody we decide to
spend a few days thinking about the car
because I wasn't expecting to get a new
car because it's been so long since I've
driven so I wanted to sort of like take
some you know like a few lessons just to
brush up my skills and I know people say
that once you do it again it all come
back but you know seven years is a long
time especially because of that I don't
know if getting a new car is a good
thing because I had it all mentally up
here that I will be driving a
second-hand car I think I'm a safe
enough driver but happen like really
think about this somebody's feeling well
I think he's figured out how to play a
little good I sort of can I get a check
in check and I see he's getting a soup
he's getting chicken broccoli week
cheesy fries I know one also has many
other wonders to you gonna go so well
