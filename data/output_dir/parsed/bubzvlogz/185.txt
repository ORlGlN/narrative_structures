really pile up you know so Thursday's
will be really clean M is mad none of
these people can park in the straight
line have you ever thought relatives
all right side the line is because the
bar next to them was parked bad so they
had to compensate by parking out of the
line so let's see when districts leave
then it looks like that guy was being an
a-hole
I'm totally eyeing this up so I just got
back from fixing my hair when I come
back to this there is a film blank t
castle in my butt in my kitchen
