abacus later
my family
feels like I was in Singapore a lot
longer because I was so crazy and the
meeting great was so crazy again but so
nice to see all of you guys actually got
quite sick near the end because I think
I didn't get a lot of like fresh air I
don't know oh no so yet there's a lot of
chicken oh I know no chicken it's like
what half 1:00 in the morning
under chicken and I love chicken some
dude just order one before me though so
he ordered the last chicken duck calf
you know I want chicken please yeah got
quite sick duty and a whole bit sloppy
anyway probably just need to get some
rest I can't believe I'm here in Hong
Kong
like I feel not along our goal I love
maybe like a month and I am back again
for just a couple days count with to
skip the dog lots of cuddles checking up
on the photos from the meet-and-greet
that you guys are tithing me and so cute
makes me smile
Wow doors there's quite a few
okay humble thank you baby
okay time for some rest guys gotcha
y'all later
it's so good
good morning good morning
Hey lastly ever don't feel too good
though double
hahahaha my god keep though sup oh I
started to really like get rid of all
symptoms 1l chocolate I just wanted to
eat rice so surreal to be back in this
apartment again it really wasn't that
long I was here and I think that's why I
didn't feel as mmm as difficult leaving
cuz I always knew that you know this
apartment would always be here for us
but it's really weird could I see Isaac
stuff and really we're not having him
like wobbling around oh yeah we're doing
laundry and I because we had immense
laundry when we were traveling many
ramen noodles you're always here for me
to keep me warm and when there's no suit
at home just answering a few questions
no I um some year asking how come Tim
went back to Hong Kong instead of coming
to Cambodia and Singapore with me and
the answer is because the dogs were
already in doggy camp for like two and a
half maybe even three weeks I wanted him
to collect the dogs as quick as possible
get them home and we're going to prepare
getting and back to the UK the one other
thing is a couple days time I will be
going back to UK Tim will be staying
here in Hong Kong for I think two and a
half or three weeks that's because he
has subsys aura as well so when he flies
back that's when he'll be taking dogs
back I really have to say I do miss for
life in Hong Kong it's just so
convenient really yet to get used to the
slower pace in the UK
but I think one of the reasons it didn't
feel as sad for me to move back to UK
it's because I know that we still have
this apartment just really comforts me
to know that when we come to Hong Kong
we will always have a home to return to
now Cambodia Singapore was incredible so
now in Hong Kong I'm just resting up
still feeling a little nauseous as we
speak but I do feel a lot better today
and I missed the food choices of Hong
Kong Hong Kong is always really pretty
for Chinese New Year but look guys it
looks like a giant ass gonna smack it
clearly I'm getting my stressful food
but that's the first thing people think
when they see that seriously lol oh and
Pam we missed his bedroom and sleeping
with the dogs and watching him play a
game good that's it cold I'm fine shoot
on cookie in there when you get
the DA's was almost when I was all
little bit dated probably so she does
like it cocoon you can see the shape
really demo I will never say never
yes McDonald's delivery this is pretty
sad but this is one of the things I miss
the most about Hong Kong packing to go
back tomorrow
I know chubby I wish she can come back
you'll be back before you know it
yeah one thing I won't miss at Hong Kong
are today I'm gonna say some of the
field assistants in Hong Kong were
really neat like if you decide not to
buy something even though they're really
like trying too hard value they just did
you eat like dirt haven't even type ID
I'll tell things anyway and I said bye
and she was like oh yeah Queen no I'm no
diva I'm actually very pleasant well
that's a survey I hit this guy
I can't tell the difference between a
lion and a tiger one's got a main one
doesn't holes go straight from
has a mean lion one thing I was really
jealous of when I was younger was
watching people just glide like that
gracefully and ice
wow she's got skill I bet you she was
ice skating with us boy
I know how to fall gracefully on ice and
I fell drop onto the edges you got on
the edges I got when I did I crawl
Thanks
