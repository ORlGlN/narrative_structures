everybody so as promised here is the
flocks at each of my sister's wedding
and this is the night before and our
home we pretty much got together and we
meet tawny together because it is
tradition
speaking of tradition it's also lucky
for the bride to wear red slippers and
pyjamas I saw some a easel Papa go tiny
Suns on you soon one day sings oh mighty
young my day
ok so cool yeah he's coming right out of
a cup of tea
it's also tradition for the groom and
his groomsmen to collect your bride but
before this the bridesmaid kinda like
give them a lot of obstacles to go
through to come in here I'm afraid you
have to go through a number of all ago
during the negotiation of the red
envelope Leon actually snuck through one
of the windows and climbed it I don't
know Monica and I again he went some of
the obstacles and coated like there's no
drinking a shot of soy sauce
we found that local doing press-ups
Oh tweezing nostril hair ah
hey I'm kidding man
Oh
we're heading towards
right
ah
Oh
you
