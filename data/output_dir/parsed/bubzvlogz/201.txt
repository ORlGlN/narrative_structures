ready to be scarred for life yeah yeah
this guy still doesn't like grass he's
standing on my slipper
strategically standing so he's not on
the grass you need to eat interested in
doing is eating
funny it on the couch do you see
see see it's okay he he went near a pole
I think that's good enough waiting for
this guy to finish as much until we can
eat it we'll just start fun okay yes I'm
in Spain or something you known as
siesta period where I think between the
four one once more what the fiber is
something a long life basically it like
a lot of places are closed
speaking of Spain I hope this doesn't
offend any of my Spanish viewers it's
not my intention but um well yesterday I
was like talking to him and I realized
this like this has been an ongoing
occurring thing and I've been the Spain
like like 10 times and possibly more
every time I come to Spain like me
somehow I get discriminated why because
I scored no it's because we've just been
unlucky that we get discriminated every
time is that coming it hasn't been as
bad we haven't been getting the actual
Chino yesterday when like I was shopping
and I was shopping in the bershka and
Marbella I'm so excited I love Persia
one of my favorite stores so I thought
I'll pop in and I saw top and I wanted
to reach for it but in front of it was a
lady a sales assistant and I said very
politely oh excuse me
and she turned round she saw me and Oh
Isaac
so saw me and they chicken meat it glare
and she continued doing whatever she was
doing so I said excuse me again she
didn't say anything so I thought okay
fair enough so I kind of had to like
grab the top from the other side because
she obviously wasn't moving so I got the
top and then I went to a changing room
and then put it on this side the bita
top so when I was paying there was
actually another girl so weird because
everybody else feels like you know hola
you know class yeah hola Gus yes Bona my
turn like she didn't even say anything
she didn't smile like she never told me
to price her anything she just grabbed
my card and while she was serving me you
should actually want on the serve like a
letter to people during that time which
I've never experienced before so I find
it really really weird I don't know it's
because like they didn't like that I
wasn't speaking their language but yeah
while I was paying like that girl and
the other girl who didn't move for me
they were like laughing and they were
saying something which obviously I
couldn't understand but it was just a
very uncomfortable scene two people they
were serving while serving me they were
kind of looking at me as if like you
know they were talking about me so yeah
that was really weird
I think your dad's gone that was amazing
imagine I sighed if there were like a
new decision we'll just sitting here
watching association like you remember
when you silly little
so happy the beach building sandcastle
and as like no I like the feeling sunny
Street well that explains a lot
