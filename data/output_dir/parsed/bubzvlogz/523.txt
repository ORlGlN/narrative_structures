ready I actually really needed to dye my
hair and I didn't have time to die
before away so I felt like pulling a
little bit lighter in my hair and this
is a berry ash and I've never tried this
color before I was meant to dye my hair
for the wedding but I just didn't have
times we shall do this right now
I quite like that like this it's a lot
easier to use and the least one the
scent is very strong so I say
hmm so this is my hair color which
actually looks darker on this camera for
some reason thank you she's actually
falling asleep I think your Jenner I
gotta have the drink alone to eat
because it helps you digest although you
don't want to have it alienate come on
