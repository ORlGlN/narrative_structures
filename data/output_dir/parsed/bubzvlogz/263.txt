and number 205 very pretty
sort of like an english room color my
hair faded luck
I have sucked myself in for a better
hair coloring appointment with that
being said I hated got me through this
kind of ashy color quite like it I think
I definitely want the top to be light as
well rather than dark but yesterday my
friends Aubrey she shared a post on
Facebook
Aubrey dozen it by the way and
it was such a good pose article was
called nobody told me I would hate my
husband when I shared it I will share
like a bunch of times unlike a bunch of
times because it just meant that a lot
of women could relate so I want to share
with you guys whether and you guys are
parents or if you guys are parents the
be so you kind of know what to expect
salsify basically the lady and she's
always had like a really good
relationship from her husband until the
baby came a lengthy article in the
infobox
but such I create article and I was
nodding away and I'm so glad someone
wrote this because you know people talk
about you know what happens after you
leave them with someone what happens
after we get married
no one really talks about you know the
relationship and that could happen with
between you your husband post baby I
spent most of the first year just
despising Tim and he just aggravated me
and I was trying to get some rest you
know during the two hours that I could
and you were snoring away
I just wanted to punch him ventually I
find a system that work for us son we
started to get more living so no we
don't hate each other right now I'm just
gonna let you guys read the article and
said because it's so good and I painted
Tim and I perfectly and apparently a lot
like other moms are there but the put in
the picture how much Tim
aggravated me if this was his nuts I
wanted to add this one since
I wanted to just the ladies and
gentlemen I want to say that some no
matter how much you think you have got
your relationship together at least
that's what Tim and I thought there may
come a time where you guys will just
really piss each other off but it's ok
it doesn't mean it's a reflection of
your relationship it just means it's
transitioning into a new phase I'm sure
a lot of couples somehow just work
through smoothly but for the majority of
us it is definitely quite a rough
transition to get into on top of the
sleepless nights and top off being like
delusional
um the hormones um no times yourself or
any not better not be what I think
