like sleep yes you do like your money
better mommy Kathy would say it's a joke
on me yeah
like bow me yeah started to actually
lift into my face I show she did it
pretty early cuz usually babies they
tend to look at your hairline because
they tend to look at things of higher
contrast which is definitely not looking
at my hairline anymore she's looking
straight on my expression
what are you doing huh which one is it
Isaac I think whose market okay a child
never loads usually I can tell
undistinguished at first but they have
similar sounding forts which is not
surprising actually since his father and
son we were finally going to eat the
frontal display hearts because he
actually doesn't play it very much
anymore Wow I think is he actually
thinking this is a game shouldn't it be
the opposite Tim insists on me seeing
the extra space I'm oh wow ignore the
eyebrows as if that's possible
I've got the edge of house Barton again
now when you have a little bit less he's
staring at my eyebrows are you staying
on my eyebrows yeah yeah is yucky mommy
alright wait for me good morning pinky
where's your neck your neck is gone
good morning Tom oh I wonder if he did
we have a problem guys and you will
probably see why
it's like a yes there's people all over
the floor I don't know if you guys know
already but doll Moe has never been like
the best when I come to the party but
ever since Ayla car here
the dogs are no longer allowed to sleep
in our bedroom so during the day they
can go up and everything but at night
time they have to stay downstairs
it's just caused him to just go
everywhere even worse than before
every morning we have to pick up all the
time
Matt doesn't matter if you yes Oh Peggy
with a small bowl or his corn flakes
okay all right no problem doesn't even
matter how often you we let them like to
Peru and everything as long as it's
night time and he's not allowed to be
with you he will go all over the wit
doesn't pick it up it's really been
frustrating Tim like I used to think he
was joking
he's always favorite chubby as you guys
know but he's quite like serious about
not wanting him and of course I'm not
gonna give them away but yeah it's just
one of the things we have to live with
did you have fun today
shall we go yeah this one's for me it
was really nice to be able to put my
swimming live Isaac I left Tim but I
bought all Melbourne again I don't know
what she's gonna take it some singers

right happen
bobbing him I unplugged the water and
that was picking the toys out of this
water
turn right and I saw him like full like
he tried to climb by the bathtub
well you know how sugar stops the
bleeding his granny put some sugar
asking for morbus cute is our outfit
today are you helping mommy yeah tell me
time focus are you hungry
maybe you want that milk you're gonna
have to work work work her neck
up here curly just chillin with Miss
Ellie egg
this girl has started to sleep longer
for the past week people define sleeping
through tonight differently but to me I
think Slate Meagher tonight like five
hours to me is sleeping through tonight
which is great but I feel like I
shouldn't even be kind of like a good
problem because she's sleeping more I
mean I get to sleep more out of goo
instead of waking up like three four
times and make the feeder I only do it
once but after that first beat because
she's given me a longer stretch I end up
being wide awake on around like 4 a.m.
I'm like wide awake and you know I don't
really know what to do and I roll around
is my issue really and it's probably
because when I was praying again I just
got used to not sleeping a lot she wants
milk yeah I think she's hungry okay but
he's getting the bottle for you this
girl has been refusing the bottle over
rather starve or something in the boy so
I would really appreciate a advice from
fellow mommies right there because
obviously I want to continue
breastfeeding but it will be nice to be
able to leave the house for a few hours
daddy doesn't want you demo you won't
even look at me because he's been dumb
oh you won't even look at me
they told him off again because he
pooped everywhere hey
