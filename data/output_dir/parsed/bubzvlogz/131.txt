gelatin leaves chiidren casino of milk
and 350 mils of double cream I said I'm
just going to scoop up the gelatin
leaves and a little cold water just sort
of softens up a little bit nice next is
the no annoying visible cream no honey
so no apologies and 25 grams of sugar

the vanilla where'd it go

the gelatin please and one at a time I'm
going to squeeze excess water out and
add it in melting at one at a time
what a night of a panna cotta is it's
it's creamy but it's not too overly
sweet it has complete okay I'm just
going to let it sit and cool your top
layer it kind of dries up so you can get
rid of the little black pieces of
vanilla so your panna cotta is nice and
pretty so I got my container and I'm
just going to pour them inside
