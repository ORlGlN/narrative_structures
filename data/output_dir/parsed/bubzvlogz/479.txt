type of brake noodle what is it a bike
dim sum that makes you so tired and
sticky lately the guys have been talking
outside for like forever still outside
they're still talking about Dragon Ball

that in Hong Kong you get like Pripet
fresh ingredients you just throw it all
in a pot add water add meat
you're golden so Tim is like a child
basically he only eats an apple if it's
been cut the cores in off i'm preferably
peeled let's tackle this giant umbrella
umbrella Wow I don't know guys whatever
I should have cut this hard to cut this
I'm sorry
oh this Apple actually cost $50 50 Hong
Kong dollars and 50 Hong Kong dollars
you can buy several packets of apples so
I kind of think are any God's gallon
then she's so key because she actually
felt some enjoy eating apples but she
just likes buying it so you know I would
eat it how's the thing about all people
the only thing about like you know other
people then everything about themselves
but growing up that was one thing that
you know just really inspired me to be a
bit more selfless because my granny is
one of the most like selfless people
you'll ever ever meet and like that you
know I can make a living for myself I
always try to give her some money and
she's always reluctant to just get each
time she's like no

there are many slices that single Apple
could give us that's alright that's when
he half an apple the other half sin my
please yeah I just tasted this tip on it
