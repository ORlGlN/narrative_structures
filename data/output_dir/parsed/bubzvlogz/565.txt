because these bridges are so close by
but they have a total different view I
mean it's so different a lot of people
oh there's not a car here as a child has
always been my dream to go to Disneyland
but I'm older and I but for some reason
every time I go to Disneyland I just
feel like a child again I think this is
my smallest bean park that I've ever
been to I believe this Disneyland is the
world's smallest there's not very much
rides that's don't like to go here's
when I was in it's a small world I
believe I'm not sure when I'm in here
feels like time has just stopped me

fireworks and everybody was just sitting
on the floor it was so windy and cold
that night but I felt really warm inside
