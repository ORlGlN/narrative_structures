I wasn't thinking people can like cast
like a lot of body parts I took her to
doctors because I suspect that she still
had thrush because I used up all her
medicine and I was still there and
basically he told me no is not thrush
it's just milk residue but I wasn't sure
because it's so hard to scrape off and I
noticed that was getting thicker and
thicker and thicker so I took her doctor
again here in UK and she told me that
yes she'd also have thrush weird isn't
it oh wow it really is autumn look at
the tree changing colors a bit of a
headache why this is how I get him to
learn his letters well there's an
ordinary word search here so I'm like
