heading to Penny's birthday it's not
right are we gonna see penny penny in
bed edgy I always get them mixed up we
just call them pengie ah don't forget
the present backup we have lots of
things it's wearing the dress that I got
her as we get ready for the officers
birthday song with the unusually high
video
Hey
maybe yeah hahahahaha
baby if your belly was a fake you're not
beautiful I mean it's really good
ah ready vivent okay tell me you're cute
too
you wanted me okay oh you're such a
difficult trick where she wants me to
help her she's too good for me
would
Oh finally paid off to have it follow me
in a toilet nice and connective tissue
please thank you like Oh what are you oh
and you as a laughs yeah what's up a
 down crocodile crocodile
oh no crocodile oh how do we go from
crocodile the poopoo platter
okay let's go play so quiet in here we
hungry a bit
someone has the fever we're gonna cry
baby cry as soon as I come in here let's
wave your nose it was worth it Finlay
se-min athena notice my eyebrow oh I'm
testing this Xu hybrid gel so what
happens is do you apply it and then you
leave it on for a few hours and you peel
it off it's supposed to tip your brows
so let's see how it goes keep staring up
I want to remove it because really
scared is going to end up being like
really heavy and dark it doesn't work I
can just try again and do on longer but
for now let's take it out oh I see it
working already I'm having trouble
taking off the bottom part I think I
should have applied thicker so it's
easier to peel off I think I'll do it
properly I go to bed but let's remove
this one I think when it dries properly
is more hard mine feels really soft this
is how it looks
I think this would come in handy for
people and they're quite lazy good
morning so it's not a date after I kept
the gel on overnight actually when I
don't wear makeup
for most of the days this is good for me
getting errands because brothers is most
important we have there
or the past few days he has not been
well every day
he is just crying so I had to leave the
store for about ten minutes
whenever I'm around basically cries
Timothy relief and I came back and I see
them too happily eating independently
yeah Serena I'd be like
hello hello
to read over that building why why is
this happening and this is actually a
thing you know there's so many mothers
who have the same issue where their
children are so well behaved with the
grandparents of the daddies my childcare
whatever but as soon as the mom is in
the room then it goes crazy tyranny is
because well I like a series of the
compliments because they trust you so
much that they feel that it's safe to
share their most vulnerable deep
fiddling with that a cocktail
