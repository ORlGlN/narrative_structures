Timna installed a month old he assembled
a she shelf Peter still is no longer a
big clutter so I was actually from Ikea
and it's actually one of these but he
put them both together so it looks like
a long one today I had a full body check
and while I was in with no body check
they actually measured my height so I
think they were measuring my BMI or
something us all but today I actually
find out my real height for a really
really really long time I've been
telling people I am 150 centimeters okay
which I was pretty certain I was well I
nailed a bit under okay but I just says
150 because it's easier well yesterday
it told me that I'm actually 148
centimeters so I'm about that much
shorter than my actual height so let's
find out what 1/4 it is in beep so 1/4 8
centimeter is 4 foot 10 closer to 4 by
10 then for the 11th so sad times what
is okay good things come in small
packages
ah Tim finally got to install one of
these family lights for me um to be
honest I don't really use it for makeup
but I think it makes the room looks so
much prettier a lot of people been
asking about the brand of this this is
in its occult it's called Milly Fiore
and it's awesome guys so you just put
some water and then I'm just add you
know several drips off whatever oil you
like and right now I'm really loving
