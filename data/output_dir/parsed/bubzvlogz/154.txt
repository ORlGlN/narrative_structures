can't have been the only one that
thought it looked like she had toilet
roll on her head and then like a pair of
stockings on top I cannot be the only
one hey puppies hello
I knew Mia grannies making her
speciality in a book one phone call five
suits on one of my favorite it's like
dessert this is not for the
faint-hearted bear in mind you could use
a lot of strength from our planet Joey
say it was drivin past
I thought our Popeye granny just said
that I made them really really well kind
of like a sweet potato pancake her
mapable mmm crunchy on your outside mmm
soft on the inside is really
oh he prided himself yeah he's really
trying to open up his scalpel basically
children are suitable and he loves it
oh boy
Oh dad my chest feels blue so what does
the husband have to do I'm driving
aimlessly stockpot heliumite pick me up
the stateís scenery and where is more
of I feel so lethargic
I'm really glad you guys are liking the
dark-hair ello when I first started I
really didn't like it so at first I used
the lycée Box hair dye in rose tea
brine and I really liked it but I only
bought one box so it meant that I
couldn't cover all my hair because you
guys know I have a lot of hair I went to
boots and I got one of their box size
there and this totally reminds me why I
never do my hair myself and I'm using
any box size here in UK because it just
doesn't work like the Asian ones so even
though the box side the color looks
similar to my hair it was so much darker
and a greyish tone too and just doesn't
suit my skin tone so I've been using
head and shoulders just to help strip
the color eyes me tied your hair and
you're not a big fan of it then use
henna alerts if you like your your color
and you want to keep it then you want to
avoid head and shoulders it's catching
up on some work Tim is going to be
leaving us very soon
other than bulk editing recording
because I know that I'm going to be
occupied for in next two weeks yeah
halloween is coming up and i'm not sure

never been like fuss at Halloween

last time I choked up by dressing up as
Rihanna literally this is what we
thought of when we saw Rihanna

the only one that thought it looked like
she had toilet roll on her head and then
like a pair of stockings on top I cannot
be the only one huh anyways you know how
you like yesterday to my saying that
I've been like a little snappy and I
went home and I started doing a bit of
googling because I don't really get PMS

something known as the other time of the
month and like my body I'm very I'm very
intuitive my body like I feel everything

been feeling like which twinges
in my lower abdomen area out Domo and
it's not the twin Jing that has been
bothering me but I also notice it's much
too of extreme fatigue okay so not that
I get mood swings but like sometimes

bothered like dealing with situations I
