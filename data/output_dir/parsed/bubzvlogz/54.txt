average wait already am I doing here a
joke how long it took daddy to get the
grocery list do you think it's funny you
laugh yeah I know right
that's a better joke going grocery
shopping
I feel like I'm cheating when I think
ooh
I think Lopes come for lunch custody
right now hopefully she will say to sway
until we finish our food oh yeah
not even 1 minute later
so while we're waiting in food I just
want to just I guess address a little
something down in the last vlog when we
asked Isaac who there's red walls and he
said mommy and then asked who are these
bastards
he said grandmother some you guys have
been saying it's implying that items an
incompetent father definitely not you
know you guys always hear me express how
great she is we just thought it was
really paint that Isaac said I was his
best friend because honestly Isaac is he
loves his father to bits he loved him so
much he is a mummy's boy but the thing
is so with Tim tim is also a mummy's boy
and she is he's really close up his mom
so we just thought it was really cute at
all they're really really close guys we
actually thought it was really cute
Melinda Tim and his son are both mommy's
boys
I actually know both mummys boys and
girls then they cannot be here for
everything and I can be just given up
this vision president that's the dream
no no no actually in the common a lot
actually
it was really sweet sometimes we we see
quite a bit so you guys need Isaac ISM
it's a very polite little boy just us
when we raised him and I think a lot of
it could be due to his natural
personality he's gonna timid boy I think
also like I always I can teach a little
boy to be kind but you can also show him
I taught him to be like this me me me me
didn't think no I think it was a joint
effort to join a parenting effort
because we're stay-at-home parents yeah
Isaac you very much that's perfect very
quickly I think a lot of Isaac it even
in fact that like
had the speech delay we were never
worried you know for what we'll always
concerned me more whether he'll grow up
to be a kind decent person so I always
think it'll modify successful
good-looking you're like both contrast
Becky unless you respect others teaching
him manners has always been a huge to be
patient although without being sent it's
not the same he doesn't have money it's
just we don't catch on conference so you
know please don't think that he's a
perfect kid there's no such thing we try
a bit here's the key
you have acute kidney which is really
really lucky sweating tears
nails finish baby Philippi which is it
the fastest runner groceries on earth
there's times that accent I'm doing baby
for just populations especially it's the
Northern Irish thing my sister she works
in London and even she says when she
comes back here to visit people just
seem different here and we'll hear in
general are very different Hermione I
