home
Isaac he's a sleeping lion turns out the
reason why he was so grumpy like today
and yesterday the birthday dinner was
because like he wasn't feeling well
they got home we took a temperature and
it was she was 38 degrees so he's
definitely not well but because you know
we wanted a ticket a lot of the Dooley
lads and just we just really wanted him
and have fun but he just really didn't
seem to enjoy it so I do feel a bit bad
so hopefully tomorrow he feels better
