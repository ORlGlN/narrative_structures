I get to wear a dress again I thought my
dress days were over
yay I get to be a bride 10 I decided
that this year or maybe early next year
we're going to rent out this apartment
because we're only here like just like a
few times a year so um lots of amazing
memories this was our very first home we
bought you know we got engaged married
the bumbles first home and we bought
Isaac back yeah quite pretty emotional
thinking about it but you know our life
is in UK right now so just clear a lot
of my stuff and before I got here I was
like thinking I'm going to buy this and
this and this I want to get this the nut
I'm back here there's so much stuff here
that it was such a big eye-opener
because obviously you realize just how
much things get wasted before you buy
something like please ask yourself guys
oh it's something I'm gonna use in a
moment or am I gonna chuck it away what
I really don't want to bend away on my
my books so a lot of these books I've
read before but obviously books are
heavy it's really difficult for me to
bring back so um I'm trying to see if I
could donate them because you just kept
their way books books is like knowledge
you can throw away knowledge mid
cleaning up stuff look what I find such
a grump
such a crybaby I read a tip so romantic
he just went and brought me food is that
what I think it is I wonder if it's my
spam egg and macaroni insert base Arnie
are on our way
grab some dinner because yes sissy
I never get sushi back home because I
always feel like it's not worth it
because they reveal Isaac he he naps at
a really weird time he'll not from like
5 p.m. to like 6 get a means out like we
don't want that rushing for dinner and
stuff I guess it's not so bad because
it's not like I want to keep him Hong
Kong time anyway 408 Ohio 5 potato and
cheese sauce he's fascinated
we went to oh yeah with bread
I miss you I'm gonna make up for all the
steam man off in the past year you
normally eat one portion a week you were
gone for about 30 weeks so you need 30
portions of sashimi in a week
