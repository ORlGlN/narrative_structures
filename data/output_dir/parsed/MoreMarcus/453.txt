yeah let's go down guys today I'm going
to attempt to make your own bubble tea
I've never had bubble tea before five
straws bath we're gonna do strawberry
Kiwi because I've got the ingredients
flat place the teabag
let's get some more boiling come on
cause you got some holes in your top
oh really yeah no her tankini down right
away but so captain's boiler pasty back
and 2 TSP sugar in chill drops and half
the wood boiling water so teabag that's
just a story DVD back to TSP that's a
teaspoon of that one
- so we're going to pull hard fill up
with water managers lever make sixty
thousand six hundred mil and small salsa
to
free here four teaspoons of starch so
this is starch little 1/2
three four boobs
six hundred mil going straight into
there so apparently wait for the sugar
already looks like it's dissolved but
okay wait for that to dissolve four
teaspoons of large with three
tablespoons boiling water how to time
that with food coloring we've got a food
coloring here and it says on here and
this will go a very long way
one two that's going to mix with three
of them not sure about that
and inside dab of this a tiny dab yeah
it's in it like what oh cool
these that's work and one oh
if the mixture appears wet or shiny well
okay kids both wet and shiny there is
too much liquid when stirred with a
spoon or road to bigger see a mixture
will crumble I don't know if that's like
snapchat huh
I knew you do that it was horrible in
your hands put your fingers in there got
that oh oh now it looks sick
makes many boards you can the start
using your fingers they should measure 8
to 12 meters millimeters in diameter
place each one on a dry plate as you go
that's some really good bull when the
water is boiling drop all the balls in
the pan and give them a gentle stir
allowed to simmer for 10 minutes and
look it's pretty easily it's bad life
pick this up and drop them all in the
water brought all the balls in the pan
and give them a gentle stir
kingdom step off the bubbles are cooking
I need to make some sweet and iced water
ice water add in 50 ml boiling water 6
teaspoons of sugar 2 free stir quickly
apparently oh it sits under milk
cold water and some ice and some ice how
much ice like just says and sunlight
like that some ice I'm very intrigued to
see how this turns out
cool so there's been about 10 minutes
now what we're going to do is get the
little balls out and drop them in this
ice sweetened water would you leave for
about 4 minutes 5 minutes
anyone have chili if you want them
cheery apparently you'll even blonder
bill dollars from sweetness Wally's
insights really drop into our now cooled
tea is cool
pop the bubble to you with cold water
and ice
add sugar juice or milk to taste for
inspiration Sharia lemon isn't quite
gone off as mine we're going to squeeze
that in there then it's going in get ice
and then top up with sparkling water got
my straws here take the fifth taste nut
that is that is basically a galaxy
bubble tea actually tastes really good
that really good I only get one of the
bubbles watch one of them look there's
obviously a lot of sugar in that stuff
so in this there was in the first thing
we did this T two teaspoons of sugar
which is obviously still two teaspoons
of sugar but it's fresh lemon taste good
there we go
that is how you make a DIY kind of
galaxy bubble tea hope you enjoyed if
you did get a video thumbs up and I'll
see you tomorrow in another video bye
