Sun is hello and welcome back to a low

did this a few days ago not sure when
this is going up and I loved it as one
of my favorite videos I've done on this
channel and you guys loved it as well so
we're doing a part two but a bit a bit
of them if this looks a little bit
different now is because the Sun was
pissing me off so I shut the blind cool
so if you guys remember there is a point
for me getting the artist a point for
the song and a point for the year which
is very very hard so there's a total of
21 points to be and I know this is
already once you sassing home bad
spare many hats make my way making my
way through the crown
