hey yo hey guys how are you doing today
it was Eurovision the other day recently
and you know I've never seen the
Eurovision but never and I just haven't
ever seen it in terms of like actually
sitting down and watching it and getting
into it I've just I don't know never
been about that lifestyle and obviously
I've seen things like when the person
with the beard and Jedward were in hair
and blue were in it one time someone
else was in it another time but I've
never really actually go into it so I
thought we funny to like react to some
of the strangest Eurovision entries of
recent years oh my god
how can you hit right now you must not
have any pet food this someone else
I was the same act though where they
robbed you know Russia
these guys like in a chat
she looks oh she's they look very old
they don't that I'm bit worried for
their health and they literally come on
and oh oh
going to your women dance on the stage
come on
Oh
after the thing is that shouting come on
and dance they're not really dancing
they're just like come on and dance what
what's the relevance with the mince pies
hey Sheldon mince pies they come on it's
my life Caesar Romania is it's a normal
song it's heads quite like mine
Oh
some of the voices are amazing it sounds
like Katherine Jenkins I love it's like
opera and dubstep and he's a vampire
okay
the balls move I love the path started
I'm sorry but he is making me something
why they not good songs yeah is that
like part of Eurovision for you to enter
you're not allowed to have a good song
please just go
and again far from your hyper oh my god
I'm glad I stopped but but any of these
songs end up going into the charts okay
if you do yeah
however many up summer has definitely
none never been in this video yeah
this is quite good why are they dressed
as animals you like this thing useless
what you don't you buy this I'm confused
by the animal
my shaman is oh that's quite good under
his wings raising that is quite cool
that is clever out of that happen the
two people just helps to define
fireworks like here this is the best one
so far I quite like that
good effort John I tweeted jr. I said if
you - boy that one there we actually
would probably win would you dress up
would you do the face paper yeah yeah
I'd go for it if not you too boy ban at
least Marquis Buffalo should I just
enter yeah next year yeah next year
