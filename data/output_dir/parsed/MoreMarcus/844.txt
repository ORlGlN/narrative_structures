when the great at night so basically we
used to cool it we had a double essence
we used to end up calling it so
he'd be our what work have you got to
make though and he'd be like aah Oh
double mate what about you I'm
a see the reason we called it
was because we just sat there in the
lesson we learn anything
we just didn't take any notes of lesson
and we just messed about that the two of
us just sat on our little table just
missed about the whole thing
they loved us so yeah joke first fun I
