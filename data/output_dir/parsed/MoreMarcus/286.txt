gonna be doing that let you know we're
gonna be trying to make DIY unicorn
slime BAM but little fun fact we tried
this how long it three weeks ago

weeks ago we tried this filmed the whole
video we didn't have one of the main
ingredients but we used an alternative
and it absolutely flock like we didn't
make fun we had run igloo so today you
got all the right ingredients and we're
going to retry this fingers crossed it's
going to work because otherwise it's a
waste of time and it step one you are
going to need glue white school glue
known as PVA glue no the one in school
use where you got a guy at six your
hands borax
we're leaving ours here you need borax
don't know what borax is but we've
finally got borax we didn't have borax
in the last video but we've got borax
now one cup reason so no curbs there
kaname not okay food coloring they don't
need vanilla actually if you didn't know
you guys I'm actually sewing on my own
cup shop so if you're ever in the area
having a cup come round to Bucky's cup
shot oh yeah I ordered some takeaway
coffee cups and didn't realize that they
give me a hundred and brass sticks
is that basically what they call their
knowledge signaling the cross this is a
lolly stick that's been dyed why lolly
are you idiot
really quite so we're going to try one
and hopefully it works and then we do
more blah blah blah so first thing you
need it's five ounces of PVA glue in
your cup five ounces is about one
hundred and fifty eight milliliters
oh yeah baby
ah ah next you add a tablespoon of warm
water add tension water and food
coloring and mix well with the craft
stick what food coloring are we in yoga
we should go for blue we're going to go
with blue first get the old craft stick
oh let's get a blue one and hopefully we
get more blue in there so mixing this
together
it'll work out on the old wrist so in
another cup you need a one cup
measurement of warm water so as a cup of
warm water and borax to the remaining
cup of water and mix until waters
completely dissolved so how much for X
1/2 a teaspoon of what's out here so
this is where we had one last hunts we
didn't have borax now I don't even know
what borax is do not borax is no good
get your borax half a teaspoon mix it
into the water into it mix until it's as
old but greeny it's sandy
it's dissolve is this gonna work
haha this is the big moment we've got
our blue colored glue here borax water
here apparently you mix that in there
and it starts to thicken immediately
is it thickening that um okay so we got
it wrong you don't have a whole set of
what we've done is added a tiny bit of
water mixed with half a teaspoon of
borax into here and we're just mixing
away and you can see it's getting slimy
