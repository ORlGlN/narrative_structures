Week so yeah I have just been playing
some anyway welcome to today's video
go follow my Spotify if you want them on
Spotify playlist my username is mutton
or search Marcus Butler he has a full
stop anyway today's video yo i'm quite
excited for this video i am going to be
having a look at actor's audition tapes
many of you know when an actor gets a
role they would have had to audition for
that role and we're gonna be looking at
some of those audition tapes and
reacting to them so actually ow let's
have a little gander of what we've gone
on here then shall we
Isis Jessie for Breaking Bad oh I love
Breaking Bad that's actually so fitting
because I'm reaching out if you haven't
seen Breaking Bad maybe you're too young
if you haven't seen it in your of age if
you haven't seen it in your old age what
you doing go and watch it
do you have seen it eh yo bitch Jesse
Pinkman impression you negotiate you are
not how I remember from class I mean
like not at all tell me why you're doing
this is he free styling so in some
audition tapes obviously you'll get
you're given a script right and you
learn the lines and then you go in a new
perform sometimes they throw you off and
I think that's what they've done here is
they're just improv to see how he reacts
on the spot so if we go back to look
negotiate you're a drug dealer negotiate
I feel like you are not how I remember
from class I mean like not at all okay
wait wait hold on
tell me why you're doing this novice
gloves
I mean seriously why are you doing
come on man so can we just allow it is
see Jessie we've long had 50 he's just
gonna break bad I'm 41
it's weird those who compute meaning
this is so interesting yeah I'm sorry
Zack you've gone on gun crazy or
depressed I'm just saying you know
that's something that I need to know
about why is everyone laughing about
garlic Peter that's why I think I mean I
don't know what role that is for I
didn't watch her in Disney but she
little I should connect I wasn't jealous
before we is this guy from American Pie
now every man that I see his are
potential threats can I possess if it is
insane why her sir said like this why
are his eyes so like this

those delicious falafel hotdogs with
cinnamon and bacon on top he's away I

the end of the lunch line oh it's one of
those delicious falafel hotdogs with
cinnamon and bacon on top of those those

a hotel who's gonna be crushes on her
learn what happened and I don't even
know if he's gonna take me back but I
have to go talk to her

like wrong those things reads her I'm
completely guessing this is from the
notebook I made a promise to a man he
gave me a ring and I gave him my word
and your word is shot to hell don't you
think well I don't know I'll find out
when I talk to you so you're not gonna
break your promise that's what this is
about

following your heart al she's so good he
does have a lot of money out okay now I
hate you now I hate you

attention therefore the path what do you
think's been happening here Lois must
have misread the signal yeah I guess she

stay with you look at us we're all ready
to fight well that's what we do you're
not afraid to tell me what a big
American soon I'm not afraid to tell you
when you're being a pain in the ass but
you are 99% of the time it's gonna be
hard we're gonna have to work out this
but come on don't take the easy way out
what easy way out there is no easy way
out no matter what I do somebody gets
hurt well forget about everyone then
forget about everyone and me and him and
your parents and then what you think you
should do what about you what do you
want it's not that simple
no come on like I'm so into that where's
the rest where's the ending what's the
outcome Ali I'm now interested in saying
if it's possible the second audition
ends so something like that I want to
see the ending I want something that the
scenes finished and then it's just like
great job oh thank you thanks for thanks
for that I found that really interesting
as someone who aspires to act aspires to
have one of these roles
I would actually ship myself if going
into an audition room yeah really
interesting and it gives me terrifying
nerves for the day that I will have to
go into a room and do that but yeah I'd
love to know what you guys thought of
that did you enjoy that

to an audition I would be interested to
