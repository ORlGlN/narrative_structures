yo yo yo yo yo what's going on b4 sexy
people my name's Marcus and welcome back
to another video probably a really bad
American accent I'm sorry welcome back
to one of my favorite videos continuing
the series every month where I share
some of my favorite songs right now with
you beautiful people and they're usually
from my Spotify where you can go follow
me it's Marcus Butler . there's always a
link down there I make pretty awesome
playlists I like to think they're
awesome
you can decide over there or not but I
get really good feedback and I get
tweets every day about you liking them
so yeah that's let's jump right into it
alright the first song going with is
quite quite fitting for me I'd guess
although not real just well isn't ISM
it's by the artists alma al MA and it's
called dyeing my hair I had a tiny not
family moment but like I found this song
another like kind of never heard this
artist and the album artwork is her with
bright green hair and at the EMAs at the
after party all kind of saw her things I
was like that's that's that song that I
like and I started I was like I would
blow your fly in a minute
I'll tell you why it's about me know why
I like relates to the song
I mean quite pointless lyrics but I kind
of like that it's just so random
oh and it's the most catchy song you
will go away singing for the rest of the
day
okay next song is by jour Lipper dua
space el IPA called room for two it's a
little bit more chilled
like the b-school like that it's a lot
more chilled just not so much next song
I don't know what this has got literally
like 24,000 plays on Spotify don't know
how I even found this but it's by cemre
se mm a and it's called nude stuck a
nice uplifting fun song
really types on okay the other one again
this has got under a million plays on
Spotify it's called empty streets by
Kota banks KO t8 banks again a nice like
good chill chill vibes chill way
but I don't know what time it yeah but
the drugs go
I do quarterly pay less for like the
year and when I'm caught 2 for now a
year so most of these songs you'll find
in there as well so yeah and then the
next song I'm planing I've really this
might be one of my favorite ones have
done Archie this song is called love to
hate by off bloom off space bloom be el
diablo and play now they're just they're
really I really I didn't
my mother got me y'all change
so there we go that rounds that up I
feel like a lot of those songs were
quite similar sound so if we could do
