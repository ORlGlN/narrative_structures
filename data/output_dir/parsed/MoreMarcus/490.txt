welcome back to guess the childhood TV
shows number two I did this video a
while ago one it was like one of my
favorite videos have done and two I feel
I feel I feel I feel like I have to
redeem myself because I did so badly
honesty
reading today's points the amount of you
that like Marcus she didn't know Tracy
Beaker and to Zoey 201 with either
although what I want to see you're
probably gonna shoot me for that I'm
sorry I don't know I did watch those but
maybe with this one I'll be able to
redeem myself a bit or make myself look
like even more of a dick so yeah I don't
know I thought I've watched a lot of TV
as a child but maybe they were just the
wrong shows you know maybe I wasn't
watching the cool stuff but here we go
so how many points we got got for grabs
today 1414 okay you heard it here first
guys 14 let's see if I do better than
six or what I brought last time

that so I recognize

Josh straight and Josh yeah
yes what you own 2004 yep
motor and what um well there's a stack
this is so pretty good our chat with
what's-his-name neat I love to hear his
name yes Neil ah legend you know the
best bits as well you speed that at the
end of the shows where they did the
massive ones and then it zooms out I
even I got our tech books when I was
younger and I used to recreate the stuff
at home the one I made a treasure
treasure map where you get get piece of
paper that's crumple it up and then
throw T over it make it dry that it
looks like a map and the only thing I
did was I thought this was so cool when
I was a little kid and I was all no one
can go in my room
you got used you know the end of a
toilet roll so you get three three of
those you painted them to make another
security man then you get ping-pong
balls and you put them on top of them
rest some beneath the door so then
obviously someone pushes it ping-pong
balls would fall off and you know if
someone's been in your room
oh my mum's been in my room do you know
I'm gonna go like 97 90 90 90 90
that's one bloody hell Neil Power

Oh legendry yeah
what first ad yeah all right now I need
to work this out because I'm trying to
figure out when it stopped

because in my head I the first thing I
thought was dead end 2008 around the
