hello Yuto sexy people welcome back
so another DIY video today we're making
glitter volcanoes actual volcanoes that
erupt with lava or not because that
would be impossible but we're going to
be making some glitter
we don't glitter so we're going making
some colored volcanoes so as always
we're going to show you what it's meant
to the plug right here take a look at
that you look in right there it's
exactly what this is gonna look like
currently it's pretty simple need a
baking tray here is a baking tray you
need four cups here are four cups and
there's three simple steps step one you
need to set up four glasses of vinegar
to be the base of your Vulcan sit your
cups of vinegar and a large glass glass
dish or a cookie sheet catch
mallamma catching that lava add a few
drops so what we literally just fill
these with vinegar yeah we've gone for
essential Waitrose malt vinegar this is
what you use on fish and chips yeah love
Tameka on this yeah
very strong what's up doing a shop I
just shot you're gonna begin do one no
woman no you just said you do I'm
very ill so that's gonna help how much
is a shot just you know good sweet
that's really nice
genuinely are you serious
cool you drink more of that than you see
during water
what was that very nice okay so vinegar
for pour it in here Dada la la la la
let's be clear vinegar it says such
thing as clear vinegar yeah add a few
drops of food coloring to each cup and
stir as you can see we also added some
glitter so add a few drops of food
coloring
I've bought feeling this isn't going to
change the color because we've got black
vinegar so you know let's go with a
yellow see if I mean if anything's going
to make it go price yellow isn't it oh
look at that look at that would you look
at that I'm gonna wait for the magic
stir and it's still exactly the same
color yeah well that's gonna but that's
gone bit bluey
why not oh that's actually changed okay
so we got red we are green I mean I'm
mixing them together now but step two
now the easy part take a scoop of baking
soda and drop right into your cups of
vinegar and watch lava happen it's not
gonna work mol thinning area you don't
say that I did the first one and once
the kids saw the reaction they were I've
got this mum now move take a skip water
scoop is that scoop what is anything can
happen oh look at that
let's see
and it's green mister next one
Oh ready 1 2 3 1 2 3

we're not secure zone when you don't
have glitter use whatever else you can
find to make it look literary so I mean
