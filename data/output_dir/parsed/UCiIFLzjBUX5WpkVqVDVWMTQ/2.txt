yeah why don't you to work you're gonna
say what's coming I think they need
bacon butter ticking all right so my
little sister has been having a rough
past couple weeks so I thought nothing
would cheer up more than if I just came
home and surprised so I try to plan
around her scheduled my stepmom while
she's at school I can go to the house
and be there when she comes back but of
course the night before when I texted my
stepmom she saw the text saying when
does die come home so that's where we
are in the story with worry about a
watch right now my son mom and I already
talked about this when I was editing it
it did not make any sense and I just had
to reshoot this so I could so it makes
sense yeah and now back to the video I
just I don't know why but it'd take you
a long time to answer or we're just like
oh because of merge so much thing I just
thought of it two hours later oh my god
so two hours later she texted her back
saying oh it's because Dana's trying to
send you merge I just texted her right
now saying what time to get home because
I was trying to send you merge I'm
supposed to arrive at 12:00 p.m. your
time I just want to make sure that you
got the merge she goes and so let's go
my ride is running late there's no way
this will mess up to you why is she
looking at your phone why is your phone
with her she looks at all your messages
that's an invasion of privacy back oh
why he comes around you die I just left
work I'll be there in about 15-20
minutes okay
she's not very happy well it looks like
he came at a good came at a good time so
last time I tried to surprise her diet
not only did she figure out that I was
waiting to surprise anybody but she also
made fun of me for it okay so he's got
drop her off and then leave don't you
think she don't you think she'd be home
alone - there's a little problem she
gets home so usually it takes off her
scar because she doesn't need to wear it
anymore so I need to figure out where I
need to be hiding like I don't want to
scare her in the kitchen I want to scare
her in her bedroom because so walk in I
can be right at the closet would be
perfect if she takes it off game over I
don't want to be right here in her
walking over there I want her walking
inside here all the way to her room and
I'll be right there I don't know if her
scarf will still be honored as if it's
off that's it I put a fake lip hartwig
around her hair didn't use the clip
now that I'm here what do you want to do
today hey you came uninvited I'm here
for a week but like my friend no since
when did your friends come before me

friends close and keep my enemies far
