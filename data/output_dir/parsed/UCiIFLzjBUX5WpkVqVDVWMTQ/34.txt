one of those surprise sneezes so you
didn't get time to like cover up you
just like and you know Matt has some
snot rockets dude because he always got
a little bug in and out of it and it's
just a mixture of laziness and try and
wanted to do something at the same exact
time what is that goal when you want to
change the world but from your bedroom

aspirations aspirations it's a little
morning talk about whatever heat this
cooking up with storm there with with

get the footage up first but I can't
post what he wants you guys you know in
the outro we had a puppet is just to
reset time minutes you eating for Eamon
it's just I'm thinking about this more
and more as as we're living here there's
a for how much we hate living in I just
really get so depressing somebody's
house so excited like I'm moving to an
apartment in the beginning I don't know
why we were so pumped about it's just it
just really bothers me
I was excited because I felt like it was
gonna be like a getaway you know like
there's always chaos at like Scott and
constantly always people there are
always like a commotion there's always
something going on no we have our own
spa yeah have like the whole time yeah
we don't have a backyard we don't have
the freedom to do whatever we want rules
are like size apartment and they're so
complaining about it that was a fly not
a beer I don't know what it was when it
touches me I hear well there's a bee or
an ak-47 what's it called what was those
planes about that okay for anybody's I'm
the gun what's the point
it's c4 to say yeah yeah oh man look
it's almost like we feel trapped in here
and like happening in the house you know
we don't expect be hit up all the time
it's just like every finger in the world
just like there's times where it's hard
to hit up everybody with Sophos
happening so you kind of have to just be
there all the time too hard to just be
like away from everybody in an apartment
and feels very secluded I obviously feel
like our videos have like kind of depth
a little bit oh yeah I can for is
talking about random bullshit bullshit
bands they're back in for the best
complain and whine and whine and
complain and complain and whine oh my
god
