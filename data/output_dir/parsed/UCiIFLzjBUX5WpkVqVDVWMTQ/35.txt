I didn't know that anybody could do that
I love appropriate in Japanese culture

Japanese okay but like boys also do that
too so you're just the silly little boy
ain't that right link all right but guys
this weekend we're going to life is
beautiful in Vegas man yeah guys drop
out of school watch our videos for me it
makes sense I've been on YouTube for
like two years now or whatever after a
couple years on YouTube people are like
oh I'm bored of this guy alright the
thing is it's gonna be like just like
vine we're like you're a really popping
and then like exactly there's a new
generation of youtubers and that's gonna
be the musically kids is earthquake
season two thing cuz I just think like
the amount of it would be like oh it's
earthquake season like tornado season
think it's interesting yesterday the
earthquake that happened in Mexico
cities on the exact same day is the big
earthquake that happened in 1985 in the
videos I was on Twitter it looked like a
movie
just a whole building falling down it is
so scary wait strip me out cause um it's
not like you know a hurricane or a flood
where you can see what's coming it's
this movement that's happening from
underneath you so like what's happening
like what movie yeah I've experienced
arcane's and hurricanes are scary but
there's something about the ground at
your on shaking it's just terrifying I
mean out of everything I feel like I've
experienced that quakes are the scariest
thing even when it's like even once a
little bit less it's shaking for Paislee
and then it's
your whole body just shuts down for five
seconds until it stops the freakiest
active exactly guys all the way Carly
has anxiety where it's hard for her to
drive anything with earthquakes or
driving I usually sent her a bit of free
throws I'm a good friend of planes every
time I'm boarding on a play cuz I have
really bad anxiety when it comes to
flights like I just hate flying she'll
send me a gift I guess do you do it with
it's funny didn't that happen coffee do
that happen recently where you found out
that the private jet you guys flew on to
Vegas you shouldn't have all my plane we
flew is that like a propeller plane even
you at the time I know it's really risky
to fly planes like that eat like you
should only flight like shortness is
like even to Vegas I was like a little
bit of like a risk I didn't know that
but like everybody was talking about I
was like why do we fly is plane no look
on your face when Aysen and David were
like no that was actually a really risky
plane that we like flew on you were like
if I knew that before I would have never
got on the times you hear about lanes
going down those type of planes are
always the ones that like do go down I
don't know hopefully that's like an
accurate statement I don't know but the
other night we experienced our first
earth well not a first earthquake
mother's earthquake all together like
normal we're all in our houses are gonna
apartments like separate two nights ago
it was like the six of us all together
and we felt the ground shake oh my god
it's an earthquake and we got over in
and like God have been freaked out
freaked out a little bit more than lenny
of us so like that became a discussion
of like you were like Brandon's like why
did you freak out so we didn't David it
was kind of like hard I'm like yeah why
I'm like why are we freaking out so much
that Brandon was like you see what
earthquakes
what have you seen what earthquakes
could do to cities and like I don't
think like David understood that I was
kind of like backing up right now I was
like no David like it's it's scary
earthquakes can literally destroy an
entire city if it's like that enough
because you never know what it is until
after it happened especially living in
LA is supposedly this big one that's
going to have San Andreas Fault that's
over
due it's been overdue for a long time
every time I'm leaving la scared that
I'm gonna be like trap in my mind if it
happens we're always gonna be surrounded
by fire
last thing I think of what I know I know
but you gotta earthquake is destruction
it will bring down a bridge what happens
do you want us to come get you at all or
do be sweet get on the freeway oh
absolutely not on to the topic the fear
of death David imagine you're in a plane
that was going down you know this is
like this is it like you're not like
your there's there's a 1% chance you're
gonna survive this David's like yeah I
wouldn't I wouldn't like I wouldn't like
freak out even you don't understand like
they're like your body you you would not
be calm and that was happening I think I
would be freaking out but in the moment
of knowing if a plane was going down I
would be very trying my best to myself
in the place where I just am entirely
grateful for the life I lived and trying
to make the mo more meaning as you were
crying and screaming when I wear that
mask and David's blog in my mind I would
be screaming I think like blackout if
that was happening I would have grabbed
to see in front me and just hold tight
close my eyes and just like hope for the
bus I'm gonna join or assist or I think
I'd actually be the one to circle I'm
probably opening up the exit door it
just slide towards a body of water
like olden days like it was a thing
everyone had a pair of shoes yeah they
actually do actually haven't been to
this new type of airplane that like the
Hulk if a plane was going down the whole
cabin can like retract from the flame
and then that light you if David was
like a psychopath
I had heard recently a few weeks ago
about this question people ask you to
determine if you're a psychopath it's
not an official legitimate way of
telling us um was a psychopath but it
can show a type of person you really
yeah doesn't say it was a psychological
test it's a psychopath test so like we
were getting prepared for that I weren't
really thinking like a psychopath or
trying to beat this question we're just
like okay we're gonna answer it just
naturally how we would if we were asked
a question though this is the question a
girl is at her mother's funeral while
she's at her mother's funeral she meets
a man she's never met before has never
seen this guy or heard of this guy and
right then and there she decides that
this is the love of her life that this
is the man that she wants and she just
decides him right then and there she
wants everything to do with this man a
few days later she kills her sister why
did she kill her sister as soon as he
asked us that question me Brandon and
Jason we also kind of said the same
answer because she found out the sister
was with the guy so she wanted to be
with the guy or she find out that her
sister was involved in her mom's dad was
her sister like cheating which are all
great answers yeah that means you're not
a psycho exactly no more than half a
second literally as soon as he got asked
a question he answered in this is what
he answered oh she killed him so she
could see him again in Matt's face he
looked like he just saw that
happens quick baby
stay safe a prepare to be helpful help
out your fellow neighbor what yeah
