ready yeah holy crap there's a there's a
fire truck where's the fire I mean
there's always like a fire truck
I can never see where the fires happen
I'm silly calling this last night like
why do fire extinguishers have to be so
dramatic you have to break a glass to
get the fire you sleep why can't they
just hang it there they do it for
security reasons like Oh someone's gonna
take the fire extinguisher use that to
put out a fire like we're already
freaking out oh my gosh there's a fire
oh no now we have to break glass not
just stick my hand through and probably
cut into an ambulance on top of calling
a fire truck are you kidding me even
have like a little hammer there how cute
even the one downstairs here has like
the whole glass thing because before
that remember I don't know it was in
schools right now but you sound like an
axon and a glad spot okay you were
saying there's no last night I don't
think I think in acts or like you said
it was an act to break the glass are you
gonna break the glass to grab this ax
like what are you gonna do with this I I
don't give you these dramatic Rob your
accent you're actually you're fine just
I think it's like chopped down doors no
they get the door if you're thinking
about like an apartment building or
schools they're not usually wooden doors
I feel like they're like I can't think
you're gonna tear though yeah like
something that can like melt the door
open or is that like an old thing this
is just cartoons unless I feel like I've
seen an axe in a box in the hallway so
many things in movies that you never see
in real life I never see like a woman
like feeding pigeons I was in New York
to actually saw at the port I never see
old lady feeding pigeons like it's just
like who wants to do that the cards are
gonna everywhere
look at you baby
Wow let's go know the babe I like you
you look straight up Maxine without
massage you go from Hawaii to Mexico
well I am a quarter maxi you would
detector from like a 70s cop right now
somebody's got bored seventies oh shit
you got there poeple when it comes to me
I obviously don't take care of my facial
hair when it comes to trimming or
shaving but what's your normal routine
is it difficult for you to find the
right razor or find the right shaving
cream because I every time I think about
having to Train I will always wait to go
to the barber what's your take on them
so with me I usually throw my facial I'm
headed out to like this leg which is
pretty thick for me even longer and have
to buzz it and I shave noticing a whole
process when I go to the store another
reason I all look exactly the same thing
I don't like looking for shaving green
