trick of the day whoa all right so I
usually don't blog like this I don't
normally like you know wake up hey guys
and just brush my teeth I'm gonna go to
the store so just tell you how my past
two three days of going since Monday
because I haven't been able to do much
I've been really sick last year I was
sick for like two three weeks I had the
worst flu I've never been so sick my
life and I was just taking
over-the-counter medication and I wasn't
getting any better and I was getting
worse and worse and my entire body felt
like I was just dying I just didn't want
to go a doctor because I don't want
spend the money I just thought it was
sick and I was just taking medicine but
I went to the doctor and the doctor
checked my lungs and gives me an x-ray
and tells me you should have came here
two weeks ago when you start against it
cuz now it's gotten really bad but you
have pneumonia and I had no idea what
that wasn't never even heard of it I
don't know exactly what it means but all
I know is that what I had was at a large
pack of mucus like it was the size of my
fist that's what the dark told me in my
lung it didn't make sense I'm like how
the hell I get that mucus out and the
doctor tells me you just got to take
antibiotics I took the antibiotics and
seven days later it didn't go away so
basically I started getting sick Monday
and started getting these dry coughs
just like the coughs I was getting when
I had pneumonia and I was like shit I
had pneumonia again I went to the doctor
the doctor told me you don't have
pneumonia and it came back and I started
getting the costs are getting worse and
worse I started getting a headache and
started getting a little flu-like I know
I have pneumonia I went back went to
another doctor
the doctor told me I didn't have
pneumonia and I feel like I still do and
I just want to get rid of it because ah

go home see my family

so like people that I didn't know really
hard to talk to you like group projects

myself instead of like getting a group
so you're not like a team worker but
dying to work with a team but usually I
end up doing all the work so you don't
you don't trust people now that I don't
trust people I'm just not good with
people I'm like antisocial and it's in a
certain sense and you can see that
