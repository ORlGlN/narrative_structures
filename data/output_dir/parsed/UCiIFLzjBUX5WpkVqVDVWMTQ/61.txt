struck has been stolen
so we don't think it ended out solve
this mystery baby let's go man this
ain't John very much okay so as you guys
know it's not weekend we were all that
playlist Heath and I and everybody else
I went out of town to 26 to go back home
to Florida see my family and he left
last Wednesday to come to Florida so we
can all drive up Friday so that's why I
was enable upload Monday this weekend's
did really hectic and lost my voice I
also had a lot to do and a lot of you
guys are out there so I didn't want to
like film too much I just wanted to meet
you guys I flew back in last night
Monday night I didn't look in the garage
I went straight to my room and I like
went to bed because I was exhausted I
flew in late and this morning I go to my
Jeep so I can drive to Scott and Todd
and his truck is gone as soon as I saw
that I didn't immediately think that his
truck was stolen I thought oh he's must
have let somebody like borrow the truck
was not Martha Tucker you know not how
to move furniture he just got a new
place yet you called me and you were
like that you had construct and I'm just
exactly called he didn't answer it takes
it and told me call me ASAP so I was
driving ask on Todd I just got there and
he calls me and I was like hey buddy
just just wondering you know your trucks
gone right and he goes what do you mean
my trucks come I might do to your trucks
not there did you know that someone's
going to borrow it while you're gone
he's like dude stop stop fucking me is
my truck gone like you Jeff your truck
sauce was gone and somebody has and then
starts freaking out and immediately I'm
like pay well before you freak out
obviously David pranks people all the
time you have a couple other people that
like to prank people so immediately I'm
like all right let me call David and see
if he has hang-up I call David Davis
just like no dude I don't have a truck
he would immediately told me because I
told him you're gonna call a cop I hung
God I call he's again I'm like your
truck is gone my Jeep wasn't broken into
I get to Scotts odds off I called the
police and like I tell them everything
and they told me that I can't really
call about a missing truck he has to
call but he's in Florida and he's not
home so when he called 9-1-1 it's kind
of direct his call to a police station
in florida so I called and I'm like let
me tell you
information so I tell them as much
information as I could and they didn't
seem really like no they're just like
okay like lost like stolen card they
didn't really care so he calls our
landlord she said there's security
cameras in our garage but she was like
at a seminar so she couldn't like a look
at the footage at the moment so we're
just like saying I'm like how did he's
like only he's stuck from this garage
it's by the way it's locked like you
need a code to get in we're so confused
I decided to go check my GP for his
spare key is gone I checked my gene and
it's fucking gone somebody broke into
our garage went into my G I don't know
if they broke in if it was unlike I lost
my Jeep every time I leave I can't see
my G+ vlog I told he's on like sheets
dude your spare key is gone for my team
he's like dude did you lock your G I'm
like dude I can't tell you if I lost my
Jeep or not but I'm like I'm telling you
right now I never leave my G unlocked I
keep it locked at all times it's my
fucking baby it just doesn't make sense
like how somebody come into our garage
go to my G find his key and then take
cheese truck like it so we feel like
somebody knew where we lived and
somebody knew that we were out of town
because out of all these days they
decided to do this they waited til we're
at playlists in Florida right now we
already call the cops like he'd already
filed a police report but we're trying
to figure out exactly what happened but
my landlord was able to send me
screenshots of the footage of the people
in the garage at first because I got
sent to he was like a little girl like a
little girl so he's Robin oh I looked at
all the pictures hold up the big guy on
a bike he's wearing all black his friend
is a little girl oh she wearing ugg
boots just judging the people that
slowly start right now
think I know this motherfucker serious
this kid you know how I don't know how
long have you look like that kid look at
that jawline that kid that I know has
that particular jawline who comes around
by his apartment all the time I already
checked his Instagram because I got
suspicious
dude be grateful I know maybe that's
what I do often but it's just ajust so
long if we put this in there though we
can't expose that kid of course we can
be stolen struggied you get that in here
I'll show you on my Instagram the thing
that is making me have doubt is the
bicycle - I really do think someone
around your apartment has been dealing
drugs I've been seeing really sketchy
people coming by late at night on out
and one of them in particular I know
their faces every time I walk a baby
look I'm not looking for your best
friends one of the guy always has a big
old
and the other guy looks just like that
what time is that 4:00 a.m. oh yeah okay
so my landlord told me that when I got
in last night just she was checking the
footage the truck was still there so
this happened while I was sleeping so
this happened within the past 12 hours
so they probably thought we were still
out of time another eggs would come on
yes this little oh yeah share it got my
laptop right here step number one we are
gonna check regs literally it's a red
Ford Lightning oh there it is I mean if
we type in Ford Lightning was recent one
that comes up no that's a month ago
David look they've already wrecked it
well what other sites would you be able
to post on for up calm if they stole
this car would they just post in no but
if they were dominar they would but you
know what they're dumb enough to rob a
car with security camera no maybe
they're dumb to rob all he is fun expose
them cuz we got but it shouldn't be not
allowed upset with these people on the
Internet we don't they saw you spoke in
Tehran we're thinking the matter into
our own hands every right to do this car
got stolen they knew we were out of town
they did it it will be today bori and
exactly we replaced our think I stole it
over the weekend or athletics we've
gotta get over there now they'll be gone
another day all right dad no he kicked
you this is the last time you need a
coat and 4:00 in the morning dude
there's no way that's they were waiting
on somebody to open the game but you're
not going to fit our apartment 4:00 in
the morning wait I'm going to leave for
it to open
like somebody let you in or you knew the
code we get it was interesting though
since a book by that is they live in the
neighborhood whoever stole it
live robbing two blocks away and wonder
which weren't the five hundred people
will wait out your door it could be Joe
that's what things like completely an
800 a.m. we need to go around the
neighborhood and look for people on I oh
let's make it a whole good night vision
goggles and we're just fucking driving
around every night in 14 even if we find
his truck we still we just want to catch
him you remember that one day those guys
who like ting me haha remember they were
outside looking at that was that really
nice car they had and they had one of
those mirror things and they were going
around it I remember I'm seeing that
were like what we questioned if I didn't
know if it was like a saint
white Mercedes when they did that and
the next time I saw them they were in a
different car baby Matt is figuring it
out tonight bottle what
that's David in the military baby can
you please stop making puns we need to
judge for Paris look at this guy that
dude fuckin stole you oh my god I mean
look at me we're going to footage again
the guy on the bike looks bigger than
those are deep gloves he is robbing shit
someone that would do this doesn't have
like a Twitter account yeah I had a
swell post a lot on Instagram yeah true
hell no he runs with a rough crew
laughing good dealing cocaine because
who's buying weed in Los Angeles when
it's legal out here and people who do
cocaine are up at 4:00 in the morning
there's a video of him on performing on
stage and his body looks just like the
body in the screenshot oh shit look
let's how he changes hat that's the Hat
oh my god Matt I think it is a hat I
think again I miss him but you think
it's a girl
Jayde already it's a jawline is a very
distinct JPEG come here go to the
picture of him this is the photo that
they have of him
he's wearing glove you dare Lee see it
but it's really big big logo only flat
brim yeah this is friend who looking
show the other kid with the very oh yeah
John I thought it was a girl I'm right
here this looks like he has black hair I
thought oh girl just like a girl he will
look at him he looks like a woman okay
go to go to his other pictures so hard
to be a criminal nowadays you know I
acted it he was looking through the kids
gram that he thinks that took any
fucking like one of his victory I'm
sorry
idiot was it three hours ago and I was
trying to see live that's what he
follows him so you probably got notified
that Matt King he's friend just like the
picture so right now they know that like
me so why would I like his phone you
know he's an illegal shit he's looking
through my bitch oh no I was already
zoom in on the - that is gonna help the
police you're ruining the investigation
Oh God geun-hye dream appointees coming
to the building that you just interfered
in tampering with evidence
I make no are like legislature doing I
like the Instagram photo we do something
even honest investigations making we
were up in air bread in the cashier was
like RIT as you change I'm like thank
you where were you at 4:00 a.m. last
night all right so right now we're on
our way to our landlords house because
she had the full footage of them moving
and everything we only have pictures but
not gonna need to see the movie identify
really their body types
maybe gender kind of like solidify if
they are who we suspect they are at the
moment if it is not the people we think
it is I'm just going to be taking note
down to the shoe down to the hair one of
the guys that I saw he'll put money down
that is any looks that's like in like
there was a video game performing on
stage and it like it you had me on the
same body type oh I can't believe though
his last instagrams wearing gloves
there's no motorcycle if you have gloves
like that you go motorcycle there's not
exactly just oh my god everything just
fits perfectly except for that but the
bicycle is the missing piece right why
are they riding around in a fight
because they every time I've seen them
it's been in a nice car they're
purposely trying to go into our
apartment to feel free in our apartment
why do they need a fight usually if
you're going to do have a bike you're
going to different apartment complexes
yeah but these kids that are affiliated
with this apartment why do you need we
call figured it out of this mister a
shit all I want is a Range Rover maybe
all I want is justice I wish she goes
with us right now because this truck you
know I'm back in Florida right now just
having to deal with his like truck being
missing we don't want to tell these
about this just yet because we don't
know if it's dumber I don't want to get
heat soaks up written we want to make
sure it's done then we're gonna tell
Heath and try to go from there
yes all right but we also know that they
were there between 401 and 408 a.m. you
have learned that through the footage
but we have not seen it yet but we know
that there were two suspects also the
buy of the bike there's with it heat all
right so what we now David is not the
suspect there you go but we also know
either
matt and i have now two different people
that we think it is because we are able
to fully see these two people like able
to see the second person that we didn't
know if was a boy or girl saw her more
what she was walking is often complex
and she was had like a full head of hair
right now we believe that she sent us an
e-mail a long time ago because of
something that she I don't want to talk
about it but it was like something
really weird that happen right now I'm
hunting down her old email she said and
trying to find her photo
she deleted her twitter and turned her
instagram on private sir oh that could
be her that length of the no no that
dude that should be heard that thing she
deleted her twitter and guess what her
old bio said what a dancing with the
devil we need to get to the security
camera footage now

in email sources they came in and
leaving straight for our court house
they know this book it's all right if
you like you know don't they don't have
depicted so we have ten rooms in here
sorted and no other room was like
tampered with except for our door and
our door has like all these marks on
Ian's going oh it's okay but are you
fucking kidding me
why did they take his bind but they
didn't take himself but because they're
so this person has been to your
apartment before you've read in our
complex where there's basically they
hold the footage in there the camera I

for it to open by how does she get okay
so this is another camera angle them in
the garage but we went to each car yeah
