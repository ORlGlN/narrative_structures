alright guys so right now I'm with hee
hey our our famous little spot if you
guys don't recognize this backyard this
is my house one of the spots that we
used to do a lot of our old line right
here was the good old Cremona dragon
viola moto dragon was staying right
there on that phone and it's so funny
that it was so in the moment when we saw
we literally said it and immediately
filmed it we were just saying gonna make
it if I were like oh yeah yo let's do
and we did think it was that good and we
had to put on our second we put in our
second channel cuz we didn't think it
was gonna be that good we were saying
yeah you know it's funny but like I
don't know and it ended up crushing
we're gonna go through some of our old
slash when we went through our vines
from before they were like really old
but really cringey they're really this
one is gonna start getting a little
dingy but still funny kind of but still
energy and in our opinion though we're
gonna go through some vines and hope I
hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoy it
oooh
what do you mean learn about my passcode
you wanna tell me your passcode I can
tell you mine that's good
hold on you knew my bathroom how many
times you go through photos sometimes
you leave it in the literal art I just
found out he knows my passcode so who
knows dad nobody's gone through my phone
ok little backstory here the throw of
that went into my face was this nasty
oatmeal mix oh we went out and like we
prepared it we got like two things uh-oh
meal it sit up I didn't even have it in
my mouth it was just in a cup where I
just wanna threw it into my mouth when
my mouth was open people thought that I
already had it in my mouth by the way
that I spit it back up but when he threw
it it went down my throat it hit down
here and I i threw it up and right after
the video ended i started hooking in the
pool there were kids in the pool in the
background oh my god it was crazy
because this is also the time where we
couldn't have to be perfect we couldn't
edit it we had to get each scene perfect
you couldn't even see what you had you
should just seen us at this pool with
his whole outfit on these kids watching
these parents watching me holding this
cup of omiyo just throwing it in his
face and you're just so comfy like what
the hell are these kids doing so sedessa
with a lollipop and everything we went
out and bought that lolly ball this is
we went on this idea that was like in
our heads like it just doesn't make
sense
boniva Central Park tonight J plane it's
a plane we did like a buildup so the
next video is gonna be like the part two
we didn't know what to do with vine if
it should be one continuous story line
and you like how he couldn't put audio
in there yet so we actually had to play
each scene but when we're on the next
thing we're waiting for that part of the
song to come and then play it it so this
is the build-up to our fight so let's
watch salad you hold on did you hear the
roar it confuses the shit out of me
every time I watch the roar Morrison it
sounds like a tiger or something like
rawr single serious load you ready
what is that every time I watch it I'm
like what the fuck made that sound fun
little backstory to this entire line so
first you see the whole sequence where
we did Dalton like that pan we saw Casey
James do it this is back then when we
didn't know that line was like a like a
thing yeah like we were making videos
for fun yeah so we saw is that oh cool
Casey James did a really cool idea and
let's just do that like in our fight
scene and we did that and when we posted
it that day Casey James vomited were
Casey Gees commented on our vibe we love
tisha haunted saying oh nice up dope
don't kill bill shot or don't kill bill
Shaw's like where'd you come up with
that or something like that like it was
a bad comment like he was coming hauless
out like saying we like and we were so
bummed out we're like dude our favorite
didn't call us up he was just like yo
dope shot clearly wanted like really
we're supposed to tag him in inside
inspired by but it was just it wasn't
even a thing back then yeah after that
we were just like okay we need to start
tagging people because we didn't know
that was like you just couldn't do that
and another one of it it took us how
long to set up those fucking lines three
hours to shoot this vibe I'll break into
a pool like a that had like this yard to
set it up and it took us that fucking
long and we ended up getting in trouble
right when we were finishing you know
what as bad as it was our that was
what the donut can't see mine whoa does
a movie Wow really long watching ya
editing skills yeah it's crazy cuz you
see that scene right in between the
first and second it was like a little
tiny little tiny if you accidentally
touch it you can move yes just like a
quick little but funny stuff when we did
that fine and we uploaded it he never
caught it no and we didn't catch it till
later on like maybe after a year we're
watching our vines again and we saw I'm
like how the hell did we not catch that
especially since we were so excited
making a superfish so quick
high school boys are so easy hey boys
dude that was actually our first vine
that we posted which was number one all
day how many hours was the number one a
lot until they took it down but just
walking home from school or like hey we
make videos can you guys help us out
real quick they were like yeah and we
told him like hey you guys know what a
vine is like yeah we made vines we'd
love for you to help us I was like hey
I'm gonna come up and say something and
then I'm gonna get out and chase you he
was like okay cool and then we did a
little backstory though if you water
foot yeah as I'm running right after the
video ends the sidewalk has like a
little dip into the grass and my foot
roll on the sidewalk so I rolled my
ankle my anger and then I fucking ate
shit I faced first it was right before
that will by ended any what I made it I
know perfect if they caught that fall oh
you still have it there's a lot my ankle
right here I see it I don't know they
kept you can see a Byerly that little
tiny scratch that I got ended up getting
infected by the invited what blew up so
fucking being I was in the hospital it
was viral but like you know what dude my
binder world at times good times man oh
my god we just a 30k followers wait how
many three I don't know like a lot oh
you're such a good girl though you're so
good at it such a good way
why and you're looking pretty fucking
cool a shinola I'm so heated right now
so i just got this meal obama full and
it didn't even come with vine oh they
have a number in their names egg but my
surprise they allowed us to do that look
at how bad the continuity is watch how
packed it is and then you wait until we
go in like you can see that we waited
till I was out in a packed nobody if we
were constant all that mr. Mosely with
you that sounded so bad from the opening
to that scene we thought it was so good
and like want that continuity and it
just saw the world watching it right
before like we could upload the actual
video onto the body so you can see us
off of that computers can you see it
this is when we first met Rob yeah this
is one of our first collabs excuse
implicit well she hosts off oh no the
bloody pad backstory this was a whole
set up besides walking we met up with
Louie dude and she had a whole studio
with a bunch of different shit like well
all that was all her and she had a blind
nice car she had the red carpet she had
this while she was filming it was a feat
it was literally a production for this
vibe and like now watching it's just
like this is the only bind were like
dude I really want this off her page and
he does just like dude you know I'm not
deleted we highly keep it up I'm like
fuck it's just so spot-on
left left runway look at you hold on all
family background skinny
I think that was the first part where we
went out in public and do something like
that how many times we had to do that
with Austin filming's or friends how to
go through a lot to help us so we really
respected that oh my god this one oh
yeah this is good yeah I'm just really
done making you stupid chick video fuck
downtown
bakit your glasses kill me this video
bad because then I look you look weird
Donald well skinny I didn't look good
because the video cut right before she
slammed my face but this lady her acting
was on point this was a hundred percent
staged you can't sit there and tell me
that that doesn't look real doesn't look
real is it for real to like four
different people before it and there was
just no reaction yeah it was just like
they were just like went up to her
random was like hey like we shoot these
videos anyway that you can pretend to be
mad at him why he's singing to you she's
like okay I'll do it one shot she killed
it we couldn't believe it
look this is one of my all-time favorite
vine 100 hundred cent stage that one
also people didn't know that that would
stay so you just couldn't tell sane hit
me so fucking hard I literally went
dizzy I got up afterwards and I was like
fuck and then I fell down into my chair
over here and I was like it rocked me
and I was so pissed because the video
fucking day this is back when fine would
fuck up like when you would upload it
and it said fine error that's it you
cannot save that video you cannot upload
it it's garbage nothing you could do
that video and that one was a one-shot
take and we couldn't do it again because
I just I couldn't stop him again he just
got so hurt that person it was so hard
for me to stop you like that especially
since you knew I was laughing you look
at what time the thing is he didn't
catch me with the fingers he hit me with
homme that's what hurts so it was just
like wow alright guys thanks for
