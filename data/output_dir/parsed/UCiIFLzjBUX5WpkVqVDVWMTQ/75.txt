sing on Thanksgiving times to try to get
every single person in our group to try
to sing lose your soul try to hit the

teabag not just anything else because

chamomile hello what and they hurt
what's sticking out within these teabag
Oh baby you just keep those tea bags
under eyes baby really sorry you're
putting lemon and ginger on your eyes

one hundreds of natural ingredients so
you're fine with the it's not supposed
to feel like this hold on hold on baby

why is beauty felt painful greater than
ingredients ginger root natural wah I
was a moment and I squeezed and just
went straight into my life fucking bitch
