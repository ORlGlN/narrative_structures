lottery tickets I don't know we kind of
got suckered into it we won like 20
bucks and we're like okay well now let's
go get more are you in that zone where
you just spend my $50 on lottery tickets

to do it positive actually da 300 he
thought he won on a ticket oh my god I
was like holy yeah we just won 50 bucks
so go in
so they got a lottery ticket and he
likes cans and he's like you didn't win
anything

him the letters I was like this is $50
if he was like in the system it doesn't
show up we go by the system not by like
you guys know but it's crazy he didn't
even like try to like examine it and try
to help you out at all like what is he
gonna do it like he he can't give it
away this is like I'm gonna tweet I'm
gonna send a letter it I'm gonna write a
letter and then I look on the bottom it
