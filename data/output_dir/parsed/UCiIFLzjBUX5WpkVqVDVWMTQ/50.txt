woke up this morning and saw that a game
of thrones released a new trailer for
the
season coming out today Game of Thrones
is it's like you know when there's a
show or movie on TV that just changes
your lighting automatically R because
that's their the same damn way it's like
it takes over everything that you think
about everything that you do we weren't
like phases began we didn't watch when
it first came out I think it was like
season I four or five three no cuz I
didn't start watching for like season
four five
I watched it live season for it while
they look because you went back with me
and we watched one two and three
together and then four came out exactly
yeah yeah I never liked the commit evils
honor of like movies and shows well I
watched in the first episode the end of
the first episode in Ramah oh okay it's
not a T it's a whole pod of all I was in
like all dream and the new students
coming out we're seeing billboards
everywhere can't stop thinking about it
oh this morning I quote retweeted the
trailer and gamer throats immediately

quoted through the reply and I said have
a boy one wish to attend the red
converse season for me both of us we
will do anything I swear it by the old
gods and the new
they favorited it but they never like
responded or anything maybe they could
be something up they didn't want to lay
I just want something to happen here I
would die with everything that they want
I would do more than post about I will
do anything for them to invite us to the
premiere of the highways of the sleeve
held yellow coffee beans want to tweet
out a thumb and say that any kid will
not any other red car that dumped to the
red car Vermeer that will be all you
