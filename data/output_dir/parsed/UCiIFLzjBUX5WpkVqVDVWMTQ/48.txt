can you please repeat what you just told
me to eat I got home today from one of
our officers cover so when is your trunk
it's been stored over at Keystone
Cullinan vain I store it look and try I
wanted to look inside to see if there
was anything left in there might be able
to test for D in any house of cigarettes
Janu must have been the people that took
the truck because there was a boy a girl
who sold the truck what condition okay
so they put paper over the rear license
plate did you find the people that took
the trial you have any names
well we the phone now go you had a
girlfriend in there or a friend and
maybe and let me hop in there reminds me
Dina cigarette buds I'll send him out to
be analyzed for DNA and I'll also send
the ink a top alchemy analyzed sometimes
I'll get the results back have been
abundant then I go from there okay I
just wanted to touch base with you and
let you know where your truck is over it
you still if you have any questions
about anything mom give me a call but as
it stands right now the only thing I can
do is book the items that I asked that
the mouth can be analyzed and that's you
what else bad for that is you're
creating furious okay so just kind of
just going to let them know that your
shorts we retrieved them if you want it
I'll give your feedback okay what do you
mean to some is I can still go get my
baby right truck up now but you have an
extra key you're gonna need that
otherwise guards today I'd see insurance
companies from now it's no water heats
trucks they've already taken care of
that dirty in here
thank you so much take it easy now thank
you so much like I cannot believe this
sounds are try dude I thought we do it
like that's it that was it there were
there were like your truck was never
gonna be thought of good I'm like enjoy
when you said even better Cheney more
like it just still buried enough control
difference
right now I know I'm in shock to trust
three gotta go see it you don't have it
you don't have that you don't have to
keep reeling to see money that's insane
I mean we thought they found her we
found her now we can't get her I thought
it was gone that's it he said all that
we could do like he was like out of town
when his truck went missing we did
everything we could to get the police as
much information as possible about this
truck how much sleep I lost thinking of
that truck right when I give up but it
is crazy as I get a scissor we all stop
thinking about it it gets about we like
you so now the insurance company has
that means they're going to try to sell
it and I think he's told me they're
gonna auction it off it's not fair that
like they're not giving his truck back I
don't know why he can't just send the
check that they gave him died and let
him have a struck back like I don't
understand why they couldn't do that
because they know it's worth something
yeah this are strong so all the videos
over their last truck is now worth way
more than what it was I want to find out
where that auction is and I'm just going
to be just like with my little big car
doing about 5,000 5,000 6,000 so big red
yeah I don't even know what was going to
be right before they start I just want
to get a megaphone go attention
attention everybody
so we make bids on this truck I want to
let you know a little story we come with
a drop screen with an overhead
protection all right this is where I
started they're starting out at an
auction it's going to be low and you're
going to start the opening bid like it
look forth out exactly well I don't
think they're going to start a 4th out I
think they're going to go a lot higher
because the insurance company's got to
try to make money off the truck exactly
but the truck is worth I don't know the
truck is worth less than what it's
listed because the insurance owns it
anything it goes up for auction the
starting point is lower what it is where
you've been all the bids go in and they
make it higher they got start in for
what it's worth and then it goes higher
it's already going to start low but I
think we have such a compelling story
where we can win over the horse and lots
of growth to her and she's already in it
maybe the auction was last week
he can't get this truck back and he came
I mean he kept he could try to find this
option but like this is going to be some
work that he has to try to get his own
truck back that he owe me not illegally
anymore but like he thought it was lost
and so he turned it in to the insurance
company it was ever going to be found
again and they found it and it's just
like heartbreaking that he can't get big
red down so I was like a little as a
reminder of big red Matt and I are going
to a wheel place or okay and like it's a
toy hobby shop that specializes like
model cars I looked on their website and
they think they know all those places
where you can build it well we know this
one is already like built they have it
on the website but I hope they have it
in the store but it's not I think if I
wasn't so we'll just do a Hot Wheels car
I thought that counts later but yeah we
get if we get the actual model truck
that's like a good size we should I'd be
so good I'd be freaking trying in your
apartment like we get some of those
place audio I didn't last long handled
thanks every day
that's so funny those candles I have
like the the holy and if we can't find
the hot wheels and we gonna have to hit
the Nana nonsense or get them loaded
changement we're going to be going to
Toys R Us and buying like a $300 to top
it off or something like that
the neighbors downstairs gonna be like
what the hell is that noise I soon
worked in her spot in the garage we're
pulling out of the spot when I looked up
the truck online on Amazon it said
differently ari left in stock who is
buying the 1999 Ford Lightning red sraw
there's also ones that people build or
is that the one already felt for the one
already built yeah that is crazy the
exploit Gartland
I used to have so many of these this is
bringing back memories well what about
this great Ford f-150 is that it not be
a silver Ford lightning hey guys so we
got the truck I want to spend a lot of
money on my babies so I got a really
expensive truck I wanted to like wrap it
open everything but I don't want to make
a super light here kind of wanted me to
translate all here like here he is like
I'm gonna put on your bed side so I keep
it in the box the box looks really
bruised you want to get our just like
decreasing the value by okay not it from
like a car collectible or it could be
worth something by keeping it in the box
but you know what just pull it out it
all come before I didn't know in the
model okay so it's not the exact
lightning but it's pretty close dad's
worth like damn it where are the
scissors
his body's toys I can't even open it
like that is always the barrio daddy you
open this one's even worse now your
brother's wish me don't you have a nice
this was went from thoughtful to just
inconvenient yeah I were just trying to
be nice hey baby you couldn't even take
office well then are we gonna return it
out there you shall later how do we get
to go oh no you got a screwdriver or you
come oh this is gonna be a mess like
just kids but it wasn't good for thought
I tell ya there nothing she ain't
everywhere I'm done he's gonna cry
easily this is a very I know we didn't
get heat exact chalk lining f150 but we
can at least try to make it look like it
so he had black rims we're just going to
call it a bit a wish or who can take
watch it's the thought that counts
okay then we didn't want to make it a
big deal it's like a little thing you
put on your bedside to figure remember
we got your lower dude just on this one
like nothing too great I put on a good
size notice about surprises stop Ronnie
beside you put in there and then I'll
turn oh yeah yeah yeah put it there
