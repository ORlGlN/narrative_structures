annoyed I walked into that
and I was I was envious the lifestyle

but you knew sheets and I were more
hopeless and I walked into your
apartment I was like damn he's got to
live it I even called my friend and I my
name in heat man I just met him like
they're excited or making looking for
the first miners I'm living by
themselves other parents but old estate
all from vibe and you think I was really
expensive you don't know what payments
are life when you move into the
apartment you gotta feel like the first
three months before you move Essen we
don't have like good credit or any
credit or often like thousands of
dollars just moving into a place and
then you're in an empty apartment and
you have to like now fill it on Nate and
he's moved out chalet they lived like
kings for two weeks I would say like
maybe cup bears in the trash out cuz I
want to get invited over a housewarming
party I hate parties and I never will
have a party again and like Keith
brought over like 14 of his friends I've
never met in my life
girl pissed on my lawn which is coming
up and then some girl threw up in the
back the river Matt literally I was like
this could never happen again
I left my own party to be outside David
gonna build a pool right there and if I
started go fun with a fuck-boy what
every time I do it I should perish if a
slut we she said everything you say I
just don't know if I should big a
seriously really get sarcastic when you
act we don't act it's the same just
because you're a really good actor
that's why it's a perfect shit that's a
nice button apply your good budget you
know that's what kind of student were
you
I couldn't pay attention in class I
always wanted to talk to somebody next
to me like I could never focus on the
teacher I was not good at us I was
really not attached I could study study
study a good thing is memorizing I
cannot memorize for my fuckin life so in
order for me to know the question I need
to understand that question and not
answer I use a lot of questions people
are just memorizing like you know
there's a lot of information you got to
put into your head before a test and
there's a lot of times where you just
forget you like read the closer you look
what was that is it and you don't
understand the whole point of Education
is you got to understand what you're
learning you can't make excuses like he
doesn't learn this way no no my my
parents didn't know that this is just
what I knew I was a very sea person by
headed D and I would go out of my way to
see the teacher and be like hey look I'm
not good at this is there any way I
could do a project do some extra credit
to like
but up to a seat I will shit hits the
fan and then I try to excel Jason I was
never good in school great
