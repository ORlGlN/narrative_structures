inside of my house would do while you

cut her hearing my try layers and you
look like an end of a pencil now you
just look like a thumb then I stop right
like really bad yeah we might hey you
didn't yell at him did you when they
mess it up wrong like fuck America
remember when he was at the concert and
someone said yells lady here I think
that was better than his hair now I
percent except he probably had a really
shitty story tell everybody like story
wanted to the never ago I know where he
went you with the street for cut fucking
the enemies a lot sake more like stupid
cut
you're showing when you're in I wear hot
because people know how shitty here you
try to have nice hair I don't try this I
quit my hair you come in you're giving
me shit you literally told me to pretend
I was asleep so that you could come in
and do this but I think you're gonna be
nice to me but what's that you come in
here you bastard on me like what is it
rolling my mind saying the other thing I
heard you I got to drive all the way to
Scott's out to wake them up whether you
ever fucking woken me up you already
played up three hours later than the
only time you're up at the same time as
me is when you sleep on the couch and I
walk out and you wake up all this anger
coming from a shitty haircut literally
one of them turn over a whole new leaf
if the tear could be a happier person
and now I'm like I'm just getting pissed
off again he said he used the words
happier I'm not ironically actually
meant it alright look Oh David fucking
fun thanks for sure I love your hair
thank you Wow look great if you would
not a fun bit a little silly DNA it
feels like it feels like a nuts a
composite so the girls I don't know
learn outside feels like it's like
hugging your grandpa a difficulties run
for again I found $5,000 why is a cat
that looks like that worth $5,000 and
unique to these make it it doesn't
require any clothes that's why it's so
expensive because it could take care of
itself is about a sweater actually about
money at Sephora a lot of people
probably I just I just learned this
today what do you have to do with this
cat everyday to take care of it every
day you gotta clean its ears and eyes
and nails and then you got to give it
three baths at least three baths a week
tonight
I can't figure my soul good member
mikela does it look at that look at
those nice oh my god you know what
those eyes are worth $5,000
