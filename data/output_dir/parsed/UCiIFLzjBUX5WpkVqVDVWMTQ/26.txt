just show you just keep getting stopped
by cops and I just won't be like putting
it on first cop was line II think your
plates on I'm like I know a man I've
just in a rush he's like an easier

last year's Halloween costume you were
the first-place trophy oh yeah we like

literally trying to just get up I was
supposed to be here waiting like second
place that night and I got just dumped I
really like the cops are pulling up and
you were like for the photo but the cop
was like what the hell is going on it
was really embarrassing especially since
I didn't know anybody at this party
every time I went up to someone new or
random like people were just like what
are you supposed to be I'm like
um I'm princess key your this year kind
of want to dress up as like a really
good name you know because the means are
in these days there's so many there's
good means and then there's just those
diamonds in the rocks we just try to
like really just think it crazy so we're
about to go into this into two clothings
yeah and see what we find there like so
we can film anything in the store we
basically found outfits that we want to
recreate a meme that we saw you guys I
think we're just gonna show Matt and I
spend so much time trying to figure out
what we wanted to be for home he's like
a specific funny mean and guess what we
see on Twitter the next day after we did
that cost you Myra it went viral
one of the most retweeted costumes this
year this guy and girl that like that
but they did it the day after Matt
posted I feel like they saw that and
then we didn't do Twitter or anything I
was gonna wait till day to do it cuz
where the video is gonna come out about
it I was too late and they let me do it
it got like over 300 k likes on it yeah
dude it's it's man I was so like excited
about posting on Twitter like doing the
safe because we got the same exact shots
remember I ran in the count it was two
random people that did it it's someone
big that tell somebody else to do it and
then they retweet it I feel like that's
how those accounts were insensitive Matt
Matt so I should have posed to be a
little bit I sorry I was actually kind
of depressed like for two days no Liza
but I feel like I have to put this out
right after you let people know we did a
friend I dressed up as incredible as
then people copied us to that's really
good and there's an original idea should
have been yzma or what's her name
ed not everybody that died with the cape
that's my favorite cartoon movie other
than up and better than a funny name
yeah
my favorite movies toys Josh it's mommy
and me boo the girlfriend who they
trying to look cute Halloween costume
init sound nobody goes for Halloween
yeah what is it basic ass bitches same
as last year I thought like you've grown
onto this like I thought it was just
like a new time you know when you
threatened me the day with a 95 any us
really know people dog 521 pilot
obsession is actually evolving every
Halloween this year he convinced me to
go as Josh dun I feel like you have
something on space okay all the time
it's like a different color I think that
you're just copying me because yeah I
had a pink beard first and now you want
to put it on your head it's flattering
to me you're actually gonna think that
I'm Josh down when I walk in it except
they're gonna be here eyebrows costume
is all gonna make sense until they see
