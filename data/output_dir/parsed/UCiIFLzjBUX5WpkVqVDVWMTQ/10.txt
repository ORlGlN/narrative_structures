supposed to sing along with it that is
so long you forgot what to do going on I
was just hype I was high
physical and emotional trauma you want
to tell me exactly what happened so we
can get this think it all started back
in oh six when I sued a Texas Roadhouse
for slipping on a buttered roll you know
I told them they're gonna hear from my
lawyer
this happens all the time I refuse to go
down I like full transparency between
both of us and certain actually yes it's
broken you know I just couldn't get an
actual neck brace I used my neck bail
over like a few fans outside the hotel
and we get into the car and the driver
goes you guys musicians really just
decide to live without the hesitation I
go yes um we're in a band
I am the guitarist he's the drummer I'm
just like no I'm the guitarist yeah were
the 19's okay and I'm like yeah we're
kind of like you know alternative indeed
PAH lead singer Matt Healy he's not with
us right now we're a big deal in one day
go through the songs and like oh wow and
change apart is it you used to have boom
and you're like yeah so for like five
six or started practicing really worried
that like oh my god this guy's gonna go
home and tell his daughter that like hey
met the 1975 tonight having a secret
show downtown in Chicago
guess you got tickets let me see it's
just like dad with for one second I
decided to do a little British like
we've been American this all time is
gonna go to the mall I just like telling
everybody you know we are actually good
you know we're we're in a bad car right
we're like we're in a band he's just
like oh yeah I'm like yeah the night
subside we're like we're just kidding
the whole time oh yeah have a good night
all right um it's a little flat he's
experienced you've done things before
yeah like what I tell you a story
this has happened the Bahamas maybe 12
years and 3,000 people arriving to the
Bahamas either talking about names and
the problem they said always have the
people that lose luggage so they change
a room the life where they think that
that's likely to belong to him and the
other key things I've learned to the
other person nobody find the bag until
the end of the program the meeting
planner is sitting with all the staff -
what are we gonna do with this problem I
was sitting I said we should do it how
we do it to Lebanon and she said and who
said that and how are you doing I said
Lou bringing the people when they
arrived the one who's sticking in
so long you forgot what to do going on I
was just high I was high apparently we
have to we have to be out of replace how
many it is 50 days 20 days so we have
failed to find any place or even close
to finding a place to not was supposed
to live with Heath and I but I think you
would rather live alone right now so
it's just me Heath enough that means we
got to find a to better in place but
there's no to better in places right now
so hard to find a two-bedroom but we
can't find anything good and we don't
want to find a place as smaller than our
apartment right now because it's hard to
film anything in there right now finding
things that are smaller and more
expensive a little under fun please
we're homeless for homeless and we have
to be in a cardboard box somewhere
that's fine too as long as I have why we
need to come up with some rules when we
move into our new place let's talk about
I feel like you don't really respect our
place you'd like to leave your stuff
everyone the dishes get loud and you
like to cook your food leaves everywhere
and it's just really rude and I just
think that we need to come up with some
ground rules for this so number one you
need to don't bestow a lot when you open
the doors just it's just it just gets so
loud because a lot of us need a lot of
you to wake up early in the morning to
start work to start work you're upset
that I open the doors mm yeah because
you have to get up early yeah the thing
is that I'm up so late because just
working all night on those soldiers on
passion projects
uh just doing the most you know making a
difference in the world from my mother
you woke up today at nine o'clock in the
morning and cleaned the entire apartment
that counter was disgusting it takes
about what three minutes oh if it takes
three minutes so why don't you ever do
it I do do it sometimes if I see it
really dirty I'll do it just don't
notice that I do it I vacuum the floors
you vacuum your floor no I vacuum the
whole kitchen no you did it I heard that
vacuum running through your bedroom in
my room drops on the floor you didn't
invite anything she comes just over the
door and just came in with the sparkly
top feet on the rug and was like oops
and then looked at her kid and they just
sat there and I was like and then it
started cool whatever
we'll be right back we're gonna get a
house right down the street on see
wherever you move baby why are we on the
street where we're supposed to grab
coffee that was the whole point of case
okay first time I'm using my new a DD
camera to film Kabhi talk and I'm big

shaky

worst thing I've ever experienced in my
lifetime Street is this completely for
having a very stressful last three days
stressful about what it's been not going
my way how's it not been going your way
what's out back and I ordered a
medium-rare steak
it was rough of your morning I woke up I
was a guard I was trying to be
productive have a good day I'm ready I'm
ready I pull out of the neighborhood I
pull up to the street I was getting
ready to turn on and I'm like okay here
we go
look at all the sudden this car starts
coming from this way he literally floors
it coming around the corner and there's
about a 10-foot long strip of water
about a foot deep I'm staying here and I
see it coming and I'm just like no it's
not whoa and a suna comes through my
window and what I'm talking about out of
a movie see this wave hits me your
outfit is drenched I had water dripping
all here this seat was flooded the
backseat the roof was when he started
hitting me before my car and then the
wave carried with it and like he does
fun oh there was already a big way
wanted to turn around
no like you wouldn't imagine I was like
you know what God is testing my patience
right realistically how mad are you and
that one thing is that I feel like
you're having it up a little bit like
you weren't that
you know whoever said of water went into
my car and how many put off me I was
literally hit happened and i sat there
it was the same bra and I was screaming
for like a minute you know man you have
to be to be alone and scream like them I
