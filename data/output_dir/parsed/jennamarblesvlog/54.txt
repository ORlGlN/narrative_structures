are welcome here so this vlog is the
footage that we took from VidCon 2014
which was by far the most large and
overwhelming are you okay yeah okay I
did a panel with Michelle song and uh
what's-his-name from Boise Boise Avenue
what are you doing I'm not doing
anything what did you do and Lily
superwoman and then I've got up on stage
for Susan's CEO of YouTube so the first
time I'm on stage is a panel and the
second time I on stage is for a keynote
and it was during business day which is
the Thursday which is why the crowds
like so Lively yeah not at all
it was so man it was stiff it was very
stiff and uptight and I got up there and
I was like Oh Susan you look beautiful
today and MS Letterman so that's the end
of this block Julian
yes I feel that feeling you do
I think one of the weirdest things for
me is when people are like oh you know
when this is all over like what do you
do and I'm like I would like to think
about life that way
like I like to live in the moment so
like I never had a plan for this so why
would have a plan for what comes after
this and I realized to say the f-word
cool that you own the special place
in my heart for me that's Hydra see my
name is Jun ho
no kidding
I have been a content creator on YouTube
for like four years and you probably
never going to see a commercial for me
on TV there's too many bad words in them
but I'm gonna be hosting for you two
places
you too
yes see I'm like what you guys loosen up
is please ska like come on you're gonna
rage or what
anyways Jenna focus the YouTube 15
seconds we will because
other things break and usually before
they do it radio a lot of times and the
Harlem shake just really cool stuff so
popped I can't wait and you look
beautiful today
I dare
what are they champion
and then around to the right
what is yet
hello I'm smouldering

Genovese are
