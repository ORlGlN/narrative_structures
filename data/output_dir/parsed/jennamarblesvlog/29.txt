bed dude like every single week probably
we have to there's pegs under the center
of the bed that just like sort of fall
out we start everything to try gluing
them we tried nailing them screwing them
like the fact that matter is the bed
frame is just not suited for our heavy
ass bed and it will continue to
break on a weekly basis so that they're
just like vacuuming and I don't know
what but it's not gonna work
dude okay either need a carpenter or I
don't know Jesus to hold that up because

you but we will be falling through the
bed at some point okay it'll kill the
monster that lives under there
