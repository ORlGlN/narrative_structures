um okay so I added this video finally
and by edit I mean I didn't really
 anything um so we shot this
video back in like October or something
it is now the middle of December it's
kind of been sitting on my computer but
basically what you're about to watch is
an epic nerf battle uh it's me max and
then our friends Geoff and Billy let me
explain to you how the game works so
that you're not like the man
watching me and Billy are on a team and
Geoff and Max are on a team each team
starts at either like the bottom of the
house the top of the house and the Angry
Birds stuffed animal is usually on the
couch it got really dirty after
a little while you're hiding the bird
this the camera died after a little
while so this is not nearly anywhere
close to how many games of this we
played but basically what happens is
everyone has nerf guns
obviously and the team from the top
comes down tries to get the bird and
bring it down to the other person's goal
basically or starting point in the team
at the bottom tries to do the same
things that get to the top every time
you get hit you have to run back to your
home base and drink your beer and then
keep playing from there uh and I I don't
know if you can tell from this video but
I do not like to lose and Max is the
biggest cheater maybe of all
time he's just he just cheats he's
 filthy um so it's getting
frustrating after a little while plus it
took this little while to realize that
being starting at the top is a
ridiculous advantage basically because
you can just corner the people
downstairs and just shoot them um but
and and if you ever hear the noise that
goes me or even even even that's an
electric gun like or like an automatic
gun and it was it turned out to be such
a advantage that we didn't
realize until you know ten games in that
Jack had it the whole time and I was
like why do we keep losing why do we
keep losing doesn't
for the top right of the bottom like we
just keep losing and there's no
way that's possible it's because they
had stupid electric gun like the rest of
us had to like pump and do it and his
just just stood and go clearly I mean we
out no matter what happens
so this is our nerf battle I mean
there's not really a whole lot of
excitement here to watch almost nerf
battle is your cup of tea but it was
very plan to play um I will say it's not
a very good drinking game you're not
gonna get that drunk you just end up
getting a cardiovascular workout in and
having a stomach full of beer so that's
about it but here's here's a sum of
footage from our nerf battle ready 5 4 3
