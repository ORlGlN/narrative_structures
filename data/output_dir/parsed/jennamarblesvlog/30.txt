I look super hot today I look super hot
today like everyday Rome just came over
to go over a bunch of stuff and she
brought Bowie who was her daughter's the
cutest thing in the whole world I see a
lot of you guys asking in the comments
who Rome it's like when she travels with
us right when we started working
together I did hire her as like an
assistant of sorts but not a personal
assistant shoes are just like a business
assistant so she would respond to emails
and do things like that but as we've
been working together she is actually
like the operations manager of my
company so she has a much higher role
than I think people think she has but
for the sake of keeping it simple yeah
if you call her my manager like that's
totally fine but she does like she runs
everything for me her and my mom like
work really closely together and
essentially run my entire company she is
a very important lady she basically
tells me what to do I'm kidding that's
who Rome is for those of you who were
wondering but she she is definitely not
like my assistant or like even manager
she is actually much more important than
that
she came over with her daughter Bowie
was so cute
and carmen was so sweet to her he was
just sitting on a chair like across from
her just staring at her and the eggies
are always so sweet this one you can't
be trusted around babies because it's
all fun and games and then you're like
zero dinging real quick but Kermit was
just sitting across from her and then
like slowly crawling towards her and
just kissing her face it at one point
Bowie opened her mouth and was like I
just go to first base dude right bud I'm
so proud of you you're so sweet too baby
song he's much better now because after
he met my niece who I think was one of
the first babies that he got to hang out
with he understood that you have to like
be gentle I know they smell so fun and
exciting and they're really cute very
comforting to see how sweet he is with a
little baby because I don't know buddy
you guys have dogs like these but it is
very stressful when they're around
babies or kids I'm like marble just keep
it together dude man come on it's a baby
don't it up that was nice
to have a little guy be so sweet and
Peach is always very sweet but she
because Bo is still so little she kind
of just like too excited so it takes her
a few minutes to calm down look at her
yeah help you little lady what you doing

stuff and my Sirius XM radio show should
be on and I don't know what we're doing
