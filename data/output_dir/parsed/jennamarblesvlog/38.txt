something and I did a blog because I had
to finish my Sirius XM radio show I'd
written some of it on the plane but I
didn't have Wi-Fi so I couldn't really
write all of it as soon as we got back

finished writing my show and then we
recorded it at 6 p.m. this here time we
are going to go explore around

would have vlog to recording my radio

actually blogged that process I will

we did it today even though we are
flying here and we're here we can do it
remotely that's all we have an internet
connection we can and the internet
connection was super super shoddy so I
was just like having to say lines over
and over and over and over and over

out but uh every ounce of my body would
like to let out but there's no time for
that because this time we'll go eat some
