really awesome game I don't know if
you've seen the vine like somebody
edited that Smash Mouth song all-star
you know you're an Elsa and there's a
vine okay they had cut it so it
literally says well the Years start
coming and they don't stop coming in the
Jos not coming and they don't stop cuz
it's the loop of that I have found that
a really fun game aside from seamlessly
working in Guy Fieri into as many
conversations as possible ask me a
question or say something to me like in
passing just anything
how old is mammals well the Years start
coming and they don't stop coming in
that's been my new favorite game right
now
cuz I know you're dying to know what I
do to trawl on Julian in my waking hours
of troll and then shoot me now you daddy
doesn't like when you get bones at
bedtime because he says that you get
weird so you are actually a crazy person
when I give you a bone can you view this
girl can you be a good girl you're gonna
be wicked don't make it weird
you're making it weird already no no no
you already chose the second she just
fits the second one like big crunch bite
out of it and also I read in the
comments don't give you delight in with
everywhere peach you just gonna leave it
like this I've also read in the comments
if you like don't give your dog bones
they're like FRA hides their chew treats
they are even little yeah they don't and
they don't get like more than one of
these they're just like a fun little
chewy teething treat for them are you
gonna make it weird don't make a weird
worm don't make it weird
Oh out of here forget it she dropped it
looking for more this everyone that's
on your hearing that's the sound of
insanity if it's making you insane
well your second comment I actually
asked Mars I was like mom was like cuz I
talked to him and I asked some questions
like mom was like how many bones would
it take for you to just like want to
just let the Iggy's run away you know it
was like well the bones start coming and
they don't stop coming
oh boo that one was no good no I like
your hair looks pretty tough that part
out those horrible no I'm leaving it in
I'm tired
everyone can see how funny your jokes
though like my honey I really AM you
mean expectations vs. reality your hair
looks really good it's that's almost ago
it's got like a Guy Fieri vibe tone yes
one point for me hi Ben how long we've
been together
would you feel sick to your coven in the
end you proud
okay yeah got it ever I had a couple of
like brilliant ones before you even
start button so don't act like I'm just
like what when did you quit what
brilliant ones am I missing
you said he really can you cut this up
and Rob lovely oh yeah but the longer
you leave it out like
I remember it okay you dick it was funny
you laugh no no I don't think I did now
is the portion of the evening where I'd
like to ask marbles a series of
questions you feel out you and your
breathing and you drinking
click enough do the years they start
coming obvious you wanna see Guy Fieri
house you like Guy Fieri you want to go
to bed he's so like calm and happy
really like he used to be angry but he
it's a world you know just the Years
start coming honestly us been really
nice to have marbles be a much more calm
dog and be a happy guy I don't know if
you guys have like pets I feel like once
they get past 6 or 7 they like
significantly calm down and just want to
like chill and be a dog it's like the
ear start gonna kick you're telling you
while I'm trying to tell you this
 if he was here guy theory would
troll is much harder you starting to
live that much longer he's a lot of
food you just start commenting and start
coming out the other joke that Julian
likes to say a lot that I do I'll give
you credit I think it's very funny like
he'll be doing something stupid
not be like Julian what are you doing
like all this is why you married me
we're like how you married me like July
we're not married
like I'm your husband you did this
Oh figure I do say that right do you
think that's so funny it is funny
you must be feeling happy and lucky that
you married someone this time it's like
that really gets me oh you
married me
you did and you're like no idea you
don't remember but you did
birra troll I'm pretty sure I'm married
to God here I mean in essence everyone's
married because I feel he's even food in
your wagon
you're married to that beautiful soul
that is guys here okay start coming it's
not coming he's just out there shoveling
down wings because the wings start
coming in and I just wanted to give you
ten are so happy minutes that's my day
seven you live you know part of me gets
angry the people are alike oh well like
you didn't show us all the things that
you did today
therefore they never existed or happen
the point of of ever sharing or vlogging
at least for me is like to just show you
something happy and fun that made me
laugh and happy that day so if you want
something else please go find that on
the internet as much as where as real as
can get with you like you have to
remember that we choose what to put on
the internet okay we do leave things up
because we have lives that we like to
just live shoulder oneself this is very
true and just please always remember
that you don't always a hundred percent
know everything that you think that you
know I know there's a lot of people that
just think that they know
everything man and also just because you
don't see things doesn't mean that they
don't exist I'm just like it's so hard
for me to understand how people could
find something to complain about like oh
dude you know what you're like so happy
this whole like ten minutes and
 you you dude you you
yeah you for you for
recording you and your friends throwing
plastic spoons into a cup for ten
minutes
clearly this bitch doesn't have a job so
that's why I well no no no dude this is
it this is a happy place and I will only
ever put up things that are just the
antithesis of what you I think want out
of someone if you want someone to like
brag about their life and how
important they are and how hard they
work you can find those chances
throughout the tongue you know they're
out there tell you right now oh my god I
will not do that for you you will not
find it here but that's right now this
bed just remember that the years start
coming in
a cup of pirate I'm gonna go to sleep
suggest tomorrow bye oh you married me
 yeah ten minutes in the marriage
and chillin he gives this look thinkin
he says he looks like a pug oh my god
good white balance babe my hands are
absolutely orange
well you you married me I was on my
nipples oh you're so feminine it'll stop
coming coming
oh alright goodbye
