oh hey Jen you don't look good are you
sick no so what I look like without any
makeup on like piece of
I wanted to show you something because
I'm so disappointed in my drunk self
when we shot my Christmas drunk
Pinterest Christmas whatever video
we found these letters you know like the
ones that everyone makes and their
little DIY and you're like poke holes in
them and put lights in them and they
spell out stupid words well they were on
like super sale at Michaels so the joke
was gonna be like oh I was gonna
make these until I realized it's a lot
cheaper just to buy them so we got some
letters and Julian just now lit them up
we've forgot to shoot it and put
it in the video I'm really upset about
it because they're really great but this
is what we got I think it adds a lot to
the house and it's really festive and
probably the coolest thing in the house
right now
just kidding I'm really upset it was
gonna be awesome so I'll probably save
those for another video someday if I can
work it in but Rome's coming over in a
second we're gonna have a meeting but
fingers crossed for Bowie am i right
what what's the matter no Bowie do they
know she's in the role three names to
troll you I love it do you love it I
love so much
you touch my wife oh my gosh guys oh my
god
stampede skaar brother sorry for not
posting a vlog miss I'm sure a lot of
you guys know that at the end of the
year on my main channel I posts two
weeks of extras so I can have time with
my family this year is rough
work man it is rough work data
management is like always a challenge
it's hard to always have it organized
and in the same place and in like
folders and a way that you can get at it
I've gone through more than two hard
drives this year they're huge and
there's been a couple occasions when as
I'm sitting down and do a video and
realize that my hard drive is like so
painfully full and something's got to
get deleted so I know in the past we've
gone through and like deleted we delete
a lot of things like podcasts and any
vlogs we just get rid of that footage
you can't keep it oh so you're gonna
 live in room full of hard drives
what's so disheartening about this
year's extras video is that I cannot
find for the life of me some of the
videos that I was like really excited
about going through the extras for like
for example the Kylie Jenner lip
challenge just doesn't exist it's
nowhere it's not on anything we checked
every hard drive every memory card and
I'm not gonna sit around be upset about
I just move forward but I have
been in a complete editing cave it is
exhausting tedious work to just sit
there and watch a year's worth of
footage I don't know why I deemed this
like a good idea keep doing it
for some reason if anyone was ever
wondering why certain videos are in the
extras videos and others aren't is
because just sometimes there's not
extras especially like if I'm sitting
down talking to the camera there's not
always like a ton of funny outtakes or
anything so that's why in the videos
they'll be like a lot for him like a few
videos and then only a couple from
others just because the the extras don't
exist but man dude sucks about
that kylie jenner lip challenge because
I wanted those Clips when Julian was
sucking my face we were like
dying laughing it's just too much
footage it's bound to happen but it's so
like like absolutely boring and
cringe-worthy to sit there and just
watch yourself do like back
funny things like over and over again
bitch shut up bitch you suck oh that's
why I didn't post a vlog I just needed
to delegate energy and focus so it went
to that I'm losing my mind a little I'm
not gonna live with him am i well I
don't know if you saw my Twitter but
like I got on Twitter for five
seconds and all of a sudden changed
everything to hold on let me show you
because I want this to live on even when
I changed my Twitter back to normal I
changed all my to boy clown
because someone was like Jenny or being
a boy and I was like yes I
finally made it as a boy yeah I'm
gonna bite my lip and Here I am
 boy clown we were going to try to
leave to go to Oregon tomorrow but
that's never gonna happen so we gotta
finish up a bunch of stuff and then
probably head out Tuesday so I'm very
excited about that have probably won
extras video completed and the other one
is still in the works so that needs to
be absolutely done by today you haven't
booked our hotels we need to do that I
wanted to tell you a quick story by the
way so Julian as I'm sure some of you
know loves Brazilian Jujitsu and he's
been doing it for a lot of years since
before I met him and I always bug him to
teach me I love watching it and I really
would like to try it
unfortunately Julian is just such a
bigger human than I am so sometimes it's
difficult although it's not that much of
a problem so for like the last few days
I'll go Julian do you want to do Jitsu
and we've been doing like on the bed
don't get any ideas not like that I was
very worried and the reason I was
worried it was because when Julian and I
first started dating and he was really
into jiu-jitsu he was like a much
smaller person because he was competing
it like 158 I don't know he was
a little he was like aw do you owe me a
teacher Simon I'm like yes and we were
you know obviously I was like flirting
jiu-jitsu flirt Jitsu and we were much
more evenly matched
like just size and weight and so I was
like giving him a little bit of a run
for his money
you know just fighting like a scrappy
girl and rolling around the next day I
was absolutely covered like in bruises
like all up and down my arms like the
insides and my legs were all bruised and
it looked horrible I don't bruise easily
ever but you know sometimes when you
just you get a bruise and you don't
I know why it's just really bad that was
what was happening today honestly and
I'm not trying to be offensive in any
way they looked like defensive bruises
like I you know had my hands up and
someone had just beat the out of
like my forearms and I remember
being like dude we just started
dating my friends are like oh it's uh
it's got a lot of bruises there how's
that uh a new guy you're dating
everything all right dude like no I
swear dude we just we've been doing all
of the jujitsu on the ground so we
haven't really like rolled around since
because I was very nervous that I was
gonna get really scary awful concerning
looking bruises but I did it so I'm
really happy about that which means that
we can do more Jitsu okay fun I like to
learn it's sometimes more fun than just
like working out and doing stupid adult
hamster you're like you know what
I'd like to go learn a new sport today
please hello bud you're my sweet little
gentleman I'll be bored but yeah I'm
bored
I want to go Oregon go outside do fun
stuff for dogs
lebesgue whoa made good progress I'm
almost done with that second extras
video so I feel better
totally snowed that we're almost there
Julian yeah it's like it's bittersweet
editing extras because the bitter part
is coming through hours and hours and
hours of footage all day but the sweet
part is laughing it demonstrate that you
did all year yeah I've done some dumb
Paul Webb was in this show Paul web
camera person
