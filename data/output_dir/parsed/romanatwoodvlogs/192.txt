whoo one more piece of the puzzle right
yeah no you got to do it right you know
you can't just have a rocket barrage
without the proper camo net
I think huge we got it all painted up I
think she I mean that's camo you would
not be able to see me in the woods
what do you think it is look check
yourself you see you didn't even see it
because it's camouflage I sitting here
with the most important question of the
night where we're going to put it and
we're looking where I belong pickup
trucks out here like the bed of a pickup
truck pretty ideal for this tripod you
know almost has to be my truck is up for
grabs
I'll donate my truck for the cost just
something about that Ford Ranger I like
yes yes I love seeing visions just come
together look at this
and hahaha looks ridiculous you shaking
your head the truck is go look at this
yeah you're right this is something to
be proud of chase we did it we did it
how you feeling you came out that door
with your head I was like I know it's a
great idea in the back of the truck
we're just trying to get anything I'm
just thinking we might as well use that
utilize this side field let's go out
there we're heading out to battle we got
the truck
granny you got to put on your war face

that looking at it who's that
Yoshii oh no oh oh oh
dudes this looks awesome
I seriously awesome I'm so happy you've
got a straw Lee's pump you guys ready
we're going to like we're going to
relate all these candles this is the
most tricky part seriously getting this
thing lit a lot of fuses there's three
of us we got three of those it's just
kind of planning like we get to start at
the center work our way out we pick like
sides
piece of cake right I mean in theory at
least we got the camouflage netting
we're going to spin this around and
shoot towards the big dirty field kids

carnival and you're trying to lock the
prisoner down to the water just unclose
