what's up guys good morning
as always beautiful and sunny in LA I
really messed up
I left the penny board at steve-o's
house last night inside to ride the
actual skateboard not as smooth I'm also
realizing that my Ohio wardrobe just
doesn't work in LA man it's so hot it
just feels too good here to be wearing
all black it's just like some serious
oatmeal here you're making so I'm off to
the office right now stuff for some
killer oatmeal I'll do berries and
bananas mmm anyway a head of the office
for the typical movie stuff god I can't
wait to make this movie man you guys are
gonna be so happy
all right so spending all day in the
meeting these guys are just so freaking
hard to work what's up guys guys ready
to party Oh
be like a kid god yeah oil all over my
lens bro did everyone oh sit here at the
meeting and Jared's got a great story
about um a prank that he did go ahead so
we were feeling with the Dudesons in a
town called Truckee and we decided that
we were going to build a 12-foot tall
snow ejaculating penis and you know we
went to get the permit to build this
thing we didn't say on the permit is
like describe the activity so we said oh
we're gonna build it you know we're
gonna wreck to 12-foot tall snow
sculpture that we want to dedicate to
the townspeople these guys are from
Finland so they wanted to give a gift to
America so um you know we put a curtain
around it we pull the curtain down into
the big cock the Dudesons are running
around it they start to spray the
ejaculation is big huge tub of white goo
just shooting all over the place we made
sure there were no minors around or
anything like that and you know do since
were like you know taking it in their
face and anyways the someone snapped a
picture of it and showed it to a friend
who showed it to a friend this was like
right when camera phones were starting
and eventually somebody saw it who
didn't think it was very funny MA the
news picked up on it my name got put it
on like a permit they had my cell phone
number on the permit they started
putting PDFs of that page on the news
I started getting death threats from the
people in Truckee I had to start to
restore like the legal was telling me I
had to record him to make sure that you
know just in case anyone ever tried to
do me any harm I had like you know
evidence of them trying to come after me
anyways eventually they sort of dropped
the suit they realized they didn't have
ground to stand on we did everything
basically by the book and a couple
months later I got a call from the same
city they said they had nominated me me
and the production for an award ha ha so
the same city that we tried to sue us
for the snow penis ended up we actually
ended up winning the award as a
