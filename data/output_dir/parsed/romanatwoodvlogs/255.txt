riding his bike home from school
yesterday afternoon
he shattered her windshield and flew
over the top of the car landed on the
ground behind the car by the grace of
God there was no one close enough behind
to hit him again he was taken by
helicopter to Children's Hospital st.
Petersburg Florida he scraped cut and
bruised everywhere and his left femur
was broken into three pieces he had
surgery last night they put a rod into
his bone there Mrak miraculously he had
no serious header internal organ
injuries he was so upset that the strap
of his smile more bookbag broke but
guess what the strap broke and the bag
flew up in his head hit the full smile
