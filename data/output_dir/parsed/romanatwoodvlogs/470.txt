welcome to the vlog I cannot even
explain to you how I woke up I've been
hacking coffee throat swollen gargling
like like an old Mack truck trying to
start up in the morning I was so rough
this morning you can still hear my voice
but I was so rough Brittany was like
what if I just help you today and take
the camera a little bit so you can do
your thing and not not be so stressed
out about grabbing the camera all the
time I was like hey we've actually never
tried that and they can see my point of
view from tour yeah so today we're gonna
do something we've never done and that
is we're gonna pass the camera back and
forth today uh it could be fun we've
never done that yeah so here we're in
Pittsburgh right now for our show it's
alive tonight and then we're home

headed Columbus from the show okay stall
stall sail more already so you say I'm
looking for Pocoyo who see sounds like

like we're extra exerting the gallon
we're like our throats party's not
prepared for my definitely yeah
everybody your energy to like here give
a lot of energy why my wholeness it's
your turn
yeah you know all day hey guys I love
how you're just smiling looking at the
other side thank you I love looking
through the screen and seeing yes oh
don't make me blush but is like the
first time today I'm just all smiles I
don't know I don't know hey if we're
late is because he was playing Pokemon
okay we got the grand momo bill nice sir
hey man I'm a minivan kind of man myself
not sure I can ever say I've been
downtown Pittsburgh man this is like a
first time for me
very excited before crisis camera back
to Bret I want to tell you a quick story
about last night we were leaving our
hotel and
and our bus is limited on pillows we had
to drive all night into Pittsburgh so I
tell Britt I said why don't you just
grab a pillow off the bed we'll go down
the lobby and we'll buy it from the
hotel we've done that in the past
usually hotels like yeah that's fine 20
30 bucks take it we go down to the hotel
and the lady and the man sitting there
said oh no we cannot say that Hotel we
don't have enough pillows in hotel
understandable I get it you guys not
enough pillows so therefore we can't buy
a pillow however the lady behind the
counter said why don't you just put it
in your bag and walk out with it and I
said well how does that help your
situation with a lack of pillows why in
our society we think it's okay to steal
rather than offer to pay for something I
was willing to pay for the pillow it is
never okay for us to steal don't steal
from people man I was willing to buy the
pillow I was willing to do my hair this
one okay I stole it look I know I have
to have that it's upsets me man I hate
these man I hate why is it okay to steal
the pillow but not pay for the bill I
don't know I'm just ranting right now
don't steal it's never okay that is not
you cannot justify it by saying you
should have put in your bag and walk out
with it and now that I saw the bill oh I
have to take my pillow talk that's my
pillow talk first hey there bro it's
your turn
so I also have this office tickets
because we're not oh I'm just down

Giancarlo just walked up and made us
smile more fanny packs because you know
they're the coolest thing ever
they're logical it's what we're supposed
to be wearing out right it's the safest
thing to have why asked if you could
supply the entire smile more sir with
