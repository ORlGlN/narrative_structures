drove two hours in the wrong direction
he's never been to this house so I don't
know how he did that
we should shoot him with the paint on
him oh my gosh that's so mean all right

overwhelming like you only eat a few
these you just eat until the bags gone
Cool Ranch it is we got the alcohol we

you don't even need your own camera to
film this prank we're gonna show you
exactly what he did he just he actually
just did this for real but we're gonna
try one now so explain explain how you
do this okay
a lot of businesses will have live
streaming webcams at their delhi the
restaurant to bar the cafe and they did
the deck this so this is a live camera
of this restaurant laugh and and then
what do you do well if you they always
provide the telephone number I call them
up and have a little fun check it out so
one of the one of the one of the hardest
parts about this prank is finding a
restaurant or bar that has a smooth
camera for now you guys totally totally
search and scour the internet for just
anything there's so many of there's so
many possibilities by the way this isn't
our prank we were supposed to film that
