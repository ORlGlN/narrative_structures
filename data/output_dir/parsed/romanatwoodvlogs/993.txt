I know like she why because she just
said that you should come in love that's
what she said
we've seen this big waterfall that
people go behind and we're trying to
find it which way
why sure oh it's right there spider in
the spider
now it's just the spider so as you guys
know yesterday's vlog went up really
really late I worked all day and I never
left the hotel - about 5:30 6 o'clock
p.m. just trying to get the vlog up but
I want to point something out even
though the vlog went up in time this
still happened watch ready it freezes it
just freezes that's not how I edited the
video let me show you how to edit
actually goes YouTube is being really
difficult for me this is what actually
happened see that totally different so
even after all this struggle to get that
video up there was still like a glitch
in the end the upload I don't know man
really frustrating at least it wasn't a
bad one it just froze on the boat but
just see you guys that's not how the
Edit was I did not do that freeze-frame
so we just realized that Brittany's
purse is gone not her purse but the
thing has both our IDs all our money
everything is gone
come on we got to go down there you had
it down you didn't bring it back up cuz
I just checked the vlog footage she's
holding it when I tried to get into that
little Club no you don't have it what
maybe you dropped it under the waterfall
on the way up did I have it I mean you
would have it now oh my god you are so
lucky our friggin IDs our money your
iPhone everything's in there
that was genuinely scary why I'm come
ready for just go to bed oh man we would
have been stuck in Hawaii so today's
been a lot of ups and downs man I wish
you guys could have seen me this morning
the vlog actually was supposed to start
with a little rant but I didn't want to
start the vlog with any negative energy
I hate negative energy but I was like
ranting and venting and I'm kind of
embarrassed probably to show you but
this is how the vault actually started
what's up my friends I'm gonna start
this vlog off with a little rant I never
do well let's see how beautiful it is I
saw it first
oh that's nice that's nice I've spent my
entire day in this hotel room it's 4:30
in the afternoon and why am I still in
this hotel room because yesterday's vlog
will not go on YouTube it's not in my
hands it fails every time and my brain
won't allow me to go out that door until
your vlog is up and it drives me nuts
that I can't do anything about it I've
got people in Los Angeles working on it
I've got everything you can think of I'm
working on but I can't do anything until
that blog is up all right my brain won't
allow it
I can't even function I wouldn't be
happy out there until the the vlog is up
so there's my little rant I'm struggling
like crazy it's I've lost the whole day
it's all it's 4:30 so it's gonna be
getting dark in one hour and the vlog is
still not up and I don't know what to do
but then eventually the vlog did go up
and I felt a lot better I was able to go
out with some energy and and everything
went good but then we lost her freakin
person it's time to go time to quit go
to bed sometimes you got to reset man
gotta reset it and I'm actually going to
wrap up the vlog Brittany's gonna
probably pass out before me and we're
going to start fresh tomorrow make a
good fresh day hopefully the vlog is up
smooth and I'm able to deliver on time I
love you guys thank you for all the
support and the likes and love on these
on these blogs summer
see you tomorrow wait what today's
question should be should Brahman
changes whole style to Hawaiian shore
shirts or just what he usually wears
yeah I told Brittany today I'm just
gonna start wearing Hawaiian shirts even
in Ohio this is gonna be my new thing
just so I can be different just so I'll
be the only one that does it like a new
Hawaiian shirt every day yeah yeah then
I'll never fly why not all right
we love you guys thanks so much for the
love we'll see you tomorrow funky fresh
keep a smile on your face your beautiful
smile more
