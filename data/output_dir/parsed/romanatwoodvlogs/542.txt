guys welcome to the vlog what exactly
are we doing here
we got black camp chambero and here
we're going to do a few experiments with
that it's a pump and it's chambered here
we got ivory so put it in that and suck
all the air out of this chamber and see
what happens there's a good chance
you're like me and you've never seen
this in your life a vacuum chamber and a
bar of soap I have no idea what to
expect
hope you guys are having an awesome day
we're going to start the experiments and
see what happens to that
wait you keep the sticker on I mean the
paper on it
oh we're gonna we're gonna tidy content
what do you think oh yeah let's go
you're the expert on this and hey before
we get started what is a vacuum chamber
meant to be used for actually I don't
know they use for a lot of different
things
virtual pump but vacuum chamber is for
experiments Oh science experiments
actually Oh perfect it's actually meant
for what we're about to do see what the
heck happened here Oh Susan is it yes oh
wow
whoa that's a fail all right we do have
much luck with the soap you want to
stick liquid nitrogen in the same yeah
that's like your stock yeah it will be
way better liquid nitrogen it is amazing
oh look at that
Oh when I don't my legs it's on my shirt
slowly look at that so cold it's minus
the economy I love this look at it like
that we're going to put this away you're
gonna put the vacuum chamber on top of
this yeah yes
let's just swing or we go
you go oh my god whoa you see it you're
looking it's all its ghostly lice and
then it stops so what we doing we make
your liquid nitrogen you can hold them
how cool is it when it freezes I don't
know all right
that was cool that work what do you
think that my long it was really did you
know you could freeze liquid nitrogen
again I'm learning a lot this I'm not
either but I learn it you can freeze
something at 2,300 degrees minus 300 and
then you froze it leave this see you
don't even need science class anymore
you just watch us me are your science
teachers now I've learned more in the
last three days that I think I did in
school period I never got to mess with
this stuff except not to explain
anything if you're just doing the demon
stage you just get to see the visuals
it's just accepts the important part
yeah lost you teach of hard works you
know that's pretty cool trust the Sun is

the thing for everybody that wants me to
do a burn on the gt-r it's all wheel
drive you can't do a Burnout like that's
that's what's special even if you put a
lot of water on all the bills maybe for
a split second notice probably got
computers slipping in it won't allow it
okay and you can't disengage the front
wheels not that I know of so you can't
you can't do a Burnout in that car and I
don't want to why not it's harder they
all look so cool it would look cool the
Z the blizzy would do it okay maybe I'll
do the O in the cop car yeah but your
GTR would be so cool and wedeck and all
right man we got to make a big decision
right now

point since I've been here a lot of
times I think I seen that last time but
neither one have a smoke but that's a
funny joke so this is a firework kit
that you can buy and tell me this
doesn't look like someone you know who's
that who's that like kids in candy store
man
I'm like a cute away yeah just pile it
on dude fireworks are the worst thing to
really like because they cost so much
and they only last seconds like a really
good one still lasts seconds
