another like five we please don't have
to figure out how to get her head down
for now everything's great looking good
Britain's healthy babies healthy canes

I wasn't captured like laying on the
couch there it's like measuring and
doing acting maybe to do it just comes
right up and up up being my forehead
we're doing all that we thought we'd do
something we have I can't even remember
the last time that we did this actually
we're going we're going to go eat that's
not a big deal at all but we do that all
the time we're gonna take came to the
movie theater we don't go to the movies
it's been really forever
Ramazan make us all of the classic
Russell before that I had been second
here's been a longtime practice we were
like going on deep heavily battle
remember anyway we're gonna take K to
the movie that you want to see baby boss
yeah he's been dying to see this movie
so we're going to try to do that today
for my little man I won't gotta block it
all right we're gonna take him out to
movies a little little a little daytime
fun
and this is why Kane likes coming here
cotton candy on top of your sprite so
good for you
what we are ylan like a little piece I
like Carol Michelle
like drinking sprite is about enough
watch again and good good change I have
been totally hooked on wedge salads like
it's so crispy coating just like I mean
look I don't like blue cheese but for
some reason I like it on the salad with
ranch I like to mix it so we're putting
a mistake so we're doing good we're
eating we're eating we got to get out of
here to make that movie bunny donkey new
baby pop how's that gum candy boy
so inside Cain said Vic this movie was
him taking me and Brittany on a date you
know that means I that means you got a
pen okay I ever brought your money okay
the bells y'all maybe when you're older
you can treat mommy and daddy to a movie
we got you okay let's have a seat get
buckled up we're going to go the movies
guys it's gonna be one of awkward
transitions where we just skip ahead to
ours and not film anything like your
normal transition today I think my
normal transition no because I can't
blog a move press that one press that
one I should come take a bamboo break
coming up watch the center topspin John
Krasinski I'll fold it hold it hold it
that's awesome
okay we're gonna watch boss baby babe on
each box baby okay I don't know what it
is for our
well that was fun it's so real is it
weird coming out it's daylight I got
some reason in the fear can't even ask
me like is it nighttime like Papa dude
it's still day nine it's so weird and
what the heck when I used to come to the
fields just eat or sleep now it's like
recliners and it's all my gosh it was
nice I think it made us all really
sleepy bit up see the air time let's see
the air time oh you can do better go to
go woo oh this I gotta see
I gotta see I think you're gonna clear
it you got this alright guys we've never
been out of use this garage from her car
but it's cleaning that well clean enough
for this guy hopefully let's go straight
back
you got it you got it okay this is the
weird spot keep going you got like 13
feet it won't let you okay custom
computer now but yeah but you're not
going to clear it here it's too long
take number two you got this baby come
on new angle new day don't be afraid to
get yet you you want to hug this wall as
close as possible
don't turn your wheel don't turn your
wheel there you go go straight back
stays close to this wall as possible
yeah you will you'll get it that's it
that's it if Kane was here he'd say
nailed it ain't forget it very Ollie we
mean maybe there's a team effort how
long have we had this how long we had
this like months and months right this
is the first time the gross has been
clean enough all right guys we just got
home and mobile it comes to me and she
says I don't want to cry but I have to
tell you something I immediately start
freaking out let's start with the
goodness there is some good news you got
your car back today yes we all know we
didn't do very good documenting this
mama'll record wrecked the car the blue
car that we did in the explosion prank
she got that today yes I did and it's
very nice to have it I love it
now the maybe bad bad news you like came
to me so scared I was like I don't want
to cry but I have said I feel like doing
crying because I'm so upset because I
wanted to do it so bad usually when your
grandma comes to you with she says she's
gonna cry I would think of something
else but she comes and she says her
doctor will not sign off and allow her
to go skydiving now your hearts healthy
yeah your brains healthy well that's
questionable but she was flying off on
the brain part marathon heart part did
lot she's healthy but her back and she
say about you to have arthritis does not
have deterioration of the some or
another and they're gone to dust I said
part of it gone to dust before I'm ready
to go right
don't you turn to dust specific um did
you say that's it
so guys we're trying to figure this out
doctor won't sign off on it she's really
really bummed because she has been I'm
not you guys know if you watch all the
time you've been wanting us caring for
absolutely everyone like you have been
not just asking me to take you you've
been like well give me to tell you when
we go up got it hey when we going
she turns 80 is why are you coming out
there maybe say I think the next step is
going to our chiropractor we know that
we trust it is so amazing with back yeah
maybe maybe we could get a chiropractor
to sign off weekly it was some time we
can see what I'll go anywhere to see if
he says no you're so sad about this I
think it's gonna work out either way
okay hopefully I don't know we can we
can go to another country they'll let
you scare us guy 19 oh that's an option
yeah I never heard tell of it you're
kidding yeah you lay down on a big fan
and it blows you welcome you pretty cool
I did it one time so guys let's root
root for a moment to pull this off
because we were going like we were going
soon she couldn't get the sign off so
now we're like trying to figure it out
we're gonna figure this out mama
promised if we can I'm gonna do what I
can
I'm gonna do everything I can otherwise
this is not meant to happen now keep you
saying you don't want to not be out of
walk that's what's most important
