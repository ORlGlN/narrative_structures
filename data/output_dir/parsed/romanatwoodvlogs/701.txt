hey hey guys happy new years oh my gosh
happy new years guys look this is the
aftermath of last night we lit up the
sky but man did it make a mess brought
the boys out to help me but I don't
think that's gonna happen we didn't even
use all of them I found these all these
and a whole mortar kit see yeah okay do
not ever try this but I've always wanted
to see what would happen if you threw a
mortar without the tube you know how to
shoot out of these tubes well what
happens if you just light one and throw
it that's what we're gonna find out
right in town probably not the greatest
idea I've ever had but that's what I'm
all about bad ideas I've got plenty of
shelter ha ha ha normally you would take
this and you would drop it into a
canister and it would shoot out I've
always wanted to just throw one out into
the yard like a grenade and see what
happens here we go whoa
that was totally awesome it was worth it
haha
are you ready give me five if you guys
watch this channel for a really really
long time I'm talking like almost the
beginning of time for this channel then
you guys remember something called dog
vs. Arce car that is what we're about to
do you ready I'm working sorry
I'll work yes doesn't involve you
alright guys so most of today believe it
or not was resetting this house Britney
you killed it she killed this place was
too should actually let me show you a
clip of when I walked in from a firework
thing
this place is untouched from last night
it is destroyed but everything is Britt
did all the cleaning then I got some RC
stuff out and we've just worked through
the kids were up till 3:30 last night so
are we and they were unloggable today
literally they were so Moody and grumpy
and cranky so we put him to bed early
early we put our foot down 9 o'clock
ever yeah so forgive us a little bit we
had to parent up man we put our feet
down today we had to step it up and
Brits got these ridiculous little things
that we want to try in the blog I don't
know what to expect you put that in your
ear yeah then you light it on fire
sounds like our type of block there but
you just lay on your side yeah like both
I guess you put this in your ear you lay
on your side and then you light this
piece on fire and it pulls everything
out of your ear right well it's got a
stop line that's good yeah just like
that
1 2 3 shoot ah oh so I got to go first
yeah ok oh my gosh and I just place it
my ear yeah how far smoke wait that's
not right does it still have we're gonna
set off the smoke alarms for sure oh
there's no way it's with smoke that much
no way do you want me to light it why
don't you put it in your ear and get it
comfortable first no it's a delight at
first
hahaha this is so funny
is it feel like it's in here like
comfortable yeah I feel like something's
wrong with mine yours is smoking just a
little it's really far down in my I
didn't yeah you told me to make it
straight so I would lose see
I think is what was going on you know
where there's no smoke coming out please
don't fire simply on fire
ah maybe a little no really like is it
like shooting sparks I mean the plate
does have some things like on fire but
I'm she catches my hair on fire it's not
it's it's over on this side not by your
hair seriously yeah but it's not bad
it's just like it's going on it smells
so bad that's cuz half the plate is on
fire
seriously yeah but it's fine don't move
put that screen up let me see
don't get freaked out not on fire you're
supposed to leave it in the whole time
oh my god so from your ear no no way
there's only nothing for like a minute
okay take two how far did you I thought
I mean it pretty light well it sounds
weird yeah you got it in there right
like who was the persons like let's do
put a candle in your ear I don't know
but it makes sense because the heat
sucks everything up yeah it rises so
it's creating like a massive vacuum no
way what is that that is not for my ear
this is oh you're gonna make me throw up
it's all the way up here's why it was
probably smoking because once it starts
getting blocked it smokes
no way yeah look at you just playing in
it you're scuffing your eyes okay so I
was freaking out because Britney did
hers that's hers and I was like that's
impossible and then I just did mine yeah
dude it's really healthy though I just
did this year I'm not even kidding this
ear seems so clogged to me yeah I want
to do this one though
I'll stir this is ridiculously cool
okay so there's a good chance that all
that craft you just saw is falling from
here and it's like burning down into the
bottom that was a bad explanation
basically the wax that burns off this
falls into the canister so uh what you
doing on your Friday night this is the
dumbest thing I've ever done
oh no it's not I guarantee a thousand
percent if anybody said I wonder what
Roman and Brittany are doing right now
this would be the very last option look
at this okay so I'm pretty convinced and
Brittany is too we don't know anything
about this but pretty convinced that all
that stuff is not coming out of our ears
that's actually falling in from a fire
right if there's anybody out there
that's ever done this tell us that can't
be coming out of our ears there's no way
all right guys that is gonna do it for
today we are we're just done like it was
a rough day off camera rough day on
camera not so bad but very weird day
lots of resistance lots of things um
like uh not working things just not
working and it was just just woke up
sleepwalking and he was so angry yes you
don't wake up a sleepwalker have you
heard that okay so I got an incredible
story for you guys um that just
triggered it actually before we go
Brittany's a sleepwalker like not you
haven't done for a while not that we
know of so a couple years ago well we
have I have a lot of good sleepwalking
stories but I don't think we've ever
told this one a couple years ago I was
filming downtown Columbus it was
probably 3:00 in the morning
was it a teen brain and I kept getting a
phone call from a number I didn't know I
never answer numbers I don't know it
ended up being Britney she slept walked
out of the house this house locked
herself out well before I went to bed I
was just thinking about locking one of
the inside doors right when you like
pull it shut it's not
stiff so you can lock yourself out
really easily
Britney wakes up in the middle and I she
walks out here by herself she goes
outside when you when you go you can
open it from the inside won't you go out
it's locked so she woke up outside in
her underwear you were in your underwear
she had to walk to one of the neighbours
houses in calming that was the random
number that was the number I wasn't
answering Kane was inside asleep but you
didn't think of that
I was just so worried he was in here by
himself yeah so basically uh no I
brought the fire department yeah then
break a window yeah but then I came back
home and Kane was awake and he came and
open the door apartment my gosh that is
a serious sleepwalking story out of the
house Wow least it was warm out
unbelievable so that's gonna leave us
with a question today do you or know
somebody slept walk and what's your best
story I had a friend a walk when I
was a kid and you sleep talk I think
everybody sleep talks yeah I always hear
like even Cain sleep toss really bad
yeah so tell me in the comments what's
your best sleepwalking story you've ever
heard or had or see there's some crazy
lunch people going into other people's
houses really yeah we love you guys I
