hey guys before this video starts we
just want to let you know that we
understand the qualities not the
greatest and the sound might be a little
off but we really wanted to try 360
video and this was the best we had I'm
not sure that it works on every web
browser I know it works on Chrome iPhone
Android just play around with it I hope
you enjoy it we had a lot of fun making
it look around you can rotate your
screen you can look around the room
check out Britney over here together it
goes straight behind go all the way back
rotate your whole screen
Sam macaronis here he brought this
amazing stuff it and and we just want to
have fun with this I've never seen this
before I thought let's try to be the
first vloggers to ever release a 360
blog so take a look around you can look
anywhere it's I think this is gonna be
the new way to look at video so let's
pick this baby out we're gonna take it
out we're learning with this as well so
we're gonna go out and test different
scenarios hand-holding different
environments let's have fun with this
today I hope you guys enjoy being able
look around you don't have to just stare
at my face anymore
yeah okay guys so this will be our first
attempt at hand holding this device I
have no idea what my arms gonna look
like for that matter if you're even
watching me watch it you could be
watching where we're driving yeah I
think even from here you can see our
speedometer you can you can be looking
anywhere you want which is the coolest
part of our hands yeah my chest right
there so if we're trying to regularly
vlog with this 360 we have no idea how
it's gonna work with hand-holding so
that's what we're doing right now what
are you watching right now leave it in
the comments cuz we're curious to see
like I wanna turn it towards you but I
don't have no coin rolling 360 right now
these guys can watch us or they can
watch Britney over there and sandwich
though so here we go the first out in
public 360 vlogging I it's so weird I
feel like I have to turn the camera to
show my friend this but you guys can
look around wherever you want you don't
have to listen to me I feel like it's
gonna distant what I'm saying from you
guys cuz you're gonna be too busy
looking around credit and hear what I
just said but look you can be my view
and you can just go forward yeah it's
like from your view okay so we need
cables yeah and we need charging what's
up man I'm going pretty good Oh see this
is so weird it's so strange and it's
just a normal camera like I'm just
walking around with my vlog cam oh here
cameras dated one lens David what you
point this does that do three six no no
old school old school is that like
boom-boom-boom
what are these regular blog cameras dude
my regular vlog camera now so boring how
am I ever gonna go back to normal blogs
I don't know I guess it's gonna be up to
you guys um I gonna say I love this or I
hate this this will be this will make
history as the first 360 food vlog ever
yeah 363 vlogs wait I no longer have to
show you can look you're so silly to me
this is one of the coolest things I've
ever done on this channel you guys have
control I think one thing pull about 160
can guys is I think it would be the best
situation for raw blogging I've been
talking about just hitting record and
vlogging and not cutting uncut well
imagine this working to set the camera
down and we can we can run our lives no
it's like I'm not pressured to be like
tell me right now look I mean they just
saw her steal your crime okay guys we
just killed some food we're all stuff
that like rats we are gonna head to the
local skate park area and and try some
360 with the guys there you guys can
chase them around and follow them around
I think it could be a cool addition to
this video we're gonna hopefully there's
people all right man we're gonna put it
on this box and get some 360 you guys
can just watch so I guess the hardest
thing to remember with these vlogs 360
is that you have to rotate the screen if
you want to see everything I'm kind of
setting it up letting it do its thing
and then you guys just get what you get
like I said we're totally
we're just leaving the skate park and
tell us if you know some words maybe too
hard to follow like skateboarders won by
real fast and you know let us know we're
just as new at this as you guys are
following it so you know let us know
what's fun to watch and what's too fast
and it's so hard to not rotate that's
the number one thing I cuz I'm a blogger
so I'm always moving hey what's up
what's up this one you just hold and let
you guys yeah I think you're trained if
someone makes a sound I watch your hand
just turn I'm working on it Monica's
knees I'm 360 and you've trying to sneak
over here doing your thing so we're
gonna run a lot of stuff that's going on
alright guys I don't have a waterproof
case for this camera so I'm gonna throw
it in this really crappy bag and put it
in the fish tank it's gonna look
terrible but it's all I have so here we
go here you go I need a water what are
you doing yeah for me vacay no it's good
it matches oh no you know what I love
about this camera looking at me they're
not looking at you anyway okay alright
guys that's all we got for you thanks so
much for watching and smile more you're
beautiful
