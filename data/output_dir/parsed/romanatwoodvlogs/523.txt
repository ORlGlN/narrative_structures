gray Oh red I think either one looks
good I think you're overthinking hi and
this is baggy how do you pick your pick
I'm not doing it I'm not doing it I know
where this leads by say one she says the
other and then that's it old days over I
love you
are you still sleeping are you sure
because I feel like you're gonna come
alive and you're gonna turn this place
upside down soon okay there we go
so today is our last day in Los Angeles
and I think the best place to start is
yesterday let's do a little throwback
because I did film yesterday but it did
not open so let's start there I'm going
to throw back and get all caught up
guys welcome to the vlog these are the
kind of weeks where I'm like I try to
give you a pre warning that I'm going to
be in meetings and I'm on phone calls
and it's gonna be really boring and I
just want to tell you like as a person
like myself as an entrepreneur as
somebody that doesn't necessarily go to
work 9:00 to 5:00 you have to always be
looking for the next thing it's like
being a surfer you catch that big wave
and you ride it into it hits the shore
and then you go out and you try to catch
another wave I guess what I'm saying is
just because you have something that's
great now you should always be trying to
go for that next thing and that's
exactly what I'm all about I've always
been that way I like hustling like
moving I like I like trying to create
the next thing so I'm in LA right now
working on some really big things that
I've had to keep a secret I've been
working on them for many months my dad
always used to say something to me
because he was a workaholic man my dad
always worked and growing up his little
kid watching my dad worked so hard and
so much I couldn't understand dad why
are you going to work why are you going
to work and he always told me he always
said Roman I am gonna plant the tree
that shades you and that little line
right there has stuck with me through my
whole life and that's exactly what I'm
always trying to do for my kids man I
want to kill it right now my kids have a
good future my kids have an awesome
future I'm getting off track here but
what I'm trying to say is this week is
kind of lame yes I would rather be at
home blowing something up or hitting
some ramps driving some RC cars but
right now it's like a teeter-totter
between business and family and you have
to find that balance that everything
works anyway guys just thanks for being
here thanks for being here I'm not
always just the exciting vlogs or the
catchy thumbnails thanks for watching
every day man let's start this vlog it

here's the thing are you smiling no no
like it because you're going to think
I'm joking right off the bat but like
we've been talking even like with my
family at home my parents my management
everybody's really concerned I'm
concerned about the tour like I don't
know how to explain it but like
everything you're going through right
now you're like the drama the the
negativity is like I'm seriously
concerned about the tour what are you
concerned about
I just dude I'm like promoting happiness
everyday I'm promoting my brand is
smiling like I I want my viewers to be
nothing but just happy all the time
okay and when we're going on this tour
like originally it was like that's all
it was about and now I just feel like
with all the negativity that your brain
around like I love you to death
hey are you saying oh like I I don't
even know how to explain this like
without Roman how happy have I been
recently I know you are how positive
have I been I ever texted you as happy
as I've been texting you I know I'm not
happy about I haven't ever in my life
like ever since I've got out of the
depression I've never been this happy
and positive all the stuff I'm going
through right now
it's the promote positivity but it's
just such a it got misinterpreted in the
delivery and what I'm really trying to
say dude I get it and you're right your
hat dude you're happy like I can see it
yeah a my heart on my so excited tour so
where's the issue I don't know I really
don't get what you guys are trying to
say right now like long story short I
like I cancelled the tour today like I
actually canceled the tour today I don't
have Mills talk to you about it I told
him not to say anything until I spoke to
you in person but like dude I got a
family like it's not worth it to me be
like bringing all this negative energy
dude like I want to promote nothing but
good no I know you think I'm joking
right now sorry I just like it's just
it's crazy we're like it's a it's bad
for everybody it's just not worth it to
us you like my brother and you're not
you're gonna literally not even talk to
you for a game that I I know you're
going through so much I did not want to
bring this up but I
like literally doing stuff like this to
