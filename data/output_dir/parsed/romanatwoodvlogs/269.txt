know I've never had trash before it
doesn't have a year but you must have
been really young when Roman asked Noah
if he did good cutting out the bear pick
from school
Noah said well I think I did good all
the other kids were cutting their arms
in place I said Brittany Road alley

did good when you talk about Noah's head
here's a picture of Noah and my mom and
his head is I think about the same sizes
my mom and he's only like two there my
first concert ever
I remember the silverstein I took you my
favorite band

I think we've said that one in the vlogs
before that I took Britney her first
concert was silverstein and it was fun
as that the new part wasn't it
Oh like nasty stuff dripping down on
table oh I found a little love letter
from Indiana James drawing don't do it

idea how much you mean to me and it's
very hard to put it on paper that I

written in my life you've got the most
pages are you doing Britney on that we
used to write each other like great like
letters and letters and letters almost
daily would write each other and come
home from work and she'd have a letter
for me it was awesome
what else we gotten a good box to find
today because we you know me I could
have a lot for you today so this is good
this is real life awesome business I
think to me what we want to remember is
putting our old memories that are going
to fall apart and rock on the video
crews I kept every day oh thanks
somewhere kind of joking around about
Britney out when she was a little baby
she didn't have hair like for this is
just one year this is her one years old
and we're thinking like is our little
baby girl gonna have any hair for a
while so check it out so this is Britney
at one and she just has barely any hair
that how does a nice trip down memory
lane and what you guys doing oh my gosh
yes I can't keep up with you guys is
craziness today all right I know this
can start a lot of arguments I'm going
to be very careful with my words
PlayStation controllers they're always
dead they're always dead like I'm not
kidding I can plug them in all day and
for some reason when I go to grab them
and I've done all the power saving
things I know I'm about to turn my house
