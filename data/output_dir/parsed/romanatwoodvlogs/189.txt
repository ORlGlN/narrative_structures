in my opinion this is the greatest idea
I've come up with in a long time okay so
I need you guys to be with me I need no
matter what I say you're starting it yep
what are you started it first this is 73
mm hi guys welcome to the log let's go
I'm Chuck
I'm so excited about this idea I just
want to tell the boys are you in I told
you you're in you're gonna love it oh
yeah I always do don't I Veronica
nobody has to clean it it can stay now
all right guys here's the deal it is
beautiful it is sunny it is gorgeous
outside don't make me cut the power to
the house we're just going to tell you
I'm ready I've been giving this a lot of
thought we have a pool right and we have
a ton of plastic play balls what if we
took all the play balls and put it in
the pool would it be cool yeah okay well
this is the thing it's going to take
some time and effort and work because we
got to bring them from downstairs
upstairs into the pool dude it'll be a
blast imagine what it looks like
underneath the pool looking up you want
to do it let's do it let's do it you do
whatever you want me and the boys are
taking over today
by the way today's our full no tonight
will be the biggest moon I've seen in a
very long time and it should huh
tonight is a full man V full moon the
one and only not yeah it looked full
last night but tonight's actually the
full moon which means we're going to
call it the labor moon if she comes
tonight this in case you're totally new
to this channel and you don't remember a
couple years ago we did a ball pit video
where we filled this entire house with
balls we still have a bunch of those
leftover and here they sit this is the
ultimate pile this is an actual bag from
the ball pit video these are the same
balls that used to be up in the
or bedroom so basically they're just
sitting here doing nothing
so let's put them in a pool okay it
should take a lot of carry all these
bags up well once we get them out we
just start dumping so I say I say we
bring them all out before we dump them
like get the build up you know what I
mean yeah let's do this okay we've got a
good start this is I don't know how many
bags are here I don't think that's
enough to even cover the top layer but
we have another big bag we have a giant
bag downstairs that's last resort
because it is so difficult to move I
think we're going to take it out in
pieces you want dump these and see what
we got you know throw man
okay here's the front wow that matches
my shirt look at that that is 1818 trash
bags full of bull didn't he I would say
exactly half the poem maybe a little
more than hat that looks amazing so
basically we got a haul up that giant
bag I think one bucket at a time because
the bag doesn't fit up the steps or
through doorways so it weighs about 140
pounds yeah we need more like skittles
from here it's gonna take way way longer
than I thought it looks like one bucket
at a time bags huge
yeah oh yeah it's going together it's
coming together
it'd be a lot quicker to Dumbo it'd be a
lot quicker to double you're missing
half of them
awesome overboard there we go dump oh
now you can just let you have it got it
there you go there you go
Wow
I did a lot at least I'd like it's not a
heavy totally tell them donkey tell them
doggie
I know I know let it out so this pulls
almost folded it's almost full that
satisfied they just sink in
imagine how like long it's taking to get
the balls in the pool how we getting
them out of the fold like literally one
by one and then you got to dry them off
it's a horrible idea who comes up with
this stuff amp two more trips two more
trips in this pool is completely boss I
did a lot of rat look at this how cool
is that
look at that that's amazing
slash suppose full when the ball can no
longer find a spot when it can't Oh
watch watch watch watch oh oh oh
I can't go down oh I think we're full
gain you need a paddle so you can paddle
through that's awesome
okay wonder if you're gonna splash balls
I don't know ready I'll follow you ready
do it
whoa it makes way he's gone here we go
that's amazing okay
well it's almost hard to get out of that
thing we're gonna I'm actually dying to
see this footage don't on a buzzer what
if you want to get in so bad just get in
then what you're trying to say no you
want food bingo how about um Oh halfway
