almost positive that this morning they
were either breeding livestock upstairs
or doing some type of like showing of
small circus animals so here we go let
the journey begin
I'll tell you one thing right now the
City of LA has a way of motivating you
just by the weather it picks you up and
gives you vitamin B look at these little
palm trees man maybe it's just something
guy from Ohio appreciates but I guess it
could be totally opposite to this
weather could make you lazy and relaxed
and comfortable guess it just depends on
how you take it so here we go guys we
got Amelia she's gonna be with us for
the next three weeks she is like I hate
sins but you gotta be the bad guy on
this trip maybe she business is back
here with some money we are about to

better be out of that hotel at 8 a.m. I
will be waiting for you we have meetings
that 9:00 9:30 10:00 10:30 11:30 so
she's business she's gotta keep us long
truck I know I got that I got the scowl

needs done she knows how to do it so
