exciting try the most exciting thing I
have ever done today let's go to the
chiropractor
the chiropractor baby is what nine weeks
away yeah nine weeks yesterday nine
weeks Justin she was just kicking and
hitting and swinging and throwing
punches over here and I missed it oh man
I said a car wash that was that
exercising
hope you guys are having a great day we
are just cruising the chiropractor I
tried to make it sound fun but it's
really not my back has been out all week
I've been in a lot of pain been hiding
it completely from you guys I've showed
no signs of pain unless you spotted it
I've done pretty good oh I'm now an
actor like my action job you can't show
your pain I nailed that part we're going
right now to get the cracking going and
yeah we're just going to start this vlog
up you guys are having a great day
wonderful Tom hope your smile I'm
thinking positive is like kind of ugly
out but super nice like it feels good
five minutes early baby we're never
we're never even on time let alone but
all I didn't play a treat for Gordie I
didn't bring it I said I'd never come
back here again without a treat I just
did we eat almonds know that they're
healthy I know autism no it's just going
to be a minute before it comes here and
realizes I don't have a treat there he
is I'm going to break your heart two of
them I'm glad I didn't bring a treat
because I would have totally
disappointed one of them so this is the
secret drawer this is this is the drawer
I use when I forget the treats for the
celebrate lucky searched and searched
and look I got you I got you I got you I
got you one too
as little okay so what we're doing right
now is the baby's breech meaning the
head is high then her feet are down and
what we need to get is the baby head
down and it's kind of a technique here
with the chiropractor kind of weird to
think about you can do this while she's
pretty
- so I'll be low pregnant yeah mm-hmm
yeah and since we're still like whistle
nine weeks 10 weeks away from the baby
it's good to get an early start
I'm trying to get this baby in the right
position so I don't know you think it's
gonna rain and cast your vote it's
coming I feel so much better I just get
my part but um man my back system lately
as I'm Kim so I got I don't know if you
guys have this problem where you live
but we have crazy bugs you see these all
splatters destruction of bug barely that
basically can't have a clean car this
time you're actually mostly through the
summer the bug is so heavy that one
night out you will have just coverage
all over the front of your car it's kind
of sick and it's so hard to get off like
it is so difficult I've tried like every
type of spray and chemical and soap and
the things are like permanent terrible
and it's not like it's raining yes it's
kind of disgusting
but it's true it's like they make like
these clear covers for your car they
kind of go over the paint but then you
got like a clear coat is just you just
can't wait
buzz-buzz when you're on their territory
we built roads with a bug territory we
distract killing oh you're sorry now
yeah bug territory you know about bugs
Arizona I'd have studied bugs right know
about it they go I seventy straight to
the heart of it so here's the thing guys
it may seem like Brittany and I are
always together but we're actually doing
a lot of things where we're not together
we've been trying over the last few
weeks to come out with like like not
come out have an official date night
each week where it's like Wednesday
Thursday whatever day it is we're going
on a date today that accidentally
happened we were like we got to go out
and do some stuff but now it's turning
into kind of a date night and I'm
vlogging in public and it's really
embarrassing and everyone's looking at

our date with what they gave us ideas we
had to like that was our date based off
a comment you know I mean like we screen

Hummer I feel like a big shot

Ripley we got a massive to-go box just
the butter so you get just you know the
chiropractor told me that he said that I
need to bring back the push-ups that we
did in the vlogs because I need to do
exercises and he said the type I needed
push-ups are great run squats lunges
let's not get carried away all right
reveal you got em all ready buff enough
you need bigger my shirts gonna rip off
my by you know it's not my legs it's my
gym what's the one with chicken legs
anyway chickens are fine do you think
chickens make fun of their legs no no
they don't I come here I gotta show you
something real fast all right okay yeah
come here
check this out come here come here look
in here now I don't think the babies are
don't know you're too close for look I'm
going to show you guys I'll show you
guys real quick all Mama's in there I
don't I don't want to disturb them not
all so it's like Brit right now what up
amp
what up pants we should talk about this
what is DejaVu that's a great process
and it's like it actually has you in
your brain did something here's my
thought on it and this is not my period
it feels like something has happened
already right but my might what I've
heard that stuck to me the most was your
brain you're actually remembering a
split second ago as if it was a memory
that you had a long time ago right so
maybe deja vu is not something that's
already happened it's actually a memory
of a second ago this actually did happen
though we didn't have a donkey
it was like flowers or something no a
bee or something
it feels like it's a memory and does
anybody know what deja vu is I think my
students not my theory that theory is
one of the best that I've heard you're
just remembering a split second ago for
the record without flash I don't think
we'd ever get donkey in oh geez ready up
up and away the back of our house you
guys knows all destroyed they were
bulldozing it today and basically we
couldn't get donkey inside because the
Ghana bulldozer didn't feel like safe
with donkey walking around he's so
curious like he wants to see what's
going on funniest thing the Builder like
I was having a letter back door here I
think we just need to get the dog and
donkey in because they're a little
curious you know not you can't see very
good around these things like okay I
literally see the donkey run past the
door like full-on like running to see my
sister chasing I was like crying 11 so
hard now the reason we put him in at
night he has stayed out before one night
I think we let him stay out one night
the reason we put them in is because of
the Coyotes and I don't know if he can
take a pack of coyotes but I don't want
to say young you just turn three yes I
am so if you had another donkey I think
they'd be fine together because a
donkey's are like the guard of the farm
like they say they can take like a pack
of hos but he is young he's only three
he's little a little baby pants there's
aa petition go whoa okay almost almost a
whole half second what okay you've never
done a handstand me would come on get it
commit go straight up straight up head
down legs up oh all the way up all the
way up come on
come on hold it the worm sleep sleep
perfect
you understand sleep perfect there's
only one rule the whole night sleep
perfect I love you hey you know it's

don't don't
dun-dun-dun anyway it's like one of my
favorite hello this is how you end a
night this is it you work I work this is
our this is our life our crazy date
night so this is probably a perfect time
to like segue into like our normal our
normal night like you see it would seem
that we just go to bed together and we
we're a normal couple but it is not the
case at all
we actually very very very rarely do we
actually get to go to bed at the same
time because of what we do
vlogging whether it's editing whether
it's smile more store what it's like our
time kids go to bed and it is our time
to actually focus on some more business
huh like finish what we have yeah like
let's imagine like think of vlogging as
um you wake up every morning and you
start at zero right let's imagine you're
a vlogger you wake up and you are
currently at zero when you pick up your
camera you put the battery in it you hit
record
you just past zero and you may be here
at one too
and by the time you go to bed every
night you have to be at 100 and no
matter how awesome no matter how big no
matter how great no matter how real that
day was you wake up and you're back at
zero it's like grandma's there my god
hey buddy I love you and then you always
have little monsters climb in a row yeah
sneaking around best body in the whole
world right here
one of them I'm gonna have a little girl
best buddy soon that's going to be leash

sign off for today get to that hundred
and start tomorrow back at zero and yeah
you want in the vlog with me my little
jack-o'-lantern these kids make me so
happy man well I don't know if my life
would be so boring without my kids

of it and drink it on my zero in the
morning I love you guys so much you are
