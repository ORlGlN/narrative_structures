location I thought that was our location
but actually it's at a different part
Christian's behind the wheel whoa you
guys ready come on baby
Joy's wardrobe she takes care of us they
eat out of your hand
I lost only think bad about this is
trying to find a restroom in the middle
of nowhere and this is definitely a
shady spot hello my name is Christian
Fergus trim I am an associate producer
on the project natural born pranksters
my main role is to make sure all the
fellows are in the right spots and make
sure things are moving around on set you
know sometimes I'm grabbing a camera
just getting getting some of the fun
bits that the guys get to do so while
we're filming I'm pretty much floating
around with the guys I want of Italian
dentists kind of need to know where they
are at all times just so when they're
ready to shoot and cameras are up and we
want them on their game then I get the
signal through my walkie here send them
right in and you know let them take over
and kill it yeah we're really excited to
be working on this project this movie is
going to be insane these guys are
killing it we're working on some crazy
and big stuff for you guys you know I
can't tell you much now but we're really
excited for you to see it so stay tuned
these behind-the-scenes logs are going
to give you the closest possible look
you can other than being on set with us
and so I just encourage you to keep
watching and look forward to the project
when it comes out
you do that just to do that why do you
do that tell them oh just in case you
have to do reshoots or anything any kind
of continuity like if we have to come
back and pull the prank two weeks from
now she'll know exactly what outfit you
don't necessarily have to wear the same
thing yeah but it's it matches it makes
the movie look better yeah okay we're
hitting our second prank today um
sucks not me I'll tell you guys what
we're doing but uh yeah we're on prank 2
we wrapped on on the first prank so here
we go
let's do it he's good Christ my man you
guys remember Nick he's actually one of
our writers for this movie
they came saying some profane words on
tape yep very harrassing he's a good guy
he's actually gonna be me talking to him
sometimes in movies like today I've
already won this one so I put this in
and then Nick can watch from anywhere
and basically uncock gonna feed us I
think I'm gonna do not be right hand it
would be like that but I'd be all the
way out there so it's it's basically a
way to get a little more comedy out of
the bit it helps us shitty pranksters be
better that's what it is when our
producers just come out and say it
that's what they would say he's the
snare here - hello now guys that we're
goods we're going to give you an ear
piece of lighter Hooven to be funny by
god stamped me and you didn't get the
sandwich

one invest reactions of the day really
