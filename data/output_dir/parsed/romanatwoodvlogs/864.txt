what's up guys what's up my friends hope
you're feeling good I woke up with this
idea today that I have to try I haven't
utilized this gigantic RC car and I
thought what but you know what I'm just
gonna show you let's just do this
alright got it all filled up with gas we
are going to yes this little rope a
couple d-rings oh you guys know what's
gonna happen
there's my GoPro mm both batteries are
charged and came is this a good idea it
is that's what I thought I thought the
same thing it won't we start it up and
warm it up let's get her warmed up I
mean what do I do I know I'm about to
hook this up to a blank and do a blank
line what all right I'm gonna hook this
string to it I'm gonna get on a
skateboard and drive around and see if
it'll pull me
alright guys hope you're doing fun stuff
with your summer because time is ticking
this is just something stupid I wanted
to try it's like this car was designed
for stuff like this do that this is my
favorite board man the sector 9 I don't
know why soft wheels everything just
seems like it's gonna work I wish I
could hold on to the rub I think that
would be way easier but since I got to
hook it to the board so that I can drive
the RC alright huh can't forget to the
controller hook it to it girl I really
have no idea what to expect
on this last thing God ever GoPro what
wha what do you you know what this yeah
anything any right there it's even got
the right now SWANA
daddy's got some things to do
yeah
oh my god
ah
oh right it gets some slack and then
just rips you off you have to like step
I don't know how to explain it
okay hi okay
right off the bat I figured out that
there's first of all there's slack in
the rope if there slack in the rope the
RC pulls you off and if there's not
slack in the rope you're passing the RC
so it's like there's no like happy
medium it's either you're getting pulled
off or you're passing the RC and it
makes the rope you tangle it up so I'm
gonna try again later for now it's
blistering hot outside we're going to
blow up a big slip and slide for the
kids and just get wet that's what we
need to do
there's a worm you want touch him grab
him is he soft hey this looks fun I'm
gonna play on it I think this is daddy's

I was really nice dude am i next
I am not yet you going faster faster
faster faster come on faster fast been
spin up spin spin oh man okay guys so
I've done this in the past but I still
get tons and tons of requests for it I'm
gonna do it if you know about it uh then
this may bore you or maybe you'll still
enjoy it but I'm gonna talk to you real
quickly about my fish tank everybody
still asks about the fish tanks so here
we go here's a little bit about the fish
tank
am I gonna put a GoPro in it I should
everybody has requested that too first
thing you all know is that this camera
cannot handle LED lights like this it
makes everything bright purple and blue
making the tank look awful so this is
how you make it look good on camera
oh look at that nice and bright you can
see all the real colors very cool this
is a 300 gallon very established reef
tank and we just celebrated one full
year this is a one-year anniversary and
I think I want to pull some old vlog
footage and show you what this tank
looks like when we started um so you can
do just about anything you want with the
lights you can make them any color you
want of course it's hard for the camera
to pick up on what's actually going on
that's more like a night mode red it's
got a thunderstorm mode puts the tank
into like a dark thunderstorm mode or is
actually lightning and rain and thunder
it's pretty well oh everybody uses it I
guess is pretty relaxing and then you
can go from that peaceful raining
Thunder like it is outside to disco baby
chicky chicky chicky chicky well I think
the fish like it too much Sam I'm not
there there's a dirty porthole and Kings
bedroom mm-hmm it's pretty cool so now
here's some things I've never shown you
so this tank runs um see these little
vents back here water constantly all day
and night falls into those vents on each
side of the tank and runs under the
floor all the way down to the smile more
store those pipes run the water all the
way down into this room that was built
just for the fish tank this room was not
here when I moved in the house it was
built just for this tank
oh it's the light burner hice the light
bulbs out so should show you real quick
these are the mixing tanks this is the
filtration all the water comes in
through these pipes into this giant tub
of water
this is a protein skimmer this is what
takes out all the poop and bad parts of
the water right here that's all fish poo
it snakes like yeah company that runs my
aquarium can see all the tank levels and
temperatures from their computer it's
pretty crazy this is a little machine
adds buffering calcium to the water all
day and night guess without a light in
there it looks pretty shady so for my
really long time viewers you've already
known all this but for the new guys
girls I hope you enjoyed that is the
fish tank and this is where the lights
are
before I adjust them for camera this is
what it looks like on camera it's just
bright blue that's what you'll notice in
my pranks is just like a bright blue
glare on the wallet it's my tank what
are we doing and no oh my gosh it's the
best huh yeah hey come on hmm it's ours
I'll share with you yeah
